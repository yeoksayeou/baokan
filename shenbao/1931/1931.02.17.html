<p>此次西班牙内閣之辭職。非内閣本身問題。而爲帝制存廢問題也爲内閣本。</p>
<p>身問題而辭職。苟後繼者選任得人。政局即可安定。爲帝制問題而牽動内閣。則非於君主與民主兩途。得一切實之解决。内閣改組而政局終不安定。西班牙人想望共和已久。一致主張非請西王遜位不可。而西王尙欲維持自身地位。急急於物色繼任之人。但稍明此中情勢者。不敢就此過渡之重任。故以吾人測之。今後情勢。不出兩途。一爲修改憲法削減國王權力。一爲重訂新憲法。實行民主政體。第一說爲一般溫和派所倡導。第二說則爲急進派與多數國民主張之。此後西王勢不得不從第一說。允許修改憲法。如今日自由黨領袖艾爾巴所言。須俟西王依允修改西班牙君主相之權力時。始可應西王之請而返國故能由此進行。艾氏返國組閣或亦可緩和一時者也。然此緩和一時之政策。終不能挽回主張澈底改革之人心。試觀喀泰隆領袖康波之言。謂今日西班牙所需要者。非狄克推多制。亦非無目的之革命更非目前政體之維持但祗欲得眞正德謨克拉西之統治耳。此言足以代表一般班西牙之人心。故僅修改憲法。減削王權决不能满西人之意。故非完全達到民主政治目的實行第二說則西班牙之共和運動。終不能一日停息。政局亦必不能一日安定此蓋可惟預斷者也。</p>

<p>馬·一·笠·</p>
<p>先生字慕韓。晚年别署孟晉老人。武陵望族也。歷任顯宦。並出使外洋。在政五十載。煊赫三十年。黨國底定。始引退南下。卜居海上。膝下兒女衆多。境狀奇窘。蓋先生生平樂善好施。且不擅經濟學。以致服務多載。仍兩袖清風。家無擔石。月前因病留滬。遽歸道山。噩耗傳來。凡識與不識。莫不同聲嗟惋。予世受鴻恩。無以相報。爲文至此。不禁感愧交併。爰摭述其軼事數則。藉以風世。而表彰先生德行之萬一云爾。</p>
<p>甲子齊盧戰爭。先生爲桑梓請命。隻身奔走。幾無虚日。旋联前線已實行開　。迺嘆息不置。盧子嘉召讌督署先生竟撕去請柬。遠走湖濱。次晨偕同避難民衆離杭。無一知者。</p>
<p>翌年孫馨遠入浙。適門下士夏超主省政。夏因擴充警備。爲孫部忌。漸起暗潮。各自戒備。形勢緊張。如王竹齊金百順輩。共起週旋無效。卒推先生出。時正嚴冬。更深夜靜。尙在軍署中作揖道歉。其能不忘故鄕安危。有是者。洵難能也。</p>
<p>先生敦尙古道。天性至孝。介弟仲璵亦然。璵名寳瑄。曾任甬海關監督。第逢春秋，必相偕歸里。探親掃墓。來則必寓其先岳張勤果公祠。祠本饒風景。幽雅精潔。頗宜小住。昆仲遇無酬酢。輒相携游湖。某年月夜。擬放棹三潭。苦無舟子。適予與先兄文彬在側。自告奮勇。分任打槳職。浩蕩前進。先生昆仲亦捲袖相助。破風逐浪。逸興遄飛。往事猶歷歷在目。撫今追昔。能不悵然。</p>
<p>民黨鉅子蔣觀雲先生病故滬寓。先生扶杖送殯號哭里許。淚跡甫乾。喪報又臨。其六妹張夫人罹疾去世。星夜奔往。撫柩慟哭。三日内老淚頻揮。目瀋枯竭其於故人情感之深。似有非常人所可及者。　　黨軍出師。先生引退南下。黨國要人。咸多稱頌。或詢以孫總理主義如何。彼必翹其母指稱曰「好」。並稱本人與總理友交甚篤。對蔣總司令尤多誇讚。如遇國事。類多關懷。浙省府張靜江曾聘爲高等顧問。時有貢獻。故先生之於黨國。亦不無微勞也。</p>
<h3 id="c136">雪 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>秋·水·</p>
<p>這幾天來。上海連朝大雪。眞正好看煞人。俗云。冬雪保五榖。春雪保人口。現在我們旣有冬雪。復有春雪。那末好看之外。更屬可喜的了。</p>
<p>然而雪這種東西。就目前而論。則有害而無益。尤其在交能一方面。雪本視爲交通四大仇之首。何謂四大仇。一雪、二霧、三雹、四水。霧能迷途。雹毀車輛。水没規轍。均爲交能之大敵。而雪於迷失途程。毀損車輛。淹没規轍之外。又來一個壓毀電線。你想雪之爲患又如何。</p>
<p>火車見雪。更屬棘手。猶憶一八六六年。英國之北數地NORTHNUMBERLAND大雪。積高至五六尺。火車幾全埋入雪中。旣不能行動。車中客更没法出外。交通人員設法除雪。方把車客救出。然而有一部分人則守候至四日之久。雪消方得出車。眞正可怕</p>
<p>因此。在歐美各國的鐵路局裏。必有特製之除雪車設備。除雪車以鋼質或木料造成。爲重至少須二十六號。有輪三對。以機發動。輪旁更有鐵板及鐵刷數事。雪</p>
<p>中或雪後。沿鐵軌一路開去。能把積雪推向左右。把鐵軌洗刷乾凈。車内有火爐以取暖。有廚房以製飲食。可容數十人。因爲雪後沿途除雪。輒須費一二日之繼續工作啊。</p>
<p>英國的腦福克。於一八八一年。遭未有之大雪。其地火車當然不能開行。而除雪車亦難聽命。因爲雪下得太大。天氣又冷。除雪車的引擎小。就没法可想。最後借用八個火車龍頭。在車後生火推去。方得開動。亦雪中一件趣事。</p>

<p>湯·彬·</p>
<p>杭州的文藝界、最近是異常勃興、是一般愛好文藝的、靑年所組織的小規模的文藝團體、也大都有定期刋物的發行、而且它底内容、都是屬於提倡民族主義文藝的、這實是中國内地文藝界一種良好的現象、其原因、無疑地是受了海上民族主義文藝運動的影響、我們要曉得、近代的中國文學是缺乏一種正確的中心思想、所以使整個的文藝界弄得黑漆一團、思想的混亂、實不可以言語形容、最有碍於靑年們的光明的前途的、莫如在不久以前盛興一時的那普羅文藝了、如果我們要肅清這些腐化和惡化的思想、那只有鼓吹一種靑年們所需要的具有心思想的文藝、在無形中那種不正確的思想就會洗清的了、</p>
<p>民族主義文藝運動成爲中國文壇的主潮、就是爲了它具有確的中心思想、而且這是爲目前靑年界所最需要的、我們　要看民族主義文藝自海上發動以來、各地的刋物和報章所響應的却不在少數、這發現於杭州文藝界的「靑萍月刋」、就是其中最有力的一種、</p>
<p>這創刋號的内容、頗爲豐富、如丁淚鴻的「狂奏着吧」、徵波的「民族性文學與人生、」和幽微底「心曲」、曉風的「像樣的紳士、」公助的「你怎能盡情地留戀、」没名的「爲了不忠實」、徘霞的一咱們的世界」等、都是値得注意的力作、至少在思想上是具有正確的意識的、</p>
<p>在「我們的開端」裏、是這樣的在狂奏着、「我們抓住了時代、這時代在我們生命的節奏上佔着很重要的一段、但、朋友、你當記着、這是很容易過去了的、也要、會像已往死黯底年華一般地消逝、在四週的無形的、在虚渺的幻想中、牠輕輕地消逝了、因此、我們需要在這裏對人生下一個深刻的認識、然後如此平凡地記錄着、這認識是極廣義的、是我們生活的小模型、是我們呐喊的收音機、···我們要記錄着、記錄着這些平凡的故事、同時、把内心的美妙底顏色顯示出來、作我們靈魂生存上的一個紀念、因了這點極微小極微小的意思、靑萍的蓓蕾今天開始展着了、隨着我們又接受新的命運之神底啓示、依賴着花的鮮艷嬌嫩、去完成一切、同情我們的朋友們、請站在我們同一的陣線上、彈響心弦、盡力地狂奏着吧、趁着靑春、來負起這使命、」</p>
<p>在引起我們感動的狂奏之後、就是一篇有力的論著丨民族性文學與人生、内容雖然嫌單簡一些、但是所論各點都很正確的、</p>
<p>同時、作者對於中國的文壇亦有評判、這也很確實的話、如他所述、「我們看中國的新文壇是呈顯着怎樣的現象、自從十幾年前轟轟烈烈的閙着新文學運動以來、其間固然有不少活潑的情感、以實現爲題材的作品以來、然而到現在新文學並不見怎樣的一日千里、精神異常銷沉、」這當然、它最大的缺點還是爲了没有正確的中心思想、使中國的新文藝不能有所發展、我們要拯救中國文壇的危機、即是使新文學有所的表現、那麽、非提倡民族主義文藝不可了、在作者、也想到了這一點、所以最後他是這樣的結束着、「現在是二十世紀了、我們應負起這時代、所需要的文學、丨民族主義文學丨底使命、」這般靑年者、如果這樣的來努力、一定能夠得到偉大的收果、但是現在已經有了相當的成績突現於我們的眼前了、</p>
<p>「像樣的紳士、」「和爲了不忠實」兩篇小說、都値得我們一讀、因爲他們見解都是非常正確的、實際我們也可以把它當作理想的文字看、在詩歌方面、尤其是一些珍貴的作品、有豐富的情感、向上的意識美麗的字句、鼓勵的雋語、因爲篇幅關係、在此怒不一一加以徵引了、</p>
<p>在杭州的文藝界、能給我們這樣的有力的一種提倡民族主義文學的刋物給我們、委實是可喜的現象、而且、他們在萌芽的時代、就有這樣蓬勃的生氣、以後的開展、當然是無可限量的呢、我熱誠的在此作愼重的推薦、却是極有意義的事吧、最後、我希望「靑萍」同人發奮努力、希望海上文藝界對他們有所注意、</p>

<p>安·娜·</p>
<p>一個冰天雪地的下午</p>
<p>一路電車、那顆粒般的雪花、有了北風的鞏助、格外來得活潑的在空中飛舞、我雖然披上了大衣和戴上了帽子、也敵不過他的攻擊、心裏愈是着急、電車愈是姗姗來遲、害得我面上像有千萬枚針刺着般的作　、</p>
<p>陰暗的天、更顯出他的困倦了、路燈漸漸增多了、我念着家人的企望着我、尤其是母親的遠念呀、她會在這漸入黃昏的當兒、冒風雪的立在門前、伸長了頸子在等待着她那外出求學的兒女回家、她度日如年的望着、眉間的皺紋漸漸增多了呵、偉大的母愛、會使困倦了的遊子的必靈舒快、使充满了煩愁的人們都會微笑的、使我這冰凍了的身軀溫暖······</p>
<p>呵、偉大的母愛、</p>
<p>這樣的想着、微笑着、彷佛已立在母親的跟前、看到她慈祥的容顏和那和藹的慰問、忘却了自己還立在這雪地之上、手中還有一包方才在醫院解剖下來的胎兒的心心臟、肺臟、和肝臟、</p>
<p>這胎兒不幸横產、在子宮内經過了長久時期而　死了、他還得了梅梅毒的遺傳、丨由肝臟的肥大告訴我的、他生得很好看、像熟睡了的嬰孩、雙頰還像萍菒般紅得可愛、我不相信他是離開了人間的人、是没靈魂的人、唉、我不知怎的、對這可愛無辜的胎兒、表十二分憐憫的同情、　　··················</p>

<p>Royal Family Abuses Privileges, Popular Grievances Boil Over</p>
<p>Republican Forces激[Excited]张[Increase], Overall Trend Gone</p>
<p>King Calls on Leader of Liberal Party to Form Cabinet</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 15th - The people of Spain are extremely agitated, especially in the capital and major industrial cities. Demonstrations continue throughout the day, and explicitly demand the king's abdication and the abolition of the imperial system. They are no longer satisfied with amending the constitution, and cries for the king's early death can be heard from time to time. On one occasion, a large group of people attempted to attack the prison to release those detained in the recent revolutionary case, but were eventually dispersed by the police and security forces. The situation in cities outside the capital such as Zaragoza, Barcelona, Valencia, Granada, Seville, and other major towns is the same. In short, the republican forces have spread everywhere. The main question at the moment is when the army will join the revolution, but most people believe that this will also happen very soon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 15th - Campo arrived here today and, after meeting with the King, conferred with General Berenguer at the Ministry of War on everything. Campo later issued an article saying that he advised the King to accept a government organized by the left wing. The King has now telegraphed Alba, the leader of the Liberal Party who is living in Paris, urging him to return to Beijing immediately. It is likely that the King will ask Alba to form a cabinet. General public opinion favors a complete amendment to the constitution and a reduction of the King's power. From the looks of it, the King is now willing to obey the extreme left wing. Berenguer told people that he denied the claim that he would go abroad for rest. He wants to stay a little longer to find a suitable position in the army.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 15th - Spanish Liberal Party leader Alba did not give a definitive statement tonight when reporters asked him about the King's telegram urging him to return to the country, but said that he would have to wait until the King agreed to amend the inherited policies of the Spanish monarchy before he could return to Mali. Alba received the King's telegram asking him to return to the country immediately yesterday, and it is expected that the King will ask him to form a cabinet. Alba previously fled from Spain to Paris as a political exile.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 15th - Catallón leader Campo wrote to a newspaper, saying that what the country needs is neither a dictatorial vocabulary nor a revolution, let alone the maintenance of the current political system, but only to be ruled by true democracy. Reuters, Madrid, 15th - Minor disturbances occurred in various places here yesterday. The Republican Party did not listen to the official ban and held meetings in many places. The police dispersed them repeatedly. The King received many political leaders today, each telling the King his opinions on the future government.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th - The Berlin Daily's Madrid correspondent commented on the Berenguer government, stating that since Berenguer succeeded Rivera as Prime Minister on January 29 last year, he called for the elimination of the abuses of dictatorship and the restoration of the constitutional rights of popular sovereignty as soon as Congress abolished the laws announced by the Rivera government. And because the Liberal Party承[Taking]六年[Six Years]推[Push]克[Conquer]狄[Di](or Dick)多[Many]政[Government]之后[After], if the freely elected Congress is convened suddenly, it seems too dangerous for the royal family, so Berenguer had to extend the election period again and again, first trying to restore royal power. However, the general trend has gone, even the most severe inspection system cannot slightly hinder the activities of the Republican faction. Because of this, newspapers and leaflets criticizing the people in power filled the country, and the king was the center of public resentment. The group pointed out that he abused his privileges, plundered the people's wealth to enrich himself privately, and transported huge amounts of money abroad for safety, while forcing the people of the country to keep money in the country, suffering losses from devaluation. Words of such resentment are too numerous to list, resulting in popular grievances boiling over and the loss of all popular support. In addition, the people around the king are all taking care of their own interests and not thinking about preserving the throne at all, so today the Spanish imperial system has reached the end of the road. Its hope of maintaining its unfallen state is almost exhausted.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Japanese Communist Party Incident <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Large-Scale Arrests of Students Studying in Japan</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang's Son Also Included</p>
<p>Jiji News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - After the Japanese Metropolitan Police Department举[Lift]日本[Japan]共产[Communist]党[Party] (the so-called 4.16 case), it learned of a secret society of Chinese students studying in Japan organizing the Chinese Communist Party and its plans to expand its party organization nationwide with Tokyo as the center. On October 3, Showa 4 (Republic of China 18), it jointly联合[United]举行[Hold]举行[Hold]举行[Hold]举行[Hold] with police departments across the country, and arrested the party members of the party at the same time. At the same time, it banned the publication of various newspapers, and after a serious interrogation, those with minor crimes were sent back to their country, and those who were the chief instigators were indicted and accused, attached to the preliminary trial. Recently, as the relationship between the Chinese and Japanese governments came to an end, the ban was lifted at 5 PM today. According to the Metropolitan Police Department, the beginning of the arrest of the Chinese Communists was due to the fact that Japanese Communist Party members who were arrested in the 3.15 and 4.16 cases heard about the Red plot of the Chinese Communist Party. The police department immediately conducted a secret investigation in the Kanto area of Tokyo, where the most Chinese students studying in Japan resided. As a result, it was decided to resolutely arrest the party members. After Police Commissioner General Maruyama visited Chinese Minister Wang Rongbao to request understanding, he arrested them all at dawn the next day. Earlier, on August 4, Showa 4, the Metropolitan Police Department learned that there were more than 100 Chinese students studying in Japan plotting to destroy the Chinese Embassy in a vacant lot near the Matsuya Department Store in Ginza, Tokyo. It immediately ordered the entire police force of the Kitakanya Police Station to be dispatched, and 14 chief instigators were arrested and sentenced to 29 days of detention. As a result of the serious interrogation, the secret organization of the Chinese Communist Party was discovered. The Communist Party members established Communist Party branches in Sendai, Sapporo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Okayama, Nagasaki, etc., and contacted each other, planning to promote the organization and attempt to redden the East. The most characteristic of the party's movement is that it does not have a fixed headquarters. Party members often go into hiding and move around, and work with Shanghai. The names of the defendants are listed on the left:</p>

<h3 id="e34">New Trends in the Spanish Political Situation <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The resignation of the Spanish cabinet this time is not a problem of the cabinet itself, but a problem of whether the imperial system should存[Survive]废[Be Abolished] or not. If the problem is of the cabinet itself, and the successor is elected well, the political situation can be stabilized. If the problem is of the imperial system and affects the cabinet, then unless a real solution is obtained on the two paths of monarchy and democracy, the cabinet is reorganized and the political situation will eventually be unstable. The Spanish have long wanted a republic and unanimously advocated that the King of Spain must abdicate. However, the King of Spain still wants to maintain his position and is anxiously looking for a successor. But those who are slightly aware of the situation dare not take on this important task of transition. Therefore, as we measure it, the future situation will not go beyond two paths. One is to amend the constitution to reduce the power of the king, and the other is to revise the new constitution and implement a democratic system. The first theory is advocated by the general moderates, and the second theory is advocated by the radicals and the majority of the people. In the future, the King of Spain will have no choice but to follow the first theory and allow the amendment of the constitution. As Liberal Party leader Alba said today, he must wait until the King of Spain agrees to amend the powers of the Spanish monarch before he can respond to the King's invitation and return to China. Only in this way can Alba's return to China and the formation of a cabinet perhaps ease the situation for a time. However, this policy of easing the situation for a time cannot挽回[Restore] the hearts of those who advocate thorough reform. Look at the words of Catalan leader Campo, who said that what Spain needs today is neither a dictatorial system, nor a meaningless revolution, nor the maintenance of the current political system, but only to obtain the rule of true democracy. These words are enough to represent the hearts of the general Spanish people. Therefore, simply amending the constitution and reducing royal power will never satisfy the Spanish people. Therefore, unless the goal of democratic politics is fully achieved and the second theory is implemented, the Spanish republican movement will never stop for a day, and the political situation will never be stable. This is a prediction that can only be made.</p>

<p>Jiji News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - More than 300 people were arrested for the Chinese Communist Party incident in Japan. Most of them were Chinese students studying in Japan. More than 100 party members have been indicted. The preliminary trial determined that more than 30 people were guilty. In addition to those who were determined to be guilty among the party members, there were also 40 people who were deported immediately and 9 who were deported at any time, totaling 49 people. Most of them were young people in their twenties. Feng Yuxiang's son was also included and was not prosecuted. The special branch of the Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly contacted the Japanese Communist Party to request mutual cooperation, but the Chinese Party Headquarters did not approve of this move on the grounds that the Japanese Communist Party was on the verge of serious destruction. By March of Showa 4, Sano Manabu participated in the communist parties of the two countries, and a joint declaration was issued to the people of China and Japan in Shanghai. Japanese special branch party members Li Yanong, Yu Bingwen, etc., since August Showa 4, have been in contact with people from the National Council of Labor Unions of Japan.

<p>Washington, 15th (Associated Press dispatch) – State Department officials today continued discussions with Dr. Wu Chaoshu, the Chinese Minister to Washington, regarding China's request for the abolition of extraterritorial rights enjoyed by American citizens in China. It is reported that the current point of contention lies in the matter of foreign advisory judges in Chinese courts. The Chinese side strongly advocates that after the abolition of consular jurisdiction, foreigners may serve in Chinese courts in an advisory capacity, but even this should be of a temporary nature. The American side, however, insists that foreign judges must be permanently stationed in Chinese courts, and that foreign personnel should be able to step in and replace Chinese judges when the latter are unable to render impartial verdicts. It is heard that during the recent exchange of views in Washington, a compromise solution was discussed. The United States now intends to respond to China as soon as possible regarding the latest [missing word] on the point of contention regarding consular jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9 a.m. on February 16th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 99th weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in the main auditorium. Attending were Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Chu Minyi, Ma Chaojun, Chen [missing name]ying, Wang Bailing, Yu Jingtang, officials from various departments and committees, and approximately 500 guests. Hu Hanmin presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, the chairman reported, stating briefly: "Since the Fourth Plenary Session decided on three training programs regarding the promotion of party affairs, the work of party members, and the rectification of party discipline, there is a clear direction. This should be regarded by all comrades as a motto to be followed without fail. It must be understood that serving the party requires consistent action, with no retreat, taking the requirements of the principles as a basis, and jointly striving for the demands of the entire political situation, thus meeting the hopes of the entire populace. The reason why there is a need to correct the current party affairs work is that there is a psychological error, believing that the warlords have been eliminated, the overall situation is gradually becoming unified, and the work of the party can be somewhat relaxed, without being very tense, and that reaching stability is sufficient, thinking that inaction is better than action. Therefore, the spirit of struggle and advancement is gradually decreasing. It is not known that in the destruction period, the revolutionary spirit was used to remove all obstacles, and now that it is the construction period, the responsibility is even more important and there are many obstacles. The work is turning negative, and how can this be explained? If the qin and se are not in tune, the strings can be changed and retuned. If, because of the lack of tune, the strings are discarded and not played, it is like choking oneself by refusing to eat, which is impossible. The party must combine doctrine and action as the axis of politics. If it loses its ability to act, then any cause must fall behind, so how can there be advancement, and how can there be construction? The Communist Party often uses insidious methods to divide the party. If we can unite as a whole, and the work of the doctrine is increasingly tense, then their plans will not be successful, and the elimination of the Communist disaster will not be difficult. The spirit of the party is in knowledge, benevolence and courage, and the application of knowledge and benevolence depends on courage to achieve it. Willingness to sacrifice is great courage. Looking at past history, whether military, political or party affairs, if the person in charge has the determination to sacrifice, there is no reason for failure. Now, the ambition of the reactionaries and imperialists has not been completely abandoned, and the actions of the party must not be relaxed. Even when the reactionaries are eliminated and the imperialists hand over power, there must be actions to adapt to the needs to prepare for unforeseen events, and we must not be careless and waste our efforts. Although there is no single path to training, the main point is to keep acting and be willing to sacrifice. For all matters concerning the people, which are things that the party ought to do, mobilize at any time without retreating. Furthermore, we must act in unison with a spirit of unity, gather the strength of the masses, and make a great mobilization of the whole. The two words training are related and connected, like governing an army. If there is training without practice, then male energy will decrease, and it will be difficult to improve work efficiency." After the report, the meeting adjourned at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10 a.m. on the same morning, the National Government held the weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Attending were Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Zhu Peide, Wang Boqun, Chu Minyi, Liu Yufen, Liu Shangqing, Ma Fuxiang, Wei Daoming, Lin Xiang, Liu Ruiheng, Niu Shuijian, He Yaozu, Zhang Huichang, Li Shuhua, Zheng Hongnian, Chen Yi, Zhang Wohua, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Yawei, and over two hundred officials from the National Government's civil service and military affairs departments. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the meeting. Hu Hanmin gave a speech, stating briefly: "The two sentences in the party song, 'loyally diligent, bravely courageous, faithfully trusting,' are instructions given by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen to the students of the military academy. The meaning is not only addressed to the military academy, because revolutionaries should have the determination to sacrifice and the courage to self-examine in order to restore the spirit of the nation. Recently, officials often commit the evils of laxity, negligence, complacency, and seeking ease. The National Government has followed the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session and issued instructions to reform politics, which people should follow. Now that the Control Yuan has been established and the candidates for the Control Committee have been announced, it is hoped that all working comrades will have the spirit of observing the law and acting in the public interest, practicing loyalty, diligence, trust, and banishing the bad habits of lethargy and lack of energy. If they still cannot fulfill their duties, they will not be forgiven by the people. As for the powers of the Control Yuan as stipulated in the National Government Organization Law, there are two points: impeachment and audit. The purpose of the censorate system of the Qing Dynasty was only to correct the monarch's mistakes, and its greatest responsibility was limited to speaking out. The current situation is very different. Apart from reactionaries, everyone inside and outside the party has the right to speak. If there are errors in policies, they should be corrected by the party headquarters, which is not within the scope of the Control Yuan's powers. The candidates for the Control Committee who have now been announced all have considerable histories. It is hoped that they will appropriately impeach the powers they are responsible for, and not be too ambitious and hasty, or be too lax and aim to establish a truly honest government."</p>
<h3 id="e41">Zhang Xueliang's Talk with a Group of Japanese Reporters <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang, the Deputy Commander, at the request of Shibayama, the Japanese advisor to the Border Defense Headquarters, received a group of Japanese reporters at the Border Defense Headquarters at 4 p.m. on the 10th. He gave a talk on the current situation, with the following main points: (1) On the issue of the Northeast's relationship with the Central Government, Zhang said that as a member of the Central Government, he naturally supports the Central Government. The Party Affairs Guidance Committee has been established here, but when it will formally begin its work is still under study. His personal opinions on the Kuomintang have been proposed at the Fourth Plenary Session and are on record, and he will naturally remain consistent. (2) On the issue of military expenditures for the Northwest Army and the Shanxi Army, he said that the expenses of the Shanxi Army are borne by Shanxi Province, while the expenses of the Northwest Army are borne by the Central Government. The expenses of the Central Army are paid by the Central Government, and the expenses of the local armies are borne by the local governments. (3) On the issue of the organization of the Deputy Commander's Headquarters, he said that the headquarters of the Deputy Commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will definitely be established in Beiping. Since he became the Deputy Commander, his political duties have become increasingly heavy, and he wants to transfer the position of Commander of the Border Defense to someone more capable, but it is not convenient to force anyone to take over, so for now, he has to hold the position himself. (4) On the issue of the replacement and transfer of the chairmen of the Northeast provinces, he said that there are many rumors about this matter, but the appointment, removal, and transfer of the chairmen of the provinces cannot be decided solely by him. Therefore, the talk of transferring the chairmen is not likely to materialize at this time. (5) On the issue of suppressing the Communist Party, he said that among the Communist Party, there is a distinction between those who study doctrines and those who plan riots. He has ordered the police and other agencies to strictly suppress the rioters. However, this issue is also related to the security of Japan, and he is willing to work with Japan to thoroughly suppress them. (6) On the issue of abolishing likin and subsequent arrangements, he said that the abolition of likin is indeed something that the Central Government should do, and the Central Government should subsidize the impact on the local finances. However, local governments must also reduce government expenses to alleviate the burden on the people. (7) On the issue of negotiations with Japan on railways, he said that there is currently no need to negotiate with Japan on the current state of railway transportation in the Northeast. Kimura, the director of the South Manchuria Railway Company, has been dispatched to Shenyang, probably to take the opportunity to conduct research on business matters. As for the rumors about the railway network plan proposed by the Northeast Transportation Committee, they are purely fabricated rumors and have no basis, so there is no need to explain them.</p>

<p>No Results on Various Budget Proposals</p>
<p>Twenty-Two Proposals Have Been Announced</p>
<p>Zhang Zhao, Chairman of Chahar and Hebei Provinces, Comes to Shenyang</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Northern Financial Conference, which opened on January 26th, concluded on February 10th. Excluding the two days of recess in the middle due to Sundays, there were thirteen plenary sessions. Due to the large discrepancies between income and expenditure in the budget proposals of the provinces and cities, no results were achieved. Other matters relating to currency and surtaxes resulted in 76 proposals, of which 22 have been announced. There is no definite date for the announcement of the rest. As for the various budget proposals that have not yet been decided, they will be submitted to the Political Committee for discussion and decision. At the meeting on the 11th, Zhang Xueliang summoned all members to his private residence. Zhang also telegraphed Liu Yifei, Chairman of Chahar Province, and Wang Shuchang, Chairman of Hebei Province, to come to Shenyang to join the discussion on the budget proposals. Liu has replied that he will come to Shenyang on the 15th to spend the New Year. Wang has not yet replied because he is inspecting troops in Tianjin. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e43">The Three Eastern Provinces Establish an Office for Purchasing and Transporting Local Products <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The economy of the Northeast is declining and becoming increasingly precarious, a phenomenon rarely seen before. The authorities believe that this is due to the fall in prices of local products. It has been found that the export of local products from the Northeast has always been in the hands of foreign merchants. Since the recent gold-silver price changes and other factors, many foreign merchants have been hesitant to move forward. The Northern Financial Conference decided to have the governments of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang jointly raise large sums of money and jointly organize a special product purchase and transportation office to purchase large quantities of local products for direct export and sale to the interior, in order to raise the prices of local products, break the deadlock, and change the environment. The transport and sales methods are divided into three phases. A special product purchase and transport office will be established in the official banks of the three eastern provinces and will begin operations immediately. The articles of association are as follows: (1) The provincial governments of the three eastern provinces will organize a special product purchase and transport office for the purchase and transport of special products. (2) The office will have one director, four deputy directors, and a number of clerks. (3) The head office will be located in the official bank of the three eastern provinces, and branch offices will be established in suitable locations as needed. (4) The personnel of the head office and branch offices will be concurrently staffed by personnel from various banks and businesses and will not receive additional salaries. Other expenses will be paid from official expenses. (5) The director will be responsible for all affairs of the entire office, and the deputy directors will assist him. (6) Each branch office will have one director, and the number of clerks will be determined by the complexity of the affairs. (7) The special product office will specialize in the purchase and transport of grains and beans, the special products of the three provinces, for export at any time. Purchases will be made in phases. The first phase will purchase 30,000 cars, the second phase 20,000 cars, and the third phase 10,000 cars.

<h3 id="e44">Tragic Fire at the Fushun Coal Mine <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Rumors of 3,000 Chinese Workers Killed or Injured</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Claims No One Was Injured</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Liaoning National Diplomacy Association has learned that a fire suddenly broke out at 11:50 a.m. on the 8th in the Dayama Main Pit No. 18 of the Fushun South Manchuria Railway Coal Mine. The Japanese side immediately sealed off the mine entrance. There are rumors that 3,000 Chinese workers were killed. The association immediately dispatched Che Xiangchen, the director-general of the Common Sense Promotion Association, and members Hao Keyong and Li Zhengwen, to investigate the matter to determine the truth. Che returned on the 11th. According to him, after arriving in Fushun, he first went to the Education Bureau and the Library to inquire, but he could not find any clues. He then disguised himself and went to the vicinity of the coal mine to investigate, and talked with the miners to find out, but he could not find out the details, and he was interfered with and prevented by the Japanese police and guards. Finally, he met with a certain reporter who was familiar with the situation of the Japanese side and asked about this matter. According to him, a fire did break out in the mine pit, due to a miner mistakenly handling sulfur on a rock. About 2,000 to 3,000 Chinese workers were killed or injured. However, according to the Japanese side's subsequent propaganda, the day was a Sunday and the miners were resting, so no one was injured. However, there are the following doubts: (1) Even on Sundays, there are workers in the mine pit. The Japanese side's propaganda that no one was injured is an overcorrection. (2) When the fire broke out, many family members of the miners went to the side of the pit to see what was happening. Reports said that up to 3,000 people died, but the Japanese side later claimed that no one was injured. The contradiction is too great. Che also said that this accident was due to poor equipment. We should find ways to investigate the actual number of deaths and injuries so that we can negotiate with the Japanese side on the basis of reason and ask them to compensate for the losses.</p>
<p>Another report states that a large fire broke out in the West Second Strip of the Dayama Main Pit of the South Manchuria Railway Coal Mine on the night of the 7th, and many Chinese workers died, a very tragic situation. It is common for Chinese workers to die unnaturally in coal pits due to fires and floods. The current report is about a more severe disaster. The reporter had a lot of trouble finding out the truth. Later, I met a friend who I have known for a long time and who is now employed in a coal mine. Only then did I learn a little about the situation when the fire broke out. The reason was that the equipment in the pit was not good and the temperature was too high, which caused the sulfur in the coal to burn, and the fire was very fierce. In order to protect the coal mine, the mine authorities immediately sealed the entrance, so most of the Chinese workers who were working at the time (reportedly more than 3,070 people) and a small number of Japanese staff (about 30 to 40 people) were killed. The tragic scene of the workers suddenly encountering this disaster, struggling and screaming, is unbearable to imagine. However, the Japanese side is still denying it.</p>
<h3 id="e45">After Ye Yixiong is Transferred to Shenyang, the Local Court Holds a Public Trial <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Ye Admits to Jealousy, But Not to Plotting for Wealth</p>
<p>Reasons for the High Court's Ruling to Transfer the Case to Shenyang</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The case of Ye Yixiong, the former trial judge of the Special District Local Court, for the murder of Zhang Liqing, has been transferred to Shenyang by the judicial authorities of Liaoning Province on the order of Commander Zhang. Ye was transferred to Shenyang on the 8th. However, Zhang Liqing is still being treated in Harbin due to her injuries and has not yet arrived in Shenyang. After Ye was transferred to Shenyang, the Local Court sent him to the prison for detention, and the prosecutor Xue [missing character]ping conducted several investigations. The public prosecution was filed on the 10th. At 10 a.m. on the 11th, the Local Court specially opened a trial in the criminal court. The president of the court, Tang Yinfen, presided. Prosecutor Xue [missing character]ping also appeared in court. At 10:20, Ye was brought out of the prison. Ye wore a blue woolen overcoat and a Turkish fur hat. His appearance was haggard. First, the judge briefly interrogated him. Then, the prosecutor stood up to present the indictment, saying that Ye Yixiong's murder of Zhang Liqing was filed by the Special District Court Prosecutor's Office on charges of encroachment and murder, which was not inappropriate. [missing character] the original indictment and requested the court to make a public judgment according to law. [missing character] the judge interrogated Ye about the murder. Ye confessed without hesitation. [missing character] only confessed that he committed the crime because of jealousy and did not admit that he plotted to kill for wealth. Finally, the judge stood up and announced that the case would be adjourned until the plaintiff arrived in court and a new date was set for the trial. [missing character] then the court adjourned, [missing character] still sent to the prison by the bailiffs for detention.</p>
<p>The Criminal Court ruled that Ye Yixiong's premeditated attempted murder and encroachment case was to be transferred to the Shenyang Local Court of Liaoning Province by the Criminal Court of the Northeast Branch of the Supreme Court, based on the application of the prosecutor of the Northeast Branch of the Supreme Court. [missing character] The reasons for the ruling are as follows: The applicant stated that the defendant Ye Yixiong, who previously served as a candidate trial judge of the Eastern Province Special Region Local Court, was prosecuted by the Binjiang Local Court for premeditated attempted murder and encroachment. Now, the Northeast Political Affairs Committee has telegraphed that the Binjiang Court's trial judge in the Ye Yixiong case is suspected of being unfair, and the office should apply to the Northeast Branch of the Supreme Court for a ruling to designate the Shenyang Local Court as the first [missing character] court and report it for handling. In response to this, the court found that the court where Ye Yixiong originally served and the Binjiang Local Court were in the same region. Although the personnel of the Binjiang Local Court are not necessarily all connected with the defendant, the trial is still likely to be biased. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 21 and 22 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the application should be transferred to the Shenyang Local Court of Liaoning Province for jurisdiction to show judicial authority. According to Article 21 of the Criminal Procedure Law, if a court suspects that a trial may be unfair due to special circumstances, the higher court may transfer the case to another court of the same level within its jurisdiction as the original court. In this case, the defendant's premeditated murder and encroachment case has been referred to the Binjiang Local Court for the first [missing character] trial. It was found that the defendant was originally a candidate trial judge of the Eastern Province Special Region Local Court, and the Binjiang Local Court is in the same region, so it is difficult to guarantee that the trial will be unfair. The application of the applicant should be considered reasonable. In accordance with Article 23 of the Criminal Procedure Law, it should be ruled that this case should be transferred to the Shenyang Local Court of Liaoning Province for first instance jurisdiction.</p>
<h3 id="e46">After the Shanxi Military Division Commanders Take Office <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Each Army Will Be Downsized After the Demobilization Funds Arrive</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Remains Calm Recently</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The issue of downsizing the Shanxi Army has now been resolved. The newly appointed military division commanders have also telegraphed their assumption of office. However, the issue of the road protection army and the garrison is still a major stumbling block to the future of downsizing. The proposed plan was agreed upon by the military commanders and Ji, Hu, Shang, Xu, etc. after several discussions. In addition to Ji and Hu reporting to Shenyang, Ji, Hu, Shang, and Xu jointly telegraphed Zhang for instructions, and advocated that the military commanders should telegraph their assumption of office first. At that time, the military commanders were deeply afraid that after telegraphing their assumption of office, all issues would be said to be subject to compliance, and there would be no way to say anything. Therefore, they advocated telegraphing Zhang for instructions first and then deciding on the policy of assuming office after the reply telegram arrived. [missing character] Fang agreed, and the assumption of office telegram was issued on the 9th. The date at the end of the telegram was written as the character Yu. It is said that Zhang Xueliang sent a telegram on the 7th, ordering that the Tianjin resolution be followed and the organization be carried out quickly. After much research, it was agreed that since the implementation of demobilization required [missing character] to assume office, it was better to assume office before Zhang's telegram, which could show considerable [missing character] attitude. This is where the telegram came from. Zhang's telegram did not mention the road protection army, the garrison, the military committee, and other issues. As for the military commanders, [missing character] there were not many meetings on that day, and their attitude was not as active as in the previous few days. It is currently planned to proceed in separate defense areas after the 2 million yuan of demobilization funds raised by Zhang in Tianjin are remitted.</p>
<p>The local security issue, which is related to the demobilization issue, is now becoming increasingly serious. Robberies are rampant in various counties in southern and eastern Shanxi. Even in the provincial capital, two incidents have occurred in the past two or three days. Guo Su, the magistrate of Linjin County, was recently shot and killed by bandits. Currently, almost all street talk is based on this news. Shanxi, which has been a paradise for the past twenty years, will soon be transformed into a den of bandits.</p>
<p>Shang Zhen's attitude has been extremely calm recently. In addition to agreeing to relinquish the position of military commander at an appropriate time, he has recently stated that he will not take the position of director of civil affairs and will temporarily maintain the old director, Qiu Yangjun. Shang made a statement to reporters yesterday on the aftermath of the Shanxi situation, saying that after the military division commanders of the Shanxi-Suiyuan army sent out telegrams assuming office, it has come to an end. Although Zhang (Xueliang) has not received a reply to his request for a change in the approach to the generals, it has been approved. As for Sun Chu, the commander of the Fifth Division, who was listed in the telegram, he has been appointed as commander of the road protection army. The missing division commander has been appointed by Li Fuying. The generals plan to return to their respective defense areas within a few days to begin to handle the demobilization of their troops. Because the people of Shanxi bear 7 million yuan per month, while the total revenue of the province is only over 1 million yuan per month, the difference between income and expenditure is huge. Therefore, the people's request to cancel the one-yuan surcharge cannot be resolved unless the provincial banknotes are somehow improved. I (Shang himself) am doing my best to urge the central government to implement the previously decided plan to reorganize the 24 million yuan of financial public bonds in Shanxi. Once these public bonds are issued, the Shanxi banknotes will definitely not be as sluggish as they are now, and the one-yuan surcharge will be canceled. As for the people's request to convert the arsenals into production facilities, I strongly agree, but a concrete plan must be drawn up before it can be implemented. As for the date of appointment of the provincial government committees, it has not yet been determined. (12th)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Lu Diping Resigns from His Positions as Chairman of Jiangxi Province and Commander-in-Chief <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>But the Central Government Still Tries to Persuade Him to Stay</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: When Lu Diping succeeded Zhu Peide as Chairman of Jiangxi Province two years ago, he believed that the 12th, 18th, 50th divisions could eliminate the bandits and communists without any problems. Therefore, in his declaration of office, he expected to govern Jiangxi within three months and achieve results. However, after the campaigns against Tang Shengzhi and Zhang Fakui, and the Northern Expedition, only one brigade of the 12th Division and two brigades of the 18th Division remained in Jiangxi. As a result, the Communist bandits became increasingly rampant. Almost all 81 counties were devastated, and the suffering was everywhere. There was not enough time to save the dying, so [missing character] political construction and autonomy could not be discussed. Lu had therefore telegraphed the Central Government last year to impeach himself and resign from the position of Chairman of Jiangxi Province. The National Government issued an order to persuade him to stay. When Ji'an was lost last year, Chairman Chiang came to Jiangxi to supervise the army. Lu again personally resigned to Chiang. At this time, Chiang said that Lu was responsible for the military affairs of suppressing bandits on the front line and could not change generals in the face of battle. Chiang greatly encouraged Lu. Lu then went to Ji'an again to command the military affairs. However, in the battles of Longgang and Dongshao last year, Lu's main forces, the 18th and 50th divisions, suffered heavy losses. Lu became even more heartbroken. He returned to the province from Ji'an on the 3rd of this month and went to Nanchang Hospital to recuperate. He never went to the provincial government. Later, the 77th Division found the head of Division Commander Zhang in the Ji'an River. Lu wept bitterly at the provincial funeral and felt completely disheartened. He immediately sent a handwritten note to the secretary's office and the accounting department to prepare for the handover. At the same time, he telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting permission to resign from the position of Chairman of Jiangxi Province and Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Route Army, so that he could rest. His resignation was very firm. However, it is heard that the Central Government still intends to persuade him to stay. In recent days, important official documents from the provincial government and the headquarters of the Ninth Route Army have still been sent to Nanchang Hospital for him to read. (12th)</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The swearing-in ceremony for Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, was originally scheduled for the 26th of last month. However, due to the fact that Zhang Honglie, Director of the Shandong Construction Department, who was entrusted by the Ministry of Railways to be the oath supervisor, was on official business in Beijing and could not come to Qingdao as scheduled, it was changed to 10 a.m. on the 11th. On that day, about several hundred representatives from all walks of life gathered in the hall of the bureau to observe the ceremony. Ge raised his left hand and took the oath. The oath said, "I solemnly swear that I will respect the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's will, obey the party's doctrine, abide by the laws, be loyal and diligent in my duties. I will never waste a penny, misuse a person, engage in corruption, or accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This oath." After the oath supervisor gave a speech, Mr. Ge gave a reply. Finally, Fang Zhi, a member of the city party headquarters, Hu Jiafeng, the secretary-general of the municipal government, and Ding Jingchen, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, spoke in succession. The ceremony was completed, photographs were taken, and the meeting was adjourned. (11th)</p>

However, in recent years, the owner has been withdrawing large sums of money, and the manager, Zhu Jiaxian, passed away last winter, resulting in a lack of management. After inventory, it was found that there was a deficit of over 10,000 yuan. After offsetting the inventory, it was still insufficient to cover the expenses. It has been agreed that the store will close after a major clearance sale on February 15th, and a separate inventory will be conducted.</p>
<p>Number of Flood Victims Along the River in Yingsheng Township: In Yingsheng Township along the river in Xiaoshan, villagers were affected by the floods last winter, with a total of over 3,950 mu of farmland being flooded. There are a total of 124 affected households, with 249 adult males and females and 248 children, resulting in losses of 20,000 gold yuan. The township office and preparatory office have prepared a disaster map and submitted it to the Fifth District Office, requesting the county government to quickly provide emergency relief to help the victims.</p>
<p>Eight Poor People in the Riverside Area Frozen and Starved to Death: In the Dongsha Riverside Township of Xiaoshan, the sand land of the local sand people has been repeatedly eroded by the river, resulting in the loss of all crops. During this time of great cold, the poor people have no clothes or food and are sitting and waiting to die, which is a very miserable situation. In the past few days, five people have been frozen to death and three have starved to death. District Chief Yu Bin of the Sixth District has telegraphed the provincial and county governments, requesting assistance.</p>
<p>The Xu Brothers Can Be Called Brothers in Trouble: Xu Naiguang, the village chief of Wutu Village in Taoyuan, Xiaoshan, was previously reported by the public for collecting excessive land reporting fees of 0.2 yuan per mu. After investigation by the provincial and county governments, the accusations were confirmed, and he was fined 200 yuan. At the same time, Xu Naicao, Xu Naiguang's brother, who is the magistrate of Suian County in Shandong Province, embezzled public funds of over 2,500 yuan. The Shandong Provincial Government has sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, ordering the Xiaoshan County Government to seal up his residence for compensation. The two brothers, one fined and the other having his property sealed, can be called brothers in trouble.</p>
<p>Merchants Robbed in Broad Daylight: Unbelievable: On the 13th, merchants collecting debts in the Keqiao area of Shaoxing were robbed on the road in Dongyun Qianqing Town. Because the road was muddy due to the heavy snow, they were stopped by five bandits who looked like soldiers. One bandit choked the merchant, while the other three robbed him of over 60 yuan in cash and a gold ring he was wearing. There were many passersby, but the area was close to the official road and there were few pedestrians, so they had to let them rob.</p>

<p>Yishengxiang Robbed on Shizijie: At 8:30 p.m. on the 9th, during a snowstorm, five bandits suddenly appeared at Yishengxiang Cloth Store, the most prosperous area of Shizijie North. Two bandits stood guard outside, while three bandits went inside, raised their pistols to threaten silence, and went straight into the shop, broke open the cash counter, and searched for over 160 silver dollars and over 20 paper dollars. Not satisfied, they broke open the clothing boxes of the shop assistants and searched them thoroughly before fleeing.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Letter from Former Yangzhong County Magistrate Xu Zusheng <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The news about Yangzhong County's political affairs published in your newspaper these days is not factual. I would like to briefly state the following: (1) Zusheng resigned due to overwork and repeatedly pleaded before being approved. Zusheng has been in charge of Yangzhong for two years and has a very good relationship with the people of Yangzhong. There was no matter of waiting at the wharf and not allowing him to leave. (2) Construction funds were collected and remitted immediately during Zusheng's tenure, and there was never any misappropriation. However, the collection of various outstanding amounts from the former Finance Bureau's collection staff has been ordered to be expedited, but has not yet been cleared. The successor can continue to handle it, and Zusheng has no responsibility to repay it. The Construction Department has not consulted the Civil Affairs Department to investigate the matter. (3) The Yangzhong Baojin Island rent has always been collected by the county government. Recently, it was ordered to be transferred to the Zhenjiang Education Bureau for collection, and it has been complied with. Although the transfer procedures are complicated, they have not yet been completed. The successor can continue to handle it, and the Education Department has not withheld or ordered him to stay in Yangzhong for handover. (4) On the 3rd of last month, the Second District Office reported the discovery of a female corpse. I immediately went to inspect it and interrogated the suspects in the county that night. The case file is accurate and not difficult to investigate. There was no matter of taking the opportunity to escape. In short, this time Zusheng's resignation and handover of Yangzhong County Magistrate has been approved, and all handover procedures have been done clearly and without any mistakes. I hereby request that you check and make corrections. Xu Zusheng. February 13th.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of independent education funding in Hunan Province, the Education Department of the province previously recommended representatives to come to Beijing to petition for it. Yesterday, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, He Jian, sent a cable to the Executive Yuan for the sake of education funding. The original telegram stated that Hunan Province's education funding relies solely on the salt tax surcharge of a small amount per bag of ocean salt, which is planned by the Finance Department. The Education Department has repeatedly submitted petitions and sent representatives to Beijing to petition for the implementation of a surcharge of 1.5 yuan per bag, approved by the Executive Yuan, to complete education independence and to allocate funds. The Finance Department is complying with the order to abolish the levy and has no ability to supplement education funding. Education is the foundation of construction, and funding is the lifeblood of education. It is feared that the future of education in Hunan Province will be considered and the approval of the surcharge will be completed to promote education, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Students of Zhongguo Public School Welcome the New Principal and School Board <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Drafting a Declaration of Support</p>
<p>The First Division of the Eighth District Sends a Telegram Urging the New Appointees to Take Office</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Education issued an order to appoint顾树森, 朱应鹏, 岑德彰 as special commissioners to take over Zhongguo Public School in Wusong, the commissioners convened a discussion meeting with the school board yesterday, reporting on the takeover process and discussing the aftermath of the school. The school board meeting resolved several measures and accepted the resignation of Principal Yu Youren on the spot, electing Shao Lizi as the principal, and additionally electing Chen Guofu, Shao Lizi, Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Yingpeng, and Wu Kaixian as members of the school board. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Although the students of the school have temporarily left the school in compliance with the order, most of them are staying with relatives and friends in Shanghai. Upon hearing this news, they expressed their welcome. They are currently drafting a declaration of support, which will be released in the near future. The First Division of the Eighth District of the Chinese Nationalist Party, which is attached to the university and whose members are all outstanding members of the school, is even more pleased about the school's future upon hearing the news of the new principal and school board. Yesterday, they sent a telegram expressing their welcome. The telegram reads: To Principal Shao Lizi and Members of the School Board Chen Guofu, Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Yingpeng, and Wu Kaixian: The students of Zhongguo Public School have always been complex. However, due to the missteps of the authorities, the flames of reaction have become rampant. After the student unrest broke out, Ma Junwu's intentional shielding even led to the delegation being able to hold everything back. The Party members of our branch were unjustly expelled and all the members of the branch were suppressed. After more than three months of turmoil, countless sacrifices have been made. The school is on the verge of danger, which is a change in education. The recollection is painful and unbearable to look back. It was recently reported that the school board has resolved to add all of you as members of the school board and to appoint Mr. Li Zi as the principal. In addition to hearing this, we are extremely happy. All of you are revolutionary leaders and famous figures in the academic community. We are sure that good measures will be taken to rectify and establish the school. The day of your appointment will be the time when the new life of Zhongguo Public School will be launched. We hereby send a telegram to welcome you and hope that you will take office as soon as possible. Sincerely, The First Division of the Eighth District of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Shanghai Special City.</p>

<p>Record Breaking Discovery</p>
<p>Approaching the 800 Tael Mark</p>
<p>Soaring Up 14 Taels and 4 Mace Yesterday, February 16th, during this major closing period for standard gold, new records were continuously set, having already broken through the 790 tael mark. The upward trend intensified and progressed very well. However, the intra-day rise did not exceed two or three taels. The exchange rate changed from loose to tight, with the listed price extended by half a block, indicating unclear and hidden conditions. Apparently, foreign firms were settling accounts, and market sentiment became stronger. Demand exceeded supply. Firms such as Yongfeng, Fuchang, Yuansheng, etc., all made purchases, while Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Yuanxing, Yongji, and others mostly sold off. This was likely due to overseas silver market reports rising in the previous day's telegrams, causing the gold price to be low early in the morning. Afterwards, buyers increased constantly, and the exchange rate improved. Especially due to widespread rumors that the Chinese government plans to establish a gold standard, or that it could be implemented in Liaoning. As a result, general speculators and merchants became enthusiastic and purchased aggressively. The market situation suddenly took off, rising sharply by more than ten taels, remarkably seeing a new peak of 796 taels again. Because of the usual custom, the market will be closed due to the New Year holiday. The market will be closed for the next two days (the 17th and 18th) and will resume normal business on the 19th.</p>
<p>The Atmosphere for a Gold Standard Intensifies From the opening of the April market at 777 taels and 5 mace in the morning, it decreased by 3 taels and 6 mace. Because the major silver bar from the previous day had already risen by six-eighths and the silver price had increased by one-fourth, private telegrams also increased by one-eighth, followed by 77 taels. Subsequently, due to purchases from Yong, etc., it immediately rose to 81 taels and 3 mace. Afterwards, there were occasional fluctuations of one or two taels, but Yuanmao, Yongshun, Wanxing, Yuanxing, Yong, etc., sold off, resulting in a depreciation of two taels. When the price was first announced, it was around 80 taels, and the exchange rate had already increased, calculated at 125 for British gold and 125 for American gold. Japanese gold decreased by 1 fen and 7.5 li, then retreated to 79 taels, 3 to 4 mace. However, internally it was quite different. Mitsui bought June 2 pence, and also did a three-month transaction with Korea for Citibank at $28.3125. In the market, Taikang, Runhong, Lizhi, Fengyong, etc., all made purchases, so the price progressed all the way, increasing by 5 to 6 taels. Later, British gold became tighter, and banks transacted at 1 penny and 875 li, driving the price up by 5 to 6 taels, reaching 91 taels. Yuanmao, Yong, etc., sold off, falling back by more than 3 taels. At 11 AM, it was calculated at 87 taels and a half. In the afternoon, it presented another peak. Yuancheng, Yuanheng, etc., successively competed to buy, and people's minds became more enthusiastic. The buying side was very strong, but there were very few sellers. As a result, the market atmosphere was extremely lively. The wind surged until noon, reaching 96 taels. However, from 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM, there were slight fluctuations of two or three taels. As it approached the close, it went back by one tael. When the market closed, it was calculated at 95 taels and a half, soaring by 14 taels and 4 mace compared to last Saturday. The spot price was 5 mace. The maximum price change during the half-day was 19 taels, and the minimum price was 77 taels. The spot price opened at 75 taels and closed at 95 taels. The price has been changed to 856 taels and 2 mace, calculated from 75 to 76 taels to 65 to 66 taels. At noon, it was only calculated at slightly over 60 taels. Registration was at 86 taels for February, 89 taels for March, 96 taels for April, and 86 taels for supplementary water.</p>
<p>Transaction Volume Not Large as Usual Due to the holiday season, there were no excessively large transactions among various firms. Yongfeng, Yuansheng, Taikangrun, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, etc., all made purchases. Futaiheng, Changxiang, Yuantai, Shunli, Wanxing occasionally bought and sold. Yuanmao was the top seller, with approximately one thousand several hundred bars. Changshengyong and scattered households sold slightly. The Dalian gang had a total of more than 12 million, breaking even. The Guang gang had a small number of transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Exchange Rate Listing Lengthened <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Internal Trading Tight · · Many Account Settlements</p>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC listed exchange rates were lengthened by half a block, due to the report of rising silver prices in British and American banks the previous day. British gold was lengthened by 125, calculated as 1 penny and 175 li for the first order. American gold was only lengthened by 125, calculated as 27 yuan and 75 cents. Indian exchange increased by 75, calculated as 77 rupees. French francs increased by 6 yuan, calculated as 710 yuan. German exchange increased by 1 yuan, calculated as 117 marks. Japanese and foreign currency increased by half a yuan, calculated as 69 guilders and 25 cents. Singapore exchange decreased by 1 tael and 7 mace and 5 li, calculated as 202 taels. Hong Kong remained the same, calculated as 78 taels and a half. However, the internal trading situation of the banks was tightening, likely because importers and British and American tobacco firms were settling accounts. Standard gold turned from weak to strong. During this major closing period, a new high price of 796 taels, which had never been reached before, actually occurred, breaking the previous record, and 800 taels is right in front of us. This is truly due to the general public's extremely high expectations regarding the rumored change to a gold standard. Demand exceeds supply, and therefore the exchange market is even more sharp. By the noon closing, British gold decreased by 125, American gold decreased by 25, and Japanese gold increased by 1 fen and a half compared to last Saturday. The external and internal trading conditions were truly different. Chinese firms such as Fuchang, etc., slightly dumped British gold, totaling about 100,000 pounds. Banks such as Mitsui and Zhejiang Industrial all absorbed. Yufengyong has already settled with Mitsui, etc., and various firms have transacted several tens of thousands of pounds with each other. Also, American gold was transacted between parties for over 100,000 yuan. Also, Fuchang, etc., sold 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to Mitsui, which is a hedging strategy. However, there was very little Japanese gold trading, because the hedging was not agreeable. Since the gold market will be closed in the afternoon, there will be no substantial trading. It is said that the major silver bars may see a decline tonight.</p>
<p>British Exchange The internal trading had a change of 1875. In the morning, the opening price for near and far term trading was approximately 1 shilling and 2 pence, with a buying price of 2 pence and 0625. Subsequently, it tightened. Korea traded 10,000 pounds of current period with Dalian, the same for 2 pence. Meifeng traded 10,000 with Zhejiang for March, the same price. (Fuchang sold) Then Zhejiang bought 10,000 for June, same price, (Fuchang sold). Then bought 10,000 for April, price 1 penny and 9375, and 5,000 for May, same price. Mitsui and Anda mutually traded 10,000 for February, price 875. Huayi traded with HSBC for 1,000 for April, price 875. Mitsui sold 10,000, same price. (Yufengyong bought).

<h3 id="e77">Confused Foreign Cents, Silver Discounts Not Opened <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Great New Year's Eve of Customary Tradition... The silver and money industry generally announces the grand closing. Yesterday, during the grand comparison period of the abolished lunar New Year (namely, commonly known as the Great New Year's Eve), the silver and money industry's busy and complex procedures for collection, delivery, and various closing procedures were beyond comparison. Therefore, the situation was extremely chaotic. Due to customary traditions, there were constant rules that no one paid attention to, resulting in generally unlimited transactions and market prices in the market. Foreign cents rose and fell suddenly, also without any order. The early market was 7 mace, 2 fen, and 2 li, a decrease of 3 li compared to the previous day's noon market. The noon market suddenly rebounded by 1 li, calculated as 7 mace, 7 fen, and 3 li. In the exchange of foreign currency, the early market for exchange drafts was 1,245,000, and the noon market was 1,120,000. For banknotes, the early market was 20,000, and the noon market was 10,000. Outside the market, the early market for banknotes was 255,000, and the noon market was 170,000. In the bank's trading, inter-bank trading in the early market was 800,000, and the noon market was 1,200,000. Because yesterday had already announced the grand closing, discount ticket transactions were completely stopped, so the price was not opened. In the market situation of subsidiary coins, the early market for Jiangnan small silver coins was 6 mace, 6 fen, and 5 li, and the noon market was the same price, also 6 mace, 6 fen, and 5 li. The early market for transactions was 3,500 jiao, and the noon market was 2,500 jiao. The early market for Guangdong small silver coins was 6 mace, 8 fen, and 8 li, and the noon market was 6 mace and 8 fen, with a difference of 8 li between the morning and noon markets. Transactions in the early market were 45,000 jiao, and the noon market was 120,000 jiao. Copper coins were changed to 7,000 and increased to 347,000 wen.</p>

<p>The Atmosphere Seems to Carry a Cotton Famine Color</p>
<p>Manpower is Inflated, Rising Around 30 Taels Since the New Year's Day start for standard yarn, prices have been gradually increasing. Each price has increased by about 30 taels compared to the end of last year. The initial cause of this intense price increase was the National Government's reform of the unified cotton yarn tax, driving actual sales. Various gangs bought about 70,000 to 80,000 bales, emptying out bottom stocks and strengthening manufacturers' attitudes. Coupled with the golden tide surging and the silver price falling miserably, foreign cotton could not be imported. The related yarn market was difficult to ease fundamentally, making people's minds more determined. The intentions of a certain industrialist were particularly strong, absorbing a considerable amount. The raw material prices for the shorts were soaring, presenting unstable conditions. The market situation became increasingly high. Although several factories hedged before the market closed, it was still difficult to reduce the buying trend. The day traders were the most numerous among the shorts. During the most intense price increase, the two major security deposit households dissolved over a million taels. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the future. The total turnover of manpower on both the buying and selling sides of the exchange was 212,350 bales. The net turnover by the bullish manpower was 74,950 bales. February was 21,550 bales, March was 42,550 bales, April was 50,200 bales, May was 45,250 bales, June was 40,200 bales, and July was 11,700 bales. The amount of our manpower trading on both sides will be listed separately below.</p>

<p>Hankou Cotton Prices Surge 10 Taels The situation of the Hankou standard cotton futures price rising 10 taels compared to last year is rare. It is actually due to the blow of exchange rates, the miserable fall in silver prices, and the crazy rise in gold prices. The calculation of Indian cotton is extremely expensive in silver, making it difficult to import. The cotton produced in our own country is not sufficient to supply. Foreign cotton cannot be purchased, so speculators absorb a large amount, and the market rapidly rises. Before the market closes, it is very likely that there will be a cotton famine. The terror of the shorts reaches its peak. However, the world produces a lot, but exchange rates do not ease, making it difficult to come in. Therefore, the buyers' morale is firm. The Japanese firm Toyo buys about 70,000 to 80,000 piculs. The general retail investors follow suit. The most sellers are from the Hankou gang, and the losses are huge. The future of the cotton market is difficult to predict. In short, the bottom stock is thin, and the exchange market is not long, with no fundamental flaws. The total turnover of the exchange is 470,800 piculs. The net volume of both the bullish and bearish manpower is 191,600 piculs. February is 45,700 piculs, March is 93,500 piculs, April is 89,100 piculs, May is 117,500 piculs, June is 81,100 piculs, and July is 36,900 piculs.

<p>Kong Xiangxi Told Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Kong Will Go to Shanxi for Inspection Within a Week</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Industry Minister Kong Xiangxi at his private residence on West Adams Road yesterday afternoon. Secretary Wang received the reporter. The reporter asked Mr. Kong about his departure date for Shanxi. According to Secretary Wang, Mr. Kong is scheduled to go to Shanxi from Beijing within the week (i.e., this week). Along the way, he will go to Tianjin and Beijing, where he will stay briefly to inspect industry. As for Zhao Shouyu, the Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi, he will not travel with Mr. Kong because he has been appointed as an advisor by the General Headquarters. Only a few secretaries and attendants will accompany Mr. Kong. The reporter then asked, (1) Recently, newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have widely reported on the activities of the Soviet Union in Shanghai, resuming commercial institutions, and the Beijing newspapers have also reported on it in detail, stating that the three departments are planning a solution. (2) It was previously heard that industrial bonds would be issued for 15 million to handle major industries such as sugar factories, textile factories, and sulfuric acid factories, but there has been no progress recently. This is a common inquiry to Minister Kong. Secretary Wang then conveyed Mr. Kong's words, stating that the government is comprehensively planning the Sino-Russian trade issue. Since Representative Mo of the Sino-Russian negotiations returned to China and arrived in Beijing, he has repeatedly consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Although this matter is related to the Ministry of Industry, it must wait for the government to determine a comprehensive plan. The issuance of industrial bonds was two years ago, and there has been no progress recently.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Greatly Need National Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association previously organized an inspection delegation to the Southeast Asian Islands and appointed Zhou Guojun as its leader. All delegation members have now returned to China, but Mr. Zhou remains in Shantou due to other matters. Yesterday, Mr. Zhou sent a long letter to the association, reporting on the trip and his impressions. His report is highly relevant to promoting national goods. The following is a telegraphic transcription of the original text:</p>
<p>Respectfully, I, Zhou Guojun, was publicly appointed by your association as the leader of the Southeast Asia Inspection Delegation. Together with the delegation members, we sailed south for three months. Departing from Shanghai and passing through Hong Kong and French Indochina, we arrived in Singapore on November 20th of last year. We entered the Malay States and reached ____. On December 23rd, we went to ____, and on the 28th, we returned to ____ and then went to the Dutch East Indies, Sumatra and Java. On January 15th of this year, we first returned to Singapore and then came back to China. In addition to a detailed report to be submitted upon my return to Shanghai, I would like to briefly present my observations regarding the promotion of national products.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian Islands are located in the tropics, with a warm climate and abundant resources. Due to historical and geographical relations with our country, there are approximately five million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, who are hardworking, resilient, diligent, and frugal. They are the leaders of the Southeast Asian industry and control the economic lifeline. While foreigners are also adept at selling local products, the distribution of imported goods within the region is impossible without the participation of the overseas Chinese. The social life of the overseas Chinese is largely the same as in China. Although there are some who forget their origins, most still retain their ancestral customs and habits. Therefore, the demand for national goods is extremely high.</p>
<p>The patriotism and enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia for using national goods have long been recognized by the people of China. If China's industry is developed enough to meet the needs of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and other ethnic groups, and if we improve our products and promote them effectively, the prospects are limitless. Last year, the price of local products plummeted, an unprecedented event. Bankruptcies were frequently reported, and unemployment increased daily. However, due to the backwardness of the colonial economy and the low standard of living, most daily necessities are imported from abroad. The goods consumed are mostly necessities rather than valuable luxury items. Therefore, even in the midst of panic and weak purchasing power, it is still impossible to stop consumption. Furthermore, the appreciation of gold and the depreciation of silver, coupled with the commendable enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for using national goods, mean that the promotion of national goods in Southeast Asia will not be greatly affected by the decline in trade and will instead present an excellent opportunity for promotion.</p>
<p>The main reasons for the sluggish trade between China and Southeast Asia are twofold: (1) China is still in the position of supplying raw materials to others, and (2) the content of life in overseas Chinese society is not entirely the same as in China, and domestic manufacturers have failed to adapt to their needs and provide appropriate supplies. Therefore, apart from food and agricultural products, the quality of manufactured national goods entering Southeast Asia is only barely satisfactory. Thus, miscellaneous goods account for the largest share of sales. There are countless varieties of miscellaneous goods, the most popular in the market being mountain products such as bamboo, clothing, bamboo chairs, and other utensils; raw oil, grains, incense, paper materials, seafood, tea, utensils, fresh fruits, and vegetables are also abundant. As for manufactured national goods, apart from cigarettes, towels, threads, socks, and clothing, which are occasionally sold to natives or other ethnic communities, the rest are mainly consumed by millions of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Foreigners use political means to carry out economic aggression, with the former preceding the latter. China has vast land and abundant resources, but unfortunately, we cannot extract them effectively. Our industry is backward, and we are far behind others. In order to break the deadlock, we hope that compatriots at home and abroad will revitalize industry, improve products, use our patriotic and wealthy overseas Chinese as a backing, promote Sino-Southeast Asian commerce, develop foreign trade, and work together towards this goal. Our export trade to Southeast Asia will undoubtedly increase day by day. This can be stated with certainty. I am sending this preliminary report, and I will continue to report in detail in the future.</p>

<p>Collection of Membership Fees to Have a Basis</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to 67 trade associations, including the yarn industry, rice shops, shipping industry, silk factories, and clothing industry, as well as store members, stating:</p>
<p>In accordance with the Chamber's articles of association, membership fees should be collected based on the total capital of each member. Therefore, each member should report their total capital in advance and then pay membership fees in accordance with the regulations. The Chamber has already issued a notice setting a deadline for reporting. While many members have reported and paid their fees on time, there are also many who have failed to do so by the deadline. The Chamber's expenses are funded by membership fee income. Without the reported capital of each member, the Chamber cannot collect membership fees, which hinders the Chamber's operations. All trade associations are members of the Chamber and should fulfill their membership obligations. It is inappropriate to ignore the urging of the Chamber. Therefore, it was decided at the 31st Standing Committee meeting on the 12th of this month to extend the deadline to the end of February. All members must report their total capital and pay their membership fees by then. This letter serves as a final reminder. Please report to the Chamber on time and do not delay further. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Anti-Opium Society Petitions Central Government to Stop Opium Public Sale <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Public Sale Not Without Cause</p>
<p>Should Be Strictly Prohibited</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society believes that rumors of opium public sale have been circulating widely recently. It has joined forces with various related organizations to strongly protest, as previously reported. The other day, the Honorary Chairman of the Society, Tang Shaochuan, convened a meeting of the Standing Committee to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to petition the Central Government and instruct the National Anti-Opium Bureau to effectively ban opium and other drugs, and to instruct local party branches to prohibit the promotion of opium public sale, in order to emphasize the prohibition of opium. The original petition is quoted below:</p>
<p>Petition for the strict prohibition of opium and the prevention of public sale based on the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>The evils of opium are endless. The late Premier's anti-opium teachings stated that opium business is absolutely incompatible with the national government authorized by the people. He also said that anyone who advocates legalizing opium business is a public enemy of the people, and any responsible government agency that abandons the fight against opium for its own private interests is an act of treason. The KMT's platform has clear provisions for the prohibition of opium. Our Society follows the teachings of the late Premier and adheres to the Party's platform to launch anti-opium movements. Fortunately, with the completion of the Northern Expedition, we promoted the government's implementation of a prohibition policy.</p>
<p>Recently, however, we have received rumors that the anti-opium authorities are changing the policy of complete prohibition and are now preparing to implement a national public sale system. Although the Central Anti-Opium Committee has stated that this is inaccurate, rumors are rife, with many claiming to have solid evidence. It is said that a certain foreign adviser at the Jianghai Customs is drafting regulations for the public sale of opium under the commission of a certain authority, with the sole purpose of raising funds, with an estimated annual income of 80 to 100 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance has also sent Li Jihong, who was most active in handling opium public sale in the past, to Taiwan to investigate the local opium public sale system in preparation for imitation, causing opposition from the local overseas Chinese. Liu Ruiheng, the current Chairman of the Central Anti-Opium Committee, did not explicitly deny this in an interview with the Mainichi Shimbun reporter. Moreover, Li Jihong, who went to Taiwan to investigate public sale, and Wu Liande, who openly advocated public sale, have both been formally appointed as members of the Central Anti-Opium Committee. Thus, the anti-opium authorities are already taking steps to adopt a public sale policy.</p>
<p>The National Government has clearly promulgated a policy of absolute prohibition of opium, which is known throughout the country and abroad. Although the policy has not been fully implemented in recent years, such as the special opium tax in Hunan and Hubei, the open sale of land in Guangdong and Guangxi, and the cultivation of opium in Sichuan, Fujian, Yunnan, and Guizhou, which have been criticized by the people, the policy of complete prohibition should not be wavered. If the anti-opium authorities act inconsistently and recognize opium as a legally permitted business, it would not only violate the previously promulgated anti-opium law, but also violate the KMT's platform, international treaties, and the teachings of the late Premier.</p>
<p>Our Society is dedicated to promoting the wishes of the people and considers it our duty to oppose this disastrous policy, which endangers the country and harms the people. At the recent Fourth Plenary Session, Party and government officials reiterated the decision to strictly ban opium. If public sale is implemented, the reputation of the country and the livelihood of the people will be unimaginable. Our Society feels deeply threatened and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we respectfully submit this petition, urging the Central Government to instruct the National Anti-Opium Bureau to effectively ban opium and other drugs, to order the abolition of the special tax offices in Hunan and Hubei, as well as the public sale bureaus in Guangdong and Guangxi, and to strictly prohibit the promotion of opium public sale by instructing party branches at all levels throughout the country, in order to rectify public opinion and safeguard the Party's platform. At the same time, we request that anti-opium work be made a priority for all local party branches in order to attract public attention and increase the strength of opium prohibition. We urgently submit this petition and hope for your understanding.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Letter from Wu Liande to the Anti-Opium Society <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Liande sent a letter yesterday to the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, stating:</p>
<p>I have learned that your Society included my name on the list of executive committee members without first obtaining my consent. I believe that everyone shares the same concern for anti-opium affairs, and this aligns with my own long-held aspirations. Therefore, I did not hold you responsible for your presumptuous action. However, since then, I have not received any notification from your Society regarding any internal or external affairs, and I only see my name listed on various documents. I believe that all the other esteemed gentlemen listed are prominent figures of our time, and the matters they are involved in are of concern to everyone.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been concerned about the spread of opium and narcotics, which not only harms China but is also spreading globally. I have also been asked by well-intentioned people at home and abroad to propose thorough measures for opium prohibition for everyone to discuss. Overwhelmed by grief, how could I refuse to contribute my efforts? Therefore, based on my decades of experience, I published an article titled "The Extremely Harmful Opium Problem," which is purely my personal opinion for the people of China to study and consider. It does not represent the position of any organization or group, nor is it intended to be submitted to the authorities. It is simply one opinion on a problem that everyone should study, with the aim of completely eliminating opium and ending the futile rhetoric that allows opium to flourish. I never expected that your Society would misunderstand me and falsely accuse me of advocating opium public sale.</p>
<p>I have long regarded opium, a harmful substance that has severely harmed our country, as the greatest shame and enemy of the Chinese nation. Therefore, I have devoted decades to studying the problem of opium prohibition. I cannot guarantee the correctness of my views, but I am certainly not engaging in empty rhetoric or hiding ulterior motives to seek advancement. To achieve factual results, one cannot simply stare straight ahead but must first calmly study all practical methods. Moreover, my article does not contain a single word about public sale. I do not know where your Society obtained the statement "Wu Liande openly advocates the implementation of opium public sale in the newspapers." I am afraid that this is based on misinformation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met Mr. Tang Shaochuan, whom your Society calls the Honorary Chairman. He said that he was initially invited to attend the temporary Standing Committee meeting on the 13th, but he declined. Then, the Secretary-General of your Society, Mr. Huang Jiaohui, and two or three others moved to his residence for a tea party. Mr. Huang made many unfair remarks, giving the impression of restricting my freedom of speech. Mr. Tang repeatedly corrected him, indicating his dissatisfaction with Mr. Huang's words and actions. Later, I saw in various newspapers that "Honorary Chairman Tang so-and-so" had discussed and decided on seven or eight proposals.</p>
<p>The purpose of your Society is anti-opium. I am grateful for the support of all sectors of society. However, how can someone as inexperienced as Mr. Huang turn good intentions into a constant blame? Alas, I have served the motherland for nearly thirty years and have spent just as long studying the opium problem. Due to other responsibilities, I have been unable to devote myself entirely to anti-opium efforts. Even basic measures, such as establishing opium addiction treatment hospitals to provide opium addicts with the opportunity to quit, have not yet been established. Powerful individuals continue to cultivate and sell opium, and we are powerless to stop them. Large sums of money are spent on anti-opium efforts, but opium continues to spread throughout the country. I ask myself, can I not feel ashamed? I have the heart to serve the country, but my temples have turned white. However, I dare not show weakness. However, everyone has their own ambitions, and I cannot force them to agree with me. If someone like the formidable Mr. Huang Jiaohui is going to be like this, how can I dare to associate with him again?</p>
<p>Therefore, I am writing to inform you that your Society is not allowed to use my name as an executive committee member from now on, in order to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Wu Liande</p>

<p>Regarding the Business Tax Case</p>
<p>The Municipal Committee on Tax Regulations for Various Industries sent a letter yesterday to various trade associations, including the fur industry, cotton cloth industry, and seafood industry, stating:</p>
<p>We have received your letter and, after gathering and studying the results, we propose that the business tax rate should not exceed two per thousand, unless otherwise stipulated by the government to be below two per thousand. The wholesale portion should still be taxed at one-quarter of the rate, and the collection should be handled in a simple and straightforward manner in order to eliminate harassment. Zhuangke who do not engage in buying or selling activities should be exempt from business tax to avoid double taxation.</p>
<p>On February 7th, we sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be forwarded for review and handling. On February 14th, we sent a telegram directly to the Ministry of Finance, requesting strict correction when amending the business tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The full text of these letters is published in the local newspapers of February 7th and 15th, which we hope you have seen. If the above proposals can achieve their intended purpose, then the various points raised in your letter will be resolved easily.</p>
<p>This letter serves as a reply, and we hope that your association will continue to contribute its views so that we can gather and study them and submit them to the financial authorities for adoption.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>To the Trade Associations of the Fur Industry, Copper and Tin Industry, Silk Fabric Industry, Western Clothing Industry, Candle Industry, ____ Industry, Ham Industry, Firecracker Industry, Cosmetic Industry, Leather and Grass Goods Industry, Paint Industry, Liang Shaojiu Industry, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Embroidery Industry, Seafood and Grocery Industry, Egg Industry, Fur Industry, and New Medicine Industry</p>

<p>Previously Suspended for Several Days Due to Cold Weather</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hankou aviation service of China National Aviation Corporation was previously suspended for several days due to heavy snow in the Yangtze River area. According to news from the airline, the Shanghai-Hankou aviation service has now resumed. Yesterday was Monday, the usual day of rest. Flights will resume as usual today.</p>
<h3 id="e94">News from the Transportation Sector <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Trains, Buses, and Trams Operate as Usual: Today is the abolished Lunar New Year's Day, which has been ordered to be abolished by the government authorities. According to news from the transportation sector yesterday, trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines will operate as usual, and the timetable will remain the same. The public bus company and tram company, fearing that drivers and ticket sellers would be attached to the old customs and ask for leave under false pretenses, posted a notice yesterday stating that no leave would be granted for the abolished Lunar New Year's Day. Those who ask for leave for one day under false pretenses will have two days' wages deducted.</p>
<p>Huashang Third Route Tram Reduces Prices Yesterday: The Huashang Tram Company's third route circular tram, which operates around the city, has been convenient for citizens since its launch. At the same time, the French Tram Company's third route tram also operates on the Route to China of the French Concession from Xiaodongmen to Laoximen. However, the Huashang Tram Company's business on this route has been taken over by the French Tram Company. Yesterday (the 16th), due to the end of the abolished Lunar New Year, citizens traveled to and from shopping, and the trams were very crowded. Extra trips were added, operating from 6:00 AM to 1:00 AM, and the fares for these trams were reduced for one day. First-class tickets were priced the same as second-class tickets.</p>
<p>Huashang Public Bus Fourth Route Postponed: The Zhabei Huashang Public Bus Company previously planned to open a fourth bus route, starting from the Baoshan Road intersection to the area of Jungong Road and Xiangyin Road, directly to Shanghai University, passing through Chizhi University and Fudan University, to facilitate transportation for all sectors. The company submitted its proposed plan and fare schedule to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for review. Yesterday afternoon, the company received instructions from the Municipal Public Works Bureau to postpone the review.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Severe Cold in North China Hinders Shipping Again <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Freezes for the Second Time: The Baihe River in Tianjin was blocked by ice during the severe cold last month, trapping more than 20 ships bound for Tianjin from Shanghai and other ports. It took more than a week for them to break free. Recently, the Baihe River was gradually thawing, and Shanghai-bound Chinese ships were planning to resume service. However, news arrived that since the 14th, the cold in Tianjin and Dagukou had increased sharply, and the Baihe River had frozen for the second time, even more severely than before. Sixteen or seventeen ships in the harbor were unable to sail and were trapped by the ice. Recently, ships from Shanghai to Tianjin have been able to reach only 20 miles outside Tanggu before dropping anchor. Passengers and cargo are transferred to small boats for landing. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Beiyang service has been postponed again.</p>
<p>Qinhuangdao Also Closed: Qinhuangdao does not usually freeze, so the port is not closed. However, due to the severe cold this time, Qinhuangdao has also frozen, the port has been closed, and shipping routes have been blocked. The Kailan Mining Administration's coal, which is usually unloaded there, has also been blocked and cannot be shipped out. The Shanghai office received a telegram yesterday and announced that it has stopped selling coal. It must wait until the ice thaws before it can be transported to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Shipping Industry Breaks with Lunar New Year Shutdown <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>This year, the national calendar is being strictly implemented, breaking with the tradition of shutting down during the Lunar New Year. The suspension of service by various commercial ships varies. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Yangtze River Ships: British Taikoo Dockyard Yangtze River ships have suspended service since yesterday and will resume service on the 20th. The Japanese Gonghe Wheel will change to sail out tomorrow. The Japanese Qing Company will close for one day today and resume normal service tomorrow. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sanbei Company, etc., will suspend service due to repairs or lack of cargo and will resume normal service starting next week.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Ships: Ningbo ships like the New Beijing have already stopped sailing. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ning Shao will not stop sailing. Yesterday, the New Ning Shao exported only 160 pieces of cargo from Ningbo, earning only 70 taels in freight, and there were very few passengers. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sanbei service today will probably go to Ningbo empty.</p>
<p>Zhehai Ships: Most of the six Zhehai ships to Shantou have stopped sailing. Recently, they have been busy increasing the escort fleet and passenger tickets. The six companies have agreed to resume service on the 20th. The Tongyang Wheel will also stop service for one day today and resume service tomorrow.</p>
<p>Inland River Ships: The inland river ships on the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou-Hangzhou-Huzhou routes stopped service early. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's small ships also planned to close for five days. After receiving an official letter from the Social Affairs Bureau, they were not allowed to suspend service without authorization. The six inland river ship companies reached a compromise at a meeting the day before. During this suspension period, the six companies will cooperate and operate one ship each day. Even if it is empty, the loss will be small, in order to comply with government orders and show that they are strictly implementing the national calendar.</p>

If gatherings for gambling or suspension of business under false pretenses are discovered, they will cooperate with the local authorities to stop them at any time.</p>

<p>The holding of paper horse races by foreigners in the Chinese countryside was originally ordered to be prohibited by our government officials. However, recently, foreigners have continued to hold them in the area south of Shanghai, causing damage to agricultural products. Farmers in the second district of the county reported the loss of agricultural products to the district office. After investigation, the district office confirmed that the damage to agricultural products from the recent paper horse racing by foreigners amounted to nearly ten thousand yuan. Therefore, a list was prepared and submitted to the Shanghai County Government, requesting strict prohibition and compensation for the losses. Yesterday, the district head received an order from the county government, stating that since there is evidence of damage to agricultural products from paper horse racing by foreigners, negotiations should be initiated. A detailed report should be prepared on the location and acreage of the damaged farmland and bridges and submitted to the county government for review.</p>

<p>Normal Service Today</p>
<p>Due to the recent high prices of goods, the various shipping companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo line previously held a joint meeting and decided to slightly increase the fares for passengers and freight starting tomorrow (the 18th).

<p>The labor strike at the Japanese-owned China Metal Can Manufacturing Factory on Jixiang Road in Hongkou has lasted for a long time.

<h3 id="e107">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Reports a Dispute in the Organization of the Woodworking and Painting Industries <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>No Mediation Possible</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday reported to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Training Committee regarding an organizational dispute between the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry and the Painting Industry, stating that: "The report is in response to the case. On January 16th of this year, Order No. 5802 from the Social Affairs Bureau stated that, according to a report from the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry Association, the Painting Industry Association had sent people to woodworking shops to solicit membership, requesting correction and attaching the association's constitution and a solicitation for membership, etc. According to this, whether the claims made by each are true or not concerns an industrial dispute, and it is appropriate to examine and submit a report. You are hereby ordered to comply, promptly investigate and clarify, and report the situation impartially. Attached is the original report, the constitution, and the solicitation for membership. The association received these documents and, on January 30th, the Civil Training Committee also instructed the association to promptly dispatch personnel to investigate and mediate and report the situation. After receiving the instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau, the association immediately dispatched personnel to investigate. According to the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry Association, the 'paoli shui bang' who join the painting industry are distinct from Western-style woodworking shops in terms of workshops. The so-called internal woodworking dowry shops are painting workshops attached to Chinese-style woodworking shops. A woodworking shop must have a painting workshop attached, and its participation in a group should follow the guidance of the main body. When asked how many woodworking shops had joined, they claimed that there were 29 Western-style woodworking shops and a few Chinese-style woodworking shops. According to the Painting Industry Association, the association was initiated and built by sign painters, exterior painters of ships, and interior painters of wooden dowries. In the 23rd year of Guangxu, painters of automobiles and carriages joined after donating funds. In the 8th year of the Republic of China, painters of round objects joined. In the 10th year of the Republic of China, painters of small objects and other six groups joined, forming the association. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce convened representatives from the six groups, donated funds to purchase a base in southern Shanghai, and reported to the former Shanghai County, which issued a proclamation. Since being ordered to reorganize, the so-called Chinese and Western woodworking shops have all been included. When asked how many woodworking shops had joined, they claimed that almost all Chinese-style woodworking shops and fewer than ten Western-style woodworking shops had joined. Given the situations of the two industries as described above, the association convened representatives from both industries to come to the association on January 29th to listen to mediation. At that time, the painting industry, due to past historical relationships, insisted on merging the organizations. The Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry, however, refused to merge, citing the different main bodies and different natures. The association then proposed mediation opinions, stating that, in terms of business nature, the painting industry is a type of engineering that processes and manufactures goods sold. It cannot include the main body of its own industry. Therefore, Chinese and Western woodworking shops should join the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry Association. However, the painting industry has assets, and part of them were purchased with donations from the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry. Forcing them to leave the painting industry and join the woodworking industry would not benefit either side and would only cause disputes. Since only three Chinese-style woodworking shops have joined the Woodworking Industry Association, and fewer than ten Western-style woodworking shops have joined the Painting Industry Association, it would be better to directly rename the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry Association as the Western-style Woodworking Industry Association, transfer the three Chinese-style woodworking shops that have joined the association to the Painting Industry Association, and allow the paoli shui bang members and Western-style woodworking shops that have joined the Painting Industry Association to join the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry Association within a certain period. Otherwise, if, as the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry claims, every woodworking shop must have a painting workshop attached, then the painting part should join the Painting Industry Association, and the woodworking part should join the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry Association in order to resolve the issue. After discussion, neither industry adopted the mediation method, and the meeting adjourned without results. Later, the Civil Training Committee ordered the association to investigate, mediate, and report the case. The association then scheduled another mediation for February 10th. Unexpectedly, at that time, the Chinese and Western Woodworking Industry Association submitted a letter stating that, although they had been convened, there would be no good results, and refused to attend. Given the situation, the association believes that there is no possibility of further mediation. The association hereby submits a report on the handling of the case in accordance with the instructions to your bureau for review. Regarding the two mediation methods proposed by the association, whether they can be adopted for future reference in resolving this case awaits your decision."</p>

<p>Submitting to the Two Bureaus for Adoption</p>
<p>River bandits on the Huangpu River have always been rampant. The Municipal Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus have jointly issued proclamations, strictly ordering their suppression. However, the river bandits are bold and reckless, paying lip service and acting in defiance. The Municipal Hotel Industry Association convened a joint meeting on the 5th with the hotel members who hire outer river receptionists, who are more closely related to this matter, and discussed the matter repeatedly and seriously, resolving on four fundamental measures: (1) Limit the registration of rowing boats and strictly investigate illegal activities; (2) Set fixed passenger fares and strictly prohibit extortion; (3) Detain the ringleaders and sign repentance pledges; (4) Plant signs at each wheel pier, stipulating the prices for porters to carry luggage, prohibiting collusion and fraud, and excessive solicitation of tips. They also submitted detailed measures, requesting the Municipal Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to find ways to adopt and actively suppress them to reassure travelers. It is reported that the two bureaus have sent personnel to consult in order to adopt and implement them.</p>

<p>A blind child, about six years old, abandoned by a woman surnamed Lu at No. 11 Xinlu Inn, North Railway Station, Kene Road, was sent to the Special District Court by the Shanghai Municipal Police. The Fifth Court issued a judgment to the Women and Children's Relief Association for temporary care, which in turn requested the China Child Welfare Association to adopt the child. Wang Guanyi, a staff member of the association's Protection Department, inquired in detail about the child's origin at the Special District Court and went to the China Women and Children's Relief Association in Jiangwan to inspect the child's situation. As the child is currently unable to walk, it is inconvenient to send him to a school for the blind for training (some of the children rescued by the association are blind and are fostered at the Shanghai School for the Blind for education, which is very convenient). Therefore, they consulted with the China Women and Children's Relief Association and requested that the child remain in foster care until he is able to move, and then the Child Welfare Association will provide education on his behalf.</p>

<p>With the Help of Li Heng and Others</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Association previously found the doctor registration in the French Concession to be quite troublesome. They drafted opinions and sent a letter to the French Concession Health Department for adoption and amendment. Yesterday, representatives Liu Liheng, Ding Jiaohua, and Jiang Wenfang contacted the department and were received by General Manager Ai Jun. The representatives explained their intentions, and Ai Jun replied that the association's intentions were clear. Regarding the three points presented, the board of directors would discuss them and give a satisfactory reply. The representatives then requested that, as the regulations were just beginning to be implemented, the industry was not yet clear about them, and it seemed unfair to impose penalties hastily. In addition to requesting a prompt reply to the points presented by the association, the enforcement should not be enforced again within a reasonable period. Also, as the association is a formal legal entity in Shanghai, and all members are formal national doctors, if registration is required, could the association be entrusted to submit the documents? Ai Jun replied that if they were indeed members of the association and had proof, the association could submit the documents on their behalf. As for the enforcement period, it would be postponed until May 1st, and penalties would be waived before that date. The representatives then took their leave. It is also reported that the general manager has notified all police stations to investigate the suspension of penalties before May 1st.</p>

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Receives Reply from Beiping Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously received a letter from Chen Taoan published in the Shishi News, explaining the methods for relieving and preventing coal gas poisoning, and stating that the Beiping Public Security Bureau had a good formula for relieving coal gas poisoning. The bureau then sent a letter to the Beiping Public Security Bureau to inquire. The bureau has now replied, stating that the method for relieving coal gas poisoning is currently under research and has not yet been tested. However, the common methods used in the north for relieving coal gas poisoning are: when someone feels the effects of coal gas early on, quickly carry the patient out of the courtyard and quickly irrigate them with hot cabbage soup or diluted grape juice. At the same time, artificial respiration can be used to restore consciousness. For Western medicine, ammonia water can be used to sniff under the patient's nose several times. As for prevention, before sleeping, the coal stove should be carried out of the courtyard, windows should be opened to circulate air, and the coal stove should not be placed in the bedroom with the windows tightly closed.</p>

<p>Zhu Dachang Stabbed</p>
<p>Four Robbers Flee After Robbery</p>
<p>Zhu Dachang, a bill collector for the China Textile Company, a native of Ningbo, 34 years old, residing at No. 29 Xujiahui Road, Shanghai West, collected 269 yuan in notes from the Jinfeng Silk Store on Ningbo Road yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM. He then walked out, turned into Henan Road, crossed the Pentang Lane Bridge, and went straight to the Huacheng Silk Store in Dean Lane, North Shanxi Road to collect debts. The store's accountant was not present, and a colleague told him to come back at around 6:00 PM. Zhu then said goodbye and left. When he reached Fenjia Yihang, at around 6:30 PM, he returned to the store. Unexpectedly, just as he reached the entrance of Dean Lane, four thugs emerged from the darkness. Two were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, one was wearing a dark-colored cotton robe, and one was wearing a short coat, all wearing peaked caps. They rushed towards him, blocking his path. One of the robbers, wearing a black robe, spoke with a Hakka accent, saying to Zhu, "Be sensible, help us out." He then punched Zhu hard in the chest, and Zhu fell to the ground in pain. The robber then took out a sharp blade and stabbed Zhu in the foot, causing blood to flow freely. Another robber grabbed Zhu's throat with both hands, and the other two searched his pockets, finding a wallet filled with banknotes. They immediately told their companions, "Okay, okay," and fled into the side alleys without a trace. When Constable No. 151 arrived after hearing the alarm, the robbers were already far away. He could only send the injured man to Tongren Hospital for treatment. As for the amount of money robbed, it was not only 269 yuan, but also 20 yuan in Zhu's personal name, which was also completely robbed.</p>

<p>Mr. Shi Dezhi of the Shanghai Yaohua Pharmaceutical Factory invented Divine Efficacy Salvation Water, which has been sold for more than 30 years. Its efficacy is remarkable. The National Trademark Registration Bureau approved its registration. The Shanghai Municipal Council has granted it a special chemical test, proving that it is harmless. Foreign governments such as England, France, Japan, and their territories have also approved its distribution. In addition, Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Military and Political Minister He have awarded certificates. The Hong Kong Royal Hospital promotes it as a holy product among epidemic medicines. Therefore, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia believe in it even more. Maritime officials, such as Commanders Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others, send gifts worth more than 100,000 yuan each year. Charitable organizations such as Jisheng Hui, Pushan Villa, and the Hunan Charity Association purchase huge amounts for distribution every summer and autumn to save the poor.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Female Student Suicide <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jingru's Thoughts are Distracted</p>
<p>Hu Fanruo Pays Attention to Detail</p>
<p>The Lover Gun Case is Strange</p>
<p>Zhang Jingru, a female student at Datong University at the South Railway Station, committed suicide with a sharp blade in the school dormitory at around 10:00 AM yesterday. The school discovered this and immediately sent her to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, she died at around 11:00 AM due to her serious injuries. The details obtained are recorded below.</p>
<p>Entrance Process: Zhang Cishu, a native of Xuzhou, resides at the west end of Mao Pu Street in Pei County, Xuzhou. He has two sons and three daughters. The youngest daughter is Jingru, who is 19 years old. She is beautiful, quiet, and taciturn. Two years ago, because her brother Daoyuan was studying in the university department of Datong University in Shanghai, Jingru also came to Shanghai alone, applied to the school, and was admitted to the junior high school. She got along well with teachers and students. Time passed quickly, and a semester passed in the blink of an eye. Jingru packed her bags and returned home. For some reason, Jingru did not return to the school when the next semester started, and the teachers suspected that she had transferred to another school, so they did not pay attention to it. On February 1st of this year, the opening date of Datong University, Principal Cao Huijun suddenly received a letter by post. After opening it, he learned that it was sent by Zhang Jingru, stating that she wanted to re-enter the school, but did not know whether to take the exam again, so she came to inquire. At that time, Principal Cao replied that Jingru was a former student, and if she re-entered the first year of junior high school, she could be exempted from the exam. On the 5th, Jingru brought her luggage to the school. After paying the tuition fees as usual, the school handled it as a former student qualification, without requiring her to fill out a guarantee form. She was assigned to live in dormitory No. 19.</p>
<p>Claiming Illness and Seeking Medical Treatment: On the 6th of this month, all school students went to class, but Jingru stayed in the dormitory, not going out all day. She only started attending class the next morning, but the students did not see anything unusual. On the afternoon of the 9th, Jingru suddenly had a headache and wanted to ask for half a day off. Teacher Hu Fanruo allowed her to do so, and Jingru walked into the dormitory, got into bed, and rested. On the morning of the 10th, Jingru again asked Teacher Hu for another half-day off, so that she could go to a hospital outside the school to seek medical treatment. Hu thought that going out to seek medical treatment was a common occurrence and granted her leave. Jingru happily left the school and returned at around 11:00 AM, going straight to the dormitory. Her roommates asked how she was after the treatment. Jingru said that she felt a little better after the doctor gave her an injection and that she was about to take medicine. The students heard this and offered to pour her hot water, but Jingru firmly refused. Later, she took a cup of hot water herself, faced the glass window, and swallowed the medicine. However, the students did not know what kind of medicine she had taken. Jingru went to sleep after taking the medicine and did not attend class in the afternoon. In the evening, Hu felt strange and went to the dormitory to check on Jingru's condition. He saw that Jingru was extremely tired and her pulse was faint. Knowing that her illness had worsened, he urgently called Dr. Cai to come for a diagnosis, but he did not know the cause of her illness.</p>
<p>Sent to the Hospital: On the 11th, fearing that something dangerous would happen, he immediately sent Jingru to Shanghai Hospital for diagnosis, but still did not know what she was suffering from. Seeing that she was mentally exhausted, he gave her a strong heart injection. Her spirits only improved slightly in the evening. On the 12th, Hu, finding her illness strange, went to her dormitory to check for any abnormalities. After searching for a long time, he suddenly found an empty bottle of tranquilizer on the windowsill, and an empty box of tranquilizer pills outside the window. He realized that Jingru had committed suicide by taking poison, not by being ill. He immediately sent a letter to summon her family to Shanghai and rushed to Shanghai Hospital to report to the doctor, immediately finding a way to rescue her. In the evening, Jingru insisted on returning to school. The hospital, because the poison had been eliminated, said she was safe and allowed her to return to school. Jingru had returned to school.</p>
<p>Zhou Ma Takes Care: Hu, fearing that another accident would happen, hired a maid, Zhou Ma, to serve her and told her to pay attention to monitor everything. On the 13th, Hu went to ask her why she committed suicide. Jingru said that one of her classmates was the most vicious and wanted to take revenge. I was wronged by him. This is caused by the evil society. You are my dear teacher, please keep it a secret and do not announce my poisoning to others. Hu readily agreed. On the 14th, Hu went to visit her again. Jingru took 32 yuan and entrusted Hu to deposit it in the school. She also wrote a letter and entrusted him to mail it on her behalf. The gist of the letter was that her illness had recovered and asked her parents not to come to Shanghai, and that she planned to transfer to another school again. Hu, fearing another accident, collected the original letter. On the 15th (the day before yesterday), at around 6:00 AM, Jingru suddenly walked into Hu's bedroom, asking for leave to go out for medical treatment. Hu told her to wait, but she left angrily. Before long, Jingru learned that the original letter had not been mailed, and sent Zhou Ma to ask for it back.</p>
<p>Slitting Her Throat and Dying: At around 10:00 AM yesterday, Zhou Ma suddenly rushed to tell Hu that something bad had happened. Hu suspected that Jingru had fallen ill, and rushed into the dormitory for a close look. He opened the bed curtains and saw that Jingru was still holding a small foreign blade in her hand, covered in blood. Blood was gurgling from her neck, and the bed curtains were stained with blood. He realized that she had slit her throat and was shocked. He quickly prepared a car to send her to Shanghai Hospital, but she died at around 11:00 AM. The case was reported to the First Section of the First District, and Qin Defang, the local captain of the 23rd lane, was instructed to report to the Shanghai District Court for an autopsy. Her body has been returned to the school by the school.</p>
<p>Is it Zhang Biyue?: It was also found that the female student Zhang Jingru was the lover of Zhang Biyue, who caused a national sensation two years ago when she shot and killed her sister. Unexpectedly, she changed her name and came to Shanghai to study, enrolling in Datong University. There may be an unspeakable inside story in this sudden suicide.</p>
<h3 id="e122">A Pitiable Story of Wu Daosheng’s Tragic Suicide <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Failed to Find Work After Coming from Beiping</p>
<p>Incited by Others, Divorced His Wife</p>
<p>Faced Hardship After Remarrying</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with Emotions, Committed Suicide by Poison</p>
<p>Wu Daosheng, from Beiping, was thirty-seven years old. He used to work in the Accounting Section of the State Council during the Beiyang Government era. He also served as the director of a tobacco and alcohol monopoly bureau near Zhangjiakou. Seven years ago, he married his cousin Yao Baoru (currently twenty-five years old and a primary school graduate). After the Nationalist government moved south, Wu became unemployed, becoming a "disaster official." His household consisted only of him and his wife.</p>
<p>Finding Life Unbearable in the North, in the seventeenth year [of the Republic], he managed to scrape together seven thousand yuan and came to Shanghai with his wife's younger sister to seek employment. After arriving in Shanghai, they rented a room downstairs at No. 105 Xiexing Lane, Baoxing Road, Zhabei, at the house of Shen Mingsan (formerly employed at the Guangdong Mint). He sought employment from former Shanghai Mayor Zhang Ding, but without success. In Shanghai, he lent out the money he had brought with him and lived off the interest. His wife's younger sister recognized Mr. and Mrs. Shen as her adoptive parents. Unexpectedly, the Shens incited discord between Wu and his wife, leading to quarrels and disharmony.</p>
<p>Wu's wife's younger sister died of illness, and Wu's money, apart from a thousand or so gold yuan that he had lent out with receipts, was mostly borrowed and exhausted by others. At this point, the relationship between Wu and his wife deteriorated further. In the seventh month of the lunar calendar last year, they divorced through mediation by the Shens and others. Yao, because her younger sister had died,</p>
<p>Felt Alone and Abandoned in Shanghai, and without relatives, conceived the idea of suicide. She took poison in a hotel, but fortunately, the tea boy discovered her and sent her to Guangren Hospital, where she was saved. The hospital, seeing her pitiable situation, recommended her to work as a nanny at Datong Kindergarten at the intersection of Gordon Road and Wuding Road. In August, Wu married</p>
<p>A Muslim woman named Yang from Qingjiang, Yang Xiuhua (eighteen years old this year), and rented a room at No. 1126 and a half Taide Lane, Xinzha Road. Yang's mother and brother lived with them, depending on Wu for support. A month ago, Wu felt that his funds were depleted and life was difficult. Although he had divorced Yao Baoru, he still maintained contact with her as a relative and sought her help in finding employment. He expressed regret for having listened to</p>
<p>Other's Incitement to Divorce and showed signs of being tired of the world and wanting to kill himself. Yao comforted him and promised to help him find a job. Later, Wu found that the rent was too high and he could not afford it. He discussed with Yao, seeking help to sell his bedding and furniture to move to a smaller place and reduce expenses. Yao again helped him by mortgaging the items for sixty yuan, which he gave to Wu, telling him that he could redeem them later when he found a job. After getting the money, Wu moved to the upper floor of Yushengxiang Chicken and Duck Shop on Chi Bang Bridge, Xinzha Road. Before long, Wu again complained that the</p>
<p>House was too small and unsuitable, and asked Yao to help him find a solution. She promised to help him find a place for Wu to stay temporarily in a church. Wu also entrusted Yao with the receipts for the loans he had made, asking her to find a lawyer to recover the debts. When Wu's current wife Yang Hua and her mother and brother found out about this, they suspected that Yao had bad intentions and wanted to entice Wu to live with her, so they kept Wu under surveillance at home and prevented him from going out. As a result, Wu felt economically strapped and was prevented from having freedom and had difficulty finding employment. Overwhelmed with emotions,</p>
<p>He Conceived the Idea of Suicide. At 4:00 PM on the thirteenth of this month, he pretended to go out to collect debts to prepare for the New Year, telling his wife and mother-in-law that he was going out. He bought poison and went to the Aiduya Road No. 245 Hotel in the French Concession, where he registered under the name Zhao Guangyu from Shandong. After booking a room, he wrote two letters. One letter detailed how he, his wife, and her younger sister came to Shanghai seeking employment without success, how his wife and he were incited to divorce by the Shens, and how his money was borrowed and cheated away. He blamed himself for being foolish and</p>
<p>Expressed Weariness of the World and Suicidal Thoughts. The other letter was addressed to his divorced wife Yao, expressing his apologies and asking her to consider their family ties, to arrange for the collection of his body, and to bring it back to his hometown in the future. After writing the letters, he took the poison and committed suicide. It was not until 2:00 PM the next day that the tea boy discovered him. He was already dead. The police were notified and the body was taken to the forensic examination office of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall to await examination. The details have been briefly reported on the fifteenth. Subsequently, the detective, according to the address on the letter, notified the family members Yao Binru and Yang Xiuhua to come to the station. Yesterday, Zhu, the presiding judge of the criminal court of the French Concession, came to the office to examine the body and confirmed that the deceased had indeed</p>
<p>Died by Poisoning Himself While Alive. The detective also submitted the deceased's will as evidence. Yao stated that she was willing to claim the body for burial. Judge Zhu then ordered Yao Binru to prepare a coffin for burial. Yao then managed to provide clothing and a coffin, and hastily arranged for the burial and temporarily placed the coffin in the cemetery.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Factory Owner Seduces Neighbor's Daughter <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Engages in Conduct of Beginning with Affection and Abandoning</p>
<p>Uncaring for a Newborn</p>
<p>Shen Meimei Laments Her Unfortunate Fate</p>
<p>Shen's Mother Appeals to the Law</p>
<p>Zhong Xiaoqi, the fifth son of Mr. Zhong, a Cantonese owner of a sock factory in Weishui Lane, Zhejiang Road, is a frivolous young man who enjoys chasing after women. His neighbor, a widow named Shen Zhu (also known as Shen Li), from Suzhou, has a daughter named Meimei, who is twenty-nine years old and still unmarried.</p>
<p>Xiaoqi Admired Her Beautiful Appearance and used various tricks to seduce her. The girl, who was of marriageable age and had once been a registered entertainer, not only did not reject his advances but welcomed them. Thus, they formed an inseparable bond, meeting frequently in hotels, while the girl's mother remained unaware. Before long,</p>
<p>The Girl Conceived a Child. Xiaoqi then disappeared without a trace and stopped seeing the girl. The girl lamented her unfortunate fate and being abandoned midway. The girl's mother also noticed that her abdomen was gradually swelling and questioned her severely. The girl could no longer hide the truth and confessed everything. The mother hated Xiaoqi for ruining her daughter's chastity and then abandoning her. After she gave birth in a hospital last month, she hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to sue Zhong Xiaoqi in the Special District Local Court,</p>
<p>Charging Zhong with Seduction. The complaint stated that the defendant had seduced a girl under the age of twenty and abandoned the child she bore. According to the law, he should be sentenced to imprisonment for one to seven years and fined up to one thousand yuan. Furthermore, those who abandon persons who are unable to help themselves, who are required to be supported, raised, and protected by law or contract, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for six months to five years. In this case, the second plaintiff,</p>
<p>Shen Meimei, is Eighteen Years Old, and her intelligence is not fully developed. She was seduced by the defendant and ran away from her mother. Initially, there were sweet words and letters back and forth, but then he abandoned the old for the new, making excuses to avoid her and disappearing without a trace. Finally, he abandoned the child she bore, which constitutes the criminal acts mentioned above. The plaintiff requests that the defendant be summoned to court and punished, and also requests a judgment for current support and</p>
<p>Expenses for Childbirth, a portion of which amounts to one thousand yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao opened the fifth criminal court for trial. First, the plaintiff's lawyer, Shen Xingxia, stated that Shen Meimei was ill after childbirth and could not attend court. He requested a seven-day postponement until she recovered and could testify. The court then summoned the defendant, who stated that he was from Guangdong and was twenty-two years old. When asked if Shen Meimei was his wife or concubine, Zhong replied that she was neither his wife nor his concubine. "Did you and Shen have a child?" Zhong answered, "The child is not mine. I am a neighbor,</p>
<p>Her family Runs a Club, and I often go there to play mahjong. I sometimes stay overnight at her house." Lawyer Shen then stated that Meimei's admission to the hospital for childbirth was done under the name of the Guangdong Sock Factory. The defendant denied this upon hearing this. Lawyer Shen then asked the defendant if he had opened a hotel room with Meimei. He replied, "Yes, I did. On September 23rd of last year, I returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou and stayed at the Pingqiao Hotel. I met Meimei on the way, and that's how we met.</p>
<p>That Night She Came to My Place, gave me ten yuan and asked me to buy her a watch. We went to the hotel together and slept in the same bed." Lawyer Shen then asked him if he had written any letters to Meimei. He answered, "Yes, I did. The letter generally said, 'You already have a handsome friend, and I can't afford to provide you with money now because my monthly salary is limited.'" Shen then requested a postponement and asked the defendant to post bail because his father had denied having such a son when the summons was first delivered to the defendant's store. Judge Xiao then granted the request, ordered the defendant to provide a surety who could be summoned at any time, and rescheduled the hearing for 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e124">A Young Woman's Suicide Attempt in the River <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>She Refuses to Explain the Reason</p>
<p>But Her Life is Not in Danger</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, around 5:30 PM, a woman with bobbed hair, wearing a green wool serge cheongsam with a vest and black velvet cotton shoes, was seen pacing back and forth along the Bund outside the Sima Road. A Chinese constable No. 1742, noticing her suspicious behavior, approached her and asked her what she was doing there and who she was waiting for. The woman did not answer. The constable, seeing that she was a young woman, did not press the matter and proceeded towards the Customs House. The woman, seeing that the constable had gone north, went to the riverside at 6:15 PM and jumped into the river to end her life and join the water deities. At that moment, a cargo barge nearby saw a woman jumping into the river to commit suicide and bravely rescued her. Fortunately, she had not been in the water for</p>
<p>Long and had swallowed little water, so she was still able to speak. However, she was shivering from the cold because her clothes were wet. By this time, the constable had returned from the Customs House and took the woman back to the main station on Sima Road. After questioning by detectives, she only stated that her surname was Chen, her given name was A'nan, she was twenty-six years old, a local, and lived at No. 6 Zhenyun Lane, Zhujia Bridge, but she refused to reveal why she had attempted suicide. The police then dispatched constable No. 1742 to take her to Renji Hospital and sent investigators to inquire about her family and the reason for her suicide. According to the staff at Renji Hospital, she was staying in room 55 on the fifth floor and was not in any danger.</p>

<p>Not a Matter of Money</p>
<p>Possibly Jealousy and Quarrels</p>
<p>In the Wang Ma Road Yu Fang Second Lane First House (that is, West Lane No. 12), there is a high-class prostitute named Zhou Huiling, nineteen years old, from Suzhou. Yesterday, she went to the Shenzhou Hotel with her patron, Mr. Wang, and booked room 104. For some unknown reason, she had the idea of suicide and bought a can of raw opium at 5:00 PM and swallowed it without anyone noticing. At 6:15 PM, the tea boy noticed that her face looked strange and discovered that she had overdosed on raw opium. He immediately reported to the front desk and notified the police. Her fellow prostitutes also rushed her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Zhou Huiling was also staying in ward 55 on the fifth floor. According to the hospital doctor, she had taken too much opium, was deeply poisoned, and her life may be in danger. After receiving the news, our reporter went to the brothel in Yu Fang to inquire about Zhou's background and the reason for her suicide. Initially, the brothel denied that there was anyone named Zhou Huiling in the brothel. Then they said that she was only there for a visit and did not work there. They also said that she was a high-class prostitute and was probably not forced by money problems. It may have been due to jealousy and quarrels.</p>

<p>Dumpling Shop Worker Accused</p>
<p>But He Vehemently Denies It</p>
<p>Fan Liwen, an Anhui native who runs a dumpling shop at No. 68 Huayuan Stone Bridge in Pudong, along with his wife Fan Wu and witness Wang Wenjun, filed a complaint with the Third District Police Station yesterday, stating that Fan Liwen, thirty-three years old, and Fan Wu, thirty-six years old, returned to their hometown on January 17th because of business, leaving his wife and child, as well as friends from the same hometown, Lu Zhide and Wang Wenjun, at home to run the business. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM that night, Lu Zhide took the dumpling carrier home and threatened Fan Wu with a sharp blade to have sex. When she refused, Lu threatened to kill her and her child. When she screamed, Lu covered her mouth. Unable to resist the violence, she was raped. The next day, he did not do business and forced her to have sex that night. On the third day, he forced her to have sex again, which was witnessed by Wang Wenjun. Fearing that her husband would find out and she would be in trouble, Lu said he would kill her husband. When she refused, Lu ordered her to run away with him. On the 25th of this month, Fan Liwen returned home and she told him the truth. Fan then ordered his wife to obtain a note from Lu with his handwritten address of where he would flee to in Nanjing, and then filed a lawsuit. The police were dispatched and arrested Lu Zhide, who confessed that he was thirty-five years old and that he had had sex with her since September of last year because she had taken a liking to him. He refused to run away with her this time because he was a servant and could not afford to live together, so she plotted against him. Due to the bizarre circumstances, the case has been transferred to the local court for further investigation.</p>

<p>Lu Resists Inspection and Conflicts</p>
<p>Investigative Soldier Fires a Shot, Causing Trouble</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, as the Jin-Hu passenger ship was about to depart from the Minnan Wharf outside the Nanshi Wai Guan Bridge, investigators from the Garrison Headquarters Investigation Team boarded the ship for inspection, accompanied by investigative soldiers. At that time, Lu Genbao, a worker for a nearby rice boat owner He Dequan, approximately fifty years old and a local native, was on the ship for leisure. During the inspection, Lu resisted and clashed, leading to soldier Peng Shaobao firing a shot that hit Lu in the right waist and exited from the left waist. Lu immediately collapsed on the ship. Water patrol police arrived and arrested Peng. In addition to the Public Security Bureau reporting the case to the Headquarters for verification, in the afternoon, the local leader Lu Yongde of the Sixteenth Shop reported the case to the local court for verification. Inspector Wu was dispatched to the scene to verify the death due to injury.

<p>Dissolves Ru Yi's Engagement</p>
<p>Also Breaks Ties with Her Adoptive Mother</p>
<p>Zhou Yunlong from Tingzhou, who resides at No. 973 Yongkang Lane, Shanban Bridge, Maigen Road, is a fortune teller. In April of the year before last, he engaged his son to Ru Yi, the daughter of Ge Qin, a Zhili woman who lives next door. The girl was only thirteen years old and was raised as a child bride. Last autumn, the girl was abducted. The police arrested the abductor, surnamed Xu, and punished him. Because Ru Yi suffered abuse from her parents-in-law and did not want to return to Zhou's family, the Special District Local Court sent her to the Jiliang Institute for care. At the time of the incident, the girl's mother had returned to Tianjin and was unaware of the matter. She returned to Shanghai a few days ago and was informed of the incident by the matchmaker Zhu Shengcai. She went to Zhou's family to make accusations and sued Zhou for abusing her daughter. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge of the Special Court opened the trial and summoned Ru Yi to testify. According to Ge Qin, Ru Yi was adopted by her when she was eight months old. She engaged her to Zhou's son through Zhu as a matchmaker two years ago for a bride price of thirty yuan. She was raised as a child bride. Later, the husband died, and the coffin was transported back to his hometown. Therefore, she did not know about Ru Yi's abduction at first. She is now requesting that the defendant return her daughter and the bride price. Zhou Yunlong stated in his defense that Ru Yi was engaged to my son with the consent of the plaintiff and his wife. After the abduction case was solved, Ru Yi did not want to return home and was sent to the Jiliang Institute temporarily. I did not abuse her. There is no reason for her lawsuit. If she insists on taking her away, she must return my bride price and other expenses of one hundred and thirty yuan. The matchmaker Zhu Shengcai also testified that the bride price was indeed one hundred and thirty yuan. Ru Yi testified that she is now fifteen years old, the plaintiff is my adoptive mother, and I now want to live permanently in the Jiliang Institute. I do not want to go to either my mother's house or my husband's house. A female director of the Jiliang Institute also came to court and presented her proposed compromise. The one hundred and thirty yuan requested by the plaintiff could be paid by the institute on her behalf, but Ru Yi must live there and her future marriage would also be decided by the institute. In this way, all three parties would benefit. Judge Ge then sought the opinions of the three parties regarding the opinions expressed by the director of the institute, and they all agreed. The judge ordered the director of the institute to pay one hundred and thirty yuan to the case, one hundred yuan to the defendants Zhou Yunlong and his wife, and thirty yuan to the plaintiff. He also ordered Zhou to submit Ru Yi's birth date, and Ge Qin was also ordered to submit the gift list she received. The marriage relationship was dissolved, and Ru Yi returned to the Jiliang Institute with the female director to await marriage when she grew older.</p>

<p>Ma Yili</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Baoqi, whose courtesy name was Muhanj, late in life using the sobriquet Meng Jin Old Man, was from the prestigious Wu Ling family. He held many important positions and served as an envoy to foreign countries. He was in politics for fifty years and was renowned for thirty years. After the party-state was stabilized, he retired to the south and settled in Shanghai. He had many children and was in dire straits. Mr. Sun was charitable and generous throughout his life and was not skilled in economics, so he served for many years but remained penniless. He died of illness in Shanghai last month. When the news came, everyone who knew him and who did not sighed and lamented. I have been favored by him and have no way to repay him. Writing this, I cannot help but feel grateful and ashamed. I will recount several anecdotes to encourage the world and show a small part of Mr. Sun's virtues.</p>
<p>During the Jiazi Qi-Lu War, Mr. Sun pleaded for his hometown, running around tirelessly. When he learned that the front line had actually opened fire, he sighed incessantly. When Lu Zijia invited him to a banquet at the governor's office, Mr. Sun tore up the invitation and went to the lake. The next morning, he left Hangzhou with the refugees, without anyone knowing.</p>
<p>The following year, Sun Xinyuan entered Zhejiang. Xia Chao, who was once his subordinate, was in charge of the provincial government. Xia expanded the police force, which was resented by Sun's troops, gradually creating an undercurrent. Both sides were on alert, and the situation was tense. Wang Zhuqi, Jin Baishun, and others tried to mediate without success. Finally, they pushed Mr. Sun forward. It was deep winter, late at night, and he was still bowing and apologizing in the military headquarters. He was able to not forget the safety of his hometown. He was truly admirable.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun upheld the ancient ways and was extremely filial. His younger brother Zhongyu was also the same. Zhongyu, whose given name was Baoxuan, once served as the superintendent of the Ningbo Customs. Every spring and autumn, they would return to their hometown together to visit relatives and sweep the tombs. They would always stay at the ancestral shrine of his late father-in-law, Zhang Qinguo. The shrine had beautiful scenery and was elegant and clean, making it a good place to stay. When the brothers had no social engagements, they would go to the lake. One moonlit night, they planned to row to Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, but there were no boatmen. I and my late brother Wenbin happened to be nearby and volunteered to row. Mr. Sun and his brother also rolled up their sleeves and helped, pushing through the wind and waves. The past is still vivid in my mind. Thinking of the past and comparing it to the present, I cannot help but feel sad.</p>
<p>When the prominent member of the Min Party, Mr. Jiang Guanyun, died in Shanghai, Mr. Sun supported himself with a cane and went to the funeral, wailing for a distance. Before the tears had dried, the news of another death arrived. His sixth sister, Madam Zhang, passed away from illness. He rushed there at night and wept over the coffin. Within three days, his old tears flowed frequently, and his eyes were almost dry. His deep feelings for his old friend were beyond what ordinary people could reach. When the party army set out, Mr. Sun retired to the south. Many important figures in the party-state praised him. Some asked him what he thought of Sun Yat-sen's doctrine. He would raise his thumb and say, "Good." He also said that he was very friendly with Sun Yat-sen. He especially praised Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek. He often cared about national affairs. Zhang Jingjiang, the governor of Zhejiang Province, hired him as a senior advisor. He made contributions from time to time. Therefore, Mr. Sun also made small contributions to the party-state.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Snow <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Autumn Water</p>
<p>These past few days, Shanghai has had continuous heavy snow. It is truly beautiful to see. There is a saying: "Winter snow protects the five grains, spring snow protects the people." Now that we have both winter and spring snow, it is not only beautiful but also gratifying.</p>
<p>However, snow is currently more harmful than beneficial. Especially in transportation, snow is considered the number one enemy. What are the four major enemies? One is snow, two is fog, three is hail, and four is water. Fog can obscure the path, hail can damage vehicles, and water can flood the tracks. All of these are major enemies of transportation. In addition to obscuring the path, damaging vehicles, and flooding the tracks, snow can also crush power lines. You can imagine how harmful snow can be.</p>
<p>Snow is even more troublesome for trains. I still remember in 1866, there was heavy snow in several places in Northumberland, England. The snow was five or six feet high. The trains were almost completely buried in the snow. They could not move, and the passengers could not get out. Transportation personnel tried to remove the snow to rescue the passengers. However, some people waited for four days before the snow melted and they could leave the train. It was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>Therefore, railway bureaus in Europe and the United States must have specially made snowplows. Snowplows are made of steel or wood and weigh at least 26 tons. They have three pairs of wheels and are powered by a machine. There are also iron plates and brushes next to the wheels. In the snow or after the snow, they drive along the railway tracks, pushing the snow to the left and right and cleaning the tracks. The car has a stove for heating and a kitchen for making food. It can accommodate dozens of people. Because it takes one or two days of continuous work to clear the snow along the way after a snowfall.</p>
<p>Norfolk, England, had an unprecedented heavy snowfall in 1881. The trains there could not run, and the snowplows were difficult to operate. Because the snow was too heavy and the weather was too cold, the snowplow's engine was small and there was nothing that could be done. Finally, they borrowed eight train locomotives and pushed them behind the snowplow to generate heat and move forward. It was an interesting story in the snow.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Thirteen as a Lucky Number <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>

<p>Zheng Baozhao and Thirteen</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Yangsheng (Baozhao), the chief of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, is a prominent railway expert in our country, known for his competence and diligence in handling affairs. I once chatted with him, and he mentioned that the number thirteen is often considered unlucky by Westerners. However, for him, it has a special connection. He recalled that after joining the International Savings Society for several years, he had never won any prizes, and he had long given up hope. Unexpectedly, one day, the society suddenly sent him several hundred yuan, saying it was prize money. He was surprised and delighted, and upon checking the calendar on his desk, he saw it was the 13th. Truly a coincidence.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments and Introduction: The Medical Review, edited by Mr. Chu Minyi, has been published for two years. Its purpose is to promote medical knowledge and discuss health facilities, and its value is unparalleled. We received a complimentary copy two weeks ago. Introduction to a Famous Epigrapher: Huang Junhanhou of Yangzhou is a renowned modern epigrapher, especially skilled in carving fans. He excels in all styles of calligraphy, including regular, cursive, seal, and official scripts, and his imitations are flawless. The fan bones he carves are no more than a foot long and only a few points wide. Some are engraved with the complete "Former and Latter Red Cliff Odes" or the "Former and Latter Memorials to the Throne," while others contain the entire "Sacred Teachings Preface" or the complete "Orchid Pavilion Preface" and thirteen postscripts. His imitations are so lifelike that the spirit and charm are not lost. The style is elegant and refined, with details as fine as mosquito legs, requiring a magnifying glass for those with slightly impaired vision to appreciate them fully. Major fan shops in Shanghai all carry Hanhou's works, and his fees are not excessive. You can write to Mr. Huang at Dazhuang in Duozijie, Yangzhou, for inquiries. I hereby introduce him to fellow enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Tang Bin</p>
<p>The literary scene in Hangzhou has been unusually flourishing recently. Small-scale literary groups organized by young people who love literature have generally published regular periodicals, and their content is dedicated to promoting nationalistic literature. This is a good phenomenon in the literary world of inland China, undoubtedly influenced by the nationalistic literary movement in Shanghai. We must understand that modern Chinese literature lacks a correct central ideology, which has made the entire literary scene dark and chaotic. The confusion of thought is indescribable, and nothing is more detrimental to the bright future of young people than the Proletarian literature that was once popular. If we want to eliminate these corrupt and degenerate ideas, we can only promote a kind of literature with a clear ideology that young people need. In this way, incorrect ideas will be washed away invisibly.</p>
<p>The nationalistic literary movement has become the main trend in the Chinese literary world because it has a definite central ideology, and this is what the youth most need at present. We have seen that since the nationalistic literary movement was launched in Shanghai, there have been many periodicals and newspapers in various places that have responded to it. The "Qingping Monthly," which was discovered in the literary world of Hangzhou, is one of the most powerful of them.</p>
<p>The content of this inaugural issue is quite rich, such as Ding Leihong's "Play Wildly," Zheng Bo's "National Literature and Life," Youwei's "Heart Song," Xiaofeng's "Decent Gentleman," Gongzhu's "How Can You Lingeringly Cherish," Weiming's "For the Sake of Dishonesty," and Paixia's "Our World," etc., are all noteworthy works, at least in terms of ideological awareness.</p>
<p>In "Our Beginning," it is played wildly like this: "We have seized the era, this era occupies a very important part of the rhythm of our lives, but, friends, you must remember that this is easy to pass, and it will also disappear like the dark years of the past, in the invisible surroundings, in the ethereal fantasy, it disappears lightly, therefore, we need to have a deep understanding of life here, and then record it so ordinary, this understanding is very broad, it is a small model of our life, it is the radio of our shouts, ... we must record, record these ordinary stories, and at the same time, show the beautiful colors of the inner heart, as a memorial to the survival of our souls, because of this very small meaning, Qingping's buds are beginning to unfold today, along with us, we accept the inspiration of the new God of Destiny, relying on the bright and delicate flowers, to complete everything, friends who sympathize with us, please stand on the same front as us, pluck the heartstrings, and play wildly with all your might, take advantage of youth to take on this mission,"</p>
<p>After the wild playing that aroused our emotions, there is a powerful treatise 丨 National Literature and Life, although the content is somewhat simple, but the points discussed are very correct.</p>
<p>At the same time, the author also has a commentary on the Chinese literary world, which is also very true, as he said, "We see what kind of phenomenon is presented in the Chinese new literary world, since the vigorous new literature movement more than ten years ago, there have been many lively emotions and works with realization as the theme, but now the new literature does not seem to be progressing by leaps and bounds, and the spirit is unusually depressed," this is of course, its biggest shortcoming is still the lack of a correct central ideology, which makes Chinese new literature unable to develop, if we want to save the crisis in the Chinese literary world, that is, to make the new literature have some expression, then, we must promote national literature, the author also thought of this point, so in the end he ended like this, "Now it is the twentieth century, we should shoulder the mission of the literature required by this era, 丨 national literature 丨," if these young people work hard like this, they will definitely be able to get great results, but now there are already considerable achievements emerging before our eyes,</p>
<p>The two novels, "Decent Gentleman" and "For the Sake of Dishonesty," are both worth reading because their views are very correct, in fact, we can also regard them as ideal texts, in terms of poetry, especially some precious works, with rich emotions, upward consciousness, beautiful words, and encouraging maxims, because of the length of the article, I will not quote them one by one here,</p>
<p>In the literary world of Hangzhou, it is indeed a gratifying phenomenon to be able to give us such a powerful publication that promotes national literature, and, they have such a vigorous vitality in the embryonic stage, and the development in the future is of course unlimited, I sincerely make a careful recommendation here, which is a very meaningful thing, finally, I hope that the "Qingping" colleagues will work hard, and I hope that the literary world in Shanghai will pay attention to them,</p>

<p>Anna</p>
<p>One Snowy Afternoon</p>
<p>All the way on the tram, the granular snowflakes, with the assistance of the north wind, were flying particularly lively in the air. Although I was wearing a coat and hat, I couldn't resist their attack. The more anxious I felt, the slower the tram seemed to be. My face felt like it was being pricked by thousands of needles.</p>
<p>The dark sky seemed even more drowsy. The street lights gradually increased. I thought of my family longing for me, especially my mother's distant thoughts. She would brave the wind and snow and stand in front of the door at this dusk, stretching her neck and waiting for her children who had gone out to study to return home. She was looking forward to it like a year, and the wrinkles between her eyebrows were gradually increasing. Great maternal love would make the weary traveler feel refreshed, and make people full of worries smile, and warm my frozen body...</p>
<p>Ah, great maternal love!</p>
<p>Thinking like this, smiling, I seemed to be standing in front of my mother, seeing her kind face and her gentle comfort, forgetting that I was still standing on this snowy ground, with a bag in my hand containing the heart, lungs, and liver of a fetus just dissected in the hospital.</p>
<p>This fetus was unfortunately a transverse presentation and died in the womb after a long period of time. He also suffered from inherited syphilis, as indicated by the enlargement of the liver. He was very good-looking, like a sleeping baby, with cheeks as red and lovely as duckweed. I didn't believe that he was a person who had left the world, a soulless person. Alas, I don't know why, I felt twelve points of pity and sympathy for this lovely and innocent fetus.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The dissection began, and the shining knife was on his abdomen.</p>
