<p>此極爲樂觀據稱此案有使各國軍備不再擴充之效力即使明年軍縮大會無成續而此項休戰料亦可延長五年云云國聯中人所樂觀者如是然以我人觀察假使明年軍縮會議不成則此一年休戰之約其效甚微又假使此新發生之中日問題調解無結果則非特明年之軍縮會議不必開即此休戰一年之約恐亦將未必不等於零故世界和平之成功與否其關鍵不在表面上之軍備休戰而實在國聯各國是否有遏止暴日之力量</p>
<p>今據日内瓦方面消息國聯以滿洲局勢日見惡化或將不待至十一月十六</p>
<p>而提早開會是國聯之對此問題固亦殷殷盼望而不釋於懷惟究竟有無成竹在胸尙非吾人所能逆料蘇俄論軍備休戰事謂（國聯關於國際義務之種種决議常空泛而不切實實爲造成今日滿洲可悲事件之一原因此種現象顯然不能增進信任之空氣）斯言最足以促進國聯之覺悟但國聯旣知滿洲局勢益趨惡化則必將更有所努力以免影響於明年軍縮可斷言也</p>
<p>意國論壇報論美國接受軍備休戰案將美政府對軍縮態度與中日滿洲事並論謂（美國之接受軍備休戰極可重視日本在滿洲活動當然有使美國擴張海軍之感）今美政府旣欲玉成軍縮胡拂總統且已留意於明年出席軍縮大會之人物而推選及於參院外交委員長之波拉氏則其重視軍縮可知而其重視足以破壞軍縮之滿洲問題又可知論壇報之論關係固甚重要也</p>

<h3>Bai Li'an's Reply to Japanese Statement</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council May Convene Early</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Force Zhang's Brigade to Withdraw from Tongliao City</p>
<p>Ling Yinqing's Bandit Troops Disarmed by Northeast Army</p>
<p>Bai Li'an's Letter to Fang Ze</p>
<p>The Basic Principles Proposed by the Japanese Government</p>
<p>China Has Given Full Assurance</p>
<p>Nanjing, Bai Li'an, in a letter to Japanese representative Fang Ze, replied to the Japanese government's statement of October 26 as follows: Since the draft resolution of the previous Executive Council meeting, which, with the exception of the Japanese representative, was passed by all members of the Executive Council and submitted for our consideration, the situation has become clear and can be stated as follows. Moreover, the vote of the previous Executive Council meeting still contains sufficient moral force, but even setting this aside and speaking solely from a legal standpoint, before us is the resolution unanimously passed on September 30. This resolution remains valid and contains sufficient executive force. In this resolution, the Executive Council noted the Japanese representative's statement that the Japanese government (would continue the troop withdrawal operation that has already begun as quickly as possible, the extent of which would depend on the effective guarantee of the lives and property of the Japanese people, and hopes to fully realize its intention within the shortest possible period). At that time, the Japanese representative did not indicate in any way that Japan's treaty rights in Manchuria were related to the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people. Furthermore, the first three sections of the two draft resolutions submitted to the Executive Council on October 24 are completely identical. It can be asserted that these three sections represent the common will of both parties. In the statement of October 26, the Japanese government stated its so-called basic principles as follows: (1) Both parties mutually deny that they have a policy or behavior of aggression. Upon investigation, the second section of both draft resolutions of October 24 stated that the two governments agreed not to take aggressive policies or actions. (2) Respect for the territorial integrity of China. The third section of both draft resolutions also contains the same statement. (3) Prohibition of all organized movements that interfere with freedom of trade and incite international animosity. The second section of both draft resolutions stated that the two governments agreed to take measures to prohibit hostile movements. (4) Providing strong protection to Japanese people in Manchuria so that they can live and work in peace. The first section of both draft resolutions stated that the Chinese government guarantees to provide strong protection to Japanese residents in Manchuria. The fact that the Chinese government accepted the Executive Council's resolution and that the Japanese representative's counterproposal also contained the above three paragraphs is sufficient to prove that the two governments have completely agreed on these four points. The last point is respecting Japan's treaty rights in Manchuria. Regarding this point, I would like to ask your representative to pay attention to the letter from the Chinese representative on October 24. In that letter, Dr. Shi stated that China abides by the League of Nations Covenant like other member states. The Chinese government is determined to faithfully fulfill all obligations of the League of Nations Covenant. China can provide concrete proof of this determination, namely, it is willing to submit all disputes between China and Japan regarding treaty interpretation to arbitration or to refer them to the International Court of Justice in accordance with Article 13 of the League of Nations Covenant. In view of all this, I deeply believe that the members of the Executive Council and your representative can agree on the following fact: the Chinese government has given the Executive Council full assurance regarding the various basic principles proposed by the Japanese government. I deeply believe that the Japanese government is eager to fulfill its solemn obligations under the resolution of September 30. This obligation was repeatedly confirmed in the statements of the Executive Council meetings of October 22, 23, and 24, and to continue to withdraw the Japanese troops to the railway zone within the shortest possible period so that the Japanese government's wishes can be fully realized within the shortest possible period. As for the Japanese government's great emphasis on the safety of the lives and property of Japanese people in the withdrawal area, I would like to ask your representative to pay attention to the fifth paragraph of the Executive Council's resolution of October 24. That paragraph recommends that the two governments immediately appoint representatives to discuss the detailed measures for receiving the withdrawal area after the troop withdrawal is implemented so that this action</p>
<p>can be implemented in an orderly and without pretense. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Exchange of Notes</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Hopes to Start Negotiations First</p>
<p>Our Country Urges Troop Withdrawal According to the Deadline</p>
<p>Nanjing, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to our country's ambassador to Japan, Jiang, on October 31, roughly repeating the statement to the League of Nations, hoping to start discussions with China to establish a general outline for the foundation of normal Sino-Japanese relations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already instructed Ambassador Jiang on the 3rd to reply to the Japanese government, refuting the reasons for refusing to withdraw troops, and stating that the Chinese government, based on the resolution of the Executive Council, invites the Japanese government to appoint representatives to discuss the details of the withdrawal and reception. China has appointed a reception committee and asks Japan to send representatives to discuss the above details as soon as possible, and to completely withdraw troops before November 16. After the troop withdrawal is completed, negotiations on the pending issues between the two countries will begin, and a conciliation committee or similar permanent mechanism will be established. Finally, it is stated that the Chinese government's views on this matter have been notified to the League of Nations on October 31 and requests for reference. The full text can be disclosed on the 4th. (4th special dispatch)</p>
<p>League of Nations Administrative Council</p>
<h3>May Be Convened Early</h3>
<p>The Meeting Place Is Mostly in Paris</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Statements Sent to Various Countries</p>
<p>Japanese Teachers' Association Sends Telegram to League of Nations</p>
<p>Demanding the Suppression of Anti-Japanese Education in China</p>
<p>Geneva, the Manchurian news received here is particularly unable to relieve the League of Nations. If the situation does not improve, the League of Nations Administrative Council may convene early without waiting until November 16. When the Administrative Council adjourned at the end of October, the League of Nations once stated that if the development of the situation requires the Administrative Council to be convened before November 16, it can be convened early. Judging from the current situation, early convening is expected. The official news received here from Nanjing on November 1 reported activities such as intimidation by the Japanese in Manchuria. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva, the reply of Bai Li'an, the French Foreign Minister and Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, to Fang Ze regarding the League of Nations' Japanese statement on the Manchurian case has been temporarily delayed because Fang Ze requested clarification of two points in the reply. According to news received by the League of Nations Secretariat, the Manchurian situation is deteriorating daily. (3rd Reuters</p>
<p>dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva, recently, people in the League of Nations indicated that when the Council reconvenes on the 16th to mediate the Manchurian case, it will most likely be held in Paris because the French Parliament will convene this month and Bai Li'an must stay in the capital to constantly contact the government and Parliament. Therefore, the League of Nations Council decided to change the meeting place to Paris. (2nd Kuomintang News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva, today, League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond distributed Bai Li'an's declaration on the five basic points for resolving the Manchurian case in the Japanese statement to all member states for reference. Drummond also sent Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech at the National Government Memorial Week on October 26 and China's declaration on the five basic points of the Japanese statement to all member states at the request of Shi Zhaoji, the chief representative of China. The content of Bai Li'an's reply to the Japanese statement stated that the first four points are already included in the resolution passed by the Council on October 24. As for the fifth point, since China is willing to submit to public judgment in order to establish the validity of the existing Sino-Japanese treaties, what Japan requires can also be included. In addition, the Japanese Teachers' Association sent a telegram slandering that Chinese primary and secondary schools are responsible for most of the Sino-Japanese disputes for teaching anti-Japanese education, and excerpted what it considers to be anti-Japanese education in textbooks, requesting the League of Nations International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to review it. Currently, Drummond has also distributed it. (2nd Kuomintang News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Situation in Tongliao is Critical</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Dig Trenches at the North Station</p>
<p>Demanding that Zhang Shusheng Lead His Troops to Withdraw</p>
<p>Tianjin, on the 2nd, the Japanese soldiers who occupied the South Station of Tongliao retreated to the North Station on the evening of the 2nd. On the morning of the 3rd, they fired two cannons at the South Station. At 12:40 PM, two Japanese armored trains arrived at the North Station and immediately dug trenches. At the same time, another armored train arrived and dismantled the railway tracks from Tongliao to Kailu. On the evening of the 3rd, the trenches were completed and landmines were buried and machine guns were set up. An order was issued to Zhang Shusheng, commander of the 3rd Brigade of the Northeast Cavalry of the Commercial Liao, to lead his troops to withdraw, otherwise they would attack. The situation is extremely critical. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, yesterday, the Japanese armored train used artillery to bombard the North and South Stations of Tongliao and the city. Fortunately, the people hid in underground caves and there were not many casualties, but many houses were destroyed. Seeing no resistance, the Japanese army sent more than 20 armed soldiers to the South Station, tore down the Chinese flag, replaced it with the Japanese flag, and looked for trouble everywhere. The employees did not care about it. Unable to succeed in their cunning plan, they still went to repair the road. Last night, the railway tracks were repaired. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Jinzhou telegram: After the North and South Stations of Tongliao were occupied by the Japanese armored train and Japanese soldiers and Mongolian bandits on the 2nd, they used heavy artillery to bombard the city at night. The sound of artillery fire did not stop all night, and many civilian houses in the city were destroyed. Many people were killed and injured. The military police in the city did not resist. One unit temporarily retreated outside the West Gate on the morning of the 3rd, and the rest were prepared to withdraw. The order in the city was chaotic. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Jinzhou telegram: This morning at 8:00 AM, the Japanese army fired two cannons at the South Station of Tongliao. The losses and casualties are unknown. Two Japanese armored trains have arrived at the North Station of Tongliao. The Japanese army has dug trenches at the North Station and set up machine guns. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Japan instigated the bandit Bao Shanyi to lead more than 2,000 bandits to attack Tongliao. Last night, a conflict occurred with Zhang Shusen's 12th Brigade of the Northeast Cavalry stationed in Tongliao. Station employees have fled to safety. The station's power lines have been cut by the bandits. (3rd special dispatch)</p>

<h3>Jiangqiao Starts Repair</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Commander Issues Serious Warning</p>
<p>Harbin, the Jiangqiao Bridge on the Tao'ang Road was bombed and is now being repaired. The Russian and American flags are raised at the work site to prevent Japanese aircraft from bombing. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo, the Japanese military commander in Manchuria stated today that Ma Zhanshan, the acting chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, has not fulfilled his promise to repair the Nenjiang Bridge on the Tao'ang Road. Therefore, the Japanese military commander intends to send an engineering team protected by the army to the site on November 4 to immediately carry out the necessary repairs. It is reported that this bridge was destroyed by the Heilongjiang Provincial Army to prevent Zhang Haipeng's troops from attacking. It is now heard that the Japanese military commander, in order to avoid the possibility of conflict, has requested Ma Zhanshan and Zhang Haipeng to withdraw their troops from the bridgehead by two kilometers each during the repair work. At the same time, a warning was issued that if any party obstructs the repair work, the Japanese soldiers will take any necessary action. According to another message, the Japanese military commander has warned both parties that they must not use this bridge for strategic purposes in the future. This road was built with Japanese loans, and the principal and interest have not been paid to date. He cannot allow the traffic on this road to be stopped again. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Haipeng</p>
<h3>Forced to Invade Heilongjiang Province Again</h3>

<p>Zhang Receives Huge Sums of Money from the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Harbin, on the 2nd, Zhang Haipeng led his recruited Mongolian army to occupy Tai'an Town on the Tao'ang Road. Two Japanese aircraft, one armored train, and 300 soldiers accompanied him as cover. The traffic on the Tao'ang Road was cut off again today. This morning, three Japanese aircraft scouted the Tao'ang line for a long time. Ma Zhanshan ordered the newly formed First Brigade and Wu Songshan</p>
<p>Bai Li'an Sends a Letter to Fang Ze Refuting the Japanese Statement. Ling Yinqing's Bandit Troops Surrounded and Disarmed by the Northeast Army.

Russia and the United States Suffer Crop Failures (See Foreign Important News). Chen Mingshu Arrives in Shanghai (See Local News).</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>The brigade retreated to hold El'erge. Zhang Haipeng's rebel army feared the Heilongjiang army's strength and did not dare to approach. Zhang has received millions of Japanese gold and ten thousand guns from the Japanese side before and after. He was forced by the Japanese to invade Heilongjiang. If he does not disturb Heilongjiang, he will be ordered to repay the loan. Because Zhang's guns and money were scattered and he could not respond, he had no choice but to disturb Heilongjiang again. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin, on the 2nd at noon, a Japanese aircraft flew over the Tao'ang Road to scout. It dropped leaflets over the Wu Songshan Brigade's camp, saying that no matter how the League of Nations decides, we must achieve the cooperation of the five races of Japan, Korea, Manchuria, Mongolia, and Han. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin, on the 31st at noon, Zhang Haipeng led the regimental commander to inspect the artillery shells transported by the Japanese side. He mistakenly moved the medicine line, detonating it and killing Xu Wenlong, the commander of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and 24 soldiers. Zhang Haipeng appointed his brother, Pengfei, to succeed as the commander of the 2nd Regiment. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin, on the 1st in the morning, a Japanese troop train carrying 300 soldiers and four cannons arrived in Taonan but had not yet disembarked. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Northeast Reception Committee</p>
<h3>Established in Prince Shuncheng's Mansion</h3>
<p>Beiping, the committee for receiving various places in Northeast China has been established in Prince Shuncheng's Mansion. After the National Government notified the various member states of the League of Nations, the various countries have sent replies to Beijing expressing their approval. The four countries of England, France, Italy, and Spain have also agreed to send one representative each to participate. These candidates are planned to be selected from the staff of the embassies in China. (3rd special dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Government</p>
<h3>Pays Attention to Propaganda in the United States</h3>
<p>Beiping, because American public opinion is not good towards Japan, Japan has recently made great efforts in propaganda.

(3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese People in Various Places</p>
<h3>Prepare to Provoke on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Practice Street Fighting in Tianjin</p>
<p>Beiping, Japan plans to carry out provocative acts simultaneously in various important cities of our country on the 5th of this month, hoping to expand the situation in order to find an excuse to delay the withdrawal of troops. In fact, on the Yangtze River, the Japanese Navy has been preparing for combat recently. It is also heard that the Japanese army has requested the Heilongjiang Provincial Government to repair the Jiangqiao Bridge five days ago, otherwise the Japanese residents will repair it on their behalf, etc. Judging from this, the saying that a large-scale provocation will be launched on the 5th may not be without reason. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin have recently intensified training and held dawn street fighting. According to the urgent news revealed by the Japanese military department, the Army Ministry secretly ordered the Japanese troops and veterans in various places to take provocative actions in various places on the 5th as an excuse for delaying the withdrawal of troops, and also telegraphed the Heilongjiang Provincial Government to repair the Jiangqiao Bridge before the 5th, otherwise the Japanese army will repair it on their behalf. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Doi's Mission to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Beiping, it is rumored that Doi secretly arrived in Tianjin to invite Pu Yi to Shenyang to organize a so-called independent government. It is still uncertain whether Pu can be a meritorious subject. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Continue to Increase in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Helping Kan Zhaoxi Establish Three Divisions</p>
<p>Beiping, Japanese soldiers have been seen increasing in Shenyang in recent days. It is heard that they are being transported from Korea. The atrocities are expanding without end.

<p>Beiping, the Japanese in Shenyang have ordered 10,000 five-colored flags from various cloth shops.

The Japanese still dream of the independence of the Northeast in order to achieve their ambition of annexation. (3rd special dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Japan plans to help Kan Zhaoxi establish a force of three divisions within two weeks as a reactionary step, so that Kan and others can disturb the public order. Therefore, the difficulties in receiving the Northeast in the future will be heavy. (3rd special dispatch)</p>

<p>Andong Customs</p>
<h3>Forced to Cancel Consolidated Tax</h3>
<p>Harbin, the Japanese army forced the Andong Customs to cancel the consolidated tax and signed the following agreement: (1) All goods that land from ships in the Mantetsu-affiliated area, are unloaded from trains, or are imported are exempt from consolidated tax.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Arms Truce and Disarmament</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Council passed a resolution on a one-year arms truce. Thirty-six countries have now accepted it, and people in the League of Nations are extremely optimistic about this. It is claimed that this case has the effect of preventing the expansion of armaments in various countries. Even if the disarmament conference next year is unsuccessful, this truce is expected to be extended for five years. The people in the League of Nations are optimistic about this, but in our observation, if the disarmament conference next year is unsuccessful, then this one-year truce agreement will have very little effect. Also, if the newly emerging Sino-Japanese issue is not resolved, then not only will the disarmament conference next year not need to be held, but this one-year truce agreement may not be equal to zero. Therefore, the key to the success or failure of world peace is not the superficial arms truce, but whether the countries of the League of Nations have the power to curb the violent Japan.</p>
<p>According to news from Geneva, the League of Nations is considering convening a meeting earlier than November 16 due to the deteriorating situation in Manchuria. This shows that the League of Nations is earnestly hoping for a resolution to this issue and is not at ease. However, it is still not possible for us to predict whether they have a definite plan in mind. The Soviet Union's comments on the arms truce state that "the various resolutions of the League of Nations on international obligations are often vague and unrealistic, and are one of the reasons for the tragic events in Manchuria today. This phenomenon clearly cannot enhance the atmosphere of trust." This statement is most likely to promote the League of Nations' awareness. However, if the League of Nations knows that the situation in Manchuria is getting worse, then it will definitely make more efforts to avoid affecting the disarmament next year. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>The Italian Forum newspaper discussed the United States' acceptance of the arms truce case and linked the US government's attitude towards disarmament with the Sino-Japanese Manchurian issue, saying that "the United States' acceptance of the arms truce is extremely important. Japan's activities in Manchuria will naturally make the United States feel like expanding its navy." Now that the US government wants to complete disarmament, and President Hoover has paid attention to the people who will attend the disarmament conference next year and has selected Senator Bola, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it can be seen that he attaches importance to disarmament. The Manchurian issue, which is important enough to destroy disarmament, can also be seen. The Forum newspaper's discussion is very important.</p>

<p>Beiyang Institute of Technology</p>
<h3>Teachers and Students are Fasting for the Country</h3>
<p>Wang Jixu's Fast is Critical</p>
<p>Students Go to Provincial Government to Petition</p>
<p>Tianjin, Wang Jixu, the acting president of Beiyang Institute of Technology, inspected the city's student volunteer army on the morning of the 1st. Because the schools were suppressed by forces, most of the school volunteer armies failed to gather, with only five or six hundred people arriving. Extremely saddened and angered, he began fasting from that day and telegraphed the Shanghai Peace Conference that he would resume eating on the day of the successful peaceful unification. The telegram was copied by a friend at the telegraph bureau to Sun Jingshan, the director of the institute's affairs. The entire faculty and students were shocked and urged Wang to eat, but Wang refused. He was fasting until all the students cried and begged him. Wang finally admitted it, but asked them to keep it secret, not to stop him, and to help him. He also gave a speech saying that saving the country depends on industry, learning industry, and those who work hard in industry are all dear comrades. He hopes everyone will save the country and protect the territory. The students wept bitterly when they heard this, and decided to fast collectively to urge Wang to resume eating, and telegraphed the Ministry of Education, President Cai, and the Shanghai Peace Conference, saying that Wang, the acting president, is fasting after seeing the difficulties of the times and has been fasting for two days. The entire student body has decided that if they are not saved, they will die together. Now, the faculty and staff are crying and begging, and his intention to be pessimistic has not been dispelled. They earnestly ask for a reply to comfort him and prevent a major tragedy from happening. This is the utmost prayer. This telegram was drafted at noon on the 2nd and sent out on the evening of the 2nd. At noon on the 2nd, the students sealed the dining hall and kitchen, and sent 11 representatives to see Wang. Wang had not eaten for two days and had not slept for two nights. When he saw the students, he cried loudly, and the students also cried loudly. On the evening of the 2nd, the students held an emergency meeting and decided to go to the provincial government to petition on the morning of the 3rd. The faculty and staff also held a meeting and urgently telegraphed Dr. Zhuo, the institute's doctor, to examine him. According to him, his condition is critical, with signs of cerebral congestion. He was delirious all night on the 2nd and did not sleep. On the 3rd, he cried bitterly when he saw people. After the teachers and students cried and begged him again and again, Wang could not bear to die for the country with the students and reluctantly ate two spoonfuls of thin porridge at noon on the 3rd. The students began to eat in the afternoon. Wang has not yet escaped danger after Dr. Zhuo gave him an injection and medication. Later, the students found half of a death poem in Wang's bedroom. Because his mind was confused, he could not complete the poem. The poem says: Longevity is called a hundred years, I have lived half my life. Recalling my youth, past events are like melting ice. The world is full of ups and downs, and my heart is also chaotic. Everywhere there are winds and waves, and every year the stars and frosts change. My dear mother is always healthy, and my virtue is praised. The source is indeed far-reaching, and success or failure is determined by people. The rush cart has not welcomed me, and my brothers are scattered. At 11:00 AM on the 3rd, more than 500 student representatives went to the provincial government and the education hall in two teams to petition. They expressed sympathy for the institute's teachers and students' alliance to fast and save the country. Wang Shuchang and Chen Baoquan received them, doing their best to comfort them and earnestly persuade them to resume eating, and accepted the students' request to telegraph Chiang and Zhang to quickly save the country. The provincial government and the education hall each sent representatives to the institute in the afternoon to comfort all the teachers and students. The institute's alumni association heard the news on the evening of the 2nd and held an emergency meeting, deciding to send Zhang Qiaosheng and Zhang Chuofu to comfort the teachers and students and urge them to resume eating, and sent letters to newspapers in Beiping, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, urging the Peace Conference to complete quickly.

<p>Financial Authorities</p>
<h3>Will Overdraw from Banks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, according to reliable sources, the government's finances have recently been slightly strained. It may be possible to overdraw several million from various banks to barely cope with the current situation. In the previous two months, there were surpluses available for military and political expenses due to the pledged and converted value of the consolidated tax bonds and salt tax bonds. However, this month, it will rely entirely on overdrafts. Moreover, because the peace negotiations have not yet been concluded, it is inconvenient to issue new domestic debt. However, in the future, in order to repay the overdrafts of various banks, it will be necessary to issue a new type of bond again. It is heard that the Anglo-German gold loan from the Jiawu year has been fully repaid for thirty years, and in February of next year, tens of thousands of dollars of unmortgaged funds can be released from the monthly customs revenue as collateral for new debt. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Proposed</p>
<h3>Collection of Tariff Surcharges</h3>
<p>Allocated to Disaster Relief and Repayment of Wheat Prices</p>
<p>Nanjing, the government first issued 30 million yuan of disaster relief bonds, but because the Shenyang Incident occurred, the market value of the bonds fell and it was not easy to raise more. It was specially proposed to the Central Political Committee to levy a 10% surcharge on the current tariff rates from December 1st to the end of July of the following year, specifically to be allocated for disaster relief. From August 1st of the following year, it will be reduced to a 5% surcharge, specifically to repay the principal and interest of the American wheat loan until it is repaid. It is verified that the purchased American wheat is 450,000 tons with an interest rate of 4%, and interest will be paid on June 30th and December 31st of each year. The American wheat loan will be repaid in three installments, with one-third paid in each installment. The first installment is at the end of 1934, the second installment is at the end of 1935, and the third installment is at the end of 1936. The wheat price for each installment is based on the market price on the date the bill of lading is issued at the port of shipment. Each time China receives American wheat, the National Government will pay the wheat purchase IOU. This temporary IOU will be merged into three copies of the total IOU and will be collected each time the principal is repaid. It is verified that the first principal repayment period is still three years away. It is estimated that the government can fully repay all the principal and interest after implementing the tariff surcharge. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Huai Lake Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Nanjing, the conference on returning farmland to lakes and diverting the Huai River into the sea held its first general meeting on the morning of the 3rd. Cai Pei, the representative of the Ministry of Communications, chaired the meeting and resolved one principle regarding returning farmland to lakes: A. Sandy fields, beaches, and lake fields that obstruct the downstream flow of ordinary floods and encroach on the storage areas required for ordinary floods should all be abolished. B. Sandy fields and lakes should be retained except for those that should be abolished as stipulated in item A. The implementation methods are: 1. The Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Industry, and Ministry of Communications should jointly submit a report to the Executive Yuan to instruct the relevant agencies to temporarily suspend the disposal of lake, sandbar, and beach lands. 2. The Ministry of Interior should notify the provincial governments and water conservancy management agencies to quickly jointly survey and determine the area. 3. The Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Industry, and Ministry of Communications should quickly draft a water law. Before the water law is formulated, the Ministry of Interior should first draft a flood prevention law. 4. Before items 2 and 3 are completed, the water conservancy management agency should first ban those sandy fields, lake fields, and beaches that obviously obstruct the water flow. Those involving more than two provinces should be handled jointly. 5. After the river, lake, and beach lands are studied by the water conservancy management agency and deemed to obstruct water flow or storage, reclamation should be strictly prohibited. 2. Regarding diverting the Huai River into the sea, those who advocate first doing the river-entry project and those who advocate first doing the sea-entry project should each submit a general opinion within three days to the Ministry of Interior, which will then be jointly submitted by the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Industry, and Ministry of Communications to the Executive Yuan for adoption and implementation. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM in the afternoon after the discussion. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jiaoji Railway</p>
<h3>Coal Merchant Strike</h3>
<p>Negotiations Fail to Produce Results</p>
<p>Jinan, coal merchants along the Jiaoji Railway are still on strike today. The provincial government's standing committee discussed the case and decided to telegraph the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to Jinan to jointly investigate, deliberate, verify, and handle the matter with personnel sent by the provincial government. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qingdao, after the mine coal merchants went on strike, representatives came to Qingdao on the 2nd to meet with the railway bureau to discuss solutions. Several consultations failed to produce results. It is heard that the two sides will file a lawsuit due to the issue of responsibility. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, regarding the Jiaoji Railway coal transport price increase incident, according to sources from the railway side, the Zibo mine merchants have always had the most capital in the Lu Da and Boshan mines. The mining rights of the Lu Da mine have always been controlled by the Japanese. The Jiaoji coal transport price increase was originally set at 20%. The merchants had previously agreed to increase the price of coal sold domestically. As for the coal for export, a fair freight rate was set separately from November, with an increase of 28 cents per ton, only slightly more than the previous 2 yuan and 52 cents. Currently, the price of Lu coal is particularly high during the period of resisting Japanese coal, which will not affect sales. The reason for the mine merchants' strike is not due to the price increase, but because the mine workers' wages are increasing daily and the mining volume is decreasing daily. They want to take this opportunity to reduce workers and wages by striking and stopping mining to reorganize. Its effect is very tortuous. Although the amount of coal produced in the mines is not much, it does not affect transportation and sales. There are still more than 200,000 tons waiting to be transported in Qingdao. If Shanghai merchants raise ships as much as possible to send to the market on the one hand, and the mine merchants transport the coal from the railway to Qingdao to go south on the other hand, it will never be interrupted.

<h3>Armaments Truce Proposal</h3>
<p>Effective for One Year from the First of This Month</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Considers it Vague and Impractical</p>
<p>Notified the League of Nations with Reservations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 2nd: The one-year armaments truce proposal passed by the League of Nations Council a few days ago has been notified of acceptance by 36 countries. Several other countries have also assured the Secretariat that they will accept it. Therefore, it has been recognized today that the proposal became effective yesterday. People in the League of Nations are extremely optimistic about this, claiming that the effect of a one-year truce is no less than freezing each country's existing armaments, preventing further expansion. Even if the World Disarmament Conference next year fails to achieve substantial reductions in armaments, it is expected that this truce can be extended for at least five years. This time, only Soviet Russia accepted the proposal with reservations, refusing to accept the gentlemen's agreement, saying that although the Russian government agreed to the armaments truce, it firmly insisted on establishing an understanding that the proposal has the binding force of an international convention, and that the League of Nations' various resolutions on international obligations are often vague and impractical, which is one of the reasons for the tragic events in Manchuria today. This phenomenon obviously cannot increase the atmosphere of trust. However, people in the League of Nations still believe that these reservations are not enough to undermine the effectiveness of the proposal. According to the notification telegrams received by the League of Nations Secretariat today from member states accepting the proposal, they include Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Finland, Chile, Canada, India, Ireland, Romania, and other countries. The purpose of this proposal is to help the world stop the global economic panic and promote world peace.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 2nd: Today, the local Tribune commented on the United States' acceptance of the armaments truce proposal, linking the US government's attitude towards disarmament with the Sino-Japanese Liaoning and Jilin disputes, saying that the United States' acceptance of the armaments truce is extremely important. Japan's activities in Manchuria naturally make the United States want to expand its navy, so this move shows that the US government recognizes that disarmament is above all else.

<h3>Compatriots Face Another Calamity</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Mexico City, 2nd: The newly appointed Governor of the Northern District of Baja California, Mexico, Clereza, is a well-known anti-Chinese person. When he was the Governor of the Southern District of the state, he vigorously implemented a strict national rights policy and tried his best to exclude overseas Chinese. Today, he told representatives of the press that after he takes office, he will continue his previous policies. He was very successful in excluding overseas Chinese during his previous term, and there are still only two overseas Chinese left in the territory. In view of this, overseas Chinese in Mexico will face another calamity.</p>
<h3>British City Election Results</h3>
<p>Conservative Party Still Holds a Large Advantage</p>
<p>New Cabinet List to be Released Soon</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: City elections in more than 300 cities in England and Wales were held yesterday. The results of 80 cities have been released at midnight. The Conservative Party still holds a large advantage, just like in the parliamentary elections.

<h3>Hungarian Cabinet Prepares to Resign En Masse</h3>
<p>Authorities Deny Restoration Rumors</p>
<p>Pro-French Policy to be Changed</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 2nd: Recently, there have been rumors that a Pan-Hungarian Party revolution will occur in Hungary, saying that the purpose of the revolution is the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty. Now, the Hungarian authorities have officially denied this rumor, saying that the rumors are unfounded and that their intention is to reduce Hungary's credibility and create an unstable atmosphere in Southern Europe. Although the Hungarian authorities said so, the situation in Hungary is indeed trending towards drastic changes. Today's newspaper reported that Hungarian Prime Minister Count Karolyi and his entire cabinet will resign en masse tomorrow or the day after, preparing to give way to a new government of (foreign reactionaries). The leader of the so-called (foreign reactionaries) is Gong Boshi, the current Minister of Defense and leader of the Pan-Hungarian Party. Gong has always opposed Prime Minister Karolyi's pro-French policy and is willing to cooperate with Italy.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Poor Harvest</h3>
<p>Wheat Prices Soar in American Markets</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Reuters) — News that Russia's poor harvest may prevent it from exporting wheat this year or next has had a significant impact on markets in Winnipeg, Canada, and Chicago, USA. According to dispatches from these two locations today, the wheat market has transformed into a lively state, with export prices skyrocketing, delighting farmers. The news of Russia's poor wheat harvest originated in Paris. A telegram from Moscow this morning, however, claimed that the earlier reports were exaggerated, stating that Russia's drought had resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of poods of wheat (each pood equals 36 pounds), but that the harvest of other grains was comparable to last year. Nevertheless, the price of wheat in Winnipeg has risen sharply, exceeding seven Canadian dollars per bushel in the past few days, a level unseen in the past year. The financial position of Canadian wheat farmers, based on today's market prices, has increased by millions of dollars compared to September.</p>

<h3>Optimistic Prospects for Sino-British Trade</h3>
<p>Sir Fox's Speech</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Reuters) — Sir Fox, former Commercial Counselor at the British Legation in Peking, delivered a speech today at a meeting of the Imperial Association, discussing Sino-British trade. Sir Fox expressed optimism about commerce between the two countries and anticipated significant growth in the future. He believed that the loss of extraterritorial rights for Britain in China would not cause British businesses to cease operations. Furthermore, he advocated that once the difficulties are overcome, British trade with China will enter a period of unprecedented prosperity, with potential for continuous growth. Sir Fox also stated that Britain must treat the Chinese as customers, fostering goodwill and understanding their purchasing desires. The Chinese government must protect the lives and property of foreigners, faithfully implement commercial laws, and safeguard the interests of foreign investors. Sir Fox concluded by noting that Chinese merchants have traditionally been known for their high moral standards, and he hoped that they would strongly enforce contracts with foreign firms when encountering unscrupulous merchants who disregard their reputation.</p>
<h3>Significant U.S. Cash Exports</h3>
<p>New York, 2nd (Reuters) — The amount of cash exported from the United States in October was extremely large, with a value of no less than $439 million. Never before has a country's cash outflow been so great in such a short period. However, the Federal Reserve Bank's gold reserves remain substantial, exceeding the legal currency reserve by $100 million.</p>
<p>Osaka, 3rd (Reuters) — The Yokohama Specie Bank will ship ¥15 million in cash to the United States from Kobe on Wednesday of this week. Since October 1st, including this shipment, the total value of Japanese cash shipped to the United States amounts to ¥150 million.</p>
<h3>Earthquake Losses in Kyushu, Japan</h3>
<p>Conflicting Reports in Eastern Newspapers</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Reuters) — A fairly strong earthquake struck Kyushu last night at 7:00 PM, and reports of the damage vary considerably. Some say the disaster was widespread, while others claim the damage was limited to a very small area. The Jiji and Hochi newspapers report 200 houses collapsed and approximately 1,000 deaths. However, the Asahi Shimbun states that only a dozen or so houses collapsed, with only a few casualties. Additionally, it reports that today is a national holiday, so official figures on earthquake damage in Kyushu are unavailable. However, according to the latest newspaper reports, casualties are only about a dozen or so, although material losses may be slightly heavier. Houses were damaged, factory chimneys collapsed, roads cracked, and transportation was disrupted. The earthquake occurred during the residents' evening bathing time, causing many men and women to run naked into the streets.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Instigates</h3>
<p>Xi Qia Lobbies Ji Zhang</p>
<p>Promoting Direct Negotiations in Exchange for the Return of Private Property</p>
<p>Japanese Army Forcibly Takes Over the Jilin-Heilongjiang Salt Transport Bureau</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Japanese Army Disturbances in Jilin City</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence Since the League of Nations began paying attention to the Northeast Incident, Japan has been extremely eager to engage in direct negotiations with the Northeast authorities. The Japanese division commander stationed in Changchun, Tamon, instructed Xi Qia to send personnel to Beiping to privately lobby Zhang Zuoxiang, advocating three fallacies: (1) League of Nations resolutions are unreliable; (2) the prolonged occupation of the Northeast by the Japanese army, coupled with the rise of bandits, would lead to local chaos that would be impossible to rectify in the future; and (3) the private property of various key figures would inevitably be lost over time. If they were willing to engage in direct negotiations, the Japanese side could return it. Xi Qia, following these instructions, dispatched Councilor Qi Zhizheng to Beiping to visit Zhang. The reason the Japanese instructed Xi to solely lobby Zhang Zuoxiang was that after Xi Qia assumed the role of puppet governor, he became preoccupied with personal gains and losses, fearing that once the Japanese army withdrew, he would not be tolerated by the Chinese people and would be unable to face Zhang. Moreover, at the beginning of his assumption of the puppet post, Xi Qia repeatedly sent his confidants to Beiping to meet with Zhang Zuoxiang, seeking his understanding, stating that taking over the governorship and reorganizing the situation was a last resort. Zhang Zuoxiang, being of a generous nature, not only did not hate Xi but also sent a letter of comfort, urging him to proceed boldly in maintaining the difficult situation. This matter was handled with utmost secrecy by Xi Qia, but it still could not be concealed from the Japanese. Therefore, since October 25th, the Japanese army has intensified its surveillance of Xi and ordered the cancellation of Xi's South Mansion, merging it into the North Mansion for easier surveillance. Commander Tsuboi of the Security Command also met with Xi on the 25th, enumerating Xi's improprieties, stating that he should not communicate with the old authorities. Xi was quite uneasy about this. Within a few days, the Japanese simply followed through with the situation, actually having Tamon instigate Xi to lobby Zhang. Whether Zhang can be moved to action remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Jilin-Heilongjiang Salt Transport Bureau in Changchun is the general sales organization for salt affairs in northern Manchuria. On the 26th of this month, Xi Qia sent Councilor Wei Zonglian, accompanied by 50 Japanese soldiers, to forcibly take over the old bureau. The former director refused to hand over his duties because he did not have an order from the Salt Transport Commissioner. As a result, the Japanese army sealed the office, and the Chinese and foreign auditors were expelled. The bureau's staff continues to work under the surveillance of Japanese soldiers. It is said that the Japanese army strictly forced Xi Qia to carry out this action for two reasons: one was to cut off Beiping's source of revenue, and the other was to seize salt revenues to fund the Japanese army. Since the establishment of the puppet governor's office, the Jilin provincial treasury has been completely looted by the Japanese army. The area under the puppet governor's control is extremely small, and the income from just a few counties is insufficient to cover the government's and military's expenses. The Jilin-Heilongjiang Salt Transport Bureau's monthly income is over 700,000, a substantial amount, so the Japanese army is taking advantage of Xi Qia's hand to seize it. However, the surplus salt revenues have always been related to foreign debt guarantees. The consuls of various interested countries stationed in Harbin, upon hearing of this matter, considered it a major incident and sent telegrams to their ministers in Beiping to report the truth. U.S. Consul Hanson in Harbin even visited Japanese Consul-General Ohashi Chui on the 28th, inquiring about the reasons for destroying the salt revenue debt guarantees. Ohashi replied that the matter was being handled by the Jilin Governor's Office and had nothing to do with the Japanese army. Hanson then asked why Japanese soldiers were stationed inside the Salt Transport Bureau. Ohashi replied that it was to prevent conflicts between the new and old authorities. Hanson was quite dissatisfied and has already sent a detailed telegram to the minister in Beiping.</p>
<p>Xi Qia is extremely uneasy because the troops stationed in various locations do not obey his puppet orders. Therefore, he is not issuing military and government expenses to suppress the rebellious military and government organs in various locations. Currently, apart from the Yanbian area and the Jidun, Jihai, and Jichang railway lines, where local organs have been forced to support Xi Qia, the military and government leaders in Harbin and other locations are adopting flexible methods, intercepting tax revenues locally for temporary sustenance. The Harbin Diplomatic Office, having not received government expenses for two months, has recently borrowed money from banks.</p>
<p>Xi Qia recently appointed Yang Dengju, the former commander of the 2nd Jilin Cavalry Brigade, as the commander of the railway defense force, recruiting bandits to form three infantry battalions, each with a machine gun platoon and a mortar platoon, stationed along the Jidun and other three railway lines. However, recruiting soldiers is very difficult. Therefore, he sent Guan Rongshen, the commander of the security corps, to Qucaihe to recruit the notorious bandit Dian Chen, offering him the position of battalion commander. Dian Chen has 600 men, and his hopes lie in becoming a brigade commander. Therefore, the negotiations between the two sides have been prolonged without a resolution.</p>
<p>Since the 21st, the Japanese army in Jilin has retreated outside the city to Lianhuapao. The headquarters of the Kenpeitai (military police) detachment, the command headquarters of the Amano Brigade, and the security command headquarters under Tsuboi are still located in the city. Every day at 4:00 PM, a large detachment of Japanese troops still enters the city fully armed to patrol the streets. The soldiers go out day and night to harass and rape women, paying particular attention to the Women's Normal School. Therefore, there are daily disturbances at the school, which has announced its closure, and students dare not reside on campus. The Japanese army's inspection of government offices is very strict, and all books in bookstores are sealed and not allowed to be sold. Newspaper censorship is also severe. The Jilin-Changchun Daily recently published an article stating that a Japanese army hired a Chinese spy, wearing a specific uniform with a name tag, who could stamp documents to mobilize troops in case of trouble. This was seen by the Kenpeitai inspection office, which severely criticized the newspaper and almost punished its employees. Therefore, the newspaper now dares not publish any news from the Japanese side. All valuable items in the residences of important figures have been moved away by the Japanese army. Even a small spittoon from Zhang Zuoxiang's private residence has been packed and taken away. (October 29th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Destroys Shenyang Telecommunications Facilities</h3>
<p>Shenyang Special Dispatch, 2nd (Great American Evening News) — Although Japan has declared to Washington and Geneva that the radio stations here that communicate with the United States and Germany will soon be reconnected, in reality, there is no hope of achieving this in the near future. The reporter personally investigated the two stations and found them heavily guarded, with Japanese soldiers digging trenches and fortifying the gates. According to a Westerner familiar with telecommunications here, all the important components of the two stations have been stolen. If repairs are to be made, they cannot be purchased locally and must be ordered from Germany and the United States, which will take several weeks to ship. In addition, the long-wave and short-wave radio stations that communicate with various locations within the country have been completely destroyed and cannot be repaired for at least a year. The recent statement by the Japanese military authorities that they have dispatched a Japanese advisor to reconnect the stations is simply untrue. The radio receiving and transmitting office in the city is in the same state, currently occupied by the Japanese army and guarded by three or four coolies, but their wages have not been paid since the Manchurian Incident. Currently, Chinese wired telegraph and telephone lines have been cut off, and all incoming and outgoing telegrams must go through Japanese lines, subject to strict inspection by the Japanese army.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships Arrive in Hankou for Demonstration</h3>
<p>Circular Fortifications Built at Street Corners in the Japanese Concession</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence Since the Shenyang Incident, Japanese warships have continued to arrive in Hankou for demonstrations. As of recently, there have been six warships in total, including the second-class cruiser Hirato, the first-class destroyer Urakaze, the second-class destroyer No. 24, the second-class gunboat Hozu, the reconnaissance ship Kotaka, and the Hira. The Urakaze and Hozu are stationed at piers 5 and 6 in the Second Special District, while the rest are stationed in the Japanese concession on the river. A few days ago, the Hozu sailed away, and the Hinoki arrived in Hankou, maintaining a total of six ships. The number of troops carried on each ship is unknown, but the largest, the Hirato, is certainly 7,000 to 8,000 tons in size, carrying heavy artillery with a caliber of 28 cm, and smaller ones also carry heavy artillery with a caliber of 12 cm. It is also said that the Japanese Army Ministry, in order to increase the strength of the Japanese Volunteer Corps, has transported a large number of firearms, artillery, bombs, and other items on warships to be distributed to various locations, and has additionally dispatched the Seta, Ataka, and Tone ships to Hankou, concentrating their forces, creating a tense and aggressive atmosphere. Sandbags have long been piled up and electric fences erected at various street corners in the Japanese concession. On the 1st of this month, a circular fortress five feet high was built with sandbags at the Chengzhong Street intersection. Japanese ruffians and Korean residents have repeatedly provoked Chinese people, but they have not succeeded because we have not engaged with them. According to information obtained by a certain organization, as a result of soliciting opinions from Japanese consuls stationed in various parts of China, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has decided to implement its gunboat policy by resorting to violence in Shanghai, Hankou, and Xiamen. This is confirmed by the provocative behavior of the Japanese residents, which is not without reason. At the same time, the Japanese military and civilians have even more blatant expressions, holding gatherings three times a week and conducting tactical exercises late at night. On the morning of the 1st, a so-called "Military-Civilian Joint Joy and Comforting Meeting" was held at the River Street Naval Assembly Hall, attended by over 500 people, including Consul Sakane of Hankou, Naval Attaché Sunga, all officers and men, as well as Consul Kiyono of Chongqing, Consul Abe of Chengdu, and Consul Tanaka of Zhengzhou. The meeting dispersed at 2:00 PM. It is generally speculated that it is closely related to the Residents' Conference in the Yangtze River Basin held in Shanghai. Upon investigation, the Japanese have dispatched warships, expanded military preparations, erected electric fences, and built fortresses, all in the name of protecting Japanese residents. However, many of their residents in Hankou have already returned to their country. The total number of residents remaining in Hankou and those coming to Hankou from Chengdu, Wanxian, Chongqing, and Zhengzhou is no more than 1,000, and all have been organized into volunteer corps. These people, affected by the stagnation of industry and commerce, have many grievances against their government. In order to win them over, the Japanese concession authorities are providing residents with food and vegetables from warships, investigating and compensating for business losses in cash, and exempting all house rents. In addition, Koreans are also given a monthly ration of eight yuan, specifically for the purpose of provoking trouble (November 1st).</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang and Gu Weijun Return to Beiping</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence Deputy Commander Zhang left Beiping for Nanjing on the 29th</p>
<p>To meet Chiang Kai-shek and seek concrete measures for recovering lost territory in the Northeast. He returned north by Ford plane from Nanjing at 10:45 AM yesterday. Gu Weijun, Liu Zhe, and two staff members accompanied him. The reporter, upon hearing the news, took a car to Qinghe Airport. At 4:05 PM, a plane suddenly appeared in the southwestern sky, shaped like a small bird, flying lower and lower, circling down in the center of the airport. At 4:10 PM, it landed safely. After Zhang and others got off the plane, they joined Tang Guozhen, the deputy chief of staff of the headquarters, and Tan Hai, the adjutant general, who were waiting at the airport. They boarded car number 163 and drove towards the city. At 4:40 PM, they entered Deshengmen, and at 4:50 PM, they arrived at Prince Shuncheng's Mansion. Zhang immediately went inside to rest. Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, Bao Yulin, Zhang Xueming, and others had already gathered at Prince Shuncheng's Mansion to await an audience. The reporter requested an audience with Zhang at 4:50 PM, but Zhang said that he felt dizzy from the fatigue of traveling by plane and could not engage in a long conversation. He only stated that his trip to Nanjing was in response to a telegram from Chairman Chiang, seeking concrete measures for recovering lost territory in the Northeast, and that he had obtained considerable results. He had originally planned to return to Beiping yesterday but temporarily changed his plans to return today due to a stomach ailment. He planned to schedule another meeting to discuss the details of his trip to Nanjing. At 6:00 PM, the reporter visited Mr. Gu Weijun. According to Mr. Gu, the central government believes that the diplomatic situation with Japan is extremely serious, and in order to deal with it cautiously, it has organized a special diplomatic committee with members from both the government and the central party headquarters, dedicated to discussing and studying the Northeast Incident. Mr. Gu went to Nanjing on the 11th of last month and has been there for exactly three weeks. The special committee has held a meeting once a day, except for the 2nd, with attendance ranging from 20 to 30 people, discussing and determining the outline of concrete measures. However, due to the large number of people at the meeting, small groups were formed to draft detailed plans based on the resolutions. Each small group also met twice a day. In case of diplomatic emergencies, such as when the League of Nations Council was in session and Representative Shih and the League of Nations sent urgent telegrams to Nanjing daily, the small groups would first decide on a course of action and reply, then submit it to the meeting for discussion the following day. Deputy Commander Zhang's trip to Nanjing was due to the League of Nations Council's resolution on the 24th. Representative Shih has formally accepted the resolution on behalf of the National Government. The National Government, in order to respect the League of Nations resolution and the hopes of various countries, is also willing to fully implement the League of Nations Council resolution. The matters that the Chinese government should implement and the obligations it should bear according to the methods stipulated in the League of Nations resolution should be actively promoted. In order to fulfill these obligations, such as organizing a reception committee and protecting the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in the Northeast, the central government and local authorities must have thorough consultations so that the central government can understand the local situation and proceed frankly. Therefore, a telegram was sent to Deputy Commander Zhang, requesting him to go to Nanjing for detailed discussions to avoid the back and forth of telegrams. With the League of Nations meeting approaching on November 16th, there are many things the National Government needs to do. The general approach to the reception problem has been discussed, and the details are still being studied. Once the final decision is made, it will be officially announced. The Eastern Province Incident is no longer a simple issue between China and Japan, but an issue between China and the League of Nations, and, broadly speaking, an issue between the world and Japan. The attitude of the League of Nations was quite vague on September 30th, but on October 24th, it began to express itself concretely. On the Chinese side, we hope that the League of Nations resolution will be realized, and the League of Nations, having already made a resolution, wants to do its best to make it actually effective. Before November 16th, China and the League of Nations are working together. Regarding the peace conference being held in Shanghai, related parties have indicated that a satisfactory resolution can be obtained within a considerable period of time. Because of the importance of the affairs in Nanjing, I will still go to Nanjing within the next few days. The reporter also asked if it was true that the government would invite Mr. Gu to serve as foreign minister, as reported in the newspapers. Mr. Gu replied that he had not heard of it.

<h3>Gu Yingfen Passes Away in Guangzhou Due to Illness</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence Recently, Central Supervisory Committee member Gu Yingfen suffered from dental disease and had a tooth extracted by a Western dentist. In recent days, he also felt feverish. On the 26th, his condition became serious and he consulted Drs. Baker and Parker of the Medical School of Zhongda University. Blood tests revealed streptococci in his blood, which was found to have originated from the tooth extraction site (commonly known as "blood poisoning"). The Western doctor used the latest method to culture the bacteria from Gu's blood and injected it back into Gu's body. The first injection was stopped immediately for fear of an excessive reaction. Then a metallic liquid was injected again, but the reaction was very strong, so it was no longer continued. On the morning of the 28th, the condition seemed to improve and the fever decreased sharply. He was still able to read the newspaper at 9:00 AM, but by about 2:00 PM that afternoon, his condition changed again. At this time, Gu's body temperature suddenly dropped to an extremely low level. This kind of abnormality was diagnosed by the Western doctors as hopeless. Drs. Baker and Parker only injected cardiac stimulants. According to the doctors' report, at 6:00 AM on the 28th, Gu's body temperature was 36.6 degrees, pulse 120, and respiration 40 times per minute. At 12:00 noon, the body temperature was 12.58 degrees, pulse 122, and respiration 40 times per minute. At 4:00 PM, the body temperature was 36 degrees, pulse 124, and respiration 44 times per minute. Because the fever subsided on that day, but at the same time, breathing became tight, the Western doctors used a lung protector to facilitate breathing. At this time, Gu had entered a coma, with only a trace of breath remaining. Senior party, military, and government officials all went to Gu's residence to visit. At that time, Gu was lying on the bed, only slightly opening his eyes, and was unable to speak. His family helped him out of the hall to change into his burial clothes and prepare for the funeral. Finally, at 6:05 PM, he passed away suddenly. When he was seriously ill on the 27th, Gu was still able to speak. His family knew he was in danger and inquired about his posthumous affairs. Chen Rong happened to be at Gu's residence that evening. Gu personally dictated his will, which was recorded by Chen. There were two wills, both addressed to comrades in the party and nation, discussing the future of the party and nation in general terms, and leaving family affairs to be managed by his family. After Gu's death, the Guangdong government, in order to commemorate Gu's contributions, specially issued an order yesterday, ordering all agencies inside and outside the city to lower the flag to half-mast for three days from today, and to suspend entertainment and banquets for three days to express mourning.

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Punishes Embezzlement of National Taxes Case: Hou Yiru, the county treasury tax collector, embezzled a huge sum of national taxes. A certain party member reported this to the party headquarters, which obtained the account books from the Finance Bureau and conducted a spot check. It was found that Zhou Yuntao, Tao Bohe, and other six households had embezzled over 700 yuan in silver in the eighth year of the Republic of China. The party headquarters immediately sent a letter to the county government, requesting that Hou Yiru be transferred to the judiciary for strict interrogation and to investigate the amount of embezzlement over the past decade, making it public. It is now learned that after receiving the letter, the county government summoned Zhou Yunyun and others in person by County Magistrate Pang on the afternoon of the 1st. Hou confessed that it was due to oversight. Unexpectedly, County Magistrate Pang sentenced Hou to six months in prison on the 2nd. After hearing the verdict, all sectors of society were surprised that the county government did not conduct a thorough investigation of the amount of embezzlement over the past years. It is said that the original whistleblower is now filing a complaint with the provincial government and the provincial party headquarters, requesting that the county be ordered to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Sentencing in the Embezzlement of Public Funds Case: Zhang Jingxiang, who was responsible for collecting educational funds for the County Education Bureau in Zhuangxing Town, Fengyi, was found to have been involved in many cases of misconduct. Last year, it was discovered that he had embezzled funds, such as discrepancies between the amounts on the receipts and the receipts themselves. After a confidential report, the bureau sent personnel to investigate and verified that he had embezzled over 10,000 gold. A formal accusation was filed with the County Court, and the prosecutor's office summoned him for investigation and filed a public prosecution. The court has now concluded the trial and pronounced the main text of the judgment, saying: "The defendant Zhang Jingxiang is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for the crime of continuous embezzlement of property held in the course of public duty, and is also fined five yuan. If the fine is not paid, two yuan will be deducted from the imprisonment for each day. The number of days of detention before the judgment is confirmed will be counted as two days deducting one day of imprisonment." The sentence is suspended for three years. It is said that the private prosecution portion has been mediated and settled by someone.</p>
<p>Record of the Trial of Counter-Revolutionary Criminals: The county government was ordered to organize a temporary court to try counter-revolutionary cases involving Zhang Xing and Cao Shuming. Zhang Xing's case had already been tried and sentenced in the previous hearing. Today (3rd) at noon, another hearing was held to try Cao Shuming, a communist criminal from Fengjing. Court President Shen County Magistrate Yong and judges Peng Peiyi and Li Wenwei attended the court. First, witness Fan Bingfa was summoned to testify that he personally saw Cao Shuming and Yuan Shikai (who was executed in the town) holding a meeting at Dafang Temple, declaring the overthrow of the current government and the overthrow of local tyrants and evil gentry and capitalism, and levying donations in the countryside to purchase military supplies. Then, He Jinyun was summoned to testify that Cao Shuming went to Jiang Yingquan's house to demand a donation of 500 yuan, but failed. After being introduced by someone, the plaintiff paid 200 yuan a week later. At that time, Cao was lured to He's house to eat, drink, and play cards until dawn, when he secretly called the villagers to tie up Cao and send him to the Fengjing Security Corps for legal action. Then, Cao Shuming was brought to the court for questioning. The criminal cleverly defended himself, saying that the witness's testimony was fabricated and insufficient as evidence. He had not made such statements in the High Court and requested leniency. The judge instructed to end the debate and wait for a scheduled sentencing, and then announced the adjournment of the court.</p>

However, This Time, the Preparatory Meeting Entrusted Fudan With the Responsibility for the Administrative Aspects. Because There Were Few People, Many Things, and So Little Time, It Was Impossible to Be Thorough. (3) Originally, the Student Union Invited Several Important Figures to Participate in the Guidance, But All of Them Were Unable to Attend Due to the Nation's Affairs.

<h3>Beijing-Guangdong</h3>
<p>Representatives Meeting Today</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Explain Misunderstandings</p>
<p>Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, et al. Expected to Arrive in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>Hold a Conversation First, Then Set the Sixth Meeting</p>
<p>Guangdong Representatives Spoke to Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin Released a Responsible Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Shizeng Discussed Correcting the Meeting's Name</p>
<p>Before the Beijing-Guangdong Peace Conference, Chairman Jiang's report at the National Government Memorial Week caused slight misunderstandings between the Guangdong representatives and the Nanjing side. Chairman Jiang then sent Chen Mingshu to Shanghai yesterday morning to explain, resolving the misunderstandings. Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jingjiang, Zhang Ji, and others also left Beijing last night and are expected to arrive this morning. It is heard that a conversation will be held first, and the sixth preparatory meeting may also continue at 9:00 AM today. The news obtained yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Explains Misunderstandings to Beijing Representatives</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu arrived in Shanghai at approximately 8:00 AM yesterday morning and immediately drove to visit Cai Yuanpei, Wang Jingwei, and Sun Ke, among others, speaking with each for about half an hour. After Chen left, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Wang's residence on Seymour Road. According to Wang, Chairman Jiang's intense speech during the National Government Memorial Week yesterday (the day before yesterday) caused the Beijing representatives to fear misunderstandings. Therefore, Chairman Jiang specially requested Chen to come to Shanghai first to explain to us. Chen stated that Chairman Jiang's speech was a momentary outburst and not worth dwelling on. Afterward, the representatives (referring to the Beijing representatives) advised Jiang to soften his stance, and the prospects for the peace conference should not be hindered. Zhang Ji and other representatives are scheduled to return to Shanghai tonight (last night), and the peace conference is still expected to continue. I intend to approach this matter with a calm attitude and decide to quietly await the return of the Beijing representatives to Shanghai for the meeting. Wang also stated that the previous publication of Chairman Jiang's secret telegram to Zhang, Cai, Chen, and others in Guangdong was because the Nanjing side first published the winter telegram, so the Guangdong side had no choice but to publish this telegram. According to Wang's intention, Chairman Jiang's speech the day before yesterday was triggered by the Guangdong side's publication of the telegram and was not due to any preconceived notions. Now that the Beijing representatives have advised him, all misunderstandings should be eliminated, making the conference quite optimistic.</p>
<h3>Conversation at Hu Residence Yesterday Morning, Guangdong Representatives</h3>
<p>After receiving a report from Beijing representative Chen Mingshu yesterday (the 3rd) regarding the peace negotiations in Beijing, the Guangdong representatives, wishing to exchange views with Mr. Hu Hanmin, gathered again at Hu's residence on Mayers Road for a conversation. Wang Jingwei arrived before 10:00 AM, followed by Sun Ke at approximately 10:00 AM. Soon after, Wu Chaochu, Chen Youren, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, and others also arrived one after another. The representatives reported the Beijing side's opinions conveyed by Chen Mingshu to Mr. Hu and discussed ways to promote peace. The conversation lasted approximately two hours, adjourning at 12:15 PM. It is heard that the majority opinion from the conversation was to quietly await the return of the Beijing representatives to Shanghai this morning (the 4th) to continue the meeting and then make a decision.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu's Letter to Hu Hanmin Yesterday (the 3rd),</h3>
<p>at 10:00 AM, while the conversation was being held at Hu's residence to exchange views, Chen Mingshu, who had just returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, sent someone to Hu's residence to deliver a personally written letter to Mr. Hu for further discussions. The content of the letter is unknown, but it is said to be related to promoting peace.</p>
<h3>Conversation Still to Be Held This Morning, National News Agency Reporter</h3>
<p>The reporter from the National News Agency met with Mr. Zou Lu and Mr. Sun Ke at Hu's residence yesterday and inquired about the results of Chen Mingshu's return from Beijing. According to them, Chen came to Shanghai first today to explain the slight misunderstandings caused by Chairman Jiang's speech reported today (the day of publication). Tomorrow morning (today), they will gather again at Wu's residence for a conversation, not a preparatory meeting. Therefore, all matters must await the return of the other Beijing representatives, Mr. Zhang Puquan, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, and Mr. Wu Tiecheng, before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Possibly Holding the Sixth Preparatory Meeting, Besides</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the three representatives, Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, and Wu Tiecheng, took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train from Beijing at 12:00 AM last night and are expected to arrive in Shanghai at approximately 8:00 AM this morning. If so, the sixth meeting of the Peace Preparatory Committee may continue at 9:00 AM this morning at Mr. Wu's residence on Gordon Road.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Representatives' Statement, Guangdong representatives</h3>
<p>Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Wu Chaochu, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, and Chen Youren spoke to reporters yesterday as follows: (This morning, all Western newspapers in Shanghai carried Chairman Jiang Jieshi's speech at the National Government Memorial Week in Nanjing, sharply criticizing the Guangdong representatives, with a certain news agency and an English newspaper providing detailed accounts. Although few Chinese newspapers carried the speech, the Western newspapers should not have unanimously fabricated it. If their reports are inaccurate, then the matter is irrelevant. However, if Chairman Jiang indeed made such a speech, we must respond. However, discussions should be based on concrete facts and not involve vague notions, and the attitude should be calm and not swayed by polite gestures. The main points of Chairman Jiang's speech as reported will be addressed separately below: (1) Chairman Jiang stated that the Guangdong representatives violated the Premier's teachings and lacked sincerity in cooperating with the Nanjing side. We came to Shanghai with determination to achieve peace and unity and to jointly face the national crisis. If we lacked sincerity, we would not have come to Shanghai. It took seven days after arriving in Shanghai to hold meetings with the Nanjing representatives, and the fault does not lie with us. The five meetings have been delayed over the past two days at the request of the Nanjing representatives. As for the content of the meetings, we first discussed diplomatic issues as much as possible. Regarding past policies, such as non-resistance to foreign invasion and irresponsibility for the loss of territory, we cannot express approval. However, regarding the diplomatic strategies and principles to be adopted now and in the future, we have striven for consistency, hoping that the country's territorial sovereignty and prestige will not be harmed. We have also strongly expressed our solidarity in jointly facing the national crisis after the recovery of the three northeastern provinces, not only for the benefit of individuals but also for the application of national laws and policies. After substantial resolution of diplomatic issues, we discussed the reform of the central political system. Our greatest intention is to make politics truly democratic, as the dictatorial system has been criticized by the people and is the cause of the separation between Nanjing and Guangdong. China cannot be unified without addressing this issue. Although the power to decide on these fundamental plans does not lie with the ten or so representatives from both sides, we still need to discuss them openly and seek concrete solutions to present to the central party headquarters of both sides. We believe this is the responsibility of the representatives from both sides. We have heard some people argue that such issues cannot be decided by a small number of people and that even discussion should not be allowed. This not only deprives us of our representative rights but also deprives us of our party member qualifications and the freedom of speech of citizens. This shows how deeply ingrained the poison of dictatorship is in people and how heavily public opinion has been suppressed in recent years. Looking at the above account of our travels to Shanghai and the progress of the meetings, it is clear whether we are sincere in cooperating with the Nanjing side. (2) Chairman Jiang stated that the Guangdong representatives were deliberately making things difficult for the Nanjing government, indirectly aiding Japan. We do not know what Chairman Jiang means by "making things difficult." If he is referring to diplomacy, as mentioned above, we have not only not made things difficult for the Nanjing side but have also sought diplomatic consistency and made suggestions that have been adopted and implemented by the Nanjing government. We believe we have not only helped the Nanjing government but also have nothing to be ashamed of before the people. If he is referring to domestic affairs, we have already published the concrete plan of our proposals, and the fundamental principle is to abolish dictatorship. It is unknown whether this is inconvenient for the Nanjing side, but it is not our intention to make things difficult for them. (3) Chairman Jiang stated that he had intended to resign two weeks ago but has now dismissed the idea and will not resign. The three representatives, Cai, Zhang, and Chen, sent by Chairman Jiang to Guangdong, reported to the comrades in Guangdong that Chairman Jiang had proposed three principles for the Guangdong comrades to choose from, one of which was for Chairman Jiang to step down. The Guangdong comrades adopted this principle, and regarding its implementation, they proposed that a unified conference be organized by both sides to produce a unified government. After the unified government is formed, Chairman Jiang would step down, and the Guangdong National Government would be abolished. This would avoid a transition period with no one in charge. However, fearing that this procedure would take time, they also proposed that both sides simultaneously telegraph before the unified conference is held, with Chairman Jiang stating that he could step down and the Guangdong National Government stating that it could be abolished. A draft of such a statement was telegraphed to Nanjing, and Chairman Jiang replied to the three representatives that he could agree in principle, but the wording and publication date needed to be considered. Chairman Jiang also telegraphed the three representatives on October 1st, asking them to inform the Guangdong comrades that he would welcome them to Shanghai and that this telegram would be sent in the evening. In response to Chairman Jiang's invitation, we came to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, we indeed saw the telegram drafted by Chairman Jiang stating that he could step down, and the telegram was even signed by Chairman Jiang, only awaiting our agreement to send it. At the time, we wanted to modify one word and asked for a few days' delay out of caution due to our unfamiliarity with the situation in the north. At the first meeting of the Nanjing and Guangdong representatives on October 27th, it was decided that both sides would telegraph after the meeting was concluded and a publication date was set. On October 31st, the Nanjing representatives reported at the meeting that Chairman Jiang no longer intended to send this telegram of resignation. However, when the crisis arose, the telegram was sent. In Chairman Jiang's speech yesterday, he stated that he had decided not to resign. This is the account of the issue regarding Chairman Jiang's resignation. As for Chairman Jiang's tasks after resigning, the Guangdong comrades had also discussed it and agreed that the chairman of the National Government should not bear actual political responsibility. Therefore, someone of high standing and virtue should be appointed. Chairman Jiang has always regarded himself as dedicated to the national revolution, and at this time of national crisis, he should be invited to serve as chairman of the National Defense Committee. This is the assumption of the Guangdong comrades and was originally intended to be proposed to the unified government. We happened to disclose this proposal to reporters yesterday, and it was published in the newspapers. (4) Chairman Jiang also stated that Mr. Hu Zhantang told him that Chairman Jiang should not only step down but also be exiled abroad, like Trotsky in Russia, so that he could never return to his homeland. Not only have we not heard Mr. Hu say this, but we also told Mr. Hu about the Guangdong comrades' intention to invite Chairman Jiang to serve as chairman of the National Defense Committee, and Mr. Hu expressed his approval. This shows that what Chairman Jiang heard was fabricated by someone trying to sow discord. Furthermore, Trotsky in Russia was exiled by Stalin. If Chairman Jiang is the Trotsky of China, then who is the Stalin of China? This shows that treating Chairman Jiang as Trotsky is impossible. Chairman Jiang should think carefully and find it amusing. (5) Chairman Jiang stated that the Guangdong representatives are using newspapers. We believe that newspapers should have freedom of speech within the bounds of the law, and we also believe that the progress of this peace conference should be made public. However, it cannot be said that we are using newspapers to resist the Nanjing side. There are many people who are using newspapers to confuse right and wrong and fabricate facts to obstruct the peace conference. This can be seen from the remarks of a certain member of the Central Committee of the Nanjing side and the fabrications of a certain news agency of the Nanjing side and the telegram from the Nanjing government to the representatives of the Nanjing side. The above is a brief response based on the translated main points of Chairman Jiang's speech as reported in Western newspapers. A Western newspaper reporter said that this speech was a death sentence for the peace conference, essentially causing it to break down. We deeply hope that his words are wrong, but if they unfortunately prove to be true, we are not capable enough to bear the blame.</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin's Responsible Statement, Hu Hanmin</h3>
<p>released the following responsible statement to reporters yesterday: Judging from the situation in recent days, the prospects for the peace conference still seem bleak. Yesterday, a so-called member of the Central Committee of the Beijing side again discussed the path of peace and national salvation, reiterating the previous proposal that all issues should be left to the Fourth National Congress, adding another layer of obstacles to the prospects for peace. With the country in such a state, all those who bear responsibility must deeply repent. In this peace conference, which is awaited by the entire country, we should openly meet and seek fundamental reforms in politics, party affairs, and military affairs, and quickly determine a way to resist Japan in order to preserve a glimmer of hope for the country. Instead, various parties are opening up alternative paths and clinging to the struggle for personal power and position, which I find deeply saddening. I will address the remarks of this member of the Central Committee, whose identity I still do not know. The title "member of the Central Committee" seems to imply a responsible person, but such remarks, dealing with matters of great importance to the party and the country, yet prefaced with the word "certain," seem to indicate a lack of responsibility. In that case, how is this kind of remark different from an anonymous denunciation? I previously believed that the remarks of this certain member of the Central Committee would have a negative impact on the peace conference itself, and the central news agency of the Beijing side, citing the principle of freedom of speech, published them, which is truly alarming. Therefore, I did not despise it as an anonymous denunciation. Instead, based on my original intention of mediating peace to seek sincere unity, I slightly corrected it in my statement on the 30th. Today, one of the important points relied upon by this anonymous member of the Central Committee is that all issues should be resolved by the Fourth National Congress. If that is the case, then the peace and unity conference that Chairman Jiang hoped the Guangdong representatives would come north to convene is completely meaningless. I wonder what the people of the country will think of such fickle members of the Central Committee. Today, there is another thing that shocks me, namely the speech of Chairman Jiang Jieshi at the Premier's Memorial Week, as reported by various Western newspapers in Shanghai. The content of the speech, in addition to various criticisms of the Guangdong representatives, also contains many slanders against me, roughly saying that I once told the Guangdong representatives that today's Jiang Jieshi should not only be made to step down but also be exiled abroad, like Trotsky in Soviet Russia, so that he could never return to his homeland. I do not know whether Chairman Jiang made this statement, and I do not know whether Chairman Jiang will deny it afterward. However, since the Western newspapers reported it so clearly, it should not be a fabrication. What I do not understand is that China does not have a Red Army, and Chairman Jiang is not comparable to Trotsky, and I am not Stalin. I have never had a single soldier or weapon, so I do not know how I would exile him abroad. I have said many times that I have no personal issues with anyone, but I will not blindly agree on matters. Chairman Jiang's paranoia has reached this point, which is very unnecessary. In short, with the national crisis at hand, in addition to exhausting my wisdom and strength to make a final effort, I hope that all comrades can thoroughly realize that if we increase the division within the party due to personal opinions, leading to the country's destruction, we will have no face to meet the people, and we will have no face to meet the late Premier in the afterlife.</p>
<h3>Li Shizeng's Statement, Opinions of Member of the Central Committee, Li Shizeng</h3>
<p>has recently been recuperating in the hospital due to illness, and there have been reports that Li will go to France. Therefore, there has been much speculation outside. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, in order to inquire about Li's true attitude, specially obtained Li's permission and visited Li's current residence in a certain hospital yesterday morning to inquire about various questions. Li gave the following statement: I have always had a throat ailment that recurs from time to time. This time, after coming to Shanghai from Beijing, I caught a slight cold, which triggered it again. A few days ago, Vice Commander Zhang arrived in Beijing to discuss diplomatic issues and strongly urged me to go. The car was ready, but the doctor strongly advised against it, saying that if I risked going, the sore throat could turn into diphtheria and pneumonia. Therefore, I had to temporarily entrust Mr. Wu Tiecheng to convey my intentions. As for going to France, I have always been dedicated to Sino-French cultural and educational undertakings and have gone to France once every three to five years. Since returning to China in 1928, it has been several years. Last month, Mr. Laleur, the secretary-general of the French National Theatre, came to China. Because he is extremely fond of culture, I casually said that since he likes to study Eastern culture and has come to China, he might as well stay for a few more months. In the future, if there is an opportunity, I could accompany him to France. Mr. Cheng Yanqiu also intended to go to France with Mr. Laleur, so I introduced them. The outside world misunderstood, perhaps from this. I have absolutely no intention of going abroad at present. As for the so-called peace conference, when Mr. Wang, Mr. Sun, and others first arrived in Shanghai, I offered my opinion, saying that the national cooperation to face foreign aggression is certainly very gratifying, but the name of the conference should not use the words "peace" or "unity" because using such words easily causes misunderstandings. From the perspective of facing foreign aggression, it is tantamount to announcing to the world that we have a civil war and are not unified. In my opinion, with the national crisis at hand, it is best to gather all sectors of the country to hold a national crisis conference. In this conference, we can divide into several small groups, and party affairs and politics can also be divided into small groups. The reform of party affairs and politics is naturally related to relieving the national crisis. There are many precedents for such national crisis conferences in Europe. When a country encounters an emergency crisis, it gathers various parties, even those who are enemies of the government, and they can abandon their prejudices and cooperate. France during the European War is one example. At that time, the labor associations that opposed the government also joined in cooperation. More recently, the United Kingdom, due to the economic panic, has formed a national cabinet with cooperation from all parties, which is similar to this. In any case, if it is done in the name of a national crisis conference, the impressions of China and foreign countries will definitely be very different from those who say that it is for peace and unity. Because of my illness, I cannot serve as a representative of the so-called peace conference, but my true wish is still that the nature of the conference is like a national crisis conference in countries when there are urgent opportunities.</p>
<h3>Letters from Party Members to Wang Jingwei and Cai Yuanpei Regarding the Shanghai Peace and Unification Conference</h3>
<p>Respectfully, to Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, and all representatives of the Shanghai Peace and Unification Conference:</p>
<p>Our party has unfortunately been plagued by conflicts over political views and continuous warfare in recent years, leading to increasing hardships for the people. This has resulted in unprecedented foreign aggression and internal strife, compounded by natural disasters and man-made calamities. The people are in dire straits, and the nation is on the verge of collapse. At this critical moment, it is hoped that the leaders can repent of their past mistakes and strive for unity to save the party and the nation from peril. Therefore, we have jointly recommended you, gentlemen, to convene a conference in Shanghai to discuss strategies for internal stability and external resistance, as well as reforms of party and government affairs. The outcome of your conference is of utmost importance. However, for the past ten days, no firm decisions have been made, and divisions have been apparent from time to time. This has caused anxiety and despair among the people who look to you for guidance, as if a great calamity is imminent. How can you, gentlemen, face this situation?</p>
<p>We party members have observed that the disputes between the two sides are far from the original intention of abandoning prejudices and uniting sincerely. We cannot help but suspect that the attitude towards Mr. Hu Hanmin is the reason for this situation. You, gentlemen, were chosen by both sides to resolve the major issues of the party and the nation and should not be subject to external constraints. Mr. Hu is not a representative and should abide by your decisions. However, he is directly interfering in everything and making irresponsible attacks, subtly manipulating the Guangdong representatives and causing adverse effects on the conference. This is one point.</p>
<p>Before May of this year, Mr. Hu was directly responsible for the Nanjing government. Many of the party's policies and measures were based on his proposals. However, he is now taking advantage of his position to attack the party's system and political structure of the Nanjing government without any reflection. This is another point.</p>
<p>The reform of the party, government, and military systems must align with the demands of the people and the current needs of the nation, both in terms of law and reality. It should not cater to the political desires of any particular faction. This is a third point.</p>
<p>We party members are deeply saddened by the past disintegration and internal strife. At this critical juncture, we must speak out. We hope that Mr. Hu will prioritize national affairs, learn from his past mistakes, restrain himself, and not obstruct peace and unification. We hope that both sides can uphold the spirit of sincere unity, that the representatives are not influenced by external factors, and that the conference achieves positive results. From now on, revolutionary members should unite and work together to resist foreign aggression, and Mr. Wang's democratic ideals can be realized. The future of the party and the nation will depend on this. We offer our sincere advice and respectfully request your consideration.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Held a Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Fifteenth Meeting</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this city held its fifteenth standing committee meeting yesterday. Lu Jingshi chaired the meeting, and Zhao Shutong and Yi Kang took minutes. The following items were discussed:</p>
<p>(1) The Volunteer Army Committee submitted a report on the establishment of a Volunteer Army organization and a primary officer training school, along with the resumes of the officers, requesting filing for record and transmission to party, government, and military agencies. It was resolved to approve the transmission.</p>
<p>(2) The Jiujiang Anti-Japanese Promotion Society sent a letter stating that the goods of the Lun Chang Company were difficult to distinguish and requested a thorough and strict inspection. It was resolved to examine the case together with other related cases.</p>
<p>(3) The Silk Factory Association sent a letter stating that Chinese intermediaries were involved in Anglo-Japanese trade and asked whether this should be stopped, requesting a clear indication for public decision. It was resolved that it should be stopped.</p>
<p>(4) The Towel Merchants Association sent a letter stating that the Committee for Research on Resisting Japanese Goods and the Committee for Inspecting Japanese Goods had merged into the Committee for Economic Severance with Japan, which was officially established on the 19th of this month. The resolutions of that meeting were sent for adoption and discussion. It was resolved to approve the case after investigation.</p>
<p>(5) The Paper Industry Association sent a letter requesting consideration of the difficulties faced by merchants and proposing that old stock of Japanese goods be centrally sealed and sold publicly on a fixed date. It was resolved to refer the method of handling sealed Japanese goods to the Design Committee for formulation before further discussion.</p>
<p>(6) The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter stating that the Coal Industry Association had requested a plea to exempt registered Japanese coal from sealing to alleviate the urgent need. It was resolved that specific measures had been referred to the Design Committee for formulation and that the association would pay special attention to the coal shortage problem.</p>
<p>(7) The eleventh executive committee meeting resolved to task the association with formulating an economic plan for discussion at the next meeting, requesting the appointment of personnel to formulate the plan. It was resolved to refer the plan to the secretariat for formulation and discussion at the next standing committee meeting.</p>
<p>(8) The Underwear Company replied to a previous resolution to reduce the donation of 5,000 sets of military uniforms with a deadline of one month, stating that it was difficult due to economic hardship and requesting an extension to three months. It was resolved to extend the deadline to the end of the lunar year.</p>
<p>(9) The Korean Chamber of Commerce requested exemption from the boycott of Korean products such as Korean ginseng and toad venom. This was previously rejected at the last meeting and was now resubmitted for review. It was resolved to approve the method to be formulated by the secretariat.</p>
<p>(10) The Hangzhou Anti-Japanese Association inquired about the methods for sealing Japanese goods and requested instructions. It was resolved to refer the formulation of methods to the Design Committee for reply by letter.</p>
<p>(11) Committee Member Liu Shimu stated that the manager of the Shanghai Nanqiao Company claimed that the "Wheel" and "Rose" brand matches manufactured by the Ruizhong Foreign Firm and the soybeans transported to Southeast Asia were definitely not Japanese goods and requested certification. It was resolved to refer the matter to the Investigation Department for verification.</p>
<p>(12) The Ruizhong Foreign Firm sent a letter stating that the factory's capital was entirely from Swiss merchants and had nothing to do with the Japanese, requesting the dispatch of personnel to investigate and clarify the truth. However, according to confidential reports, these matches were indeed manufactured by the Japanese. The association had already informed the Cigarette and Match Industry Association to notify its members not to sell them on commission. The firm then sent various supporting documents to the association for review. Given the previous circumstances, how should this be handled? It was resolved to examine the case together with other related cases for further review.</p>
<p>(13) The Jiangsu Saltpeter General Bureau sent a letter stating that the detained Japanese saltpeter was ordered before the Northeast Incident. Since the incident, they had unanimously refused to use Japanese goods. They sent a delivery note and five passports together for verification and requested the Anti-Japanese Association of Wuxi to release the goods. It was resolved to reply by letter requesting a direct appeal to that association.</p>
<p>In total, there were more than forty cases.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Japanese Association Forbids Intermediary Shops From Employing Servants for Japanese People; Yesterday's Notice to Intermediary Shops:</h3>
<p>Notice concerning the case:</p>
<p>Investigation reveals that many intermediary shops set up by Chinese people in the Hongkou area of this city display Japanese signs and specialize in introducing various types of servants to Japanese people. In the current anti-Japanese climate, a small number of compatriots, driven by the need for livelihood, are again serving the enemy. This not only goes against the principle of non-cooperation but also undermines the dignity of our nation.</p>
<p>Therefore, all intermediary shops are hereby notified that they must not employ servants for Japanese people in the future and must remove Japanese signs and advertisements to show solidarity against the enemy. Please comply with this notice.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Japanese Association Notifies All Sectors to Refuse to Sell Japanese Saltpeter and Sulfur; Yesterday's Notice:</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>It has been reported that the government-supervised and merchant-operated saltpeter and sulfur business in our country imports a huge amount of saltpeter from Japan every year, reaching tens of millions of dollars. Taking Jiangxi Province as an example, the annual sales amount to about one million dollars, and the tax revenue can reach 150,000 dollars, which shows the large sales volume.</p>
<p>Although this matter is a government-supervised and merchant-operated monopoly, resisting Japan and saving the country is the duty of every citizen, and strictly prohibiting Japanese goods is the public intention of the people. It should be universally prohibited without discrimination.</p>
<p>Therefore, please inform the local anti-Japanese associations to strictly prevent the transportation and sale of Japanese saltpeter and sulfur.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Japanese Association Sends a Letter to the Rice Industry Association; No Rice or Grain May Be Used to Supply Japanese People</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>According to the report from our association's investigation department, the department has repeatedly received confidential reports that rice merchants in this city often supply Japanese people with large quantities of rice. Although personnel have been dispatched to investigate, they have been unable to conduct inspections due to the location within the concession or due to time constraints, resulting in no seizures. This is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>At a time when Japanese pirates are rampant and invading our eastern provinces, all citizens should embrace the principle of non-cooperation and refrain from buying and selling with the Japanese in order to achieve economic severance through passive methods. However, some unscrupulous merchants are ignorant of reason and blinded by profit, and they sell large quantities of rice to the Japanese to feed the enemy. This is extremely inappropriate, especially considering our unprecedented floods, with widespread suffering and a shortage of food. We are hardly able to take care of ourselves and have no surplus to supply the Japanese.</p>
<p>Therefore, this document is submitted to your esteemed association for review. We request that you inform the Rice Industry Association to notify rice merchants that they must not supply rice and other grains to Japanese people on a large scale, except for the supply of rations, in order to show determination and maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<p>If anyone is found to be acting contrary to this order, they will be severely punished after investigation. Please comply and inform us of your action.</p>
<p>Respectfully, to the Rice Industry Association</p>
<h3>No New Japanese Goods Found in Sanlin Town; The Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee</h3>
<p>After being refused inspection by three treacherous merchants in Minhang, the committee deeply believes that merchants are still difficult to awaken and that strict supervision is needed to implement economic severance. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, all members of the standing committee, along with the committee's staff, went to Sanlin Town in Pudong to inspect Japanese goods in various shops.</p>
<p>The merchants in the town showed great enthusiasm for national salvation. Stores such as Tao Yongxing, Gong Shunxiang, Yu Yuyi, Yu Yuxin, Qian Taihe, Dong Mao, Yida, Xinchang, Tong Xinxiang, Heng Shengxiang, and others had no new Japanese goods, and the Japanese goods they had registered had been automatically sealed and were not for sale. The Anti-Japanese Association sealed them one by one. In addition, stores such as Tao Yifeng, Dachengchang, Yu Laicheng, Bo Jiding, and Yiyu Tai had no Japanese goods at all. This shows that the people in the town are enthusiastic patriots, worthy of being the champion of merchants. The County Anti-Japanese Association was deeply satisfied with this phenomenon and immediately sought ways to reward them.</p>
<h3>Please Universally Advise Overseas Compatriots to Work Hard to Resist Japan; The City Chamber of Commerce Replied to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Batavia Yesterday:</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>We have received your esteemed letter and learned that the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Support Association has been established, which is extremely admirable. The key to restricting Japan lies in economic severance. Preparations are underway in China, and the results seem to be more advanced than in previous years. Large-scale joint organizations also exist in places such as Vietnam and southern Vietnam.</p>
<p>Japanese goods sold in the Dutch East Indies are also considerable, and the daily necessities of scholars and others rely on Chinese merchants as intermediaries. Small-scale shops are all over the place. If Chinese merchants do not act as intermediaries, it will be enough to bring Japanese goods to an end. We hope that your association will work hard to conduct economic severance against Japan with peaceful and patient means. Overseas compatriots are well-known for their righteousness, and if they can act on their own everywhere without any compulsion, the government of the place of residence will not be able to interfere.</p>
<p>This is the only way to alleviate the national crisis and deter the enemy's courage at present. We hope you will make every effort to do it.</p>
<h3>The Automobile Industry Will Not Transport Goods for the Japanese; The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Sent Separate Letters to the Freight Automobile Industry and the Rental Automobile Industry Associations in This City:</h3>
<p>Since the economic severance against Japan, all sectors in this city have clearly understood the meaning of righteousness and have mostly broken away from all dealings with the Japanese. However, the loading of goods is often overlooked because it is a minor matter, which is not thorough enough in the spirit of non-cooperation.</p>
<p>The second standing committee meeting decided to send separate letters to the freight and rental automobile industries, informing their counterparts that they must not transport goods for the Japanese in the future to show their shared hatred for the enemy. In addition to sending separate letters, we are sending a letter to request your compliance and reply.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Cloth Industry Workers in This City</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, more than one hundred representatives of the industry in the city automatically gathered at the association's meeting place in Shunzhen Lane, North Zhejiang Road, to discuss. The atmosphere was extremely tense.</p>
<p>The following resolutions were immediately passed: (1) To organize an anti-Japanese national salvation association; (2) To name it the Shanghai Cloth Industry Workers Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association; (3) To elect Gong Hongwen, Xie Lizhong, Chen Yongliang, Wang Xinyi, Hu Huahang, Zhou Yuwen, Xu Zhengfu, Yuan Zhaoxin, Tang Fusheng, Xu Jianglou, Lu Yizhi, Wu Jianqing, He Chechang, Shen Fei, Zhang Yuyan, Gao Yongxing, Jiang Zhiping, Gao Yunlü, Zheng Guangying, and Shi Juchu, twenty-one people in total, to be responsible for preparations; (4) To appoint Hu Huahang, Yuan Zhaoxin, Xie Lizhong, and He Chechang to draft the rules; (5) The preparatory office will be located at the association's location. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Investigation by the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Zheng Zenan's Bribery Case for Releasing Goods</p>
<p>Notice to All Industries Not to Handle Japanese Goods Privately</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Association and Zheng Zenan Both Made Statements</p>
<p>Regarding the Anti-Japanese Association's accusation of Zheng Zenan's bribery for releasing goods, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce held yesterday that because Zheng is the chairman of the Sugar Industry Association, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate this matter. It sent separate letters to the Sugar Industry Association and the Committee for Implementing Economic Severance Against Japan, which is organized by the association, to convene a meeting to discuss the measures and send personnel to investigate the facts. At the same time, it issued a notice to all industries that they must not handle Japanese goods privately after inspection.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Association and Zheng Zenan both sent letters to the Anti-Japanese Association making statements. The letters are recorded below:</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Side (1) Letter to the Sugar Industry Association and the Committee for Implementing Economic Severance Against Japan:</h3>
<p>On the third of this month, newspapers reported that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association accused Deng Zenan, chairman of the Sugar Industry Association, of accepting bribes of 1,500 yuan each from the Yuan Yu and Mao He sugar firms to privately release Japanese sugar. This concerns the reputation of the association and the discipline of economic severance against Japan. We should not ignore the issue of reputation and credibility. Please convene a temporary meeting of members to discuss the measures within three days of receiving this letter.</p>
<p>(2) Notice to All Industries:</p>
<p>Newspapers reported that the Anti-Japanese Association accused Zheng Zenan, chairman of the Sugar Industry Association, of privately releasing Japanese sugar after accepting bribes of 1,500 yuan each from the Yuan Yu and Mao He sugar firms. We are deeply saddened to hear this.</p>
<p>It has always been the case that if an industry association punishes a member for violating industry rules, it must be discussed at a public meeting. There is no reason for one person to accept and give privately. In addition, for this economic severance against Japan, the industries' inspection of Japanese goods is limited to reporting the violations. As for the disposal method, it should be reported to our association or directly to the Anti-Japanese Association for handling. The association had already decided and announced this to the public.</p>
<p>If all industries dispose of the goods arbitrarily, not only will the different opinions and methods disrupt the steps against Japan, but there may even be cases of privately releasing the goods out of consideration for personal relationships. The drawbacks are great, and the mistakes of the past should not be repeated.</p>
<p>Therefore, we clarify the powers and issue a universal notice. Please pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Sugar Industry Association Side (1) Letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association:</h3>
<p>On the third of this month, we were shocked to read the report in various newspapers that the Anti-Japanese Association accused Zheng Zenan of bribery for releasing goods.</p>
<p>On October 3, our association received an anonymous letter reporting that Yuan Yu and Mao He were privately operating Japanese sugar. Chairman and committee member Zheng Zenan convened an executive committee meeting on the 4th to discuss and resolve that all attending committee members would go to the two firms for investigation (minutes attached).</p>
<p>It was found that Yuan Yu's accounts had recorded two sales of Japanese sugar, so a record was added to the book. Then, Mao He was checked, and the company's accounts showed that hundreds of packages of 325 sugar were sold on September 19 and 24. Because the price of the sale was different from the price of Taigu sugar, they were questioned. They claimed that it was not Japanese sugar. There was no other conclusive evidence, so they signed the book and returned. This was the investigation of the truth of the Japanese sugar of the two firms on October 4.</p>
<p>The next day, Chairman Zheng returned to his hometown due to business and sent a letter to the association asking for leave (original letter attached). On the 8th, when he returned to Shanghai and asked about the case, it had not yet been resolved. On the 9th, he convened an executive committee meeting again to discuss. It was agreed that the Yuan Yu case occurred before the establishment of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and was a thing of the past, and that Mao He only had suspicions and no conclusive evidence. They should be treated leniently. The meeting decided to waive the discussion (minutes attached).</p>
<p>On October 11, committee members Lang and Yang sent the case to Jiang Yachen, the financial trustee of the sugar industry elementary school. Yuan Yu and Mao He each donated 1,500 yuan of expenses to the school. Jiang deposited the money into the school's public funds account and issued a receipt. This is the true account of Yuan Yu and Mao He's voluntary donations to school expenses.</p>
<p>The claims in the newspapers that goods were released and bribes were given are all untrue. We hereby state the facts and hope you will investigate.</p>
<p>(2) Attached: Minutes of the 31st Executive Committee Meeting on October 4, Regarding the anonymous letter reporting that Yuan Yu and Mao He were privately operating Japanese sugar, it was resolved that all attending committee members would unanimously go to the two firms to thoroughly investigate and then re-examine.</p>
<p>(3) Chairman Zheng's Letter of Leave on October 5</p>
<p>I, Zenan, have important matters to attend to in my hometown and will be on leave for five days from today. During this period, regarding the association's affairs and the enforcement of yesterday's resolutions, please be responsible for implementing them to avoid delays.</p>
<p>(4) Minutes of the 32nd Executive Committee Meeting on October 9:</p>
<p>Reconsidering the investigation of Yuan Yu and Mao He's private operation of Japanese sugar, it was resolved that the case had been investigated by all the attending executive committee members on the 4th. Although Yuan Yu's accounts recorded two sales of Japanese sugar, the matter was in the past. Mao He's accounts were slightly suspicious. It was decided to forgo discussion.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zenan's Side (1) Letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association:</h3>
<p>I was extremely shocked to read the report in the newspapers on the 3rd of this month that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association accused me of bribery for releasing goods.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Association has reported to your esteemed association the circumstances surrounding the donation of 1,500 yuan each from Yuan Yu and Mao He to the sugar industry elementary school's expenses. On the 28th of last month, I heard that Zhu Anqing had falsely accused the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, claiming that Yuan Yu had given me 1,500 yuan for national salvation. Because it concerned my reputation, I entrusted lawyer Zhang Zhengxue to send a letter to Yuan Yu on the following day. Yuan Yu replied to lawyer Zhang on the 1st of this month, stating that there was no such thing (original letter attached). This makes it clear that Yuan Yu did not give me 1,500 yuan for national salvation. As for the claim that I entrusted Zhu Anfu to bribe your association with 1,000 yuan, it is even more bizarre. Although Zhu Anfu and I are in the same industry, we rarely interact, and I have not asked him to do this. Zhu has sent a letter stating that there is absolutely no such thing (original letter attached) for the sake of preserving his reputation. This is even more clear that I did not entrust Zhu to handle the matter.</p>
<p>It is evident that Zhu Anqing fabricated facts to alarm the public. His intention is nothing more than to frame me, which has already violated criminal law. In order to clarify the truth and protect my reputation, I request that your association detain him and I will file a separate lawsuit. I request that you investigate this case quickly to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>(2) Copy of Yuan Yu's Reply to Lawyer Zhang:</p>
<p>I have received your letter and read everything. The party concerned, Zheng Zenan, claims that our firm has reported money for Anti-Japanese National Salvation. I am very surprised to read this. I believe it is a baseless rumor. I have specially sent a letter to your lawyer to ask you to consult your party concerned. Please give me a reply.</p>
<p>(3) Copy of Zhu Anfu's Letter:</p>
<p>The report in the news column of this city's newspaper that the Anti-Japanese Association accused Zheng Zenan of bribery for releasing goods includes the claim that you, Ji Qiu, reported twice that Chairman Zheng was eager to settle the matter and was willing to pay 1,000 yuan as the price to ensure that the investigation would not be taken too seriously and to protect the reputation of both parties. It is also claimed that I was entrusted by Mr. Zheng to handle the matter. After investigating, I have never been entrusted by you to handle any matters. I have absolutely not accepted any commissions from you. The above-mentioned content is untrue and is obviously for other purposes. I am afraid that if you read it, it will cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I have specifically sent a letter to state that I am preserving my personality.</p>

<h3>Housheng Yarn Factory Renamed Shenxin No. 6 Factory</h3>
<p>The Plan After Housheng's Sale is Exhausted</p>
<p>Spinning 32-Count Standard Yarn</p>
<p>Increasing the Strength to Resist Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>Accommodating Workers Leaving Tongxing</p>
<p>The Housheng Ziji Textile Company on Yangshupu Road in this city was established in May of the seventh year of the Republic of China and has been in operation for more than ten years. It has a total of 50,700 yarn spindles, 10,000 thread spindles, and 920 looms, employing 4,315 male and female workers. After being shut down on December 10th of last year, it has not resumed production. The factory's shareholders, Yuan Runsheng and Xue Shirun, have no intention of operating it and have given all the workers severance pay to terminate the employment relationship. They sold the entire factory to Rong Zongjing, general manager of Shenxin Textile Company, for 3.4 million taels. The handover was completed on the 20th of last month. Rong will rename it Shenxin Textile Factory No. 6 and appoint Rong Esheng as the general manager, Li Dixian as the deputy manager, Zeng Xiangxi as the chief engineer, and Zheng Guodong, Zeng Shize, He Da, and Fu Hansheng as the yarn department engineers, and Hui Zhidou as the cloth factory department engineer. It is currently reorganizing internally and will start work soon. It plans to spin cotton yarn with a medium count of 32, in order to increase its strength against resistance amidst this anti-Japanese voice.</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing has a total of nine weaving factories, which can be described as the king of the textile industry. The situation of each factory is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(In Shanghai) Factory No. 1: 46,000 yarn spindles, 1,150 looms; Factory No. 2: 41,000 yarn spindles, 2,900 thread spindles; Factory No. 5: 45,388 yarn spindles, 11,040 thread spindles; Factory No. 7: 53,844 yarn spindles, 8,400 thread spindles, 447 looms; Factory No. 8: 40,000 yarn spindles; Factory No. 9: 69,000 yarn spindles, 882 thread spindles, 1,000 looms; (In Wuxi) Factory No. 3: 58,000 yarn spindles, 850 looms; (In Hankou) Factory No. 4: 30,000 yarn spindles, 410 looms.</p>
<p>The second factory of the Japanese-owned Tongxing Textile Co., Ltd. on Yangshupu Road employs 2,128 Chinese workers. All the Chinese workers were outraged by the violence used by Japan to forcefully occupy our territory and massacre our soldiers and civilians, and by the dispatch of fleets to China to demonstrate their power. A few days ago, in order to resist Japan and save the country, they automatically resigned en masse and requested party and government agencies to provide relief. After Rong Zongjing, general manager of Shenxin Textile Co., purchased the Housheng Ziji Yarn Factory and renamed it Shenxin Textile Factory No. 6, he reorganized the internal affairs and began recruiting new workers. The workers who resigned from Tongxing requested resettlement. Yesterday, the municipal government sent Gu Bingyuan, a member of the Social Affairs Bureau, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent Zhang Ziyu, and the city's labor industry sent Lu Jingshi to persuade Rong Zongjing to stop recruiting new workers and accommodate all the workers who resigned from Tongxing. As a result, Rong said that the workers resigned for the purpose of resisting Japan and saving the country and were commendable. He immediately agreed to stop recruiting new workers and completely accommodate the workers, and agreed to pay the workers' wages from the following Monday (the 9th) if the factory had not yet been reorganized and could not start work.</p>
<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>Japanese Secretly Chartering Chinese Vessels; Revealing that Japan Occupied the Northeast</p>
<p>After Japan occupied Northeast China and cut off the Beining Railway, the transport of miscellaneous grains and other items from the eastern provinces was taken over by the South Manchuria Railway. The goods shipped from Dalian were more than usual. However, Japanese ships coming to various ports in our country were not allowed to unload, so the Japanese changed their strategy and used traitors to charter Chinese ships to load goods in Dalian for the Japanese to develop transportation. A large number of Japanese marine products were disguised as non-Japanese goods and transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>A treacherous merchant in Shanghai chartered two huge vessels to Dalian. On the surface, they were chartered by Chinese merchants, but in reality, they were transporting goods for the Japanese. The treacherous merchant received a huge amount of movement fees and is still transporting goods. The domestic routes are turning due to the lack of ships.</p>
<h3>Large Number of British Ships Going to Yingkou, Occupied by Violent Japan</h3>
<p>After commercial transportation suffered significant obstructions, an agreement was recently reached with the Japanese to load goods for export as usual. However, winter is approaching, and the port will soon be closed. A large quantity of goods are currently stockpiled in the port, awaiting shipment to Shantou, Xiamen, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other ports. Recently, the Yingkou Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to Shanghai requesting one hundred ships to load the accumulated goods for transport before the port closes. Chinese merchant ships dare not go. British merchant ships have dispatched a large number of vessels. Shipping fees have risen by 20% above the original price.</p>
<h3>Shallow Waters of the Upper Yangtze Cause Price Increases</h3>
<p>The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has recently receded sharply. Larger ships can no longer navigate. The Shanghai branches of Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants, and Sanpei Steam Navigation have met and decided to increase shallow-water fees for the upper Yangtze River from this month onwards. The prices for routes from Hankou to Yichang and Shashi, as well as to Changsha in Hunan, will increase uniformly by 50% of the original price. The new shipping rates for goods from Shanghai to Shashi, Yichang, and Hunan have already been notified to all clients.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Floods Shanghai Since Arrival</h3>
<p>Japanese cloth can no longer be sold. The demand for American cotton by Japanese spinning mills has also decreased. As a result, a large quantity of machine-picked cotton is being temporarily stored. Recently, at a certain wharf in Puliu, Pudong, large shipments of American cotton have been arriving daily, totaling around 100,000 bales. All four warehouses are almost full. Several tens of thousands more bales are expected to arrive this week.</p>

<h3>Winter Relief is Imminent</h3>
<p>Appeal for Donations from the Water Disaster Relief Association of Shanghai. The Shanghai Urgent Relief Association for Water Disasters in Various Provinces issued an appeal for winter relief donations yesterday, stating: “For three years, floods have ravaged the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, causing the Yellow River to breach its banks, resulting in an unprecedented catastrophe. Countless people have died, and homes have been turned into ruins. We, the undersigned, despite our limited resources, have established this association to appeal for help in order to provide relief. However, due to the vast extent of the disaster area and the large number of victims, the funds raised, although reaching two million, can only benefit a small fraction of those affected. Now that winter has arrived, and hunger and cold are exacerbating the suffering, alas, these 70 million disaster victims will inevitably die if not saved, and will die even if aid is delayed. According to investigation reports from relief workers in various provinces and the appeals from local officials and civilians, the situation is both clear and profound. We are restless and anxious, unable to find a solution. Therefore, we have jointly decided to continue organizing winter relief to save these 70 million disaster victims who are on the verge of death. As the ancients said, the hungry are easily fed, and the thirsty are easily quenched. For the disaster victims, who are now facing the final days of their lives, even a bowl of rice gruel or a piece of ragged clothing, which we consider worthless, is like a miraculous elixir that can bring them back to life. Therefore, we urgently appeal to all benevolent individuals to generously donate. Every penny and every grain of rice is a contribution to humanity and a strategy to save the nation. Saving these survivors of the disaster is equivalent to preserving our nation's existence and saving the Republic of China from its impending doom. We cannot help but implore on behalf of the disaster victims.”</p>
<p>Major donations received are as follows: (1) Mr. Wang Yiting of Liu Jianji Real Estate donated 5,000 yuan to aid relief and another 2,000 sets of cotton clothes, and 5,500 yuan for expenses. (2) Mr. Zhang Xiaolin and Mr. Du Yuesheng raised 100,000 yuan donated by Mr. Han Yun'gen from military demobilization funds, which were sold by the Chinese Stock Exchange, yielding 52,600 yuan. (3) Mr. Terkildsen donated 1,000 yuan. (4) The China Racing Club donated 200,000 yuan from the Charity Champagne Fund. (5) Mr. Jiang Yiping sent 4,000 yuan raised, and Mr. Jiang Zicheng donated 1,000 pieces of cotton clothing.</p>
<h3>Residents of Gaoyou Should Not Be Repatriated: Appeal to Shenbao to Forward to All Newspapers</h3>
<p>The National Government Relief Committee for Water Disasters, the Shanghai Urgent Relief Association for Water Disasters in Various Provinces, and the Jiangsu Water Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram stating: "Today, the Shenbao newspaper reported local news that the Disaster Relief Office has decided not to accept any more disaster victims, and that the 6,000-plus disaster victims currently in Shanghai, mostly from Gaoyou, Xinghua, and Shaobo in northern Jiangsu, should be repatriated as soon as possible, with repatriation to be completed by the end of this month." Based on the letters received from disaster victim representatives such as Mr. Zhang Lingbo from our county, describing their plight, we were shocked to learn that more than two months after the Gaoyou breach, the breach has not been repaired, the embankment has not been rebuilt, the farmland is still submerged in water, and homes cannot be rebuilt. Countless disaster victims are waiting to die in various rural areas. Although the government and charitable relief efforts have been established, they have mostly fallen short of expectations. Only two or three out of ten have received relief, while those who have not received relief have no means of livelihood and are starving to death. It seems that Gaoyou accounts for the majority of the 6,000 people in Shanghai. While it may seem like a large number in Shanghai, it is a small number in Gaoyou. These thousands of people came to Shanghai to escape death and seek life. If they are repatriated, they will have no means of survival. With no home or food, it would be akin to driving them into ditches and abandoning them to their deaths. We believe that this is not something that the esteemed members of your association would want to do. As winter approaches, hunger and cold are even more pressing. We earnestly request that you stop the repatriation immediately, continue to accept the victims, and also allocate a large amount of relief funds and supplies to be quickly distributed by the Gaoyou Relief Association and relief workers stationed in Gaoyou, so that each moment earlier can save a life. Preventing one repatriation in Shanghai can also save a life. We pray that you will consider this matter carefully and act accordingly. We are waiting anxiously for your reply." Sincerely, Wang Hongzao, Chairman of the Shanghai Gaoyou Fellow-Provincials Association, and Committee Members.</p>
<h3>Ginling Girls' College Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The flood victims coming to Shanghai are numerous and need assistance. Ginling Girls’ College held a meeting on its anniversary and decided to donate collectively, raising 300 yuan and 349 sets of lined and unlined cotton clothing and trousers, as well as 20 pairs of socks. Yesterday, Ms. Bian Zhaosun, a student representative from the college, personally delivered the donations to the China Benevolent Orphanage Association for distribution. The students of the college are truly admirable for their dedication to charitable work.</p>
<h3>Report on the Disaster Situation in Gaochun County: Inspector Pang's Report</h3>
<p>Report on the Disaster Situation in Gaochun County: (Excerpt) "On the 21st, Inspector Ji inspected the fourth district of flooded areas near Shijiusuo Lake. The disaster situation there was severe. After crossing the lake, he passed through the disaster area in the northern part of Gaochun County. He saw that all the houses were submerged in water, with only one or two protruding above the surface. However, all the brick walls had collapsed. Most of the disaster victims were living on wooden platforms built on tree branches, without food for the day, crying out for help, making for a most pitiable sight. This summer, there was incessant rain for over a month, and the rivers and lakes swelled rapidly. The floodwaters rose to a depth of two or three zhang. The wind and waves were fierce, sweeping away people and livestock, and countless houses were submerged, similar to the most severely affected areas in northern Jiangsu. What is even more tragic is that while the waters in the most severely affected areas of northern Jiangsu are flowing eastward and gradually receding, the waters in Gaochun are blocked by the eastern dam, relying solely on the Jinzhu Pass of Taiping for discharge into the river. The river water is large and the resistance is strong. Therefore, even as winter approaches, the water level has only receded by three or four chi, and the area remains a vast expanse of water. Since the construction of the eastern dam in Gaochun County during the Ming Dynasty, it has borne the brunt of flooding for the three Wu regions for over 500 years. However, it has never been as severe as this year. This year's flood is actually greater than the one in the 29th year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign. At that time, the disaster victims in Gaochun, driven by public outrage, rose up in a rebellion and destroyed the dam. However, they were suppressed by autocratic force and ultimately failed. The dam was even raised by three chi, causing this year's floodwaters to be unable to flow over the eastern dam. The disaster victims in Gaochun are now advocating for the abolition of the dam and the restoration of the sluice gates, vowing to fight to the death. In reality, the people of Gaochun are poor and weak, possessing the determination to die but lacking the perseverance to die. It is nothing more than empty threats. The provincial government has already dispatched a dam protection team and issued a dam protection fund. However, it has not considered the plight of the disaster victims in Gaochun, who are facing a life-or-death situation. Is this fair according to the hearts of people and the principles of heaven? Is this just? Perhaps because the eastern dam cannot be abolished and the Tianqiao Bridge cannot be opened, this is the only option left. The only choice is to let the entire Gaochun region remain a watery land forever. However, is there really no other solution? Here is one solution: build another spillway dam. This dam should be designed based on the high-water level of this summer. The lake water depth this summer was two or three zhang, failing to overflow the dam. The height from the top of the dam to the bottom is one zhang. Lower the dam foot by another zhang, and Liyang and Yixing should be lower than the lower dam by two chi, totaling three zhang and two chi. If the spillway dam is three chi lower than the top of the eastern dam, the water will overflow the dam and flow away, with a gradual flow that will not harm Liyang and Yixing. Gaochun's polder fields can avoid one-third of the disaster. If it is four chi lower, it can avoid two-thirds of the disaster. Liyang and Yixing will have the benefit of diverting water from here to there, without the harm of a sudden rush of water. There is no better way to benefit both parties. Two li west of the dam, there is an abandoned river in front of the Zige Pavilion, with the river mouth three li north of the dam, down to the lower dam. Building a spillway dam here would be the most appropriate. If a dike and sluice gate are built at Jinzhu Pass, the benefits and harms can be controlled. It can be asserted that Gaochun, Liyang, Yixing, and other counties will have water conservancy without water damage forever. (Remainder omitted)</p>
<h3>Repatriation of Disaster Victims from Northern Jiangsu: The City of Shanghai Accepts</h3>
<p>The Office for Accepting Disaster Victims in the City of Shanghai previously believed that the floodwaters in most disaster areas had receded, and that disaster victims accepted in various places had also concluded their stay. If Shanghai continues to accept new arrivals, they will come like a flood because: (1) They regard Shanghai as the most ideal place to find a livelihood. (2) They regard Shanghai as a destination for disaster relief and escape from famine due to its prosperity. (3) Disaster victims in various reception centers send letters to their hometowns, inviting their fellow villagers to come to Shanghai. (4) Local impoverished people also mix into the reception centers when disaster victims arrive in the port, hoping to be accepted. (5) When the interior is unable to provide reception, they send disaster victims to Shanghai by boat. Therefore, if the continued reception is not immediately stopped, Shanghai will inevitably be filled with disaster victims one day. Bad elements and vagrants will mingle among them. Once an accident occurs, public safety will be at risk. However, the number of people fleeing famine continues to arrive in an endless stream. Within two or four days, the number reached over 7,000. Outsiders are concerned that the office will no longer accept new arrivals, but they do not know that the reception is only temporary emergency relief and a method to save the dying but not the poor. However, the continuing stream of refugees from northern Jiangsu are issued exit permits by the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus, but they soon return. Currently, they can only be temporarily accommodated in the Second Reception Center. The Disaster Victim Reception Office has consulted with Datong and Dada Shipping Companies to provide free repatriation of the disaster victims. Some of the disaster victims plan to publish articles opposing the repatriation, demanding continued reception, and submitting petitions to the government for relief. Therefore, it is difficult to carry out the repatriation because they are unwilling to leave. However, all the disaster victims from Hubei have been repatriated, and the floodwaters in northern Jiangsu have receded. Transportation is gradually recovering, and various groups have gone to the disaster areas to distribute winter relief. The victims should be sent back to their hometowns to receive the various forms of relief and engage in farming to prepare for next year's plan. If they continue to sit idly by in Shanghai, the vitality of the disaster area will never recover, and the relief will be endless, fostering many beggars. How can this be a blessing for the country and society? Yesterday, the refugees from northern Jiangsu were dispatched in batches by ship back to their original homes. Also, a summary of the quantity of provisions provided to the disaster victims from September 7 to October 25 has been found and is recorded below: 1,133 dan and 9 dou of rice, 1,222 jin of bean oil, 799 bottles of soy sauce, 1,869 jin of salt, 7,069 jin of preserved mustard tuber, 10,064 jin of dried radish, 3,645 jin of soybean sprouts, 11,550 jin of red lotus root, 15,117 jin and 108 bottles of pickled vegetables, and 13,872 jin of green vegetables, and 882 slabs of tofu.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Bloody Battle Between Police and Bandits</h3>
<p>The Water Police are Courageous!</p>
<p>The Bandits are Cunning!</p>
<p>At around 10 o'clock last night, gunshots were heard in the Huacao Creek area of western Shanghai, almost like a continuous barrage. Residents in the vicinity were awakened from their dreams, unsure of the truth and filled with panic. It was only afterward that they learned that it was the Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Water Patrol Unit pursuing bandits. The police were shot and wounded by the bandits. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Men Lurking on the Shore. At around 9 o'clock last night, Hao Jiabang, a member of the Yu Jiadun Police Station of the Municipal Police Department's Water Patrol Team, along with sailor Zhang Shoushan, were patrolling the river in their jurisdiction by rowboat. When the boat reached the western end of Huacao Creek, they noticed three men on the shore south of the creek. Suspecting that the men were suspicious, the police secretly watched them and steered the boat closer to the shore, intending to approach them for inspection. Unexpectedly, when the three men saw the police boat approaching, they immediately ran away. The police became even more suspicious and abandoned the boat to jump ashore, ordering them to stop.</p>
<p>Hao Jiabang Pursues Ferocious Bandits. When the three men saw the police coming ashore, one of them, wearing a copper helmet, pulled out a pistol from his side and fired at the police. The police then knew they had encountered bandits. Hao Jiabang drew his prepared pistol and returned fire, bravely giving chase. During the heavy exchange of gunfire, sailor Zhang Shoushan was shot in the left leg, the bullet exiting and causing profuse bleeding. He collapsed in pain. Seeing Zhang wounded, Hao Jiabang continued to chase alone. Before long, he managed to grab one of the bandits who fired the shots, hugging him tightly from behind and seizing his pistol.</p>
<p>Bandit Bites Police Finger and Escapes. After being grabbed by the police, the bandit, in desperation, lowered his head and bit Hao Jiabang's left little finger, almost severing it. Hao Jiabang, wounded and bleeding, felt excruciating pain and became dizzy. The bandit then struggled violently and broke free, fleeing and disappearing in an instant. Hao Jiabang took the pistol he had seized from the bandit, along with the copper helmet that had been left on the ground during the struggle, and hurried back to the police station. He had the wounded sailor Zhang Shoushan carried onto the boat and rushed back to the police station, where Police Chief Meng sent Hao Jiabang and Zhang Shoushan to the hospital for treatment. He also reported the matter to Captain Xu of the General Team. Realizing the importance of the matter, Captain Xu ordered a detailed report to be submitted to the Municipal Police Department for investigation.</p>
<h3>Ah Shu's Gang from Lake Tai</h3>
<p>Tailor Ah Jin Captured</p>
<p>The ferocious bandit Xu Ah Jin (also known as Xu Xi, a tailor by trade, nicknamed Tailor Ah Jin, from Mojia Hui in Jinshan County) previously served as a false battalion commander under the lake bandit Ah Shu of Lake Tai, engaging in robbery, kidnapping, and all sorts of evil deeds. After Ah Shu and his gang were executed, Ah Jin fled to Shanghai. The Bandit Suppression Command issued a reward of 500 yuan for his capture, but he remained at large. Water Police Team One, led by Captain Fan Guozhong, learned that Xu was frequently seen in the South City. Captain Fan immediately led detectives to Shanghai to investigate. On the morning of the second day, at 11:30 AM, Captain Fan received a tip-off that Xu was eating in a small restaurant on the triangle street of Xuejia Creek in the South City. They rushed to the scene and found Xu and his accomplice Gan A Zuo sitting at a table, drinking and chatting happily. The detectives entered the restaurant and arrested them both. Xu had a Browning pistol in his pocket, loaded with six bullets. He did not have time to draw the gun and resist arrest. He was immediately taken to the police precinct and escorted back to the team headquarters by train that evening for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ordinance Factory to Test Cannons Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ordinance Factory of the Ministry of War has recently manufactured many new types of cannons. In order to test their performance, the factory has scheduled a cannon test at the West Fortress today. The military authorities have been notified, and nearby residents have been informed.</p>
<h3>Public Concession</h3>
<p>October Statistics on Traffic Accidents</p>
<p>An Astounding Twenty Deaths</p>
<p>The Greater Shanghai Evening News reported that the Traffic Department of the Public Concession Police has compiled statistics for traffic accidents in the concession in October, totaling 1,279 cases, with a shocking twenty deaths and 448 injuries. The accidents involved 1,017 automobiles, resulting in thirteen deaths and 296 injuries. Tram accidents resulted in three deaths and 36 injuries. Public bus accidents also resulted in three deaths and eighteen injuries.</p>
<h3>Pacific Association</h3>
<p>American Representatives Visit Various Agencies</p>
<p>Mr. Herold S. Quigley, an American representative who came to Shanghai to participate in the Pacific Association, visited the Second Special District Local Court of the French Concession and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, accompanied by lawyer Lin Yingqing. He was warmly received by the presidents of the two courts, Liang Renjie and Ying Shi, who led him on a tour of the various courtrooms before he departed. After the Pacific Association meeting adjourned yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Mr. Quigley again visited the Jiangsu High Court to meet with Presidents Xu and Yang. President Xu led him on a tour of the civil and criminal courts of the two courts before he departed. It is evident that foreigners are paying particular attention to our country's judiciary.</p>
<h3>Racing Association</h3>

<h3>Imposters Distributing Poisonous Medicine</h3>
<p>Municipal Health Bureau Issues Warning to Citizens</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has learned that some people are falsely claiming to be sent by the bureau to distribute epidemic prevention medicine that can be dissolved in water to prevent infectious diseases. The bureau has issued a notice to the public that this is not true and that citizens should not be deceived. The bureau has also sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, ordering police officers in various districts to arrest and investigate the suspects. Subsequently, citizens submitted medicinal pills obtained to the bureau for testing. The Health Testing Laboratory confirmed that the pills contained trace amounts of arsenic and were insoluble in water. The bureau has again notified the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate and arrest the individuals falsely distributing medicine.</p>
<h3>County Government Strictly Investigating Opium Cases</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has recently issued orders to various Public Security Bureaus to strictly detain and prosecute those involved in prohibited activities such as opium, gambling, and prostitution within the county. In addition, upon receiving reports, arrests are to be made immediately. The day before yesterday, a confidential report was received stating that there were several privately established opium dens in Tangwan Town, Second District of the county. The county immediately dispatched inspectors to arrest Li Weisheng, Jin Fugen, Peng Atang, and the women Li Bai Shi and Jin Liu Shi, who were selling opium privately. All opium paraphernalia was confiscated, and the suspects were escorted to the county, and yesterday they were transferred to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Reduced Fares on Taikoo Yangtze Line</h3>
<p>In order to better accommodate Chinese passengers, Taikoo Wharf has decided to reduce the fares for the specially designated official cabins on the Wuhu and Wuxue new ships by 25%. The fare from Shanghai to Hankou was originally 40 yuan, but has now been reduced to 30 yuan. Other fares to various ports along the lower Yangtze River have also been reduced accordingly. However, the reduced fares are only available to passengers who order Chinese meals. Those who wish to order Western meals will still be required to pay the old price. It is reported that the new fares will be implemented starting from the day the Wuhu ship sets sail on the 7th of this month. The China Travel Service on Sichuan Road handles all ticket sales and can issue tickets directly, so passengers no longer need to wait long. This is a great convenience.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Calico Ship</h3>
<p>Two Suspects Arrested in Wusong</p>
<p>The Hongzhang Cotton Mill in Shanghai ordered one hundred bales of calico from the American Mei Yuan Trading Company. The shipment was handled by the Gao Erting Trading Company on Wuma Road in Shanghai. The shipment was hired a boat to barge the cargo to the mill to unload on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Twenty-one bales were unloaded due to it being late that day, and the remaining seventy-nine bales were to be unloaded the next morning. The boat was moored on the riverbank overnight and the boatmen Guo Tianyi, Zhang Afu, and Yu Baosheng were instructed to guard the cargo. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 PM, more than ten robbers armed with pistols boarded the ship, tied up the three boatmen with ropes, stuffed cotton into their mouths to prevent them from making any noise, and hid them in the hold, covering them with flat floorboards. The robbers then hired a small steamer and towed the calico ship to Wusong, intending to sell the cargo to a certain cotton mill. Yesterday, the mill, suspecting that the calico had been obtained illegally, refused to purchase it. The mill reported the matter to the police of the Seventh District of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. Section Chief Zeng immediately dispatched police to investigate. The robbers, realizing that their scheme had been exposed, had already fled. The police confiscated the ship's cargo and rescued the three boatmen from the hold, who were on the verge of death due to the cotton stuffed in their mouths. In the afternoon, two suspects were arrested near Zhanghuabang and taken to the police station for questioning. It is reported that the calico is worth over 15,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Account of Lake Bandits Kidnapping Passengers on the Flying Cloud Steamboat</h3>
<p>A Total of Twenty-Three Kidnapped</p>
<p>Seven Still Held</p>
<p>The Tongyuan Bureau's Flying Cloud steamboat, which travels between Suzhou, Dongting, and Dongshan, was raided by more than twenty armed lake bandits on the morning of the first day while sailing from Dongshan to Suzhou, at the Tingzigang area outside the Hengjing ferry. Before leaving, the bandits kidnapped seventeen male and female passengers. The Dongshan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai has telegraphed the Provincial Government and the Wuxian Public Security Bureau, urging them to immediately order the army and police to rescue the hostages. According to Mr. Xu Chunsheng, a fellow villager from Dongshan who was recently released from the bandits' lair, a total of twenty-three male and female passengers were kidnapped from the steamboat that day. The bandits interrogated each passenger, most of whom were in Shanghai as dependent housewives and were not wealthy. The bandits believed that the Chu couple, who were in the foreign goods business, and their sister, as well as Fu Zhongde, the principal of the County Zhongxiu Girls' School, teacher Qian, and Yan Jisheng, an employee of the Mercantile Bank, were the wealthiest and instructed those released to deliver messages to their families, demanding ransoms ranging from 30,000 to 500,000 yuan. Therefore, fourteen people were released at that time, and two more were released later. Seven people remain in the bandits' lair. The bandits paid particular attention to a certain Yan Jing'an, the manager of a money shop, and Jin Jie Zhi. Fortunately, neither of them was among the passengers. It was fortunate indeed.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Voices P] Xu Xiaoting Some say the September 18th Incident and the May 3rd Massacre are like comparing half a catty to eight taels, both being profound and cruel stimuli given to us by the violent Japanese. The compatriots who died in the May 3rd Massacre only left fragmented traces in history, like fleeting clouds. The memory of the people has faded considerably. In the September 18th Incident, how resolute and united the compatriots across the country were in opposing the violent Japanese and boycotting inferior goods! However, hasn't the course of the people after the May 3rd Incident been the same? Looking back, it has become a thing of the past. Our national humiliation increases year by year, and the brutality of the Japanese becomes more severe with each instance. How can we save ourselves and seek survival? It all depends on the patriotism and perseverance of the people. Excluding Ting Cao Zhai's trivial talks and the unification of a "Lumping Brother." Excluding Tingzhou Qifu, Hui. As for "Lumping Brother," no one knows his surname or given name. Everyone calls him "Lumping Brother" because he speaks vaguely and because he is a bit older. He is from the chaotic country, vague province, muddled county, and imprisoned village. If you ask him his age, he says, "Just ten years old." If you ask him how old his grandmother is, he says, "Old." If you ask him how many sons he has, he says, "Several." If you ask him how many bowls of rice he eats per meal, he says, "Quite a few." If you ask him how many dollars he earns a month, he says, "Not many." If you ask him how far his country is from China, he says, "Very, very close." If you ask him how far his country is from Germany, he says, "Very, very far." One year, the president of the chaotic country heard of Lumping Brother's great name and invited him to come out of retirement to handle universal education. This president had probably read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and was determined to find a Pang Tong to help him. He mistook the character "籠" (lóng, meaning cage or vague) for "龐" (páng, the surname of Pang Tong). So, Lumping Brother rose to prominence, turning all the elementary school teachers of the chaotic country into "Lumping Teachers," and the children into "Little Lumpings." If you don't believe it, look at their lesson: Little Lumping Teacher: How big is Japan? Lumping Teacher: Very small, very small. Little Lumping Teacher: How many people are there in Japan? Lumping Teacher: Many, very many. Little Lumping Teacher: Why does Japan want to seize our Northeast Three Provinces? Lumping Teacher: Because the natural resources of the Northeast Three Provinces are very rich, very rich. Why do you keep asking me? I have to ask you a few questions, children. How big is China? Little Lumping: Very big, very big. Lumping Teacher: Correct. Class dismissed. Little Lumping: Attention! One, two, three! From then on, the chaotic country was monopolized and unified by Lumping Brother and his disciples and grand-disciples. This vague unification is impenetrable by guns and cannons, requires no opening of peace talks, and is a natural consensus to resist foreign aggression. Scattered Thoughts S.cience, the Cultural Invasion of a Nation, Japanese Espionage Anecdotes, by Yunjian Poor Swordsman. The foreign policy of the Japanese is nothing more than the four words: cunning, treacherous, insidious, and poisonous. Their spies sent to other countries are like mercury seeping into the ground, entering without leaving a trace. And the names they use are invariably the most ordinary, to deceive people's eyes and ears. Before the 甲午 (Sino-Japanese) War, the Shanshen Garden in Shanghai had a Japanese-Qing Trade Research Association. Those coming and going were all wearing wooden clogs, only sometimes changing into Chinese attire. The neighbors were used to it and initially paid no attention. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the members of the association suddenly scattered, and the sign was also removed. The neighbors did not suspect anything else. Later, in an inn somewhere (roughly the French Concession), two Japanese men wearing monks' robes were suddenly arrested by detectives, one named Nan Nan Yojiro, and the other whose name I have forgotten. Maps, secret codes, diaries, and other crucial evidence were found in their luggage. It was then realized that they were Japanese spies in China. After interrogation, they were escorted to the Daotai's office and then transferred to Ningyuan for execution. When they were being escorted in Shanghai, they were seen by the neighbors of the Japanese men in Shanshen Garden. It was then that everyone realized that they were all members of the so-called Japanese-Qing Trade Research Association, and that the association was actually a Japanese espionage agency in China. When the war ended and victory or defeat was determined, Japanese newspapers also detailed the matter without the slightest concealment, even praising the association's various merits. This is one incident. Furthermore, the deep resentment of the Japanese towards a certain country is known by all nations in the world, and Japanese spies venturing far into that country to gather secret information are like ants boring into a pearl with nine turns, taking advantage of every opportunity to enter. Ten years ago, I happened to read a church newspaper that described in great detail how a naval leader of a certain country discovered a Japanese spy. I will now recount it: A naval admiral of a certain country hired a Japanese servant who was fair and refined, intelligent and quick-witted, and also deeply proficient in English and American languages and writing. Moreover, he served his master diligently and cautiously, and was able to anticipate his master's intentions, so he deeply gained his master's favor. One day, his master invited military officers from a neighboring country to a banquet on the ship. After the host and guests were seated, the servant also stood by to serve diligently. The naval admiral of the neighboring country in the seat of honor frequently stared at the servant. The master suspected that he also liked the servant, so he boasted to the guest, saying, "This boy always does things according to my wishes, so I deeply love him." The guest, hearing this, could only respond with "Yes, yes," and then a forced smile. Later, seeing the servant being sent by his master to the bedroom to retrieve something, the guest secretly told the master, "Your esteemed servant seems to have a familiar face to me. His position in his own country is probably no less than ours. Now that he is humbling himself as a servant, he must have a purpose. You must be careful." Before long, as the banquet was ending, the guest departed. The admiral immediately ordered the servant to be detained and his luggage to be thoroughly searched. Only a diary was found, with characters as small as ants. What was recorded in it included the organization of a certain country's navy, secret orders, the contents of each warship, the structure of the gun emplacements, the range of the projectiles, the effectiveness of the instruments, and the layout of the national fortresses, all recorded in detail without omission. It was then realized that this was a glimpse into Japan's ambition towards that country. As for how this matter was handled, because it concerned military secrets, outsiders had no way of knowing the outcome. This is another incident. Alas, if the Japanese were like this toward a certain country's navy, then their attitude towards that country's other secrets can be imagined. If they were like this towards a certain country, then their attitude towards all other major countries can be even more imagined! The Departed are Like This Zong Kai Mr. Liu Zhixiang, named Kun, was a Hanlin scholar in the late Qing Dynasty. He taught at the Beijing University Hall, the Normal School, and the Translation School. He also founded the Dongcheng School in his hometown of Lanxi. His students were numerous and highly regarded at one time. He passed away this spring in his Shanghai residence. Reminiscences from the past, Beijing University, Di Xiang Zhai, Pleasant Conversations. Shi Zhaoji Speakers say that China lacks diplomatic talent. It is not that there is no talent, but that in times when talent is surrounded by foreign powers, incessantly provoked, where every demand must be met and every desire satisfied, even if there are talented individuals, they are unable to show their abilities. In the past twenty years, the so-called diplomats are too numerous to count. Figures like Wang Daxie, Liang Dunyan, and Sun Baoqi have passed away. Lu Zhengxiang has become a monk, and Hu Weide is old and frail, none of them possessing the skills to negotiate effectively. Wu Tingfang was truly commendable, but sadly, he is no longer with us. Tang Shaoyi, equally famous, has long been out of power and now reluctantly serves in a minor post under the Party-State. Cao Rulin and Lu Zongyu are almost completely abandoned by the people. Wang Rongbao has just resigned, and Chen Jin is quietly unknown. In the most recent decade or so, those who have prominently emerged include Yan Huiqing, Gu Weijun, Wang Zhengting, Huang Fu, and Wu Chaochu. Huiqing has risen through the ranks gradually, possessing considerable political acumen. The others, being scholars, have leaped to high positions. Their political achievements and actions deserve separate essays. I will now cater to current tastes and talk about Shi Zhaoji. Zhaoji, styled Zhizhi, is from Wuxing, Zhejiang. In the late Qing Dynasty, Shi Zijing, a candidate for Daotai, became famous in Shanghai as a philanthropist. He was Zhaoji's father. In his youth, Zhaoji was elegant and well-dressed. While studying in America, those who did not know him mistook him for a frivolous young man. At that time, Tang Shaoyi, having resigned from his post in Washington, saw him and considered him a fine gentleman, expecting great things from him. He then married Zhaoji to the daughter of his elder brother. With Shi and Tang having cemented their relationship through marriage, Shaoyi favored him even more. Zhaoji successively served as an attaché in the British and American embassies. Later, as a Daotai, he was assigned to Zhili province. When Shaoyi was appointed Governor of Fengtian, the Governor-General, Xu Shichang, said that Zhaoji was proficient in Western languages and knowledgeable about current affairs. Shichang memorialized to the court, transferring him to Liaoning and recommending him for the position of Binjiang Customs Daotai. He was later transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a Right Councilor, eventually rising to Right Vice Minister. After the Republic was established, Shaoyi assumed the position of Prime Minister, appointing Zhaoji as Minister of Communications. A certain party's member of parliament claimed that he was young and inexperienced, almost denying his appointment. After assuming office, most of the ministry's officials were henchmen of a certain faction, causing conflict in every matter. Zhaoji, unable to endure this, wanted to resign but ultimately resigned at the same time as Shaoyi. Later, he was appointed as the ambassador to England for nearly a decade, never failing in his mission. He cannot be said to be untalented. Now that the Japanese pirates are rampant, the League of Nations conference has convened, and Zhaoji has spoken out righteously, frequently representing the delegation. His indignant and resentful spirit is revealed in his expressions. The government has praised his righteous indignation, appointing him as the chief minister to shoulder the diplomatic burden. It is a pity that the conference has only just begun and the negotiations are not yet concluded. His stay in England still has time. If not for such a major issue to address, Zhaoji might not have been able to fully demonstrate his talent. Those from a certain party who previously said he was young and incompetent can now dispel their doubts. Students falsely reporting meetings at this temple's branch temple to commemorate deceased relatives and friends, with hundreds of elegiac couplets, many of them excellent. Here are some of the best: Jin Liang said, "Morality transmitted loyalty and determination, writing inherited brilliance." His praise is extensive. Mr. Jin's seal script is treasured by the world; this is his handwriting, making it even more precious. Wu Shi Tong said, "Twenty years as a staff officer repaying his patron's kindness, ten thousand scrolls of books making this old man talented." Wang Yitang said, "Secretary's fame, talent never exhausted in books, entrusting fate late, surpassing grief." Shen Junye said, "But discussing writing, there is already fame and reputation like Qi Yan Xu, if meeting opportunity, there will be achievements comparable to Xiao Cao." Mao Youfeng said, "Xiao He was originally a scribe, Zhao Pu was even more a rustic fool. Born not meeting great thieves, letting embroidered phoenixes and carved dragons grow old, starve, and freeze, today I am most saddened." Yuan Ying initiated enlightenment, Wen Chen He Fen truly produced Tang Prime Ministers. Learning values transmission, moreover, there are two Ding, two arrived and radiant, flower calyx thousand autumns, public unique more." Also, Mao Youfeng, on behalf of someone, wrote a couplet: "Saying what writing hates fate, goblins being human is too profound, and now truly overturned. Wishing generation after generation never again to read books and recognize characters, pitiable saying of department helping wheel meeting, villagers again to Shanghai (6)." Bao Tianxiao Everyone tells him that this is not a sleeping car, but indeed a third-class car. He then finds a place to sit, finally believing that it is indeed a third-class car. "Old man, brew a pot of tea?" A tea boy walks over with a smile. The villager is used to drinking tea in the countryside and is indeed a bit thirsty. He thinks that third-class cars are good because they even have tea to drink. He heard that those in second-class cars even get to eat big dishes. "Brew a pot! Brew a pot!" He says loudly. After a while, the tea boy brings the tea. He takes a sip. "(The tea leaves aren't bad.)" The tea boy stands beside him, seeing that he hasn't moved. "(Old man! Excuse me! Tea money.)" The old treasure rudely reaches out to ask. "(How much is the tea money?)" He opens his eyes wide. "(Two 'eight-opens'.") The tea boy also stretches out two fingers. He thinks he's really been cheated. In the small tea houses in the countryside, brewing a pot of tea costs at most eight copper coins. If he had brought his own tea leaves and just had hot water added, it would only cost two copper coins. Today, this pot of tea costs him two dimes of silver. That bamboo has been knocked for all it's worth. He wants to return the tea to the tea boy, but the tea boy refuses to let him return it because the tea has already been drunk. Many people advise, "We also pay two dimes of silver for a pot, so he's not cheating anyone." The villager thinks he shouldn't cause any more trouble with the venomous language of selling tea eggs in fourth-class cars, so he has to painfully take out two dimes of silver from a small paper packet wrapped in five or six sheets of paper. Now that he's sitting down and has tea to drink, he takes out his water pipe, loads it with tobacco, and slowly smokes it. He sees that a guest sitting opposite him is opening a newspaper, shaking his head and reading. Although the villager can also recognize a few characters, he can't bear to spend money to buy a newspaper. He casts his eyes to the back of the newspaper that the guest is reading and sees that several squares on the paper are blank. This is commonly called "opening a skylight." The villager thinks, "How come newspapers are all turning into 'bald heads' now? Bald heads have many places on their heads that are shiny and hairless. This newspaper also has piles of blank spaces. He can call it a 'bald-head newspaper.'" "(They waste too much paper,") he says, shaking his head. "(Isn't it good to cut out this large piece of blank paper and write a note? If you make the square bigger, you can even draw a chessboard and we can play some rotten chess!)"</h3>

<p>Business News Financial Silver Price Plummets Endlessly Continuing sharp declines of fifteen taels yesterday. The silver price frequently plummeted, the surging tide and huge waves were difficult to restrain. There were only fluctuations of two or three taels. As a result, it continued to plunge by fifteen taels, having fallen for five or six days consecutively. This was truly rare. It was likely that the surge in overseas silver markets was intensifying. The opening price was already low, and further because countries such as France, America, and Germany were frequently holding meetings regarding the world economic bailout, and the Northeast Japanese寇 riots were still fierce, the intentions of the industry were uncertain. Furthermore, foreign exchange rates were loose, with the English rates being especially weak. Both overt and covert policies were lenient.

Yesterday, the association's regular meeting resolved that the Xin Ge for this interest rate would be ten taels and ninety-five扣, which is one times higher than in September, close to the highest price in recent years. If the price is so high, then the additional cost for borrowers must be between sixteen and seventeen taels, which is an unearned commercial depreciation for the general financial community. Bonds Complete Six Military Cuts Rebound Two Yuan and a Half. Strong Market, 1,500,000 in Transactions. Yesterday (3rd), the market transaction situation of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange. The spot market opened with many varieties and active trading. The popularity of the futures market was even more prosperous. Major bonds had quite a large volume of transactions. As of yesterday, the market price of each bond was trending more towards buying than selling, so the price was even more firm. In the initial opening, there were still various varieties that were a little less than one yuan, but after the active buying, they rose one after another. Among them, 兵整六 and other products were the most popular, and the price increase was also the most vigorous. 19 Customs Good and 20捲 also rose quite significantly. The closing price in the morning market had already risen by a half to one and a half yuan. The afternoon market initially started very firm, such as 编遣, 裁兵, and others, still moving firmly upwards. However, the selling side had quite a few sales, and the market had a slight reaction, such as 统税 and 盐税, which were slightly less than one yuan compared to the morning. As a result, compared to the previous day, 除 六编遣 spot and 盐税 near-term prices fell slightly. 二○关九六 this month's term and 盐税 next month's term prices did not move. The other continued to rise. The 整六裁兵 futures rose by about two and a half yuan. Others also rose by half a yuan to several jiao. 裁兵盐税一九善 and other spot prices rose by up to four or five yuan. The continued rise in bond market prices should still be because the 環象 is better, and the market is taking advantage of the low prices to invest actively. However, although the debt market is in good shape, the people in the market are not as 非如前之. There are many changes in the diplomatic situation. The future of the debt market is not 过 爲. The total spot transaction for the whole day was 45,000 yuan. Futures were more than 9,500,000 in the morning market and more than 5,700,000 in the afternoon, totaling 15,330,000 yuan.

<h3>Three Suicides</h3>
<p>Chen Ruizhen, 24 years old from Guangdong, was the concubine of Liang Shanlin, a Cantonese man. Liang worked at the Oriental Weighing Factory on Seward Road. He already had a wife at home. After getting to know Chen, he rented a house with her at No. 16 Taiqing Lane, Fusheng Road in the Chinese Concession. Initially, they were very close and harmonious, but later Liang’s first wife, Guo, found out and went to make trouble, causing a big argument. In a fit of anger, Ruizhen secretly took poison the night before and died at around 10 a.m. yesterday. The sub-landlord Liu Shuxian reported it to the Second Precinct of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau. It was said that the deceased had come with her husband to rent the house three months ago, and Chen committed suicide by swallowing opium after Liang’s wife came to make a fuss. It is heard that Chen Ruizhen was originally a registered prostitute. Liang Shanlin met her in February and started living together in March. Now she is six months pregnant. After her death, there was a letter, one addressed to her husband and one to Mrs. Jiang, the former landlord. The letter described her life in sorrowful words.</p>
<p>Mr. Gao, a worker, lived at No. 156 Qidiqiwuqing Road, Yangshupu. Mr. Gao, 48 years old, was currently unemployed at home and liked to smoke opium. He relied on his wife working in a yarn factory for a living. Yesterday afternoon at half past one, his wife had just returned home from work when Gao’s opium addiction flared up. He asked his wife for money to buy opium, but his wife said that the income from her female labor was barely enough to provide for their livelihood, so where would there be extra money for him to buy opium? A quarrel ensued. Afterwards, Gao was so angry that he had the idea of dying, so he hanged himself. Later, his wife discovered it and reported it to the police station, which ordered Patrol Officer No. 256 to come and take the body to the Tongren Hospital before transferring it to the morgue to await examination by the court.</p>
<p>Zeng Youxue, a native of Jiangsu, Cao Youxue, 19 years old, used to be a silk weaving worker but is now unemployed in Shanghai. He suffered from economic pressure and felt that there was no point in living, so he might as well die to end it all. At around 3 p.m., he checked into the Xinli Inn at the West New Bridge and secretly took poison to kill himself. It was not until 10 a.m. the next morning that the waiter discovered it and urgently reported it to the police station, which ordered Detective Wang Licheng to come and send the body to Renji Hospital before transferring it to the Tongren Fuyuantang for examination.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee Meeting Held Yesterday by Journalists</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Journalists Association held a temporary meeting of the Executive Committee at 4 p.m. yesterday.

<h3>Lawsuit Regarding the Sino-American Bank Scam</h3>
<p>According to the Wuchen Society, the Sino-American Banking Company at No. 13 Guangdong Road was a swindling company jointly established by Ma Zhichao, Li Henian (also known as Zhong Hongsen), Li Yaoguang, and Cheng Chunlin (also known as Yi Kun). It embezzled the guarantee deposits of its employees and huge amounts of deposits from customers. Less than three months after opening, it suddenly closed at the end of last month. The above four people have all fled and are nowhere to be seen. The creditors of the company were shocked and horrified after hearing the news. Shi Mou and the Nanyang Advertising Company, among other creditors, successively published warnings about the company and, together with the employees whose guarantee deposits had been swindled by the company, organized a creditors' group and set up a liaison office at No. 559 Donghua Lane, Middle City, Simalu, to notify all creditors to register and join the case within five days. Ms. Wu, an employee of the company, commissioned lawyer Tang Huaiqun of No. 34 Beijing Road to provide legal assistance. Lawyer Tang accompanied Ms. Wu to report to the General Inspectorate and requested urgent action. The police station then sent Western Detective Kakolaw Dot and Detective Kang, among others, to arrest the suspects at the address. Because Ma and Cheng had already escaped, only the two Lis were arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were transferred to the Criminal Court of the First Special District for trial.</p>
<h3>Silk Mercerizing and Dyeing Industry</h3>
<p>Concrete Measures Already in Place for Raw Materials</p>
<p>Using British Goods to Replace Japanese Goods After Rejecting Them</p>
<p>However, the Industry Believes That This is Quite Difficult</p>
<p>After Japan forcibly occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, the Chinese people automatically launched an economic boycott against Japan, and the silk mercerizing and dyeing industry in this city faced a shortage of raw materials. The industry association petitioned the authorities to allow them to appropriately reduce the number of workers. The Ministry of Industry has concrete measures for raw materials. The various situations are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Workers Petition: The Silk Mercerizing Branch of the Dyeing Industry Union believes that the suspension of silk mercerizing factories has a great impact on the livelihoods of workers. After a general meeting, it was decided to send representatives Liu Jintai and Lu Muqin to the Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau at 9 a.m. yesterday to petition and request that measures be taken quickly to maintain and prevent factories from stopping production or laying off workers under the pretext of a lack of raw materials. The Daxin Factory, which has already closed, was ordered to resume operations immediately to maintain the livelihoods of workers and ensure the development of industrial production. It is heard that the results were very satisfactory and that the party and government agencies agreed to issue instructions to stop this.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Instruction: The Silk Mercerizing and Cotton Weaving Industry Association received a reply from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday stating that it had received a telegram from the association stating that the shortage of raw materials and cotton yarn made it difficult to maintain the current situation and requesting permission to dismiss the employees in the factory or close the factory to end the situation. The Bureau has already sent a letter to the Party Headquarters and informed them of the instructions. Now, the Municipal Government's Instruction No. 10214 roughly states that the Jiangzhe Dyeing and Weaving Industry Federation sent a telegram stating that national goods and yarn are not suitable for use, and factories are planning to dismiss employees or close part of the factories. The telegram was replied to, stating that what they had said would hinder workers' lives and industrial production and should not be approved. The telegram also stated that the Federation had sent a telegram to the visiting bureau, stating that there are now many national-made yarns available. Those who use 42-strand yarn may replace it with 20-count yarn. Some factories in Shanghai are already doing this. Even those who must use 42-strand yarn can purchase British goods. The current market price of 42-strand yarn in Shanghai is 400 taels, while British goods are only 350 taels, which is actually lower. If you do not know how to purchase and order, the Bureau can help with the contact. Based on this, if the factories in Jiangzhe and Shanghai are unclear about the situation and arbitrarily stop production or reduce the number of employees, the relevant government agencies should pay attention to and stop them at any time to maintain the livelihoods of workers. Please investigate and handle this in accordance with the instructions. The cotton yarn and raw materials department has already resolved the electricity issue. The trade union should quickly comply with this order to maintain the livelihoods of workers and develop industrial production. The request to dismiss employees or close the factory should not be discussed.</p>
<p>Industry Opinion: A reporter from Xin Sheng News visited the Silk Mercerizing and Dyeing Industry Association yesterday to ask for their opinion on the raw material problem. It was said that after the silk mercerizing and dyeing industry refused to import Japanese goods, there was a panic about raw materials. They had no choice but to submit a request to the authorities to allow them to reduce the number of workers. Now, the Ministry of Industry's remedy is to order British goods as a replacement. However, there is currently no stock of double-strand yarn produced in Manchester, England. If you make a custom order, it will take at least three months to reach Shanghai, including one month for the goods and the time it takes to load the ship. There are also issues with the "mian piao" [cotton allocation coupons], which is actually quite difficult. It is also feared that it cannot be supported in terms of time. It is heard that the industry will submit another request to the authorities for remedies.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation</h3>
<p>General Meeting of Representatives from District Branches</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation convened a general meeting of representatives from district branches at 2 p.m. yesterday. 118 representatives from various district branches attended. Wang Hanliang, Zhang Yichen, and Hu Yanxiang were publicly elected as the presidium to preside over the meeting. The ceremony was conducted as usual. (A) Report Matters (Omitted). (B) Discussion of Proposals (1) The case of unifying peace, solidarity, and resisting foreign aggression is the expectation of the people.

(2) The case of Shanghai and the Yangtze River, etc., where the Japanese people in Shanghai should express their oath to resist Japan and save the country to the absurd words and brutal aggressive strategies of the Japanese National Assembly. It was decided to issue a warning letter to stop the insidious means and refute the absurd remarks. (3) For the 18th Branch members of Yongfengxiang, the Japanese goods sealed by the Federation were dismantled by the inspection team of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association without any reason, how should it be advocated to emphasize the anti-Japanese and national salvation campaign? It was decided to seriously negotiate and recommend Liu Zhongying and Wang Jian'e as representatives to negotiate with the Anti-Japanese Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the community to investigate. The meeting discussed other cases of national salvation until after 5 o'clock before adjourning.</p>
<h3>British Lieutenant General Mackinnon Returns Home</h3>

The British Army, the US Marine Corps, the French Army, and the International Corps of the Public Concession all sent teams to the new customs pier to see him off. It is heard that Lieutenant General Mackinnon will retire after returning to England due to old age.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Issues Unilateral Statement</h3>
<p>Staff members of the Japanese Embassy in this city yesterday issued two documents of declaration, which were largely for Japanese propaganda. One listed 53 cases that the Japanese side considered to be Chinese infringements on Japanese rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia. The content was roughly the same as that published in this newspaper a few days ago. The other described the anti-Japanese situation in Shanghai, with particular emphasis on resisting goods, detailing the various anti-Japanese organizations and their resolutions and various resisting goods actions. School military training, rejection of Japanese disaster relief supplies, and anti-Japanese speeches were also included.</p>
<h3>Minzhi Dismisses a Large Number of Workers</h3>
<p>The Labor Union Held an Emergency Meeting to Discuss It</p>
<p>The Treatment Conditions of Zhonghua are Being Investigated</p>
<p>After the workers of the Zhonghua and Minzhi Book Bureaus in this city resumed work, Li Hongbin of Zhonghua and Jin Shifa of Minzhi are still being refused reinstatement by the capitalists. Regarding the treatment conditions of Zhonghua, the Municipal Government Arbitration Committee convened arbitration and ordered the workers to recommend nine representatives to directly negotiate with the capitalists. If a solution could not be found within a week, the case would be reported to the Municipal Government for further arbitration. The Municipal Government's Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to investigate together. Gu Fusheng, the foreman of the typesetting department of Minzhi, resigned the other day. The capitalists announced that all 41 workers in the typesetting department would be dismissed due to the resignation of the foreman. After receiving a report from the workers, the labor union immediately reported it to the Publishing Industry Union for verification. The union convened an emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors at 2 p.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>After the Seamen's Union Was Sealed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Telegram Was Sent to the Central Government Requesting That It Be Unsealed</p>
<p>At the Same Time, a Letter Was Sent to the Court Questioning It</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Seamen's Union Restructuring Committee at No. 450 Qiujiang Road was sealed by the local court together with the Second Precinct of the Fifth District Police Station on the morning of the 2nd due to the former Zhonghua Seamen's Industrial Federation owing rent. This affected the progress of the union's affairs, and people from all walks of life who did not know the truth came to express their condolences. All members of the union committee yesterday sent a telegram to the Central Training Department, requesting that the National Government be immediately ordered to unseal the union to facilitate the union's affairs. At the same time, a letter was sent to the local court questioning it.</p>
<h3>County Government Instructions on Submitting a Request to Reduce Taxes</h3>
<p>It Is Difficult to Petition the Throne to Reduce the Taxes by Seven Percent</p>
<p>The county suffered from floods and typhoons this year and has been ordered to reduce taxes by seven percent. The County Finance Bureau has announced this. The head of the first district in the county and others have presented a petition to the county government, requesting that the provincial department be transferred to reduce the tax burden to alleviate the people's suffering, etc. After the county government received the petition, it immediately issued the following instructions: "The farmland in the various districts suffered from wind and rain this year, and the harvest was poor. The county magistrate is deeply concerned about the livelihood of the farmers. When the provincial commissioners came to the county for inspection, they repeatedly discussed reducing taxes. However, the provincial commissioners believed that the disaster situation in Jiangnan was more serious than the floods in the counties north of the Yangtze River this year, and the degree of disaster was very different. Although the counties such as Shangbao have reduced their taxes, comparing them to the actual situation of the counties in the province this year, it is difficult to reduce the levy by even a penny. After repeated requests, it was possible to reduce the taxes by 10 percent and report them to the Provincial Finance Department. The Provincial Finance Department instructed that it could not approve the reduction, and after the county government made a sincere request, it finally received instructions approving the exemption of seven percent, and the actual levy should still be 93 percent, and no further petitions should be made. The county magistrate has repeatedly considered the situation and even if he submitted the situation, he was afraid that it would be difficult to obtain approval. The district chiefs should carefully explain the severe disaster situation in the counties in the province this year and the county's tax reduction process to the farmers. Please follow this order."</p>

<h3>The Second Volume, Eighth Issue of Humanistic Monthly is Published</h3>

The writing in this issue is even more valuable than before. Among them, such as Mr. Wen Yu's "A Brief Study of the Floods in Jiangsu in the Last Hundred Years," which details the floods in Jiangsu in the last hundred years from the eleventh year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty to this year, can be used as a reference for those who govern water. Mr. Pan Guangdan's "Zhang Shizhai's Views on Genealogy" are very novel. Mr. Wen Yu's "Documents on Qing Officials Dealing with Korean Rebellions during the Eleventh and Twelfth Years of Guangxu," a document that mostly contains materials that ordinary people have not seen. The article "China Wants to Hear About the Posmos Negotiations Between Japan and Russia but is Not Allowed" and "Notes on the Old Red Plum Pavilion" describe valuable historical facts in modern times and are particularly interesting. There is also "Poems Outside the Collection of Mr. Tinglin," a book of eighteen secret treasures that is very precious.

<h3>Reader's Letter</h3>
<p>A Message from Mr. Cheng Weixia of Leping</p>
<p>(Question: How to make people in the interior distinguish between Japanese and national goods?)</p>
<p>The violent Japanese invaders have invaded and occupied our Eastern provinces for no reason, brutally massacred our fellow countrymen in the Eastern provinces, and robbed us of our public and private property. All of our citizens are indignant. Therefore, the provinces, counties, and towns in our country have organized the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to carry out an economic boycott against Japan and inspect enemy goods. In Leping, Jiangxi, I am a partner in a cloth store, and I try my best to persuade customers to buy national goods and not enemy goods every day. I myself have always loved and used national goods and never used foreign goods. The clothes I wear are all national goods and not enemy goods. Now is the critical time to resist Japan. I see that people in the interior are not well-informed and do not know what is national goods and what is enemy goods. They even hold enemy goods in their hands and say they are national goods. How can I guide them? I hope to get a reply from the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) This point is indeed an urgent problem to be solved in the anti-Japanese boycott. It is heard that anti-Japanese groups have made contrasting samples of national and Japanese goods and are planning to set up Japanese goods display places and compile comparison tables of Japanese and national goods with salt and print them. Unfortunately, these have not yet been published. I hope that those who are responsible for compiling and printing will proceed with the publication as soon as possible and announce it to the public.</p>
<p>When using the printed stamp for communication, please attach this stamp and a sufficient amount of postage.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the strict: I read a story in the news of your newspaper on November 3 entitled "The Return of the Toyo Dealer." I was horrified to find that my company, in view of the violent aggression of the tyrannical Japanese on our country's territory, was furious and had already withdrawn the Toyo dealer Zhu Wende to return to the country to show our firm determination. All the goods in stock have also been sealed by the industry association and are not for sale. Moreover, my company has never ordered goods, so how can there be a remittance? The contents of your newspaper are completely fictitious. I hope you will investigate and give us a correction in the letter column to protect our reputation and clarify the facts. We are most grateful. Sincerely, Da Shenxiang, November 3, to the editor-in-chief of the Shenbao.</p>
