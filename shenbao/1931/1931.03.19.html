<p>近論德國會通過關稅休戰公約事。曾認爲歐洲經濟合作之一有希望消息。但今據日内瓦訊。關稅休戰會議。已突告决裂。其原因以德國雖已表示願批准該約。惟須待英法批准而後實行。英法則俱要求加以修改遂致陷入僵局並已由批準該公約之十二國代表簽發一議定書聲明前此之批準槪作無效關稅會議之前功可謂毁於一旦。故主席荷代表於今日閉幕辭中。深痛歐洲經濟上之和平運動。因各方利益之不同。獲此最可悲惋之結果。且可認爲圖謀政治合作前途最不祥之朕兆。蓋亦慨乎其言之矣。吾嘗謂歐洲經濟合作。本較軍事合作爲難。經濟問題關係各國之利害。較軍事尤爲深切而複雜。即關稅一端。已有種種不相容之點。况乎關稅而外之困難問題尙多。故以今日而言經濟合作。誠非一蹴所能幾也。惟歐洲聯邦之運動。今正在猛烈進行之中。經此關稅稅議之失敗。當然受一重大打撃。雖云仍可希望於將來較佳之環境中。重開談判。然軼此機會。尋覓甚難。能不爲歐局前途惜乎。國内要電二</p>

<p>本年金價突然高涨所有舶來烟件及原料成本增高倍蓰影響烟業甚鉅烟商於是不得不提高價格以彌虧蝕然烟價提高納稅亦高烟件銷塲陡見呆滯形勢所趨劣烟日多高價捲烟逼入低稅等級烟商營業旣大受困難國家稅收亦漸見减落迭據各商函電院部以寛等减稅爲請本部環察商情兼顧稅收爰將原定七等制度改爲三級制俾限價稍寛烟商有自由伸縮之餘地自新制於十九年十月一日起施行後烟件銷塲立形活動稅收亦隨而激增然激增之主要原因固爲頒行新制而徵收區域之擴展及和平之重現亦與有力焉又新制實行後烟商售價高而納稅低之取巧行爲已可取締烟業競爭亦較前活動稅收商情於以兩臻便利</p>
<p>二十年一月一日實行進口新稅則後捲烟稅率已一律定爲從價百分之四十三級制以其成績良好故仍之</p>
<p>稅制之改善國民政府奠都南京時國内苛捐雜稅未除局所林立章制紛亂固無所謂制度也就上海一隅而論在民十七年間計有中央與地方稅征收機關百三十餘所財部以職責所在乃擬訂歸併各稅方針以求去繁就簡結果已有顯著之進步現除關務鹽務二署外所餘國稅征收機關祗統稅署烟酒印花稅處及漁礦二稅之征收局所而已裁厘後舉辦之棉紗火柴水泥等新稅悉歸統稅署辦理以節糜費一俟稅制整理完善則全部國稅將分轄於關務鹽務及内地稅三署旣可撙節經費即在稅務行政上亦可事半而功倍</p>
<p>裁厘之實行實爲政府决心與民更始之表現國人之苦於苛細之厘稅已數十載迭以稅收彌補無着曁有利害關係者從中梗阻故遲廻未撤比年戰事頻仍國庫虚匱政府更無貫澈其裁厘主張之時機十九年一月政府通令十月十日爲實行裁厘之期嗣因軍事未終不得已遷延至二十年元旦始克實現截至今日除邊疆諸省區外各處悉已遵令施行雖間有一二地方尙希託辭巧避惟裁厘乃中央與國民之意旨不容玩忽且一般商民方慶秕政之削除對於地方之違令征厘必難恝默也</p>
<p>裁厘後局卡人員失業者計二十萬人江浙二省厘局約佔六萬餘人國家稅收損失約計八千餘萬元而厘金侵漁睃削弊端至鉅國民因裁厘而節省之糜費當在一萬萬六千萬元以上一部分之厘稅收入向爲地方裁留撥用但國庫之純凈損失已屬可觀加之每年補助各省裁厘之損失約二千萬元爲數尤鉅其一切類似厘金之國稅如鐵路貨捐郵包稅落地稅通過稅復進口稅常關稅（五内常關土貨稅不包括在内）等俱在撤消之列此項稅收之損失亦不下二千萬元政府際此國庫枯竭乃毅然不顧此鉅大之損失力謀貫澈裁厘之政策誠以軍事告終百政待舉非裁厘無以言經濟建設也</p>
<p>政府爲謀地方稅制有健全之發展起見乃有地方營業稅之擬訂監督之權仍屬中央惟各省於中央頒訂之原則範圍内得酌量地方特殊情形厘訂單行征收條例俾利施行同時政府爲彌補國庫計復依照捲烟統稅前例舉辦棉紗火柴水泥等統稅歸併於統稅署辦理於本年二月一日開始徵收此類物產之產區限於數處征收較易著效</p>
<p>財部今後將繼續致力於稅制之改善對於稅務行政尤當力圖刷新務求確定徵收手續减輕經費增高稅收使國家稅制日臻平允稅政日益修明國民之負擔庶無畸輕畸重之弊焉（未完）</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>▲金錢是世界上最重要的東西。個人的幸福。或國家的道德。均以金錢爲基礎。</p>
<p>▲時間之於女性。關係至大。二十歲的女子只要在一個男子的眼光之下這麽一閃。即能加以征服。然而再隔十年。則非用某種的技巧。决不能從内心吸動任何的男人。</p>
<p>▲你不能以一個男子與他的妻子接吻的熱度而斷定其愛情。然而當他於可能範圍之内而不肯與别的女性接吻時。他的愛情的程度就可窺見其一斑。</p>
<p>▲二十歲的女子有天眞之美。四十歲的女子假使没有天賦的異質。伊的美完全是人爲的了。</p>
<p>▲假使一個男子能很精細地選擇他的女友。像選擇一根雪茄一樣。那末社會一班專辦離婚案件的律師。就可以個個餓死。</p>
<p>▲全國的上等書店。假使能實事求是的大廉價三年。那末一般民衆的知識。就可以增進不少。</p>
<p>▲一個有錢的人而無一定的信仰或無一定的職業。實較一個貧苦女子之没有貞節還要危險。</p>
<p>▲幸福和美麗都是人生的副產品。</p>

<p>— 慶霖</p>
<p>中國之藝術。在數千百年前。即發見矌古絶今之奇技。所惜均抱秘密主義。不肯公開。傳之外姓。爲尤不可能之事。若子孫不肖。承替無人。其道遂亡。而外國人士。反輾轉因襲。改頭換面。大事發明。此則誠堪痛惜者也。如天津西城有業塑揑泥人者。曰張明山。惟其名不彰。人但知其姓。故稱之曰泥人張而已。其技今已不傳。子孫雖仍業此。已不足觀。余曾記其塑揑法。及所塑物。詳載某報。信可爲中國藝術界張目。相傳彼尙有軼事一則。亟錄之。未始非藝術界名人之一段史料也。</p>
<p>李鴻章督直聞其名。召往署中。擬令揑一像張與對坐。漫應之。端詳李面少頃。旋索價二千金。李嫌其昂。却之。張亦不語。鞠躬退去。明日盛傳中堂之泥像。已陳列張所設肆中。眉目飛動。栩栩欲活。標價待沽。觀者如堵。蓋張謁李。藏泥袖中。與李晤談時。早將面目神情。在袖中揑就。歸再凝思其狀。加以修飾。另爲裝塑身段。部署衣冠。固無一處不酷肖。其技之神妙。有如是者。李聞而心惡之。顧亦莫如之何。亟令人持二千金。入市購　置之案頭。每顧化身。輙驚奇服膺。會有長蘆鹽商綱總李某。亦欲張爲塑像。張素狂傲。因曰。此李非彼李。鹹錢嗇吝。人所素知。今日之事。我爲政。果塑尊容。非十倍價於李中堂。不得諧也。否則。自有瞻仰顏色者。購歸賞鑒。李聞其言。不恭。拂袖起云。明日。張果以施諸彼李者。而施諸此李矣。詎李某器小。怒訟之。且其人富而驕。寗願玉碎。夜　金走有司。張遂敗訴。忿死獄中云。</p>

<p>▲醬汁肉　取鮮肉切方塊。同肉骨。加老汁湯醬油。久　内紅燒。熟後取出。其味腴美異常。</p>
<p>▲　小魚　小魚長寸許。多肉而無骨。俗名肉滯魚。用糖醋好醬油。清晨浸透。午後入油錢内。一　即起。外撒甘草茴香末少許。香而且鮮。</p>
<p>▲糟螺螄　螺螄軋去其尾。入鑊中燒之。加老糟湯。生猪油一塊。火功旣到。味甚鮮美。</p>
<p>▲新蠶豆　蠶豆剥去其殻。和竹笋釘。入鑊後。加豆油醬油白糖燒二三分鐘即止。鮮嫩可口。</p>
<p>▲銀魚燒青竄魚　銀魚和青竄魚。用豆油醬油少許。入鑊内同燒。别有風味。</p>

<p>生活程度日高。以今日之物價。與數十年前相較。誠不可以道里計。雖然。從前物價固廉矣。而不知廉之中有尤廉者。迄今追述之。猶令人有餘慕焉。</p>
<p>▲十文錢可吃四粉四麫蘇州船菜。遠近馳名。其所製點心。爲味尤美。大槪每席用粉製者四色。麫製者四色。其名曰四粉四麫。乃昔有一友人。戲言吾以十文錢可買四粉四麫或問之。則曰以一文錢買白糖饀之大湯水圓一個。以一文錢買酒釀擔上之小粽子兩隻。以一文錢買炒米團二個。以二文錢買小斗糕一甑。此四粉也。以一文錢買小鹹一個。（最小之圓餅。内有葱脂油。外有芝蔴。其味甚佳。）以一文錢買絞栗棒二條。以一文錢買鍋塊一塊。（最粗之麫餅。略糝以鹽。爲貧民窟中唯一充飢品。每整個售錢四文。切爲四塊零售。）以上四色。燒餅攤上均有之。）當時頗賞其言之雋妙。今則惟絞栗捧尙偶見之。然每條亦須售銅元二枚餘則皆歸天然淘汰矣。</p>
<p>▲各物加價二物獨否民國初元。有人言方今各物皆已加價。惟有二物獨否。或問之。則曰乞丐手中所售之竹挖耳。從前售錢一文。今亦售錢一文。臘尾年頭在茶館中兜售之黃曆。從前最賤者售錢三四十文。今亦售銅元三四枚。豈非皆未加價乎。今則廢曆曆本。固已絶跡。即竹挖耳一枝。亦需售銅元二枚矣。</p>
<p>其餘若雞蛋一枚。從前售錢四五文。陸稿薦之醬汁肉。每塊售錢七文。爆魚熌肉大　。每碗售錢二十四文。皆價廉物美。今則皆已加至十倍左右。中人之家以下。安得不歎度日維艱哉。</p>

<p>— 蕙子</p>
<p>軍政部此次召集之全國陸軍醫院院長會議。乃軍醫會議之初步。將由此會預備各項提案以俟舉行全國軍醫會議時再鄭重解决。如傷病患者之待遇。軍醫編制之改擬。及醫撩器械之補充。負傷患病之統計等重大問題。均非有通盤之籌劃澈底之解决不可。</p>
<p>該會會期四日。議决要案不下五十件。惟第一步需籌一　經費。譬如建築院舍也。添購Ｘ光也。改良給飬也。俱非錢不行。而現値國庫窘迫之際。一切經費皆從減縮。安有餘欵以供改良發展之需乎。非比甫經成立之軍醫監部。對於財政予取予求。據聞該部所計劃之模範軍醫院。僅開辦費爲一百三十萬元。以較之軍政部所設之軍醫院。每個之開辦費爲三千元。誠小巫之見大巫。相去不可以道里計也。</p>
<p>首都有中央醫院者即前之模範中央醫院所改名。規模宏闊。爲本京公私各醫院之冠。看護長薪給在二百元以上。至各科醫官。祇軍政部總次長尙堪比擬。蓋次長爲中將階級。月薪祇五百元。而該院醫官之月薪至多爲六百元。至其一年來之成績。不過爾爾。當去歲傷兵擁擠之時。軍政部各醫院最多曾收容傷兵逹五萬人。逐月經費總計每月不過三十萬元。而中央醫院僅收容傷兵三百人。乃亦開支至每月十五萬。</p>
<p>此次軍醫會議到會者均各地陸軍醫院院長。共十八人。以省籍言。則浙江爲最多。以出身言。則軍醫學校畢業者佔三之一。惟有一共同點則均係德日派醫學家。主席蔣秋然司長。先畢業於日本士官。繼轉入日本千葉醫專。故不愧爲軍而兼醫之老名家。軍醫界三傑。即指蔣氏與郝子華劉季雄而言。該會秘書吳羽白楊不平。均有聲於軍醫界。此次會議出席者。均係軍醫界領袖人物。有十八學士。四俊八賢之目。十八學士即謂到會之十八位院長。吳楊二君俱四俊八賢中人物。惜予門外漢。不及詢個中人而二詳記之也。</p>

<p>— 李胥梵</p>
<p>鴉片爲害。盡人知之。凡屬動物。似易染癖。而臟肺有若何之。凡屬動物。似易人能道其詳。當馬聯甲督皖時。烟禁大弛。皖北如　　毫渦一帶居民幾非烟不活。無烟非家。甚至有女性乞丐。不丐飯而惟烟滓是丐者。時余適正陽。曾見因猴染烟癖。而宣告死刑之一事。殊堪發噱。爰錄實本談。</p>
<p>正陽關屬壽縣。皖北大鎭也。鎭有石姓者。家道小康。烟癖甚厲蓄一雄猴殊乖巧。輒於一楊橫陳之際。猴必與俱。間入烟寮。亦隨往。一日。石因事赴鄉。留猴於家。越宿未歸。翌午猴不耐。私奔烟寮。投以銀幣一枚。置於榻端。狂啼不已。烟主知爲石猴。覩狀心異。試噴以烟。欣然領受。連噴數次。樂不可支。潛歸。而家人未知也。如是者三日。癮君子引爲同志矣。詎於第三日。正在噴受烟氣。主人突至。猴一見遽驚。掉首不顧而竄。烟肆具實告。石大憤。歸檢枕畔。已少銀幣三枚。知爲所竊。猴怯肇禍。潛伏隠處竟日。石以其染成烟癖。癮來竟效梁上君子。其靈性固可愛。而情迹殊不可恕。日久恐釀意外。次日懹利刃一柄。出其不意。繁猴刺之死。復取臟肺繋於樹。俟覘變異。移時。漸見肺面蠕動。有若　鑽蟻聚。究係何由。眇難分辨。石含烟數噴。始徐徐不復作此狀態矣。一時鄰右集覩。傳爲趣聞。余寓與石家。近在咫尺。當時目撃之後。擬携歸研其究竟旋因該鎭僻處山鄉惜無科學醫院。棄未留眝。蓋猴子爲靈性之動物。其血脈骨絡。與人類無甚大異。旣可與人同染嗜好。而鴉片之毒中於人。殊不知有無同樣之變異。余不禁爲之疑慮耳。</p>

<p>第十七回　駐顏有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黃金市駿骨</p>
<p>第一知道的便是那位蓋玉堂。他和潘家奶奶的丈夫是同業。所謂。近水樓台先得月。他跑到潘家。大哭一塲。表現他是個北方豪爽之性。潘家奶奶道。現在人也死了。哭了難道會活轉來嗎。不過你們要明白老六爲什麽上海存身不住。要路遠迢迢的到北京去。你們也該明白。蓋玉堂道。這原是我們的不是。但老六似野馬一般。一個人也縛不住伊。你是知道的。隨後馬車老板阿森也知道這個消息了。潘家奶奶也一樣的責備了他一塲。伊說雖然一個人的壽命是注定了的。然而老六倘然死在上海。到底有許多親人在伊身邊。不傷此刻那樣的客死異鄉。阿森也俯首無詞。及至花老六的棺柩。從招商局輪船運到上海時。兩個都得了信。蓋玉堂說。活的時候我對不起伊。死後應該歸我。阿森道。不。老六的棺柩應該歸我。我在江灣看一塊地皮。我就可以做一個　葬伊。蓋玉堂道。我將來也不回到北方去。我可以買一塊地。好好兒的葬伊。現在伊的靈柩。在會館裏寄一寄。這個寄柩的錢。也歸我出。阿森道。我先認得伊。自然由我來承領他的棺柩。兩人爭之不已。潘家奶奶道。你們現在像煞有介事的爭些什麽。當初你們都想佔伊的便宜。伊到北京去的時候。你們也不出來帮帮伊的忙。而且没有你們兩人。伊也何至於要到北京去。現在人家給伊買棺成殮。運到南方來。你們倒要做現成的好人。人家還說你們對於花老六是有良心的。你們自已去摸摸良心吧。此刻我給死者做主。一個也不要你管。我們本是常熟人。我和伊是要好的姊妹。我把伊的棺柩運回常熟去。我有一塊空地在那裏。我會　伊葬了。不用你們二位操心。你們現在一時高興。只怕將來丢在會館裏。連　也不去上。我在常熟。自已去上　時。也得在伊　前。燒一陌錢。後來潘家奶奶。果然把花元春棺柩運到常熟安葬。這是歸結了花元春的事。綠漪那裏。也不能知道這般詳細。後來有人告訴了左詩晨。由左詩晨傳述出來的。娼們中的女子。本來也都是好女兒。爲惡濁的社會。引誘到了墮落之淵去。因此斷送了伊的青春的。也不知凡幾。正是</p>

<h3 id="c186">牙痛 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 思永</p>
<p>從來未曾患過牙痛的我一旦遭逢事實不防這區區小病也竟會使人苦楚至此</p>
<p>前幾天這粒牙原已隠隠作痛了的但吃飯時並無感到何種不便誰知前天夜裏十句鐘左右痛就漸漸加重起來到後一陣緊似一陣再不能任我寫字了放下筆登　便睡可是如何睡得着朝裏·朝外·仰臥·俯臥·凡是所有的睡底姿勢全都試遍了郤終不能入睡愈不能入睡愈痛得厲害愈痛得厲害愈不能入睡輾轉反側之間遠處雞已啼了推衾起坐窗紗已透曙光嚴冬侵晨底寒氣威脅我重新溜下被窩開着眼看天色徐徐明亮</p>
<p>到後人眞倦極了才朦朧睡去但不久就被痛醒了痛醒以後身子便換過一個方向後來又睡去了但又被痛醒了這亟欲安息的整個軀體彷佛已爲一粒小小的痛牙所主宰着一個　走入夢境一個就跟到就從夢境裏連拖帶牽地把牠拉出一個逃生一個追住一次一次不知是多少次了</p>
<p>鐘打十下痛勢仍未稍衰打十一下也仍然如故被口蓋到左腮時可聽到突·突·突·痛底音饗人懶懶地不想起身死一樣地躺着</p>
<p>思永醒了嗎給我看</p>
<p>母親坐到我的床沿伸進頭來瞧我面部</p>
<p>隨後母親調製了一本鹽滷說這是治牙痛的最靈的藥物她取了一匙倒入我的嘴裏敎我把頭偏仰使鹽滷完全傾注到那痛底部份含得很熱了吐去再換這麽含了四遍</p>
<p>可是含着的時候並不减少些疼痛含了四遍之後還是毫不見效</p>
<p>起來吧吃飯了我敎你阿妹煮粥給你吃</p>
<p>躺着也痛起來也痛聽到母親底話也就勉强起身了</p>
<p>粥非常燙拿筷子在碗裏攪着一面用嘴吹着氣嘴吹着氣那粒牙更痛了而這吹出來的氣也再不像平日的强而有力低微得很幾乎吹不起薄粥稍稍波動一下面前放着熱氣騰騰的一碗薄粥和幾碟菜兒　着眉祇望望牠們記得幼年時我父親底朋友醫士胡先生講給我的一個故事說是有一位敎書先生東家待他非常刻薄菜固不好飯也没有天天祇請他吃粥粥又薄得要命過一會兒肚就餓了有一次敎書先生以筷撃節對粥吟道</p>
<p>粒米煑成一大甌</p>
<p>鼻風吹來浪悠悠</p>
<p>好像一面青銅鏡</p>
<p>鬚眉畢現在裏頭</p>
<p>句雖未工而這位敎書先生底描寫薄粥却眞是入木三分</p>
<p>粥已冷到温温的了動筷就划質薄性柔還算順利可是喫菜便討厭了夾一筷菜放進嘴裏縱使用右邊的齒牙略一咀嚼也要影響及那左邊痛的一粒痛便激增起來所以弄得菜也囫圇吞棗地　下就算</p>
<p>痛是依舊如此之痛且漸覺有些更厲害的趨勢了這麽痛下去還了得嗎於是我就從書架底角落裏取下一大堆塵埃盈寸的騐方新編和家庭常識來翻看這些書裏有着不少的治牙痛丹方丹方中底藥物不是不能臨時搜辦的便是製配的手續極爲繁複個個丹方都自稱百發百中靈騐無匹我恐怕上當一本翻過一本統割愛了最後在家庭常識第七集裏發見了一個不知是誰用筆密圈着的過街笑說是……若以頂好冰片和以銀硃少許擦之奇效且不論風火虫牙皆治余……經時而愈洵足稱爲過街笑也長長的兩行密圈似乎潛藏着什麽魔力不由得使我對於這過街笑生了若干的信仰馬上把頂好冰片和銀硃買來用指頭　了就擦一回·兩回……七回·八回……乃至十數回弄到口腔内满充了冰片强烈的難忍的氣味口涎與銀硃和成血液一樣的東西而那粒痛牙更痛得厲害了更厲害更擦相信這過街笑是能把牠治愈的但更擦終於痛得更厲害了坐也不是立也不是這間走到那間那間走到這間可憐到猶如一隻受傷的綿羊</p>
<p>晚飯時祖母和母親勸我喫些飯她們說飯比粥於身體有力得多但如何喫得下呢祖母說</p>
<p>像我是没有一粒牙齒了不論喫菜喫飯一槪吞下去就算的</p>
<p>祖母今年正七十高壽了但我還不知道她的喫飯是如此的飯底滋味菜底滋味以及一切食物底滋味不細細咀嚼能好好領略的嗎由此可知年老人一切生之樂趣已如日落後暮天上退了色的晚霞般的黯淡了而我們年青人是有福的雖然我如今喫飯時和祖母處在同一的地位甚至比祖母還壞些</p>
<p>飯後賢城君來訪他聽說我牙痛就特爲我重新回家去拿了一點藥水和幾片阿司匹靈來我感謝我的許多朋友他們全如此好心地待我</p>
<p>藥水搽了數次阿司匹靈也服了兩片眞的好多了鐘打九下我即就睡極度的倦怠引我立刻入夢但睡了一會又痛醒了原來所謂牙痛藥不論那種不過全是些麻醉劑而已母親所推重的鹽滷過街笑底冰片和銀硃·賢城君送來的含有哥羅方香氣的藥水因麻醉力的强弱就分功效的高下於我如此强度的牙痛以致鹽滷與冰片是一無所濟了</p>

<p>Revised Export Tariff Principles Approved; Issuance of Short-Term Treasury Bills for 80 Million Yuan. Nanjing, 18th (Special Dispatch): The 266th Central Political Conference was attended by Chiang Kai-shek, Tai Chuan-hsien, Yu Yu-jen, Song Ziwen, Shao Yuan-chong, Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingheng, Li Yuying, Shao Lizi, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, and others. Matters discussed by Chairman Chiang included: (1) Minister of Finance Song proposed a draft revision of the current export tariff regulations for public decision. A resolution was passed in principle, and the draft was sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. (2) Minister of Finance Song requested the issuance of 80 million yuan in short-term customs treasury bills for the 20th year of the Republic of China to cover the shortfall of the 19th year. A resolution was passed in principle, and the implementation method was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. (3) Chiang Kai-shek proposed the nomination of Liu Shangqing as a member of the Local Autonomy Group. The resolution was passed. Subsequently, there was a brief discussion on correcting the Hunan Provincial Government's promulgation of the Hunan Post-War Donation Collection Regulations and Implementation Details. The meeting adjourned at approximately 10:00 AM. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ministry of Finance's Proposal to Revise Export Tariffs to the Central Political Conference <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Minister of Finance Song drafted a proposal to revise the current export tariff rates, which was submitted to the Central Political Conference on the 18th. The proposal stated that the current export tariff rates originated in the Wuwu year of the Xianfeng era and have not been revised for over 70 years. During this time, commercial conditions and commodity prices have changed greatly. To adhere rigidly to the old rules would be out of step with the times. Regarding the tariff rates for various goods, the initial rate was uniformly 5% of the value. In recent years, a surcharge of 2.5% has been added, totaling 7.5% of the value. For goods subject to ad valorem tariffs, the dutiable value is estimated according to the market price at any time, and the full difference of 7.5% is truly consistent with the name. However, for goods subject to specific tariffs, the market price from decades ago is used as the basis, which in reality is only about 30% of the value. The proposed revision stipulates that the ad valorem rate will remain at 7.5% of the value, while the specific rates will be revised in consideration of recent commodity prices. However, since the dutiable value has already increased, if the tariff rate is the same as that for ad valorem goods, at 7.5% of the value, the change may be too drastic and affect commerce. Therefore, the specific tariff rate is proposed to be 5% of the value. For certain manufactured goods that are not suitable for tax increases, the original rate of 3% of the value, including surcharges, will be maintained. For new tax rates approved by the government and reduced, the current situation will be maintained. Adjustments should be made to situations where commercial conditions are examined and require adjustment. There are three main points of the draft: (A) Regarding the tax system, creating new taxes is not easy. Export taxes are existing taxes that can be slightly increased. No new agencies will be established, no personnel will be added, and expenses will be kept as usual, making collection convenient. (B) Regarding commerce, the revised draft includes items that will not be increased. The increased portion is only from the original 3% of the value to 5% of the value. In other words, the tax rate is only increased by 2%. (C) Regarding finance, the financial shortfall for the coming year is at least 14.3 million yuan, and the 50-li Changguan checkpoints are currently planned to be abolished, eliminating over 6 million yuan in regular taxes. Both need to be planned for and compensated. In summary, the current government is determined to innovate and abolish all bad tax systems in order. The sacrifice in finance is very large. Planning for compensation is a major issue, but the current state of trade should not be subjected to drastic changes. Commercial difficulties should be given appropriate consideration. As for the provisions of the draft, efforts will be made to improve the implementation of the current tariff regulations and facilitate the execution of customs procedures.

<h3 id="e25">Breakdown of the Tariff Truce Conference <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Recent comments on the German parliament passing the Tariff Truce Convention. It was once considered a hopeful sign of European economic cooperation. But according to a report from Geneva today, the Tariff Truce Conference has suddenly broken down. The reason is that although Germany has expressed its willingness to ratify the convention, it must wait for Britain and France to ratify it before it can be implemented. Britain and France have both requested modifications, resulting in a deadlock. The representatives of the twelve countries that had ratified the convention have signed a protocol stating that the previous ratifications are all invalid. The previous achievements of the Tariff Conference can be said to have been destroyed in one fell swoop. Therefore, the chairman and Dutch representative said in his closing speech today that he deeply regretted that the movement for economic peace in Europe had suffered this most regrettable result due to differences in interests. It can also be regarded as a most ominous sign for the future of political cooperation. It is also a sigh that he said it. I once said that European economic cooperation is more difficult than military cooperation. Economic issues are more profound and complex than military issues because they relate to the interests of various countries. The tariff alone has various incompatible points. Moreover, there are many difficult problems besides tariffs. Therefore, economic cooperation today is not something that can be achieved overnight. However, the movement for a European federation is now in full swing. The failure of this tariff agreement will naturally suffer a major blow. Although it is said that there is still hope for reopening negotiations in a better environment in the future, it is very difficult to find this opportunity again. How can one not regret the future of the European situation? National Important Telegrams 2</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Tariff Truce Conference Ends Like This <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Declaration of Convention Ratification Invalid 　　 European Alliance's Future Forewarns Omen 　　 Geneva Dispatch, National 18th The European Tariff Truce Conference officially closed today. Representatives of the 12 countries that had ratified the convention made at last year's conference signed an agreed statement that, as it was currently impossible to make the convention effective on April 1, all previous ratifications should be considered invalid. The chairman, Dutch representative Colijn, lamented in his closing speech that the European economic peace movement had achieved this most regrettable result due to differing interests, and it could be considered the most ominous omen for the future of political cooperation.</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch, National 17th The European Tariff Truce Conference has finally broken down. It was announced tonight that a memorandum is being drafted in preparation for signing by the representatives tomorrow. The memorandum states that the participating countries were unable to agree on an implementation date for the convention made at last year's conference, and they hope to reopen negotiations in a better environment in the future. According to reports, although Germany stated yesterday that it was willing to ratify the convention, it would only do so after the United Kingdom and Germany had ratified it. However, both the United Kingdom and Germany requested modifications, which led to a deadlock.</p>
<h3 id="e59">British Air Force Ranks Fifth in the World, Budget Approved by the House of Commons <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>London Dispatch, Reuters 17th Undersecretary of Aviation Montague presented the aviation budget to the House of Commons today, stating that a trial plan had been drafted to operate a weekly aviation service between Calcutta and Australia to connect with the British-Indian aviation industry. In the next fiscal year, the air defense force will be increased by three squadrons, for a total of forty-two squadrons, which is ten squadrons less than originally proposed. The reason for the slower progress is that there is no possibility of a major war at present. The United Kingdom ranks fifth among the world's air force powers. British air force spending has decreased slightly compared to the past, while French air force spending has increased to 130 to 150 percent, and the United States has also increased to 150 to 160 percent. Former Secretary of Aviation Hoare asked the government to strongly advocate for a large reduction in air force spending at the next disarmament conference and to focus on the Anglo-French-Italian agreement to reduce air force spending and stop increasing future air force equipment. Montague replied that he hoped that the Geneva Disarmament Conference could satisfactorily resolve the issue of air force equipment. The United Kingdom wants to start competing for air supremacy to control other countries, which is absolutely impossible. The House of Commons then approved the air force budget of £18.1 million, an increase of £250,000 compared to last year.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Meeting of British Experts Decided to Be Held Today <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Japan Changes Its Hesitant Attitude 　　 Instructions to the Ambassador to France to Attend 　　 Tokyo Dispatch, Reuters 18th It is reported that Japan has indicated that it cannot participate in the meeting of experts to be held in London tomorrow, but it is now considering whether to send an observer to attend and give recommendations. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom met with the British Foreign Secretary to request a postponement of the meeting in order to continue considering relevant points, but the British Foreign Secretary refused his request. The reason for Japan's hesitation towards the Franco-Italian agreement is that the tonnage of capital ships obtained by France and Italy exceeds the number allowed by the Washington Treaty. If this number is formally passed, the amended treaty must be approved. It is not easy to obtain the consent of the National Assembly today, so the Japanese government is not very keen on amending the original treaty. Another telegram states that the Japanese government has decided to instruct Kuriyama, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Paris, to go to London to participate in the naval experts meeting to be held tomorrow. Kuriyama governs international law and jurisprudence, and the government gives him the power to make recommendations. The government made this decision because the United States has agreed to send a representative to attend.</p>

<p>Answers Questions from the Opposition Party 　　 Health Concerns Remain 　　 Speaker's Late Arrival Causes Uproar in the Chamber 　　 Tokyo Dispatch, Japan United 18th Prime Minister Hamaguchi's health remains poor. After returning to his residence from the parliament on the 17th, he developed abdominal pain. As a result of treatment, he improved slightly by late at night. According to an agreement between the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, the Prime Minister reluctantly attended today's plenary session of the House of Representatives to answer questions from the opposition party.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch, Dentsu 11th At today's meeting of the House of Representatives, the Seiyukai party had already selected Hatoyama, Uchida, Sunada and others as the first-line generals to question Prime Minister Hamaguchi, and the Minseito party was also prepared to confront them. Both the ruling and opposition parties were extremely tense and waiting for Prime Minister Hamaguchi to enter the House. Because the Prime Minister's condition was not good, the scheduled time for him to enter the House from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM did not occur, and there was an uproar in the chamber. Speaker Fujisawa did not arrive until 2:30 PM, and the opposition party clamored and roared, "What is the Speaker doing arriving at this moment?" The Speaker replied that he was late due to circumstances, gave a brief reply, and announced the meeting open at 2:35 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch, Dentsu 18th At the plenary session of the House of Representatives held this afternoon, a proposal was made for the general budget supplementary bill for the fiscal year of Showa 6 and five other items. Chairman Takeuchi was about to take the stage to report when Prime Minister Hamaguchi, supported by Chief Secretary Suzuki, entered the House. The Minseito party applauded loudly to express their welcome, while the opposition party shouted loudly, "Why are you late?" and the chamber was in turmoil. After Chairman Takeuchi finished his report, Yamazaki stated his revised opinions. Hatoyama questioned Prime Minister Hamaguchi: First, given the facts at this moment after the Prime Minister's entry into the House, how does the Prime Minister feel about the responsibility of advisors to make the country's affairs deteriorate? Second, how does the Prime Minister feel about the long-term appointment of an acting Prime Minister disrupting the great principles of the constitution? Prime Minister Hamaguchi replied: First, I have no such feelings. Second, truly, truly, but the Prime Minister is also a person who is occasionally absent from the parliament, which is unavoidable. Moreover, acting Prime Minister Shidehara is quite capable of taking responsibility, and there is nothing inappropriate in setting up a temporary acting Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Four Places Exploded Simultaneously, Fortunately Few People Were Injured 　　 Authorities Suspect Demonstration by Opposition Party 　　 Belgrade Dispatch, Reuters 18th Yesterday, bombs exploded in the capital of Yugoslavia. The Ministry of the Army, the Ministry of Finance, the Military Academy, and the Officers' Dormitory were all severely damaged. Yesterday, it was reported that one officer was killed in the bombing. It is now known that he was injured but not dead. The officer saw a bomb outside the dormitory and was about to move it when the bomb exploded, causing him to be injured. One soldier and one civilian were also injured. Fortunately, it was early and there were not many pedestrians, otherwise the number of injured would have been higher. All the bombs apparently exploded simultaneously. Some were hidden in trash cans, some were wrapped in cloth bags, and some were placed next to the guard post of the Military Academy. Several bombs were found near the railway station at night. The fact that many bombs were placed in various official places led to the conclusion that this was part of a large-scale demonstration by those who oppose the existing political system.</p>
<p>Belgrade Dispatch, National Society 17th The authorities remained silent about this matter but have quickly investigated it to prevent the recurrence of similar acts of violence. Politically, it is believed that this was an act by the Communist Party, but many people believe that this was done by people in the Macedonian or Croatian army. Observers do not believe the official claim that these two groups have ceased their opposition to the Serbian dictatorship.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Three Important Telegrams Regarding the National Election <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The General Office of the National Assembly Representative Election has issued three telegrams to the Chief Supervisors of Elections in various provinces and cities. The telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) Chief Supervisors of Elections in the Civil Affairs Departments of various provinces, Supervisors of Elections in various municipal governments, note that if an elector in a local organization is unable to write by himself, he may be assisted by a person designated by the Election Supervisor, but the signature or seal of the Election Monitor shall be required to avoid impropriety. Please comply accordingly. (2) Chief Supervisors of Elections in various provinces and cities, Supervisors of Elections, note that according to a letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the National Assembly Representative Election Law stipulates that only legally established organizations may participate in the election. Recently, it has been found that there are many people's organizations in various places that have been established with the guidance and permission of the Party Headquarters, but are still in the process of applying to the government for registration. If government approval is required, the delay may cause the election to be missed. In order to give them the opportunity to participate in the election, it has been decided that organizations that have been guided and permitted by the Party Headquarters and are still in the process of applying for registration may be regarded as legal organizations. Please comply accordingly. (3) Chief Supervisors of Election Offices in Civil Affairs Departments of various provinces, note that the quota of 15 representatives stipulated in Article 15 of the Chinese Kuomintang Procedures for the Election of Representatives to the National Assembly refers to the total number of representatives to be elected by the special Party Headquarters of the national armed forces. The allocation to the provinces is drawn from the quota of the Party Headquarters of the respective provinces specified in that article, but the right to vote is not limited to the special Party Headquarters of the armed forces stationed in the respective provinces. All special Party Headquarters of the national armed forces have the right to vote. As for the election procedures, they are detailed in Articles 16 and 19, and the procedures will be notified separately in due course. In addition to submitting a telegram to the Central Government to inform the special Party Headquarters of the national armed forces, a special telegram is issued for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Important News on Suppressing Communists in the Southern Section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence After the communist bandits in Lijiazhai in the southern section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway were defeated, the Railway Bureau immediately sent workers to repair the tracks. On the 11th, the tracks at that location were completely repaired. On the 12th, the Peiping-Hankou Railway was reopened. Due to the suspension of traffic for more than ten days, there was a large backlog of passengers and cargo. Special express trains are running more than twice a day. Furthermore, the Railway Bureau has sent Wang Shaohui, Chief of the 3rd Engineering Section, and Huang Miao, Chief of the Qiaokou Section, with a large amount of materials to repair the bridges at Dongjia Bridge and the tracks at Zhujiawan. They arrived at the location on the 16th and are temporarily building a branch line at Dongjia Bridge to restore traffic first. It is expected that traffic will be restored in about three days.</p>
<p>The communist bandits who fled to Lijiazhai were quickly surrounded and suppressed by the 6th Division of Zhao Guantao, the 31st Division of Zhang Yinxiang, the 34th Division of Yue Weijun, the 44th Division of Xiao Zhichu, and the 25th New Division of Dai Minquan. The bandits were defeated and scattered to Qingshandian, Shuangqiaozhen, Pengjiawan, Xinye, Dangu Mountain, Caijiawan, and Xiaohexi. According to reports, the General Headquarters has dispatched garrison and pursuit troops to continue the encirclement and suppression according to the plan issued by the Central Government. In recent days, the communist bandits in Qingshandian, Shuangqiaozhen, Pengjiawan, Dangu Mountain, and Caijiawan have been defeated by the 31st Division of Zhang Yinxiang. The communist bandits in Xinye have been defeated by the 23rd Division of Li Yunjie. The communist bandits in Luoshan have been defeated by the 25th New Division of Dai Minquan. The communist bandits in Xiaohexi have been defeated by the 44th Division of Xiao Zhichu. The remaining scattered bandits are being blocked by the garrison troops.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the safety of the entire line, the Wuhan General Headquarters has not only dispatched troops to suppress the communist bandits but has also sent Gu Maolin, the captain of the 4th Railway Artillery Battalion, to personally lead the battalion's Minsheng and Tongyi artillery trains to patrol the southern section to assist in the suppression of the bandits. For ease of command, the battalion has been temporarily assigned to the command of Zhao Guantao, Commander of the 6th Division. Gu, after receiving the order, led the two artillery trains north some days ago and patrolled along the line. In addition, airplanes are dispatched from time to time to scout and drop bombs on any communist bandit tracks they discover. Yesterday, the 1st Aviation Squadron dispatched two airplanes to scout and returned to Hankou that day. According to reports, the communist bandits in all locations have been defeated, but there are still a small number of remnant bandits in the Shuangqiaozhen area. (March 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Liu Pengyi Takes Office as Anhui Finance Director <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence The salt tax surcharge and rice inspection fee, which Anhui Province planned to use to compensate for the abolition of the likin tax, were both revoked by the Ministry of Finance, leading to the resignation of Finance Director Yuan Jiapu. The Central Government has appointed Liu Pengyi to succeed him and has issued the appointment several days ago. Liu did not come to Anhui immediately due to the loss of a relative. On the morning of the 15th, Provincial Chairman Chen Tiaoyuan returned to the province from Nanjing, and Liu accompanied him. The next day (16th), the provincial government held a memorial week for the Premier at 10:00 AM. After the memorial week, Liu was sworn in by Chen Tiaoyuan, who also gave a speech, saying that former Director Yuan resigned resolutely because his proposals were not understood by all parties. Now that Director Liu has come to take over, he hopes that he will continue to handle the unfinished affairs of Director Yuan and find ways to solve all the difficulties. The salt tax surcharge and rice inspection fee implemented in this province were based on the situation in various provinces and reported to the Central Government. The Central Government also knows that there was a salt tax surcharge in Anhui. The collection of the surcharge in northern Anhui this time was just to equalize the burden. Due to various reasons, the order to cancel it was issued. As for the rice inspection fee, all provinces have it. Hunan charges three yuan, Hubei charges one yuan and fifty cents, and Jiangxi charges two yuan, all of which are higher than Anhui's six cents. Wuhu charges two cents more to be used for the prosperity of Wuhu City. Those who do not know believe that this rice inspection fee was created by Anhui Province and express their opposition. This is the biggest reason for former Director Yuan's resignation. However, Anhui's financial difficulties are obvious facts. It is hoped that after Director Liu takes office, he will investigate the matters that Director Yuan should promote and reform, act according to our conscience, and do it conscientiously so that all administrative expenses can be implemented according to the budget. Then, Provincial Reorganization Committee member Ning Kun gave a speech. Then, Liu replied, saying that after taking office, he would make financial openness his first priority so that the public could understand. Then, he would find ways to balance revenue and expenditure so that construction and education would not be severely affected. He hoped that all sectors would give guidance so that finance could be improved. After taking office, Liu went to the Finance Office to inspect the affairs. (March 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Jiaoji Railway to Build Jinan-Linqing Branch Line <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Ge Guangting Enters Beijing to Discuss Jinan Correspondence Ge Guangting, Director of the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee, and Committee Member Peng Dongyuan arrived in Jinan yesterday morning from Qingdao and transferred to Beijing. When I asked about the purpose of this trip, Ge said that he had not been to Nanjing since he arrived at the Jiaoji Railway. This trip is to report to the Ministry of Railways on the situation of the Railway and to discuss the extension of the Jinan-Linqing branch line. This case has been passed by the Railway Committee and can be implemented after being approved by the Ministry of Railways. The Jinan-Linqing line is about 180 li long, and the cost of building each li is about 30,000 yuan, for a total of 6 million yuan. The 65-pound rails and old bridges replaced by the Railway's replacement of 100-pound rails and new bridges can be used to build the Jinan-Linqing branch line for 3 million yuan. The remaining 3 million yuan can be borrowed. Therefore, this line must be built for the following reasons: First, the Railway has a debt of 40 million Japanese yen, and the 15-year redemption period is approaching. If we do not seek to develop our business and increase our income, how can we achieve the goal of redemption? If we build the Jinan-Linqing branch line, we will only incur an additional debt of 3 million yuan, but the length of the line will be extended by one-fifth, and the income will naturally increase. The Railway is currently 400 kilometers long. The Ministry of Railways plans to extend it to Daokou, extending it by 300 kilometers. In the future, we can issue public bonds for 40 million Japanese yen at once for the 700-kilometer railway, which can be paid off and recover the rights and interests. Second, although the Railway currently feels a lack of freight cars, in addition to the 100 Belgian 40-ton freight cars that have already been delivered, we have also ordered 100 Japanese 40-ton freight cars from Gao Ya Company. In the future, we plan to purchase another 200 freight cars. The Railway will feel an excess of freight cars, so we must expand the branch lines to accommodate freight cars and increase income. Furthermore, although there are no statistics on the income of the branch line, according to a recent survey by the National Commercial Transport Conference, Linqing is a canal port with many export goods, mainly cotton. Due to inconvenient transportation, many goods are exported through Tianjin, which is very inconvenient. If the Jinan-Linqing branch line is built, the goods can come to Jinan and be exported through Qingdao, which is cheaper than Tianjin. If it is extended to Daokou and connected with the Longhai and Peiping-Hankou Railways, the goods from southern Hebei and Henan and Shaanxi can all be exported through Qingdao. The business of the Railway and the prosperity of Qingdao will have a surprising development. As far as the ports in central China are concerned, Tianjin and Haizhou are becoming increasingly silted up. Shanghai is better, but steamers of more than 10,000 tons still cannot enter freely. Only Qingdao has a wide port and deep water, and steamers of 20,000 tons can enter. If the Railway can gradually extend, Qingdao will become the first port in our country. The Railway originally planned to extend the Boshan-Laiwu branch line, but after detailed investigation, it was not as convenient as building the Jinan-Linqing branch line, so the plan was changed. After Ge finished speaking, he took the Jinpu Railway 201 train south to Beijing. (March 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Three Requests from the Harbin Shipping Merchants to Meet Mr. Mo for Petition <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Request to Reject the Russian Proposal to Exchange Waterways Harbin Communication On the 13th, the shipping industry in Harbin sent representatives Wang Litang, Wang Weiqing, Huang Ji, Wang Shize, Fu Zhongchen, Gao Wenxuan, Ma Ziyuan, and others, nine in total, to the office of the Director of the Eastern Railway, where they met with Mo Dehui and presented a petition from the Northeastern shipping merchants, outlining three requests: (1) The Russian side intends to request that the issue of Northeastern shipping rights be discussed at the Sino-Russian conference, with the condition of exchanging the stretch of waterway from Boli to Miaojie in the lower reaches of the Ussuri River for our country's inland waterway of the Songhua River. The cargo transportation volume in the Boli-Miaojie section is very low, differing greatly from the inland shipping of the Songhua River. It is requested that the Russian side's discussion of this matter be rejected at the conference to prevent Russian ships from entering our inland rivers, disrupting shipping administration, and infringing upon our sovereignty. (2) The Ussuri and Heilongjiang Rivers are international co-managed rivers. All rights on the river channels should be jointly managed and enjoyed. Soviet Russia should not monopolize them. It is requested that the requirement for joint management be raised at the conference and that a joint defense river co-management agreement be concluded with Russia for joint compliance. (3) During the Sino-Russian Incident in the 18th year, the five commercial vessels of the Northeastern Shipping Bureau—"Aihun," "Huagai," "Haicheng," "Yixing," and "Shenyang"—and the four vessels of private merchants—"Weitong," "Haichang," "Hongtai," and "Tongfeng"—were detained by Russia, with the value of the ships estimated at 4,455,366 yuan, plus an additional loss of 6 million yuan in passengers and cargo. It is requested that Russia be asked for compensation for the losses at the conference. Mr. Mo expressed his agreement to raise these matters at the conference. The representatives then elaborated on the advantages and disadvantages of the Sino-Russian exchange of waterways for a long time before taking their leave. It is reported that the newly appointed specialist Zhang Shouzeng has also been appointed as a specialist commissioner for shipping affairs. In the 17th year, when Zhang was the Daoyin of Heihe, he was ordered by the government to conclude a 96-article agreement with the Russian consul in Heihe for the repair of international river channels. He is very familiar with the situation of international rivers in the Northeast. Therefore, the shipping representatives plan to visit Zhang within the next few days to present their opinions on the shipping matters. (13th)</p>

<p>Shenyang Communication After the Shenyang District Court sentenced Ye Yixiong to life imprisonment and deprived him of his civil rights for life, Ye immediately declared in court that he was not satisfied and has now filed an appeal with the High Court on the 13th. His reasons for appeal are twofold: (1) The killing was true, but it was not premeditated. Carrying a handgun was a normal habit and was not prepared temporarily for Zhang Liqing, and Zhang Liqing was usually aware of the gun's existence. (2) There was no act of embezzlement. If he had the intention to embezzle, he could have embezzled the large sums of money that Zhang Liqing had previously deposited with him. He would not have embezzled this small amount now. The reason for hiding the draft in his sock was only because he was at a loss after the shooting and feared being searched. It is reported that the High Court has already retrieved the original files yesterday to decide whether to reject the appeal. (15th)</p>

<p>Bengbu Communication Haas, the Minister of Transportation of the League of Nations, accompanied by Transportation Specialist Yu Kexi, engineer Wang Huzhen of the Huai River Commission, and Deputy Engineer Wang Feng, arrived in Bengbu from Beijing yesterday morning (the 16th) to inspect the Huai River. At 9:00 a.m., they boarded the Jiang Ning small steamboat and went west to Huaiyuan for inspection. The military and police authorities stationed in Bengbu specially sent troops to protect the boat. After Haas and his party arrived in Huaiyuan, they were accompanied by the county magistrate to inspect the river form at Matoucheng in the upper reaches of the Huai River. They returned to Bengbu at 5:00 p.m. In the afternoon, at 9:00 a.m. today (the 17th), they again boarded the boat and went east to inspect the Linhuai and Wuhe areas. They returned to Bengbu in the afternoon. It is reported that they are scheduled to take the Pingpu train back to Beijing tonight to present their observations from the inspection to the Huai River Commission for discussion of engineering views.

<h3 id="e75">The Ministry of Finance's Fiscal Report for the 18th Year (Continued) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The sudden rise in gold prices this year has greatly increased the cost of all imported tobacco products and raw materials, severely impacting the tobacco industry. As a result, tobacco merchants have had to raise prices to offset losses. However, the increase in tobacco prices has also led to higher taxes, causing sales to plummet. The situation has led to an increase in inferior tobacco products and high-priced cigarettes being forced into lower tax brackets. The tobacco merchants' business has been greatly affected, and the state's tax revenue has also gradually decreased. Various merchants have repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to the Ministry, requesting tax reductions. The Ministry, considering the market conditions and tax revenue, changed the original seven-level system to a three-level system, allowing for slightly wider price limits and giving tobacco merchants more flexibility. Since the new system was implemented on October 1st of the 19th year, tobacco sales have immediately become more active, and tax revenue has also increased accordingly. However, the main reason for the increase is the implementation of the new system, but the expansion of the collection area and the restoration of peace have also played a significant role. In addition, the crafty behavior of tobacco merchants selling at high prices while paying low taxes has been curbed after the implementation of the new system, and competition in the tobacco industry has also become more active than before. The tax revenue and market conditions have both become more convenient.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the new import tariff on January 1st of the 20th year, the cigarette tax rate has been uniformly set at 43% ad valorem. The three-level system has been retained because of its good results.</p>
<p>Regarding the improvement of the tax system, when the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, various miscellaneous taxes and levies in the country had not been eliminated, and bureaus and offices were numerous with confusing regulations. There was no so-called system. Even in the Shanghai area alone, there were more than 130 central and local tax collection agencies in the 17th year. The Ministry of Finance, as part of its duties, formulated a policy to consolidate various taxes in order to simplify the system. As a result, significant progress has been made. Currently, in addition to the Customs and Salt Affairs Administrations, the remaining national tax collection agencies are only the Consolidated Tax Administration, the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Office, and the collection bureaus and offices for the Fisheries and Mining Taxes. The new taxes such as cotton yarn, matches, and cement, which were established after the abolition of likin, are all handled by the Consolidated Tax Administration in order to save costs. Once the tax system is completely reorganized, all national taxes will be divided among the Customs, Salt Affairs, and Inland Tax Administrations. This will not only reduce expenses but also achieve greater results with less effort in tax administration.</p>
<p>The implementation of the abolition of likin is a manifestation of the government's determination to start anew with the people. The Chinese people have suffered from the harsh and detailed likin taxes for decades. The abolition was delayed because tax revenues were used to make up for deficits and those with vested interests obstructed it. The government had no opportunity to implement its proposal to abolish likin due to the frequent wars in recent years and the emptiness of the national treasury. In January of the 19th year, the government issued a notice that October 10th would be the date for the implementation of the abolition of likin. Later, due to the unfinished military affairs, it had to be postponed until New Year's Day of the 20th year before it could be realized. As of today, all regions except for the border provinces have complied with the order. Although there are still one or two places that are trying to find excuses to avoid it, the abolition of likin is the will of the central government and the people and cannot be ignored. Moreover, the general merchants and people are celebrating the removal of the corrupt system, and they will surely not remain silent about local violations of the order to collect likin.</p>
<p>After the abolition of likin, an estimated 200,000 staff members of the likin bureaus and checkpoints lost their jobs. The likin bureaus in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces accounted for more than 60,000 people. The national tax revenue loss is estimated at more than 80 million yuan, but the corruption and exploitation of likin were so great that the people saved more than 160 million yuan due to the abolition of likin. A portion of the likin tax revenue was retained and allocated for local use, but the net loss to the national treasury is considerable. In addition, the annual subsidy to various provinces for the loss of likin is about 20 million yuan, which is an even greater amount. All national taxes similar to likin, such as railway freight surcharges, postal package taxes, landing taxes, transit taxes, re-import taxes, and regular customs duties (excluding the local product tax of the five inland regular customs), are all abolished. The loss of this tax revenue is also no less than 20 million yuan. At this time when the national treasury is depleted, the government resolutely disregards this huge loss and strives to implement the policy of abolishing likin, truly believing that economic construction cannot be discussed without abolishing likin after the end of the military affairs and the restoration of all government affairs.</p>
<p>In order to seek the sound development of local tax systems, the government has the power to propose and supervise the local business tax. However, the central government still retains this power. Within the scope of the principles promulgated by the central government, each province may formulate separate collection regulations in light of its own special circumstances to facilitate implementation. At the same time, in order to compensate the national treasury, the government has also established consolidated taxes such as cotton yarn, matches, and cement, following the precedent of the consolidated cigarette tax, which are administered by the Consolidated Tax Administration, and collection began on February 1st of this year. The production areas for these products are limited to a few places, making collection easier and more effective.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance will continue to work on improving the tax system and will strive to reform the tax administration, ensuring that collection procedures are standardized, expenses are reduced, and tax revenue is increased, so that the national tax system becomes fairer and the tax administration becomes more enlightened, and the burden on the people is not excessively light or excessively heavy.

<p>Trial Officer Dismissed, Appeals to the High Court During the second round of trial officer recruitment held in the Republic of China in the 18th year, more than ten people were selected, including Ju Bingpan, the former secretary of the Baoshan County Government, who ranked first. In February of last year (the 19th year), he was appointed as a trial officer in Jintan County by President Lin of the High Court. Ju only served for more than 20 days after taking office before requesting to resign due to the difficulty of handling the cases. Subsequently, the High Court sent him to Liuhe County in March. When Ju took office, he brought along a clerk named Liu Chi. Initially, he was diligent and cautious, but later he became arrogant and domineering. By May, nine defendants in cases such as the Da Xing case were planning to apply for bail. Liu Chi claimed that Trial Officer Ju required each defendant to pay 20 yuan. Subsequently, seven people were bailed out after Song Youxing took 106 yuan to the detention center to pay the fees. In July, there was another homicide case involving the Wang Youkun family. At that time, someone asked someone else to mediate. According to Liu Chi, it would cost 1,500 yuan, which was reduced to 800 yuan, but no agreement was reached. Later, the Wang Youkun family requested bail and paid a promissory note from Dingtai for 150 yuan and 150 yuan in banknotes. Afterwards, County Magistrate Liu Xiuyue discovered that Trial Officer Ju was suspected of accepting bribes and submitted a report to the High Court to ask President Lin for instructions. After receiving the report, President Lin ordered the Jiangning District Court to investigate the case according to the law. The Ning District Court sent officials to Liuhe to investigate with County Magistrate Liu and brought Ju Bingpan and Liu Chi back to the Jiangning District Court for interrogation and prosecution. The criminal court concluded the trial in January of this year, sentencing Ju Bingpan to four years of imprisonment for the crime of defrauding money. Liu Chi was sentenced to three years. Ju and others refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Lu Xiangru to appeal to the High Court. Yesterday, Judge Huang of the Second Criminal Division of the High Court held a hearing. Because the summoned witnesses Wang Youhong and Wang Youliang had not reported to the court, the hearing was changed to an investigation court. Ju consistently denied accepting bribes. Judge Huang instructed that the hearing be rescheduled after summoning witnesses for investigation.</p>
<p>Large Towns Discover Bandit Ships Over a dozen bandit ships were discovered in Chefang, a large town, yesterday morning (the 18th). The Public Security Bureau immediately reported the matter and requested that the county government order police teams to pursue and suppress them.</p>

<p>Details of the Robbery in Yaozhen Yaozhen, Zhizhiang, Zhengxiu District, was completely robbed at 7:00 p.m. on the 13th. The entire town was robbed, including Liu F茂Mao's rice shop, Xie Shunxing's bean cake shop, the Sen Hexiang foreign goods store, the Yu Yunmao, Qian Fuchang, and Nanhai stores, the Ling Jiahe salted fish store, the Qian Hengmao hotel, and the Yong Tai Chang foreign goods store, Xuan Yongyuan silversmith. The silversmith, Yongyuan, suffered the greatest losses, with gold and silver ornaments estimated at more than a thousand yuan. The district chief has already reported the matter to County Magistrate Tan, who has ordered the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau to go to the countryside to investigate. Yaozhen is close to the border of Taicang, and its defense is extremely important. On the fourth day after the robbery, at about 3:00 a.m. (approximately eight or nine hours after the Yaozhen robbery), a suspicious speed boat was spotted near Bai Mao's Ayu Pass. Zhang Fengxiang, a police officer stationed there, noticed it and heard the mixed voices of people on the boat. Because it was not yet dawn, he shined a flashlight and saw eight or nine people sitting in the cabin. He ordered them to stop the boat. When they heard the sound, they stopped the boat on the other side of the river and fled ashore into the wilderness. The police officer returned to the team and reported the matter. They went to pursue them, but the bandits had already gone far away. The team members crossed the river to the speed boat and inspected it. They found eight bolts of miscellaneous cloth from the factory and a woman's shirt, but nothing else. The boat and cargo have been sent to the county. Yuan Baiwen, a suspicious person arrested in Yaozhen, was sent to the county yesterday (the 16th). After being thoroughly questioned by the trial officer, Yuan continued to claim that he was a wandering performer. They then ordered the bailiff to search him, but they only found a worn-out overcoat. They decided that he was definitely not a good person and ordered him to be shackled and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Robberies Occur Repeatedly in Dongshizhuang The home of Zhao Hanzhang, a TCM practitioner in Xishou Jinguzhuang in Dongshizhuang, Yuanhe District, was visited by more than ten bandits at about 10:00 p.m. on the 15th. The bandits spoke with local accents and arrived by a large pontoon boat from the east, mooring near Zhao's water station. They landed and went to Zhao Hanzhang's door. A bandit used a bamboo pole to climb over the wall and open the gate, letting in the other bandits. Zhao Hanzhang and his wife were tied up. They opened the boxes and robbed the family. Fortunately, the niece secretly ran to Dongshizhuang to call for help and beat the drums. The bandits then returned to their boat and fled. Upon inspection, the total loss was approximately one thousand gold.</p>

Yesterday, a special meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce with the county's Chamber of Commerce to gather leaders from various industries, attended by more than 40 people. County Magistrate Pan Zhuang and Finance Bureau Chief explained the intentions of the county government, saying that this project would be funded by the income from land and house deed taxes. They only sought to solicit donations so that a certain percentage could be obtained, and did not limit the collection of rents. Finally, it was decided that (1) the County Government Finance Bureau would organize another committee to solicit donations; (1) leaders from various industries would do their best to provide guidance, and report to the department after a certain percentage had been obtained.</p>

He went to Wuxi from Shanghai. He opened a room which was room 3. Not long after that, he went to bed. The hotel waiter went into the hotel when this guest didn't wake up for a long time. The waiter suddenly saw him vomiting white foam and his breath was weak. It was already poisoning and was reported to a nearby police office. The victim was sent to the hospital for treatment. Doctor Zhu managed to save him. However, it might be fatal due to poison. Also, Shenghua, 46, a resident of Shen Xiang, the 17th District (Fuan Township), Hushan Town, possessed some land in his home. Two years ago, he married Ding Wu, a female resident of Hong Kong, as his second wife. Her daughter Ding was 22 years old.

The Provincial Capital Construction Engineering Office plans to install a light railway on the bank of the canal from near the Xiaozhaikou to the Xinximen to transport the soil. However, ships traveling to and from the canal normally enter and exit through the Jianbikou and Dantu ports. During the spring and summer seasons, when the water level gradually rises, some ships change their route and enter and exit through the Xiaozhaikou for convenience. Now that the area is being used as a temporary construction site, all transport ships are temporarily prohibited from entering during the construction period and must travel through the Jianbikou or Dantu ports to avoid obstructing the project. Ships coming to Zhenjiang from the canal can still open to the new Ximen Bridge Danyang dock.</p>

<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Plans to Redeem for Two Hundred Thousand Yuan. Since both parties appointed lawyer Gao Shuo and Yamina as arbitrators in the Jin Li Yuan wharf case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the two parties have been negotiating. However, Father Tridel of the French side has taken a stubborn attitude, and the scope of his arbitration only extends to how the French court will execute the judgment. Only after negotiations did he agree to sell the wharf, asking for 360,000 yuan. Subsequently, Father Tridel went to Korea for business, and the French side prevaricated, causing the negotiations to be delayed. It is now learned that Tridel has returned to Shanghai. Gao Shuo, the arbitrator of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, visited Tridel at the Tridel Church to negotiate the case. Tridel's remarks were mostly rude and stubborn. It is said that Tridel, who previously served as a priest in Annam, is ignorant of the situation in China, which has caused considerable resentment on our side. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has now formally written to the Tridel Church, agreeing to redeem the wharf for 200,000 yuan. As for the French court, it has also appointed a third arbitrator and set a deadline of two months to resolve the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e93">German Warship Emden to Visit China <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on the 21st of Next Month. It is reported that the German warship Emden is about to visit China. The ship is scheduled to sail from the Philippines on April 15 and arrive in Nanjing. It will be berthed in Nanjing until April 20, and then arrive in Shanghai around April 21. It will stay in Shanghai for about a week. The German Navy has named its warships Emden three times, and the current ship is its third one. It has been learned that the Emden was launched on January 7, 1925, and officially joined the Navy on October 15 of the same year. It has a displacement of 6,000 tons, a length of 155 meters, a width of 14.03 meters, and a draft of 6.03 meters. The ship has 22 officers, 3 warrant officers, 15 lieutenants, 112 sergeants, 314 soldiers, and 67 naval cadets. The ship is equipped with eight 15 cm guns, two 8.8 cm guns, and two surface torpedo tubes. Its maximum speed is 29.05 nautical miles per hour. The ship served as a training ship from 1926 to 1928 and from 1928 to 1929, circumnavigating the globe twice. In the spring of 1930, it also made a four-month overseas voyage in the West Indian Ocean. The ship will now sail overseas for twelve months, passing through the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and East Asia, and then returning via Africa. The main purpose of this voyage of the German ship Emden is to train naval cadets and officers and men on board. The ship carries a total of 67 naval officers, machinists, and quartermasters who are in training. They have received six months of training in their own country before this overseas voyage. After the voyage is completed at the end of December this year, they will take the entrance examination. The captain of the Emden is Lieutenant Commander Witthoef. During the European War in 1914, Witthoef served as the torpedo officer on the German warship Emden. Witthoef personally participated in all the battles fought by the former Emden in the Indian Ocean at that time. The executive officer of the ship is Lieutenant Commander Siemens. Siemens served in the German First High Seas Cruiser Squadron during the European War from 1914 to 1918. The chief engineer of the ship, Lieutenant Commander Kaufmadn, also served in the German First High Seas Cruiser Squadron at the beginning of the European War and served as the chief engineer of the submarine force in the Mediterranean Sea from 1916 to 1918. The ship's press officer is Lieutenant Commander Ltiele. It is said that the captain of the ship will also entertain journalists. The date will be determined after arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Sanxin Textile Factory Declares Sale <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled for Full Handover Today　　Social Affairs Bureau Sends Personnel to Investigate Thoroughly. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Sanxin Textile Factory on 87 Yangshupu Road has been in operation for more than 40 years. Now, it has suddenly declared its sale and is scheduled to be handed over today. After learning the truth, all the workers elected representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting assistance. The details are as follows: Sanxin History. Sanxin Textile Co., Ltd. has more than 4,000 male and female workers, registered in Hong Kong under the British merchant brand. The factory owner is Sheng Xuanhuai. After Xuanhuai's death, his sons Sheng Zecheng, Sheng Pingcheng, and Sheng Shengzu continued to manage it. The manager is Sheng Yulin. It is not yet clear to the outside world whether this sale is to Japanese or Chinese.</p>
<p>Authorities Investigate Thoroughly. All the workers of the Sanxin Textile Factory were informed that the factory was to be sold and handed over. Therefore, they specially elected representatives Hou Jia Hai, Lou Tai Zhong, Gu Lan Sheng, etc. yesterday afternoon to submit a petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting assistance. After receiving the report, the bureau believed that it was a major issue concerning the future of China's textile industry. In the past, when the Housheng Yarn Factory was to be sold, the Ministry of Industry had ordered that it be prevented. This time, it is necessary to pay attention to who the Sanxin is being sold to. Therefore, Wang Gang was sent to investigate thoroughly for review and handling.</p>
<p>Petition from the Workers' Union. The Textile Industry Workers' Union of the Third Special District submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that the Sanxin Yarn Factory has announced its sale and that the entire factory must be handed over tomorrow (i.e., the 19th). Please provide assistance. It is thought that the factory is not failing in business and is not going bankrupt, but it is causing all 4,000 workers of the union to have nowhere to seek food and to be buried in a dead end. Some of the workers have been working in the factory since childhood and are now old and exhausted. They have made some contributions to the factory. Now, the union has submitted a request on behalf of all the workers, requesting your bureau to find a way to provide assistance and negotiate for compensation. The undersigned is fearful and awaits orders. Sincerely submitted.</p>

<p>Interpretation by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter from the Silk and Satin Industry Consolidation Committee, inquiring whether there should be restrictions on the member representatives of trade associations representing two types of firms. It had previously submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for interpretation. Now, the bureau has forwarded the Supreme Court's interpretation to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform the association that for companies and firms that send representatives to attend the association, each company and firm may send one to two people, limited to managers or principals. If a firm has two locations, both of which are personally operated and have no other managers or principals who can represent them, then one person can represent both firms. However, non-profit legal persons are different from for-profit legal persons. Therefore, they can only exercise one voting right or right to vote.</p>

<p>Five Arrested by French Police. According to the Great America Evening Post, at about 1:00 AM this morning (the 18th), the French police discovered a conspiracy to incite Annam soldiers in the Masnan Road barracks to rebel. Subsequently, five Chinese were arrested at Laiqing Lane (translation) on Father Loh Road and are currently being detained for investigation. Earlier, Detective No. 190 of the French police was passing by the barracks and saw a Chinese distributing leaflets on the ground in front of the gate. After finishing the work, he went towards Father Loh Road. The detective picked up one and checked it. It was printed in Annam language, advising the Vietnamese soldiers to resist the French government. Therefore, he chased after the person and brought him back to the police station. After questioning, he learned that he lived in Laiqing Lane. Therefore, he went to search and found more leaflets and red carbon paper, etc. He also arrested the four people in the house. After further questioning in the morning, it was learned that the five people were all communists and were believed to be acting under the orders of the Vietnamese Communist Party branch.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Important Shipping News <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Tonghua Collides. The Tonghua, a coastal steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was berthed at the Dapu Wharf in Haizhou to unload cargo. At that time, the Xuzhou, a steamer of the United States Company, also arrived at the site. Due to excessive tides, the Xuzhou's hull crashed into the Tonghua. At this time, the Tonghua was berthed at the wharf and could not retreat, but it was above the waterline and did not affect navigation. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has already telegraphed the Tonghua to return to Shanghai and send personnel to inspect and claim compensation from the United States Company after clarifying the extent of the damage and estimating the repair costs. There were no losses to passengers or cargo.</p>
<p>Reef Discovered. The Gongping, a steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, sailed to Dalian. The first batch of 22 navigation school students in the bureau were assigned to the ship for practice. According to the ship's telegraph yesterday, a new reef was discovered near Sheshan, ninety nautical miles away. It was not marked on the nautical chart, but it is a necessary route for Qingdao Haizhou navigation. All Qinghai ships must pay extra attention to this new reef when traveling to and from Qinghai. Stamp Duty on Tickets. The Shanghai Shipping Association specially invited representatives of various shipping companies to a meeting to discuss the issue of affixing stamp duty to ship tickets. They unanimously opposed it and decided to reply to the municipal government later.</p>
<h3 id="e99">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Abolishes the Foreign Crew Pension System <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Abolishing Unilateral Unequal Demands　　Newly Revised Regulations for Rewarding and Commiserating with Crew Members　　General Manager Li Explained to Foreign Staff Yesterday. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company still has more than thirty foreign crew members, most of whom have served for two or three years. Since the last case of Jiang'an Chief Mate Keranek requesting retirement and pension, the lawsuit has lasted for more than a year, and the result was rejected by the court. Other British crew members who have retired and demanded pensions from the bureau and the British Minister to China have raised negotiations. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also discussed a solution to this case. After the Airin ship was sunk by British artillery off the coast of Huizhou, the responsibility for compensation has not yet been resolved. The bureau has replied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the pensions of the retired British crew members can be allocated, but the case of the British warship sinking the Airin ship should also be compensated. The matter can be resolved after the compensation is paid. General Manager Li issued a notice to reward and commiserate with crew members and to provide retirement funds, stating that the treatment of crew members at all levels was rarely regulated when the company was privately run. After the company was nationalized in February of the 17th year, although the dismissal of various crew members seemed to create a regulation, those who had served for many years had no reward. This was not in line with the idea of rewarding hard work. As for the foreign crew members, in 1921, at the beginning of the European War, the foreign crew members in China jointly wrote to Chinese and foreign shipping companies requesting subsidies, retirement pensions, and other extra allowances to prevent foreign crew members from competing in China after the war and to protect their original jobs. At that time, the former directors were suffering from environmental pressure and reluctantly agreed to the request. Now that times have changed, the root cause of this request has long disappeared completely, and Jardine Matheson and Taikoo have also revised their regulations. This one-sided unequal request between Chinese and foreigners has long been invalid in our bureau, and there is no reason to continue it alone. Since taking over the management, former General Manager Zhao issued the crew service regulations, which were very detailed in terms of dividing positions and establishing systems. However, the retirement and pension issues were not regulated, and there were as many as forty to fifty foreign crew members who had served for two and a half years without being handled according to these regulations. This shows that the unequal demands between Chinese and foreigners had long been obvious. The Jiang'an chief mate case is further evidence that this regulation should be abolished. Over the years, no foreign crew member has raised objections, and there has been no written statement from foreign crew members in the previous files. There is no doubt that foreign crew members have tacitly agreed to the abolition. The commissioner cares for workers and treats Chinese and foreigners equally. He expresses his appreciation for the foreign crew members' understanding of the situation and their loyalty to their duties. In addition to the special regulations for crew service, regulations will be promulgated to reward the foreign crew members who serve in the bureau, taking into account the situation of the bureau and reconciling the old and new regulations to formulate simple reward and commiseration regulations to make up for the previous deficiencies. All retirement bonuses for foreign crew members will be in accordance with the regulations in this chapter (omitted below). The reward and commiseration methods are divided into six levels, from five years to more than thirty years, with every five years as a level. At each level, a salary of one month will be given. Those who have served for more than five years and retire will be given a bonus of one month, two months for more than ten years, three months for more than fifteen years, and so on, up to six months. Those who are injured or killed on duty or become disabled will be given a pension according to the circumstances. After the publication of these regulations, some foreign crew members on various ships who did not understand the situation and caused misunderstandings and panic, General Manager Li heard about this yesterday and immediately invited the chief shipowner of the bureau, McKenna, the deputy chief shipowner, and the chief engineer to explain in person. Since the foreign crew members are serving in the bureau and the bureau is state-owned, the staff should abide by Chinese laws and regulations. He also stated that the treatment in the new reward and commiseration regulations is fair and generous. The chief shipowner and others saw it as a consolation for the foreign staff and explained it for them to avoid misunderstandings. This matter is expected to not cause problems.</p>

<p>Important Speech Yesterday afternoon, when the representatives visited the Commodity Inspection Bureau, Ye Yuanding gave a speech on China's cotton inspection policy and cotton industry improvement issues. His speech stated: Cotton has always been one of China's key agricultural products. The annual production is estimated at approximately seven million dan, and the cotton field area is thirty million mu. Approximately three million farmers rely on cotton cultivation for a living. There are countless millions of others who indirectly rely on the cotton industry and commerce for a living. Therefore, its impact on the national lifeline and people's livelihood is extremely significant. Although China's climate is mild and its soil is fertile, and the area suitable for cotton is even more abundant than in the United States, the results are far apart, which is unexpected. In addition, China's total population accounts for a quarter of the world's population, while cotton production only accounts for one-tenth of the world's production. As a result, more than three million dan of foreign cotton and two hundred million taels of foreign cotton textiles are imported annually. Chinese people must spare no effort to seek improvement. If the cotton industry fails to compete, it will be harmful to the country and the people. There are myriad ways to improve the cotton industry. Except for promoting benefits and eliminating disadvantages, implementing a cotton inspection policy is the primary attempt. China's cotton is prone to water and impurities, especially water, which is the most widespread problem and has been a long-standing practice. Each year, this results in rejection or price suppression in the international market and raw material spoilage and mechanical damage in the domestic market, with a value of approximately several million taels. Moreover, Chinese people are willing to use foreign cotton mixed with impurities as raw materials for spinning, with an annual outflow of approximately ninety million taels. Eliminating the drawbacks of cotton and stopping unnecessary losses is a passive improvement for cotton inspection policies. Furthermore, China's cotton trade has never had a detailed analysis and standardized grading system based on scientific methods. It only uses place names or province names as standards, such as Tongzhou cotton or Shaanxi cotton. However, cotton quality can vary greatly due to environmental influences such as climate, variety, and human labor. If grading and pricing are based on local areas, then low-quality cotton from famous cotton-producing areas can obtain high prices, while high-quality cotton from unknown areas will have the same price as ordinary low-quality cotton. Without scientific standards and grades, merchants can easily profit from this, deliberately lowering prices and causing farmers to suffer endless losses. This cannot stimulate the farmers' competitive spirit. Farmers do not pay attention to variety cultivation improvement. Although the government or private individuals promote improvements, it is difficult to achieve good results because cotton merchants control everything. Farmers exhaust their efforts to harvest high-quality cotton but still cannot obtain the benefits they deserve, so it is better to cultivate low-quality cotton with extensive cultivation. Creating cotton grading standards to protect the interests of cotton farmers is an active improvement for cotton inspection policies. In addition, there are origin publicity, ginning household registration, cotton industry statistics, market reports, packaging ginning research, and storage construction, etc., which not only directly promote the comprehensive cotton inspection policy but also indirectly benefit the cotton industry. Based on the above reasons, the current National Government has made a great determination to eliminate the accumulated drawbacks of the cotton industry in the short term and plans for future development. Cotton inspection bureaus or branches will be established in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Ningbo, Shashi, Jinan, and other places to strictly inspect and fundamentally eliminate the water issue in cotton within five years. After five years, the water inspection will end, and the government will issue regulations to prevent future troubles. Cotton inspection will focus on research and promotion of grade standards and quality appraisal, so that China's cotton industry will improve day by day and keep pace with the United States, which will not only be a blessing for the country but also benefit cotton industry farmers and merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Various Groups Welcome Zhu Qinglan <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Assisting in Disaster Relief in Shaanxi With the disaster in Shaanxi becoming increasingly severe, Zhu Ziqiao, Kang Jiyao, and Zha Mianshen came to Shanghai to raise funds for relief. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the local Chinese and Foreign Relief Society held a board meeting to welcome the three gentlemen to report on the disaster situation. The Chinese and Western directors hosted the meeting. Chairman Song Hanzhang delivered a speech, saying that everyone in the country knows that Mr. Zhu and Mr. Kang are great philanthropists. This time, they personally investigated the disaster in Shaanxi, braving the wind and dust, and spared no effort to appeal for help. We are greatly honored by their presence at our society. Since the disaster occurred in the northwest, our society has cooperated with the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society in Xi'an to provide relief. At the same time, Henan, Gansu, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces have successively reported famine, and although we have considered all aspects, we have never stopped providing assistance. However, this is only a small part of our duty. The disaster in Shaanxi has lasted for three years, and our society has remitted a total of 268,500 yuan to the Shaanxi Society for relief, which has only been able to increase the number of porridge factories and shelters. We are deeply ashamed that our efforts have been insufficient. Mr. Zhu's efforts to save the disaster victims in Shaanxi are well known to our society and are admirable. Mr. Kang is the chairman of the Shaanxi Chinese and Foreign Relief Society and is also a rare talent in the charity world. In the report from the Shaanxi Society, we learned that Mr. Kang's leadership is well-organized and practical, and that funds are not wasted. Both of them can be regarded as the two major saviors of the Northwest. We are grateful for their visit and guidance, which has benefited all of us. It is a pity that Mr. Zhu has other engagements and cannot stay for a long conversation, which is a regret. I would like to express my sincere welcome in a few words. We also welcome Mr. Zha Mianzheng's presence at our society today. Mr. Zha has always been very enthusiastic about the relief efforts in Shaanxi and admires Mr. Zhu very much. Mr. Zhu stood up and responded with (1) thanks for the relief, (2) a report on the disaster situation, and (3) a request for all charitable organizations to achieve the goal of saving people in the serious disaster in Shaanxi. At this critical time, with only three months left until the wheat harvest, emergency relief is important, but work relief must also be considered. We hope to raise more relief funds to complete the charitable cause and hope that the government will assist in forming a large organization to work together. Because the disaster area is too large, it will not be effective without this. Mr. Kang said that the disaster in Shaanxi is so tragic that words cannot describe it. There are more than three million dead and more than ten thousand unburied bodies. This is a true fact. The reason why they have not been buried is that most of their families have died. Recently, two Western officials inspected the disaster area and said that they had never seen or heard of such a thing. The disaster in Fufeng and other counties is particularly severe. The funds recently remitted by the Shanghai Society have been used to establish six more shelters, but there are still at least two months before the wheat harvest. In these two months, each person needs at least two yuan in relief to save a life. If we do not actively provide relief at this time, it will be a waste of effort. Mr. Zhang Xianqing then described the situation of personally providing relief in Shaanxi, saying that it is difficult to achieve a thorough solution without work relief, but work relief requires a large amount of relief funds. The Chinese and Western directors were deeply moved and hoped that all sectors of society would assist in completing the charitable cause.</p>
<p>Ningbo-Shaoxing Fellow Association The Ningbo Fellow Association and the Shaoxing Fellow Association in Shanghai held a banquet yesterday afternoon at the Fellow Association Hall to welcome Zhu Qinglan. During the banquet, Zhu Qinglan reported on the disaster situation in Shaanxi, hoping that Ningbo and Shaoxing and people in Shanghai would assist in providing relief so that the survivors of the disaster could survive. Everyone present was moved. At the end of the banquet, a film about the Shaanxi disaster was shown before the gathering dispersed.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Peiyuan, Chairman of the Red Cross, and Mr. Wang Zhenchuan, in charge of public relations, paid a visit to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao the other day to discuss helping the disaster area of Shaanxi to treat the plague. It has been reported in the previous newspapers. It is now known that the wounds in various counties in Xi'an are numerous, and self-treatment is particularly urgent, so Mr. Wang has reported to the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Association, Mr. Wen Lanting, and others to prepare in advance, and with the support of Mr. Wen, a list of expensive medicines has been drawn up and submitted to various pharmacies for bidding, and the transaction will be completed soon. The medicine will be delivered to Mr. Zhu to take to Shaanxi for use.</p>

<p>Sending letters to various groups to beg for aid, the representative of the Gansu Accounts Committee, Yang Zuorong, yesterday sent letters to various groups reporting on the disaster situation in Gansu. He stated that Gansu is located in a remote area in the west, with poor transportation, and has suffered a great calamity for five years. Because the people have been under the long-standing intimidation of Feng's troops, it is difficult for them to speak out. The accountants are unable to move forward due to dangerous roads, so the true situation of the disaster in Gansu has not been fully disclosed, which is very painful. The disaster situation is described as follows: 1. Drought: The autumn harvest in the sixteenth year was poor, there was no harvest in the seventeenth year, the harvest in the eighteenth year was less than 20%, and there was no ability to plant in the nineteenth year. More than one million people have died of starvation in the 60 disaster-stricken counties. 2. War: In the five years since Feng's troops entered Gansu, they have forcibly conscripted 200,000 soldiers and ordered the counties to forcibly requisition military vehicles and horses, as well as apportion funds and grain. 3. Banditry: Within three years, more than 200,000 people throughout the province have died directly at the hands of bandits. Houses have been burned, and women have been looted in every county. Villages have been reduced to ruins, and fields have been abandoned. There is no plan for relief. There are only survivors who hope to provide assistance.</p>

<p>Complete Withdrawal After Six Months The Shanghai Postal Administration has prepared various commemorative stamps in the past, but some have become outdated and are no longer attractive. All of these stamps, including the old Sun Yat-sen portrait, Zhang Zuolin portrait, the unified constitution, and the 25th anniversary of the Postal Administration, will be withdrawn after six months. The bureau has submitted a request to the ministry for approval. If domestic postal districts and bureaus have accumulated the above-mentioned commemorative stamps within six months, they can be collected and sent to the Shanghai General Administration for exchange for newly printed Sun Yat-sen's portrait, Chen Yingshi, Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, and other martyrs' portrait commemorative stamps for the public to purchase and use.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Taxpayers Association Protests the Municipal Council's Assessment of Donations <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Letter Requesting Cancellation Notification Not to Pay Official Letter from the Chinese Ratepayers' Association According to a report from the China Chemical Industry Society on Henan Road, the association sent another letter to the Municipal Council, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the basis for the municipal general donation (巡捕捐) is the actual rent, in addition to the estimated rent for self-owned properties, which is the principle of municipal finance. We requested your bureau to pay attention to this matter in our letter of March 6. According to a letter from the Shanghai China Chemical Industry Society, the donation office of the Public Concession Municipal Council notified us on December 22 last year that the annual rent for the properties at 444 and 445 Henan Road, currently occupied by our company, should be increased from 1,666 yuan to 3,162 yuan, and that donation taxes should be collected according to the new amount starting from January 1, 1931. Those who wish to protest should submit a letter within fourteen days from the date of this notification. Since our company's current rent is leased from the accounting department of Thiele &amp; Co. at a monthly rent of 100 taels per building, and we hold a rent receipt as proof, which is 16 taels more expensive than the neighbor's monthly rent of 84 taels, how can it be arbitrarily increased to double the amount? Furthermore, the estimated rent has only been applied to self-owned property owners in the past. Now, an illegal additional burden is suddenly imposed on tenants. Our company cannot recognize this and has already protested within the specified time limit. All the policies of the bureau should be guided by the public opinion of the taxpayers. How can we rashly change precedents? Your association is the largest organization of Chinese taxpayers, and everyone admires your upholding of justice. Our company does not want to set a bad precedent for ourselves and cause unlimited trouble for the entire community in the future. Therefore, we report the facts and send our company's employee, Wu Xiongxiang, to present the details in person. We sincerely ask for your guidance and fairness." Various evidences were also presented to the meeting. After research by the association, it was learned that the Municipal Council's collection of the municipal general donation (also known as the patrol donation) will be calculated based on the estimated rent instead of the actual rent. This method is absolutely considered inappropriate by the association and should be cancelled. Assuming that the actual rent is 100 yuan per month, the total donation will be 14 yuan according to the current rate of 14%. If it is calculated based on the estimated rent, and the estimated rent is 10,000 yuan per month, then the total donation will be 1,400 yuan according to the current rate of 14%. Is this a reasonable method? Calculating according to this case, the estimated rent is almost doubled compared to the actual rent. Isn't the donation rate increased from 14% to 26.57% or more? Therefore, the municipal general donation must not be calculated according to the estimated rent and should be calculated according to the actual rent. Moreover, raising the rent greatly affects the market. According to the above, we hereby send a letter hoping that you will investigate and cancel the unreasonable method of collecting the total donation based on the estimated rent.</p>
<p>Notification The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association issued a notification yesterday, stating: "For the matter of notification, taxpayers have repeatedly reported that the Municipal Council in the concession will calculate the municipal general donation (i.e., patrol donation) based on the estimated rent instead of the actual rent and has notified that it will be implemented starting from January 1 this year, requesting negotiations, etc., to the association. After investigation, the collection of the municipal general donation based on the actual rent is the practice in this concession and is also the principle of municipal finance. Therefore, the total donation is based on the rent receipt, and only houses that are self-owned and self-occupied and have no rent will be calculated according to the estimated rent. Now, if we, the taxpayers who rent houses, allow the Municipal Council to collect the total donation based on the estimated rent, and the estimated amount of the current Municipal Council is higher than the actual rent, there will inevitably be a day when the total donation exceeds the rent amount, and it will also help to increase the rent and increase the burden. How can taxpayers allow this? In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Council to cancel this unreasonable method, we hereby notify the taxpayers in the concession that the payment of the total donation should be calculated according to the actual rent and should not be calculated according to the estimated rent. This is a notification from the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association on March 18, 1931."</p>
<h3 id="e108">Rickshaw Merchants Petitioned Party and Government Agencies Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Citizens' Training Council Approved No Discussion Because the municipal government is planning to increase the number of rickshaw licenses, rickshaw merchants in the Chinese area jointly petitioned the municipal party headquarters yesterday morning for assistance. About 400 merchants from the northern and southern cities arrived and elected Wang Rongqing, Li Bingyi, Che Lisheng, Zhou Jinting, Yu Dajin, Zhao Tianyuan, and Han Xueyue as petition representatives. The Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association drafted a petition stating the reasons for the petition. Zhu Ya, the secretary of the Citizens' Training Council, received the delegation. Committee member Wu Kaixian then summoned the representatives to inquire about everything. The representatives immediately stated that the rickshaw industry is difficult and that the rickshaw dealers intend to sabotage the situation. Committee member Wu said that the government's increase in the number of rickshaws is naturally intended to provide for the poor coolies. As for how to increase the number of rickshaws without being deceived by the rickshaw dealers and affecting the livelihoods of the poor, he agreed to forward the intentions to the municipal government. The representatives were all satisfied and returned to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Section Chief Tian Heqing received them and agreed to forward the matter to the director and request the municipal government to pay attention to the method of increasing the number of rickshaws. The representatives then dispersed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Citizens' Training Council of the Municipal Party Headquarters approved the Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association's petition, stating: "We have received your petition. The municipal government's increase in the number of rickshaw licenses is originally intended to provide for the poor rickshaw pullers. Your association should uphold this intention to alleviate the hardship of the workers. We fear that unscrupulous merchants may attempt to manipulate the situation. In addition to forwarding a letter from our association to the municipal government to prevent this, your association should pay attention at all times. If you discover the above-mentioned situation, you can report it directly to the association for investigation. The request to cancel the increase in the number of rickshaw licenses should not be discussed."</p>

<p>Dog Racing Members' Competition Also Not Permitted. The Public Concession Bureau of Works had previously resolved to prohibit the Mingyuan and Shenyuan dog racing tracks within the concession after March 11th. Subsequently, the Mingyuan side changed its approach, advocating for limiting dog racing to members' competitions with the nature of an association, hoping to maintain its disguised gambling. The Board of Directors of the Bureau of Works held a routine meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the so-called members' competition of Mingyuan and resolved to maintain the original plan. The Mingyuan and Shenyuan dog racing tracks will still be closed at the end of this month, and the so-called members' competition is also not permitted. In addition, the purchase of the Dahua Hotel was also discussed. Because the selling price required 4,111,510 taels, which was too expensive, it was rejected. As for the Bureau of Works adding Chinese to serve as senior staff, the names previously debated included "Chief Chinese Affairs Officer," "Deputy Chief Chinese Affairs Officer," and "Chinese Political Advisor." Yesterday's meeting did not raise this issue, but a decision is expected at the next routine meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Where Does Police Authority Lie for Road Construction Beyond Boundaries? <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Patrol Officer Detained in the Police Station　　Public Security Bureau Lodges a Protest. Liu Zhenya and Li Shiying, patrol officers from the First Section of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei, patrolled the branch road of Rue D'Esperey, which the Bureau of Works had built beyond the boundary, around 1:30 PM yesterday. A police head of the Rue D'Esperey police station noticed and ordered patrol officers to drag the two patrol officers into the police station. Tao, the section chief of the First Section of the Fifth District, learned of the matter. Considering that the area was indeed within the Chinese boundary and that the police head should not overstep his authority, he ordered police officers to reason with the police head and release Liu and Li, while also reporting the situation to Director Chen and the Chief Inspector, in order to uphold police authority.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Another Dispute and Lawsuit Regarding the Sichuan-Hankou Railway <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Three People Claim to Be General Manager　　Who Is the Real One? Zhang Taijie, the former general manager and resident manager in Hankou of the Sichuan Railway Company, was sued in the Shanghai District Court by Kang Qianli, chairman of the board of directors, on behalf of Zeng Xianzhi, for embezzling more than three million yuan in public funds and sentenced to imprisonment. Since then, many people have been vying for the position of general manager. First, Feng Lizhou and Zou Yunchun, were appointed as acting general manager and resident manager in Hankou, but Feng and Zou did not formally take office for a long time. Chairman Kang Qianli then appointed Ni Gongwei to replace Feng and Zou, while also dismissing Feng and Zou. However, Feng and Zou still demanded reinstatement, leading to disputes, mutual accusations, and the engagement of lawyers to publish notices in newspapers. On February 6th of this year, lawyer Liu Hui, representing Feng and Zou, published an advertisement in the Shen and Xin newspapers, stating that Ni Gongwei's appointment as general manager of the Sichuan Railway Company was a private appointment by Zeng Xianzhi, who had stolen the board of directors' seal, and claiming that Ni Gongwei was attempting to achieve the purpose of accumulating wealth in collusion with Zeng Xianzhi. When Ni saw the advertisement, he believed that his position had been appointed by a majority of the board of directors, while Feng and Zou had been dismissed and were falsely accusing others. He then hired a lawyer to sue Feng and Zou for the crimes of forging documents, defaming reputation and credit, obstructing freedom, and embezzlement under Articles 225, Section 1, 328, 319, and 356 of the Criminal Code. Feng also hired lawyers such as Tang Mingshi to argue that the defendants' publication of the notice was a good-faith expression of opinion and self-defense, which should not be punished according to law, and filed a counterclaim, requesting that Ni be prosecuted for false accusation, fraud, and embezzlement under Articles 180 and 356 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiexun of the Special Court held a hearing. When asked about their professions, the original and defendant both claimed to be the general manager and resident manager in Hankou of the Sichuan Railway Company. The defendant's attorney then stated that the circumstances of the case were very complicated, with many side issues. There are now Sichuan officials and gentry who have come forward as third parties to mediate. If mediation is possible, all lawsuits of the Sichuan Railway Company can be resolved, and this case is related to the case of Feng Lizhou suing Zeng yesterday. The court has already issued an order for Feng's lawsuit against Zeng to be settled out of court (this case was detailed in yesterday's newspaper). Therefore, the defense attorney requested a postponement to attempt mediation, wondering what the plaintiff's attorney thought. The plaintiff's attorney then stated that the plaintiff strongly supports mediation. However, according to Ni Gongwei's opinion, mediation is permissible, but litigation should still proceed. Judge Xiao then declared that the court had previously investigated the Zhang Taijie case at the Shanghai District Court but had not yet received a reply. The witness Liu Yajue and others had also not arrived today, and the three plaintiffs and defendants all claimed to be the general manager and resident manager in Hankou of the Sichuan Railway Company, so it was necessary to investigate to determine who was who. Therefore, the case was adjourned for two weeks for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Liu Xieyu, a Student at the Construction University, Imprisoned Due to Friends <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Two Classmates Suspected of Being Reactionaries　　Liu Also Inevitably Caught in the Whirlpool. Liu Xieyu, a student at the Construction University, is just a young man from Changzhou. He studied at sea, not boarding at the school with other out-of-town students, but renting an apartment near the school at No. 138 Huade Road, Yangshupu. The other day, detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, accompanied by Lee Lian-chuan, an investigator from the Huishan Police Station in charge of the area, suddenly arrested him from his residence. His bedroom was searched and a card with the name Bao Kaizhi and a note with Bao's communication address were found. Bao used to be a classmate of Liu's and was arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau with Yang Hongxun on suspicion of being a reactionary. Yang was also Liu's classmate, so he was implicated. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the District Court of the Special Region, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated him. According to the police lawyer Li Zhishan, the card and the note with the communication address were common social items. One should not be considered an accomplice just because the person on the card is a criminal. Therefore, if it is desired to accuse Liu of being a reactionary, concrete evidence must be presented to prove it, otherwise, there is no objection to the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer and interrogation. Otherwise, a postponement should be requested for detailed investigation. Liu Xieyu then testified that although he used to be classmates with Yang and Bao, he had not seen them for a long time. He was unaware of their recent actions and did not know anything about them. Fu Sucun, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, then stated that Yang and Bao had already been sent to the Garrison Headquarters, so they could not be brought to the court today for questioning. Judge Feng then instructed the defendant Liu Xieyu to be temporarily detained at the police station and adjourned the case for seven days, pending the Municipal Public Security Bureau's interrogation of the two suspects, Yang and Bao, before making a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Hubei Refugees Accused of Robbery in Shanghai <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Directors of Shaluo Township Accuse of Robbery　　Silver Notes Found in Refugees' Suitcases　　Police and Local Security Testify No Robbery　　Arguments Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing. Over two hundred refugees from Chun County, Hubei Province, which had suffered from the scourge of the Communists, elected Chen Zichun as their leader to represent them in requesting relief in various counties and cities. This group of refugees arrived in Shaluo Township, about five li southwest of Zhuanqiao in the southwestern township of this county. He Runzhi and He Xu, directors of the area, reported to the county public security bureau with Wang Chengyao, the head of the security team, and the refugee leaders Chen Zichun, Chen Hanxing, Chen Wangshi, and Chen Huangshi were detained. According to He Runzhi, the refugees had forcibly robbed them of over two hundred yuan in foreign currency, gold jewelry, eighty pairs of ivory chopsticks, and dozens of bolts of cloth. Subsequently, Captain Wang opened the refugees' suitcases and found 105 yuan in banknotes and 45 yuan in silver coins, but no jewelry, ivory, or cloth. The case was then transferred to the District Court, and Prosecutor Zhao prosecuted the refugees on charges of robbery. Yesterday morning, Judge Deng held a hearing. According to the refugees, they were not starving people, but prosperous citizens in their hometowns who had been harmed by the bandits and Communists and had come out to escape. Not one of the over two hundred people was without money. The banknotes that were found were their own and the travel expenses given by the institutions along the way, and the gold jewelry was also their own. From Zhuanqiao to the road, they were escorted out of the territory by patrol officers. If they had committed robbery, the police would never have allowed it. They also met the local security officer He Runyu, who distributed food and led them to the plaintiff's home. The plaintiff even paid them five yuan, which shows that they did not commit robbery. They also stated that the entire group is now working and waiting for the outcome of the case at Gaomiaozi in Pudong and requested a clear understanding. When questioned, the plaintiffs He Runzhi and his wife stated that the robbery was real and pointed to Chen Hanxing, Chen Wangshi, and Chen Huangshi as the perpetrators. Chen Zichun did not come. They also stated that there is now a pair of cloth pants that are stolen goods. The defendants stated that they saw a pair of white-waisted pants in the Public Security Bureau, but now they have a black cloth waist, which is a swap. The judge then summoned the security team leader Wang Chengyao, who testified that the defendants had committed robbery. However, the patrol officers Liu Desheng and He Yangfeng, who escorted them at the time, testified that they did not see them robbing. They were escorted in the back. According to Gu Xiaodi, who watched the Chun Shen Temple in Xinzhuang, he was the boatman who hired a boat for the refugees. The boatman Gu Caisheng stated that the refugees got on the boat and went to Maqiao without going ashore. The judge asked patrol officer Wang Zhiqiang, who testified that Wang Chengyao went to the refugees' place. The suitcases were locked, and Wang Chengyao opened the suitcases. The local security officer He Runyu testified that he distributed food but did not see them robbing. At this point, Prosecutor Zhao argued that it was clear that the case was real because the refugees had banknotes and gold jewelry. He requested that the defendants be sentenced according to law. The defendant's lawyer, Hu Yuanjun, argued that the defendants had been falsely accused and demanded that they be acquitted and released so that the entire group of over two hundred people could seek food. After reviewing the evidence, the judge ordered the arguments to be concluded and sentenced on the 24th. The defendants were remanded to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Gambling with Pai Gow Nearly Costs a Life <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Gan Azeng Has Good Gambling Luck　　Guo Ziquan Is Also Ruthless. Guo Ziquan, who lives in Heilongjiang, Chengnai, was gambling with Pai Gow at home the other day. Most people lost, but Gan Azeng alone won big. Guo suspected that Gan was using improper means to cheat. Yesterday, Gan was at Lou Xinglong's house nearby when Guo gathered a group of people and went with axes to slash Gan, injuring his tendons and bones and blinding his eyes. He lay in a pool of blood. Gan's wife, Qian Jinshi, immediately reported the incident to the First Section of the Second Precinct. The police were dispatched to the scene, but everyone had fled. Lou and Guo's wife, Guo Mashi, were arrested. Gan Azeng was on the verge of death and was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.

<h3 id="e123">Joint Report by the Public Security Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, and Public Utilities Bureau on the Gaochang Temple Incident <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the incident that occurred at Gaochang Temple between workers of the Chinese Electric Tram Company and workers of the Naval Aviation Department, the Public Security Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, and Public Utilities Bureau were ordered by the Municipal Government to thoroughly investigate the situation at the time in order to clarify the truth. The investigation has now been completed, and a joint report was submitted to the mayor yesterday. The original report stated: "In response to the order from the secretary of the government, No. 1181, which instructed the bureaus to jointly investigate the conflict between the naval aviation drivers of the Naval Headquarters and the workers of the Shanghai Chinese Electric Tram Company, clarify the cause of the incident, and facilitate investigation, the Public Utilities Bureau dispatched technician Wu Jinhai, the Public Security Bureau dispatched clerk Chen Timin, and the Social Affairs Bureau dispatched investigator Zhu Guilin to the scene of the incident and various relevant places to conduct separate investigations. According to reports, the cause of the incident was that eleven workers from the Naval Aviation Department, including Zhang Likang, returned from Bansongyuan to Gaochang Temple, but the tram workers had already changed shifts. The reason for the beating is unknown. It is speculated that it may be related to the events of the day." Based on this, the tram workers in the Gaochang Temple area were beaten. According to the Zou patrol officer stationed there by the Public Security Bureau, this is a common occurrence, and not only are there no punitive measures after the tram workers are beaten, but the company often has to send free tickets. It seems that such a situation may not be a distant cause of the incident. The bureaus believe that as many as five people were injured in this incident. If no proper remedial measures are taken, the protection of tram workers will be non-existent. If there is a cycle of group fights and revenge, the consequences will be dire. In accordance with the above instructions, a copy of the investigation report and a copy of the vehicle damage list are attached. A joint report is submitted, requesting the Mayor to review and handle it for the public good. This report is drafted by the Social Affairs Bureau, and a joint statement is made for joint signature, which is inappropriate for printing separately. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Zhang.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Prohibition of Curing Diseases with Talismans <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Notice from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice stating that curing diseases with talismans not only endangers human lives but also violates legal prohibitions. The Bureau has repeatedly issued strict notices to prohibit such practices. It has recently been discovered that there are still idlers in the city who carry swords, tie yellow cloth around their waists, draw talismans, and chant incantations, claiming that they can exorcise evil spirits and cure diseases, in order to bewilder the ignorant and achieve their goals of scamming money. Strict prohibition should be enforced. This notice is hereby reissued to the public for strict compliance.</p>
<p>There must be no more violations. This is for the purpose of punishment. This notice is issued on the day of March of the twentieth year of the Republic of China. Director Chen Xizeng.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Completion of the Qingning Temple Floating Pier for City Ferries <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Officially in Use Starting Yesterday. The Qingning Temple pier for the city-run Pujiang ferries was originally a reinforced concrete structure that was ten years old. Since the new steel-hulled ferries have been in operation, its lack of elasticity has caused damage to the pier with each docking due to the surge of waves, and many cement piles have been damaged. Moreover, the fixed pier cannot rise and fall with the tide, making it inconvenient for passengers to board and disembark. In order to permanently solve this problem, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau cooperated with the Public Works Bureau to build a steel floating pier. It is reported that the project has been completed, and the city ferries began docking at the new pier yesterday (the 18th). There is a steel shed above to shelter from wind and rain, and the men's and women's restrooms all use flushing toilets. There is also a consumer cooperative where passengers can conveniently purchase sundries or exchange silver coins. It can be said to be a perfect match with the new ferries. It is reported that the cost is over 35,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Preparatory Committee Established. The residents of the Shanghai Municipal Government's civilian residences are mostly coolies and slum dwellers whose livelihoods are very difficult. Wang Zhenchang, the general manager of the residence, has realized this and provided practical training and guidance to the residents on their livelihoods. Because the coolies' lives are poor, he sought comrades to initiate the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Civilian Residence Consumers' Cooperative. The spirit of this consumer cooperative is to solve the residents' livelihoods and improve their lives. It is reported that he has been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau and has received instructions from the Bureau to urge him to quickly and comprehensively plan and provide practical guidance to seek the happiness of the residents. When he initially announced the cooperative, the residents joined the cooperative enthusiastically. It is reported that he has already obtained more than twenty founding members and established the preparatory committee of the cooperative on the 13th of this month. He selected staff and actively conducted publicity among the residents. It is also reported that the preparatory committee of the cooperative held its first standing committee meeting yesterday, attended by more than thirty members, including Liu Wanyi. The general manager of the residence explained the main points of the consumer cooperative and guided the organization of the consumer cooperative.

<h3 id="e128">YWCA Memorial Hall <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Commemorating Meritorious Women. In the memorial hall of the new YWCA building, all women who have contributed to the YWCA movement in China will be commemorated in the new building of the National Association of the YWCA on Yuanmingyuan Road, to commemorate their contributions. The woman who has made the greatest contribution to the Chinese YWCA is Ms. Gu Enci. She served as the first secretary of the Shanghai YWCA and then served as the general secretary of the National Association for many years. Her policy was to cultivate Chinese leaders to be able to undertake the work of the Chinese YWCA. She had a great foresight, and her value has become more apparent after her death. The seventh auditorium of the new building will be named Sigu Hall. All funds previously donated to commemorate Ms. Gu will be used to construct the hall. The auditorium is located in the northwest corner of the building, and its style is modeled after Chinese temples without adopting Western architecture. The teak and ceiling are also in the Chinese style. Mrs. John Bao passed away last year. The YWCA has now accepted the recommendation of Bao's donor to use the funds to purchase equipment in front of the auditorium, including offering tables, screens, and lecterns, as a memorial. In 1917, Ms. Mei Da of the United States donated funds to the YWCA's Girls' Physical Education Normal School at the time. Later, the school was merged into Jinling Women's University. In 1930, Ms. Da returned to China and greatly praised the construction of the new YWCA building and agreed to allocate the funds previously donated to the construction cost of the new building. The original intention of her previous donation was to commemorate her deceased daughter, Ms. Hamilton Da, so a monument will be erected in the new building to commemorate her permanently. Recently, Ms. Hua Jingxia's mother, Mrs. Hua, passed away in New York. Mrs. Hua served as the general secretary of the Shanghai YWCA and then devoted herself to training Chinese staff. She planned to return to China in 1928 to continue her work, but she was unable to do so due to poor health. Unexpectedly, the sad news came that Mrs. Hua had passed away in February. The association, in memory of her past efforts, will leave a memorial for Mrs. Hua in the new building.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Reassignment of the Tsinghua University President <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>New President Wu Nanxuan: Luo Jialun, President of National Tsinghua University, submitted his resignation, which was approved yesterday at the 16th State Council meeting. Wu Nanxuan was appointed as the President of Tsinghua University. The following is an exploration of the process of changing the university's president:</p>
<p>The Process of President Luo's Resignation: Since last year, Mr. Luo repeatedly submitted his resignation, but he was persuaded to stay. Later, the Central Government appointed Mr. Luo as the Director of Academic Affairs of the Central Political School and concurrently as the Acting Director of Education. Mr. Luo submitted his resignation again on January 22nd. At that time, the educational authorities believed that Mr. Luo had been working tirelessly to manage Tsinghua and actively rectify the situation, which was a fact. The government emphasized education and the rectification of academic atmosphere, and could not allow him to resign. However, since the Central Government had already decided to appoint him to an important position at the Central Political School, his determination to leave was firm. Therefore, they began to look for a successor, and on March 10th, they prepared a proposal and sent it to the Executive Yuan for submission to the State Council meeting. It happened that the meeting on that day was to commemorate the fallen soldiers, so the State Council meeting did not discuss it. It has now been formally approved by the State Council meeting yesterday. The Ministry of Education also issued an order approving Mr. Luo's resignation, as follows: "Since taking office as the President of the university, he has been dedicated to rectifying the situation, working tirelessly, and achieving remarkable results, which are highly valued. Now, according to his report, he has been ordered to preside over the academic affairs of the Central Political School and cannot go north. His request for resignation should be approved. In addition to submitting it to the State Council meeting for approval of his resignation and appointing another president to succeed him, he should be notified accordingly."</p>
<p>Selection and Brief Biography of the New President: The new president, Wu Nanxuan, who was appointed by the State Council meeting yesterday, was carefully selected and personally decided by Jiang, who also serves as the Minister. Mr. Wu's original name is [blank space] from Yizheng, Jiangsu. He holds a Bachelor of Arts, Master's degree, and Doctorate in Education from the University of California, USA. He has served as a translator in the Agricultural Department of the US government, the chief editor of the Young China Morning Post in San Francisco, USA, and a professor at Lincoln University for 18 years. In April of the 18th year, he was dispatched by the Ministry of Education to inspect education in the United States. In November of the 18th year, he returned to China and served as the Deputy Director of Academic Affairs of the Central Political School, a specialized member of the Examination Committee of the Examination Yuan, and a member of the Central Government's Committee for the Management of Students Studying Abroad. He is highly regarded for his extensive academic knowledge and experience, as well as his dedication and diligence.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Meets with Students: Students from the university elected representatives to come to Beijing to request the prompt appointment of a president. The Ministry of Education had previously telegraphed the university's school affairs meeting to inform them that the selection of the president would be decided soon and instructed them to inform the students that there was no need to come to Beijing. Later, three students from the university, Liu Hanwen, Lin Wenguang, and Wang Su, came to Beijing to personally present a document to the Ministry, stating that the government has the authority to weigh the appointment of the president of a national university, and students should focus on their studies and not interfere excessively. The students went to the Ministry a few days ago and Deputy Minister Chen explained this to the students in detail. Yesterday, Chairman Jiang also summoned the students to give them personal instructions.</p>

<p>During the sick leave period, Vice President Ding Xuxian will act on behalf of the president. A new president will be selected after the new Director of Education arrives. Anhui University President Yang Lianggong submitted his resignation to the provincial government due to repeated campus unrest and went to Shanghai for medical treatment. The provost, Chang Daozhi, is acting as president. The provincial government's 179th regular meeting on the 13th discussed Yang's resignation and decided to persuade him to stay during his medical treatment. During the period of medical leave, Vice President Ding Xuxian will temporarily act as president. It is reported that Yang still needs to resign again. The selection of a new president will be determined after the new Director of Education arrives in Anhui. At this time, no one in the Department of Education is responsible, and they have no choice but to put this major issue aside for the time being.</p>

After investigation, since the film is a performance of superstition and obscenity, violating laws and regulations, it should be banned by a general order. In addition to replying to the Nanjing Municipal Government to instruct the Social Affairs and Education Bureaus to destroy the negatives and order a separate ban, it is hereby copied and ordered to be obeyed and to instruct all subordinates to obey and strictly ban it in order to maintain morality. This order."</p>

<p>| Wuhan Sports Association initiates [blank] Set to begin preliminary competition on March 27th [blank] | Come to Shanghai to participate in the regional football competition. The Wuhan Sports Association sent a letter to the sports associations of the Central China provinces, stating: "Greetings. We recently received a notice from the Shanghai China National Sports Association stating that this year's national regional football competition is scheduled to be held in Shanghai from April 6th to 10th, urging this region to send representatives to attend on schedule. The regional football competition has been held for two sessions. Each session has representatives from South China, North China, and South China. However, this region has not been able to participate in the grand event due to various reasons. The backwardness of sports has caused this region to lose face. This year's competition Each region has sent teams to prepare for the championship competition. The details have been seen in the report [blank]. How can we in Central China be willing to lag behind for a long time, causing humiliation at home and abroad? [blank] However, the sports undertakings in this region have never had a general [blank] to preside over, so that a plate of loose sand cannot be carried out. The scope of the Wuhan Municipal Council also has no right to interfere. However, with the responsibility of promoting sports for the nation, the regional competition is not far away. [blank] The meeting will do its best to raise funds for the round trip between Shanghai and Wuhan. I have always suppressed your association's efforts in sports, but I hope that we can take on the difficult task together. I hope that you can send a football team to Wuhan for the preliminary competition from the 27th to the 29th of this month, with the winner as the base team. The weak ones in the team will be slightly eliminated and then [blank] select and supplement from other teams. All expenses before the preliminary competition will be borne by each province. In addition to separate letters, a corresponding letter is sent to you. I hope you will check and inform me in advance. Sincerely."</p>

<p>| Ratio of Twenty-Five to Thirty-One | First Final of the Men's Group between China and the United States | The United States won with 30 to 26. In this Wan Guo basketball women's group cycle, China and the United States have defeated their enemies one after another. Last night, the heroines of the two countries met in the championship final. The Chinese girls lost with a difference of six to one hundred and sixty-six points. The score was 25 to 31. The past is gone, and we will try again next spring to win back the championship. In the men's group, China eliminated the Jews, and the United States lost to Gao [blank]. In the first final of the three-game two-win system last night, the Chinese men's team, which had always been fighting hard, also suffered a defeat. The score was 26 to 30. There is still a second and third game, and there is no [blank] if we lose permanently. There is also a British women's group winning [blank], which is irrelevant to the championship. There were more than a thousand spectators, and Father Lao was at the height of his glory. The situation of the victory and defeat is described in detail below.</p>
<p>(1) The United Kingdom Defeated the Commonwealth Team (Women) Under the scrutiny of all, the British and Commonwealth women's teams first played against each other. At first, the intention was to find the Commonwealth with nineteen points, but the result was a loss of 27 to 33. The Commonwealth's defenders were too short and difficult to defend. Commonwealth center Jie Hansheng witnessed the difficulties and once retreated to defend, but his talent was not used to help the matter. The accuracy of the British's Plins sisters in shooting the basket was indeed a major factor in the victory. After the start of the game, the United Kingdom took the lead all the way. Despite all their efforts, [blank] the basket often had bad luck and the difference was a few inches. In the last few minutes, the Commonwealth fought hard, but was eventually won by the United Kingdom. Although this game was not related to the championship, the competitive spirit of the two teams was admirable.</p>

The aroma of fat and the leaping of the ball made the spirit invigorated and excited. Both teams had never failed before. This battle will determine who the championship belongs to. After dozens of rounds of hard fighting, the Chinese women lost with a difference of six points. The score was thirty-one to twenty-five.</p>
<p>Omen of Defeat After the battle order was issued, Chinese center Xi Jun [blank] ball advanced fiercely and passed to Yang Ren. The momentum was strong and majestic. Unexpectedly, Yang Ren's shot jumped out of the basket, and the sound of regret followed. The flag was opened and lost. The US women's army surged like a tide, one after another, forming a continuous human net. The Chinese record did not open, and only two points were scored in the first [blank], losing with two to ten.</p>
<p>Making Amends: It is not very important to lose in the first battle. Yang Renxi tried to kill and chase up by 6 to 10. Then Shao Jinying created a record of 9 to 12, with a difference of only three points. It is not too late to make amends. The result of the first half was 11 to 15, with the United States winning.</p>
<p>Key to Victory: After a short rest, the troops are reorganized and fought again. The United States suddenly added five points, which was a fatal injury to China. The loss in this section was too great, which can be said to be the key to success or failure. China unexpectedly fell far behind with 13 to 24. In the end, the three armies rose up and fought with all their strength, stepping up step by step. The air was tense for a while. Xi Jun scored repeatedly. However, time passed and the time limit was reached. With the sound of a silver whistle, the two teams closed their troops. The result of building the mountain nine feet short was that the United States won by thirty-one to twenty-five. The failure of the Chinese operation last night was more refined than before. It did not seem to be in a state of inevitable defeat, and [blank] Zhang was the main reason for the failure. The defense of the defender was better than before. The damage in the first and third sections was too great, affecting the vitality and could not be saved.</p>

Lu Zhongen held the ball, planning left and right to see the change of the opportunity to settle. In the blink of an eye, the Americans Haines and the Chinese Liang Guoquan tried to throw the ball, one high and one oblique, but did not enter the basket. Lu Zhongen advanced by retreating, leading the tiger away from the mountain. He went to the basket alone but did not hit and bounced out. Liang Guoquan followed and threw it into the air, beautiful and neat, with thunderous applause. After that, Bishe Po and Lu Zhongen each scored a penalty, making it three to one, with China taking the lead. At that time, both sides strictly guarded their territory and did not dare to act rashly, giving people an opportunity. After a long time of three minutes, the American center Haines got a ball. He tried to throw it far away and succeeded. Smith followed suit and scored again. Kong Guangyi flew in the field and saw the front target. He scored with both hands, making it five to five.</p>
<p>A surprising victory The United States' front players are under surveillance and it is not easy to move. Pi Lei's success was successful, and the US momentum suddenly surged. Smith and Haines successively won the ball. China suspended the war to kill the enemy. Haines took the ball well and Pi Lei entered the pass. Smith scored with one arm, and the United States took the lead by thirteen to five from a distance. Liang Guoquan and Wei Haiqing lived up to their mission and each scored a goal. The first half ended with a score of nine to thirteen behind.</p>
<p>Striving to be useful The Chinese team changed its strategy and used long shots more. Gai's winning ball was won by few close shots and many long shots. Now using poison to attack poison is quite effective. First, Liang scored a penalty, and then Liang scored a long shot, with a score difference of one point. Then Smith Bishe Po got his hand and each scored a goal. At that time, the entire Chinese army fought hard and advanced more vigorously. Liang held the skill of shooting through a hundred steps and hit two long shots one after another. The spectators were greatly excited and tried their best to cheer, hoping to turn the tide.</p>
<p>Nine mounds, one basket The turning point for China is coming. Suddenly a huge change occurred. A slight carelessness was taken advantage of by the enemy. Shi Kuiya's shot did not take long for Pi Lei to also shoot the ball into the basket. The spectators' enthusiasm was greatly disappointed. He Yan Zhang and Ouyang Yongyuan entered the court one after another but had limited power. In the last seven minutes, China spurred on its efforts, advancing in five directions. Under the mighty momentum, there was a great resurgence. Time does not stay, and the time limit has arrived. With the sound of a silver whistle, the two teams closed their troops. The result of building nine mounds of mountains was that the United States won with a score of thirty to twenty-six. Referee Zhang Guoxun and Brat</p>

<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>▲ Money is the most important thing in the world. The happiness of individuals, or the morality of countries, is based on money.</p>
<p>▲ Time is of great importance to women. A woman of twenty years old can conquer a man with just a flash in his eyes. However, after another ten years, some kind of technique must be used to internally move any man.</p>
<p>▲ You cannot determine a man's love by the heat with which he kisses his wife. However, when he refuses to kiss other women within the realm of possibility, the extent of his love can be seen.</p>
<p>▲ A woman of twenty has the beauty of innocence. If a woman of forty does not have a natural heterogeneity, her beauty is completely artificial.</p>
<p>▲ If a man can choose his girlfriend very carefully, like choosing a cigar, then the lawyers who specialize in divorce cases in the society can all starve to death.</p>
<p>▲ If the top bookstores in the country can be pragmatic and drastically reduce prices for three years, then the knowledge of the general public can be greatly improved.</p>
<p>▲ A rich man without a certain belief or without a certain profession is more dangerous than a poor woman without chastity.</p>
<p>▲ Happiness and beauty are by-products of life.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Anecdote of Clay Figure Zhang of Tianjin and G沽 <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Qinglin</p>
<p>Chinese art, thousands of years ago, discovered extraordinary skills unmatched in ancient and modern times. It is a pity that they all embraced secrecy, unwilling to make them public, especially to pass them on to those with different surnames. If the descendants are unworthy and there is no one to inherit, the art will be lost. Foreigners, on the other hand, have repeatedly inherited and adapted them, making significant inventions. This is truly regrettable. For example, in the western part of Tianjin, there was a craftsman named Zhang Mingshan who specialized in sculpting clay figures. However, his name was not widely known; people only knew his surname, so he was called Clay Figure Zhang. His skills are now lost. Although his descendants still engage in this craft, their work is unremarkable. I once recorded his sculpting methods and the figures he sculpted, detailing them in a certain newspaper. This can certainly promote the reputation of the Chinese art world. It is said that he had another anecdote, which I am now recording. It may well be a piece of historical material about a famous figure in the art world.</p>
<p>Li Hongzhang, the Governor-General of Zhili, heard of his reputation and summoned him to his office, intending to have him sculpt a clay figure of Zhang to sit opposite him. Zhang casually agreed, carefully examining Li's face for a short while, and then asked for a price of two thousand taels of gold. Li thought it was too expensive and refused. Zhang said nothing, bowed, and left. The next day, it was widely rumored that a clay statue of the Grand Secretary was displayed in Zhang's shop, its eyebrows and eyes animated, as if it were alive, with a price tag for sale. Onlookers crowded around. It turned out that Zhang had hidden clay in his sleeve when he visited Li. During the meeting, he had already sculpted Li's face and expression in his sleeve. Upon returning, he further contemplated his appearance, adding decorations and sculpting the body, arranging the clothes and headdress. Every detail was meticulously replicated. The artistry of his skill was such. Li was displeased upon hearing this, but there was nothing he could do. He quickly ordered someone to take two thousand taels of gold, go to the market, buy the statue, and place it on his desk. Every time he looked at the incarnation, he was amazed and admired it. There was a salt merchant from Changlu, a chief commissioner named Li, who also wanted Zhang to sculpt a statue of him. Zhang, known for his arrogance, said, "This Li is not that Li. Everyone knows that salt merchants are stingy. If I were to sculpt your esteemed likeness today, it would not be worth it unless you paid ten times the price of the Grand Secretary Li. Otherwise, there will be others who admire your countenance and buy it for their appreciation." Li was displeased with his disrespectful words, and angrily turned away, saying, "Tomorrow, Zhang will apply to this Li what he applied to that Li." But Li was petty and filed a lawsuit out of anger. Moreover, he was rich and arrogant, willing to sacrifice everything. He secretly bribed the officials with gold at night, and Zhang lost the lawsuit. He died in prison out of resentment.</p>

<p>▲ Soy Sauce Braised Pork: Take fresh pork, cut it into square chunks, and add pork bones. Add old broth and soy sauce, and braise over low heat for a long time. Once cooked, take it out. The taste is exceptionally rich and delicious.</p>
<p>▲ Fried Small Fish: The small fish are about an inch long, fleshy, and boneless. Commonly known as "meat-filled fish." Marinate them in sugar, vinegar, and good soy sauce in the morning. Fry them in oil in the afternoon until lightly browned. Sprinkle with a little licorice and fennel powder. They are fragrant and fresh.</p>
<p>▲ Fermented Snail: Snails have their tails snipped off, placed in a wok and stir-fried. Add fermented rice wine broth and a piece of raw lard. Cook until the flavor is very fresh and delicious.</p>
<p>▲ Fresh Broad Beans: Shell the broad beans, and stir-fry with bamboo shoot pieces. Add soy oil, soy sauce, and white sugar to the wok. Cook for two to three minutes. They are fresh, tender, and palatable.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Fish and Green Fish Stir-fry: Stir-fry silver fish and green fish with a little soy oil and soy sauce. It has a unique flavor.</p>
<p>▲ Clam Meat Stewed with Salted Fresh Meat: Dice both clam meat and salted fresh meat into small squares. Place them in a clay pot. Add a pinch of salt. Simmer over a charcoal stove until cooked. The taste is especially delicious.</p>

<p>— Shuanghong</p>
<p>The cost of living is rising daily. Compared to decades ago, today's prices are incalculable. However, prices were cheap in the past, but there were even cheaper items among them. Even recalling them now brings lingering admiration.</p>
<p>▲ Suzhou Boat Cuisine with Four Powders and Four Noodles for Ten Copper Coins: Famous far and wide. Their pastries were especially delicious. Generally, each serving consisted of four types made from flour and four types made from dough. They were called "Four Powders and Four Noodles." Once, a friend jokingly said that he could buy "Four Powders and Four Noodles" for ten copper coins. When asked how, he replied: "One copper coin for a large glutinous rice ball filled with white sugar; one copper coin for two small rice dumplings from the wine dregs vendor; one copper coin for two fried rice cakes; two copper coins for a small steamer of 'dou gao' (bean flour cake). These are the 'Four Powders.' One copper coin for a small salted cake (a small round flatbread with scallion and lard, sprinkled with sesame seeds; the taste is very good); one copper coin for two fried chestnut sticks; one copper coin for a piece of 'guo kuai' (a coarse wheat cake, lightly sprinkled with salt, the only filling food for the poor; each whole cake sells for four copper coins, cut into four pieces for retail.)" (The above four items are all available at the flatbread stalls.) At the time, I greatly admired his cleverness. Now, only fried chestnut sticks are occasionally seen, but each one costs two copper coins. The rest have all been naturally eliminated.</p>
<p>▲ Two Items Did Not Increase in Price While Everything Else Did: In the early years of the Republic, someone said that everything had increased in price except for two items. When asked what they were, he replied: "The bamboo ear picks sold by beggars still sell for one copper coin, just as they always have. The almanacs hawked in tea houses at the end of the year still sell for three or four copper coins for the cheapest ones. Haven't these two items not increased in price?" Now, the old-style almanacs are gone, and even a bamboo ear pick costs two copper coins.</p>
<p>Other items, such as one egg, formerly sold for four or five copper coins; braised pork in soy sauce from Lu Gaojian, each piece selling for seven copper coins; and a large bowl of stir-fried fish and braised meat, selling for twenty-four copper coins, were all cheap and delicious. Now, all of these have increased tenfold or so. How can families of moderate means and below not lament the difficulty of making ends meet?</p>
<h3 id="e166">Scraps from the Military Medical Conference <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Huizi</p>
<p>The national army hospital directors' conference convened by the Ministry of War is a preliminary step towards the military medical conference. This conference will prepare various proposals to be solemnly resolved at the national military medical conference. Major issues such as the treatment of wounded and sick soldiers, the revision of military medical personnel, the replenishment of medical equipment, and the statistics of wounded and sick soldiers must be thoroughly planned and resolved.</p>
<p>The conference lasted four days and resolved no fewer than fifty important cases. However, the first step is to raise a sum of money. For example, building hospitals, purchasing X-ray machines, and improving food supplies all require money. However, the national treasury is currently tight, and all expenses are being reduced. Where can we find extra funds to improve and develop? This cannot be compared with the newly established Military Medical Supervisory Department, which has full access to funds. It is said that the department's planned model military hospital requires only 1.3 million yuan in start-up costs, compared with the 3,000 yuan start-up costs for each military hospital established by the Ministry of War. This is like a small sorcerer seeing a great wizard, an immeasurable difference.</p>
<p>The Central Hospital in the capital, formerly known as the Model Central Hospital, is the largest in scale among all public and private hospitals in Beijing. The head nurse's salary is over 200 yuan. As for the salaries of doctors in various departments, only the Minister and Vice Minister of the Ministry of War can compare. The Vice Minister is a lieutenant general and earns only 500 yuan per month, while the doctors in the hospital earn up to 600 yuan per month. However, their achievements over the past year have been mediocre. Last year, when wounded soldiers were crowded, the Ministry of War's hospitals accommodated up to 50,000 wounded soldiers, with a total monthly expenditure of only 300,000 yuan. The Central Hospital only accommodated 300 wounded soldiers, but its monthly expenditure was 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The attendees of this military medical conference were the directors of army hospitals from all over the country, a total of eighteen people. In terms of province of origin, Zhejiang was the most numerous. In terms of educational background, graduates of military medical schools accounted for one-third. However, one common point was that they were all German- or Japanese-trained medical scholars. Chief Secretary Jiang Qiuran first graduated from the Japanese Military Academy and then transferred to the Japanese Chiba Medical College, so he deserves to be a veteran expert in both military and medical affairs. The three heroes of the military medical community refer to Jiang, Hao Zihua, and Liu Jixiong. The conference secretaries, Wu Yubai and Yang Buping, are both well-known in the military medical community. The attendees of this conference are all leading figures in the military medical community, known as the "Eighteen Scholars, Four Talents, and Eight Sages." The "Eighteen Scholars" refer to the eighteen hospital directors who attended the conference. Wu and Yang are both figures among the "Four Talents and Eight Sages." Unfortunately, as an outsider, I did not inquire about the details from insiders and record them in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Variations on Monkey's Opium Addiction <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xufan</p>
<p>The harm of opium is known to everyone. All animals seem to be easily addicted, but what happens to their internal organs? Everyone seems to be able to describe the details. When Ma Lianjia was the Governor of Anhui, the opium ban was greatly relaxed. Residents in northern Anhui, such as Hao and Wo, almost could not live without opium. There was no family without opium. There were even female beggars who begged for opium dregs instead of food. At that time, I was in Zhengyang and saw a monkey sentenced to death for opium addiction. It was quite amusing, so I recorded the true story.</p>
<p>Zhengyangguan belongs to Shouxian County, a large town in northern Anhui. There was a man named Shi in the town, who was moderately wealthy and had a severe opium addiction. He kept a male monkey that was very clever. Whenever Shi lay down on an opium couch, the monkey would be with him. Occasionally, when Shi went to the opium den, the monkey would follow. One day, Shi went to the countryside for business and left the monkey at home. He did not return for one night. The next afternoon, the monkey could not bear it any longer and ran to the opium den. It placed a silver coin on the couch and cried wildly. The opium den owner knew it was Shi's monkey and was surprised. He tried to give it opium smoke. The monkey gladly accepted it. The owner gave it several puffs, and the monkey was overjoyed. It secretly returned home, and the family did not know. This went on for three days. The opium addicts regarded the monkey as a comrade. On the third day, while the monkey was receiving the opium smoke, the owner suddenly arrived. The monkey was shocked to see him and turned away and fled. The opium den owner told Shi the truth. Shi was furious. He checked his pillow and found three silver coins missing, knowing that the monkey had stolen them. The monkey was afraid of causing trouble and hid all day. Shi thought that the monkey had become addicted to opium and was now acting like a thief on the roof. Its cleverness was endearing, but its behavior was unacceptable. Afraid that it would cause unexpected trouble in the future, Shi took a sharp knife the next day and stabbed the monkey to death unexpectedly. He then took the monkey's internal organs and hung them on a tree to observe any changes. After a while, he gradually saw the surface of the lungs wriggling, as if ants were gathering. It was difficult to discern what was happening. Shi blew several puffs of opium smoke on it, and the wriggling gradually stopped. The neighbors gathered to watch, and it became a popular story. My residence was very close to Shi's house. After witnessing this, I intended to take the monkey's organs back to study them, but because the town was a remote mountain village, there was no scientific hospital, so I abandoned the idea. Monkeys are intelligent animals, and their blood vessels and bones are not very different from those of humans. They can be addicted to the same habits as humans. When opium poisons humans, does it cause the same changes? I cannot help but worry about this.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: The Art of Preserving Youth: Emeralds and Black Ink Mix in Her Brows; The Way to Extend Life is Unavailable: Golden Market with Fine Horses</p>
<p>The first person to know was Gai Yutang. He and Pan's grandmother's husband were in the same business. As the saying goes, "One who is near the water gets the moon first." He ran to Pan's house and cried loudly, showing his straightforward nature of a Northerner. Pan's grandmother said, "Now that the person is dead, can crying bring him back to life? However, you should understand why Old Six couldn't stay in Shanghai and had to travel all the way to Beijing. You should understand that." Gai Yutang said, "This is our fault, but Old Six is like a wild horse, and no one can tie him down. You know that." Later, the carriage owner, A Sen, also learned the news. Pan's grandmother also blamed him in the same way. She said, "Although a person's life is destined, if Old Six had died in Shanghai, he would have had many relatives by his side. It wouldn't be like dying alone in a foreign land." A Sen also bowed his head in silence. When Hua Lao Liu's coffin was transported from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Shanghai, both of them received the news. Gai Yutang said, "When he was alive, I was sorry for him. After death, it should be my responsibility." A Sen said, "No. Old Six's coffin should be my responsibility. I have a piece of land in Jiangwan. I can bury him there." Gai Yutang said, "I will not return to the North in the future. I can buy a piece of land and bury him properly. Now his coffin is temporarily placed in the guild hall. I will pay for the coffin's storage." A Sen said, "I knew him first. Naturally, it is up to me to take care of his coffin." The two argued endlessly. Pan's grandmother said, "What are you arguing about now as if it were a big deal? You both wanted to take advantage of him in the first place. When he went to Beijing, you didn't come out to help him. Moreover, if it weren't for the two of you, why would he have had to go to Beijing? Now that someone has bought a coffin for him and transported it to the South, you want to be good people. People will say that you have a conscience towards Hua Lao Liu. Touch your own conscience. Now I will take charge for the deceased. I don't want either of you to interfere. We are from Changshu. She and I were good sisters. I will transport her coffin back to Changshu. I have a piece of vacant land there. I will bury her there. You don't need to worry about it. You are happy for a moment, but I am afraid that you will leave it in the guild hall and not even visit her grave. In Changshu, when I go to sweep the grave, I will burn some paper money in front of her grave." Later, Pan's grandmother indeed transported Hua Yuanchun's coffin back to Changshu for burial. This concluded the matter of Hua Yuanchun. Green Ripple could not know these details. Later, someone told Zuo Shichen, who then passed it on. The women in the brothels were originally good daughters, but the evil society led them to the abyss of depravity. It is unknown how many have lost their youth. It is precisely:</p>
<p>Mountain flowers eat away at the bones of beautiful women,</p>
<p>A wild burial bewilders the souls of wandering sons.</p>
<p>How will the matter unfold? Listen to the next chapter for the resolution.</p>
<p>Announcement: "Warmth in the Heart" will be temporarily suspended. The travel notes of Mr. Liu Linghua to India will be published soon. Please pay attention. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Financial and Gold Market Ending Weak <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Falling Twelve Taels Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, March 18th, the gold price rose and fell. The market situation was uncertain, with fluctuations of ten taels. The total market difference was twenty-four or five taels, eventually falling twelve taels. The foreign exchange turned good, and the listed prices shrank by one level, reflecting a situation of tight external conditions but relaxed internal conditions. There were significant differences in market trading compared to the previous market. Companies like Yuanmao and Shuiyuan Sheng bought in, while Zhifeng, Yongchang, Yu Yongheng, and others sold. Although the overseas silver market fell, it was not affected. The gold price was initially stable, but the buying surged, and the exchange rate was also good, causing a sudden increase of ten taels to six hundred ninety-seven or eight taels. The subsequent fluctuations were severe, hovering around ninety taels. Later, as the exchange rate declined, it plunged sharply, breaking through eighty taels. Since the market will be closed on Wednesday, the situation is relatively stable, with only four or five taels of fluctuations. The final calculation seems to be six hundred seventy-five taels. It is said that today's major trends may not be too volatile.</p>
<p>Once Struggling in the Morning</p>
<p>The opening price for May this morning was six hundred eighty-seven taels and five mace, the same as the closing price last night. The main price only fell by one-quarter of a mace. The silver price fell by one cent, and the private telegrams fell by eight-sevenths of a cent. The people's confidence was stable. There were three or four taels of fluctuation from ninety-two taels to eighty-eight taels. There were buyers, especially for British gold. First, Sanlin bought June's at 14125, then the British and Japanese banks traded at 140625. Zhejiang once bought at 13.9375. The people's confidence was boosted, and the price soared by eight or nine taels to ninety-seven taels and eight mace at twenty minutes past nine. Shortly after, Shunli and Wanyu and others came to sell. In a short time, it fell by six taels. When the first order was announced, the listed price was ninety-two taels. Although the hanging price was reduced by two-five U.S. dollars and five jiao, the Japanese gold added two fen and two-five, the public was not convinced, and the price was suppressed by one tael. But it was immediately increased to ninety-three taels and five mace for retail buyers. Fuchang and others came to sell in an instant. From forty minutes to fifty minutes past nine, the price plummeted by more than nine taels to eighty-four taels because the exchange rate was not easy to sell. Then, Yuanheng, Hengyu, and others bought in, and the banks traded five or six months of British gold at 140625, and it was ninety-three taels and five mace again at ten o'clock. Suddenly, there was another sign of weakness, which was sold by Tong Taichang, Hengxing, Yuan, and other items. So at half past ten, it fell back to eighty-five taels and immediately jumped up five or six taels. Wanxing, Shunli, Yuancheng, and Yonglai bought in at forty minutes past ten to ninety taels. Afterwards, the fatigue was fully revealed. The British gold was even sold off. The Chinese and Japanese banks traded six months of U.S. dollars at thirty-two yuan and seventy-five. Sumitomo bought May's British gold at 1425, then 25 could be settled, and the selling wind in the field became more intense. Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Fuxing, Yongyu, and others all sold. From the third quarter to the third quarter past eleven, the price fell by sixteen taels in one hour, only seventy-five taels, and then added to seven and a half taels. At noon, the market closed at seventy-six taels, and the announced price was changed to seven hundred forty-five taels and eight mace. It is estimated that it was suppressed by fifty-five taels to fifty-two or three taels at noon and seventy taels.</p>
<p>Depressed After Market</p>
<p>The market opened at seventy-five taels and five mace in the afternoon. Later, because the Indian exchange rate was seen to fall by three or four Anna, it rose to seventy-eight taels and eight or nine mace, and immediately fell back to seventy-three taels and two or three mace. Because the Indian exchange rate was reported to have risen by six Anna, Yuanmao Yong and others came in and added to seven and a half taels. At the third quarter past two, it returned to five and a half taels. In fact, the people's minds were distracted and swayed with the wind. After three o'clock, it was suddenly heard that the Indian exchange rate had plummeted. In an instant, it rose by five taels to eighty-one taels and eight mace, because Dalian Gang suddenly let go and bought. After learning that the rumor had been refuted and had been depreciated by three taels, it was estimated at seventy-nine taels. Later, Xinhang bought in and added to eighty taels. In an instant, it dropped by more than three taels. It is estimated that the Indian exchange rate was indeed three Anna, estimated at seventy-six taels and five o'clock. There was a slight head start, and it was seventy-nine taels at half past four o'clock, and the market closed at the softening state, estimated at seventy-five taels and eight mace. In short, the people's minds were still hesitant. If there were more sellers, it seemed that the lower reaches were more compared to the previous day, and it fell eleven taels and seven mace. The largest price in one day was fifty-seven taels and eight mace, and the smallest price was seventy-three taels and two mace, with twenty-four taels and six mace of twists and turns. It can also be said to be huge. The price of goods was ninety taels in the morning and seventy-six taels and five mace at noon. The market closed at seventy-six taels in the afternoon, and the announced price was still pressed seventy taels. The registered prices were sixty-nine taels for the March market, seventy-two taels for the April market, and seventy-six taels for the May market. The back market was not registered, and the entire day was sixty-nine taels.</p>
<p>Different Purposes among Industries</p>
<p>The numbers that are easy to calculate are Yuanmao Yong, Yuancheng, Xinhang, Tong Taichang, Qianchangxiang, and Futaiheng. They are all uniformly advancing smoothly, Wanxing, Yuantai, Chengfeng Yong, and Dadecheng. Zhifeng, Yongfu Yu, Hengxing, and Hengyu are all departing. In the afternoon, Chengfeng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, Qianchangxiang, and Xinhang are all advancing. Tong Taichang, Yuantai, Dehe, and Dadecheng are sometimes out. Zhifeng, Yongfutaiheng, and Hengyu are all departing. The items are advancing and retreating in a complicated manner. The Dalian Gang had a total of two thousand seven hundred eighty to eight hundred tickets in the morning market, and a total of one thousand two hundred thirty to three hundred tickets in the afternoon, and five to six hundred tickets were issued. A small number of Guangdong Gang were issued, and it is said that it was people.</p>

<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the downward trend is becoming more severe. Daily fluctuations are very rapid, completely influenced by the financial turmoil. Additionally, demand for spot yarn is weak, but the prices of three types of yarn from overseas are high, making silver purchases expensive. Therefore, export transactions of 20-count "Ren Zhong" (brand) yarn to Japan continue unabated. Today, another 600 bales were sold at a price of 114 Japanese yen. Local Shanghai yarn shipments to Japan, paid in local currency, are even larger. Some manufacturers maintain a strong stance, adhering to a policy of buying on dips. However, most in the market believe that with 3,000 bales of spot goods entering warehouses this month and sluggish actual sales, a decline is inevitable.</p>
<p>"Ren Biao" (brand) down 2.7 taels. The "Ren Biao" market opened with weakened sentiment due to falling American cotton prices. The atmosphere was tense, with each decline of 5-6 qian. In the second and third rounds, due to the poor financial market, market sentiment softened further, with each decline of 1.15 taels. In the afternoon, the market situation worsened, with a lack of buyers. Each decline was 1.2, 4, or 5 qian. Total daily transactions amounted to 2,200 bales. Sold: Tongyu 1,300 bales, Tianlong 650 bales, Gengyu 1,050 bales, Daji 750 bales. Bought: Gongtai 1,150 bales, Shenxin 550 bales, Yukang 650 bales, Yuanfeng 600 bales. The closing prices are recorded below: "Ren Biao" closing prices, changes, and account balances.</p>

<p>"Ren Zhong" yarn shipped to Japan. Spot yarn sales are mediocre. According to statistics from various guilds, 750 bales were husbanded, with 550 bales entering the same trade. 600 bales of "Ren" yarn were shipped to Japan at a price of 114 Japanese yen. Guest guilds brought in 200 bales from the mainland, 90 bales from Jiangxi, 25 bales from Sichuan, and 120 bales from miscellaneous guilds. Yesterday, 800 bales of 20-count "Ren Zhong" yarn were shipped to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Cotton Market Suddenly Exhibits Plummeting Signs <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market has experienced a sharp decline. The recent rapid changes are influenced by gold prices. Consequently, people's minds are unsettled, and they are in a state of confusion. Furthermore, the overseas cotton market is also unstable. The slightest rumor amplifies the changes. The current situation is such that as soon as sellers offer 40 taels, numerous external sales emerge. Japanese trading company "Dong Mian" (brand) inevitably sells when prices are high, gradually adopting a lower course. The front and back markets have settled a significant portion of the bull positions, resulting in a particularly sluggish spot market.</p>
<p>"Han Biao" (brand) selling is extremely prevalent. The "Han Biao" market opened with falling American cotton and rising Indian cotton. The market saw fewer buyers, with declines of 4-5 qian in various months. In the second and third rounds, upon hearing news of a weak gold market, the result was declines of 5, 6, and 8 qian. In the afternoon, with further declines in gold prices, selling pressure intensified, with declines of 4, 5, and 7 qian in various months. Total daily transactions amounted to 63,700 dan. Sold: Yu Da 5,800 dan, Tai 5,000 dan, Rongxing 2,700 dan, Shen Da 2,700 dan, Deji 3,200 dan. Bought: Da Fu 2,000 dan, 2,000 dan, Yuantai 2,300 dan, Maifeng 2,800 dan. The closing prices are recorded below: "Han Biao" closing prices, changes, and open interest.</p>
<p>| Month | Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>

<p>| April | 390.4 | Down 1.25 | 63,800 |</p>
<p>| July | 390.0 | Down 1.40 | 80,200 |</p>
<p>Spot trading is extremely quiet. Spot cotton transactions remain quiet. The source of supply is estimated at 110 bales of Tonghua cotton. American cotton is priced at 44.00. Yong'an Factory brings in 400 pieces, spot goods are delivered to the factory.</p>

Futures fell 17-19 points, and spot fell 20 points. British cotton futures rose 5 points, and spot rose 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose 20 points.

<h3 id="e177">Grain and Rice Market Continues to Rise <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the mainland source of supply was around the 20th to 30th, with sales on this street brisk in the morning and stagnant in the afternoon. White japonica rice from the northern gang initially saw a rise of about 2 jiao, but later, as the appetite of the shops weakened, prices slightly leveled off. The result was still good, exceeding 1 jiao. The activity of Bo Dao Fu Hua was still dwindling. Large volumes also rose by 1 jiao. Yang Du Xian and Bu Xian (types of rice) remained consistently stable, with prices high and tight. The sale of Second Class Bian Yin Yuan (currency) was particularly brisk, but these were scattered transactions, so the market rose only slightly, approaching a chi. It is observed that the closing trend seems to be turning flat.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, ships arrived from various routes, and sales remained active. Chang Xi North Japonica moved up by 1 or 2 jiao, and the market sentiment was very strong. Su Tong white japonica also saw brisk sales with minimal discounts. Furthermore, customers reported tight production information and offered sales, so large volumes continued to improve by 2 chi. Arrivals of early Bo Dao rice on the south road remained limited, and customer sales were still good. The market rose another half jiao. Yang Du Jian's situation seemed tight, but prices only rose slightly because this commodity was rare and transactions were slow. White yuan had a particularly volatile market. Restaurants and catering services selectively purchased high-quality rice, and prices improved by nearly 1 jiao. The rice situation here was more active than in the Zhabei area. However, since Zhabei's afternoon market turned sluggish, today's opening may also tend to flatten, which would not be surprising.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Flour Market in a Wavering State <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the morning opening of the flour market, the market in each month once presented a profitable image. Although the quotation of foreign wheat saw a small decrease, the exchange rate had been shortened by a few points after the gold price continued to rise the day before. It seems that the subscription for foreign goods does not affect the enthusiasm of buyers inside and outside the industry. Fourth and fifth months reached 6 cents, sixth, seventh, and eighth months reached 3 cents. Spin manufacturers continued to produce, and then returned to production. By the time the afternoon market opened, the gold price had weakened again, and people's minds were slightly empty. However, the inner customers' minds were still very high, so it showed a tired and stable image. After observing the pace, it is feared that it must be temporarily presented. As a result, the month is two and a half times larger than the previous day. The April is unchanged. The May is 5 smaller, the June is 7.5 smaller, and the July and August are 5 smaller.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Wheat Futures Market Rises and Falls Slightly <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures market: After the opening of the market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month showed a sense of volatility. Because the foreign offer was small, the gold price rebounded a lot from the lowest, and there were few opportunities for both buyers and sellers to use. Although dealers continued to order foreign goods, the general opinion seemed to be that they should raise prices before hedging, so the entry and exit of each market was small. However, according to recent trends, the amount of chips is so abundant, and the manufacturers themselves have a large number of incumbents. If the sales of flour cannot be raised in the future, it will be enough to worry about. As a result, the month is one point better than the previous day. April is a small two-cent, May is a small one-cent, June is a big one-cent, and August is a small two-cent.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Sugar Market: Five Blessings Ice Opens Down Two Qian <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>

The price of September and December was increased by three points. The Java sugar market did not rise or fall. Association market. The market for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sugar has become more sluggish. Although some transactions were made at a market price of 10 taels, the market shape was flat and tired. There were even fewer inquiries for No. 20 medium white sand, which was shouted at 9 taels and 6 qian. The import and export of Japanese sugar is still languid. The initial market for 007 points per half YT mark and 9 points, the TK mark 9 points, YP mark shouted 10 points 01 qian, and the buying intention was particularly weak. The market was sluggish. The N mark initially drew 10 points 07 qian and later fell to 10 points. The YRO mark was 9 points and 5 qian, the TK mark was 9 points and 9 points 7.5 qian, the YT mark was 9 points and 9 points, the YP mark was 10 points and 01 qian. The trend was flat. The Zhejiang customer gangs slightly improved their interest in trading, but the number of disk transactions was still scarce. The domestic product Wufu ice opened 70 boxes with a price of 8 taels and 8 qian, which was a fall of two points compared to the previous board, and the market shape was also weak. The price for the unified hand ice was 7 taels and 7 qian to 8 qian, and there was a lack of human inquiry.</p>

<p>In recent days, the Pitou market has fluctuated entirely with the gold market. Yesterday morning, due to the strong gold price, traders' minds were slightly higher, and in the afternoon, it was seen that the downstream market caused the market to soften again. The fine points, chirps, straight tribute, and straight satin of Donghuo were all doing the weather. However, the Anton Dalian two gangs shipped more than 100 pieces of fine chirps, straight tribute, and Yang Hongbiao. Because this gang can recover tax refunds, it is still very valuable to add to the office in Shanghai. However, the Jinbang gang turned out to be gray and sloping, which had been sold in the previous year, have been sold in recent days. The Sichuan gang remained unmoved, and the Changjiang gang, although there were purchases, the number was not many. After falling for days, the sales on this street became more active. Yesterday, Huabu, Fine Chirp, and Clean Cloth were all purchased. Among the goods, Yuanguang Oblique was the hardest, and the road was also the most vigilant. It is feared that the factory's need for foreign exchange will increase from 6 taels and 6.5 qian to 6 taels and 7.5 qian for the transfer of the crown prince. Huabu, Yuanyu Silk, and Zhongshan ne have fallen by fourteen pounds. Fine cloth has shown a sharp decline. Yueyan sells 9 taels and 3.5 qian, and signalmen sold 9 taels and 4.5 qian. Thick cotton law, which was once out of stock, has now arrived in Shanghai one after another, Dadafei color is three qian three points, and Dharma white is three qian one point.</p>

<p>Hardware transactions are very idle recently, because the customer gangs Xiong Dazong office and the manufacturers have no entry, so the market trend is very clear. However, due to the recent decline in the first order, the price of goods can still be maintained. For example, the French nail was sold for 9 taels and 2.5 qian yesterday. The transactions were only embellished by the Yangtze River and Fujian two gangs. Qing lead opened at 17 taels and 2.5 qian. There were not many transactions. However, No. 26 Japanese iron tiles, such as Qingdao Shandong and this street gang, had purchased, so the sales were active.

It is heard that 600 or 700 tranches of black iron sheets of 36 feet have been opened, and all gangs have inquired. The market is better, and 26 feet have no transaction price. The price is only 12 taels and 2.5 qian, which is 2.5 qian lower than before. The buying and selling of tinplate is also not much, but the market has not changed. For other things such as tin white lead skin, garden lead wire, green silk cloth, etc., in addition to scattered openings, there are large-scale businesses.

<p>-- Yang Yanhe</p>
<p>▲ To Mr. Liu Runsheng Jiu, the treatment method for nasal congestion is as follows: 1. Every morning, use finely ground edible salt to brush your teeth, spit it into your hand, and wash your face, paying close attention to rubbing the nasal area for a long time. This is effective. 2. Grind one tael of gardenia seeds into a fine powder, melt yellow wax into pills the size of parasol seeds, and take ten or twenty pills with clear tea after dinner. 3. Grind two qian of realgar, eight fen of alum, two qian of sulfur, eight fen of frankincense, two qian of almonds, one qian of rhubarb, seven qian of borax, four fen of light powder, and one qian of copper wire into a fine powder, mix with honey and wine, apply it to the affected area before going to bed, and wash it off the next morning. Do not interrupt the treatment.</p>
<p>▲ To Mr. Zhu Jingnian, for hemorrhoids without pain or itching, only bleeding, Chuan Gui pills are the main treatment. In addition, sprinkling with dried hemorrhoid powder should promote recovery.</p>
<p>▲ To Mr. Li Yiyi, abdominal pain that lessens after eating and is relieved by hand pressure indicates cold. Pain that worsens after eating and is also worsened by pressing indicates food accumulation. Dizziness with a stringy and slippery pulse indicates phlegm accumulation. A hot feeling in the abdomen that makes it impossible to touch indicates accumulated heat. Heavy lifting, strenuous effort, or accidental injuries indicate blood stasis. A lump in the abdomen that disappears upon pressing, with spider veins on the surface, indicates worm infestation. Treatment should be tailored to the specific condition and cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>▲ To Mr. Wu Xinfa, this condition requires emphasis on recuperation and cannot solely rely on medication. You can take 50 cypress heart-nourishing pills with longan soup on alternate evenings, and 3 qian of Jinggong Miaoxiang powder mixed with boiled water on the other evenings. As for the marriage issue, it should be done when the time is right. If circumstances limit it, delaying it slightly is also acceptable, but maintaining a clear mind and enduring hardship will naturally reduce desires.</p>
<p>▲ Note: Those asking about illness can directly write to Yang Yanhe, a medical doctor at No. 80 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road, and attach postage for a special reply. This publication will not collect the mail on behalf of you.</p>

<h3 id="e185">That Landlord <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Mr. Xiao</p>
<p>Several friends who used to gather together have now scattered due to various circumstances.</p>
<p>Reuniting with Mr. Hua and Mr. Xi in Shanghai brought an extraordinary joy to Xiao's heart, like a spring tide overflowing.</p>
<p>Xiao was a young man who had just come from the interior. His travel expenses were limited, and he was unfamiliar with the people and the place, all of which made him frown. Moreover, Shanghai was a dividing line between heaven and hell. Without money, one was fully qualified to be among the starving. This terror gradually eroded Xiao's heart. Besides finding friends, there was no other way for this person to go. So, after staying in the inn for a day, Xiao planned for the whole day, waiting until the afternoon to see that the rain had stopped before going out. The sky was gloomy, and the road was wet. To avoid any inconvenience, he immediately got into a rickshaw.</p>
<p>Soon, the journey shortened with time. Young Xiao met Mr. Hua on the second floor where he lived. The upstairs was full of books, dominated entirely by humor. Although five or three people were sitting separately at their respective tables, the only sound was the scratching of Hua's pen on paper. Xiao took off his hat and came in. Because he was wearing rubber-soled shoes, the rustling of his footsteps was also muffled. At this moment, Hua's wife suddenly turned her head from the mirror and saw Xiao.</p>
<p>After they exchanged greetings in a dialect, Hua raised his deeply nearsighted eyes from the desk and suddenly stood up.</p>
<p>The room was naturally filled with laughter. Xiao, who could not bear loneliness, burst out laughing loudly. It seemed that all the words he wanted to say were expressed in laughter. Everyone looked at each other's faces, and everyone felt the joy of reunion.</p>
<p>"Absence is a mirror," Hua said. Xiao's emaciated appearance aroused some sadness in the young Xiao's heart. But their questions to Xiao did not stop because Xiao was touching and pressing his cheeks with his hands. They continued to ask:</p>
<p>"Xiao, it's good that you could come resolutely this time."</p>
<p>"If I hadn't come, there would have been no way to think about it at home."</p>
<p>"Then your family is still managed by your mother?"</p>
<p>Yes, this young Xiao gave his mother only a home and not a penny. Even his own travel expenses were all included in the family expenses. From then on, the family's situation was unimaginable. There were many, many shortcomings and many hardships placed on her. Could this sorrow find a resting place in Xiao's heart? It was always like a burst of storms, forever unable to wash away the mud on the road. Well, young Xiao was already approaching middle age. From another perspective, he was using his parents' money to do things without knowing the hardships of the world. Understanding was like being a fool. Only then could one be considered young. Xiao's thoughtfulness was a special gift from heaven. Others did not need such cleverness. Others were rich and could use money to buy obedience and cover up their faults. But for Xiao, it was very different. He used to fret over petty things as a small clerk for a few tens of dollars, watching people's faces. He did not lack the good character that a clerk should have. It would not do to ask such a person to wave flags and shout for revolution. People looking at him seemed to think he was solemn and rigorous, like a clerk talking to his superior. At first glance, people suspected that he was deliberately being restrained. Sometimes, his wild laughter was an exception. After a long time of not seeing Xiao, his friend Mr. Hua saw that he seemed to have become two different people. This young man, who was not what he seemed, had changed too quickly and too suddenly. So, seeing him again actually increased a faint sadness. In Hua's keen eyes, he could see some of the unspoken sadness. They borrowed cigarettes, looking at the smoke they exhaled spinning around. Xiao also looked at Hua's father, as if he had gained something.</p>
<p>This was an old man who still did not forget to shave despite his age. They often met in the provincial capital. Here, his face was fuller, and he looked better than before. This was what Xiao saw, so he asked him how many bowls of rice he ate every day. Being so plump and fair was related to his appetite. When the young Xiao sat down at the dinner table, seeing all the meat and fish was of no use. He secretly sighed at his own appetite. This kind of person seemed to want to become an immortal. Immortals do not eat worldly food. This dinner was equivalent to his midnight snack.</p>
<p>After finishing dinner, he tiptoed to the window and stood there blankly, as if recalling something. Seeing that it was completely dark outside, he remembered the time. Therefore, he shouted that he wanted to go back to the inn. Hua's wife brought an orange behind him and told him to sit down, insisting that he stay for a while. Hua still had a manuscript to finish and wanted to show it to him. Only then did he win back the heart of this person who insisted on leaving. He casually flipped through a book on the bookshelf. The words on the book were still blurry, like reading a newspaper, picking and choosing articles to read. In the midst of speaking, he read the entire thing to Hua for his creation.</p>
<p>Hua's wife was an extremely good person. She had been busy all day preparing the dishes for Xiao to eat. She also grabbed handfuls of melon seeds from the drawer and piled them on the table for Xiao to eat. Xiao, because he had something on his mind, did not smoke. He cracked the melon seeds one by one from his mouth and threw the kernels on the ground. He remained silent, close to a silent demeanor. In the silence, there were things that were not silent. At this time, the landlord downstairs seemed to be arguing over a small matter, deliberately making noise for the writers upstairs to hear. They loudly scolded, calling out to both men and women, unwilling to let go. It seemed very sad. If the writer could capture them in a novel at another time, their story would be hilariously funny. Because he was in the middle of writing a story and was stuck on the central part, he frowned and thought, regardless. It was not easy to complete his own 5,000-word creation. He lengthened his face, feeling that there were many trivial matters between husband and wife and that they were difficult to handle. For example, the man had a bad temper. When he encountered something slightly unsatisfactory, he would smash bowls and throw pots. Could the woman use gentleness to ease the situation? Hua's wife was quite aware of this kind of thing. Before he could speak, she laughed out loud. This laughter was laughing at that landlord with a crowd of children. He had drunk too much wine and walked in staggering from outside. The woman who opened the door was patted on the shoulder by the man, as if he wanted to make up for all the unrestrained and outrageous behavior outside on her. With a mouthful of wine, the round face covered in fragrant powder would naturally dodge away, using all kinds of shields to resist. The man became annoyed. The man seemed like a lion, jumping and roaring for a while. The other party's policy seemed to unintentionally subdue the furious person. In a matter of tens of minutes, such a big and unclear change could occur. For those whose policy had already taken effect, even if the man had thrown a tantrum, saying this was not okay and that was not okay, the woman only needed to grab her man's weakness and show him a little bit of affection, catering to his preferences. For a husband who saw his wife doing this, he would not want to stop and would stop. A heart of love would naturally follow the act of apologizing, taking root and sprouting. In the end, the couple was still whispering and talking about things that others could not hear.</p>
<p>Originally, when a couple quarreled and sulked, once they slept in bed, they would reconcile without the need for outsiders to mediate. There were many such things.</p>
<p>Therefore, the writer upstairs seemed to put down his pen, waiting for the rain to pass before starting to work again. He was very similar in demeanor. He did not speak or laugh. The downstairs was so quiet that he could hear the mice squeaking and fighting. The story that the writer was writing continued to be completed. He read it to Xiao while tapping his foot on the floor, making a rhythmic sound. A day and a night's work was compensated by the fee for these 5,000 words. Xiao and everyone exhaled a sigh of relief, indicating that this matter was resolved and that everyone should return to their beds and have some husbandly dreams. But suddenly, he remembered that he could not find his wife here. A thin bedding was still left in the inn. There was no need to say that he wanted to go back. The writer also understood. The writer looked at the stacks of manuscript paper he had written and then looked at the bed with the low-hanging curtains. His wife was sleeping there alone, waiting. It would not be too presumptuous to say "waiting," would it? Being inseparable was what a good couple should be like. It seemed that it should be so. The two of them were especially close and intimate. Because he was afraid of delaying his friend's affairs, Xiao quietly left.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Toothache <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Siyong</p>
<p>I, who had never suffered from toothache, was once confronted by facts that did not prevent this small disease from causing people so much pain.</p>
<p>A few days ago, this tooth was already aching faintly, but I did not feel any inconvenience when eating. Who knew that the pain would gradually increase around ten o'clock last night. Later, it became tighter and tighter, and I could no longer continue writing. I put down my pen and went to bed, but how could I fall asleep? Turning this way, turning that way, lying on my back, lying on my stomach - I tried all possible sleeping positions, but I still could not fall asleep. The more I could not fall asleep, the more severe the pain became. The more severe the pain became, the more I could not fall asleep. While tossing and turning, the roosters crowed in the distance. I got up from the bed, and the window screen revealed the light of dawn. The cold air of the severe winter threatened me, and I slipped back into bed, opening my eyes to watch the sky slowly brighten.</p>
<p>Later, I was truly exhausted and fell into a hazy sleep. But soon I was awakened by the pain. After waking up from the pain, I changed my body position. Later, I fell asleep again, but I was awakened by the pain again. This entire body, eager for rest, seemed to be dominated by a small aching tooth. One foot entered the dream, and the other followed. It dragged and pulled it out of the dream. One escaped, and the other chased. I don't know how many times this happened.</p>
<p>The clock struck ten, and the pain had not diminished slightly. The clock struck eleven, and it was still the same. When the mouth covered the left cheek, I could hear the thumping sound of the pain. I was too lazy to get up and lay there like death.</p>
<p>"Siyong, are you awake? Let me see."</p>
<p>Mother sat on the edge of my bed and leaned her head in to look at my face.</p>
<p>Afterward, Mother prepared a bowl of salt water, saying that it was the most effective medicine for toothache. She took a spoonful and poured it into my mouth, teaching me to tilt my head back so that the salt water would completely pour into the painful area. I held it until it was very hot and then spat it out. I replaced it and held it like this four times.</p>
<p>However, holding it did not reduce the pain at all. After holding it four times, it was still ineffective.</p>
<p>"Get up and eat. I'll have your sister cook porridge for you."</p>
<p>Lying down hurt, and getting up hurt. Hearing my mother's words, I reluctantly got up.</p>
<p>The porridge was very hot. I stirred it in the bowl with chopsticks, blowing air with my mouth. The more I blew air with my mouth, the more the tooth ached. And the air I blew out was no longer as strong and forceful as usual. It was very weak, almost unable to stir the thin porridge slightly. In front of me was a steaming bowl of thin porridge and several plates of dishes. I frowned, only looking at them. I remembered a story that my father's friend, Doctor Hu, told me when I was young. He said that there was a teacher whose employer was very stingy. The dishes were not good, and there was no rice every day. He was only served porridge. The porridge was so thin that he would be hungry after a while. Once, the teacher tapped his chopsticks on the bowl and recited a poem to the porridge:</p>
<p>"A grain of rice is cooked into a large bowl,</p>
<p>The breeze from the nose brings undulating waves.</p>
<p>It looks like a bronze mirror,</p>
<p>With whiskers and eyebrows fully reflected inside."</p>
<p>Although the verse was not well-crafted, the teacher's description of the thin porridge was truly vivid.</p>
<p>The porridge had cooled to lukewarm. It was thin and soft and could be swallowed relatively smoothly. But eating the dishes was annoying. When I picked up a piece of vegetable and put it in my mouth, even if I chewed it slightly with the teeth on the right side, it would affect the painful tooth on the left side, and the pain would increase sharply. So, I swallowed the vegetables whole.</p>
<p>The pain was still the same, and it gradually felt somewhat worse. Could I continue to bear this pain? So, I took down a large pile of dust-covered tested remedies and household knowledge from the corner of the bookshelf and flipped through them. These books contained many prescriptions for toothache. The medicines in the prescriptions were either impossible to find temporarily or the preparation procedures were extremely complicated. Each prescription claimed to be a hundred percent effective and miraculously effective. I was afraid of being fooled, so I flipped through one book after another and rejected them all. Finally, in the seventh collection of household knowledge, I discovered a "street laugh" that someone had circled with a pen, saying… If you rub it with top-quality borneol and a little cinnabar, it will have a miraculous effect and cure both wind-fire and worm teeth… It is truly worthy of being called a "street laugh" that heals over time… The long two lines of close circles seemed to hide some magic, and I couldn't help but feel some faith in this "street laugh." I immediately bought top-quality borneol and cinnabar, rubbed them with my finger, and rubbed them on once, twice… seven times, eight times… even dozens of times, until my mouth was filled with the intense and unbearable smell of borneol, and the saliva and cinnabar formed something like blood. And the painful tooth became even more painful, even more painful. I believed that this "street laugh" could cure it, but the more I rubbed, the more painful it became. I couldn't sit, and I couldn't stand. I walked from this room to that room, as pitiful as an injured sheep.</p>
<p>At dinner, Grandmother and Mother persuaded me to eat some rice. They said that rice was more nutritious than porridge. But how could I eat it? Grandmother said,</p>
<p>"I don't have a single tooth left. Whether I eat vegetables or rice, I swallow them all."</p>
<p>Grandmother is seventy years old this year, but I didn't know that she ate like this. Can the taste of rice, the taste of vegetables, and the taste of all foods be properly appreciated without careful chewing? From this, it can be seen that all the joys of life for the elderly are as dim as the fading evening glow in the sky after sunset. And we young people are fortunate. Although I am now in the same position as my grandmother when eating, even worse than my grandmother.</p>
<p>After dinner, Mr. Xiancheng came to visit. He heard that I had a toothache and specially went home to get some medicine water and a few aspirins for me. I am grateful to my many friends. They all treat me so kindly.</p>
<p>I rubbed the medicine water several times and took two aspirins. It really felt much better. When the clock struck nine, I went to bed. Extreme fatigue led me to fall asleep immediately. But after sleeping for a while, I woke up from the pain again. It turned out that all so-called toothache medicines were nothing more than anesthetics. The salt water that Mother valued, the borneol and cinnabar of the "street laugh," and the medicine water containing the aroma of chloroform that Mr. Xiancheng brought - their effectiveness was determined by the strength of their anesthetic power. My toothache was so severe that the salt water and borneol were of no use.</p>
