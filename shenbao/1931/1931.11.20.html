<p>巴黎今日國聯兩次會議之結果、徒使一般人起满洲問題解决猶遥遥無期之感想、今日午後行政會十三會員集會、從午後五時起、至八時止、施肇基陳説一小時、於七點五十五分出法外部、芳澤在會塲中費一時三刻之時間、答復關於條約之問話、渠用日語發言、須轉譯英法語、以致會議進行甚緩、國聯方面所得之印象、爲行政會在此次散會時、並未覺較開會前更有頭緒、也公開的會議大約明日可舉行、届時芳澤將發表其言論、行政會現己定明晨十一時再舉行非公開之會議、今日開會時、最可注意之點、爲日代表之提議、主張於接受前所提出五項基本要點之條件下遣派調查委員圑赴满洲、實則日本仍不放棄其原有要求也、日代表又建議此委員圑應有極廣大權力、以調查陳訴事件、且應以超然地位之人物組成之、據芳澤意思、委員長宜以毫無可疑之要人擔任之、聞芳澤且舉法國名將員舟上將．韋甘德將軍等爲擔任此種要職之最相當人物、行政會會員加於芳澤許多問話、意在儘量决定何種條約及何種條文與满洲問題有關、俾可集中注意於此、而將其他非主要的事件暫擱一邊、盤問頗久、且令人厭倦、但有若干點己明白披露、日本不欲有追認有效與否尙含疑義的各舊約之新约、日本欲得中國方面之諒解、即承認現有各約之有效、並聲明中政府忠實履行各約之决心、芳澤因日政府欲行政會了解中日争端之根本原因、故將繕具一文、詳叙造成今日事態之歷史事實、尤詳示日本所以堅欲中國切實承認中國條約義務之理由、此文不日可送交行政會、施博士出會塲後、人争以結果詢之、施僅答稱、行政會所詢關於條約在满洲時局上之特别適用各節、渠己答之矣、施面色沉着、但未呈異常憂色、見者認爲施博士對於會議之進行、尙非完全失望、聞行政會現覓取雙方態度之充分情報、然後努力作具體計畫、同時並擬與國聯與之密切合作之美代表道威斯作同樣之步驟、聞施博士在行政會發言時、曾説明满洲地位、在過去數日内、嚴重愈甚、並對於日飛機之轟擊黑垣、提出嚴重抗議、國聯秘書處今日所發表之文告、内有中國陳説溥儀被刦事之來文、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日本軍隊占領齊齊哈爾之消息傅來、國聯方面之秘密談話大爲掀動、而今晚之秘密談話尙全屬於學説方面、如中日間一切條約之法效、及商業政治權利是也、自今晨秘密會議開始後、各代表即對於學説問題之意見、猶覺紛亂不堪、其他更不必論、故終日談論、實於满洲事件之本身毫無解决之進展也、今晨理事會會議散會時間在下午一時零七分、預定下午四時再繼續會議、迨四時十分理事會之十二會員齊集、預擬問題多種、以備日代表芳澤之逐條答復、而齊齊哈爾被占領之消息、亦適於草就該項問題之際傅到、各國代表接到此項驚人消息後、皆現慌張態度、後决議準五時招請芳澤來會解釋一九○五年一九○九年及一九一九年各中日條約之究竟、今晨各國代表對於中日間各項條約、如何任日本取得满洲商業政治權利之内容、頗不明瞭而各持異議、因此不得不召集中日雙方之代表而加以詢問也、故届五時十五分理事會中各代表與日代表芳澤静心研究條約問題之時、即满洲境内砲聲隆隆、日本在中國領士内之占領區域驟見擴大之時也、芳澤離會議室後數分鐘、施氏即應請命駕而至、時正六時五十分也、芳澤向各代表陳述日本占領满洲之根據理由甚詳、彼以日語陳述、由日本驻法大使館譯員伊籐翻譯、及施氏到會塲、彼亦以華語演説、中國代表在理事會議席上用華語發表意見者、此爲第一次、施氏詞畢、爲時己八時零五分、理事會即宣告延會至星期四日上午續議、施氏在演説詞中、向理事會抗議日本之占領齊齊哈爾、施稱、彼之抗議係根據於新聞電訊、因本國政府尙未以此消息正式供給於彼也、但無論如何、彼對於日軍之繼續砲擊中國北满之人民、不得不提出正式之抗議、因日軍以飛機四出襲擊中國北满各地、固己經南京政府時時以消息供給於彼也、當理事會各員研究中日條約各要點時、美道威斯與日松平會商一小時之久、道氏語美聯社記者、謂渠對理事會仍抱樂觀、惟道氏並未説明樂觀何在、至於後二日内理事會將有何切實决議、今尙未可預必道氏於談話時、擬就致國務卿史汀生之電報一通、於是道氏即離旅館往謁西門、料此談話將有重要之結果、蓋西門將於星期四日回倫敦也、西門在倫敦時、其職務由薛西爾代理、（十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日國聯理事會開會結果又遇一重難關、秘密會議係十一時十分開幕、白里安主席、中日代表仍未參加、惟中代表施肇基博士曾於開會前四十分鐘與美大使道威斯相晤、至理事會遭遇難關之主要原因、由於中日代表在昨日會議席上解釋中日條约完全不同所致、現各理事正盡力搜求根據會章有無其他温和調解方法、據大多數意見、認凡屬合理之努力、己可謂知無不爲、國聯倘欲保持其尊嚴、必須援用會章十六欵之嚴峻行動該欵業經施博士提及、第猶未正式請求耳、此外尙有一層困難、即美國所處地位、現猶缺乏正式報告、理事會認美國在道德上與政治上對於東北事件俱爲最重要之一國、道威斯實有表示其政府態度之道德上義務、且理事會現信日本態度愈益崛强、苟不照其撤兵條件則將佔據不撤、故更有請美國表示態度之必要、嗣秘密會議於十二時三十分散會、定明晨十一時重開、而明日下午或將有公開會議刻聞理事會己正式邀請道威斯正式參加會議矣、又聞白里安於今日開秘密會議前、曾向美聯社發一重要談話稱、渠自中日問題初起時、即認美國之千預、不論獨立行動或與國聯合作、將可分有地位、并鞏固國聯所處地位、使遠東争執迅速和平解决云云、此皆足見理事會内認局勢之嚴重、盼望美國表明態度之急切也、國聯秘書處今日正式否認芳澤大使曾要求理事會將東三省變爲日本保護地、謂芳澤僅一再聲稱、日本未得保護日僑生命財産之保證以前、不能撤兵、而此項保證必須東三省有穏固有力之當道能保護日僑生命財産、始能認爲適當、外間大約基於此語、認爲日本主張在東三省另置能爲中日接受之軍事長官云云、又芳澤今日正式報告理事會、日本曾堅持中國須同意於修正若干發生疑慮之條約、故理事會之願於考慮中日條約全部問題、可認爲日本要求力量充足云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今晨行政會秘密集議一小時、未有結果而散、白里安仍待日本所許致會之書面聲明、非俟收到此項文件、行政會殊難作有益之討論、茲定明晨十一時續開秘密會議、行政會曾討論公開會議問題、衆料明日午後或可開此會議、目下私人談話仍在進行中、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英外相西門被召回倫敦參加内閣重要會議、故未能出席於今晨行政會會議、西門允　速復來巴黎、大約行政會任何重要决議、在西門未回時、勢須展緩、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）各方面皆承認行政會非公開會議之失敗、迄未能對於解决辦法有何進展、但今日非公開會議或必須有一種决議、縱不能有他種决議、亦須有舉行公開的會議之决議、即此一舉、亦無異自認一半失敗、蓋截至目前止之政策、在延緩任何公開的討論、非至雙方意見可接近和解時、不欲會議公開也、行政會至此似不得不走爲一方或雙方所不願有之途徑、同時道威斯松平與西門猶甚活動、繼續談話、顯未放棄可獲具體發展之希望、（十九日路透社電）</p>

<h3>提出重要節略</h3>
<p>内載四全代會宣言　　（巴黎）白里安今晨另有國内要政亟須辦理、故不得不暫離行政會、其他行政會會員、除中日代表外、皆於十一時到會、但白里安遲半小時始到、非公開會議於是乃開始、中國代表今晨以緊急請求送交國聯、請即制止戰争、來文言齊齊哈爾事、及日飛機天空襲擊事、謂日本準備在短時期内作侵略之攻擊、請有以制止之、施博士又提出中國地位之切實節略、内載四全大會之宣言、認爲中政府所必須重視的中國民氣之鎭静表示、施博士謂中國任何政府絶對不能接受在軍事佔據壓力下根據日本五項要點直接談判之解决、施博士臚舉其理由如下、（一）五項要點與安全保障無關、如根據此五點之談判、與日本之撤兵併爲一事、則此五點將迅速變成在满洲成立日本保護國之政治與經濟的程度、（二）中國不欲亦不能依允再簽定另一二十一條要求、而以此換取日本履行國聯會章與非戰公約下條約義務之條件、施博士言及根據會章第十一條謀取妥協之努力、謂以撤兵爲根據五點的談判之條件、安有平等妥協之可言、吾人必拒絶之、如行政會宣布其不能在會章第十一條下列有所爲則吾人定立即請援用國聯會章之其他條文、此爲中國之生死問題、中政府己將中國之政治存在寄於依賴國聯之政策上、故不得不試騐國聯之能力、達於極點、如國聯失敗則中國將公開的歸罪於各大國之不顧維護會章旋博士末稱、今日中國民氣漸强、而其忍耐亦漸竭云、施博士又致國聯一文、言中日報告互相參差事、重申行政會速派中立委員圑調查眞相之請、（十九日路透社電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）中國新任代辦嚴鶴齡今日聲稱、即令日本撤兵之後、中國亦不欲與日本開始直接談判、因日人己在東三省設立傀儡政府、必須將此類政府驅逐後、中國始願與日開談也、目下中日間軍事外交局勢非常複雜、欲謀解决、勢將有無窮盡之談判、中國將請國際海牙法庭或國際委員會解除中日條约關係上之糾紛云、（十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>白里安</p>
<h3>邀道威斯列席</h3>
<p>（巴黎）白里安今日下午親訪美大使道威斯、正式邀其參加理事會討論、又聞白里安己在理事會建議、倘星期五之會仍未能覔得和洽解决辦法、理事會應立即進行解釋會章第十五欵與第十六欵按此舉結果、當可决定制裁問題、頃聞白里安擬於旁晚再訪道威斯、對於美國在對日經濟封鎖上究能合作至何種程度、探詢一確訊、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>英下院</p>
<h3>注意東省時局</h3>
<p>倫敦英下院今日詢及溥儀行踪、外部次官艾登答稱、據所接報告、溥儀己由津赴瀋、但未能證實之、至於满洲是否有成立獨立政府之謀、亦未能斷言之、據渠所聞、遼吉省政府於九月十八日事變後皆皆倾覆、現有臨時委員會代行職權云、議員請政府儘速予下院以辯論英政府對满態度之機會、艾登答稱、外相西門刻在巴黎出席國聯行政會、當於可能時向下院有所陳述云、工黨議員領袖藍斯堡今日在倫敦某處會議時發言、謂解决满洲糾紛之方法、在國聯警告中日兩國、任何一造有不允和平解决其争執者、必受懲戒而己、在種種公約業己簽字之後、如此種問題不能和平解决、人類尙有望乎云、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>美政府否認</p>
<h3>對日秘密外交</h3>
<p>聲明並未提出任何建議（華盛頓）今日美國務卿史汀生發一正式聲明、宣稱、美國僅勸中日兩國用和平方法解决争端、並未向中國或日本有所建議、亦未接到中國或日本之任何提議、渠信國聯理事會之態度、亦係維持和平原則、希望國聯能以和平爲基礎、消弭中日争端、美國則未嘗担有任何義務云云、史氏又否認兩日前紐約紀事論壇報華盛頓電訊所稱、現有舉行束縛中國於不平等領事裁判權條約之運動正在開始進行等説、聲稱、日本拒絶撤兵、不能與美國之拒絶對日經濟封鎖或外交封鎖立即聯爲一起、按紀事論壇報載稱、在星期一國聯開會以前、國務院曾向日大使保證、倘國聯對日經濟或外交封鎖、美絶對不贊助、外間以爲日本之不遵理事會撤兵决議、即因得此保證、故又謂美國最近向中日勸告和平解决争端時有秘密外交等語、因此史汀生聲稱、美國未嘗担有任何任務、力闢以上種種傅説云云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>俄政府</p>
<h3>静觀事勢推移</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）日軍之佔據齊齊哈爾、突使俄京非常注重、現俄政府對日軍佔據黑垣、猶未正式表示意見、但一般消息靈通者逆料、蘇俄將請日本説明其顯似不尊重對俄保證之理由、據稱、蘇俄固極欲避免捲入漩　、惟事勢之趨向、將大半繫於日人能否將其侵犯中東路境域之事實、與日政府前此保證不侵入蘇俄勢力範圍之诺言互相調和以爲斷（十九日國民社電）</p>
<h3>法報論調種種</h3>
<p>自袒日突變爲反日　　（巴黎）法人方面昨抱樂觀、但最近满洲之發展、己使其易樂觀而呈不寗静之氣象矣、報紙批評甚爲焦灼、巴黎晨報稱、會議塲中之發展、己爲日本參謀部所頓挫、巴黎日報稱、可使英美满意之解决法、在日本一面維持原有條約之尊嚴、一面宣佈願得國聯襄助遣派委員圑赴满視察之意耳、小巴黎人報謂雙方皆應負責、但日本態度未見温和、殊可扼腕、施博士之態度、雖較爲得體、然亦不能促協議之成功云、巴黎廻聲報則别有見解、謂許中國加入國聯、爲根本錯誤、因中國未有切實勘定之邊界、且不能實行其國際義務也、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）自昨日以來、此間對東三省事件最顯著之發表、厥爲袒日輿論突變爲反日、昨日各報論調猶熱心贊助日本、今晨則一變而抨擊日人在東三省與在巴黎之政策、即最袒日之巴黎晨報亦加入其中、斥芳澤爲强項、爲頑梗不化、謂談判之頓挫、純由凶横之芳澤得凌駕其同僚駐英大使松平所致、至松平則欲取妥協態度、主張與國聯合作也、至法報之所以若此攻擊者、似由於昨夜芳澤初則不願出度秘密會議、迨幾經勸説、又復遲延半小時、始姗姗其來、旣至則僅宣讀一混淆不清之聲明書、未有以慰藉各理事憤急之情緒、惟今晨則各方情感似己略見和緩、據聞芳澤己有一計劃送交白里安、在專門技術方面、業有若干讓步、現希望此項計劃、或能爲繼續談判之根據、俾最後獲告同意、據聞此項計劃係對國聯派委員至東三省、又中國施總代表現己向人示意、渠業奉南京訓令、倘國聯不能有迅速决議、則將提出會章第十五欵與第十六欵、倘國聯仍拒絶制裁日本、則中國將立即退出國聯云、（十九日國民社電）</p>

<p>要聞</p>
<h3>日軍侵黑經過</h3>
<p>北平通訊、日軍自佔據遼吉後、表面雖稱不侵入北满實則野心勃勃、必欲囊括三省而後快、前此慫慂洮遼鎭守使張海鵬進犯江省、即蓄意侵略北满之鐵證、日人利用張海鵬奪取江省政權、意在分化整個東北、以期達到所謂「满鮮一元」之計劃、張海鵬始則利令智昏、甘受日人利用、十月十五日遂進兵泰來、江省當局、爲圖免戰禍、除一面派相當兵力在嫩江沿岸一帶防守、並拆毁哈爾葛江橋數孔、防止張等前進外、一面復派代表往見張氏、曉以大義、張亦鑒於内部紛岐、股肱被炸、（其圑長徐某）且日人之不可靠、稍有覺悟、將進驻泰來之部隊、撤回洮南、乃日人見之大爲憤恨、立將張之眷屬扣留洮南、逼張積極進兵、襲取江省、一面以修復江橋爲藉口、竟於十一月三日實行進兵、茲將日軍進兵經過、逐日分誌如左、十月二十八日嫩江哈爾葛江橋、因阻止張等北進、破壞數孔、駐江日領清水氏是日照會江省當局、謂洮昂鐵路、有满鐵借欵關係、應由南满鐵路株式會社派工修理己拆毁之江橋等語、江省常局以日人無理要求、當即據理拒駁、</p>
<p>十一月二日上午十時、日領清水曁關東軍司令部代表林義秀少佐復以江橋事件、進謁馬占山、聲稱稱奉該國政府及關東軍司令訓令、以洮昂路與满鐵有借欵關係、應由满鐵派工修理、並擬以兵力掩護工作、當經馬氏駁以满鐵路局對洮昂路僅有債權關係、債權者不能代債務者修理工程、且洮昂路非江省府所屬、不能代爲承認由满鐵興修、容通知洮昂路局自行修理、母煩日本干涉、日領及林少佐仍堅持不允、謂非由日本代修不可、並提出四項條件、（一）嫩江橋梁、不得爲戰事之使用、（二）至十一月三日正午、南北兩軍由橋梁撤退十五公里、（三）距離之地點、在修理未完成前、不許兩軍侵入其地域内、一俟修理完成之日、即再通知兩軍、（四）上項要求若不應允、或妨碍時、認爲對日軍有敵意、即取自由行動、是日下午四時、日飛機兩架、曾在江橋及大興站一帶、偵察兩次、投下傅單甚多、</p>
<p>十一月三日上午十一時、日軍開到江橋鐵甲車二列、兵士三十名、满鐵工人百餘名、飛機五架、實行以武力掩護修理江橋、我軍爲免除衝突計、即將江橋少數駐軍、撤至距十五公里之大興站、乃軍於我軍撤退時、竟由飛機投擲多量炸彈、傷我士兵九名、至午後十時許、復有日兵百餘名、渡過江橋至我軍前方地帶、向我施行猛烈射擊、並投擲炸彈數枚、傷我士兵七名、經二時許、因我方力求避免衝突、未與抵抗、日軍始行退去、</p>
<p>十一月四日上午五時、日軍林少佐率同日本領事館書記早崎、向我步兵第三旅石參謀長蘭斌要求至大興車站我驻軍防地、向我軍講話、石參謀長允可、乃於八時十分由江省赴哈爾葛江橋、該林少佐先向橋西之日訓話、施乘石參謀長正對我軍訓話之際、竟迫令石氏簽字、承認將我軍撤退、並須立即下令執行、石參謀長當即拒絶、謂本人係步兵第三旅參謀長、乃是一部份之參謀長、决不能命令江省其他部隊、且我方士兵負有保境及護僑之責、此乃正當防衛、他人實無干涉之必要、正交涉間、日兵己向我防地推進、捕去我士兵三名、雖經石參謀長再三據理交涉、結果並未放回、聞鐵路工人云被日擄去之三名士兵、己遭日軍殺戮、同日有日軍三百餘名、乘拂曉大霧之際、突向我軍猛烈攻擊、我軍未與之較、詎日飛機五架、又向我軍投擲炸彈六枚、傷兵數名、將大興車站炸燬、我軍至此忍無可忍、不得己乃爲正當防衛、下午六時、日軍復以砲火掩護日兵四千人渡江、山砲數十門、飛機七架、鐵甲車四列、進抵大興車站、向我軍施行猛烈攻擊、我軍官兵拚死抵抗、不爲所屈、迄至日暮、日軍砲火攻擊仍不稍懈、我軍傷亡五百餘名、江省當局鑒於大興陣地、難於固守、遂於六日下午二時下令退至三間房車站、（距大興三十里）固守陣地、由六日下午起、日軍遂不斷向我攻擊、（十六日）</p>
<h3>美報警醒暴日</h3>
<p>大美晚報昨日社評云、記者不欲爲戰争界説斷斷争辯、今日容或有人仍信東三省無戰事、但自吾輩觀之、顯己有戰争、且非小規模之戰争、馬占山旣不畏强敵、挺身應戰、雖未與日本全國較量、亦己與一部份日軍交綏、而一顯其好身手、吾思馬氏此次可使日帝國支出一筆鉅額庫帑也、日本固仍可不對華宣戰、不對馬將軍宣戰、日本固仍可稱其東三省行險徼幸之舉、爲維護和平事業、繼續輸入其來復槍大砲轟炸飛機、及其他维持和平秩序之具、直待東三省華人綏靖至不留一人而後止、或東三省日僑綏靖至不留一人而後止、更或兩敗俱傷、勢同卡莊之虎而後己、由吾輩言之、或者日人竟能若此、今日之勢、似僅有國際聯盟可以且不使事勢爆發之方法、出而干涉、乃國聯顯似窘困、至错惘莫知所措、蘇俄爲中國最近鄰邦、但即令中俄邦交方篤、吾人亦信蘇俄有充分之常識與節儉、不願參加若斯糜費之宴會也、况今日之中俄、尙未復交者乎、日本此時固可儘所欲爲、然吾輩實希望其一醒迷夢、審察實際、縱爲時己晚、亦猶未遲、若此日之所爲、非綏靖東北、乃挑激東北、不足以保護日僑、反使日僑處境益艱、亦非所以使南满鐵路增加收入、反足以促其减少、總之、日本己鑄一大錯爲今之計、惟有清理賑目、將以前種種一筆勾銷、踐行國聯會章與非戰公約下之信诺、撤退其軍隊、然即令日人趕急撤兵、而此種糾紛之局、經長時間之疏理、能否圓满解决、猶未可知、苟其不然、則日人之頑梗、吾知其於己國於全世界定將蒙鉅大之損失也、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>紅羊刦後。漢人之戰續。超過八旗。獨吉林將軍依　唐阿。驍勇善戰。冠絶情　。部下軍隊。均貔貅之士保障東北。清廷頗倚重之。中日戰起。依獨領所部萬餘人。不顧　吳大澂部下。轉戰於蓋手摩天嶺一帶屢以奇計引誘日軍深入重地。聚而殲之。身經數十戰。莫不身先士辛。披堅陷陣。肉薄相搏。當者披靡。當吳大澂兵駐錦州時。吳自領中軍。宋慶當右翼。依領八旗兵當左翼。日將大鳥圭介。深知依宋不可犯。乃以輕騎截中軍。屢有勝負。迨吳大營潰散。退入關中。所賴以支持者。依宋耳。宋老成持重以攻爲守。依則據險扼敵。更以輕騎包抄敵軍之後。三面夾攻。戰功尤顯。摩天嶺之役。時值深夜。風雨交作。依攻其無備。選騎兵八百。啣枚疾走。衝人敵營。依馳怒馬指揮。斬　千餘級。俘敵兵五百餘。尸横遍地。血流成渠。日軍敗退五十餘里。喘息未定。而宋　之軍。又追踪而至。大敗日軍。是役也。依奪獲槍四千餘枝。砲二十餘門。依報捷清廷。中有直搗黄龍。滅此朝食。時論榮之。何如舉朝惶恐。急於議和。直督李鴻章奉命赴馬關議和。兩軍遂停戰。依償而辭職。奉旨慰留。依仍回吉林屯墾。致失此大好之機會。言之不禁令人扼腕不己也。</p>
<h3>倭邦瑣話</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>自瀋陽之事變起。國人莫不注意倭邦之情形而探討之。茲將予所聞於旅倭友人者。瑣述於左。</p>
<p>倭人凡二十一歲以上。俱有當兵之義務。一旦國有戰事。則士輟讀農輟耕。工商輟其業以赴之。即承平之世。亦必練習作戰。爲營伍之生活。故凡謀職務者。對方必詢其曾入行伍與否。并騐視其執證。否則拒絶之。以爲逋逃之罪人。不之容納也。</p>
<p>排斥華人。爲倭國之通例。蓋不自今日始。其理由謂雜居爲同等國唯一之權利。中國不能與彼邦處同等地位。即不能與中國以雜居之權利。且指中國人爲下等社會之人。什九未受敎育。雜居恐有妨礙彼邦之風俗衞生也。中國人吝嗇成。性善居積致富。恐携巨貲返國。有妨礙彼邦之經濟也。中國人生活程度低。工價隨之而廉。相較之下。人皆樂用低廉之華工。殊有妨於彼邦之勞工生活也。</p>
<p>西方諸器皿織物。倭人輒能摹仿爲之。且較西方之物爲廉。故倭人俱樂用本國貨。持之有恒。守之成習。不若我國之創巨痛深。然後始言抵制與提倡。祇短時間之五分鐘也。</p>
<p>倭邦以我國之文化爲文化。我國之名著。輒迻譯爲倭文本。如四書五經。莊．老．列．荀．墨．管．韓．非諸子。以及八大家文。唐宋元人之詩詞曲。旁及小説家言。三國志．紅樓夢．儒林外史。西游記。鏡花緣．花月痕等。咸成倭文。售諸坊間。家絃户誦。稱爲漢學。茲戰事發生。彼邦有一報紙。專以迻譯我國報紙所載之軍國大事</p>
<h3>朔方健兒歌</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>暴日陷我瀋吉後。更進圖我黑省。詎連敗於我黑軍與屯墾軍。暴日朝野爲之不安。將以大軍圍攻然天寒地冰孤軍困守。尙未聞我方有援應之舉。而廪庫又虚。奈何奈何。馬將軍克盡守土之責。部下義土。亦皆同仇敵愾能爲國家一洗恥辱。蓋我國萬歲千秋之干城也。深幸國人連日自動捐助鉅欵。願望我書畫界亦繼起而謀之。使馬將軍與衆義士得竟捍侮之功。爰製此歌以激發之。</p>
<p>瀋陽被陷且二月。吹脣沸地争不窮敬塘被挾憐稚子。嗤彼老悖稱孤忠。亡韓之法亡我國葫蘆依樣描寫中。吾不知養兵百萬今何用。坐使河山如此終。豈意尙有男兒馬。心如鐵石氣如虹。振臂一呼赴國難。一夫各有萬夫雄。嫩江之戰破敵胆。有如敗葉摧勁風。倭國朝野聞消息失色相驚舉島同更傅徵符發援隊。將以大軍集满蒙。孤軍深陷我奈何。愴彼膏梁尙舞歌君不見。朔風捲地如利鏃。挾纊難温巡如梭。又不見冰天雪窖敵满野。腸飢體寒力揮戈。須知辛苦欲何爲。將以鐵血保山山河。吁嗟乎。將以鐵血保山河。</p>
<p>爲能事。蓋所以窺察我國輿論之一斑。軍情之狀况。以普告其人民。謀不利於我之詭計。亦殊狡矣。</p>
<p>倭軍飛揚跋扈。不可一世。有某名流者惄焉憂之。曾發表一論文。大概謂軍人太驕。爲致敗之兆。并指彼邦自日俄之戰後。其軍隊均未經正式之戰陣。而中國自革命以還。二十年間。軍閥鏖兵不息。從一方面言。固足以耗中國之實力。從又一方面言。亦足以富軍人之戰地經騐。故此次事變發生。在彼邦未可樂觀云云。某名流洵有識之士哉。我國其努力爲之。戎馬關山。或有東搗扶桑之望也。</p>
<h3>觀現代名畫展</h3>
<p>— 玉崑</p>
<p>薛保倫君集現代四十名家畫展於寗波同鄉會。盛况可謂自全國美展以後所未有。而出品之精審且過之。全會塲出品。以符鐵年鄭午昌錢瘦鐵陳小蝶諸先生之聲譽爲最濃厚。鐵年久去北平。滬人渴想其作品。故陳列之第一日。即己定購一空。尤以墨蘭一幅。韵逸夐絶。而陳小蝶君荷花大幅於尋丈之紙。僅寫殘荷一朶。風致娟娟。尤在鐵年墨蘭之上。錢瘦鐵君有墨筆花卉四幀。直可抗手玉几。宜乎此數畫之前。佇屣常满也。吳東邁先生言觀小蝶花卉筆墨之雅。能令全塲作品皆有施朱太濃着墨太黑之恨。吾謂現代畫家以工力論。作者甚不乏人。若論天資敏妙。則蝶野（小蝶别署）近作。雖湖帆超然不能過也。吳湖帆君於畫絶不許人。而獨於小蝶近作。則曰仙乎仙乎。其價值可想矣。瘦鐵畫在東灜久己紙貴。近以日本暴行立誓絶不再以作品售諸日人。立品如此。其畫自有磅薄之氣。鄭午昌賀天健作品皆刻意經營。佈局新雋。用筆超脱。二君弟子甚多。故近日畫壇己漸捨安吉狂放一派。而趨純粹。則鄭賀之有功畫壇。豈淺鮮哉。綜觀全塲出品。清新俊逸爲多。朱墨狂塗者甚少蓋己一改二三年前縱横家畫派。昔人云。觀於一時晝畫作風。可以覘時世治亂之隱微。豈茲世去爲治己不遠耶。跂予望之。故樂爲之記。</p>
<h3>民國祗有兩個將軍</h3>
<p>— 達書安</p>
<p>東北豐林沃原。地盡寶藏。自九月十八以來。矮奴入寇。不數小時。賊不血刃。傳檄而定。黑山崩頽。白水朱殷。青年長官曰。不抵抗。革命政府亦曰。鎭静。但乞靈於國聯。國人亦從而畏怯之。疑倭賊之自天而降。皆具有三頭六臂者。</p>
<p>風悲曰曛絶塞孤軍。馬將軍只知守士有責。不爲賊檄所屈。以數千之衆。困於一隅。後無援軍。與暴賊作殊死戰。賊屢慘敗。國人向疑寇爲三頭六臂。今始恍然乃銀樣蠟。不足一擊。以革命政府與青年長官之智識。安得不知而且詳。而竟爲虚聲所懾。而竟望風披靡。豈别有懷抱。國人愚而蠢。又安能測其高深。然國人摇摇將墜入亡國奴隸之窟之恐怖。兩月以來之光隂。則眞殷憂如焚。度曰似年。而政府與青年長官。鎭静如故。中國二十年以來。止擋俄禦曰。可稱戰事。中國二十年以來。止韓光第馬占山二人。可稱將軍。韓將軍陣亡殉國。僅一馬占山將軍困於邊塞。支撑此半壁殘破之江山。我爲將軍懼。我爲國人懼。（移酬助賑）</p>
<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>廠甸乾隆三十六年。琉璃廠東頭發現遼御史大夫李内貞墓。其誌石有葬於城東海王村之語。於是始知琉璃廠在契丹時爲東郊之地。琉璃廠者。工部所設製琉璃磗瓦之地也。全街均爲書店古玩店及南紙店他如花砲飲食店。僅偶一見。道咸以來。唧相士夫退食之暇。輒於此檢閲書册評賞字畫摩挲彝鼎度其優閒之歲月。隱然成北都文化中心。週年舊歷歲首。負販設攤者　集其間。道爲之塞。警廳須先事指定路綫。疏通車馬。僅得無事。蓋全城無貴賤貧富雅俗男女老幼中外。無不往游爲快也。謂之逛廠甸。十七年以後。禁止舊歷。頗復稍衰。然旋復依例。蓋故都繁榮不能不有賴於此也。</p>
<p>有王卓然者。於民國十年舊歷正月初三日起至十五日。調查廠甸商業。製成八表。一日要貨。謂小兒玩具也。在各種商業首屈一指。每日售貨直銅元八萬枚以上。次曰飲食。謂茶點之屬也。三曰日用品。以婦女妝具爲多。四日古物。其中古玩一百三十九户。古畫五十户。古書二十八户。五曰雜項。花砲金魚之屬。六曰雜技。西洋景之屬。七曰運賭。其别曰抽簽。曰滾蛋。曰轉轉。八曰非商業的營業。則政府及學校所經營之游藝會陳列所等也。</p>
<p>明胡應麟少室山房集云。燕中書肆多在大明門之右。及禮部門之外。拱宸門之西。每會試舉子。則書肆列於揚前。每花朝後二三日則移於鐙巾。每朔望並下澣五日則徙於城隍廟中。鐙市極東。城隍廟極西。皆日中貿易所也。鐙市歲三日。城隍廟月三日。至期百貨萃焉。書其一也。此明代鬻書之情形。與今大異。今書肆除琉璃廠及其附近外。以隆福寺爲最多。頭髮胡同小市亦有之。而品稍下。若近年東安市場書肆林立。則多新籍。供普通學生之瀏覽而己。故都百業凋零。惟舊書業愈亦發達。蓋學術昌明。需要彌繁。從前冷僻之書無人過問者。今或以爲尃門之業。例如各省志書從前幾於論斤買者。今每部必值數元。罕見者至值數百元。家譜之類素不入藏。今亦見收於北平圖書館。而猶苦於無處可覔。加以日本歐美皆有專駐之員。日事訪求。不吝重值。國内好事之流。廣有金帛競搜善本。聲氣交通。此呼彼應。皆以北平爲綰毂之區琉璃廠隆福寺各書肆多以幹員分駐各地。猶患肆應之不及也。近年城内舊家之藏。多己羅掘無餘。唯外縣僻遠之區。尙有珍藴未發者。書肆中人雖於學術源流懵無所知。然名目版本則如數家珍苟欲訪求一書。但任語一肆。彼自能輾轉窮搜以報命。即或中止不購。亦無怨色也。凡每年歲首廠甸陳列之品非必上乘。好事者徘徊消遣於冷攤之畔。偶或以廉價得殘本。若眞欲購書。不必拘拘是時也。其購古玩字畫亦然。</p>
<p>满招損醉痴生一天在下偶入玄虚之境。聽到甲乙二人的談話。覺其滑稽突梯。頗饒趣味。特記了出來。</p>
<p>甲道。此次暴日喧賓奪主。强佔我東北。我國所受一切損失。眞不可以數計。恰應了書上所説」满招損「一句話了。</p>
<p>」满「是满州。當然指東北而言。而」招「字含有引誘之意。因爲東北富源徧地。大利所在。倭人見而垂涎。於是趨之若騖。還口口聲聲以」擁護满蒙利益「爲言。實行種種侵略結果招到今日的損失。古人預言妙語雙關。早己昭示於先惜乎那位有守土之責者。未曾多讀書。不知此中奥義。否則思患預防。何致喪地辱國。一瀉千里。糟到如此地步呢。</p>
<p>乙道。他（指有守土之責者。）書何嘗不讀。不過讀而不透。所讀的祗下一句」謙受益。「他自以爲謙謙君子。吃虧就是便宜。這就呌做」謙受益「所以遇到敵兵臨境。也以謙讓爲宗旨。抱着不抵抗主義。步步退讓。人家便不勞而獲了。從前趙普以半部論語治天下。現在他以誤讀一句書。斷送了東北。眞是多麽的傷心呀。</p>
<p>说部抉輪會</p>
<h3>鄉下人又到上海（二十二）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>那時鄉下人還没有明白怎麽踏熄了他們一圑的火就算是觸了他們的霉頭怎麽把一圑亂紙燃上了火就算是燒路頭他要把這個疑問請敎那爲他解圍的朋友了。</p>
<p>那位朋友倒很誠實他便告訴了鄉下人。</p>
<p>」这是上海一般下等社會的迷信。譬如拉黄包車的他把車子拖了出來兜攬了半天没有兜攬着一個乘客他便要燒路頭了。燒旺一張紙便在車身的前後亂燻。賣五香茶葉蛋的賣白糖蓮心粥的賣桂花脂油糕的賣火腿豆沙粽子的一切一切的做小生意的招不到主顧他們發急了也是燒旺了一張紙在他們的擔子啊籃子啊一切所有的商用工具的前前後後亂燻有時還要默默的通神禱告這便算是燒路頭。他們那班野雞妓女也是如此。他們每天非拉倒一個客人不能生活。有的不是自己的身體他們稱之爲討人身體若是一夜天拉不到客人回去便是要打要駡所以他們發了急以爲這兩天運氣不好也和拉黄包車的和做小生意的一般常常要燒路頭了。那些拉黄包車的和做小生意的他們燒旺了一張紙在他們車子前後或是擔子籃子的前後一切商用工具的前前後後亂燻。那班野雞妓女可憐没有什麽商用工具地們的商用工具就是他們的這個身體以及他們身體的全部和局部所以他們燒旺了一張紙只向他們的褲襠裏亂燻這便是他們的燒路頭。不想你老先生誤會了踏熄了他們紙上的餘火因此就算觸了他們的霉頭了。「」如此説來這班當野雞的姑娘也覺得很可憐咧。「鄉下人對於這班野雞立時發了惻隠之心。從前做詩的人有兩句诗道」人言此是鴛鴦侣我作哀鴻一例看」。鄉下人雖不能做詩却很富有那種詩意。</p>
<p>」可不是嗎你瞧他們雖然外面打扮得妖妖嬈嬈其實是很苦還有許多身上都是害着花柳病的也要出來拉客。你要和他們一接觸明天回去不是做了牛奶棚老　便是當了水果店小開。</p>
<p>」什麽牛奶棚什麽水果店「鄉下人不懂得這種隠語。</p>
<p>」哈哈牛奶棚就是淋濁水果店簡直是販買了楊梅大瘡來了。「</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>河下米市漲起二角　　▲南頭昨日各帮來源被風阻、竟告寂寥、浦存有限、城鄉店銷觀此到　日稀且聞閘市先增胃口均稱强健、成交與昨更濃、售價逐步喝硬、是以厚新粳行情尤提二角、薄稻貨亦無幾、銷塲本街不弱、寗胃亦健、市價高料復增二角、中檔跟起一角、市况與厚粳相仿、蘆洋尖貨尙寥落、去化清淡、價格亦屬帶挺、變隂元來貨絶跡、浦存轉薄、零交仍平、中次者非賤不可、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨日到船約念數艘、市銷因天時不佳、更覺活動、各方買氣極佳、西新更見昂近角、頂貨又將達十五元關口、中關交易甚佳、至午後銷　轉淡、大勢不易向上、　稻到接銷淡、價因更穏蘆埠尖去路極　、行情趨緊角半、統市零胃甚爽、故行情俏俐、</p>
<h3>現洋米續漲五分</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况洋行仍無抛售、産地合價尙高、暫無大額成交之期望故市上人心甚佳、現米有本街問津市氣乃見逐步轉機之象、統巾由本街辦去二千包左右計一號西貢十元零六角、次十元零四五角、小絞十元零三角半至十元零二角半、均比前日上漲五分左右、如今明本街續辦再有客帮問津、市面似有步高之必要也、期貨無新交易、回籠貨開出數百噸計二月份小絞四兩九錢三分半、三月份五兩、四月份五兩零八分、均比前市略小云、</p>
<p>標粉平疲之象</p>
<p>▲洋麥報價續小實銷與投機觀望</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈平軟之象、以金價雖仍穏定洋麥之報價則小五六角左右不等兼之時局不靖、無論實銷與投機、均觀望居多、而金融緊縮非有實力者當不能逐步　買故近遠各期依然暗淡、全日成交數量、均見减退恐後步因金融之故難免再疲也結果本月份較前日跌一分二厘半、十二月份小七厘半、一月份小一分二月份不動三月份反好五厘四月份好二厘半云</p>
<h3>期麥趨勢疲軟</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面上下午開盤後、各月份大致趨平疲盤旋之象、因自金價重漲後、對洋麥之合價雖見阻碍、惟大多數均因　轍可慮、不敢搶買、且金融旣緊、時局又步嚴重故買氣甚寂、頗覺蕭條、後步當看粉銷如何、方有升降也、結果本月份較前日跌二分、十二月份小一分、一二月份不動三月份好一分四月份好二分云、</p>

<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>本廠品供不應求</p>
<p>疋頭市仍沉悶、大有無聲無臭之象良以西貨存底缺乏、普通品極形稀少、東貨在抵制中本廠品出貨供不應求、時呈斷檔、雖各廠之遠期貨亦己定出一空、趨勢之俏利、爲從來所未有、故獲利均可操左劵、一般籌備组織者、頗不乏人、實爲提倡國貨聲中之好現象也、所以嗣後劣貨、即使開通恐亦一蹶不振矣、國貨出品邇來以絨貨最多、通成之雙幅厚絨爲九錢七分半各廠之單幅四錢七分半彩條絨身份佳者爲九兩普通八兩一錢、毛條絨出品亦曰見增多、開三錢二分及三錢二項、漂白絨被拉毛廠搜羅一空三鹿三桃零拆均己開至四錢左右、實乃現货均屬缺乏之故耳妃法絨月華絨等亦能紡織細嗶嘰　貢呢出品日漸多棉布仍平定、十一磅之三鹿三兎均五兩五錢九磅貓英等五兩二錢、細布細斜均須八兩左右、元芳呌莊貨因走銷清淡、昨日無不暴落元羽綢跌有一二兩之譜元西緞等每碼小四五分、然銀根奇緊亦屬一重大原因也、</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<p>法將福煦</p>
<p>歐戰日記顧昂若譯</p>
<p>協約政府因請我從軍事立場擬就詳細建議協約政府的發言人克萊孟沙君約我及貝當司令於十月二十四日在巴黎會見、我們對於休戰條件口頭同意、封鎖决定維持、休戰時期决定縮短、</p>
<p>我軍十月八日以後續有進展、因此我方條件可以更見有力更見具體、</p>
<p>次日、我召集美英法軍三總司令和法法海軍參謀長特朋在聖里我的司令部集會、徵求他們的意見、我請他們各自提出休戰條件、比軍參謀長因路遠不及趕到、他們次日到聖里、他看了休戰條文、表示贊同、</p>
<p>海格元帥首先發言道、據他的意見、德軍大體上尙未崩潰、到不足頑抗的程度、德軍仍能固守邊防以敵相等的或優勢的兵力、惟英軍短少五萬步兵、法軍精疲力竭、美軍編製不完全、所以他主張對德條件不應過苛、他的條件如下、</p>
<p>（一）退出比利和法國被佔部分、　　（二）退出阿爾薩斯勞倫、梅慈和斯特拉斯堡交於聯軍、</p>
<p>（三）歸還法比車輛機頭、資遣法比人民回籍、</p>
<p>我認爲他所提出的條件理由並不充足、遂未加討論、因在幾個月裏、德軍防地兵士軍實損失甚大、敗軍不足以言勇、德軍早成强弩之末了、至於聯軍方面所欲承認的無非勝軍不復是生力軍而己、我軍打過一次大勝仗、而戰事那樣的激烈、勝軍的犧牲自然常較敗軍爲大、惟德軍雖尙未完全瓦解、但亦無足重輕了、　　其次、貝當司令主張務使德軍不能再戰、他的條件如下、</p>
<p>（一）聯軍佔領萊茵河左岸自荷蘭邊境以至瑞士邊境、並包括右岸的橋頭、限期定爲十五天、</p>
<p>（三）德軍交出完備的機頭五千部、火車十萬輛、</p>
<p>再次、潘興司令發表主張、他認軍事形勢聯軍有利、應對德提出强昂條件、他的條件如下、</p>
<p>（一）敵軍立即退出佔領區域、</p>
<p>（二）聯軍佔領阿爾薩斯勞倫、</p>
<p>（三）德軍退出萊茵河右岸和聯軍佔領右岸橋頭、</p>
<p>（四）美軍及其軍實的海運不能反對　　（五）立即資遣德軍佔領區域的居民回籍、</p>
<p>（六）全部潛水艇根據地交與聯軍或中立國、</p>
<p>歸還比軍的車輛機頭、</p>
<p>會議結束的時候、我們便把準備提陳聯軍政府的軍事條件、擬成草案如下、　　（一）立即退出非法佔領區域、即比利時．法蘭西．阿爾薩斯勞倫．及盧森堡、立即資遣各地居民回籍、</p>
<p>（二）敵軍交出大砲五千門、機關槍十萬架、</p>
<p>（三）德軍退出萊茵河左岸、聯軍佔右岸梅洋斯．谷布朗．古龍．及斯特拉堡四處橋頭堡、以半徑長十八又四分之三哩爲限度、右岸定二十五哩闊爲中立地勢、</p>
<p>（四）撤退區域敵軍不并任何破壞損害　　（五）交出完備機頭五千部火車十五萬輛、</p>
<p>（六）交出潛水艇一百五十只、海面艦隊撤退至波羅的海港、克斯海文和里列谷倫軍港由聯軍艦隊佔領、</p>
<p>（七）在履行上列條件期内繼續封鎖、　　十月廿六日午後、我親自把這草案携往巴黎交給總統和總理、普恩克萊總統當即表示這些條件將爲德人拒絶、我回答道、「那末、我們惟有續戰、因聯軍現己進展到這個地步、非至德軍不能抵抗和佔領絶對確定和平的保障不能停頓、這和平我軍將以無上的犧牲獲得、」　　我軍進取柏林的軍事非至控制了萊茵河的屏障不能停止、</p>
<p>我一面在十月廿九日函告克萊盂沙總理、請其注意聯軍方面有提出過苛的海軍條件的傾向、這恐使陸軍方面有爲難的地方、故請其休戰條件最後草案决定之前、使我參加意見、</p>
<p>十月卅一日晨、協約政府首領在威爾遜總統特派駐在巴黎的好斯大佐住宅召集首次會議、開會時得悉土爾其適己簽訂摩特洛斯休戰休約、而奥國亦己經屈服、這消息使我更易發表一般的軍事狀態的意見、揮出形勢如何有利於聯軍、　　三個月來、法比境内的德軍一敗塗地、退却形勢急轉直下、德軍被俘廿六萬以上、損失大砲六千門、他們國内的軍事形勢己是不能再支、我軍一冬天却能維持着二百五十哩長全線的戰鬥力、我軍繼續作戰殲滅敵軍自無問題、</p>
<p>我陳述完畢、好斯大佐即問我對德和戰的主張、</p>
<p>我答道、「我並不是爲作戰而作戰、假使休戰而能使德軍接管協約的條件、我是满意的、這目的達到之後、誰也無權再使流血、」</p>
<p>當天午後、最高軍事評議會在凡爾賽舉行全體會議、討論匈奥休戰條件、我又被邀發表意見、我仍申述晨間的主張、認爲聯軍形勢更趨有利、</p>
<p>十一月一日評議會開始詳細研究對德條件、</p>
<p>晨間協約政府主腦會議在巴黎陸軍部舉行第一次集會、我所提出的佔領萊茵河左岸的條件宣讀後、即開始討論、以便給予海格元帥重新發表主張和重提十月廿五日的意見書的機會、該意見書實即勞合喬治等人的主張、</p>
<p>該意見書主張聯軍在比利時．盧森堡．和阿爾薩斯勞倫邉境停兵、就是説停在萊茵河左岸、聯軍並不開到萊茵河、屏障在我鼻子前面、這是軍事上不能接受的、這樣、德國仍可憑藉萊茵河的掩護、乘着議和的時間、改編軍隊、一朝和議破裂、便可利用不利於聯軍形勢重新作戰、聯軍苦戰所得的利益、必將失於一旦、假使休戰條約不能使聯軍控制萊茵河、和平有難底於成的危險、</p>
<p>我的主旨卒爲接受、（未完）</p>

<h3>Domestic Important News</h3>
<p>After bitter fighting, Ma Zhanshan's troops, with exhausted ammunition and no reinforcements, retreated to Keshan. Heihe fell under the bombardment of enemy aircraft and heavy artillery. Ma Zhanshan led his troops east, intending to recruit local militias for a counterattack. Japan reportedly pressured Zhang Jinghui to assume the position of Chairman of Heilongjiang Province. Japan's proposal to the League of Nations for sending an investigative team was discussed at 10:30 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Heihe</h3>
<p>Japanese cavalry, flanking our rear, fired over thirty shells at Heihe. Japanese aircraft bombed and destroyed the military headquarters. A fierce battle took place outside Longjiang city. Ma Zhanshan led his troops to retreat along the Qiqihar-Keshan railway line. Harbin, 10:30 AM today: Japanese troops occupied Heihe. Ma Zhanshan led the remaining troops to cover the retreat of officials from various departments and over a thousand merchants and residents of the provincial capital to Keshan. At 9:00 AM today, Japanese troops crossed the Taonan-Ang'angxi railway bridge over the East China Railway, launching a fierce attack on our troops outside Heihe city. Two Japanese aircraft bombed the military headquarters in the provincial capital, causing chaos in the provincial government and city streets. Simultaneously, Japanese troops fired over thirty shells at Heihe, and over a thousand cavalrymen flanked the rear of the Heilongjiang army from the left side of Heihe. Ma Zhanshan, unable to fight further, retreated along the Qiqihar-Keshan road. Over four thousand Japanese cavalry and artillery pursued. Another hundred or so cavalry entered Heihe, the consulate, and forced shops to display the Japanese flag in welcome. At noon, a Japanese aircraft circled Heihe, scattering leaflets from Commander Domen, advising the people to live in peace. Commander Domen entered Heihe at 2:00 PM this afternoon. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: Japanese cavalry detachment discovered near Yushutun, near Heihe, thirty miles from the provincial capital, placing the capital in imminent danger. Many enemy cavalry detachments discovered outside Ang'angxi Longjiang. Ma Zhanshan ordered his pistol squads and guards to engage in battle, turning the entire area outside Heihe into a battlefield. Ma Zhanshan urgently telegraphed Ping for reinforcements and ammunition. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: At 11:00 AM today, a Japanese aircraft flew over Heihe, dropping leaflets urging the public to surrender, containing extremely absurd language. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: Ma Zhanshan, finding Keshan difficult to defend, will retreat towards Baiquan and Qinggang, recruiting local militias for a counterattack. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Ma Zhanshan withdrew from Heihe at 7:00 PM on the 19th. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Ma Zhanshan and Xie Ke telegraphed the entire country on the 18th, stating that in order to avoid conflict, the provincial defense forces had retreated to the Sanjianfang area, but the Japanese troops did not fulfill their declaration to prevent military expansion, attacking relentlessly every day. Furthermore, on the 16th, while the League of Nations was in session, they dispatched more troops, multiple tanks, over ten aircraft, and eight heavy artillery pieces, launching a fierce attack day and night until the morning of the 18th. Our troops were exhausted and outnumbered, coupled with inferior equipment, resulting in a partial breach of our defense line. Our troops swore to counterattack and engaged in hand-to-hand combat for a long time before restoring the original situation. At 2:00 PM, the Japanese used tanks and heavy artillery to launch a fierce attack, causing the entire front to falter. They then dispatched cavalry in all directions, causing chaos everywhere, and used eight aircraft to drop bombs on the provincial capital as a show of force, causing great panic among merchants and residents, who begged to temporarily evacuate to a safe area to avoid the suffering of the people. The Japanese troops, disregarding the League of Nations' reasonable measures, relied on their strength to seize territory and acted arbitrarily, not only disregarding the League of Nations but also completely destroying world peace and international morality. In order to comply with the people's wishes and respect the League of Nations, we are temporarily retreating to a safe area, awaiting a fair resolution. The telegram ended with tears and incomprehensible words. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Bu Kui telegram on the 19th: Intense fighting throughout the night. Our troops suffered significant pressure from Japanese artillery fire. The left and right flanks were fiercely attacked by armored vehicles and machine guns. Our entire line retreated north of the Chinese Eastern Railway, resisting the main Japanese force in hand-to-hand combat in an area thirty li from Qiqihar. Furthermore, behind our positions, a small number of Japanese cavalry retreated from the eastern part of the battle line, mingling with the plainclothes team ambushed near the provincial capital, causing widespread chaos, resulting in extreme fear among the city's residents. On the morning of the 19th, five or six Japanese aircraft returned to drop bombs, causing very heavy damage within the city. Chairman Ma, unable to bear the destruction of the provincial capital, has decided to move the command headquarters and defense line to the northeast of the provincial capital. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qiqihar: General Ma Zhanshan leads his lone army in resisting the powerful enemy, lacking both supplies and ammunition, and receiving no outside assistance. Despite continuous victories in the bitter fighting over several days, his situation has become dire. He continues to be driven by loyalty and righteousness, and the morale of his troops is very high. Yesterday morning, they still fought fiercely throughout the day, repeatedly thwarting the powerful enemy, but eventually ran out of ammunition and could no longer sustain the fight with bare hands. Ang'angxi fell at 1:00 PM on the 18th. Qiqihar followed, falling at 8:00 PM that afternoon. Currently, Heilongjiang's civil and military officials are leading the remaining troops north to retreat and await assistance. (19th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shenyang: The Japanese military headquarters confirms that Qiqihar was captured by Japanese troops at 9:00 AM this morning, and completely occupied by 10:00 AM.

<p>(Beiping) Bu Kui telegram states that from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM on the 18th, Japanese and our troops were engaged in intense fighting.

<p>Artilleryman Pang Dehai</p>
<h3>Goes Insane Due to Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>(Harbin) During the fierce battle at Daxing on the 18th night, a private first class mortarman from the Second Regiment, Pang Dehai, fought fiercely with his comrades, firing eighty rounds, causing the mortar barrel to overheat and explode. He continued to fight with his bare hands, shouting and killing. His comrades rescued him from danger, but he went insane due to the stress. After arriving at Ang'angxi Station, he was pitied and rescued by a traveler and sent to a hospital in Harbin. He kept gesturing to people, saying that the mortar was broken, there were no reinforcements, and they couldn't kill the Japanese, etc. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Reach Ang'angxi</h3>
<p>Occupy the Chinese Eastern Railway Station</p>
<p>Withdrew Only Yesterday Afternoon</p>

(19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Today, a Japanese public announcement stated that the main force of the Japanese army had arrived at the Chinese Eastern Railway last night, preparing to pursue the fleeing army. However, the news is extremely simple because the communication line of the Taonan-Ang'angxi railway is often destroyed. Many Chinese people along the Chinese Eastern Railway line abandoned their possessions and fled. The temperature in Qiqihar is twenty degrees below zero, and the north wind is very strong. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

This army belongs to Ding Chao of Jilin, and through the mediation of Zhang Jinghui, they have reached a tacit agreement with the Japanese. Passenger trains between Harbin and Ang'angxi on the Chinese Eastern Railway are operating as usual today. Currently, news from Heihe is still getting through, and the claim that the provincial capital has fallen is not accurate. However, the Heilongjiang army is running out of supplies and ammunition and is difficult to defend. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Coerce</p>

<p>Tianjin Japanese Army</p>
<h3>Still Adopting a Provocative Attitude</h3>
<p>Expanding the Area of Alert - Shooting and Wounding Chinese Police - Setting Up Cannons on Rooftops as a Demonstration</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The situation in the Chinese district is still the same as on the 18th. Trolleys are running on West and North Main Roads, but on South and East Main Roads, the trolley dares not risk operating as the defenses on Asahi Street have not been removed. Pedestrians can pass to and fro on the pavement. Security in the Japanese Settlement is as strict as before. The Japanese military police occupying the Second District and the Sixth Precinct have not only not withdrawn, but have expanded the area of alert on the 19th. Japanese soldiers are stationed from the north of the Chinese-Japanese Middle School in the west to the south of Haiguang Temple in the east, and they are raising the defenses. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) On the 19th, the Japanese army set up three machine guns on the roof of the Second District and Sixth Precinct building and four mountain guns behind Lao Jiuzhang. According to a Japanese informant, the Japanese military headquarters has received secret orders to prepare for direct action against us. The municipal government sent a letter to the Japanese consul on the 19th, stating that China has complied with the agreement and withdrawn its defenses, and that the Second District and Sixth Precinct are Chinese police agencies. Why has the area not been returned? A formal protest has been lodged. Furthermore, a notice has been sent to all consuls, stating that China has withdrawn its defenses for two days and order has been restored. The Japanese concession not only shows no preparations for withdrawing defenses, but has tightened security. We hope all countries will pay attention. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A national reporter visited the Japanese vice-consul and informed him that the Chinese city had withdrawn its defenses and restored order. When will the Japanese settlement withdraw its defenses? Goto replied in a jocular tone, "Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the day after the day after tomorrow, I don't know." A certain Japanese secret agent from the Japanese police station, fluent in Chinese, dressed in Western clothing and went to the Chinese territory to work secretly. Returning late at night, he was mistaken for a Chinese by Japanese soldiers and beaten severely with rifle butts. After explaining, his nose was bruised and his face was swollen. Merchants in the Japanese settlement still did not open their doors on the 19th. Many large shops were flying British and American flags and moving out one after another. The French concession lifted martial law on the 18th night, and order was fully restored on the 19th. All entertainment venues reopened as usual on the 19th night. The Annam soldiers outside the Wall River had not withdrawn on the 19th. The Italian concession lifted martial law on the 19th. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Merchant Ship Carries</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Military Supplies to Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese merchant ship "Belgian Three" loaded one hundred and twenty heavy wooden boxes from the Japanese barracks in Tanggu on the 16th and unloaded them at the Japanese settlement wharf. Because there were Japanese soldiers on board, the customs was unable to prevent it. At the time, it was not known what was inside. At 3:00 PM on the 19th afternoon, the ship loaded another hundred boxes from Tanggu and unloaded them in the Japanese settlement. It has been confirmed that they are all machine guns and bullets. Another report says that the "Tiankai" ship, which was transporting a thousand boxes of military supplies from Lushun, falsely reported them as food. Customs refused to unload them, so they changed the report to exports. It has recently been decided to transport them to Tianjin again, declaring them as military supplies, using the Boxer Protocol as protection, and the customs will not be able to interfere. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Depressed Atmosphere in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Japanese Plan to Immigrate to Shenyang</p>
<p>Qi Enming Appointed Police Chief</p>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Shenyang said that the city is extremely depressed. The income of each shop is insufficient to cover the cost of food and wages of the shop assistants. However, grain prices have fallen several times. The original price of high-quality grain was one yuan two or three per dou, but it is now sold for only four or five jiao. Vegetable prices are the same as grain. In previous years, each hundred jin of Chinese cabbage cost one yuan three or four, but it is now sold for only three or four jiao. Rents have fallen sharply due to the small number of people. Important items from various agencies have long been transported away by the Japanese. And the door frames, floorboards, glass and other items, are now being dismantled and transported by the Japanese. The Japanese have recently been surveying the population and the number of empty houses, planning to move Japanese and Koreans from along the Anfeng line and the Dalian area to Shenyang. The number of clandestine prostitutes in the city has increased several times compared to before. The security of the city is maintained by self-defense police and security teams, etc. The firearms were all issued by the Japanese army. They are new guns made in our arsenal but never used. The Japanese often use the excuse of searching for firearms to confiscate important items from each household. Those who do not comply are shot. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram, Qi Enming has succeeded as the head of the puppet self-defense police bureau in Shenyang, Qi has appointed Zhang Shiying as the chief of the judicial section. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Two Isolated Armies</h3>
<p>According to news received today, Qiqihar officially fell on the evening of the 18th. The mountains and rivers are shattered, the black river weeps, and no Chinese person who hears this disastrous news should not feel grief and indignation, and weep to heaven. Alas, the three northeastern provinces have now completely fallen under the trampling iron hooves of the brutal army!</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, with an isolated army in a desolate place, guarding the border passes, facing a large and ruthless enemy, with no rescue from the front or back, with food supplies cut off, and his soldiers starving and exhausted, still encouraged his officers and soldiers to fight to the death. Leading several thousand weary and worn-out soldiers, he fought many days against tens of thousands of strong and fierce enemies, winning every battle, making the brutal army terrified at the sight of him. The battle on the 18th, in particular, was heroic and tragic, his spirit filling the rivers and mountains, forever leaving an indelible glory for our nation. This isolated army, defending the territory, fulfilling its duty, and fighting bravely, has now retreated due to exhausted ammunition and food supplies. However, our people have spontaneously destroyed their homes to assist the army, considering it to be the rebirth of Yue Fei. Even the enemy's newspapers unanimously praise General Ma's personality. How loyal and brave is General Ma!</p>
<p>However, the defeat is not Ma's fault. To resist a country with just one province, how could one not be defeated? What we find greatly incomprehensible is, what is the purpose of the nation keeping an army of two million soldiers? Heilongjiang Province is Chinese territory, and Ma Zhanshan is a Chinese soldier. To sit and watch the fall of Heilongjiang Province, to sit and watch the defeat of the isolated army, and yet not rush to rescue them, what is the purpose of one's duty? The enemy is deeply entrenched, and the situation is urgent. Is there truly not a single officer or soldier in our nation who is armed and willing to follow in General Ma's footsteps and rise up in resistance today? Or will they sit and watch the subjugation of our nation?</p>
<p>Now, the isolated army of General Ma Zhanshan, guarding Qiqihar, has already failed. Let us try to look up at Paris. The isolated army of our representative Shi Zhaoji, attending the League of Nations, is now also in an extremely difficult situation. The attitude of the League of Nations at this meeting has clearly changed. Secret agreements and complicated maneuvering are taking place. We want to argue openly based on reason, but we cannot. Considering the activities of Japanese envoys stationed in European and American countries in the short time from October 24th to November 16th, and the promotion of their news policy, everything is meticulously planned. What about our country? The domestic diplomatic function has not been effectively established, and foreign propaganda agencies have not been established. Furthermore, the posts of envoys to the United States, Germany, France, and Italy are still vacant. Today, only representative Shi Zhaoji is mediating on the international stage. Compared to the activity of the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Matsudaira, the Ambassador to Italy, Yoshida, and the Ambassador to France, Sawada, one is maneuvering freely like a dragon or tiger, while the other is trying to clap with a single hand. To issue a strong argument in the League of Nations Council like that, and yet desire to achieve diplomatic victory, how can that be achieved?</p>
<p>Today, the situation of our country in the League of Nations is extremely difficult to be optimistic about. Our representative Shi, with unwavering loyalty, exhausts his efforts, wanting to strive for the final victory on diplomacy for the country and the nation. But within the country, there is still a struggle over minor issues, unable to provide him with a backing. This isolated army, traveling far across the ocean and struggling hard, its actions are admirable, but its situation is deplorable. Without the backing of governmental strength, will the future diplomacy not repeat the disastrous defeat of the Heilongjiang army? It is not difficult for us to predict. The situation is urgent and dangerous! What we should strive for today is how to continue the spirit of General Ma to resist violence, and how to assist Representative Shi, who is in an extremely difficult situation overseas. This moment is already the last opportunity.</p>

<p>Dawes Optimistic About the Future</p>
<p>The results of today's two League of Nations meetings in Paris have only made people feel that the resolution of the Manchurian problem is still far off. Today, the thirteen members of the Administrative Council met in the afternoon, from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Shi Zhaoji presented his case for an hour, leaving the French Foreign Ministry at 7:55 PM. Yoshizawa spent one hour and fifteen minutes in the meeting answering questions about the treaties. He spoke in Japanese, which had to be translated into English and French, causing the meeting to proceed slowly. The impression gained by the League of Nations was that the Administrative Council did not feel any more enlightened at the end of this meeting than before it began. Public meetings may be held tomorrow, at which time Yoshizawa will deliver his speech. The Administrative Council has now scheduled another private meeting for 11:00 AM tomorrow. The most noteworthy point of today's meeting was the Japanese representative's proposal to send an investigation committee to Manchuria on the condition that the five basic points previously proposed are accepted. In essence, Japan is still not abandoning its original demands. The Japanese representative also suggested that this committee should have very broad powers to investigate the reported incidents and should be composed of figures with a detached position. According to Yoshizawa, the chairman of the committee should be a prominent figure beyond reproach. It is said that Yoshizawa even cited French generals such as Marshal Foch and General Weygand as the most suitable candidates for this important position. Members of the Administrative Council asked Yoshizawa many questions, intending to determine as much as possible which treaties and which provisions were relevant to the Manchurian problem, so that they could focus their attention on this and put aside other non-essential matters for the time being. The questioning was quite lengthy and tedious, but several points have been clearly disclosed. Japan does not want a new treaty that recognizes the validity of old treaties whose validity is still questionable. Japan wants China to understand, that is, to recognize the validity of existing treaties and declare the Chinese government's determination to faithfully fulfill these treaties. Because the Japanese government wants the Administrative Council to understand the root cause of the Sino-Japanese dispute, Yoshizawa will prepare a document detailing the historical facts that led to today's situation, especially the reasons why Japan insists that China earnestly acknowledge its treaty obligations. This document will be submitted to the Administrative Council in the coming days. After Dr. Shi left the meeting, people rushed to ask him about the results. Shi only replied that he had answered the Administrative Council's questions regarding the special application of the treaties to the Manchurian situation. Shi's expression was calm, but he did not appear unusually worried. Observers believe that Dr. Shi is not completely disappointed with the progress of the meeting. It is said that the Administrative Council is now seeking full information on the attitudes of both parties before making concrete plans, while also intending to take the same steps as the American representative Dawes, who is working closely with the League of Nations. It is said that Dr. Shi explained the situation in Manchuria during his speech to the Administrative Council, stating that it has become increasingly serious in the past few days, and lodged a strong protest against the bombing of Heihe by Japanese aircraft. The League of Nations Secretariat issued a statement today, including a letter from China stating that Puyi had been kidnapped. (Reuter's dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The news that Japanese troops had occupied Qiqihar caused a great stir in the League of Nations' secret talks. Tonight's secret talks are still entirely theoretical, such as the legal effect of all treaties between China and Japan, and commercial and political rights. Since the start of this morning's closed-door meeting, the representatives have felt confused about their opinions on theoretical issues, let alone anything else. Therefore, the day's discussions have made no progress in resolving the Manchurian incident itself. This morning's Council meeting adjourned at 1:07 PM, with plans to resume the meeting at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. At 4:10 PM, the twelve members of the Council gathered, preparing many questions for the Japanese representative Yoshizawa to answer one by one. The news of the occupation of Qiqihar also arrived just as these questions were being drafted. Upon receiving this shocking news, the representatives of each country showed panic. It was later resolved to invite Yoshizawa to the meeting at 5:00 PM to explain the treaties between China and Japan in 1905, 1909, and 1919. This morning, the representatives of each country were quite unclear and held different views on how Japan had obtained commercial and political rights in Manchuria through the various treaties between China and Japan, so they had to summon representatives from both China and Japan to inquire. Therefore, at 5:15 PM, when the representatives of the Council and the Japanese representative Yoshizawa were carefully studying the treaty issues, the sounds of cannons were rumbling within Manchuria, and the area of occupation by Japan within Chinese territory suddenly expanded. A few minutes after Yoshizawa left the meeting room, Shi was invited to arrive, at 6:50 PM. Yoshizawa explained in detail to the representatives the reasons for Japan's occupation of Manchuria. He presented his case in Japanese, translated by Ito, an interpreter from the Japanese Embassy in France. When Shi arrived at the meeting, he also delivered a speech in Chinese. This was the first time that a Chinese representative had expressed his views in Chinese at a Council meeting. Shi finished his speech at 8:05 PM, and the Council announced that it would adjourn the meeting until Thursday morning. In his speech, Shi protested Japan's occupation of Qiqihar, stating that his protest was based on news reports, as his government had not yet officially provided him with this information. But in any case, he had to lodge a formal protest against the continued bombardment of the people of northern Manchuria by Japanese troops, as the Nanjing government had been constantly providing him with news of Japanese aircraft attacking various parts of northern Manchuria. While the Council members were studying the key points of the Sino-Japanese treaties, American Dawes and Japanese Matsudaira consulted for an hour. Dawes told the American Associated Press reporter that he was still optimistic about the Council, but Dawes did not explain where his optimism lay. As for what concrete resolutions the Council will have in the next two days, it is still too early to be sure. Dawes drafted a telegram to Secretary of State Stimson during the conversation, and then Dawes left the hotel to visit Simon, believing that this conversation would have important results, as Simon will return to London on Thursday. While Simon is in London, his duties will be handled by Cecil. (National News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's meeting of the League of Nations Council encountered another major obstacle. The secret meeting opened at 11:10 AM, with Chairman Briand, and the Chinese and Japanese representatives still not participating. However, the Chinese representative, Dr. Shi Zhaoji, met with the American Ambassador Dawes forty minutes before the meeting. The main reason why the Council encountered difficulties was due to the completely different interpretations of the Sino-Japanese treaties by the Chinese and Japanese representatives at yesterday's meeting. The Council members are now trying their best to find other moderate ways of mediation based on the Charter. According to most opinions, all reasonable efforts can be said to have been exhausted. If the League of Nations wants to maintain its dignity, it must invoke the strict actions of Article 16 of the Charter, which Dr. Shi has mentioned, but has not yet formally requested. There is another difficulty, namely the position of the United States. There is currently a lack of formal reports. The Council believes that the United States is the most important country both morally and politically regarding the Northeast incident. Dawes has a moral obligation to express the attitude of his government, and the Council now believes that Japan's attitude is becoming increasingly uncompromising, and that it will occupy the territory without withdrawing its troops unless its conditions for withdrawing its troops are met. Therefore, there is a greater need to ask the United States to express its attitude. Later, the secret meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM, and it was decided to reopen the meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow. There may be a public meeting tomorrow afternoon. It is now heard that the Council has formally invited Dawes to formally participate in the meeting. It is also heard that Briand made an important statement to the Associated Press before opening the secret meeting today, saying that since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese issue, he has believed that the intervention of the United States, whether acting independently or cooperating with the League of Nations, will be able to share a position and consolidate the position of the League of Nations, so that the Far East dispute can be quickly and peacefully resolved. All of this is sufficient to show the Council's recognition of the severity of the situation and the urgency of hoping that the United States will state its attitude. The League of Nations Secretariat officially denied today that Ambassador Yoshizawa had requested the Council to turn the three eastern provinces into a Japanese protectorate, saying that Yoshizawa had only repeatedly stated that Japan could not withdraw its troops until it had obtained guarantees to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, and that this guarantee must be considered appropriate only if there was a stable and strong authority in the three eastern provinces that could protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. Based on this statement, it is generally believed that Japan advocates setting up a military commander in the three eastern provinces who can be accepted by both China and Japan. Yoshizawa also formally reported to the Council today that Japan had insisted that China agree to revise some treaties that had caused doubts, so the Council's willingness to consider the entire issue of Sino-Japanese treaties can be considered a sufficient strength for Japan's demands. (National News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning's secret meeting of the Administrative Council lasted for an hour and ended without result. Briand is still waiting for the written statement that Japan promised to send to the meeting. It is difficult for the Administrative Council to have a fruitful discussion until this document is received. It has been decided to continue the secret meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow. The Administrative Council discussed the issue of a public meeting, and it is expected that this meeting may be held tomorrow afternoon. Private talks are currently still underway. (Reuter's dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Simon has been summoned back to London to attend an important cabinet meeting, so he was unable to attend this morning's Administrative Council meeting. Simon promised to return to Paris as soon as possible. Any important resolutions of the Administrative Council will have to be delayed until Simon returns. (Reuter's dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) All parties acknowledge the failure of the Administrative Council's closed-door meetings, and have been unable to make any progress on a solution. But today's closed-door meeting must have some kind of resolution, even if it cannot have any other resolution, it must have a resolution to hold a public meeting. This move alone is tantamount to admitting half of the failure, because the policy up to now has been to delay any public discussion, and not to hold a public meeting until the views of both parties can approach reconciliation. The Administrative Council seems to have to take a path that one or both parties do not want to take. At the same time, Dawes, Matsudaira, and Simon are still very active, continuing to talk, and clearly have not given up hope of achieving concrete development. (Reuter's dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji</p>
<h3>Submits Important Memorandum</h3>
<p>Contains the Declaration of the Fourth National Congress (Paris) Briand had other important domestic political affairs to deal with this morning, so he had to temporarily leave the Administrative Council. All other members of the Administrative Council, except for the Chinese and Japanese representatives, arrived at the meeting at 11:00 AM, but Briand arrived half an hour late, and the private meeting then began. The Chinese representative submitted an urgent request to the League of Nations this morning, requesting that the war be stopped immediately. The letter mentioned the Qiqihar incident and the aerial attacks by Japanese aircraft, saying that Japan was preparing to launch an aggressive attack in a short period of time, and requested that measures be taken to stop it. Dr. Shi also submitted a practical memorandum on China's position, containing the declaration of the Fourth National Congress, which was considered to be an expression of the calmness of Chinese public opinion that the Chinese government must pay attention to. Dr. Shi said that no Chinese government could absolutely accept a solution based on direct negotiations under the pressure of military occupation according to Japan's five points. Dr. Shi listed his reasons as follows: (1) The five points have nothing to do with security guarantees. If negotiations based on these five points are linked to Japan's withdrawal of troops, these five points will quickly become the political and economic extent of establishing a Japanese protectorate in Manchuria. (2) China does not want to and cannot agree to sign another Twenty-One Demands in exchange for Japan fulfilling its treaty obligations under the League of Nations Charter and the Pact of Paris. Dr. Shi spoke of efforts to seek a compromise based on Article 11 of the Charter, saying that there is no equal compromise to speak of when the withdrawal of troops is a condition for negotiations based on the five points. We must reject it. If the Administrative Council declares that it cannot do anything under Article 11 of the Charter, then we will immediately request the invocation of other articles of the League of Nations Charter. This is a matter of life and death for China. The Chinese government has entrusted China's political existence to the policy of relying on the League of Nations, so it has to test the League of Nations' ability to the extreme. If the League of Nations fails, then China will openly blame the major powers for disregarding the maintenance of the Charter. Dr. Shi concluded by saying that today Chinese public opinion is gradually becoming stronger, and its patience is also gradually running out. Dr. Shi also sent a letter to the League of Nations, mentioning the discrepancies between the Chinese and Japanese reports, reiterating the request that the Administrative Council quickly dispatch a neutral committee to investigate the truth.

<p>Acting Representative Yan</p>
<h3>Issues Statement in the United States</h3>
<p>China Does Not Want to Start Direct Negotiations Until the Puppet Government in the Eastern Provinces is Abolished</p>
<p>(Washington) China's new Acting Representative Yan Heling stated today that even after Japan withdraws its troops, China does not want to start direct negotiations with Japan, because the Japanese have already established a puppet government in the three eastern provinces, and China will only be willing to negotiate with Japan after such governments are driven out. The current military and diplomatic situation between China and Japan is very complicated, and seeking a solution will involve endless negotiations. China will ask the International Court of Justice in The Hague or an international committee to resolve the disputes over treaty relations between China and Japan.

<p>Briand</p>
<h3>Invites Dawes to Attend</h3>
<p>(Paris) Briand personally visited American Ambassador Dawes this afternoon and formally invited him to participate in the Council's discussions. It is also heard that Briand has suggested to the Council that if the meeting on Friday still fails to find a peaceful solution, the Council should immediately proceed to interpret Articles 15 and 16 of the Charter. According to the results of this move, the issue of sanctions can be decided. It is learned that Briand plans to visit Dawes again in the evening to inquire about the extent to which the United States can cooperate in an economic blockade against Japan and obtain a definite answer.

<p>British House of Commons</p>
<h3>Pays Attention to the Situation in the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>The British House of Commons in London inquired about Puyi's whereabouts today. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden replied that according to the reports received, Puyi had traveled from Tianjin to Shenyang, but this could not be confirmed. As for whether there was a plan to establish an independent government in Manchuria, it could not be determined either. According to what he had heard, the governments of Liaoning and Jilin provinces had collapsed after the September 18th incident, and temporary committees are now acting on their behalf. A member of parliament asked the government to give the House of Commons an opportunity to debate the British government's attitude towards Manchuria as soon as possible. Eden replied that Foreign Secretary Simon is currently in Paris attending the League of Nations Administrative Council and will make a statement to the House of Commons when possible. Labour Party leader Lansbury stated at a meeting in London today that the way to resolve the Manchurian dispute is for the League of Nations to warn China and Japan that any party that refuses to peacefully resolve its dispute will be punished. After all kinds of conventions have already been signed, is there still hope for mankind if such a problem cannot be resolved peacefully? (Reuter's dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3>Secret Diplomacy with Japan</h3>
<p>Declares No Suggestions Were Made (Washington) Today, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson issued a formal statement, declaring that the United States had only advised China and Japan to resolve the dispute by peaceful means, and had not made any suggestions to China or Japan, nor had it received any proposals from China or Japan. He believed that the attitude of the League of Nations Council was also to maintain the principle of peace, and hoped that the League of Nations could eliminate the Sino-Japanese dispute on the basis of peace. The United States has not assumed any obligations. Stimson also denied the Washington dispatch in the New York Chronicle Tribune two days ago, which stated that a movement to bind China to unequal consular jurisdiction treaties was currently underway, stating that Japan's refusal to withdraw its troops could not be immediately linked to the United States' refusal to impose an economic or diplomatic blockade against Japan. According to the Chronicle Tribune, before the League of Nations meeting on Monday, the State Department had assured the Japanese ambassador that the United States would absolutely not support the League of Nations imposing an economic or diplomatic blockade against Japan. It was believed that Japan's failure to comply with the Council's resolution to withdraw its troops was due to obtaining this assurance. Therefore, it was also said that the United States had engaged in secret diplomacy when recently advising China and Japan to resolve the dispute peacefully. Therefore, Stimson declared that the United States had not assumed any mission, and strongly refuted the above rumors. (National News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Russian Government</p>
<h3>Watches Developments Quietly</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Japanese military's occupation of Qiqihar has suddenly attracted great attention in the Russian capital. The Russian government has not yet formally expressed its opinion on the Japanese military's occupation of Heihe, but those with inside information predict that Soviet Russia will ask Japan to explain its reasons for seemingly disregarding its guarantees to Russia. It is said that Soviet Russia is extremely eager to avoid getting involved in the whirlpool, but the trend of events will largely depend on whether the Japanese can reconcile their infringement on the territory of the China Eastern Railway with the Japanese government's previous promise not to invade the sphere of influence of Soviet Russia (National News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Various Commentaries in French Newspapers</h3>
<p>From Supporting Japan to Suddenly Opposing Japan (Paris) The French side was optimistic yesterday, but recent developments in Manchuria have made them shift from optimism to uneasiness. Newspaper criticism is very anxious. The Paris Morning Post said that the development in the meeting was frustrated by the Japanese staff department. The Paris Daily News said that the solution that could satisfy the British and Americans was for Japan to maintain the dignity of the original treaty on the one hand, and to announce its willingness to have the League of Nations help send a committee to Manchuria to inspect the situation. The Little Parisian newspaper said that both parties should be responsible, but Japan's attitude was not moderate, which was regrettable. The Paris Echo had a different opinion, saying that it was a fundamental mistake to allow China to join the League of Nations, because China did not have clearly demarcated borders and could not fulfill its international obligations. (Reuter's dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since yesterday, the most significant statement here on the Manchurian incident has been the sudden change from pro-Japanese public opinion to anti-Japanese public opinion. Yesterday, the newspapers were still enthusiastically supporting Japan, but this morning they changed their tune and criticized the Japanese policies in Manchuria and in Paris. Even the most pro-Japanese Paris Morning Post joined in, condemning Yoshizawa as stubborn and inflexible, saying that the breakdown of negotiations was purely due to the domineering Yoshizawa overriding his colleague, the ambassador to the UK, Matsudaira, who wanted to take a compromise attitude and advocated cooperation with the League of Nations. The reason why the French newspapers attacked in this way seems to be that Yoshizawa initially refused to attend the secret meeting last night, and after much persuasion, delayed for another half an hour before arriving. Once there, he only read a confusing statement and did not comfort the angry mood of the council members. However, the emotions of all parties seem to have eased slightly this morning. It is heard that Yoshizawa has submitted a plan to Briand, and some concessions have been made in terms of technology. It is now hoped that this plan can serve as the basis for continued negotiations, so that a final agreement can be reached. It is heard that this plan is for the League of Nations to send a committee to the three eastern provinces. Chinese representative Shi has now indicated to people that he has received instructions from Nanjing that if the League of Nations cannot make a quick decision, then he will propose Articles 15 and 16 of the Charter. If the League of Nations still refuses to sanction Japan, then China will immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. (National News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry Protests</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Demands Conditions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding Honjo Shigeru's presentation of three conditions to Ma Dai, chairman of Heilongjiang Province, according to the instructions of the Japanese government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government on the 18th. In addition to telegraphing Minister Jiang in Japan to directly present the protest to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a copy was also sent to Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to the report from Ma Zhanshan, chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, presented three conditions at 8:00 AM on November 15, according to the instructions of the Japanese government, requiring them to be confirmed and implemented within ten days from November 15, and to be answered by noon on November 16. The Chinese government is very surprised that Commander Honjo Jiang has repeatedly made unreasonable demands to Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province, and this time the conditions he put forward even stated that they were according to the instructions of the Japanese government. The Chinese government, of course, has the right to freely deploy its troops within Chinese territory, and what right does the Japanese government have to interfere? The Tao'ang railway line is entirely a railway operated by China. What right does the Japanese government have to interfere with the operation of the railway? The Chinese government has repeatedly pointed out to the Japanese government the illegality of the Japanese military's actions and the seriousness of the Japanese government's responsibility in this incident in Heilongjiang, and has also stated that if the Japanese military continues to attack, China will still adopt necessary self-defense measures. It is hereby further declared to the Japanese government that if the Japanese military disregards everything and causes all actions arising from forcibly ordering the Chinese military to implement its unreasonable conditions, the Japanese government should still bear full responsibility for it. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bu Kui telegram, on the 15th, Honjo's representative Shiraya presented a letter of request to our side, ordering the Jiang province army to immediately withdraw from the area north of Qiqihar, answering our side, requesting that both China and Japan withdraw at the same time, and the Japanese side did not accept our side's answer, and verbally requested that the Jiang province should immediately declare independence, break away from the central government, and establish a maintenance association, and if it is not approved, the Japanese army will still attack, etc., please telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as soon as possible, and forward it to Minister Jiang, and seriously protest to the Japanese government to stop Shiraya from making such requests, because recently, in addition to Lieutenant Colonel Hayashi, who claimed to be Honjo's representative, there was also Shiraya, and in addition to Hayashi and Shiraya, there were several other people, whose only task was to take turns intimidating Ma orally (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Reply to Russian Note</h3>
<p>Strong Words and Sophistry (Tokyo) The Japanese government recently sent a note to the Soviet Russian government, stating Japan's attitude towards the China Eastern Railway, saying that the railway assisted the transportation of Chinese soldiers from east and west to Qiqihar and Ang'angxi, so the railway must bear part of the responsibility if serious conflicts occur between China and Japan in northern Manchuria. The note was a reply to the Soviet Russian note, which stated that certain military circles in Manchuria are now arbitrarily engaged in anti-Soviet movements in order to disturb the relationship between Japan and Russia. The Japanese reply was drafted before the recent military conflict between China and Japan, but it was not sent until yesterday. The text denied the Soviet Russian claim that Japanese personnel deliberately fabricated rumors that Soviet Russia was assisting General Ma Zhanshan, and continued that the Japanese government firmly believed that these rumors must have been spread by Chinese officials in Heilongjiang in order to encourage the army and make them believe that Russia was prepared to provide assistance. Therefore, Japan believed that if the Moscow authorities truly maintained a strict policy of non-interference, they should question the Chinese officials. In the past, during the Sino-Russian war, Japan strictly maintained neutrality and rejected China's request to use the South Manchuria Railway to transport troops. Japan hoped that Soviet Russia would also take a cautious attitude towards the current dispute, as Japan did in the past, and finally made a clear statement that Japan would pay attention to not harming Soviet Russian interests, and Soviet Russia should also issue a declaration stating that it had not supplied Chinese troops with weapons and ammunition. (Reuter's dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has ordered the Japanese ambassador to Moscow to give Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov a friendly warning, saying that serious disputes will occur if Soviet Russia sends troops to northern Manchuria. At the same time, it also ordered the ambassador to declare to the Soviet Russian authorities that yesterday's battle did not damage the China Eastern Railway. (Reuter's dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Summoning International Silver Price Conference</h3>
<p>British Chancellor Believes It Is Unnecessary</p>
<p>Cotton Industry Groups Express Opinions</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, London, 18th dispatch: Yesterday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons that the British government does not intend to convene an international silver price conference in the short term. All sectors of British society attach great importance to the issue of silver price recovery, and there was some surprise upon hearing the news. The organ of the Manchester Guidance Newspaper Cotton Industry Group stated that Lancashire industrialists regretted learning of the government's decision. For six years, the price of silver has risen more than the pound sterling, and British trade with China therefore has the hope of restoring to its former state. It is a pity that the price of silver fluctuates greatly, reaching as much as three and a half pence last Saturday. With this, hoping for economic recovery is inevitable, which is difficult to achieve. Previously, the International Chamber of Commerce organized a committee to study the silver price issue. Recently, the committee submitted a report advocating stabilizing the silver price, stating that an agreement should be concluded between the silver factory owners in the United States and Mexico and the Indian government, which sells a lot of silver. Silver factory owners and sellers can consult automatically without the intervention of the British government, but from our point of view, the British government has no reason not to propose consultation. The reason is that there is no theory of adopting bi-metalism, and the proposal to restore the silver price before the war is not a problem. The current urgent task is only to stabilize the price of silver. In the opinion of the Lancashire industrial community, the importance of this move is only second to the stability of the price of the pound sterling and is unmatched by other matters. The newspaper hopes that the representatives of the Lancashire industrial community will continue to resolutely request the National Cabinet in order to obtain satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>Narcotics Trafficking Case Opens Trial</h3>

<p>(10)</p>
<p>Significant amount of time inquiring about a Greek man with mysterious whereabouts. This man is called Ance Sobro and instructed a doctor named Hansche to carry out various activities. The court must investigate this. This Greek man is still a mysterious figure. The court then investigated the case of private trafficking of 716 kilograms of heroin, which Dr. Hansche sold to strangers, and the buyers did not carry licenses to sell narcotics. Dr. Hansche firmly denied selling heroin, saying that he only sold some morphine, which is not prohibited by law, but one package of this drug was chemically tested by customs and confirmed to be heroin rather than morphine. Dr. Hansche said that the customs chemical test was wrong and that he did not receive heroin at Müller's home. What he took at the time were drugs that were not subject to inspection. The experts said that Dr. Hansche's laboratory in Geneva was very simple and could not manufacture large-scale chemical products. There must be another wholesaler in contact with him. Just as the court was about to adjourn, a strange thing happened. A well-known merchant in Basel has been paying attention to this case in the newspapers every day. On this day, he suddenly reported to the court that he had been in constant contact with Anstad Sobro Company in Patras City for several years, so he was willing to provide the court with all necessary information. However, according to the report of the Patras City Police in Greece, no one named Anstad Sobro was found there. The words of the Basel merchant are also very strange.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Invasion of Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Although the Japanese army claims not to invade northern Manchuria after occupying Liaoning and Jilin, their ambitions are actually very strong. They must encompass the three provinces before they will be satisfied. Previously, they instigated Zhang Haipeng, the Garrison Commander of Taoliao, to invade Jiang Province. This is solid proof of their intention to invade northern Manchuria. The Japanese are using Zhang Haipeng to seize power in Jiang Province, intending to divide the entire Northeast, to achieve their so-called "Manchuria-Korea as One" plan. Zhang Haipeng was initially blinded by profit and willing to be used by the Japanese. On October 15th, he advanced his troops to Tailai. The Jiang Province authorities, in order to avoid the scourge of war, not only dispatched considerable forces to defend along the Nenjiang River, and dismantled several spans of the Harge Jiang Bridge to prevent Zhang from advancing, but also sent representatives to meet with Zhang, explaining the greater meaning of the situation. Zhang, also aware of internal divisions and the bombing of his key personnel (his commander, Mr. Xu), and the unreliability of the Japanese, slightly awakened. He withdrew his troops stationed in Tailai back to Taonan. The Japanese, seeing this, became very angry and immediately detained Zhang's family members in Taonan, forcing Zhang to actively advance his troops and seize Jiang Province. On the other hand, using the pretext of repairing the Jiang Bridge, they actually implemented troop advancement on November 3rd. The details of the Japanese army's advancement are recorded day by day as follows: On October 28th, the Nenjiang Harge Jiang Bridge was damaged in several spans to prevent Zhang and others from advancing north. The Japanese Consul in Jiang Province, Mr. Shimizu, notified the Jiang Province authorities on this day, stating that the Tao'an Railway had a loan relationship with the South Manchuria Railway, and the dismantled Jiang Bridge should be repaired by the South Manchuria Railway Company. The Jiang Province Standing Committee immediately rejected the Japanese's unreasonable request, stating that the Japanese request was unreasonable.</p>
<p>On November 2nd, at 10 a.m., Japanese Consul Shimizu and Major Hayashi Yoshio, a representative of the Kwantung Army Headquarters, again visited Ma Zhanshan regarding the Jiang Bridge incident. They claimed to have received instructions from their government and the Kwantung Army Commander, stating that the Tao'an Railway had a loan relationship with the South Manchuria Railway and should be repaired by the South Manchuria Railway. They also planned to use military force to protect the work. Ma refuted this, stating that the South Manchuria Railway Bureau only had a creditor relationship with the Tao'an Railway. A creditor cannot repair a project on behalf of a debtor. Moreover, the Tao'an Railway was not under the jurisdiction of the Jiang Province government and could not agree to be repaired by the South Manchuria Railway. He would notify the Tao'an Railway Bureau to repair it themselves and not trouble the Japanese to interfere. The Japanese Consul and Major Hayashi still insisted on not agreeing, saying that it must be repaired by the Japanese. They also proposed four conditions: (1) The Nenjiang Bridge must not be used for war. (2) By noon on November 3rd, both the northern and southern armies must withdraw fifteen kilometers from the bridge. (3) The distance of the location, before the repair is completed, the two armies are not allowed to invade its territory. Once the repair is completed, the two armies will be notified again. (4) If the above requirements are not agreed to or hindered, it will be regarded as hostile to the Japanese army, and free action will be taken. At 4 p.m. that afternoon, two Japanese planes scouted the Jiang Bridge and Daxing Station area twice and dropped many leaflets.</p>
<p>On November 3rd, at 11 a.m., the Japanese army arrived at the Jiang Bridge with two armored trains, thirty soldiers, over a hundred South Manchuria Railway workers, and five planes, implementing the repair of the Jiang Bridge with military force. In order to avoid conflict, our army withdrew the few troops stationed at the Jiang Bridge to Daxing Station, fifteen kilometers away. However, when our army withdrew, the Japanese army threw a large number of bombs from the planes, injuring nine of our soldiers. At about 10 p.m., more than a hundred Japanese soldiers crossed the Jiang Bridge to the front line of our army, launching a fierce attack on us and throwing several bombs, injuring seven of our soldiers. After about two hours, because our side sought to avoid conflict and did not resist, the Japanese army retreated.</p>
<p>On November 4th, at 5 a.m., Major Hayashi of the Japanese army, accompanied by Mr. Hayazaki, a secretary from the Japanese Consulate, requested to go to the defense area of our army stationed at Daxing Railway Station to speak to our army. Shi Lanbin, Chief of Staff of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, agreed. At 8:10 a.m., they went to Harge Jiang Bridge from Jiang Province. Major Hayashi first addressed the Japanese soldiers west of the bridge. When Chief of Staff Shi was addressing our army, he forced Shi to sign a document admitting the withdrawal of our army and ordering its immediate execution. Chief of Staff Shi immediately refused, saying that he was the Chief of Staff of the 3rd Infantry Brigade and only a part of the staff. He could not order other troops in Jiang Province. Moreover, our soldiers were responsible for protecting the territory and overseas Chinese, which was legitimate defense, and others had no need to interfere. During the negotiations, Japanese soldiers had already advanced to our defense line and captured three of our soldiers. Although Chief of Staff Shi repeatedly negotiated based on reason, the result was that they were not released. It was heard from railway workers that the three soldiers captured by the Japanese had been killed by the Japanese army. On the same day, more than three hundred Japanese soldiers took advantage of the early morning fog to launch a fierce attack on our army. Our army did not engage with them. Unexpectedly, five Japanese planes again dropped six bombs on our army, injuring several soldiers and destroying Daxing Railway Station. Our army could no longer bear it and had to resort to legitimate defense. At 6 p.m., the Japanese army again used artillery fire to cover four thousand Japanese soldiers crossing the river, with dozens of mountain guns, seven planes, and four armored trains, advancing to Daxing Railway Station and launching a fierce attack on our army. Our officers and soldiers resisted to the death and were not subdued. Until dusk, the Japanese army's artillery fire continued unabated. Our army suffered more than five hundred casualties. The Jiang Province authorities, considering that the Daxing position was difficult to defend, ordered a retreat to Sanjianfang Railway Station (thirty miles from Daxing) at 2 p.m. on the 6th to defend the position. From the afternoon of the 6th, the Japanese army continued to attack us. (16th)</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Warns Against Violent Japan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's editorial in The Great American Evening News stated: "The reporter does not want to argue about defining war. Today, perhaps some still believe that there is no war in the three northeastern provinces, but from our perspective, there is already a war, and not a small-scale one. Ma Zhanshan, unafraid of a powerful enemy, has stepped forward to fight. Although he has not fought against the entire nation of Japan, he has already clashed with a part of the Japanese army and shown his good skills. We think that Ma's actions this time may cause the Japanese Empire to spend a huge amount of treasury funds. Japan can still not declare war on China, not declare war on General Ma. Japan can still call its dangerous and fortunate actions in the three northeastern provinces a business of maintaining peace, continuing to import its rifles, cannons, bombing planes, and other tools to maintain peace and order, until all the Chinese people in the three northeastern provinces are pacified and none are left, or all the Japanese residents in the three northeastern provinces are pacified and none are left, or both sides are severely injured, like tigers fighting in a village. From our perspective, perhaps the Japanese can do this. Today's situation seems that only the League of Nations can intervene to prevent the situation from erupting. However, the League of Nations seems to be in a difficult situation, at a loss and not knowing what to do. Soviet Russia is China's closest neighbor, but even if China-Russia relations are strong, we believe that Soviet Russia has sufficient common sense and thrift and is unwilling to participate in such a wasteful feast. Moreover, China and Russia have not yet resumed diplomatic relations. Japan can do whatever it wants at this time, but we really hope that it awakens from its delusion and examines reality. Even if it is late, it is not too late. If Japan does this, it is not pacifying the Northeast, but provoking the Northeast. It is not enough to protect Japanese residents, but makes the situation of Japanese residents more difficult. It is also not a way to increase the income of the South Manchuria Railway, but enough to promote its reduction. In short, Japan has made a big mistake. The only plan now is to clear the accounts, write off all previous events, practice the promises under the League of Nations Charter and the Anti-War Pact, and withdraw its troops. However, even if the Japanese hurry to withdraw their troops, it is still unknown whether this kind of tangled situation can be resolved satisfactorily after a long time of sorting out. If not, then we know that the stubbornness of the Japanese will cause huge losses to their own country and to the whole world."</p>
<h3>Three-Year Economic Plan</h3>
<p>▲ Chiang's Speech at the National Economic Council. At the first meeting of the National Economic Council held at the National Government on the 15th of this month, Chairman Chiang made an important report explaining the three-year economic plan. The full text of the speech is supplemented below: "Today is the inaugural meeting of the National Economic Council. On behalf of the council, I sincerely welcome all the committee members. The purpose of the establishment of this council is well known to all of you and need not be repeated. However, some of you may not be familiar with the work plan. I would like to explain the important points to all of you. The most important task of this council in the first phase is to set a three-year plan. Based on the various tasks that can develop the national economy, we will select the most needed ones and implement them in the near future, depending on the national financial resources. The first step is to select several of the most needed tasks and compile them into a definite plan. The second step is to identify the interrelationships of each plan and their communication methods. The third step is to determine their order of priority. Finally, we will determine a plan for the equal development of work within the three-year period. It will be implemented earnestly starting from the 21st year of the Republic of China. Regarding the financial aspect, it should first be decided by the Finance Committee recently established by the National Government how much funds the government can allocate each year for this construction. Then, this council will allocate the use of these funds. In addition to preparing the above-mentioned three-year plan, the current work of this council is to discuss the opinions contributed by various parties at any time, whether they are central, local, public or private organizations, or Chinese and foreign industrial, commercial, and financial institutions. All proposals will be studied by this council at any time and opinions will be expressed to collect the benefits of broad thinking. The existing proposals that can be used for the committee members to study are the guidance of the Huai River, land reclamation, the development of the Port of Greater Shanghai, the paving of the Nanjing-Shanghai automobile road, and the improvement of farmland, etc. Other industrial development plans that should be promoted by the government will also be submitted to this council for research and implementation. The second phase of the council's work is to determine a larger plan, planning the path that our country should follow in the development of the next ten years or so. The development of our country's industry should seek to be suitable for natural resources and local conditions. Therefore, the second phase of the plan should be based on the natural development of this industry, and the development of education and health systems should be used as a complementary element, with practical communication. The council is currently planning to expand the organization of the current preparatory office and recruit specialized talents in engineering, agriculture, health, education, and other fields to establish a strong secretariat. The secretariat of this council must not only be able to plan various tasks and submit them to this council for research and review, but also be able to take responsibility for assisting in the supervision of the implementation of the plan. Therefore, the selection of this personnel is very important. Furthermore, this council has agreed on cooperation methods with the technical departments of the League of Nations. Dr. Rajchman, the Director of the Health Section of the League of Nations, has stayed in China for several weeks and has made many plans for the technical cooperation between our country and the League of Nations. This council is very grateful for this. In the first month of the coming year, Mr. Haas, the Director of the Communications Section of the League of Nations, will also come to China to assist in the progress of all construction work of this council. I firmly believe that after the establishment of this council, all committee members will be able to express their honest opinions and jointly seek the progress of domestic construction undertakings. The future of the party and the country truly depends on this."</p>
<h3>Surveying of the Huai River Embankment Project</h3>
<p>▲ Two Teams Separately Survey the Upper and Lower Reaches ▲ North and South Embankments to be Built Simultaneously Bengbu Correspondence: The National Government Relief Flood Relief Association previously considered that the floods in the Huai River area in northern Anhui were particularly severe. In order to treat both the symptoms and the root causes, it purchased a large amount of American wheat and organized work relief. On the one hand, it repaired the Huai River embankment, and requested the Huai River Guidance Committee to dispatch surveying teams to conduct on-site sectional surveys. A few days ago, Sheng Dechun, the leader of the first surveying team of the Huai River embankment project, departed from Fengtai with his team to survey the upper reaches of the Huai River. He has surveyed to the Xiashankou and is currently surveying the Xifei River area. However, the bandit atmosphere is very strong in the upper reaches of the Fei River and above Zhengyangguan. It is not yet known whether it can be surveyed further forward. Yin Chengzhi, the leader of the second team, departed from Huaiyuan with his team to survey the lower reaches of the Huai River. Yesterday, they surveyed through Xinjiawan in Hebei, and have now surveyed to the Mo River Estuary in Fengyang County. They will soon survey to Linhuai Pass. It is recently heard that the National Government Relief Flood Relief Association still has a surplus after the distribution of relief food in northern Anhui. It plans to use work relief to build the south embankment at the same time as repairing the north embankment of the Huai River, to show equality and avoid regrets. A surveying team will soon be dispatched to survey the south bank of the Huai River and start construction on a regular basis. (18th)</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's Beijing correspondence, involving Mr. Zheng Yanzuo, according to Mr. Zheng, has been operating a business in this port and has not gone elsewhere. The previous statement was a miscommunication. This is hereby corrected. Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Male and Female Double Suicide in Gongwei Hotel. The Gongwei Hotel on Gongyuan Road in the city received two people claiming to be Shanghai travelers, Gu Quansheng and a woman named Cai, on the afternoon of the 16th. They rented room number 19 and paid a dollar for the room. On the 18th, Gu Quansheng asked the tea room attendant, Guo A-Quan, where the post office was. After explaining the location, Gu was seen mailing a letter to Gu Xiutang in Songjiang. At the time, no one thought it was strange. Unexpectedly, at noon on the 19th, the travelers had not yet gotten up. They entered the room to check and saw the man and woman sleeping together, head to head, with cloth strips around their necks, appearing to have hanged themselves. They immediately reported to the Tu Zheng, Wu Shuntai, and at 5 p.m., reported to the County Court Procuratorate, requesting that someone be sent to examine the bodies.</p>
<p>Arrest of the Principal Offender in the Assault on Police and Resistance to Arrest Case. Meng Qingfa, a policeman from the 16th Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, was beaten to death by gamblers while catching gamblers in the Zhu A-Da teahouse in Yangting Town, 8th District. Two accomplices, Zhu Zhongfen and Li Gengen, have been arrested and sent to the court for questioning and detention. It is learned that Director Hua of the Public Security Bureau is paying unusual attention to this case. Recently, it was discovered that the head of the teahouse, Zhu A-Da, had secretly returned home. He secretly ordered Xue Furui, the captain of the detective team, to order detectives Shen Minhua, Zai Shouquan, etc., to lead several detectives to the countryside.</p>
<p>To ambush and arrest him, and sure enough, Zhu A-Da was arrested. He was immediately taken to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday (19th) morning, Director Hua prepared a document and transferred him to the County Court. At 4 p.m., Chief Prosecutor Zhou opened the court, questioned him, and ordered him to be detained for further questioning and investigation.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Appropriation of Funds to Aid Ma Zhanshan. Wood industry colleagues from Jiangxi and Linqing, residing in Changzhou, were greatly moved by the fact that the violent Japan had forcibly occupied Liaoning and Jilin and was now eyeing Heilongjiang. Fortunately, General Ma Zhanshan disregarded his own safety and resisted to the death, finally defeating the fierce bandits. His loyalty and courage were commendable. They held a meeting the previous night to raise funds to help. Hu Youxian, Du Jiliang, and others pledged 1,000 yuan on the spot, which was wired free of charge to Heilongjiang Province through the Bank of China on the 18th. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association also appropriated 100 yuan, and a certain teacher donated 10 yuan from his savings, which were also remitted one after another.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Examines Murder Case. In Qianjia Village, near Hengshan Town, Fifth District, Wu County, Wang Bingsheng, a native of Jiangyin, about forty years old, suddenly died in a fish shed the night before. The nearby public security authorities reported to the County Court for an examination. The supervising prosecutor led his staff to examine the body on the 18th and found no injuries on the entire body. However, there was blood in the police gate and mouth. A silver needle was used to probe the front door, and it immediately turned black. It was determined that he had died from taking poison before his death. Yang Peikun, who was watching the fish shed, was taken to the city and will be investigated to determine the cause of death and further processed.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Police Inspector Catches Gamblers, Conflicts with Civilian Police. Sun Zhili, director of the 5th Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau in Shengang, received a report on the evening of the 16th that there was gambling at Jin Yuqi's house in X溝. He immediately ordered Police Inspector Ji Hou (from Xiangxiang, Hunan) to lead ten policemen to the scene. There were only several tables of mahjong. The civilian police therefore conflicted. Police Inspector Deng was injured, and patrolmen Sun Yihua, Wu Bingsheng, and Lu Tongzhang were also beaten, and two box cannons and seventy bullets were lost. Later, Ma A-chang and eleven others were apprehended at the Ma family mat. They were sent to the county on the afternoon of the 17th and interrogated by interrogator Wu Cheng. Jin Yuqi, Jin Gengen, Lin Masheng, and Yu Maxisheng, the heads of the gambling den, were taken into custody, and Ma A-chang and the other seven were released on bail pending the apprehension of the murderer Ma Shengyao and the instigator Cao Xiangfang for legal action.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Security Office Dispatches Troops to Huashan to Suppress Bandits. Bandits have suddenly risen in Huashan Town, Da Gang City, Zhenjiang Province, causing great disturbances. The Yangzhou Pacification Supervisor, Zeng, telegraphed Director Li of the Provincial Security Office, instructing him to immediately dispatch troops to suppress the bandits. After receiving the order, Director Li specially transferred troops yesterday to seize the opportunity to suppress the bandits, so as to pacify the local area.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Order to Investigate Wrongful Imprisonment and Fraud Case. Pacification Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang, based on a report from Zhang Jibin, a citizen of Suqian County, accusing Qian Zhongkui of making false charges and dispatching troops to search and plunder property, and arresting his third younger brother Zhang Jipeng and fourth younger brother Zhang Min, detaining them in the regiment headquarters, and later demanding their release, transferred Zhang Jipeng and Zhang Min to the division headquarters, which was a wrongful imprisonment. He ordered the division commander, Zhang Huaying, to have Zhang Min, along with the plaintiff Qian Zhongkui, company commander Zhou Bingquan, all escorted to Yangzhou for interrogation to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Teachers' Salary Demand Wave Expected to be Resolved. The Education Bureau of Jiangdu, because of salary arrears and strikes, assigned representatives to sit in the bureau and demand payment. Director Jia Qiheng, Supervisor Liu Yinnan, Section Chief Zi Xiufeng, Zhang Xuanqi, etc., specially went to the county to discuss the matter with County Chief Chen Nanxuan and Finance Bureau Chief Tong Maoke yesterday (17th), and first raised 3,000 yuan to return one-third of the salary arrears, so as to maintain the current situation and hope for an early resumption of classes.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Record of a Robbery Encountered by the Jiahu Boat. The previous day (16th), the Jiahu transport boat encountered a robbery in Wangjiangjing, and fourteen passengers, both men and women, were kidnapped. This was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that four of the female passengers and three of the male passengers have escaped. It is said that the bandit gang treated those they kidnapped fairly well, providing tea, water, and food. Their behavior and words were quite gentle, seemingly different from the usual so-called kidnappers. None of the kidnapped people were from the propertied class. Most of them were shop clerks. One named Sun Zhiyu used to work in a factory but has been unemployed for many years and is in a very difficult situation. Another, surnamed Zhou, from a village outside Nanxun shed, is now employed in a foreign goods store in Shanghai. Wu Weiru is an employee of the Nanxun Fuda Money Shop, and Wu Jimei is a trainee in a factory, all of whom have meager incomes. However, it is still unclear whether they have all been released or are still in danger.</p>
<p>Wangdian Apprehends Kidnappers. Xu Jinlan, a wealthy merchant in Wangdian Town, Jiaxing, was kidnapped by bandits on the evening of October 20 at a hotel at the Tangqiao head in the town and taken onto a boat. The town's water and land police sub-boats chased after them, and the bandits abandoned the boat and fled. The kidnapped person was rescued. The Wangdian water police and public security sub-bureau apprehended the bandit suspects Zheng A-lin, Shen Huaizhong, Shi Yongsheng, Zhou A-sheng, and Ni Rongsheng five days ago and sent them to the court with a document. After interrogation, Zheng A-lin confessed to the kidnapping and was ordered to be detained. The others were released on bail because there was no strong suspicion after interrogation, pending further questioning.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Measures for Disposing of Confiscated Japanese Goods. The Hangzhou Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stated that the number of Japanese goods seized and confiscated by the association's inspection team is gradually increasing, making it difficult to store them. Therefore, it has first formulated five measures for disposing of Japanese goods that are not easily stored: (1) Luxury goods will be burned in public. (2) Food and supplies will be distributed to disaster victims. (3) Explosive items will be sent to military agencies for use. (4) Medicines will be sent to public hospitals for medical use. (5) Raw materials will be distributed to engineering colleges or domestic goods factories to manufacture finished products separately. The above measures have been approved by the provincial party department for implementation.</p>
<p>Citywide Student Fundraising to Reward the Heilongjiang Army. All sectors of Hangzhou have stated that the military affairs in Heilongjiang are expanding daily and our army has repeatedly fought against the enemy. In addition to sending telegrams to Ma Zhanshan to express condolences, various telegrams have been sent to remit funds to reward the front-line soldiers. A decision was made to raise a huge amount of money again to continue to reward them in order to encourage morale. It was decided to rush to produce 300 donation registers and send them to the Hangzhou Municipal Education Bureau to order all levels of schools to unanimously set off on the 22nd with all students to raise donations, so that all the money could be remitted to Heilongjiang to reward the Heilongjiang army.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Pushing Sales of "Yinmen," Another Bloodshed Incident. The Tongfuchang and ten other fish shops in Ningbo previously purchased 240 pieces of "Sammon" from the British firm Anli Foreign Company in Shanghai, which were transported to Ningbo by the Xinjiangtian wheel. Because the public mistakenly thought it was Japanese fish, a major dispute occurred. After investigation by party and government agencies, it was learned that it was produced in Russia and allowed to be sold. The Tongfuchang goods store immediately set up a sales office in front of the Tianhou Palace in the city and hired Xiang Lianseng as the director of the sales office and Chen Ji as the legal advisor of the office. Until yesterday afternoon, patriotic workers He Shichang and others stated that the "Sammon" was very similar to Japanese fish, making it difficult for the public to identify it, which hindered anti-Japanese work. Therefore, they posted slogans everywhere urging people not to buy Japanese fish. When these slogans were posted near the sales area, they were seen by the store clerks, who reported it to the manager of the Tongfuchang store. The manager believed that the slogans posted by He Shichang and others, urging people not to buy Japanese fish, greatly impacted the sales of "Sammon." He immediately ordered the store clerks to use iron tools, wooden sticks, etc., to beat and injure He Shichang and others. He's head was broken by an iron tool, and he bled a lot. At that time, the audience believed that what the Tongfuchang fish store and others were selling was "Sammon" and that the slogans posted by He Shichang clearly stated Japanese fish. The store manager came out to interfere, which was tantamount to admitting that what he bought was Japanese fish. As a result, the crowd was greatly outraged and swarmed to the front of the sales office, smashing the signboard and throwing it into the river. The management personnel of the office knew that they had aroused public anger and fled one after another. Xiang, the director of the sales office, and Chen, the lawyer, were also denounced as profit-hungry running dogs.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Associations of Various Universities</h3>
<p>Donations to Aid Heilongjiang Yesterday Were Very Successful ▲ Over 10,000 People Departed from More Than 30 Schools</p>
<p>▲ Economic Committee to Meet Today to Discuss Methods</p>
<p>Emergency Cadre Meeting Convened This Afternoon</p>
<p>The United Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of students from various universities in this city, after a resolution passed by the representative assembly on the 17th of this month to hold a general fundraising and publicity campaign on the 19th and 20th, immediately notified all schools to actively prepare. According to investigations, approximately 30 schools with a total of over 10,000 people departed yesterday. Each team consisted of about 10 people, carrying their respective school flags and symbols, intercepting passersby along the way, and soliciting donations. Those who donated were very enthusiastic, so yesterday's results were quite good. The donation cards were printed with the words "Shanghai University Students' United Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association thanks the soldiers of Heilongjiang." Those who donated between 20 cents and one yuan were given a white card, and those who donated more than one yuan were given a yellow card. How the funds raised will be handled and remitted to the Northeast is still under serious consideration. Therefore, it has been decided to convene the Economic Committee at 10:00 AM today (the 20th) to discuss various methods. Attendees will be from the School of Law and Political Science, Soochow University, Shanghai University, Jinan University, Great China University, Guanghua University, China Public School, and other schools. It is also heard that the 17th Emergency Cadre Meeting will be held at 1:00 PM today to discuss all important pending matters, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Notice from the United Association: To whom it may concern, it is hereby announced that an emergency representative assembly will be held at 2:00 PM on the 20th of this month to discuss serious current affairs matters. It is hoped that your school's representative will attend on time without delay. Respectfully addressed to all school anti-Japanese national salvation associations.</p>
<p>▲ Statement from the United Association: To whom it may concern, having read in your newspaper that the 12th representative assembly of this association rescinded the resolution on the cadre committee and the suspension of classes, and that the publicity and fundraising were done in spare time, this is completely inconsistent with the facts. This is likely a mistake by the reporter from the Kuomintang News Agency. An investigation shows that items 2 and 3 of the resolution of the 12th representative assembly of this association were for the suspension of classes for publicity and fundraising on the 19th and 20th, and there was no rescission of the suspension of classes. This letter is specially sent to request a correction. Respectfully addressed to the chief editor of Shen Bao, Shanghai University Students' United Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>

<p>▲ Resolutions (1) On how to prepare for a city-wide middle school student rally to urge the government to recover lost territory: Resolved that, because the request to the Party and government organs to convene a city-wide general assembly of all middle school students has not been approved, it is difficult to hold it for the time being. (2) On how the association members should assist the Mingde Middle School fundraising team after it was unreasonably insulted by lawyer Ding Zhengjun: Resolved that staff should be sent to investigate first. If it is true, the association should take the following two measures: A. Send a letter to the Bar Association requesting that it immediately publish a warning to Ding Zhengjun in the newspaper; B. Send a letter to various circles of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for joint handling. (3) On the city-wide middle schools holding a large-scale fundraising for national salvation funds: Resolution passed, stipulating the following measures: A. The detailed fundraising methods are to be determined by each school; B. Fundraising should be completed within two weeks, starting next week. (4) On the fact that the middle school volunteer armies have decided to hold a general inspection on December 1st, and the deadline is approaching, the schools should be notified to intensify military training: Resolution passed.</p>
<h3>Various Schools Donate to Ma Zhanshan in Support of Anti-Japanese Efforts</h3>
<p>▲ Jinan University All teachers, students, and staff of the National Jinan University were moved by General Ma's brave fight against the invaders and unanimously made donations. Yesterday, a telegram was sent, stating: "Chairman Ma Zhanshan of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, your meritorious service in standing firm despite the invasion by the tyrannical Japanese has been deeply felt throughout the country. General, though far away in the remote wilderness, your lone army defies the enemy at the border, your prestige shines, and the enemy's courage is chilled. Not only does the entire country admire you, but you have also brought glory to our nation. The entire school, gazing afar, has nothing to offer in tribute. Therefore, we have collected a small sum and will immediately wire two thousand yuan to reward the troops and express our humble intentions. We hope that the General will continue to make persistent efforts, kill all the enemies, glorify our Chinese spirit, and secure our borders. Your loyal servant, National Jinan University, all teachers, students, and staff, two thousand people, respectfully send our greetings."</p>
<p>▲ Fudan University The students of this university sent an urgent telegram, stating: "To all newspaper offices and elders, brothers, and sisters throughout the country: The Japanese bandits have invaded and occupied our land for no reason, slaughtering our people. Our country has repeatedly made concessions, but they have taken an inch and want a mile. Right and wrong are clearly distinguished. The United States is the country that upholds the Washington Treaty and initiated the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If it still holds true to justice, how should it speak out and take effective measures to punish the Japanese bandits and maintain world peace? However, after reading the newspaper, we learned that the United States actually compromised with the Japanese bandits and proposed a so-called 'conciliation plan,' hoping that China would make further concessions. This is absurd and outrageous. The imperialists' intention to conspire to harm us is already clearly revealed. All of our citizens should now be truly aware and seek liberation through self-reliance. We vow to oppose all so-called conciliation plans and any policies involving the partition and joint control of China until our last breath. The future of the nation truly depends on this. The Shanghai Fudan University Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association respectfully sends our greetings."</p>
<p>▲ Nanyang Business College All teachers and students of the Nanyang Senior Commercial Middle School launched a donation campaign to provide military pay for the brave soldiers of Heilongjiang. The previous day, they entrusted 200 yuan to the local Life Weekly magazine to remit on their behalf. Yesterday, the students continued to pledge donations, reaching another 200 yuan. It is heard that the school also telegraphed the Fourth National Congress in Nanjing, requesting the government to quickly send Zhang Fakui's entire army to aid Heilongjiang. The telegram briefly stated, "This can not only live up to General Ma's loyalty but also fulfill Commander Zhang's ambition." The words were extremely tragic and sincere.</p>
<p>▲ Jiaotong University Jiaotong University sent a telegram, stating: "Chairman Ma of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, you have repeatedly defeated the Japanese bandits and demonstrated your public loyalty. We respectfully collect funds from teachers and students and together present a cup of water to the soldiers, donating 1,500 yuan to help with military pay, to be remitted through the Bank of China, to boost morale, and await the triumphant return. All faculty, staff, and students of Shanghai Jiaotong University respectfully send our greetings."</p>
<h3>Fudan Students Prepare to Go to the Northeast</h3>
<p>Fudan University The entire student body, filled with righteous indignation and boiling with passion, felt that the tyrannical Japanese had long occupied Liaoning and Jilin and were now trying to seize Heilongjiang. They felt particularly tragic and moving towards Ma Zhanshan's lone army resisting with all its strength, and they were eager to rise up. More than 20 students, including Gu Degang and Yang Qingxie, met last night to discuss and prepare for the plan to aid Ma. As soon as preparations are complete, they will depart for the Northeast, vowing to kill the great enemy together with their blood. Other students will go to various districts to give publicity speeches.</p>

<h3>National Salvation Association Raises Funds to Assist General Ma</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Teachers and Staff Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, believing that General Ma Zhanshan is loyal and brave in defending the country and avenging the humiliation of his compatriots, held its third executive committee meeting on the 18th of this month and decided to raise funds for assistance. The measures are extracted as follows: Announce in the newspaper to all teachers and staff of public and private schools at all levels in this city to donate 3% of one month's salary to assist General Ma Zhanshan. All funds should be remitted by each school directly to Qiqihar, Heilongjiang, before the 25th of this month, and the amount remitted should be notified to this association for compilation and public announcement in the newspaper. All schools are requested to proceed with this fundraising and assistance immediately. Signed by Executive Committee members Huang Zaoxiong, Zhou Feicheng, Wu Xiu, Wang Dingcheng, Chen Jicheng, Wang Junyao, Dai Yuheng, Zheng Shaoqing, Zhang Zaibo, Cheng Minkai, Feng Fusheng, Kong Fanxi, Xu Zeye, Wu Zijiu, Hu Shuhua, Cheng Kuanzheng, Lu Yuanhu, Tao Baichuan, Lü Xintian, Yang Demin, Wang Xiaoying, Ma Jiazhen, Zhao Lüqing, Tong Hangbai, Shen Tianbai, Guo Weiping, Tang Xianghou, Zhou Darong, Zhang Wanqing, Yu Nanqiu, Wang Wujun, Zhang Yongchun.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Jiang and Vice Commander Zhang To Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing National Government and Vice Commander Zhang in Beiping: The border officials of the tyrannical Japanese have failed in their duty. In less than two days, thousands of miles of land have been lost. This has never been heard of in history. Now, Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province, with a small force, resists the enemy with skill and is still able to capture generals and raise flags, chasing and driving back the enemy. His morale is high, his righteousness is commendable, and we have repeatedly heard news of victories, which the whole country celebrates. However, it is a common truth that few can defeat many, and we fear that his force is small, his supplies are lacking, and setbacks are possible. If Heilongjiang is unfortunately lost again, Zhili and Shandong will also fall. Therefore, we urgently telegraph you, requesting that you quickly send elite reinforcements, provide sufficient supplies and equipment, and order Chairman Ma to take full authority to incorporate the retreating troops from Liaoning and Jilin to increase his strength, so as to protect the territory and recover the lost land. In haste, we await your orders with great anxiety.</p>
<p>Telegram to General Ma Zhanshan To Chairman Ma and all soldiers in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang: The tyrannical Japanese have invaded and occupied our Liaoning and Jilin and are now coveting Heilongjiang. Fortunately, our chairman commands with skill, morale is high, and the lone army fights bravely to protect our territory, win glory for the country, and avenge the humiliation of our compatriots. Your loyalty and bravery are commendable. Looking north, we deeply admire you. Our association, in addition to raising funds to assist the troops, has telegraphed Chairman Jiang and Vice Commander Zhang, requesting that they quickly send elite reinforcements and provide sufficient supplies and equipment. We specially telegraph our condolences, hoping that you will continue to fight for final victory. The compatriots in the educational circles of this city vow to be your backing. In haste, we send our telegram with tears, hoping that you will take it into consideration. Executive Committee of the Shanghai Teachers and Staff Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>
<h3>University Students' Northeast Problem Speech Contest</h3>
<p>▲ Ten Schools Have Registered; Xu Peihuang and Others Invited to Judge The Shanghai YMCA's Educational Department initiated the university students' Northeast Problem speech contest, and preparations have been underway for a long time. Registrations have been very enthusiastic, so the methods have been changed. The origins and regulations have been published in this newspaper. Now, each school has selected one person to participate in the final. Ten representatives have registered to participate in the final: Chen Fugang from Fudan, Wu Hua from Guanghua, Hou Minggao from Jinan, Wang Shanxiang from the School of Law and Political Science, Liu Liangmo from Shanghai University, Hui Jianpei from St. John's University, Wu Shangjiong from Great China University, Liu Xuantian from Jiaotong University, Song Xunlun from Central Business College, and Fan Zhenbang and Yang Xing from China Public School. However, each school is limited to one person. According to a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency who interviewed Guo Xu Zhiyu, a letter has been sent to the China Public School authorities requesting them to designate one person to participate in the final, but a reply has not yet been received from the school. Yesterday, a letter was sent to all school representatives asking them to report to the new office of the YMCA at Baxianqiao before 1:00 PM on the 21st (Saturday). The order will be determined, and the contest will begin immediately. The topic is "How to Solve the Northeast Problem." The judges are Pan Gongzhan, Xu Peihuang, and Wang Yunwu. Ma Xiangbo was originally invited, but due to other reasons, he was unable to attend, so Wang Yunwu was invited to judge instead. Mayor Zhang Yueyun will present the awards.</p>
<h3>Inspection of the Labor University Volunteer Team</h3>
<p>▲ A Fundraising Campaign Is Also Launched to Remit Funds to General Ma in Heilongjiang</p>
<p>▲ The National Labor University Volunteer Army has been organized into four teams: teams one and two are students from the College of Engineering, team three is from the College of Social Sciences, and team four is from the College of Agriculture. Yesterday (the 19th) at 10:00 AM, an inspection was held. President Wang Jingqi, along with military instructor Peng Zhen and other important staff members, personally attended the school's large playground and gave a speech, urging them to rush to the country's aid. The atmosphere was exceptionally solemn and respectful.</p>
<p>Also, all the students of the school were extremely moved by Gao Zhanshan's lone army resisting the Japanese in Heilongjiang. Recently, they have unanimously rolled up their sleeves and launched separate fundraising campaigns, which have been very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>West Qing Basketball Game</h3>
<p>Chizhi Defeats Huadong</p>
<p>Result: 51 to 25</p>
<p>Shanghai Middle School Wins Against Law School 47 to 29 Three Group Matches Tonight</p>
<p>The West Qing Basketball Game was held last night with two groups, A and B. In group A, Chizhi played against Huadong. The two teams competed fiercely. Chen Qidong, the famous basketball player from the former St. John's University, recently returned from the United States and is now playing for Huaguo, adding a lot of color. However, Huadong was lacking in coordination, and their offense and defense were poor. Chizhi, which has a long-standing reputation as the champion of this year's city sports meeting, has not diminished in strength even though captain Xia Zeren has graduated and left the school. The three forwards, Kong Guangyi, Qian Dingshen, and Yang Tonglin, coordinated closely and shot accurately. The two guards, Gu Guangdao and Xia Yushu, were heavily guarded and impenetrable. Although Huadong was strong, it was not its opponent. From the start, Chizhi took the lead all the way, with a great momentum. In the first half, Chizhi had 26 points, and Huadong had 14 points. The final result was 51 to 25, with Chizhi winning.</p>

<h3>Recollections from the Dai Liang (Tortoiseshell Beam)</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>After the Red Sheep Calamity, the war between the Han people continued. Surpassing the Eight Banners, only the General of Jilin, Yitang'a, was brave and skilled in battle, unparalleled in 情　. The troops under his command were all valiant soldiers, safeguarding the Northeast. The Qing court relied heavily on him. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Yitang'a led his ten thousand-plus men, disregarding the troops under Wu Dacheng. He fought fiercely in the area of ​​Gai County's Mount Motianling, repeatedly using ingenious tactics to lure the Japanese army deep into strategic locations, gathering them together to annihilate them. Having gone through dozens of battles, he always took the lead, charging into the enemy lines, engaging in close hand-to-hand combat. Those who stood in his way were routed. When Wu Dacheng's troops were stationed in Jinzhou, Wu personally led the central army, Song Qing was on the right flank, and Yitang'a led the Eight Banners soldiers on the left flank. The Japanese General Ōshima Yoshimasa knew that Yitang'a and Song Qing were not to be trifled with, so he used light cavalry to intercept the central army, with mixed results. When Wu's main camp was routed and retreated into Guanzhong, the ones who supported him were Yitang'a and Song Qing. Song was experienced and prudent, using offense as defense, while Yitang'a defended strategic locations and choked off the enemy, even using light cavalry to outflank the enemy army, attacking from three sides. His battle merits were particularly outstanding. In the Battle of Mount Motianling, it was late at night and raining heavily. Yitang'a attacked them unprepared, selecting eight hundred cavalry soldiers, biting their mouthpieces, and rushing into the enemy camp. Yitang'a rode a furious horse, commanding and beheading over a thousand, capturing five hundred enemy soldiers. Corpses lay everywhere, and blood flowed like a canal. The Japanese army retreated more than fifty li, and before they could catch their breath, Song's army arrived and defeated the Japanese army. In this battle, Yitang'a seized more than four thousand guns and twenty cannons. Yitang'a reported the victory to the Qing court, declaring his intent to strike straight into Huanglong (the enemy's lair) and wipe out the enemy. Public opinion praised him. How could the court be filled with fear, eager to negotiate peace? The Governor-General of Zhili, Li Hongzhang, was ordered to go to Maguan to negotiate peace, and the two armies ceased fighting. Yitang'a resigned due to the peace, but the Emperor ordered him to stay. Yitang'a still returned to Jilin to cultivate, leading to the loss of this great opportunity. Speaking of it cannot help but make people feel regret.</p>
<h3>Trivial Tales of the Japanese Nation</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Since the Shenyang Incident, everyone in the country has been paying attention to and exploring the situation in Japan. Now, I will describe what I heard from my Japanese friends on the left.</p>
<p>All Japanese people over the age of 21 have the obligation to serve as soldiers. Once the country has war, the scholars will stop studying and the farmers will stop farming. Industrialists and businessmen will stop their work to go. Even in times of peace, they must practice combat and lead a military life. Therefore, for those seeking employment, the other party must ask whether they have ever joined the army and examine their certificates. Otherwise, they will be rejected as fugitives and will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Excluding Chinese people is a common practice in Japan, and it has not started today. The reason is that mixed residence is the only right of equal countries. China cannot be in an equal position with Japan, so it cannot give China the right to mixed residence. Moreover, it refers to Chinese people as people of the lower class of society, and most of them have not been educated. Mixed residence may hinder the customs and hygiene of Japan. Chinese people are stingy by nature and are good at accumulating wealth, so they are afraid of taking huge amounts of money back to their country, which may hinder the economy of Japan. Chinese people have a low standard of living, and the wages are low. In comparison, everyone is happy to use cheap Chinese labor, which hinders the lives of Japanese laborers.</p>
<p>Japanese people can imitate various Western utensils and textiles, and they are cheaper than Western goods. Therefore, Japanese people are happy to use domestic goods, hold them constantly and keep it a habit. It is not like our country's great pain, and then we start to talk about boycotting and promoting it. Just a short time of five minutes.</p>
<p>Japanese culture uses our country's culture as its culture. Famous books in our country are translated into Japanese texts. Such as the Four Books and Five Classics, Zhuangzi, Laozi, Liezi, Xunzi, Mozi, Guanzi, Han Feizi, and other masters, as well as the prose of the Eight Great Masters, the poems, songs, and ballads of the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and the words of novelists, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, Scholars, Journey to the West. Flowers in the Mirror and Traces of Flower and Moon are all made into Japanese and sold in workshops. Every household is reciting. Called Chinese Studies. Now that the war has broken out, a newspaper in Japan specializes in translating the major military and national affairs published in our country's newspapers.</p>
<h3>Song of the Brave Soldiers of Shuofang</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>After the violent sun invaded my Shenyang and Jilin, it further planned to invade my Heilongjiang Province. Unexpectedly, it was repeatedly defeated by my Heilongjiang Army and the reclamation army. The violent sun's court and the public were disturbed by this. It will besiege with a large army, but the weather is cold and the ice is frozen, and the isolated army is trapped and defended. I have not yet heard of any support from our side, and the granary is empty. What can be done? General Ma has done his best to defend the territory, and the righteous men under his command are also united in hatred and can wash away the national shame for the country. It is also a strong city for our country to last forever. I am deeply grateful that people across the country have automatically donated large sums of money in recent days. I hope that our calligraphy and painting circles will also rise up and plan for it. So that General Ma and all righteous men can complete their meritorious deeds of defending against insult. I hereby compose this song to inspire it.</p>
<p>Shenyang has been trapped for two months, and the debate is endless. Jing Tang was coerced and pitied the young children. Mock at the old fool who claims to be loyal. The way to destroy Korea is to destroy my country. I don't know what use is the raising of a million soldiers. Sitting and making the mountains and rivers end like this. I didn't expect that there was still a man named Ma, whose heart was like iron and whose spirit was like a rainbow. He raised his arms and called for national disaster, and each man had the courage of ten thousand men. The Battle of Nenjiang broke the enemy's courage, like a defeated leaf destroying a strong wind. The Japanese court and the public were shocked when they heard the news, and the whole island was the same. They even sent out troops to support them, and they will gather a large army in Manchuria and Mongolia. An isolated army is deeply trapped, what can I do? The tragic people are still singing and dancing. You don't see the north wind sweeping the ground like a sharp arrow, and it is difficult to keep warm when sandwiched with cotton. You don't see the enemy in the ice and snow, and the hungry body and cold body are wielding swords. You must know what hard work is for, and you will protect the mountains and rivers with iron and blood. Alas, I will protect the mountains and rivers with iron and blood.</p>
<p>The reason for this is to peek at a glimpse of public opinion in our country and the state of the military situation, so as to inform its people of the conspiracy against me.</p>
<p>The Japanese army is arrogant and invincible. A certain celebrity was worried about it. He once published a paper, roughly saying that soldiers are too proud, which will lead to defeat, and pointed out that the Japanese army has not experienced a formal war since the Russo-Japanese War. Since the revolution, Chinese warlords have been fighting endlessly for twenty years. On the one hand, it is enough to consume China's strength, and on the other hand, it is enough to enrich the military's battlefield experience. Therefore, the outbreak of this incident is not optimistic in Japan. That celebrity is really a knowledgeable person. Our country should work hard for it. There is hope of attacking Fusang in the east.</p>
<h3>Viewing the Modern Famous Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Kun</p>
<p>Mr. Xue Baolun gathered modern painting exhibitions by forty famous artists at the Ningbo Fellow Association. The grand occasion can be said to be unprecedented since the National Art Exhibition. And the exquisite examination of the exhibits also surpasses it. The most famous products of the whole exhibition are the reputations of Mr. Fu Tienian, Zheng Wuchang, Qian Shoutie, and Chen Xiaodie. Tienian has been away from Beiping for a long time, and Shanghai people are eager for his works. Therefore, on the first day of the exhibition, it was already booked and empty. Especially a mo-orchid painting, the rhyme is superb. And Mr. Chen Xiaodie's large-scale lotus flower is only a remnant lotus on the paper. The style is charming, especially above Tienian's ink orchid. Qian Shoutie has four ink-painting flowers, which can directly compete with Yu Ji. It is appropriate that there are always people standing in front of these paintings. Mr. Wu Dongmai said that watching Xiaodie's flower paintings, the brush and ink are elegant, which can make all the works in the field have the regret of too much vermilion and too much ink. I said that modern painters lack authors in terms of skill. If we talk about natural talent and ingenuity, then Dieye's (Xiaodie's other name) recent works, even Hu Fan, cannot surpass them. Mr. Wu Hufan never allows people to paint. But only for Xiaodie's recent works, he said, "Fairy, fairy." Its value can be imagined. Shoutie's paintings have been expensive in Dongying for a long time. Recently, because of Japan's atrocities, he vowed never to sell his works to the Japanese again. His character is like this. His paintings have a magnificent atmosphere. Zheng Wuchang and He Tianjian's works are all carefully managed. The layout is new and chic. The use of the brush is unrestrained. The two gentlemen have many disciples. Therefore, the recent art world has gradually abandoned the unrestrained style of Anji and tended to be pure. Therefore, Zheng He's contribution to the art world is not shallow. Looking at the exhibits in the whole exhibition, most of them are fresh and elegant. There are very few people who scribble wildly with cinnabar ink. It has already changed the style of the vertical and horizontal painters two or three years ago. The ancients said, "Looking at the style of painting at a time, you can spy on the subtle changes in the rule and chaos of the times." Is it not far away from the world to rule? I look forward to it. So I am happy to write it down.</p>
<h3>There Are Only Two Generals in the Republic of China</h3>
<p>— Da Shuan</p>
<p>The rich forest and fertile plains of Northeast China are full of treasures. Since September 18, the dwarfish slaves invaded. In a few hours, the bandits did not shed blood and settled by spreading the news. The Black Mountain collapsed and the White Water Zhu Yin. The young officer said, "Do not resist." The revolutionary government also said, "Be calm." But begging for help from the League of Nations, the people of the country also followed and feared it. Suspecting that the Japanese bandits descended from the sky, they all have three heads and six arms.</p>
<p>The wind is sad and the border is isolated. General Ma only knows that he has a responsibility to defend the soldiers and is not succumbed by the bandit's edict. With thousands of people, he is trapped in a corner. There is no support army behind him, and he is fighting a death battle with the violent bandits. The bandits were repeatedly defeated. The people of the country suspected that the bandits had three heads and six arms. Now they suddenly realized that they were silver-like wax and not enough to strike. With the knowledge of the revolutionary government and young officers, how could they not know and be detailed? But they were frightened by false rumors and collapsed when they saw the wind. Could it be that they have other intentions? The people of the country are stupid and foolish, and how can they measure their profoundness? However, the people of the country are shaking and about to fall into the cave of slaves of the subjugated country in terror. The time for two months is really worrying like burning, and the day is like a year. The government and young officers are still as calm as ever. In the past 20 years, China has only blocked Russia and defended it. It can be called a war. In the past 20 years, only Han Guangdi and Ma Zhanshan can be called generals. General Han died in battle and sacrificed his country. Only General Ma Zhanshan is trapped in the border and supports this half of the broken country. I am afraid for the general, and I am afraid for the people of the country. (Transfer to pay for disaster relief)</p>
<h3>Records of Sights and Sounds of the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>During the Qianlong period of Changdian, the tomb of Li Neizhen, a historian of the Liao Dynasty, was discovered in the east of Liulichang. There is a saying in its Zhizhi stone that it was buried in Haiwang Village in the east of the city. Then I realized that Liulichang was the eastern suburb during the Khitan period. Liulichang is the place where the Ministry of Industry set up to make glazed bricks and tiles. The whole street is bookstores, antique shops and South paper shops, such as firework restaurants, which are only occasionally seen. Since Daoxian, the husbands of the Jixiang family have been reviewing books, appreciating calligraphy and painting, and stroking Yi Ding in their spare time to spend their leisurely years. Implicitly forming the cultural center of Beidu. At the beginning of the Lunar New Year, vendors set up stalls among them. The road is blocked for it. The police station must first specify the route to clear the vehicles and horses. Only then can we be safe. It is said that no one in the whole city, rich or poor, elegant or vulgar, male or female, old or young, Chinese or foreign, does not want to visit and enjoy it. It is called visiting Changdian. After the seventeenth year, the Lunar New Year was banned, and it declined slightly. However, it was restored as usual. It is said that the prosperity of the old capital cannot but rely on this.</p>
<p>There was a man named Wang Zhuoran who investigated Changdian Commercial from the third day of the first lunar month to the fifteenth day of the Republic of China for ten years. He made eight tables. One day of important goods refers to children's toys. It is the best in various businesses. The daily sales are more than 80,000 copper coins. The second is food and drink, which refers to tea and snacks. The third is daily necessities, mostly women's makeup. The fourth is antiques, including 139 antique shops, 50 antique painting shops, and 28 ancient book shops. The fifth is miscellaneous items, such as firecrackers and goldfish. The sixth is stunts, such as the Western Mirror. The seventh is gambling, which is divided into drawing lots, rolling eggs, and turning around. The eighth is non-commercial business, which is the amusement fair exhibition hall, etc., operated by the government and schools.</p>
<p>Hu Yinglin's Shao Shi Shan Fang Ji of the Ming Dynasty said that the bookstores in Yan are mostly on the right of Damingmen and outside the Ministry of Rites and on the west of Gongchenmen. Every time the conference tries the candidates, the bookstores are listed in front of Yang. Every time after the Flower Dynasty, two or three days later, they moved to Dengjin. Every time on the first and last days of the month, they moved to the City God Temple. Deng City is the farthest east and the City God Temple is the farthest west. They are all places for trade during the day. Deng City is three days a year, and the City God Temple is three days a month. When the period comes, all kinds of goods gather there, and books are one of them. This is the situation of selling books in the Ming Dynasty, which is very different from today. Today, in addition to Liulichang and its vicinity, there are the most bookstores in Longfu Temple. There are also small markets in Hair Hutong, but the quality is slightly lower. In recent years, the bookstores in Dong'an Market are lined up, mostly new books for ordinary students to browse. The hundred industries in the old capital are declining, but the old book industry is developing more and more. It is said that learning is prosperous and the needs are more and more. Books that were previously unpopular and no one cared about are now regarded as professional careers. For example, local chronicles of various provinces used to be bought by the pound, but now each copy is worth several yuan. Rare ones are worth hundreds of yuan. Genealogy books were not included in the collection. Now they are also collected in the Beijing Library, but they are still suffering from nowhere to find them. In addition, there are specially stationed personnel in Japan, Europe and the United States. They are busy searching for them every day and are willing to pay a lot of money. There are also domestic good-natured people who have a lot of money to compete for good books. They communicate with each other and respond to each other. They all regard Beijing as the area of ​​Wan Gu. Liulichang and Longfu Temple have branches stationed in various places with cadres. They are still worried that the response is not enough. In recent years, the collections of old families in the city have been dug up, but there are still treasures that have not been discovered in remote areas of the outer counties. Although people in the bookstores are ignorant of the source of knowledge, they know the names and versions like treasures. If they want to find a book, they can just tell one store. They can turn around and search for it to report. Even if they stop and do not buy, they will not complain. The items displayed in the annual Changdian New Year are not necessarily of the highest quality. People who like to spend time and eliminate time beside the cold stalls may occasionally get a fragmented book at a low price. If you really want to buy a book, you don't have to stick to this time. The same is true for buying antiques and calligraphy and paintings.</p>
<p>Fullness invites loss. A drunk fool is born. One day he was in a mysterious state and heard the conversation between A and B. He felt that it was humorous and interesting, so he specially recorded it.</p>
<p>A said, "This time the violent sun is acting as the host and forcibly occupying my Northeast. All the losses suffered by our country are really countless. It just corresponds to the saying in the book "Fullness invites loss."</p>
<p>"Full" is Manchuria, of course referring to the Northeast, and the word "invite" contains the meaning of inducement. Because the Northeast is rich in resources and the benefits are everywhere, the Japanese see it and covet it. Therefore, they rush to it and keep saying "Protecting the interests of Manchuria and Mongolia" to carry out various acts of aggression, resulting in today's losses. The ancients predicted it with clever words and puns. It has long been revealed in advance. It is a pity that the person with the responsibility of defending the territory has not read much and does not know the true meaning of it. Otherwise, if he thinks about the danger and prevents it in advance, how could he lose the territory and humiliate the country and ruin it?</p>
<p>B said, "He (referring to the person with the responsibility of defending the territory) did not read books. However, he did not understand what he read. What he read was only the sentence "Humility benefits." He thought he was a humble gentleman and that suffering a loss was a bargain. This is what is called "Humility benefits," so when he encountered enemy soldiers approaching the border, he also took humility as his principle, holding the non-resistance doctrine and retreating step by step. People could get it without effort. In the past, Zhao Pu used half a book of Analects to govern the world. Now he has ruined the Northeast by misreading a sentence of the book. It is so sad.</p>

<h3>A Countryman Comes to Shanghai Again (Twenty-Two)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>At that time, the countrymen did not understand how trampling out a group of their fire was considered touching their bad luck, and how burning a group of messy paper on fire was considered burning the road. He wanted to ask the friend who helped him out of the siege about this question.</p>
<p>That friend was very honest and told the countrymen.</p>
<p>"This is a superstition of the lower classes of society in Shanghai. For example, a rickshaw puller drags his rickshaw out and touts it for a long time without finding a passenger. He will burn the road. He burns a piece of paper vigorously and smokes it randomly in front and behind the rickshaw. Those who sell five-spice tea eggs, those who sell white sugar lotus porridge, those who sell osmanthus fat cake, and those who sell ham bean paste dumplings, all small businesses who cannot find customers, they are also anxious and burn a piece of paper vigorously and smoke it randomly in front and behind their burdens and baskets and all their business tools. Sometimes they also silently communicate with the gods and pray. This is considered burning the road. Those prostitutes are also like this. They cannot live without pulling a customer every day. Some of them do not own their bodies. They call it begging for a body. If they cannot pull a customer back at night, they will be beaten and scolded. So they are anxious and think that their luck has not been good these two days, so they often burn the road like rickshaw pullers and small businesses. Those rickshaw pullers and small businesses burn a piece of paper vigorously and smoke it randomly in front and behind their rickshaws or in front and behind their burdens and baskets and all their business tools. Those prostitutes are pitiful because they do not have any business tools. Their business tool is their body and all and part of their body. So they burn a piece of paper vigorously and smoke it randomly inside their crotch. This is their burning the road. I did not expect you, old gentleman, to misunderstand and trample out the remaining fire on their paper, so it is considered touching their bad luck." "In this way, these girls who are prostitutes also feel very pitiful." The countrymen immediately felt sympathy for these prostitutes. In the past, people who wrote poems had two lines of poetry saying, "People say this is a pair of mandarin ducks, but I look at them as mourning geese." Although the countrymen cannot write poetry, they are very rich in that kind of poetic meaning.</p>
<p>"Isn't it? You see that although they are dressed up enchantingly on the outside, they are actually very miserable. There are also many who have venereal diseases and have to come out to solicit customers. If you come into contact with them, you will become an old milk shed or a fruit store clerk tomorrow when you go back."</p>
<p>"What is a milk shed? What is a fruit store?" The countrymen did not understand this kind of hidden language.</p>
<p>"Haha, a milk shed is gonorrhea, and a fruit store is simply selling syphilis."</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The gold standard rebounded and fell</p>
<p>▲ Weak drop of more than eighteen taels ▲ Panic spreads frequently and huge changes are discovered Yesterday, the gold standard still had huge changes, with crazy winds and raging waves causing horror. The rise and fall of more than ten taels was impossible to deal with. The total turnover in the front and back markets was twenty-three or four taels. Looking back, it finally fell by more than eighteen taels. This is a reverse direction after many days of consecutive rises. The requests for supply from various companies are still very different. However, people's hearts have turned from firm to empty. Although the silver market has fallen, it is not affected. The reason is that the private telegram has not moved. The initial opening fell back. Later, it broke through 660 taels. It was followed by the tightening of the exchange rate. The big players in the market have always bought in, showing a sharp edge. There were almost a crowd of rising suns who suddenly rushed out seventy taels. Unfortunately, bad news came, the violent sun attacked black intensely, and the exchange rate saw a relaxation. It urgently went straight down and still retreated within sixty taels. The later market felt even weaker because of the news that the black province was lost. People's hearts were even more frightened, the arrogance was high, and it fell sharply by more than ten taels, breaking through fifty taels.</p>
<p>▲ The front market advanced sharply and retreated. The opening of the day was slightly lower by four taels and five cents to 663 taels and five cents. The big bar fell by sixteen thirteen points and the silver price fell by one point three seven five. Then, due to purchases by Tongtai Chang and others, it added to sixty-six taels. In an instant, buyers flocked, such as Yu Dacheng, Fengyong, Neixing, and foreign merchants Qiaozhifu, etc., all came to sell. In an instant, it fell by twelve or thirteen taels, only accounting for fifty-three taels. Furthermore, due to the poor situation, the British gold was traded by the Japanese Commercial Bank at 1.9125, and the US gold was added from 33 yuan and 125 to fifty-seven taels and a half. Suddenly, it tended to be smaller, and retail sales were sold. Furthermore, the US gold was very relaxed, and HSBC sold 33 yuan and 375, absorbing 4375, so the quoted price of British gold was fifty-four and five taels, and the hanging price was not changed. Subsequently, Yu Da, Nei Xing, Yongfeng, Cuichang, Yongshunli, Wanxing, etc. joined forces to compete for purchases, especially the exchange market, which was easy to be strong, and banks mutually traded US dollars at 33 yuan and 125. Later, the settlement was 32 yuan and 875, and the British gold was 18.875, and there was a settlement. As a result, the gold price rushed straight to the sky, soaring more than ten taels, reaching seventy-two taels at half past ten, with a fluctuation of two or three taels. After entering, it suddenly turned downstream. Tongtai Chang, Yongfeng, Yuanmao, Yongqian Changxiang and many long positions all sold off, and the British gold followed. Nine debaters emerged, and the US gold Sumitomo issued 33 yuan and 4375, causing the price to fall by thirteen or four taels to fifty-eight taels at twenty past eleven. Later, Huabi absorbed US dollars at 33 yuan and 1875, and HSBC absorbed British gold at 19.125, so the price rose again by seven taels, reaching sixty-five taels and five cents at three quarters past eleven. Then it saw a setback, retreating to sixty-two taels in an instant. By the noon closing, it was sixty-four taels and two cents, and it was suppressed again to sixty-one taels or so. It was really because people's hearts were flustered and wandering. The quoted price was still 756 taels, counting from 100 taels to 90 taels or so.</p>
<p>▲ The afternoon was really windy. The later market opened at fifty-nine taels and eight cents, which was the aftermath of the noon closing. Later, it was followed by the release of Qiaori's unfulfilled position, which dropped to fifty-four taels and a half again. After that, it advanced and retreated suddenly, bewildered and confused, with a fluctuation of three or four taels. Chenfeng Yong had a lot of sales, but Dalian Bang and Yongfeng Hengxing all entered. Furthermore, HSBC absorbed US dollars at 33 yuan and 25, so it went up by five or six taels, reaching sixty-one taels after three o'clock. In an instant, it was heard that the black province was in danger and the Japanese bandits were tyrannical, which dropped to fifty-four taels and five cents. Then, due to the bank's hedging of one-month British gold at 19.1875, and HSBC absorbed US dollars at 33 yuan and 25, the buyers in the market were active, raising the price by as much as eight taels. It was sixty-two taels and seven cents at twenty past three. Afterwards, it suddenly became weak due to the news of the conflict between Russia and Russia on the Middle East Road. People's hearts were greatly shocked. Tongtai Chang, Fuyu Bingxing Yifeng, etc. all sold out. Furthermore, the exchange rate was also relaxed, with British gold settling at 19.3125 and US dollars at 33 yuan and 4375, and the forward at 33 yuan and a half. As a result, the gold price fell by thirteen or four taels, breaking through fifty taels. At twenty past four, the price was finally forty-eight taels and five cents. However, Hengxing came in and added to fifty-two taels. By the closing at half past four, only forty-nine taels and eight cents were counted. It added to fifty-two taels or so, which was dragged in by Yongfeng and others. Compared with the day before yesterday (according to the quoted price), it dropped by eighteen taels and two cents. According to the maximum price of seventy-two taels and the minimum price of forty-eight taels and five cents, there was a fluctuation of twenty-three taels and a half. The opening price of the goods was sixty-four taels, the noon closing was sixty-two taels, the afternoon was fifty-eight taels and six cents, and the closing price was fifty-one taels and five cents. The quoted price was counted from one hundred taels to zero. The registered price was sixty-seven taels to sixty-four taels in the morning and fifty-three taels and five cents in the afternoon. The water supplement was sixty-seven taels in the morning and fifty-three taels in the afternoon. The naked bar was counted as five taels.</p>
<p>▲ The machine throws have no accurate rules. The trading statistics on the table show that Yifeng Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, Cuichang Yong, Tongtai Chang, and Hengchang Yong all entered. Dade Cheng, Zhifeng Yong, Yuantai, Yongfeng, Fuyu, and Futaiheng all entered and exited from time to time in large numbers. Yuanmao Yong, Bingxing, Qian Changxiang, and Chengfeng Yong all exited. Hengxing entered and exited two or three hundred bars. Qiaozhifu sold five or six hundred bars. In the afternoon, Qian Changxiang, Yuanxing Yong, Yongfeng, Hengxing, Shunli, Wanyu, and Xie Kang all entered. Tongtai Chang, Yuanmao Yong, Yuanda Yong, Chengfeng Yong, (many came out) Bingxing, Yifeng Yong, and Yifeng all exited. The speculator Wu also had sales. The Guangbang entered and exited one thousand six or seven hundred. The Dasubang entered three thousand and exited seven or eight hundred.</p>
<h3>Unstable Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British, American, and Indian silver markets all fell, and exchange rates also declined. However, the HSBC listing showed no change. The domestic market seemed to be tightening, but it was unstable and unpredictable, initially stable and then loosening, then showing strength again, before turning weak once more. In the afternoon, it was initially flat before declining. The gold market saw significant turbulence, with fluctuations of over twenty taels. Ultimately, it broke through 650 taels, truly affected by the violent Japanese invasion. The situation in the Northeast is precarious, with reports of Heilongjiang province being lost, causing widespread panic. However, compared to the previous day, British gold increased by 0.0625, while American gold decreased by 0.025, due to the small amount of foreign exchange trading. Gold merchants were very active, and hedging activities followed the gold market fluctuations. It is estimated that approximately one hundred thousand pounds of British gold and four to five hundred thousand US dollars were traded. It is reported that banks settled some accounts, preventing the market from becoming excessively strained.</p>
<p>▲ The highest domestic price for British exchange was 4.375, with the tightest spread being 1 shilling 8 pence 875, and the widest being 9 pence 3125. The opening bid in the morning was around 8 pence 875, with the buying price at 9 pence 375. Subsequently, Korea and Mitsui traded for February at 125. Shanghai offered 8 pence 875 after 10 o'clock, and later offered 9 pence. Banque Franco-Chinoise and Sumitomo traded for February at 9 pence.

Mitsui and Sumitomo traded for January at 1875. The closing bid was 3125, and the buying price was 375.</p>
<p>▲ The highest domestic price for American exchange fluctuated by 5625, with the tightest price at 32.875 yuan and the widest at 33.4375 yuan. The opening bid in the morning was 32.875 yuan, with the buying price at 36 yuan. Zhengjin Bank and Holland traded for February at 33.125 yuan.

Zhengjin and Chase Bank traded for January at 33.4375 yuan. The closing bid was 33.4375 yuan, and the buying price was 5625. One US dollar is still worth 3 taels, 1 mace, 4 fen, and 96 hao of silver.</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Decline Again</h3>
<p>According to a London telegram yesterday, silver bars were still fluctuating. Some selling occurred on the European continent, but supply was lacking. China bought a small amount at low prices. Buyers were satisfied and the market was stable. After the close, the market became sluggish, trading below the listed price. There was little trading in the United States. The near-term price fell by 0.08125 to 18 pence 0625, and the forward price also fell by 0.08125 to 17 pence 9375. Another telegram from New York reported that the price of American silver also fell sharply by 1.375 cents to 29.75 cents. The British to American rate decreased by 1.125 cents to 3.77125 yuan, and the American to British rate fell by 0.5 cents to 3.7725 yuan. The London-Shanghai exchange rate shortened by 0.025 shillings to 1 shilling 9 pence 75. The Bombay spot price decreased slightly by 44 annas to 58 rupees 04 annas, and the forward price decreased slightly by 45 annas to 58 rupees 07 annas.</p>
<h3>Silver Market Appears Soft</h3>
<p>▲ Underlying Conditions Not Relaxed</p>
<p>▲ Market Overview Yesterday, the underlying condition of the silver market was that interbank borrowing was mutually short, and the situation could not be eased. However, the external appearance seemed to be softening, as the trend dictated that painful suppression was necessary to avoid panic in the market. According to sources in the industry, financial sector operations are contracting this year, and there is no room for development. While those affected have not explicitly announced liquidation, they are likely clearing accounts and winding down in secret.</p>
<p>▲ Interest Rates "Yangli" (interest on foreign currency loans) opened at 7 mace, 2 fen, 4 li, and 5 hao in the morning, and 7 mace, 2 fen, 4 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu and a half in the afternoon, slightly better than the previous day by a few hao.

The bank's listed rate was 1 qian and 8 fen.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary Currency Market The prices for Jiangnan small coins were the same in the morning and afternoon at 6 qian, 5 fen, 1 li, and 7 hao and a half, slightly lower than the previous afternoon by 1 li. Transactions amounted to 3,500 jiao in the morning and 1,250 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small coins were priced at 6 qian, 4 fen, and 9 li in the morning and 6 qian, 4 fen, 8 li, and 6 hao and two and a half hu in the afternoon. Transactions amounted to 230,000 jiao in the morning and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins also decreased by 500 wen to 379,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow "Silver Funds" Yesterday, bank reports indicated that Chinese merchants deposited over 2.5 million in bills, foreign merchants deposited over 1.9 million, special funds deposited 2.89 million, and various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds deposited 7.78 million. 600,000 was deposited into warehouses, and 500,000 was withdrawn.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Sharp Fall in Consolidated 6% Customs Bonds</h3>
<p>▲ Decline Reaching Several Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Other Small Declines Around One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the securities market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw trading in spot bonds only for the liquidation bonds in the afternoon, while other bonds remained untraded. The futures market saw more volatile price movements compared to the previous day, leading to a slight increase in trading activity. The mood among buyers and sellers was slightly more active. The price movements in the morning were sluggish as before, with minimal fluctuations, reflecting the continued extreme depression in both domestic and international situations and a wait-and-see approach from the market participants. However, the market became unsettled in the afternoon due to numerous rumors circulating, causing widespread anxiety. Selling activity became more lively, and prices trended downwards. Consolidated 6% Customs bonds saw the steepest decline due to limited demand, falling by 2.70 yuan. Customs bonds fell by 2.10 yuan, while other bonds also continued to decline by varying amounts, ranging from 0.70 to 1.34 yuan. The outlook for the securities market seems unfavorable for the time being, but the chaotic situation remains unchanged. Spot trading amounted to only 1,000 yuan, with the total value of futures trading reaching over 5.55 million yuan in the morning and 3.8 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 9.345 million yuan. National bonds and salt revenue bonds each accounted for approximately 2 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn &amp; Cotton</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Desultory</h3>
<p>The yarn market saw prices rise in the morning but remained flat in the afternoon, showing a very desultory trend. Due to the financial emergency and adverse news events, market sentiment was weak, making it increasingly difficult to expand trading activity. As a result, the market lacked any real momentum. However, there were still quite a few shorts covering when prices fell.</p>
<p>▲ Morning Rise, Afternoon Flat in "Renbiao" Yarn The "Renbiao" yarn market opened higher in the morning due to the declining price of American cotton but relatively strong exchange rates, resulting in better market sentiment. Prices rose by 4, 6, and 8 qian across all months. In the afternoon, prices were flat, falling by 1 and 3 qian across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 20,200 bales. Purchases included 700 bales of Jifeng, 1,100 bales of Gongtai, and 1,000 bales of Gengfeng, while sales included 1,450 bales of Taixing and 300 bales of Dachang. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|-------|---------------|--------|----------------|</p>
<p>| Nov   | 1520          | +4     | 27,252         |</p>
<p>| Dec   | 1528          | +6     | 66,250         |</p>
<p>| Jan   | 1533          | +3     | 74,500         |</p>
<p>| Feb   | 1539          | +6     | 75,300         |</p>
<p>| Mar   | 1545          | +4     | 61,300         |</p>
<p>| Apr   | 1545          | +3     | 38,000         |</p>
<p>▲ No Improvement in Yarn Sales The sale of raw yarn has seen no improvement. According to statistics, all traders bought a total of 700 bales for the day, with 80 bales being exchanged among domestic merchants. Prices were flat. Among the non-local merchants, Yunnan bought 360 bales, inland regions bought 200 bales, Guangdong bought 100 bales, and northern regions bought 35 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market in Stability</h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, but with a declining exchange rate and falling American cotton prices, there should have been a slight upward trend. However, the problem is that factories are absorbing too much foreign cotton and showing little interest in domestic cotton. Although the environment is favorable, domestic cotton prices are still several taels higher than foreign cotton prices. As a result, the position of domestic cotton has long been encroached upon by foreign cotton, making the market very dull. However, traders from Hubei and some cotton merchants are still holding firm.</p>
<p>▲ Hubei Cotton Market Active The "Hanbiao" cotton market opened with gold prices firm and American cotton prices falling, resulting in a flat situation. Prices rose slightly by 1.5 to 2 qian across all months. In the afternoon, prices were flat across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 41,300 dan. Sales included 1,400 dan of Hengyi, 1,900 dan of Xincheng, 1,800 dan of Yiyu, and 1,500 dan of Yuanda, while purchases included 1,200 dan of Hengda, 1,100 dan of Tianlong, 2,100 dan of Yichang, and 1,700 dan of Yifeng. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|-------|---------------|--------|----------------|</p>
<p>| Nov   | 3190          | +0     | 57,200         |</p>

<p>| Apr   | 3155          | +1     | 43,700         |</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Demand Stagnant The current cotton trading is still stagnant. The source of supply is estimated to be 1,200 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 32.50 yuan, Hongzhang bought 400 pieces of spot goods for factory delivery.</p>
<p>Strict Middling Grade: 35.25 yuan, Zhenxin bought 200 pieces of spot goods for warehouse delivery.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of American cotton initially rose due to positive news from Liverpool, but later softened due to profit-taking and weakness on Wall Street. Futures fell by 8 to 12 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures fell by 6 points, while spot prices rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton exporters slightly sold off, but the sales were absorbed by short covering. Pingle rose by 3.75 rupees, Omla rose by 3.5 rupees, and Bairexi rose by 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 18th):</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Downriver Rice Market Rises by 2 Jiao</p>
<p>▲ Short Supply from Nantou Yesterday, the supply from Nantou was scarce due to wind obstruction. Inventory in the port was limited, and urban and rural retail sales were observing this situation. It was reported that the gate market had increased appetite first, with strong demand. Trading was more active than yesterday, and prices gradually firmed. Therefore, the price of thick, new glutinous rice increased by 2 jiao. The stock of thin Indica rice was also limited, and sales in the local market were strong, with robust demand in Ningbo. The market price was expected to increase by another 2 jiao, with mid-grade rice following with an increase of 1 jiao, similar to the thick glutinous rice. The supply of sharp-headed rice from Luyang was still limited, and sales were sluggish, with prices remaining firm. The stock of transformed Yin rice has disappeared, and the inventory in the port has become thin, with spot trading remaining flat. The price of mid-to-low grade rice must be low.</p>
<p>▲ New Gate Yesterday, about twenty ships arrived. Market sales were more active due to the unfavorable weather. Demand from all parties was excellent, and the price of Xixin rice was nearly 1 jiao higher. The price of top-grade rice was about to reach the 15 yuan mark. Trading in middle-grade rice was excellent. However, sales turned sluggish in the afternoon, and the general trend was not upward. The supply of Indica rice was limited, and the price remained stable. The route for sharp-headed rice from Lubu was very smooth, and prices tightened by 1.5 jiao. The spot market had brisk demand, so prices were lively.</p>
<h3>Spot Foreign Rice Continues to Rise by 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice saw no dumping from foreign firms. Origin prices remained high, and there was no expectation of large-volume transactions. Market sentiment was therefore very good, and spot rice saw inquiries from local merchants, with signs of a gradual turnaround in market sentiment. Approximately 2,000 bags of mixed grades were handled by local merchants, with No. 1 Saigon at 10 yuan 0.6 jiao, No. 2 at 10 yuan 0.45 jiao, and small grain at 10 yuan 0.35 jiao to 10 yuan 0.25 jiao, all up by about 5 fen from the previous day. If local merchants continue to handle supplies and non-local merchants inquire, the market may need to move higher. There were no new transactions in futures. Several hundred tons of reclaimed goods were quoted, with February small grain at 4 taels, 9 qian, 3 fen, and a half, March at 5 taels, and April at 5 taels and 8 fen, all slightly lower than the previous market.</p>
<p>Soy Noodle Market Exhibits Flat Weakness</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Wheat Quotes Continue to Decline, Actual Sales and Speculation Wait and See</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soy noodle market showed a generally flat to weak trend across all months after the opening in the morning and afternoon. Although gold prices remained stable, foreign wheat quotes declined by about 5 to 6 jiao. In addition, the unrest in the situation caused both actual sales and speculation to remain mostly on the sidelines. With the tightening of credit, only those with real strength could gradually buy. Therefore, both near and distant terms remained sluggish. Trading volume for the day declined across the board, and there were concerns that the market would inevitably weaken further due to financial reasons. As a result, the current month fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li from the previous day, December fell by 0.75 li, January fell by 1 fen, February was unchanged, March improved by 5 li, and April improved by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Trend Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a generally flat to weak hovering trend across all months after the opening in the morning and afternoon. Although the re-increase in gold prices hindered the quoted price of foreign wheat, the majority dared not rush to buy due to concerns about backtracking. Moreover, with the tightening of credit and the increasingly serious situation, buying interest was very weak, and the market felt rather desolate. The subsequent trend would depend on how soy noodle sales fared before there could be any rise or fall. As a result, the current month fell by 2 fen from the previous day, December fell by 1 fen, January and February were unchanged, March improved by 1 fen, and April improved by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Spot Sugar Continues to Trend Firm</p>
<p>▲ Forward Raw Sugar Opened Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, news from sugar producing areas indicated that the price of Cuban spot sugar remained at 1.375, and the price of New York sugar futures for all months fell by 2 fen compared to the previous telegram. The price of Javanese spot sugar also remained unchanged. Spot trading in the guild market was still scarce, but market sentiment was slightly stable and optimistic. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white sugar was traded at 10 taels, 1 qian, and a half, and No. 20 medium white sugar was traded at 9 taels and 8 qian, trending firm. Taikoo sugar B mark was at 11 taels and 6 qian, DY mark was at 10 taels and 5 qian, HX mark was at 11 taels and 4 qian, and HM mark was at 11 taels and 7.5 qian. Trading was smooth, and the market appeared quite firm. The spot market had national products, with Wufu ice sugar quoted at 8 taels and 8 qian, Hesong brand at 8 silver and 5 qian, and low-grade manual ice sugar at 7 silver and 5 qian, trending flat and stable. Re-exported Dutch sugar saw Jardine Matheson selling 300 tons of raw white sugar for shipment in February and March of next year at 5.35 Dutch guilders. It was heard that Jardine Matheson's price was 0.05 lower, and there were also other sales, but the market was generally flat and unremarkable.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Orchid Seeds: High-Quality Goods Scarce</p>
<p>▲ Prices Trend Higher Again</p>
<p>The arrival of orchid seeds has been limited recently, and it is heard that the production of winter water goods is also low. However, the weather has been quite favorable, so the products are yellow, bright, fragrant, and of good quality. A dozen or so pieces have arrived recently, with opening prices reaching 40 taels, and then varying from 37 taels to 35 and 6 taels. The rest, with black color, remains weak, and sales are also lower. According to correspondence, high-quality goods on the ground must be priced at 42 yuan, plus all external expenses, and the transfer to Shanghai would require 41 to 2 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea</h3>
<p>Tunxi Fine Eyebrow Tea: Brisk Sales to England Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai saw Tunxi high-grade Fine Eyebrow green tea from English firms such as Xiehe, Jardine Matheson, Tongfu, and Baochang becoming active, with trading becoming brisk. The total trading volume for the city was over 1,300 boxes, with sales prices ranging from 85 taels to 100 taels, a drop of 30 taels from before. The route for Needle Eyebrow green tea from Luzhuang was also slightly more lively. However, due to the prolonged sluggishness in the market, spot prices were also lower than before. The routes for Fine Eyebrow tea from Wuyuan and Gongxi green tea remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>Local Products Unable to Meet Demand</p>
<p>The textile market remains sluggish, with a very quiet atmosphere. Western goods are lacking in inventory, and ordinary goods are extremely scarce. Eastern goods are being boycotted, and local products are unable to meet demand, often resulting in stockouts. Even the long-term orders of various factories have been completely filled. The positive trend is unprecedented, and profits can be guaranteed. There is no shortage of people preparing to organize and set up factories. This is a good phenomenon amid the promotion of domestic goods. Therefore, even if lower-quality goods were to be cleared, they would likely suffer a severe setback. Among the local products, the most recent ones are velvet goods. Double-width thick velvet from Tongcheng is priced at 9 qian and 7.5 fen, single-width from various factories at 4 qian and 7.5 fen, and high-quality striped velvet at 9 taels, with ordinary velvet at 8 taels and 1 qian. The production of wool velvet is also increasing, with prices quoted at 3 qian and 2 fen and 3 qian. Bleached velvet is being snapped up by napping factories, and Sanlu and Santao loose goods have been quoted at around 4 qian, mainly because there is a lack of spot goods. Fei Fa velvet and Yuehua velvet can also be spun. Fine serge and gong ni production are increasing daily. Cotton cloth remains stable, with 11-pound Sanlu and Santu both at 5 taels and 5 qian, and 9-pound Mao Ying at 5 taels and 2 qian. Fine cloth and fine twill both require about 8 taels. The goods from the Yuanfang Jiao firm have been falling sharply because sales have been sluggish. Yuan Yu silk has fallen by 1 to 2 taels, and Yuan Xi satin and others are down by 4 to 5 fen per yard, but the extreme tightness of credit is also a major reason.</p>
<h3>Demand for Low-Grade Woolen Cloth Extremely High</h3>
<p>The woolen cloth market was relatively stable yesterday. Traders from Xiamen and Sichuan continued to arrive, and there was an extraordinary shortage of lower-grade checkered twill and flower-patterned low-grade woolen cloth on the market. As a result, prices were very firm, as local merchants continued to search for supplies, with demand exceeding supply. The market sentiment in the guild was quite firm. The wholesale price of ordinary low-grade woolen cloth was universally quoted at 1 tael and 2 qian and a half, printed cloth at 1 tael and 5 qian, and No. 1 goods at 2 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen, but it was still difficult to obtain more. Because the inventory in Shanghai is not large, there is a trend of exhaustion and stockouts.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>460 pieces of woolen cloth and textiles arrived from England.</p>
<p>▲ 6,000 pieces of steel bars and iron plates arrived from Belgium.</p>

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Does Not Fail the Nation</h3>
<p>▲ Whose Responsibility is it that the Isolated Army has No Support?</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, with an isolated army from a border province, resisted the stubborn Japanese invaders and supported them for half a month, but eventually withdrew from Heihe due to exhausted ammunition and no reinforcements. Alas, how sad!</p>
<p>▲ Guangdong Representatives Telegraph Guangdong for Assistance to Heihe Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Telegram Already Sent Out Last Night</p>
<p>The three Guangdong representatives staying in Shanghai, Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaoshu, and Zou Haibin, believe that Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province, with a small force, resisted the violent Japanese, preserved the territory, and fought for national glory. His loyalty and courage are remarkable. However, an isolated army in a remote area cannot be sustained for long. At this critical juncture, it is necessary to provide strong practical assistance as soon as possible to reverse the precarious situation. If we continue to disregard and fail to help, standing idly by, we will not only fail Ma Zhanshan, but also fail to protect our territory. Therefore, they held a meeting at Wu's residence on Mercy Road at 5 p.m. yesterday and decided to jointly telegraph the Guangdong government, requesting them to assist Ma Zhanshan, the Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, as soon as possible. The telegram was drafted and sent out last night.</p>
<h3>▲ Zhang Fakui Resolved to Await Orders to Depart</h3>
<p>▲ The Chairman Does Not Deem His Intestinal Illness Worthy of Concern</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui, commander of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, after telegraphing last time requesting to go to aid Ma Zhanshan and fight to the death with Japan, is now quietly waiting for a reply before departing. According to Zhang, there is a way to go to aid Heilongjiang, and he is eager to go. The doctors place great importance on his intestinal illness, which is still being treated, but he considers it insignificant. As the nation is in such a state, personal life and death are not worth considering.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Postal Workers' Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>▲Request to the government for the issuance of firearms</p>
<p>▲Regularly held grand maneuvers</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Corps, nearly two months have passed, and more than a thousand postal workers have volunteered to join. Over 700 have been incorporated into the ranks, forming a large corps with Mr. Zhang Kechang as the commander. Military uniforms and all equipment are very complete. They go to the north and south of the city for daily training, and the results are quite impressive. The corps has scheduled a grand maneuver on the 22nd of this month at 2:00 PM at the Qingyun Road open space in Zhabei. In addition to the participation of all the volunteers, there are also 30 members of the women's rescue team organized by the corps, 60 Boy Scouts, and 30 band members joining at the same time. Recently, moved by General Ma Zhanshan's lone army fighting the enemy, showing great loyalty and bravery, and filled with righteous indignation against the stubbornness of the Japanese, the corps specially telegraphed the National Government yesterday to volunteer to fight the Japanese and requested the issuance of firearms to the corps. It also telegraphed the Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Ma Zhanshan, expressing condolences and a willingness to live and die together. The wording was particularly tragic. The two telegrams are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>To the National Government, Nanjing: Since the violent Japanese invaded us, the whole country has been united in hatred. The officials in the Northeast retreated without a fight, and Liaoning and Jilin were occupied. Now Heilongjiang Province is also in danger. Fortunately, our Chairman Ma is loyal and brave in defending the territory, repeatedly defeating strong enemies with a small force. However, the enemy is now launching a full-scale nationwide offensive against us. If we do not rise up to resist immediately, the borders will surely collapse, and our people will die without a trace. To not fight and await death is the government's crime; to fight and lose the country is the nation's responsibility. Time is critical! Our corps, upholding the principle of jointly resisting national humiliation, is willing to take up arms on the battlefield and live and die together with the generals and soldiers at the front. We earnestly implore your government to issue firearms as soon as possible so that we may await orders to be conscripted. The country will be fortunate; the nation will be fortunate. Respectfully, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Corps.</p>
<p>To Chairman Ma, Heilongjiang: To General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, and forwarded to all the loyal and brave generals and soldiers at the front. As the violent Japanese invade, the whole country shares a common hatred. However, the officials in the Northeast, fearing Japan by nature, retreated without a fight, causing our beautiful land to fall into the hands of foreign races. Fortunately, you, General, are loyal to the country, and the soldiers are brave, resisting Japan with a lone army and resolutely killing the enemy, bringing glory to the country and survival to the nation. As the news of victory spread, the whole country rejoiced. Our corps, upholding the principle of jointly resisting foreign aggression, immediately appealed to the government to issue firearms and volunteered to go to the front to live and die together with you, General, and all the soldiers. We respectfully report this and hope that you will continue your efforts, stand ready, and not allow the Japanese invaders to cross the Nen River and graze horses. Your loyalty and bravery will shine for thousands of years and endure with the sun and moon. Respectfully, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Corps.</p>
<h3>▲Southeast Medical College</h3>
<p>Rescue Team to Heilongjiang Departs</p>
<p>▲Departed north by train yesterday afternoon</p>
<p>▲More than 4,000 representatives saw them off　　▲People from all walks of life made donations</p>
<p>The rescue team of Southeast Medical College was originally scheduled to depart as a whole for Heilongjiang to rescue wounded soldiers on the front lines. Now, due to financial constraints, 30 advanced students departed by train at 3:15 PM yesterday. More than 400 representatives saw them off at the station, including all the teachers and students of the school and more than 4,000 representatives from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army of Jinan, Chih Tze, and Guanghua, as well as various labor unions. The details of the time are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>▲The entire team is organized into two sections: medical affairs and transportation affairs. The leader is Chen Chesheng, the commander is Zhang Gan (the one with the severed finger), and the deputy commander is Liu Changxin. However, the leader, Chen Chesheng, is the military instructor of the school and will escort them to Beiping. After the liaison with the Deputy Commander's office is completed, he will return south.</p>
<p>▲Departure situation The team first gathered at the old site of the Songhu Station, then formed a team and entered the No. 2 station. After the whole team entered the carriages, the commander Zhang Gan gave a speech thanking the representatives who came to see them off. At this time, the representatives shook hands with the team members to say goodbye, and some even shed tears. The tragic and righteous courage of the entire team was admirable. Not long after, the whistle sounded, and the representatives threw colorful confetti. In the tragic and enthusiastic slogans of "Down with Japanese Imperialism," the train headed west.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Gan's speech Representatives, today we are departing, and we are unworthy of your sending us off. I hope that after you return, you will continue your efforts and continue to go to the front line to fight the Japanese to the death. At the same time, we are extremely grateful to the staff of the Railway Bureau for donating the transportation costs for the entire team.</p>

<p>▲Donations after the Incident in Heilongjiang</p>
<h3>Living Weekly Society</h3>
<p>Announces Method of Handling Donations</p>
<p>No Loss of Donations Diligently Collected</p>
<p>The Living Weekly Society, in response to the enthusiastic donations from comrades from all walks of life to support Heilongjiang, has received a large amount of money. In addition to the 53,407 yuan that has been remitted to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, it received another 11,496 yuan and 96 cents yesterday, which has not yet been remitted. Because the military situation at the front is changing rapidly, and many enthusiastic comrades are concerned about this matter, the society solemnly announces several points as follows: (1) All donations are remitted daily to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, telegraphed to Harbin, and transferred to General Ma. If General Ma has properly received the money, a receipt will be delivered in the future. If it cannot be delivered, it should be returned according to the bank's practice. (2) Whether the society will continue to remit and collect donations will depend on whether General Ma can still hold on and whether the money can be remitted. (3) If, due to the pressure of the situation, it is impossible to remit by telegraph, the collection of donations will have to be temporarily suspended. The unremitted and returned funds will be kept in a special account in a reliable bank and will be publicly and fairly disposed of in the most appropriate way, either by returning them to the original donors or by waiting for a second Ma Zhanshan to be supported, all in accordance with the donors' wishes. However, all of this must depend on the situation thereafter and will be announced later. In short, there will be no loss of the money that enthusiastic comrades have worked so hard to collect.</p>

<h3>Seventy-Eighth Division Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Stationed in Longhua and Zhabei, etc.</p>
<p>▲Another batch is expected to arrive today</p>
<p>The Seventy-Eighth Division of the Nineteenth Route Army, ordered to be stationed in Songhu, arrived in Shanghai on the Jiangyu轮 of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at 1:30 PM yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Number of People Arriving This time, the Jiangyu transported the entire 156th Brigade, totaling two regiments, and a special service battalion of the division headquarters, a signal team, and all the officers of the division headquarters, totaling over 4,000 officers and soldiers, and dozens of warhorses.</p>
<p>▲Arrival Situation Before the ship arrived at the port, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters agreed that it would land at the Gaochangmiao Naval Wharf. Therefore, yesterday morning, Battalion Commander Ye of the Naval Guard Battalion designated it to dock at the wharf in front of the old dock of the shipyard and sent soldiers to take care of the wharf and prepare tea. After the ship docked there at 1:30 PM yesterday, several soldiers disembarked and were on guard near the wharf. All the officers and soldiers did not disembark and waited for orders.</p>
<p>▲Distribution of Defense The defense locations after the division arrived in Shanghai have been determined. The Second Regiment of the 156th Brigade will be stationed in Longhua, the old site of the former Tax Police Regiment Headquarters.

<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Designated</p>
<h3>Xinming Goes to Japan to Carry Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>▲Departing around the end of the month</p>
<p>▲Decided to send a ship The Ministry of Communications sent a telegram to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ordering it to send a ship to Japan to transport overseas Chinese back to China. The company initially planned to send the Xinfeng轮 to Yokohama. However, the Xinfeng is currently under repair and only entered the inner river machinery factory yesterday and started work. It will take some time to repair and leave the factory. The business department changed its plan and sent the Xinming轮 to Japan. Now, the Xinming轮 just left Shanghai for Tianjin the day before and must wait for it to return to Shanghai before it can cross to the east. It is expected to depart on the 29th or 30th of this month. It was agreed with Director Guo yesterday and telegraphed to the consulate in Yokohama to inform the overseas Chinese to wait and also telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to prepare the ship's license and other items to be obtained when leaving the port.</p>
<p>▲Preparing Procedures Before a Chinese ship goes to Japan, the preparations for the pilot, ship's license, and wharf must be completed first to avoid temporary obstacles. It was decided by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday that all matters related to the Xinming轮's voyage to the east should be prepared by the Ministry to make it simpler. Now, there are still more than ten days before the ship departs, so the company specially telegraphed the Ministry to order the consul stationed in Yokohama to contact the Japanese side in advance regarding import and export and ship docking matters for convenience.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Japanese Warships</p>
<h3>Obstruct Passage of Chinese Ships</h3>
<p>▲Obstructing the Zhenjiang River</p>
<p>▲Navigation Route is Blocked</p>
<p>▲Four Warships Block the River Yesterday, the various shipping companies in this port received an urgent telegram from Zhenjiang, stating that four Japanese warships stationed in Zhenjiang have been blocking the river recently, obstructing our navigation route. The navigation of ships going up and down the river is very difficult. A little carelessness can lead to contact. This not only hinders the navigation route but also endangers the safety of the ships. It is feared that it will cause other disputes, which is a hidden danger for international trade and transportation. It is recommended that the Japanese warships be ordered to move to a safe area to avoid causing trouble.</p>
<p>▲Letter Requesting the Customs Service to Move the Ships The various shipping companies who received the telegram were unanimous that Zhenjiang is a must-pass place for river boats, and the river surface is our national territory. Now is the low water season of the Yangtze River. If the navigation route is blocked, it is more likely to cause danger. They decided to send a public letter to the Inspector General of Customs requesting him to inform the Zhenjiang Customs Service as soon as possible to order the four Japanese warships stationed in Zhenjiang to move to a safe location that does not obstruct the navigation route, so that traffic is not hindered and ships can be secured. This letter was sent out yesterday.</p>
<p>Wu Chaoshu Talks About</p>
<h3>The Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant</h3>
<p>▲If Our Country Relies Entirely on Others</p>
<p>▲Then All Three Agreements Are Not Applicable</p>
<p>According to the American policy reported by the Paris Telegram Agency, the most important thing is the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy in the three northeastern provinces. The attitude of the United States towards resolving the Manchurian issue seems to be appropriate to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty, and many enemies in our country also believe that invoking the Nine-Power Treaty is better than invoking the League of Nations Covenant. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially visited Dr. Wu Chaoshu at his private residence at 10:45 AM yesterday. According to the conversation, the League of Nations Covenant, the Paris Peace Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty are all applicable or not applicable to the resolution of the three northeastern provinces' problems. I believe that if our country does not rely on itself and relies entirely on others, then all three agreements are not applicable. This is just like what I said yesterday, that is, we should be good at invoking them. As for whether the Article 11 of the Covenant (the reporter's note: This article stipulates that when any member country experiences any war or a similar threat of war, the League should take appropriate and effective measures to maintain peace among the countries, and any member country of the League may request the Assembly or the Council to pay attention to it) cited by our country's representative in the League of Nations to resolve the three northeastern provinces' problems is appropriate, or should be based on Article 16 (This article stipulates that if a member country of the League disregards the provisions of this chapter and does not submit the dispute to arbitration or legal resolution, nor submits it to the League for resolution, or engages in war within three months after submitting it for resolution, it shall be considered an act of war against all member countries of the League. Other member countries shall immediately impose commercial and financial sanctions on this defaulting country. When necessary, the member countries shall jointly send troops to achieve the purpose of protecting the League Covenant.) to request it to be more powerful, in fact, the League of Nations Covenant, not only Article 11 and Article 16 can be cited, but at least there are two or three more articles that can be proposed. However, whether Article 11, which our country is citing now, is the best is still a question. Article 16 should be studied in detail before it can be used. Furthermore, if our country asks the countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty to discuss this matter, whether the treaty has sanctions provisions such as Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, then the treaty text can be examined to find out.</p>

<h3>Yesterday’s Telegram from Nanjing Regarding the Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>▲Please Quickly Determine a Strategy for Internal Stabilization and External Defense</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Workers' Union, concerning the urgent need to determine a strategy for internal stabilization and external defense, telegraphed all representatives of the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang, forwarded by the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, with deep encroachment by the enemy and increasing urgency, the nation is hanging by a thread.

<p>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement Reported Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the Anti-Japanese Association: The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held its fourteenth executive committee meeting at 4 PM yesterday, with over forty executive committee members present. Lu Jingshi and Chu Huiseng chaired the meeting, and Zhao Shusheng and Tong Yikang served as recorders. The following cases were discussed: (1) The Design Committee submitted a proposed plan for handling confiscated Japanese goods for approval. It was resolved to postpone the decision until a survey and statistics on the confiscated Japanese goods are completed. (2) Committee member Wang Changyuan raised the issue that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce implemented the "Measures for Handling Confiscated Japanese Goods in the City," decided by the Committee for Economic Severance of Relations with Japan, without obtaining the approval of this meeting, and immediately published it in the newspapers, affecting the work of this association. It was resolved (A) to send a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce stating that all actions and resolutions of the committee must be decided by this association and must not be disposed of without authorization; (B) to publish an announcement in the newspaper stating that the measures for handling confiscated Japanese goods will be formulated after the survey and statistics are completed, and that the "Measures for Handling Confiscated Japanese Goods" published in the newspapers by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the previous day without the approval of this meeting will not take effect. (3) Committee members Yu Hualong and others raised the issue regarding Chen Yuansong's protection of unscrupulous merchants, which had been previously referred for review. The review has now been completed, and a report has been prepared for discussion. It was resolved to publish the review report and send a letter to Committee member Chen requesting him to continue working with the association. (4) Committee members Chu Huiseng, Wang Hanliang, and Li Yongxiang raised the issue of staff members of the association disobeying the orders of the standing committee, which had been previously referred for review. The review has now been completed, and a report has been prepared for discussion. It was resolved to record a major demerit against staff member Jiang Menggu as a warning. (5) Committee member Xie Fusheng raised the issue that Japan did not comply with the League of Nations' resolution and withdrew its troops on November 16th. This association should petition the National Government to implement economic sanctions and sever diplomatic relations, and, based on Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, request the member states of the League to sever economic relations with Japan together, and request the National Government to take over the lost territories by force. The standing committee resolved to refer the matter to the general meeting for public resolution, which was approved. (6) Committee member Zhou Xuexiang raised the issue that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Anti-Japanese Association confiscated a large number of Japanese goods, which are stored in the association's warehouse. The authority is inconsistent, which can easily lead to abuses. He requested that the association be notified to transport the goods to the warehouse in Nanshi for storage to clear the procedures. The standing committee resolved to refer the matter to the general meeting for public resolution, which was resolved to be kept by this association, and the custody and inspection departments will jointly handle it with Committee member Xu Mojue. (7) Committee member Zhang Yichen once again requested to resign as the director of the custody department of this association. Should it be approved? It was resolved to approve a one-month leave of absence, during which the deputy director will be responsible for acting as an agent. Other cases were also discussed before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲Review Report on the Chen Yuansong Case: On October 23rd, the 20th year of the Republic of China, this association received an official letter, along with five original documents, instructing the undersigned to review the reports from the investigation, inspection, and reconnaissance departments regarding Chen Yuansong's protection of unscrupulous merchants and Chen Yuansong's report of being beaten and detained. The review results, excluding the report from the investigation department, which is not within the scope of the review, are divided into two parts as follows: (1) Chen Yuansong did not protect unscrupulous merchants. The investigation revealed that the case originated from repeated reports from the inspection department stating that Xie Da Xiang, Bao Da Xiang, Yuan Chang Xiang, and Xin Da Xiang shops privately purchased a large number of Japanese goods from Japanese merchants. On the morning of October 17th, the department assigned Ge Yunting and others to go to investigate with the investigation department and Nanshi inspectors, resulting in a dispute and the tragic arrest of three staff members at 11:45 AM. As for Chen Yuansong rushing to the scene, it was after 3:00 PM, and he had first gone to this association to inquire about the facts from the two standing committee members, Wang and Fang. Therefore, Chen Yuansong's rushing to explain was to ease the dispute between the two parties in the capacity of the chairman of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and there was no intention to protect unscrupulous merchants. Furthermore, judging from the words in the reports after Chen Yuansong and the inspection department met, the biggest disagreement was that the action of the inspection department did not comply with this association's announcement on October 10th and the resolution to inspect Japanese goods with various trade associations. Therefore, Chen Yuansong's rushing to explain was to exercise the functions of his trade association based on the resolution of this association, and not to protect unscrupulous merchants. As for the inspection of Japanese goods by the inspection department, it must be determined whether it violates the resolution. (2) The part about Chen Yuansong being beaten and detained: Regarding Chen Yuansong being beaten and detained, there is no description of Chen Yuansong being beaten in the reports of the inspection and reconnaissance departments. In Chen Yuansong's report, there is a statement that Jiang Menggu took the lead in gathering people to beat him fiercely, which is further proved by the fact that Chen Yuansong and others were injured, and in the reconnaissance department's report, "Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing stated that Chen Yuansong was not allowed to make any kind of statement in the inspection department. If he leaves the inspection department, he is unwilling to take responsibility," etc. Therefore, there is no doubt that Chen Yuansong was indeed beaten. As for the detention of Chen Yuansong, according to the report of the inspection department, it was because Chen Yuansong's bodyguard suddenly showed a gun to demonstrate. The reconnaissance personnel saw that the situation was not good and were afraid of causing a major disaster, so they put Chen, Ke, and the bodyguard into the side room to take temporary refuge, otherwise the consequences would be even more unimaginable, etc., which is different from the details stated in the reconnaissance report that the department temporarily detained Chen Yuansong and others to wait for a solution, but the bodyguard Mao Lianke showed his gun and wanted to fire, and it is also different from Chen Yuansong's report that he was beaten and then detained, tied with ropes, and treated as a bandit. Proved by the fact that after the incident, the staff repeatedly violated the orders of the standing committee and refused to release him, and falsely reported the next day that Chen Yuansong and others were robbed and that all staff members held a meeting to strike, the staff of this association at all levels abused their power to beat and detain people and violated the orders of the standing committee. However, based on the above facts, the staff members' actions were excessive due to temporary indignation and should be held accountable, but they should also be understood for being motivated by patriotic enthusiasm. November 10th, the 20th year of the Republic of China, review committee members Hu Fengxiang, Hu Shuhua, Yu Hualong, Tao Baichuan, and Chen Tingrui. The original was signed by Hu Fengxiang, Yu Hualong, and Chen Tingrui.</p>
<p>Announcement Regarding the Confiscation and Storage of Japanese Goods: The Anti-Japanese Association issued Announcement No. 17 yesterday regarding the measures for handling confiscated Japanese goods, stating: "The measures for handling confiscated and stored Japanese goods were previously approved by the standing committee of this association and referred to the design committee for proposing a plan and reporting for review. Now, at the fourteenth executive committee meeting of this association on the 18th of this month, the draft plan proposed by the design committee was submitted for discussion. It was resolved that the measures for handling confiscated and stored Japanese goods should be formulated after the quantity of confiscated goods is surveyed and statistically analyzed. As for the measures for handling confiscated and stored Japanese goods formulated by the Economic Severance of Relations with Japan Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which were published in the newspapers a few days ago, although the 19th standing committee meeting of this association resolved to refer them to the design committee for reference, the committee published the formulated measures in the newspaper without obtaining the consent of this association, which is inappropriate. Therefore, it is solemnly declared that these measures for handling confiscated and stored Japanese goods will not take effect unless they are resolved by this association. Except that the survey and statistical procedures should be implemented after the survey department prepares a form and announces a schedule, this announcement is hereby made, and it is hoped that all sectors will pay attention."</p>
<p>▲Pei Changhao Violently Assaults Inspectors: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association received a confidential report yesterday that Pei Chang Iron Shop was privately importing Japanese iron. It immediately dispatched comrades Jin Yongchang, Zhou Weixin, and Yu Zuren to investigate the account books with Lu Jinsen from the reconnaissance department. Manager Feng of the shop refused the inspection, claiming that he would rather close the shop than be subject to the inspection of account books. At that time, Hua Jinzhang, an iron broker, and Manager Feng of the shop, without asking the reason, violently assaulted Jin Yongchang on the face and forcibly removed Lu Jinsen's badge, but fortunately did not snatch it away. Seeing their barbarism, the staff members twisted the broker Hua Jinzhang, who was an accomplice, to the association and reported it for disposal.</p>

<h3>Silk Rayon Weaving Trade Association</h3>
<p>Explains the Process of Changing to Run a Sizing Factory</p>
<p>▲Sends Letters to Wuxi, Wujin, and Other Associations to Clear Up Misunderstandings</p>
<p>Since the invasion of Northeast China by the violent Japanese and the nationwide implementation of the economic boycott against Japan, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association once sent a letter to the Silk Rayon Weaving Trade Association, instructing it to change the more than 60,000 yuan of cotton industry yarn factory shares previously collected to run a cotton industry sizing factory. The association then convened a meeting of initiators to actively prepare and sent letters to trade associations in various places to solicit shares. However, the dyeing and weaving trade associations in Jiangyin, Wujin, Wuxi, and other places had previously made a resolution when soliciting initiators for the cotton industry yarn factory that "the share money shall not be used for other purposes if the yarn factory is not established." Now that the cotton industry yarn factory has not yet been established, but the share money is suddenly changed to run a sizing factory, it is in conflict with the previous resolution, so they have sent letters expressing their opposition and refusing to join. The Silk Rayon Weaving Trade Association believes that changing the cotton industry yarn factory shares to run a sizing factory is due to the letter from the Anti-Japanese Association and is not the association's own proposal, and that opening a sizing factory is also an important task for saving cotton weaving raw materials. It cannot stop preparing due to the opposition of one or two trade associations. Therefore, yesterday, it specially sent letters to the trade associations in Jiangyin, Wujin, Wuxi, and other places to explain the process and methods, so as to clear up misunderstandings and encourage active share subscriptions, so as to unite and make the cotton industry sizing factory a reality as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Since Guo Waifeng, a special commissioner of the China Merchants Bureau, took office, he has strived to rectify and develop state-owned shipping affairs.

<h3>Disaster Relief News</h3>
<p>▲Office for Sheltering Disaster Victims Closes: The Office for Sheltering Disaster Victims in this city previously stated that various charitable organizations in this city are willing to take over the shelters and attached four measures. The office believed that the measures were not clear about the office's organizational system and its powers. If implemented in this way, it would inevitably lead to many obstacles and confusion of powers. It was decided to form a committee with each of the organizations to take over the shelters, and for the convenience of handling affairs, representatives from the Public Security, Social Affairs, and Health Bureaus could participate in the committee. It was requested to report to the government for approval and compliance. The office could transfer all the sheds, equipment, and disaster victims in the first shelter to the association for management. In the future, if more famine refugees enter the country, all matters related to keeping, supporting, and sending them back to their hometowns will also be handled by the association. The Public Security, Social Affairs, and Health Bureaus of this city cannot fulfill their duties of supervision and assistance at any time. After the shelter is handed over, the office will immediately handle the closure and report it to clarify the boundaries of authority and show good faith, etc., and report it to the municipal government for approval. Now, Instruction No. 12679 has been received, stating: "All items in the report are noted. It should be approved as requested and the closure situation should still be reported for record." This instruction has been forwarded to the Committee for Sheltering Disaster Victims for reference, requesting them to take over on a scheduled date and prepare for the closure. ▲Report from the Medical Team for Treating Disaster Victims: The Shanghai National Medical Association Medical Team for Treating Disaster Victims has been continuing to work hard for the disaster victims at the Liuying Road Disaster Victim Shelter.

<h3>You Bolu Case: Private Prosecution Withdrawn</h3>
<p>▲Postal Workers Union Requests Instructions</p>
<p>▲City Executive Committee Explains According to Law</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that the City Executive Committee previously received a report from the Shanghai Postal Workers Union regarding the families of the dead and injured in the You Bolu shooting of civilians case, requesting clear instructions on whether to withdraw the private prosecution and the right to independent prosecution in order to clarify doubts. It is heard that the City Executive Committee has clearly explained it according to the law. The original reply is recorded as follows: "The report is noted. This association's consultation with the municipal government to provide compensation to the family members is purely out of the family members' request, as the report says, 'with compassion,' which is an obligation. As for the attached private prosecution part, because the public prosecution and the private prosecution are the rights of claim arising from the same criminal facts, and are heard and judged in the same criminal trial. However, the purpose of the public prosecution is to prove the crime and apply the penalty, with national power as the main focus, and the principle of exercising authority, that is, the principle of intervention. The purpose of the private prosecution is to compensate for the damage caused by the crime, with the victim as the main focus, and the principle of exercising the right of disposal, that is, the principle of non-intervention. Therefore, whether to file a private prosecution, or whether to withdraw it after it has been filed, is up to the parties' intention and does not affect the public prosecution. According to Article 507 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the liability for compensation in civil actions incidental to criminal proceedings shall be determined in accordance with the Civil Code. Furthermore, according to Article 306 of the Civil Procedure Regulations, the plaintiff may withdraw all or part of the lawsuit before the judgment becomes final. Therefore, the private prosecution that has already been settled can naturally be withdrawn according to law, and the public prosecution will still proceed as usual." This is the reply.</p>
<h3>Li Pingshu Statue Model Completed</h3>

<h3>Death of a Japanese Ronin</h3>
<p>▲Impersonates a Chinese to Recruit a Prostitute for Company</p>
<p>▲Pawns Clothes to Pay for the Night</p>
<p>▲Only After Suicide Is It Known to Be a Japanese</p>
<p>The Japanese ronin, Ota Ryohei, was 29 years old this year and worked as a sailor on a ship, traveling between China and Japan from time to time. He spoke extremely fluent Ningbo dialect. He had no address in Shanghai. On the 15th of this month, he alone, using a Chinese name, changed his name to Yu Liren, 26 years old, from Ningbo, to a hotel opened by a Chinese at 491 Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, to rent a room to stay in. That night, he recruited a Chinese prostitute, Wang Asi, from Changshu, to spend the night with him. The next day, because he had no money, he ordered the tea boy to pawn his clothes for three yuan to pay the prostitute for the night. Then he asked for one yuan back for other uses and agreed that the prostitute would come again on the afternoon of the 18th. It is not known why the Japanese was stimulated and suddenly had the idea of ​​being tired of the world. On the evening of the 17th, he committed suicide by taking poison. It was not until 3 PM on the 18th that the prostitute Wang Asi went to the hotel again and ordered the tea boy to open the door and enter the room. He did not respond when called. Seeing him lying stiffly on the bed, he was already dead when touched. The hotel reported it to the police, who sent detectives to investigate, still thinking that he was Chinese. A medicine bottle was copied from under the bed and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy. Because no relatives could be found, they went to the hotel room again to check carefully. Three suicide notes were found in the bedding on the bed. One to the hotel, instructing them to notify Yu Linfa (fabricated), a relative of the family outside Ximen, Cixi, Ningbo. One to the Japanese consulate, and one to his friend Hyodo Eizan at 9 Sanyi Lane, North Sichuan Road. They immediately went to notify them and reported it to the Second Special Court to send personnel for inspection. When Prosecutor Lou Guangguang arrived at the morgue at 10 AM yesterday with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Zhao Yifen, the Japanese consulate had sent staff member Yamaji Yoshio and the corpse friend Hyodo Eizan to the place to identify the corpse and request to take it back for burial. After the prosecutor and forensic doctor verified that the deceased had indeed committed suicide by taking poison before his death, they questioned the tea boy and the prostitute about the circumstances of the discovery. The official instructed that the body be allowed to be claimed back for burial by the corpse friend Hyodo Eizan after he made a guarantee. Then the corpse friend brought the coffin to the morgue, and another Japanese man wiped the whole body of the corpse with potion before putting it in the coffin and carrying it to Zhabei for burial.</p>
<h3>National Products</h3>
<p>The Calcium Carbonate Raw Material Factory ships to the Greater China Rubber Factory. It is an independently funded establishment, managed by Xue Fuji, Wu Zhesheng, Yu Xingben, and others, who have studied in Japan for many years and have a deep understanding of industry.

The factory produces more than 20,000 pairs of Double Coin brand galoshes and athletic shoes for men and women daily, making it the largest rubber factory in China. In recent years, recognizing the lack of domestic manufacturing of raw materials, which relied on imports, and believing that this was not a fundamental way to promote national products, the factory prepared to build its own Greater China Calcium (i.e., basic industrial raw material calcium carbonate) Factory in the Xujiahui Road area of southern Shanghai last autumn. Mr. Zhu Huiren, manager and technician of the raw material factory, was commissioned to use the latest method, using machinery to refine carbon dioxide gas into calcium carbonate.

<h3>Apprentice Accused of Arson</h3>
<p>▲Because of Stealing Silver Dollars and Being Dismissed</p>
<p>▲Harboring Resentment and Committing This Heinous Act</p>
<p>Chen Daying, a 16-year-old apprentice from Haiyan at Wan Shen Soy Sauce Garden, No. 857-858 Zhoujiazui Road, after closing the shop at around 10 pm the night before, personally took a large pile of salt wrapping paper in the shop, soaked it with kerosene, placed it under the counter, and lit it on fire. In an instant, thick smoke filled the area, almost causing a fire. Yang Liunian, a fellow apprentice upstairs, noticed it, immediately went downstairs and shouted, and the shop owner Feng Fusong and others managed to put out the fire, fortunately preventing a disaster. The nearby fire brigade also arrived with their fire truck to put out the fire, but it was already extinguished. Detective Li Hongsheng arrested the apprentice Chen and detained him in the Huishan Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the case, and said that the police charged the defendant with arson under Article 187, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. The investigation revealed that the defendant had previously stolen silver dollars and was discovered by the shop owner, who wanted to dismiss him, leading to this disaster to vent his anger. Now, considering his young age and ignorance, he asked for leniency. According to shop owner Feng Fusong's statement, the defendant had been an apprentice in his shop for more than two years. In July of this year, ten silver dollars were lost in the shop. It was discovered that he had stolen them, and he was planning to dismiss him. He learned of this and committed this heinous act. According to the testimony of a fellow apprentice in the shop, Yang Liunian: "I sleep with the defendant every night in the pavilion upstairs. Last night, I saw him watering the paper with kerosene and setting the fire." According to shop assistant Xu Jimei's testimony, "The shop's rules are that after closing the shop every night, the defendant turns off the lights before going upstairs to bed, but this happened after I went upstairs." According to the woman Feng Jinshi, the shop owner's sister-in-law, who lived in the front building, "I heard Yang Liunian shouting that there was a fire, I ran downstairs in surprise and helped put it out. When I questioned the defendant, he firmly denied that he set the fire. I don't know anything about stealing silver dollars or being dismissed. Moreover, when the fire broke out, I had already gone upstairs and taken off my clothes, wanting to sleep, not in the shop." After reviewing the confession, Judge Shen Bingrong instructed the lawyer to defend the defendant once, and ordered him to be remanded in custody for sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<h3>Ye Zhongfang Accused of Trivial Matters</h3>
<p>▲Plaintiff is Neighbor Zhou Shen Yunzhu</p>
<p>▲Accused of Obstructing Freedom and Damaging Property</p>
<p>Ye Zhongfang, nicknamed "Little Shaker," and tea servant Xu Are, were recently sued in the First Special District Court by Zhou Shen Yunzhu, wife of lawyer Zhou Yanzuo, accusing Ye of obstructing freedom and damaging property. It is said that the cause of this case is extremely minor, and the case is quite laughable. Here is an excerpt from the indictment: "For obstructing freedom and damaging buildings, I beg you to punish the matter. The defendant Ye Zhongfang is a cohabiting neighbor (residing at No. 12 Jing'an Temple Road). He is a young man without a job. Every night, he summons three or four prostitutes, making loud noises and revelry until dawn. The house is a writing room style. Room 21, where Ye lives, is directly opposite the three-story building where the plaintiff lives. The plaintiff and her son Shi Gong cannot sleep peacefully all night, and their spirits are very painful. Now the young child is sick because of this (omitted). I have reasoned with him, but I have been insulted and scolded. On the 8th of this month at 9:00 am, Ye moved from Room 18 to Room 21, and deliberately instructed the second defendant Xu Are to dismantle the upper and lower stairs of the three-story building, move them elsewhere, and destroy the handrails installed on the stairs, instead of walking through the corridor on the south side. By the afternoon of the next day, because Ye refused to reinstall them, I hired a carpenter to install them myself. For one night and a half day, the plaintiff could not go downstairs. Therefore, the defendant has committed the crime of obstructing freedom in violation of Article 316 of the Criminal Law and the crime of damaging the property of others in violation of Article 382." Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefei ascended the Fifth Criminal Court to hear the case. Ye Zhongfang and Xu Are arrived at the court around 2:00 pm and entrusted lawyer Jiang Baolian to defend them. The plaintiff Xu Yunzhu was represented by her husband, lawyer Zhou Yanzuo, and female lawyer Shi Liang. Zhou Shen Yunzhu filed a case and explained the previous situation, her words being similar to the indictment, and will not be repeated. Then, according to plaintiff witness Wang Quangen's statement, he used to be a clerk in Zhou Lawyer's office and is now selling bean paste candy at No. 46 Guangdong Road. On the morning of the 9th of this month, because a friend surnamed Luo wanted to hire Zhou Lawyer as a legal advisor, he went there, but there was no one in Zhou Lawyer's writing room. He also saw that the stairs up and down the three-story building where Zhou Lawyer lived were also gone. He did not know anything else. When questioned, Ye Zhongfang confessed that the plaintiff's claim that he summoned prostitutes every night and reveled all night was not true. Even if women came, they were either relatives or wives, how could they be referred to as prostitutes? As for reveling all night, wouldn't I myself want to sleep? The plaintiff also said that dismantling the stairs caused them to be unable to go up and down for one night and a half day. On the night of the 8th, because a friend wanted to lease my room, I moved the items in my room to the next room that night. However, because a ladder blocked the corridor outside the door, I temporarily dismantled it with the permission of the rental agent's office. After the matter was completed, I immediately reinstalled it. Moreover, the second defendant Xu Are also lived on the third floor and still went up to sleep that night. Since Xu could go upstairs, the plaintiff could of course go downstairs. When Xu Are was questioned, he confessed that the stairs were reinstalled that night. Finally, the lawyers for both parties began to debate. The plaintiff's lawyer said that the cause of this matter was extremely minor and there was no need to delve into it. If the defendants could admit their mistakes, the court could slightly warn them and the matter could be concluded. Otherwise, please make a judgment according to the law. The defendant's lawyer said that the plaintiff's accusations were not supported by sufficient evidence and should be dismissed. The defendant Ye Zhongfang denied his guilt in court and said that he still needed to file a counterclaim for false accusation. Judge Xiao reviewed the confession and announced that the debate in this case was over and sentencing was scheduled for the morning of the 25th.</p>
<h3>Eagle Becomes Peacock</h3>
<p>▲Wang Yunfang Accuses Yongxing Silver Shop</p>
<p>▲Without an Apology, a Small Matter Becomes a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Wang Yunfang, a famous actress on the Tianchan Stage, on September 25, ordered her servant Afu to wipe a silver tripod given by a friend with silver powder. Afu accidentally broke the eagle's leg on the lid. She then entrusted the silver object, along with the eagle's footrest, to her colleague Cui Wanshun to be repaired at Yongxing Silver Shop on Guangdong Road, saying it would take about a week. She stated that the repair fee was one yuan. At that time, she asked the silver shop for a receipt, but the shop clerk said that they were old customers of Wang Ling, and such a small item could be exempted from this procedure. Cui agreed, thinking that no accidents would occur. Unexpectedly, when he went to pick it up on time, the eagle had become a peacock and was no longer the original item. He immediately argued with them. The shop clerk firmly denied that there was any mistake in replacing the eagle with a peacock. Cui had to return and tell Wang Ling. She was shocked when she heard this and went to the silver shop to see it. It was indeed true. She immediately negotiated with them, asking them to check if there was a mistake in mislabeling. The shop clerks, etc., said that this was the original item and there was no mistake. Wang Ling thought that the small silver item was not of great value and asked the shop owner to admit their mistake and express their apology. She would not pursue the matter. But the shop clerks, etc., not only refused, but also spoke rudely and unreasonably, saying that they were not afraid to resolve this matter through law. Wang Ling was extremely angry and hired lawyer E Sen to accuse the silver shop owner of breach of trust in the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the Third Criminal Court to summon them. According to the plaintiff Wang Yunfang, she explained the previous situation. When questioned, the manager of Yongxing Silver Shop, Zhang, confessed that the shop owner had important matters and had already left Shanghai. Because he was not in the shop at the time, this incident occurred. However, according to the shop clerks, it was the original item, which caused the loss of the old customer's feelings. Please forgive me. Judge Shen persuaded both parties and ordered Yongxing Silver Shop to return the original eagle or apologize to the plaintiff. He then ordered the case to be withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Appropriation of Funds from China Bank Branch</h3>
<p>Fang Dexin, a trainee from Anhui Province at the Shanghai Xiaodongmen China Bank branch, 16 years old, was induced by Li Jinwu, Hu Xuchu, Yu Jingtao, Fu Dayu, etc., in June of this year to hand over 6,000 taels of silver, a six-month bill of exchange from Zhejiang Xingye Bank received by the bank from Zaisheng Tobacco Company, to them to sign and collect in a false name and spend. He also hid the trainee in Li Jinwu's residence. After this matter was discovered, the trainee's parent, Fang Yunfu, brought his nephew back after searching and questioned him about the truth of the abduction. He hired lawyer Huang Shaochang to write a statement and filed a lawsuit with the First District Court of the Special District, accusing Li Jinwu, Hu Xuchu, Yu Jingtao (owner of Yu Xiaozhen Hotel), Fu Dabao, etc., of jointly defrauding money, slightly enticing and illegally detaining him, and requesting that they be arrested and dealt with. He also filed a private lawsuit to recover the losses. After the court approved the statement, it ordered Fu to be notified. Judge Xiao interrogated him a few days ago. In this case, Hu Xuchu was ordered to pay a security deposit of 2,000 yuan. The other defendants had not yet arrived. However, Fu Dabao has been arrested in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and has now been transferred to Shanghai. The trial is scheduled for 2:00 pm today. The plaintiff cited Articles 42 and 316 of the Criminal Law and requested that Fu, Li, and Hu be punished. Only Yu Jingtao should be punished according to Article 376, Section 2 of the Criminal Law as a warning. He also ordered the defendants to compensate 5,780 yuan in ocean dollars (including more than 2,000 yuan that had already been recovered to avoid losses).</p>

<p>▲Murdered by Someone</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 6:00 am, a floating corpse was found in the Huangpu River in Zhanghuabang, Wusong. The Songkou Lifesaving Bureau's patrol boat saw it and fished it out. It was discovered that the corpse was male, about 20 years old, with a monk's head, wearing a white velvet sweater on the upper body, black cloth pants on the lower body, and barefoot. There were several knife wounds on the neck, and it appeared that he had been murdered and the body dumped into the river.

<p>Stray Bullet Kills Tragically in Xujiahui, Shanghai West</p>
<p>The Sixth District and Second Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in Xujiahui has recently been under great tension due to the anti-Japanese situation and the importance of defense. The head of the branch led the police, carrying guns and live ammunition, on patrol day and night. Yesterday morning, the police chief of the Fahuazhen Police Station led the police on patrol. They passed by the Guandi Temple in Xizhen. Because the statues of the gods had been moved earlier, the houses in the temple are now being used to prepare for the establishment of a teahouse and entertainment venue to revitalize the market. The opening is scheduled for tomorrow. The police chief saw that there were many people in the room, so he went in to patrol. He then placed the firearms he was carrying on the table. At that time, a tea servant accidentally bumped into it, and the gun fell to the ground with a loud bang. The bullet shot out and hit the head of a Qiu boy who was present, and blood flowed all over the ground. He died within an hour. It is reported that the boy was ten years old and from Jiangbei. He has been sent to the Sixth District and Second Branch for legal processing.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Female Corpse on Route Pichon</h3>
<p>Around 8:00 am yesterday morning, the body of an unidentified girl, about eight or nine years old, was found near Huasheng Road on Route Pichon, Yangshupu. The street police at No. 2310 discovered it and notified the fire brigade by telephone.

A photo will be posted to wait for family members to claim the body.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Men, Women, and Children Missing</h3>
<p>Kidnapper Jiang Are, from Changshu, previously abducted Yu Xiaotang's five-year-old son Agen, a fishmonger, from No. 8 Deyi Lane, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei. He was arrested by the patrol police there and brought back to the Zhongxing Road Police Station. He was sent to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for questioning. He confessed to his accomplices, both male and female, and many abducted men, women, and children were recovered. After being identified, each family went to the district to pick them up. The families of the lost children were all deeply grateful. However, there are many kidnappers in the Zhabei area. Although they have been broken up many times, the trend of kidnapping has not diminished. Therefore, the number of men, women, and children who have gone missing in various places has been heard of every day recently. Here is a brief record of the recently abducted men, women, and children for the families of young children to be vigilant and to prevent problems before they occur. Zhang Yuanji, a native of Taizhou, at No. 141 Wuzhen Road, lost a six-year-old girl named Fen Yingzi. At No. 76 Nanxing Lane, North of Xinzha Bridge, a six-year-old boy named Lianxi. Shen Sanzi, a puller of yellow baggage carts from Yancheng in the North Caopeng area of Gonghe Xin Road, lost a four-year-old girl. Zhang Sanbao, a road worker living nearby, lost a five-year-old boy named Baobao. Yan Zihe at No. 695, across from the fire brigade on a section of Xinmin Road, lost a three-year-old boy. Zhang Baosheng, a native of Rugao, at the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Gonghe Xin Road, lost a seven-year-old girl. At the entrance of Tianyou Lane, Haichang Road, No. 478, two boys from Jiangbei went missing, one named Zhu Xiaohuzi, six years old, and one surnamed Yang, also six years old, wearing a blue cloth gown and white cloth shoes.

<p>Coal Freight Case</p>
<h3>Railway Department's Telegram to the City Chamber of Commerce Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Detailed Account of the Consultation Process Regarding This Case</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Railway Department yesterday regarding the coal transportation case on the Jiaoji Railway, detailing the process. The original telegram is as follows: Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Shanghai Coal Industry Association, China National Coal Production and Sales Association: Regarding the special price for coal transportation on the Jiaoji Railway, previously, this association, etc., forwarded telegrams from coal merchants stating the urgency of coal shortage in Shanghai and the need for coal from Shandong to alleviate the situation, requesting temporary cancellation to the Ministry. The Ministry has already responded accordingly. Subsequently, the Ministry also considered the coal shortage in various regions and the urgent need for relief, planning to temporarily suspend the coal transportation price increase for three months. However, since Shandong coal has always been primarily exported, accounting for the majority, this time, with the aim of alleviating the domestic coal shortage, all Shandong coal must be transported to Shanghai to alleviate the situation. Only in this way can all sectors of the country using coal enjoy the benefit of reduced freight rates, and the coal shortage will not materialize. Furthermore, with the reduction in freight rates, the railway and mines have a mutual obligation to support each other, and the coal merchants should also supply railway coal at a low price, according to the established practices of various railways. Therefore, after the representatives requested a postponement of the price increase for several months, the following three proposals were made to the coal merchants: (1) Shandong Province should make every effort to transport coal to Shanghai, exclusively for domestic use; (2) During this time of national crisis, coal prices must not be increased; (3) Coal for the Jiaoji Railway should be supplied at a low price as before. These three measures are the fairest and essential for alleviating the domestic coal shortage. The representatives have fully committed to the first two proposals, and expressed that they are willing to comply with the third proposal after consultation with the railway authorities. They also stated that they have telegraphed to advise against work stoppages. Unexpectedly, two days after the representatives agreed to the telegram, the work stoppage still occurred on November 1st. Later, the Shandong Zibo Zhangwei Coal Mining Industry Association submitted a report stating that regarding the above three proposals, only the second proposal was the same. As for the third proposal, when the Ministry initially requested that railway coal be supplied at the original price, the representatives changed it to only acknowledging a low price, without specifying the extent of the low price. Furthermore, they added appendices such as canceling the price increase and agreeing on fairness, with the aim of fundamentally overturning the agreed-upon plan. It is unclear whether the merchants, having sent representatives, are aware that the commitments made by the representatives are equivalent to the merchants' own commitments and cannot be changed. As for the first proposal, it is necessary to exclude mines that have existing contracts and are permitted to be developed with foreign investment by the government. It is found that most of the coal mines along the Jiaoji Railway are jointly operated with Japanese investment, and the coal produced is also transported to Japan. Only a small amount is usually transported to Shanghai. Now, if price increases are prohibited, it is inevitable that coal will still be transported to Japan for profit-making purposes. This time, the Ministry is reducing freight rates to alleviate the coal shortage, and coal mining merchants should also transport all their products to Shanghai or other parts of the country to alleviate the coal shortage. Now, the coal mining representatives declare that the complete alleviation of the coal shortage in Shanghai, which they promised, must exclude mines that have existing contracts and are invested in by foreigners. How much coal can be transported to Shanghai to alleviate the situation then? It seems that when coal mining merchants request reduced freight rates, they send out telegrams and appeals, using the domestic coal shortage as an excuse, implying that the bankruptcy of the national industry depends on whether Shandong coal can be transported to Shanghai. The inability to transport Shandong coal to Shanghai is attributed to the Jiaoji price increase of twenty cents. However, the result is that they are not at all concerned about the domestic coal shortage, but rather want to supply cheap coal to Japanese users, with the coal merchants profiting from it. The Association's current request for reduced freight rates is also intended to alleviate the coal shortage. Although the special price is planned to be temporarily suspended, if the coal merchants along the Jiaoji Railway do not alleviate the domestic shortage but instead alleviate the Japanese needs, this is probably not what the Association desires either. The Ministry, in addition to already rejecting the Shandong Zibo Zhangwei Coal Mining Industry Association's report for discrepancies with the representatives' promises, should instruct the Association on how to correct this situation in order to thoroughly alleviate the domestic coal shortage. The circumstances of this case are telegraphed for your information. Furthermore, regarding the second item, that all coal in Shanghai should not be subject to price increases, according to the representatives, there is a resolution to this effect, which has been promulgated. However, there are rumors that coal prices are still inevitably rising. We hope that you will provide details on how this resolution is formulated and whether it has binding effect. Please reply as soon as possible. Railway Department, sealed by Xiao.</p>
<p>Party and Government Organs</p>
<h3>Deadline for Datong Workers to Resume Work</h3>
<p>▲Failure to Comply within Three Days Will Be Considered Voluntary Resignation</p>
<p>▲The Company Is Allowed to Recruit New Workers to Replenish the Workforce</p>
<p>▲City Chamber of Commerce Telegram Urges Swift Cessation</p>
<p>Following the strike by all employees of the Datong Bookstore's head office in this city, the Party and government organs jointly issued a public notice yesterday, setting a deadline of three days for resuming work. Failure to comply will be considered voluntary resignation, and the company is allowed to recruit new workers to replenish the workforce. Worker Xu Xinong has been arrested, and the labor union has scheduled an emergency meeting today to discuss countermeasures. The details of each item are recorded as follows: ▲Deadline for Resuming Work (1) (Public Notice) The Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs jointly issued a public notice yesterday, stating that the workers of the Datong Bookstore arbitrarily went on strike on the morning of the 16th of this month and organized a strike committee to preside over the matter. Disregarding the national crisis and disturbing public order, it is clear that they lack a basic sense of righteousness. The Committee and Bureau have already jointly issued a public notice, earnestly advising them to resume work first. However, they have dared to adopt a wait-and-see attitude and disregard the law until today. In view of the current national crisis and to maintain public order in this city, the Committee and Bureau are unable to condone this behavior. They hereby jointly issue a public notice, instructing all workers of the bookstore to resume work by a specified date and await mediation by the Committee and Bureau in accordance with the law. If they fail to resume work within three days, the bookstore will be allowed to treat their actions as voluntary resignation and recruit new workers to replenish the workforce. They must not make a mistake. It is imperative that they comply. (2) (Instruction) The Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs jointly issued an instruction to the Publishing Industry Labor Union yesterday, stating that the workers of the Datong Bookstore arbitrarily went on strike this time without prior application or subsequent reporting. At a time when the country is facing a crisis, this is an act of disturbing public order. Furthermore, they have organized a strike committee to preside over the matter, daring to disregard the law and willingly destroy industry. It is clear that they lack a basic sense of righteousness. The Committee and Bureau have already jointly issued a public notice, earnestly advising them to resume work. However, they are still waiting and watching until today. Considering the difficult times, the Committee and Bureau are unable to condone this behavior. In addition to issuing another joint public notice, the Committee urgently instructs the Labor Union to comply and immediately take responsibility for advising the workers of the bookstore to resume work uniformly within three days of receiving this document and await mediation by the Committee and Bureau in accordance with the law. If they fail to resume work within the deadline, the bookstore will be allowed to treat their actions as voluntary resignation and recruit new workers to replenish the workforce. Furthermore, they must be thoroughly informed to avoid delay or making a mistake. It is imperative that they comply.</p>
<p>▲City Chamber of Commerce Telegram The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Department, Municipal Government, and Bureau of Social Affairs: Considering that the country is facing a crisis, labor and management should coordinate. The Party and government authorities of this city have jointly issued a public announcement that both labor and management should absolutely comply with. Now, the Datong Bookstore Branch Office of the Publishing Industry Labor Union, during the preparatory period, has not been joined by all workers and has taken illegal actions, confronting the employer and forcibly announcing a strike. If this is not swiftly and severely stopped, the bookstore's business will be impaired, and the issue of local public order will be greatly affected. It is reasonable to report the situation and request your review and approval, swiftly order a cessation, and impose penalties in accordance with the law to maintain business. This is for the public good. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, respectfully.</p>
<p>▲Company Notice Datong Bookstore yesterday announced to the striking workers that a portion of the employees of this bookstore illegally went on strike on the 16th of this month. On the 17th, the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs jointly issued a public notice, strictly ordering an immediate resumption of work. Fearing that the striking workers were not fully informed, this bookstore published a notice in the newspaper, extending the deadline to 12:00 noon on the 19th for a uniform resumption of work. However, in addition to a small number of people who have already extricated themselves and returned to work, the rest are still waiting and watching, coerced by malicious elements. Today, the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs have jointly issued another public notice, setting a deadline for resuming work. If they fail to resume work within three days, they will be treated as voluntary resignation, and new workers will be recruited to replenish the workforce. In order to respect the laws and decrees of the Party and government organs and to promote the awakening of the striking workers, this bookstore hereby publishes another notice, hoping that they will all go to the factory to sign in and resume work before November 21st. Otherwise, this bookstore will have no choice but to comply with the order and dismiss them in accordance with the law. This is a special announcement.</p>
<p>▲Labor Union Meeting A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited the Datong Branch Office yesterday and asked about the workers' opinions. According to them, all employees were unable to bear the pressure and were seeking to improve their treatment and conditions. The company had no sincerity in accepting their demands, leading to the strike. Currently, as the conditions have not been adequately resolved, the Party and government organs have jointly issued a public notice, setting a deadline for resuming work. However, the workers' opinion is that they will not resume work until the conditions are met. Moreover, the Labor Union has scheduled an emergency plenary meeting of the board of directors at 9:30 AM today at the Labor Union in Daqing Lane, Fusheng Road, to discuss important countermeasures. The employees will naturally await the Labor Union's orders.</p>
<p>▲Worker Arrested After the strike by the workers of the Datong Bookstore, the Haining Road Police Station dispatched armed plainclothes police officers to station there for the sake of local public order. At around 8:00 AM yesterday, some non-union workers prepared to enter the company to work. The striking workers believed that they were disrupting the strike discipline and tried to dissuade them. The stationed police officers intervened and detained Xu Xinong, a worker from the typesetting department, who was advising them from the side, and took him to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, he was transferred to the Special District Local Court for review.</p>

<p>Report on Southern Fujian Opium Situation from the Anti-Drug Association</p>
<p>This city's Chinese National Anti-Drug Association previously received reports from the Xiamen Anti-Drug Association and various organizations in Southern Fujian regarding the military's encouragement of opium seedling cultivation and the collection of taxes. This was previously reported. Now, the Association has received another telegram from the Fujian Provincial Anti-Drug General Office, stating that opium is being extensively cultivated in various counties of Fujian Province this year, mostly encouraged and taxed by the military. Opium seedlings have already been planted in Southern Fujian, as well as in Putian and Funing. Chen Zhijun, Lin Zhiren, Chen Qiyu, Hong Zhemin, and others have been approved to contract opium taxes in Zhangzhou. It is heard that the method of collecting taxes in Longxi is in the name of paying off road debts, distributed according to the number of porters usually assigned to each village. Tong'an has the highest tax amount, reportedly set at 1.2 million yuan. Chen Brigade Commander is still sending personnel to collect taxes in Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, Anxi, and other counties. He Xianzhu, the commander of the 8th District Bandit Suppression Command, has also appointed Chen Jianming, the director of the Putian Financial Reorganization Office, to concurrently collect opium seedling taxes. 30,000 mu of land have been planted in Xianyou County. More than a dozen officers have been dispatched by the Marine Corps in the five counties of Funing to encourage cultivation and distribute taxes, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in recent years. The Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee is limited in its power and cannot negotiate with the military. The provincial government still has no concrete measures. The Association urgently requests that you forward this to the National Government, urging the Fujian authorities to strictly prohibit cultivation, and also request the commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to swiftly issue a strict telegram to stop the military. If they dare to protect opium cultivation, they should be executed in accordance with the law. A special investigator should be sent to Fujian to conduct an on-site investigation, which may still offer some remedy. It is heard that the Association has already forwarded the information as requested. At the same time, the Association also received telegrams from the Fuding County Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, and the Fuding All Circles Anti-Drug Movement Committee, stating that local tyrants and evil gentry in the county are relying on the power of the local military garrison to establish an Agricultural Research Institute, summoning local pests to the city for meetings and inducing farmers to cultivate opium seedlings in order to extort taxes. Unfortunately, many villagers have been seduced and are implementing cultivation. The intensity of the opium scourge is unprecedented. This phenomenon, after the central government reiterated the opium prohibition, is uniquely similar to that of Anhui Province. It is heard that the Anti-Drug Association, in view of the rampant opium cultivation, will shift most of its efforts to deal exclusively with opium cultivation incidents in Fujian and Anhui.</p>
<p>Various Labor Unions Telegraph the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<h3>To Revoke the Representative Status of Hou Dachun</h3>
<p>The Shanghai labor unions sent a telegram to the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing, stating: Urgent, Nanjing Fourth Plenary Session Representatives' Assembly: Hou Dachun embezzled relief funds, and the accusers have filed a lawsuit with the court. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association and the Party Department have solemnly investigated the matter. Finally, the Shanghai Party Department submitted the case to the central government for severe punishment. Hou's suspicion of embezzlement is recognized by the public. During the central government's investigation period, Hou should be suspended from exercising all Party rights. Based on this point, on [day unclear], all Shanghai labor unions telegraphed the Credentials Committee of the Assembly, Chen, Zhou, and Ding, requesting the revocation of Hou's status as a representative to the Fourth Plenary Session. The request was not approved, causing public outrage. Today, we telegraph the Assembly again, urging you to approve and implement the request swiftly in order to uphold Party discipline and avoid disputes. We also pray for a clear response.

<h3>"Northeast and Japan" Publication</h3>
<p>The book "Northeast and Japan" was recently compiled and printed by the Northeast News Agency. The content is exceptionally rich. At a time when the Japanese invaders are rampant and taking advantage of every opportunity, our countrymen are deeply saddened and determined to study the Northeast and Japan in order to resist aggression and seek survival. This book by the News Agency aims to awaken the people of the country through the power of written propaganda.

<h3>Reader Correspondence</h3>
<p>(Mr. Yuan Xiluo's Message: Selling Clothing to Reward Ma Zhanshan's Army)</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, is able to resist the violent Japanese with a lone army and fight to the death. He is truly a good soldier of our Republic of China. Although Xiluo has been idle for a long time and lacks the wealth to reward his troops, he feels uneasy in his heart. Now, he has pawned a fur coat for ten national currency dollars and mailed it to your newspaper office, asking you to remit it to the front lines to comfort the patriotic heroes of our Jiang province. Furthermore, Xiluo plans to sell calligraphy to raise funds, and all proceeds will be used to reward the troops fighting against the violent Japanese. Five-foot-long couplets are priced at five yuan each, and screens are double the price. He respectfully requests your newspaper to promote this and collect the items and payments on his behalf, accumulating the total amount to be remitted to the front lines, making a small contribution as a member of the nation to express respect for General Ma Zhanshan and the patriotic soldiers under his command.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your letter and ten yuan in postage stamps, as well as a pawn ticket, have been received. Your patriotic enthusiasm and grand wishes are inspiring, and your words and actions are moving and praiseworthy. Regardless of General Ma Zhanshan's ultimate victory or defeat, it will be enough to inspire ordinary soldiers. However, this newspaper has not collected this payment on your behalf, and it is inconvenient to remit it. We have forwarded it to the "Life Weekly" for collection and remittance and have published your letter in the newspaper to encourage broader action.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Bing's Message (Reporting a Fact of Humiliation by Japanese Soldiers): The fact occurred in front of our school (Gordon Road Zhengfeng Middle School). The time was 1:00 PM today (the 16th). Two classmates were traveling from the off-campus dormitory to school for class. On the way, they encountered five Japanese soldiers who, without reason, attacked them with clubs. We were unable to resist and had to report it to the police station. The police station did not give a practical response. It was reported to Headquarters. I really don't want to write more, just ask the teacher to comment on this matter and give us guidance. It is best to publish this letter. (Answer) Were you able to see and remember the Japanese soldiers' numbers clearly? This kind of thing can only be reported to the local police authorities. If they did not handle it, or wanted to handle it but couldn't, it is their dereliction of duty. Otherwise, we can only respond by increasing our fervor for resistance against Japan. Every person who hears this news should respond by increasing their fervor for resistance against Japan. Every time they commit violence, we must increase our fervor for resistance against Japan once.</p>

<p>Marshal Foch of France</p>
<p>European War Diary, Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Because the Allied governments requested that I prepare detailed recommendations from a military perspective, the spokesman of the Allied governments, Mr. Clemenceau, invited me and Commander Pétain to meet in Paris on October 24. We verbally agreed on the terms of the armistice. The decision on the blockade was maintained, and the duration of the armistice was shortened.</p>
<p>Our army had continued to make progress since October 8, so our conditions could be more forceful and specific.</p>
<p>The next day, I convened a meeting at my headquarters in Senlis, inviting the three commanders-in-chief of the American, British, and French armies, as well as the chief of staff of the French Navy, Terpon. I sought their opinions and asked them to propose armistice conditions. The chief of staff of the Belgian army was unable to arrive in time due to the distance. He arrived in Senlis the next day, reviewed the armistice terms, and expressed his agreement.</p>
<p>Marshal Haig spoke first, stating that in his opinion, the German army had not generally collapsed to the point of being unable to resist. The German army could still defend the borders with equal or superior forces. However, the British army was short 50,000 infantrymen, the French army was exhausted, and the American army was not fully organized. Therefore, he argued that the conditions for Germany should not be too harsh. His conditions were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Withdrawal from Belgium and the occupied parts of France. (2) Withdrawal from Alsace-Lorraine, with Metz and Strasbourg handed over to the Allied forces.</p>
<p>(3) Return of vehicles and locomotives to France and Belgium, and repatriation of French and Belgian people.</p>
<p>I did not consider his proposed conditions to be sufficiently justified and did not discuss them further. In the past few months, the German army had suffered significant losses in defenses, soldiers, and military supplies. A defeated army cannot be considered brave. The German army was already at the end of its rope. As for the Allied forces, all they wanted to admit was that the victorious army was no longer a fresh force. Our army had fought a great victory, and the war was so intense that the sacrifices of the victorious army were naturally greater than those of the defeated army. However, although the German army had not completely disintegrated, it was no longer significant. Next, Commander Pétain advocated making it impossible for the German army to fight again. His conditions were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Allied forces should occupy the left bank of the Rhine River from the Dutch border to the Swiss border, including the bridgeheads on the right bank, with a deadline of fifteen days.</p>
<p>(3) The German army should hand over 5,000 complete locomotives and 100,000 train cars.</p>
<p>Next, Commander Pershing expressed his view that the military situation was favorable to the Allied forces, and strong demands should be made on Germany. His conditions were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The enemy forces should immediately withdraw from the occupied areas.</p>
<p>(2) Allied forces should occupy Alsace-Lorraine.</p>
<p>(3) The German army should withdraw from the right bank of the Rhine River, and the Allied forces should occupy the bridgeheads on the right bank.</p>
<p>(4) There should be no opposition to the maritime transport of American troops and their military supplies. (5) Residents of the areas occupied by the German army should be immediately repatriated.</p>
<p>(6) All submarine bases should be handed over to the Allied forces or neutral countries.</p>
<p>(7) Vehicles and locomotives should be returned to the Belgian army.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, we drafted the military conditions to be presented to the Allied governments as follows: (1) Immediate withdrawal from illegally occupied areas, namely Belgium, France, Alsace-Lorraine, and Luxembourg. Immediate repatriation of residents of all areas.</p>
<p>(2) The enemy army should hand over 5,000 artillery pieces and 100,000 machine guns.</p>
<p>(3) The German army should withdraw from the left bank of the Rhine River, and the Allied forces should occupy the four bridgeheads on the right bank at Mainz, Koblenz, Cologne, and Strasbourg, with a radius of 18 and 3/4 miles. A neutral zone of 25 miles wide should be established on the right bank.</p>
<p>(4) The enemy army should not cause any destruction or damage in the areas being evacuated. (5) 5,000 complete locomotives and 150,000 train cars should be handed over.</p>
<p>(6) 150 submarines should be handed over, and the surface fleet should withdraw to the Baltic Sea ports. The Allied fleet should occupy the naval ports of Cuxhaven and Heligoland.</p>
<p>(7) The blockade should continue during the period of fulfilling the above conditions. On the afternoon of October 26, I personally took this draft to Paris and handed it to the President and the Prime Minister. President Poincaré immediately stated that these conditions would be rejected by the Germans. I replied, "Then we can only continue the war, because the Allied forces have now progressed to this point, and there can be no halt until the German army is unable to resist and the guarantee of absolutely certain peace is secured. Our army will obtain this peace with supreme sacrifice." The military advance of our army toward Berlin cannot stop until we control the barrier of the Rhine River.</p>
<p>On October 29, I sent a letter to Prime Minister Clemenceau, asking him to pay attention to the tendency of the Allied forces to propose excessively harsh naval conditions, which might make things difficult for the army. Therefore, I requested to participate in the decision-making process before the final draft of the armistice conditions was finalized.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 31, the leaders of the Allied governments convened their first meeting at the residence of Colonel House, President Wilson's special envoy in Paris. At the beginning of the meeting, it was learned that Turkey had signed the Armistice of Mudros, and Austria had also surrendered. This news made it easier for me to express my views on the general military situation, pointing out how favorable the situation was for the Allied forces. In the past three months, the German army in France and Belgium had been utterly defeated, and their retreat was rapidly accelerating. More than 260,000 German soldiers had been captured, and 6,000 artillery pieces had been lost. The military situation within their country was no longer sustainable. Our army, however, was able to maintain its combat power along the entire 250-mile front throughout the winter. There was no question that our army would continue to fight and annihilate the enemy forces.</p>
<p>After I finished my presentation, Colonel House asked me about my views on peace or war with Germany.</p>
<p>I replied, "I am not fighting for the sake of fighting. If an armistice can lead to the German army accepting the Allied conditions, I am satisfied. Once this goal is achieved, no one has the right to cause further bloodshed."</p>
<p>That afternoon, the Supreme Military Council held a plenary meeting in Versailles to discuss the armistice conditions for Austria-Hungary. I was again invited to express my views. I reiterated my morning's proposal, believing that the Allied forces' situation was becoming even more favorable.</p>
<p>On November 1, the Council began to study the conditions for Germany in detail.</p>
<p>In the morning, the main meeting of the Allied governments was held in the Ministry of War in Paris. After the conditions I proposed for the occupation of the left bank of the Rhine River were read out, discussions began to give Marshal Haig the opportunity to re-express his views and re-submit his memorandum of October 25. This memorandum was in fact the proposal of Lloyd George and others.</p>
<p>This memorandum proposed that the Allied forces halt at the borders of Belgium, Luxembourg, and Alsace-Lorraine, that is, stop at the left bank of the Rhine River. The Allied forces would not advance to the Rhine River. The barrier would be right in front of our noses. This was militarily unacceptable. In this way, Germany could still rely on the protection of the Rhine River, use the time of negotiations to reorganize its troops, and, in the event of a breakdown in negotiations, take advantage of a situation unfavorable to the Allied forces to resume hostilities. The benefits gained by the Allied forces through hard fighting would inevitably be lost in an instant. If the armistice treaty could not enable the Allied forces to control the Rhine River, peace would be in danger of failing.</p>
<p>My proposal was ultimately accepted. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Rescue Team</h3>
<p>Ke Wang</p>
<p>In this time of declining public spirit, a major stir occurred at the school on Taopu West Road. Dozens of students stretched their necks, watching the large announcement posted on the wall. The sound of chatter filled the school. It turned out that the announcement was a declaration by students Liu Zhang and others to organize a rescue team to Heilongjiang. In this noisy excitement, my hot blood drove me to sign up and join. The declaration stated,</p>
<p>"We are going to the gun fire of the Heilongjiang front with a spirit of sacrifice, regardless of everything, to do rescue work. Because we have neither guns nor cannons to kill the enemy, nor money to contribute to a national salvation fund, we saw General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang bravely fighting the enemy, a lone army without support, and our blood boiled. Therefore, we are now organizing a rescue team to Heilongjiang to fulfill a bit of our responsibility as citizens."</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM today, when a meeting of the Heilongjiang rescue team members was called in the third-grade classroom, three issues were raised:</p>
<p>1.  The prerequisite problem: the number of people and money.</p>
<p>2.  The steps to be taken: requesting spiritual and material assistance from all parties.</p>
<p>3.  The date of departure: within three days.</p>
<p>While these three issues were not fully resolved, our passionate classmate, Mr. Zhang Gan, the initiator, picked up a small knife and suddenly cut off his left index finger to show his determination. He also donated the thirty-yuan postal money order sent by his family with their blood and sweat to the team as basic funding. At that time, Mr. Zheng also donated ten yuan. In a short time, many students made donations; I cannot remember their names. This kindness, this generosity, attracted the attention of the students. This declining public spirit, because of this small group, may arouse temporary excitement, and then our trip will not be in vain.</p>
