<h3>美代表列國聨行政會</h3>
<p>馬占山率部堵擊張海鵬軍日飛機又在通遼投擲炸彈張作相在平設吉省府行轅艾迪博士發表瀋案證明書</p>
<h3>美國接受請書</h3>
<p>吉爾白以旁聽資格參加國聨行政會議</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國已接受國聨行政會之請書派員參加行政會之討論、美國在接受國聨正式請書以前、巳有訓電發致駐日内瓦美代表吉爾白、文曰、今授權與爾、參加行政會關於凱洛格公約可能的實施之討論、爾須向國務院報告討論之結果、以便决定可能的行動、如爾出席於此次爭執之任何其他討論、則祇爲旁聽人云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晚國聨行政會舉行公開會議時、美代表吉爾白起稱、美政府已接受行政會之請書、渠將以請書中所規定之資格行事、在此國際惶恐深切之時、美國承行政會邀請參加與巴旣黎非戰公約有關之討論、殊爲感謝、凡根據國聨會章而提出之任何辦法美國不欲揷入、再在會章下任何行爲之决定、美國亦不欲參加、但巴黎公約載有現任國聨行政會議長白里安及前任美國務卿凱洛格兩發起人之名字、此約在美國觀之、乃指導世界輿論之種有效力的工具、爲僅用和平方法解决兩國間爭執之後援、及時行使此種世界輿論之力量、當可奏阻止國際和平破裂之效、若國際和平破裂、則影響將遍及全世界云、吉爾白末乃盛稱白里安維護和秤之功、英總代表李定對於行政會在此事上决議之結果、表示滿意、並謂渠初次代表英國出席國聨行政會、適遇美代表與會、復有白里安爲議長、渠引爲大樂云、除日代表芳澤外、其他會員皆對於會務之進行、表示欣幸、意代表格蘭第謂此會表明美國供獻其在國聨工作中之合作、西班牙代表瑪達利迦稱、東西現爲和平之利益而聨合、中國總代表施肇基稱、中美間之大洋、其名太平、乃此兩國對於他國關係之象徵、散會前、美代表吉爾白向行政會各會員道謝其歡迎詞、並謂各會員之意見、與美國適同、尤所欣感云、美國旁聽員之第一次出現於行政會議席、就表現於外之觀念點言、乃一偉大成功、旁聽席人極擁擠、對於會議非常注意、在開議之前、芳澤趨至吉爾白之前、而與之握手、此亦大可注意之事也、今日午後芳澤不帶隨員、獨訪英外相李定談一時半、聞促膝密談、並無切實結果、截至目前、迄未有日本準備將其軍隊撤回南滿鐵路區域之表　、衆覺在此時際、行政會會員間私人談話、或可較公開的討論更爲有益、故明日各會員仍將有非公開之談話、據負責方面消息、此間未聞有日本將退出國聨之建議、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>國聨行政會昨開秘密會議</h3>
<p>對日軍撤退問題擬覓一折衷辦法</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨行政會會員今晨有非公開之會議、但午後或舉行公開會議、今日之重要發展、爲一般人主張滿洲日軍必須撤回鐵路區域、以便利雙方之談判、行政會各會員除中日兩國代表外、今晨集議於國聨秘書長之辦公室、作秘密會議、美代表吉爾白亦與會、東京傳出日本有退出國聨可能性之消息、已引起國聨方面之痛苦的印象、但衆望此事不致實現、以免增重業已困難之時局、滿洲問題現入於緊要聨級、因眞正辦事之時期、今已至矣、此間有一種堅强人氣、以爲日軍須退至原駐地點、以便利兩國開直接談判、若日本以日軍退後、日韓人民易受危險爲慮、則行政會可建議派員實地監視、如是華人當不致有暴行、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）行政會秘密討論歷兩小時半之久、今日尚將繼續進行、各員均允暫守秘密故會議情形、毫未外洩、惟聞目下雖尚未獲有决議、但談話進行、頗形順利、某會員曰、各事進行之佳、一如豫望、中國代表團仍時時以所接南京報告滿洲日軍活動之電報、送致國聨秘書處、其中多屬日飛機飛過及以炸彈擲擊中國各城鎭者、意外相格蘭第因須於十月二十一日赴析林、故定今夜離日内瓦、其行政會職務、將以謝樂嘉爲代、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨事事會今晨十一時三十分開秘密會議、續商滿案、中日代表俱未出席、美代表吉爾白則列席參加討論、下午時十五分散會、定晚間六時再開據稱、明日星期日或將照常開會、聞理事會現仍集中其努力於尋覓一方式、俾中日可藉此直接外交談判、又聞秘書處及國聨其他機關中人、日來主張非至萬不已時、當避免施用會章第十六欵者漸衆、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨行政院深以撤退日軍爲念、在中國人士之意、無論何項談判、必俟日軍撤退後始可　舉行、此在日本則以締</p>
<h3>完全國貨立勃絡髓上海南市虹橋福康西藥店製</h3>
<p>功效，補血變質强壯。藥方，以國文載明仿單内。</p>
<p>比較，有簡易試騐法印送（仿單試法可先寄）</p>
<p>本藥爲一種有機鐵化合物。恰如「食物内之鐵，於小腸吸收後，與生質精結合，而存於肝臓内，以備增補血色素及赤血球之用者」相同的人工物。補血極效。更能發育各組織。亢進新陳代謝。可使全身健旺。體重增加。皮膚佳良。凡急性慢性等血虧，神經衰弱，皮膚慢性病，病後未能復元，婦女月經不調，萎黄病，小兒發育不良等，均效甚。與外國上等製品無稍異，而價比廉甚。每大瓶僅售一元四角，大人約可服十六七天，願國人比較之。此藥係特别化合，與普通補血鐵劑不同，故過胃不生變化，至腸即可吸收，奏效甚速，而無害胃腸。惟特異性人，及病有咯血吐血之勢者，仍以忌用爲是（凡藥之含鐵或砒等，均宜注意禁忌者）結一種原則上之協作爲先决條件、日内瓦方面擬覓折中辦法、一面由日本分期撤兵、一面即於撤兵期内由中日兩國開始談判、此層中日兩方意見亦不一致、中國之意無論談判情形若何、日軍必須繼續撤退、日本之意則反是、此外尚有較嚴重之困難、即在日本所謂原則上之條件中、此項條件幣原不願向中國駐日公使提及、日内瓦方面則嚴守秘密、據本社所知、其中至少有一項未便加以考慮、其餘各項或可提出討論、綜觀以上各節、行政院尚在多事之秋、而日軍又日以轟炸爲事、尤足使行政院爲難、但白里安藉其個人力量、卒獲極大勝利、可視爲來日之佳兆、（哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>施肇基電告法國調停方案</h3>
<p>（北平）施肇基電副張稱、白里安對中日調停方案、（一）日撤退佔領地駐軍、（二）由第三國派員監視中國接收、（三）俟一二兩條實行後、再由中日兩國直接交涉、（十七日專電）</p>
<h3>施肇基報告東省日軍行動</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）今日中國施總代表報告理事會、（一）日軍在吉建築廣四百畝之航空塲、（二）十四日日軍用飛機在興隆店抛炸彈二十枚（三）蒙匪在遼寗境内攻擊東北軍第四十團、經激戰四小時、始將匪徒却退、死二百人、當雙方交綏時、有日軍飛機六架向華軍轟擊、（四）接北平電告、十五日日軍在巨流河附近挖掘戰壕、埋設地雷、（五）同日日飛機復轟擊錦州、（六）迄今日軍仍在瀋陽城四周挖掘戰壕、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日據國聨秘書處職員見告、中國總代表施肇基博士致理事會之照會報告等、迄今己達七十一件、最近又報告北寗路有日軍五列車、於十四日自新民向錦州進發、又通遼地方、十四日有蒙匪俄匪四千、攻擊中國軍隊第十四團、受重創而退、當交綏時、有日本軍用飛機盤旋天空、觀於日本曾以瀋陽中國兵工廠之軍火接濟蒙人、此舉亦必有衙大意義、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>備而不發之日政府聲明書</h3>
<p>關於美國參加問題</p>
<p>從法律點提出異議</p>
<p>（東京）外務省關於國聨邀請美國代表之决議、協議結果、以爲聨盟今次决議、違反關於國聨理事會之構成規則、因此於昨日下午由外務省發表日本政府之聲明書、其内容如次、日本深信美國之努力、對於世界和平有大貢獻、國聨之請非會員國代表參加會議之决議、未曾有其前例、並於國聨任何規約中無此規定、故國聨招請美國代表一事、實損害國聨理事會之組織規章、今次理事以本問題爲僅僅手續問題、而用過半數票决之方法、日本政對此抱有重大疑義、日本政府行將對理事會要求考慮此點（十七日日聨社電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省對於滿洲事變之態度、從今晨起由幣原外相等從事協議、結果决議不發表聲明書、（十七日日聨社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日政府尚欲得某數點之明白消息、然後始宣佈其對於國聨决議之態度、</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>故已於今日午後續發訓令致芳澤、向國聨有所詰問、其要點爲國聨請美參加之决議、是否合法、及國聨未先决定其行爲是否合法、遽即進行之問題、並囑芳澤聲明凡與非戰公約有關之事件、美代表始許發言、但日本自信現有事態、旣非戰爭、亦不致引起戰爭、故未有援用非戰公約之需要、再若認時局須援用非戰用約、則何以僅獨請美國、而不請非戰公約其他簽字國與會、聞日政府以爲依此根據、俄政府應更有被請與會之理由、因俄國對於滿洲關係更爲密切也、但致芳澤之訓令中、則未提出此點、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　國聨行政會邀、美國參加討論之决議、已引起日本之反響、各界多視此爲無理威脅、並主張政府應仍堅持其政策、有若干派具有勢力者、且主張如屬必要寗願退出國聨、而不願在與國家生存至有關係之問題上接受指揮、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日本重臣等因時局重化、擬開重臣會議、現由某方面非公式徵求政府對此意見、該會議以西園寺元老爲中心、牧野内府·山本權兵衞·倉富·平沼樞府正副議長·若槻首相等均出席、必要時再請南陸相幣原外相列席、（十七日日聨社電）</p>
<h3>日使出淵訪晤美國務卿</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　此間官塲中對於美國之接受邀請、與日本之反對、無甚評論、今日日本大使出淵訪國務卿史汀生及國務副卿凱塞爾、晤談甚久、事後出淵語華盛頓新聞記者、日本人民崇謝史汀生之合作態度、聞出淵昨曾電勸日政府對於美國之接受國聨邀請、宜出以和婉態度、謂美國對於滿案態度、僅可稱爲完全中立云、（十六日國民社電）</p>
<h3>日本態度頑强</h3>
<p>欲以退出聨盟要挾</p>
<p>（東京）　據今日之情形觀、日本退出國聨之可能性、似較無條件撤退滿洲鐵路區域外各地點軍隊之形象爲大、惟政界似仍抱覔得一種方法、保全中日國聨各方面顔面、而免用嚴峻計畫之希望、此間深覺國聨之邀請美國參加、足以鼓勵中國避免直接談判、若國聨與美國不助中國張目、則中國不久必與日本談判、國聨若不能實行其决議、固將危及其本身之存在、而國聨若堅决主張干涉、以解决此次爭端、則日本亦覺將危及其國家之存在、日本所欲者、根本的與永遠的解决、而非暫時敷衍的休戰、據此間負責任方面聲稱、唯中日直接談判、始可達到此種解决云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　上院領袖今日開會通過决議案、促政府堅守原定之政策、勿顧國聨目下之决議、南陸相今日與參謀長會商後、向報界宣布、無論國聨或其他第三者取何途徑、日　對滿政策、决不更變云、今日日文各報一致抨擊國聨之决議、謂日本應放胆前進、無所顧忌云、朝日新聞謂國聨之行動、於爭端之解决、無絲毫裨益、且貶世界對國聨之尊重云（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>馬占山率部堵擊張海鵬軍</h3>
<p>海拉爾滿洲里駐軍動員</p>
<p>日飛機到嫩江以東偵察</p>
<p>（北平）　日軍恐俄方誤會、十六派飛機至嫩江東岸偵察、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　卜奎謡言甚盛、馬占山率部擊張海鵬部、海拉爾滿洲里駐軍已動員、决包圍張部、澈底肅清、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　據哈爾濱電稱、張海鵬部經日人供給餉械、現抵泰來鎭、將洮昂路江橋炸斷、被于兆麟部會同屯墾隊將張部擊敗、哈埠物價飛漲、人心恐慌等情、當局即覆電稱、日軍對黑省絶不敢派軍深入、日機越中東路遠襲卜奎、於軍事上無大効力、張部人僅數千、現雖依仗日勢倒行逆施、但日方對俄亦有顧忌、張部斷難持久、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　張海鵬部由洮南北開、向黑省進發、巳過泰來鎭、進抵嫩江、因洮昂路江橋被駐軍炸斷、尚未過江、黑軍亦沿江北岸佈防、阻止該部前進、尚未正式接觸、日前張部與突泉屯墾軍激戰終日、張部有退洮南說、張景惠已派員往勸、請勿入黑、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）萬福麟談、張海鵬爲人爽直、或不免受人利用、張部共計四團、近聞收編土匪、爲數亦不過二千人、前張電科、謂受日軍壓迫、請准予開駐黑省、當局恐生他變、電張制止、張不聽、突北開、黑軍乃不得不防止、馬占山部已到省垣、龍江駐軍原有衞隊團、現又開到步兵團、騎兵二團、已足制止張部前進、必要時、尚可調沿吉中東路各站所駐吉軍协助、省垣治安無碍、現當局已派員前往調往、并勸阻張氏、勿再北進、免爲他人利用、（十七日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>九月十八到十月十八</h3>
<p>今日爲十月十八。軍九月十八晚在瀋陽暴力發動迄於今日。恰爲一月。國人其思念此沉痛之一月。究如何度過在此恥辱之一月中。又竲做何事。如曰「臥薪嘗膽。」則此一月即爲我全體國民臥薪嘗膽之時如曰「雪恥圖强。」則此一月亦即爲我全體國民奮發自雄之開端。九月十八爲何日。九月十八以來全世界注目以視側耳而聽者爲何事。有血氣之國民。應不能忘。尤應不忍忘。</p>
<p>吾人今日之所以曉曉致詞者非着目於土地之喪失與軍事之勝負勝負</p>
<p>爲戰爭之常。而况我國今日實際尚未一戰。喪失土地。亦爲世界各國所常見。何况暴日今日尚未敢明目張膽吞併我東北。大戰以後德意志其處境不可謂不艱難。然而至於今日。日耳曼民族在世界上又嶄　露其頭角。列强都刮目相看。故吾人今日之所注目者。不爲一時之勝負。不爲九月十八日吾民族所蒙受之創痛。亦不爲九月十八以後吾民族所蒙受之有加無已之暴行。而爲九月十八所給予吾民族之反應如何。九月十八以後吾民族意識覺醒。如何曾。做一些什麽。</p>
<p>誠然以九月十八禍變之刺激。亘一月之奔走追呼。國内之和平統一。已漸次有成爲事實之可能。假使最近將來之和平統一會議。能順利進行。使各方能各得其滿足之願望。則「和平統一。」能得在事實上實現。不可謂非九月十八晚禍變之賜。然而吾人與其以此而自慰。母寗以此而痛哭。國勢至此。倘若猶齗齗於彼此意見之爭持。則不啻表示各領袖。尚酣於私爭。毫無悔禍自贖之誠意也。誠然以九月十八禍變之刺激。我全國民氣已激昂萬狀抗暴自救。萬口一聲。請願。從軍。演講。集會。遊行。排貨。斷指。血書。痛哭。陳辭。種種。可以表示我激昂之民氣者。無不盡有然而激昂民氣。類難持久講演遊地可以促民族之覺醒。但講演遊行而外。尚有最重大最有意意之工作。急待吾人切實動手做。德國於大戰之後。國脈僅存一線。予取予求。一惟戰勝國意志之所欲。而尤以距大至於無可　數計之軍費之搾壓。更幾於使日耳曼民族永無伸頭之希望。然而彼德國國民人人忍死血涙。抑制悲憤。不作空泛之呌喊。不洒怯弱之痛涙。以沉毅之精神。一致之步趨。瘁其心力。努力於其本身責任之實踐運用其剛毅而有力之鐵腕。挽回其一息僅存之國運。以視我國人今日之徒然呼號囂呌。不求工作之切實有效。吾人仍不能認爲九月十八之禍變。已給予國内要電二</p>

<h3>裏下河排水工程計劃</h3>
<p>江北運河工程善後委員會前日開會、通過工程委員須愷提出之裏下河排水工程計劃、並議决推須委員先行察勘後、由工程工賑兩處會同建設廳積極辦理、茲將計劃全文錄上、</p>
<p>甲·歸海港現狀　裏下河湖蕩河渠縱横交錯、欲明其系統、别其原委、深感困難、入概言之、其地勢低窪、形類斧底、以射陽等湖爲瀦水之腹、東北由馬家蕩經阜寗、出射陽港、迤南由建港溝皮大蟒蛇諸河、出新洋港、上官海溝諸河、出鬥龍港、東南則由白塗車路諸河、出王家港與竹港、是爲裏下河排水之孔道、縱貫其間者、河道亦殊複雜、最重要者、爲串場河東與范公堤相并、沿堤閘洞甚多、用以洩水、分由諸小口歸納五港以入海、五港或則港身紆曲、或則海口高仰、以致水流滯緩、積水難消、考其洩水之功效、則以射陽港爲最暢、新洋鬥龍次之、王竹兩港爲最劣、據運河工程局援用民十水面坡度、與各港斷面推算、各港最大洩量、射陽港約爲一千七百立方公尺、新洋港五百立方公尺、鬥龍港六十立方公尺、王家港四十立方公尺、竹港則未經估計、大概尚較小於此、上述洩量、其數值雖不能恃以爲準、實足以表示各港排水效能之比較、</p>
<p>乙·疏浚五港　疏浚入海五港、擬將河流之過於曲折者裁直之、斷面過小者擴大之、海口地勢高仰者浚深之、近海之處、防滷潮倒灌、更應建閘壩以操縱之、已分别擬具計畫、略述如下（一）射陽港、裁灣取直三處、共長約一一七公里、挖土約八二○○○○方、挖成以後、距離可縮短約三七九公里、海口建閘壩一座、以財力與工賑關係、可暫以土壩充之、（二）新洋港、裁灣取直七處、共長約五六五公里、挖土約一四三○○○○方、挖成以後距離可縮短約二九七公里、上游天妃閘至新河口間、及東門閘河减水河二支流、均須放大、下游海口亦建土壩一座、（三）鬥龍港、裁灣取直十二處、共長約五三公里、挖土約四六○○○○方、挖成以後、距離可縮短約四○九公里、上游自草埝閘起及其支流牛灣河、均須酌量放大、海口建土壩一座、（四）王家港、裁灣取直十處、共長約二三公里、挖土約六○○○○方、挖成以後、距離可縮短約八方公里、下游海口高仰須開浚之、計自袁家墩至活大拉子扣去裁灣原河、約長一四三五公里、挖土約一三○○○○方、挖成以後、洩量約可增加一倍、又下游河身斷面反較上游爲小、越乎常軌、能力所及、亦應續爲放大之、海口建土壩一座、（五）竹港、下游自甜水了子至三條港間、河槽高仰、須挖除之、約長一九五公里、挖土約一○○○○○方、挖成以後、洩量約可增加三分之一、河身正槽亦須酌量施以浚渠工程、海口建土壩一座、</p>
<p>丙·添闢新港　五港地位徧北、東台以南興泰東各屬之積潦、概須遠道北行、方可歸納、故無論爲目前救急計、爲永久利賴計、東台附近及其南部有添闢入海新港之必要、查東台梁垜安豐富安等地、皆有運鹽海河、西連串場、河東向亘延五六十里至七八十里不等、而沿海亦均有大港、苟將河港開浚銜接、可立成排水入海之必要道、應即派員測勘、擇定最適合者興闢之、</p>
<p>丁、歸海港施工程序上述各項計畫、應將王竹兩港先行疏浚、蓋兩港與受災最烈之興化一帶相接、而其淤塞亦最甚也、惟現時積水未退、人工難施、應盡力借調挖泥機船、先於下游開挖中槽一方、借助於水力之冲刷、一方繼續施以機力人力之開浚、從速完成海口工程、以助目前急切之排洪、東台新闢河港、應立即派員測勘、一俟測勘完成、立可興工、蓋該區地形較高、目前尚未淹水、正可召集附近災民、提前施工、以求速效、至於所有裁灣取直工程、一俟各該段地面水退除、迅即分段同時舉辦、</p>
<p>戊·腹地排水工程　上項計畫以外、更當疏浚串場河以西連接五港諸河道、蓋若諸河不暢、裏下河之排水、仍不能收完滿之功、諸河之中、當取其途徑最短、水流較暢者、首先施工、茲暫擬疏</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>接要聞</p>
<p>浚之河凡五、建港溝皮大河蟒蛇河海溝河車路是也、其土方等項、容俟參閱詳圖、續爲估計、又串場河與五港相交諸閘壩、及范公堤沿堤洩水諸閘洞、亦應連帶興修、能如此則裏下河排水工作方可大體完成、治標治本、均蒙其利矣、</p>

<h3>日本擁護滿蒙權益秘密會議紀錄譯要（四續）</h3>
<p>按滿洲善後條約會議之時、清國委員聲明、謂「清國爲欲保護南滿洲鐵道利益、在該鐵道未收回以前、承諾不在該鐵道附近建設並行幹綫、或害該鐵道利益之支綫、」讀此可知南滿路之於滿洲、確似有其神聖不可侵犯之獨占鐵道權、彼奉派之欲接軌前記各鐵道、及建設東兩大幹綫者、無不與此聲明相抵觸、我國如以此爲原因而干涉之、彼所計劃之鐵道網、無不應受我之制裁、此乃帝國對滿蒙交涉最有效力之原動力也、無如國際法之精神、獨立國之國防建設、皆可基其自主的行動、故我雖有上述清國委員之聲明、亦不能藉以阻其全鐵道之建設、然擇其重要路線、藉此權利以破壞之、尚無不可、然又不幸各法律家對於該項聲明、謂其僅能作爲一種希望、不得恃爲正式利權之主張者、大有其人、其要點如左、（一）旣非明載條約上者、不能作爲條約的正當利權之主張、（二）清國委員、事前事後皆未得清皇之勅許、其聲明顯係越權行動、依國際法不生效力、（三）明治三十八年十二月二十日日清滿洲善後條約並附屬條約締結之時、在本條約第二條、謂「日本政府承諾遵行清　兩國間所締結之租借地並鐵道敷設所關之現行條約」云云、然清露間之鐵道條約中、無有所謂不建並行線之條件、果日本强欲以清國聲明爲有效者、顯係與本條約第二條所載的矛盾、（四）該項聲明」清國······」云者、於冒頭清國二字之下、旣未有「政府」字樣之標明、自然此聲明責任、不得爲清國政府應須負荷之解釋······加之「所謂保護其南滿路之利權」云者、事屬政府對民間事業奬勵保護之意、其保護期間如何、政府皆有自變更之權利、（五）該項聲明如果有效、則南滿路一舉而可爲滿洲獨占的交通鐵道、徧查世　各國無此先例、如有之則與人類進貨及幸福之原則相違反、（六）明明違反華盛頓會議之對華領土保全及機會均等原則、（七）聲明中附近二字之解釋、頗難一致、果以幾里或幾十里之距離爲附近乎、以上之法律論者、多爲英德之法學家、而我國亦頗不乏人、然······中國非法律國家、且其人民亦缺乏法律知識、帝國若以此爲原因、而臨之以威嚴、吾人深信奉派必能以何等利益與我爲交換、而解决滿鐵之懸案無疑也、······至於洮昂吉敦四洮各懸案、多爲金錢上之關係、惟洮昂之顧問權、與吉敦之會計權、因欲牽制其鐵道網之繁榮並抽收其勢力與機能計、是亦甚必要者、故對此權利、必努力實現之、方可堅固帝國之特權、餘如吉敦洮昂等路之滿鐵包工、本皆使用我國出産之賤價材料、但仍以高貴之外國製品爲基礎而沽價焉且興築應用之人員、亦由帝國便宜的而增加其計算、因此工費頗爲多額。彼奉派雖知之、亦無與我清算之知識及證據、……我則促其與我計算此費、待明白後、乘其財政困難之今日、以如數償還迫之、彼必與我接近而商量延期、或締結正式借欵條約、然我爲藉此以導滿鐵於利計、可犧牲前記建設費用一部份、而誘其與我協定滿蒙鐵道運動、再不然者、則犧牲四洮路延滯利息、以與之交換貨物吸收區域之協定、彼如誠意與我作如此之協定者、任彼如何發展其鐵道網、我滿鐵决不懼其包圍、</p>
<p>關於運費協定、須使奉派鐵路運費與南滿路運費同一、至其同一之基礎、以每噸每哩運費若干爲單位、不論其距離長短、互依此協定之額計算之、蓋將來奏派之東西二大幹綫成功之時、北滿特産經葫蘆島出口者、其産地與該港之距離、較請者大連出口之哩數爲多、……自必增長其運費之担負至若協定外之競爭、奉派無非以其政治的勢力爲後援、我則以港費倉庫料飲水料等之降下、又以我調整的金融機關之機能、與貨主以方便及利益其最後戰勝之榮冠、必屬諸我、又奉派鐵道每亂降其運費、使彼沿綫華煤、如萬馬奔騰之勢以進出我撫順煤本年之減收、因實在此、倘協定運費成立、華煤必有一部份流入滿鐵、遂可使其成本增重、而無力與撫順煤爭、</p>
<p>關於貨物吸收區域之協定、茲擬定步驟如左（甲）滿鐵之東方、以五常吉林海龍等爲中心線、出産物在其西者歸滿鐵吸收、在其東者歸奉派鐵道吸收、鐵道之西方以齊齊哈爾洮安通遼寗爲中心線、出産物在其東者歸滿鐵吸收、在其西者歸奉派鐵道吸收、（乙）在滿鐵西部方面自四平街至洮南以北之産物歸滿鐵、餘者歸奉派鐵道、在滿鐵東部方面、由長春至吉敦以北之貨物歸滿鐵以南歸奉派鐵道、（丙）如甲乙二案奉派皆不滿足、則略仿南滿路與中東路協定之例、南下貨物、滿鐵得其四四奉派鐵道得其五五、此不問其出口由大連或由葫蘆島或由營口、到時總計其數而按分算之、是爲帝國最後之讓步、（丁）依上例甲乙丙三案、均不能達到目的者、則求張學良之同意、招集中東南滿路各當局與奉派共同開會、商議其協調方法、</p>
<p>然吾人之理想、以爲欲確保帝國滿蒙權益於永外者、應藉南滿路作日華合辦、以實現共存共榮爲招牌、運動奉派以其鐵道網與南滿路合併、皆爲合辦事業、如此方法、（一）可揉消帝國主義之惡名、（二）可混淆華民之聰明、（三）可遮斷歐美資本勢力之侵入、萬一有事之秋、帝國藉合辦權利、不論何路、皇軍皆可自由微發及占用、爲帝國遂行滿蒙最後目的計、不得不深長謀慮如此、近接倫敦情報、驚知奉派又欲伸其魔手於秦皇島、以强固其抗我之原動力、不幸彼所運動之「自由運貨採算港」如得實現、我滿鐵及大連港、更受意外之打擊、現雖以日本郵船會社之勢力、在倫放向歐州復興「運貨同盟本部」以破壞之、然尚未可樂觀、尤可痛者、赤俄本有誠意與我締結密約、以防奉派勢力之進出、不料一見奉派魔手再伸至秦皇島、遂恐海參崴及中東路之繁榮受其大影響、乃乘奉派送彼以秋波之時、毅然激變其主張、與奉派作具體的接近、益使帝國單獨受敵、</p>
<p>依滿鐵駐天津通信員之情報、謂奉派運動秦皇島香港爲自由運貨採算港、如成功時、北寗路擬更建設第三埠頭、俾可收容五千噸汽船九隻、合舊所有、其收容力可達十萬噸船之巨、如此則秦皇島港貨物集散能力、一舉而達五百萬噸、將來再以其東西二大幹線爲武器以培養之、誠堪制我大連港之死命、……北滿特産由産地至出口、如論離、彼只近我滿鐵區區三哩、然以運費比較之、……我到底不能與彼競爭、我滿鐵及大達汽船會社等、受秦皇島之威脅、將視葫蘆島爲尤甚、</p>
<p>吾人早知張學良外交手段之巧妙、故未赴任之先、拜訪林權助老前輩、求其指導對張學良外交之策略、幸林先生不我遐棄、授我以秘策、謂張學良雖爲軍閥之子、爲一白面書生其實策略非常豐富、雖世界之外交國如英吉利之老外交官、視之亦猶不及、與渠辦外交時、必須先以恭敬親順爲前驅、時而發揮假誠意、代渠作有利於彼之談話、方可誘其信用、次則爲造監督當局種種强硬主張以嚇之、終則求其爲我輩保全飯碗、懇渠同情的解决交涉各案、然尚須防備者、切不可被渠反用此策以對我云云、吾人在任地參考林總領事之意見、並洗練滿鐵對張作霖時代種種外交之歷史、以爲林權助先生之敎訓、洵爲對張學良之良策、吾人或者依此而運用、亦未可知、此回帝國對張學良發揮外交權者、認時機爲最適合、因此而能博得全部成功固好、以最惡之結果而言、帝國如不能實現旣得各鐵道權利者、奉派亦須中止其東西二大幹線之建設、蓋帝國在滿蒙之特殊地位與權利、如可保持現狀者、自可使救滿鐵於埀危、縱將我旣得各鐵道權利　諸有耶無耶之鄉、帝國外交、亦可謂一部奏凱、蓋將來自有天賜機會、以解决滿蒙一切問題、</p>
<p>上述爲交涉失敗時最少限收穫之豫想、吾人甚望其不至如此地步、至於左列各項、係欲作本回交涉之前驅、已得仙石總裁之裁許、而林總領事及關東司令官關東廳長官等、亦已充分諒解、倘能實現、自可爲交涉成功之滿點、（一）滿蒙鐵道問題、係屬民間營利的會社、如滿鐵者之利益關係、故應視作地方問題、以張學良爲擔當長官、倘張學良以滿蒙外交權旣已、歸併南京爲口實、而欲逃避其責任者、最少限度、必須張學良代替南滿會社向南京政府交涉、（二）滿蒙鐵道之欲開發、必須以日華共存共榮當主眼、其東西二大幹線、如有妨害南滿路之利益、或與南滿路平行者、皆須休止其建設、方不危害我之旣得權、（三）帝國屢抗議旣建設成功之路、如吉海打通等、爲共存共榮計、可默許之、但須以何等條件爲交換、並保障滿鐵營業上之利益、（四）洮昂與打通之聨絡、此與滿鐵並行、爲危害旣得權之尤者、故通遼洮南路、絶對不許建設、（五）洮昂打通如必欲聨絡建設者滿鐵亦欲建設培養線、以保其權益、（六）長大路及吉會路、欲求即時實現、（七）滿鐵關係所未解决之各鐵道借欵及顧問權與會計權實現之件、（完）</p>

<h3>華租當局會商維持租界治安</h3>
<p>俞鴻鈞昨訪費信惇</p>
<p>保護北四川路華人</p>
<p>昨已派義勇隊戒備</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>自北四川路日本浪人屢次挑釁後、張市長前已向日總領事村井、面提抗議、且得村井面允、極力設法、勸告日僑、但前晚該項事端、復有發現、未見止息、於全市治安前途、仍非長治久安之計、昨日、市政府爲謀全市安寗·及防止該項糾紛事件、重有發生起見、特由秘書長俞鴻鈞、於上午十時、正式往訪工部局總裁費信惇、當面協商華租雙方共同負責維護全市治安之確切合作辦法、結果、費信惇甚贊助市政府維護治安防止糾紛之意、並表示决再加派崗位、儘力維持、務使此等事件、不再發生云、</p>
<p>關於此事、工部局亦極爲注意、昨爲實行維持治安起見、已由上海萬國商團、派定俄籍義勇隊一隊、計五十人、於昨晚起、分配於北四川路一帶、從事戒備、而防日浪人之暴動云、</p>
<p>華東社記者昨訪俞秘書長、據俞氏談、日本浪人迭次在公共租界方面無端挑釁、毆辱吾租界市民、無理撕毁標語、實非文明國人士應有之態度、本人曾於上午往訪工部局秘書長費信惇、要求其充分以合作之精神、保護租界華市民、並制止日浪人之一切野蠻行爲、蓋吾國民衆、激於義憤、與愛國心所驅策、所以揭貼標語、一致抗日、此種舉動、於法律上並無越軌之處、乃日人一再挑釁、顯圖引起重大糾紛、工部局責職所在、應即嚴厲取締、費氏當表示工部局對於日人挑釁、業已盡力制止、並函請日領約束僑民、此外增派警捕、隨時彈壓、亦已實行、工部局對於此項嚴重之事態、已極盡其維持治安之可能、惟希望中國民衆、務持鎭靜、並勿有激烈而引起日人惡感之圖書標語、致增加糾來紛、本人當表示吾國民衆、對日本强暴之態度、均極鎭靜、激烈之圖畫標語、工部局方面旣不能指出任何華人所爲、則安知其不係日人之架空誣陷、費氏當表示工部局對於租界市民、必能予以充分之保護云、</p>
<h3>國難聲中機關職員應守之態度</h3>
<p>如有意見只能建議</p>
<p>一律停止宴會娱樂</p>
<p>市政府訓令　上海市政府昨（十六）日訓令各屬局云、爲令遵事、案奉行政院五一四一號内開、案奉國民政府第四八零號訓令開、爲令遵事、案奉中央執行委員會特字第九六七號函開、查自瀋陽事件發生以後、中央與政府已决定方針、宣告全國、凡屬機關人員、自應遵照中央政府意旨、齊一步驟、以爲國民表率、不應自爲主張、致紊系統、茲經本會决定、凡國民政府所屬機關人員、對於暴日事件、如有意見、應呈由各該機關主管人員、建議政府、不得任意對外發表言論、特此函達、即希查照、通飭遵照爲荷、等因奉此、自應遵照、並轉飭一體遵照、此令等因、奉此、除分令外、合行令仰該市政府、即便遵照所屬遵照等因、奉此、除分行外、合行令仰該局遵照、併飭所屬遵照、此令、市長張羣、</p>

<h3>日本之陰謀</h3>
<p>最小目的築成吉會路</p>
<p>最大目的佔整個東北</p>
<p>月給熙治以三百萬元</p>
<p>昨據熟悉日本情形者、語記者謂、此次日本出兵遼吉、誠非偶然之事、蓋以蘇俄五年計劃埀成與其在東北利益、有衝突之慮、故出兵侵滿、益見急進、近年復以吾東北外交一切聽命中央、日人詭計不得售、故憤而出兵、突佔遼吉、關突佔遼吉之最小目的、乃在築成吉會鐵路、故近日日夜動工、期於最短期内、完成此路、國聨限日於十四日以前撤兵、吾知吉會路一日不成、日軍决一日不撤也、然日本爲鑒於近日國際之情形、一方面遂積極用以華制華之策、對我國人挑撥離間、使之自殘、去年十二月七日下午三時、日政府開擁護滿蒙權益秘密會議、松田拓相·仙石總裁、及外務省兩次官等、均出席、對侵吞東北、趕築吉會路、及以華制華之政策、更有確切具體之决議、此次日本威脅利誘熙洽輩之組織僞省署、按月由日方接濟三百萬元、並約定佔一月給一月、以遂其擁兵築路之陰謀、今國聨限期撤兵之期已過、而日兵未撤且有進逼之勢因日人最小目的、尚未完達、而最大目的之佔領整個東北亦在步步試探、望國人省惕云、</p>
<h3>大批日本浪人到滬</h3>
<p>已自大連到百餘人</p>
<p>俟得經費即行活動</p>
<p>日本前派大批軍艦到華、原望有所藉口、以實行積極行動、而遂其打破我國民抗日救國運動之陰謀、無如我各地愛國運動、愈接愈厲、一面嚴守秩序、日本無可奈何、到華軍艦、遂有廢然而返之消息、近有客自大連歸、據談、日本軍人、鑒於國際形勢不佳、對華無口可藉、遂秘派大批浪人以滬活動、現在絡續來滬者、已有百餘人、每十人爲一組、每組中備手槍者二人、以四人專在各處挑釁搗亂、其餘四人、則任通風報信之責、一經發生事端、則日本海軍陸戰隊、即可小題大做、造成嚴重局面、若輩正在籌備經費、一有的欵、即開始正式活動云、</p>
<h3>又有日本陸戰隊到滬</h3>
<p>日本海軍省、自調派大批陸戰隊來滬後、茲又從第二海軍區吳鎭守府海軍團内抽調海軍陸戰隊官兵三十名、由吳轉神户、乘上海丸輪來滬、昨日、該隊官兵、已經上陸、即派在虹口隊内、留駐上海、</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨日下午二時有日海軍陸戰隊約二百名、由天龍艦登岸、開往北四川路江灣路兵房、又有大宗軍火運往靶子路營房儲藏、</p>
<h3>日本干涉大連海關與瀋陽郵局</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日本陸海軍官吏封鎖大連港、干涉中國海關行使職務後、茲悉海關當道已加以注意、又瀋陽日軍事長官不准中國郵局匯欵出境、亦違犯萬國郵會章程、及條約規定、料中國政府將向日政府提出强硬抗議云、</p>
<h3>日輪繼續停班輟業</h3>
<p>華人赴連困難　上海運赴南滿貨、昨日仍可報裝、惟中國人往大連灣者、則在到埠時、檢查十分嚴密、但實際上對華人出入該港尚無顯著禁阻、故昨日長春丸出口、華人已無赴大連者、至於中國船之行駛大連者、本埠政記公司尚在派航、因其船長與大二副均用日人、故得出入便利、其他華輪、已完全停往矣、</p>
<p>川湘日船全停　揚子江上游川河與湖南兩處之日本船舶、因此次抵制激烈、往來均無貨件、日清公司在前日已先將上海宜昌輪大亨丸大吉丸休班、今又將行駛川河之重慶班輪雲陽丸·宣陽丸·德陽丸·長陽丸·涪陵丸·及嘉陵丸·等輪亦全體不開、至於湖南班内之沅江丸·武陵丸等、今已調漢、供載日僑、亦不開班、揚子江上游、可稱無日輪航運之踪跡矣、</p>
<p>中日商輪亦停　大阪商船會社、在最近一個月來、在中國各路航輪、咸受抵制影響、旅客斷絶、百貨無裝、除政府命令船、以運郵關係、無法停業外、今議定者、將上海至日本横濱班、與日本横濱大阪至南華廣州班兩路、先行正式停航、已將承行該路之船、暫行調至台灣、至在福建汕厦各路之輪、雖未休業、亦毫無生意云、</p>
<p>海關船牌問題　照海關定章、凡屬商輪停止行駛、如在三個月中、可以復班、倘滿三個月、而尚未復航者、則照定例、將關内所出之船牌即行撤消、不許該輪開班、我國如能本此抵制精神、繼續堅持、則雖收回日船在華航權、亦屬不難也</p>
<h3>抗日會執委陳松源包庇奸商</h3>
<p>三檢查員押入捕房</p>
<p>保鑣拔出手槍恫嚇</p>
<p>國民社云、昨日本埠抗日救國會自得　大祥等私進日貨之密報後、即由該會特别來察隊長蔣夢谷·蔡蓮蓀·率領檢察員吳之屏·葛季光·汪文·等前往小東門協大祥洋布貨號檢察、當查得該號日貨、業由洋貨業公會封閉小部分、大部猶作門市出售、謂係舊存宿貨云、嗣經該檢察隊澈查進貨簿、則其日貨乃多屬新進者、該隊與之理論、勸其封存不果、答稱、猶待二小時之商議、無何、該隊乃馳赴源昌祥洋布號、另行檢察、詎源昌祥以迅速之手段、盡由公會紛將日貨自加封條、該隊以封條新加、漿湖未乾、應加檢騐之必要、即索貨簿來查、但其他簿據盡有繳出公鑒、而洋貨簿終不得一見、正在爭閙之際、陳松源自外入聲稱、以洋貨業公會主席委員之資格、担保一切、該隊力爭、不予通融、而陳松源復以抗日救國會執行委員資格、聲稱、並無分派該隊前來檢察協大祥之語、紛論猶未已、西捕突至、竟將吳葛汪三檢察員帶入捕房、蔣隊長等無法、即返天后宫、而陳松源又馳至、雙方爭論不得决、詎陳執委之保鏣突出手槍示威、全體職員大譯、該會衞警見勢不佳、遂將保鏣繳械禁閉、</p>
<p>又訊、該會自將陳松源之保鏣禁錮後、全體職員、本抗日救國之重任、雖經該會其他執行委員之保釋、全體俱加否認、不予通融、聞定明日上午開執行委員會妥議解决方案云、</p>

<h3>華僑李雨軒加國求偶糾紛</h3>
<p>欲以二百元得一舞女</p>
<p>因錢太菲而好事不成</p>
<p>發覺蟻媒販買人口事</p>
<p>男女紹介人交保候訊</p>
<p>有張志謀者、向在荷屬南洋華僑所辦之小學充當敎員、此次與華僑李雨軒回國至滬、寓新世界飯店二百四十四號、李已年逾知命、生長南洋、其來滬目的、爲</p>
<p>尋求異性伴侣　、以娱暮景、惟人地生疏、助不諳本國語言、故託張探訪、張素與西藏路七十八號廣善醫院主邵岳峯友善、及轉煩邵徵求、邵即謀於浙籍婦人吳曹氏、該氏遂告以住居南京路大慶里一百十四號之徐陳氏、慣爲蟻媒、苟給以重酬、事必可諧、並介徐陳氏與邵晤會、該氏自言有女桂珍、年方待字、現爲</p>
<p>大東舞塲舞女　倘李不嫌陋質、自可奉爲箕掃、隨出桂珍倩影、交由邵轉致、李雨軒認爲滿意、惟恐事成後、或有李代桃僵情形、故主張應先與桂珍一晤、邵等報可、爰於十五日使雙方正式會面、旋即議及身價問題、據邵轉述李意、願致送二百金、徐陳氏雖嫌其數太微、但亦不便要求增加、</p>
<p>僅云容再商榷　遂無結果而散、乃翌日吳曹氏因女兒與永安公司劇塲職員王某發生戀愛糾葛、被王以誣告罪控由第一特區地方法院、諭令交保、經邵得悉、深慮該氏倘無人拒保出外、則李所委之事件、勢必進頓、爲促成李與桂珍、</p>
<p>實現結合起見　尚須借重吳曹氏之　項、故特向法院將該氏保出、並藉此恩惠、要挾其速將桂珍獻於李雨軒、謂李是夜即須登輪、遄返南洋、不能久待、吳曹氏以桂珍旣非已出、何能擅允、並對邵言、彼方不獨嫌金錢太菲、抑復更</p>
<p>憎李老而且醜　事實難成、邵聞語竟大怒、一面將吳曹氏監視行動、一面以電話向老閘捕房報告、佯言頃有一販賣人口之女拐匪、經渠扣留在院、請速派探拘究、捕頭立飭探員陳永貴馳往查詢、邵乃指吳曹氏即係拐匪、該氏則將經過情形覼縷剖述、陳探員遂將邵與氏一併帶回捕房、繼復往大慶里將徐陳氏、及十一歲女孩小毛、連同張志謀、續予逮捕、並查明徐陳氏頗有</p>
<p>販賣人口嫌疑　蓋陳桂　珍與小毛俱非該氏親女、桂珍原姓張、其父名張　天、十一歲時、被賣於該氏爲女、而小毛原籍蘇州、去冬始由父母價買、邇來該氏因桂珍年長、目能　色藝月博多金表面似甚珍愛、其對付小毛、仍百般凌虐、帶入捕房後、騐出</p>
<p>手臂傷痕猶新　捕頭遂飭探員送小毛往醫院治療、其餘男婦四名口、分别收押、昨晨、解送第一特區地方法院、由許庭長提審、捕房律師汝保彝述明破獲情形、復以對邵·張兩人及吳曹氏、是否有販買人口等行爲、尚未查明、故暫不起訴、惟請仍予覊押、以便詳細偵查、至陳徐氏之傷害罪、已有相當證據、今僅以二九四條起訴、其他行爲、亦須查明定奪云云、旋由陳桂珍陳述昔年</p>
<p>被父母價賣事　並稱十五日之往新世界飯店、伊雖同去、但祇知爲普通游玩、不悉其内幕作用云云、質之邵·張·均稱、李係欲娶婦、故如談妥、當依禮結婚等語、許庭長嗣諭邵岳峯交二百元保、徐陳氏交三百元保、張志謀·吳曹氏·均各出外、聽候續訊、</p>

<p>（十）現存日貨由抗日會保管應該怎樣發落、是一個值得研究的問題、私進的日貨當然没收、因爲聽見要抵貨、連忙在實行檢查之前進日貨、最不可恕當然作爲私進的日貨、這一點可以騐提貨單定貨單及他票據、並且可以召集人證審問、這種貨物如果放他過去、那麽豈不是每次抵制日貨之前先替他推廣銷路、至於那些確在抵貨以前的定進的日貨、如果永遠封存、商家本錢完全没有着落犧牲太大、比較可行的辦法是聲明這些日貨在半年後再公開發賣、（不賣給店家只賣給私人一面准許商人用這一筆貨做押欵、那麽商家損失還有一個限制、爲什麽已登記的日貨不可以立刻就無限制的集中發賣呢、假如上海某種日貨存積六萬件、在平時六個月内可以賣脫、如果這六萬件由抗日會立刻無限制的發賣、那麽半年之内這種日貨的消費跟往日一樣、萬一抵貨運動半年後終止、豈不是恰當日貨賣完的時候、又可以再進日貨、這樣日貨的消費始終没有中斷、國貨及西洋貨始終没有奪取日貨的銷路、對日本生産者可以說一點不生影響、我們的目標是是永久抵制日貨、在上述假設之下、永久抵制的結果是從此後日貨不能進國門、在半年内某種日貨的銷路還是照舊、但這是已經買給中國的貨物、半年後某種日貨完全由國貨、或他國貨代替、這樣子、已進日貨無限制的集中發賣、當然是不成問題、但在不碍永久抵制的的範圍内、、萬一的中途夭折、不可不防、依我的辦法、某種日貨封存起來、半年來不發賣、在這半年期間　　種日貨的消費、都由非日貨代替、即使半年後扔貨終止、封存的日貨、拿出來發賣、還可以經半年、起碼有半年可以無須進日貨、這樣子某種日貨喪失了半年的銷路、無法取償、依同等的理由、私進的日貨、應該封存起來不發賣、或者至事實上抵貨終止時、再提出來發賣不遲、這種私貨千萬不可燒毁燒毁的是中國的錢換來的東西、跟日本人無關、而且假使抵貨而半途終止、燒去的日貨、還得再由日本補進來、反而替日本貨添一筆銷路、巳准登記的日貨、除了封存半年後再發賣、此外還有一個辦法、就是由抗日會把他們逐漸的有限制的賣出去、臠如平時可經一個月的存貨現在分做四個月、每月賣四分之一、那麽在這四個月内這種日貨的銷路、有四分之三給别國貨品所侵奪、這個損失即使抵貨終止也無從取償這個辦法、似乎比半年後發賣的辦法還勝一着、商人的資金還不至於停滯太久、較容易實行、限制的逐漸發賣、因爲貨物供不應求、價錢可以儘量提高、（以賣完平時銷路四分之一爲度）越過平價的餘利、可以提做抗日運動的經費、没收的日貨、即使要發賣、也可以採用這個辦法、但總以不發賣爲是、（十一）不買日貨無非是報復的手段、要使日本的生産者吃一個大虧、反過來說、不賣東西給日本、豈不是使中國生産者吃虧、豈不是替日本人抵制中國貨、也許有人以爲中國輪往日本的大都是原料、斷絶來源也可以給他們生産界一個大打擊、但原料也不止一種、有的日本非依類中國供給不行、有的别國原料價錢貴不了多少、中國原料不賣給日本、徒然替别國貨擴充銷路、所以即使不供給日本原料、也得分别一下、銷費品當然更没有不賣給日本的理由、那幾種原料不妨賣給日本、那幾種原料必不可省、必須由日本輸入、這都要等專家調查研究、</p>
<p>學生工人現在還能夠袖手旁觀嗎？　　歷來抵制日貨要以這一次組織最完善、因爲是商家自動發起、方法也比以前精密、有好組織好方法、加以人心如此激昂、全國各界應當努力奮起、使這一次抵貨運動有空前的成績、使日人從此不敢小覩我們的排貨之動、這一次抵貨的事、學界工界似乎寂無動靜、如像萬事有商人去辦、不干我們的事、排貨是何等巨大的工作、豈是幾個商人辦得了、商人擬定的計畫、通過議案、如果没有民衆的力量做後盾、去强制執行、章程計畫不過是廢紙空言、檢查的工作監督的工作、對付奸商的工作、都得由我們學生和工人來積極參加、以軍事式的部署、作抵貨的工作、學生們與其開會宣傳、做徒手的軍事訓練、不如以這個時間精神、來做大規模抵貨的全市商店檢查、到全市住宅去按户分貼鑑别日貨的傳單、按户勸導斌家主宣誓不買日貨、中華民族如果還有廉恥、不願無聲無臭的懾伏於日本淫威之下、這一次的抵貨運動、萬萬不能讓他失敗、全國的學生、全國的工人、五四的精神何在、五卅的精神何在、大家一齊起來、</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>新愛的國人。國際聨盟行政會議。爲了要解决中日、問題。邀請美國參加。發表意見。這是一件極平常的事。只要自己的心地坦白。行爲正當。那麽任何人都可參加。都可評斷。有甚麽害怕。有甚麽顧忌。不料日方却用了九牛二虎之力。頑强的反對。這眞好似做賊心虛。一見了警察和偵探的影兒。就嚇得倒躱。然而結果國聨全體會員都贊同美國加入。所投同意票共有十三票之多。十三一數。在西方以爲不祥。而此次却給暴日當頭一棒。從此我們將認爲大吉大利了。</p>

<h3>我的小懐抱</h3>
<p>民國十四年一月一日我把一生的舊賬結了一結，並問自己說？「你有什麽懐抱？」我便寫了幾句詩答覆自己，題爲我的小懐抱。今天拿了這面鏡子照了一照，還是依然故我！不長進呢？意志堅决呢？我如何可以辨别呀！我那天寫的一首詩是：</p>
<p>思怨有偶然；</p>
<p>毁譽多意外。</p>
<p>翻手作雲覆手雨，</p>
<p>朋友我不賣。」</p>
<p>我的朋友，潮信，看了第一段之後戲問我：「你這心裏所懐的還是卞和之玉呢？還是賈寳玉啣著出世之通靈寳玉呢？」我說：「這也隨你去猜吧！」</p>
<h3>記甲午平壤之戰</h3>
<p>— 朱瘦狂</p>
<p>甲午中日之戰。其最初接觸點。在朝鮮牙山。我軍旋退平壤。而平壤血戰。頗足寒敵膽。惜終以彈盡援絶。城圍軍解。義州又守。敵遂長驅越鳳凰城。深入國境。卒成城下之盟。痛哉。前輩王公。曾親履平壤。參葉軍門戎幕。爲余述痛史甚確。亟紀之如左。</p>
<p>查中日甲申條約。兩國均不得駐兵朝鮮。甲午秋七月。直隷提督葉志超。奉命卒兵三營赴牙山。平鮮内亂。釁端遂開。事急。清庭僱太古輪高陞。載銘軍（劉銘傳舊部）三營。前往增援。詎甫抵牙山。即被擊沉。軍全没。而同時日軍以二萬來攻。葉知不敵。全軍退平壤。清庭以葉孤軍牙山。得全師旅。功過足以相抵。欽派爲總統前敵諸軍。命圖報效。有衞汝貴淮軍十八營。左寳貴奉軍五營。馬玉崑毅軍三營。豐陞阿旗軍三營。合其他諸軍共四</p>
<p>十餘營。軍勢旣張。誓作殊死戰。平壤城外有山甚險要。洪述祖主守山不守城。而左寳貴堅主守城不守山。迨八月初。我軍歸路被截。交通均阻、十一日起。雙方砲火遥射。我軍堅守不出。敵亦未察我方虛實。不敢深入。中秋夜。月冷風凄。衞汝貴自告奮勇。任前敵。馬玉崑任接應。激勵部下。作背城之戰。衞赤膊持指揮刀。疾馳狂呼。身先士卒。士氣大振。無不一以</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>用毒瓦斯處死刑美國在四十年前。最先用電椅處死判决死刑的罪犯。可算是世界中最人道的刑具。以後曾有許多文明之國。都採用這個電椅。但是在最近的一次。美國又創始一種新的處死刑的方法。處置一個犯有殺人大罪的罪犯。已由法庭中判了死刑。他們這次不用電椅。而利用毒瓦斯。那地點是在奈凡達州。Nevada以後這毒瓦斯處死刑法若能風行世界。那麽奈凡達州就是一個發祥之地了。處刑時。將罪犯關在封閉嚴固的室中。使空氣不能透入。他的身旁放了一桶鹽酸和水的混合物。然後放下十五個蛋形的𩇛化鉀。於是産生了一種輕青酸。這就是所謂毒瓦斯了。罪犯一聞了毒氣。立刻失去知覺。毫無痛苦的安然而死。比了電椅處死。更爲人道。毒瓦斯在歐戰中本是殺人利器之一。不料現在却成了一種處死刑的刑具。</p>
<p>當十。日軍幾疑黑旗劉永福臨陣。是役我軍雖勝。然精銳喪失殊衆。暴日計狡。十六日侵晨。奇兵突襲平壤。左寳貴公服登城督戰。適爲敵砲目標。竟以身殉。守軍盡潰。衞聞警率師返擾。不及。是日平城遂陷。事後衞被參尅扣軍餉。臨陣退縮處斬。傳者謂衞尅扣軍餉與否。茲姑弗論。至言臨陣退縮。則衞固一鐵血男兒。對日未嘗抵抗也。（移酬助振）</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>國難聲中，我愈覺得我們的駐外使領任務的重要，雖說弱國無外交，然而事在人爲，這話决不是定例。要是身任使領重寄的人，他素日對於外交學識有涵養，有眼光，有魄力的話，一日遇到意外事變的發生，總可以衡情酌理，折衝樽俎，不難取得國際間的同情，諒解與協助：反之，缺乏外交學識，不明國際大勢，連駐在國的語言，文字，風土，人情，都不瞭解的人，濫竽充數，這怎麽可以代表國家，負起艱</p>
<p>鉅的職責？政府任命官吏，没有標準，對内或許可以遷就，對外如此，簡直自甘墮落國家的體面與民族的人格！例如我與德法兩國關係，何等密切，不是確有把握人的，怎能輕於嘗試？甚望政府顧全大局，另簡賢能，以副民衆的願望！</p>
<h3>倭人攫我寒山寺古鐘</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>我吳水土清嘉。尤多名勝。寒山寺其一也。寺在楓橋鎭。離城約七八里。金昌有馳道可通。建於梁時。名妙利普明禪院。唐後始稱寒山寺。以寒山拾得嘗止於此也。宋紹興中重修。明清屢修屢圯。咸豐間燬於兵燹。光緒丙午。陳夔龍撫吳。謀興復。宣統庚戌。程雪樓續葺。規模宏敞。輪奐一新。惟以稍參歐制。有失古意爲嫌。倭人喜誦我國唐詩。誦至張繼月落烏啼霜滿天之什。爲之神往。故來吳必以一訪寒山寺爲快。汽船泊止。習以爲常。有改張繼詩末句爲夜半鐘聲到汽船者。未免謔而虐矣。寺鐘爲銅質。千年古物。名貴殊常。倭人涎羨之。潛鑄新鐘以易去。有司士民。不之聞問。一任取携。若敝屣之棄置無足惜者。斯眞咄咄怪事也。茲倭人得步進步。疆土任其據領。黎庶任其屠殺。悉委諸無抵抗主義之中。區區古鐘。更不在意。姑述之以告來游者。知所興慨已爾。</p>
<h3>一個驚人的統計</h3>
<p>— 何鵬飛</p>
<p>暴日全國一年支出敎育經濟的統計　　暴日昭和三年四月至四年三月的一年間。中央及地方所支出敎育經費的總額。約爲日金五億三千六百四十七萬一千元。以一個蕞爾的小國。一年中竟支出了這樣大額的敎育經費。也就很可以驚人了。</p>
<p>暴日各種學校一個學生。每年由國家</p>
<p>小學生　三四元</p>
<p>女學生　八一元</p>
<p>中學生　一○五元</p>
<p>專門學校生　三○七元</p>
<p>大學生　一、六五三元</p>
<p>一個學生由小學校畢業出來。六年中國家或地方所担負的敎育經費。約爲二○○元女學校畢業生約爲六○九元。中學校畢業生約爲七三○元。專門學校畢業生約爲一六五○元。大學畢業生約爲六五○○元。這樣看來。日本敎育的發達。我國對之眞要自愧不如了。（移酬助賑）</p>

<h3>敲夢的杵（一六）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>此夢胡爲乎來哉？什麽長距離賽跑，自己這位没脚蟹般的夫人落伍：什麽機械學博士和我閑談，我變做了一竅不通的門外漢：原來没有這麽一回事，却是一塲幻夢！好了！好了！現在夢醒了！我，依舊是足以安邦定國而有餘的探花郎：我那夫人，依舊是天下第一纖足的百媚娘。」</p>
<p>「老爺，你夢見了什麽？」同衾共枕的唐秀英，在媚笑的時候而加以盤問，且問，且把一隻穿着紅羅睡鞋擅有天下第一榮譽的纖足、輕輕的壓上了陶遲的腹部。</p>
<p>「夫人，咦！」陶遲喚了一聲夫人，正待把夢境告訴他知曉；忽的，黑暗腦海中，來了一道探海電燈的光！在這光芒中，照見了自己進那無得菴和長老談話的影事；因此，這個「咦」字便进迸露在失聲驚呼之下。</p>
<p>「老爺，爲什麽喚一聲咦，咦些什麽？」唐秀英問話的時候，把粉頰偎着陶遲的面，把纖足勾着陶遲的股。</p>
<p>黑暗腦海中的探海電光，一閃一閃的快要過去了！再不掙扎，陶遲便要永永的沉淪在過去的黑海裏面！</p>
<p>「無碍菴長老，快快救我！」陶遲不自禁的喚這一聲。</p>
<p>這一喚的效力眞大，喚醒了二十世紀頭腦的本人！過去時代一切的一切都成了泡影，存的只有坐在轉輪椅子上的本身，和一位善智識的長老相對着。</p>
<p>「居士，你親歷着過去世界，作何感想？」</p>
<p>「老和尚，我覺悟了；積弱的中國，大概是過去時代告成的。」</p>
<p>「你說做了太平之民」「此間樂，不思蜀；」爲什麽思着老僧而大聲呼救？」</p>
<p>「老和尚，不要說了；虧得我一靈不昧，才能夠脫離這弱種製造廠的過去中」</p>
<p>國！老和尚，現在是什麽時候了？我覺得這一番經歷是很悠久的，大概總有三五年罷。」</p>
<p>「居士，要知什麽時候，不用問老僧，但看盤中的芋艿。」</p>
<p>陶遲離了轉輪椅，重回原座，看那盤中的芋艿，兀自熱氣騰騰；便知道轉輪椅上的三五載光陰，不過禪室中的一刹那工夫！</p>

<h3>US Delegate to League of Nations Executive Council</h3>

<h3>US Accepts Invitation</h3>
<p>Gilbert Attends League of Nations Executive Council Meeting as Observer</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States has accepted the invitation from the League of Nations Executive Council to send a representative to participate in the discussions of the Executive Council. Before formally accepting the League of Nations' invitation, a telegram had been sent to the US representative in Geneva, Gilbert, stating: "You are hereby authorized to participate in the Executive Council's discussions regarding the possible implementation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. You must report the results of the discussions to the State Department for a decision on possible actions. If you attend any other discussions of this dispute, it will only be as an observer." (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, at the public meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council, US representative Gilbert stated that the US government had accepted the Executive Council's invitation and that he would act in the capacity specified in the invitation. He expressed gratitude for the Executive Council's invitation to the United States to participate in discussions related to the Kellogg-Briand Pact at a time of deep international anxiety. He stated that the United States did not wish to intervene in any measures proposed under the League of Nations Charter, nor did it wish to participate in any decisions regarding actions taken under the Charter. However, the Paris Pact bore the names of the current President of the League of Nations Executive Council, Briand, and the former US Secretary of State, Kellogg, as its initiators. In the view of the United States, this treaty was an effective tool for guiding world public opinion and a support for resolving disputes between countries solely through peaceful means. Timely exercise of this power of world public opinion could prevent the disruption of international peace, the effects of which would be felt worldwide. Gilbert then praised Briand's efforts to uphold peace. The British Chief Delegate, Lord Cecil, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the Executive Council's resolution on this matter and said that he was delighted to be attending the League of Nations Executive Council for the first time as the British representative, with the US representative also present and Briand as the chairman. With the exception of the Japanese representative, Yoshizawa, all other members expressed pleasure with the progress of the meeting. The Italian representative, Grandi, said that this meeting demonstrated the United States' contribution of cooperation in the work of the League of Nations. The Spanish representative, Madariaga, said that East and West were now united for the benefit of peace. The Chinese Chief Delegate, Shi Zhaoji, said that the ocean between China and the United States was named "Pacific," which symbolized the relationship between these two countries and others. Before the meeting adjourned, US representative Gilbert thanked the members of the Executive Council for their welcoming remarks and expressed his pleasure that the members' views coincided with those of the United States. The first appearance of a US observer at an Executive Council meeting was a great success from the standpoint of outward appearances. The observer gallery was extremely crowded and paid close attention to the meeting. Before the meeting began, Yoshizawa approached Gilbert and shook his hand, which was also noteworthy. This afternoon, Yoshizawa, without his entourage, visited British Foreign Secretary Lord Cecil for an hour and a half. It is reported that they had a close and confidential discussion, but there were no concrete results. To date, there has been no indication that Japan is prepared to withdraw its troops to the South Manchurian Railway Zone. It is generally felt that private talks between members of the Executive Council may be more beneficial than public discussions at this time, so the members will continue to hold informal talks tomorrow. According to responsible sources, there has been no suggestion here that Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Executive Council Held Secret Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Seeking a Compromise on the Issue of Japanese Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>(Geneva) Members of the League of Nations Executive Council held an informal meeting this morning, but may hold a public meeting this afternoon. The important development today is the general demand that Japanese troops in Manchuria must withdraw to the railway zone to facilitate negotiations between the two sides. All members of the Executive Council, except the representatives of China and Japan, gathered in the office of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations this morning for a secret meeting. US representative Gilbert also attended. News from Tokyo about the possibility of Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations has created a painful impression on the League of Nations, but it is hoped that this will not happen to avoid exacerbating the already difficult situation. The Manchurian issue has now entered a critical stage, as the time for genuine action has arrived. There is a strong feeling here that Japanese troops must withdraw to their original positions to facilitate direct negotiations between the two countries. If Japan is concerned that the Japanese and Korean people will be at risk after the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the Executive Council could recommend sending personnel to monitor the situation on the ground to prevent atrocities by the Chinese. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The secret discussions of the Executive Council lasted for two and a half hours and will continue today. All members have agreed to maintain secrecy for the time being, so no information about the meeting has been leaked. However, it is reported that although no resolution has yet been reached, the talks are progressing smoothly. One member said that things are progressing as well as expected. The Chinese delegation continues to send telegrams received from Nanjing reporting the activities of Japanese troops in Manchuria to the League of Nations Secretariat, many of which concern Japanese aircraft flying over and dropping bombs on Chinese cities and towns. Italian representative Grandi, unexpectedly, must leave Geneva tonight to go to Asillin on October 21, so his duties on the Executive Council will be taken over by Chelle-Cage. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council met in secret at 11:30 this morning to continue discussing the Manchurian issue. The Chinese and Japanese representatives did not attend, but US representative Gilbert attended the discussion. The meeting adjourned at 3:15 p.m. and is scheduled to reconvene at 6:00 p.m. It is reported that the Council is still focusing its efforts on finding a way for China and Japan to engage in direct diplomatic negotiations. It is also reported that more and more people in the Secretariat and other organs of the League of Nations are advocating that Article 16 of the Charter should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council is deeply concerned about the withdrawal of Japanese troops. In the opinion of the Chinese, no negotiations can be held until the Japanese troops withdraw. Japan, on the other hand, believes that a collaborative agreement in principle is a prerequisite. Geneva is trying to find a compromise whereby Japan withdraws its troops in stages while China and Japan begin negotiations during the withdrawal period. There is also disagreement between China and Japan on this point. China believes that Japanese troops must continue to withdraw regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, while Japan believes the opposite. In addition, there is a more serious difficulty, namely, the conditions that Japan considers to be fundamental in principle, which Shidehara is unwilling to mention to the Chinese ambassador to Japan. Geneva is maintaining strict secrecy, but according to our sources, at least one of these conditions is not amenable to consideration, while the others may be open for discussion. Overall, the Executive Council is in a difficult situation, and the daily bombings by Japanese troops are making it even more difficult. However, Briand's use of his personal influence to achieve a great victory can be seen as a good omen for the future. (Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Cables French Mediation Plan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shi Zhaoji cabled Vice-Chairman Zhang stating that Briand's mediation plan for China and Japan included: (1) Japan withdrawing its troops from the occupied territories; (2) Third-country personnel to be sent to monitor China's takeover; (3) Direct negotiations between China and Japan to take place after the implementation of items 1 and 2. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Reports on Actions of Japanese Troops in Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Chinese Chief Representative Shi reported to the Council: (1) Japanese troops are building an airfield of 400 acres in Jilin; (2) On the 14th, Japanese aircraft dropped 20 bombs on Xinglongdian; (3) Mongol bandits attacked the 40th Regiment of the Northeast Army in Liaoning Province, and were repulsed after four hours of fierce fighting, with 200 deaths. During the engagement, six Japanese aircraft bombarded the Chinese army; (4) A telegram from Beiping reported that on the 15th, Japanese troops were digging trenches and laying landmines near Julu River; (5) On the same day, Japanese aircraft again bombarded Jinzhou; (6) As of today, Japanese troops are still digging trenches around the city of Shenyang. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, according to a staff member of the League of Nations Secretariat, the Chinese Chief Representative, Dr. Shi Zhaoji, has submitted 71 notes and reports to the Council to date. The most recent report states that five Japanese trains were moving along the Beining Railway from Xinmin towards Jinzhou on the 14th. Also, in the Tongliao area on the 14th, 4,000 Mongol and Russian bandits attacked the 14th Regiment of the Chinese Army, which suffered heavy losses and retreated. During the engagement, Japanese military aircraft circled in the sky. Given that Japan had previously supplied the Mongols with munitions from the Shenyang Chinese Arsenal, this action must also have great significance. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Statement Prepared but Not Issued</h3>
<p>Regarding US Participation Issue</p>
<p>Raising Legal Objections</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of discussions regarding the League of Nations' resolution inviting a representative from the United States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the League of Nations' resolution violates the rules regarding the composition of the League of Nations Council. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement from the Japanese government yesterday afternoon, the contents of which are as follows: Japan firmly believes that the United States' efforts make a great contribution to world peace. The League of Nations' resolution to invite a representative from a non-member state to participate in a meeting is unprecedented, and there is no such provision in any of the League of Nations' regulations. Therefore, the League of Nations' invitation to a US representative undermines the organizational rules of the League of Nations Council. The Japanese government has serious doubts about the fact that the Council used a majority vote to decide on this issue as a purely procedural matter, and the Japanese government will request the Council to consider this point. (Japan Union News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is discussing its attitude towards the Manchurian Incident from this morning, including Foreign Minister Shidehara. As a result, it has been decided not to issue a statement. (Japan Union News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government still wants to obtain clarification on several points before announcing its attitude towards the League of Nations resolution.</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Therefore, a new directive was issued to Yoshizawa this afternoon, asking the League of Nations some questions. The main points are whether the League of Nations' resolution to invite the United States to participate is legal, and the issue of the League of Nations proceeding without first determining whether its actions are legal. Yoshizawa was also instructed to state that the US representative should only be allowed to speak on matters related to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. However, Japan is confident that the current situation is neither war nor will it lead to war, so there is no need to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Furthermore, if it is deemed that the situation requires the application of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, then why only invite the United States and not other signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to participate? It is reported that the Japanese government believes that, based on this, the Russian government should have even more reason to be invited to participate, as Russia has a closer relationship with Manchuria. However, this point was not raised in the directive to Yoshizawa. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations Executive Council's resolution inviting the United States to participate in the discussion has aroused repercussions in Japan. Many circles regard this as an unreasonable threat and advocate that the government should adhere to its original policy. Some influential factions even advocate that, if necessary, they would rather withdraw from the League of Nations than accept command on issues that are of vital importance to the survival of the country. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because of the seriousness of the situation, senior Japanese officials plan to hold a conference of senior officials. Currently, opinions on this matter are being unofficially solicited from the government. The conference will be centered on the elder statesman Prince Saionji, and will be attended by Minister of the Imperial Household Makino, Field Marshal Yamamoto Gonnohyoe, Vice Presidents of the Privy Council Kuratomi and Hiranuma, Prime Minister Wakatsuki, etc. If necessary, the Minister of the Army Minami and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Shidehara will also be invited to attend. (Japan Union News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Debuchi Meets with US Secretary of State</h3>
<p>(Washington) There is not much comment in official circles here regarding the US acceptance of the invitation and Japan's opposition. Today, Japanese Ambassador Debuchi visited Secretary of State Stimson and Undersecretary of State Castle for a long meeting. Afterwards, Debuchi told Washington reporters that the Japanese people admire Stimson's cooperative attitude. It is reported that Debuchi telegraphed the Japanese government yesterday, advising them to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards the US acceptance of the League of Nations invitation, stating that the US attitude towards the Manchurian issue can only be described as completely neutral. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Stubborn Attitude</h3>
<p>Wanting to Coerce with Threat of Withdrawing from League of Nations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Judging from the situation today, the possibility of Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations seems greater than the prospect of unconditionally withdrawing troops from areas outside the South Manchurian Railway Zone. However, political circles still seem to hope to find a way to preserve the face of all parties, including China, Japan, and the League of Nations, and to avoid using drastic measures. It is deeply felt here that the League of Nations' invitation to the United States encourages China to avoid direct negotiations. If the League of Nations and the United States do not support China, China will soon negotiate with Japan. If the League of Nations cannot implement its resolutions, it will endanger its own existence. But if the League of Nations resolutely insists on intervention to resolve this dispute, Japan also feels that it will endanger its national existence. What Japan wants is a fundamental and permanent solution, not a temporary and perfunctory truce. According to responsible sources here, only direct negotiations between China and Japan can achieve this kind of solution. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The leaders of the Upper House passed a resolution today urging the government to adhere to its original policy and disregard the current resolutions of the League of Nations. The Minister of the Army Minami announced to the press after consulting with the Chief of Staff today that no matter what path the League of Nations or other third parties take, Japan's policy towards Manchuria will not change. Today, all Japanese newspapers unanimously criticized the League of Nations' resolution, saying that Japan should move forward boldly without any scruples.

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Leads Troops to Block Zhang HaiPeng's Army</h3>
<p>Troops Mobilized in Hailar and Manzhouli</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter East of Nenjiang</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fearing Russian misunderstanding, Japanese troops dispatched aircraft to reconnoiter the east bank of the Nenjiang River on the 16th. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are many rumors in Bu Kui that Ma Zhanshan led his troops to attack Zhang Haipeng's army. Troops stationed in Hailar and Manzhouli have been mobilized to encircle Zhang's army and thoroughly eliminate it. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Harbin stated that Zhang Haipeng's troops, supplied with funds and weapons by the Japanese, have now reached Tailai Town, blown up the Jiangqiao Bridge on the Tao'an Railway, and were defeated by Yu Zhaolin's troops in conjunction with the reclamation corps. Prices in Harbin are soaring, and people are panicked. The authorities replied that the Japanese army would never dare to send troops deep into Heilongjiang Province, and that the Japanese aircraft's long-range attack on Bu Kui across the Chinese Eastern Railway had no significant military effect. Zhang's troops number only a few thousand, and although they are now relying on Japanese power to act perversely, the Japanese also have concerns about Russia, and Zhang's troops will be difficult to sustain. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Haipeng's troops are advancing towards Heilongjiang Province from Taonan, have passed Tailai Town, and have reached the Nenjiang River. Because the Jiangqiao Bridge on the Tao'an Railway was blown up by the garrison, they have not yet crossed the river. The Heilongjiang army is also deploying along the north bank of the river to prevent the troops from advancing. There has not yet been any formal contact. Zhang's troops fought fiercely with the Tuquan Reclamation Army for a whole day some time ago, and there is talk of Zhang's troops retreating to Taonan. Zhang Jinghui has sent personnel to persuade them not to enter Heilongjiang. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin said that Zhang Haipeng is an honest person, but may be taken advantage of by others. Zhang's troops total four regiments, and it is recently heard that they have incorporated bandits, numbering no more than 2,000. Zhang telegraphed previously, saying that he was being pressured by the Japanese army and requested permission to station troops in Heilongjiang Province. The authorities, fearing other changes, telegraphed Zhang to stop. Zhang did not listen, and suddenly opened north, so the Heilongjiang army had no choice but to prevent him. Ma Zhanshan's troops have arrived in the provincial capital. The Longjiang garrison originally had a guard regiment, and now an infantry regiment and two cavalry regiments have also arrived, which is sufficient to prevent Zhang's troops from advancing. If necessary, troops stationed at various stations along the Jilin-Chinese Eastern Railway can also be transferred to assist. The security of the provincial capital is not a concern. The authorities have now sent personnel to mediate and advise Zhang not to advance further north to avoid being used by others. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>September 18th to October 18th</h3>
<p>Today is October 18th. Exactly one month has passed since the violent outbreak launched by the Japanese army in Shenyang on the evening of September 18th. How have our countrymen spent this month of profound pain? What have they done during this month of shame? If we speak of "lying on firewood and tasting gall," then this month is the time for all our people to lie on firewood and taste gall. If we speak of "wiping out the shame and striving for strength," then this month is the beginning for all our people to rise up and become strong. What day is September 18th? Since September 18th, what have the people of the world been watching and listening to with concern? A national with blood and spirit should not forget, and especially should not bear to forget.</p>
<p>The reason we are speaking so earnestly today is not to focus on the loss of land and the gains or losses of military affairs. Victory or defeat is common in war, and besides, our country has not actually fought a single battle yet. Loss of land is also common among countries around the world. Moreover, the violent Japanese have not yet dared to openly annex our Northeast. After the Great War, Germany's situation could not be considered easy. However, up to today, the German nation has once again shown its prowess in the world. The great powers all look at them with new respect. Therefore, what we are focusing on today is not temporary gains or losses, not the trauma suffered by our nation on September 18th, nor the increasing atrocities suffered by our nation after September 18th, but on how our nation has reacted to what September 18th has given us. How has our national consciousness awakened since September 18th? What have we done?</p>
<p>Indeed, stimulated by the calamity of September 18th, and after a month of running around and appealing, domestic peace and unity have gradually become a possibility. If the upcoming peace and unity conference can proceed smoothly, allowing all parties to achieve their desired satisfaction, then the "peace and unity" can be realized in fact, which can be considered a gift from the calamity on the evening of September 18th. However, instead of comforting ourselves with this, we should rather weep bitterly. The national situation has reached this point. If we are still quibbling over differences of opinion, it would simply show that the leaders are still indulging in personal disputes and have no sincerity in repenting and redeeming their sins. Indeed, stimulated by the calamity of September 18th, the national spirit of our entire country has been aroused, resisting violence and saving ourselves. A million mouths speak with one voice. Petitions, enlisting in the army, speeches, gatherings, parades, boycotts of goods, cutting off fingers, writing in blood, weeping bitterly, making appeals - all kinds of things that can express our aroused national spirit have been done to the fullest. However, aroused national spirit is difficult to sustain. Speeches and parades can promote national awakening, but besides speeches and parades, there is still the most important and meaningful work waiting for us to earnestly start doing. After the Great War, Germany's national lifeline was only barely preserved. They were at the mercy of others, and could only do as the victorious nations wished. In particular, the staggering reparations for military expenses almost made it impossible for the German nation to ever rise again. However, the German people endured death and tears, suppressed their sorrow and anger, did not make empty shouts, and did not shed weak tears. With a determined spirit and unified steps, they devoted their heart and strength to practicing their own responsibilities and used their strong and powerful iron fists to save their last breath of national destiny. Compared to our countrymen's futile shouts and clamors today, not seeking practical and effective work, we still cannot believe that the calamity of September 18th has given us the necessary awakening.</p>

<h3>Ironclad Evidence of Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>Eddie Issues Sworn Testimony</p>
<p>U.S. Consul General in Tianjin Swears Oath</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi received a sworn testimony book from Eddie, an employee of the American Red Cross, lecturer, and writer, made before the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin. This book was created in a legal manner so that it can be presented as evidence in any court. The certificate is as follows: I, Eddie, witnessed the Japanese army occupy Shenyang on September 18th and 19th, when Shenyang was occupied. I then went to Korea and clearly saw that Japan's policy towards Manchuria was divided into three major steps: (1) Declare independence from China, (2) Declare it as a protectorate of Japan, (3) Implement annexation. I read newspapers run by Japanese people in Korea and saw that the independent governments of Jilin Province and Northeast Province were being constructed. I then returned to Shenyang. I read the Manchurian Daily News on October 3rd, 4th, and 5th and saw that the "Chinese Autonomous System" of Shenyang had been established and announced the names of people serving on local administrative committees or security committees. It was said that they had long been "creating a Chinese autonomous government." Two of them came to visit me in person on October 5th and talked for two hours. They said that the Japanese had repeatedly persuaded them, and in the last ten days had repeatedly urged them to build a puppet "independent" government in the province. They had repeatedly refused. They were all respected citizens of Shenyang. I do not want to announce their names to avoid endangering them. Foreigners I met in South Manchuria and Chinese people in South Manchuria had no doubt that the Japanese army's occupation of Shenyang and key locations in Manchuria was a pre-planned, meticulous, and offensive plan. This plan is currently developing so-called "independent" puppet governments in various provinces of Manchuria. Sworn and made on October 9th, 1931, by Eddie, signed by Eddie himself, sworn by George Atcheson, U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, China, with the seal of the U.S. Consulate General in Tianjin.

Regarding the students' own issues, he instructed them to contact the Ministry of Education. They petitioned the Ministry of Education at 4:00 pm, and Minister Li met with them, saying that the matter of issuing travel expenses to all students in Japan would have to be referred to the National Government before a response could be given. As for the students' status after returning to China, their academic status will be retained and not canceled. The Ministry of Education has sent personnel to Shanghai to receive the students and investigate their academic records and qualifications in Japan to facilitate their transfer to domestic schools, without requiring entrance exams. Those who volunteer to serve will be given priority in introductions to various government agencies for employment. As for government-funded students transferring to European and American countries, the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen is increasing. If they wish to transfer to Western countries, the Ministry will naturally support them. (Special telegram on the 17th)</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Submits Resignation to Guangdong Government</h3>
<p>Takes Responsibility for Du Xuantai's Escape</p>
<p>Extraordinary Committee Resolves to Persuade Him to Stay</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Jingwei submitted his resignation to the Guangdong government for taking responsibility for Du Xuantai's escape. The original submission stated: "Respectfully submitted, on the evening of October 10th, a conflict occurred between the masses and the police on Yonghan Road, resulting in a tragedy. The National Government decided on measures, the most important of which was to detain Du Xuantai, the director of the Yonghan Branch Bureau, and others, and organize a special court for a public trial. At that time, when Zhao Ming met with the petitioning masses, he explained these measures, and most of the masses expressed satisfaction. However, a small portion still advocated for Du Xuantai and others to be executed immediately by shooting. The National Government refused their request, stating that they could not be executed without a court trial. This was the correct method. However, according to recent reports, Du Xuantai and others dared to collude with guard Li He and others to escape in secret. Du Xuantai and others were confident that they were innocent, so why did they not appeal to the court? They treated human life and national law as a child's game, which is outrageous. In addition to the National Government ordering the Guangdong Provincial Government to offer a reward for their arrest and thorough investigation, Zhao Ming, who explained the measures to the masses on that day, should take responsibility and resign to maintain the public's trust in the National Government. I respectfully request your approval to resign from my position as a member of the National Government. I am sincerely grateful. Wang Jingwei, member of the National Government, October 15th. The Extraordinary Committee resolved to persuade him to stay, sending a letter stating, ‘In reply, your submission was submitted to the 36th meeting of this committee for discussion and resolution. The local government bears direct responsibility for the unfortunate incident on Yonghan Road. Regarding the petition of the masses on the day after the unfortunate incident, the comrades in charge of the National Government had to convene a temporary meeting and accept the petition as a matter of expediency because the matter was serious. The measures decided on that day were jointly agreed upon by all the comrades present before being explained to the petitioning masses by your representative, so there is no reason for your office to bear sole responsibility. As for Du Xuantai colluding with the guards to escape in secret and disregard national law, it is extremely deplorable. Chen Qingyun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, was responsible for guarding them, and his negligence is to be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in addition to the National Government ordering the Guangdong Provincial Government to offer a reward for the arrest of Du Xuantai and others and their investigation, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Qingyun, will also be investigated. After the incident occurred, the comrades in charge of the National Government had already explained the measures for handling the case to the petitioning masses, and they must continue to take responsibility and order the Guangdong Provincial Government to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice to clarify their responsibility. There is no need to discuss your request to resign from your position as a member of the National Government.’ This is recorded in the file and communicated to you. Please note. To Wang Jingwei, member of the Committee. The Extraordinary Committee of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, Sun Ke, Deng Zheru, Li Wenfan, Ma Chaojun, October 15th."

<h3>German Parliament Trusts the Brüning Government</h3>
<p>Two Opposition Motions Vetoed</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 17th - The German Parliament met tonight, and an opposition motion of no confidence was put to a vote. As a result, the government party won with 295 votes against 270. The parliamentary session, which lasted only three days, was adjourned until February 23rd next year. The fate of the Brüning government has now been decided. Before the adjournment of Parliament tonight, the opposition also put forward two motions to dissolve Parliament and repeal the emergency decree. As a result of the vote, the first motion was rejected by a majority of 68 votes, and the second motion was rejected by a majority of 103 votes. During today's debate in Parliament, all parties except the Communist Party argued fiercely. Some attacked the Brüning government as incompetent, while others criticized it for harboring dictatorial ambitions. Brüning replied that he was willing to organize a special committee to study and revise reasonable suggestions for the emergency decree, but that the current attacks were all unreasonable. Brüning further stated that if there were other ways to solve the current problems besides the policies adopted by his government, the government would be willing to hear them and give them a thorough review. Subsequently, after the National Socialist Party members withdrew, the Communist Party took the opportunity to move to instruct the Minister of Defense to stop building the second pocket battleship. The Social Democratic Party supported the Communist Party's motion, which was passed by 211 votes to 181.</p>
<h3>Spanish Parliament Passes Astonishing Social Law</h3>
<p>Divorce Permitted Freely</p>
<p>The Vatican Protests the Separation of Church and State</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 17th - The Spanish Parliament has passed an amendment to the new constitution on divorce, stipulating that a marriage contract can be dissolved with the consent of both parties or if one party has a legitimate reason. Also,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>stipulates that parents have an obligation to raise and educate children, regardless of whether they are born in or out of formal marriage. The state has an obligation to abandoned children, and there is no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children. Spain has traditionally been a Catholic country where marriage contracts are not allowed to be dissolved, so this case is one of the most astonishing social laws in Spanish history.</p>

<h3>British Election News</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden issued a letter yesterday denouncing the Labour Party leader, saying that the one who is now issuing the Labour Party manifesto against tariffs is the same one who previously proposed and supported the immediate implementation of tariffs in the Labour Party cabinet. The National Government now asks the people of the country to jointly condemn the cowardly behavior of those who do not take national responsibility in times of national emergency. This letter can be a very good propaganda material for those who support the National Government. There are currently 1,286 candidates from various parties nationwide, including 65, such as Baldwin, who have not encountered competition and are naturally elected. The candidates from various parties are as follows: Conservative Party, 470; Labour Party, 507; Liberal Party, 116; National Liberal Party (i.e., the Simon Party), 32; National Labour Party (i.e., the MacDonald Party), 21; New Party (i.e., the Mosley Party), 23; Communist Party, 25; and 27 others.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Induces and Threatens Inner Mongolia to Declare Independence</h3>
<p>Prince Da Remains Unmoved and Escapes to Beiping in Disguise</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the Shenyang Incident, rumors have abounded regarding Darhan Wang, the Zasak of the Darhan Banner in the Jerim League of Inner Mongolia, and the general public has paid close attention. Last night (13th) at 5:00 PM, under the strict surveillance of Japanese soldiers, he arrived in Beiping in disguise. Today, I made a special trip to his residence in Beiping to meet him and inquire about the truth of the situation in Inner Mongolia. Prince Da was ill, so his Chinese secretary, Zhu Yinong, met with me on his behalf. According to his account, "Since the Japanese army occupied Shenyang on September 18, it has been a month, and they have been extremely violent, wantonly trampling on everything. The cruel situation is indescribable. In particular, they have focused on the leaders of the various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia, whom they have been paying attention to for a long time. On the surface, they seem quite humble, but in reality, they are insidious and ruthless, using every means possible. Five days after occupying Shenyang (i.e., September 23), General Honjo, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, sent Kikuchi Akitaro, a clerk of the South Manchuria Railway, and Major General Huangmu to visit Prince Da and incite Inner Mongolia to declare independence. However, Prince Da did not receive them because Japan is our country's enemy. However, under duress, his brother (Zhu himself) reluctantly represented him in negotiations. Major General Huangmu and others conveyed the various main points of Japan's hope for Inner Mongolia's independence, requesting that they be relayed, and said that if they could break away from China, Japan would be willing to fully supply Inner Mongolia with the money and military supplies it needed, and would also guarantee that Inner Mongolia would receive various benefits. However, it was necessary to strictly maintain secrecy internationally and not say that it was instigated by Japan, so as not to give people a pretext. Otherwise, even if Prince Da did not agree, someone else would be found. But the three eastern provinces will definitely not be Chinese territory in the future, and 12 aircraft carrying 60 bombs have been dispatched to bomb Jinzhou. Prince Da's banner is adjacent to the three eastern provinces, and in fact, they will eventually achieve their goal." The enticements and threats were extremely forceful. However, my brother has always known that Prince Da is loyal and inwardly oriented, and will never willingly be a traitor to the country. Therefore, he only stated that the Jerim League has jurisdiction over a total of ten banners, and requested that he wait until after meeting with the various princes before giving a reply, and dealt with them evasively. Kikuchi Akitaro and others came a total of four times. Because we never gave a formal reply, during the third meeting, Honjo sent Kikuchi Akitaro and Hirano to lead 12 soldiers to station themselves in Prince Da's mansion in Xiaoheyan, nominally for protection, but in reality to carry out surveillance. During the fourth negotiation, the Japanese side exerted even more pressure, with a great sense of not giving up until their demands were met. In order to avoid their coercion, Prince Da, together with his Fujin (princess), Zhu Yueqing, the Director of the Wilderness Affairs Bureau, Ma Liangji, the captain of the cavalry of the Northeast Military Academy, and my brother, totaling five people, disguised themselves and escaped on foot to the Huanggu屯 station, where they boarded a refugee train to Beiping. On the way, when passing through Juliao River, they were inspected by the Japanese. At the Xigaoshanzi station in Dahushan, bandits used stones to block the railway tracks, and there was a robbery. Five refugees in the same car died, and more than ten were injured. They did not arrive in Beiping until 7:00 PM last night, looking extremely disheveled. Prince Da's family members, except for the third and fourth sons and the fourth daughter, who have arrived here, the eldest, second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth sons, and the fifth, sixth, and ninth daughters have not yet arrived in Beiping. Prince Da is now unwell due to fatigue and excessive worry. After resting for a while, he will visit the Deputy Commander in two or three days to report everything and request guidance. In short, Prince Da is determined to take the central government's intention as his intention, and Inner Mongolia will never have divided loyalties and will never recognize a thief as a father or compromise with Japan. As for Han Ruiting, Bao Shanyi, and others' secret collusion with the Japanese side, it is entirely their personal action. Han Ruiting is purely a rogue who was formerly the Prince Da's banner's seal manager but was dismissed long ago for illegal acts and will never be able to expand the matter. Bao Shanyi is a commander of the Bo Prince's banner. Since Prince Bo does not compromise with Japan, only one person without the Zasak's seal will not be obeyed by the Mongolian people. Although they received 3,000 rifles, 60 machine guns, 20 mortars, and 10 field guns from the Japanese army in Yikeshu area, no one used them for them, and they are not enough to cause harm. Currently, Shenyang is maintained by the Yuan Jinkai Maintenance Association and the Japanese side, and the order is still good, but there is no government organization. Zang Shiyi, the chairman of the Shenyang Provincial Government, and Jin Yufu, the director of education, have been trapped since the fall of Shenyang. Because the Japanese side forced them to sign, they swore to die and not comply. They are now barely alive. If they are not rescued as soon as possible, they will definitely not be spared, which is very tragic." (14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Hankou Arrogantly Provoke</h3>
<p>Japanese Warships and Marines Arrive in Hankou for Deployment</p>
<p>Japanese Residents and Koreans All Armed</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Shenyang Incident, the Japanese military and civilians stationed in Hankou have first installed barbed wire, as if facing a formidable enemy, and then troops and ruffians have been causing trouble everywhere. Recently, they have further expanded their military preparations, with swords drawn and bows bent. Their intention to expand the incident and carry out their conspiracy to invade the Yangtze River is already obvious. The people of Wuhan are in this serious environment. In addition to trying their best to avoid conflict, their work to resist Japan and save the country is also becoming increasingly tense. The following is a record of the situation in recent days.</p>
<p>Japanese Concession Actively Prepares Militarily: Since the Japanese Navy's 10,000-ton destroyer arrived in Hankou, it has been conducting landing exercises and tactics every day. Gunshots are rumbling. Starting on the 8th, they also conducted night battle exercises. The military and police were mixed, and the situation was even more tense. On the 14th, more than 300 marines were transferred from Shanghai and all landed for deployment. Morioka, a Japanese army officer, and Sakane, the consul-general, issued a notice to the members of the Japanese Reservist Association in Hankou, ordering them to be organized into a volunteer army, issued firearms, and carry out military training. The Koreans residing there were also ordered to join them, and if they did not obey, they would not be responsible for their protection. On the one hand, they also established a youth training center, with Ishikawa as the director. All Japanese residents in Hankou who are over the age of 18 must join and receive military academic education at the center from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM every day, without any delay. The police station strictly checks the population registration, and the inspection of Chinese people is very strict. Those who move out of the concession will be absolutely prohibited from residing there in the future.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Changes Organization: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is organized by people from all walks of life in Wuhan. On the 15th, the association held its second general meeting and decided to change its organization. The number of standing committee members was increased to seven, the action department was abolished, and the guidance, registration, investigation, and inspection sections were all expanded into departments. The responsible personnel were re-elected, with Wu Qiyun, Yang Zaichun, Zeng Juexian, He Hengfu, Hu Shumin, Peng Shisun, and Hu Zhemin being elected as standing committee members, Gao Bochang, Lou Botang, Xiao Dengyun, Xiang Xinkui, and Cao Yinchi being elected as supervisory committee members, Wu Qiyun as secretary-general, Zhang Yikun and Tian Zhongyu as the director and deputy director of the guidance department, Wang Jinxia and Yang Huiting as the director and deputy director of the inspection department, He Wenbing and Fang Chengyan as the director and deputy director of the registration department, Shan Chengyi and Fan Xieting as the director and deputy director of the investigation department, and Xiao Ruoxu and Huang Qizhao as the director and deputy director of the publicity department. A sanctions committee was also established, with fair people from various agencies and organizations serving as members. Furthermore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce originally planned to organize an economic boycott committee against Japan independently, but because overall planning was required, the Municipal Party Department ordered it to stop organizing.</p>
<p>The Academic Community's Enthusiastic Anti-Japanese Movement: The academic community in Wuhan, indignant at the Japanese atrocities and fearing the imminent demise of the country, initiated the organization of the Wuhan Academic Community Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation, sponsored by the National Wuhan University and the private Zhonghua University. On the 15th, a representative conference was held, with representatives from all levels of schools participating. The organization was confirmed, and representatives from 25 schools, including Wuhan University, were elected as executive committee members, representatives from 5 schools, including Shanda Girls' School, were elected as alternate executive committee members, and representatives from 7 schools, including Hankou Municipal No. 1 Primary School, were elected as supervisory committee members, and representatives from 3 schools, including Yizhi Primary School, were elected as alternate supervisory committee members. The executive committee elected five people as standing committee members to form a standing committee, under which there were four departments: general affairs, publicity, action, and military affairs. Each department had one director and one deputy director. In addition, in view of Japan's failure to withdraw its troops after the deadline and its westward trend, two measures were decided: (1) Telegraph the central government to declare war on Japan and issue a declaration of national salvation; (2) Hold a large-scale parade and demonstration before the 18th of this month, with all teachers and students from all levels of schools participating, all wearing uniforms, and each school organizing a discipline team, commanded by the general discipline team.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Decides to Draft Conscription Law</h3>
<p>At the 167th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 17th, more than 20 members, including Huang Youchang, Zhu Hezhong, Zhang Mojun, Liu Jixue, Zhu Jingsong, Chen Changheng, and Shi Weihuan, proposed that the Legislative Committee, the Military Committee, and the Autonomous Law Drafting Committee be ordered to jointly draft a conscription law and complete the draft of the household registration law. After discussion by the members, it was resolved to hand it over to the above three committees to jointly draft it. The proposal of Huang and other members is recorded as follows: "Our country has always practiced a mercenary system, where soldiers are not conscripted but recruited, and whether or not to respond to recruitment is up to the people and is not a legal obligation. The countries of medieval Europe also adopted a mercenary system. Since Prussia created conscription, other countries have followed suit. People enjoy various rights in the constitution and have the obligation to pay taxes and serve in the military. The entire nation bears this burden on a regular basis, and it cannot be waived due to status or redeemed with money. Although military systems vary, they all adopt the system of universal conscription. The advantages and disadvantages of a system where the entire nation is soldiers compared to a system where only a portion of the people are mercenaries are worlds apart. The seventh item of our party's political program states 'Gradually change the current recruitment system to a conscription system,' and declares that the national government should take this minimum political program as a principle. The members are both outraged by the magnitude of the national humiliation and aware of the demands of the people. They believe that at this time, a conscription law should be drafted and a conscription system should be vigorously implemented as a reserve for the standing army, the foundation of the party and the country's well-being, and the key to national prosperity in times of difficulty can all be seen here. Furthermore, China is said to have 400 million people, but this is only a general estimate, and the investigation has not been accurate. The eighth item of the Founding Program states that a clear household registration survey in the county is the first priority. If we want to vigorously implement a conscription system and local autonomy, we should start by rectifying the household registration. The inextricable link between the conscription law and the household registration law is like a wheel on a car and a rudder on a boat. The Autonomous Law Drafting Committee of our Yuan has already started working on the draft of the household registration law and should be completed within a limited time so that it can be implemented simultaneously with the conscription law. In accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of the Yuan's Rules of Procedure, the proposal is as follows, and we respectfully await the public decision."</p>
<h3>167th Meeting of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>The 167th meeting of the Legislative Yuan was held at 8:00 AM on the 17th, with 43 members, including Shi Weihuan, in attendance. Shao Yuanchong chaired the meeting.

(2) Jiangxi Post-War Public Debt Regulations and Principal and Interest Repayment Schedule, it was resolved to hand it over to the Finance Committee for review. (3) Report from the Finance Committee of this Yuan, reviewing the Regulations on Reorganizing Shanxi Finance in 1920, it was resolved to pass it according to the review report. (4) Report from the Finance Committee of this Yuan, reviewing the Shanghai Municipal Budget for Local Revenue and Expenditure in 1920, it was resolved to pass it according to the review report. (5) Report from the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee of this Yuan, interpreting Article 1 of the Banking Industry Income Tax Law, it was resolved to pass it according to the review report.

It was resolved to approve it.</p>
<h3>Widespread Plague in Jinxi</h3>
<p>Thousands Dead in Xingxian and Baode</p>
<p>Lanxian and Kelan Also Affected</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Plague has recently been discovered again in Xingxian, Baode, and other counties in western Shanxi, and is spreading rapidly. The disease was first discovered in Linxian, but fortunately, the county took early precautions and quickly extinguished it. Before long, Xingxian and Baode were also successively found to have the plague. More than two thousand people have died in Xingxian. There is no accurate survey in Baode. The nearby Kelan County has also been affected, and the transmission is very fast, making defense quite difficult. Now all schools in the counties have been closed, and transportation between neighboring counties has also been cut off. The Provincial Epidemic Prevention Department is urgently dispatching a large number of doctors with various medicines to prevent and rescue. It is said that their method is to sacrifice a few to preserve the majority. All areas where the epidemic is rampant will be disinfected with fire, in order to eradicate the disease at its roots. According to records, Linxian and Xingxian have discovered this epidemic every year since 1919, with 1928 and this year being the most severe. Patients initially feel dizzy, then vomit yellow water, and die within a few hours. (13th)</p>
<h3>Lixiahe Drainage Project Plan</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Rehabilitation Committee held a meeting the day before yesterday and approved the Lixiahe Drainage Project Plan proposed by Engineering Committee Member Xu Kai. It was also resolved to have Committee Member Xu conduct a preliminary survey, followed by the Engineering and Relief Departments, together with the Construction Department, actively implementing the plan. The full text of the plan is recorded below:</p>
<p>A. Current Situation of the Return-to-Sea Ports: The lakes, marshes, rivers, and canals of Lixiahe are crisscrossed, making it difficult to understand their system and distinguish their origins. Generally speaking, the terrain is low-lying, shaped like the bottom of an ax, with lakes such as Sheyang Lake serving as the water storage abdomen. In the northeast, water flows from Majiadang through Funing and out of Sheyang Port. To the south, water flows from rivers such as Jiangangou, Pi Damangshe, and out of Xinyang Port. Rivers such as Shangguan Haigou flow out of Doulong Port. In the southeast, rivers such as Baitu and Chelu flow out of Wangjia Port and Zhu Port. These are the channels for draining water from Lixiahe. The rivers that run through it are also very complex. The most important is the Chuanbang River, which runs parallel to the Fan Gong Embankment. There are many sluice gates along the embankment, used to discharge water, which is divided into five ports to enter the sea. The five ports either have winding channels or high sea entrances, resulting in sluggish water flow and difficulty in eliminating accumulated water. According to the effectiveness of water discharge, Sheyang Port is the smoothest, followed by Xinyang and Doulong, and Wang and Zhu ports are the worst. According to the Canal Engineering Bureau's calculation using the water surface slope of 1921 and the cross-sections of each port, the maximum discharge of each port is approximately 1,700 cubic meters for Sheyang Port, 500 cubic meters for Xinyang Port, 60 cubic meters for Doulong Port, and 40 cubic meters for Wangjia Port. Zhu Port has not been estimated, but it is probably smaller than this. Although the above discharge values cannot be relied upon as accurate, they are sufficient to indicate a comparison of the drainage efficiency of each port.</p>
<p>B. Dredging the Five Ports: For dredging the five ports entering the sea, the plan is to straighten the rivers that are too winding, expand the cross-sections that are too small, and deepen the sea entrances that are too high. Near the sea, to prevent saltwater backflow, gate dams should be built to control it. Plans have been prepared separately, briefly described as follows: (1) Sheyang Port: Straighten three bends, with a total length of about 11.7 kilometers, and excavate about 820,000 cubic meters of earth. After completion, the distance can be shortened by about 3.79 kilometers. Build a gate dam at the sea entrance. Due to financial and work-for-relief considerations, an earth dam can be used temporarily. (2) Xinyang Port: Straighten seven bends, with a total length of about 5.65 kilometers, and excavate about 1,430,000 cubic meters of earth. After completion, the distance can be shortened by about 2.97 kilometers. The upstream Tianfei Gate to Xinkou, and the two tributaries of the Dongmen Gate River and the Flood Reduction River, must be enlarged. A soil dam will also be built at the downstream sea entrance. (3) Doulong Port: Straighten twelve bends, with a total length of about 5.3 kilometers, and excavate about 460,000 cubic meters of earth. After completion, the distance can be shortened by about 4.09 kilometers. The upstream section from Caoqian Gate and its tributary, the Niowan River, should be appropriately enlarged. A soil dam will be built at the sea entrance. (4) Wangjia Port: Straighten ten bends, with a total length of about 2.3 kilometers, and excavate about 600,000 cubic meters of earth. After completion, the distance can be shortened by about 8.0 kilometers. The downstream sea entrance is high and must be dredged, approximately 1.435 kilometers from Yuanjiadun to Huodala Zikou, excluding the original river after straightening the bends. Excavate about 1,300,000 cubic meters of earth. After completion, the discharge can be increased by about one time. In addition, the cross-section of the downstream river is smaller than the upstream, which is abnormal and should be enlarged as much as possible. A soil dam will be built at the sea entrance. (5) Zhu Port: The riverbed from Tianshuiliaozi to Santiaogang in the downstream section is high and must be excavated, approximately 1.95 kilometers long, and about 100,000 cubic meters of earth must be excavated. After completion, the discharge can be increased by about one-third. The main channel of the river should also be appropriately dredged. A soil dam will be built at the sea entrance.</p>
<p>C. Adding New Ports: The location of the five ports is biased to the north. The accumulated water from Dongtai and the southern parts of Xingtai and Dongtai must travel a long distance north to be collected. Therefore, whether for current emergency relief or for permanent benefit, it is necessary to add new ports entering the sea near Dongtai and its southern area. There are shipping salt rivers in Dongtai, Liangdui, Anfeng, and Anfeng areas that connect to the west of Chuanbang River, extending eastward for fifty to sixty li, or even seventy to eighty li. There are also large ports along the coast. If the rivers and ports are dredged and connected, a necessary channel for draining water into the sea can be established. Personnel should be dispatched immediately for surveying and selecting the most suitable one to be developed.</p>
<p>D. Construction Procedure of Return-to-Sea Ports: For the above projects, the Wang and Zhu ports should be dredged first, as these two ports are connected to Xinghua area, which is the most severely affected, and their siltation is also the most serious. However, at present, the accumulated water has not receded, and manual labor is difficult to implement. Efforts should be made to borrow dredging machines and ships to first excavate the central channel in the downstream section, using the scouring of water power, and continue to implement mechanical and manual dredging to quickly complete the sea entrance project, in order to help with the current urgent flood discharge. For the newly developed river port in Dongtai, personnel should be dispatched immediately for surveying. Once the surveying is completed, construction can begin immediately, as the terrain in the area is relatively high, and it is not currently flooded, so nearby disaster victims can be gathered to start construction ahead of schedule, in order to achieve quick results. As for all the bend-straightening projects, once the ground water in each section recedes, they should be organized simultaneously in separate sections.</p>
<p>E. Hinterland Drainage Project: In addition to the above project, the rivers connecting the Chuanbang River to the west of the five ports should also be dredged, because if the rivers are not smooth, the drainage of the Lixiahe cannot achieve complete success. Among the rivers, those with the shortest route and smoother water flow should be given priority for construction. The rivers to be dredged are temporarily proposed as follows: Jiangangou, Pi Dahe, Mangshe River, Haigou River, and Chelu River. The amount of earthwork and other items will be estimated after referring to detailed drawings. In addition, the sluice gates and dams where the Chuanbang River intersects the five ports, and the sluice gates along the Fan Gong Embankment for water discharge, should also be repaired together. If this can be done, the Lixiahe drainage work can be largely completed, benefiting both the symptoms and the root causes.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Robbery Alert at Shijia'an, Jiaozhi: At Shijia'an in Jiaozhi Township, about seventeen or eighteen li from the town in the county, four bandit boats suddenly arrived around 1 a.m. yesterday (the 17th), carrying seventy or eighty bandits, all armed with box guns and pistols, intending to land and loot. Fortunately, the local police and security corps immediately took armed precautions, causing the bandits to not dare to rob and move to other places. The responsible public security sub-bureau telegraphed the main bureau, requesting the water police team and police team to quickly dispatch teams to pursue and suppress them.</p>
<p>Gentry Request Appropriation for Repairing Dikes: Qian, the Director of the Wuxian Construction Bureau, believed that due to this year's floods, the dikes in low-lying fields had been mostly washed away. If they were not repaired urgently, there would be no hope for the spring harvest next year. Therefore, he convened a meeting of local people yesterday to discuss repair methods. It was resolved that local people would jointly petition the province for a quick appropriation to fund repairs. The Construction Bureau will also plan a budget for the construction materials.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Hotel Fined for Harboring Prostitutes, Temporarily Suspended: In the city's hotels, there are often shameless men and women engaging in illicit affairs. Last night (the 16th), three young merchants were found in the Far East Hotel in the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct, each with a young girl as a companion. Upon police investigation, it was found that they were all engaged in prostitution. In violation of police regulations, they were detained at headquarters. The shameless men and women were sentenced to 30 days of detention and a fee of 20 yuan for their nighttime activities, to be donated to flood relief. The hotel owner was ordered to temporarily suspend business as a warning for allowing prostitutes to stay.</p>
<p>Six Du Ji Kidnapping Case Cracked: On the 3rd of this month, Fan Guozhong, the Captain of the First Water Police Team, personally led his subordinates, including Squad Leader Zhou Liancheng, Wu Shirong, and Inspector Lu Yuansheng, to capture Chen Shulin, a suspect in the Six Du Ji kidnapping case of Han Lisheng's family in Jinshan Luxiang Town. Chen Shulin, 46 years old, from Yaojia Village, Jinshan Luxiang Township, usually worked as a tailor. On August 14th, he took a wheel steamer from Zhujing to Shanghai. On the boat, he met Hu Baosheng, who said that there were two fellow villagers, a man and a woman, in the fourth-class cabin who were going to Shanghai to redeem a kidnapped relative. Upon arrival at the Bund, he asked the two villagers, who confirmed that they were indeed in Shanghai to redeem a Han family member who had been kidnapped. They initially claimed that three people had come to Shanghai, but later changed it to two. He suspected that one of them was an informant sent by Inspector Yang of the Songjiang Public Security Bureau, so he fled the scene. He has now been apprehended and his confession is truthful. According to Fan, the captain, after obtaining the confession, immediately prepared a document to submit to the Minhang District Department for review.</p>
<h3>Jinshan</h3>
<p>Recent News from Jinshan and Han'an: Since June of this year, Fang Ruzhou, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Infantry, was ordered to be stationed on the coast of Jinshanwei, at the border of Songjiang and Jinshan, to carry out bandit suppression work. For several months, he has been able to supervise his subordinates and work hard to search and suppress bandits. Recently, Lu Zhaoming, Zhang Arui, Zhou Quangen, Wang Liansheng, Luo Alian, Lu Zugen, Yu Guihu and others, who are all well-known fierce bandits, have been captured. It is now heard that the central primary school and local party and government agencies there have jointly written to Commander Cao Pang of our regiment to review Fang battalion commander's efforts in clearing out bandits, in order to express public opinion. It is also heard that Lin Jianzhi, the captain of the Second Squad of the Jinshan County Police Team, has also been stationed in Fuwangdai and has achieved considerable success. It is estimated that Captain Lin has captured Xu Pingsheng, Wang Yunxiang, Yang Ahe, Qian Jinquan, Shen Youjin, Jiang Ashui, Tu Asan and many others.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Follow-up Report on the Robbery of Mocheng Town: Mocheng Town in the tenth district, about seven or eight li from the city, was robbed in broad daylight at 3 p.m. on the 15th of this month, with losses amounting to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Twenty-six people were kidnapped. According to the people of the town, the bandit boats had come two or three days earlier, pretending to be merchants and villagers. Two boats were berthed at the end of the West Market, and two boats were moored at the end of the East Market. The public did not pay attention to it. Until 3 p.m. on the 15th, a small boat suddenly arrived at the end of the West Market. As soon as this boat arrived at the west end, gunshots were heard, and the bandits who had been ambushing in the East Market each used red cloth strips as signals. They took out guns and looted the patrol boat of the Tenth Anti-smuggling Team first, tying up patrol captain Yang Guojun and others, and looting four rifles and one box gun. Then they looted the home of Fan Shaoxi, the richest man in the town, and kidnapped five men and women. The central and western sections of the town had also been looted earlier. The bandits also entered the district office, cut the telephone lines, and broke open the iron safe in the office, looting all 588 yuan stored inside. The district chief and assistant district chief, seeing that things were not good, escaped through the back door. The Mocheng Elementary School was located upstairs in the office. There were only three female teachers in the school, Peng Cuizhen and Wu Ehua. When the bandits came to search, they all fled to the kitchen stove. In the town, in addition to fruit stores, noodle shops, and teahouses, the rest were affected, without exception. The Zhu Yunshan family lost more than two catties of gold and various miscellaneous items, estimated at about 12,000 yuan. The Fang surname wood business in the west of the town also lost 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. The Fan and Dai families also suffered considerable losses. The most coincidental thing was that the Dai family was celebrating a happy event, and guests were filling the house. Dressed in gorgeous clothes, they heard of the robbery and all took off their long robes and escaped through the back door. The bandits looted the clothes and decorations together, which can be described as unearned income. Fortunately, the bride had already arrived and was not frightened. The robbery lasted from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m., when they gathered and boarded the boat, kidnapping twenty-six people and escaping southward into Kuncheng Lake. By the time the military police arrived, the bandits were already far away. According to the district office's investigation, there are 35 households that have been robbed, in addition to those mentioned above, but there are still those that have not been reported.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Construction Bureau to Ban Machine-Powered Rowing Boats: In each port of this county, since the Bianli Shipping Company dispatched steamers, the various rowing boats, in order to maintain their business, have risen up to modify their boats with machines in order to compete. However, the cabins of each boat are small, the equipment is simple, and there are no restrictions on the load, which often leads to danger. Therefore, for the sake of protecting the safety of travelers, the Construction Bureau specifically decided yesterday on the ban measures: (1) Each boat must have a reliable guarantor and register with the Bureau to wait for inspection. (2) Each boat must not sail before the Bureau issues a license. (3) Each boat must have at least ten cork life jackets to avoid accidents. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau will send personnel to each port to conduct inspections to facilitate management.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Boundary of Tonghai County Surveyed: The boundary dispute between Nantong and Haimen counties has been resolved.

Zhu Tingxie of the Provincial Committee drafted the reasons and submitted them to the province for approval.</p>
<p>Southern Business Community to Implement Military Training: The Nantong business community automatically decided to implement military training. On the 16th, a committee was established to actively carry it out.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Provincial Committee Member Urges Construction Funds: The Jiangsu Finance and Construction Departments have recently issued short-term public bonds to be purchased and recognized separately by the construction bureaus of each county, allocating them from the construction funds of various places, due to the urgent need for the Jiangbei water management project. The bonds are scheduled to be issued starting on November 1st. In recent days, committee members have been dispatched to each county to urge the payment of funds. Yesterday, two committee members came from Zhenjiang to Wuxi to urge County Magistrate Chen and Construction Director Yao to collect and remit the cash. However, Wuxi County had already resolved at the last county administration meeting to allocate 30,000 yuan from the construction funds collected and stored in the county to be used for the repair of dikes throughout the county, and to allocate another 30,000 yuan from the flood relief fund to make up for the shortfall. There were no cash reserves, so it was feared that they would be unable to comply with the order immediately.</p>
<p>Qing Sheng Theater Forced to Stop Performances: Tuo Jianfei, the section chief of the First Section of the County Public Security Bureau, accompanied by a certain section chief and three girlfriends, went to the Qing Sheng Theater to watch a play the day before yesterday without buying tickets, and entered blatantly. Unexpectedly, the ticket collector did not recognize them and advised them to buy tickets. Eventually, the five of them combined to buy two and a half tickets to enter. The next day, Tuo, concerned about his image, telegraphed Wang Xiezong, the director of the Second Public Security Bureau, ordering the theater to stop performing within one hour. The theater has now complied with the order and has submitted a request to the Party and government for relief.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Two Criminals Captured in the Kidnapping Case in the Fourth District: Zhou Dechang and Zhou Ruichang, residents of Bianshu in the Fourth District of Wujin County, were kidnapped. Zhou Dechang escaped by crossing the river, while Zhou Ruichang was held in the bandits' den. His family had received a letter from the bandits demanding 2,000 silver dollars. Upon receiving the report, the Fourth Public Security Sub-bureau, together with the garrison police team, captured the suspects Zhou Laohu and Zhou Taisheng on the 16th and sent them to the county for interrogation.</p>
<p>Robbery Case in Jinjiatang, Eighth District: On the night of the 15th, more than a dozen bandits suddenly broke into the home of Jin Youfeng in Jinjiatang, Nanshu Township, in the Eighth District of Wujin County. They carried weapons and searched the house at will, causing great losses. They left with the loot after about an hour. On the 16th, District Chief Yang Jingshi reported the case to the county and requested an arrest.</p>
<p>Two Notorious Bandits Executed by Firing Squad: Deng Denggui and Wu Tinghuan, two notorious bandits from the northern countryside of Wujin County, had committed several murder and theft cases. They were captured by the county court and, after interrogation, confessed to the facts. They were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on the afternoon of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Police Chief of Suining County Indicted for Releasing Bandits: Zhu Bichen, the police chief of Suining County, was previously accused by Song Xuejin of bribing and releasing the notorious bandit Hu Xiagang to the Governor's Office. The county was ordered to investigate and verify the allegations, and a recommendation was submitted to the provincial government to punish Zhu. Zhu, in turn, accused Song of fabricating the accusations and requested the Governor's Office to send personnel to investigate in detail. Yesterday (the 15th), the instruction stated, "The presentation has been noted. In this case, the county was ordered to investigate and verify the allegations, and a recommendation was submitted to the provincial government to dismiss him from his post and punish him severely. The request to send personnel to investigate in detail is dismissed."</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Case of Qixiu School Encroaching on Public Land Set for Investigation: You Jiliang of Qixiu Girls' School in Jiaxing encroached on more than 29 mu of public land along the city walls. After it was discovered, a report was filed with the provincial and county authorities. The county magistrate ordered You Jiliang to submit evidence of property ownership for verification. A household register with 6.4 mu of land and grain was submitted to the county. Later, a report was filed stating that the land was all public wasteland. Therefore, the three departments of civil administration, construction, and education, based on the successive reports filed by Wang Jiujin, Huang Baosheng, Bao Jiuru, Wang Liangchen, and others, believed that the land was mostly public wasteland. If that were the case, it could be evidence of public land. Although the household register submitted by the school shows 6.4 mu of land and grain, it is still questionable where the grain came from. The county was ordered to investigate and conduct an inquiry to clarify the truth before determining a solution and submitting it for review and decision. The county government has now scheduled to summon the plaintiffs Wang Liangchen, Wang Jiujin, Huang Baosheng, and witnesses Yang Shutang and Chen Jinwen, as well as the defendants You Jiliang and You Zhang Chengxiang, and other relevant parties to the county office at 2 p.m. on October 28th for interrogation in order to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Business Firms Donate Firearms to Merchants' Corps: In order to strengthen its forces, the Jiaxing Merchants' Corps is soliciting donations from local businesses to purchase more firearms. All businesses with financial resources, regardless of whether they have sent clerks to join the corps, should be encouraged to donate. It is now learned that businesses along Beida Street have successively pledged to purchase more than ten firearms (each estimated at 100 yuan). Businesses in Nanmen, Dongmen, Tangwan Street, and Zhong Street are also providing assistance based on their financial capabilities. The results of the fundraising are expected to be considerable. If this is the case, the strength of the merchants' corps in this city will be sufficient to defend one area.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Continued Discovery of Japanese Goods in Pawnshops: Hangzhou pawnshops are accepting large quantities of Japanese-made cloth at very low prices. The Anti-Japanese Association gathered high school students to organize six temporary inspection teams to conduct inspections. Thousands of bolts of Japanese goods were found in the Tongji and Xiankang pawnshops and were sealed up. Inspections were continued today, and Japanese goods worth about 300,000 silver dollars were found in Chengyu in Houshi Street. Xieji in Dajing Lane also had 708 bolts of cloth, and Wanfeng Pawnshop had hundreds of pieces of foreign goods. Tongxing Pawnshop had 107 bolts of cloth. The other pawnshops were not inspected. It is planned to continue the inspections tomorrow.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Sternly Suppresses Lake Bandits Who Robbed Weapons: On the evening of the 14th, a lake steamer was robbed by bandits at Lincheng Bridge in Si'an Town, Changxing. After receiving the news, the local security corps, led by Chief Xu, pursued and suppressed the bandits with more than 20 guards the next morning. They encountered more than 100 bandits in Guandai and immediately opened fire on the bandits. Unexpectedly, the bandits resisted stubbornly, and Chief Xu went missing. Dozens of firearms were seized. After receiving the report, the provincial government immediately instructed the Security Department Director to telegraph Shen Guocheng, the regimental commander of the 7th Security Regiment, to dispatch Dong Mingtong, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion, to rush to the scene and suppress the bandits overnight. After receiving the order, the battalion set out for the area on the same day to pursue and suppress the bandits. The 8th Company of the 2nd Regiment, stationed in Wuxing, was also notified to assist in the suppression. According to a telegram, the bandits have been dispersed and teams are still being sent to search for and rescue the kidnapped people. Local security has returned to normal.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Dispute Caused by Water Disaster Relief Association Borrowing Association Site: The Xiaoshan Water Disaster Relief Association, organized by the Xiaoshan County Party Department, forcibly borrowed the Nanhai Goods Association hall on the 15th to put on a play. The Nanhai goods industry did not agree, which led to a big dispute. The Nanhai Goods Association hall is the private property of the Nanhai goods industry. The association moved the stage equipment in without prior consent and erected colored sheds and hung lights to sell tickets to the audience. The Nanhai goods industry believed that it was inappropriate for the association to occupy other people's property privately and sealed the boxes. However, the Water Disaster Relief Association believed that since the association did not lend the building, it should donate a thousand gold coins to the association as relief funds, which was jointly rejected by the Nanhai goods industry. Unexpectedly, the Water Disaster Relief Association had privately torn off the seal and labeled the association with the crime of sealing the National Salvation Association and posted it. It also released rumors that the Nanhai goods industry would disrupt local order. At night, a large number of patrol teams patrolled the area, and the situation was very tense. As of the time of writing today, no solution has been reached. It is heard that the Nanhai goods industry has telegraphed the provincial government and the provincial party department to appeal.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Korean Hua Yishan Lectures on the Pain of National Subjugation: Since the Japanese forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces, the Ningbo YMCA has invited patriotic scholars from all walks of life to give lectures in turn from 7 to 9 p.m. every day. Last night, the Korean revolutionary Hua Yishan, also known as Zhi Xiong, was invited to lecture, detailing the pain of the two Korean states and hoping that the Chinese people would follow the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, unite with small and weak nations, overthrow Japanese imperialism, and liberate all the oppressed. After the speech, he shouted slogans such as "Long live the Republic of China!" and "Long live the unity of the Chinese and Korean nations!"</p>
<p>Airplane Flyover: Yesterday (the 15th) at about 2 p.m., an airplane with red wings flew over Ningbo from Yuyao. However, the plane did not take any other actions while passing through. It is not known which country the plane belongs to or where it is flying to.</p>
<p>Two Robberies: At 11 p.m. the night before last, the Pujing Nunnery in Jiulong Village, Yinxian County, was holding a Buddhist ceremony when suddenly 27 bandits armed with blades and wooden shells broke in and looted, taking more than 50 silver dollars and many pieces of gold jewelry, causing losses of 500 to 600 yuan. Also, at about 1 a.m. yesterday morning, the home of Shen Jimu, a resident of Zhengjiaqiao in the fifth township of Yindong, was suddenly robbed by eight bandits, who took silver dollars and clothes, causing losses of more than 200 yuan.</p>

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Summary Translation of Secret Records of Japanese Support for Rights and Interests in Manchuria and Mongolia (Continued 4)</h3>
<p>According to the statement of the Qing commissioners at the Manchurian Post-War Treaty Conference, "In order to protect the interests of the South Manchurian Railway, the Qing state promises not to build parallel main lines or branch lines that would harm the interests of the railway in the vicinity of the railway until the railway is recovered." Reading this, it can be known that the South Manchurian Railway indeed seems to have its sacred and inviolable exclusive railway rights in Manchuria. Those dispatched to connect with the aforementioned railways and build the two major east-west trunk lines are all in conflict with this statement. If our country interferes on this ground, their planned railway network should be subject to our sanctions. This is the most effective driving force for the empire's negotiations with Manchuria and Mongolia. However, according to the spirit of international law, the national defense construction of an independent country can be based on its own autonomous actions. Therefore, even if we have the above statement of the Qing commissioners, we cannot use it to prevent the construction of its entire railway. However, it is still possible to select important routes and use this right to destroy them. Unfortunately, however, many legal scholars say that the statement can only be regarded as a kind of hope and cannot be regarded as a formal claim of interests. The main points are as follows: (1) Those not clearly stated in the treaty cannot be regarded as a legitimate claim of interests in the treaty. (2) The Qing commissioners did not obtain the permission of the Qing emperor before or after the event, and their statement was clearly an act beyond their authority and is not legally binding under international law. (3) At the time of the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Post-War Treaty and its supplementary treaty on December 20, 1905, Article 2 of the treaty stated, "The Japanese government undertakes to abide by the existing treaties between the Qing and Russian states regarding leased land and railway construction," etc. However, there is no condition in the railway treaty between Qing and Russia that prohibits the construction of parallel lines. If Japan insists on regarding the Qing state's statement as valid, it is clearly contradictory to Article 2 of this treaty. (4) In the statement, "Qing state..." there is no indication of the word "government" under the two words "Qing state" at the beginning, so naturally the responsibility for this statement cannot be interpreted as being borne by the Qing state government... In addition, the so-called "protecting the rights and interests of the South Manchurian Railway" refers to the government's encouragement and protection of private enterprises, and the government has the right to change the protection period itself. (5) If the statement is valid, then the South Manchurian Railway can become the exclusive transportation railway in Manchuria in one fell swoop. There is no precedent for this in the world, and if there is, it violates the principles of human progress and happiness. (6) It clearly violates the principles of territorial integrity and equal opportunity for China at the Washington Conference. (7) The interpretation of the word "vicinity" in the statement is difficult to agree upon. Is a distance of a few miles or dozens of miles considered the vicinity? Most of the above legal arguments are from British and German legal scholars, and there are quite a few in our country. However... China is not a country of law, and its people also lack legal knowledge. If the empire uses this as a reason to approach them with majesty, we firmly believe that the dispatched representative will undoubtedly be able to resolve the pending case of the South Manchurian Railway in exchange for some kind of benefit for us... As for the pending cases of Tao'an, Ang'angxi, Jidun, and Sipingjie-Taonan, most of them are related to money. However, the advisory rights of Tao'an and the accounting rights of Jidun are very necessary in order to contain the prosperity of their railway network and extract their power and function. Therefore, we must strive to realize these rights in order to consolidate the empire's special privileges. As for the South Manchurian Railway's contracting of roads such as Jidun and Tao'an, they all use cheap materials produced in our country, but they still quote prices based on expensive foreign products, and the personnel used for construction and application are also increased in calculation by the empire's convenience, so the construction costs are quite large. Although the dispatched representative knows this, he has no knowledge or evidence to settle accounts with us... We will urge them to calculate this cost with us, and wait until it is clear, then take advantage of their current financial difficulties to force them to repay it in full. They will definitely approach us to discuss postponement or conclude a formal loan treaty. However, in order to guide the South Manchurian Railway to profit, we can sacrifice part of the aforementioned construction costs and induce them to agree with us on the Manchurian-Mongolian railway movement. If not, then we can sacrifice the delayed interest on the Sipingjie-Taonan Road in exchange for an agreement on the cargo absorption area. If they sincerely make such an agreement with us, then no matter how they develop their railway network, our South Manchurian Railway will never be afraid of their encirclement.</p>
<p>Regarding the freight agreement, the freight rate of the railways dispatched must be made the same as the freight rate of the South Manchurian Railway. The basis for the same rate is a certain unit of freight per ton per mile. Regardless of the length of the distance, it will be calculated according to the agreed amount. When the two major east-west trunk lines of the dispatched railways are completed in the future, the distance between the origin of the special products of northern Manchuria exported through Huludao and the port will be greater than the number of miles exported from Dalian by the Qing. ...The burden of freight will inevitably increase. As for competition outside the agreement, the dispatched railways will use their political power as a backing. We will reduce port fees, warehouse fees, drinking water fees, etc., and use the function of our regulatory financial institutions to provide convenience and benefits to the cargo owners. The crown of final victory must belong to us. In addition, the dispatched railways often reduce their freight rates, causing the Chinese coal along their lines to enter and exit our Fushun coal like a torrent. This year's reduction in income is indeed due to this. If the freight agreement is established, part of the Chinese coal will inevitably flow into the South Manchurian Railway, which will increase its cost and make it unable to compete with Fushun coal.</p>
<p>Regarding the agreement on the cargo absorption area, the steps are proposed as follows: (A) To the east of the South Manchurian Railway, Wuchang, Jilin, Hailong, etc. are the central line. Products west of it will be absorbed by the South Manchurian Railway, and products east of it will be absorbed by the dispatched railways. To the west of the railway, Qiqihar, Tao'an, Tongliao, and Ningjiang are the central line. Products east of it will be absorbed by the South Manchurian Railway, and products west of it will be absorbed by the dispatched railways. (B) In the western part of the South Manchurian Railway, the products north of Sipingjie to Taonan belong to the South Manchurian Railway, and the rest belong to the dispatched railways. In the eastern part of the South Manchurian Railway, the goods north of Changchun to Jidun belong to the South Manchurian Railway, and those south of it belong to the dispatched railways. (C) If the dispatched railways are not satisfied with both proposals A and B, then slightly imitate the example of the South Manchurian Railway's agreement with the Chinese Eastern Railway. For goods going south, the South Manchurian Railway gets 44% and the dispatched railways get 55%. This does not matter whether the export is from Dalian, Huludao, or Yingkou. The total number will be counted at that time and calculated proportionally. This is the empire's last concession. (D) If the above examples of proposals A, B, and C cannot achieve the purpose, then seek Zhang Xueliang's consent, convene relevant authorities of the Chinese Eastern, South Manchurian, and other railways to jointly meet with the dispatched railways to discuss coordination methods.</p>
<p>However, our ideal is that in order to ensure the empire's rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia forever, we should use the South Manchurian Railway as a joint Sino-Japanese venture to realize coexistence and co-prosperity as a signboard, and move the dispatched railways to merge their railway network with the South Manchurian Railway as a joint venture. In this way, (1) we can eliminate the bad name of imperialism, (2) we can confuse the intelligence of the Chinese people, and (3) we can block the intrusion of European and American capital forces. In the event of an emergency, the imperial army can freely mobilize and occupy any road by virtue of joint venture rights. For the sake of the empire's ultimate goal in Manchuria and Mongolia, we must deeply consider this. Recently, we received intelligence from London that the dispatched railways are trying to extend their magic hand to Qinhuangdao in order to strengthen their driving force against us. Unfortunately, if the "free cargo calculation port" they are promoting is realized, our South Manchurian Railway and Dalian Port will suffer an unexpected blow. Although we are currently using the power of the Japan Mail Steamship Company in London to send the "Cargo Alliance Headquarters" to Europe to destroy it, we cannot be optimistic. What is even more painful is that Red Russia originally had the sincerity to conclude a secret treaty with us to prevent the encroachment of the dispatched railways' forces. Unexpectedly, upon seeing the dispatched railways' magic hand extend to Qinhuangdao again, they feared that the prosperity of Vladivostok and the Chinese Eastern Railway would be greatly affected. Taking advantage of the dispatched railways' sending them an olive branch, they resolutely changed their position and made concrete approaches to the dispatched railways, further leaving the empire to face the enemy alone.</p>
<p>According to information from the South Manchurian Railway's correspondent in Tianjin, the dispatched railways are promoting Qinhuangdao and Hong Kong as free cargo calculation ports. If successful, the Beining Railway plans to build a third wharf that can accommodate nine 5,000-ton steamers. Combined with the existing ones, its accommodation capacity can reach the giant of 100,000 tons of ships. In this way, the cargo distribution capacity of Qinhuangdao Port will reach 5 million tons in one fell swoop. In the future, it will use its two major east-west trunk lines as weapons to cultivate it, which is truly capable of controlling the fate of our Dalian Port... From the origin to the export of special products in northern Manchuria, if we talk about distance, it is only three miles closer to their than our South Manchurian Railway area. However, comparing freight rates... We cannot compete with them after all. Our South Manchurian Railway and Dalian Steamship Company, etc., are threatened by Qinhuangdao, and will regard Huludao as even worse.</p>
<p>We knew early on about Zhang Xueliang's clever diplomatic skills, so before taking office, we visited the veteran Lin Quan-chu to seek his guidance on diplomatic strategies toward Zhang Xueliang. Fortunately, Mr. Lin did not reject us and taught us his secret strategy, saying that although Zhang Xueliang is the son of a warlord, he is actually a very rich strategist as a fair-faced scholar. Even veteran diplomats from the diplomatic countries of the world such as England are no match for him. When conducting diplomacy with him, you must first use respect and obedience as a prelude, and from time to time, express false sincerity and make speeches that are beneficial to him in his place in order to induce his trust. Next, create various strong claims from the supervisory authorities to scare him. Finally, ask him to protect our rice bowls and beg him to sympathetically resolve the various negotiations. However, what still needs to be guarded against is that he must not be allowed to use this strategy against us. We, in the place of office, referred to the opinions of Consul General Lin and thoroughly studied the history of various diplomatic actions of the South Manchurian Railway during Zhang Zuolin's era, believing that Mr. Lin Quan-chu's teachings were indeed a good strategy for dealing with Zhang Xueliang. We may or may not use it accordingly. This time, the empire is exerting its diplomatic power over Zhang Xueliang, believing that the timing is most suitable. Therefore, it is good to be able to achieve complete success. In terms of the worst result, if the empire cannot realize its vested railway rights, the dispatched railways must also suspend the construction of their two major east-west trunk lines. If the empire's special status and rights in Manchuria and Mongolia can be maintained as they are now, it can naturally save the South Manchurian Railway from danger. Even if we throw our vested railway rights into the land of nowhere, the empire's diplomacy can also be said to be a triumph. There will always be a heaven-sent opportunity to solve all the problems in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>The above is the minimum amount of harvest expected in case of negotiation failure. We hope it will not come to such a point. As for the following items, they are intended to be the prelude to this negotiation and have already obtained the approval of President Sengoku. Consul General Lin, the commander of the Kwantung Army, and the governor of the Kwantung Territory have also fully understood. If they can be realized, it can be a full score for the success of the negotiation: (1) The Manchurian-Mongolian railway issue is a matter of profit-making private companies, such as the interests of the South Manchurian Railway, so it should be regarded as a local issue, with Zhang Xueliang as the responsible official. If Zhang Xueliang uses the excuse that the Manchurian-Mongolian diplomatic power has already been incorporated into Nanjing to evade his responsibility, at the very least, Zhang Xueliang must negotiate with the Nanjing government on behalf of the South Manchurian Railway Company. (2) The development of the Manchurian-Mongolian railway must take Sino-Japanese coexistence and co-prosperity as the main focus. If its two major east-west trunk lines harm the interests of the South Manchurian Railway or are parallel to the South Manchurian Railway, they must suspend their construction in order to not harm our vested rights. (3) The empire has repeatedly protested the roads that have been successfully built, such as the Jihai Railroad. For the sake of coexistence and co-prosperity, it can be tacitly approved, but what conditions must be exchanged and the operational interests of the South Manchurian Railway must be guaranteed. (4) The link between Tao'an and Datong is parallel to the South Manchurian Railway, which is a particularly harmful violation of vested rights. Therefore, the Tongliao-Taonan Road must absolutely not be allowed to be built. (5) If Tao'an and Datong must be linked and built, the South Manchurian Railway also wants to build a cultivation line to protect its rights and interests. (6) The Changda Road and the Jihui Road are desired to be realized immediately. (7) Realization of the unresolved railway loans, advisory rights, and accounting rights of the South Manchurian Railway. (End)</p>

China has suffered from unequal treaties for years. Now, all unequal treaties have become disadvantages. During this period, we should first feel the pain of national subjugation. We know that Manchuria and Mongolia were lost first, and then all of China will be lost. How can we save the country now? We must rely on ourselves to prepare as quickly as possible. In this regard, our Boy Scout community in particular should awaken first and build our strength. We should emulate the good points of others and strive to correct our mistakes. Today, the council members being sworn in are the leaders of the city's Boy Scouts. We will work hard on these points, on the one hand developing the Chinese Boy Scout cause, and on the other hand working to save the nation, and so on.</p>
<p>Swearing-In The oath briefly stated, "I swear with utmost sincerity to uphold the will of the Premier, believe in the Three Principles of the People, abide by the oath and regulations of the Chinese Boy Scouts, and faithfully strive in the duties entrusted to me.

<p>丨First Act of the Westerners' Football Association First Division丨</p>
<p>The well-equipped and uniquely-styled Donghua Football Team made its debut on the Shanghai football scene yesterday at 3:00 PM, upholding a spirit of dauntlessness to continue their relentless struggle and achieve the purpose of their founder, Sheng Pinchen, to "promote sports and enhance national glory."

<p>丨Truth of the Battle丨</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, the battle began. Lehua launched the first attack, but was repelled. Donghua surged forward like a tide. After ten minutes, Fei Fuxu delivered a well-placed pass, and Yichen broke into enemy territory. Ten yards from the goal, he kicked the ball, which the goalkeeper let slip through his legs, opening the first page of Donghua's football history with a victory record. Lehua was busy preparing in the first half, with only two counterattacks. The first attempt succeeded, a rare feat. Ten minutes after the first goal, left winger Sun Huipei passed to the center, and Yu Shunzhang shot from two yards in front of the goal, hitting the mark. Although the score was tied, the strength of the two teams was still unequal. Lehua's goalkeeper, Qu Hongde, was uneasy, unable to protect both sides of the goal. Under the weight of Donghua’s attacks, how could there be unbroken eggs in the nest? Any goalkeeper would have difficulty coping with this storm. Another ten minutes later, Donghua's Chen Hongguang received a ball from the left and charged straight into the goal, making it 2-1. Five minutes later, chaos in Lehua's goal allowed Donghua's Dai Linjing to seize the opportunity and score. Five minutes later, Donghua's Fei Fuxu showcased his speed, drawing applause as the ball spun in the net. Finally, Dai Linjing passed to Li Yichen, who shot into the goal. By halftime, Donghua led 5-1. In the second half, Donghua's team maintained their order, and their morale was high. Lehua defended their line with strong spirits. One side attacked with all their might, while the other defended tenaciously. At this time, Lehua's goalkeeper, Qu Hongde, suddenly showed clear improvement, protecting the goal with great merit. The three forwards Dai, Li, and Chen shot with both their heads and feet like a dense rain, making it no easy task for Qu to use all his senses and take care of both the upper and lower areas. For forty-five minutes, Lehua was under a one-sided attack, but only conceded one goal to Li Yichen in the fifteenth minute, showing good defense. In the end, Donghua won 6-1.</p>
<p>丨The Strength of the Two Teams丨</p>
<p>Donghua's debut today attracted attention from both Chinese and foreigners, reminiscent of Lehua in its golden age. Goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan, a giant on the sea, is truly exceptional. The two inside backs, Li Ning and Guan Xun'an, are experienced and have strong legs. With these three, there is no need to worry about the future. Tu Kaiyuan is physically strong and a talented center back, supplemented by the experience of Chen Jiaqiu and Chen Pu. The center back line is solid. (Ouyang Yongyuan, who represented Chen Pu yesterday, is also a talented newcomer.) The left and right wingers, Fei Fuxu and Chen Yutian, are both short and strong, capable of doing their jobs well. Right inside forward Chen Hongguang, who played for the Chinese team last year, has already made a name for himself as an inside forward. Left inside forward Li Yichen comes from Hong Kong, agile and with the talent of a general. Center forward Dai Linjing has unique skills in both head and footwork. In short, Donghua's team is well-rounded, and given time, will undoubtedly become a strong force in Shanghai. Lehua's strength has not improved, but Yu Heng's enthusiasm in maintaining the team and the players' courageous service, without letting victory or defeat diminish their spirit, is worthy of our praise. The players are mostly students from Guanghua and Fudan universities, physically fit and of good quality. While it may be difficult for them to stand out now, they will surely impress in the future. Strive for it, and what is there to worry about? I hope all the team members will encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Heavy Rain: Lin Baohua vs. Defu</h3>
<p>Rescheduled for This Afternoon</p>
<p>丨Qian Wenbao vs. Ma Anquan丨</p>
<p>丨Fight for the Junior Singles Championship丨</p>
<p>丨Shanghai Wins Doubles Against Malaysia Yesterday丨</p>
<p>The grass tennis club's senior singles semi-final between Lin Baohua and Defu was scheduled for yesterday afternoon, but the weather was unfavorable. Several heavy showers fell, and although the audience was drenched, they were reluctant to leave, waiting until 3:30 PM when the rain still had not stopped. The club secretary announced that the match would be postponed to this afternoon. Yesterday's tickets will still be valid today.</p>
<h3>Junior Singles Final</h3>
<p>Starting at 1:45 PM this afternoon, the junior singles final between Qian Wenbao and Ma Anquan will be held first, still at the Shanghai French Business Association court on Avenue Joffre.</p>
<h3>Lin Baohua vs. Defu</h3>
<p>After the junior singles final, the senior singles semi-final between Lin Baohua and Defu will follow. The winner will face Qiu Feihai in the final, which has been rescheduled for the end of next week.</p>
<h3>Qiu Jiang Wins Doubles</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the doubles exhibition match between Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang against Lin Wangsu and Yang Lunzhang started in good weather. Qiu Jiang won two sets in a row, 6-1 in the first and 6-4 in the second. In the third set, each side won one game before the heavy rain suddenly arrived, and the match was called off. Qiu Jiang's performance was excellent, smooth, and unprecedented, with great teamwork. They won six games in a row in the first set, and the second set was slightly more difficult. Qiu Jiang used a lot of interceptions and kills, while Lin and Yang suffered from Yang's low skill level, with many net touches and suicides, resulting in most of the lost points. Lin Wangsu's lobs and long shots also lacked precision, probably because they played immediately after arriving.</p>

<h3>The People Eagerly Await the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>Waiting for the Guangdong Committee to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Guangdong Side Telegraphed, Designating Representatives</h3>
<p>Awaiting Ship to Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the holding of the peace and unity conference, it was previously said that members of the first, second, and third Central Committees would be invited to participate. Yesterday, according to a certain important person, the Guangdong-based committees do indeed hold this view. However, because the committees are scattered in various locations, it is difficult to gather them together quickly. As the state of affairs is such and the holding of the peace conference is very urgent, in fact, it is not possible to convene the first, second, and third committees as desired. In order to expedite the realization of national unity, it was decided, with the agreement of the Guangdong-based committees obtained by the representatives of the Chiang faction, that only the Nanjing and Guangdong sides would hold joint discussions. As for Huang Huabiao's arrival in Shanghai, it was reported that he represents Li Bai and others, but this is not accurate. Huang is actually representing Huang Shaoxiong and has been in contact with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Guangdong Side Telegram To Mr. Zhantang, Upon receiving your telegram, we were pleased to learn of your safe arrival in Shanghai. This morning's meeting resolved to appoint Zhaoming, Ke, Chaochu, and Wenfan as representatives, and we are now awaiting a ship to Shanghai. Meeting you will not be far off. The rest can be discussed in person. Zheru, Focheng, Yingfen, Shaoyi, Ke, Jitang, Zongren, Youren, Wenfan, Chaojun, respectfully.</p>
<p>Banquet for Various Circles It is learned that Mr. Hu will hold a banquet for leaders from various circles in this city at the Sun residence on Molier Road at 9:00 AM today. The invitations have already been delegated to Mayor Zhang Yuejun to send out on his behalf yesterday.</p>
<p>Liu Luyin's Talk A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Mr. Liu Luyin, who said that before Mr. Hu Zhantang sent his telegram, he had received a joint letter from Wang Jingwei, Tang Shaoyi, Sun Ke, Gu Yingfen, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zheru, Chen Jitang, Wu Chaochu, Li Zongren, Li Wenfan, Chen Ce, Qin Zhen, Tang Shengzhi, and other gentlemen, entrusted to Mr. Chen Zhenru to deliver to Nanjing in person. The letter stated, "The three gentlemen, Cai, Zhang, and Chen, have arrived in Guangdong and stated the necessity of peaceful unification. We all share this sentiment. However, our unanimous request is for you to come to Shanghai for a visit. If you arrive in Shanghai, we will immediately send representatives to Shanghai to discuss the progress of unification. We have entrusted Mr. Zhenru to return first and contact Mr. Jieshi to discuss everything. We believe that these minimum requirements can be met. We hope that you will comply with our wishes and come to Shanghai to comfort the hopes of our comrades and promote the progress of peaceful unification." Then each person signed their name. Therefore, Mr. Zhantang's telegram was a reply to the letter from Mr. Wang and others, and it was an honest statement to all comrades. The salutation in the telegram was thus addressed only to the above-mentioned. Yesterday at noon, a reply telegram was received from Guangzhou, stating that Wang, Sun, Wu, and Li have been appointed as representatives to come to Shanghai. Mr. Hu immediately instructed Commissioner Wu Tiecheng to return to Nanjing to report to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. The reporter asked, "With the Guangdong side sending people to Shanghai, is cooperation between Mr. Hu, Mr. Chiang, and Mr. Wang in the future, and peaceful unification, assured?" Mr. Liu said, "The key to peaceful unification is only the four words 'sincere unity.' This is a matter of the entire party's reunification, not the cooperation of certain individuals. The headlines in today's newspapers about the cooperation of certain individuals are actually misunderstandings. I hope that the people of the country will not observe this process of peaceful unification with individual political views, so that true peaceful unification can be realized." The reporter then asked, "Are there any other news today?" Mr. Liu said, "From last night to this morning, we have received many telegrams from overseas and other provincial party headquarters offering condolences to Mr. Hu. Other than that, there is nothing particularly important."</p>
<p>Condolences to Mr. Hu The General Branch in the United States sent a telegram to Hu Hanmin, saying, "Overseas Chinese in various parts of the Americas feel that our country's diplomacy is precarious and that there is a need for unity within the country to resist foreign aggression. We are deeply concerned about peaceful unification within the country. For several months, the General Branch in the United States has been exchanging letters and telegrams, calling for peace, and repeatedly sending telegrams to Nanjing, requesting Mr. Hu Hanmin to return to work. Now that we have received news of Mr. Hu's arrival in Shanghai, we are sending this telegram (the 17th) to Mr. Hu to express our condolences and express our hope that Mr. Hu will proceed with peace, complete unification, and unite against external aggression."</p>
<h3>Citywide Labor Unions' Declaration to Promote Peace and Save the Nation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Postal Staff Union, Publishing Industry Union, District Water and Electricity Industry Unions, District Cigarette Industry Unions, District Cotton Textile Industry Unions, and over seventy other labor unions declared, "To the public at home and abroad through various newspapers, our country today is facing internal hunger and starvation, with mourning cries heard everywhere. Externally, it is being invaded and plundered by Japan, more brutal than tigers and wolves. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent. Our party and national leaders, where great righteousness lies, are all deeply self-reproaching and are about to gather in Nanjing and Shanghai to hold a peace conference, to plan a way to save the nation, with joint efforts,</p>
<p>and jointly save China. At this time when the whole country is yearning for rescue, our associations hereby express our patriotic sincerity and solemnly declare to the people of the country: To achieve peace and save the country, the last instruction of the Premier is clear, and it is also known to our people. This time, Japan has brazenly occupied the Southeast, creating a source of human conflict. Its brutal actions have been spurned by countries around the world. For the sake of self-defense and the peace of the world, our country will never tolerate the destruction of international law and human justice by Japan, nor will we allow such uncivilized humans who disregard morality to reside within our Chinese territory. We firmly believe that this necessary movement of our country against Japan, which is sufficient to eliminate the scourge of humanity, will gain the sympathy and assistance of countries around the world. Therefore, all our citizens have made a final determination and are working hard to undertake the important task of maintaining world peace, especially in urging the government to strengthen its military and make all necessary preparations to match Japan's speed. As for the great plans to save the country from peril, it is especially urgent to unite from top to bottom in order to be effective. The blame for past divisions lies in foreign aggression. By learning from the past and mending the fold after the sheep have been lost, the convening of the peace conference is a preemptive plan to resist Japan and an urgent request of the people of the country. At this time of crisis, we earnestly hope that the famous figures of the party and state, the patriots, will be of one heart and one mind, and gather to make great plans. Only peace can save the country, and only saving the country can achieve peace. The sooner the peace conference is convened, the sooner our country's national crisis will be resolved. All that we do is the aspiration of our people. If we hesitate and seek only personal gain, regardless of the overall situation, or dare to monopolize and act arbitrarily, and willingly undermine the peace conference, we will all be public enemies of our people and criminals of the Republic of China. For the sake of national survival, our people will surely rise up and attack them. Our people deeply know that China is the China of the Chinese people, and the politics of China are to be undertaken by the Chinese people. From now on, we will resolutely shoulder the long-term task of revolutionary national salvation, revitalize our spirit, and work together with those in power to achieve the great cause of national salvation, so as to show the strength of democratic politics and prevent the malpractices of the past of not caring about national affairs. The opportunity for survival or extinction, life or death, is tied to this. We sincerely express our words, hoping for your public review."</p>
<h3>Gan Naiguang and Others Scheduled to Visit Hu</h3>
<p>He Xiangning Will Soon Return to China</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo Also Has News of Coming to Shanghai</p>
<p>Second Central Committee member Gan Naiguang, after traveling to Europe and the United States in the sixteenth year of the Republic, has devoted himself to writing. He has not been involved in national politics for a long time. Usually, apart from the Central Committee member He Xiangning, who is currently in France, and the Central Committee members Wang Jingwei and others in Guangdong, there is little contact with the other committee members. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited him at his private residence in the French Concession. According to him, since Hu came to Shanghai, he has been very busy, so he has not yet met with him. He plans to schedule a meeting with other committee members in the coming days to visit him. Gu Mengyu, Chen Zhenru, and others met with him during their last visit to Shanghai. The two men did not express any opinion on the peace conference. Whether or not they will attend the peace conference in the future has not been determined and depends on the opinions of the other committee members. It is hoped that He Xiangning will return to China soon. Chen Gongbo also has news of coming to Shanghai. As for national affairs, since he has not been involved in them for several years, he does not wish to express any opinion.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Severely Punishes Treacherous Merchants</p>
<p>Ye Hongying, the Owner of Yuanlai Trading Company, and Shao Baoxing</p>
<p>3,000 Bags of Tapioca Flour Decided to be Confiscated in Full</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association submitted a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, stating, "Regarding the case of the Yuanlai Trading Company's tapioca flour, the circumstances of the case and the proposed handling methods are hereby reported, and we respectfully request your review and filing for record." On the 12th of this month, the association received the No. 195 instruction from your association, stating, "According to a report from our association's Sixth District Party Headquarters, a small number of members of the Anti-Japanese Association held an illegal meeting and protected treacherous merchants. We request that you send personnel to thoroughly investigate and deal with them according to the law, in order to warn treacherous merchants and benefit the salvation of overseas Chinese," and attached the original and duplicate reports to the association. Based on this, we immediately copied and issued the original and duplicate reports, each one, with the instruction that the association immediately follow and report back with the handling details. In response to this order, we found in the case file that the Yuanlai Trading Company's tapioca flour (i.e., potato flour) case, which was previously proposed by the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Relief Association, had been resolved by the eighth executive committee meeting of the previous association. The resolution stated that the goods were Dutch goods posing as Japanese goods and that a fine of 3,000 yuan should be imposed to assist disaster relief, and the goods should be returned, with committee members Chen Songyuan and Zheng Chengqing responsible for handling the matter. After the ninth executive committee, Hou Dachun and Li Yongxiang, two committee members, sent a letter requesting reconsideration, but it could not be put to a vote due to insufficient numbers. After the association took over the handover, it submitted the case to the third standing committee meeting for resolution, and then to the ninth executive committee meeting for resolution. Nine committee members were then designated to review the case: Shi Liangcai, Long Peiyun, Lu Muqin, Wang Changyuan, Wang Pingnan, Ren Jinpin, Xu Mujue, Zhang Zilian, and Hu Shuhua. After the sixth executive committee meeting on the 14th of this month, it was resolved that this case was an important case handed over to the association by the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Relief Association. The fifth executive committee designated nine committee members - Shi Liangcai, Neng Peiyun, Lu Muqin, Wang Changyuan, Wang Pingnan, Ren Jinpin, Xu Mojue, Zhang Zilian, and Hu Shuhua - to form a review committee on file. Based on the report from the nine committee members, two types of tapioca flour were purchased: one was Dutch goods, white in color and not smooth, and the other was Shantou goods, light gray in color and coarse in grain. After detailed review, each committee member pre-arranged to retrieve a batch of goods held back in Pudong. At the sixth executive committee meeting, the packages were opened for inspection in public. It was found that the goods held back were snow-white, smooth, and light lake-green in color, confirming that they were Japanese goods. The various certificates of the Yuanlai Trading Company were clearly mismatched, and the Yuanlai Trading Company had about 8,000 bags of goods in Pudong, of which the association only detained 3,000 bags. The remaining Dutch goods were not detained. A unanimous resolution was passed to confiscate the detained goods, and the manager of Yuanlai Trading Company, Ye Hongying, and Shao Baoxing, who protected treacherous merchants, were referred to the association's disciplinary committee for punishment. The case records are all on file. The manager of Yuanlai Trading Company, Ye Hongying, and Shao Baoxing, who protected treacherous merchants, have been referred to the disciplinary committee. Once a meeting is held to handle the matter, it will be reported again. Due to the aforementioned order, the circumstances of the case and the handling methods are hereby reported in writing, requesting your association to review and grant approval for filing for record. This would be for the public convenience."</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Held the Second Municipal Propaganda Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>General Order for All Party Members to Join the Militia</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters convened the second municipal propaganda conference at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, attended by Wu Xiu, Huang Xianggu, Huang E, Zhou Hanmei from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Yang Youyu, Wang Guoping, Wu Zhen, Chen Xiaomei, Li Chunpei, Diao Qing'en, Liu Yisun, Sun Mingqi, and over ten other propaganda committee members from various districts. After the meeting began with customary formalities, Chairman Wu Xiu reported, followed by reports from the propaganda committee members of various districts on the progress of their work. Then, discussions began: (1) Japanese residents in this city are provoking in various ways in an attempt to achieve their ambitions. How should we respond? Resolved: (Secret). (2) The Municipal Party Member Militia has been actively preparing. Is it necessary to suggest that the Municipal Executive Committee issue a general order for all party members to join? Resolved: Passed. (3) The Municipal People's Militia has been actively preparing. How should we encourage our compatriots to join? Resolved: Passed. (4) Some small newspapers in this city are fabricating rumors and confusing the public. Should we correct them separately? Resolved: Passed. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association's Telegram to the National Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Immediately Adopt Proper Self-Defense</p>
<p>To the Nanjing National Government: According to a telegram from Geneva yesterday, the League of Nations is indignant at Japan's lack of international integrity and courtesy. The Administrative Council, disregarding Japan's opposition, unanimously resolved to invite the United States to attend. Japan has already shown contempt for the League of Nations, and will certainly harbor resentment afterward. Its tendency to be vindictive is inevitable. We fear that Japan will further expand its violent military and barbaric scope. We urge you to immediately adopt proper self-defense to avoid regretting it later. If Japan's atrocities are not curbed, the League of Nations will inevitably take a further step and resolutely implement the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant, requesting member states and the United States to sever economic and social ties with Japan and implement military action. Our country is the first to bear the brunt and should be the first to prepare for implementation. We are sending a special telegram requesting that wise men from across the country be summoned to work together with one heart and one mind to overcome national difficulties, safeguard national rights, punish the violent Japanese, maintain the dignity of international covenants, and place world peace on a solid foundation. The people of the whole country will be your backing. In this telegram, we are anxiously awaiting orders. Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jiqing, Chairmen of the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association, respectfully bow.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce's Telegram to the National Government</h3>
<p>Please Quickly Devise a Fundamental Plan to Save the Nation</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying: To the Nanjing National Government: Since the violent Japanese invaded and occupied our Liaoning and other places, the affiliated associations have telegraphed Your Government, requesting the adoption of a proactive policy, and have sent telegrams to merchants and people across the country to unanimously implement economic severance with Japan and issue a statement to the people of the world. In addition to jointly sending telegrams with the China Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce to the League of Nations, requesting the adoption of necessary steps to implement the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant, and telegrams to the International Chamber of Commerce, advocating justice and fairness to maintain world commerce, all are on file. We recently received a telegram from Geneva yesterday stating that the League of Nations is indignant at Japan's lack of international integrity and courtesy, and disregarding its opposition, unanimously resolved to invite the United States to attend. Under these circumstances, Japan will naturally suffer great disgrace in international history. Whether it can suddenly come to its senses is still questionable. We urge Your Government to quickly prepare proper self-defense measures and to quickly summon wise men from across the country to work together with one heart and one mind to devise a fundamental plan to save the nation. As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." We hope you will carefully consider this. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Li Kui'an, Zhang Yuquan, Peng Chuli, Lu Guangji, and Chen Riping, respectfully bow.</p>
<h3>Batavia Chamber of Commerce Advocates</h3>
<p>Declaring War on Japan</p>
<p>The Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, saying: Telegram received. Here, a National Salvation Support Association has been established and is actively working. Please advocate that the whole country unite and declare war on Japan. Overseas Chinese pledge to be your backing. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce replied to the telegram, saying: Telegram from the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce received. Your city's establishment of a National Salvation Support Association in response to Japanese atrocities has been reported in newspapers. We are willing to work together. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Navigation Association Suggests Rejecting Leases of Japanese Ships</h3>
<p>And Requests British Merchants to Act in Concert</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Anti-Japanese Association yesterday, saying: Greetings. On the 16th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Navigation Association stating that, after reading reports, the Japanese Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, in view of the tense anti-Japanese atmosphere in our country and the decline in business, intends to lease all of its ships to British shipping companies to operate as usual and collect rent. Although this has not yet been verified, in order to prevent problems before they occur, we should ask your association to forward a letter to the National Salvation Association to send letters to various British shipping companies, urging them not to lease Japanese ships, lest they hurt our country's feelings and be affected. At the same time, notify the freight forwarding industry association and various merchant guilds that regardless of the nationality of the merchants, any Japanese ships leased or managed by them will not be allowed to load cargo, so as to prevent circumvention and assist in the boycott. Please investigate and handle accordingly, which is what we hope for. Accordingly, we are sending this letter for your association to investigate and handle.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Work in All Circles</h3>

<p>Kang Yuan Factory Swears to Boycott Japanese Goods　Kang Yuan Factory in this port, in view of the failure of previous boycotts of enemy goods to be thorough, and the criticism of being a "five-minute enthusiasm," has drafted a vow and yesterday ordered all employees and students to sincerely read the vow, so that they will abide by the oath for life and never change. This is also the meaning of establishing a divine teaching. As for the swearing location, it varies according to the religion they believe in, such as Catholics to priests, Christians to pastors, and Buddhists and Taoists to temples and city god temples. The vow is recorded below. If comrades from all walks of life can earnestly promote it, the future of boycotting enemy goods will definitely have great results. Vow to Boycott Enemy Goods　I, as a Chinese, have boycotted enemy goods several times, but without good results, and have even suffered extremely humiliating bullying from the enemy. Therefore, relying on my conscience, I swear never to buy enemy goods again. From today onwards, if I am insincere, not only will I not die a good death, but my descendants will never have a chance to rise again. The supervising god bears witness to this heart. A certain person on a certain day, month, and year, swears sincerely.</p>
<p>Expression of the Rickshaw Industry　The Rickshaw Industry Association, yesterday, in view of the worsening national affairs due to the Japanese military's invasion of the Northeast, specially resolved to conduct a large-scale anti-Japanese movement, organize a Japanese Goods Inspection Committee to sever economic relations with Japan, post slogans along the way, and separately promote to members and the public. Yesterday, another circular telegram was issued, calling for peace and requesting the government to send troops to resist aggression as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Authorities of Chinese and Concessions Confer to Maintain Order in Concession Areas</h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun Visited Fessenden Yesterday</p>
<p>Protecting Chinese People on North Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Volunteer Teams Have Been Dispatched on Alert</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Since Japanese ruffians on North Sichuan Road have repeatedly provoked incidents, Mayor Zhang has already protested to the Japanese Consul-General Murai and received Murai's agreement to do his best to persuade the Japanese residents. However, such incidents occurred again the night before last and have not stopped. The future of the city's public safety is still not a long-term solution. Yesterday, in order to ensure the city's peace and prevent the recurrence of such disputes, the municipal government specially sent Secretary-General Yu Hongjun to formally visit Fessenden, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, at 10 am to jointly discuss specific cooperation measures for the Chinese and concession sides to jointly maintain order in the city. As a result, Fessenden greatly supported the municipal government's intention to maintain order and prevent disputes and expressed his decision to add more posts and do his best to maintain order, so that such incidents would not happen again.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, the Municipal Council is also paying close attention. Yesterday, in order to maintain order, the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps dispatched a Russian volunteer team of 50 people to be assigned to the North Sichuan Road area starting last night to be on alert and prevent riots by Japanese ruffians.</p>
<p>A reporter from the China East News Agency visited Secretary-General Yu yesterday. According to Yu, Japanese ruffians have repeatedly provoked and insulted our concession citizens and unreasonably torn up slogans in the public concession, which is not the attitude that people from civilized countries should have. I visited Secretary-General Fessenden of the Municipal Council this morning, requesting him to fully cooperate to protect Chinese citizens in the concession and to stop all barbaric acts of Japanese ruffians. Because our people are driven by righteous indignation and patriotism, they post slogans and unanimously resist Japan. This kind of behavior does not violate the law. However, the Japanese have repeatedly provoked incidents, obviously intending to cause major disputes. The Municipal Council has a duty to strictly ban them. Fessenden said that the Municipal Council has done its best to stop Japanese provocations, has sent a letter to the Japanese consulate to restrain its residents, and has also increased the number of police and police to suppress them at any time. The Municipal Council has done its best to maintain order in this serious situation, but hopes that the Chinese people will remain calm and avoid radical books and slogans that may cause ill feelings among the Japanese and increase disputes. I said that our people are very calm about the Japanese violent attitude. Since the Municipal Council cannot point out any radical pictures or slogans made by any Chinese, how do they know that they are not fabricated by the Japanese? Fessenden said that the Municipal Council will definitely give full protection to the citizens of the concession.</p>
<h3>Attitude That Government Employees Should Maintain in the Midst of National Crisis</h3>
<p>If There Are Opinions, Only Suggestions Can Be Made</p>
<p>All Banquets and Entertainment Are Stopped</p>
<p>Municipal Government Order　The Shanghai Municipal Government issued an order to various subordinate bureaus yesterday (16th), saying: In order to comply with the matter, according to Administrative Yuan No. 5141, National Government Order No. 480, Central Executive Committee Special Character No. 967: Since the Shenyang Incident occurred, the central government has decided on a policy and announced it to the whole country. All employees of government agencies should abide by the intentions of the central government, take uniform steps, and set an example for the people. They should not act on their own initiative, which would disrupt the system. After deliberation by this committee, it has been decided that if employees of agencies under the National Government have any opinions on the violent Japanese incidents, they should submit them to the heads of their respective agencies for suggestions to the government, and should not arbitrarily express opinions to the outside world. This is hereby communicated, and it is hoped that you will check and order compliance. Since it should be complied with, it should be forwarded and universally complied with. This order, etc. Since it should be complied with, in addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the Municipal Government, to comply with it immediately and order its subordinates to comply with it, etc. Since it should be complied with, in addition to sending it separately, this order is hereby issued to the Bureau to comply with it and order its subordinates to comply with it. This order, Mayor Zhang Qun.</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau Notice　The Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau, upon the order of its superiors, issued a notice to all civil servants in the bureau yesterday, saying: Recently, the Municipal Government ordered that now that the country is in a difficult situation, all employees of this government and its subordinate agencies should stop all banquets and entertainment. Unless the heads of each office or bureau report that it is an unavoidable accident and approve the leave, they will not be allowed to leave their posts without permission. This is hereby ordered to be notified for universal compliance. This notice.</p>
<h3>Japan's Conspiracy</h3>
<p>The Smallest Goal Is to Build the Jihui Railway</p>
<p>The Biggest Goal Is to Occupy the Entire Northeast</p>
<p>Monthly Payments of Three Million Yuan to Xi Qia</p>
<p>According to someone familiar with the Japanese situation, who spoke to the reporter yesterday, the Japanese dispatch of troops to Liaoning and Jilin this time is by no means accidental. Because the completion of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan conflicts with its interests in the Northeast, it is becoming increasingly aggressive in sending troops to invade Manchuria. In recent years, because our Northeast diplomacy has obeyed the central government, the Japanese tricks have not been sold, so they are angry and send troops to suddenly occupy Liaoning and Jilin. The smallest goal of occupying Liaoning and Jilin is to build the Jihui Railway. Therefore, they are working day and night to complete this road in the shortest possible time. The League of Nations has set a deadline for withdrawing troops by the 14th. I know that the Japanese army will not withdraw for a day until the Jihui Railway is completed. However, Japan, in view of the recent international situation, is actively using the policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" to provoke discord among our people and make them hurt each other. At 3 pm on December 7th last year, the Japanese government held a secret meeting to support the rights and interests of Manchuria and Mongolia. Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda, President Sengoku, and the two Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs all attended. There were more specific and concrete resolutions on annexing the Northeast, rushing to build the Jihui Railway, and using the policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese." This time, Japan threatened and lured Xi Qia and others to organize a puppet provincial government, and the Japanese side provided three million yuan per month, and agreed to give one month's payment for each month they occupied, in order to achieve their conspiracy of stationing troops and building roads. Now the deadline set by the League of Nations for withdrawing troops has passed, but the Japanese troops have not withdrawn and are even pressing in, because the Japanese people's smallest goal has not yet been fully achieved, and the largest goal of occupying the entire Northeast is also being explored step by step. I hope the people of the country will be vigilant.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Ruffians Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>More Than 100 People Have Arrived from Dalian</p>
<p>Activities Will Begin Once Funding Is Obtained</p>
<p>Japan previously sent a large number of warships to China, hoping to find an excuse to implement active actions and carry out its conspiracy to break our people's anti-Japanese national salvation movement. However, the patriotic movements in our various places have become more and more intense, and they have strictly observed order. Japan has no choice. The warships that arrived in China have returned in disappointment. Recently, a guest returned from Dalian. According to the conversation, Japanese soldiers, in view of the unfavorable international situation, have no excuse to use against China, so they secretly sent a large number of ruffians to Shanghai to carry out activities. More than 100 people have arrived in Shanghai in succession. Every ten people are in a group, and two people in each group are equipped with pistols. Four people specialize in provoking and making trouble everywhere, and the other four are responsible for informing. Once an incident occurs, the Japanese Marine Corps can make a mountain out of a molehill and create a serious situation. These people are preparing funds, and once they have funds, they will start formal activities.</p>
<h3>More Japanese Marines Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After dispatching a large number of marines to Shanghai, the Japanese Ministry of the Navy has now transferred 30 naval marine officers and soldiers from the naval corps of the 2nd Naval District Wu Garrison Command, transferred them from Wu to Kobe, and came to Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru. Yesterday, the officers and soldiers of the team disembarked and were stationed in the Hongkou team in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Mainland News reported that at 2 pm yesterday, about 200 Japanese marines landed from the Tianlong warship and went to the barracks on Jiangwan Road, North Sichuan Road. A large amount of munitions was also transported to the barracks on Bazilu Road for storage.</p>
<h3>Japan Interferes with Dalian Customs and Shenyang Post Office</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reported that after Japanese army and navy officials blocked the port of Dalian and interfered with the Chinese customs' exercise of its duties, it is now learned that the customs authorities have paid attention to it. Also, the Japanese military commander in Shenyang is not allowed to remit money out of the country from the Chinese post office, which also violates the Universal Postal Union Convention and treaty provisions. It is expected that the Chinese government will lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Continue to Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>Chinese People Have Difficulty Going to Dalian　Goods transported from Shanghai to South Manchuria could still be reported and loaded yesterday. However, when Chinese people go to Dalian Bay, the inspection is very strict upon arrival. But in fact, there is no significant prohibition on Chinese people entering and leaving the port. Therefore, no Chinese people went to Dalian on the Changchun Maru yesterday. As for Chinese ships sailing to Dalian, the Zhengji Company in this port is still dispatching voyages, because its captain and first and second mates are Japanese, so they can enter and leave conveniently. Other Chinese ships have completely stopped sailing.</p>
<p>All Japanese Ships on the Sichuan and Hunan Rivers Stop　Japanese ships in the Sichuan River and Hunan areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have no cargo to transport due to the intense boycott. Nisshin Company had already suspended the Shanghai Yichang Wheel Daheng Maru and Daji Maru the day before yesterday. Now, all the Chongqing liners Yunyang Maru, Xuanyang Maru, Deyang Maru, Changyang Maru, Fuling Maru, and Jialing Maru, which operate on the Sichuan River, have also stopped. As for the Yuanjiang Maru and Wuling Maru in the Hunan class, they have now been transferred to Hankou to carry Japanese residents and are also not operating. There are no traces of Japanese shipping in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Merchant Ships Also Stop　Osaka Shosen Kaisha has been affected by the boycott on various routes in China in the past month. The number of passengers has been cut off and no goods have been loaded. Except for government-ordered ships, which cannot stop business due to postal relations, it has now been agreed to officially suspend the Shanghai-Yokohama route and the Yokohama-Osaka-South China-Guangzhou route first. The ships undertaking these routes have been temporarily transferred to Taiwan. Although the ships on the routes in Fujian and Shantou have not stopped business, there is no business at all.</p>
<p>Customs Ship License Issue　According to the customs regulations, if a merchant ship stops sailing and can resume operations within three months, if it has not resumed operations after three months, the ship license issued by the customs will be revoked according to regulations, and the ship will not be allowed to operate. If our country can maintain this spirit of boycott and continue to persevere, it will not be difficult to recover the Japanese shipping rights in China.</p>
<h3>Chen Songyuan, Executive Committee Member of the Anti-Japanese Association, Protects Treacherous Merchants</h3>
<p>Three Inspectors Imprisoned in Police Station</p>
<p>Bodyguard Draws Pistol to Intimidate</p>
<p>The National Society reported that yesterday, after the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this port obtained a secret report that Daxian and others were privately importing Japanese goods, Jiang Menggu and Cai Liansun, the leaders of the association's special inspection team, led inspectors Wu Zhiping, Ge Jiguang, and Wang Wen to inspect the Xieda Xiang foreign cloth store in Xiaodongmen. It was found that the Japanese goods in the store had been sealed off by the foreign goods industry association, but most of them were still sold in the store, claiming to be old stock. After the inspection team thoroughly investigated the purchase register, it was found that most of the Japanese goods were newly imported. The team argued with them and advised them to seal them up, but they refused, saying that they would wait two hours to discuss it. Soon, the team rushed to Yuan Changxiang foreign cloth store for another inspection. Unexpectedly, Yuan Changxiang used a quick method to have the association seal all the Japanese goods. The team believed that the seals were newly added and the paste was not dry, so it was necessary to inspect them. They asked for the goods register to check, but all other documents were handed over for public inspection, but the foreign goods register could not be found. While they were arguing, Chen Songyuan came in from outside and claimed to be the chairman of the Foreign Goods Industry Association, guaranteeing everything. The team argued strongly and refused to compromise, but Chen Songyuan also claimed to be an executive committee member of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, saying that he had not assigned the team to inspect Xieda Xiang. The dispute had not ended, and suddenly Western police arrived and took the three inspectors Wu, Ge, and Wang to the police station. Team leader Jiang and others had no choice but to return to Tianhou Palace. Chen Songyuan also rushed there, and the two sides argued without a solution. Unexpectedly, Chen's bodyguard drew a pistol to show off, and all the staff were shocked. The association's security guards saw that the situation was not good, so they disarmed and detained the bodyguard.</p>
<p>It was also reported that after the association imprisoned Chen Songyuan's bodyguard, all the staff, bearing the heavy responsibility of anti-Japanese national salvation, denied the bail of other executive committee members of the association and refused to compromise. It is said that it is scheduled to open an executive committee meeting tomorrow morning to discuss a solution.</p>
<h3>Case of Treacherous Merchants in Minhang Resisting Inspection</h3>
<p>County Locals Exceptionally Indignant</p>
<p>Declarations from All Sectors Demand Stern Punishment</p>
<p>The entire committee of the Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, while inspecting Japanese goods at various stores in Minhang Town on the 15th, were met with resistance from treacherous merchants such as Xin Xiechangxiang, Wang Xieshun, and Dong Huida, who forcibly seized back the confiscated Japanese goods and incited hoodlums to assault the association's staff. The association convened an extraordinary joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees the other day to discuss measures to deal with the situation. It is learned that since the incident occurred, all sectors in the county have been extremely indignant. Besides unanimously preparing to take action, they issued a special declaration yesterday. It is also reported that the County Farmers' Association will request a convocation of a county-wide mass meeting to decide on disciplinary measures. The declarations of various groups are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Anti-Japanese Association: To all County Party Headquarters, County People's Organizations, and Local Anti-Japanese Associations: On the 15th of this month, the entire Standing Committee of our Association, accompanied by inspectors, departed for Minhang Town to inspect Japanese goods. They were obstructed by three treacherous merchants, namely Ye Yuda, Xin Xiechangxiang, and Dong Huida, who run foreign goods stores. Initially, they refused inspection, resorting to vile language and abuse. Subsequently, they gathered a mob, attempting to forcibly reclaim the confiscated Japanese goods. Ultimately, they instigated a mass riot, injuring our association's secretary. At a time when Japanese troops are rampant and the situation is deteriorating daily, with our nation and people on the verge of extinction, it is imperative that all of our citizens unite their efforts to stem the tide. Yet, there are treacherous merchants, so shameless, who obstruct anti-Japanese work, undermining the national salvation movement, and bringing shame upon our 400 million compatriots, providing a laughingstock for imperialists. If this is pardonable, what is not pardonable? Our association, unwilling to see the decline of anti-Japanese national salvation, will confront the treacherous merchants with an unwavering spirit and extremely severe measures. We hope that the people in all regions will provide assistance to ensure that treacherous merchants are eradicated, so that anti-Japanese work will not be obstructed again. This will be a great fortune for our Chinese nation. We hereby telegraph this to you for your consideration and attention. The Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee bows.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Anti-Japanese Association: Our association, in light of the abhorrent aggression of the brutal Japanese and entrusted by the people of the entire county, has been established for over a month. Standing on the position of the people, we bear the responsibility of resisting Japan and saving the nation, aiming to achieve the withdrawal of Japanese troops through economic severance, so that imperialists dare not belittle China, and our Chinese nation can achieve freedom and independence in the world. Our association, adhering to this principle, has never neglected the work of rigorously implementing economic severance. Therefore, on the 15th of this month, the entire Standing Committee, based on the resolutions of the second Standing Committee meeting, went to Minhang Town, together with local teachers and students, to inspect Japanese goods in various stores, to examine the effectiveness of our association's work over the past month and to assess the extent to which merchants are saving the nation. At the time of inspection, the stores welcomed the initiative with national salvation zeal, except for three stores owned by Ye Yuda, Xin Xiechangxiang, and Dong Huida. These treacherous merchants not only refused inspection and hurled abuse but also gathered thugs, surrounded the inspectors, assaulted them, and seized back the Japanese goods. At a time when Japanese troops are becoming increasingly fierce, and our people are making renewed efforts, these treacherous merchants have become so insane that they are willing to betray the country. They are indeed the scum of merchants and the traitors of the people. If they are not punished, it will not be enough to warn others. For the sake of the future of anti-Japanese national salvation, we will absolutely not grant them leniency. In addition to petitioning the authorities to strictly apprehend the principal offenders, we hereby announce these facts to all the people in our county, hoping that you will be aware of the situation, unanimously denounce them, and eliminate this public enemy with utmost urgency. We hereby declare.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Education Association: To all Shanghai newspaper offices, all provincial and county anti-Japanese national salvation associations, all education-related organizations, and groups: Since the brutal Japanese invaded and occupied our Three Northeastern Provinces, all people with any sense of honor are filled with grief and indignation. They all believe in using low-quality goods to counter Japanese products and in using the peaceful method of economic severance to achieve the goal of resisting Japan and saving the nation. However, something unexpected happened. The Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association dispatched important staff members to Minhang yesterday (the 15th) to inspect Japanese goods, but treacherous merchants such as Xin Xiechangxiang, Dong Huida, and Ye Yuda dared to resist inspection, gathering a mob to commit violence, surround and beat the association's staff, and rob them of their clothes and belongings. Their madness has reached its extreme. If they are not punished publicly and controlled, the people's zeal for saving the nation will be extinguished, and the crisis of the brutal Japanese invasion will become even more acute. Our association, witnessing this firsthand, cannot help but feel grief and indignation. Therefore, we declare to the entire nation, seeking unanimous assistance, to use just public opinion to impose severe sanctions in order to punish the treacherous merchants and benefit national salvation. We hereby declare.</p>
<p>Declaration of the County Farmers' Association: To all anti-Japanese national salvation associations and people's organizations in Shanghai: Unfortunately, in our county, the treacherous merchants of Minhang refused inspection of Japanese goods yesterday, instigating thugs to assault Mr. Chen Guo'an, the secretary of the County Anti-Japanese Association. At a time when the nation is in distress and foreign aggression is pressing, the treacherous merchants seek only profit, disregarding the nation's survival. They gathered hoodlums, behaving like bandits, ignoring their conscience, and losing their reason. Despite the County Anti-Japanese Association's efforts to guide them with kind words and repeated explanations, the ringleaders, such as Xin Xiechangxiang, Dong Huida, and Wang Xieshun, refused to restrain themselves, yelling abuse and inciting violence, using street ruffians to carry out riots, surrounding the People's Education Hall, and smashing car windows and other objects. Fortunately, the members of the County Anti-Japanese Association handled the situation with leniency and only ordered the police to arrest them. However, the thugs became even more arrogant, jumping onto cars, stripping Secretary Chen of his long gown, and snatching his badge and fountain pen. Their madness and actions are contrary to public opinion. They dared to rely on force to gather crowds and commit violence. If they are not thoroughly investigated and punished, it will not be enough to appease public anger and benefit anti-Japanese efforts. Our association believes that this matter is not only a disgrace to the entire Shanghai County but also a shame to the nation. We urge people from all walks of life to unanimously denounce and eliminate these national traitors. Our association hereby leads all the farmers in the county, vowing to be the vanguard. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Telegram Received by the Garrison Department Regarding the Situation in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The Staff Office of the Garrison Command received a telegram yesterday from the Staff Office of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters regarding the situation in the upper reaches, as follows: (1) According to the telegram from Chief of Staff Yuan of the Eleventh Army, the situation and handling of the fire at the Japanese Naval Club in Taohualing, Yichang, due to negligence, are as follows: The Japanese Naval Club in Yichang burned down a kitchen and an adjoining secretary's office. The Japanese warship captain's protest was previously reported in the document. It was found that the club was originally an empty house with high walls all around. It is unknown how the fire started, as it occurred around one o'clock in the evening. Upon receiving the alarm, our department immediately dispatched a team to assist in the rescue. The Yichang County and Public Security Bureau also led police teams to extinguish the fire. The fire started from within in the middle of the night. Detailed information has been ordered to be investigated by the county bureau. The Japanese warship captain's protest was followed by our staff's reasoned negotiations. Later, he made no further representations. At noon, the Japanese warship captain requested that the club be sealed off and important items be moved out. In recent days, our deployment of troops to protect the Japanese consulate and the Nisshin Trading Company has been understood by the Japanese residents. The efforts in fighting the fire were witnessed by the Japanese naval marines. The details reported in the Osaka News are greatly exaggerated. (2) Japanese residents in Hankou are actively preparing for war, sparing no effort. They are also building fortifications on important roads in the concession, with extremely strict defenses. Fortunately, the government offices are maintaining security strongly. Although the anti-Japanese movement among the people is at its peak, the city is as peaceful as usual. (3) Several thousand bandits, fully armed, suddenly emerged from Zhongxiang towards Tianmen Yuekou in western Hubei several days ago. After the stationed troops resisted and dispatched large forces to suppress them, the bandits have been routed.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Advocates for Domestically Produced Matches</h3>
<p>Sent Letters to All Sectors to Adopt Products of the Great China Company</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various trade associations regarding the promotion of domestically produced matches, stating: We respectfully inform you that we received a letter from the Great China Match Co., Ltd. on the 14th of this month, stating that since the merger of Chang, China, Hongsheng, Yusheng, and District Companies to form our company, we have made extreme improvements to the matches we produce. All foreign raw materials have long been rejected. Although we may have occasionally used them in the past, the amount was extremely limited. Now, we are determined to absolutely resist even this small amount. Chemical experts have been studying alternative materials to achieve this goal. As for the domestically produced matches we produce, such as Fisherman, Shanghai, Pine Old, Three Happiness, Gold Tripod, Moon Rabbit, Five Blessings, Jiangsu, etc., there are no less than dozens of varieties, which are distributed to various provinces and are very popular among users. We have long achieved remarkable results in resisting foreign goods and recovering rights. Among them, the Chicken Brand matches have a special method of making the medicine head, which has been chemically tested for many years, and the branches are soaked in medicinal water. The quality is more superior to other brands. Please vigorously promote and widely publicize them. It is verified that the Great China Company is organized by Chinese investors. In recent years, they have carefully studied and improved manufacturing. Various products can compete with foreign goods and are popular in various places, earning the praise of users. At this urgent time to promote domestic goods, the company's request for all sectors to adopt them is a citizen's duty. Based on the above, we hereby send this letter to you, hoping that you will take it into consideration and promote and encourage your members to adopt them. We deeply hope for your assistance.</p>

<h3>Security Measures on North Sichuan Road Amidst Anti-Japanese Voices</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Dispatches More Russian Volunteer Corps Members</p>
<p>In the area of North Sichuan Road in Hongkou, Japanese individuals have recently been tearing down slogans, attempting to provoke incidents and create various disturbances, which has been greatly resented by various shops and residents. Fortunately, the police authorities of both the Chinese and concession sides have been doing their best to maintain security, and no major incidents have occurred. However, in order to maintain order, the Municipal Council has, in addition to the existing patrol officers, also dispatched Russian Volunteer Corps members from last night onwards to patrol the streets in shifts, totaling about fifty people. They are divided into small teams of varying sizes. The Russian members wear helmets and carry rifles with bayonets, moving back and forth between the intersection of North Sichuan Road at Bazilu, Yokohama Bridge, and Qiujiang Road. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau and the police station have also dispatched capable officers to stand guard on the side of the road, while Japanese naval marines are also seen parading on the road to demonstrate their presence.</p>
<h3>The Rascality of Japanese Merchants</h3>
<p>Failing to Pay Wages</p>
<p>Instead Inciting Violence</p>
<p>The Songshima Foreign Goods Store, located above a lead skin shop at No. 185 Dulu'an Road, specializes in contracting masonry and miscellaneous work. A carpenter from Gaoyou named Zha Dagui worked for the store, and the Japanese owner owed him 35 yuan in wages. Despite repeated demands, the wages were not paid. Initially, it was agreed to pay on the 4th of this month, but it was not paid on the due date. Then, it was agreed to pay in full the other day, but nothing was paid. Zha then asked Yang Zhengxing, a native of Yangzhou who had originally introduced him, to help him demand the wages yesterday evening. Unexpectedly, instead of paying the money, the Japanese and others incited violence, using iron water pipes to beat Zha and Yang on the head, causing serious injuries. After Yang called for help, the Japanese involved, Wu Benhaiye and two others, were arrested by the Hongkou police and sent to the Japanese Consulate for investigation. However, the headquarters of the Japanese naval marines stationed at the end of Bazilu, regardless of the facts, immediately dispatched a large number of Japanese soldiers, armed with rifles and live ammunition, to demonstrate their presence. The injured Yang Zhengxing, 31 years old, a native of Yangzhou, residing at No. 73 Xinjia Road, was sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. The wound on his left forehead was quite serious.</p>
<h3>Hu Fufang Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Kidnapped While Inspecting Construction</p>
<p>Car License Plate Found to Be Forged</p>
<p>Hu Fufang, 34 years old, a local resident of No. 821 Hujiazhai, Weihaiwei Road, owns a piece of ancestral land at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road. He is currently constructing six buildings to be rented out. Yesterday morning around 9:45, Hu went to inspect the site. While discussing matters with workers inside the second building, a number of kidnappers suddenly arrived, carrying pistols. They dragged Hu out and forced him into a car parked by the roadside, speeding away. Onlookers only knew that the license plate number was 1876. They immediately reported to the Xinzha police station, and the police chief ordered detectives to investigate. It was discovered that the car's license plate was actually forged. Car number 1876 belongs to a Japanese man residing at No. 114 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession. There were about five kidnappers in total. One was the driver, two carried out the kidnapping, and the rest were lookouts.</p>
<h3>News of Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>News from the National Government's Flood Relief Committee</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese from Nanyang Enthusiastically Assist in Disaster Relief: This flood has affected almost the entire country. Our overseas compatriots have been saddened by the news. Donations from places such as Singapore have been very enthusiastic. The Overseas Chinese Ancestral Country Flood Disaster Committee in Su Dong, in addition to collecting donations of over 40,000 yuan, which have been remitted back to the country in installments, also collected clothing as the weather became colder. The first batch consisted of 28 boxes, and the second batch also consisted of 28 boxes, all of which have been received by the National Government's Flood Relief Committee and successively transported to the disaster areas for distribution. The patriotism of these overseas Chinese in disaster relief is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy Donates Medicines: After the disaster, epidemics are rampant, and prevention cannot be delayed. Wuzhou Pharmacy, in concern for the disaster areas, donated five boxes of medicines twice, worth 3,000 yuan, which were handed over to the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee to be sent to various places for use. Their benevolence and enthusiasm are commendable.</p>

(3) The association has appointed Jiang Yunjiu and Zhou Zanting as the director and deputy director of the Wujiang Investigation and Relief Bureau, Wu Zhigang and Zhu Shizhan as the director and deputy director of the Jiangyin Investigation and Relief Bureau, Yu Yefeng and Jiang Xuan, and Xi Qisun as the director and deputy director of the Wuxian Dongting Investigation and Relief Bureau, Hua Fuguang and Zhu Jingchuan as the deputy director of the Baoying Investigation and Relief Bureau, transferred Hao Xufu as the director of the Xinghua Investigation and Relief Bureau, Sun Yinting as the director of the Funing Investigation and Relief Bureau, and Qiao Mengqian concurrently as the director of the Gaoyou Investigation and Relief Bureau. (4) The disaster situations in Baoshan Pingan and other sands, Nantong Changyin sand, Jiangning Shazhou dike, Jiangdui, Wujiang, and other counties have been investigated and reported by the assigned personnel and presented to the meeting. Wu Zhigang and Wang Shaoyun will continue to investigate the disaster situations in Jingjiang, Chuansha, Chongming, and Qidong counties. (5) The association's receipts are as follows: (A) 158,000 yuan from the Provincial Relief Committee; (B) 57,695 yuan from donation books; (C) 542,667.91 yuan from various charitable groups and individuals directly sent to the association. The total receipts were 758,362.91 yuan. (6) The association's disbursements for relief are as follows: (A) 411,599.54 yuan for rescue and accommodation in various counties; (B) 29,340.87 yuan for purchasing Changmian flour, cotton clothing, biscuits, etc.; (C) 7,935.10 yuan for transportation and other expenses. The total disbursement was 448,875.51 yuan, leaving a net balance of 294,487.40 yuan. (7) The situation of the closure of rescue work by the investigation and relief bureaus in various counties. Matters for discussion: (1) Committee Member Wang Yiting and others proposed to borrow the uncultivated area of the Dafeng Company for drainage and relief work. The company requested repairs in the spring of next year. How should this be handled? (Decision: Await the engineer's report before making a decision.) (2) Committee Member Cheng Yiqing and others proposed to allocate funds to assist in the dredging of the Yifan and Gongxing rivers in Lianshui. (Decision: Appropriately subsidize from various relief items.) (3) Committee Member Cheng Yiqing and others proposed that the rescue work in the most severely affected areas is nearing completion, and urgent relief is being investigated. The fields are submerged, and there is no prospect of water receding. Once frozen, winter relief will be impossible to implement, and starvation is a concern. Should winter relief preparations be made during the urgent relief household investigation? Please provide an overall plan. (Decision) (A) Based on the association's confirmed number of 1,827,500 people needing relief, the lowest estimate for winter relief is 2 yuan per person, totaling approximately 3,655,000 yuan. The association's balance is only over 290,000 yuan, which is far from sufficient. In addition to requesting the Provincial Relief Committee to allocate more funds and the National Government Relief Committee, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, and the Chinese Jisheng Association to separately undertake, the association will do its best to raise more funds. (B) All offices will be closed immediately, and unfinished matters will be handled by the investigation and relief bureaus. (C) The urgent relief work in counties that have not yet completed the investigation should be carried out in advance, and the urgent and winter relief should be combined, while supplementing relief for those who have fled. (D) A portion of the small labor relief for repairing the dikes will be included in the winter relief. Relief without work is not relief, and work without relief is not work. (4) Committee Member Huang Hanzhi and others proposed that the disaster areas in Nantong, Chuansha, Chongming, Qidong, Jingjiang, and other counties should be included in the winter relief program. (Decision) Passed. (5) Committee Member Cheng Yiqing and others proposed the amount of funds to be allocated to the bureaus established in Dongting Mountain, Wuxian, and Wujiang Jiangyin. (Decision) Included in the winter relief plan. (6) Committee Member Zhu Yinjiang and others proposed that the breaches in the Gaoshaoyun Dike in Jiangbei should be repaired as soon as possible, otherwise relief efforts will be insufficient. How should this be promoted? (Decision) Send a letter urging the Jiangbei Canal Post-Disaster Engineering Committee to actively proceed. (7) Committee Member Huang Hanzhi and others proposed that the provincial relief committee's public bonds be used as collateral and retained for winter relief funds. (Decision) Merged with the third proposal and a letter will be sent to the provincial relief committee for allocation. (8) Committee Member Wang Yiting and others proposed to add Mr. Han Zishi, Mr. Shen Shida, and Mr. Zhu Jiazhen as executive committee members of the association. (Decision) Passed. Meeting adjourned.</p>

We have carefully listened to it. It has been submitted to the 12th Standing Committee meeting of the association this month, and in accordance with your instructions and the original intention of the Shantou Fund-Raising Committee for the Wuhan and Various Provinces Flood Disasters, the relief fund of 30,000 yuan will be allocated to the six provinces most severely affected by the disaster: Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu. Each province will receive 5,000 yuan, which will be telegraphed to the disaster areas in each province for urgent relief. In order to fulfill the intent of your entrustment, we have issued receipt No. 28927 from the association and enclosed it with this reply, asking for your confirmation and forwarding. We also hope that you will express our gratitude on our behalf." (2) A telegram was sent to Liu Zhensheng, the special commissioner for relief in Bengbu, stating, "We have read your telegram. It is appropriate to allocate flour to Yingshang in a discretionary manner. The Daily Meeting decided to continue allocating 5,000 yuan of relief funds to northern Anhui.

(3) A telegram was received from the Fuyang County Flood Disaster Relief Committee, stating, "The people of Fuyang are unfortunate and have suffered repeated disasters. After the fifteenth year of the Republic, military disasters and bandit troubles have come one after another. In May of this year, hail the size of eggs affected about half of the county's area. The wheat was about to ripen and suffered heavy damage. In early June, the Huai River flooded, and dikes and embankments collapsed. The wheat was submerged, and the crops were drowned. The disaster was already severe, but during June and July, there were more than fifty days of continuous rain. At the same time, the upstream water surged, and the rivers rose, making it impossible to drain the accumulated water. The villages in the entire county were submerged and washed away. The water level was more than two feet higher than in the tenth year of the Republic. Autumn beans and sweet potatoes were also completely hopeless. There is no prospect of sowing green beans and buckwheat. Hundreds of thousands of lives are displaced, crying for food. The current situation cannot continue. We implore you to have compassion and allocate funds for relief and publicize the situation in the newspapers. We are endlessly grateful and await your orders." (4) The association replied to the Fuyang County Flood Disaster Relief Committee in a telegram, stating, "We have respectfully read your telegram and forwarded it to Mr. Liu Zhensheng, the special commissioner for relief of the association, for verification and handling, and to publicize it on our behalf."</p>
<h3>Thirteenth Regular Meeting of the Anhui Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anhui Flood Relief Association held its thirteenth regular meeting yesterday. The chairman was Xu Jingren, and the recorder was Gu Chuansi. The resolutions were as follows: (1) A letter was sent to the Fengyang County Chamber of Commerce stating that the relief funds allocated by the association should still be used for emergency relief and should not be diverted to subsidize rice prices. (2) Medicines were allocated to be delivered by Lu Chewu to the Anhui Northern Flood Relief Association for distribution. (3) The 2,000 sets of cotton clothes already received were sent to northern Anhui for distribution first.

Concerning the disaster areas in various counties: (1) Establishing loan offices; (2) Organizing work relief; (3) Subsidizing rice prices; (4) Distributing relief grain; (5) Distributing cotton clothes.

Work relief required 10 million yuan; D. Cotton clothes required 1.5 million yuan; E. Subsidizing rice prices required 1 million yuan; F. Loan offices required 500,000 yuan; G.

At a time when the entire country was suffering from disasters, it was feared that it would be difficult to raise such a huge sum of money at once, so the order of priority should be determined based on urgency.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Li Yuxuan's Marriage Seeking Dispute in Canada</h3>
<p>Wanted to Get a Dancing Girl for Two Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Good Things Didn't Happen Because the Money Was Too Little</p>
<p>Discovered a Case of Ant Matchmakers Trafficking in People</p>
<p>Matchmakers Handed Over on Bail Awaiting Trial</p>
<p>Zhang Zhimou, who used to work as a teacher in a primary school run by overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, returned to Shanghai with overseas Chinese Li Yuxuan and stayed at Room 244 of the New World Hotel. Li, who was over fifty years old and raised in Southeast Asia, came to Shanghai to</p>
<p>Seek a Female Companion to Amuse His Twilight Years. However, being unfamiliar with the place and not knowing the local language, he entrusted Zhang to find someone. Zhang was a friend of Shao Yuefeng, the director of Guangshan Hospital at No. 78 Xizang Road, and asked Shao to help him find someone. Shao then consulted with Wu Cao, a woman from Zhejiang Province. Wu Cao told him that Xu Chen, who lived at No. 114 Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road, was an experienced ant matchmaker. If given a generous reward, things would surely work out. She introduced Xu Chen to Shao. Xu Chen said that she had a daughter named Guizhen, who was waiting to be married and was currently a</p>
<p>Dancer at the Great Eastern Dance Hall. If Li did not mind her humble status, she could serve him well. She then provided a photo of Guizhen to Shao to pass on. Li Yuxuan was satisfied. Fearing that after the marriage, there might be a case of switching brides, he insisted on meeting Guizhen first. Shao agreed. So, on the 15th, the two parties officially met. They then discussed the bride price. According to Shao's relay of Li's intention, he was willing to offer 200 gold pieces. Although Xu Chen thought the amount was too small, she did not want to ask for more,</p>
<p>Only Saying That She Would Discuss It Further. So, they dispersed without reaching an agreement. The next day, Wu Cao's daughter had a love dispute with a Mr. Wang, an employee of the Yong'an Company Theater. Wang accused her of slander, and the First Special District Court ordered her to be released on bail. Shao learned of this and worried that if no one bailed her out, Li's request would be delayed. In order to help Li and Guizhen</p>
<p>Achieve a Union, it was still necessary to rely on Wu Cao's assistance. Therefore, he bailed her out of court and used this favor to pressure her to quickly present Guizhen to Li Yuxuan, saying that Li had to board a ship that night and return to Southeast Asia and could not wait any longer. Wu Cao said that since Guizhen was not her own daughter, how could she agree to it on her own? She also told Shao that not only did she think the money was too little, but also</p>
<p>Hated Li for Being Old and Ugly, making it difficult to succeed. Shao became furious upon hearing this. On the one hand, he monitored Wu Cao's actions; on the other hand, he reported to the Zhabei Police Station by telephone, falsely claiming that there was a female kidnapper selling people who had been detained at the hospital and requesting that detectives be sent to investigate quickly. The chief immediately ordered detective Chen Yonggui to go to investigate. Shao then pointed out that Wu Cao was the kidnapper. Wu Cao explained the situation in detail. Detective Chen then took Shao and Wu Cao back to the police station together. He then went to Daqing Lane to arrest Xu Chen and an eleven-year-old girl named Xiao Mao, along with Zhang Zhimou. It was also discovered that Xu Chen was suspected of</p>
<p>Trafficking in People. Chen Guizhen and Xiao Mao were not her biological daughters. Guizhen's original surname was Zhang, and her father's name was Zhang Tian. At the age of eleven, she was sold to Xu Chen as a daughter. Xiao Mao was originally from Suzhou and was bought by her parents last winter. Recently, because Guizhen was older and could</p>
<p>Make a Living by Her Talents, and Earned a Lot of Money, she seemed to cherish her very much. However, she still treated Xiao Mao in all sorts of ways, bringing her into the police station, where it was discovered that</p>
<p>The Scars on Her Arms Were Still Fresh. The police chief then ordered detectives to send Xiao Mao to the hospital for treatment. The remaining four men and women were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Xu interrogated them. Ru Baoyi, the lawyer of the police station, stated the circumstances of the arrest and stated that it had not yet been determined whether Shao, Zhang, and Wu Cao had engaged in trafficking. Therefore, they were temporarily not prosecuted, but they should still be detained for detailed investigation. As for Xu Chen's crime of injury, there was considerable evidence, and she was only being prosecuted under Article 294 for now. Other acts also needed to be investigated and determined. Then, Chen Guizhen stated that</p>
<p>She Was Sold by Her Parents in the Past and said that although she went to the New World Hotel on the 15th, she only knew it was for ordinary entertainment and did not know the inside story. When questioned, Shao and Zhang both said that Li wanted to marry a wife, so if the negotiation went well, they would get married according to etiquette. Judge Xu then ordered Shao Yuefeng to post 200 yuan bail, Xu Chen to post 300 yuan bail, and Zhang Zhimou and Wu Cao to be released and await further questioning.</p>

<h3>The North Weijia Section of Shangsong Road Has Been Opened to Traffic</h3>
<p>The Shangsong long-distance bus, starting from the North Bridge Station of the Shanghai-Minhang Road and extending west to the West Gate of Songjiang, has a total length of 30 li. The construction was completed long ago, but the Weijia Bridge at the junction of the two counties of Shangsong is currently under construction. The required vehicles and ticket offices along the way have been prepared one after another. In order to facilitate passengers, Yin Shisheng, the manager of the company, has first trial-operated the section from North Bridge to Weijia Bridge, which was officially opened to traffic the day before yesterday.

<h3>False Real Estate Transaction</h3>
<p>Falsely Claiming to Have More Than 200,000 Yuan Worth of Real Estate</p>
<p>Cheated Out of a Huge Deposit of 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Chen Hegao, a native of Pinghu, who worked as a partner at the Dalong Timber Shop at Wangjia Wharf in the Nanshi area of the Chinese Concession, was 29 years old. On September 15th, he falsely claimed that Zhu Baocheng had more than 200,000 yuan worth of real estate somewhere and fully authorized him to sell it. He then reached an agreement with Lu Jixun, an employee of the Yiyu Yarn Shop at No. 58 Edward Road Yarn Exchange, to pay a deposit of 10,000 taels first. Lu had known Chen for many years and did not suspect anything amiss. He then delivered a Tonghe Bank draft to Chen's timber shop. The receipt had Zhu's seal. The remaining amount was scheduled to be transferred in one month. A week later, Lu could not find Chen to talk to him and became suspicious. He carefully inquired about Zhu's sale of real estate and learned that it was not true. He showed the receipt, which was stamped with a forged seal. Lu was extremely anxious and asked people to look for Chen everywhere, but there was no news. The day before yesterday afternoon, he encountered Chen in a teahouse on Fuzhou Road and twisted him to the Chinese police and took him to the Zhabei Police Station. Chen was willing to reconcile and return the money. Therefore, Lu Yanzhi, a lawyer, filed a criminal lawsuit against Chen in the First Special District Court for fraud. Yesterday morning, he was escorted by the Criminal Third Division. According to the plaintiff, lawyer Jiang, the defendant admitted in the police station that most of the money he had cheated was deposited in banks and money shops. The false receipt was presented for inspection. The defendant's attorney requested that the case be transferred to the Chinese Concession for trial and that bail be granted. Judge Xiao Xiefen verified and briefly spoke to both the plaintiff and defendant, and then ruled that the case was under the wrong jurisdiction and would be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. The defendant was temporarily detained.</p>
<h3>Conviction for Counterfeiting Trademarks</h3>
<p>Gong Qichang, the owner of Qichang Printing Bureau on Haining Road, and Cheng Jiadong, the owner of Xieji Printing Bureau on Arabustro Road, were both sued in the Shanghai First Special District Court by the attorney of the American Ever Ready Battery Company for counterfeiting the Ever Ready brand and the gun brand trademarks of the American Wenjikesi Military Supplies Company. The sentence was announced yesterday morning. Gong Qichang was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for each of the two crimes of counterfeiting trademarks, and fined 400 yuan for each crime, with a total of one year and two months of imprisonment and a fine of 600 yuan. If the fine was commuted to imprisonment, it would be calculated at two yuan per day. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined would be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The counterfeit trademarks and printing plates were confiscated according to regulations, and the lithographic equipment was returned to Cheng Jiadong. Cheng Jiadong was found not guilty.</p>

<h3>Lianfu Real Estate Company Sued for Taking Over a Music Store</h3>
<p>Russian Citizen Unwilling and Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Judgment Transferred to the Second Special District Court</p>
<p>Lianfu Real Estate Company at No. 32 Beijing Road specializes in real estate mortgage and other businesses. The manager is an American, Keayse, and the clerk is Wang Zikang, an accountant in Shanghai. On April of this year, Levin, a Russian citizen, opened the Licordia Music Shop at No. 580 Avenue Joffre. The Recordia Music Shop borrowed 25,000 yuan from Lianfu Company using the store's business property as collateral. The contract stipulated that it would be repaid in installments. However, after the second installment, it was unable to fulfill the contract. On July 9, the business rights of the store were taken over, and a lawsuit was filed in the Second Special District Court for fraud. After several trials, the sentence was scheduled to be announced on the 22nd of this month. Levin filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing accountant Wang Zikang of Lianfu Company of obstructing freedom. Yesterday was the date of the trial. Judge Wu Tingqi of the Criminal Second Division conducted the trial. First, the plaintiff Levin claimed that he borrowed 25,000 yuan from Lianfu in April and paid two installments. There was a slight shortfall, which was offset by installing a wireless radio. On July 9, the music store was suddenly taken over, and he was very unwilling. Therefore, he sued the directors of Lianfu Company and the Chinese manager Wang Zikang. Next, Wang Zikang claimed that he was the secretary of Lianfu Company and that all responsibilities were borne by the American manager Keayse and that he had no relationship with it. His agent, lawyer Ge Zhaoqi, presented the 1931 second half of the year's directory as evidence. The manager of the company, Keayse, claimed that he had filed a lawsuit against Levin in the Special District Court and that the sentence was about to be announced. Wang was an employee of the company and had no responsibility. If Levin thought that Keayse's takeover of the music store for not fulfilling the contract was unreasonable, he could sue Keayse in the American Court. Judge Wu then ruled that the case occurred within the jurisdiction of the Second Special District Court, and that Lianfu Company had sued Vile Levin in that court. There was a relationship between them, and it should be transferred to that court for trial.</p>

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<h3>A Letter from Changchun</h3>
<p>(Readers can at least see a glimpse of the Japanese ambition and cunning) This morning, I had a conversation with a harmonious Japanese person (intellectual class). From his words, I can see the general intention of the Japanese army relying on strength and being unreasonable. Now I will record him below for you to read. Questioner: I, Answerer: Japanese. Question: I would like to ask you to put aside national boundaries, take the qualification of a friend, and make a conversation about the current situation. Is it okay? Answer: What's wrong? Question: Is the dispatch of Japanese troops this time a planned invasion? Answer: There is a plan, and it is a large-scale one. Otherwise, it cannot be called an invasion. Question: How can it not be an invasion to add troops to other people's territory for no reason, kill people, and occupy land? Answer: The independent countries in Asia can be said to be China and Japan. However, China is constantly in internal strife and will not be able to protect itself. If Japan does not come out to protect it, it is feared that it will be eaten away by the European powers. Therefore, it is a duty to be fulfilled. Question: For the sake of coexistence and co-prosperity, it is not a virtue of cooperation to unite against the West. But before the European powers came to divide it, Japan first ate it away. Isn't it too early? And speaking of China itself, being annexed by any country is doomed to destruction. It does not hope that Japan will do this righteous act. Answer: I don't think it's right for Japan to kill Chinese soldiers and civilians. I feel deeply sorry for this. Only Japan has unavoidable difficulties in borrowing Chinese land, because its own territory is small, and the population increases by 900,000 a year, and production cannot offset consumption. In addition, to prevent the Western countries from destroying Asia, it is not enough to defend it without considerable strength. If Japan sits idly by and watches China's self-harm and does not cooperate, China will also feel the chill of its lips being gone. Now that Britain, the United States, and Russia are eyeing it covetously, there is no room for delay. Therefore, it is actively proceeding. Although it seems unreasonable, the Chinese people must also understand it as a matter of survival. Question: What is there to understand when China does not perish to the West but to the East? If you were Chinese, how would you deal with it? He first smiled without answering, and then said, Like you, indignation is inevitable, but there is nothing to do. Question: According to what you said, you are not willing to return the occupied territories. Then why do you declare in the League of Nations that you have no territorial ambitions and that you will withdraw your troops? Isn't it contradictory in words and deeds and putting yourself in a disadvantageous position in the negotiations? Answer: Although there is no territorial ambition, I am afraid that the withdrawal of troops cannot be maintained. Question: If you don't return it, you don't admit the occupation. What do you mean? Answer: The plan is in this place. Japan wants to turn Manchuria and Mongolia (not just what it occupies now) into a big market, where Chinese and Japanese people live together, and no warlords who are angry about causing trouble are allowed to live outside the police and gendarmerie. Also, don't mark it as China's or Japan's. Question: Manchuria and Mongolia are connected to Russia. Can he acquiesce? Answer: If he provokes, there will inevitably be a war. Question: Will the transfer of power in Northeast China and the declarations of independence everywhere be useful propaganda? Answer: It is definitely not propaganda. It is the guidance of the Japanese side. In the progress of the plan, making the places independent is to automatically break away from the entanglement of the Southern Government. Then it is bound to combine small pieces into a whole, select a scholar, and preside over everything. If someone comes to bully him, the Japanese army will naturally protect him. Question: What if the Chinese government comes to punish him? Answer: Treat it as bullying and Japan will protect it with all its strength. Question: If another country swallows him, and China takes the same means of protection, how will Japan deal with it? Answer: The central government is taking care of itself, so how can it have the strength to interfere in other people's business? Question: Chinese public opinion is extremely激昂. If Japan does not let go, I am afraid that there will be a war. Answer: That is definitely not the blessing of China and Japan. However, if issues such as railways, commercial leases, and the Manchurian-Mongolian pending cases can be resolved satisfactorily, the situation will change.

<h3>It's Not Difficult to Boycott Japanese Goods (From "China Rest")</h3>
<p>As long as there are practical methods (3)</p>
<p>The entire academic and industrial sectors should rise up.</p>
<p>(10) What should be done with the existing Japanese goods held by the Anti-Japanese Association is a question worth studying. Privately imported Japanese goods should of course be confiscated, because hearing of the boycott, they hurriedly imported Japanese goods before the implementation of inspection, which is most unforgivable and should certainly be treated as privately imported goods. This can be verified by examining bills of lading, purchase orders, and other documents, and by summoning witnesses for interrogation. If these goods are allowed to pass, wouldn't that mean promoting their sales before each boycott of Japanese goods? As for those Japanese goods that were indeed ordered before the boycott, if they are permanently sealed up, the merchants' capital will be completely unrecoverable, which is too great a sacrifice. A more feasible solution is to declare that these Japanese goods will be publicly sold after half a year, (not to stores, but only to private individuals), and allow merchants to use these goods as collateral for loans, so that merchants' losses will have a limit. Why can't the already registered Japanese goods be immediately and unrestrictedly concentrated for sale? If there are 60,000 pieces of a certain Japanese product in stock in Shanghai, and they can be sold out within six months under normal circumstances, if these 60,000 pieces are immediately and unrestrictedly sold by the Anti-Japanese Association, then the consumption of this Japanese product within six months will be the same as before. If the boycott movement ends after six months, wouldn't that be just when the Japanese goods are sold out, and they can import Japanese goods again? In this way, the consumption of Japanese goods will never be interrupted, and domestic and Western goods will never seize the market share of Japanese goods. It can be said that it has no impact on Japanese producers at all. Our goal is to permanently boycott Japanese goods. Under the above assumption, the result of the permanent boycott is that Japanese goods cannot enter the country from now on, and the sales of a certain Japanese product will still be the same as before within six months. However, these are goods that have already been sold to China. After half a year, a certain Japanese product will be completely replaced by domestic goods or goods from other countries. In this way, the unrestricted centralized sale of imported Japanese goods is of course not a problem, but within the scope of not hindering the permanent boycott, we must guard against the possibility of a premature termination. According to my method, a certain Japanese product should be sealed up and not sold for half a year. During this half-year period, the consumption of this Japanese product will be replaced by non-Japanese goods. Even if the boycott ends after half a year and the sealed Japanese goods are taken out for sale, there will still be at least half a year during which there is no need to import Japanese goods. In this way, a certain Japanese product loses half a year of sales, which cannot be compensated. For the same reason, privately imported Japanese goods should be sealed up and not sold, or they can be taken out for sale later, not too late when the boycott actually ends. These private goods must not be burned, as burning them is burning money that China exchanged for things, which has nothing to do with the Japanese. Moreover, if the boycott ends prematurely, the burned Japanese goods will have to be replenished by Japan, which would instead add a sale for Japanese goods. In addition to sealing them up for half a year and then selling them, there is another way to sell the Japanese goods that have been approved for registration, that is, the Anti-Japanese Association can gradually and limitedly sell them. For example, if the inventory that could be sold in one month under normal circumstances is now divided into four months, with one-quarter sold each month, then within these four months, three-quarters of the sales of this Japanese product will be seized by goods from other countries. This loss cannot be compensated even if the boycott ends. This method seems to be a better move than selling after half a year. The merchants' funds will not be stagnant for too long, which is easier to implement. The price of limited and gradual sales can be increased as much as possible because the goods are in short supply (to the extent of selling one-quarter of the usual sales volume). The surplus profit exceeding the normal price can be used as funds for the anti-Japanese movement. The confiscated Japanese goods can also be sold using this method, but it is always best not to sell them. (11) Not buying Japanese goods is nothing more than a means of retaliation, to make Japanese producers suffer a great loss. Conversely, wouldn't not selling things to Japan cause losses to Chinese producers? Wouldn't it be helping the Japanese boycott Chinese goods? Some people may think that most of the goods shipped from China to Japan are raw materials, and cutting off the source could also give the Japanese production sector a big blow. However, there is more than one kind of raw material. Some can only be supplied by China, while others can be obtained from other countries at prices that are not much more expensive. Not selling Chinese raw materials to Japan would only expand the sales of goods from other countries. Therefore, even if we don't supply raw materials to Japan, we have to distinguish between them. There is even less reason not to sell consumer goods to Japan. Which raw materials can be sold to Japan, and which raw materials are indispensable and must be imported from Japan? These all require expert investigation and research.</p>
<p>Can students and workers still stand idly by? Throughout history, this boycott of Japanese goods has been the most well-organized, because it was initiated by merchants voluntarily, and the methods are also more precise than before. With good organization and good methods, coupled with such high public sentiment, all sectors of the country should strive to rise up and make this boycott movement unprecedentedly successful, so that the Japanese will never dare to underestimate our movement to boycott their goods. In this boycott, the academic and industrial sectors seem to be silent and inactive, as if everything is being handled by merchants and has nothing to do with us. What a huge undertaking a boycott is! How can it be handled by a few merchants? The plans formulated by merchants and passed in resolutions will be nothing more than waste paper if they are not backed by the strength of the masses to enforce them. The work of inspection, the work of supervision, and the work of dealing with unscrupulous merchants all require our students and workers to actively participate, using a military-style deployment to carry out the work of the boycott. Instead of holding meetings to promote and conduct unarmed military training, students should use this time and energy to conduct large-scale inspections of stores throughout the city, and to distribute leaflets identifying Japanese goods to every household, and to persuade householders to swear not to buy Japanese goods. If the Chinese nation still has any sense of shame and does not want to succumb silently to the Japanese tyranny, this boycott movement must not be allowed to fail. Students across the country, workers across the country, where is the spirit of the May Fourth Movement? Where is the spirit of the May Thirtieth Movement? Everyone rise up together!</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Having read in your newspaper's local news column a report on the liquidation of the He Yixiang creditor group, which mentioned that one of the shareholders was Xue Zibin, I hereby state that my involvement with He Yixiang as a partner was before 1929. I held 500 taels of shares in that company. Subsequently, on January 1, 1930, at the conclusion of the 1929 annual accounts, I immediately requested to withdraw my shares due to the company's poor business performance. This was approved by Guan Dierong, the major shareholder and general manager, who calculated the full amount clearly. Mr. Guan personally wrote and signed a document acknowledging my withdrawal of shares and a list of the amount, which I hold as evidence. Therefore, He Yixiang's profits and losses after January 1, 1930, have absolutely nothing to do with me. The report in the newspaper is inconsistent with the facts. I am writing to request a correction to clarify the facts. Respectfully, Xue Zibin. October 17, 1931. Addressed to the editors of Shen Bao.</p>

<h3>Heartbreaking Words</h3>
<p>— Cuckoo</p>
<p>Beloved compatriots, the administrative meeting of the League of Nations, in order to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue, invited the United States to participate and express its views. This is a very ordinary thing. As long as one's heart is honest and one's behavior is proper, then anyone can participate and judge. What is there to be afraid of? What is there to be concerned about? Unexpectedly, the Japanese side used all its strength to stubbornly oppose it. This is truly like a thief with a guilty conscience, who gets scared and hides at the sight of the police and detectives. However, as a result, all members of the League of Nations agreed to the United States joining, with as many as thirteen votes in favor. The number thirteen is considered unlucky in the West, but this time it dealt a blow to the violent Japanese. From now on, we will consider it to be very auspicious.</p>

<h3>My Little Ambition</h3>
<p>On January 1, 1925, I settled my life's old accounts and asked myself, "What are your ambitions?" I then wrote a few lines of poetry to answer myself, entitled "My Little Ambition." Today, I took this mirror and looked at it, and I am still the same! Is it a lack of progress? Or a firm will? How can I tell! The poem I wrote that day was:</p>
<p>"Thoughts and resentments come by chance;</p>
<p>Praise and criticism are mostly unexpected.</p>
<p>Turning hands make clouds, covering hands make rain,</p>
<p>Friends, I will not betray."</p>
<p>My friend, Chaoxin, teased me after reading the first stanza: "Is what you cherish in your heart the jade of Bian He? Or is it Jia Baoyu's psychic jade that he was born with?" I said, "You can guess as you please!"</p>
<h3>Remembering the Battle of Pyongyang in the Year of Jiawu (1894)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shoukang</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. The initial point of contact was in Asan, Korea. Our army then retreated to Pyongyang. The bloody battle of Pyongyang was enough to chill the enemy's courage. It is a pity that in the end, due to running out of ammunition and no reinforcements, the city was surrounded and the army disbanded. Yizhou was also defended. The enemy then drove straight through Phoenix City and penetrated deep into the national territory, eventually leading to an alliance made under the city. How painful! Senior Wang Gong personally went to Pyongyang and participated in the military affairs of General Ye, and he told me the painful history very accurately. I will record it as follows.</p>
<p>According to the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Jiashen, neither country was allowed to station troops in Korea. In July of Jiawu (1894), Zhili Governor-General Ye Zhichao was ordered to take three battalions of troops to Asan to quell the internal rebellion in Korea. The conflict then began. In an emergency, the Qing court hired the Taikoo steamship Gao Sheng to carry three battalions of Ming's army (the former troops of Liu Mingchuan) to reinforce. Unexpectedly, as soon as it arrived at Asan, it was sunk. The entire army was lost. At the same time, the Japanese army attacked with 20,000 troops. Ye knew that he was no match and retreated his entire army to Pyongyang. The Qing court considered that Ye's isolated army in Asan was able to preserve its forces, and that the merits and demerits were enough to offset each other. He was appointed as the commander of all the front-line troops and ordered to repay the favor. There were 18 battalions of Wei Rugui's Huai army, 5 battalions of Zuo Baogui's Feng army, 3 battalions of Ma Yukun's Yi army, and 3 battalions of Feng Sheng'a's Qi army, totaling more than 40 battalions. With the military strength strengthened, they vowed to fight to the death. There was a very dangerous mountain outside the city of Pyongyang. Hong Shuzu advocated defending the mountain and not the city, while Zuo Baogui insisted on defending the city and not the mountain. By the beginning of August, our army's retreat route was cut off and communications were blocked. From the 11th, the two sides exchanged artillery fire from a distance. Our army held firm and did not come out. The enemy also did not detect our side's reality and did not dare to go deep. On the Mid-Autumn Festival night, the moon was cold and the wind was bleak. Wei Rugui volunteered to take charge of the front line, and Ma Yukun was in charge of responding. He encouraged his subordinates to fight to the death. Wei, bare-chested, held a command knife and galloped wildly, leading the soldiers. The morale was greatly boosted, and everyone was determined to fight with one</p>
<h3>World News in Brief</h3>
<p>Using Poison Gas for Execution: The United States was the first country to use the electric chair to execute criminals sentenced to death forty years ago. It can be regarded as the most humane instrument of execution in the world. Later, many civilized countries adopted this electric chair. However, in a recent instance, the United States created a new method of execution. They dealt with a criminal convicted of murder and sentenced to death by the court. This time, they did not use the electric chair, but used poison gas. The location was in Nevada. If this poison gas execution method becomes popular around the world in the future, then Nevada will be the place of origin. During the execution, the prisoner is confined in a tightly sealed room, so that air cannot enter. Next to him is a bucket of hydrochloric acid and water mixture. Then, fifteen egg-shaped potassium cyanide are dropped in, producing hydrocyanic acid, which is the so-called poison gas. As soon as the prisoner smells the poisonous gas, he immediately loses consciousness and dies peacefully without any pain, which is more humane than death by electric chair. Poison gas was originally one of the killing weapons in the European war. Unexpectedly, it has now become an instrument of execution.</p>
<p>heart. The Japanese army almost suspected that Liu Yongfu of the Black Flag Army was on the front line. Although our army won this battle, many of its elite troops were lost. The Japanese were cunning. On the morning of the 16th, surprise troops suddenly attacked Pyongyang. Zuo Baogui, dressed in his official robes, ascended the city to supervise the battle. He happened to be the target of enemy artillery and died for his country. The defending troops were completely defeated. Wei heard the alarm and led his troops back to disturb, but it was too late. On that day, Pyongyang fell. Afterwards, Wei was impeached for deducting military pay and executed for retreating during the battle. It is said that whether Wei deducted military pay or not will not be discussed here for the time being. As for saying that he retreated during the battle, Wei was a man of iron and blood and had never resisted the Japanese. (Move to Charitable Assistance for Disaster Relief)</p>
<h3>Jotting</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Amidst the national crisis, I increasingly feel the importance of the duties of our diplomatic envoys abroad. Although it is said that weak countries have no diplomacy, human effort is the deciding factor, and this is definitely not a fixed rule. If those who hold important diplomatic positions have cultivated diplomatic knowledge, vision, and魄力 throughout their lives, then when an unexpected event occurs, they can always weigh the situation rationally, negotiate, and strive to obtain international sympathy, understanding, and assistance. Conversely, if those who lack diplomatic knowledge, do not understand the international situation, and do not even understand the language, writing, customs, and local conditions of the host country are just filling a position, how can they represent the country and assume arduous responsibilities? There is no standard for the government's appointment of officials. This may be tolerable internally, but doing so externally is simply surrendering the country's dignity and the personality of the nation! For example, our relationship with Germany and France is so close, how can we lightly attempt to send people without certainty? I earnestly hope that the government will take the overall situation into consideration and appoint wise and capable people to live up to the expectations of the public!</p>
<h3>The Japanese Plundered the Ancient Bell of Hanshan Temple</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>My Wu has beautiful water and land, and especially many scenic spots. Hanshan Temple is one of them. The temple is located in Fengqiao Town, about seven or eight miles from the city. There is a road that can be used to reach it. It was built during the Liang Dynasty and was named Miaoli Puming Chan Temple. After the Tang Dynasty, it was called Hanshan Temple, because Hanshan and Shide once stayed here. It was rebuilt in the Shaoxing period of the Song Dynasty. It was repeatedly repaired and collapsed during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It was destroyed by war during the Xianfeng period. In the Bingwu year of the Guangxu period, Chen Kuilong, the governor of Wu, planned to restore it. In the Gengxu year of the Xuantong period, Cheng Xuelou continued to repair it. The scale was grand and it was completely new. However, it was criticized for having a slight European influence and losing its ancient charm. The Japanese love to recite Tang poems from our country. When reciting Zhang Ji's "The moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky," they are fascinated by it. Therefore, coming to Wu, they must visit Hanshan Temple. Steamships are often parked there, as they are accustomed to it. Some have changed the last line of Zhang Ji's poem to "The midnight bell rings to the steamship," which is inevitably mocking and abusive. The temple bell is made of bronze, and it is an ancient object of a thousand years, which is extraordinarily precious. The Japanese covet it. They secretly cast a new bell to replace it. The officials and people did not hear of it. They allowed it to be taken away, as if it were a worthless object that could be discarded without regret. This is truly a strange thing. Now, the Japanese are making progress step by step. They take over the territory at will. They slaughter the people at will. Everything is entrusted to the doctrine of non-resistance. A small ancient bell is even less of a concern. I will tell this to the visitors, so that they will know what to sigh about.</p>
<h3>A Startling Statistic</h3>
<p>— He Pengfei</p>
<p>Statistics on the total amount of educational expenditure by the Japanese nationwide in one year. The total amount of educational expenditure by the Japanese central and local governments from April 1928 to March 1929 was approximately 536,471,000 Japanese yen. For such a small country, the fact that it spent such a large amount of educational expenses in one year is quite startling.</p>
<p>The amount of money spent by the state per year, per student for different Japanese schools:</p>
<p>Elementary school students: 34 yen</p>
<p>Female students: 81 yen</p>
<p>Middle school students: 105 yen</p>
<p>Vocational school students: 307 yen</p>
<p>University students: 1,653 yen</p>
<p>The total educational expenses borne by the national or local government for a student graduating from elementary school after six years is approximately 200 yen. For female school graduates, it is approximately 609 yen. For middle school graduates, it is approximately 730 yen. For vocational school graduates, it is approximately 1,650 yen. For university graduates, it is approximately 6,500 yen. From this, it can be seen that the development of Japanese education is something that our country should be ashamed of.

<h3>The Pestle for Knocking Dreams (16)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>"Where does this dream come from? Some long-distance race, my own lame wife lagging behind: some mechanical engineering doctorate chatting with me, I turned into an outsider who doesn't understand anything: it turned out that there was no such thing, it was just a dream! Okay! Okay! Now the dream is awake! I am still a top scholar who is more than enough to secure the country: my wife is still the most slender-footed beauty in the world."</p>
<p>"Master, what did you dream about?" Tang Xiuying, who shared the same bed, smiled charmingly while questioning, and pressed a slender foot wearing red silk slippers, which possessed the highest honor in the world, lightly onto Tao Chi's abdomen.</p>
<p>"Madam, hey!" Tao Chi called out madam, just about to tell her about the dream; suddenly, a beam of light from a searchlight in the dark sea of his mind! In this light, he saw the shadow of himself talking with the elder in the Wude Hermitage; therefore, this "hey" sound burst out into a cry of surprise.</p>
<p>"Master, why did you call out hey, hey about what?" When Tang Xiuying asked, she nestled her pink cheeks against Tao Chi's face, and hooked Tao Chi's thigh with her slender feet.</p>
<p>The searchlight in the dark sea of his mind was flashing faster and faster, about to pass! If he didn't struggle, Tao Chi would forever sink in the past's black sea!</p>
<p>"Elder of Wuan Hermitage, quickly save me!" Tao Chi couldn't help but cry out.</p>
<p>The effect of this cry was great, awakening the twenty-first-century brain itself! Everything in the past era became a bubble, leaving only himself sitting on the revolving chair, facing a wise elder.</p>
<p>"Layman, you have personally experienced the past world, what are your thoughts?"</p>
<p>"Old monk, I am enlightened; the weak China was probably created by the past era."</p>
<p>"You said you were a peaceful person" "This place is fun, I don't miss Shu;" why did you miss the old monk and cry for help?"</p>
<p>"Old monk, don't say it; thanks to my one spirit not being deceived, I was able to escape from the past, the factory that manufactures weak</p>
<p>country! Old monk, what time is it now? I feel that this experience has been very long, probably three to five years."</p>
<p>"Layman, if you want to know what time it is, don't ask the old monk, just look at the taro in the plate."</p>
<p>Tao Chi left the revolving chair, returned to his original seat, and looked at the taro in the plate, still steaming hot; then he knew that the three to five years on the revolving chair was just a moment in the Zen room!</p>

<h3>The Situation of Gold Speculation Is Peaceful</h3>
<p>Continued Decline by One or Two Taels: Yesterday, the price of gold speculation initially weakened and then stabilized, without any significant changes. It only fluctuated by two or three taels, and the situation was stable. People's hearts were steady. In the end, it continued to fall by one or two taels and zero cents. Although there were no wholesale transactions on the table, there seemed to be more demand. As for the silver market, it turned upward. At the beginning, it was quite stretched, and it once broke into 690 taels. Later, buyers were still diligent and offered a longer term exchange rate. However, the internal market was stable, especially because the European market was overtly firm and covertly soft. Citibank sold some silver bars, so it rebounded by five or six taels. It tended to be flat at noon, at zero to ninety-three taels. The market closed on Saturday, recalling the situation from the previous week, where it had almost become a fluctuating situation. The minimum price was only seen at 682 taels and 3 qian, and the maximum had reached 707 taels. Overall, it rose by about ten taels.</p>
<p>Yesterday started with weakness and continued with a flat trend. The opening price yesterday morning fell by 4.8 taels, totaling 689 taels. The major silver bar rose again by 3/8 to 5/16, and the landed market was still good. It was purchased by firms like Xie Xing, Yong Ri Chang, Yu Da, Shun Li, Qian Chang Xiang, and Tong Tai Chang. Within a few minutes, it was raised to 93 taels. After that, there were fluctuations of 2.5 taels. At 9:15, it was learned that firms like Xian Ling were planning to extend the term, so it fell back by 3 taels, totaling 90 taels. However, the US dollar was not loose or excessive. Banks such as Ying and Ri did deals of 32.75 yuan for November and December. The price returned up 2 taels. The announced rise in the British pound was indeed 25, but the US dollar only rose by 375, so the market was not affected. At 9:30, it was 91.5 to 93.5 taels. Later, as many parties slightly sold off, the market shrank by 2 taels, and the price was 91.5 taels at 10:00. At this time, HSBC absorbed 18.125 British pounds for February, which was sold by Mitsui. Also, banks such as Dongya absorbed US dollars for January at 32.75 yuan, and Yuan Mao, Yong Zhi, Feng, Yong Yuan, Tai, Fu, and Tai Heng all bought in. Yuan Heng also bought in a lot, so the price rebounded by more than 3 taels. At 10:20, it was 95 taels. Yu Da, Bing Xing, and others sold out at this time, and the price immediately fell back by 2.67 qian, totaling 2.3 qian at 10:45. Later, Guang Bang settled in US dollars at 32.625 yuan, and Mai Hang bought 6875 and sold it to Mitsui at 625. Then, at 11:15, it was 95 taels again. Unexpectedly, Tong Tai Chang and others came to sell, and Mitsui sold 18.125 British pounds, and China Bank exchanged one or two yuan for the long term. After 20 minutes, the price retreated by 2.78 qian, totaling 92.2 qian. There was then a slight fluctuation of one or two taels. There were not many transactions on the table, mostly scalping. The exchange market was also flat, and the US dollar could be settled at 32.625 yuan. Almost 6875 yuan was done for January. At noon, it had reached 92.8 qian, but the Indian exchange reported 8 anna, so it was not affected. By the close, it was 92.5 qian, and another 3 taels were traded outside of the market. The imported goods were cheaper than the day before (according to the listed price) by 1.3 qian.</p>
<p>The current surcharge is up by 15 taels: The maximum price in half a day was 95 taels, and the minimum was 89 taels, with a total of 6 taels of review. The goods opened at 90 taels in the morning and closed at 3.5 qian at noon. The listed price was changed to 7578 taels, totaling 645 to 623 taels. The closing price was 65 taels, and the registered water replenishment was 93 taels. The current spot bar is surcharged by 15 taels.</p>
<p>No large transactions: According to the statistics of transactions on the table, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Heng, Shun Li, Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Tai, Yi Feng, Ri Chang, and Xie Xing Yong all bought in. Zhi Feng Yong, Yu Da, Wan Xing, Fu Chang, and others had very troublesome receipts and disbursements. Da De Cheng, Bing Xing, Yuan Xing Yong, and Tong Tai Chang bought in less and sold more. Speculator Wu bought in slightly to resist the short. Yuan Mao Yong bought in and then sold out again. Da Lian Bang sold 400 and bought 500 bars. Guang Bang bought in a small amount.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Market Has Loosened, Darkened, and Levelled Out</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver markets for British, American, and Indian currencies all rebounded, the market levelled, and exchange rates fell. The Shanghai HSBC listing almost loosened by one level. British gold increased by 0.25, to 1 shilling 7.75 pence. American gold increased by 0.375, to 31.875 yuan. Hong Kong dollars did not change, remaining at 78.125 taels. German exchange remained at 137 marks, and other currencies followed suit. As for the domestic market, it initially loosened and then levelled out.

The October futures generally continued to level. Large traders in the market still did not have huge inflows and outflows. There were still many types of spot opened, but they continued to only have scattered transactions. Checking the trend of various bond prices, its change still took the diplomatic situation as the background. Currently, large traders in the market all hold a wait-and-see attitude. General scattered investments and sales transactions both took whether the diplomatic situation was optimistic or not as a transfer. Yesterday, when it opened in the early morning, the diplomatic news said that our country was benefiting. The League of Nations was able to disregard Japan's opposition and resolutely invite the United States to attend. The international situation suddenly changed from the previous week. Because of this, general public sentiment was more optimistic. Selling was very clear. The buyers scattered receiving was quite active. All prices achieved a consistent rebound compared to the previous day. Various adulterations rose by one or two yuan or so. The second session once slightly weakened. The trend was still peaceful. The later market situation was still good. Since the diplomatic process was particularly good, and the country's unified peace was seen approaching more and more, the ring of elephants situation was very optimistic. Therefore, scattered investment by buyers was more enthusiastic than before, and the price then continued to rise compared to the morning. As a result, unified tax and salt tax both rose by 2.78 yuan compared to the previous day. Others also rose by 1.5 to 2 yuan and some corners. Observing the securities market, although the future will still depend on diplomatic developments to transfer more, its situation is indeed slightly more turning point than before.

<p>Yarn and Cotton: This Month's Yarn Shows Signs of a Squeeze</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation feels quite tense because this month is exposed to a squeeze. It is predicted that spot yarn on the market that can be transferred and delivered is rare. At the same time, it is heard that the Guangdong firms will have a need for a large amount of spot yarn, and people are even more afraid. Short positions are urgently covered. The October futures peak at 164 taels and 3 mace. Optimists are still bullish. Although the far months are rising, their momentum seems relaxed, probably because there is a lack of major buyers.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Squeeze: 16 count human standard, because the short positions in this month are being squeezed, the remaining months also feel like an auspicious time. As a result, there is considerable progress in all months. The prices of each month are as follows:</p>

Because inventory is not thick, the intention to sell is waning, and the situation is stable. The total daily transaction statistics for all firms are over 1,000 bales. The selling prices are level.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Standard Short Positions Covered</h3>
<p>The cotton market situation has slightly improved. American cotton news has turned better. The yarn market is firm. Slightly promotes short covering. However, the industry does not have an optimistic attitude because of the decline in the source and the scarcity of inventory. It is expected that manufacturers will still not forget the cheap price of foreign cotton, and will move to buy local cotton. The output from various producing areas is still scarce, and the receiving prices are still high. It is heard that American firms such as Mei An in this port will have 150,000 bales of American cotton arriving in Shanghai within the next week. However, these are all orders from various factories, and the floating amount is limited.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Shows Slight Improvement Last Week</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 16th reported on the cotton market for the past week, saying that the cotton market last week was prompted by President Hoover's loan suggestion, which aroused hope. It was even more aided by the Federation of New Orleans Bureau of Agricultural Economics members and the meeting of Southern banks, managing raw cotton methods. According to its resolution plan, approximately 6.8 million bales of cotton will definitely not be sold until the price reaches 12.5 cents, and will be hoarded until the end of this season. The rise in prices is limited to the downward value of Southern hedgers and buyers, and is constrained. At the beginning of the week, the weather was not good, with storms and rain in the west, but it then turned better. There are quite a few people who intend to make hoarding investments, but it is still uncertain whether the increased supply has sufficient absorption. The demand from agents has widened, and the Far East is purchasing in huge quantities. Local industry is also paying close attention to the Manchurian Incident.</p>
