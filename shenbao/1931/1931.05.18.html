<h3>蔣主席之演詞</h3>
<p>（南京）　蔣主席在國民會議閉會日致詞、原文如下、</p>
<p>國民會議此次集會首都、先後十有二日、與會諸代表旣以莊肅熱烈之誠意、表示全國國民一致接受總理之遺敎、復以周詳之討論、制定訓政時期之約法、議决關於經濟敎育外交等各要案、而示今後建國圖治之方針、諸代表任會議時期中之辛勞、不僅無負各地同胞之付託、亦且對於整個國家克盡其應有之使命、茲當會議告終之頃、中正敢代表國民政府再致鄭重之敬意、</p>
<p>國民會議之目的、在謀中國之統一與建設、其性質旣與尋常集會不同、故其所議决者條目至簡要、而成就之也則至爲艱鉅、此等决議案之能否實現、不僅爲尋常實際之工作則爲建國、執斤運石、邪許同聲、非全體一致各獻其長於工程之總計劃、則偉大閎實之建築不能平地湧現、而吾人皆將無所庇風雨、故確認統一與建設之需要爲一事、辨明統一與建設必由毁譽榮辱之問題、而實爲國家民族生死興亡之所繫、在鞏固統一與完成建設之二大原則下、圖存救亡、政府與國民實有同等之職責而不能别其熟爲重輕、中國今日在政治推進之階段上曰訓政、而其何道以求得之又爲一事、接受總理之遺敎固重要、接受而以全力奉行之尤爲重要、於此中正又敢以十分之誠懇、對於行將言旋之吾全體代表、貢獻下列之各點、願懇切開陳於各地交老昆季之前而</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>蘄求一致之努力、</p>
<p>一曰鞏固統一與尊崇法治欲求統一之鞏固、當於民主與法治植其基礎、必以民主之精神爲統一之精神而後統一乃爲澈底、必以法治之軌範爲統一之軌範而後統一之效可久、統一之重要、不待煩言、苟以國家建設譬之於建築工事、則統一者基基址也、無基址即無建築、非統一則不能建設、然統一云者、非僅削平反側之謂、亦非僅統一行政事權之謂、眞正之統一、要當植基於全體之國民、誠以統一非單一之謂、必匯合衆流以歸趨於共同而後統一之力量乃生、然欲就衆異以求其共同、則又必須有共循之軌範、此中正之所以主張由國民會議制定約法以資共守也、總理重要之遺敎、其精神悉已包容於約法之中、今後全國同胞祗須以全力維護約法之尊嚴、則統一之基礎自固、唯頒法爲一事、行法又爲一事、我國從來守法尊法之習慣、較爲缺乏、民主與自由之、意義常被誤解、致受一盤散沙之譏、以貽國家危亂之禍、是則法治精神之培養、又爲訓政工作之要件、必使法律有效、而後國家乃可久安、建設方得實現、在積極方面、凡法律所規定其應爲者、必須各盡其事而不可放棄職責、在消極方面、凡法律所限制其不應爲者必須絶對遵守而不可絲毫畔越、今後全國國民以至政府官吏與軍人、必須皆知守法爲立國立已立人之要則、不可再蹈放縱恣肆之錯誤、以陷國家於凌亂不安、無法律即無自由、皮之不存、毛將將安附、此爲吾全國同胞所應共勉、而在敎育方面亦應以嚴格的規律、生活之培養、造成國民崇法守紀之精神、則民權主義乃得以充分實現、而憲政亦克早見其完成、</p>
<p>二曰確認民生爲建國之首要依照總理之遺敎、討論民生問題爲國民會議重要之任務、政府此次鄭重提出實業建設程序案、與敎育設施趨向之注重生産化職業化、以及約法國民生計章之規定、皆以此旨爲中心、中國今日陷於國貧民困之狀態、必須在經濟上有自給自足之能力而後方可言實現民族之獨立、亦唯國家在經濟上有自給自足之能力而後國民方有均給均足之享受、故增加生産實爲實行三民主義之根本、代表諸君子回歸之後、希望特别闡述此義於國民、農民能每年增加一斗之農産、工人能每日多作一小時之工作、即國家與民族可少受一分外國經濟力之壓迫、故國民必以游惰爲可恥、以勞動爲可貴、而後可以自存、可以救國、民生主義方得實現而民族亦始可遂其生存、</p>
<p>三曰培養民族之毅力不平等條約之束縛、國民旣已加以一致之否認、中國在國際之完全平等與自由、政府自當本其固有職權、必期其實現、唯於此有更願吾國民痛切認識者、國家完全平等自由之獲得、必以實現民族的獨立爲主要關鍵、苟民族之經濟力與自衞力未能達到獨立與充實之地步、則國際的平等與自由、託基猶極縹渺、故吾國民必須力屏虚矯之惡習、恢復民族的自信、涵養剛毅忍耐之德性、日夕不忘於雪恥圖存之工作、中正敢言以吾四萬萬優秀之民族、果能一德一心、刻苦黽勉、實行三年生聚三年敎訓之决心、則不惟國家與民族達到完全獨立與自由、决非難事、且必能以三民主義之成功、植世界大同之基礎、此中正所灼然自信、尤願吾全國同胞之同具此自信心也、</p>
<p>四曰推進敎育設施　敎育爲立國之基礎、訓政時期之敎育、量的增進與質的改善、應同時並顧、關於敎育普及、中央及地方均當視爲首要之急務、而尤當恢復三十年前學校初興時代之精神、由各地人士引興辦敎育爲自身應盡之義務、而後經濟與師資之困難、方有適當之解决、一方面質的改善、同爲重要、過去敎育之不良、國家與人民已交受其敝、今後敎育設施、務須依照中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方針之規定、與夫此次會議通過敎育設施趨向案之原則、特别注重於固有德性之培養、强健體魄之鍜鍊、與夫近世科學之灌輸、蓋非培養吾民族固有優美之德性、不足以奠民族獨立之根本、非提倡體育以增進民族之健康、不足以保障民族之生存、而非注重於科學之灌輸、則國民生産能力與生活技能、無由增進、而違反科學精神之傳統惡習、亦將無由更革也、</p>
<p>五曰安定地方秩序目前國家之大患爲地方秩序之不寗、政府對於剿除匪患之未盡、實深引爲疚責而當督率負責者以努力、唯地方秩序之安定、尤賴當地人士之協力自謀、更能事半而功倍、故興辦保甲、清查戶口、緝除匪類、充實人民自衞之能力與組織、改革人民不良之嗜好與習慣、各地人士均當效法前賢舉辦鄉約之精神、各有盡瘁鄉里之努力、而後社會之秩序必日見安寗、國家之元氣乃可恢復其旺盛、近年可憂之現象、尤在各地優秀人士之羣去其鄉、鄉村空虚之結果、必致庶事不舉而基礎日隳、此尤社會之隱憂、所當努力以挽回之者也、</p>
<p>六曰完成地方自治　建國工作以地方自治爲根本、此爲總理特具之灼見、吾人旣已接受總理遺敎而努力奉行、則今後工作、即應以建國大綱爲人人必備之課本、而於其第八條所規定之調查戶口、丈量土地、辦理警衞、修築道路四者、尤當以加倍之努力、盡量促成、蓋憲政開始時期之到達、依於省縣自治建設成績之如何、訓政六年、時限至促、吾人正須以團體競賽之精神、各自爲奮迅之前進、甚望諸代表加緊倡導、與各地同胞相互策勵、省達於縣、縣達於鄉、父詔兄勉、一致爲地方自治之促進、此爲國家建設之最基本的要件、三民主義之實現、將視此爲關鍵、蓋必自治事業一一興辦、而後四種政權之使用、方得歸着於具體之事實而不流於空虚、</p>
<p>救國建國、端緒繁多、所欲與代表諸君子言之而希望由諸君子以達於全體同胞者、右之數端、未爲能盡、唯是此次國民會議之後、國家之政治已入一新階級、總理昔日在北上宣言中說明國民會議之意義、諄諄以國民自决其命運自擇其需要爲言、而歸結於國民之覺悟與奮鬥、自今以往、國家之建設與復興、旣已共定必循之步驟、揆諸知難行易之訓、唯在吾國民之艱苦力行、語有之、作始也簡、將畢也鉅、數載以來、國事之艱危至矣、而民族内在之生氣、則常蓬勃發露而不可掩、由磨厲而進光明、從奮鬥以求生路、此爲今日國民共有之職責、而代表諸君子所尤當珍重前以期共勉者、蓋國民會議以前、革命成敗之責任、在於國民政府之能否領導國民而指示其應循之道路、國民會議以後、革命成敗之責任、乃在全國國民之本身、全國國民能否盡其最後之努力並督促政府完成訓政之大業、此國民革命成敗之所繫、亦中國興亡所由判也、（十七日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>歐聨委員會論戰開始</h3>
<p>歐洲各國自大戰後。以國會議員大都非經濟專門人材。不足以解决經濟之難局。於是各搜羅其所謂經濟專家。創設經濟會議。以圖解决一國之經濟問題。德國努力於此而英法意等國亦相繼爲是項之組織。宜若其國内經濟狀况。必能達於整理完美之境。然而觀察目前狀態。各國之經濟。皆有不能支持之勢。可見整理一國之經濟。猶且不易。况乎今日欲進而解决全世界經濟之難局乎。試觀日内瓦歐聨委員會開會之初。德法兩外長。對於税約劈頭論戰。暢發其意見之後。復寄其希望於歐洲經濟之重造。而意外長則陳述解决歐洲經濟危局之不易。並引以前不魯塞爾日奴亞羅馬日内瓦之各種經濟會議毫無成績爲證。末復伸明一己之主張謂各國固宜締結一國際通力合作之議定書。惟仍須各保留依其本國需要與他國直接談判條約之權。其言固甚圓融而巧妙。但其經濟合作難成之意。亦已顯然矣。吾人觀察歐局大勢。德奥税約。誠爲經濟合作之第一大障。碍而其唯一要點。仍慮牽涉政事與軍事。且德奥税約之外。尚有賠欵等問題相逼而來。國内專家之所研求而討論者。大抵爲自身利益之成分多。今各以其主張貢獻於國際間之會議。勢已捍格而不入。又加以外交政治家意見之紛歧。欲求合作成功以挽此經濟危局。豈易言哉。</p>

<h3>鳴槍起步</h3>
<p>昨晨六時起、卡德路靜安寺口、觀者已絡續而來、七時半已擁擠不堪、中西警探、及童子軍、往來維持秩序、鐘鳴八下、賽員齊集、依號碼四十人一排、發令員下令整備、白線一鬆、槍聲起處、五百餘條健腿、飛步向前、浩浩蕩蕩、排山倒海、直向靜安寺路進發、</p>
<h3>沿途狀况</h3>
<p>靜安寺前齊驅並進</p>
<p>出發後十餘分鐘、大隊人馬、已至靜安寺前、精神皆飽满異常、此追彼隨、相離俱不甚遠、爲首三人爲石金生謝行導張全洲、並駕齊驅、同行前進、距離數步、劉祥堃王兆祥張兆海緊緊跟隨、侯根仁丁杏根及以後二百三十餘人作長蛇陣依次而進、</p>
<p>兆豐花園虎躍龍騰</p>
<p>折人極司菲而路、行來已至兆豐花園門前、途程二英里矣、八點二十六分、石金生已首先過去、張全洲雖不肯放鬆、有若拚命、已漸漸落後、老將謝行導劉祥堃飛步向前、均趕出張上、石在謝前約八十米、劉則後二十米、張全洲王兆祥只能追隨、程宣侯根仁珊珊而來、其後則爲凌寳榮劉善富楊俊王世棣張兆海蔣履春韋開金陳連捷黄雄福張顯崙周鶴鳴等、</p>
<p>步履維艱健兒叫苦</p>
<p>過兆豐花園、已見滬杭鐵道、沿鐵道爲凱旋路、泥地高低不平、低則如深窪、高則若土墩、車行甚顚、遑論步行矣、競賽員雖未出聲、均已呌苦、入敦信路、漸漸平坦、</p>
<p>一半途程老將放步</p>
<p>由敦信路過哥倫比亞路安和寺路、再入凱旋路爲一半途程、計六英里、其時八點五十三分、石金生首先到達、謝行導已相距約二百五十米、又二百米爲劉祥堃、又一百五十米爲張全洲、其後爲程宣劉善富王兆祥侯根仁蔣履春楊俊凌鵬凌寳榮馮子能唐欣輩、</p>
<p>交通大學蛟龍昻首</p>

<p>福履理路空氣緊張</p>
<p>過貝當路、遥遥福履理路在前矣、路程爲十英里離終點僅六分之一矣、爲山九仞、胥在於此、變化漸起、空氣頓形緊張、石金生於九時三十分過十里旗、謝行導加緊脚步、與石相差僅百米、劉祥堃反見落後、程宣已在前、而凌寳榮接連超過四人、突居競賽組最前矣、時間爲九點三十七分、共後人員如下、張全洲、凌鵬、劉善富三人並進、楊俊、王兆祥、金桂生、周鶴鳴、虞安定、馮子能等次之、奔向薛華立路而去、中華田徑塲已在目前矣、</p>
<p>姿勢重要功虧一簣</p>
<p>一百六十號張全洲、觀沿途經過、皆在最前、迄末段漸落後、達終點、裁判員議决取消資格、因路上發現跑跳情狀、故競走姿勢、亦甚重要、競賽者宜知改進、</p>

<p>石金生名不虚傳　九時四十分左右、西隅看台上之觀衆、齊起鼓掌、俄而兩賽員先後入塲、相差三米、視之、前爲石金生、後乃謝行導、斯時謝氏雄心勃發、脚下用勁、頗思一嘗冠軍滋味、何奈石金生健步如飛、一路當先、精神十足、迨至終點時、先謝五十米之遥、金之成績、一點四十六分二十秒、謝則後十二秒到的、再五分十三又見第三名程宣光臨、以上三人均係表演賽員中之佼佼者、</p>
<p>凌寳榮奮勇奪標　未幾、兩賽員逐影而至劉祥堃首先現身、緊隨後者凌寳榮、凌氏爲正式賽員之最先覓得新大陸者、手臂擺摇合式、腿部行動有致、昻頭挺胸、有英雄不可一世之概、最後五十米之發奮、益能鼓起觀衆之興趣、掌聲震耳欲聾、凌氏脚步更健、形勢漸衰、被其越出先到、成績一點五十三分三十二秒、奪得大會冠軍、亞軍凌鵬後六秒至的、第三劉善富、第四原係張全洲、犯規取消資格、王兆祥遂升第四、十四歲之王孟茂、成績二點零五分、四十一歲之葛仲高、到塲名次七十四、尚有十四歲之楊長康則在八十名之後、</p>

<h3>國民會議瑣譚</h3>
<p>— 霞扉自京寄</p>
<p>燦爛莊嚴之國民會議。已於萬衆歡騰中如期開幕。實爲吾國空前未有之盛舉。其關於犖犖大端。已分載各報。茲撮錄會塲瑣聞。以實自由談。</p>
<p>中央要人之題字忙　國議代表。爲留存紀念起見。多備有册頁。於會議休息時間。分請中央要人題字。藉留鴻雪。十二日第四次會議。中委褚民誼氏。爲某代表書「提倡體育養成健全國民」數字。足徵褚氏對倡導體育之熱心。十四日第六次會議。李石曾氏尤大受包圍。求書者絡繹不絶。李皆一揮而就。題字有「天下爲公。」「親愛精誠。」「互助。」「博愛。」「各盡所能」等。且有某代表爲其亡父求賜誄辭者。氏亦書「遺範猶存」四字貽之。此外有向蔡元培。邵力子。余井塘等求書者。但人數不若李氏之多耳。</p>
<p>會議塲中之女代表　此次女界當選國議代表。有劉純一。史志英。李峙山。鄧蕙芳等四人。主席團特許列席者。有唐國楨談社英等十人。殊爲全塲所注目。劉純一更當選爲主席團之一。渠等提案頗多。皆謀男女絶對之平等。第四次會議。李峙山對剿滅赤匪一案詳爲論列。切中時要大爲議塲推重。史志英於休息時。復持提案。往來各代表間。請求附署。狀極匆忙。所提普設兒童寄託所案。誠爲减少農工婦女之痛苦。促進生産發達之要圖。此種設備。歐美行之已久。在生産落後之中國。需要尤切。史氏洵一有心人也。</p>
<p>主席團諸氏之賢勞　主席團中戴季陶氏對議事富有經騐。處理案件。有條不紊。第四次會議。通過全部約法。僅以二句鐘圓满解决。洵屬難能。于右任氏言論丰采。逈異恒流。惟氏操秦語。旁聽席中不甚了了。張學良劉純一諸氏。多伏案揮毫亦云勞矣。</p>
<h3>吳稚暉之小文章</h3>
<p>— 某</p>
<p>近訪丁福保君。見丁君近又編說文詁林補遺一百三十餘卷。尚未卒業。吳稚暉先生書其編輯室之額曰詁林精舍。而跋其後曰。仲祜先生博精小學。又好禪理。頻年綜貫許氏書。爲說文詁林兩巨編。垂惠藝林。比迹儀徵長沙而有餘。顧先生正逃佛隱海市。如慧琳之潛養。以餘力治諸經音義。其韻致相髣髴。額小築曰詁林精舍。聊以寄意。其友吳敬恒爲作篆張之。</p>
<h3>難病診治談</h3>
<p>— 半狂</p>
<p>方愼盦君。爲金針神醫黄石屏先生得意弟子。石屏先生故後。方君供職軍中。久不以金針問世。以是滬人士之仰慕石屏先生針術者。均以失傳爲憾。前年方君退職庽申。友人乃均勸以金針活人。懸壺之後。凡有疑難雜症。經方君一針而愈者。不知凡幾。其最著者。如某婦患臌。經方君一針。吐出毒虺。（形如小蛇。不知是否此名）病即霍然。此毒物至今浸以瓶　。陳方君醫室内。又如師景山先生中瘋。邱子嘉君病足。俞逸芬君背傴。均由方君針愈。最近余又目睹方君診治難症二則。尤堪欽服。一則爲陳滄舟君之子。生甫念月。月前兩腿忽痛不能立。先由某西醫診治。（陳君爲留英學生篤信西醫。）但云病重。不能舉其病名。並謂即能治愈。其腿必廢。照以愛克司光。云爲毫無辦法之腿病。後又陳友黄竹笙君。介紹至新閘路和藥里方君診所針治。方斷爲温熱病。果數日而痊。又一則爲乳癌病。中西醫均斷爲難治之症。大致由於肝鬱。西醫解剖。亦未必均能全愈。有浙湖張氏。年已六十。忽病乳癌。延他醫診治。兩年未效。後亦由友介至方君處針治。未幾痊愈。張氏之子。特贈以神針壽世之銀盾。以誌感忱。方君針術之神。固有值得一紀者矣。</p>
<h3>春游歸來</h3>
<p>— 沈廷凱</p>
<p>好春易逝。遊興闌珊。予本年春遊行程。歷禾杭蘇錫諸地。旣歸。述其所見。以寄瘦鵑。</p>
<p>南湖爲禾中勝境。烟雨樓尤著盛名。自來巨卿名公。履烟雨樓者。無不有雪泥鴻爪之留。清乾隆帝。曾兩次駐駕。故墨跡獨多。彭雪琴宫保。寫横直梅花各一。鐫碑於寳梅亭中。有詩云。「作别孤山處士家。又來鶴渚泛烟艖。風流太守多情甚。笑索梅花向水涯。」樓臺四面皆水。植名花異草至繁。南湖昔日之船娘芳譽。載歌遊湖。傳爲韻事。今則格於禁例。漸次銷沉矣。國交孫中山先生。於民國初元履斯。故自舟渡樓。首先即見「民國元年孫中山先生來遊於此」之横額。令人生偉人與勝境千古之心。予已五載未履此摟矣。覺烟波之無恙。嘆人事之已非。登樓遠眺。感慨系之。</p>
<p>由嘉興赴桐鄉。三小時可達。輪行先抵雙橋。改由渡船入城。雙橋之西。有明代鍾將軍廟。其地雖屬窮鄉。而於吾國古代戰爭史上。則占極光榮之一頁。蓋當明代日軍長驅犯浙。至雙橋而兵馬大挫。即歷史上所謂鐵菱關一役也。入桐鄉城。遊軟石橋鳳鳴寺諸勝。縣長某君。致力縣的建設。殊費苦心。故規模甚備。滬上名醫程志和敦生昆仲。皆桐鄉籍。適於時在桐。故得週旋兩日。縣長聞程君返里。曾詣程宅。有創設平民醫院之計畫。維其事尚在討論中。而地方長官與地方士紳之爲平民設想。殊值得爲予遊記中之一節也。遊杭未至西湖。即赴富春。舟過六和塔。漸入富春江。數百里水明如鏡。已不啻身入畫圖。而綠水青山。容與中流。眞有飄飄欲仙之感。旣抵桐廬。越宿遊七里瀧。予固未嘗遊斯。嘗聞朋輩力繩富春之美。今履其地。信矣。去年東渡扶桑。歷彼邦勝境。深嘆國内無地知之。今入七里瀧。反覺我勝於彼。至盛名之下之嚴子陵釣台。與謝臯羽哭台。分峙東西。台上有亭。西亭豎有清風千古之大碑一。山中有嚴先生祠。及客星樓等古跡。惜斯日舟行迂遲。抵山已逾中午。而遊人寥落。以未能盡餐秀色爲憾也。桐廬有美味曰桃花鱖。殊不讓松江之鱸。至富春江上之好山好水。苦吾無文以形諸筆墨。而幽雅靜趣。至今猶縈繞於心頭焉。</p>
<p>蘇錫之行。同遊者爲滬上李祖桐邱褚聨兩會計師。及李承洪馮錫庚諸君。以兩日光陰。歷天平虎邱獅子林汪義莊怡園諸名勝。大都舊地重臨。無足述者。更以兩日光陰遊梁溪。歷黿頭渚梅園蠡園惠山等處。吾人蘇錫之行。其目的在吃。觀景玩園。不過因時制宜而已。李祖桐君。一餐能盡二蹄。旣大爲同行者生色。而又爲酒家所驚嘆。李君尚自嘆弗如乃叔李五爺之量洪也。（李徵五先生）頻返之日。李承洪君等將由錫而湖。予儕伴之太和號船中。承洪即吳興名勝桃園之少主人。堅囑同赴三吳。惜以事而未畢。汽笛一聲。遂於揚巾伸手中道别矣。（却酬）</p>
<p>出版界消息　荀郎慧生。爲現代四大名旦之一。其藝術與梅尚程異曲同工。各造峯極。而年富力强。虚心好學。則非其他名旦所能及。大東書局「戲劇月刊」主任劉豁公君。有鑒於此。爰定於該刊三卷第八期。出一荀慧生號」又以菊朋爲譚派健將。特照前出艶秋少樓合刊例。附刊「言菊朋號。」有以關於荀言之文稿。於十日内。寄予該刊者。酬資一律從豐。逾期則恐不及刊入云。</p>
<h3>黄海環遊記（六）</h3>
<p>— 黄炎培</p>
<p>所謂東綫。從瀋陽經海龍。達吉林。從此遼吉兩省城的交通。不必經吉長與南满了。所謂西綫。從北寗路之打虎山。經通遼。洮南。至齊齊哈爾。再北已達克山。不久可達嫩江。—另築支路從洮南向索倫。尚未到達。—從此齊齊哈爾可不經中東及南满而直達關内了。這兩路所經。都是農産林産狠豐富的地方。葫蘆島築港在進行中。落成後。西綫可自由進出海口。這是何等痛快的事。而况南满路用金。這西路用銀。金貴銀賤。不又是發達該兩路的好機會麽。可是金融家告訴我。西路生意狠不好。不但借欵還本息辦不到。連開支都不够。爲什麽呢。據說還是管理法不講究的緣故。如果這樣。這是應該何等趕快努力改良的事。</p>
<p>東省對日交涉的枝節。還有一件。就是朝鮮移民。日本把本國的人民。移到朝鮮南部。朝鮮南部人民。移到北部。北部人民。移到遼吉兩省。現朝鮮人之移入兩省者。已達二百萬。他們政策非常巧妙。一方解决本國人口過剩問題。一方利用朝鮮人國籍問題的不易解决。做他們取得满蒙租地權的先驅。因此東省地方官吏。對鮮人事件。非常頭痛。種種糾葛與蠻横。加以制止。日人便從而挑撥鼓煽。蓋堅其傾向日本的心思。供他們的利用。</p>
<p>吾遊東省。見鄉間種水稻的。都是朝鮮人。問水稻是否好。答好。問。當地人何以不種。答不會種。只有朝鮮人會種。在這大豆過剩的當兒。應否勸地方人民改種他物。某地有水。應否定爲水稻區域。用什麽方法。招關内慣種水稻的來提倡種水稻。或指導種水稻。而勿讓朝鮮人以種水稻爲專業。這不是政府應該確政策。一步一步進行的麽。</p>

<h3>霍桑探案轉灣（一七）</h3>
<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>伊低頭想了一想。摇頭答道。「我不認識他。昨天的男賓很多。我所認識的不到十分之一。我不曾注意到這樣的人。」我道。「你再想想。在你認識的男賓們中。有没有這樣狀貌裝束的人。」佩芬道。「實在没有。我記得穿西裝的祇有江家的表兄。和王家的小舅舅。還有我的同學寳珠姊的哥哥。還有對門秦家。歐陽家的兩個鄰居。年齡似乎相仿。不過身材和面貌都不相同。」我忙道。「你說的那個同學寳珠姊的哥哥。呌什麽名字呀。」佩芬道。「他姓姜。名呌靜源。他也在江蘇大學裏讀書。高我一級。寳珠却是和我同班的。」我又道。「這姜靜源住在那裏。你可記得他昨夜什麽時候走的。」佩芬道。一他們住在虹橋路。昨夜他們兄妹倆一塊兒走的。那時候廳上的男席已散了大半。並且他是一個瘦長身材的人。比你高出不少。我們背地裏曾給他起過一個綽號。呌做白無常。這個人怎能合得上你所說的人呢。」我又不禁失望。一轉念間。我又想到一種新的問句。我突然問道。「你的男同學中。有没有這樣的人物。」佩芬想了一想答道。「這個難說。我記不得許多。」我道。「那麽。男同學中和你比較接近些的。可有狀貌相同的人。」佩芬的面頰上微微紅了一紅。反問我道。「姊丈。你說的接近。指什麽說的呢。」我故意沉着臉色。索性直言談相的答道。「我老實說罷。在這男女同學的潮流之中。往往有許多不顧人格。不自量力的男同學們。抛了學問。專心在單戀上做工夫。芬妹。你可也有這樣的經騐麽。」我這問句自以爲冒着此險。如果被我的岳母聽得了。說不定要加以申斥。可是佩芬倒也並不怎樣。伊但笑了一笑。緩緩答道。「這樣的經騐。我敢說每一個都不能不有。我在每一星期之中。接到這樣莫名其妙的無聊信。終有五六封之多。我起先還上當拆閲。後來祗覺得他們的可鄙。所以我但瞧信封上筆跡生疏。便順手付之一炬。從没有一封例外。所以那寫信的人是誰。不但面貌。連姓名都不知道的。」我覺得我的問句已窮。這一次的任務。大概終不能免於失望了。但我在立起身來告辭的時候。還發了一句最後的問句。我道。「那麽。在你的意識之中。完全想不起有這樣的人麽。」佩芬仍持着前議。答道。「完全没有。」於是我就辭了出來。</p>

<h3>紗花時局左右紗市</h3>
<p>標準擊落三兩…現紗北銷不絶</p>
<p>上週紗市、因受時局打擊而趨跌、兼之美棉又轉下游本埠人心愈虚、賣方壓迫尤烈、市盤摇動不定、惟匯兌堅挺、日本紗價高貴、若合銀盤、在二百十兩外、此因該處底貨缺乏、三品期紗又有軋空之勢、漲勢乃劇烈在華採辦本紗、輸送日本、聞申新紗廠已售出不少、五月份之貨悉數售空、但時局謡諑紛紜、加之美棉頻頻報跌、故投機家隨勢抛出、壓力重重、市面終趨下落、時局能平靜、美棉立定、或有轉漲可能、不過匯兌不長、銀盤物價亦無十分大跌面也、現紗各帮買去不少、北方一帶以三品紗匯兌關係、故採辦不絶、漢口四川内地等處均有辦量、惟華南一帶受政局影響、久未動辦、蓋時局與紗市、大有密切關係也、查全週各帮買去統計一萬包光景、輸出日本及南洋等處、尚不在内、同行中進五千九百包、日紗市較堅跌一兩以外、標紗價比前週跌三兩三錢至二兩六錢、成交計十五萬一千六百五十包、三品紗本月份比前週漲四元六角、茲將各帮口買去之包額分誌於後、</p>

<h3>上週棉市受美棉摧殘</h3>
<p>現棉消費力非常單薄</p>
<p>棉市趨疲、以美棉步步向下、形勢悲觀、本埠底貨雖枯、受其重大打擊、惟日商仍拉緊不放、現棉生意異常岑寂、各廠均無需要、故散戶一致抛空、總之存貨太枯、棉市跌風未熾、加之匯兌尚堅、有一部份皆不敢抛出、前途須視美棉爲轉移、標棉各月比前週跌九錢半至七八錢、成交計三十五萬七千六百擔來源計姚花一千一百五十包、木架花一百包、各廠買去均係零星交易美棉現貨比前週跌六十磅音、茲將各廠家買去之量額、分誌於後、</p>

<h3>本市米價連日高漲</h3>
<p>滬上食米、近日因各埠進口貨减少、以致米價日有上漲、昨日特别白米、已售至十四元、頭號白米、則售至十三元六角、二號三號亦售至十三元二三及十二元七八、聞今日特别白米將售至十四元四角左右、頭號白米亦須在十四元上下、即最下等之三號白秈米、亦須售至十二元内外較諸兩星期前、已高漲至一元有奇、據新聲社向米商方面調查、最近米價日漲之原因、實以連日天氣不佳、及客商運輸大批米糧出口所致、至滬米之來源則甚旺、今年當不致感缺乏、預料天氣轉佳後、可望漸次恢復云、</p>
<h3>肉商將全體休業</h3>
<p>兩租界一千三百餘家</p>
<p>議决明日起一致行動</p>
<p>本埠南北市及各鄉區等鮮猪業、爲反對市財政局直接點隻征收屠宰税、實行斷屠、業已三日、前昨兩天、各店所有售餘之隔宿肉、業已售罄、故今日起、華界均無鮮肉出賣、租界同業、昨亦議决、一致行動、市商會呈請市府救濟、茲將各項情形分誌如下、</p>
<p>休業狀况　　鮮肉同業、因屠税問題、宣告斷屠後、昨日南北市各鮮肉舖戶、已無肉可賣、實行休業、雖大都仍照舊開門、但祗留學徒看守店堂、頗爲清靜、一般住民、及飯店麵店等麵均赴租界内購買麵市公安局第一·二·三·四·五·六·七·八區曁分所·分駐所·派出所·均派長警分路巡查詢問麵</p>
<p>一致行動　鮮肉内業實行休業後、英租界陸稿薦等三百餘家、法租界永大等二百餘家、美租界王紀仁等八百餘家、連日分組開會、討論援助事宜、聞現已决議十九日起、停止進貨、租界内聚興·仁元·寗海·蘇錫·等宰牲公司、勢必斷屠、二十日起、一致休業、表示援助、</p>
<p>影響猪商　南市薛家浜長順·長源·預和·長和·源太·源順·昇元·潤大·春元·等猪行、吳淞萬茂·嘉泰·萬愼·等猪行、洋涇復興猪行·閘北隆茂猪行·自南北市鮮肉同業休業後、銷路驟减、並聞租界内肉商、將起而援助、已預備减少進貨、並電江北各地猪商、暫緩裝鮮猪來滬、</p>
<p>函復當局　鮮肉業同業公會、昨函　　市公安·財政·衞生·局云、逕啓者、敝會昨日奉到會銜訓令内開、（中略）奉此、查敝會宗旨、原爲維護同業營業生計、此次同業間、因要求屠税改征營業税之後、爲顧全國課起見、曾據情呈請市民訓會·市商會·轉請市府、體恤辦理在案、惟恐同業間有人煽惑滋事、徒遭營業上之損失、亦曾派員分别勸導、勿受人愚弄、靜候上級處斷解决、詳陳下衷、祈請鑒諒爲幸、</p>
<p>呈市府文　市商會昨呈市政府文云、呈爲呈請事、案於本月十五日接本市鮮肉業同業公會函稱、（中略）查屠宰税按照營業税徵收大綱補充辦法第十一條規定、暫照原定税率徵收、意在維持原有税源、使原來指定之敎育經費等用途、不致驟减短絀起見、所云原定税率、自指歷年未實收之税率而言、庶與部定立法、保持税源之用意相符、上海屠宰税、據肉商報告、歷年繳於省敎育經費管理處者祗六萬元、則現在第一步合法手續、即爲應照補充辦法第十一條仍照原來六萬元之税額徵收、蓋部令辦法、所以不得驟行改從營業税率者、爲防税額之縮减、所以仍照原定税率者、爲防負担之增加、折衷至當、具有深意、本年省敎育經費管理處、委託市財政局代徵、聞照歴年税額已有增加、此與部定補充辦法、已有未符、然據傳述不過改爲年繳七萬元、是所增尚屬有限、市財政局旣處於代徵地位、即應就此年額分配攤派、乃忽抛棄歷來之辦法而改爲按隻徵收、據肉商估計、其所負担税額、當較從前增加三倍、顯與部頒辦法維持現狀之意、大相違反、此項增收之數、如果不解歸省敎育經費管理處、而歸入市庫、則市庫以代徵而得意外之收入、肉商即以代徵而得意外之損失、殊未平允、根據此項理由、該肉商爰不得已而有改辦營業税之請求、蓋爲顧全市庫收入、减經肉商負、舍此實無辦法、理合備文呈請鈞府鑒核、俯准照辦、實爲公便、</p>
<p>肉商意見　據肉業中人云、此次停市、實出於不得已、外界或有不明眞相、疑有人從中煽惑、其實各店完全出於自動、故市府雖飭令公安局調查煽惑休業首要分子、以便究辦、不知從何處調查、蓋現在包商認税、表面上雖宰猪一頭、納捐三分九分、實在各店并未點隻繳税、目下南北市較大之店舖、每天售出之白猪四五頭或六七頭不等、每月納税、不過二十元左右、或十元左右、較小店舖、每天售白猪二三頭、所納之税、月僅四五元不等、若財局直接點隻收税、則每天售猪六七頭者、每月須繳税六七十元以上、售猪四五頭者、每個月須納捐四五十元、較諸包商認税、相差一倍以上、故各店皆能不約而同、報載點隻徵税、每年預算可收十四萬元、其實尚不止此數、所以各店等皆如是堅决云云、</p>

<h3>公共租界電車工潮昨訊</h3>
<p>一度商議仍無結果</p>
<p>日日社云、昨日公共租界電車公司銅匠工人、仍繼續罷工、雙方形勢、頗爲緊張、一時似難解决、茲將日日社記者探得之消息記之如次、</p>
<p>商洽無效　昨日、聞工方曾得公司方面通知、着派人往商洽、乃派工人領袖、出而談判、惟無圓满結果、故仍繼續罷工、工人方面、態度甚堅决、團結一致、聲言須達到目的爲止、而公司方面、則以事難辦到、故未能允許云、</p>
<p>罷工統計　電車公司之銅匠工人、共分三處、一在倍開爾路、係總廠、規模頗大、工人大約有五百餘、一在楊樹浦黄浦碼頭附近、一在赫德路靜安寺路附近、該兩處規模較少、且分車務機務兩部、車務爲售票司機辦車之地、機務部即銅匠工人工作處、每處日間工人、均僅十餘人、夜間則有百左右人工作、此次罷工、工人均係倍開爾路總廠全體工人、至其餘兩處工人仍尚工作、</p>
<p>損車暫擱　倍開爾路總廠銅匠工人、乃修理電車之大損壞處、因該廠規模大、而機械精、銅匠也有高深技術、其餘兩處、則祗能修理車之小損壞處、故現在電車發生損壞時、小者由兩廠修理、大者則暫時留置、須俟罷工風潮解决後、方可進行</p>
<p>工作加緊　該公司所有電車、計有軌電車一百零一輛、拖車一百輛、無軌電車九十八輛、統計每日損壞之車、約有六七輛、現公司督楊樹浦赫德路兩廠工人、加緊修理、以資需用、三五廠門外之戒備、昨日稍寛、各該管捕房仍派印捕二人守候門首、已非前日之形勢森嚴矣、</p>
<p>要求條件　英商上海電車廠全體工人交涉委員會所要求者、爲（一）釋放被捕工友喬生發·金伯棠·並保證不再發生捕人事件、（二）公司停人或辭退生意、要給退職金養老金、起碼一百元、满一年二百元、年多照算（多一年加一百元、譬如五年六百元）、（三）無論開車賣票銅匠小工等、每人每月津貼房錢六元、（四）禮拜休息工錢照給、做工給雙工錢、做過時工作、亦給雙工錢、（五）銅匠小工等乘車免票（派司）英法租界通用、</p>

<h3>中國銀行民國十九年度營業報告</h3>

<h3>中國銀行民國十九年度營業之進步</h3>
<p>民國十九年度值内外多事之秋、而本行營業狀况、較之十八年度、仍得日見進步者、良由本行之穩健政策、已得社會之眞實諒解、而是年一年間對於業務之種種革新、亦不無成績足述、此對於股東、堪以慰告者、謹縷述如左、</p>
<p>存欵　十九年度活期存欵餘額爲四一六、三八八、八一五元·五六、較十八年度增加三三、六○三、二三○元·○九、定期存欵餘額爲六九、六八八、九○二元·三○、較十八年度增加一四、三七七、八九六元·一一、兩共增加四七、九八一、一二六元·二○·其最顯著之現象、厥爲增加部分、大都爲工商界私人團體、而機關方面反見減少、此由本行之爛業務方針、方圖與社會工商界接近、一面盡服務公衆之責、一面方避與中央銀行趨於平行綫、而期副國際匯兌銀行之實、凡斯志願、幸得實現、茲將存欵之增加部分之成分、及機關存欵減少數目、開列如左、機關存欵、較十八年度減少三、九三九、九四五元·九六、工商業存欵、較十八年度增加三一、四六六、四八五、一七、佔增加部分之百分之六六、團體及個人、較十八年度增加一六、九五七、四五四、九一、佔增加部分之百分之三四、</p>
<p>放欵　十八年度活期放欵餘額爲三○九、二二九、五五七元·五三、較十八年度減少四、四二四、一五○元、五二、定期放欵餘額爲一○九、三八四、八四五元·八二、較十八年增加一二、九三一、四二○元·九一、關於放欵、本行抱定輔助工商實業之宗旨、凡可以增加國民生産力、改進國民生活之事業、無不勉力赴之、以贊其成、觀下列放欵數字、即可知本行精神之所在、而差符於十八年度本行宣言之業務方針、以朝社會對本行之信任、日增月進也、機關放欵、較十八年度減少三、二一五、六二九·八一、同業放欵、較十八年度減少二一、八二六、四一○·四五、商業放欵、較十八年度增加一一、○九○、三四○·四五、實業放欵、較十八年度增加一一、六四九、三四三·七三、團體及公用事業放欵、較十八年度增加四、一九九、一一○·四五、個人、較十八年度增加二、二三九、七六○·八八、</p>
<p>查本年度、貸借對照表、活期存欵、活期放欵内、各有國外部、期收付外幣、十九年底未到期者、合本位幣約四千六百餘萬元、未列上列比較數内、</p>
<p>有價證劵　十九年度爲六五、○八五、一二三元·八四、較十八年度增加三一、八七四、五二三·八二、良以存欵增加、爲運用分數起見、同時爲增加金貨投資、力圖資産確實起見、故增加數目較鉅、茲將金銀兩公債之成分分析如左、</p>
<p>十九年度　十八年度</p>
<p>銀幣　六二·五　七五·○</p>
<p>金幣　三七·五　二五·○</p>
<p>本行投資之金銀公債均取分散主義、不集中於一二種、以期減少風險、其公債决算價格、内債按年底市價、照八折結算、外債於照市價八折結算外、復以先令按行市八折折價、似此可免公債狂落及先令反長之種種影響、而期資産之確實、</p>
<p>房産　十九年度營業用房産器具爲八、三○四、四九六元五三、較十八年度增加一、九一八、二一二元二二、其增加部分中之大宗、爲上海分行購進本行後面仁記路圓明園路地皮、爲改築總行及上海分行之需、同時又購進虹口及同孚路地皮、爲改築虹口及西區辦事處之需、共費價欵一百六十萬元左右、此項地皮之購進、適在地價狂漲之前、無形中獲利匪尠、至總行及上海分行、現在之房址狹舊、固亟待改建、而此項新屋之建築費、值茲材料奇昻之際、爲數度不在少、爲負擔均匀計、擬於每年盈餘項下、陸續提存一筆基金、以爲準備、</p>
<p>發行兌換劵　十九年度之發行餘額爲二○三、八四七、四四三元八九、較十八年度增加六姨一九、一五六元九一、所增不多、而滬行發行數目、則自一三一、九○二、七一五元、降至一三○、六一二、六八○元、計減少一、二九○、○三五元、良以全國不靖、商業阻滯、通貨漸有過剩之象、本行不得不略事收縮、俾社會通貨不至有不自然之膨脹、而本行區區目前之利益、固非所計也、</p>
<p>兌換劵製造費　此項科目列入資産項下、殊欠妥適、十八年度報告書中、曾聲明擬於一二年内、儘數提盡、本年度全行成績尚佳、因已儘數實行提盡、本行决算表之資産項下、已不復見兌換劵製造費一科目、以期資産之確審、諒亦爲股東諸君所樂聞也、</p>
<p>國外匯兌　本行分行之大者、夙已辦理國外匯兌、十九年七月一日總處增設國外部、以謀擴充外匯業務、值世界市面不振、貿易蕭條、加以金價漲落不定、致未能充分進展、本行於審愼從事之中、仍以促進國際貿易爲主、凡本國商人之經營進出口業者、無不竭力輔助、務使满意、故外國商家、夙與我國銀行不通聞問者近亦多樂與本行往來、而内地商人及機關之向國外定購貨物者、因外國廠家對於此種顧客及其所提供擔保品之性質、不甚明瞭、雙方多託由本行居間介紹、爲相互之保證、半年之間、本行承攬之進口押匯及開出信用狀之數、纍計約達美金三百萬元、倫敦經理處業務亦日有增加、大阪經理處、得日本政府之諒解及日本同業之援助、取得許可、不久即將開幕、深冀大阪機關之設立、能於中日貿易、有所裨益、以副兩國貿易家之期待、則本行同人咸與有榮施焉、</p>
<p>損益　十九年度純益計二、○八五、九四四元七七除照章提十分之一、即二○八、五九四元四八爲公積金、及攤派官股商股十釐正息共一、七二九、七三五元外、下餘一四七、六一五元二九、歸入滾存項下、本年度純益較之七八年度、雖所增無多、然如提盡兌換劵製造費及有價證劵之核實結價等、皆所以謀資産之確實、股本之安全、不特增進股東無形之純益、而本行屹爲金融重心之地位、亦可賴以維持於不墜者、（未完</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>在孔碑討論無結果而散的時候、海格總指揮正同威爾遜將軍在阿伯費會議、杜格拉爵士完全憬悟英法兩軍分開後協約國的危險、力主設法避免、因向帝國參謀部長建議即行提出福煦將軍爲總司令、他的忠告在當時尚未完全爲人重視、</p>
<p>當天晩上、威爾遜將軍到了凡爾賽、同米爾納伯爵交談之後、他在下午十一時來到巴黎看我、他主張指定克萊孟梭君負責「確定兩軍間更切實的合作和一切可供調遣的後備部隊的更善運用、」我則做他的專問題問、</p>
<p>我不加思索的向他指出這個計劃的無濟於事、因爲他的主張非但不能使種種事情化爲簡單、且易使他們更爲棘手、我的理由很簡明的包括在米爾納伯爵的記事裏面、</p>
<p>「關於福煦將軍、他無意於指揮一切、他所請求的無非是要兩政府切實指定其主持兩總司令間最高度的合作、換言之、他要與一九一四年頁普里之戰霞飛將軍委托他主持英法兩軍間更切實的合作時的同樣的職位、不過現在他希望兩協約國政府予以正式任命、」</p>
<p>米爾納侯爵和威爾遜將軍均想在目今形勢之下這是最好的解决辦法、</p>
<p>三月廿六晨、杜倫會議開幕時、形勢大致是這樣、「註、海格將軍曾召集他的各軍司令在杜倫會見、所以他不能不到杜倫去、原定在杜里會議的、現從其請、改在杜倫舉行）我到杜倫的時候、約在上午十一時三十分鐘、未幾米爾納侯爵亦到、海格總指揮、正在市政廳接受他的各軍司令的報告、會議延長、我乘機走訪隣近的小學堂、一九一四年十月六日、我來到杜倫參加敵我兩軍向北競進的時候、我與我的參謀部曾同駐此校、這種軍隊調動、前已記及就是産生頁石爾和頁普里兩次大戰擊退了敵人的、回首前塵、我把一九一四年時我軍的兵力組織軍備以及種種接濟同現在比較、我不相信在一九一四年時我們能克敵制勝、在一九一八年時將爲人擊敗、</p>
<p>善用我們的聨合的實力和百折不撓的抱着必勝的决心、這仍是成功的公式、有此財有此力、克敵制勝的問題成爲高等司令的意志力的事情、假使聨軍首領能張開眼晴注意到層出不窮的危險、能以密切的積極的合作精神抵禦這些危險、我對大戰的結果心裏絶無疑意頁石爾河和頁普里之戰是我們的先例、</p>
<p>我們在杜倫市政廳花園裏靜候開會時候、我就在法政府官員面前發揮這些基本觀念、會議在下午十二時四十五分鐘在市政廳裏開幕、法國方面到有法總統克萊孟梭與勞休爾兩君·福煦·貝當·和魏肯等將軍、英國方面到有米爾納侯爵·海格總指揮·及威爾遜·勞倫斯·和孟克漠等將軍、</p>
<p>起初、全體一致承認亞眠必須救護和大戰的成敗在此一舉、我於此點提出有力的意見、我們戰綫早被擊退到白留沙姆、在一九一六年的戰線之後、現在最關緊要的是不能再退、咫尺之地亦不能拱手讓人、務以全力堅守現有的陣地、這是第一個原則、須明白解釋、通告全軍、且須立即實行、尤其要急調後備隊促成聨軍鎔接、</p>
<p>現在英軍、除非從阿拉斯戰區抽調、實無兵可供調遣到沙姆河之南、阿拉斯區域正在劇戰自顧不暇、所以唯一的援助祗有來自法軍、</p>
<p>貝當將軍繼即說明他的計劃、他决定增加幾師軍隊送到畢卡特萊、日前孔碑會議主張派兵十五師、現擬派遣廿四師到孟鐵第歐、這樣、他希望擴張陣綫至沙姆河、不過他對於此點不能擔保、更因爲一天調動兩師軍隊、全部開拔完竣頗須是日、所以陣綫的擴張祗能緩緩的逐步進行、</p>
<p>會議至此、米爾納侯爵就同克萊孟梭君私談、他主張委我指揮戰事、（未完）</p>

<h3>破天荒的藍球賽</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>復旦中公的校工隊</p>
<p>我們裏近來眞是打球熱、什麽級際了、女生科際了、江大籃球錦標了、幾乎天天都有、所以體育部的揭示處、天天都佈满着這些通告、</p>
<p>前天是星期日、照例總有比賽的、我信步跑到體育部的佈告欄一看、一張青色而寫着大字的通告映在我的眼簾、</p>
<p>破天荒的藍球比賽、</p>
<p>本校工友隊對復旦校工隊、</p>
<p>時間、五月十日下午二時、</p>
<p>凡我工友務須武裝備戰、奮勇殺敵爲盼、隊長佈</p>
<p>實在這是破天荒、新奇極了、記得去年江大的足球賽、交大組織校工啦啦隊到暨南助威、已經奇特了、現在居然我們兩校的校工賽起籃球來、那更奇之尤奇、</p>
<p>………………………………</p>
<p>灰黑色的天空、吹着絲絲的微雨、我坐在房子裏、看着秋從上海購來的「前鋒月刊第四期、」房裏的兩個同伴、他們因爲明天要考數學大綱的緣故、埋頭在看、這個斗大的臥室、一時間眞是萬籟俱寂、我早把那破天荒的賽球忘在腦後了、因爲外面絲絲的雨依然下着、</p>
<p>「來了、來了、」我猛聽見一個聲音在窗外飛來、鼓掌的聲音亦隨着而起、</p>
<p>我這個時候才想起這定是復旦的校工來了、我跑到窗口一望、的確他們來了、前面有二個穿着西裝的領着隊、我想這兩個定是復旦的校工頭、</p>
<p>比賽開始了、宿舍的同學都出來看這一幕破天荒的比賽、人數比我們校裏舉行級際賽看的人還要多、可是上面絲絲的雨依然下着、我想假使没有雨、看的人還要多呢、我站在一個没雨的地方觀望、</p>
<p>我們工友隊的隊長、就是圖書館的那個茶房、兩個前鋒、一個是我們的惰茶房（他很惰、嘗給事務處記了一個小過、）</p>
<p>一個是我們呌他做急促鬼的厨房了、後衞一個是珠江餐室的伙計、一個我不認識、好像是園丁、</p>
<p>笑聲佈满了球塲、同學亦有啦啦的助威、他們球藝眞不錯、兩隊的實力亦甚平均、他們每日因爲職務的關係、幾乎没有什麽練習、居然有這樣的成績眞出我意料之外、</p>
<p>那個穿着西裝的評判員、满口都說着英文、我可不知那些工人、會不會「鴨子聽雷」呢、</p>
<p>第一局我們的工友隊敗了、大約有四五分之差、同學們代他着急、大呼加「油」、「汽車油」、「麻油」不止、第二局開始了、我們那個惰茶房因爲第一局失球太多了、換了一個不知那裏來的工友、這一來眞晃勇氣百倍、衝鋒陷陣、殺得復旦落花流水、他們個個的面孔、由着急轉變爲微笑了、我想這個新換的工友是從那裏來的呢、旁邊的一個同學說、「他是專管敎室的茶房」、</p>
<p>哈、哈、那個急促鬼的廚房打得满面是、血這是從鼻孔流出來、被他的手一擦、弄成满面了、他依然鼓着勇氣打下去、因爲時間所餘不多了、同學們都笑得彎了腰、</p>
<p>校門口的老婆子以及茶房的妻子都跑來觀光、小孩子在場子亂跳、有幾個工友歡喜得大聲的喊起來、跳起來、這——這無非就是勝利的現象、</p>
<p>時間到了、同學們替他們歡呼、一個個面孔含着了微笑、回宿舍内去了、</p>
<p>可是他們——工友——事還多着呢</p>
<p>一幕破天荒的賽球、遂告閉幕了、三分鐘後球塲上已無一個人影、天上的雨依然絲絲的下着、</p>
<h3>交大舉行清潔運動</h3>
<p>— 荃</p>
<p>交通大學鑒於一切疾病之生皆緣於不清潔之故、時屆夏令、瘟疫又將肆威、學生健康與學業大有關係、爲預防學生染疫起見、除飭校醫打預防針外、並於本月十五日舉行清潔運動一日、各院辦公室工廠圖書館體育館、均由僕役大掃除一次、牆壁粉刷潔白、油漆煥然一新、各學生宿舍、由學生自行整理就緒、屆時由訓育部曁學生自治會衞生部派人分别前往察看、</p>
<p>察看程序分全校宿舍爲一二區、新中院南宿舍爲第一區、上院中院西宿舍爲第二區、新宿舍女生宿舍爲第三區、每區察看員四人、訓育部占其二、學生自治會衞生部占其一、校醫處占其二、察看目的、只取其整潔、不尚華麗、察看後由察看員分别計分、每區各取三名、第一名贈以銀杯一隻、第二名贈以大銀盾一隻、第三名中號銀盾一隻、上面刊寫該室同室同學姓名、以示奬勵而留紀念、</p>
<p>察看結果、第一區第一名爲南宿三十號、第二區爲女生宿舍二號、吳陶兩女士室、第三區第一名爲新宿舍胡可時李荃蓀室、全校各室、大致均合格、在六十分以上者占百分之七十、在七十分以上者百分之三十、八十分以上者百分之二十、九十分以上者不過百分之五耳、</p>
<p>三區中等一名分數最多者當推女生宿舍、吳陶兩女士室、室内零星什物均不知藏於何處、牀上舖以白毯、殿以紅被、一則潔白無瑕、一則鮮艶奪目、地下更纖塵不見、桌上蓋以漆布、置花瓶等數事、當察看員蒞臨時、咸稱贊不置、四位不期然而均批予九十五分也、</p>
<p>分數揭曉後、即由訓育部訓育長發奬、訓育長並致辭曰、「現在蔡元培先生在國民會議提案中有整頓敎育方案、其中有一條頒令學校當局注重衞生訓育、本校清潔運動、實開各大學風氣之先、與蔡先生提案頗相符合、以後擬在敎務會議席上、提出每年舉行兩次清潔運動、一次在五月十五日、一次在十月十五日、並於該兩日放假一天云、」如此可見交大當局之注意清潔衞生、願全國各大學相繼舉行提倡清潔、勿令交大專美於前也、</p>

After the ceremony was conducted by Chairman Zhou Zuomin, the Presidium nominated Yu Youren to read the Assembly Declaration, and the entire body applauded to express their approval. Next, the Presidium nominated Dai Chuanxian to deliver the closing address, which briefly stated that the National Assembly, which the nation had longed for for many years, was holding its closing ceremony today with very satisfactory results. The National Assembly was indicated in the Premier's Testament, and it was not until last year, after the suppression of the rebellion, that the National Assembly could be convened. The General Affairs Office was established on February 17th and has been in operation for exactly three months. Despite the vastness of China and the inconvenience of transportation, the meeting could still be convened and closed within three months and successfully held. This was all thanks to the enthusiastic support of the people in various regions. The Assembly's major task is to complete construction, and the basis of construction is the Provisional Constitution. Therefore, this Assembly can also be called the Provisional Constitution Assembly. The Provisional Constitution now formulated is entirely based on the Premier's Testament. The Premier's Testament shows us that education and upbringing should be combined. This time, the formulated Provisional Constitution has clear provisions for education and upbringing. It is hoped that after the Assembly closes, the national citizens and the government will work together to start education and upbringing work, so that the national people can understand the Premier's Testament and have firm faith and effort in the construction undertaking. Then the realization of constitutional government will not be far off. As the Assembly closes, I, on behalf of the entire body, wish for the complete implementation and complete success of all resolutions of the National Assembly, and that the abolition of unequal treaties will be achieved in the shortest possible time, so that the citizens can achieve a position of freedom and equality, and so on. Next, Chairman Chiang of the National Government delivered a speech, followed by shouting slogans: (1) Accept the Premier's Testament; (2) Abide by the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period; (3) Support peaceful unification; (4) Trust the National Government; (5) Implement the Assembly's resolutions; (6) Long live the Republic of China; (7) Long live the Three Principles of the People. The ceremony concluded, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Speech</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang's speech on the closing day of the National Assembly is as follows:</p>
<p>The National Assembly has convened in the capital for twelve days. All participating representatives have expressed the sincere desire of the national people to accept the Premier's Testament with solemn enthusiasm, and have formulated the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period through detailed discussions, and have resolved important cases related to economy, education, diplomacy, etc., to show the future direction of national construction and governance. The hard work of the representatives during the meeting period has not only lived up to the trust of the compatriots in various regions, but also fulfilled their due mission to the entire country. Now, as the meeting comes to an end, Zhongzheng dares to express his solemn respect on behalf of the National Government.</p>
<p>The purpose of the National Assembly is to seek the unification and construction of China. Its nature is different from ordinary meetings, so the items discussed are very concise, but the achievements are very difficult. Whether these resolutions can be realized is not only ordinary practical work, but also national construction. To carry wood and move stones, everyone must chime in. Unless the whole body unites and contributes its strengths to the overall plan of the project, a great and magnificent building cannot emerge from the ground, and we will all have nowhere to shelter from the wind and rain. Therefore, confirming the need for unification and construction is one thing, and distinguishing the issue of unification and construction that must pass through praise, slander, honor, and disgrace is actually the key to the survival and prosperity of the nation and the race. Under the two major principles of consolidating unification and completing construction, the government and the people have equal responsibilities in seeking survival and saving the nation, and they cannot distinguish which is more important. China is currently in the stage of political advancement called tutelage, and how to obtain it is another matter. Accepting the Premier's Testament is important, but accepting and implementing it with all our strength is even more important. Here, Zhongzheng dares to offer the following points to all the representatives who are about to return, with utmost sincerity, and earnestly present them to the elders and brethren in various regions, and</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>beg for concerted efforts.</p>
<p>First, consolidate unification and respect the rule of law. To seek the consolidation of unification, we must base it on democracy and the rule of law. Only by taking the spirit of democracy as the spirit of unification can unification be thorough, and only by taking the standard of the rule of law as the standard of unification can the effect of unification be lasting. The importance of unification need not be elaborated. If national construction is compared to construction work, then unification is the foundation. Without a foundation, there is no building. Without unification, there can be no construction. However, unification is not only about leveling rebellions, nor is it only about unifying administrative power. True unification must be based on the entire nation. Unification is not about unity, but about converging all streams to converge on a common goal, and then the power of unification will be born. However, to seek commonality from differences, there must be a common standard to follow. This is why Zhongzheng advocates that the National Assembly formulate a Provisional Constitution for common observance. The spirit of the Premier's important testament is fully contained in the Provisional Constitution. In the future, all compatriots across the country only need to maintain the dignity of the Provisional Constitution with all their strength, and then the foundation of unification will be solid. However, promulgating the law is one thing, and implementing the law is another. Our country has always lacked the habit of abiding by and respecting the law. The meaning of democracy and freedom is often misunderstood, leading to the ridicule of being a sheet of loose sand, which has brought disaster to the country. Therefore, the cultivation of the spirit of the rule of law is an important part of the tutelage work. Only when the law is effective can the country be secure for a long time and construction can be realized. In the positive aspect, everyone must do their best to fulfill their duties and not abandon their responsibilities, as stipulated by the law. In the negative aspect, everyone must absolutely abide by the restrictions that the law imposes and not deviate in the slightest. In the future, all citizens of the country, including government officials and soldiers, must know that abiding by the law is the key to establishing the country, oneself, and others, and must not repeat the mistakes of indulgence and recklessness, so as to plunge the country into chaos and insecurity. Without law, there is no freedom. When the skin is gone, what will the hair adhere to? This is what all our compatriots across the country should strive for, and in education, we should also cultivate the spirit of the nation to respect the law and abide by discipline through strict discipline and life cultivation, so that the principle of democracy can be fully realized and constitutional government can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Second, confirm that people's livelihood is the top priority of national construction. According to the Premier's Testament, discussing people's livelihood issues is an important task of the National Assembly. The government has solemnly put forward the industrial construction procedure plan, the emphasis on production and vocationalization in the direction of education facilities, and the provisions of the People's Livelihood Chapter of the Provisional Constitution, all with this purpose as the center. China is currently trapped in a state of national poverty and people's hardship. It must have the ability to be self-sufficient economically before it can be said to have realized national independence. Only when the country has the ability to be self-sufficient economically can the people enjoy equal distribution. Therefore, increasing production is the foundation of implementing the Three Principles of the People. After the representatives return, it is hoped that they will especially elaborate this meaning to the people. If farmers can increase the production of agricultural products by one dou per year, and workers can work one more hour per day, the country and the nation can suffer less oppression from foreign economic forces. Therefore, the people must regard idleness as shameful and labor as valuable, and then they can survive and save the country, the principle of people's livelihood can be realized, and the nation can begin to achieve its survival.</p>
<p>Third, cultivate the nation's perseverance. The restrictions of unequal treaties have been unanimously denied by the nation. The government shall, based on its inherent powers, ensure the realization of China's complete equality and freedom in the international community. However, there is something more that I would like our nation to deeply realize. The attainment of complete equality and freedom of the country must take the realization of national independence as the main key. If the economic strength and self-defense capabilities of the nation fail to reach the point of independence and prosperity, then international equality and freedom will be based on extremely vague grounds. Therefore, our nation must strive to abandon the bad habit of vanity and restore national self-confidence, cultivate the virtues of fortitude and patience, and never forget the work of wiping out shame and seeking survival. Zhongzheng dares to say that if our 400 million outstanding people can be of one mind and work hard, implementing the determination of three years of accumulation and three years of education, then it will not be difficult for the country and the nation to achieve complete independence and freedom, and it will surely be able to lay the foundation for world harmony with the success of the Three Principles of the People. This is what Zhongzheng firmly believes, and especially hopes that all our compatriots across the country will have this confidence.</p>
<p>Fourth, promote education facilities. Education is the foundation of national establishment. During the tutelage period, both the increase in quantity and the improvement in quality of education should be taken care of at the same time. Regarding the popularization of education, both the central and local governments should regard it as a top priority, and especially should restore the spirit of the early days of school establishment thirty years ago, and have people from all over the country take the lead in running education as an obligation they should fulfill, and then the difficulties of economy and teachers can be properly resolved. On the one hand, the improvement in quality is equally important. The country and the people have both suffered from the ills of past education. In the future, education facilities must follow the provisions of the purpose of education of the Republic of China and its implementation guidelines, and the principles of the education facilities trend case passed by this meeting, with special emphasis on the cultivation of inherent virtues, the forging of strong physiques, and the infusion of modern science. Only by cultivating the inherent and beautiful virtues of our nation can we lay the foundation for national independence. Only by promoting physical education to improve the health of the nation can we guarantee the survival of the nation. Only by focusing on the infusion of science can the national productivity and living skills be improved, and the traditional bad habits that violate the spirit of science can be reformed.</p>
<p>Fifth, stabilize local order. The greatest scourge of the country at present is the instability of local order. The government deeply regrets that the bandit suppression has not been completed, and should supervise the responsible parties to make efforts. However, the stability of local order depends on the cooperation of local people to seek their own plans, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, the local people should imitate the spirit of holding village covenants by previous sages, and each should strive for the community, so that the order of society will be safe day by day, and the vitality of the country can be restored to its prosperity. The worrying phenomenon in recent years is especially that outstanding people in various places are leaving their hometowns in groups. The result of the emptiness of rural villages will inevitably lead to the failure of all affairs and the decline of the foundation day by day. This is especially a hidden worry of society, which should be strived to reverse.</p>
<p>Sixth, complete local autonomy. Local autonomy is the foundation of national construction. This is the Premier's special and clear vision. Since we have accepted the Premier's Testament and strived to implement it, future work should take the Outline of National Construction as a must-have textbook for everyone, and especially make double efforts to promote the four items stipulated in its Article 8: surveying the population, measuring the land, handling security, and building roads. The arrival of the starting period of constitutional government depends on the success of the construction of provincial and county autonomy. The six-year time limit for tutelage is very urgent. We must use the spirit of group competition to advance rapidly. It is hoped that the representatives will intensify their advocacy and encourage each other with compatriots from all over the country, from provinces to counties, from counties to villages, and from fathers to brothers, to jointly promote local autonomy. This is the most fundamental element of national construction. The realization of the Three Principles of the People will depend on this as the key. Only when the autonomous undertakings are carried out one by one can the use of the four powers be concretely realized and not flow into emptiness.</p>
<p>There are many clues to saving the country and building the country. What I want to say to the representatives and hope that they will convey to all compatriots, the above few points are not exhaustive. However, after this National Assembly, the country's politics has entered a new stage. The Premier explained the meaning of the National Assembly in his declaration when he went north, earnestly saying that the people should decide their own destiny and choose their own needs, and concluding with the people's awakening and struggle. From now on, the country's construction and rejuvenation has determined the steps that must be followed. In light of the training of knowing is difficult and doing is easy, the people must work hard. There is a saying that the beginning is simple, but the end will be huge. In recent years, the country's difficulties have been extreme, but the inherent vitality of the nation has often been vigorously revealed and cannot be concealed. From sharpening and advancing to brightness, from struggle to seek a way out, this is the common responsibility of the people today, and especially what the representatives should cherish in the past and look forward to encouraging each other in the future. Before the National Assembly, the responsibility for the success or failure of the revolution rested on whether the National Government could lead the people and point out the path they should follow. After the National Assembly, the responsibility for the success or failure of the revolution rested on the national people themselves. Whether the national people can make their final efforts and urge the government to complete the great cause of tutelage, this is the key to the success or failure of the national revolution and the basis for judging the rise and fall of China. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Word of Condolence to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly's word of condolence to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government, the full text is as follows: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Zhongzheng of the National Government, as a loyal believer in the Three Principles of the People and an unwavering pillar of the national revolution, has dedicated himself to serving the country and has vowed not to change his aspirations. His great achievements have surpassed the ranks of others. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was alive, he followed and planned, supported the weak and managed disputes, and participated in many aspects. He started the military academy and made special achievements. After Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, he donned mourning clothes and joined the army, clearing the two Guangs and laying the foundation for the revolution, and starting the initial progress. In the 15th year, he took command and swore an oath to march north, with thunderous speed, and everything pointed to was invincible. In less than a year, Xiang, E, Gan, and Wan were successively laid down, and Min, Zhe, Hu, and Ning were successively captured. At that time, the power of the Communist Party was growing day by day, secretly plotting to usurp the government and kill the lifeline of our country. Society was turbulent and could not end the day. He resolutely eliminated the suspicions of the group and resolutely investigated, and the national foundation was safe. He established the capital in Nanjing and continued to plan the Northern Expedition. There were more difficulties and he resigned and retired, and then received the Party's command to rise again and inspect the division. He was clear about his advance and retreat, and did not care about his own body. The wind and sound were touched, and the whole world followed. When the teacher was next to Jinan, the strong enemy tried to show off. He decided the big doubt in a moment and saved the country from extraordinary difficulties. He planned with courage and endured to achieve success. He finally laid down Qi and Ji and completed the unification. Tracing back to the start of the teacher, in less than two years, he has achieved the merits of ancient times and fulfilled the hopes of the letter within. As soon as the military uniform was released, he discussed disbanding the army. His vision was public and just, and he was not pleased by the people. Li Bai and Zhang Tang successively claimed rebellion, and they all succeeded in suppressing the great achievements with miraculous strategies. The military and political affairs were concluded, and he did not dare to rest. He worked hard and started tutelage. The remaining soldiers of the warlords were afraid that their different ambitions would have no chance to show off, and they colluded and colluded, and they raised troops again. Chairman Chiang led the heroic division to suppress the rebellion and fought hard to completely pacify it. He conquered Lu and Yu in the north and settled Heng and Xiang in the south. The foundation of unification was consolidated here. He then followed the will and advocated convening the National Assembly, formulating laws, and sharing rules to ensure unification and peace. Looking back on the past five years, whenever the country was in danger, it did not rely on Chairman Chiang to use his wisdom to put it in peace. If there was a danger of peace being destroyed, it did not rely on Chairman Chiang to exert his loyalty and courage to return to stability. Living in the government, he worked hard day and night. In the battle, he rushed into the arrows and stones. Knowing this hard work of the world, it is allowed to be rare in the history books. The representatives of this meeting discussed the great plan of building the country. Considering the special merits, they were deeply admired. Therefore, they decided unanimously in the whole arena to build the sincerity of national consolation. In the future, the great cause of building the country is coming. Internally, we will establish unification and complete construction. Externally, we will safeguard national rights and realize equality. We hope that Chairman Chiang will continue his unremitting efforts and lead the national people to advance together, continue the unfinished will of Mr. Zhongshan, and extend the blessings of the Republic of China to the world.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>League of Nations Committee's War of Words Begins</h3>
<p>Since the Great War, European countries have found that most members of parliament are not economic experts and are not qualified to solve the economic crisis. Therefore, they have searched for their so-called economic experts and established economic conferences to solve the economic problems of one country. Germany has worked hard on this, and Britain, France, Italy, and other countries have followed suit. It is appropriate that the domestic economic situation must reach a state of organization and perfection. However, observing the current situation, the economies of various countries are unable to support themselves. It can be seen that it is not easy to organize the economy of one country. How much more today is it to solve the world's economic crisis? Looking at the beginning of the League of Nations Committee meeting in Geneva, the foreign ministers of Germany and France had a war of words about the tax treaty, expressed their opinions freely, and pinned their hopes on the reconstruction of the European economy. The Italian foreign minister stated that it was not easy to solve the European economic crisis, and cited the various economic conferences in Brussels, Genoa, Rome, and Geneva as proof of no results. Finally, he clarified his own proposition, saying that countries should conclude an international cooperation agreement, but they must still reserve the right to negotiate treaties directly with other countries according to their own needs. His words were very rounded and clever, but his intention that economic cooperation was difficult to achieve was also obvious. Observing the general trend of the European situation, the German-Austrian tax treaty is indeed the biggest obstacle to economic cooperation, and its only key point is still worrying about the involvement of politics and military affairs. In addition to the German-Austrian tax treaty, there are still problems such as reparations looming. What domestic experts study and discuss mostly contains elements of self-interest. Now that each contributes its own propositions to international conferences, the situation has already become incompatible. In addition, with the differences of opinion among diplomatic politicians, how easy is it to seek successful cooperation to save this economic crisis?</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Guangxi Cannot Reconcile</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreigners received a telegram from Guangzhou that Chen Jitang had assigned military tasks to Guangdong and Guangxi, and Zhang Fakui's troops were incorporated into the Guangxi army. Zhang was unhappy, saying that he was a Guangdong native and 19 of his troops were from Guangdong, and should be included in the Guangdong army sequence. Zhang also led his troops to Wuzhou and headed for Xijiang, saying that if the Guangdong army returned to Guangdong, who would dare to stop them? Chen Jitang was quite anxious and sent troops to block them. It is also unknown whether a war will break out. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The position of the leaders of Guangdong and Guangxi seems to be shaking. There are many small parties in the two provinces, with divergent opinions and different propositions, which are difficult to unite. Many people also think that Chen Jitang's power is not enough to lead the masses. Now everything depends on the direction of the 19th Route Army. In the battle between the security team and Chen Jitang's army in Huangpu, it is said that a total of more than 200 people were killed or injured. (Reuters telegram from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Military Movements in Northern Henan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A person from Henan who came to Beijing said that Dian Ying's troops in Henan planned to automatically transfer from Zezhou to Huaiqing Prefecture in northern Henan. Liu Maoen's troops were stationed there. Upon hearing the news, they had assembled two divisions near Xinxiang. As for Shi Yousan's troops, the southernmost line was in Zhangde, more than 100 miles away from Liu Maoen's troops. In the past two days, passenger and freight trains between Pinghan were running normally. It is not true that Shi and Sun were opening fire in northern Henan. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Shang Zhen Returns to Taiyuan with Funds</h3>
<p>Barely Enough to Pay Two Months of Back Pay</p>
<p>Chiang and Zhang Continue to Allocate One Million in Military Expenses</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen left Ping for Taiyuan this morning with Hu Yiling and Luo Chengwei. Shang told reporters at the station that he was carrying a total of 2 million yuan, half of which would be used to organize finance and the other half to allocate to various armies to pay back wages. He could barely pay two months of back pay. It is extremely important to organize Jin banknotes. According to a telegram from my representative in Beijing, the central government has agreed to restore public debt. After the warnings from Chen and various parties in Guangdong, there should be no problem. If they still insist, the central government will inevitably issue an order to crusade against them. The interior of Guangdong is complicated, with several troops that Chen cannot mobilize. After Deputy Commander Zhang comes to Ping, I will still come here to bear the financial problems after the disaster in Jin Province. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<h3>Pan-European Committee Meeting: France and Germany Engage in Fierce Verbal Battle</h3>
<p>Touching on the Customs Union Issue</p>
<p>Courtis's Sharp Words Unstoppable</p>
<p>Briand Attacks from a Legal Standpoint</p>
<p>Italian Representative Advocates Economic Reconstruction</p>
<p>France Suspects Germany Harbors Militaristic Ambitions</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Special Dispatch): At today's League of Europe Committee meeting, after Chairman Briand delivered a speech welcoming the representatives from Russia, Turkey, Danzig, and Iceland, German Foreign Minister Courtis stood up to speak. His opening words stated, "We must clearly identify the various causes that have created today's economic crisis." He then analyzed it, saying that the main reason was that the production of food and raw materials was already excessive, while the purchasing power and consumption of various countries had sharply decreased. Europe is now deeply affected, and the division of a continent into countless small areas has caused extreme suffering. At this point, he lightly mentioned the German-Austrian tax treaty, saying that Germany had been greatly weakened by the double blow of the Great War and the currency crash, and had to seek a way to remedy the situation, so it paid special attention to this kind of customs union. He then moved on to the main topic, discussing the economic crisis and exposing the various unreasonable situations of creating 20,000 kilometers of new customs barriers and adding thirteen new currencies after the European war. He said that the Geneva Customs Truce Conference had attempted to remedy this defect, but unfortunately failed miserably. If countries do not want to remedy it, then so be it; otherwise, if the economic interests of several countries can be coordinated with each other and a common customs policy can be established, they must begin negotiations to break down customs barriers. Even France has taken this into consideration, so it has negotiated a customs agreement with Belgium, but unfortunately it did not succeed. Finally, he strongly stated that Germany is very willing to cooperate with other countries to achieve effective results. Any country that intends to consider this proposal, Germany is prepared to exchange views with it, so that a customs union can also be established in the future, and declared that many important figures in the German economic circles advocate a German-French customs union, and asked the meeting not to ignore Germany's wishes. Briand then stood up to speak, starting by saying that at this time, we must be extremely cautious and not say anything that would add to the difficulties of the situation. He then revealed a point that Courtis tried to avoid discussing, and attacked the legal issues of the German-Austrian tax treaty, claiming that tariffs were not the cause of the economic crisis, but were caused by the economic crisis. Although the Customs Truce Conference failed, there is no reason why continued efforts in this direction cannot succeed. At this point, he suddenly turned to the German-Austrian tax treaty itself, saying that he could not tolerate any contract that violated existing treaties, etc. After Briand finished speaking, Courtis replied that this matter will be proposed by the League of Nations Council on Monday and is not within the scope of today's discussion. Next, Italian Foreign Minister Grandi spoke, not recognizing that the European problem could be solved by any formula, and used the Grain Conference recently convened in Rome as proof of the results obtained by any separate agreement between countries, but in his words, he seemed to oppose the German-Austrian tax treaty more on theoretical principles and less on political and legal aspects. As for his economic reconstruction plan, it was of the same lineage as France's, roughly divided into four items, namely, the agricultural loan system, the industrial and commercial agreement system, the preferential treatment method, and the customs union system. Finally, Austrian Prime Minister Schober spoke, detailing the ineffectiveness of Austria's efforts to save the economic disaster in the past, and that recently, due to other countries' increasingly protectionist tariff policies, Austria's economy has been declining. Although the current Austrian government is prepared to sympathetically consider all proposals, it cannot sit and wait for the results of endless meetings due to the compelling situation. There are now many different opinions here on the German-Austrian tax treaty issue. Some advocate finding a reconciliation method behind the scenes, while others advocate organizing a special small committee to not only study the German-Austrian tax treaty union issue, but also the economic reconstruction plan proposed by France and Italy, and try to reconcile different opinions and merge them into a consensus. It is also heard that pressure is being applied to Austria, ordering it to abandon its customs union plan with Germany, and that countries will provide huge loans as compensation.</p>

<h3>Receiving Foreign News</h3>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Special Dispatch): At today's meeting of the European Union Committee, the Foreign Ministers of Germany and France both put forward important proposals for the economic revitalization of Europe, and engaged in verbal battles with each other. After German Foreign Minister Courtis stated Germany's position on the tariff issue, Chairman Briand stood up and criticized it. French Representative Ponsay today put forward a detailed French plan to deal with the surplus wheat in the Danube Basin countries and to develop international trade associations for industry and agriculture. All industrialized countries should conclude direct preferential treaties, and an international agricultural bank should be established. Before this proposal was put forward, Italian Foreign Minister Grandi had recalled the economic meetings of Brussels, Genoa, Geneva, and Rome in the past, which had all failed to find a way to solve the world's economic crisis. Various measures such as agricultural loans, international trade associations, preferential tax rates, customs unions, and long-term and short-term loans cannot be implemented in various countries. Grandi advocated the conclusion of an international agreement on cooperation, but each country still retains the right to negotiate treaties directly with other countries according to its own needs. Briand's criticism of the German proposal today also has its own reasons. France believes that the establishment of an economic union between the two German-speaking countries will eventually lead to military unification. If this is the case, then Germany will suddenly increase by eight million people, and its prestige and power in Central Europe will be solidified, and the dangerous principle of the balance of power in the old days will be revived. It is important to know that the equitable power policy among the nations was also one of the reasons for the unprecedented war that Europe suffered this time. Therefore, neutral political observers all believe that the secret negotiation of the German-Austrian tariff agreement and its sudden announcement, which shocked the world, was a most unfortunate event. France has long suspected that Germany harbors militaristic ambitions, and now, with the evidence of the facts, it will be unbreakable. It is also said that Germany's move is aimed at dealing with the naval coordination of Britain, France, and Italy. Others say that Germany wants to use this to be on an equal footing with France. However, Germany also argues forcefully that Austria will face the catastrophe of financial and industrial decline in the future. In order to save Austria, it has to come up with this solution to revitalize it.</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Reuters): The French Foreign Minister submitted a memorandum at today's European Union Committee meeting, pointing out that the tariff alliance proposed by Germany and Austria is illegal. The memorandum advocates that the surplus grain produced in Eastern and Central Europe should be dredged with preferential tax rates, and puts forward the following measures: (1) There should be international industrial cooperation to seek the interests of manufacturing countries; (2) The lack of funds in Eastern and Central Europe should be remedied by financial cooperation methods, such as the international agricultural loan system; (3) National loans should be raised under the jurisdiction of the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>Continued Riots in Egypt</h3>
<p>Cairo, 17th (Reuters): During the riots yesterday, one police officer died. Afterwards, a team of rioters clashed with the army, and the soldiers were forced to open fire, killing six rioters and wounding twenty-three. One British expatriate was among those killed or injured in Cairo. As of the end of the week, a total of nine people have died due to election disturbances. Many ballot boxes in various provinces were stolen. A passenger train near Damanhur derailed, overturning two carriages, but fortunately no one was injured. This riot is unprecedented in Cairo in many years and was caused by the primary election of the parliament.</p>
<h3>German Authorities Scheduled to Visit England</h3>
<p>To Discuss Issues Related to Both Parties</p>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters): It is reported that the procedure for German Prime Minister Brüning and Foreign Minister Courtis to visit England has been drafted, the details of which still need to be passed by the British and German authorities during their talks in Geneva. The German Prime Minister and others are scheduled to arrive in England on the evening of June 5th for a dinner party hosted by the British Foreign Office. The next day, they will go to the British Prime Minister's villa to discuss issues related to both parties during the weekend. The German Prime Minister and others must return home on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Swedish Strike Wave Still Raging</h3>
<p>Communists Hold Grand Demonstrations</p>
<p>French Textile Industry Prepares to Strike</p>
<p>Involving 125,000 People</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (National News Agency): The strike wave in Norrland, Sweden is still raging. The debate in the parliament today was fierce, resulting in several communist members being expelled from the meeting. The government has agreed not to send troops again and has limited the warships that have already been sent to only protect the families of the workers who are still working. Many cities and towns have joined the strike to show their support. The total number of strikers has reached 42,000. Today, the Communists held a huge demonstration to protest the shooting incident on Friday. In the capital alone, 50,000 people marched, which eventually led the police to use batons to suppress the demonstrators, injuring several people.</p>
<p>Roubaix, 17th (Reuters): 125,000 textile workers in the Roubaix and Tourcoing areas of southern France have received a notice from the textile industry association, instructing them to strike on May 18th to oppose the employers' proposal to gradually reduce wages. Metal workers, transportation workers, and mechanics employed by textile factories can all support this strike.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Resolutely Reduces Salaries</h3>

<h3>Russian Government Seeks to Resolve Old Debts Owed to Britain</h3>
<p>Plans to Repay One-Quarter at the Old Exchange Rate</p>
<p>London, 16th (National News Agency): According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Russian government is now seeking to resolve the issue of pre-war old debts with Britain. The British-Russian Committee will meet next week to discuss this matter. It is heard that the Soviet Russian government has proposed to repay 25% of each debt within ten years at the exchange rate of October 1, 1918, provided that Britain allows Soviet Russia to raise the same amount of debt in the London market. In general, people believe that the British government may not approve it, because this method is tantamount to exchanging new debts for old debts.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in US Trade</h3>

<p>Yuanshan Telegram, all newspaper offices please note: The bandit Kuang Jixun's troops were previously routed by our Zhang brigade at Qiaowanloupai and other locations. Yesterday, we learned that the bandits have regrouped with over ten thousand newly returned from Anhui, appearing ready to counterattack 潑皮河. Our Brigade Commander Zhang Jingxi led the Lu, Huang, Mo, and Zheng regiments in a campaign to suppress the bandits, engaging them in fierce battle near Zhengdian's Meilin River area. Our officers and soldiers bravely charged forward, engaging in close combat, and by dusk, they had completely routed the bandits. Due to the darkness and heavy rain, a thorough pursuit was not possible. In this battle, over two thousand bandits were killed, and countless flags and banners were seized. Our army suffered the loss of battalion commanders Li Jinghua and Dingguo, and approximately two hundred officers and soldiers were wounded or killed. Search and suppression operations are still actively underway. Respectfully, the Preparatory Committee of the Special Party Department of the 53rd Division of the Army, 叩寒.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Telegram, to the Shenbao office: We have sent the following telegram to Chief Supervisor He: The telegram received is earnest and righteous, with words that carry great weight, enough to rectify people's hearts and chill the hearts of bandits. After reading it, we are deeply moved. The National Revolution, through countless lives and warm blood, has created the unified situation of today. All citizens should exert their utmost sincerity to cherish the price paid by these hundreds of thousands of revolutionary martyrs. However, Gu Denglin, Lin Su, etc., as supervisory committee members, recklessly sent false telegrams, blinded by personal grievances, and recklessly initiating disputes. Spreading rumors and instigating discord from the front, with Chen Jitang responding from behind, even forcing Chairman Chen of Guangdong to leave. Accumulating military preparations, colluding with the Reorganization Faction, the incarnation of the Red bandits, and the remnants of the Guizhou faction, plotting subversive activities. At a time when the Red atmosphere is rampant and the great powers are watching, they dare to hold onto military force, violate party discipline, and undermine national law, disregarding the survival of the nation and the country. Their actions are no different from those of the Yan-Feng warlords. They are traitors to the Party and the country, and criminals to the people. If they are not eliminated, how can the authority of the Central Government be established, the Party and the country secured, and the desire for governance of our deeply suffering compatriots be satisfied? You, sir, considering the difficulties of the time, have compromised for the sake of the overall situation, offering the final loyal advice, demonstrating your loyalty and sincerity to the country and the people. If Chen still clings to evil words and refuses to see the light, he is embarking on a counter-revolutionary path, courting his own destruction. We should request the Central Government to severely punish him. Our association respectfully leads all armed heroes, ready to fight, etc. We hope that you will unanimously uphold justice, curb the chaotic plans in times of crisis, and save the Party and the country from difficulties. In this telegram, we cannot express our hopes enough. The Preparatory Committee of the Special Party Department of the Fourth Division of the National Revolutionary Army of the Chinese Kuomintang, 叩删.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>East Railway Implements Simultaneous Use of Chinese and Russian Languages</h3>
<p>Starting with Translation of Materials in Four Departments</p>
<p>The Rest to Implement on June 1st</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The simultaneous use of Chinese and Russian languages on the East Railway was proposed last year before Mo Dehui's first trip abroad, and the case was brought before the East Railway Board of Directors. After numerous discussions by the Chinese and Russian directors, it was decided to implement it. However, although the case was decided, how to implement it was not yet agreed upon. When the translation office was initially established, the Chinese side intended to use it as the basic mechanism for implementing the simultaneous use of Chinese and Russian languages. Before Mr. Mo's second trip abroad this year, the implementation method was again discussed in the Board of Directors, and it was decided to quickly establish a translation office, recruiting a large number of translators, in addition to assigning them to various departments under the Railway Bureau, and also appointing a few people at each station to specifically handle the translation of Russian into Chinese. The translation office had a dispute over budget and the recruitment of translators, which was only recently resolved. The Governor's Office has examined and selected translators, who have been assigned to their duties. The Board of Directors believes that since the translation office has been established, the simultaneous use of Chinese and Russian languages should be implemented immediately. Therefore, on the 4th of this month, the Railway Bureau was ordered to quickly prepare for implementation. The stations along the line are to be urged to implement it by the bureaus and departments under the Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau also issued an order yesterday, starting with the General Affairs, Materials, and Mechanical Affairs departments, which have heavier workloads, to implement a trial run from the 15th of this month. All official documents in these departments, whether submitted to the Chinese or Russian director, must be in both Chinese and Russian, with the two versions being mutually primary and secondary. If any discrepancies or inconsistencies are found in the translation, the Russian version shall prevail. The director shall review and approve the documents, and all Chinese and Russian documents shall be signed. The other departments are ordered to quickly prepare and implement the simultaneous use of languages uniformly on June 1st. This simultaneous use of Chinese and Russian languages is only a trial. If there are any obstacles or difficulties, they will be submitted to the Board of Directors for review and amendment before further implementation. However, the Chinese staff of the Railway Bureau, who have long been accustomed to using Russian, feel inconvenient with the sudden implementation of simultaneous use of Chinese and Russian languages. Therefore, there are still a few Chinese directors who, disregarding national rights and failing to recognize the big picture, are secretly inciting the Russian side to oppose this move. Therefore, it is feared that the uniform implementation of simultaneous use in all departments on June 1st may not be possible. Recently, there have been rumors here that the East Railway will be reorganized, abolishing the position of director, and having the directors take turns managing the bureau, merging the Board of Directors and the Railway Bureau together. According to my investigation, this was an informal proposal made by the Russian director Bandura during a tea party of the East Railway Board of Directors last month. Since there was no motion and few supporters, it is still too early to spread rumors about reorganization at this time. (12th)</p>
<h3>Liaoning Province Establishes Foreign Affairs Personnel</h3>
<p>Along the South Manchuria, Anfeng, and Yalu River Coasts</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Liaoning Provincial Government, in order to save government expenses, previously abolished the Diamond Mine Affairs Bureau, and the Yingkou and Andong Municipal Preparatory Offices. Foreign affairs in the counties under their jurisdiction were handled directly by the county governments. Later, considering that these counties were located along the South Manchuria, Anfeng, and Yalu River coasts, and that their foreign affairs with Japan were complex and required experienced foreign affairs personnel to effectively negotiate and achieve satisfactory diplomatic results, it was decided to have the Special Diplomatic Commissioner design a unified plan. The plan was submitted to and approved by the Provincial Committee Meeting. Yingkou, Andong, Fushun, Benxi, and Liaoyang counties were classified as first-class counties, each with a diplomatic secretary at a monthly salary of 120 yuan, plus 40 yuan for social expenses, and an assistant at a monthly salary of 60 yuan. Kaiyuan, Tonghua, Hailong, Xifeng, Xinmin, and Liaoyuan were classified as second-class counties, with a monthly salary of 100 yuan, plus 30 yuan for travel expenses. Fengcheng, Huaide, Fuxian, Gaiping, and Haicheng were classified as second-class counties, with a monthly salary of 100 yuan, but no social expenses. Lishu, Ji'an, Linjiang, Kuandian, Xinbin, Bin, Huanren, and Changbai were classified as third-class counties, with a monthly salary of 80 yuan. The previously established affairs commissioners, directors, and assistant administrators were all abolished. The newly appointed foreign affairs personnel must be recommended by the county governments and selected and appointed by the Special Diplomatic Commissioner. The foreign affairs expenses of each county will be paid from the provincial treasury.</p>
<h3>Second Instance Verdict in the Ye Case</h3>
<p>Judge Accuses of Perjury and Increases Sentence</p>
<p>Ye Drafts Appeal in Prison</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: After the conclusion of the second-instance hearing in the Ye Yixiong case, the High Court ruled that in addition to being convicted of murder due to jealousy, he was also charged with perjury as a judge and given a heavier sentence, still sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. The judgment has been delivered to the prison by the court for Ye to read. Ye still denies premeditated murder, requesting to review the entire record from the court, preparing to appeal, and drafting his appeal in prison. Since the Ye case occurred, it has not only attracted social attention, but also concerns the overall honor and disgrace of the legal profession. Therefore, people in the legal profession have been very serious about the trial of the Ye case. It is heard that the prosecutor, Chen Shijie, presented his opinions in court, disagreeing with the verdict, and must submit an appeal to the Northeast Branch of the Supreme Court within ten days of delivery. Therefore, Ye decided to sue. The main text of the court's judgment is as follows: The original judgment is revoked. Ye Yixiong is sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted premeditated murder, life-long deprivation of civil rights; one year of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for possessing military firearms and ammunition without permission.</p>
<h3>Serious Situation Between Japan and Russia</h3>
<p>Fisheries and Korean Bank Issues Negotiated Without Result</p>
<p>Both Countries Deploy Military Forces as Backup</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Negotiations on the Japan-Russia fisheries issue began after the new Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Hirota, took office. The two sides have been arguing for a long time over the difference in the exchange rate between Japanese yen and Russian currency without resolution. At the same time, the Chosen Bank in Vladivostok was sealed, cutting off the economic circulation of Japanese residents in the coastal province, who have been threatened with expulsion by Russian officials. The Japanese side is particularly unhappy about this, and Hirota has also negotiated with the Russian side, but there have been no results. Both of these matters concern the future diplomatic relations between Japan and Russia, and the peace of the Far East. Because they have not been resolved for a long time, rumors are rife. Japanese cruisers, seaplanes, submarines, etc., are often found in the coastal province, Sakhalin Island, and other places, so the public is panicked, and many are moving to better places. The Russian government believes that the Japanese military force is being used as a backup for negotiations, bordering on threats, and fears that if negotiations break down, a war will break out. During this time, it has no choice but to make corresponding deployments. Therefore, in the past two weeks, most of the troops stationed in Siberia and Transbaikalia, including artillery, infantry, cavalry, etc., have been transferred to Vladivostok within a week. The highest members of the Military Commission in the government were ordered to go to Khabarovsk in mid-April to jointly plan everything with the Far East Political Bureau. The deployment area has been divided into four: 1. In Vladivostok, about 20,000 infantry and artillery troops are stationed. In addition to a part of the First Fleet of the Far East remaining on guard, three gunboats are sent to the northern end of Sakhalin Island to cooperate with the local army. The Second Fleet in Khabarovsk is deploying three warships to Vladivostok. 2. The headquarters of the Far East Army, Navy, and Air Force and the air force base are set up in Khabarovsk, and more than 30,000 artillery and infantry troops are deployed. 3. More than 20,000 cavalry, artillery, and infantry troops are stationed in the coastal province, with attached aircraft and tank teams. 4. About 10,000 infantry and artillery troops are stationed in North Sakhalin Island. In addition to the above troop deployments, martial law has been implemented along the Ussuri Railway and the port of Vladivostok. The inspection of Koreans and Japanese entering the country is extremely strict. Coastal fishermen are protected by warships when entering and leaving the port. Japanese fishing boats are also accompanied by warships. Japanese bridges in the coastal province will leave the country one after another on May 1, and the shops they set up will be sealed by the state, and the goods and other items will be inventoried and handed over to the Japanese consulate. On May 20, representatives of Japan and Russia will hold the final talks on the Chosen Bank. If there is a solution, the atmosphere in the Far East may be eased. Otherwise, if this situation continues, tensions will rise, and it will be difficult to avoid armed conflict. (11th)</p>
<h3>Ningxia Disaster Situation Expected to Worsen</h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Relief Organizations Urgently Seek Relief</p>
<p>Ningxia, as a northwest border region, is a hub for water and land transportation, with rivers and canals running through it, and has always been known as a prosperous region. However, since 1926, heavy troops have been stationed there repeatedly, requiring significant supplies. In addition, in 1929, it was first captured and then recovered, and the troops were exhausted from traveling back and forth. In 1930, tens of thousands of troops were appeased, and in the meantime, everything was exhausted for the transportation of fodder and grain. The people already felt a lack of food. Fortunately, people from all walks of life in the government and the military devised ways to rescue them, so that starvation was avoided. In addition, the neighboring province of Gansu has suffered from drought for more than three years, and the drought in northern Shaanxi has lasted for five years. The amount of Ningxia rice and grain transported out has increased, and the number of hungry people coming to Ningxia has also increased. As of this spring, about 40% of the farmers in Ningxia Province were unable to plant in the spring due to lack of seeds, and about 30% of the extremely poor people in the countryside had no rice to cook. Therefore, people from all walks of life in the provincial capital have established a relief association and a Chinese and foreign labor relief association, and are urgently raising donations to purchase and transport seeds and relief grain, and quickly seek relief. However, a recent survey of the disaster in the counties and villages shows that it is continuing to expand. One reason is that there is a shortage of grain due to the busy farming season in various places and the scarcity of incoming grain, which has caused the price of rice and wheat to rise day by day, and the poor cannot afford to buy it. Another reason is that tens of thousands of unemployed and poor people from Gansu and northern Shaanxi have come to Ningxia to seek a livelihood since last autumn and this spring. The population has increased sharply, and supply cannot meet demand. The townships are particularly panicked. Therefore, the recent situation is that those who stored seeds for planting last month are now cooking and eating them because of hunger. The number of villages with 40% seed loss last month has now exceeded half. The number of villages with 30% of hungry people last month has now exceeded 50%. If another two months pass, without large-scale relief, the Ningxia disaster may worsen. Therefore, the Chinese and foreign labor relief association in the province is urgently seeking relief.

<h3>Lieshan Mine Plant Harboring Bandits Case</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Confesses to Repeatedly Hiding at Bottom of Mine Shaft</p>
<p>Su, Yong, and Xiao Counties List Various Evidence</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The northern border of Su County in northern Anhui is the area of the Lieshan Coal Mine. The area is adjacent to southern Xuzhou, and its terrain is quite dangerous. It has long been occupied by notorious bandits such as Zhang Chuanwen, Sanmaohou, Wang Kunlun, and Zhou Laolao. The garrison has repeatedly suppressed and attacked them, but they have not been completely eliminated. The villages on the borders of Su County, Lingbi, Woyang, Meng, and Xiao and Tong in Xu Prefecture, and Yongcheng in Yu Prefecture have all been ravaged by bandits. Recently, the Jinpu Railway Garrison Headquarters dispatched the Gong Chaomei department of the 39th Regiment of the 7th Division to garrison in southern Xuzhou to suppress the bandits in northern Anhui. After defeating the bandits, they pursued them to the Lieshan Mine area. The bandits suddenly hid in the mine area. Commander Gong then sent Li Peng, the third battalion commander, to investigate the mine. As he approached the mine plant, bandits suddenly opened fire and shot at him, wounding Li Peng's mount. After the soldiers fought back bravely, they killed one bandit. Battalion Commander Li immediately reported the information to Commander Gong, who sent Deputy Regiment Commander Mao to investigate. The next day, more than ten bandits were captured in the mine plant. At the same time, the militia captured bandit leaders Sanmaohou, notorious bandit Zhang Mazi, Zhou San, Zheng Pigen, and others in Songzhuang, Taoxu, Huangdazhuang, and other places nearby. They confessed that they had repeatedly fled and hid at the bottom of the Lieshan Mine shaft, led by Xu Ziqin, the chief of the well workers. Commander Gong, considering the seriousness of the case, immediately reported it to the division headquarters. At that time, all walks of life in Su County were shocked by the news, and held a meeting at the Finance Bureau on the 11th, resolving: (1) To send telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Headquarters, the Supervisory Yuan, the Provincial Government, the Party Headquarters, and the Garrison Headquarters, demanding severe punishment for the mine personnel and general and deputy managers who colluded with the bandits; (2) To send telegrams to the representatives of Anhui Province to the National Conference, lodging serious protests with the Ministry of Industry; (3) To unite with the neighboring counties of Tong, Xiao, Yong, Meng, Wo, and Ling, which had suffered, to proceed in unison; (4) To expand the慰勞 for the soldiers of the 7th Division who suppressed the bandits; (5) To request the Jinpu Garrison to request the Headquarters to commend Commander Gong. At the same time, the Party Headquarters and governments of the seven counties of Su, Yong, Tong, Xiao, Wo, Meng, and Ling also issued declarations, stating that the Lieshan Coal Mine was originally founded by the late Anhui Governor Ni Sichong, and its employees and mine guards were all transferred from the Anwu Army. Originally, there was no distinction between soldiers and bandits. After 1927, the bandits gradually became rampant, using the mine plant as their stronghold and the surrounding villages of Caili, Nanzhuang, Huajiahu, Dayousi, and Laolongchun as their bases, committing rape, arson, murder, and pillaging, and raging in the seven counties of Su, Yong, Tong, Xiao, Wo, Meng, and Ling, attacking villages and destroying fortresses. Sometimes, when the military and police suppressed them, the bandits would either flee far away or hide in the Lieshan Mine. The people of the seven counties have suffered losses due to the Lieshan Coal Mine sheltering bandits over the years. Although there are no precise statistics, it is roughly estimated that no less than thousands of people have been killed or injured, and no less than five or six thousand men and women have been kidnapped for ransom. The loss of property is estimated to be more than tens of millions of yuan. Here are some recent cases reported by others and confessed by the bandits, which are supported by factual evidence: (1) According to the confessions of notorious bandit leader Sanmaohou captured in Xiao County, bandit Song Kaiyun, and bandit leaders Zhang Mazi, Zheng Pigen, Ji Qinsheng, and Zhou Xiaosan captured in Su County, Xu Jiadong, Qian, Tang Chao, Xu Ziqin, and other important employees of the mine all colluded with the bandit leaders. Notorious bandit leader Zhang Chuanwen was treated for injuries in the mine's hospital. When the incident of sniping at Commander Li of the 7th Division occurred, he was sent from the No. 4 well to the No. 8 well to hide. (2) Battalion Commander Li Peng of the Second Battalion of the 39th Regiment of the 7th Division defeated the bandits in the Laolongji area. The bandit trails suddenly disappeared after pursuing them near the coal mine. Battalion Commander Li personally led several soldiers to investigate the mine. Unexpectedly, the bandits hiding in the mine suddenly opened fire, wounding the battalion commander's mount. Battalion Commander Li narrowly escaped death. Fortunately, the soldiers were able to kill bandit leader Wei Hanzi. The remaining bandits fled south from the mine. (3) In the autumn of 1930, bandit Zhang Jieba was captured in Su County. The mine requested to temporarily bail him for questioning, but when former County Magistrate Wei sent a letter to bring him to justice, Zhang Jieba had already fled and could not be found. (4) In February 1931, the Kuangjiawa fortress, which is located next to Lieshan, was captured by bandits, and seventeen men and women and countless livestock and property were taken away. The fortress resisted for about three hours. The mine employed hundreds of mine police, who not only stood by and watched, but did not even fire a single shot. Afterwards, the ransom of 520 yuan was collected by the Nanyao counter of the mine. The victims, Kuang Yuankai, etc., have filed a complaint. (5) In March 1931, Battalion Commander Shan Shuoqing of the Su County Garrison and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Security Regiment Ren Zhennan pursued the bandits, and saw them fleeing into the mine plant. They closed the plant gate and refused to allow them to search. Shan Shuoqing and Ren Zhennan can testify to this. (6) In April 1931, when Battalion Commander Qian of the First Battalion of the 39th Regiment of the 7th Division went to Suixi to suppress the bandits, the Security Regiment captured Duan Xiazi, a member of Zhang Chuanwen's gang. The mine sent Qian Tangchao, the chief of the police department, claiming that he was an important worker of the mine, and demanded his release. When this was unsuccessful, they went on strike and threatened, and even filed a false report to the Commander-in-Chief, hoping to achieve their goal of sheltering bandits and harming the people. (7) In the summer of 1930, Zhang Chuanwen's gang robbed and kidnapped more than 100 men and women from Guanqiao and Taitou in Tongshan, and everyone knew that they started from Lieshan. (8) In April 1930, the six-year-old son of Zhu Zhaokun of Zhu Zhuang in Su County was found in the abandoned kiln east of the mine. In April of the same year, a woman surnamed Yang from Fang Zhuang in Su County and a woman surnamed Cai from Zhenxi Nanmen outside the mine ran back from the abandoned kiln near the mine. In May of the same year, Li Yongjin from Hekou Dongji Hedongwei in Su County was killed by bandits dozens of steps after leaving the mine. In October of the same year, Chen Yunming from Zhangzhai Yongqingji in Zhenxi District of Su County was kidnapped in the mine and his body was never found. The above facts are only the most obvious ones, and it is impossible to list even one ten-thousandth of them. Relying on the name of the Central Government, they recklessly shelter bandits and harm the people, causing the people of the seven counties of Su, Yong, Tong, Xiao, Wo, Meng, and Ling to lose their property, families, and become displaced. Their crimes are unforgivable. Our seven counties have sent telegrams to Chairman Jiang of the National Government, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Jiang, President of the Supervisory Yuan, Minister of Industry, and Commander of the 7th Division, requesting that the mine director Xu Jiadong, police chief Qian Tangchao, and worker chief Xu Ziqin be punished as soon as possible to uphold national law, and that the mine be ordered to pay compensation to the victimized people. At the same time, the mine should be thoroughly reorganized and rectified to eliminate the source of the disaster and ensure the safety and security of the people forever. Fearing that the responsible personnel of the mine, knowing that their crimes are heinous and that they cannot escape the law, will fabricate false statements and deceive their superiors, making it difficult to thoroughly resolve the situation, we list the facts here and appeal to all levels of Party headquarters, all levels of officials, and all compatriots, pleading for their united assistance to eliminate this great harm. We cannot express our gratitude and hopes enough! (16th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Bandits Attack West and Flee East</h3>
<p>Guo Mafeng Gang Flees Back to Mengshan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The bandits in southern Shandong were originally divided into two gangs, Mengshan and Baodugu. At the beginning of the government army's encirclement and suppression, the bandits in Mengshan were cleared first, and then Baodugu was surrounded. Recently, the encirclement has become increasingly tighter, and the bandits have made a final struggle. Bandit leader Guo Mafeng took the opportunity to lead six or seven hundred men back to Mengshan. The remaining bandits gathered after hearing the news, and their momentum was quite rampant. Currently, Liu Shuxiang, the chief of staff of the Third Route Army in Teng County, has strictly ordered the departments of Gu Liangmin, Chen Yaohan, and Ma Tengjiao to jointly block and suppress the bandits with the department of Wang Wanqing, the commander-in-chief of the Shandong militia, in order to eliminate them as soon as possible. Here is the latest bulletin from the chief of staff: (1) According to the report of Division Commander Gu, and the telegram of Brigade Commander Tang, more than ten women and children were found in Xiyangjiaquan.

The remaining industries that had not reported, as well as households outside the chamber, and the four rural areas would amount to only about 40,000 yuan in total. The question was how to handle this. After discussion, the chairman put to a vote whether or not each industry should undertake the assessment. The motion to undertake the assessment was unanimously approved. Then, the issue of increasing the assessment amount was discussed. It was resolved that each industry should convene meetings of their respective trades and report back to the chamber by the 19th of this month. Next, a proposal was made to organize a review committee to review the contract amounts. It was resolved that in addition to the standing committee members Qian Sunqing and five others as ex-officio members, ten reviewers would be appointed to form a review committee to review the tax rates reported by each industry and decide to hold a review meeting on the afternoon of the 21st of this month. Second, a letter from the county government was reported, ordering the issuance of business overview survey forms. It was resolved that the forms should be printed and distributed to each business for completion and submission to the chamber for compilation and forwarding to the government. Third, a report was given on the Shanghai fundraising telegram for the temporary emergency relief for the Shaanxi disaster and 20 donation registers. The question was how to solicit donations. It was decided by public vote that each industry should enthusiastically solicit donations. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Exhumation for Re-examination in Suspected Death Case: A suspected death case occurred near Luoyang Town, Sixth District, Wu County. The body was examined and collected by the court.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Case of Robbery on the River and Murder: The four robbers who robbed the Xinzhuang and Luyuan ships, Chen Er, Wang Xiao Lao Han, Wu Daquan, and Sun Da Jizi, have all been captured or surrendered, except for Sun Da Jizi, who is still at large. They have confessed to the robbery of the two ships. However, the bandits also confessed that Chen Er and others had committed a murder case in Suzhou, namely, Sun Da Jizi, who has not been captured, was killed by Chen Er, which is why he cannot be found. Sun Da Jizi was from Yancheng. Previously, he was sentenced to one year in prison by the Wuxian District Court for injuring someone in the area bordering Suzhou and Wuxi. Sun had a wife, Zhou, and three sons. After Sun was imprisoned, Zhou developed a relationship with Chen and lived together as if they were husband and wife. In the middle of the first month of the lunar calendar this year, Sun's sentence was completed. Chen Er bailed Sun out and they still lived together. Soon, Sun became aware of the relationship between Chen and Zhou. Because of their friendship and because Chen had bailed him out of prison, Sun did not confront Chen. In late last month, Chen recruited accomplices Wu Daquan and Wang Xiao Lao Han to Changshu, planning to steal chickens. When the boat reached Huqiao, they encountered two ships and immediately acted to rob them. Afterwards, they returned to Suzhou to divide the loot and spend it. At this time, Sun Da Jizi thought that his wife had been occupied by someone else for too long and decided to reclaim Zhou. Chen deliberately delayed. On May 7th, Chen invited Jiang Xiao Liu Zi, Sun Da Jizi, and Zhou to eat and drink on a boat. The boat sailed from Loumen in Suzhou and Chen got Sun Da Jizi drunk. Then, Chen and his wife Zhou murdered Sun and threw his body into the lake to cover up the crime. Afterwards, Chen, Jiang Xiao Liu Zi, Zhou, and others sailed the boat to Changshu. At that time, the accomplice Wu Daquan, because the authorities were strictly pursuing ship robbers, surrendered to the Thirteenth Team as an informant and designed to lure and capture Chen and Jiang. Now, the Thirteenth Team of the Water Police, considering the seriousness of the case, sent the entire group of criminals to the Suzhou Water Police District Headquarters for review on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Second Day Boy Scout Grand Camp</h3>
<p>Morning Formal Review</p>
<p>The 17th was the second day of the Jiangsu Provincial Boy Scout Grand Camp. Around 9:00 AM, a formal grand review was held at the sports field. The weather was overcast that day, but many guests and spectators attended. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival at the Field　At 9:00 AM, Boy Scouts from various counties, totaling 143 troops and 4,135 people, assembled at the camp outside the South Gate. Led by Chief Commander Zhu Chongming, they marched to the Renzhang Road Sports Field, a winding distance of about two li (approximately 0.6 miles). After entering the field, they paraded around the perimeter for half an hour before completing the procession. They then divided into columns, surrounding the entire field.</p>
<p>Attendees　Attendees included Zhang Yuanyang and Cao Minghuan of the Provincial Party Reorganization Committee, Sun Mingzhe, He Yushu, Chen Hexian, and Li Mingyang of the Provincial Government Committee, Jin Tigan representing Chairman Ye, Li Qingshi representing Superintendent Zhang, Shi Weihuan representing the Central Training Department, Zhang Zhongren representing the Headquarters of the Chinese Boy Scouts, as well as guests from all walks of life and spectators, totaling nearly 10,000 people.</p>
<p>Salute and Review　At 10:00 AM, music was played, the flag was raised, and the Party song was sung. Chairman Zhang Yuanyang led everyone in paying the highest respect to the national flag, Party flag, and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Then, the testament of Dr. Sun Yat-sen was respectfully read aloud in unison. After three minutes of silence, a march-past commenced. The number of participating troops and personnel was reported, first by the squad leaders to the troop leaders, then by the troop leaders to the division commanders, then by the division commanders to the chief commander, and finally by the chief commander to the reviewing officer. The Provincial Party and Government Committee members and guests then descended from the reviewing stand and slowly inspected the troops, making a circuit of the field. The Boy Scouts then performed a marching formation, proceeding past the reviewing stand in step. At that moment, the heavens turned unfavorable, with light rain falling, but the boy and girl scouts did not mind, their uniforms and movements remaining neat and synchronized, and their spirits were particularly bright. After the drills, they formed three columns, assembled in front of the stand, and listened respectfully to the address.</p>
<p>Summary of the Address　(1) First, Zhang Yuanyang, Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, reported on the significance of the grand review, stating that based on numerical comparisons, the efforts of the past year showed that the number of participants last year was less than 1,000, while this year's participants numbered 4,135, an increase of fourfold. In terms of organization, councils have been established in various counties, and the number of instructors has increased. However, it is hoped that the Boy Scouts can occupy an important position in education, becoming the backbone of public training, and that efforts should be made in the following three areas: (A) continuing to cultivate talented cadres, (B) completing the establishment of councils in various counties and organizing a provincial council, and (C) embodying the spirit of young soldiers to become good citizens. (2) Shi Weihuan, representative of the Central Training Department, delivered a speech, expressing his satisfaction with the excellent results of this camp and the full display of the Boy Scout spirit. He expressed four hopes: first, to promote rural Boy Scouts; second, to extend from schools to society, serving the people; third, to pay attention to construction work; and fourth, that Jiangsu Province should establish a council to direct the Boy Scout movement in various counties. Next, Jin Tigan, representing Chairman Ye of the Provincial Government, Chen Hexian, Director of the Education Department, and Li Qingshi, representing Superintendent Zhang, also delivered speeches, offering much encouragement.</p>
<p>Cheers and Dismissal　The address concluded at 12:00 noon. Then, the Boy Scout song was sung, with everyone joining in a melodious sound. Finally, they shouted "Long live the Republic of China, long live the Kuomintang, long live the Chinese Boy Scouts!" and tossed their hats, dispersing and returning to the camp in the light rain.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Publishes "One Thousand Character Course on the Three Principles of the People"</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received an order from the Central Government to compile a "One Thousand Character Course on the Three Principles of the People" for use in national public schools. The Ministry immediately compiled two provisional editions of the "One Thousand Character Course on the Three Principles of the People" according to the editing guidelines set by the Central Training Department. Each edition consisted of four volumes, with the "A" edition being more advanced for higher grades and the "B" edition being simpler for elementary grades. The selection of materials was centered on the Three Principles of the People, and based on the readers' needs and comprehension abilities, it incorporated common knowledge of national morality, history, geography, and natural hygiene, arranged in a comprehensive manner with illustrations to make it more engaging. After being reviewed and approved by the Central Training Department, the Ministry added phonetic symbols and submitted it to the printing bureau for typesetting and detailed proofreading. It has now been published and will be distributed to various locations for use. The Ministry previously announced nine regulations for the imitation and printing of the "One Thousand Character Course on the Three Principles of the People," allowing various bookstores to imitate and print it. However, bookstores wishing to do so must submit an application along with two copies of the sample to the Ministry of Education for approval before it can be distributed.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Zhongshan University Reorganized into a High School</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, has reorganized Xi'an Zhongshan University into a provincial senior high school. The report stated that Xi'an Zhongshan University was reorganized from Northwest University, and as of the winter break of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), it only had five classes in the first and second years of senior high school and two classes in the specialized departments of law and political economics. The students in the specialized departments were all at the junior high school graduate level, so although it was called a specialized department, it was no different from a senior high school in reality. The name did not match the reality, and it did not conform to the organization of a university. It has now been reorganized into a provincial senior high school, directly under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education. The original students in the first and second years of senior high school will be assigned to the first year of the senior high school general course and the preparatory class according to their level. Students in the specialized departments will be assigned to the first year of the senior high school commercial course. In addition to newly recruited students, the teaching policy, except for the commercial course, will especially focus on natural sciences in the preparatory class and the senior high school general course, as a basis for opening industrial and agricultural courses in the next academic year and for preparing for the establishment of industrial and agricultural vocational schools in the future, which is also to meet the needs of Shaanxi Province. The Ministry of Education instructed that, after investigating and reporting on the current situation of the university, it should be reorganized into a senior high school to conform to reality. The teaching policy stated in the report, focusing on natural sciences as a basis for opening industrial and agricultural courses in the next academic year and for preparing for the establishment of industrial and agricultural vocational schools in the future, is quite suitable for the current needs of the province and is approved as a proposal. However, the previous plan to open a college of arts and sciences should still be gradually prepared by the Department, taking into account the local economic situation, in order to achieve it. The above is hereby notified.</p>

<p>Starting from the intersection of Carter Road and Jing'an Temple Road, passing through Jing'an Temple Road, entering Jessfield Road, Brenan Road, crossing Route Ghisi to Tunsin Road, heading south on Columbia Road, heading west on Amherst Avenue, returning to Route Ghisi and reaching Hungjao Road, heading north on Haig Avenue, passing through Avenue Joffre, Route Cardinal Mercier, Avenue Petain, heading west on Rue Foochow, Avenue Haig, heading north on Route Say Zoong and entering the China Athletic Field, a total distance of twelve miles.</p>
<h3>Starting Gun</h3>
<p>Starting at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, spectators began arriving at the intersection of Carter Road and Jing'an Temple Road. By 7:30 AM, it was already extremely crowded. Chinese and foreign detectives and Boy Scouts were maintaining order. At the sound of eight o'clock, the racers gathered, lined up in rows of forty according to their numbers. The starter ordered preparation, the white line was released, and at the sound of the starting gun, more than five hundred strong legs strode forward, a mighty and overwhelming force, heading straight for Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<h3>Conditions Along the Route</h3>
<p>Side-by-Side Advance in Front of Jing'an Temple</p>
<p>More than ten minutes after the start, the main group had reached the front of Jing'an Temple, all full of extraordinary spirit. They chased each other, and the distances between them were not very large. The leading three were Shi Jinsheng, Xie Xingdao, and Zhang Quanzhou, advancing side by side. A few steps behind, Liu Xiangkun, Wang Zhaoxiang, and Zhang Zhaohai closely followed. Hou Genren, Ding Xinggen, and the remaining 230-odd people followed in a long line.</p>
<p>Leaping Tigers and Soaring Dragons at Zhaofeng Garden</p>
<p>Turning onto Jessfield Road, they had reached the front of Zhaofeng Garden, a distance of two miles. At 8:26 AM, Shi Jinsheng had passed first. Although Zhang Quanzhou was unwilling to give up and seemed to be struggling, he was gradually falling behind. The veterans Xie Xingdao and Liu Xiangkun strode forward, surpassing Zhang. Shi was about 80 meters ahead of Xie, and Liu was 20 meters behind. Zhang Quanzhou and Wang Zhaoxiang could only follow. Cheng Xuan and Hou Genren came along leisurely. Behind them were Ling Baorong, Liu Shanfu, Yang Jun, Wang Shidi, Zhang Zhaohai, Jiang Luchun, Wei Kaijin, Chen Lianjie, Huang Xiongfu, Zhang Xianlun, Zhou Heming, and others.</p>
<p>Difficult Steps and Groaning Athletes</p>
<p>After passing Zhaofeng Garden, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway came into view. Along the railway was Route Ghisi, with uneven and undulating muddy ground, with depressions as deep as holes and heights like mounds. Driving was difficult, let alone walking. Although the racers did not say anything, they were all groaning. Entering Tunsin Road, it gradually became flat.</p>
<p>Veteran Slows Pace Halfway</p>
<p>From Tunsin Road, passing Columbia Road and Amherst Avenue, and re-entering Route Ghisi, it was halfway, a distance of six miles. At 8:53 AM, Shi Jinsheng arrived first. Xie Xingdao was about 250 meters behind, and Liu Xiangkun was 200 meters behind. Zhang Quanzhou was 150 meters behind them. Behind them were Cheng Xuan, Liu Shanfu, Wang Zhaoxiang, Hou Genren, Jiang Luchun, Yang Jun, Ling Peng, Ling Baorong, Feng Zineng, Tang Xin, and others.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University: Rising Dragons</p>
<p>Heading south again on Route Ghisi, heading west on Hungjao Road, the road was flat and the trees were shady. Haig Avenue had reached Jiaotong University, a distance of eight miles, two-thirds of the entire route. Shi Jinsheng was still 200 meters ahead of Xie Xingdao. He passed here at 9:10 AM. 800 meters behind was Liu Xiangkun, and 400 meters behind him was Zhang Quanzhou. 50 meters further back, Liu Shanfu and Wang Zhaoxiang were advancing side by side. Ling Baorong suddenly took the lead and had caught up, with an extraordinary aura, knowing he was no ordinary person. Yang Jun and Hou Genren followed him. 20 feet behind were Jiang Luchun, Ling Peng, and Zhou Heming.</p>
<p>Tense Atmosphere on Rue Foochow</p>
<p>Passing Avenue Petain, Rue Foochow was faintly visible ahead, a distance of ten miles, only one-sixth of the distance from the finish line. Success or failure depended on this. Changes gradually arose, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Shi Jinsheng passed the ten-mile mark at 9:30 AM. Xie Xingdao quickened his pace, only a hundred meters behind Shi. Liu Xiangkun fell behind, while Cheng Xuan was in front. Ling Baorong had overtaken four people in a row and suddenly took the lead in the race group. The time was 9:37 AM. The remaining personnel were as follows: Zhang Quanzhou, Ling Peng, and Liu Shanfu were advancing side by side. Yang Jun, Wang Zhaoxiang, Jin Guisheng, Zhou Heming, Yu Dingan, Feng Zineng, and others followed, heading towards Avenue Haig. The China Athletic Field was in sight.</p>
<p>Posture Important, All Efforts Wasted</p>
<p>No. 160 Zhang Quanzhou, judging from his passage along the way, had always been in the lead, but gradually fell behind in the final stage. When he reached the finish line, the referees decided to disqualify him because he was found to be running and jumping on the road. Therefore, the walking posture is very important, and racers should know how to improve it.</p>
<h3>Champion Arrives</h3>
<p>The end point of the race was inside the China Athletic Field. The national flag was hung high at the entrance, and the Boy Scouts maintained order around the field. The award stand was located in the west corner of the field, and the stage was full of prizes, dazzlingly beautiful. The large stands in the northwest and southwest corners were packed with people, extremely lively and orderly, a rare sight. Racers had to circle the field to the left after entering, with the finish line located five meters from the award stand. A female Boy Scout band sat behind the award stand, and when racers entered the field and reached the finish line, the music filled the air, welcoming them. Tea, water, and snacks were prepared in the basketball room, exclusively for the racers to quench their thirst and hunger. Guests and staff were not entertained.</p>
<p>Shi Jinsheng Lived Up to His Name Around 9:40 AM, the spectators in the west stand applauded in unison. Soon after, two racers entered the field one after the other, three meters apart. Looking at them, Shi Jinsheng was in front, and Xie Xingdao was behind. At this time, Xie showed his ambition and exerted his strength under his feet, thinking of tasting the taste of the championship. However, Shi Jinsheng moved like a dragon, leading the way with full spirit. When he reached the finish line, he was fifty meters ahead of Xie. Shi's time was 1 hour, 46 minutes, 20 seconds, and Xie arrived twelve seconds later. Five minutes and thirteen seconds later, the third place Cheng Xuan arrived. The three above were all outstanding performers in the exhibition race.</p>
<p>Ling Baorong Bravely Won the Championship Not long after, two racers came into view, Liu Xiangkun appeared first, followed closely by Ling Baorong. Ling was the first of the official racers to find a new continent. His arm movements were appropriate, his leg movements were organized, he held his head high and his chest out, and he had the aura of an invincible hero. The effort in the last fifty meters further aroused the interest of the audience, and the applause deafened. Ling's pace became even faster, and the situation gradually weakened, and he overpassed and arrived first, with a result of one hour fifty-three minutes and thirty-two seconds, winning the championship of the conference, the runner-up Ling Peng arrived six seconds later, and the third Liu Shanfu, the fourth was originally Zhang Quanzhou, but his qualification was cancelled due to a foul, so Wang Zhaoxiang rose to fourth place. Wang Mengmao, who was fourteen years old, had a score of two hours and five minutes, while Ge Zhonggao, who was forty-one years old, arrived in 74th place, and Yang Changkang, who was fourteen years old, was after the 80th place.</p>

The purpose of joining was to serve as a model for the latercomers, guiding them forward. Therefore, Zhang Zaojiu and Hou Genren guided them in the back, and they could not be divided by ranking. Shi Jinsheng tried his best to create new results in the front, and his painstaking efforts are commendable.</p>
<p>Boy Scouts' Hard Work Yesterday, on the distant twelve-mile journey, in addition to the Chinese and Western detectives, who cooperated to maintain order, the entire line was guarded by male Boy Scouts. There was not a single place without Boy Scouts. The service groups were as follows: East Asia Sports College, Lizhi Primary School, Guangzhao Public School, Guangzhao Righteous School, Guanghua, Moore Hall, Nanyang, Fuzhong, Shangzhong, Xinhua, Southeast Women's Sports, Liangjiang Women's Sports, Pudong, Patriotic Girls' School, Yucai Jingwu, etc., eighteen groups.</p>

<h3>Industry and Commerce Football Tournament: Bing Gong Wins Group Championship</h3>
<p>Jian Guang Wins Same Group Championship</p>
<p>The results of the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Football Tournament are as follows:</p>
<p>Group　Team Win/Loss　Score</p>
<p>Enjoy Commerce　Strong B Wins Zhong Gong　1-0</p>
<p>Enjoy Industry　Huili Wins Shao Nian　3-1</p>
<p>Enjoy Character　Bing Gong Wins Ying Gong　1-0</p>
<p>Same Character　Jian Guang Wins Ye Shi　3-1</p>
<p>Jian Character　Taigu Wins Zhufeng　1-0</p>
<p>Of the five games, except for the first and second games, which had little to do with the championship, the other three games were the finals for Bing Gong and Ying Gong, and Jian Guang and Ye Shi. Taigu and Zhufeng were in the first battle of a triangular elimination tournament. Among them, the two final games were of course the most exciting. The brief details are as follows: Bing Gong Wins Enjoy Group Championship　Ying Gong was the overlord of the Enjoy Commerce Group, and Bing Gong was the overlord of the Enjoy Industry Group. One day of confrontation, it was difficult to hold both and contend. Ying Gong's lines of communication were connected, and the momentum was better than Bing Gong. Unfortunately, the god of victory was unwilling to descend, and Bing Gong scored a goal in ten minutes. After that, although the counterattack continued, there was an image of a mountain rain coming, but it dissipated in an instant, and in the end, it was runner-up with a score of one to zero.</p>
<p>Jian Guang Wins Same Group Championship　At 2:00 PM, the Jian Guang, a mighty army of the Same Commerce Group, clashed with Ye Shi, a mighty army of the Same Industry Group. In the first half, Ye Shi was extremely sharp and scored a goal, continuing to attack. At the beginning of the second half, Jian Guang's fortunes gradually turned, and in no time, they retaliated with a goal, resulting in a tie. After that, they attacked and defended alternately, stalemateing. When the time was up, they continued to fight for ten minutes, and within these ten minutes, Jian Guang scored two goals, winning the championship. It can be said that their physical strength was actually better than that of Ye Shi.</p>

<h3>Trivialities of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>— Xiafei, from Beijing</p>
<p>The splendid and solemn National Assembly has opened as scheduled amidst the cheers of the masses. This is truly an unprecedented event in our country. The important matters have been reported in various newspapers. Here are some trivial news from the meeting place, to fill Free Talk.</p>
<p>Busy Central Figures Writing Inscriptions: National Assembly representatives have prepared albums to preserve memories. During breaks, they request inscriptions from central figures to leave a lasting mark. During the fourth meeting on the 12th, Central Committee member Chu Minyi wrote "Promote sports and cultivate a healthy citizenry" for a certain representative, showing Chu's enthusiasm for promoting sports. During the sixth meeting on the 14th, Li Shizeng was particularly surrounded. Those seeking inscriptions were endless. Li wrote everything in one stroke. Inscriptions included "The world is for all," "Love and sincerity," "Mutual assistance," "Universal love," "Everyone does their best," and so on. One representative even asked for an eulogy for his deceased father. Li also wrote "Legacy remains" and gave it to him. Others sought inscriptions from Cai Yuanpei, Shao Lizi, and Yu Jingtang, but not as many as Li.</p>
<p>Female Representatives in the Meeting Place: This time, the women elected as National Assembly representatives include Liu Chunyi, Shi Zhiying, Li Zhishan, Deng Huifang, and others. Ten people including Tang Guozhen and Tan Sheying were specially permitted to attend as observers, attracting the attention of the entire venue. Liu Chunyi was even elected as one of the members of the presidium. They proposed many motions, all seeking absolute equality between men and women. During the fourth meeting, Li Zhishan gave a detailed discussion on the eradication of red bandits, which was to the point and highly praised by the meeting. Shi Zhiying also held a proposal during the break and went back and forth between the representatives, requesting signatures. Her appearance was extremely hurried. The proposed plan to establish universal childcare centers is truly a key plan to reduce the suffering of agricultural and industrial women and promote production and development. This type of facility has been implemented in Europe and the United States for a long time. In China, which is backward in production, the need is even more urgent. Shi is truly a person with a heart.</p>
<p>Diligence of the Presidium Members: Dai Jitao in the presidium is experienced in parliamentary procedures. His handling of cases is orderly and organized. During the fourth meeting, the entire Provisional Constitution was passed, resolving everything satisfactorily in just two hours. This is truly commendable. Yu Youren's speech and demeanor are far from ordinary. However, he speaks in Qin dialect, which is not very clear to those in the audience. Zhang Xueliang, Liu Chunyi, and others are also writing at their desks, also working hard.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui's Short Article</h3>
<p>— Someone</p>
<p>Recently visited Ding Fubao. Saw that Ding has recently compiled over one hundred and thirty volumes of Shuowen Gu Lin Supplement, which is not yet finished. Mr. Wu Zhihui wrote the plaque for his editorial office, calling it Gu Lin Jing She, and wrote the following inscription: "Mr. Zhonghu is erudite and proficient in philology and also fond of Chan philosophy. Over the years, he has comprehensively studied Mr. Xu's book and created two huge compilations, Shuowen Gu Lin, which will benefit the art world. He is comparable to Yizheng and Changsha and more than that. Mr. Gu is escaping Buddhism and hiding in a mirage, like Huilin's hidden cultivation. He uses his remaining energy to study the sounds and meanings of various classics. His charm is similar. He inscribed the small building as Gu Lin Jing She to express his intentions. His friend Wu Jingheng wrote the seal for it."</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Difficult Diseases</h3>
<p>— Ban Kuang</p>
<p>Mr. Fang Shen'an is a devoted disciple of the miraculous acupuncturist Mr. Huang Shiping. After Mr. Shiping passed away, Mr. Fang served in the military and did not use acupuncture for a long time. As a result, people in Shanghai who admired Mr. Shiping's acupuncture skills regretted that it was lost. Two years ago, Mr. Fang resigned and lived in Shanghai. Friends then persuaded him to save people with acupuncture. After setting up his practice, there were countless cases of difficult and miscellaneous diseases that were cured with one needle from Mr. Fang. The most notable case was a woman who suffered from ascites. With one needle from Mr. Fang, she vomited a poisonous viper (shaped like a small snake, not sure if this is the name). The illness was immediately cured. This poisonous object is still preserved in a bottle in Mr. Fang's medical office. Another example is Mr. Shi Jingshan, who suffered from madness, Mr. Qiu Zijia, who had a foot disease, and Mr. Yu Yifen, who had a hunched back, were all cured by Mr. Fang's acupuncture. Recently, I personally witnessed Mr. Fang diagnose and treat two difficult cases, which were particularly admirable. One case was the son of Mr. Chen Cangzhou. He was just over a month old. A month ago, his legs suddenly hurt and he could not stand. He was first diagnosed by a Western doctor (Mr. Chen is a student who studied in England and is a firm believer in Western medicine). However, the doctor said that the illness was severe and could not name the disease, and also said that even if it could be cured, the legs would be crippled. An X-ray was taken, and it was said that there was no way to treat the leg disease. Later, a friend of Chen, Mr. Huang Zhusheng, introduced him to Mr. Fang's clinic in Heye Lane, Xinzha Road, for acupuncture treatment. Fang diagnosed it as a febrile disease. Sure enough, he recovered in a few days. Another case was breast cancer. Both Chinese and Western doctors have determined that it is a difficult disease to treat. It is mostly due to liver stagnation. Even Western medical dissection may not be able to cure it completely. There was a Mr. Zhang from Zhejiang and Hubei, who was already sixty years old. He suddenly developed breast cancer. He consulted other doctors, but it was ineffective for two years. Later, he was also introduced by a friend to Mr. Fang's clinic for acupuncture treatment. He recovered shortly after. Mr. Zhang's son specially presented a silver shield with the inscription "Divine Acupuncture Saves the World" to express his gratitude. Mr. Fang's acupuncture skills are truly worthy of record.</p>
<h3>Returning from a Spring Trip</h3>
<p>— Shen Tingkai</p>
<p>Good spring passes quickly, and travel interests wane. This year's spring travel itinerary took me to various places including Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi. Now that I have returned, I will describe what I have seen to send to Shoujuan.</p>
<p>South Lake is a famous scenic spot in Jiaxing, and Yanyu Tower is especially famous. Since ancient times, great ministers and famous figures who have visited Yanyu Tower have left their mark. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty stayed there twice, so there are many inscriptions. Peng Xueqin, Imperial Guardian, wrote a horizontal and a vertical plum blossom, which were engraved on a stele in Baomei Pavilion. There is a poem that says, "Saying goodbye to the hermitage of Gushan, I come again to the waters of Hezhu. The charming governor is very sentimental, laughing and asking for plum blossoms towards the water's edge." The tower is surrounded by water on all sides and planted with many famous flowers and exotic plants. In the past, the boat girls of South Lake were famous for singing songs while boating on the lake, which was passed down as a romantic story. Now, due to restrictions, it has gradually declined. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, visited this place in the early years of the Republic of China, the first thing he saw after crossing the lake to the tower was the horizontal plaque "Mr. Sun Yat-sen visited here in the first year of the Republic of China," which made people feel the greatness of the man and the beauty of the scenery for thousands of years. It has been five years since I last visited this tower. I feel that the waves are still safe and sound, but I sigh that the people have changed. Climbing the tower and looking into the distance, I am filled with emotion.</p>
<p>From Jiaxing to Tongxiang, it takes three hours. The bus first arrives at Shuangqiao, and then you enter the city by ferry. To the west of Shuangqiao, there is a temple of General Zhong from the Ming Dynasty. Although the area is a remote village, it occupies a very glorious page in the ancient war history of our country. During the Ming Dynasty, when the Japanese army invaded Zhejiang for a long time, they suffered a major defeat in Shuangqiao, which is the Battle of Tielingguan in history. Entering Tongxiang City, I visited the scenic spots such as Ruan Stone Bridge and Fengming Temple. A certain county magistrate is committed to the construction of the county and has worked hard. Therefore, the scale is very complete. The famous doctors in Shanghai, Cheng Zhihe and Cheng Dunsheng, are both from Tongxiang. They happened to be in Tongxiang at the time, so I was able to spend two days with them. The county magistrate heard that Mr. Cheng had returned to his hometown and visited the Cheng residence, planning to establish a civilian hospital. The matter is still under discussion, but the local officials and local gentry's concern for the common people is worth mentioning in my travelogue. I did not visit West Lake in Hangzhou, but went to Fuchun. The boat passed the Liuhe Pagoda and gradually entered the Fuchun River. The water was as clear as a mirror for hundreds of miles, as if I were in a painting. The green water and green mountains, leisurely in the middle of the stream, truly give a feeling of wanting to become an immortal. After arriving in Tonglu, I stayed overnight and visited Qililong. I had never visited this place before. I had heard friends strongly praise the beauty of Fuchun. Now that I have visited the place, I believe it. Last year, I traveled east to Japan and visited the scenic spots of that country. I deeply lamented that there was no place in China that knew about it. Now that I have entered Qililong, I feel that we are better than them. The Yan Ziling Fishing Terrace, which is famous, and the Xie Gao Cry Terrace stand opposite each other in the east and west. There are pavilions on the terraces. The west pavilion has a large stele with the inscription "The Breeze is Eternal." There are ancient sites in the mountains such as the Yan Xian Sheng Temple and the Kexing Tower. It is a pity that the boat was slow that day, and it was past noon when I arrived at the mountain, and there were few tourists, so I regret that I could not fully enjoy the beautiful scenery. Tonglu has a delicious dish called peach blossom mandarin fish, which is no less than the perch of Songjiang. As for the beautiful mountains and rivers on the Fuchun River, I regret that I have no words to describe them in writing, but the quiet and elegant charm still lingers in my mind.</p>
<p>During the trip to Suzhou and Wuxi, the fellow travelers were the accountants Li Zutong, Qiu Chu Lian, and Li Chenghong and Feng Xigeng from Shanghai. In two days, we visited the famous scenic spots such as Tianping, Huqiu, Lion Grove, Wang Yizhuang, and Yiyuan. Most of them were revisits, so there is nothing to describe. In another two days, we visited Liangxi and the places such as Yuantouzhu, Meiyuan, Liyuan, and Huishan. The purpose of our trip to Suzhou and Wuxi was to eat. Viewing scenery and visiting gardens were just a matter of adapting to the occasion. Mr. Li Zutong can eat two trotters in one meal, which not only greatly enhances the color of the fellow travelers, but also surprises the restaurant. Mr. Li still laments that he is not as good as his uncle Li Wuye's capacity for alcohol. (Mr. Li Zhengwu) On the day of our return, Mr. Li Chenghong and others were going to Lake Tai from Wuxi. Chenghong is the young owner of the famous Taoyuan scenic spot in Wuxing. He strongly urged us to go to the Three Wu together, but I did not finish it due to business. With the sound of a whistle, we bid farewell to each other in the waving of handkerchiefs. (Que Chou)</p>
<p>Publishing Industry News: Xun Huisheng is one of the four famous dan actors of modern times. His art is similar to Mei, Shang, and Cheng, and each has reached its peak. He is also young and strong, and eager to learn, which is something that other famous dan actors cannot match. Mr. Liu Huogong, the director of the "Drama Monthly" of the Datong Bookstore, in view of this, has decided to publish a "Xun Huisheng Special Issue" in the eighth issue of the third volume of the magazine. Also, because Ju Peng is a strong general of the Tan School, a "Yan Jupeng Special Issue" will be attached to the front, as in the case of the combined publication of Yanchou and Shaolou. Those who have articles about Xun and Yan should send them to the magazine within ten days. The remuneration will be generous. After the deadline, I am afraid it will be too late to publish them.</p>
<p>Around the Yellow Sea Travel Notes (6)</p>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>The so-called East Line goes from Shenyang through Hailong to Jilin. From now on, the traffic between the cities of Liaoning and Jilin provinces does not have to go through Jichang and South Manchuria. The so-called West Line goes from Dahushan on the Beining Road through Tongliao, Taonan to Qiqihar. Further north it has reached Keshan. Soon it will reach Nenjiang. - Another branch road is being built from Taonan to Solun. It has not yet arrived. - From now on, Qiqihar can reach the interior without going through the Middle East and South Manchuria. These two roads pass through areas that are very rich in agricultural and forest products. The construction of the port of Huludao is in progress. Once completed, the West Line can freely enter and exit the sea. This is such a pleasant thing. Moreover, the South Manchuria Railway uses gold, and this West Road uses silver. Gold is expensive and silver is cheap. Isn't this a good opportunity to develop these two roads? However, financiers tell me that business on the West Road is very bad. Not only can loans not be repaid with interest, but even expenses are not enough. Why? It is said that it is still due to poor management methods. If so, this is something that should be improved as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>There is another issue in the negotiations between Dong Province and Japan, which is Korean immigrants. Japan moves its own people to southern Korea. The people of southern Korea move to the north. The people of northern Korea move to Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Currently, the number of Koreans who have moved into the two provinces has reached two million. Their policies are very clever. On the one hand, they solve the problem of overpopulation in their own country. On the other hand, they use the difficulty of resolving the nationality issue of Koreans as pioneers in obtaining land lease rights in Manchuria and Mongolia. Therefore, local officials in Dong Province are very concerned about Korean affairs. All kinds of entanglements and arrogance are stopped. The Japanese then provoke and instigate them to strengthen their inclination towards Japan and provide them with opportunities for exploitation.</p>
<p>When I traveled to Dong Province, I saw that all the people planting rice in the countryside were Koreans. I asked if rice was good. They replied yes. I asked why the locals don't grow it. They replied that they don't know how to grow it. Only Koreans know how to grow it. At a time when soybeans are in surplus, should local people be encouraged to switch to other crops? If a certain place has water, should it be designated as a rice-growing area? What methods should be used to recruit people from inside the pass who are accustomed to growing rice to promote or guide rice growing? And don't let Koreans specialize in rice growing. Isn't this a policy that the government should confirm and implement step by step?</p>
<p>Rotary Club Novel</p>
<h3>The Hawthorne Detective Agency Turns a Corner (17)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>She lowered her head and thought for a moment, shaking her head and answering, "I don't know him. There were many male guests yesterday. I only knew less than a tenth of them. I didn't notice such a person." I said, "Think again. Among the male guests you know, is there anyone with such a appearance and attire?" Peifen said, "Really not. I remember that only the cousin of the Jiang family, the younger uncle of the Wang family, and the older brother of my classmate Baozhu, as well as two neighbors from the Qin family and the Ouyang family across the street, were wearing suits. Their ages seemed similar, but their figures and faces were different." I hurriedly said, "What's the name of that older brother of your classmate Baozhu?" Peifen said, "His surname is Jiang, and his name is Jingyuan. He also studies at Jiangsu University. He's a year above me. Baozhu is in the same class as me." I continued, "Where does this Jiang Jingyuan live? Do you remember what time he left last night?" Peifen said, "They live on Hongqiao Road. They left together last night. By that time, most of the men's seats in the hall had dispersed. Besides, he's a tall and thin person, much taller than you. We secretly gave him a nickname, called White Impermanence. How could this person match the person you're talking about?" I couldn't help but be disappointed again. Suddenly, another new question came to mind. I suddenly asked, "Among your male classmates, is there such a person?" Peifen thought for a moment and answered, "That's hard to say. I can't remember many." I said, "Then, among your male classmates who are closer to you, is there anyone with a similar appearance?" Peifen's cheeks turned slightly red, and she asked me in return, "Brother-in-law, what do you mean by closer?" I deliberately put on a serious face and answered frankly, "To be honest, in this tide of male and female classmates, there are often many male classmates who disregard their personality and overestimate their capabilities, abandoning their studies and focusing on unrequited love. Peifen, have you had such an experience?" I thought this question was risky. If my mother-in-law heard it, she might reprimand me. But Peifen didn't seem to care. She just smiled and slowly answered, "I dare say that everyone must have had such an experience. I receive five or six inexplicable and boring letters like that every week. At first, I was fooled into opening and reading them. Later, I just felt they were despicable. So, as soon as I saw an unfamiliar handwriting on the envelope, I would burn it without exception. So I don't know who wrote the letters, not even their names." I felt that my questions had run out. This mission would probably end in disappointment. But when I stood up to say goodbye, I asked one last question. I said, "Then, in your consciousness, can you completely not remember such a person?" Peifen still held her previous opinion and answered, "Completely not." So I took my leave.</p>

<h3>Financial News Last Week's Gold Market Slightly Lively</h3>
<p>No Major Changes in Swaps: Last week, the price of gold saw a slight upward trend, the situation was peaceful, and due to the swap, there was no large-scale buying or selling, nor were there any special changes. Daily fluctuations were only about four or five taels, often staying above 740 taels. However, news about the international silver price conference was conflicting, and the intentions of the industry seemed hesitant. From Tuesday (June) the highest price was 749 taels and 9 qian, and on Thursday the lowest price was 739 taels and 2 qian, but with a fluctuation of only 10 taels and 7 qian, the overall net increase was 7 taels and 1 qian. Overseas silver markets showed a latent weakness, with British silver falling a total of 1.125 to 1.875, American silver falling a total of 0.25, and the Shanghai foreign exchange rate for shillings also decreasing by half a grade (0.125). Japanese gold added 1.5 fen, and the internal bank rates also tended to tighten. Businesses rushed to close positions, generally hedging. On Saturday, it was time for the swap, and the July contract was listed. The bulls continued to offer rates, initially opening privately the day before for one tael, then increasing to two taels. The official opening was around two taels, later rising to two taels and seven or eight qian, resulting in two and a half taels. The initial opening for July was 47 taels and a half. It is likely that most in the industry had completed the swap, but some shorts had not. Actual delivery of goods was scheduled to begin on June 1st. However, those who swapped within two taels would be at a disadvantage because it would not be enough to cover the interest on the spot goods. Wanxing still held more than a thousand short contracts, as the Dalian gang planned to deliver the spot goods. According to industry insiders, observing the situation, the future of the gold market is unlikely to be optimistic, and there may be a period of consolidation. A summary of the week's events is provided below.</p>
<p>Review of the Past Week: Starting from Monday (May 11th), the big bar decreased by 0.0625, the silver price fell by 0.125, and the Shanghai shilling listing remained unchanged. Internal rates seemed tight, and businesses leaned towards closing positions, but the hedging was closer than before, only about fifteen or sixteen taels apart. As for the opening of the June gold price, it immediately rose by three taels to 41 taels and a half. Afterwards, it gradually rose upwards. Rumors spread that the international silver market would be difficult to resolve, which hardened sentiment. In the afternoon, it rose to 47 taels and 7 qian, closing at 45 taels and 6 qian, due to large remittance inflows from India, and there seemed to be more sellers. Compared to the previous Saturday, it increased by 7 taels and 1 qian, with a daily fluctuation of 6 taels and 7 qian. A certain speculator Wu sold, and Xinheng's Luo covered shorts. The next day, the big bar was lowered again by 0.0625 to 0.125, the silver price slightly decreased by 0.125, and the exchange rate was reduced by half a grade. The internal situation was still calm, and businesses continued to sell. The gold price immediately rose by 1 tael and 4 qian, opening at 47 taels. Major players eagerly bought, suddenly rising to 49 taels and 9 qian (having traded at 50 taels). Subsequently, with Wu and Luo selling, it retreated to 45 taels and a half, reaching 44 taels and 4 qian in the afternoon, and closing at 46 taels and 7 qian, slightly adding 1 tael and 1 qian compared to the previous day (having risen for three consecutive days, totaling 14 taels and 7 qian). However, the market fluctuated by no more than five and a half taels. On Wednesday, the big bar rebounded by 0.0625, and the silver price added 0.25, so the shilling also loosened. However, businesses still had closed positions, and the listing remained unchanged. The gold price immediately opened lower, at 43 taels and 8 qian, then rose from 43 taels to 7 qian, and 5 taels and a half in the afternoon. The closing was slightly lower by 1 tael and 2 qian compared to the previous day. Trading was extremely slow, and the market closed an hour early, with a daily fluctuation of only four taels. The next day, the big bar increased by 0.0625, the silver price added 0.125, and the shilling listing increased by half a grade. The internal rates were slightly strained, but Chinese businesses had already sold off. The gold price immediately opened lower, at 41 taels. Afterwards, there was more selling, and it was heard that the United States would conduct forward silver market transactions on June 1st, so sentiment was dampened, suddenly falling to 39 taels and 2 qian. In the afternoon, it was suddenly rumored that the silver market conference would be difficult to achieve, and Zhifeng, Yongfu, Chang, and others bought in, so it rose to 42 taels and 8 qian, closing at 41 taels and 8 qian, still falling by 3 taels and 7 qian compared to the previous day, with a market fluctuation of no more than four taels. The next day, the big bar and silver price remained unchanged, the shilling was as before, the internal rates were quietly firm, and Chinese businesses covered their positions again. The gold price opened at 45 taels and 8 qian, immediately adding four taels. Afterwards, Luo covered more than two thousand short contracts, so it rose to 47 taels and 6 qian. In the afternoon, the swap had already opened, and Yongfeng, Zhifeng, Yongxiang, and others were inclined to unload, turning downwards, closing at 42 taels and 2 qian, only adding 0.4 qian compared to the previous day, with a rotation of 5 taels and 4 qian. On the weekend, the big bar and silver price both decreased by 0.125, the shilling also decreased by half a grade, the internal rates were slightly strong, and those covering positions were active. The gold price opened at 45 taels and 1 qian, but because the swap was officially opened, there were no more transactions in June, closing at 5 taels and 6 qian, adding 3 taels and 4 qian compared to the previous day. As for July, it had already been listed, with the initial price at 47 taels and a half, followed by 5 taels and 3 qian, and then because there was more buying, it rose to 9 taels and 3 qian. However, Wu and others sold continuously, so it was suppressed to 46 taels, and recovered strongly in the afternoon, calculating 48 taels, adding more than 2 taels compared to June, with the bulls offering rates for the swap. There was a daily fluctuation of four taels, and the daily exchange settlement price had been pressed down by more than 30 taels. There were few channels for spot goods, and the bare bar was about 7 taels higher. The high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets and exchange rates are listed below.</p>

<h3>Sunday Silver Loan Rate Strong and Lively</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual, so the silver loan market felt lively. The resulting silver loan rate was high, at 0.6% per day, significantly different from the slack market situation the previous day. The discount rate remained largely unchanged, at 7 qian 2 fen 8 li in the morning and 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 3 hao 7 hu and a half in the afternoon, slightly lower by 0.00125 hao compared to the previous afternoon. The amount of drafts made was 435,000 in the morning and 385,000 in the afternoon. There were no transactions in banknotes in either market. Off-market banknotes also only saw transactions of 40,000 in the afternoon. Qianzhuang and silver firms collected and delivered over 37 million, foreign firms collected and delivered over 4.3 million, various remittances collected and delivered over 600,000, and small qianzhuang transactions were over 300,000.

<h3>Securities: Last Week, the Bond Market Was Extremely Prosperous</h3>
<p>Transaction Volume Reached 130 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Prices Fell by Three or Four Yuan Compared to the Previous Week</p>
<p>During the past week, the bond market in the local securities market saw a quiet spot market, with a total transaction volume of only 51,000 yuan for the entire week, of which the 19 customs bond accounted for 30,000 yuan, and the rest were only a few thousand yuan. The futures market, on the other hand, was very lively, and the market was consistently active in buying and selling, with a transaction volume of 130 million yuan, an increase of 13.6 million yuan compared to the previous week. In terms of weekly figures, this is a new record for the amount. Among them, the 20 series bonds were the most active, accounting for 28.295 million yuan, followed by the disarmament 19 customs bond. Forward transactions were still more active than near-term transactions. As for the trend of bond prices, due to the unresolved Guangdong issue, there were rumors in the market, and people felt uneasy. Therefore, the selling pressure from small retail investors and speculators consistently dominated the market. However, at the same time, powerful major players, seeing the positive progress of the National Assembly and the continued favorable situation, remained calm and took advantage of the low prices to buy in. As a result, bond prices fluctuated peacefully, with daily fluctuations but no major rises or falls. Observing the situation at the end of the week, if there are no new changes in the future of the situation, bond prices may recover. However, upon examining the bond prices at the end of last week, such as the 19 welfare bond, 19 customs bond, and 20 customs bond, they all fell by several yuan and jiao. The disarmament consolidation bond and other bonds also fell slightly by about three yuan. However, the 19 series bonds and financial bonds remained almost unchanged. The statistics for the high, low, rise, and fall of various bond prices during the past week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Situation Affects the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Standard Yarn Drops Three Taels... Spot Yarn Sales to the North Are Continuous</p>
<p>The yarn market last week trended downwards due to the impact of the situation. The further decline of American cotton increased unease in the local market, and selling pressure was particularly strong. The market fluctuated, but exchange rates remained strong, and Japanese yarn prices were high. If converted to silver, they were above 210 taels, due to a lack of inventory there. There was also a short squeeze in the third-grade futures yarn, so the price increase was drastic. Procurement of local yarn and transportation to Japan was underway, and it was heard that Shenxin Yarn Factory had sold a lot, with all of its May shipments sold out. However, rumors about the situation abounded, and American cotton frequently reported declines, so speculators sold off in response, creating heavy pressure. The market eventually declined. If the situation can calm down and American cotton can stabilize, there may be a chance for a rebound. However, exchange rates are not long-lasting, and there is no large-scale price drop in silver. Many gangs bought spot yarn, and the northern region, due to exchange rate relations with third-grade yarn, continued to procure. Hankou, Sichuan, and other inland areas also had procurement volumes. However, the South China region was affected by the political situation and had not moved for a long time. The situation has a close relationship with the yarn market. Statistics for the total amount purchased by various gangs throughout the week totaled about 10,000 bales, not including exports to Japan and Southeast Asia. 5,900 bales entered the same industry. Japanese yarn markets were firmer, declining by more than one or two taels. The standard yarn price fell by 3 taels 3 qian to 2 taels 6 qian compared to the previous week, with a transaction volume of 151,650 bales. Third-grade yarn for this month increased by 4 yuan 6 jiao compared to the previous week. The bale amounts purchased by each gang are listed below.</p>
<p>Gang　Bale Amount　Gang　Bale Amount　Gang　Bale Amount</p>
<p>Tianjin　715　Jiangxi　115　Ningbo　155</p>
<p>Hankou　1,265　Inland　1,640　Shantou　825</p>
<p>Changsha　650　Northern Gang　4,200　Sichuan　2,400</p>
<p>Qingdao　200　Gaoyang　115　Hong Kong　485</p>
<p>Guangdong　100　Yunnan　140　Miscellaneous Gang　300</p>
<p>Same Industry　5,900</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Last Week Ravaged by American Cotton</h3>
<p>Extremely Weak Spot Cotton Consumption</p>
<p>The cotton market trended weak due to the continuous decline of American cotton and the pessimistic outlook. Although local inventory was depleted, it suffered a significant blow. However, Japanese merchants still held on tightly. Spot cotton business was unusually quiet. Factories had no need, so retail investors unanimously sold off. In short, inventory was too depleted, and the downward trend in the cotton market was not strong. In addition, exchange rates remained strong, and some did not dare to sell. The future depends on the changes in American cotton. Standard cotton for each month fell by 0.95 qian to 0.78 qian compared to the previous week, with a transaction volume of 357,600 dan. The source was 1,150 bales of Yao flower and 100 bales of wooden frame flower. Purchases by various factories were all small transactions. American spot cotton fell by 60 points compared to the previous week. The amount of purchases made by each factory is listed below.</p>
<p>Factory Inbound　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Transaction Volume　Term</p>
<p>Jiujiang Flower　35.00　...　100 Bales　Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower　41.50　40.60　400 Pieces　Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Local Flower　38.25　...　100 Bales　Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>American Cotton　46.00　...　100 Pieces　Spot Delivery to Warehouse</p>
<h3>American, British, and Indian Cotton Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton weakened due to good weather and weakness on Wall Street, with an increase in sellers. Futures fell by 11 to 13 points, and spot fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 3 to 5 points, and spot fell by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with Pingguoer falling by 4 rupees, Aomula falling by 3 rupees, and Zhe Luoxi falling by 1 rupee, according to a telegram (dated 16th).</p>

<h3>Lanxi New Cocoons Suffer Severe Harvest Failure</h3>
<p>Only Thirty Percent of Normal Yield... Cocoon Price Opens at Forty-One or Two Yuan: Lanxi's silkworm season is the earliest. This year, the early silkworms raised by farmers all developed white muscardine due to the cold weather. Late silkworms also suffered due to the unusually cold weather, with more rain than sunshine, and frequent changes. During the most important period of rapid growth and leaf consumption, heavy rain fell for weeks, and silkworms ate wet leaves, resulting in diseases such as spitting black and discharging yellow, causing 70% of the crop to be discarded. New cocoons are now on the market. Only four or five cocoon firms in the entire county, such as Zhenxing and Zhenyuan, have started weighing. The cocoons are not in good condition. After ascending to the frame, the weather was cold, and there was insufficient wind and rain. The cocoon price opened at forty-one or two yuan, with only thirty percent of the normal yield, according to reports.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Last Week: Chinese and Foreign Merchants Hold Their Ground</h3>
<p>Overseas Silk Sales Are Weak... Telegrams Suggest Silk Prices Will Not Rise</p>
<p>Domestic Silkworm Farming Fails... Chinese Merchants Maintain Firm Stance</p>
<p>The silk market for foreign firms in the local area showed no improvement last week. Overseas markets saw low prices for Japanese silk, and sales for Chinese silk factories remained sluggish. Shanghai white silk factories wired back that prices were rising. Chinese silk merchants believed that domestic silkworm farming had failed and cocoon harvests would inevitably be severely reduced. Those holding silk inventory maintained a firm stance, unwilling to sell for less. The silk market was nearly deadlocked during the week, with a total transaction volume of only about a hundred bales of silk and exports of more than seven hundred bales. Although the prices of European, American, and Chinese silk saw a rebound, the price difference with the cost of Chinese silk was still significant. A list of the prices of Chinese silk in overseas markets at the end of last week is provided below (New York: price per pound in gold dollars; Lyon: price per kilogram in francs):</p>
<p>Silk Type　New York　Lyon　New York　Lyon</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Silk　2.85　272　Superior Dried Silk　1.95　147</p>
<p>Above-Average Shanghai Silk　2.40　220　Above-Average Dried Silk　1.50　115</p>
<p>Average Shanghai Silk　1.95　165　Average Dried Silk　0.05　087</p>
<p>Below-Average Shanghai Silk　1.50　120　Superior Large Silk　1.62　120</p>
<p>Superior Shandong Silk　1.88　168　Below-Average Large Silk　0.98　084</p>
<p>Superior Sichuan Silk　1.95　172　Superior White Silk　0.96　080</p>
<p>Superior Gray Silk　1.38　109</p>
<h3>Qimen First Batch of Tea Has Been Shipped</h3>
<p>The first batches of red tea from various Qimen and Fu brands, eager to rush to Shanghai to seize the new market, are all being processed urgently. In addition to the tribute tea, which was shipped out a few days ago, the large batches have all been completed in recent days. In addition, the Qimen River and Chang River have seen rising water levels, facilitating smooth transport via Poyang Lake. Most of the first shipments have already arrived in Rao and Xun. The second batches will soon be boxed up within a few days, and the third batches are also being screened and supervised. If the first batches arrive in Shanghai with a profitable market, brands with thicker resources will continue to produce sub-tea and add final batches, according to reports.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Brown and White Sugar Both Increase by Half a Qian</h3>

During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Chen's recovery of Shanghai was particularly meritorious. Later, he assisted the Premier in organizing the Chinese Revolutionary Party. When Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, Mr. Chen took the lead in launching an uprising and advocating for independence. Yuan Shikai hated him and hired assassins to murder him. On May 18, 1916, he was murdered in Shanghai at the young age of forty.</p>

<h3>Lawyers Association Asks for the Return of the French Concession</h3>
<p>Telegram to the National Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association telegraphed to National Government Chairman Chiang, the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the other day: (Title omitted) With deep respect, the Shanghai French Concession Mixed Court has a bizarre system, dark trials, undermines our legal rights, treats our people as mere straw dogs, and its harmful effects are countless. It has been repeatedly requested by local residents and proposed by the Association to be taken back and reorganized. However, the cunning French are accustomed to using a guise of appeasement, colluding with a few traitors who seek only their own interests and disregard the overall situation, weakening our government's courage to take back and reorganize it. To this day, this illegal organization still stands within our territory. Recently, it has intensified, with the French consul issuing summonses alone based on his position in the Mixed Court, summoning our people, and then signing warrants for detention without consulting the Chinese officials of the Mixed Court. French Western police officers even opened fire without reason, harming residents. The victims, Wang Xingsu and Xin Haishan, have filed appeals through various channels, and the newspapers have reported on it, known to all, both Chinese and foreign. This kind of violence is unprecedented in the history of the Public Concession. The French are recklessly doing this, and if this continues, who knows what the future holds. Now the National Assembly declares the abolition of unequal treaties, and all foreigners residing in China will be subject to our laws. Yet hundreds of thousands of residents of the French Concession are placed below foreigners residing in China. How can we take a step further to govern foreigners? The Chinese Court of the Public Concession has been established for more than a year, but the French Concession ignores it, and the French Consul is allowed to handle Chinese cases alone, how can justice be shown? The situation is urgent, so we especially telegram the Chairman to make a resolute decision and begin negotiations as soon as possible, first taking back and reorganizing the French Concession Mixed Court, and then taking decisive action to take back French consular jurisdiction, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the Washington Conference's investigation of the judicial case, which led Britain, America, and Japan to watch from the sidelines. In addition to entrusting National Assembly representative Qin Liankui to present the details in person, we respectfully submit this telegram for your review</p>
<h3>The Price of Rice Rises in the City for Several Days</h3>
<p>Due to reduced imports from various ports recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has been rising daily. Yesterday, specially selected white rice was already selling for 14 yuan, first-grade white rice for 13.6 yuan, and second and third grades for 13.23 and 12.78 yuan, respectively. It is said that today, specially selected white rice will sell for around 14.4 yuan, and first-grade white rice will also be around 14 yuan. Even the lowest grade of third-grade white xian rice will sell for around 12 yuan, which is more than 1 yuan higher than two weeks ago. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency's investigation of rice merchants, the recent rise in rice prices is due to the continuous bad weather and the export of large quantities of rice by merchants. As for the source of rice in Shanghai, it is abundant, and there should be no shortage this year. It is expected that after the weather improves, the price can be gradually restored.</p>
<h3>Butchers to Suspend Business Entirely</h3>
<p>Over 1,300 Businesses in the Two Concessions</p>
<p>Agree on Joint Action Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>For three days, the fresh pork industry in the northern and southern parts of the city and rural areas of this port has been refusing to slaughter livestock to protest against the Municipal Finance Bureau's direct collection of slaughter taxes on a per-head basis. In the past two days, all the leftover overnight meat in the stores has been sold out. Therefore, starting today, there is no fresh meat for sale in the Chinese areas. The industry in the concessions also resolved yesterday to take joint action. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Municipal Government for relief. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Suspension of Business: After the fresh meat industry declared a halt to slaughter due to the slaughter tax issue, yesterday, all fresh meat shops in the north and south of the city had no meat to sell and suspended business. Although most of them still opened their doors as usual, they only left apprentices to watch the shops, which were quite quiet. The general residents and noodle shops went to the concessions to buy meat. The Public Security Bureau of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Districts, as well as the sub-bureaus, branch offices, and police stations, all dispatched senior police officers to patrol and inquire about the situation.</p>
<p>Joint Action: After the fresh meat industry suspended business, more than 300 businesses such as Lu Gao Jian in the British Concession, more than 200 businesses such as Yong Da in the French Concession, and more than 800 businesses such as Wang Ji Ren in the American Concession have been holding meetings in groups for days to discuss assistance matters. It is said that they have now decided to stop importing goods from the 19th. Slaughterhouses such as Juxing, Renyuan, Ninghai, and Suxi in the concessions will inevitably stop slaughtering livestock. They will suspend business together from the 20th to show their support.</p>
<p>Impact on Pork Merchants: Pork dealers such as Changshun, Changyuan, Yuhe, Changhe, Yuantai, Yuanshun, Shengyuan, Runda, and Chunyuan in Xuejia Bang, Nanshi; Wanmao, Jiatai, and Wanshen in Wusong; Fuxing Pork Dealer in Yangjing; and Longmao Pork Dealer in Zhabei have seen a sharp decline in sales since the fresh meat industry in the north and south of the city suspended business. It is also said that meat merchants in the concessions will rise up to help and are prepared to reduce imports and telegraph pork merchants in northern Jiangsu to temporarily postpone shipping fresh pork to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Official Reply: The Fresh Meat Industry Association yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security, Finance, and Health Bureaus, stating: "With respect, our association received a joint order yesterday stating (omitted)... Upon investigation, the purpose of our association is to protect the business and livelihood of the industry. This time, the industry requested that the slaughter tax be changed to a business tax. For the sake of the national tax revenue, we have reported the situation to the Citizens Training Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and requested the Municipal Government to handle it with consideration. Fearing that some people in the industry would incite trouble and suffer losses in business, we have also sent people to persuade them not to be fooled and to wait quietly for the higher authorities to deal with and resolve the matter. We have explained the situation in detail and hope you will understand."</p>
<p>Presentation to the Municipal Government: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday presented a document to the Municipal Government, stating: "Regarding the matter of making a presentation, our chamber received a letter from the Fresh Meat Industry Association of this city on the 15th of this month, stating (omitted)... Upon investigation, Article 11 of the supplementary measures to the outline for the collection of business tax stipulates that the slaughter tax should be collected temporarily at the original tax rate, with the intention of maintaining the original tax source so that the designated educational expenses and other uses will not be suddenly reduced. The so-called original tax rate refers to the tax rate that has not been actually collected in previous years, which is in line with the intention of the Ministry's legislation to maintain the tax source. According to reports from meat merchants, the Shanghai slaughter tax paid to the Provincial Education Expenditure Management Office in previous years was only 60,000 yuan. Therefore, the first step in legal procedures is to collect the original tax amount of 60,000 yuan in accordance with Article 11 of the supplementary measures. The reason why the Ministry's measures do not allow for a sudden change to the business tax rate is to prevent a reduction in the tax amount. The reason why the original tax rate is still followed is to prevent an increase in the burden. The compromise is appropriate and has profound meaning. This year, the Provincial Education Expenditure Management Office entrusted the Municipal Finance Bureau to collect the tax on its behalf. It is said that there has already been an increase in the tax amount compared to previous years, which is not in line with the Ministry's supplementary measures. However, it is said that the increase is only to an annual payment of 70,000 yuan, which is still limited. Since the Municipal Finance Bureau is in the position of collecting the tax on behalf of the province, it should allocate and apportion the annual amount. However, it suddenly abandoned the previous method and changed to collecting the tax on a per-head basis. According to estimates by meat merchants, the tax amount they bear will increase three times compared to before, which is clearly contrary to the Ministry's intention to maintain the status quo. If the increased revenue is not returned to the Provincial Education Expenditure Management Office but goes into the municipal treasury, then the municipal treasury will receive unexpected income from the collection, and the meat merchants will suffer unexpected losses from the collection, which is unfair. Based on these reasons, the meat merchants have no choice but to request a change to the business tax, which is to take into account the city's revenue and reduce the burden on meat merchants. In the absence of this, there is no other way. We hereby prepare a document and request your approval to handle it accordingly, which is for the public good."</p>
<p>Opinions of Meat Merchants: According to people in the meat industry, the current market shutdown is out of necessity. Outsiders may not know the truth and suspect that someone is inciting it. In fact, the stores are acting entirely on their own. Therefore, although the Municipal Government ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate the main instigators of the market shutdown for investigation, it is not known where to investigate. Currently, the larger stores in the north and south of the city sell four or five or six or seven white pigs a day, and pay taxes of only about 20 yuan or about 10 yuan a month. Smaller stores sell two or three white pigs a day, and the tax paid is only about four or five yuan a month. If the Finance Bureau directly collects taxes on a per-head basis, then those who sell six or seven pigs a day will have to pay more than sixty or seventy yuan a month, and those who sell four or five pigs will have to pay forty or fifty yuan a month, which is more than double the tax paid by the contractor. Therefore, all the stores are able to do so unanimously. It is reported that the per-head tax collection is expected to collect 140,000 yuan a year, but in fact, it is more than that. Therefore, all the stores are so determined, and so on.</p>

<h3>Wang Yansong Makes Suggestions to the Central Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Wang Yansong, a representative of the Shanghai business community and industrial groups attending the National Assembly, recently submitted a letter summarizing the suggestions to the Central Party Headquarters as suggestions, requesting that they be separately reviewed and adopted to comfort the people's hopes, because the National Assembly's proposals are limited to the scope of unification and construction, and all proposals from various industries in Shanghai that concern local issues have been submitted to the Legislative Yuan. There are four points in total, of which the one on revising the money and banking law has been seen in previous reports, and the other three points are as follows: (A) Proposal to expand the number of members of the Legislative Yuan. Legislation should conform to the trends of the times, especially the characteristics of the national spirit and the changes in social life. If it is biased towards idealism and imitates European and American written laws, it will either be too high-minded and far from reality, or it will be different from the people's sentiments and not meet the needs of society. It is said that oranges turn into trifoliate oranges when they are transplanted north of the Huai River. Moreover, the ease of implementing laws depends on the ability of the public to comply with them. Therefore, legislators should not only seek erudite scholars but also come from the people to avoid being isolated from the social situation. During the current period of political tutelage, although members of the Legislative Yuan are not directly elected by the people, they should also recruit specialized talents from various fields to complete the great cause. The methods are: (1) Request the government to expand the number of members of the Legislative Yuan; (2) Recruit talents from various fields who have more than five years of experience in serving in the relevant field and are knowledgeable; (3) The initial drafts of laws and regulations should be announced to solicit opinions from the whole country, which should be collected, reviewed, and used as the basis for amendments; (4) Before any law or regulation is announced and implemented, the people of the whole country should be given the opportunity to discuss it as a preliminary step in exercising the right of referendum; (B) Proposal to determine the principles of taxation. It is a golden rule in democratic countries that increasing the burden on the people must be with the consent of the people's representatives. Taxpayers should fulfill their obligations, but excessive taxation is beyond the capacity of taxpayers. In addition, taxpayers suffer from the aggression of imperialist capitalism and the plight of the country and the people. Maintenance and conservation depend on the tax system. It is proposed to determine the following principles of taxation: (1) In the future, any increase in taxes and levies on businesses and the people should first be agreed upon by the representative bodies of businesses and the people and submitted to the Legislative Yuan of the Central Government for review and approval before it can be levied; (2) Encourage foreign trade and exempt all export taxes on domestic manufactured goods; (3) Except for industrial necessities and those lacking in the country, increase the import tariff rates; (4) Quickly implement anti-dumping taxes to counteract foreigners' deliberate low prices and sales of foreign goods; (5) After the implementation of the factory tax, all Chinese merchants who also have similar factories set up by foreigners, such as cotton yarn, silk weaving, and cigarettes, should have a certain percentage of the factory tax refunded in the name of bonuses, which should be ordered by the Ministry of Industry to formulate bonus regulations in order to ensure that the Chinese merchants are protected in practice without the name of discounting taxes; (6) Exempt all taxes on silkworm cocoons; (C) Proposal to recover the Kai Ping Coal Mine. The Kai Ping Mining Bureau was seized by the British merchant Molin Ren Liren Hu Hua in 1901 through fraudulent means without compensation. The Qianzhou Mining Company merged with Kai Ping on June 1, 1912, with an agreement of ten years, to be repurchased at a fair value agreed upon by both parties. However, when the recovery was carried out in 1922, it was ineffective. Now, Kai Qian Coal and Fushun Coal, which is occupied by the Japanese, collude to monopolize the market, causing China's economy to leak more than 200 million yuan every year. On the one hand, it suppresses the coal mines run by Chinese people, causing them to be unable to develop. China's economy cannot be prosperous, and the people's livelihood cannot be solved. The only way to avoid this is to actively find ways to recover the Kai Qian Coal Mine. As for the Fushun Coal Mine, it will have to wait until the unequal treaties are abolished. Shanghai coal merchants feel that the Kai Qian Coal Mine is deeply harmful to China and believe that if it is not actively recovered, China's wealth will continue to leak out and cannot be stopped.</p>
<h3>Lecture on the General Situation of the French Concession</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA invited Mr. Tao Leqin, secretary of the Shanghai Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, to give a lecture on the general situation of the French Concession of Shanghai at 4 pm the day before yesterday. His speech was as follows: (1) The municipal administrative area of the French Concession of Shanghai: The French Concession of Shanghai is the territory of China, formerly under the jurisdiction of Shanghai County, Jiangsu Province, and now under the Shanghai urban area. Since August 26 of the Daoguang era of the Qing Dynasty, according to Article 2 of the Treaty of Nanjing of the 22nd year of Daoguang, "China allows British merchants to lease land in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Ningbo for residence and business," the British consul was sent to delineate the area for British merchants to live and do business in Shanghai in conjunction with the Jiangsu Su-Song-Tai Dao. Later, France and the United States, citing the principle of equal benefit, also sent personnel to request the Qing court through the Guangdong Governor to approve the French merchants to officially obtain the area north of the Shanghai city moat and south of the Yangjingbang as a rental area for residence and business from April 6 of the 29th year of Daoguang. Although it is now called a concession, it is actually only a settlement as stated in the Treaty of Nanjing. Now, we will follow the custom and generally call it a concession. At that time, the area delineated by the French consul and the Shanghai Dao was 986 mu. On October 29 of the 11th year of Xianfeng, it was expanded by 138 mu. On January 27 of the 26th year of Guangxu, it was expanded by 909 mu. At the same time, it was also determined that the area occupied by French persons before the 29th year of Daoguang was 116 mu. The above are all concession areas recognized by China. On July 20 of the 3rd year of the Republic of China, when Yuan Shikai was engaged in the imperial system movement, the Beijing government also allowed an expansion of 13,001 mu, but the scope of the area was all-encompassing. Therefore, the actual municipal administrative area of the French Concession can be said to occupy an area of 15,150 mu (while its true concession area only occupies an area of 2,149 mu). Its four boundaries are: north to Avenue Edward VII and Changbang Road, west to Avenue Haig, south to the area from Xujiahui Bridge eastward along Avenue Xujiahui to Xieqiao, and then along Avenue Lavenais, turning east to Tangjiawan, turning north to Zhaozhou Road, and turning east to Mingguo Road, east along to Xiaodongmen, and turning east into the Bund, east to the Huangpu River. (2) The system of municipal administration in the French Concession of Shanghai: The system of municipal administration in the French Concession of Shanghai is not autonomous but is entirely run by officials. Therefore, even French residents do not have a legislative body for municipal affairs. Although there is a board of directors of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale, all directors are appointed by the French consul in Shanghai and are of an advisory nature. The most obvious point is that the French consul in Shanghai is the ex officio chairman of the board of directors' meetings, and all resolutions must not violate the current French laws before they can be implemented. Therefore, the announcement of the resolutions is signed by the French consul, and the wording must be "The Board of Directors of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale of this concession decided on the resolutions of the regular meeting of a certain month of this year, and there is no violation of the current French laws, and they should be implemented in accordance with the provisions of..." It can be seen that whether the resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale are implemented or not must be decided by the French consul in Shanghai. It can be inferred that it is not an autonomous system. (3) The organization of the municipal administrative organs in the French Concession of Shanghai: The organization of the municipal administrative organs in the French Concession of Shanghai can be divided into five departments: the Office of the Superintendent, the Office of the Director-General, various offices, the Police Department, and the Engineering Department. Above the five departments is the Board of Directors, i.e., the aforementioned Board of Directors of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale. The chairman of the board is concurrently held by the French consul in Shanghai. All important municipal administration is planned by the Office of the Superintendent and the Office of the Director-General and then submitted to the Board of Directors for resolution and must be approved and promulgated by the French consul in Shanghai before implementation. However, the Office of the Superintendent and the Office of the Director-General have the power to directly decide on ordinary municipal administration. The general situation of the organization of the above five departments is described separately as follows: (1) Office of the Superintendent: the place where the Superintendent works, managing the overall administration, and the Superintendent is appointed by the French consul; (2) Office of the Director-General: the place where the Director-General works, managing documents, accounting, and tax matters, with one Director-General as a paid full-time position; (3) Various offices: managing sanitation, hospitals, medicine, observatories, charity, education, fire prevention, slaughter, parks, public offices, public bonds, and savings banks; (4) Police Department: managing prisons, transportation, patrols, criminal investigation, and all public security matters, and the Chief Inspector is directly appointed by the French government; (5) Engineering Department: managing roads, building materials, water and electricity, dredging, warehouses, factories, and road deeds. (4) The general situation of the municipal finances in the French Concession of Shanghai: The sources of municipal finances in the French Concession of Shanghai are house tax, land tax, business tax, license tax, and wharf tax. If there is not enough, public bonds are issued. The land tax is 7 per mille, and the house tax is 13 percent. According to the financial final statement of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale of the French Concession in 1930, the regular income was 4,920,906.17 taels of silver, the regular expenditure was 4,736,811.83 taels of silver, the temporary income was 2,440,555.95 taels of silver, and the temporary expenditure was 2,233,630.04 taels of silver. After offsetting the total income and expenditure, adding the balance from the previous year, the total surplus was 1,576,038.60 taels of silver. From this, it can be seen that although the municipal financial income of the French Concession of Shanghai is far less than the income of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession in the same year, which was 12,679,207.77 taels of silver, it is more than the income of the Shanghai Municipal Government last year, which was about 7 million taels of silver. Moreover, like the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department, it also has a huge surplus. (5) The Conseil d'Administration Municipale of the French Concession and education: The most important tasks for the progress of municipal administration are public security construction and education, and education is especially the driving force behind public security and construction. Therefore, although the Shanghai Municipal Government is not very well-funded, it has made rapid progress in education, with its expenditures accounting for more than 20% of the total expenditures. However, let us look at the educational situation in the French Concession. It can be said that all school-age children of foreigners have schools to attend, while only one Sino-French school is available for school-age children in our country, and the tuition fee is high, not only insufficient to accommodate them but also unaffordable. As for the primary schools that are run exclusively and operated in accordance with the regulations of our Ministry, there is not a single one. Therefore, the municipal administration of the French Concession can be said to be inconsistent with the trend of modern municipal administration. (6) The road administration of the French Concession of Shanghai: The road administration of the French Concession used to be better than that of the Public Concession, and it was also neat and clean, with trees on both sides, which was especially beautiful. Every morning, the area around the Rue du Consulat was washed with tap water. Today, the construction of various roads in the Public Concession has been actively improved, and as a result, the road conditions in the French Concession have gradually become inferior. However, the French people admire beautification, so their road administration is still worth seeing. However, if they continue to be conservative, it is feared that they will inevitably be overtaken by the latecomers. (7) Public utilities in the French Concession of Shanghai: Public utilities in the French Concession are not run by the Conseil d'Administration Municipale itself. The most important of the public utilities are water, electricity, and transportation. Electric lights, electric power, streetcars, tap water, and buses are run by the French-owned Compagnie Franco-Chinoise de l'Eau et de l'Électricité de Shanghai, with annual profits of no less than 3 million taels, but they are all obtained by French persons. As for telephones, they are currently run by International Shanghai Telephone Company, which is the same as the Public Concession. However, one point is worth mentioning: formerly, tap water in Nanshi, Zhabei, the French Concession, and the Public Concession in Shanghai was the cleanest in the French Concession. Now, Nanshi and Zhabei have both been improved, so the tap water in the French Concession can no longer claim to be the best. (8) The distribution of various areas in the French Concession: Generally speaking, urban areas are divided into residential and commercial areas, and the French Concession is no exception. Roughly speaking, the area east of the Eight Immortals Bridge is a large commercial area, with residential areas attached to it. In the area of the Bund and Wing On Street, there are many warehouses. Factories are mostly located in the area of Rue Conty, and the rest are mostly large residences, with commercial areas attached to them. However, there is a most obvious phenomenon recently, that is, since Soviet Russia expelled the White Russians, all the White Russians in Shanghai have mostly gathered in the area of Avenue Joffre, thus forming the center of Russian merchants, and their commercial achievements are quite considerable. (9) The organs of Chinese opinion in the French Concession of Shanghai: Although the French Concession is currently presided over by French persons, it is ultimately our country's territory. Therefore, a large number of Chinese people reside and do business there, numbering about 400,000. Since the May Fourth Movement, the concept of national self-determination has gradually become popular. Therefore, at first, there was the organization of the Merchants' Associations of Various Roads, and then the establishment of the Taxpayers Association of the Chinese. When it was first established, it was difficult to gain importance by expressing opinions. After years of struggle, it has been valued by the Conseil d'Administration Municipale, and therefore it is considered to be the only organ of Chinese opinion. Recently, the five Chinese directors and six committee members of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale have also been asked to be recommended by the Taxpayers Association of the Chinese. (10) The Mixed Court of the French Concession of Shanghai: What we know very well is that no municipal authority has the right to set up its own court to hear civil and criminal cases in the district. Therefore, the Mixed Court of the Public Concession was taken back and reorganized by our government, and the Provisional Court and the Special District Court are all handled in accordance with the court organization law of our country. According to the provisions of the law, all cases heard by courts that do not comply with the court organization law are invalid. However, since its establishment, the administration and appointment of judges of the Mixed Court of the French Concession have been handled by the French consul in Shanghai. Although it has been voluntarily reorganized, its nature has not changed. Therefore, it is still only a de facto court, not a legitimate court of our country. Therefore, all its trials and judgments are only regarded as a kind of private behavior in our country and are generally considered invalid under the law. Our country's diplomatic authorities are currently continuing their efforts to negotiate the recovery and reorganization, but they have not yet yielded. However, a municipal authority that specially sets up a court is rare in the world. Moreover, according to the opinions of informed people, if the Mixed Court is not recovered and reorganized, municipal affairs such as opium and gambling will be even easier to handle, which seems not without reason. In closing, I will briefly describe my personal feelings about municipal administration, that is, if the municipal authorities do not pay attention to and improve the education of citizens, even if the construction and public security are very impressive on the surface, their achievements cannot be said to be complete. In short, the universality of education is more than enough to promote the progress of construction and public security (End).</p>

<h3>Public Concession Tram Workers' Strike Yesterday's News</h3>
<p>Negotiations Still Yield No Results</p>
<p>According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," the coppersmith workers of the Public Concession Tram Company continued their strike yesterday. The situation on both sides is quite tense, and it seems difficult to resolve for the time being. The following is a record of the news obtained by the "Nichinichi Shimbun" reporter:</p>
<p>Ineffective Consultation: Yesterday, it was heard that the workers' side received a notification from the company to send representatives to negotiate. Consequently, worker leaders came forward for negotiations. However, there were no satisfactory results, so the strike continues. The workers' side is very firm in their attitude, united, and declares that they must achieve their goals. The company, on the other hand, believes that the matter is difficult to handle and therefore cannot agree.</p>
<p>Strike Statistics: The coppersmith workers of the tram company are divided into three locations. One is on Route Ghisi, which is the main factory and quite large, with approximately 500 workers. One is near the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu, and one is near the intersection of Hardoon Road and Jing'an Temple Road. These two locations are smaller in scale and are divided into car service and mechanical service departments. The car service department is where ticket sellers and drivers operate the trams. The mechanical service department is where the coppersmith workers work. Each location has only a dozen or so workers during the day, but around 100 workers work at night. This strike involves all the workers at the main factory on Route Ghisi. The workers at the other two locations are still working.</p>
<p>Repair of Damaged Cars Temporarily Postponed: The coppersmith workers at the main factory on Route Ghisi are responsible for repairing major damage to the trams. This is because the factory is large, the machinery is precise, and the coppersmiths have advanced skills. The other two locations can only repair minor damage to the cars. Therefore, when a tram is damaged, minor repairs are handled by the two factories, while major repairs are temporarily left until the strike is resolved before proceeding.</p>
<p>Work Intensified: The company has a total of 101 trams, 100 trailers, and 98 trolleybuses. Statistics show that approximately six or seven cars are damaged each day. The company is now urging workers at the Yangshupu and Hardoon Road factories to intensify repairs to meet the needs. The guard outside the gates of the three factories was slightly relaxed yesterday. The police in charge of each area still sent two Indian constables to guard the entrance, no longer with the severe appearance of the previous days.</p>
<p>Demanded Conditions: The demands of the All-Workers Negotiation Committee of the British Shanghai Tram Factory are: (1) Release the arrested workers Qiao Shengfa and Jin Botang, and guarantee that no more arrests will occur. (2) If the company lays off or dismisses employees, they must provide severance pay and retirement funds, with a minimum of 100 yuan for one year of service, 200 yuan for a full year, and additional amounts calculated pro rata (an additional 100 yuan for each additional year, for example, 600 yuan for five years). (3) All employees, regardless of whether they are drivers, ticket sellers, or coppersmith laborers, should receive a housing allowance of six yuan per month. (4) Pay should be provided for rest days, double pay should be provided for working on rest days, and double pay should be provided for overtime work. (5) Coppersmith laborers, etc., should be exempt from paying for tram tickets (passes) and be universally accepted in the British and French concessions.</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Summoned Labor and Management Representatives of the National Medicine Industry Yesterday for Talks</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, for the issue of organizing a trade union, summoned representatives from the city's Pharmaceutical Workers' Union and the National Medicine Trade Association for questioning. The labor representatives present were Zhao Zhenhui and Fang Qingjian, and the management representatives present were Zhuang Meitang and Cen Binghuang. Gu Bingyuan, Chairman of the Social Affairs Bureau, first inquired with the labor representatives about the working conditions of the workers in the stores. According to the representatives, pharmaceutical workers are traditionally divided into internal and external fields. The internal field includes knife handling, material preparation, fighting, miscellaneous tasks, picking medicines, and handling both fine and coarse goods, specializing in internal field work and not participating in business sales. The external field is divided into pills, powders, and decocted pieces. The decocted pieces section, in addition to breaking mai dong and smashing tangerine peel, is generally responsible for sales on the counter. The pills and powders section, while responsible for sales on the counter, also has considerable technical work, such as suspending wax shells, mixing various pills and powders, refining elixir, raising elixir, plasters, and the like. Subsequently, inquiries were made with the management representatives, and their answers were generally the same. After both parties presented their opinions, the chairman, based on laws and regulations, explained to both parties the distinction between shop employees and vocational workers. Those not directly involved in sales are naturally vocational workers and should be able to legally organize a vocational union. The National Medicine Trade Association's request is too one-sided and inappropriate. He instructed both parties to report the factual situation so that it could be verified, and then adjourned the meeting.</p>

<p>According to the Guomin She, over thirty trade unions, including the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, issued a declaration of support for the fellow workers at the Finance and Printing Bureau, stating: "After reading the express mail telegram from the fellow workers at the Finance and Printing Bureau, listing the dark secrets of the postal authorities, we feel how concerned they are about state-run enterprises. At the same time, the postal authorities' willingness to destroy the state-run printing industry and their fraudulent practices have been fully exposed. We cannot help but admire the great spirit of the fellow workers at the Finance and Printing Bureau and offer our sympathetic support. We also cannot help but attack these corrupt officials, blinded by self-interest, with drums and clamor. The occurrence of this matter is due to the issue of stamp printing. The postal authorities nitpicked, saying that the Finance and Printing Bureau's technology was not sophisticated enough and refused to let them undertake the printing, instead handing it over to the British firm De La Rue &amp; Company. This aroused the reaction of the fellow workers at the Finance and Printing Bureau. We should think about it. If China's printing industry cannot compete with foreign countries, then it should be encouraged during this embryonic stage, not criticized in various ways and hindering its development, especially since it is a state-run printing institution. Moreover, this measure not only indirectly causes losses to the national interest but also brings a major humiliation to the nation's dignity. We sincerely delve into the background of this event and can see the postal authorities' intentions. Printing stamps is a huge printing transaction, and there is no need to mention the kickbacks for those involved, as it is certainly profitable. If this large transaction is undertaken by Chinese printing companies, not only would the price be lower and commissions reduced, but the fraudulent practices would not be difficult to expose. Therefore, the authorities want to hand it over to the British firm De La Rue &amp; Company so that they can inflate the printing costs and obtain huge commissions, while all sorts of dark secrets can be handled with ease. Lin Shi is only concerned with his own interests and disregards public criticism. Why does the aviation section chief Li Jingcong willingly risk disgrace and make such biased remarks? The fellow workers at the Finance and Printing Bureau are fighting for the national interest and dignity and competing for the development of the printing industry. Their actions are in line with reason and justice, and we should do our best to rise up and help them, so that corrupt officials will no longer act recklessly, rectify court practices, and recover our rights. This is a heartfelt plea from the fellow workers at the Finance and Printing Bureau, and it is a hope that we can all support together."</p>

<h3>The Tragic Situation of Communist Disaster in Hekou</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a joint telegram from twenty-five representatives of refugees from Hekou Town, Jiangxi, including Chen Chang, stating: "On December 13th of last year, at dawn, the communist bandit Fang Zhimin, taking advantage of the remaining power after defeating Shangrao, led 3,000 soldiers and tens of thousands of peasant bandits to attack and capture Hekou. Li Kun, the commander of the First Regiment of the newly reorganized Thirteenth Division, was wounded in the defense, and the entire army was routed, with the loss of all rifles, machine guns, and mortars. As a result, all the people of the town were plunged into a red terror. Three thousand search and kill squads surrounded and searched, implementing the so-called Marxist massacre. Alas, the townspeople had no way to escape and were unable to resist. After three days of trampling, corpses piled up like mountains, and the ends of alleys and streets were littered with bodies. Anyone with even a little knowledge was not spared, especially personnel from various institutions, who were relentlessly searched and slaughtered without rest. The cruelty and barbarity of their methods were particularly appalling, with heads severed and limbs dismembered, abdomens cut open and hearts gouged out, or numerous cuts inflicted to prevent a quick death, and limbs severed and left to scream. The terrible situation defies description and is truly an unprecedented catastrophe. In total, no fewer than several thousand people were brutally murdered, and more than a thousand were abducted. The plundering of property goes without saying. The refugees either had their parents killed, their siblings murdered, their wives and children all taken, or were left as orphans and lonely children. Some families of more than ten members had only one survivor escape, while entire families were killed. There was no one to collect the bodies. Alas, having suffered this great calamity, blood and tears flowed together. When will the blood feud be avenged?"</p>

<h3>Record of a Rush to Seize a Bride and Beg for Pleasure</h3>
<p>Ji Yulong One-Sidedly Yearns</p>
<p>Li Dafenzi Greatly Frightened</p>
<p>Examination Reveals She is Still a Virgin</p>
<p>Second Landlord Should Not Be an Accomplice</p>
<p>Ji Yulong, a factory worker at the Dakang Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, from Yangzhou, is 23 years old and has not yet started a family. He cannot help but have improper thoughts about the opposite sex. After learning that Li Dafenzi, a female worker at the nearby Dasheng Cotton Mill, is not unattractive, only 19 years old, still a maiden, and from the same hometown, he devised a plan to seduce her when they met. However, Dafenzi was quite self-respecting and sternly refused. However, Ji could not forget her and came up with a plan. He inquired about the girl's birthdate from someone close to her, bought red paper, and hired a fortune teller to write out the eight characters. He then rented a room on the upper floor of No. 1044 Haizhou Road in order to seize the girl and marry her. At 6:30 AM the day before yesterday, he gathered several hooligans and waited at the girl's residence. When she returned from the factory, they forcibly seized her, carried her away on their backs, and Ji lit red candles and closed the door, begging for pleasure. The girl screamed for help, but the second landlord, a woman from Yancheng named Wang Zhangshi, not only did not help her but acted as an accomplice, standing outside the room and threatening her, saying that if she did not comply, she would be beaten. Ji became bolder, carried the girl to the bed, and forcibly removed her trousers. At this critical moment, the girl's younger sister, Xiaofenzi, also arrived, trying to break down the door to rescue her sister. Wang Zhangshi, being strong, pushed Xiaofenzi down the stairs. Xiaofenzi immediately ran into the street to call the police. Subsequently, detectives arrived with her and arrested Ji and Wang Zhangshi, ordering Dafenzi to put on her clothes and go to the police station. After questioning them, the police chief ordered Ji and the woman to be detained separately and sent detectives to the hospital to examine Dafenzi, who was found to still be a virgin. The next morning, they sent the group of people to the Special District Local Court. Judge Xiao questioned them. The police lawyer Chen Ming explained the case's circumstances and requested a postponement so that the accomplices who helped the defendant seize the girl could be arrested and punished one by one. Dafenzi then stated that her parents were both in her hometown, and only she and her sister worked in Shanghai. She did not know the defendants. She was returning home from a night shift at the factory that day when she was suddenly seized. Although she was unmarried, she did not want to marry the defendant and asked that he be punished. Her younger sister, Xiaofenzi, testified that she was having breakfast at home when she heard her sister screaming for help outside, so she rushed out, only to find that she had been seized. After inquiring about her location, she tracked her to the place but was blocked by Wang Zhangshi and pushed down the stairs, injuring her foot. As she spoke, she lifted her trouser leg, revealing a bruise. The judge questioned the defendant, Ji Yulong, who confessed that he and Dafenzi were cousins. In the past, his mother had betrothed Dafenzi to him, but after his father died, her mother regretted the engagement. He admitted that the eight characters were written by a fortune teller at the request of a friend named Shen and that he had gathered a crowd to seize the girl. Wang Zhangshi confessed that she had rented the remaining room to Ji Yulong and lent him a bed because he had no furniture. However, she denied pushing Xiaofenzi down. The judge then ordered both defendants to be remanded in custody separately, with a postponement for further investigation and questioning.</p>

<h3>Carlton to Screen Shaanxi Disaster Film</h3>
<p>Living Skeletons Use Leaves as Delicacies</p>
<p>Both See Famous Films and Save Disaster Victims</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously received several reels of Shaanxi disaster films from the Shaanxi Emergency Relief Committee, requesting their distribution to various movie theaters for screening. The bureau believed that the disaster situation in Shaanxi was extremely severe, and relief was urgently needed. Since the Emergency Relief Committee had photographed disaster films, they should be widely publicized. They sent personnel to contact major movie theaters. It is now learned that the film will first be screened at the Carlton. The theater believes that the matter concerns charitable deeds and has agreed to screen it at 10:00 AM on Friday and Saturday of this week, and will also screen famous blockbusters to adjust the audience's interest. Ticket prices will be reduced to 40 cents for downstairs and 80 cents for upstairs. All proceeds from the tickets will be allocated to the Emergency Relief Committee for distribution to the disaster area. The screening costs will be donated by the Carlton.

<h3>China Merchant Tram Company Changes New Ride Passes for Factory and Shipyard Workers</h3>
<p>Implemented from July 1st</p>
<p>The China Merchant Tram Company previously had a dispute over the ride passes issued to workers at the Ordnance Factory and Jiangnan Shipyard, which has not yet been resolved. It is now learned that the company issued these ride passes temporarily in 1927 as preferential ride passes, totaling 4,800. These included 2,300 for the Gaochang Temple Ordnance Factory, with a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan, 1,000 for the Longhua Ordnance Branch Factory, with a monthly subsidy of 30 yuan, and 1,500 for the Jiangnan Shipyard, with a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan. Later last year, the company requested the factory and shipyard to cancel the ride passes, change them to monthly or quarterly passes, or increase the monthly subsidy. The Public Utility Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Social Affairs Bureau intervened and consulted with both the factory and shipyard and the company to mediate, but there were no results, causing delays. As a result, there were occasional disputes between tram workers and factory workers over riding the tram. It is now learned that Lu Zhonglin, the director of the lighting department of the company, directly negotiated with the factory and shipyard regarding the ride passes due to the relationship with electricity, and an exchange of conditions has resolved the ride pass issue. New passes have been exchanged, and the factories and shipyards have slightly increased the monthly subsidy. It is approved that the new ride passes will be exchanged from July 1st, and the ride pass disputes can be peacefully resolved from then on.</p>
<h3>Liang Junzhen Loses Her Footing and Sues</h3>
<p>Liu A'bao Abandons Her After Seduction</p>
<p>Junzhen's Mother Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Liang Xushi, residing at No. 87 Tong'an Lane, Medhurst Road, has a daughter named Liang Junzhen, 29 years old, who is quite beautiful. She often visited an old friend, Chen, to play. Chen's cohabitant, a man named Liu A'bao (also known as Liu Zibiao), although over forty years old, had not diminished his lust. Seeing Junzhen's attractive appearance, he used all means of seduction to achieve his desire. At first, he exchanged greetings and conversations, then used sweet words and honeyed phrases. Junzhen was young and ignorant, and in February of last year, she was seduced into committing adultery at the Phoenix Hotel. Later, A'bao lied to Junzhen that he had no wife and said that he would choose a date to marry her soon. Junzhen believed him to be true and followed his words, never letting her mother know. In November of last year, he tricked Junzhen into renting a house on Qingpu Road and living with him. At the same time, he forced Junzhen to sign a document severing their mother-daughter relationship. However, Junzhen had been educated and thought it was inappropriate, so she refused to sign. But A'bao harbored a grudge from then on. Later, he forced Junzhen to go home. At this point, Junzhen had no choice but to tell her mother the truth. Liang Xushi learned the truth and hired a lawyer a few days ago, filing a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court under Article 257 of the Criminal Law for disrupting the family and enticing a woman under the age of twenty to leave her parental rights.</p>

The lawsuit stated that the plaintiff's wife, Sun, had come to Shanghai from her hometown only half a month ago. Unexpectedly, the cousin Jinke took advantage of her husband's absence on the first of this month to entice his wife to go out and play, tricking her into Room 6 of the Xinda Zhong Hotel on Fourth Avenue, threatening to prevent her from making a sound, and forcibly raping her, committing arbitrary indecency. At the time, the plaintiff thought that Sun was unfamiliar with the roads and could not return home after playing, so he went out to search everywhere but could not find her. It was not until the next day that his wife returned home, repeatedly trying to commit suicide, that he learned the truth. He then twisted the defendant to the Old Gate Police Station and sent him to the Special District Court on the fourth of this month. Unexpectedly, the defendant had great connections and sought bail for release, causing the plaintiff to wait all day without any progress. Therefore, he had no choice but to file another lawsuit.</p>

<h3>Seeking to Dissolve Engagement After Many Years of Failure to Marry</h3>
<p>Shen Yaxian, a woman from Yuyao, is currently 25 years old and lives at Wansheng Bridge, Ximen. In the summer of 1929, she became engaged to Shao Zhixiang, a fellow villager, through matchmakers Jiang and Qi. At the time, it was stated that they would marry the following year. However, the marriage never materialized. Shen then asked the original matchmakers to urge him to marry at his residence, but there was no progress. Therefore, Shen filed a petition with the court for mediation, but it was still ineffective. She then formally sued Shao, requesting the dissolution of the engagement. It is heard that this case will be tried soon.</p>
<h3>Husband Requests Divorce Due to Wife's Mental Illness</h3>
<p>He Chengzhe, a native of Qingpu, residing at No. 1 Yuqing Li, Xiejiao Manufacturing Bureau Road, currently employed at Xinda Kiln Factory, formerly married Xu (Xuezhao). The couple had a deep affection for each other. However, due to Xu's prolonged mental illness, making it difficult to live together, he engaged lawyer Xu Guowei to request a divorce from the local court's mediation office. The petition stated, in brief, that the petitioner married Xu Xuezhao in the first month of the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918). They lived together for over ten years with great affection. Unexpectedly, on February 15th of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), Xu suddenly suffered from a mental illness. Various Western doctors were consulted, but to no avail. Initially, she was temporarily lucid in the nineteenth year (1930), but on July 9th, the condition suddenly worsened. She beat relatives, destroyed belongings, tore clothes, and was sleepless day and night. She was sent to Xin Puyu Tang Mental Hospital for treatment, but she has not recovered. The defendant has five children. The petitioner also has an 84-year-old grandmother to care for, and no help at home. Therefore, he has no choice but to request a divorce. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Zhenhai specially opened the Sixth Tribunal for the trial. The defendant, Xu Xuezhao, did not appear. Only the petitioner and his lawyer were present. According to He Chengzhe's testimony, he is 34 years old, from Qingpu, and currently works in the brick and tile business. (Question) Do you want a divorce? (Answer) Yes, because she has a mental illness. (Question) If there is no proof of mental illness? (Answer) There is. He then presented a bundle of prescriptions. (Question) Do you know if she can't be cured? (Answer) She has been ill for two years. The Judge stated that although the new law allows for divorce in cases of mental illness, it must be proven incurable to be lawful. Lawyer Xu rose and requested the court to conduct an assessment. The Judge said that since the defendant was not present today, mediation was not possible. He then asked the petitioner about the children's ages. (Answer) The oldest is twelve, the youngest is three. The Judge said that since she has five children, morality must be considered. You should still try your best to treat her, otherwise it would not be acceptable in terms of human sentiment. (Answer) I have repeatedly consulted famous Western doctors, but to no avail. As the petitioner works outside every day, and there are only the elderly grandmother and five children at home, there is no one to manage the household. This divorce is truly a last resort. (Question) How much property do you have? (Answer) About ten thousand yuan. (Question) How much do you earn monthly? (Answer) A monthly income of one hundred yuan. The Judge said, then the family has enough to live on. It would be better to reconcile outside of court. (Answer) I request the court to summon the defendant to court for mediation again. However, the defendant is no longer at Xin Puyu Tang, but resides at her mother's house (No. 180, Xiangshan Road, Gong'an Road, Zhabei). At this point, Lawyer Xu stated, "Please summon the defendant's mother to court next time." Judge Zhao approved the request and adjourned the court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over a Missing Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>Wu Shunquan, a native of Wuxi, 44 years old, works as a special agent in the French Concession police force. He lives at No. 25, Tongkang Li, South Chujia Bridge, French Concession. Although Wu is over forty, he has no children. He was introduced by acquaintances Shen Xingquan and Fu Yulong to purchase Qiao Yisheng's daughter, an adopted daughter, from Yangzhou, who runs a rattan chair shop in Qinglong Bridge, Nanshi, for 200 yuan. The girl is thirteen years old this year. After arriving at Wu's house, she ran away without Wu's notice just four months after she arrived. After Wu's adopted daughter suddenly disappeared, he negotiated with Shen and Fu. Shen and others immediately went to Qiao's store to inquire, but Qiao had already moved to avoid them. Helpless, they paid attention to the investigation, hoping to uncover the truth. After several months, there was still no clue. Until yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, Shen and others happened to be passing by Nancang Street outside Xiaonanmen, when they suddenly saw Qiao's wife, Chen, coming. After meeting, they immediately</p>

<p>seized her and handed her over to police officer Yu Tong of the 15th post at that location, who took her back to the Third Precinct of the First District. During the preliminary interrogation by the police chief, Qiao Chen confessed that she was 33 years old, from Yangzhou, and currently worked as a helper in a certain family's home at the Zilaishui Bridge in the northern city. She confirmed that her daughter, Feng, was sold to Wu Shunquan as an adopted daughter through the introduction of Shen Xingquan and Fu Yulong in June of last year.

The original parties were ordered to be temporarily detained separately, pending further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Two People Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>A Man and a Woman, Each with Their Own Troubles</p>
<p>Liu Jifu: Liu Jifu, a 26-year-old native of Hubei, came to Shanghai from his hometown a few days ago, intending to ask friends to help him find a job. However, after arriving in Shanghai, he was unfamiliar with the place and unable to find his friends. The night before last at 11:00 PM, he went to Changzhou New Inn on North Zhejiang Road, booked room number 16, paid the room fee of five jiao of small change, and was left with a few copper coins. Thinking about his future, he felt hopeless and swallowed poison to commit suicide. At about 1:00 AM the next morning, the tea boy discovered him and reported it to the Hui Si Police Station. Officer No. 241 was dispatched to the scene and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that he took too much poison and his life is in danger.</p>
<p>Chen Xu: Chen Genxi, a Ningbo native living at No. 4, Lane 6, Yuanji Li, Tangshan Road, works for the Japanese firm, Yi Na Shi Yoko, earning several tens of yuan per month. He used to be able to maintain the family. Unfortunately, Chen is addicted to gambling and never returns home, neglecting his family. His wife, Xu (21 years old), felt the hardship of life. The night before last, she had an argument with Chen. Chen did not return home that night. She was overwhelmed with grief and swallowed raw opium to commit suicide.

<h3>Handless Male Corpse Found on Donggoupao Beach</h3>
<p>Qian Zuomin, the police chief of the Fourth Squad of the Wusong Water Patrol Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was patrolling to Donggou Port with water police Qian Chuntang and others on a patrol boat at about 4:00 PM yesterday when they spotted a corpse on the shallow beach. They immediately went forward to inspect it. It was a male corpse, about thirty years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, black foreign socks, and cloth shoes. The face was already blurry and difficult to identify. The whole body was rotten, and both hands were missing, which was very tragic. Judging from the circumstances, it seemed that he had been washed ashore from somewhere else by the tide. The police checked the body and found a leather wallet in a bag containing two silver dollars and six jiao of small change. There was nothing else. Chief Qian immediately returned to the squad to report, and squad leader Ding Xiaoping reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau. He also notified the Lifesaving Bureau and ordered the local security to file a request with the local court for an examination.</p>

<h3>Aftermath of Lu Abao's Suicide Attempt</h3>
<p>Lu Abao, a Suzhou tailor, worked at Zhu Huiqing's clothing shop, a native of Changshu, at No. 80, Jiucang Street in the city. Recently, due to mounting debts and economic pressure, he attempted to hang himself upstairs at about 9:00 PM the night before last. He was discovered and the Second District First Precinct was notified. Chief Xu dispatched patrolman Wang to take Lu Abao to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. Because he was discovered early, his life was not in danger. Yesterday, Zhu Huiqing, the owner of the clothing shop, heard that Abao's suicide attempt was due to the pressure from Shen Baorong, a fellow tradesman, who demanded six yuan in dues. Fearing this, Lu went upstairs to hang himself. Zhu then seized Shen Baorong and handed him over to patrolman Guo Zhongyuan, and accused Shen of coercing Lu Abao to commit suicide. After questioning Shen Baorong, Chief Xu learned that the dues owed by Lu Abao were returned at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 16th), and that Lu Abao's suicide was around 4:00 PM on the same day, so there was no forced pressure. Chief Xu did not have concrete evidence and decided to wait for an investigation.</p>

<h3>Xi Taosheng Saved After Jumping into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>At 9:45 PM the night before last, a young man hailed Sampan No. 888 at the Jiujiang Road Wharf and claimed to be crossing the river. Unexpectedly, when they reached the center of the river, the young man suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. The sampan man was quick and used the remaining light from the shore's electric lights to quickly rescue him, preventing him from drowning. He was immediately sent to the Water Police Station. After questioning by the head of the police station, he confessed that his name was Xi Taosheng, 21 years old, from Gaojia Xingren, Pudong. He came to Shanghai to make a living but failed and suffered economic pressure, so he became disillusioned with the world. Three pairs of suicide notes were found on his person, addressed to his parents, brothers, and sisters, stating his economic plight and his decision to say goodbye. The head of the police station ordered him to stay in the police station overnight. Yesterday, Detective Wu Rongsheng was ordered to send him back home.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of Catching Adultery is Extortion</h3>
<p>Chen Xingzhen (aka Yu Chen), a widow living at Yu Jiazhai, Hongqiao Town, West Shanghai, is 32 years old. Her husband died last autumn, leaving behind one son and one daughter. Although Xingzhen is still attractive, and unused to sleeping alone, she has a relationship with Tang Heshang, the owner of Tang Xieji Rice Shop in Hongqiao Town. Recently, they have become even more intimate, as if they were a married couple. Around 4:00 AM the day before yesterday, she was caught in adultery by a group of villagers including Wang Jianqiu (also known as Xing Gao), who apprehended the adulterer Tang Heshang, along with Chen Xingzhen, and dragged them out of bed, tying them to pillars, and extorting 200 yuan from Tang as their entertainment expenses. At that time, the two lovers were completely naked, which was quite pitiful. Later, Tang's uncle, Tang Meiting, found out and reported it to Police Chief Pan Xueceng of the local police station. The police chief ordered them to put on their clothes and, along with Wang Jianqiu who caught the adultery, were sent to the First Precinct of the Sixth District. Wang, the police chief, believed that both the man and woman were shameless, and Wang Jianqiu dared to gather a crowd for extortion, which was inappropriate. He immediately prepared a document to send to the court for legal interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shen Heshang Murders His Wife</h3>
<p>The Harm of Gambling: Family Ruined and Home Destroyed</p>
<p>Testimony of an Adopted Daughter Reveals What Happened</p>
<p>Shen Heshang, who lived in Jiazhaizhai, near Yangjing, Pudong, was a plasterer by trade. He married Zhang, who is currently 34 years old. He had some savings and came to Shanghai to open Yongshun Inn on Pingjili Road in the French Concession. The business was good, but Shen had an addiction to gambling. He regularly asked his wife for money to gamble. Recently, Shen borrowed more than 100 yuan from someone in the name of Yongshun Inn and lost it all. The creditor asked Zhang for the money. Because she had affection and righteousness of husband and wife, she solved the situation. As a result Shen suspected that Zhang had quite a bit of savings, so he lured her back to the countryside at the end of the first month and demanded 200 yuan from her. When he didn't get the money, he hit her head with an ax, causing injury and bleeding. Shen did not send her to the hospital. Instead, he locked her in a room with a huge chain. In the middle of the second month, Zhang died of her injuries. Shen pretended that she died of illness and had a hasty funeral. Her uncle, Zhang Meigui, realized this and thought that his niece's death was very strange and there were rumors. Without any evidence, he dared not sue. Later, Zhang's adopted daughter, Lingdi, 12 years old, described in detail how her mother was injured by her father's chop and locked up. He immediately filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting redress. The police were sent to summon Lingdi to the case the day before yesterday. After the preliminary trial, they went to arrest Shen Heshang, but he had already escaped. The police are currently tracking him down.</p>
<h3>Chen Sheng Da, Owner of a Fishing Boat, Taken Hostage</h3>
<p>Chen Sheng Da, a Ningbo fishing boat, recently loaded fresh fish from Ningbo and came to Shanghai to sell it through a shipping agent. While sailing to the Jishan waters, they suddenly encountered a large group of pirates in several pirate ships who were blocking a merchant ship and robbing it. When Chen's boat captain, Hao, saw this, he immediately ordered his crew to set sail and speed away to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, there were two small boats ahead, which were pirate scout ships. The pirate ship in the rear opened fire, and the two scout ships heard the sound and surrounded Chen's ship, forcing them to stop. Seeing the situation, Chen's ship could not escape and had to lower their sails and stop. Three pirate ships in the rear also chased them, forcing Chen's ship to return. The pirates monitored them from behind. When they reached a bay on the south side of Jishan, they told Chen's ship to dock. The pirates swarmed aboard, with thirty to forty people, armed with guns or knives and sticks, all speaking the Taizhou dialect. Captain Hao hid in the cabin, but was dragged out by the pirates and forced to hand over money. Hao handed over 200 yuan in banknotes hidden in his quilt. The pirates were dissatisfied and wanted Hao to go up the mountain. Hao begged and pleaded, but to no avail. He was taken to the pirate ship. The pirates then searched the bodies of the crew, confiscating all their silver dollars, bedding, and clothes. Before leaving, they told the crew to quickly prepare money to redeem the captain. One of the crew resisted being searched and was shot dead on the spot. Yesterday, two of Chen's crew came to Shanghai to report to the shipping agent, borrow money, and find a way to redeem the captain. At the same time, they asked the shipping agent to request the offshore water police to arrest the pirates.</p>

He assisted the Chinese police and shot Zhang's left leg with a rifle. The bullet passed through, and blood flowed non-stop. He fell to the ground.

<p>Special Document</p>
<h3>Bank of China Business Report for the Year 19 of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the war in the Northwest dragged on for four or five months, spreading across five or six provinces, causing losses of hundreds of millions to both public and private sectors. Externally, the market was depressed, inventories piled up, unemployment increased, silver prices plummeted, and financial strength decreased. The entire world was in a state of depression. China was hit hard by both of these factors. Therefore, the impact on national finance, social economy, industry, and commerce was drastic and profound, unprecedented in decades. The duty of banking is to support industry and commerce and develop society. Therefore, the impact on finance, economy, industry, and commerce inevitably affects banks. How can banks stand on their own to avoid the shock of this storm, and further fulfill their responsibility for relief and assistance, to establish the national economic organization on a solid foundation? This is indeed the responsibility that bankers should bear, and yet they are ashamed of their weakness. With the close and widespread relationship between the Bank of China and the state and society, we feel the importance of our responsibility even more deeply. We have been conscientious and diligent throughout the year, daring not to be negligent, still fearing that we are not doing even one or two tenths of what we should. This is what we deeply regret, and we dare not be more vigilant, hoping that the efforts of this bank for the benefit of society can progress with each year. We also hope that society will encourage and guide us from time to time, so that we can better understand how to strive. This is not only the good fortune of one bank. Therefore, we will separately describe the progress of the bank's business in the 19th year, the changes in the world economy and silver prices in that year, and the state of China's foreign trade, market finance, agriculture, and industry, in order to clarify the relationship between China and the world, and thus clarify the relationship between this bank and the state and society. We do not dare to be verbose.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Bank of China's Business in the 19th Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>In the 19th year of the Republic of China, at a time of many internal and external events, the business of this bank still made daily progress compared to the 18th year. This is because the bank's sound policies have gained a true understanding from society, and the various reforms of operations in that year have also yielded noteworthy results. This is something that can be told to the shareholders with comfort. We will describe it in detail below:</p>
<p>Deposits: The balance of current deposits in the 19th year was 416,388,815.56 yuan, an increase of 33,603,230.09 yuan compared to the 18th year. The balance of fixed deposits was 69,688,902.30 yuan, an increase of 14,377,896.11 yuan compared to the 18th year. The total increase was 47,981,126.20 yuan. The most significant phenomenon was that the increase was mostly from private industrial and commercial sectors and groups, while there was a decrease from government agencies. This is due to the bank's excellent business policy of seeking to be closer to society and the industrial and commercial sectors, fulfilling its responsibility of serving the public on the one hand, and avoiding parallel lines with the Central Bank on the other, and aiming to be a true international exchange bank. Fortunately, these aspirations have been realized. The composition of the increased portion of deposits and the amount of the decrease in agency deposits are listed below. Agency deposits decreased by 3,939,945.96 yuan compared to the 18th year. Industrial and commercial deposits increased by 31,466,485.17 yuan compared to the 18th year, accounting for 66 percent of the increase. Groups and individuals increased by 16,957,454.91 yuan compared to the 18th year, accounting for 34 percent of the increase.</p>
<p>Loans: The balance of current loans in the 18th year was 309,229,557.53 yuan, a decrease of 4,424,150.52 yuan compared to the 18th year. The balance of fixed loans was 109,384,845.82 yuan, an increase of 12,931,420.91 yuan compared to the 18th year. Regarding loans, the bank has adhered to the principle of assisting industrial and commercial enterprises. All undertakings that can increase national productivity and improve the people's livelihood have been supported with effort to help them succeed. Observing the following loan figures, one can see where the bank's spirit lies and how it conforms to the business policy declared by the bank in the 18th year, so that society's trust in the bank will increase day by day and month by month. Agency loans decreased by 3,215,629.81 yuan compared to the 18th year. Interbank loans decreased by 21,826,410.45 yuan compared to the 18th year. Commercial loans increased by 11,090,340.45 yuan compared to the 18th year. Industrial loans increased by 11,649,343.73 yuan compared to the 18th year. Loans to groups and public utilities increased by 4,199,110.45 yuan compared to the 18th year. Individual loans increased by 2,239,760.88 yuan compared to the 18th year.</p>
<p>According to this year's balance sheet, the current deposits and current loans each include the foreign exchange department, which receives and pays foreign currency. At the end of the 19th year, the unconverted sum was approximately 46 million yuan, which is not included in the above comparison figures.</p>
<p>Marketable Securities: The value in the 19th year was 65,085,123.84 yuan, an increase of 31,874,523.82 yuan compared to the 18th year. Because deposits increased, and for the purpose of using the surplus and increasing investment in gold, efforts were made to ensure the security of assets, so the increase was substantial. The composition analysis of gold and silver bonds is as follows:</p>
<p>19th year 18th year</p>
<p>Silver coins 62.5 75.0</p>
<p>Gold coins 37.5 25.0</p>
<p>The bank's investment in gold and silver bonds adopts a diversification strategy, not concentrating on one or two types, in order to reduce risk. The settlement price of the bonds, domestic debts are settled at 80% of the market price at the end of the year, and foreign debts are settled at 80% of the market price, and the shilling is discounted at 80% of the market price. This can avoid the various effects of wild bond falls and shilling rises, and ensure the certainty of assets.</p>
<p>Real Estate: In the 19th year, the value of operating properties and equipment was 8,304,496.53 yuan, an increase of 1,918,212.22 yuan compared to the 18th year. The bulk of the increase was the purchase of land behind the bank on Renji Road, Yuemingyuan Road by the Shanghai branch, for the need to rebuild the head office and the Shanghai branch. At the same time, land was also purchased in Hongkou and Tongfu Road for the need to rebuild the Hongkou and West District offices, at a total cost of about 1.6 million yuan. The purchase of this land was just before the sharp rise in land prices, which indirectly benefited from the purchase. The current location of the head office and Shanghai branch is narrow and old, and urgently needs to be rebuilt. The construction cost of the new building is not small at a time when materials are unusually expensive. For the sake of even distribution of the burden, it is proposed to gradually withdraw a fund from the annual surplus for preparation.</p>
<p>Issuance of Convertible Notes: The balance of issuance in the 19th year was 203,847,443.89 yuan, an increase of 619,156.91 yuan compared to the 18th year. The increase was not significant. The number of issues in Shanghai decreased from 131,902,715 yuan to 130,612,680 yuan, a decrease of 1,290,035 yuan. This is because the country was unstable, commerce was hindered, and there was an apparent surplus of currency. The bank had to shrink slightly so that the social currency would not have an unnatural expansion. The bank's immediate interests were not considered.</p>
<p>Cost of Manufacturing Convertible Notes: It is not appropriate to list this item under assets. In the report of the 18th year, it was stated that it was planned to withdraw it completely within one or two years. The bank's performance was good this year, so it has been fully implemented. The "Cost of Manufacturing Convertible Notes" item is no longer visible under the asset items of the bank's balance sheet, so that the assets can be accurately audited, which is expected to be welcomed by all shareholders.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Most of the bank's branches have long been engaged in foreign exchange. On July 1 of the 19th year, the head office established a foreign exchange department to expand its foreign exchange business. At a time when the world market was depressed, trade was sluggish, and gold prices fluctuated, it failed to make sufficient progress. The bank focused on promoting international trade while proceeding cautiously. All domestic merchants engaged in import and export businesses were assisted to their satisfaction. Therefore, many foreign merchants who had no contact with Chinese banks in the past were also happy to do business with the bank. Because foreign manufacturers were not clear about the nature of such customers and the collateral they provided, domestic merchants and agencies who ordered goods from abroad mostly entrusted the bank to act as an intermediary and provide mutual guarantees. Within six months, the bank's import usance and letters of credit amounted to approximately US$3 million. The business of the London office also increased day by day. With the understanding of the Japanese government and the assistance of Japanese counterparts, the Osaka office obtained a permit and will soon open. It is hoped that the establishment of the Osaka office will benefit Sino-Japanese trade and live up to the expectations of traders in both countries. All the bank's colleagues are honored to be involved.</p>
<p>Profit and Loss: The net profit in the 19th year was 2,085,944.77 yuan. After deducting one-tenth according to regulations, that is, 208,594.48 yuan as public reserve, and apportioning 10% interest to official shares and commercial shares, totaling 1,729,735 yuan, the remaining 147,615.29 yuan was added to the rolling account. Although the net profit this year was not much increased compared to the 17th and 18th years, the withdrawal of the cost of manufacturing convertible notes and the realistic settlement of the value of marketable securities were all intended to ensure the certainty of assets and the safety of equity. Not only does it increase the intangible net profit of shareholders, but also the bank's position as a financial center can be relied upon to maintain it without falling. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, yesterday's conflict between our department's naval police and the fare collector of tram No. 23 was reported inaccurately in your newspaper, which is related to the reputation of our department. Therefore, we are detailing the course of events for your information and request that you make corrections as soon as possible. On the 16th of this month, Naval Police Xu Yaolin was pushed down and injured by the ticket seller of French tram No. 23 when the tram was about to arrive at the station. When questioning them, they first cursed and then gathered a crowd to assault him. The French Concession police took the ticket seller and Officer Xu to the police station for examination, and the injuries were confirmed. As for the tram company, knowing they were in the wrong, they sent the company's chief auditor, accompanied by a police detective, to apologize and settle the matter with our department. However, this is a personal matter, and our department has always maintained discipline and has long been assigned to serve on various ships. There was no return to the team to gather police for revenge, nor was the deputy director disarmed. Perhaps your newspaper's investigation was inaccurate. Please, the editor of your newspaper, correct the letter to avoid confusion. Public trust is of the utmost importance. Yours sincerely, Liu Zhen, director of the South Wharf Inspectorate of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Deputy Director Qiao Songren. May 17th.</p>

<h3>Foch's Diary of the European War Translated by Gu Angruo</h3>
<p>When discussions about the Kongbei [probably refers to a conference or meeting location] ended without result and adjourned, General Haig, the commander-in-chief, was at the Abbeville Conference with General Wilson. Sir Douglas Haig fully realized the danger to the Allied countries after the separation of the British and French armies and strongly advocated finding ways to avoid it. Therefore, he suggested to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that General Foch be appointed as commander-in-chief. His advice was not fully valued at that time.</p>
<p>That evening, General Wilson arrived in Versailles and, after talking with Earl Milner, he came to see me in Paris at 11 p.m. He advocated appointing Clemenceau to be responsible for "determining a more practical cooperation between the two armies and a better use of all available reserves." I questioned him specifically.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, I pointed out to him the futility of this plan, because his proposal would not only fail to simplify things but would also make them more difficult. My reasons were simply included in Earl Milner's notes:</p>
<p>"Regarding General Foch, he has no intention of commanding everything. All he asks is that the two governments explicitly designate him to preside over the highest degree of cooperation between the two commanders-in-chief. In other words, he wants the same position that General Joffre entrusted him with during the 1914 Ypres battle, to preside over more practical cooperation between the British and French armies, but now he hopes that the two Allied governments will formally appoint him."</p>
<p>Marquis Milner and General Wilson both thought this was the best solution under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 26, when the Doullens Conference opened, the situation was roughly like this: "Note: General Haig summoned his army commanders to meet in Doullens, so he had to go to Doullens. The original plan was to hold the conference in Doulieu, but at his request, it was changed to Doullens.) When I arrived in Doullens, it was about 11:30 a.m. Soon after, Marquis Milner also arrived. Commander-in-Chief Haig was receiving reports from his army commanders at the town hall. The meeting was prolonged, so I took the opportunity to visit a nearby elementary school. On October 6, 1914, when I came to Doullens to participate in the competition between the enemy and our army to advance north, I and my staff were stationed in this school. This troop movement, as mentioned earlier, was the one that produced the battles of Yser and Ypres, defeating the enemy. Looking back on the past, I compared the strength, organization, equipment, and various supplies of our army in 1914 with the present. I do not believe that we could have defeated the enemy in 1914, and in 1918 we will be defeated by others.</p>
<p>Making good use of our united strength and holding on to the determination to win, this is still the formula for success. With this wealth and this strength, the problem of defeating the enemy becomes a matter of the will of the supreme commander. If the Allied leaders can open their eyes and pay attention to the endless dangers, and resist these dangers with a close and active spirit of cooperation, I have absolutely no doubt in my mind about the outcome of the war. The battles of the Yser River and Ypres are our precedents.</p>
<p>While we were waiting in the garden of the Doullens town hall for the meeting to begin, I elaborated on these basic concepts in front of the French government officials. The meeting opened in the town hall at 12:45 p.m. The French side included President Clemenceau and La Louche, Generals Foch, Pétain, and Weygand. The British side included Marquis Milner, Commander-in-Chief Haig, and Generals Wilson, Lawrence, and Monckton.</p>
<p>At first, everyone unanimously agreed that Amiens must be rescued and that the success or failure of the war depended on this. I put forward strong opinions on this point. Our battle line had already been pushed back to Belleau Wood, after the battle line of 1916, the most important thing now is not to retreat any further, not to give up even an inch of land, and to do everything possible to defend the existing position. This is the first principle, which must be clearly explained, communicated to the entire army, and implemented immediately, especially to urgently mobilize reserves to facilitate the integration of the Allied forces.</p>
<p>Now, unless troops are drawn from the Arras battle zone, the British army has no troops to send south of the Somme River. The Arras area is in a fierce battle and cannot take care of itself, so the only assistance can come from the French army.</p>
<p>General Pétain then explained his plan. He decided to increase several divisions to be sent to Picardie. The Kongbei Conference proposed sending 15 divisions, and now it is planned to send 24 divisions to Montdidier. In this way, he hopes to expand the front line to the Somme River, but he cannot guarantee this, especially since it takes a whole day to mobilize two divisions of troops, so the expansion of the front line can only be carried out slowly and gradually.</p>
<p>At this point in the meeting, Marquis Milner spoke privately with Clemenceau, and he proposed that I be put in command of the war. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>An Unprecedented Basketball Game</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>The School Workers' Team of Fudan and Jiaotong Universities</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a real basketball fever in our school. There are inter-class games, departmental games for female students, and the Jiangda Basketball Championship. There are games almost every day, so the bulletin board of the physical education department is full of these notices every day.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was Sunday, and there was always a game as usual. I strolled to the bulletin board of the physical education department and a cyan notice with large characters was reflected in my eyes.</p>
<p>An Unprecedented Basketball Game</p>
<p>The school workers' team of our school vs. the school workers' team of Fudan University</p>
<p>Time: May 10, 2 p.m.</p>
<p>All our workers must be armed and prepared for battle, and strive to kill the enemy. Team Leader</p>
<p>This is really unprecedented and extremely novel. I remember that in last year's Jiangda football game, Jiaotong University organized a cheerleading team of school workers to cheer for Jinan University, which was already strange. Now, the school workers of our two schools are actually playing basketball, which is even stranger.</p>
<p>………………………………</p>
<p>The gray-black sky was blowing with slight drizzle. I was sitting in the room, looking at the "Avant-Garde Monthly, Issue 4" purchased by Qiu from Shanghai. Two companions in the room were buried in their books because they had to take the mathematics syllabus exam tomorrow. The large bedroom was silent for a time. I had long forgotten about the unprecedented basketball game, because the drizzle outside was still falling.</p>
<p>"Here they come, here they come," I suddenly heard a voice flying in from outside, and the sound of applause also rose.</p>
<p>At this time, I realized that it must be the Fudan school workers coming. I ran to the window and looked out. They were indeed here. Two people in suits were leading the team. I thought these two must be the heads of the Fudan school workers.</p>
<p>The game started. The students in the dormitory all came out to watch this unprecedented game. The number of people watching was even more than the number of people watching our school's inter-class games. However, the drizzle was still falling. I thought that if there was no rain, there would be even more people watching. I stood in a place without rain and watched.</p>
<p>The captain of our workers' team is the tea boy in the library. The two forwards are one is our lazy tea boy (he is very lazy and was once given a minor demerit by the affairs office) and the other is a cook whom we call the impatient ghost. The two defenders are one is a waiter in the Pearl River Restaurant and the other I don't recognize, seems to be a gardener.</p>
<p>Laughter filled the court. The students also cheered. Their skills are really good, and the strength of the two teams is very even. Because of the nature of their duties, they hardly have any practice every day, but they actually have such good results, which is beyond my expectations.</p>
<p>The referee in the suit was speaking English all the time. I don't know if those workers could understand him.</p>
<p>In the first game, our workers' team lost, by about four or five points. The students were anxious for them, shouting "Add oil," "Automobile oil," "Sesame oil" non-stop. The second game started. Our lazy tea boy lost too many goals in the first game, so he was replaced by a worker from who knows where. This time, he really boosted his courage a hundredfold, charged into battle, and defeated Fudan completely. Their faces changed from anxiety to smiles. I wondered where this newly replaced worker came from. A classmate next to me said, "He is the tea boy who specializes in cleaning classrooms."</p>
<p>Ha, ha, the impatient cook's face was covered in blood. It was flowing from his nose. He wiped it with his hand, and his face was covered in it. He still bravely fought on, because there was not much time left. The students were all laughing so hard they were bent over.</p>
<p>The old woman at the school gate and the wives of the tea boys all ran over to watch. The children were jumping around in the field. Several workers were so happy that they shouted loudly and jumped up. This - this is nothing more than a phenomenon of victory.</p>
<p>Time was up. The students cheered for them. Each face contained a smile and went back to the dormitory.</p>
<p>But they - the workers - still have a lot to do.</p>
<p>An unprecedented basketball game came to an end. Three minutes later, there was no one on the court. The rain was still falling lightly in the sky.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Holds a Cleanliness Campaign</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Jiaotong University, in view of the fact that all diseases are caused by uncleanliness, and that summer is approaching and plagues will once again wreak havoc, and that students' health is closely related to their studies, in order to prevent students from contracting the plague, in addition to ordering the school doctor to give vaccinations, it also held a cleanliness campaign on the 15th of this month for one day. The offices, factories, libraries, and gymnasiums of each department were all thoroughly cleaned by the servants. The walls were whitewashed and the paint was brand new. The student dormitories were tidied up by the students themselves, and the training department and the health department of the student union sent people to inspect them separately.</p>
<p>The inspection process divided the entire school dormitory into one, two, and three areas. The South Dormitory of the New Middle Courtyard was the first area, the West Dormitory of the Upper Courtyard and the Middle Courtyard was the second area, and the New Dormitory and the Girls' Dormitory were the third area. Each area had four inspectors, two from the training department, one from the health department of the student union, and two from the school medical office. The purpose of the inspection was only to ensure cleanliness, not to emphasize splendor. After the inspection, the inspectors scored separately. Each area took three names. The first place was awarded a silver cup, the second place was awarded a large silver shield, and the third place was awarded a medium-sized silver shield. The names of the classmates in the room were written on them to show encouragement and leave a souvenir.</p>
<p>The results of the inspection were that the first place in the first area was No. 30 South Dormitory, the second place in the second area was No. 2 Girls' Dormitory, the room of Ms. Wu and Ms. Tao, and the first place in the third area was the room of Hu Keshi and Li Quansun in the New Dormitory. The overall condition of each room in the school was satisfactory. 70% of the rooms scored above 60 points, 30% scored above 70 points, 20% scored above 80 points, and only 5% scored above 90 points.</p>
<p>Among the three districts, the highest average score was given to the Girls' Dormitory, the room of Ms. Wu and Ms. Tao. It was not known where all the scattered items in the room were hidden. The bed was covered with a white blanket and a red quilt. One was white and flawless, and the other was bright and dazzling. There was not a speck of dust on the floor. The table was covered with lacquered cloth and placed with flower vases and other items. When the inspectors arrived, they all praised it. All four unexpectedly gave it a score of 95 points.</p>
<p>After the scores were announced, the training director of the training department awarded the prizes. The training director also gave a speech, saying, "Now Mr. Cai Yuanpei has a proposal in the National Assembly for a rectification of the education program, one of which is an order for school authorities to pay attention to health training. The cleanliness campaign of our school is the first of its kind in universities and is quite in line with Mr. Cai's proposal. In the future, it is planned to propose at the academic affairs meeting that a cleanliness campaign be held twice a year, once on May 15 and once on October 15, and that a day off be given on both days." From this, it can be seen that the authorities of Jiaotong University pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene. It is hoped that all universities in the country will hold and promote cleanliness in succession, and not let Jiaotong University be exclusively beautiful in the front.</p>
