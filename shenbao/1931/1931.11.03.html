<p>對省教費提出救濟辦法（二）</p>
<p>一應請中央體念江蘇水災奇重報收减少於二十年度内每月補助江蘇教育經費十五萬元以資維持也查往年中央對於湖北安徽等收支不數省分按月本有協欵近以湖北災區甚大困難愈甚聞中央協助湖北省之欵每月比前加增二十萬元該省教育經費因此亦得維持江蘇今年水災區域之廣災情之重不亞於湖北等省中央　　念鄂省於前必能體念蘇省於後故攞請於二十年度全年内每月由中央補助江蘇教育經費十五萬元以實維持蘇省與鄂省同係患省分困難情形既同諒中央必能一視同仁照例予以援助</p>
<p>一應遵照國民政府明令公布之中華民國十九年度試辦預算章程及劃分國家地方收支標準將國立中央大學經費一百三十二萬元全部劃歸財政部支付而不復由江蘇教育經費管理處支付也查十八年八月間三十四次政會議曾决議國立中央大學經費永久由江蘇教育經費管理處每年撥給一百三十二萬元一案當時所以有永久二字者因蘇省教育專欵内本有田賦派欵及屠牙税爲國家收入故中央大學經費不妨永久由蘇教育經費管理處每年撥給若干萬元但自十九年度試辦預算章程經政府明今公布施行後全部田賦及屠牙税均已劃歸爲地方收人且在支出標準方面明文規定國立學校之經費應由國家支付而不由地方支付則是就税收之事實言永久二字之根據已不復存在更就法令之明文言國地收支既經劃分鹽税捲烟税通過税特税等等各項大宗而有增加希望之税原既劃歸國家收入而田賦屠牙税營業税等呆板税原劃歸地方收入中央大學一百三十二萬元經費之全部應由財政部支付而不應再由江蘇教育經費管理處支付不惟爲天經地義且爲斟情酌理兩全其美而非兩敗俱傷之正當辦法竊按從前中央大學當局所以希望該校經費之一部分永久由江蘇教育經費管理處撥給者無非以蘇省有教育專欵比較可靠耳然以近數年來之經騐觀之蘇省教育專欵不惟平時每年須短收數十萬元一遇荒年短收之數愈大數年以來總數已逾三百萬元在積極方面以前在十九年試辦預算章程未公布施行前以經費收入之短少尙可作鹽税附加教育經費等之夢想以資補救今則絶對不許再有此種夢想矣是開源無門也在中央大學當局及愛護中央大學者或尙以爲蘇省教育專欵雖年年短收且乏開源之門然每年尙有若干萬元收入孔子云不患寡而患不均欵雖不多若得均分仍屬可靠况中央大學除由江蘇教育經費管理處每年撥給一百三十二萬之外尙可另向財政部領取至少每年六十萬元雙管齊下其計似甚得殊不知均寡均貧政策必至同歸於盡且在蘇省教育專欵困難萬分之時一方既可向財政部領欵一方仍必欲向江蘇教育經費管理處領欵使省立教育機關之專靠管理處欵維持而無部欵挹注者更加爲難於心何忍故爲中大當局及愛護中大者計亟宜援北平數大學例指定比較可靠之的欵爲中大經費或援國立武漢大學等前例呈准以後中大經費指定由蘇皖等省境内國税中如鹽税等項下收入内劃撥如此辦法既可符合國民政府明令公布之十九年度試辦預算章程及劃分國地收支標準且可紓蘇省教育經費之困難使中大與江蘇省立各教育機關不至同受經濟壓迫之痛苦或甚至同歸於盡此乃兩全其美而非兩敗俱傷之上策也</p>
<p>以上所陳之項補救辦法均根據事實及法令而立論可使江蘇教育經費目前支絀情形得以稍紓敬祈鑒核施行實爲公便（完）</p>

<p>美國賑麥運華前經詳記本報嗣以英商天祥洋行祇承載一批而又因海程關係未及進口其已到上海者乃本埠三新廠之定貨今此項賑麥已經美商福來洋行派大批商輪裝運第一批今日可到上海亟將此事詳情查誌如下</p>
<p>美商得標我國定購美國大批賑麥總數逹四十五萬噸其裝運辦法係分批運華今年先裝十萬噸餘俟明春續運又以水脚须廉短故在上海舉行投標當時本埠各輪公司均往認投以最短之價爲合度當時英商各輪公司均投每噸三元一角美金而美商福來投每噸二元九角美金開標之時爲美商福來所得標故此項大宗賑麥遂歸美輪所裝</p>
<p>天祥先運當時英商天祥洋行亦爲投標之一其所認之水脚爲次短價惟首次賑麥由美裝出時滬上裝運之標尙未公開故先托英商天祥洋行派一腦威輪名奈爾甲號Nuolja由美國砵崙開始自十月六日先運七千二百六十噸來滬此爲美國賑麥至華之第一批准今日進口</p>
<p>本日到滬今天先來七千二百六十噸已預定停在招商局北棧碼頭起卸財部已派員來滬騐收第二船即由美商福來洋行派輪承裝昨日該行接得美電二批由十月十二日從美國開出准六號到上海由美輪杜亞號裝運計七千噸亦在招商北棧起卸</p>

<p>抵制日貨是全國人的事情大家對於此項工作要抱定永遠合作永遠抵制的决心</p>
<p>中國人民有如一盤散沙無怪其被日人小覻但是大家從此能團結起來未嘗不可以抵制暴日</p>
<p>何謂公理國人自已以爲可恃其實此乃弱小國民之自慰語在强暴的日本視之等於被棄的廢物一樣</p>
<p>我們爲暴日而請求國際帮忙不若勉勵自已作刻苦的工作</p>

<p>隔斷聲響的新發明大凡住在都市的人成日的被市上的人聲車馬聲包圍着實在覺得頭腦昏脹心神不寗久而久之頗有折減壽命的可能所以一進屋子倘能隔斷屋外的一切聲響這確是現代一件極需要的事情最近却給美國人麥克新氏HMaxim發明丁已在紐約經過一度公開的試騐成績極爲優異近幾年來對於這種類似的發明曾試騐過好多次但是大半都只能施之於新造的屋子在牆壁間設法和外面的市聲隔斷倘要將現成的屋子使用此法那就非重行翻造不可而麥克新氏的發明却不必多這麻煩他也能裝置在已造成的屋子裏這就足以打倒以前的這一類發明了據多數醫學家説聲泿確與人們的神經很有關係所以醫院中更歡迎麥氏的發明使病人們可以日夜的安寗不爲市聲所煩攪而影響於他們的病體</p>

<p>鄉下人想（要講種田的事那纔要請教我們鄉下人了俗語説得好丨惛懂懂六月初三浸稻種丨要眞是七月裏纔派種秧委員下來那可應了（六月初三浸稻種）那句俗語了怪是也難怪他們那班大人物一年到頭打仗的仗打商量國家大事的商量國家大事這種耕田的事是我們赤脚人幹的他們那有這閑工夫管得呢　　鄉下人正在自已給自已　解忽聽一陣轟隆隆的聲音大家都嚷道</p>
<p>（火車來了）（火車來了）</p>
<p>鄉下人認清了這一節是三等車他從前趁四等車的當見車廂外面是四豎的記號現在趁三等車是三豎的記號他想裝畜生的車子大慨是五豎的記號了他隨着許多人推推挽挽的進入三等車中剛踏了進去便嚇得退了出來　　（走差了丨這裏不是三等車啊）</p>
<p>（誰説不是三等車呢？）一個同他一塊兒走進去的人説</p>
<p>（不對啊這裏只怕是臥車吧？）鄉下人依然遲疑不敢走進去</p>
<p>（呸丨白天裏那裏有臥車呢）這個人的乘火車當然比了鄉下人要内行</p>
<p>（那未爲什麽車子裏滿睡着人呢？）</p>
<p>果然那一節三等車裏頭接着頭脚抵着脚却伸腰躺脚的都睡着人那節車子不是一排排的的椅子却是條的椅子因爲大家都擠到前面的幾輛三等車裏去了這後面的幾輛三等車却很空乘火車的都不願意車子有空間大概是一種普通心理所以坐二等車的本來是兩人合坐一椅他見一個椅子空了便也把身軀横下來佔據了這個空間又見頭等車裏空了坐二等車的也覺得空了可惜常常到頭等車裏去佔據這個空間現在三等車裏的人見傍邊的坐位空了他爲什麽不把身體横轉來占他幾個位子呢？</p>
<p>不但如此三等車裏上面有一長條的擱板這是給旅客們安放行李的現在客人少了行李也自然少了有兩位穿黄褲子的朋友拱出了屁股也睡在上面眞個像睡車裏而的有高舖有低舖無怪鄉下人誤認爲走到睡車裏來了</p>

<p>Beiping-Harbin Telegram (1): A train of Japanese armored cars carrying over two hundred Japanese soldiers has passed through Tailai and arrived directly at the riverbank. Once the river bridge is repaired, they will cover Zhang Haipeng's troops in attacking Heihe. (2) Su Bingwen's troops, consisting of one infantry and one artillery regiment, have arrived at the river bridge to jointly defend it with a brigade. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: Ma Zhanshan ordered the Tao'ang Railway Bureau to repair the Jiangqiao Bridge within ten days to prevent the Japanese from finding excuses. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: After the Nenjiang Bridge was destroyed, the Japanese Consul protested again to the Jiang Provincial Government. It is reported that the South Manchuria Railway has now begun to repair it themselves. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: The joint transportation of the South Manchuria Railway and the Ussuri Railway has been suspended, waiting for the Nenjiang Bridge to be repaired. According to Japanese newspapers, if the Nenjiang Bridge is not restored, the meeting will be adjourned because it is related to the transportation of Siping-Taonan and South Manchuria Railways. The Japanese attach great importance to this matter, and the Japanese military has repeatedly sent personnel to threaten Ma Zhanshan to accept the order, but all were rejected. Su Bingwen's troops have returned to Hailar. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Recently, some people have advocated changing Taonan to a province to prevent war on the Qiqihar-Taonan Railway. However, the Japanese are actively undermining this plan and actively assisting Zhang Haipeng's troops in entering Heilongjiang. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Mongol Bandits Launch Surprise Attack on Tongliao <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Armored Cars Occupy the North Station</p>
<p>Yesterday, They Continued to Bombard the City</p>
<p>Zhang Shusen's Troops Defend with All Their Might</p>
<p>Tianjin: Under the cover of four Japanese armored cars, over a thousand bandits launched several surprise attacks on Tongliao on the 1st, all of which were repelled by the Northeast Cavalry Third Brigade led by Zhang Shusen. The armored cars continued to bombard the city from 4:00 AM on the 2nd. Residents took shelter in cellars, and there were not many casualties, but many houses were collapsed. Afterwards, two shells were fired at Tongliao South Station, one landing near the car house and the other landing near the station building. At around 8:00 AM on the 1st, more than 20 Japanese soldiers swarmed to the South Station, looking for trouble in every possible way with fierce momentum. Employees at the South Station held on to the principle of courtesy and concession. The Japanese soldiers, having exhausted their tricks, retreated back to the North Station in disappointment. As of the evening of the 2nd, the armored cars and bandits had not retreated. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Mongol bandit Bao Shan, with the assistance of the Japanese army, attacked Tongliao. The garrison troops led by Zhang Shusen defended with all their might. Bao was shot in the left arm, wounded, and led his troops to escape. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: The Liaoning Provincial Government recently received a telegram from Chief Huang of the Police Department on the 1st, reporting that according to a telegram from Jiang Lianrui, the head of the Tongliao County Public Security Bureau, at 9:00 AM on the 1st, a Japanese plane flew to Tongliao, circled for a long time, and strafed the area outside the north gate of the city with machine guns. At the same time, a Japanese armored car arrived at the Wudaomu Village, eleven miles east of the county, and shelled the city more than ten times, injuring five merchants and civilians. It is currently stationed there. There are two trains of Japanese soldiers at Qianjiadian Station and Dalin Station, and their intention is still to occupy Tongliao. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 31st, four Japanese planes scouted the Daling River area. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Today, news from Chinese in Jinzhou stated that the Japanese are now planning to unite with Mongol bandits to occupy Tongliao, near the border of Manchuria and Mongolia. Four trains of Japanese armored cars, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers and Mongol bandits, arrived two miles from Tongliao yesterday afternoon and began to bombard Tongliao, killing five and injuring dozens. In addition, Japanese planes circled over the city gate and fired machine guns, causing many casualties. The Japanese said they knew nothing about this, only claiming that because the bandit atmosphere was very strong, they sent armored cars along the Siping-Taonan Railway to suppress the bandits, but not to cooperate with them. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Japanese army began repairing the Tongliao railway tracks on the morning of the 2nd, with armored cars following in advance. At noon, they had repaired to outside the foreign flags at the South Station and immediately sent troops to occupy the North Station, raising the Japanese flag. Employees at the station are preparing to retreat. On the evening of the 2nd, the bandits cut off the Siping-Taonan railway tracks and have dispersed, preparing to attack. The situation is serious. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: A Japanese armored car arrived at Daomu Station this morning and fired more than a dozen large cannons. In the afternoon, it fired cannons at Tongliao. Employees of the Siping-Taonan Railway have retreated. The Japanese have repaired the damaged tracks of the Siping-Taonan Railway. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Japanese Embassy Claims</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Troops in Jilin are Gradually Withdrawing <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>One Thousand People Successively Depart for Changchun</p>
<p>Harbin: On the afternoon of the 31st, the Japanese army in Jilin conducted tactical exercises at Jiuzhan, ordering the public to watch and flaunt their sophisticated weapons. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: The Japanese Embassy claimed that the Jilin army had begun to withdraw on October 31st. On the 31st, a detachment of a small part was withdrawn first. On the 1st of this month, an infantry battalion, numbering about one thousand people, continued to withdraw and has successively departed for Changchun. Before the Japanese army withdrew, there were a total of 1,843 people. Now 1,100 people have been withdrawn, and it is hoped that the withdrawal will be completed within four or five days. According to an observation by a foreign military attache, Jilin is completely under Japanese control, and everything requires the assistance of the military, so it will not be easily abandoned. The so-called withdrawal of troops claimed by the Japanese is not reliable, or it is being moved to other places to carry out other conspiracies. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Secret Sino-British Pact <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japan responded to China's proposal to start direct negotiations based on the League of Nations resolution of October 24th, stating that it could not accept it because Japan insisted on recognizing five basic points before withdrawing its troops. Another development in the situation was the remarks made by the Minister of the Army Minami at the cabinet meeting today. What he said was based on the incessant reports coming from northern Manchuria. Minister of the Army Minami stated that although this report has not yet been confirmed, it is not entirely without reason. Official circles also believe that where there's smoke, there's fire, but the report may be exaggerated. Regarding the theory of a secret Sino-British pact, the British have not given a concrete explanation. The feelings of suspicion and resentment of the Japanese government and the public towards Britain will become increasingly deep. The news in the London newspapers denying the success of the Sino-British negotiations on consular jurisdiction is just adding to the Japanese people's doubts because Tokyo has not received this news. There are now two reports that have aroused great resentment. The first is that a secret Sino-British pact has been concluded based on the principle of mutual assistance. China protects and guarantees British economic interests in the Yangtze River, and Britain reciprocates by assisting China in Geneva. The second is that the terms of the Tang Pui-woo case settlement are not made public. Previously, some Japanese believed that it was to favor China to contain Japan. Now, with the addition of the above two reports, British conspiracies are increasingly confirmed. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">East Province Incident <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The United States Pays Close Attention</p>
<p>Washington: According to officials of the State Department, the U.S. government, although there has been no formal exchange of documents with the Chinese and Japanese governments regarding the Manchurian Incident, the U.S. government has not relaxed its efforts to mediate. According to Deputy Secretary of State Rogers, the U.S. government has always attached importance to the progress of the Manchurian Incident. The U.S. government has always taken into consideration recent developments in Nanjing and Tokyo and all reports submitted by both China and Japan to the League of Nations Secretariat. Rogers added that the U.S. State Department and embassies in China and Japan also frequently exchange information on the Manchurian Incident. Diplomats from both China and Japan stationed in the U.S. also have close contact with the State Department. However, the U.S. government has not yet decided what policy it will adopt in the future. The Chinese side will inevitably insist on not negotiating directly with Japan during the period of the Japanese military occupation of its territory, and Japan has not yet expressed its willingness to withdraw its troops before the 16th of this month. The U.S. official circles are extremely worried about the stalemate between the two sides. (1st National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will today send the list of reception committee members appointed by the National Government for the Northeast to Representative Shi at the League of Nations for relay to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and also said that the government is continuing to fulfill the various procedures in the League of Nations resolution, and hopes that the Secretary-General of the League of Nations will pay serious attention to the attitude of Japan towards the withdrawal of troops at any time. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send to Representative Shi the various actions of the Japanese army in the occupied areas of the East Province, compiled from telegrams received from the Vice Minister.

<h3 id="e18">Office Established in Beiping <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Office Will Commence Operations Shortly</p>
<p>Beiping: After the National Government announced the appointment of Gu Weijun, Zhang Zuoxiang, and other seven people as members of the reception committees for various places in the three northeastern provinces, the committee decided to establish an office in Beiping and will commence operations shortly. After preparations are completed, it will notify the League of Nations, Japan, and neutral countries to select two representatives to participate in the organization and further discuss specific methods for receiving the lost territories of the East Province. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Liu Zhe talked about the National Government organizing a reception committee in Beiping based on items A and 5 of Article 4 of the League of Nations. The National Government had previously appointed Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuchang as reception commissioners, but now their previous orders have been revoked and diplomats and legal experts have been appointed as members. A note has been issued to the Japanese government, forwarded by Jiang Zuobin, requesting a reply and sending personnel to China to negotiate the return of the occupied territories, and has notified the League of Nations member states and Chairman Briand, hoping that the countries will select two people to supervise the reception. According to my observation, the Japanese civilian faction also feels that this matter is difficult. When visiting Saionji, they were also unwilling to see the incident escalate and wanted a quick solution. Our country is determined to conduct negotiations within the framework of maintaining territorial sovereignty and national rights in accordance with the League of Nations resolution. As for the protection of overseas Chinese, my side will provide safety guarantees for the lives and property of overseas Chinese in areas outside the occupied territories. Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun will come to Beiping after the Japanese reply is received. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Japan's Diplomatic Strategy <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Ignoring its Own Way</p>
<p>Undermining the Principles of the League of Nations</p>
<p>London: Today's editorial in The Times stated that Japan has the impression that the British representatives in Geneva have adopted an unfriendly attitude towards Japan during the League of Nations discussions on Sino-Japanese negotiations, and that Britain is pursuing an anti-Japanese policy in Nanjing. The Times argues that we sympathize with and admire Japan's construction work in South Manchuria, and we recognize Japan's important interests in Manchuria. The actions of the Chinese in hindering the legitimate business of the Japanese, the mistreatment of Korean farmers by the Chinese, the construction of railways by the Chinese parallel to the South Manchuria Railway in violation of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, and other provocative incidents as claimed by the Japanese can make Japan sound justified. With these facts, Japan seems to be able to stand undefeated in Sino-Japanese negotiations. However, it is even more regrettable that Japan has not first requested assistance from the League of Nations, of which it is a member, but has instead acted arbitrarily in violation of the League of Nations charter. Japan must know that in these unsettled times, even a slight breach of the principles of the League of Nations is enough to cause widespread and terrible consequences, resisting the League of Nations, voluntarily acting according to one's own will, and inflicting destructive blows on other countries' stable politicians and encouraging the opinion of those everywhere who believe that force is the most effective tool for solving stubborn problems. This is why British public opinion criticizes Japan's policy in Manchuria. Japan believes that the actions of the British in Geneva and Nanjing are anti-Japanese policies, but this impression is very untrue. However, if one forcibly seizes the land of another country and declares to the public that one will not return the occupied land until the country has negotiated certain basic issues, this action is to restore obsolete diplomatic strategies that are no longer used and to greatly oppose the spirit of the covenant prohibiting the use of war as a policy tool. Japan is now placing its friends in an extremely difficult position, forcing them to choose between maintaining existing friendships or safeguarding the principles that they have undertaken to uphold in extremely solemn form. It is hoped that Japan will understand this situation before November 16th. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e26">The Methods for Peaceful Resolution of the Manchurian Problem Have Been Exhausted <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japan has become increasingly brazen and disregards everything. On the one hand, it uses the means of colluding with evil forces to disrupt the Northeast in an attempt to achieve its goal of permanent occupation. On the other hand, it fabricates rumors of Sino-Russian cooperation and secret Sino-British pacts to provoke international sentiment. It directly wants to expand the turmoil and will not stop until world peace is destroyed. The resolution on withdrawing troops by a deadline passed before the adjournment of the League of Nations was just to hope that Japan could realize its mistake sooner rather than later. Now, looking at Japan's actions, it not only does not know how to realize its mistake and withdraw troops by the deadline, but also intends to be an enemy of the world. At this point, the important figures of the League of Nations are naturally worried and cannot but consider how to save this crisis. However, the only effective and peaceful method to save this crisis must be seriously considered and may not be resolutely implemented. The attitude of the United States is also still hesitant and has not yet expressed its position. Deputy Secretary of State Rogers yesterday stated the reason for not speaking, and now says that the U.S. government has not yet decided what policy it will adopt. This means that the attitude of the United States is still unfathomable. Although the civil and religious figures of that country today held an all-American peace conference and unanimously advocated arousing world opinion to support the League of Nations to achieve the goal of peaceful resolution of the Manchurian dispute, their sincere and earnest intentions are very touching, but the methods for peaceful resolution have been exhausted, and whether the U.S. government has other peaceful methods to solve the matter besides empty words of advice is difficult to answer.</p>
<p>Therefore, when all peaceful methods in the world have been exhausted, if we want to solve the problem of this violent Japanese aggression in the Northeast, only our Chinese people can rise up and make their own decisions. Although the problem of this violent Japanese aggression in the Northeast is a major problem that destroys world peace, Japan was the first to destroy our territory and destroy our peace, so if our country does not first sacrifice and rise up to fight against the violent Japan, who will be willing to rise up and fight? Although our country has repeatedly endured and tried to maintain this world peace situation at the advice of the League of Nations, since Japan is willing to be the head of the army that destroys world peace and has been progressing step by step until now, can our people finally endure and not rise up to save themselves?</p>

<p>British Liberal Party's George Faction</p>

<p>Seeking Cooperation with the Labor Party</p>
<p>Kirk Dies Young</p>
<p>The Labor Party Loses a Strong General</p>
<p>London, 1st (Reuters) – Although Liberal Party leader George has been elected in this election, there are not many Liberal Party members, and they are divided into two factions. One faction, led by Sir Simon, is known as the National Liberal Party. As for those who still support George, their power is very small. Therefore, George's future position in the political world has become a matter of speculation. Today, George advised the Mengquesde guiding newspaper that the Liberal Party should cooperate with the Labor Party to achieve common goals, saying that there is room for the Liberal Party and the Labor Party to work together for the good of the country. It also said that the Labor Party must know that its scope and conditions of appeal are too narrow and cannot become a true national party for a time. It also said that the proposals of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have many similarities.</p>
<p>July 1st, Guerte Telegraph National Association The former Prime Minister, George, who had been ill for a long time, met with the Associated Press and Mengquesde reporters today and said that he would restore the prestige he lost in the last election with the old battle spirit. George said that he intends to gather the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who are moving forward to engage in drafting a broad reconstruction program. The current national government has no ability to complete the reconstruction undertaking, so it must gather those who can take on this task. The battle line must be wide and deep, and the future of the country will depend on the success of this move. Britain cannot but implement protection taxes, but mere taxation is not enough to solve the financial and economic problems of Great Britain. According to this election, only four members of the Liberal Party were elected, one each for George and his children, leaving three. Some of the remaining party members have joined Sir Simon, while others have supported Samuel as their leader and established another banner.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Reuters) – Kirk, the Secretary-General of the British National Miners' Federation, has died of illness at the age of 46.

A speech can move the audience to a very high boiling point. People in the Labor Party respect him. Now that he has died young, the Labor Party has lost a strong general.</p>

<p>Plans to Convene a Reparations Conference</p>
<p>November 2nd, Harvard Telegraph National Association The French Prime Minister, Laval, returned home from the United States. He arrived at Harvard on the French Island ship at 9:10 this morning. It is heard that Mr. Lai is planning to convene an international conference in Boaritz to discuss Germany's ability to pay reparations. Mr. Lai and the US President, Hoover, have agreed that the postponement of payment of reparations war debts should be initiated by Europe, and the revision of war debts and reparations must first be agreed between France and Germany before discussion. Now that Mr. Lai has returned to Beijing, a very important cabinet meeting will be held to discuss this matter, because the French Congress will reopen at the end of this month. At that time, Mr. Lai's vision will shift from international finance to domestic affairs, and he will prepare to submit the 1932 budget for a vote by the end of March next year, and the new naval program will also be submitted to Congress.</p>
<p>Paris, 2nd (Reuters) – Today is a public holiday, so the masses have time to give a warm welcome to Prime Minister Laval, who has returned from the United States. Mr. Lai was very popular when he landed in Harvard and said to people that he had completed a major mission and the French people fully support Mr. Lai and regard him as being loyal and defending the interests of the country.</p>
<p>Paris, 1st (Reuters) – After talking with the US President and government officials, French Prime Minister Laval returned home by ship and never expressed his opinion on the results of his visit to the United States. However, when the ship arrived in Xiabao, France, this morning, Mr. Lai issued a short talk to a reporter from a Paris newspaper, saying that he and President Hoover had agreed on the financial plan to be adopted after the war debt repayment period expires, but the details of this plan have not yet been determined. The reporter asked whether this method can be interpreted as the United States being willing to reduce the debt owed by the Allied countries to the United States. Mr. Laval replied that this was not a misunderstanding and he was sure that the trip to the United States was very beneficial. In view of this, President Hoover seems to have realistically acknowledged the possibility of reducing the debt owed by the Allied countries to the United States.</p>

<p>November 2nd, Berlin Telegraph National Association Germany's reply to the League of Nations Secretariat's note on the proposal for an arms truce was published in Berlin today. The content stated that Germany's acceptance of this proposal depends entirely on whether neighboring countries accept it. Commenting on this move from Germany's position, it said that the truce proposal must not be considered as fulfilling the obligation of the League of Nations member states to reduce armaments within the Treaty of Versailles. Germany, in any case, recognizes this move only as a preparation for convening an arms reduction conference and cannot be regarded as an achievement. Germany welcomes all those who agree with this conference, but still insists that this conference is not a tool for fixing existing armaments, but a tool for seeking to reduce armaments while not violating the basic principle that all countries have equal interests in seeking national security. Finally, it also asked Secretary-General Drummond to forward its contents to the countries invited to attend the arms reduction conference.</p>

Among the Premier's teachings, the 'loyalty' in national morality, that is, loyalty to the country and loyalty to the nation, is actually loyalty to one's duty, which is loyalty to the country and loyalty to the nation. Some may think that the four words 'loyalty to duty' are very mediocre, but in reality, everyone knows it but no one has fully achieved it, especially in times of danger or emergency, these four words are even more important. Since the Japanese military's atrocities and forceful occupation of the three northeastern provinces, all compatriots and comrades of the party throughout the country have felt that a very dangerous time has arrived. All Chinese people are striving to sacrifice their own lives to save the country from its plight. Therefore, they feel that ordinary duties are not important, believing that there is something greater than this, and want to find another effective method outside of their duties. If they abandon their duties because of this, the patriotic movement will result in the stagnation of all undertakings. They intend to love the country, but the result is that the country suffers a great impact. I believe that loyalty to duty is a very great spirit. Recently, various places have organized volunteer armies to cultivate the strength to overcome imperialism, which is a great manifestation. As for the enemy's artillery fire hitting the top of our office building, while the people working indoors still perform their duties as usual, this greatness surpasses everything, and their courage is no less than that of the volunteer army. In the five counties of Tong, Feng, Pei, Xiao, and Dang in Jiangbei, in the shortest period of time, the original security corps were formed into more than 20,000 volunteer armies, all equipped with firearms. The country has increased its external forces by more than 20,000 people. If, at the same time, the duty of defending the locality is abandoned, the locality will have 20,000 fewer people to protect security. Considering the meaning of internal pacification and external resistance, external resistance is still in the future, while internal unrest has already begun. Central comrades should pay special attention to this matter. Loyalty to duty is the starting point for everything. Our duty has a certain scope. We must not indulge in our duties nor overstep them. For example, the responsibility of the Central Executive Committee or the Standing Committee cannot be abandoned within the scope, nor can it be encroached upon outside the scope. If it is something that the National Congress should do, several executive committee members certainly cannot replace it. This scope is given to him by the National Congress, and he has no power to reduce or enlarge its scope. Now, comrades have many good methods and intentions, and we must respect them and make them succeed. This must be within a reasonable manner and obtain proper guarantees. Only in this way can we truly respect good methods and intentions. If it deviates</p>
<p>from a reasonable manner, it will reduce the strength and create a negative impact. This is also closely related to loyalty to duty. The current situation is still extremely serious. November 16th will arrive in the blink of an eye. We should prepare our determination after the 16th and set our course of action. In this period, time is very precious. There are still fifteen days until the 16th. In this period, we must use it as if it were at least three years, otherwise, after the 16th, unfortunately, everyone will perish together, creating an irreparable regret. Thinking of the current needs because of the situation, I would like to offer the four words 'loyalty to duty' to all comrades of the party and compatriots of the country." After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held a memorial week for the Premier in the auditorium. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and officials from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, including Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Renjie, Zhang Ji, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bulei, Niu Yongjian, He Yingqin, Shao Yuanchong, He Yaotsu, Zhu Peide, Chen Yi, Li Shuhua, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Lühe, Wu Siyu, and others, as well as staff from the civil affairs, military affairs, and accounting departments, totaling over 600 people, attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the attendees in paying their respects, followed by a report from President Dai (the speech is being organized). The ceremony concluded at around 11:00 AM and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Coal Crisis on the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Insists on the Price Increase Plan</p>
<p>Coal Merchants Have Implemented a Strike</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the Jiaoji Railway announced a price increase for coal transportation starting from November 1st, the Zibo Zhangwei Coal Industry Association immediately opposed it. Subsequently, the Railway sent commissioners Peng Dongyuan, Chen Yanwen, and Chief of the Transportation Department Tan Shukui to Nanjing to report to the Ministry of Railways and request a solution. The coal industry also sent representatives Yang Yuan (of the Luda Company) and Li Zumo (a coal merchant) to Nanjing to oppose the price increase. In the midst of both sides insisting, the date of the price increase has already arrived without any resolution. I interviewed Ding Jingchen, a representative of the Coal Merchants Association, yesterday. He said that the Jiaoji Railway's coal transportation price increase was submitted by the Railway Bureau and did not originate from the Ministry of Railways. After the coal merchants telegraphed Nanjing requesting the withdrawal of the order, it was heard that the Ministry of Railways had ordered the Railway Bureau to submit its opinion. It seems that the Ministry is not insisting on the price increase, but the Jiaoji Railway feels it is difficult to reverse the situation, so it is still insisting on it. The two commissioners Peng and Chen and Chief Tan who went to Nanjing to report are still in Nanjing, and the two representatives Yang and Li are also staying in Nanjing to seize the opportunity. However, judging from the current situation, the withdrawal of the price increase order is hopeless. The original intention of the association was not to easily strike during this national crisis, so yesterday (the 30th), it convened a meeting of mine owners and coal merchants from Zichuan, Boshan, Zhangqiu, and Weixian. After careful discussion, it was decided to leave a period of hesitation, hoping that the Railway Bureau would withdraw the order. The main points of the resolution are: if the Railway Bureau still has not provided a satisfactory answer before the 31st of this month, then all members will implement a strike from the date of the price increase (November 1st). The case has already been signed and sealed by the responsible representatives of each mine owner and coal merchant. At the time of the conversation today, there was still no good news. Tomorrow, the strike may unfortunately occur. When the strike occurs, the losses of the mine owners and coal merchants are self-evident, and the users in the province will immediately face a coal shortage. Since the diplomatic crisis, Shanghai and Hankou have urgently needed Shandong coal. After the strike, the coal prices in Shanghai and Hankou will also be affected. Furthermore, more than ten thousand miners and transporters in the four counties of Zibo, Zhangwei, and the two cities of Qingdao and Jinan will immediately lose their jobs. As for the losses suffered by the Railway, they can also be roughly calculated. According to the Jiaoji Railway, the daily transportation of coal is 5,000 tons, with a revenue of about 20,000 yuan. It is estimated that the tonnage of coal transportation accounts for about 7/10 of the total freight tonnage of the railway, and the revenue from coal transportation accounts for slightly less than 1/2 of the total revenue from passenger and freight transportation. This unfortunate event is of great importance and is not just a loss for the mine owners and coal merchants alone.)</p>
<p>I just received a phone call from Boshan that starting this morning (the 1st), coal merchants in Zibo, Zhangwei, and other places have implemented a strike. Last night, the Zibo Zhangwei Coal Industry Association sent an official letter to Boshan Railway Station, stating that the Railway Bureau has increased the coal transportation fee by 20% starting from November 1st, which merchants are unable to afford. Therefore, it is unavoidable to suspend business and stop transportation from the 1st. Please inform all stations and sections as necessary. Boshan Station immediately telegraphed Zhangdian Transportation Section, and the Transportation Section immediately telegraphed the Railway Bureau for instructions. The Railway Bureau replied that although the coal merchants have suspended business, the freight cars allocated to the coal merchants before the evening of the 31st must be charged the transportation fee according to regulations even if they have not been loaded. Boshan Station immediately informed the merchants, but the merchants have expressed their rejection. The Coal Industry Association has sent representatives to Jinan to report to the provincial government the circumstances of the unavoidable strike. Since hearing the news of the strike, the merchants and residents of Jinan have been worried about the shortage of fuel. (November 1st)</p>

<p>Restoration of the Original Status of National Tax Authorities</p>
<p>The Result of Jiang Bocheng's Return to Jinan from Nanjing</p>
<p>The Former Staff Returned to Their Posts Before Noon on the 30th</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This time, the Shandong Provincial Government dispatched personnel to take over and borrow tax funds from various national tax authorities in Shandong, such as the Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, the Stamp and Tobacco Tax Bureau, the Saltpeter Bureau, the Consolidated Tax Administration, and the Luda Mining Tax Office, in order to provide military funds. This was because Han Fuju had nearly 100,000 soldiers in the Shandong army, and the military pay issued by the central government in recent months was insufficient, with only 100,000 yuan received in September. Currently, the various armies are engaged in bandit suppression and winter uniforms are being replaced. Although the provincial government had previously allocated 100,000 yuan for bandit suppression, the amount received by each army after distribution was minimal. Therefore, it was necessary to temporarily borrow national taxes to maintain the current situation. Last night (the 29th), Jiang Bocheng, the Chief Counselor of the Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, came to Jinan from Nanjing, and Xiang Jieren, the Director of the Shandong Stamp and Tobacco Tax Bureau, also came with him. Jiang stated that Commander-in-Chief Jiang had the determination to take active responsibility and would not resign. Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, would be responsible for raising and distributing military pay in various places. Afterwards, after Han and Jiang met, Han immediately decided to restore the original state of the various national tax authorities and ordered the withdrawal of the appointment of personnel to act as agents in the various national tax authorities this morning (the 30th). Before noon at 12:00, all newly appointed acting personnel from the Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, the Stamp and Tobacco Tax Bureau, the Saltpeter Bureau, the Consolidated Tax Administration, and the Luda Mining Tax Office were dismissed, and all former personnel returned to their posts. Thus, the tax collection authorities in Shandong Province were restored to their original state.</p>
<p>Since the 28th, a sudden run on the Jinan Branch of the Central Bank has occurred, and the Central Bank's notes have been widely refused in the market. By today (the 30th), it has largely subsided. It is reported that 40,000 yuan in silver was exchanged on the 28th, and 30,000 yuan was exchanged on both the 29th and 30th, totaling 100,000 yuan in the three days. (30th)</p>

<p>Released After Negotiations by the Fifth Police Precinct</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Xie Guoxuan, Zhou Bihao, Lin Langsheng, and Wu Zhangzhe, four men from Liancheng County, recently came to Fuzhou to take the entrance examination for the Autonomous Training Institute and were residing at the Yixing Paper Shop on Shanghang Street, Nantai. At around 4:00 PM on the 27th of this month, they went to Cangqianshan for sightseeing and accidentally entered the Japanese Consulate, where they were spotted and detained by Japanese police. Two of them escaped and urgently notified the military and police authorities by telephone, stating that Chinese had been detained at the Japanese Consulate and requesting immediate assistance. Upon receiving the information, the Martial Law Headquarters and the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate the matter but found no clues. It was not until after 6:00 PM that Shao Zhicheng from the Fifth Precinct personally visited the Japanese Consul</p>
<p>Tamura that the two men were released. It is said that after being arrested, the Japanese Consul interrogated them severely and searched their entire bodies. They were detained and not released, nor were they handed over to the local authorities for handling. It was not until personnel were sent to negotiate that they were released. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Japanese Consul in Shantou <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Interferes in the National Salvation Movement Under the Pretext of an Excuse</p>
<p>The Shantou Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Expands its Organization</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since Japan forcibly occupied our eastern provinces, the national sentiment of the people has been extremely excited, and the people of Shantou are particularly filled with righteous indignation. However, the patriotic movement has strictly adhered to order and is extremely civilized. In addition, Mayor Huang Zixin has extensive diplomatic experience. Therefore, although the Japanese Consul in Shantou has repeatedly tried to create trouble, he has been unable to succeed. Recently, the Japanese Consul Hogenki Chozuke again used the excuse that a messenger of his country was intercepted and inspected by the people's Anti-Japanese Association, and sent a letter to the Municipal Government protesting, including statements such as "Immediately notify the navy of our country to send troops to protect [them], and if there is a misunderstanding, the Mayor will be responsible." However, Mayor Huang was not intimidated and believed that the matter was entirely fabricated. Even if it were true, he would do his best to protect them and would not allow troops to land and disturb the peace. He immediately sent a serious reply to the point. The reply is recorded as follows: (Reply directly: Received your letter stating that your office's messenger was intercepted and inspected by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and requesting to quickly stop the association from infringing on the official duties of this office and endangering the personal freedom of the messenger and all employees of this office. Upon investigation, this matter may be due to a misunderstanding, and a letter has been sent to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the People's Training Committee to investigate and stop it separately. As for the statement in the letter that if strict enforcement and protection cannot be implemented, the navy will be notified to send troops to protect [them], this Mayor will bear the responsibility for protection and there is no need for the navy of your country to send troops for protection, nor is there such a procedure necessary. This Mayor has repeatedly stated clearly to your Consul that if misunderstandings occur due to sailors landing under the pretext of protection, your Consul will be responsible. Before replying to the letter, I should reply to the letter for your information.)</p>
<p>Since the Shantou community established the Mass Anti-Japanese National Salvation Conference last month and began working, they have been working extremely hard on sealing Japanese goods and training volunteer soldiers. However, the conference has heavy responsibilities. Currently, someone has proposed expanding the organization and increasing the number of committee members. A meeting was held on the 23rd and it was decided to convene a representatives' conference from all walks of life on the 28th. All schools, labor unions, trade associations, newspapers, and news agencies in the city that are registered with party and government agencies are eligible to send representatives. From the 25th to the 27th, each organization should prepare an official letter to receive a representative certificate at the Guangtian Theater so that they can attend temporarily with the certificate. The Lingdong Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army organized in this city has also been established and is scheduled to begin centralized training on the first day of next month.

<h3 id="e88">The Problem of Prohibiting Tobacco Seedlings in Fujian Province <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Anti-Smoking Association Decides to Implement its Stance</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee believes that the counties of Putian, Xianyou, Si'an, Nan'an, Jinjiang, Anxi, Haiyan, Zhangpu, Longxi, Nanjing, Pinghe, Yunxiao, Zhao'an, etc. in southern Fujian are preparing to plant tobacco seedlings. Military and police personnel in Fuzhou and Xiamen are allegedly colluding with organizations to protect the private transportation of opium smokers. The prohibition order has been swept away and the legal system cannot be stopped, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, the committee members jointly submitted their resignations to the provincial government in order to clarify their responsibilities. The provincial government issued an order to comfort and retain them, and at the same time, issued a proclamation reiterating the prohibition of smoking and distributing it to various counties for posting so that the public would be fully informed. The wording of the proclamation was quite severe, stating that the prohibition of opium cultivation has been repeatedly emphasized. Recently, it has been heard that the ignorant people in various counties are still planting [tobacco]. It must be known that the government has long had the determination to prohibit smoking. If anyone violates the prohibition order, they will be severely punished according to law. Cultivating tobacco was originally intended to make a profit, but the result is that both the principal and the interest are lost, and they also fall into the legal net, to be severely punished. There is no benefit in doing so, so why not reform early? If anyone dares to resist eradication by the crowd, they will be punished by dispatching troops along the way. At that time, regardless of the innocent or the guilty, it is bound to harm the neighbors. Regardless of military police officials, wealthy gentry, or bad gentry, if collusion is detected, they will be immediately severely punished. It is now heard that the Anti-Smoking Committee has scheduled a general meeting in the coming days to formulate measures to eradicate tobacco seedlings and prohibit the private transportation of opium smokers, which will be submitted to the provincial government for implementation. If it is still ineffective, the committee will dissolve itself to apologize to the people of the country. (October 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Hubei Emergency Relief Association <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Reorganized into a Post-Flood Relief Committee</p>
<p>American Wheat Will Be Shipped to Hubei in Six Installments for Distribution</p>
<p>The Issue of Rent Reduction and Exemption Has Been Completely Resolved</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Flood Emergency Relief Committee is now ending its emergency relief efforts as the floodwaters have gradually receded and the disaster victims have returned to their hometowns. All post-disaster matters must also be planned for early. Therefore, a meeting of all committee members was convened on October 30th to discuss the matter. It was decided to reorganize the committee into the Hubei Post-Flood Relief Committee. The internal organization was divided into nine sections, including general affairs, investigation, review, fundraising, relief affairs, public works, storage, accounting, and procurement. The five committee members Zhu Huaibing, Ma Dengying, He Hengfu, Chen Jingyu, and Cai Fuqing were appointed to draft the organizational outline and submit it to the next meeting for discussion before implementing the reorganization and establishment. The income of the Emergency Relief Committee from July 29th to October 30th was more than 654,000 yuan, including 170,000 yuan from the central government. The expenditure was more than 536,000 yuan, with an actual balance of more than 110,000 yuan, which will be announced according to the accounts. It is heard that after the reorganization of the committee, the emergency relief will be stopped. The problem of food shortages in various counties will be resolved by the Wuhan Office of the Disaster Area Working Group of the National Government Relief General Association with American wheat relief. The quantity of American wheat and the delivery deadline have been allocated and stipulated by the General Association. The office has received a telegram from Zhu Qinglan, urging it to prepare immediately. The telegram stated that the purchase of American wheat has already started and the first and second ships can arrive in Shanghai in the coming days. Regarding emergency relief, it should be allocated in advance for planning and distribution. Hubei Province has been assigned 15,000 tons, which will be delivered in six installments in October, November, December, January, February, and March. Please organize and implement it quickly according to the regulations of the inspection and distribution guidelines. Distribution tickets should be distributed according to the amount, so that there is no shortage of food or the situation of storing wheat without distribution. If there is a need to borrow relief grain from local grain merchants for emergency relief, the amount can be deducted when deciding on the amount of inspection and distribution. Emergency relief should start at the same time as the work relief, limited to households with no able-bodied men. Those who can work should be recruited into the work ranks and receive relief according to their work to maintain themselves and their families. As for the regulations on unloading wheat, the total amount of American wheat in the Wuhan area is 15,000 tons, which will be unloaded in Wuxue, Hankou, Xindi, Huangshigang, and Jianli. 300 tons each in October, 600 tons each in November, 750 tons each in December, 600 tons each in January, 600 tons each in February, and 150 tons each in March, totaling 3,000 tons for each place. As for the Wuhan side, food has gradually become available for assistance. All refugee shelters except the first one have been closed, and all porridge factories have also been stopped. After the American wheat arrives, work relief will be implemented to avoid the displacement of disaster victims. In addition, the rent issue has been resolved after several consultations among various parties. (1) Those whose houses were not flooded during the flood period will pay rent as usual (houses that were not flooded are no more than 20-30). (2) Those whose houses were flooded downstairs but can live upstairs will be exempted from half of the original rent from the date of the flood to the date of the flood receding, but those whose rent is less than 100 yuan per room will be exempted from 2/3, and those whose rent is more than 100 yuan should pay 1/2 of the rent. If the upstairs and downstairs tenants are separate, the upstairs tenant will bear it. (3) Houses along Jisheng Road will be exempted from rent from the date of the flood to the date of the flood receding. (4) Rent arrears before the flood and rent due after the flood will be paid in full. (5) All landlords and tenants who have resolved their rent issues before this method is determined are not included in this limit. The above decisions will be submitted to the provincial government by the municipal government for record and public notice. (October 30th)</p>

<p>Appeal for the Combined Construction of the North and South Huai River Dikes</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Among the counties hit hardest by this year's floods in Anhui Province, those along the Huai River were the most severely affected. In order to provide both disaster relief and fundamental solutions, the National Government Flood Relief Committee purchased a large amount of American wheat to carry out work relief and build the Huai River dikes. The committee requested the Huai River Guidance Committee to dispatch surveying teams to conduct on-site surveys and schedule the construction. The first and second teams of the surveying team have already gone to the middle and upper reaches to carry out segment-by-segment surveys. However, the Huai River Middle and Upper Reaches Flood Control Dike Plan formulated by the Huai River Guidance Committee stipulates that the dike route will only be built on the left bank (i.e., the north bank) from Honghekou in Huoqiu to Fushan in Wuhe. The Anhui North Flood Relief Committee has expressed dissatisfaction upon hearing this, believing that the Huai River dikes must be built simultaneously on both the north and south banks. If only the north dike is built, the south bank will inevitably become a ditch. The committee held a meeting of the Executive Committee last night (the 31st) to discuss this matter and decided to telegraph the National Government Flood Relief Committee to build both the north and south dikes of the Huai River, stating that "It has recently been heard that the Huai River Guidance Committee's surveyors have come to Bengbu one after another to carry out segment-by-segment surveys and build the north dike of the Huai River, and the south bank will not be constructed for the time being. The people on both sides of the Huai River are shocked and suspicious upon hearing this. It is secretly investigated that the Huai River dikes on both sides were destroyed at the same time during this year's floods. If the north dike is built, the south bank will inevitably become a ditch, which will inevitably lead to disputes. The [Flood Relief Committee] intends to treat both sides equally. We earnestly request that both sides be considered and built simultaneously, so that work relief can be universal and future troubles can be avoided.

<p>The Petitioning Process of the Disaster Relief Association</p>
<p>The Post-Improvement Association is the Disaster Relief Association</p>
<p>The Huaiyang Flood Relief Association was established the day before yesterday, and the general meeting decided to send Korea Chun to the province to meet Chairman Ye for a petition regarding engineering matters. Han returned to Yang yesterday, and the association convened all members at 2:00 PM in the Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce to hear Han's report on the provincial negotiations. Han then attended and reported that Guojun, entrusted with the mission of the assembly, crossed the river early yesterday morning to meet Chairman Ye for about three hours. All of Guojun's requests were adopted, and the provincial government is very willing to cooperate with officials and the people. In the future, if the local area has any proposals that are feasible, they will be adopted as much as possible. The breach repair project will be handled by the government. If the local area has any requests, they can be discussed at length, and construction will be carried out absolutely from a practical perspective. The funds of two million yuan have been raised and will be paid in three installments from now until February next year. The remaining three million yuan still needs to be raised separately. Guojun also said that engineering personnel are especially important. Mr. Wang Shuxiang is willing to take charge, and he needs to be asked to take responsibility for the project immediately. The names of the Water Conservancy Disaster Relief Committee and the provincial government seem too similar, and it is now planned to change the name to Water Conservancy Disaster Relief Association to show the difference. Chairman Ye also strongly agreed and plans to merge the disaster relief associations of the five counties in Zhenjiang with the disaster relief association here. The constitution is also planned to be slightly modified. What do you all think? All the representatives believed that the constitution did need to be revised. After careful discussion, each article was voted on and passed. The disaster relief associations of the five counties in Zhenjiang also unanimously welcomed joining this association. Each county will appoint one person to the standing committee. The names of the elected standing committee members are recorded as follows: Jiangdu Hu Xianbo, Yizheng Bao Xiangzhong, Gaoyou Ma Shijie, Baoying Bao Zhizhi, Xinghua Chen Kanghe, Taixian Han Guojun, Dongtai Ren Yaofu, Huai'an Tian Lubo, Huaiyin Xu Shuhou, Yancheng Qi Yizhi, Funing Gao Ziyun, and Han Guojun was mutually elected as the chairman of the standing committee.</p>

<p>Each Person Must First Pay a Tax of Forty Baht</p>
<p>To Be Implemented Starting November 16</p>
<p>After the Siamese government promulgated new immigration regulations, the most affected areas are Chaozhou, Shantou, and Haikou. More than 10,000 people travel from these two ports to Siam every month. Last week, Taikoo Yanghang received news from Singapore that the British Straits Settlements government will ban Chinese laborers from entering the country starting from New Year's Day next year. Ships at the four ports of Shantou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Haikou are only allowed to carry first-class cabin passengers and cargo. Third-class tickets are not allowed to be sold. Today, Fulin Yanghang also received a telegram from Bangkok, Siam, that the Siamese government will increase the tax on Chinese immigrants starting from November 16. Each person must pay a head tax of forty baht when they land. In this situation, the South Seas Islands are no longer accessible to our compatriots. (October 24)</p>

Wang Zhijin, the section chief of the county government, is also involved. It has now been decided to send a letter to the court requesting the immediate detention of Zou and others for severe punishment, and to telegraph Hefei to detain the Japanese goods and investigate the treacherous merchants in Hefei. The people of Wuhu are extremely angry at the treacherous people and mainly formed a special court for public trial by the people.</p>
<p>The National Student Federation convened representatives from various provinces and cities to hold a national student anti-Japanese national salvation joint conference. The schools in Anhui Province have nominated Hu Qi, Chen Songping, Song Sixiang, Li Daode, Zhou Changhuai, and other five people as representatives. They departed yesterday to attend the meeting. After the meeting, Hu and others first came to Wuhu to report on the process and make various publicity efforts.</p>
<p>The Wuhu National Goods Company is raising funds for disaster relief and national salvation.

Preparations are actively underway.</p>
<p>The county disaster relief branch will add urgent relief from November 1st to the 3rd, with each person receiving three yuan, two yuan, one and a half yuan, and biscuits of three grades. In addition, the National Government Disaster Relief Committee has allocated 100,000 shi of flour to Anhui, which has recently arrived in Bengbu. Disaster Relief Commissioner Zhang Gongheng has ordered each county to prepare to receive it.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government intends to levy an additional road construction tax. All counties in the province and overseas compatriots believe that after the recent floods, the people of Anhui are seeking relief and cannot afford to bear additional burdens. They have collectively protested and sent letters and telegrams to the provincial government. In order to comply with public opinion, the provincial government has now decided to postpone the levy and has issued orders to each county to comply. (30th)</p>

<p>Disputes After the Separation of Chongming and Qidong Counties. Qidong County, on the north bank of the Yangtze River estuary, was originally the outer sand territory under the jurisdiction of Chongming County. It is separated by a river surface of forty li. Previously, due to the inconvenience of administrative facilities, the provincial government decided in the 17th year of the Republic of China to change the outer sand into the Qidong County seat and submitted it to the National Government for record. Recently, the gentry of Chongming requested a re-merger due to the countless difficulties since the separation. The provincial government handed it over to the three departments of civil affairs, finance, and construction for joint review. After the provincial government's decision on the 30th of last month was finalized, it was not convenient to change it. The difficulties between the two counties will be resolved by the three departments of civil affairs, finance, and construction, convening the two county magistrates to properly resolve them. It is heard that the province has scheduled to convene a meeting of the two county magistrates in Shanghai in the middle of this month. The heads of various bureaus, representatives of various agencies, and representatives from all walks of life will also attend the discussion.</p>

<p>Feiyun Ferry Kidnapped and Ransom Released Fourteen People. The Tongyuan Bureau's Feiyun ferry, which runs between Dongshan and Suzhou, departed from Shan at 8:30 AM one day and was hijacked by more than 20 lake bandits at the Tingzigang area outside the Hengjing ferry crossing at around 9:00 AM. Before leaving, they kidnapped 17 male and female passengers, as reported yesterday. Yesterday (2nd), it was learned that after detailed investigation, there were a total of 23 passengers kidnapped on the ferry. That night, the bandits interrogated the identities of the hostages one by one and released 14 poor people. Xu Huaihong, a male teacher at Fuyu Elementary School, was also among them. When releasing these 14 people, the bandits ordered them to notify the family of Chu, a wealthy household in Dongshan who was kidnapped but not released, to pay a ransom of 500,000, and the family of Xu to pay 300,000. Those remaining in the bandit den include Ms. Chuan Zhongde, the principal of the county-run Zhongxiu Girls' School, teacher Ms. Qian, and Chu, Xu, and other nine people.

<p>The Court Orders Strict Arrest of Escaped Prisoners. The county prison public office of this county reported that three prisoners, Zhang Youxiang, Chen Tongfa, and Yang Jinhe, escaped at around 6:00 PM on the 14th of last month to the High Court for review. It is now learned yesterday (2nd) that Chen, the county magistrate of this county, received instructions from the High Court stating that although the guards had no faults such as bribery and connivance, they did provide the prisoners with an opportunity to escape, which was extremely negligent. In addition to the court separately discussing and submitting the relevant officials to the department for approval, the working hours should be properly arranged in the future, and they should be sealed and guarded on time. The guards should be strictly supervised and pay attention to protection to avoid negligence, and the fugitives should be arrested and investigated within seven days. The duty guard Bu Gao and the attempted fugitive Liu Shixing should be transferred to the court prosecutor's office for thorough investigation, and the handling situation should be reported to the court for review separately.</p>

<p>The Provincial Department Rejected the Clearance of Debt Coupons. The provincial government instructed that, according to the financial department's review of Jiangyin County's request to issue local debt coupons for clearing debts, it is far from the principles of finance. All counties have been rejected uniformly. It should be ordered to continue to follow the previous instructions to find other appropriate methods and not insist on the previous proposal. After the county government received the order, it convened a meeting on the 30th to discuss and decided that since the debt coupons were not approved for issuance and the local accumulated debts could not be left unaddressed, it should submit a proposal to the provincial department to allow the collection of two cents of the original debt coupon fund's surtax to be used exclusively for repaying old debts. Regarding the Zhou Shuiping case, it was decided that a Zhou case fund custody committee should be organized to handle the funds paid by the defendants, including Sha Bingyuan and others. The committee should be composed of one person from the county party headquarters, the county government, the education bureau, and the fund property office, and three impartial local people, with the fund property office serving as the chairman.</p>
<p>Inspect Enemy Goods and Pay Attention to Local Order. The provincial government, based on a telegram from the silk and cloth guild, and the civil affairs department, based on a telegram from the paper and southern goods guild, stated that the county party headquarters and the anti-Japanese association's student union, when inspecting Japanese goods, indiscriminately detained them regardless of national hatred, ignoring those who presented certificates to defend themselves, and their actions were excessive, causing panic and business was about to be suspended. They requested that the county be ordered to strictly stop them. After receiving the telegram, the provincial department sent a letter to the provincial party headquarters and ordered the county magistrate to properly handle and mediate the situation at any time and pay attention to local order.</p>
<p>The Headquarters Cracked Down on Robbers on the Xicheng Road. On November 2nd, Qian Shusheng, an employee of the cocoon industry association, collected 594 yuan in cocoon tax in Wuxi and took a long-distance bus to Qingyang. He changed to a rickshaw and was robbed while passing over the Fengjing Bridge. He immediately reported it to the county government for investigation. The Su-Chang Pacification Command received a tip from an informant that the main bandit, Huang Sibao, was hiding in the Yao Ancestral Hall in Sihe.

<p>The Departments of Finance and Construction Urged the Payment of Construction Funds. As of recently, the Wuyi construction fund had a total deposit of more than 168,000 yuan. The province ordered that half of it, 84,000 yuan, be used to purchase public bonds for water management. Various local agencies and gentry believed that the construction fund could not be withdrawn according to the regulations promulgated by the province, and the local demand for various funds was very large. They telegraphed the provincial departments to exempt them from withdrawing the funds. On the 1st of this month, County Magistrate Zhang received a joint order from the two provincial departments of finance and construction stating that the county should calculate the number of bonds to be purchased according to half of the construction funds remaining at the end of the 19th year, temporarily deducting the 75,000 yuan deposited in the passbook, and report the withdrawal of funds for submission within the specified date.</p>

The Rugao Committee for Receiving Flood Victims Along the Canal previously sent Hong, a member of the Red Swastika Society, to Dongtai and Xinghua to investigate the flood situation. According to the report from Rugao, the flood in Dongtai has slightly receded and is still passable by land. The city base of Xinghua is still sitting in the water, and only a few land routes can be passed in the city. The suburbs are still a vast expanse of water one zhang away from the city. From Haian to Dongtai, passing through Fuan, Andong, Liangduo, and other places, the water is still higher than the fields. The low-lying fields along the way in Jiangyan and Qintong are all submerged in water, with some five or six feet high and others one or two feet high. The foundations of the residents' houses have not yet left the water. The disaster situation is very serious. In the blink of an eye, the weather is severely cold, and many flood victims are still homeless, which is worrying.</p>

<p>The Public Security Bureau Chief is Under the Custody of the County. Zhu Ying, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Huaiyin, previously sent his supervisor, Yuan Xuepu, to serve at the joint military and police inspection office in this county. Yuan learned that Guo Ruisheng, the company commander of the second battalion of the garrison, had purchased a box gun and 100 bullets from Guo for 130 yuan. This matter was known to Commander Liang, who ordered Regiment Commander Zeng Jirui to arrest Yuan, saying that according to the report of Company Commander Guo, he was suspected of inducing the purchase of military equipment and should be dealt with according to law. Yuan confessed that the gun was purchased by Director Zhu Ying, the money was paid by Zhu himself in the amount of thirty yuan, and he ordered someone to take one hundred yuan from the accounting office in the bureau. Commander Zeng then sent someone to seize the gun in the Public Security Bureau. Commander Liang sent a telegram to Zhang, the supervising officer of Yangzhou, and Chairman Ye of the provincial government to report the incident and sent a letter to Huaiyin County to put Zhu under custody. On the 20th of this month, Dai Boqiu, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, bailed Zhu out. On the 27th, Liang received a telegram from the supervising officer's office advocating strict punishment. Liang ordered Zhu to appear for questioning, but Zhu did not appear. He then sent another letter to County Magistrate He to put Zhu under custody to prevent him from escaping. The duties of the bureau chief are temporarily performed by Chief Supervisor Zhang Quan. Continued Report on the Closure of the Three Industries. The three industries of cloth, general merchandise, and groceries in Huaiyin all stopped business because yesterday was the deadline for sealing Japanese goods. Today, County Magistrate He invited Ye Zijun and Gu Xunru, the standing committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, to discuss solutions, but there were no results. Liu Dingxin, the chairman of the committee and the standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese Association, went to Yangzhou due to other matters, resulting in a stalemate. Today (29th), 78 shops in the city and suburbs, including 14 cloth shops, 44 general merchandise shops, and 20 grocery stores, are still closed and not doing business. In order to maintain public order, County Magistrate He invited the letter writers to talk again today, hoping to open the towels as soon as possible, but no one went. It is also heard that the large and small money shops inside and outside the city are unable to receive loans due to the closure of the three industries, and they are afraid that there will be a continued strike tomorrow. However, the members of the Anti-Japanese Association did not express much about this, only saying that they would wait for the industries to open before proceeding with the sealing procedures. As for the value of the Japanese goods occupied by the three industries, according to the registration of each industry, the silk and cloth are worth about 89,000 yuan, the general merchandise is worth about 6,800 yuan, and the groceries are worth about 6,467 yuan. In fact, it is more than this number, otherwise they would not have sacrificed the closure of business to fight for it.</p>

<p>Recently, I read a local communication from Suzhou in your newspaper on the 1st, "Investigation by the Provincial Committee into the License Tax Dispute," which is inconsistent with the facts. The collection of tobacco and alcohol license taxes has always been contracted by merchants, resulting in many long-standing malpractices. Since this year, the Ministry of Finance has promulgated new regulations and changed it to a delegated responsibility. It is our duty to abide by the new regulations and carry out rectification to increase national revenue and eliminate long-standing malpractices. Unexpectedly, this has caused a backlash from merchants who have united through the guild to try to maintain the old contracting system. They have filed a complaint with the provincial bureau, which has been investigated by the Provincial Committee in Suzhou and found no dereliction of duty. Correspondingly, we are writing to your newspaper to make a correction to promote fairness. Sincerely, the Wu Kun Jiang Chang Tai Jia Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau, November 2, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Women and Military Training by Wang Xiaoying <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Since the violent Japanese troops have invaded the Eastern Province and ravaged our borders, trampling our famous cities and killing people for goods, the whole country is filled with anger, especially the young students who are driven by their patriotic zeal to dedicate themselves to the country, either volunteering to fight the enemy or organizing volunteer armies. Here, there is a question of whether schoolgirls should receive military training or not. Some say that women are naturally weaker and military affairs are not suitable for them. However, there have been women in both the East and the West who have joined the military and made contributions on the battlefield. Princess Pingyang, Hua Mulan, and Liang Hongyu of our country will always be praised by later generations. Joan of Arc of France bravely killed the enemy and turned the tide of the war. Catherine of Russia defeated Turkey and Poland, seizing vast territories. Austria's Maria Theresa used a large army to confront Frederick the Great. Elizabeth of England defeated the Spanish Armada at sea. Isabella of Spain drove out the Jews and Moors, completing national unification. But this is just in terms of individuals. It is said that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom raised an army of hundreds of thousands, and there were 500,000 women. During the Xinhai Revolution, there was a women's Northern Expedition team. The women of ancient Sparta spent their lives in military camps. During the French Revolution, French women fought alongside men, competing to kill and not hesitating. During the European War, women from all countries went to the national crisis together and became glorious bloodshedders. Seeing this, women are not unable to participate in military affairs, but it depends on whether we have this determination. I have seen women participating in track and field competitions in sports meets everywhere, and there are countless famous female aviators in the world. Women can engage in strenuous exercise and flying, and it is easy to undergo military training.</p>
<p>Our country is facing a national crisis. The army, claiming to be two million strong, is brave in private matters but timid in public battles. The Japanese pirates are as venomous as snakes and scorpions and as cruel as owls. The national army has not resisted them, sitting idly by as the beautiful land is slaughtered. Women also have a natural duty to the nation and defend their homes. With the country in such danger, the only way is to prepare quickly, receive military training, unite with the people of the whole country to resist foreign aggression, endure hardship, and sweep away shame. The indigenous people of Taiwan were forced by the harsh policies of the Japanese to launch an anti-Japanese movement. The Japanese mobilized a large army to annihilate the indigenous people. The women of the indigenous people competed to commit suicide in order to send their fathers and brothers out the door. The Indian national movement has lasted for twenty years. Sarojini Naidu and other female heroes have run around shouting and awakening the Indian people. I mean that the women of our country should not take the passive way of the Taiwanese indigenous women to repay the country with one death, nor should they take the futile shouting of Sarojini Naidu and other female heroes. We believe that Japan and our country are incompatible and cannot coexist. Everyone must prepare to fight a bloody battle with the Japanese pirates. Women compatriots cannot be an exception.</p>
<p>There are more than 600 students in our school's Wuben Middle School department. Except for those who are too young, they are organized into a rescue team. The rest of the students are willing to receive military training. From an educational standpoint, I believe that military training for schoolgirls has unparalleled value in both peacetime and wartime. In peacetime, students all know to love the country and not forget to study, and study not forgetting to love the country. Today's students are indeed studying. If they are studying and not forgetting to love the country, it is not relying on slogans, but on a strong body to fight the enemy. How can students have a strong body? Training is indispensable. The best way to train is to receive military training. I believe that military training for women has at least the following values in peacetime: First, learn diligence; second, strengthen the body; third, elucidate reason; fourth, maintain order; fifth, respect obedience. Please analyze it again.</p>
<p>First, learn diligence. Except for the naturally diligent women in the agricultural and industrial classes, women in the metropolis indulge in idleness, luxury, and do not know the word diligence. Schoolgirls who receive military training get up early to wash, and they are diligent day and night, developing a habit that will not be disturbed by the outside world. Second, strengthen the body. Schoolgirls mostly pay attention to knowledge and seldom take care of their bodies. As a result, those who increase in knowledge and weaken in body. Girls who receive military training, activities, and exercises can strengthen their bodies.</p>
<p>Third, elucidate reason widely. In modern warfare, there are more and more sophisticated weapons. Artillery and smoke barriers are related to chemistry, and airplanes and submarines are related to physics. Lining up and shooting are related to mathematics. Receiving military training can also lead to academic research and benefit reason more clearly.</p>
<p>Fourth, maintain order. Soldiers practice, line up neatly, and their steps are aligned. They advance like wind and rain, retreat like mountains, stop like cutting feet, and walk like flowing water. The movement and stopping should be regular, and the advance and retreat should be moderate. Receiving military training can also cultivate strict discipline and a habit of maintaining order.</p>
<p>Fifth, respect obedience. In order to save the country from national crisis, it is valuable to unite the people of the whole country. The key to unity is to respect obedience. Only public freedom and public welfare, without private freedom and private welfare, and everyone is willing to obey the public opinion can avoid disturbances. Military training values obedience most. Women with this good habit are never a blessing for the future of the country.</p>
<p>The above is about the military training for girls in peacetime. If we talk about wartime, women who have received military training have more real power to serve the country. Everyone says that in wartime, women can engage in rescue work, guard in the rear, and be police in the inland. I think that even for the so-called rescue, guarding, and police work, it is not easy to try. They must have received military training and be proficient in national affairs to be competent. We women are not willing to talk emptily about saving the country, but we are willing to be practical. The national situation is extremely dangerous. If we do not prepare earnestly, we will perish ourselves. Everyone must not forget the war, and not care about death in war, in order to turn danger into safety and turn defeat into victory. My female compatriots, why don't you rise up together and receive military training to serve the country with your body? The future of the nation may be achievable.</p>

<p>Proposed Relief Measures for Provincial Education Funds (2)</p>
<p>It is imperative to request the Central Government to consider the extraordinary severity of the Jiangsu flood and to approve a reduction in revenue collection, while providing a monthly subsidy of 150,000 yuan to Jiangsu's education funds within the fiscal year of 1931 to maintain operations. In previous years, the Central Government had agreements for monthly subsidies to provinces with revenue deficits, such as Hubei and Anhui. Recently, due to the severe disaster in Hubei, the Central Government has reportedly increased the monthly subsidy to Hubei Province by 200,000 yuan, thereby sustaining its education funds. The extent and severity of the flood in Jiangsu this year are no less than those in Hubei. Just as the Central Government considered Hubei's situation previously, it should also consider Jiangsu's. Therefore, it is requested that the Central Government subsidize Jiangsu's education funds with 150,000 yuan monthly throughout the fiscal year of 1931 to ensure its sustenance. Since both Jiangsu and Hubei are disaster-stricken provinces facing similar difficulties, it is believed that the Central Government will treat them equally and provide assistance accordingly.</p>
<p>It is imperative to comply with the National Government's publicly announced "Trial Budget Regulations for the 1930 Fiscal Year of the Republic of China" and the "Standards for Dividing National and Local Revenues and Expenditures." The entire funding of the National Central University, amounting to 1,320,000 yuan, should be transferred to the Ministry of Finance for payment and no longer be managed by the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office. In August of the 18th year (1929), the 34th Political Affairs Conference resolved that the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office would permanently allocate 1,320,000 yuan annually to the National Central University. The reason for the term "permanently" at that time was that Jiangsu Province's special education funds included land tax levies and slaughter tax, which were national revenues. Therefore, it was acceptable for the Central University's funding to be permanently allocated by the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office annually. However, since the "Trial Budget Regulations for the 1930 Fiscal Year" were promulgated and implemented by the government, all land taxes and slaughter taxes have been designated as local revenues. Furthermore, the expenditure standards explicitly stipulate that the funding for national schools should be paid by the national government, not by local governments. Thus, the basis for the term "permanently" no longer exists in terms of revenue realities. More importantly, in terms of explicit legal provisions, since national and local revenues and expenditures have been divided, and major taxes like salt tax, cigarette tax, transit tax, and special tax have been designated as national revenues with the hope of increases, while fixed taxes like land tax, slaughter tax, and business tax have been designated as local revenues, the entire funding of 1,320,000 yuan for the Central University should be paid by the Ministry of Finance and no longer by the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office. This is not only just and reasonable but also a proper approach that is mutually beneficial rather than mutually destructive. Previously, the authorities of the Central University hoped that a portion of the university's funding would be permanently allocated by the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office because Jiangsu Province had special education funds that were considered more reliable. However, experience in recent years has shown that Jiangsu Province's special education funds not only suffer from annual revenue shortfalls of several hundred thousand yuan during normal times, but also the shortfalls increase significantly during famine years, with the total shortfall exceeding three million yuan in recent years. Previously, before the promulgation and implementation of the "Trial Budget Regulations for the 1930 Fiscal Year," the shortfall in funding revenue could be compensated by dreaming of additional education funds from the salt tax surcharge. Now, such dreams are absolutely prohibited, meaning there is no way to increase revenue. The authorities of the Central University and those who care about the Central University may still believe that although Jiangsu Province's special education funds suffer from annual shortfalls and lack avenues for increasing revenue, they still generate some revenue each year. Confucius said, "I am not concerned about scarcity but about inequality." Although the funds are not much, if they are distributed equally, they are still reliable. Furthermore, the Central University can receive at least 600,000 yuan annually from the Ministry of Finance in addition to the 1,320,000 yuan allocated by the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office. This dual approach seems very advantageous. However, the policy of equalizing scarcity and poverty will inevitably lead to mutual destruction. Moreover, at a time when Jiangsu Province's special education funds are facing extreme difficulties, while seeking funds from the Ministry of Finance, they still insist on obtaining funds from the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office, making it even more difficult for provincial educational institutions that rely solely on the Management Office's funds without any support from the Ministry. How can they bear to do this? Therefore, for the sake of the Central University authorities and those who care about the Central University, it is imperative to follow the examples of several universities in Beiping and designate more reliable fixed funds for the Central University's funding, or follow the precedents of National Wuhan University and other universities and request approval to allocate the Central University's funding from the national taxes within Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, such as the salt tax. This approach would comply with the "Trial Budget Regulations for the 1930 Fiscal Year" and the "Standards for Dividing National and Local Revenues and Expenditures" promulgated by the National Government, alleviate the financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province's education funds, and prevent the Central University and Jiangsu's provincial educational institutions from suffering economic oppression or even perishing together. This is a superior strategy that is mutually beneficial rather than mutually destructive.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned remedial measures are based on facts and laws, which can somewhat alleviate the current financial difficulties of Jiangsu's education funds. It is respectfully requested that they be reviewed and implemented for the benefit of the public. (End)</p>

<p>Petition from Representatives of the Provincial Elementary School Teachers' Association</p>
<p>The Education Department Accepts Suggestions, and the Provincial Party Headquarters Strongly Supports</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Elementary School Teachers' Association convened a meeting at the Zhenzhong Elementary School in Zhenjiang on the 24th of the month to vigorously advocate for the cessation of Central University's education funds. It was decided to appoint representatives from Zhenzhong Elementary School and Yangzhong Elementary School to petition the Education Department and the Provincial Party Headquarters. Representatives Yu Gancheng and Chen Liangwu carried the petition to the Education Department, where they were received by Jiang Zhuoqun and Deng Fu on behalf of the department. The representatives presented the petition and explained their intentions. Jiang and Deng accepted the representatives' suggestions and agreed to forward them to the department head. The representatives then went to the Provincial Party Headquarters to petition, where they were received by Ma Yinbing, a Standing Committee member of the Provincial Party Headquarters. After accepting the representatives' suggestions, Ma stated that the Provincial Party Headquarters had already resolved to strive for the cessation of Central University's education funds during the provincial representative conference in August of this year and had jointly submitted a petition to the Central Government with the Provincial Government. However, they have not yet received a response. They will continue to discuss with the executive committees to implement measures to achieve the goal of having the province run provincial schools.</p>

However, the amount was limited, so they could only disburse the remaining half of the August funds first. The remaining arrears will be disbursed when the granary is opened.</p>

He emphasized that everyone should engrave the oath in their hearts, never forget it, resolutely implement it, and thoroughly sever economic ties with Japan. Next, attendees raised their right hands and recited the oath in unison: "I will never buy Japanese goods; my family will never buy Japanese goods; I will persuade my relatives and friends not to buy Japanese goods." The sound reverberated through the sky. Supervisor Zhu Ziqiao then delivered a speech, urging everyone to fulfill their oaths, persevere, and achieve tangible results after the ceremony.

<p>Most Students Scheduled to Return to Classes Today</p>
<p>The student unrest at the Sino-French School, established by the French in Shanghai, was triggered by the school's attempts to prevent students from organizing anti-Japanese associations and engaging in anti-Japanese activities. All students suspended classes. Recently, students who left the school have been actively seeking assistance from various agencies, including Chu Minyi, Du Yuesheng, the Central Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Education Bureau. The school has also shown some flexibility. After another mediation yesterday, a reconciliation was reached. The school authorities have agreed to allow most of the students who were forced to leave the school to return to classes starting today, with the exception of a small number. However, they must still comply with the school's eight newly established conditions. As for the remaining students who cannot return to school, the Sino-French School Anti-Japanese Association has arranged for them to be placed in other schools.</p>

<p>Representatives Take a Break Yesterday</p>
<p>Six Representatives from Guangdong Jointly Issue a Statement</p>
<p>The Beijing-Guangdong Peace and Unification Conference took a break yesterday and today, so there has been no progress in the discussions on party affairs. However, after the Beijing representatives Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Mingshu went to Beijing, they have been consulting on the three provisional measures for the Fourth Plenary Session that were determined the day before yesterday. It is expected that one of these three measures will be selected and implemented. It is also heard that implementing the first measure is more likely. Currently, Beijing representative Chen Mingshu and others have been approved to leave Beijing by overnight train tonight and are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Immediately after arriving in Shanghai, they will hold the sixth preparatory meeting to decide on this issue. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e126">The issue of the Fourth Plenary Congress: <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of party affairs, the Beijing and Guangdong representatives held an informal discussion focusing on the Fourth National Congress as the core when they held a talk the day before yesterday. Other issues regarding party affairs have not yet been discussed. According to a person speaking on behalf of the Beijing representatives, one of the three provisional measures for convening the meeting will be selected and implemented. It is expected that the first measure is the closest to both sides, and the difficulties are fewer (i.e., convening the meeting on schedule, etc.). However, it cannot be considered completely certain at present. It will have to wait until the Beijing and Guangdong representatives hold the sixth preparatory meeting tomorrow morning to decide.</p>
<h3 id="e127">A meeting was held at the Hu residence yesterday morning: <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren, Wu Chaochu, and others went to the Hu residence to hold a discussion. Zou Haibin also participated despite his illness. The six Guangdong representatives discussed the future of the peace conference for a long time, dispersing at 12:00 PM. The contents of the discussion were not disclosed because they were an exchange of views among the Guangdong delegation members. However, the contents discussed were still related to the issue of party reform.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Guangdong Representatives' Interview: <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, reporters interviewed the Guangdong representatives Wang, Sun, Wu, Zou, Li, and Chen. The gentlemen jointly issued the following statement: (Question) If Mr. Chiang Kai-shek fulfills his previous statement and resolutely steps down, has the Guangdong side considered his future position? (Answer) Before departing from Guangzhou, the colleagues repeatedly discussed Mr. Chiang's appointment to the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year, and his achievements are recognized by the people of the country (omitted). Therefore, if Mr. Chiang can fulfill his previous statement this time and resign from the position of Chairman of the National Government, the colleagues in Guangdong intend to propose that Mr. Chiang serve as Chairman of the National Defense Committee. Firstly, national defense is important in the face of national crisis, and secondly, his talents will not be wasted. If the central political system reform plan can be passed and implemented this time, the Chairman of the National Government will not bear actual administrative responsibility and should be held by someone who is old, virtuous, and can serve as a national model. Mr. Chiang has always taken it upon himself to work hard for the national revolution, so it is more appropriate for him to serve as Chairman of the National Defense Committee than as Chairman of the National Government.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Wang Jingwei will move: <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei currently resides in Sir Robert Ho Tung's residence on Gordon Road. The visits from various circles every day are limited, which Wang finds inconvenient. Therefore, he has rented a new residence at No. 774 Xinpushi Road, which is currently being renovated. He will move in as soon as the work is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Zhao Pilian's interview: <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Pilian and Jia Jingde, important figures in Shanxi Province, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to represent Shanxi in the peace conference and have already met with Guangdong representative Wang Jingwei and others. The reporter from Huadong News Agency interviewed him at his residence yesterday. According to Zhao, this trip south is not a so-called mission. He only hopes that in the face of foreign aggression, the country will unite as one to seek the realization of great unity in order to secure domestic stability and resist foreign aggression. The rumors that Mr. Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang will go south are not true. The purpose of my trip is to actively hope for sincere cooperation between Nanjing and Guangdong. In addition, I intend to represent Yan Xishan and attend the peace conference when it is officially held.</p>

<p>Zheng Zenan's Bribery to Release Goods</p>
<p>Zheng is the Chairman of the Sugar Industry Association</p>
<p>Releasing White Sugar after Receiving a Bribe of 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Also Bribed the Anti-Japanese Association with 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association held its 15th executive meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Executive Committee members Wang Xiaolai, Lin Lianhou, Wang Yansong, Lu Jingshi, Chen Tingrui, Fang Jiaobo, and others attended. In addition to discussing various important cases, the Tax Bureau reported the bribery case of Zheng Zenan, Chairman of the Refined Sugar Association. The Executive Committee believed that the case was serious and must be thoroughly investigated. It was decided that the informant, Zhu Anqing, should be released immediately, and the official, Ju Jiqiu, who refused the bribe should be rewarded. The following is a record of the reports:</p>
<h3 id="e135">Secretariat Submits Report to the Standing Committee Concerning the Bribery Case Involving the Sugar Industry Association <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of seeking review and approval for the report on the Sugar Industry Association's bribery scheme: On October 27th, Zhu Anqing secretly reported that Zheng Zenan, Chairman of the Sugar Industry Association, had extorted 3,000 yuan from sugar firms such as Yuan Damao He. We immediately dispatched Ju Jiqiu to secretly investigate. Now, according to the investigation report, Yuan Da firm did indeed pay 1,500 yuan as a national salvation fund on October 20th (Jiufeng Zhuang check). Mao He firm recorded 1,500 yuan as a temporary item under their name. Both firms' ledgers and a donation receipt from the Sugar Industry Elementary School were brought back. We immediately endorsed on the original report: (Ledgers etc. are temporarily stored, and any other information should be promptly investigated and reported.) While verifying, Ju Jiqiu reported that on October 31st at 1 PM, Zhu Anfu (owner of Shengji Sugar Firm and former executive committee member of the Sugar Industry Association) invited him to the Jue Lu Hotel, Room 76, for a secret meeting. He said that Chairman Zheng Zenan urgently wanted to settle the matter and offered 1,000 yuan to perfunctorily resolve it, including the original bribe of 1,000 yuan and a notice from the Jue Lu Hotel, which were submitted. This morning, around 11 AM, the original informant, Zhu Anqing (reportedly Zhu Anfu's younger brother), came to confess that Anqing had secretly reported the Sugar Industry Association's extortion from Yuan Yu and Mao He sugar firms. Now, because the committee members of the Sugar Industry Association feared a leak, they privately entrusted his elder brother, Zhu Anfu, to persuade you with 1,000 yuan to settle the matter. Today, he was asked to come to your office to retrieve the ledgers, assuring that the matter would absolutely not be publicized (a written confession is attached as evidence). Considering his contradictory behavior, he was detained. All the circumstances of the Sugar Industry Association's extortion and bribery are hereby reported to your committee for review and severe punishment to deter wickedness. Ju Jiqiu's resourcefulness in handling the matter should be rewarded. Respectfully submitted to the Standing Committee, with two reports from Ju Jiqiu, 1,000 yuan in bribes (banknotes), Zhu Anqing's interview notice, a letter of proof from Yuan Yu Firm, two ledgers, one receipt, Zhu Anqing's confession record, and one Jue Lu Hotel notice.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Ju Jiqiu's First Report <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the report:</p>
<p>I was ordered to investigate the case of Yuan Yu, Mao He, and other sugar firms on Xian Gua Street and Yong An Street being extorted 3,000 yuan by Zheng Zenan, Chairman of the Sugar Industry Association. I went to Yuan Yu Firm on Xian Gua Street to inquire about everything and carefully reviewed the ledgers. I saw that on October 20th, 1,500 yuan had been paid to the National Salvation Fund, check number Jiufeng Zhuang. I immediately ordered them to produce the receipt for the National Salvation Fund. The firm took out a receipt issued by Zheng Zenan, which stated "Donation to the Sugar Industry Private Elementary School." The fact that the National Salvation Fund was transformed into a donation was suspicious. I took one ledger and one receipt, issuing a receipt, and went to Mao He Firm on Shui An Street. I also first requested the ledgers for review and saw that 1,500 yuan had been paid under the name "Temporary Record." This unusual item seemed suspicious, and the amount matched the 3,000 yuan mentioned in the secret report. Considering the seriousness of this matter, I did not dare to make a decision on my own and brought the ledger back for verification. After further investigation, I learned that the two firms intended to transport a large batch of Japanese goods to other ports. The matter was discovered at the docks, and it was reported to Chairman Zheng Zenan. Zheng said that if 3,000 yuan could be used as a national salvation fund, the goods could be released. The two firms immediately agreed to this. Whether this is true or not requires further investigation. The circumstances of the investigation are hereby reported for your review.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Ju Jiqiu's Second Report <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the continuation of the report:</p>
<p>Since I was ordered to investigate the case of Sugar Industry Chairman Zheng Zenan's bribery of 3,000 yuan, someone persuaded me to accept a bribe of 1,000 yuan to avoid reporting the matter. Because the inside story was not clear, I pretended to agree. On October 31st, someone brought a note asking me to go to the Jue Lu Hotel for negotiations. I consulted Secretary Yan, who allowed me to go. At 2 PM, I went to Room 76 on the second floor of Jue Lu Hotel and met the contact person, Zhu Anfu. I learned that Mr. Zhu is the owner of Shengji Sugar Firm, located on Yanghang Street, and a former executive committee member of the Sugar Industry Association. During the meeting, Zhu Anfu said that Chairman Zheng (Zenan) urgently wanted to settle the matter and offered 1,000 yuan as compensation, asking me to perfunctorily investigate and maintain both parties' reputation. He immediately handed over 1,000 yuan in cash and repeatedly pleaded. I immediately stated that I didn't know if Mr. Zheng knew about or agreed to this money. Zhu Anfu said that he was ordered by Mr. Zheng to handle the matter and that Mr. Zheng also wished to resolve the matter. I made an excuse to go to the office to retrieve the ledgers. Zhu Anfu was very happy. I returned to the office and temporarily stored the 1,000 yuan with the accounting section of the Secretariat. The circumstances of the negotiations are hereby reported for your review.</p>
<p>Confession of the original informant, Zhu Anqing:</p>
<p>Anqing secretly reported that the Sugar Industry Association extorted bribes from Yuan Yu and Mao He sugar firms. Now, because the committee members of the Sugar Industry Association feared a leak, they privately entrusted his elder brother, Zhu Anfu, to persuade you with 1,000 yuan to settle the matter. Today, he was asked to come to your office to retrieve the ledgers, assuring that the matter would absolutely not be publicized. Zhu Anqing, November 1st.</p>

<p>When the Shenyang Incident occurred, Dr. Eddy happened to be in the area conducting a large-scale evangelistic campaign. Dr. Eddy witnessed the various conspiracies and atrocities of the Japanese army's unwarranted occupation of Shenyang. He telegraphed the League of Nations in Geneva, the U.S. Secretary of State, and the British Foreign Minister, detailing the Japanese army's violent occupation of various parts of the Eastern Provinces, violating principles of justice and humanity, and their plan to permanently occupy Manchuria. He requested advocacy for justice and the maintenance of world peace. After that, Dr. Eddy traveled to Harbin, Tianjin, Beiping, Taiyuan, Jinan, and other places to lecture on the Japanese army's armed occupation of Shenyang on the evening of September 18th and the lawless actions in various parts of the Eastern Provinces in the following days. At the same time, he also gave systematic lectures on international politics, economics, society, and religion, which were well received by people in various places. However, in Beiping, he was strongly opposed by the Beiping communists. Dr. Eddy, at the invitation of the National Association of YMCAs, has set out for Shanghai and will arrive on the 4th of this month. It is reported that Dr. Eddy will stay in Shanghai for a day or two and then travel south to give public lectures to people in this city, which will be scheduled for early December. Dr. Eddy has written books such as "The Truth About Soviet Russia," "Sex and Youth," "Religion and Social Justice," "Eight Great Men," and "Faith in the New Era," all of which have been translated and published by the YMCA Publishing House.</p>

<p>Japanese Force Merchants to Fix Silver</p>
<p>The Japanese firms in the Xingsheng Street area of the French Concession, such as Dachengxiang, have the largest operations. In light of the rampant violence of the Japanese, they would rather sacrifice economic ties with Japan and switch to operating domestic goods. They telegraphed their resident merchant Zhu Wende in Japan to wind up operations and return home. It turned out that there were already fixed but undelivered goods worth about 100,000 taels of silver. The Japanese refused to refund the deposit and would not allow him to return home until the silver was cleared. After Zhu telegraphed urging the money, the firms, having traded with Japan for decades, could not bear such extortion and reluctantly remitted the silver in full. Therefore, Zhu Wende returned home yesterday.</p>

<p>Advises to Avoid Japanese Ships</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the China Chemical Industry Society, stating: "We acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st of this month, stating that you have ordered butter from Australia and that the goods have been shipped to Yokohama. If these goods are transshipped onto Japanese ships, misunderstandings may arise. We hereby state the following processing situation for your reference: (1) The Anti-Japanese Association's fifth executive committee meeting has already resolved the matter of refusing to load foreign goods onto Japanese ships. Your company should send a telegram stating that you should avoid Japanese ships when transshipping. In short, your company should make every effort to do so within the realm of possibility. This chamber will still forward the situation described in your letter to the Anti-Japanese Association. (2) When ordering goods from Europe and the United States in the future, you must first declare that they must not be loaded onto Japanese ships, otherwise the goods will be returned and all losses will be compensated. This should be agreed upon in advance to avoid temporary disputes."</p>

<p>The victims of the Shenyang Ordnance Factory, who escaped danger and arrived in Shanghai, organized a petition and maintenance group to request the municipal government to find a way to maintain their current livelihoods and resettle their work. Although the municipal government has telegraphed the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ordnance Department to set up Jiang An to resettle them, there has been no response. The first two batches have been issued relief funds of four yuan each by the National Government Relief Committee, but the meager relief funds are of no use and have long been exhausted. After exhausting all avenues, the congress resolved that the first batch should appoint Yu Lin Gui and Li Chanxi as representatives to take the 11:45 PM Beijing-Shanghai night train to Beijing yesterday to petition, demanding that the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ordnance Department find a way to resettle them. The third batch has also appointed Lin Mei and Liu Shaomei to take the night express train to Beijing today to continue the petition.</p>

Unexpectedly, at noon yesterday, several bailiffs from the Shanghai Local Court, together with the police in charge, went to seal the premises on the grounds that the former Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union owed rent. The union staff declared to them that this was the Organizing Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, a legal institution directly under the Central Party Headquarters, and had no connection with the former Industrial Union. However, the bailiffs ignored the facts and claimed that they were acting under the orders of the Local Court to seal the premises.

<p>Striking Workers Completely Unemployed</p>
<p>Mediation Ineffective, Seeking Other Livelihoods</p>
<p>All workers in the Western cuisine industry in this city have been on strike for several months due to treatment conditions. After repeated mediation by Party and government agencies, the capitalists unreasonably refused, resulting in no solution. All striking workers have therefore lost their jobs and have no means of appeal. The union's entire board of directors and supervisors has tried their best to maintain the situation, but to no avail. They have ordered all workers to seek other livelihoods. The union's entire board of directors and supervisors, Yao Zhongqing, Wu Jingchuan, Wu Shenxiang, Gu Youqing, etc., submitted a document to the Municipal Party Department and the Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting permission to dissolve the union: "We hereby submit the seal, certificate, and expense report, and the membership application to request your review and approval for dissolution. Our members have been oppressed by the capitalists and treated poorly. Therefore, we submitted a request to the capitalists to improve our treatment conditions. Not only did they not sincerely accept and sign the agreement, but they even dared to open and dismiss union members and use various means to destroy the workers' movement, causing all union members to be indignant and go on strike automatically. The capitalists' cunning behaviors and crimes have been exposed in full view. Alas, it is unfortunate for hundreds of union members that the Western Cuisine Industry Union has come to this. Your bureaus have long been aware of the difficult situation and the tricky handling of our union. The directors and supervisors have exhausted their efforts and are unable to sustain the situation. We can only announce to all union members that they should understand and seek other livelihoods. We hereby submit the seal, certificate, and expense report and the membership application for your review and approval to announce the dissolution for public convenience."</p>

<p>Petition for Alimony</p>
<p>Daughter-in-law Represents Father-in-law in Court</p>
<p>Judge Disapproves</p>
<p>Cai Ahu, a native of Chuansha, operates a prosperous dairy business at 45 Singapore Road. He has a son named Qiuquan, 33 years old, who is married to a Sun. Cai Qiuquan hired lawyer Dong Banggan to file a petition with the local court mediation office, requesting alimony. Due to Cai Ahu's absence, mediation was impossible. Cai Qiuquan then formally requested the court to order his father to pay alimony of 15,000 yuan, while also reserving his right to inheritance.</p>
<p>His petition stated: "I am the biological son of the defendant (Cai Ahu). However, my mother passed away long ago, and my stepmother, Madam Yang, is inherently malicious and skilled at sowing discord, leading the defendant to listen to slander and treat me with animosity. Not only does he disregard my livelihood, but on August 27th of this year, at 8:00 AM, the defendant gathered a group of people who forcibly tied me up and threw lime into my eyes. I struggled and shouted for help, fortunately, neighbors heard and arrived to prevent permanent injury. I sustained multiple injuries and was reported by the neighbors to the Gordon Road police station, who forwarded me to the First Special District Court for examination. The court determined the injuries and, upon the plaintiff's request for financial compensation instead of punishment, advised the defendant to allocate property for me to make a living. However, the defendant has not complied. Since the location falls under your jurisdiction, I specially petition for mediation, as the defendant is wealthy, owning a dairy farm on Singapore Road with 180 head of cattle, along with buildings and equipment, valued at approximately 100,000 yuan. He also owns over 400 mu of farmland in Shatien, Chuansha, valued at approximately 20,000 yuan, and has savings of over 10,000 yuan in HSBC and another 10,000 yuan in the Bank of Communications, as well as outstanding loans of over 70,000 yuan, totaling over 200,000 yuan in assets. Considering the bond between father and son, I have refrained from pursuing the assault. According to Article 1114 of the current Civil Code, lineal relatives have a mutual obligation to provide support, and according to Interpretation No. 2025 (Shang) of the fourth year of the Republic, the court may, upon the request of the parties, order the allocation of property. I am over 30 years old and have assisted in the defendant's dairy farm since childhood, without receiving adequate education and unable to perform strenuous work. Moreover, since the lime incident, my eyesight has not fully recovered despite numerous treatments. I am now homeless and facing starvation. The defendant, possessing immense wealth, heartlessly disregards my plight."</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Han Jingdou opened the trial. The defendant, Cai Ahu, did not appear, but was represented by his daughter-in-law, Cai Sun. The plaintiff recounted the previous events. Cai Sun stated that she was 32 years old. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer interjected, stating that it was strange for Cai Sun, the plaintiff's wife, to represent her father-in-law. The judge also expressed disapproval and instructed Cai Sun that Cai Ahu must appear in person at the next hearing. She respectfully agreed and left.</p>

<p>Brothers Actually Kill Each Other</p>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang and Yuxiang Killed</p>
<p>Done by Younger Brother Qingxiang</p>
<p>Originally Scheduled to Divide the Inheritance Yesterday</p>
<p>Leading to This Tragic Event the Night Before</p>
<p>Zhang Linsheng, the deceased compradore of the Swatow Wharf of the Taikoo Company, resided at 112 Huayuan Stone Bridge in Pudong. His sons, Guoxiang and Yuxiang, were assassinated by gunmen in front of the gate of Lane 35, No. 6, at approximately 7:00 PM the night before. Yuxiang was pronounced dead upon arrival at Renji Hospital. Guoxiang was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<p>The chief of the Third District Public Security Bureau, recognizing the threat to local security, immediately dispatched all officers to various ferries and checkpoints to inspect pedestrians and search for the murderers. By 9:00 PM, no suspects had been found. Rumors among nearby residents suggested that the case involved brothers killing each other over inheritance disputes. The district chief, believing that clues could be found, secretly dispatched police to Zhang's residence to investigate. They found Zhang Qingxiang (Guoxiang's second younger brother) and his mother, Madam Zhang (Linsheng's third wife), whispering inside the house. Qingxiang had loosened his long robe, appearing ready for sleep, showing no signs of grief. The police brought both Qingxiang and Madam Zhang to the district office for questioning.</p>
<p>Madam Zhang stated that she was 45 years old and that her husband, Linsheng, had passed away five years ago. His first wife, Madam Qian, died of illness in February of this year. Guoxiang, adopted, was 30 years old. She and Linsheng had three sons: Yuxiang, 23, who was adopted by Madam Qian; Qingxiang, 20; and Yunxiang, 18, who lived with her. The family property had been divided by her husband during his lifetime, but no written agreement had been made. The division was scheduled for the second (yesterday), but Guoxiang and Yuxiang were assassinated that evening for unknown reasons. She requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Qingxiang stated that he had been ill for several days and had just recovered. He went to play mahjong with friends east of Yangjing Temple at 8:00 AM and returned at 5:00 PM. He went out to buy shoes at around 7:00 PM and heard that his two elder brothers had been shot.</p>
<p>The district chief asked why, knowing that his brothers had been harmed, he had not immediately reported to the district office to pursue the murderers and send the injured to the hospital. His lack of grief and apparent readiness for sleep raised suspicions. He was advised to confess the truth to mitigate his crime. However, Qingxiang insisted that he was ill and unable to walk.</p>
<p>During the interrogation, a phone call from the Xinzha police station reported that Zhang Guoxiang had identified his younger brother, Qingxiang, as the murderer at Baolong Hospital. The district chief, convinced that the case was clear, ordered Zhang and Madam Zhang to be detained and sent to court for investigation.</p>
<p>Guoxiang's injury was caused by a bullet entering through the corner of his mouth and lodging in his throat. The injury was not fatal. He was able to speak yesterday. District Chief Zhang dispatched detectives Zhang Yong and Yang Jinsheng to Baolong Hospital for questioning. Guoxiang stated that he and his brother Yuxiang had returned home from a birthday dinner at Shunxing Restaurant in Lannidu at 7:00 PM. While changing clothes, as they passed the bamboo fence at No. 6 Lane 35, Yangjiazhai Road, someone jumped out from the darkness, shined a flashlight on his face, and fired a shot, hitting him in the corner of his mouth. Looking back, he recognized his third younger brother, Qingxiang. He fled in pain towards the street, hearing another shot, which hit the bamboo fence, followed by three or four more shots. He feared for his second brother Yuxiang's life. He also stated that his maternal uncle (Zhang's brother), Zhang Quansheng, who lived south of Sanguantang in Tangqiao, harbored deep resentment towards him and was likely involved in the case.</p>
<p>Detectives Zhang returned to the district office and notified the Tangqiao Third District Third Precinct by telephone, ordering the police to arrest Zhang Quansheng at his residence. Zhang Quansheng stated that he was 42 years old and currently the owner of the Yangtze River tugboat Dredging Company, a U.S. business, and had not been in contact with his sister for four years. He claimed to know nothing about the case. Under repeated interrogation, he admitted to possessing a large handgun, which he had exchanged for a four-inch handgun with Yang Fulin, a member of the Tangqiao District Security Corps. He claimed his wife had the gun.</p>
<p>The district chief, noting that two small handgun bullets, one live and one spent, matching the four-inch handgun, were found at the scene, became more suspicious and ordered him to be temporarily detained, pending a written report and the transfer of Zhang Qingxiang and Madam Zhang to court for further investigation today.</p>
<p>Yuxiang's body was taken away by family members at 10:00 PM that night. Yesterday morning, local security guard Xie Along reported the death to the local court. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Shen and others arrived in Pudong to examine the body. The examination confirmed that the deceased had been shot once in the right temple and once in the cheekbone, both fatal wounds. The prosecutor ordered the body to be prepared for burial by the widow, Madam Bao, pending further investigation by the police district.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Letter Threatening to Extort a Comprador <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly a Letter Basket Appears on the Bamboo Fence</p>
<p>Intimidation, Extortion, Fake Urination</p>
<p>Arrest Due to Various Suspicions</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th of last month, Wang Xinzhai, a native of Anhui and comprador of the Fuma Fur Export Company at 116 Jiangxi Road, residing at No. 5 Yong'an Lane, Bairbu Road, in the French Concession, received a threatening letter from the post office demanding 2,000 yuan. The letter instructed him to place the money in a paper basket on the bamboo fence opposite Ma'an Lane on Chongqing Road in the Public Concession between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM on the 31st, and someone would retrieve it. Wang reported the matter to the Lujiawan police station.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 31st, detectives Jin Jiu, Lin Zheng, Qian Yumin, Mao Jingen, and Zhang Ziying of the special task force, along with plainclothes officers and representatives of the victim, arrived at the designated location on time. They found an old paper basket hanging on the bamboo fence with a narrow red strip of paper attached. The detectives placed a package of newspapers resembling banknotes into the basket and scattered to wait. At around 7:00 PM, a local man named Xu Azhao arrived, peeking back and forth several times. The detectives arrested him. His answers were evasive, and he was taken to the police station.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at 2:30 PM, the police station transferred Xu to the Second Criminal Court, where Judge Luo Renji conducted the trial. First, police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, charging him under Article 370 of the Criminal Law. Detective Mao Jingen reported the arrest, stating that after the victim reported the letter, they went to the bamboo fence at 4:00 PM in the afternoon but found no paper basket. They returned at 6:00 PM and found a paper basket with a red paper marker. At 7:10 PM, the defendant arrived, pacing back and forth five or six times and pretending to urinate in the lane (without lowering his trousers). The arrest was made because his story about waiting for a woman to pick up clothes was completely inconsistent with the investigation. He claimed to be a carpenter at the tram company, but it was found that he was a carpenter at Feng Fa Ji carpentry shop.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, Wang Xinzhai, was out of town, so his representative, Rong Lisheng, appeared in court and recounted the circumstances of receiving the letter and reporting it to the police. Xu Azhao, 36 years old, residing next to a friend's place at 1162 Maho Road, Edward Avenue, claimed to be a plasterer. He stated that he had arranged to meet a woman there to pick up clothes and was looking for her address, denying any involvement in the extortion. Judge Luo, after reviewing the testimony, ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending further investigation and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Spending Six Nights with a Man</p>
<p>Afraid to Face Grandmother in Court</p>
<p>Hiring a Lawyer to Confess the Truth</p>
<p>Grandmother Says She Relies on Granddaughter to Live</p>
<p>Gong Qiaobao Confesses Adultery</p>
<p>Yan Wang, an old woman from Yangzhou residing at 367 Dong Youheng Road, reported that her sixteen-year-old granddaughter, Yan Meimei, a worker in a cigarette factory, disappeared suddenly at 5:00 AM on the 26th of last month. After searching without success, a relative and fellow townsman, Li Xiaoxizi, informed her that Yan Meimei was staying with a man named Gong Qiaobao (also from their hometown). Gong was willing to offer five yuan as betrothal money and choose an auspicious day for marriage. The grandmother refused, demanding the return of her granddaughter and reporting the matter to the Harbin police station. Detective Hou Fulin and a Western detective located Gong and Yan Meimei at Room 26 of the Zhongnan Hotel at 1914 Edward Avenue. They were found sleeping together. When awakened, they were arrested. Yan Meimei stated that she had been abused by her grandmother Wang and was willing to stay with Gong, refusing to return home. The police chief ordered Gong to be detained and Yan to be released, instructing her to appear in court the next day for questioning.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the police station transferred Gong Qiaobao to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that the defendant had admitted to spending six nights with Yan: the first night at the Yingbin Hotel on Fuzhou Road, the second and third nights at the home of the defendant's maternal uncle on Zhaofeng Road, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth nights at the Zhongnan Hotel. Yan Meimei did not appear. A lawyer appeared on her behalf, stating that Yan was afraid of being coerced by her grandmother Wang if she appeared in court today and would appear at the next hearing.</p>
<p>Yan Wang stated that she was 62 years old and had lost her son and daughter-in-law. Meimei was her granddaughter, working in a cigarette factory, and she relied on her for support. She did not trust the defendant and had heard that he was a dissolute son who had previously committed a crime. After her granddaughter disappeared, she found that her clothes had been taken, and she briefly described the situation, stating that she did not know where her granddaughter was. Zheng Wenkai was hired as the lawyer for the defendant.</p>
<p>Li Xiaoxizi stated that he had seen the defendant and the girl together at the Zhongnan Hotel. He had heard others say that Yan Wang wanted the defendant to pay 400 yuan to go abroad before allowing him to marry her, otherwise it was impossible. He had not relayed the defendant's offer of 50 yuan as betrothal money to Yan Wang.</p>
<p>The defendant stated that he and Yan had been classmates for five or six years and had become acquainted. She had been abused and driven out by the plaintiff Yan Wang, so she willingly followed him and spent six nights with him. He denied any previous adulterous relationship with her and pleaded for leniency. Judge Xiao Xiechen, after reviewing the testimony, ordered him to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing until Yan appeared in court for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Record of Interrogation of the Kidnappers in the Zhu Yanqing Case <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Yanqing, the owner of the Zhenhe Tea Shop in Dean Lane, North Shanxi Road, Public Concession, was abducted on the evening of September 8 while returning to his residence in Fangbanqiao, Huajie, in his private car. The abduction took place in front of Bulin Lane at the intersection of Zhengjiamuqiao Street and Minguo Road in the French Concession. He was hidden in a garret at 73 Jianye Lane, Fuli Road, with the intention of extorting a ransom. Detectives Jin Jiulin and Bao Tan of the Special Task Force of the French Concession Police investigated the case. On the 15th of the month, Zhu was rescued, and ten men and women, including Zheng A'er, Yu A'qing, Tang A'fu, Cao Zhang, Qian Taoyuan, Hong A'gen, Lu Yisheng, Wang Ziqing, Wang Zhang, Zhao, Liu, and Liu Ziqing, all from Tongzhou, were arrested and sent to the Second Special District Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Yesterday was another day for the trial. The police brought the defendants to court. At 2:30 PM, Judge Luo Renji presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The judge first ordered the victim, Zhu Yanqing, to appear in court and questioned him about the abduction and the conditions in the kidnappers' den. The judge then ordered the arguments to begin.</p>
<p>Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stood up and argued that the first defendant was the initiator of the case, instigated by the seventh defendant. The first defendant found the seventh defendant on September 3 and planned the kidnapping at 13 Jianye Lane, directing the other bandits on the scene, making him one of the main culprits. Although the second defendant was not present at the time of the kidnapping, he participated in the meeting and guarded the driver during the hijacking, making him also guilty of kidnapping. The third defendant participated in the kidnapping on the scene and also acted as a guard for the hostage, making him at least guilty of Article 373 of the Criminal Law. The fifth defendant was also an important figure in the case, having been notified first and asking Hong A'gen for help. Although he did not go to the kidnappers' den after the abduction, he was still culpable. Although the sixth defendant did not participate in the kidnapping on the scene, he acted as a lookout in the kidnappers' den and wrote a letter to the victim, contacting him at North Sichuan Road. The seventh defendant was the victim's former driver, who knew that Zhu was wealthy and instigated the kidnapping, making him the most important figure in the case. The eighth defendant went to rent a car after the meeting on September 3, acted as a lookout during the kidnapping, and contacted him about the ransom. The ninth and tenth defendants had relatively minor involvement. The eleventh defendant was present at the meeting and overturned Zhu's car during the kidnapping, making him an important figure in the case. He requested that the court punish him according to the law.</p>
<p>Lawyer Huang Xiubo was hired by Cao Zhang and Hong A'gen to defend them. Other lawyers including Wang Shizong, Xu Yannian, Lin Yingqing, Gu Changyuan, and Wu Youyuan, were appointed by the court to provide free legal representation for the defendants. They argued that the defendants were trapped by poverty and ignorance, and had fallen into the net of the law due to their ignorance, and asked the court to show leniency. Judge Luo announced the end of the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 9th of this month. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Huacheng Tobacco Company in this city was founded by Chen Chuxiang and Dai Gengxin, of Zhenhai, gathered together with Shanghainese tobacco exchange operators, and has been in operation for nearly ten years. The company's "Beautiful Golden Mouse" and other cigarette brands, made entirely from Chinese merchant capital, have long been sold throughout the country and are welcomed by people from all walks of life. Recently, some unscrupulous people have falsely claimed that the trademarks of the two cigarette brands have been sold to others, or that the company has other shares. Those who know better have laughed at this. It is reported that the company has now applied to the Anti-Japanese Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the National Products Federation for a formal statement certifying that they are entirely domestic products.</p>

<p>Great Renovation of Jin Zuan</p>
<p>Jin Zuan Newspaper, the most famous three-day publication in Shanghai, has been established for more than eight years and has been published for more than 900 issues. Its fair opinions and rapid news have always been praised by readers. The newspaper has been greatly renovated starting from issue 901, not only increasing the content but also implementing the use of domestic newspaper printing. This is the first sound of national newspapers using domestic paper in the country. It is reported that the price of the paper is more expensive. The newspaper Ning endures painful sacrifices and sets the full-year subscription at two yuan, vowing not to increase it to show its promotion of domestic products. I hope that patriotic compatriots will pay attention to it. From issue 901, Na Yunsheng's masterpiece "Yellow Ripe Plums" will be published, with a strong style and especially valuable.</p>

<h3 id="e187">The Origin of Photographically Reproducing the Song Dynasty Block-Printed Tripitaka <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Since Buddhism was introduced to the East in the Han Dynasty, the two monks, Kasyapa Matanga and Dharmaratna, first translated the Sutra of Forty-two Sections and the Sutra on the Ten Stages of Disconnecting Ties. After that, the Wei, Jin, Six Dynasties, and even the Sui and Tang dynasties were engaged in translating the Tripitaka, with brilliant and complete texts. The preservation and circulation of scriptures only relied on stone carvings and handwriting. For example, the Shamen Jingwan in the Sui Dynasty created and carved the stone Tripitaka, which was sealed in Baitai Mountain in Fangshan County, Hebei Province. Stone carvings are still preserved here. For example, the Tang Dynasty's handwritten scriptures were recently discovered in the Dunhuang stone chamber. This is how handwriting was circulated. The art of woodblock printing began in the Five Dynasties and flourished in the Song Dynasty. In the fourth year of the Kaibao reign, Emperor Taizu ordered Zhang Congxin to carve the Tripitaka in Yizhou. It took thirteen years to complete it in the eighth year of the Taiping Xingguo reign of Emperor Taizong. It was called the Shu-printed edition, which was the beginning of carving the Tripitaka and was known as the Northern Song edition. Unfortunately, it has long been lost. Only fragments have been circulated in the world. Obtaining a single piece is worth a lot of money and is extremely valuable. In the second year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty, Wang Yong and his family from Huzhou vowed to carve the Tripitaka in Yuanjue Temple in Sixi, which was known as the Sixi edition. During the Jiaxi reign of Emperor Lizong, Yansheng Temple in Qisha also began to carve the Tripitaka, which was completed in the third year of the Zhida reign of Emperor Wuzong of the Yuan Dynasty. It was known as the Qisha edition. Both of these editions have seventeen characters per line and six lines per page. Only the lone copy in Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, remains.</p>
<p>Kang Youwei saw it in the past and wanted to reproduce and circulate it, but failed to do so. In the year of Gengwu, Qing Lan and others arrived in Xi'an to provide disaster relief. He was touched by the fact that Guanzhong was once a Buddhist center, but now the great law is declining and disasters are increasing. He thought of the opportunity to revive it. When he arrived at Wolong Temple and Kaiyuan Temple, he saw the complete Southern Song edition standing there. Checking the carving year, it was from the first year of the Duanping reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty to the eleventh year of the Dade reign of Emperor Chengzong of the Yuan Dynasty. Although the volumes were vast and could not be checked one by one, it can be determined that it was the Qisha edition. The Buddha taught that the Three Treasures should be respected together, and the Dharma Treasure is especially important. Without the Dharma Treasure, the Buddha Treasure cannot be promoted, and the Sangha Treasure has nothing to rely on. Therefore, there is a proposal to photographically reproduce the Song Dynasty block-printed Tripitaka. The people of Shaanxi mostly agree, and even those in Shanghai invite the monks and lay people to plan the methods. They all agree that checking the block pieces for missing pieces is the first problem to be solved. It is also heard that the Songpo Library in Beiping also has fragments of the Song Tripitaka, so they first went to Beiping to borrow and read them. Knowing the number of volumes stored there, they also obtained a self-recording of the Song Tripitaka and went to Xi'an to check according to the list. They knew that the two places contained a total of 5,629 volumes in addition to the same ones. Only 173 volumes were missing. They searched other temples to see if they could find them. Otherwise, they would supplement them with the Ming Tripitaka to make a perfect collection. There are also precedents for this method. In the autumn of Xinwei, he gathered with his colleagues in Shanghai many times to discuss the fundraising and printing, and they had a clear plan. So the committee was organized to be responsible for the progress. The printing will be carried out by the Buddhist Scripture Bookstore, which is expected to be completed in three years. The grand event of reproducing the Qing Dynasty Dragon Tripitaka is now stored in Beiping. The price of each set is 5,000 yuan for paper, transportation, and other expenses. Those who are unable to do so are unable to do it. Now, the price of each set of the photographed Song Collection is only one-tenth of that of the Dragon Collection. It is easy to do, and each temple across the country will have a copy in the future, which is definitely not difficult. It makes one reason. Collectors of Song Dynasty books cherish them like jade. Recently, reproductions have been circulating, but only Buddhist scriptures are still missing. Now there are thousands of volumes in the world. It is not only for Buddhist followers to study, but also for those who are interested in ancient times. Its second convenience. Believers at home and abroad have heard the news and supported it</p>

<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news item published in your newspaper's Local News section yesterday, titled "(Solemn Declaration by Over Sixty Trade Unions in This City)," the Publishers' Union was inadvertently omitted from the list of participating unions. We hereby send this letter to clarify and respectfully request that you publish it in the "Letter to the Editor" column. Your consideration is greatly appreciated. Respectfully, Editorial Department, Shen Bao Newspaper. Record of Citywide Trade Union Meeting, Zhao Shusheng, November 2nd.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Having read the news item in your November 1st newspaper's Local News section concerning the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association preventing Japanese individuals from purchasing land, it was suddenly claimed that I, in recent times, had Japanese individuals purchase over a hundred acres of land in the Yangjing area of Pudong. This is absolutely untrue. I am writing this letter specifically to request a correction. This matter concerns my reputation. Please publish this letter in the "Letter to the Editor" column to grant a correction. Respectfully, Zhang Jianqing. November 22nd.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhong Xiehua's Message (A Respectful Announcement to All Volunteer Soldiers in the City):</p>
<p>(Today, what day is it? It is the sorrowful anniversary of one and a half months since the violent Japanese forcibly occupied Liaoning and Jilin! At this time when our land has not been recovered and our national humiliation has not been avenged, all volunteer soldiers in this city are holding a solemn oath-taking ceremony. The importance of the mission they bear is self-evident. Consider that the violent Japanese have recently continued to increase their troops in the Northeast, engaging in beastly acts without end, such as forcibly occupying railways, establishing artillery emplacements, building barracks, and digging trenches, constantly expanding their military operations to fulfill their delusional continental policy. Alas! While the enemy is deeply immersed in their beautiful dreams, may we suddenly awaken with a start, follow the League of Nations resolution, and implement the withdrawal of troops before the 16th, returning our rivers and mountains. Even a three-foot-tall child would know this is impossible. Therefore, the final battle against Japan is an unavoidable reality. All my beloved comrades in the army are vanguards of the people. Upon taking the solemn oath to defend our country's thousands of cities, they will set out to serve on the frontier, surely kill the enemy and achieve results, and recovering our rivers and mountains is within our grasp. However, Xiehua, based on his observations, cannot help but speak. During this solemn and awe-inspiring oath-taking ceremony, I also wish to discuss the following points with all my comrades in the army: (1) Obey Orders: An army that obeys orders is akin to a second life. An army that disobeys commands and disregards orders will never win on the battlefield. History, both domestic and foreign, proves this point. However, the virtue of obedience depends on the cultivation of regular habits. Therefore, the entire army must absolutely obey the orders of their superiors. (2) Intensify Training: All my comrades in the army have made the greatest determination to participate in training, sacrificing everything without hesitation. However, before training is fully mastered and actions are unified, we must not rashly engage the enemy and make unnecessary sacrifices that would deplete our national strength. Only by enhancing the entire army's combat capabilities can we achieve final victory. To achieve this goal, there is no other way than to strictly intensify training. Hereafter, I sincerely hope that my comrades in the army will not be late or absent unless absolutely necessary. (3) Mutual Respect and Love: All my comrades in the army are patriotic youths who deeply understand the great cause and voluntarily join the ranks, vowing to destroy the Japanese invaders. Their ambition is comparable to the sun and moon, and their spirit will be immortalized alongside the mountains and rivers. Therefore, all comrades in the army should show each other admiration and affection. Once ordered to kill the enemy, all soldiers should share weal and woe, and rely on each other for survival, surpassing even the bonds of brotherhood. In peacetime, how can we not strengthen unity through love, sincerity, and mutual encouragement? (4) Enduring Exercise: The "five-minute enthusiasm" is a stain on our entire nation. To remove this stain, everyone must painfully urge themselves to correct past mistakes in order to see results. Economic severance should be like this. War preparations should especially be like this permanently. Even if Japan partially withdraws its troops, and before our country implements conscription, the volunteer army should continue to expand its organization to contribute to the implementation of government conscription. The implementation of conscription has a significant impact on the country, especially in about five aspects. Please try to describe them: (1) Youths who receive military national education will surely be rich in the concept of loving the country and loving the nation. All bad habits can be swept away. (2) Everyone serving three to several years of military service will have firm will and strong physique. Even without seeking to strengthen the race, the race will naturally be strong. The infamous name of "sick man of the East" should be permanently separated from our great Republic of China. (3) Active duty soldiers must have received secondary education. Those who are illiterate will be given remedial education. Illiteracy can be gradually eliminated in the future, and education can be popularized. (4) The people of the whole country have clarified the purpose of the country raising soldiers, and are determined not to participate in civil wars. The self-destruction of internal fighting will never reappear in China after conscription. (5) Once war is declared against a foreign country, the whole country will be soldiers. With our nation's large population and the virtues of endurance and hard work, coupled with new-style weapons and strict training, we can directly be invincible and dominate the world. Is the small three islands worth one strike from our great Chinese nation? From these several points, we can see the arduous future responsibilities of the volunteer army and know where to strive. (5) Practicing Hard Work and Endurance: All my comrades in the army have dedicated themselves to the country and will not hesitate to break into pieces. What is there to fear of hardship? It is especially shameful for the very few people who are called "young masters." I secretly hope that this ominous nickname will never exist. Let us encourage each other with the words "practicing hard work and endurance." Xiehua is uneducated. The above points are based on what I have seen and I am not afraid to be vulgar and say everything in front of all my officers and brothers. If you adopt it, I should follow and encourage you to strive to implement it. (October 30th)</p>

<p>The Voice of Anti-Japanese Resistance</p>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Resisting Japanese goods is the responsibility of all people in the country. Everyone must have the determination to cooperate and resist forever.</p>
<p>The Chinese people are like a sheet of loose sand; no wonder they are looked down upon by the Japanese. But if everyone can unite from now on, they may be able to resist the violent Japanese.</p>
<p>What is justice? We Chinese believe it is something to rely on, but in reality, it is the self-comfort of a weak nation. In the eyes of the violent Japanese, it is like abandoned waste.</p>
<p>Instead of asking for international help because of the violent Japanese, we should encourage ourselves to do arduous work.</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Remaining Steles in Qingyang, Wuzhong <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Qingyang is located outside the Panmen gate of Suzhou. During the late Qing Dynasty, it became a commercial port due to the Shimonoseki Treaty with Japan. At that time, Qingyang was the most prosperous area in the entire county, with shops lined up closely and brothels seemingly as numerous as clouds. In the past, people said, "Beyond the Changmen gate and past Panmalu, a weeping willow hangs over a painted building." The scenic beauty of the beaded curtains and ten miles of smoke and flowers was unsurpassed. Unexpectedly, things changed dramatically. The long-distance train tracks between Beijing and Shanghai were rapidly built. Train stations were set up outside the Changmen gate. As a result, the orioles and swallows of Qingyang dispersed, and merchants moved, competing to flock to Daiqiao and Changting, which suddenly became bustling markets. Qingyang gradually became desolate. The ancient road and setting sun only saw shepherd boys wandering. Although the Japanese tried hard to revive it, they specially opened Tongyin Garden in the summer to attract tourists, but because the location was remote, few people came to enjoy the scenery, and it eventually closed due to insufficient funds. The proverb "cold water Panmen" had long been known for a reason. However, every year during the late spring season, the sides of the road near the Japanese consulate were planted with cherry blossoms, white as snow. Many elegant scholars and poets came here to comment and appreciate them, and to mourn at the nearby Song Dynasty Grasshopper Tomb and the Han Dynasty General Who Conquered the Xiongnu, Sun Jian, and the tomb of Wu's wife, General Ce. Recently, someone from Qingyang, Wuzhong, said that a household in the area dug a well and found a stone tablet. After rubbing it, the inscription could be identified as: (The melancholy of the chaotic world is soaring, the rivers and seas are tumbling, and the mountains are shaking. The bugle calls in the morning and the horns sound at night. The general is angry and eight flags flee.) The part below was damaged and the words are unknown, nor is there any date or inscription. It seems to be a hidden prophecy of today's Japanese pirates. The words are ancient and vigorous and can be recited, but the phrase "The general is angry and eight flags flee" is obscure and its meaning is unknown. I will record it first so that I can observe whether it will be fulfilled in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Record of the Shanghai Volunteer Army Oath-Taking and Grand Review <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Zhaoji</p>
<p>This time, the violent Japanese invaded our Northeast and massacred our compatriots, causing pain and indignation throughout the country. Mr. Ye Huijun, Mr. Li Cishan, Mr. Chen Yafu and other famous people in Shanghai were filled with righteous indignation and specially organized the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Salvation Volunteer Army. The number of people who signed up was endless, reaching over 10,000, willing to meet the Japanese invaders on the battlefield to fight to the death. They have been practicing combat exercises at the crack of dawn for several days, and the results have been quite good. The oath-taking ceremony was held on November 1st at the Public Sports Ground on Dajilu, Ximen. I went there at 4:00 AM. The sky had not yet broken, and the cold wind was biting, but the volunteer soldiers had already arrived solemnly, showing a glimpse of their spirit. The oath-taking ceremony was held at around 9:00 AM. Having returned from the meeting, I will record my observations and experiences as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue: A reed shed was built high in the venue to serve as the command platform. Two wireless telephones were set up on both sides for broadcasting. Chinese Boy Scouts maintained order in the venue in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>Raising the Flag and Firing Cannons: At 10:00 AM, the national flag was raised and firecrackers were set off. The blue sky and white sun flag shone on the earth, symbolizing the overthrow of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>Inspection by Important Figures: More than 10,000 volunteer soldiers lined up and marched forward. Figures from the military and political circles, as well as Ye Huijun, Li Cishan, Chen Yafu, and others, stood around to inspect the solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>Oath-Taking Ceremony: After the inspection, all committee members, officers, and soldiers took the oath. Representatives from the Central Training Headquarters, Garrison Headquarters, City Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, and Anti-Japanese National Salvation organizations all gave speeches.</p>
<p>Busy Photography: Reporters from Shen Bao and Shi Bao newspapers held cameras and were extremely busy taking pictures. Lianhua Film Company was also present to film.</p>
<p>Liangjiang Rescue: Ms. Gu Lihua, Principal of Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, organized a rescue team and led all the female rescuers to the venue. They wore white cloth rhombus hats with a red cross in the middle and long white cloth shirts with numbers. Once they are on the battlefield, they will rely on these ladies for rescue.</p>
<p>Model Soldiers: The Second District of the Volunteer Army has made rapid progress in gymnastics. Their steps are neat and their appearance is magnificent. They can be called model volunteer soldiers.</p>
<p>Singing the Party Song: After the oath-taking ceremony, all the soldiers paraded while the military music was melodious and they sang the Party Song ("The Three Principles of the People, the foundation of our Party, to build the Republic of China and advance to the Great Harmony. You, many talented people, are the vanguard of the people, working tirelessly day and night, following the principles, swearing to be diligent, brave, faithful, and loyal, with one heart and one mind from beginning to end.") Finally, there was a photo session and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>A New Invention to Isolate Sounds: Those who live in the city are always surrounded by the noises of people, cars, and horses. It is really headache-inducing, and it is possible to shorten their lifespans. Therefore, it is a good idea to isolate yourself from the noises outside. Recently, the American Mr. H. Maxim invented something like that, and he recently had a public test in New York, and the results were very good. In recent years, tests like this have been done many times, but they could only be applied to new houses. It is difficult to isolate sounds by putting something between the walls and the outside. If you wanted to apply this to an existing house, you would have to rebuild it. However, Mr. Maxim's invention can be installed in an existing house without this trouble. Therefore, this is much better than previous inventions. Most doctors say that sounds have a very big effect on people's nerves. Therefore, hospitals welcome Mr. Maxim's invention, so that the patients can rest peacefully and will not be bothered by the city's noises, which will affect their health.</p>

<p>— Jian Xing</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to Hechengtengfu for business and went to the North Station to buy a ticket and board the train. After a while, the bells rang and the train wheels rumbled, and the vendors on the train began to do business, and the newspaper business was even more prosperous than usual, because everyone was eager to see the news from the Northeast because of the Japanese atrocities and the national crisis.</p>
<p>An old man in the next seat had a bald head and missing teeth. Judging from his appearance, he was like a mediocre scholar, but he was very talkative. He was talking about current affairs with a small fat man, strongly criticizing the Chinese people for not being consistently patriotic. He said that the Chinese people were like sleepy idlers who did not notice when mosquitoes sucked their blood or fleas bit their skin. Only when rats gnawed at their toes and the pain was severe did they wake up and scold the rats. When the rats retreated slightly, they went back to sleep as before. The rats knew they were sleepy, so they gnawed at their thighs or bit their arms. The sleepy man woke up and went back to sleep, angrily scolding the rats but not thinking about how to prevent them. Now the rats have occupied his thighs and made them their nests. Although the sleepy man is angry and roars wildly, because he has been tormented by the rats for a long time and because he is sleepy and has internal diseases all over his body, he has no strength to drive away the rats and only calls for help from his neighbors. But the rats are secretly laughing and will soon fall asleep again. Although the words are extreme, they cannot be said to be inappropriate. Then the old man changed his tone and went from national affairs to his family affairs. The old man has a son named Jia in Shanghai who drives a car for a certain mansion and is in love with a dancer, and they have recently started living together. Jia's wife in his hometown did not know about this, but her neighbors who returned from Shanghai revealed the matter. The wife was very angry and went to Jia's residence in Shanghai and cried and shouted. At first, Jia deceived the dancer that he was not married, but now the dancer knew that she had been deceived by Jia and scolded Jia for being ungrateful. Jia was extremely angry and slapped his wife's face, but the wife turned around and went straight to the Huangpu River and committed suicide. The dancer then accused Jia of enticement in court. Now Jia is imprisoned and awaiting trial. The old man's trip was for this matter. He sighed and said no more. I felt that this matter was quite similar to the plot of the new silent film "Spring Colors on the Stage," but the methods were slightly different. In "Spring Colors on the Stage," the singer Li Huifang, after talking with Gui Bao and knowing the secrets of her lover, was overwhelmed with grief and indignation. However, her expression when she returned the diamond ring and rescued Gui Bao showed her great personality. The dancer's accusation against Jia for seduction was also very satisfying and served as a warning to those who deceive women. As for Jia and Zhang Xiaorong in "Spring Colors on the Stage," their behavior of forgetting the old for the new was ruthless and unjust, and Jia's wife and Gui Bao's misfortune in meeting the wrong person and having a short life were no different. Therefore, I know that all kinds of facts in the world can be made into dramas, and the plots in dramas are also the facts of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Wang Jiyuan's Tour of Europe <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Sao</p>
<p>Over the past month, Mr. Wang Jiyuan held a European tour exhibition at the Mingfu Library and the Bank Association Club. More than 8,000 people visited the exhibition, and 14 pieces of artwork were sold. Viewers praised him for it. Wang was inspired by well-known figures such as Matisse, Pica, and Staron during his time in Paris. He was made aware that all these well-known figures had different styles because each person had their own unique expression. All people are different and do not need to be the same. If they are the same, it is the same as a machine. Wang worked hard to innovate, and worked at the Grand Chaomi Institute and the Gera Laoshi Institute. People saw that Wang had unique strokes, simple lines, and sharp lines. Le Linearismeaiguetsimple is able to contend with the skills of the Japanese artist Foujita. Wang enjoyed being close to nature, and painting churches, famous gardens, European figures. People would stretch their necks to watch, as if he was the god of victory. (Water Pool), (Little Arc de Triomphe), (Viewing the Stove), (In Front of the Jiling Temple), (Street), (White Wall), (Snow Forest), (Fisherman), (Drizzle), (Sunset Glow), (Light Mist), (Winter Day), (Early Autumn), (Early Morning) and so on. All of these paintings were moving, and showed strong emotions and color. Not only did these figures have shapes, but they also showed the essence of the universe. Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, morning, noon, evening, and rain were vividly shown. The European merchants, students, church members, and vagabonds that he painted were also vivid. Some people always complain about Chinese art, and pay more attention to Western styles and techniques. People do not know that the artist needs to quickly capture the lightning-fast moments. In addition, the beauty of art is the style and not the details. If everyone adds unnecessary details, it is the same as forcing Kang Youwei to learn how to be a clerk, or forcing Wu Changshuo to be a painter.</p>
<p>In August 1930, Wang visited Belgium and participated in the World Expo, spending a month there and bringing back more than 40 pieces of artwork. In January of this year, he organized an exhibition at the Galerie Barreiro in Paris, which was well received and praised by Europeans. The critic Charles Fegdal said that he used Western impressionism, perspective, and techniques to paint the East.</p>
<p>Wang originally wanted to go to Berlin and London for long-term travel, but unfortunately, he suffered a foot disease when he arrived in Frankford and had to return to Paris. Soon, his friend Ye Yun, a student at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, introduced Miss Wan, an Italian, and a Spanish dancer to his residence to serve as models for (Hesitation), (Looking in the Mirror), (Girl) and so on. Wang would not abandon even a moment. This fall, he returned to China and created dozens of works on the way. After arriving in Shanghai, he continued to study at the Art Garden. His spirit can be used as a good model for future generations. (Relocate to Help Revitalize)</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Discussion of Shrimp and Crab Disasters <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Zao</p>
<p>Shrimp and crabs are both arthropods in the aquatic world. Although they have different shapes, they are of the same type. Shrimp produced in April and May are called (Seasonal Shrimp). They are transparent and taste very fresh. Crabs that are on the market after this time are called (June King). Although they are not fat, their taste is palatable. Lovers often compete to buy them to satisfy their appetites. However, the production of these two items varies from year to year. Therefore, our county has a saying: (Shrimp disasters and crab chaos). I don't know how this omen was obtained. It is probably the common sense passed down by the elders of the past.</p>
<p>This year, there are more shrimp than in the past. From the first half of the year to the present, there are almost no days when they are not abundant in the market. In the past, the price of each catty was more than one thousand copper coins. Now, half of that amount can be obtained. Crabs are also the same, but there are still more supplies than demand. If you go to the market to see, they are almost everywhere. It is also strange. However, our county's agricultural production has always been known for its cotton being seven parts and rice being three parts. Since the continuous rain has caused disaster, the cotton has flowers but no bells. Even if we want to change to planting other things, it is not possible. The rice harvest is later, and the autumn harvest is only 30% of the total county's harvest. Therefore, since this month, farmers from the four villages have been reporting disasters in the city, arriving at the county court day after day, many to more than a thousand and few to hundreds. County Magistrate Pan Gengsheng is suffering from this. Each person is given one hundred pennies, but those who come continue to come in an endless stream, and there are even those who are not farmers but are profiting from this district. Reluctantly, after giving the money, the palm is watermarked to distinguish it so that it does not come again. It is also ridiculous.</p>
<p>Those who know say that shrimp is a sign of many years of disaster, and that the abundance of crabs is a good sign. There are wars in the country, almost in proportion to the rise and fall of crabs. In the past, the crab market did not reach September, and the circular navel of October was gradually scarce. Even if there were, the price was expensive, and non-gourmets could not easily afford them. At this time, there is still an increase without a decrease. According to the crab catchers, each night a net can catch dozens of catties, and those who plant broken hats in the water can catch even more. The rumors about crab chaos are believed by those who talk about it. In this year of national disaster and famine, everyone uses this as a common saying. Therefore, I have specially recorded one or two of them. I think it is not only our county that has this phenomenon, but other places must also have it. Is there a definite relationship between the omens of good and bad luck and the nature of things?</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The countryman thought, (When it comes to farming, you have to consult us countrymen. As the saying goes, "Confused, confused, soak rice seeds in the sixth month of the lunar calendar." If the rice seedling planting committee is sent down in the seventh month of the lunar calendar, that's just like the saying, "Soak rice seeds in the sixth month of the lunar calendar." No wonder those big shots spend the whole year fighting battles and discussing national affairs. This kind of farming is done by us barefoot people. They don't have the time to manage it.) The countryman was just explaining to himself when he suddenly heard a rumbling sound. Everyone shouted,</p>
<p>(The train is coming!) (The train is coming!)</p>
<p>The countryman recognized that this was a third-class car. He used to take the fourth-class car, and he saw that the outside of the car had four vertical marks. Now that he was taking the third-class car, it had three vertical marks. He thought that the car for livestock was probably a five vertical mark. He followed the crowd, pushing and shoving, into the third-class car. As soon as he stepped in, he was so frightened that he backed out. (I went to the wrong place! This is not a third-class car!)</p>
<p>(Who says it's not a third-class car?) said one of the people who went in with him.</p>
<p>(That's not right! I'm afraid this is a sleeping car, right?) The countryman was still hesitant to go in.</p>
<p>(Bah! How can there be sleeping cars during the day?) Of course, this person's experience with taking trains was more informed than the countryman's.</p>
<p>(Then why are there so many people sleeping in the car?)</p>
<p>Sure enough, in that third-class car, people were sleeping head to head and feet to feet, stretched out and lying down. That car was not a row of chairs, but strips of chairs. Because everyone was crowded into the first few third-class cars, these last few third-class cars were very empty. People who take the train are unwilling to have space in the car, probably a common psychology. Therefore, people who sit in the second-class car, who were originally supposed to sit two people in one chair, would also lie down and occupy the space when they saw an empty chair. They also saw that there was space in the first-class car, so people who sat in the second-class car also felt it was a pity and often went to the first-class car to occupy that space. Now that people in the third-class car see an empty seat next to them, why wouldn't they turn their bodies to occupy a few more seats?</p>
<p>Not only that, but there was a long shelf above the third-class car for passengers to put their luggage. Now that there were fewer passengers, there was naturally less luggage. Two friends in yellow pants arched their buttocks and slept on it, really like sleeping in a car, with high and low bunks. No wonder the countryman mistakenly thought he had walked into a sleeping car.</p>

<p>The Gold Market Continues to Decline</p>
<p>No Change in Half a Day. Yesterday (the 2nd), the posted gold price remained weak, with only slight fluctuations and no special changes. The market was only moderately active four or five times, and then finally fell by one or two taels. The industry was generally calm and there was not much trading volume. It was almost the same as the day before. The market continued to rise, opening lower and breaking 690 taels. Afterwards, buyers were keen as the foreign exchange market was apparently flat but secretly flexible. Banks were still able to accept inflows, and the market situation slightly stabilized. The price initially rose to ninety-two or three taels. Later in the day, the market was closed according to regulations due to the Western autumn horse racing season.</p>
<p>Opening Fell More Than Five Taels. It fell five taels and two qian from the early opening to six hundred eighty-nine and a half taels. The large bars then rose eight-tenths of a qian, and the forward contract rose sixteen-fifths. The silver price only rose one-eighth. However, recently, expectations of a price drop led to an unexpected rise, and people’s sentiments lowered. Furthermore, Shunli, Dadecheng, Wanxing, and others all sold off, followed by eighty-eight taels and five qian. In a short period, Yongfeng Zhifeng Yong bought in, immediately adding twelve taels to ninety taels and five qian. The English exchange rate did not change, and the gold squeeze small exchange rate decreased by one-two-five. Only because the autumn race was half an hour early, the announcement was made at nine o’clock. Fuchang Bingxing Yu Da Hengchang Jing and others also continued to rise to ninety-three taels and two qian. Da Hing Yong Zhifeng Yong Hui ○ Futai Heng and others sold, and it was heard that Indian merchants were selling one-month English gold at one eight three one two five, so it retreated two taels or so. At nine-thirty, it was ninety-one taels and three qian. At that time, there were only a few qian up and down. Subsequently, HSBC ate U.S. dollars for this month at thirty-two yuan five, which had already pulled up one and a half taels to ninety-two taels and eight qian. In a short while, HSBC sold a regular portion of thirty-two yuan five six two five, which was bought by American, Japanese and other banks. Zhi Feng Yong Bing, and others sold until after ten o'clock when it was only ninety taels and two qian. Then, Tianfeng Yong Dadecheng, and others scrambled to advance, and HSBC ate February's two yuan five six two five. Also, yesterday, twelve could be English Society one eight two seven five. China Bank absorbed Yuan Rong two one one two five. Until after ten fifty, it was ninety-two taels and eight qian, with a one-tael and zero-head. From eleven o'clock to eleven fifteen, it seemed to be slightly downstream, rotating around ninety-two taels. Within the field, it was not bad. Afterwards, because Zhi Feng Yong's intention was still strong, the account fell by more than one tael again. At noon, it was ninety taels and nine qian. Indian Exchange reported entering three Annas, but Tong Maichang bought in and raised it to ninety-one taels and seven qian in three or four minutes. By noon, it closed at ninety-one taels and three qian, down three taels and four qian from the previous weekend. After the market closed, another one and a half to one tael and two or three qian were made. According to the maximum price of ninety-three taels and two qian and the minimum price of eighty-eight and a half taels in half a day, there was a difference of four taels and seven qian. The early market price of secondary goods was eighty-nine taels, and the noon closing price was ninety-one taels and three qian. The quoted price was changed to seven hundred and sixty-two taels, with seventy or so taels being booked for water replenishment, which was also ninety-one taels. The bare bar was increased by eight taels six or seven qian.</p>
<p>There were no large quantities of transactions. According to the statistics of surface transactions, Tong Taichang, Yuansheng, Yuanmao, Yong Qian, Changxiang, Yifeng Yong, and others all advanced, with Shunli advancing more and selling less. Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing, Yuantai, Futai, Daxing Yong, Yifeng Tai, and Fengcheng all sold out. Dadecheng Tianfeng Yong sold out and then advanced.

<p>Market Overview: Currently, the financial world is in a state of constant flux due to the prevailing situation, and silver interest rates fluctuate sharply. Foreign cents see-saw up and down. Since the banking holiday the day before yesterday caused a shortage of head lining and raised the interest rate, it has remained high until yesterday and cannot return to looseness. This is because the banks are in the midst of the autumn horse racing season, and they only operate for half a day, and even stop signing early at 11:00 a.m., so the situation is no less than that of Sunday. Therefore, it rises in the morning and falls in the afternoon. As for the foreign cents, they are still peaceful, with a difference of only two and a half mils between morning and noon.</p>

Later, due to the autumn race in the afternoon, the customs were closed, and various receipts and deliveries were put on hold. It is estimated that the receipts and deliveries of Chinese merchants' tickets were more than 3.1 million, the receipts and deliveries of foreign merchants' tickets were 2.78 million, and the receipts and deliveries of various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous items were about 9 million.

<h3 id="e203">Securities and Bond Markets Develop Vigorously <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The market sentiment is very good, and buying and selling are very prosperous. Twelve kinds of bonds have risen sharply and stopped trading.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of various bonds in the Chinese Securities Exchange. There are quite a lot of spot trading varieties, and the transactions are still not lonely. The forward market is also more prosperous than last weekend. Except for the ninety-six whole six, the December futures of various bonds have been fully opened. It is found that the trend of the market price of each bond is sudden. It is said that the situation is expanding and the diplomatic situation is developing. It is also observed that the popularity of the market is suddenly good. All parties are buying very hard, and the demand is very different. The market price of each bond has risen rapidly and vigorously. The good situation in the market is unprecedented recently. In the pre-market, there were two types of full six and unified tax December futures that rose and stopped trading. The stop-trading price of each bond was only a few cents, and there were also many. In the post-market, the rising trend of the market was still strong and the buying atmosphere was as strong as before. Therefore, each price rose sharply and stopped trading one after another. The only ones that did not stop trading were the disarmament customs duties, the ninety-six and other kinds. As a result, compared with last week, each soared by three yuan seven or eight cents to more than four yuan. However, the compiled disarmament was only good for two yuan three cents, and the customs duty ninety-six each rose by one yuan two or three cents. According to market news, there are various theories for the rise in bond debt. It is said that there are new changes in the south, and there is no problem with internal peace and unity. It is also said that the sympathy of the United Kingdom and the United States for us is like the sun, and we will not withdraw our troops and continue our military aggression. We will take action with Japan. According to this, both domestic and foreign countries can be observed. Although the news has not been confirmed, it will not be without some basis. The market sentiment at one time was very prosperous, and buying was very active. However, judging from the bond market situation, it is still not easy to predict, and it still needs to be determined by the development of the ring. It is estimated that the total spot trading for the whole day was 42,500 yuan, and the futures were 6.7 million in the morning and more than 4.1 million in the post-market, totaling 10,830,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is slightly firm because of the saying that Japanese factories have imposed a blockade and stopped work, so people's sentiment is relatively firm, but the root is still difficult to loosen, which makes speculators' minds indifferent and the situation remains calm. There has been no major increase, and the real reason is that the financial situation is not active due to current affairs, and there is no major hope for commerce.</p>
<p>The number of new buyers in the Manchu standard has decreased. The market atmosphere at the opening of the market was slightly firm, and the number of new people in the market has decreased. Each month has risen slightly by four or five qian. In the afternoon, I heard that the actual sales are still good, and each month has risen by two, four, or five qian. The total turnover for the whole day was 24,500 bales. It was found that the inflow and outflow of Changcheng was 1,250 bales, Hengyi was 1,950 bales, and Houfeng was 1,150 bales.

<p>The cotton market is very firm, but the situation of American cotton is average due to sluggish consumption. However, most people in this port believe that the year is barren, and some flower merchants and Han gangs are holding on tightly. Some people have an empty mind this month, but manufacturers can purchase cheap foreign cotton, so there is no intention to inquire about this flower. Currently, the source of each route has not been smooth. According to some, the price of Sifang land has already loosened. If foreign cotton is stable and the exchange rate is soft, it is feared that the imported foreign cotton will continue to increase in the future.</p>
<p>The Manchu standard rose by two or three qian. The Manchu standard opened in the pre-market with a weak American cotton market. The market atmosphere was average. Later, the bulls increased their bets, and each month rose by one qian and five fen. In the afternoon, it rose by five fen again. The total turnover for the whole day was 92,400 dan. It was found that Taixing sold 2,200 dan, Dachangcheng 2,600 dan, Yongchang 1,500 dan, Shenchang 1,800 dan, Yuanren 1,400 dan, Dafeng 1,100 dan, and Rongxing 1,200 dan.

<p>Although American cotton was weak in Mumbai last week, Mumbai remained firm. Except for local factories and China, there were few inquiries. Many speculators continued to buy. The fear of low British and American exchange rates was also related to the market. The spot price was not affected by the amount of hedged sales. The transaction was sluggish due to the high price of cotton. However, due to the exchange rate assistance from China, there were still shipments to the market. There were not many households.</p>
<p>Liverpool Last week, the spot demand was not as good as the previous cycle. The business in the futures market was lighter. Although the quantity was unexpected after the publication of the American cotton ginning report, this was not affected by the exchange rate. The amount of hedging and bull profit-taking was absorbed, and the Hou and cotton market situation was flat.</p>

<p>The Hexia Rice Market Rose Sharply by Three Corners</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of various gangs in Nantou were scarce, and the stocks in the port were also thin. The urban and rural stores took advantage of this stall to add to their stocks, so the situation was increasing day by day. The northern japonica species increased by one or two corners. The old broken stocks have slightly changed with the weather. Moreover, Yang Du's sharp arrivals have been sold as soon as they arrive, and the situation is tight. Baige has changed to Yinyuan and lacks goods to meet the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather turned fine, and there were not many sources from the west. The transaction in this street was not very active. Su Chang's white japonica rice slightly had hoarding households opening a disc on the stockade, which was reduced by two corners. Yixing Jiangyin's white japonica rice was selling well, and the price rose by a corner. The Baige rice in Xujiao Lisi and Jing was still selling well, and the price increased by three corners again. Baige Yuan arrived in two pieces yesterday, and the winery still needed it urgently, resulting in a tight price. The sharp stone bridge wild rice and Dubu rice were tight and settled again. Hexia Hujiao was around 5,000 shi.</p>

<p>Market price rises step by step</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation continued the aftermath of the smooth handling of the Japanese street before. The people's minds were consistent, and the arrival and storage of white japonica rice in Hexia were both small. The sharp new rice has not yet poured in. The street firms paid attention to the foreign rice, which has not been selling well for a long time, due to the rise in Du rice price. After the foreign rice was successfully sold in this street, the market price rose step by step. Although the transaction yesterday was not as much as the previous day, the market price rose by another corner, which was about three corners higher than the end of last month. The United Market continued to open more than 1,000 bags, and the price of small ground rice was about ten yuan and three corners. The price of Saigon No. 1 was reported to have risen, and the foreign firm did not sell it.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the powder market in the upper and lower afternoons, the market showed a sharp rise in each month due to the good quotation of foreign. The rise in the past two days has been about one yuan, two, three, or four corners. The main reason for the rise and fall of the market seems to be entirely controlled by foreign countries. The sharp drop in the past month or so was initially due to the low quotation, and then due to the urgency of orders. Now, the situation has changed, foreign wheat is in good condition, and it has improved by one and a half corners per bushel compared to the lowest time, resulting in active people's minds and a strong buying atmosphere again. In such an environment, it naturally rises step by step. (Because Zhang Gang is drawing 780,000 bags this month, the market is more stable) However, after the rise here and the following, the continued order of foreign wheat is inevitable, which is worthy of attention. As a result, the current month is three and a half points higher than the end of the previous month, December is three points higher, January is three and a half points higher, February is three points and two li higher, March is two points and seven li higher, and April initially opened at two taels, one qian, seven points, and two li, which is also one point and a half higher than the closing price.</p>
<h3 id="e210">The Futures Wheat Market Trended Slightly Higher <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the upper and lower afternoons, the market in each month showed a steady trend. Since the quotation of foreign wheat has risen by about one yuan, two, three, or four corners in a row, the people's minds inside and outside the industry have naturally changed. Moreover, the hedgers of the firm have also drawn out the chips of the exchange, and they feel that the reduction is reduced. However, because most of the bulls also took the opportunity to end and were unwilling to pick up again, the degree of rise was not much. Observing the later steps, if there is no major change in foreign wheat or the factory does not purchase again, the market price should be able to stabilize. As a result, the current month is two points better than the end of the previous month, December and January are four points better, February is three points better, March is five points better, and April initially opened at four taels, two qian, and two fen, and the closing price did not rise or fall.</p>

<p>The Market Price Rose Again by Three Taels</p>
<p>In the past, lily seeds had more arrivals, and the upper and middle villages had fallen to thirty-one or two taels, and then rose to thirty-four taels. However, the goods were better, and the stocks gradually became scarce, and the sources were few. According to the letter, the local price rose to forty-two yuan. There were more than twenty arrivals here. Yesterday, I heard that the opening price was thirty-seven taels, which was three taels higher than before. As for the middle and inferior goods, they did not improve because they did not meet the customer sales.</p>

<p>The Form of Coarse Sand and White Market is Turning Upwards</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market in the producing area still lacked telegraphic inquiries, and the public market plan. The buying atmosphere of the 24th grade coarse sand white in the Dutch sugar market was still active, and the transaction price was eleven taels and one qian and a half, and the coarse grain was eleven taels and two qian and two and a half. The export of cotton Dutch white at twelve taels and five cents was also lacking, and the market was quite popular. The ingress and egress of Dagu sugar were slackened, and each was: DY twelve taels two qian, HM eleven taels five qian two and a half, and E ten taels seven qian and a half. The trend was flat. That is, the B company for the cargo being loaded continued to open the price, still eight taels and three qian and a half, which was very popular. The Fukuka Foreign Firm sold 225 tons of Dutch sugar for the November delivery of coarse sand white at the price of 5 Dutch guilders, 5 corners and 7 and a half cents. At the same time, the Qiuxin Factory also sold 200 tons at the price of 5 guilders, 5 corners and 7 and a half cents. Although the company's intention to enter into a new tax increase is still active, the market atmosphere is very flat and lacks spirit.</p>

<p>Anhui Dried Cocoons Sold Out at a Firm Price</p>
<p>The cocoon is required to be 700 taels The price of pure silk Small factories still do not improve</p>
<p>Recently, the silk prices of European and American factories in this port have been unable to rise, and the telegraphic silk prices have been extremely small. The transaction is almost stagnant, and the cocoon prices are not cheap. Yesterday, the guild said that a silk factory in Shanghai North planned to supplement 180 dan of dry cocoons from Wuhu, Anhui. The cocoon customer's opening price was still firm, and the net cocoon had to be pulled for 700 taels. The factory said that it would be too huge to pull and combine the current market silk price, and it did not dare to throw and buy. The transaction remains to be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Silk Sales are Stagnant During the Autumn Race <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the autumn horse racing period for Western merchants in this port. The silk market of foreign villages was only open for half a day in the morning. As usual, it stopped working in the afternoon, and the silk sales became more stagnant. The prices from Europe and the United States are still difficult to rise. The Chinese silk merchants all hold a bearish attitude, and the market atmosphere is stagnant. Yesterday, only Chang Qianjing entered ten packages of white dry silk at a high price. The coarse yellow silk entered thirteen packages at an average price.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port was full of vigour, and the shops such as Jinlong, Xiehe, and Fushi made every effort to search for Zhen and Mei green tea from the tea market. The transaction was quite active. The sales of Pingshui green tea in the United States also saw a slight activity. However, the market price of each tea market fell uniformly, which was two or three taels lower than last week. The remaining Zhenmei Gongxi, etc., were still stagnant, and the goods in the upper and middle villages were particularly unattended.</p>

<p>Black Iron Sheet Arrivals and Sales are Both Strong</p>
<p>The transaction of black iron sheet has recently been very good due to the crazy handling of the Tianjin gang and the successive purchases of Qingdao and Yantai gangs. The market situation is very good. The standard is affected by the trend of the trend, so it is also two or three cents higher. It is estimated that each dan of 18 sheets can be sold for up to 11 taels and 5 qian. However, since the goods in the market have been handled, they have reported that they are rare, and the long-term road goods were also sold out for 4500 dan yesterday, and the price was 11 taels and 2 qian and a half. However, judging from the recent appetite of each gang, I am afraid that the market will have to rise and not fall within the year.</p>
