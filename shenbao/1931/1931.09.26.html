<p>（日内瓦）　國聨日代表芳澤今晩有宣言發表、否認東京軍人派之已將文治派驅逐、而掌政府大權之謡傳、芳澤又謂日本軍隊已自吉林撤退、今僅佔領沿鐵道之數地、至日本撤兵之原因、恐係中國軍隊之反攻云云、芳澤又謂中國有數處條約口岸之日本留民、已奉命退出、而瀋陽地方則已建設文浥之政府云、以上芳澤所陳述之種種事實、不久即大半爲中國代表施肇基所駁斥、施氏稱、彼已直接接到中國之報告、内稱、日本軍隊非但未嘗稍退、且已向哈爾濱區域進兵、故處此形勢日益緊急狀態之下、中國實不得不再請求理事會、組織國際調查委員會前往東省視察、芳澤氏對此動議、則默不一言、中國派遣調查委員會之請求、國聨方面固已贊同、今所待者日本之同意耳、日本對於此點之答案、大約明日可到、倘此舉日本不十分反對、國聨可立即派遣調查委員會、該委員會應由南京選派非中國籍外人二員、及東京選派之非日本籍委員二人、與中立國之代表三人、由理事會指充之、再則國聨職員現已在遠東者、或即將就近派充云、又俄國近來對於東省事件之態度如何、外間頗多揣測之辭、但俱係毫無根據之空談、惟俄國在满邊之駐軍、顯已增加、而外交委員加拉罕又已啓程東行、可見俄政府對於遠東事件、實至重視、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　昨夜日代表團接東京政府來文、已於今日侵晨將内容通告行政會主席勒樂、預料行政會辦理满案之特别委員會、將於本日考慮日政府來文、繼將從事討論解决該問題之方法、惟現聞日政府並不與行政會意見相投、而行政會非常任會員及議會議員因辦理满案之五人委員會所供與彼等之消息、甚爲簡單、似皆有不满意之象、據數方面消息、日政府來文措詞和緩、今或可視該問題實際業已解决云、（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　芳澤公使今晨接得日本答復國聨理事會之照會、理事會定今日午後召集特别會討論、日本覆牒於國聨主張組織满洲調查團雖表示拒絶、但此爭點今日可望解决、國聨議會及理事會預定明日休會、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日本國聨協會名譽會長石井、今日與路透訪員談及國聨對满案所取之行動、而尤注重外傳美國不贊成派特别委員團至满調查事、謂國聨此種意見、不啻疑及日政府莊重之宣言、信任乃屬相互的、如國聨不信任日本、則日本對國聨之信任、亦將大受影響、譬如國聨對於會員團所供軍備之實情、而有所疑、主派委員團查其虚實、則豈自尊國所能歡迎、恐軍縮計畫全體結構將爲所敗矣云云、（二十日五路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>異哉日政府之聲明書（一）</h3>
<p>自日人對我東北實施暴力發動而後。日人即鼓其如簧之舌。以「自衛行動」「地方事件」「保障佔領」等滑稽名詞。掩飾事實之眞相。希圖矇蔽天下人之耳目。吾人尚以爲此種背棄信義蹂躪公理之言論爲一部分自由行動之野心軍人於事後希圖卸罪之遁辭。旣曾於「世界列國其注意日人之暴行」一評中。痛切加以駁斥。乃據廿五日日閣議决定所發表之「日本政府關於满洲事件之聲明書。」聲明五點。一味狡辯。與日野心軍人所言。直爲同一鼻孔出氣。而其否認事實。架詞誣陷。則更有過之無不及。政治爲暴力所刧持。外交失其常態。淆亂是非。倒行逆施。此眞足貽世界政治歷史上以永遠之恥辱。事實勝於雄辯。多言徒足貽羞。嗟乎日人。可以休矣。</p>
<p>茲請就其聲明之五點。逐一予以辯駁。</p>
<p>（一）聲明書第一點中有曰。「日本政府從來以中日親善共存共榮爲一定方針。始終努力以期實現。」嗚呼。日人果欲誰欺。欺天乎。數十年來。日人固無日不持「中日親善共存共榮」之曲譜。自彈自唱。然而證之行動。則日人實無日不處心積慮於亡我滅我。使日得獨覇東亞。獨存獨榮。對我東北資源之强掠。與鐵道之强佔。二十一條之威脅。兩次出兵我山東。皇姑屯之炸案。親善乎。抑侵略乎。舊創新痛。疊疊徧體。一部中日交涉史。斑斑點點。皆爲我國人之血淚。在日人固正以此而欣喜歡躍。慶幸其國運之隆昌。而在我則忍辱負重。椎心泣血。身之所受。皆未敢一日忘。我國固竭誠歡迎日人之誠摯的親善。俾兩國共臻於繁榮。然而其如事實之離理想太遠何。此事實之至足以擊破日政府之狡辯者一。聲明書中又言。近年來中國官民之行動。常剌激日國民之感情。尤其在日本最有緊密利害關係之满蒙地方。最近頻發各種不快事件。十九日夜半中國軍隊拆毁南满鐵路。故引起中日軍隊之衝突。言之無理無物殆無復過。夫新興之中國。欲圖完成其獨立國家之主權。必須取消足以桎梏中國民族生命之一切不平等條約。實爲理所當然。基於此種理論。而内以勗勵國人。外以昭告友邦。更屬理正言順。日本官民何遂漠視中國主權與正當之要求。而視爲逆耳之言。動無名之火。次之。「满蒙」爲中國領土。與日本有何緊密之利害關係。萬案以及其他事件。皆無不由於日人一手製成。歷年日人在我東北之行動。暴扉恣睢。心目中寗復有我國人。而猶未能快日人之意。則除取我東北大陸。雙手獻奉日人而外。日人當更無快意之時。復次。我國軍隊拆毁南满路。有何證據。日人恐出兵無名。借端挑釁。證之萬案韓案。以及所謂中村事件。至爲顯明。所謂中國軍隊拆毁南满路軌。何莫非此同一手段。司馬昭之心。路人早皆知之矣。此爲事實之足以擊破日之狡辯者二。</p>
<p>（二）聲明書中第二點聲明謂當時守備满鐵日軍僅一萬四百人。而四週有中國軍隊二十二萬。事態俄然告急。故不得不制敵機先。此即無異認爲日軍之暴行。純爲自衞。誠如日政府所言。則我國應已有對日排戰之决心。如蓄意挑釁。則何不逕襲擊日軍。而乃作拆毁满鐵之愚舉。就使我方已誓意挑釁。則以二十倍於日軍之軍隊。二十當一。亦足以殲滅日暴軍而有餘。何至一任暴力襲擊。佔領瀋陽。毫無抵抗。再進一步言。瀋旣被佔領之後。我方軍隊仍可反攻。何至一退再退。終始讓步。世固未有先已準備戰爭。而終無抵抗者。此爲事實之足以擊破日人之狡辯者三。</p>

<h3>堅持直接交涉</h3>
<p>反對第三者之干涉</p>
<p>（東京）　日政府今日重新表示、祗願與南京政府直接交涉、閣議决定反對國聨會或第三者之干涉、至於國聨理事會主張派遣國際調查團赴满洲實地調查、日本仍表示拒絶、日政府已訓令芳澤公使照會國聨理事會長勒樂、謂日軍在满洲之行動、出於自衞、該糾紛純係地方性質、無須干涉、並謂满洲方面中日關係、具有特殊性質、調查團適足引起糾紛、及阻碍中日直接談判、上述决議在日政府宣言公布後始發表、不啻完全拒絶國聨理事會之行動、日政府並决定萬一中國中部發生抗日事件、則長江一帶之日僑、準備退至上海或漢口、再由日本海軍陸戰隊保護、日本拒絶國聨仲裁之舉動、勢必引起日内瓦方面之新發展、而國聨理事會將如何採取進一步之態度、當爲世界所注意、（二十五日國民社電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）　就美國各方面輿論趨向察之、美人皆有堅决意思、以爲國聨所表示之判斷、必須有效、满洲事件必須和平解决、參議員波拉今日在埃台賀州摩斯戈演說、由軍縮與修約問題而言及满洲危局、謂日本所據以侵入满洲之理由、縱較其現所有者多至十倍、亦不應破壞國際公約·凡爾塞條約·國聨會章·及凱洛格非戰公約云、英下院今日又提出满洲事件、加以討論、外部次官艾登工黨議員之問、詳細報告英外部所得關於日軍自九月十九日起佔據满洲各城鎭之消息、及國聨應付此事之情形、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　德國輿論對中日事件、於駭異之餘、現已漸移注其視線於國際聨盟會、對於該事件之反響如何、能否爲國際聨盟間之主持、故今日中日事項不啻爲國際聨盟會之一試金石也、今日德國之輿論對於國聨頗多譏評之辭、謂國聨向來對於國際間主要事故發生之後、皆採取模稜兩可之態度、畏葸成性、不敢作左右袒云云、持此種論調者爲保守派之報紙·地方指示報·德國普通報紙等等是也、此外對於國聨持擁護之論調者、如伏錫志報、該報稱國際聨盟所處之地位、極爲尊崇、故絶不可作輕躁之行動、非如吾等私人盛怒時之可擊桌狂喊也、故今日若有些微之希望存在、可使日本撤兵、恢復其戰前之狀態者、則國聨理應靜待其自動撤兵、再則國聨絶不能貿然下無所後盾之命令、故處此形勢之下、實非靜候事態之變化不可、但一旦事態明瞭、日本决心蔑視國聨、則國聨將無第二路線可循、惟有起而聲討、而此後之變化、則不可知矣云云、（二十四日國民電）</p>

<h3>與蘇俄之陰謀</h3>
<p>（十續）</p>
<p>此種病徵之客觀、原因固由於敵方之不斷的施以壓迫、而其眞正原因、則爲李立三主戰之殘餘、及右傾　會主義之作　、或動　　心、　兒工作之艱鉅而退縮、或仍應用　日之工作方法或先存成見、認工作之困難、足證明斬計劃之不能實現、全不明瞭目前之困難、乃走上　興道路之必然的難關、因此將第四次大會所决定轉　工作之新基礎、全然疏忽、更缺乏應用新的工作方法來戰勝工作進行艱鉅的勇氣、徒然存養取消的觀念、又不研究工作困難的各種原因、只徒空　工作轉變的口號、這必然的結果、才使當局無法計劃新工作方法之努力推行、以代替舊的工作方法、以是吾人欲謀今後工作之順利、必須與上述各項之缺點劇烈鬥爭、始克有　、</p>
<p>近今全國之重要組織工作、包涵工作之基本轉變、在第四次大會的精神中、已有明確的規定、尤以對排除右傾鬥爭的加緊爲重要、</p>
<p>若自實際觀點言之、主要之右傾危險、必須說明、李立三之理論、亦應肅清、再吸盡忠實之勞工及農民、加入幹部、指導工人排除工作進行中之機會主義、領導工作方面之敏捷聨繫、以期切實備用、甚至仍用舊時工作方法之幣端、亦必克服凈盡、指派制度、亦須改正、各黨部之領袖、須建立在健全之基礎上、大工業區域之工業小組、應從速組織就緒、黨部將於最近監督各級黨部、切實執行中央委員會之决議、成實現社會結構的偉大轉變、</p>
<p>再吾人對於中央農業區之工作、亦須注意、尤以鄰近蘇維埃區域之白色領域爲要、（按即未經赤化之地）至於在蘇維埃區域之内、吾人須注意試騐吾黨工作之基礎、及工作成績、澈底清除黨内之富農、將黨的基礎、建立在無産階級及貧農之上、近來蘇維埃運動之發展、及反革命勢力之壓迫、使吾人對於秘密工作應加倍注意、然後吾黨組織始能不拘何時何地、運行無礙、</p>
<p>爲實現上述中央所規定之工作起見、凡各級黨部對於下列各項、均須有極嚴密之聨絡、且須思及具體工作之方案、而努力實行此等决議、（一）爲實行轉變後之全部工作起見、黨部須將前述工作方針、用通告分布之、指導工作之系統、　嚴行規定、同時　除指派制度、並嚴密各級黨部之紀律、</p>
<p>各省之敎育指導工作、須由省　員會直黨工　區小組、在敎育指導工作中、　　除非實際　　之批評系統、耐於當地之組織、　有一定之帶助、然後始能成　强有力之組織　　幹部份子、建立工黨中的中央核心、并與中委會訂定各項領導之紀律</p>
<p>（二）革命之發展、使吾人對於幹部問題、須有澈底之解决、最重要的使命、爲各級黨部須獲端明瞭幹部之眞實意義、揭穿已往關於幹部　　之不正確之誤解、並指出組成新幹部之具體方案、尤其關於勞工幹部最要之方法、即爲組織分工方法之應用、</p>
<p>地方支部及小組、須改正其對於幹部不負責之錯誤、而須不斷地在工業區域之活動份子中、加緊個人工作、方足以吸收勞工幹部、必如此方能促起地方黨部必須向中央請派「幹部」的要求、（三）小組工作須進行澈底的轉變、工業區的中心小組、亦須在各省設置、在工廠内必須設法盡力活動、並扶助同業機關之發展、小組必須無疑地成爲黨與裠衆之連鎖、在任何環境之下、均須有固定之基礎、小組必須吸收工廠内之一切羣衆組織、對於過去的與羣衆、不發生密切關係之弊端、須急加矯正、</p>
<p>（四）關於鄉村之組織、須預選若干中心農業區域、使鄉村小組隨因之而組成、黨之實力、即於此間寄託、同時須派在城内工作之同志下鄉、以作領導、</p>
<p>鄉村小組之周圍、對於廣大的中農、亦應組織起來、但不准混夾在黨之組織以内、</p>
<p>（五）地方支疗必須改變從前之管理法、高級黨部須分發大批同志於各地、使其在該處組成大的黨團、作領導機關、於工業區小組之聨絡、然後分發黨員到各工廠去工作、</p>
<p>作領導工作之同志、必盡量加入工廠作工、（一如工人）同時在工廠作工之同志、對於地方機關、必須盡傾導之責、（未完）</p>

<p>敎育消息特載</p>
<h3>爲日本暴行敬告敎育界</h3>
<p>（一）舒新城</p>
<p>日本於本月十九日藉口所謂中村事件、突然以暴力佔抿瀋陽、一週來繼續進兵、毁我兵營學校、據我國家命官、慘殺我人民、刦略我財産、甚至行將我經營數十年之兵工廠、亦舉而焚燬、除截至昨日瀋陽附近要地概被侵略而外、吉林亦被佔據、日本此種不顧公理之兇横舉動、實人類文化史中所未有、凡屬人相、莫不切齒、何况我身被蹂躍之國民、更何况我領導羣衆之敎育界、我國民我敎育界之義憤塡胸、力謀正當防衛、自屬應盡而必不可不盡的天職、</p>
<p>亡國之大難當前、我們因剌激而興奮、因興奮而舉動激昻、自是必然的現象、然而誠欲雪恥絶非一朝之忿、血氣之勇所能濟事、更不是喊口號、貼標語所能爲力、日本此次之暴行、表面上的題目和政治的背景且不說、單就他們敢於出此論、突足憂心積慮、早有長時間的預備的、（昭和二年七月二十五日田中義一對满蒙積極政策奏槢講得很詳、他門處心積慮謀積極侵略满蒙還在併吞朝鮮之前、在他們原藉口什麽生存問題、說是日本的本部只有幾個大島、幾十個小島、而且常常有人力不可抗之地震、他們爲求安全計、固然不得不於大陸上求立脚點、而近十餘年來、日本人口激增、每年有剩餘之人口八十餘萬無處安揷、爲解决他們的人口問題、也不得不向大陸上求發展、大陸之最利便最把沃者爲他們之所謂满蒙、（包括東三省及内外蒙古、）但是满蒙終究是我國的满蒙、不是這種藉口所能辨護、其不正當的侵略的、他們竟憑這種絶不合理的藉口事實上着着進逼、一方面以朝鮮人爲先鋒、移殖满蒙以本部日人爲後盾移殖朝鮮、一方面則對於满蒙之政治經濟各種建設工作爲不遺餘力之經營、以謀遂其征服東亞征服世界（均田中語）之陰謀、在敎育方面、同時更灌輸其所謂满蒙政策於一般國民、特由帝國大學發表矢野的满蒙非支那領土的謬論、以鼓惑其人民之進取心、（在日本無論中小學生、若問其日本之版圖、他們必將满蒙算在裏面、有人說及满蒙問題、他們都有敵概同仇之慨、此爲作者去年在日本所親歷的事實）歴來不過因我東三省之當局麻木不仁、任其宰割、所以不曾有什麽暴行、近因我東北人士、鑒於他們對於政治經濟侵略進展之猛、鑒於亡國之禍迨在眉睫、志而爲實力的抵禦、奉海造路與葫蘆島築港成功、大概就是他們不能不急急暴露其野心的動因、有此動因、遂不暇顧賑災恤鄰的道義、趁我國天災正烈的時候、而出此横暴的舉動、</p>
<p>從上面看來、我們可知道日本之圖謀我满蒙不是偶然的、是處心積慮有長時間的預備的、至於所以招致他們來謀我满蒙的大原因、那什麽日本部地理上之缺陷、與人口問題之無法解决等等、都是哄遍世界各國的一種藉口、實在還是由於我國對於满蒙太不重視、太不經營、所謂空穴風來者是也、</p>
<p>我們知道日本之侵略我满蒙是處心積慮的心、而侵略的進行又是有長期的預備的、則我們的對付、也絶不可視爲偶然的問題、而當着作永久的事情、</p>
<p>在這種大難當前的時候、凡屬國民都會感着極大的興奮、而青年血氣方剛、盛奮尤甚、若無適當的指導、却不免民氣誤用、於事無補、我們現在所需要的是有組織有計劃的步驟、能持久能内蓄的精神、而不是五分鐘熱度的經率舉動、因此我對於敎育界的諸君、要貢獻下列幾種芻蕘之見、</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。今天不是舊俗所謂中秋節麽。「月到中秋分外明」。是如何的美满。然而我希望今夜的月。不要再圓不要再明了。怕它照見我們東北方的膏腴之府。那莊嚴燦爛的青天白日旗那裏去了。却換上了一面面血染似的紅日旗。那大中華民國數十萬執干戈而衞社稷的大軍又那裏去了。却換上了一箇箇惡麽似的矮子兵。唉。不堪回首故國月明中。月兒月兒。你今夜不要再圓。不要再明了。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>傅將軍到那裏去了？</h3>
<p>民國十六年十一月二十八日我對全體同志演講涿州守將傅作義，今日在日記中，翻得如下之紀錄··</p>
<p>「傅作義以數千人死守涿州，迄今四十餘天，奉軍數萬人，竟撼他不動。他不管　革命軍人之青率·中就是入國國民之模範。他有位老師，名呌于國翰，現在奉軍裏面任職，來信勸他投降，他回信說：「記得老師講義中並無投降之一課。」我願全體同志牢記此語：········我們要有藝術的生，藝術的死。涿州之守，已達到藝術之境界。我深願救兵趕去解圍，爲中華民國留此一位良將，好在世界戰塲上與帝國主義者算帳。傅軍是當得起我們的不投降歌了！我們大家起立唱這首歌吧，心裏向涿州的勇士們致敬着：</p>
<p>「軍人救國不要命。</p>
<p>不要命，不要命，</p>
<p>只有斷頭將軍，</p>
<p>没有投降將軍。</p>
<p>軍人救國不要命。</p>
<p>不要命，不要命，</p>
<p>只有斷頭兵丁，</p>
<p>没有投降兵丁。」」</p>
<p>東三省之守將，人人是傅作義則東三省必不亡。中華民國之守將，人人是傅作義則中華民國必不亡。東三省之傅作義安在？中華民國之傅作義安在？</p>
<h3>譬如</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>譬如昨日死。今我已爲鬼。靈魂雖有知。動作不由己。眼見家人哭。勸之皆弗理。原來形氣間。竟爾隔膜矣。我維有所言。何能入其耳。徒令傷我心。豈有益於彼。不如不問訊。不如不啓齒。開我東閣門。坐我舊時椅。翻我故人書。纍纍已盈笥。遠則三月前。近則十日裏。彷彿隔世人。來讀廿五史。祇可信手拈。聊復頓首啓。所苦人不知。未請鬼書記。耗我有限神。屈我無名指。熄盡雁足燈。寫盡蠅頭字。呼僮不肯　。誰爲付郵寄。縱令寄與君。亦祗一張紙。鬼字不可見。思之亦無謂。因念世間事。無論鉅與細。各到没奈何。只可聽之已。我今老且病。筋力已衰敝。我徒爲人忙。誰則爲我替。我不求功名。我不貪貨利。何苦作馬牛。何事受驅使。遠問親與朋。近問妻與子。僉曰爾自愚。誰强爾爲此。因而得一解。譬如昨日死。</p>
<h3>記痛挫日人之李二</h3>
<p>— 印瘦曼</p>
<p>清光緒間南通金沙鄉。有無賴李二者。少即猛勇。十餘歲時。嘗盜米五斗。負之疾行數十里。追者不能及。及壯。能迎拒奔牛。人咸驚爲神力。李亦自恃其勇。倔强倨傲。目空一世。一日。偶因細故與鄰某相鬥。某被創致死。鄰控於有司。弋捕甚急。李乃亡命滬上。日與匪徒爲伍。刦殺勒索。無所不爲。匪衆見其剽悍。乃奉之爲首領。斯時正值日俄戰後。滬上日僑。以其戰勝之淫威。囂張益甚。華人遭其凌辱者。日必數起。官廳　頇。不敢抗議。李睹狀憤甚。屢思有以懲之。一日。因事過吳淞路。見四五日人。圍一青年華婦恣意笑謔婦窘急萬狀。俯首欲泣。李大怒。飛步向前。奮臂一掃。二人已仆於丈外。餘知不敵。乃大呼求援。日人聞聲而至者數十人。李獨力應戰。不稍懼怯。未幾。日人咸負創而退。李乃從容緩步而去。日人無敢追者。事後。日人與我國官廳交涉。我方頻致歉意。始寢其事。而日人銜李之心。未嘗稍懈。無何。李卒被狙擊於英租界之僻巷中。傷及要害而死。噫。按李氏一生。作惡多端。死何足惜。惟其見義勇爲。痛挫日人之壯舉。亦未可没也。爰爲之記。</p>
<h3>記一件關於月餅的趣事</h3>
<p>— 斅厂</p>
<p>昨天戚家送了一盒月餅來。我吃了之後。忽記起一件關於月餅的趣事來。現在把它紀在下面。</p>
<p>杭縣瓶窰。當二十多年前。有一家大南貨肆。是兼售糕餅的。而店中的夥友們。都很傲慢。所以常常和主顧發生口角。一天有住在離瓶窰五里許的鄉人某甲。拿了制錢四十文。去到該店買白糖。而此四十文制錢之中。有一個是沙壳子。該店夥向甲掉換。甲因身畔没有零星錢。所以懇求店夥幫幫忙。店夥執意不允。甲便怒冲冲的掏出一塊大洋來呌店夥找。店夥竟找給他。甲懷恨在心。便想報復。這時。是陰曆七月底。正月餅上市的當兒。一天。甲在茶館中對人說道。我前天晩上臨睡的時候。吃了一個某店（指掉沙壳這家）出品的月餅。到了半夜裏。忽然肚痛起來。漸痛漸烈。繼之以吐瀉。一直閙到天亮。才慢慢兒好起來。我想總是吃了這個月餅之故。但月餅我是常常吃的。從來没有吃出過毛病。爲甚麽這月餅吃了會發生腹痛吐瀉呢。所以我很懷疑。便出來偵查它的原故。好了。今天居然被我查出來了。原來該店做月餅的猪油甏裏。不知幾時淹死了一隻小猫。而且這猫死了多日了。因爲這甏猪油辦了來。還没有用過。前幾天正要用他。揭開甏蓋來。才知道有貓死在那裏。而猫已腐化得不堪了。糕餅作頭恐被經理知道而聽他的琴棋書。因之便悄悄的把死貓撈去。甏裏的猪油仍用以做月餅。我吃的月餅。正是用死過貓的猪油做的。我查悉這事後不由得惶恐萬分。原來吾人聞了死貓的氣息。就要患癩痲風的。何况吃了沾着死貓血肉的東西呢。所以我如若單單像前晩那樣腹痛吐瀉。而後不發生别的毛病。那是不幸中之大幸了。甲說完。聽者都大驚失色。。於是一人傅十人。十人傳百人。不到幾天。遠近的人都知道了。不消說。知道這事人們。都不約而同的不到該店去買月餅了。可是該店竟莫明其妙。前幾天生意退减。以爲這是偶然的事。從中秋前一星期起。仍照上年老例日夜的趕製月餅。以備節邊大批出銷。那知到了節邊。月餅的銷塲。祗及上年十之一二。因之節後月餅多得满橱满櫃。經濟名譽。都遭損失。該店經理懊喪異常。多方調查。才知半月前店夥因向某甲掉換一個沙壳子。甲爲報復</p>
<h3>蘇俄社會的一斑（上）</h3>
<p>— 張韵斐</p>
<p>本篇作者爲復克回去。VincentVocovich旅居蘇俄有年。服務政界。對於蘇俄社會上一切形形色色。頗多心得。故是篇頗多旁人所不及處。想亦爲注意蘇俄之國人所樂聞乎。譯者識　　無論誰假說他是熟悉蘇俄的生活情形的。他總會感覺到居民住屋的缺少。因着工業的速進與新社會哲學的輪入。俄國的家庭生活就起了大變化。但這個變化並不曾給我民生活上的進步。</p>
<p>從前是一家住的居屋。現在却變成了數家的睡房。每一住屋内。有一個摩登化的厨房。和一個公共的浴室。這廚房也是公共的。每家都在内用着新式的油爐烹飪。浴室是常常顚倒不潔。所以住在這屋中的人。往往幾個月不沐浴。總不會想到用這個公共的浴室。當着極長的冬季。這居家過多的住屋中。窗總是牢關着。室内的空氣當然很淤塞。加之住在這屋中的人家。都彼此不能信任的。所以一切食物。都藏在這又當食堂又當客室的臥房内。因此這歐化的蘇俄家庭中。充满了食物的氣味。油爐的烟霧。小兒的哭聲。破布。壞具。</p>
<p>蘇俄的共産政府。創設一個「家庭執政會」。專門帮助俄民整家。再有其他各種的會。以引導俄民敎育衞生爲目的。差不多每個會都是共産黨的黨員爲領袖。每月聚會一次。開會時。有關於生理衞生的演說。極少數的居民。是歡喜加入這種聚會。去聽那種呆滯乏味的敎育演說。縱然用着强迫手段。去壓令居民赴會。但結果還是無效。所以這幾個會。在他們每年的工作報告書中。總有只满含失望的一句。「無人注意敎育工作。奈何。」</p>
<p>社會的變化。使蘇俄的女子負有一種新的法律上和道德上的責任。現在每個女子應與男子分任養家。算是伊們得到自由平等應付的代價。俄國的工廠。壙塲。市肆。辦公室中。充满了女子。大約在政府所設的工業中。有百分之四是女子。</p>
<p>倘然一個工廠中的女工結婚了。伊在清晨須當心撫育幼孩。當伊在廠内工作時。就將幼孩放在育嬰室中。一天的工作完畢。就帶同小孩回家。再靜心地餒食物給他們吃。倘然一個女子忍不住這樣苦工。而生病了。那麽伊可以免費的向公衆醫院診治。每一個女子必定須工作。否則伊將餓死。因爲俄國的男子是嗜酒不顧家庭的。加之從一九一切年以來。男子們大都因受不住剌激。不幸而生病。而老死。</p>
<p>每個家庭中的女孩子成人以後。必須出外工作。因爲父親所賺的錢。不能再供給伊們。成羣的没有家庭的女子們。丨丨被丈夫離棄的婦人。孤兒。和工人的女兒。丨丨都聚集在工廠門口尋工作。廚房内或臥室的一角。就是這般可憐女子一日工作後的休息地。早婚是解决伊們困難情形的唯一辦法。</p>
<p>起見。遂揑造上面的事實。而且大事宣傳所致。古人說。衆口鑠金。金看了上述的事而益信了。</p>

<h3>丈夫的妻子（廿四）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>在外國人夫婦都有職業，互相分擔着家庭的經濟，是常有的事：並且夫婦是格外的愛好。不知什麽緣故，中國人便不能這樣子，妻子有了職業，往往可以使夫婦逐漸的冷淡與隔膜。而事實上，中國已嫁丈夫的妻子，在外面做事，一小半是境况拮据的關係，一大半却因夫婦感情不十分好，才這樣的。李夫人到中華物産公司去當文牘，便是一個例子。伊對於這一件職務，是很勝任，並且坐在陳先生的對面寫字檯，遇到稍涉疑難的事，便由陳先生指導了做，或竟由陳先生代做了。早上一塊兒上公司，晩上又一塊兒回家，一般人都以爲他們是一對很愛好的夫婦：但是李夫人與李先生，却一天一天的冷淡了，他們常常會兩三天不相交談，和生人一般，</p>
<p>兩個月之後，陳夫人忽然變了態度，整天的不出大門，家事也管得有條有理，對於陳先生身上的事，什麽都很關心，有說有笑，眞是一個很好的婦人了。陳先生十分欣喜，他以爲妻子已收了心，不再和以前一樣的胡閙了，他自己很僥倖，覺得幸而自己有克制心，不曾和李夫人發生肉體的關係，否則如何對得起自己的妻子，如何把兩件絶對衝突的畸角安置穩妥；現在他自己很得了家庭裏的安慰，對於李夫人，只能逐漸停止戀愛的施施射與接受，只有一種自己抱歉的情緒，可憐着李夫人的命運，是這樣不幸。陳夫人已屢次拒絶李先生的約會：並且連談話都很少了。陳先生在疑心伊或者爲了什麽事情，已和李先生反目，才有這樣結果，他覺得應該好好地温慰着伊，不要使機會錯過，可以使伊覺悟到愛情與諒解的基礎，只有眞正的夫婦，才很穩妥，才有價舉。從這一次起，使伊不再變心，不再爲任何男子所誘引；同時或者可以感動了李先生與李夫人，也迴黄轉綠的和好如初。</p>
<p>他們的情形，許多朋友之中，是早已知道了。起初也只譏笑着他們是「易妻而愛：」現在却有人反在咒駡着陳先生是居心叵測，因爲李夫人依舊在中華物産公司當文牘，每天和陳先生依舊是同出同進。一般人不曾知道陳先生已在克制自己，不再愛李夫人，並且竭力减少和伊談話的機會。他們因爲同居在一宅屋子裏，同一地點辦事，同出同進，不是一件過意凑成的事情，更不能指爲一件罪惡，但是一般人反不諒解他們了。</p>

<p>市塲概况　昨日因銀行與各埠、均有賣出及來滬關係、致厘價突然隳落、較前日午市驟小一厘有半、人心略見安定至於銀根鬆緊時舉時止、照前晩小總會形勢、似有平和希望、而昨午之狀况、又見緊張、可見尚未人於坦途、當此金融紊亂之際、雅不欲妄加月旦耳、</p>
<p>釐拆價格　（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢二分五厘半、午市爲七錢二分五厘、結果較前日午市遽跌厘半之巨、（銀拆）早市三錢五分、午市最高到過四錢、而收盤則爲三錢八分、銀行掛牌一錢四分、劃頭加水三錢六七分、中途亦到過四錢以外、銀根形勢、一時尚難轉機、</p>

<h3>債市隨人心轉安</h3>
<p>趨勢呈緩和漲跌參差</p>
<p>本月期停拍準備交割</p>
<p>今日秋節停市</p>
<p>此次本埠證券市面以受種種影響、起空前未有之大變化、使非有前日之挽回頺勢、則前途實不堪設想、茲幸危險時期已過、中交中央押欵之議已定、而我國在外交方面、亦得相當成績、非復如前之險惡萬狀、市上人心、隨而大定、價乃紛紛回漲、觀昨日情勢、已大見緩和、晨初趨勢續挺、次盤雖會一度較疫、下午則乃行回漲、結果比前日如二○捲裁兵等均續漲一數角、其他互有漲跌爲數不大、下週之交割、不患另有問題矣、又昨日交易所方面對於九月期各債劵已行停拍、藉以辦理交割前各項手續、昨先行劃帳、下星期二實行交割、今日因中秋停市、查昨日現貨惟七年騙遣共成交五千元、期貨上午一千零五十餘萬、下午六百餘萬元、合計一千六百六十餘萬元、</p>

<h3>棉紗市氣高騰</h3>
<p>買氣濃厚···現貨奇缺</p>
<p>紗市晨跌午漲、且形勢異常緊張、實以各廠現貨均被各帮搜羅殆盡、根子大缺、且有一部份廠家、二月以後之貨、業已賣空、而反日空氣十分濃厚、因之市氣騰高、賣戶稀少、所以前途、仍有漲風發現也、</p>
<p>人標近跌遠漲　交易所人標前市開盤、因外棉趨跌、人氣平平、各月跌五·六·九錢、午後以各方消息利於多頭、於是買氣大俏、各月均漲二兩二錢至三兩五錢、成交統計前市二萬五千六百包、午後不及記載、查賣出賡豐一千九百包、天降八百五十包同興一千二百包、長豐一千四百包、愼昌五百五十包、買進和愼一千三百五十包、瑞大二千二百包、恒德二千包、信誠千零五十包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市新抛蠭起</h3>
<p>棉市轉疲跌風異常劇烈、美棉不振、銀價日見放長、且印棉售價極其廉宜一申新廠購進一萬件、阿古拉二十八兩五錢、勃洛去三十二兩、因之人心驟虚新抛戶又蜂擁而來、且日廠有停工之說、如果實現、原料需用當然减少也、且世界經濟狀况大亂、棉市更難安定云、</p>

<h3>外紗花漲跌各異</h3>

<p>糧食　陳蘆洋尖回落四角</p>
<p>南頭　昨日各帮來源略有、晨間細雨濛濛、城鄉店銷零星、故市氣懈淡、惟售性欠鬆、厚粳行情仍告落定、薄稻到積不多、寗銷呆滯、本街似緣新貨續到、市價又見疲挫、陳蘆洋尖、貨雖寥寥、買客均抱殺價、竟跌四五角不等、糯米貨稀尚挺、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日天雨連綿、内地到貨有限、趨勢一蹶不振、常錫北粳、提高殺次、新粳亦因來貨轉寥、胃納尚佳、價見增硬、無錫新貨見樣、昨到二筒、計一百五六十石、米品頗佳、價開十六元、新虚洋尖陸續見抵、銷路並不發動、市歸軟態、角里交白尖因貨零星、稍見盤起、洋米現銷徽細、期貨略化、市勢隨金價復漲、尚屬堅硬、明日爲廢歷秋節、南北二市一律停斛、結束歸賬之期、無市報告、</p>
<h3>期小絞有大批新交易</h3>
<p>七千五百噸···行情立見狂小</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、期貨有洋行中大批抛售、市面大起變化、惟現貨在上午成交、尚未受到影響、但交易不多、共計祇開小絞五百包、價十二元二角、由本街辦去、期貨有天祥洋行大抛特抛、其他洋行亦有跟出、近期及回籠貨立小二錢左右、天祥抛出小絞二三月份四千噸價五兩七錢、又出十一月份二千噸、價五兩五錢半、寶隆十月份七百噸、價五兩半、炳昌出十月份七百噸價五兩五錢半、均係英華司交易、回籠貨則有十月份五百噸、價五兩半、五兩五錢半不等、此大批成交後、市上人心甚軟此後現貨及回籠期貨均有看疲之象云、</p>
<h3>近期粉多頭自動回出</h3>
<p>尗跌一分餘</p>
<p>昨日粉市開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈近跌遠穩之象、本月份因距交割已近、且須停市二天、各大廠家、以實銷沉寂異常、北方因日人之暴行瀰漫、當然停裝、所以放棄維持、任其上落、因此多頭地位愈絶、復以將近交割、不得不步步自動回出、故下午最低至二兩零三分、開幾月來未見之紀錄、遠期各月份因外行仍不放壞、陸續套進、市氣反略見良好、結果本月份較前日跌一分二厘半、十月份跌七厘半、十一·十二月份好二厘半、一·二月份好五厘云、</p>
<h3>本月麥慘跌一錢八分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、本月份因係最後一天、過此即須交割、以供求間之形勢懸殊、致發生稀有之暴跌、上午開價尚在六錢六七分、收市亦無大出入、迨至下午、因收貨者仍少、廠家存碼甚厚、無意問津因此多方急不暇擇、紛紛急出、因此逐開逐落、暴跌不已、晨低竟跌小至三兩五錢一分、較前日差至一錢九分之巨、此種紀錄、不特前所未聞、實爲做多者所想不到也、遠期因業外仍不甘心、依然擯住不小、結果本月份較前日跌一錢八分、十月份跌二分、十一·十二月份不動、一月份好二分二月份好一分云、</p>
<p>南北貨　新興化圓成本達百兩</p>
<p>興化桂圓今庚因收成大歡、市價高昻、爲歴年來所未有、聞首批新貨已由地頭裝出大約今明日可以告抵、據業中人云、頂上正牌正二每担成本竟達百兩以上、較之往年市價差度幾及一半、誠罕聞也、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>英鋼板靜極思動</h3>
<p>昨日五金交易、異常混沌、蓋北路如東三省生意、大有停頓之勢、天津帮昨呈活潑氣象、故對於英鋼板買賣、十分起勁因此被其購去七八百担之多、故萎靡不振之市面、昨日頓有靜極思動之概、價則二釐半估八兩二錢半、半分六錢五錢、七釐半六兩二錢半、一分五兩七錢半、漢口生意、昨日仍無起色、　以水退地方仍覺不靖也、福建帮自萬象輪出口後、故無傭辦、内河諸帮則因節關伊過故乏收進胃口、本街交易、昨市亦覺冷落至於其他五金類、除四十八張美白鐵漲二錢半、售十八兩七錢半外、别市無軒輊云</p>
<p>絲茶　洋莊絲市仍無生氣</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無生氣、查日絲在海外市塲廉價競銷益力、而歐美各綢廠、因綢銷疲滯、匯市變動仍劇、生絲仍無淮胃、絲電不轉、市氣蕭條、昨祖新時昌進白乾經十包、信孚進川黄摇經五包、價均平疲云、</p>
<h3>魯絲頭來源告阻</h3>
<p>魚省所産黄白絲頭　如挽手長吐索子等盛銷歐美各莊、茲因暴日襲擊東省、致烟台安東　産地備受蹂躪、製絲工塲、相繼停工、運輸艱阻、市面無形停頓、魯絲頭來源均告停阻云、</p>
<h3>路莊貢熙俄銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊貢熙綠茶、俄國協助會搜買仍不盡餘力、惟　盤較前見苛、華商不願賤售、珍眉珠茶等項、英銷依然不振、路莊平水大帮、美銷亦頗呆滯、惟華商均以來源斷絶存底枯薄、人心一致堅挺云、</p>
<p>雜訊　人造絲八百七十五件、意國運來、</p>

<p>全國路市會議專號</p>
<h3>路市會議開幕豪</h3>
<p>道路協會成立於民國十年。至今適爲十年。此十載中。全國道路。有長足之進展。方會之初立也。全國已成之路。僅一千五百英里。迄於今日。已成之路。激增至三萬五千英里。夫以吾國幅𢄙之廣大。此三萬五千英里之道路。誠未能自詡爲已足。然而在此過去之十年中。禍亂相尋。財力艱窘。凡百建設。莫不停頓。而舉國上下。於造路之努力。未嘗或懈。乃有此成績。吾人於欣慰之餘。表彰功績。竊不得不歸之於道路協會也。</p>
<p>今者路市會議。集會海上。而舉世震駭之暴日進兵事件。適於斯時發生。吾人悲憤之餘。相約同赴國難。似更無餘暇。以矚目於路市會議。然而試深思之。使在十年二十年甚至三十年以前。國人稍稍注意於邊疆問題。建築其道路。啓闢其富源。則今日之遼吉。或不致任人如是其蹂躙也。此次會議。於全國路政之如何推進。都市事業之如何革新。車輛器械之如何製造。路市專材之如何培植。汽油材料之如何採取。該會於宣言中。已備述其使命之重大。將一一加以討論。務使其適應時代之需求。補救過去之損失。吾人鑒於道咯協會旣往之成功。對於此次會議。其期望之切。自更不待言。道路之伸長。即文化之進展。交通爲國家命脈。與會諸君。早喻斯旨。必有良謨。足以昭示吾人也。</p>
<p>對於全國</p>
<h3>路市會議之希望李直青</h3>
<p>中華全國道路建設協會。此次舉行全國路市展覽大會三星期。並特定第二星期起。舉行全國路市會議一星期。其目的蓋欲乘此機會。集各省代表於一堂。公開討論。爲全國一切路市問題。謀整個的解决也。</p>
<p>一星期來。各省出席代表。所通過重要提案。多凡三十餘件。若合其他次要提案而計之。猶不止此數。於此可見各省當局之重視路市建設。已非十年前中華全國道路建設協會創辦時。所可同日而語。則此後我國路市建設之改進。當亦非過去十年中所可比並也。</p>
<p>記者於路市建設。素無研究。本不敢有所論列。顧二星期來。出入會塲。耳目所及。不無感想。茲將個人希望三點。與各省代表一商榷之。</p>
<p>一曰銜接道路　據道路月刋調查。全國目下已有道路十萬餘里。但據曾旅行國内各地之人言。則兩省間道路。往往有不相銜接者。甚至兩縣間道路亦然。行旅至此。仍非改乘驉馬肩輿小車。或坐船繞過而行不可。然則凡此已成之道路。人民受其實惠者。不限於一縣。即限於一省。不限於一省。至多亦不出鄰近數省之範圍。以此論之。謂中國某縣某縣已有道路若千里。可說也。謂中國某省某省已有道路若千里。亦可說也。若謂中國已有道路十萬餘里。則非先銜接已成各路不可。否則交通局限於一方。就國而論。未成通行大道。又安得謂爲中國已有道路十萬餘里乎。希望各省代表。今後於提倡築路時。於此點加之意焉。</p>
<p>二曰自造汽車　我國現有汽車二萬七千餘輛。完全購自外國。此次路市展覽會中。民然有一輛國産運貨車。爲國人一吐其氣。可喜也。該車係遼寗迫擊砲廠附設民生工廠出品。除引擎車胎及電氣裝置暫用舶來品外。其餘機件。均由廠方製造。載重四千磅。最高速度每小時四十哩。據云從本月起。每月即可造二噸運貨車十輛。三噸運貨車五輛。總計十五輛。乃不幸於本月十八瀋陽失陷之夜。盡燬於暴日砲火之下。遂使我中國唯一之汽車廠。如曇花之一現。傷哉。希望各省出席代表。於返省後。續成民生廠未竟之志。就地創建汽車廠。盡量發展。我一國汽車業之成功。實利賴之。</p>
<p>三曰自煉汽車　目下全國每年消耗汽油在二萬萬加侖以上。即以每加侖一元計。已值二萬萬元以上。且勿論此巨額之漏巵。萬一來源斷絶。立刻可致我二萬七千餘輛汽車於死命。危險孰甚。此次陜西省政府所陳列之各種柴油。雖去提煉汽油之程度尚遠。但能下一决心。繼續研究。繼續試騐。必有成功之一日。且以中國之大。産油者當不止陜西一省。希望諸代表今後返省。實地考察。竭力提倡。則數年之後。我中國不特有大批自製汽車。抑且有自煉汽油。供給自造汽車之用矣。</p>

<h3>議决各案一覽</h3>
<p>（一）設立道路及其他項建築材料製造廠及試騐廠案。（天津市政府提）爲提議事。查我國道路及其他項建築材料。多自外來。每年漏巵。何止千萬。我國地大物博。何物無有。人口之衆。何事不得進行。徒以諸事就易避難。改造乏人。以致困難環生。利權外溢。長此以往。不知伊於胡底。茲爲救濟已往弊端計。僅就道路及其他各項建築材料論。極宜於交通便利及物品出産地。設立材料製造廠及試騐廠。從價格至鉅。房地捐之征收。理有回　。一九二一年時。日本東京之土地税。只佔全數收入二十分之一。復興以來。亦漸取房地税爲基本甫税。吾國廣州嘗樹興辦市政之先聲。民國十年度。該市財政收入狀况。以房地捐爲大宗。佔三分之一有强。然而此種現象。在國内其他各市。並不普通。各市對於房捐。雖有徵收。而對於土地税。尚少注意。值茲建設經費支絀之時。爰提議整頓房捐。興辦土地税。確定此項收入爲各市基本市税。永遠作爲市政物質建設專欵。不得移作别用。是否可行。敬希公决。</p>
<p>（三）鼓勵工業離中與園市運動案。（天津市府提）爲提議事。查人口城市化。爲近代各國普遍之趨勢。城市人口過分增加之結果。晩近復有謂園市及工業離中運動者。以作相當之調劑。市内人口。日見增加。交通住居等問題。日趨複雜。土地價格。亦必日見增高。工業離中運動。即將工廠移設市外近郊的一種運動。俾市内可以免去機聲煤烟之苦。同時市内人口密度。亦可减少。交通住居等問題。亦較易解决。工業移設市外。對於工業本身。亦有利益。市外土地必較市内爲廉。工廠成本可以減低。即工廠設在市内。其倉庫堆棧等。亦多設在地價較廉之處。每</p>
<h3>大會開幕宣言</h3>
<p>孫總理有言。「民國開剏以來。旣經非常之破壞。而無非常之建設以繼之。此所以禍亂相尋。江河日下。武人專横。政客搗亂。而無法收拾也。蓋此非常之時。必須有非常之建設。乃足以使人民之耳目一新。與國更始也。」當此訓政時期。又值外寇日深。災荒遍野之際。全國民衆久在顚沛流離之中。渴望普遍建設之能早日實現。彌補非常破壞之缺憾。救濟全部民生之憔悴。吾人服膺總理遺敎。從事路市建設事業。處茲時會。應如何振奮精神。羣策羣力。充分貢獻於經濟的建設事業上。使能表現良好之成績。而立憲政時期之基礎。况中央依據總理遺敎。訓政時期。定爲六年。地方自治之基礎工作。舉凡清查戶口。設立機關。評定地價。修治道路。墾殖荒地。剏辦學校。須於民國廿四年以前完成之。在此短促時間。惟有相與戮力。始能克奏膚功。天職所在。詎容卸厥仔肩乎。建設首要。在於民生。我總理遺著之建國方略。建國大綱。對於程序節目。早有詳明之規定。而國道路線網市政法規。亦經主管機關。先後訂定公布。年來各省市多已努力實施。成績日著。自茲以往。只須全國一致。分工合作。即不難完成百萬英里之道路。與促進都市之繁榮。解除民生之疾苦。</p>
<p>惟是路市兩政。千頭萬緒。設計規劃。日新月異。因而中華全國道路建設協會。十週年紀念。遂有全國路市會議之召集。對於全國路政之如何推進。都市事業之如何革新。車輛器械之如何製造。路市專材之如何培植。汽油材料之如何採取。方能適應時勢之需求。補救過去之損失。皆屬目前亟需解决之重要問題。本會議受各省市之重託。民衆之期望。自當愼密審訂。悉心研討。以貢獻於全國建設界之實施採擇。成爲更切實際建設之優良途徑。淮是而言。則此次之全國路市會議所負之使命及其旨趣。是最有意義者。明矣。坐而言。起而行。爲吾人共同之鵠的。不畏難。不苟安。爲吾人服務之鐵律。本此意義。努力實行。一息尚存。此志不懈。决不蹈埃及安南朝鮮印度。不自築路。讓人代築。卒至滅亡之覆轍。吾人深信會議結果而後。必使陸上交通逐漸普遍完成。市政事業。慘淡經營。蒸蒸日上。三民主義成爲實際之社會組織與國家建築。然後人民始有榮利之幸福。蒙荒利源。乃有開發之機會。遠東西藏。斯有澈底挽救之可能。今者會議開始。謹此宣言。建設同志幸錫敎焉。中華全國第一次路市會議大會。</p>
<p>事籌劃。以挽利權。而富國家。唐山啓新公司之洋灰。頗著成效。瀝青油料。我國非無出品。只以品質不良。省有採用。徵之以上兩例。設廠建造試騐。當不可稍待也。所擬是否有當。敬請公决。</p>
<p>（二）整頓房捐。興辦土地税。確定此項收入。爲市政物質建設專欵案。（天津市政府河南建設廳提）查都市行政。首重物質建設。而物質建設之能否圓满進行。則視乎建設費之盈絀。考諸國内各市財政狀况。大都用於行政費成分較多。而建設費之分配。不過百分之二十。此與歐美各國市財政分配之原則。所謂事業費超過行政費者兩相比較。適得其反。於此種財政現象之下。欲求都市物質建設之着着進展殆不啻責巧婦以無米之炊。故深知吾國一般市政建設之不振。全由於建設經費之未確定。而建設經費之所以未確定者。則不外市財政之因陋就簡。無畫一之税則。良好之財源。以突破量入爲出之市財政常况耳。爲今之計。惟有首先確立基本市税。爲市財政别闢一良好財源。則建設經費另具基礎。不致再受行政費之影響。而綽綽乎有餘裕矣。按近代歐美各國都市之市税。例以房地捐爲大宗。其故蓋因近代市政建設。影響於市内土地年所費之運費。合計之亦頗可觀。如能在市外設置工廠。則工廠與堆棧。可以設在一處。轉運費可以减省不少。國外各市近來極力提倡工業離中者。蓋以此也。國内各地工業革命。甫見端倪。正可利用外人此項經騐。於市内工廠尚未林立之時。設法鼓勵將工廠設置於市外近郊地方。則因工廠而發生之多數市政問題。可以迎刃而解矣。惟同時復須注意下列各點。</p>
<p>（一）所謂工業離中。並非指所有工業。均不許在市内設置。因有數種工業。因其性質特殊。非設在市内不可。大略言之。小工業輕工業以及含有地方性之工業。勢必設置於市内。而大工業及笨重工業。則類可設於市外。</p>
<p>（二）工業離中運動。應與住宅離中運動。同時並進。否則市内之交通住居等問題仍難解决。假使工廠設在市外。而在市外工廠工作之工人。因在工廠附近無適當之住宅。勢必仍寄寓於市中。故建設市外工廠時。對於工人住宅問題。必須預爲籌劃。以免困難。</p>
<p>（三）提倡工業住宅之離中運動時。尤應顧及全市道路系統。交通利器。夫如是則市内外可以打成一片。不致有所隔膜。蓋工業住宅設在市外。實爲市之附庸。非能離市而獨存也。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>至於園市運動。則較之工業住宅離中之意義尤爲重大。蓋園市運動不特可以解决定内之擁擠。俾市民可以稍享田野生活。且採取合作社之精神公有土地。使不勞而獲之土地。增益分配於本市。而不致爲少數資本家所獨佔把持。國内各地。年來亦曾有大市近郊或鄉間組織新市之聲浪。惜乎或因蕉苻遍地。礙難進行。或因設計不良。中途停頓。爰提議對於工業離中與園市運動。應由政府設法鼓勵提倡。庶可早日實現焉。是否有當。敬乞公决。（四）救濟都市失業問題案。（杭州市政府提）都市失業問題。在近日頗爲嚴重。如上海南京北平漢口杭州廣州等處。都市失業者之數量。據社會局調查。皆逐年增加。都市當局於救濟事業責任。實至綦重。謹將管見所及。提出救濟辦法如次。（甲）積極方面。都市救濟事業。非簡單問題也。純粹工業化之都市。宜如何發展工商業。以預防市民之失業。農産物品衆多之都市。宜如何改良農業。以達到收獲量之增加與預防災害。工商業與農業並重之都市。宜如何使農工商業有同時之發展。以免單一方面因凋落受絶大之影響。考我國以農立國。而都市間人爲工商業中心。故救濟事業。非僅單一斟酌損益。完全因地制宜積極方面。所有救濟辦法。計共五項。（一）扶助都市工商業發展。工商業之都市。其市民職業。大半爲工人及商店學徒小資本商人。此輩失業雖有許多原因。然大多數皆受外來資本家所打擊。如上海一地。即其明證。救濟方法。（一）宜厲行國家法令保護工商業發展。（二）積極提倡人民購用國貨。（二）努力造林運動。造林運動。爲總理遺訓及中央頒佈七項運動之一。不獨可以有益衞生。點綴風景且增加農産物品防止天災之力。尤爲偉大。近我國全部俱受水災。益見此項運動。不可一日遲緩。（三）提倡節約運動。節約運動。爲近來各國所積極提倡。歐洲大戰及日本地震後。人民皆節衣縮食。以圖生聚敎訓。我國都市人民。生活奢侈社會上之失業流離甚至自殺者。往往以前皆極端奢侈之人。與其將來之一飱一粥救濟。毋寗早日將節約運動多多提倡。庶失業者减少。亦可得節衣縮食之效。且近來水災如此重大。人民節約愛惜物力。尤所必須。此舉宜先後擴大宣傳。以引起全市民衆之注意。（四）創辦貧民工廠。貧民借貸處職工介紹所。右三項機關。完全爲失業救濟之生産機關。非若慈善性質之收容機關可比。其貧民工廠宜設立規模較大者。庶可以容納多數失業貧民。在增加生産數量。貧民借貸處宜按劃分之區域設立。庶免一人向許多地方借貸。及跋涉奔走之苦。（五）嚴厲取締高利借貸。高利借貸。盤剥貧民。未失業者。偶因負債。飲鴆自甘。漫久漸漸能因之貧困。失業者更無論矣。我國法令。雖曾取締。而禁者自禁。營利者自營利如故。此層市當局宜嚴加取締。（乙）消極方面。消極方面救濟辦法之可舉者。計分三項。（一）倡導賑濟。都有失業人口衆多。或災象已成時期。振濟爲不可緩。惟特殊情形之下。市收入方而。究竟有無一種固定經費。以備臨時救濟。誠一問題。譬如最近漢口市全市皆成澤國。受災人數。不可勝計。又京市水災。市民被淹者甚衆。京漢兩市。一爲政治中心。一爲工商業繁盛區域。而災情如此重大。市民失業者。當益加增。但兩市之救濟。尚在募捐籌賑之中。而募捐籌賑者之希望。仍大半在私人與國庫方面。可見消極之事業。緩不濟急。遠不如積極方面之之預先防範爲有效也。惟市政當局。須時時處於倡導地位。裏面效定能宏大。（二）設立收容所。此項機關。分臨時永久兩種。屬於水久者。如殘廢院。婦孺救濟所育嬰堂等類。屬於臨時者。如難民收容所之類。此種救濟事業。完全係收容性質。略如慈善團體舉辦之事。在臨時期間。收效尤大。（三）與慈善團體通力合作。我國慈善團體。如善堂紅萬字會等。向與政府不相聨絡。其每年事業之進行。頗有可觀。惟辦法紛歧。迷信觀念太重。是然弊病所在。市當局爲發展救濟事業計。宜極力加以整頓。通力合作。其辦法（一）規定各項塡報。令其來市府註册立案。以便詳加審查。（二）召集慈善團體負責人員談話。指示慈善事業之進行奧方針。並訂之各種規則章程。令其遵照。（三）取締迷心舉動。（四）訂立奬勵辦法。如此則私人慈善團體。可與公家救濟事業。獲得聨絡之效。失業者之受惠。誠非鮮淺。以上所述積極消極辦法。係就過去情形及目前現狀擬及。是否有當敬希公决。（五）擬請國民政府擬訂路市各種建築標準圖及做法案（天津市政府提）</p>
<p>爲提議事。查我國城市發達。最爲遲緩。各項建築。更屬幼稚。以致成績紊亂。依據毫無。長此以往。何日方得與各國並駕齊驅。爰請國民政府。擬訂市内道路溝渠渠橋樑河壩碼頭及各種房屋做法說明書。建築規範書等項。及說明其原理。如此則各大城市工程專家。得有參考。而鄉鎭僻壤之區。得有依據。所擬是否有當。敬請公决。</p>
<p>（六）請國民政府通令各級路市機關。聘用專家。組織採購委員會。負責主持對於行政事業兩方面之一切需用物品及印刷文件等之採購。以節經費案。（董脩甲提）</p>
<p>（七）設立路市專科學校培植路市專材案（湖北建設廳·漢口市政府·福建建設廳·濟南市政府·及專家程德諝同提）</p>
<p>（理由）吾國路市專門人材之缺乏。實爲阻碍路市發展之重要關鍵。前此國内路市工程敎育。爲數極少。且因設備不周。實習不勤。濫竽充數。成績至劣。學子無一枝之長。政府有材難之嘆。而主持路市兩政者。大批爲未能熟諳路市知識之人。對於城市與道路之設計。建築與材料之選擇。自不能審時度勢。通盤籌劃。使合乎科學的方法。其經濟的原則。此其結果影響於路市之進展者甚大。故宜積極創辦路市專科學校。培植路市專材。使與路市有關之管理建築製造之方面。皆得適宜的專門技術人員。使路市建設之結果。不致流於浪費與奢靡。茲擬辦法於次。（辦法）一·由中央籌撥的欵·創辦中央路市專科大學。創辦後經常費由國道或各省省道收入項下抽收若干成。每年一百二十萬元。二·路市專科大學。應分管理建築製造三科。管理科注意於路市兩政之管理。建築科注意路市建築之實施工程。製造科注意築路機械與運輸車輛之製造。三·路市專科大學。創辦五年後。國内路市機關。應儘先錄用該學學生。</p>
<p>（八）提倡市辦公用事業案（天津市政府提）爲提議事。查公共事業。如電車電燈自來水等項。與市民關係至爲密切。其重要自不待言。國内各市。情形不一。有由公家辦理。有由商人集股創辦者。甚有借材異地。借資外人者。雖各有其特殊情形。但凡係商辦者。查其設備。大都因陋就簡。不甚健全。蓋因其係營業性質。只知謀利對於市民之利益。殊鮮注意。反之如由官辦。自當以市民福利爲前提。故此項公共事業。仍應以收歸市辦爲原則。不特基於社會政策。適相符合。即就增加都市收入而觀。亦爲最良善之財源。英國都市收入。以是項公用事業之餘利占最多數。我國各市。正可倣照辦理。照此目標。遇有相當時機。努力以赴。務期完全達到收回市辦之目的。不但此項事業贏餘。有裨市帑。而市民亦可同沾樂利矣。是否可行。敬希公决。</p>
<p>（十）改良土路及渣石路面辦法案。（天津市政府提）爲提議事。查我國各市馬路。率爲土路渣石路或油路。土路自應急謀改善。而油路用料多爲舶來品。加以近年金貴銀賤。價格日見增高。各市財力。容有未違。難期普遍。維渣石路石路。尚覺簡便經濟。但每當天乾風起。塵土飛颺。旣礙交通。復害衞生。頗感不便。茲查有綠化鈣一種（即鹽滷）潑洒路面。可使路面潮濕。堅固少土。對於市内清潔。大有補益。毆美各國。多有採用者。成績甚佳。天津市按法試辦。亦著成效。且此項材料。凡鹽區均有。價亦甚廉。似可通知各處</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>照辦。簡易經濟。裨益路政。良非淺鮮。所擬是否有當。敬請公决。</p>
<p>（十一）由道路協會組織道路工程名詞審定委員會。從速審定道路工程名詞案。（楊哲明提）（理由）查近來國内出版物中。關於道路工程名詞的譯名。最不統一。故應從速審定。以期各項名詞的統一。</p>
<p>（十二）規定每年開全國路市會議一次。以交換專門知識及經騐案。（江蘇建設廳提）自道路工程復興以來。道路運輸。益覺繁要。工程法則亦日新月異以其在發展途中所有各方修治道路之專門學術及實地經騐。亟待搜集觀摩。以資促進。現在歐美各國。大抵均有精進也。我國築路事業。正在萌芽。其有待於吸收新知識鎔合各地經騐者。自無疑義。故組織全國路市會議年會。實屬切要之圖。擬規定按年在各省公會及重要都市。開路市會議一次。徵集各方面專門學術論著。并於開會地點。展覽各省築路材料及成績。共同研究。以及就地參觀公路實際工作。不僅予與會代表以交換智識之機會。且足以藉實地比較而增進各省工作之效率也。是否有當。敬候公决。</p>

<h3>非常</h3>
<p>— 陸湘</p>
<p>這實在是非常的一天、雖然初秋的太陽仍像往年一般的炎燥地射在單薄衣服的身上、白雲仍很閒散的安靜的輕揚在天空、可是、非常的事却終於在這平凡的一天發生了、</p>
<p>縱使在這草塲上足足有一千多人、然而、靜寂得却像中夜一般、丨不、中夜還有秋蟲的鳴聲、而這時却什麽聲音都没有、彼此都竭力止住着自己狂躍的熱心、連氣息都不使它大聲的喘、偶而回過頭、彼此的目光相接觸中、就交換了一個敖苦的示意、不過這示意却没有勇氣來持久、立刻把頭低下去、而胸前小方白布上的字跡、「團結精神、共濟國難、」又映進了眼簾、只得把視綫轉多在脚下軟綿綿的草地、上各個的面孔上都罩上了一層陰霾、但是、内心的燃燒和着炎陽的蒸曬却在這陰霾中反映出了特有的紅光、大家都是耐心地等待着、等待一個非常的會開始、</p>
<p>鐘聲曳着遼長的聲音響了、激蕩在靜靜的空氣中、若干個熱躍的心都不自禁的跟着這笨重的宏亮的鐘聲顫動起來鐘聲過了一會、我們的李校長和着秘書同了各學院的院長走上了台、在他們的面上、我們也可找到和我們同樣的一層陰霾、然而却没有我們年青人那樣的紅光、</p>
<p>行禮如儀後、爲了講台搭得並不高、後面矮一些的同學一定會被前面長一些的阻止了視綫、所以由軍事敎練的命令、大家都坐在天然的綠色地氈上、假使這是在平時、是多麽有趣味的一件事啊、丨這麽可愛的天氣、順着碧青的天蓋、坐在柔軟舒適的草地上、這麽多的人聚在一起、况且這些伴侣又都是同樣的年青、同樣的只知快樂、同樣的正在愛好生命和世界、但是、這畢竟是非常的一天、在這天的這情景中、没有一個人敢丨不、不是敢、是願意、丨没有一個人願意承認這是一個有趣味的快活的集會、</p>
<p>時間是一秒一分的過去、從上午九點鐘一直到下午一點鐘再過了些、不過、大家是興奮得忘了盤曲着麻痺的雙腿、忘了這炎陽下皮膚的灼痛、並且忘了早已過了吃午飯的時候、我們的血在狂流、心在燃燒、我們强遏止着的熱情只有乘台上講演者說話中止一會時拚命的鼓着手掌來發洩、我們目光中却流溢着難以自制的憤激的情緒、注視在台上聲嘶力竭青紅筋漲满的講演者、他們的句話、都使我們的熱血更沸燃起來、都緊緊地咬住了這般青年人語朴的熱剌剌的跳動着的心、</p>
<p>血儘管在流、心儘管在跳、而這嚴重的緊張的空氣中始終除了演講者激昻的聲音外什麽仍都是靜寂、没有一個人有勇氣輕咳一聲嗽來衝破這靜寂的空氣、甚至没有一棵樹敢發出大一些沙沙的聲音摇動它的樹葉、</p>
<p>台上一個個演講、當一陣掌聲送過了最後的一位最後的一句話時、主席就宣告呼口號、這立刻驚醒了一般醉聽着的青年、一個個離開了綠色的地氈立起來、高舉着右手、嘶聲的狂呼着口號、每個人遏止了半天的熱烈的情緒、這時都大膽地發洩出來、到了末一句、「中國人心不死」、更像奴潮般的狂吼、但狂吼後、却立刻又回復了方才的靜寂了、各人都低着頭懶懶地拖了自己的影子很寂寞地懷着無限的痛苦走進宿舍去、</p>

<h3>中國人移殖朝鮮的故事</h3>
<p>朱鴻禧</p>
<p>萬寳山案發生後、鮮人以憤怒之餘、毆我華僑、以致釀成前所未有的慘劇、這實是一件可悲可嘆的事情、按中國人移殖朝鮮、遠在三千年以前、史上所載𥬹子移居朝鮮的事蹟、實爲中國人移殖朝鮮之始、關於𥬹子移居朝鮮、其中有一段很有趣味的故事、現在且讓我將這故事寫出來、獻給愛讀故事的朋友、</p>
<p>𥬹子是一個殷代的人、他和紂王是親戚、他是一個很有學問的人、他的人格也是很高尚的、有一天、他去朝見紂王、他看到紂王的淫佚、心裏就很不快活、他想、要是紂王不痛改現在的驕奢淫佚的生活、那麽殷朝的天下也就難保了、于是他就竭力想方法去諫紂王、可是紂王不聽、結果、殷朝就亡在紂王的手裏、</p>
<p>殷亡後、殷的土地就爲周所有、自然、𥬹子是一個愛國的人、關於殷的滅亡、他是極感悲痛的、於是他就下了决心、不去做周朝的臣下、决定要移居于朝鮮了、</p>
<p>𥬹子快要到朝鮮去了、他說、「我不願受你們周代人的指揮、我不願做你們的臣子、我要到朝鮮發展去了、」𥬹子說說了這幾句話後、他就離開中國了、</p>
<p>當𥬹子没有到朝鮮以前、他知道朝鮮的文化是很低的、他仍帶了詩書·禮樂·陰陽·卜筮·以及百工技藝等種種的中國文化隨往、他到朝鮮後、果然朝鮮的一切情形是和他心裏所想像的一樣、</p>
<p>𥬹子看到朝鮮人生計的困難、他乃召集許多朝鮮人于一處、對他們說、</p>
<p>「你們來、我敎你們、這是一種養蠶的方法、養蠶起來會吐絲、將一根一根的絲織起來就成爲綢緞、有了綢緞就可做衣服、你們以後的衣服問題就可解决了」</p>
<p>𥬹子將這話說完、伸一伸腰、要繼續着說、</p>
<p>「你們再聽、我敎你們、這是一種耕種的方法、你們能夠照這種方法去耕種、以後你們食的問題也就可解决了、」</p>
<p>後來他又將中國的詩書·禮樂·卜筮·陰陽等中國文化敎與朝鮮人、他見當時朝鮮人的野蠻、又立了八條法律去呌他們遵守、結果、一個野蠻的朝鮮民族、經了𥬹子的敎化以後、就漸漸地向着光明的路上走了、</p>
<p>作者按、關於𥬹子移居朝鮮的事情、現在的一班研究歷史的人對之都抱着一種懷疑的態度、但我們看現在朝鮮所發現的關於𥬹子子的種種遺蹟、又不得不使我們相信𥬹子移殖朝鮮乃不是一種没有根據的傳說、於是我且將這故事寫出來、以作有志研究朝鮮問題的人做一個小小的參考、</p>

<h3>Sends Notes to China and Japan Separately</h3>
<p>Hoping that Both Countries Will Restrain Their Troops</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, regarding the Northeast China Incident, has delayed sending separate notes to China and Japan until today in order to avoid the appearance of interference and to allow the League of Nations to mediate first, and to give China and Japan time to adjust on their own. The content generally states that the U.S. government, in view of the sincere desire of the American people for the principles and methods of peace to exist permanently in international relations, and in view of the various treaties, including those signed by the United States, that contain provisions aimed at stipulating that international disputes should not be resolved by force, feels it must express its intention to the governments of China and Japan, hoping that the governments of both countries will restrain their troops, not provoke further conflict, and handle their forces in accordance with the needs of international law and international agreements, and not take any further action that would hinder the achievement of a peaceful resolution of the dispute. However, the notes do not mention the Kellogg-Briand Pact or the 1922 Washington Treaty. As Stimson is actively working to use U.S. power to maintain peace and tranquility in the Far East, U.S. President Hoover also issued a statement at the White House today, saying that the United States still hopes that China and Japan can resolve this matter with very limited outside assistance. Also, today, Japanese envoy Debuchi met with Stimson and assured him that Japanese troops had not advanced north of Changchun and said that the situation in Manchuria seemed to be easing somewhat and that Japan intended to withdraw its troops as quickly as possible, etc. (25th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Statement</h3>
<p>Fabricating Facts About Chinese Troops Destroying Roads</p>
<p>Endeavoring to Defend Aggressive Actions</p>
<p>Denying Advancing Troops North of Changchun</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Last night, the Japanese government issued a statement on the Manchuria Incident, emphatically stating that it did not desire to occupy Manchuria by force of arms, but only desired to obtain security for peaceful enterprises and investments. The statement briefly described the causes and consequences of the Manchuria Incident and pointed out that China had repeatedly thwarted Japan's attempts to promote friendship. It then stated that the incident was caused by Chinese soldiers damaging a section of the South Manchuria Railway near Shenyang. It continued that the Japanese military authorities, considering that the Japanese army in Manchuria numbered only 14,000 while the Chinese army numbered 220,000, feared that once the railway was cut off, the lives and interests of Japanese people would be harmed in all directions. Therefore, they had no choice but to take swift action to prevent this from happening, occupying important locations in Manchuria and disarming the Chinese army. Afterwards, they immediately returned to the railway area, leaving small detachments of Japanese soldiers in Jilin and Shenyang for police duties. The statement further stated that after receiving news of the conflict, the cabinet held an emergency meeting on the 19th and decided to do its best to contain the situation, instructing the Minister of the Army and the Commander of the Kwantung Army accordingly. It then stated the necessity of temporarily occupying Jilin to prevent the Chinese army from attacking the South Manchuria Railway. It denied the news of advancing troops north of Changchun and concluded that the Japanese government was eager to resolve the dispute and hoped that Sino-Japanese relations would become closer and more friendly as a result. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's statement regarding the Sino-Japanese problem, issued at 11 PM last night, is outlined below: (1) Recently, unpleasant incidents have frequently occurred in Manchuria and Mongolia, which are closely related to Japan's interests. This is because Japan's just policy of respecting friendship has not been reciprocated by the Chinese side in the same spirit. When this impression penetrated the Japanese people, a part of the Chinese army destroyed the Japanese railway and clashed with the Japanese garrison, which was the direct cause of this incident. (2) At the time of the conflict, the Japanese military strength in Manchuria was only over 14,400, while the Chinese forces totaled 220,000 in various places. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese living in various parts of Manchuria were in a state of unease. Therefore, in order to eliminate the cause of the danger, the Japanese military swiftly began to take action, disarming the nearby Chinese forces and urging the Chinese autonomous authorities to maintain law and order. (3) Currently, Japanese troops are stationed outside the affiliated territory, in Shenyang city and Jilin, and a number of troops are stationed in other places. However, these are not military occupations. Rumors that Japanese troops occupied the Yingkou Customs and Salt Administration, and that Japanese troops occupied the three railways between Sipingjie, Zhengjiatun, and Shenyang Xinmintun, are all rumors. Reports of sending troops north of Changchun and Jiandao are also unfounded. (4) In order to prevent the incident from escalating, the government has instructed the commander of the Manchurian garrison army to dispatch a part of the army to Jilin in order to remove the threat to the flank of the South Manchuria Railway. Once the objective is achieved, the dispatched troops will return to Changchun. (5) The fact that a mixed brigade was dispatched from the Korean garrison army to be under the command of the Manchurian garrison commander is because the number of Japanese soldiers in the Manchurian garrison is still within the treaty limits and cannot be said to be expanding in relation to the facts. (6) Japan has no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, needless to say. It only wants its subjects to be able to engage in peaceful enterprises with peace of mind and to have the opportunity to participate in the development of the region with capital and labor. (25th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Responds to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Refusing to Send an Investigative Committee</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese government's response to the League of Nations, approved by the Japanese Emperor, is published as follows: Regarding the first item of the League of Nations' notification, Japan has from the beginning taken military action solely to protect its residents and railways, and has consistently strived to prevent the expansion of the situation, concentrating on the desire to resolve the issue peacefully through negotiations between China and Japan, and will not change this policy in the future. Regarding the second item, the Japanese army has returned to the railway area. Outside the railway area, only a few troops are stationed in Shenyang and Jilin for security purposes. This is not a military occupation. When the situation improves, it is planned to have them return to their original locations. Trust the sincerity of the Japanese government's attitude. (25th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chairman of the League of Nations Council, Lerroux, informally proposed to Sawazawa that the League of Nations send a committee to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the Manchuria Incident. For this reason, the Japanese government held an emergency cabinet meeting last night and instructed Ambassador Sawazawa to reply to Chairman Lerroux as follows: (1) The Manchuria Incident is self-defense, and the nature of the incident is a local conflict. The League of Nations and other third countries need not interfere. (2) The Sino-Japanese relationship in Manchuria is unique. Sending an investigative committee by the League of Nations may hinder relations between the two countries. Therefore, the Japanese government cannot comply. (25th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A message from Japan says that the Japanese government deeply desires a peaceful solution through Sino-Japanese negotiations, and that the majority of the Japanese army has withdrawn to the South Manchuria Railway area, with only a small number of troops stationed in Shenyang, Jilin, and other places for security purposes. These troops will also withdraw when the overall situation improves. (25th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Matter of Sending an Investigative Team Has Not Yet Been Decided</p>
<p>A Special Committee Considers Japan's Response</p>
<p>Sawazawa Makes Counter-Propaganda to Cover Up the Truth</p>
<p>London Dispatch: Geneva Dispatch: It is said that the air here today is still filled with concern about the Manchurian situation. Everyone is very happy to hear of the United States' support for the attitude of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Today, when the League of Nations Assembly gathered for a meeting, Lerroux, the acting chairman of the Administrative Council, explained the Sino-Japanese turmoil to the assembled diplomats, and announced that the Administrative Council and the Assembly would continue to meet until the Manchurian Incident was resolved. On behalf of the Administrative Council, Lerroux telegraphed US Secretary of State Stimson to thank him for his telegram of support for the League of Nations' attitude, and expressed the League of Nations' appreciation for US assistance. Lerroux stated that no matter what individual efforts a certain government deems necessary, the most successful results can only rely on the continued joint efforts of the national society organized by the League of Nations. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the League of Nations Council is continuing to meet, it has not been able to make any further progress on the Liaoning Incident today, as it is awaiting instructions from Tokyo to Japanese representative Sawazawa. Also, China's petition to the League of Nations, based on Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, also needs to be changed to Article 15. In addition, a resolution of the League of Nations Evaluation Council is awaited. Many people in the League of Nations believe that Sawazawa will receive instructions from Tokyo on Friday, especially regarding the League of Nations' request for him to withdraw the invading troops and the reply to the organization of an investigation committee. Today, the Japanese representative formally notified the League of Nations, making a great show of sophistry and denying the rumors that Japanese troops had occupied Qingdao and Yantai, stating that the Japanese naval landing forces had never landed on Chinese territory in this incident. Japanese consuls in China have asked the Chinese authorities to properly protect Japanese residents, and are planning to move Japanese women and children in Nanjing to Shanghai if necessary. He also denied that Japanese troops had occupied many cities and towns in Manchuria, claiming that Japanese troops had not advanced north of Changchun, and that Japanese troops in Jilin had also withdrawn to Changchun after the local area had been stabilized. The 4,000 Japanese soldiers in Manchuria, together with those transferred from Korea, totaled 15,000, and are now concentrated in the South Manchuria Railway area. The management of Shenyang city is purely temporary. This concentration is necessary because Chinese local officials fled after the Shenyang incident on Friday night. In other towns along the South Manchuria Railway, the Japanese military commander and Chinese officials jointly manage the area. The Japanese military in Manchuria is only taking steps to maintain traffic to ensure the safety of the troops. Once the local area returns to normal, this will be revoked. He said that if this method is not delayed by China's attitude, this normal state can be restored. Currently, no military government has been established anywhere. (24th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese Minister Sawazawa made a declaration tonight denying rumors that the military faction in Tokyo had expelled the civilian faction and seized power in the government. Sawazawa also said that Japanese troops had withdrawn from Jilin and now only occupied a few places along the railway. As for the reason for the Japanese withdrawal, he feared that it was due to the counterattack of the Chinese army. Sawazawa also said that Japanese residents in several treaty ports in China had been ordered to withdraw, and that a civilian government had been established in Shenyang. Most of the facts stated by Sawazawa above were soon refuted by Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji. Shi said that he had received a direct report from China stating that Japanese troops had not only not retreated slightly, but had advanced towards the Harbin area. Therefore, in the face of this increasingly urgent situation, China had to request the Council again to organize an international investigation committee to visit the eastern province. Sawazawa did not say a word about this motion. The League of Nations had already agreed to China's request to send an investigation committee, and now it was waiting for Japan's agreement. Japan's answer to this point should arrive tomorrow. If Japan does not strongly oppose this move, the League of Nations can immediately send an investigation committee. The committee should consist of two non-Chinese foreigners selected by Nanjing, two non-Japanese committee members selected by Tokyo, and three representatives from neutral countries appointed by the Council. In addition, League of Nations officials who are currently in the Far East, or who will be dispatched soon. In addition, there have been many speculations about Russia's attitude towards the East Province incident recently, but they are all unfounded rumors. However, Russia's garrison on the Manchurian border has obviously increased, and Foreign Minister Karakhan has already set off eastward, which shows that the Russian government attaches great importance to the Far East incident. (24th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation received a message from the Tokyo government last night and notified the Chairman of the Administrative Council, Lerroux, of the contents this morning. It is expected that the Special Committee of the Administrative Council dealing with the Manchurian case will consider the Japanese government's message today, and then discuss ways to resolve the issue. However, it is currently heard that the Japanese government does not agree with the views of the Administrative Council, and that the non-permanent members of the Administrative Council and the members of the Assembly are all dissatisfied with the simple message provided to them by the five-member committee handling the Manchurian case. According to several sources, the wording of the Japanese government's message is gentle, and it can now be seen that the problem has actually been resolved. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Minister Sawazawa received the Japanese reply to the League of Nations Council this morning. The Council has scheduled a special meeting this afternoon to discuss it. Although the Japanese reply to the League of Nations rejects the proposal to organize a Manchurian investigation team, this point of contention is expected to be resolved today. The League of Nations Assembly and Council are scheduled to adjourn tomorrow. (25th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ishii, Honorary Chairman of the Japan League of Nations Association, spoke to a Reuters interviewer today about the League of Nations' actions on the Manchurian case, and particularly emphasized the outside rumors that the United States did not approve of sending a special committee to investigate the matter in Manchuria, saying that the League of Nations' views were no less than suspecting the solemn declaration of the Japanese government. Trust is mutual. If the League of Nations does not trust Japan, then Japan's trust in the League of Nations will also be greatly affected. For example, if the League of Nations suspects the truth of the military equipment provided by the member groups, and proposes to send a committee to investigate the truth, how can a self-respecting country welcome it? I am afraid that the entire structure of the military reduction plan will be defeated. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Has No Sincerity in Withdrawing Troops</h3>

The Japanese government has consistently said that it intends to withdraw troops as soon as the situation permits, but there has been no formal statement involving the withdrawal of troops outside of this.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>An Absurd Statement from the Japanese Government (1)</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese launched a violent attack on our Northeast, they have been wagging their glib tongues, using ludicrous terms like "self-defense," "local incident," and "securing occupation" to conceal the truth and attempt to deceive the people of the world. We had initially thought that these treacherous and unjustifiable remarks were merely excuses offered after the fact by ambitious military officers acting independently in an attempt to evade blame. We even issued a sharp rebuttal in a commentary titled "World Powers, Take Note of Japanese Atrocities." However, the "Statement of the Japanese Government Regarding the Manchurian Incident," issued on the 25th after a cabinet meeting, made five points and was full of sophistry. It spoke with the same voice as the ambitious Japanese military officers, and its denial of facts and framing of accusations were even worse. Politics have been hijacked by violence, diplomacy has lost its normalcy, right and wrong are confused, and actions are perverse. This is truly a disgrace to the political history of the world. Facts speak louder than words, and much talk only brings shame. Alas, Japanese, enough is enough.</p>
<p>Now, let us address each of the five points in their statement and refute them one by one.</p>
<p>(1) The first point in the statement says: "The Japanese government has always considered Sino-Japanese friendship, coexistence, and co-prosperity as a fixed policy and has consistently strived to realize it." Alas, whom do the Japanese intend to deceive? Heaven? For decades, the Japanese have ceaselessly played and sung the tune of "Sino-Japanese friendship, coexistence, and co-prosperity." However, judging by their actions, the Japanese have never ceased plotting to destroy and annihilate us, so that Japan can dominate East Asia and exist and prosper alone. The forceful seizure of our Northeast's resources and the aggressive occupation of its railways, the threat of the Twenty-One Demands, the two military expeditions to our Shandong province, and the bombing in Huanggutun—are these friendship or aggression? Old and new wounds are piled upon one another, covering our entire body. The history of Sino-Japanese negotiations is stained with the blood and tears of our people. The Japanese, however, rejoice and celebrate their nation's prosperity, while we endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, our hearts bleeding. We dare not forget what we have suffered, not for a single day. Our country sincerely welcomes genuine friendship from the Japanese, so that both nations can prosper together. However, the reality is too far from the ideal. This overwhelming fact is enough to shatter the Japanese government's sophistry. The statement also says that in recent years, the actions of Chinese officials and civilians have constantly irritated the feelings of the Japanese people, especially in the Manchurian and Mongolian regions, where Japan has the closest interests. Recently, various unpleasant incidents have frequently occurred, and on the night of the 19th, Chinese troops demolished the South Manchurian Railway, which caused a conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops. Nothing could be more unreasonable and groundless than this statement. The newly emerging China, in order to achieve its sovereignty as an independent nation, must abolish all unequal treaties that fetter the life of the Chinese nation. This is only right and proper. Based on this theory, to encourage our own people internally and to proclaim this to friendly nations externally is even more just and reasonable. Why do Japanese officials and civilians disregard China's sovereignty and legitimate demands, regard them as offensive, and fly into inexplicable rages? Furthermore, "Manchuria and Mongolia" are Chinese territories. What close interests do they have with Japan? The Wanpaoshan Incident and other incidents were all created by the Japanese. The actions of the Japanese in our Northeast over the years have been violent and reckless. Do they have our people in their eyes at all? And even so, it still fails to satisfy the Japanese. Unless we take our Northeast and offer it to the Japanese with both hands, there will be no time when the Japanese will be satisfied. Moreover, what evidence is there that our troops demolished the South Manchurian Railway? The Japanese fear they have no justification for sending troops and are using this as an excuse to provoke trouble, as is evident from the Wanpaoshan Incident, the Korean Incident, and the so-called Nakamura Incident. Is not the so-called demolition of the South Manchurian Railway by Chinese troops simply the same tactic? Everyone knows Sima Zhao's intentions. This is the second fact that shatters the Japanese sophistry.</p>
<p>(2) The second point in the statement declares that at that time, the Japanese troops guarding the South Manchurian Railway numbered only 10,400, while there were 220,000 Chinese troops around them. The situation suddenly became critical, so they had no choice but to strike first. This is tantamount to admitting that the Japanese military's violence was purely self-defense. If what the Japanese government says is true, then our country should have been determined to engage in a war with Japan. If we intended to provoke, why not simply attack the Japanese troops instead of making the foolish move of demolishing the South Manchurian Railway? Even if we were determined to provoke, with twenty times the number of Japanese troops, twenty against one would be more than enough to wipe out the violent Japanese army. Why would we allow them to attack and occupy Shenyang without any resistance? Furthermore, after Shenyang was occupied, our troops could have counterattacked. Why did we retreat again and again, ultimately giving in? The world has never seen anyone prepare for war and then offer no resistance. This is the third fact that shatters the Japanese sophistry.</p>
<p>National Urgent Telegrams Regarding the Japanese Government</p>
<h3>Insist on Direct Negotiations</h3>
<p>Oppose Interference from Third Parties</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government reiterated today that it only wishes to negotiate directly with the Nanjing government. The cabinet decided to oppose interference from the League of Nations or third parties. As for the League of Nations Council's proposal to send an international investigation team to Manchuria for on-the-spot investigation, Japan still refuses. The Japanese government has instructed Ambassador Yoshizawa to inform Council President Lerroux that the Japanese military's actions in Manchuria are for self-defense and that the dispute is purely local in nature and requires no interference. It also stated that Sino-Japanese relations in Manchuria have a special nature and that an investigation team would only cause disputes and hinder direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. The above resolution was announced after the Japanese government's declaration was published, which is tantamount to completely rejecting the League of Nations Council's actions. The Japanese government has also decided that in the event of anti-Japanese incidents in central China, Japanese residents in the Yangtze River area should prepare to retreat to Shanghai or Hankou, where they will be protected by Japanese naval landing forces. Japan's refusal of League of Nations arbitration is bound to cause new developments in Geneva, and how the League of Nations Council will take further action is attracting world attention.

Senator Borah spoke in Idaho, Montana, and Moscow today, addressing the Manchurian crisis in relation to the issue of disarmament and treaty revision. He said that even if the reasons Japan relies on to invade Manchuria were ten times greater than what it currently has, it should not violate international conventions, the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations Charter, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The British House of Commons also raised the Manchurian incident today and discussed it. Undersecretary of State Eden, a Labour Party member, gave a detailed report on the British Foreign Office's information on the Japanese army's occupation of various towns and cities in Manchuria since September 19, and on the League of Nations' handling of the matter. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German public opinion, after the initial shock of the Sino-Japanese incident, is now gradually shifting its attention to the League of Nations to see how it will respond to the incident and whether it can preside over international affairs. Therefore, today the Sino-Japanese matter is nothing less than a touchstone for the League of Nations. Today's German public opinion has many criticisms of the League of Nations, saying that it has always adopted an ambiguous attitude towards major international incidents, is timid by nature, and dares not take sides. These views are held by conservative newspapers such as the Lokal-Anzeiger and the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. Others, such as the Vossische Zeitung, hold a supportive view of the League of Nations, saying that the League of Nations is in a very respected position and therefore must not take hasty action, as we private individuals can when we are angry and slam our fists on the table. Therefore, if there is any hope that Japan can withdraw its troops and restore the situation to what it was before the war, the League of Nations should quietly wait for it to withdraw its troops automatically. Furthermore, the League of Nations must not rashly issue orders without any backing. Therefore, in this situation, it is necessary to wait quietly for the situation to change. But once the situation is clear and Japan is determined to disregard the League of Nations, then the League of Nations will have no second course of action but to rise up and condemn it, and what will happen after that is unknowable.

At the same time, Chinese students insisted that the signs should not be removed. Therefore, the three restaurants voluntarily closed to avoid conflict. (24th National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Questions the Japanese Authorities</h3>

After our conversation, I said that China and Japan have had disagreements for a hundred years and that in the future, they should change their course, abandon their past suspicions, emphasize good faith, and cultivate friendship. I further pointed out that the crux of the two countries' diplomatic relations lies in the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces. The settlement of this issue can only be effective if it is approved by the entire Chinese people. The National Assembly, which will soon be convened, will propose various conditions for resolving the issue of the Eastern Provinces and seek its adoption. I will guarantee the so-called approval of the entire Chinese people. At that time, you replied that your government had no intention of annexing the Three Eastern Provinces and that, if necessary, your country could declare its recognition of the Three Eastern Provinces as the territory of the Republic of China. Japan had no intention of undermining China's territorial sovereignty. Later, I also spoke with key figures from your country's General Staff and Army Ministry, as well as leaders of the Seiyukai, and I was comforted by the various views on China that I heard from all sides. I never imagined that the reality today would be so different. Famous cities and important towns have been forcibly occupied by your country's troops in no time. Even the most weak and declining nation would be outraged and rise up to resist such lawless and unreasonable behavior. The Guangzhou government is working hard to implement the late Premier's new policy towards Japan, and your country's troops suddenly commit such atrocities. Are you going to reverse what you said to me in the past? Therefore, I am asking these questions. (25th Special Telegram)</p>

Ma, New China Daily, Philippines.</p>
<p>Telegram from Nanjing: To all newspaper offices. The reports in yesterday's and today's newspapers regarding a joint meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans are inaccurate. Only four or five members of the Supervisory Yuan participated in the discussions in their private capacities, and it was not a joint meeting. This is to clarify and we hope you will make the corrections. Secretariat of the Control Yuan.</p>
<p>Telegram from Kaifeng: To all newspaper offices. Since the Wan incident, our entire nation, from the court to the common people, has endured humiliation and pain, striving for justice. Yet, the Japanese imperialists still believe their ambitions are unfulfilled. They suddenly sent heavy troops to occupy Shenyang, Yingkou, Changchun, Liaoyang, Jilin, Yanji, and other places, destroying our barracks and factories, detaining our military and political leaders, and killing countless of our soldiers and civilians. They even appointed the mayor of Shenyang without authorization, acting as if they were sovereign. Such brutal and savage acts are unprecedented in civilized countries and rarely seen even in barbarian societies. They regard the Chinese people as worse than pigs and dogs. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? If we do not fight back, how can the nation survive? Now the national crisis is urgent, and disaster is imminent. We hope that our countrymen will abandon personal grudges and unite as one to resist foreign aggression. In particular, we must unite and work hard on the following matters: (1) Concentrate the nation's strength under the unified command of the central government, so that all actions are coordinated. (2) Request the central government to issue a serious protest to Japan, ordering the Japanese troops to withdraw immediately, and reserve the right to claim compensation for all damages. If the protest is ineffective, immediately take necessary self-defense measures to save our tens of millions of suffering compatriots in the Northeast. (3) The entire nation must strictly enforce economic severance with Japan. (4) The entire nation must actively prepare all methods of last resort. (5) The truth of the Japanese atrocities must be broadcasted to the world, in order to promote international sympathy and uphold justice. (6) Do our best to protect the Japanese residents in China, and do not retaliate, to show our civilized nation's proper attitude. The survival of the nation hangs in the balance. We hope that our compatriots will rise up and plan for it urgently. Shandong Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Telegram from Guide: To all newspaper offices. This time, Japan disregarded international public law and human faith, taking advantage of our crisis to forcibly occupy Shenyang, annex the Eastern Provinces, attack our troops, capture our officials, bomb our artillery factories, and burn our streets. They also sent warships to our coastal ports to provoke and demonstrate their power. Their acts are arrogant and tyrannical, revealing their sinister plot. If this can be tolerated, the nation will cease to exist. At this time of national crisis, our soldiers have an unshirkable duty to protect the country and its people. What are we waiting for to achieve benevolence and righteousness? The military and civilians of the whole country should unite, support the central government, and fight against the enemy with the same hatred. Shedding tears, we vow to go to the national crisis, preparing for battle, and awaiting instructions. This telegram is filled with unspeakable grief and indignation. Zhang Lisheng, Commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division of the National Revolutionary Army, Deputy Commander Jiang Kanru, Chief of Staff Sun Baoguang, Brigade Commanders Ge Wucheng and Zhang Shutian, Regimental Commanders Wang Xianzhang, Zhang Chuanfu, Ji Jiazhen, Zhang Daqing, Gao Shude, and Ma Jiewu, along with all officers and soldiers, bow in anguish.</p>
<p>Telegram from Shaanxi: To all newspaper offices. Recently, we received a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang Haodian stating that Japan forcibly occupied Shenyang on the appointed day (皓日). Upon hearing this, we cannot help but feel indignant. Our country has been plagued by internal strife and disasters for years. The people's livelihood and national finances are in a precarious state. Now, Japanese imperialism is taking advantage of our crisis, disregarding international law, and brazenly revealing its true face. The blood of Jinan is still fresh, and the frontiers of Liaoshen have already been lost. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent. All our citizens, at this critical juncture of the nation, must not cooperate to resist foreign aggression and rescue the country from danger. If we do not work together with one heart, we cannot secure the nation. We hope that all the people in the country, all comrades in the army, will unite to resist the violent Japanese. All those with blood and spirit should share the deep hatred of the enemy. Qingyuan, who holds a humble position as a commander, has pledged himself to the country and will lead more than 10,000 soldiers to serve as the vanguard and vow to go to the national crisis. We hope that our countrymen will rise up together to address this issue. This appeal is made with the utmost urgency. Ma Qingyuan, Commander of the Shaanxi Garrison Division, and Deputy Commander Xu Tuyuan, along with all officers and soldiers, bow in anguish.</p>
<p>Telegram from Wuchang: To all newspaper offices. It was recently reported that on the 18th of this month, the Japanese army suddenly entered the Liaoning provincial capital, destroying the arsenal, detaining our officials, and slaughtering our people. Our garrison troops did not resist because they had not received orders. It is also reported that similar incidents occurred in Changchun, Yingkou, and other places. We are filled with indignation upon reading this. After our country's political reforms, we are striving for stability. We treat friendly nations with utmost sincerity. For decades, we have been accommodating and tolerant of the Japanese people's premeditated impoliteness, hoping that they would reflect. Even during the major earthquake in Japan some years ago, our people, based on the principle of disaster relief and neighborhood compassion, did their best to provide assistance, because we are of the same race and culture, and the relationship is very close. However, the Japanese people, selfishly using force, have been eyeing us covetously and have been carrying out aggression due to our internal troubles, trying to achieve their insatiable demands. Now, taking advantage of our widespread floods and the displacement of our people, they have brazenly sent troops to occupy various places in our northeastern provinces and carried out massacres. This kind of behavior is tantamount to treating our country as nothing. Their actions of taking advantage of our crisis and gloating over our misfortune cannot be tolerated by our people, who are still breathing. We should rise up in anger, unite, and support the government to deal with them. We, Yuanquan, and others, as soldiers, have the responsibility to defend the country. Faced with foreign aggression, we will not hesitate to fight to the death. We should request the central government to inform the people of the country to sever relations with Japan and resolutely declare war. Yuanquan and others respectfully lead their troops, vowing to be the vanguard to fight to the death. Even if we all sacrifice ourselves and die for the country, it would be an honor. We only hope that our comrades in the country, aware of the danger of national demise, will put aside all grievances and go to the national crisis together, pooling our wisdom and strength, and striving for life amidst death. With one heart and one mind, we will avenge this great humiliation. If our 400 million compatriots can rise up together, with unwavering determination, then with united will we will be invincible. The Japanese, although relying on their strong and violent force, will inevitably be defeated because those who are arrogant will be defeated. In the end, victory will surely belong to our glorious Chinese people. Let us all cherish the heart of saving the country and be keenly aware of the crisis, in the hope of reversing the situation. Mountains and rivers can be changed, but this determination will not change. We express our urgent appeals and respectfully request your examination. Xu Yuanquan, Ma Dengying, Xiao Zhichu, Zhang Zhenhan, Liu Peixu, Xu Jiwu, Han Changjun, Ding Zhipan, Huang Xin, Chen Yong, Wang Jinyong, Xin Mingli, and Xu Dezuo, together bow.</p>
<p>Telegram from Hangzhou: To all newspapers. The Japanese slaves' atrocities are trampling on our land, and the country is in danger of imminent destruction. If we do not urgently seek self-salvation, our compatriots will be wiped out. We humbly request the National Government to promptly determine a policy to deal with foreign aggression. If the Japanese slaves indeed declare war, the faculty and staff of our school are willing to go to the front line to fulfill our duties. This telegram is written in blood, and we do not know what we are saying. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Zhejiang Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical College respectfully submits.</p>
<p>Telegram from Quzhou: To the Shenbao, forwarded to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping, Mr. Sun Zhesheng in Guangzhou, Gu Xiangqin, Chen Bonan, and all gentlemen, as well as all provincial party headquarters and provincial governments. The Japanese are wolves, trapping Shenyang and destroying our Chinese people. A great disaster is upon us, and the country is on the verge of destruction. We beg you, revolutionary pioneers and leaders of the people, to resolve your differences and unite to fight against external aggression, and go to the national crisis together. We respectfully telegram this appeal. The Party Headquarters of the 3rd Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force bows.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Occupy Andong</h3>
<p>All Government Offices and Transportation Facilities Seized</p>
<p>City Police Disarmed and Guarded by Japanese Troops</p>
<p>Andong Fast Mail: On the morning of the 19th, at 3:20 AM, the Andong County Government suddenly received an urgent telegram from the Liaoning Provincial Government stating that the Japanese troops had suddenly broken into the provincial capital around 9:00 PM on the 18th and occupied various government offices. While County Magistrate Wang was still in astonishment, he simultaneously received information from the Japanese side that the Japanese garrison in Andong was about to enter the streets in formation to occupy various Chinese government offices. Given the urgency of the situation, County Magistrate Wang immediately summoned Zhang, the director of the Commercial Port Public Security Bureau, Luan, the director of the Water Police, Wang, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, Chairman Sun of the Chamber of Commerce, and over twenty local gentry to the County Government for an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. At the same time, Chief Oba of the Japanese Police Station, accompanied by two armed patrolmen, rushed to the County Government and claimed that the Japanese troops would enter the streets within an hour, stating that this was an order from their government and was inevitable. After Oba left, County Magistrate Wang again discussed with the heads of various agencies, but no solution was found. By this time, dawn had already broken. Shortly after, approximately 200 soldiers, both cavalry and infantry, from the Japanese garrison in Andong entered the city (i.e., the Chinese streets) in formation. Another group of Japanese troops rushed to Dongkanzi, occupied the court and the 7th prison, and ordered the artillery team defending the prison to surrender their weapons. The soldiers were placed under house arrest, and no one was allowed to enter or leave. The Japanese troops who invaded the city occupied the County Government, the Commercial Port Public Security Bureau, the Water Public Security Bureau, the County Public Security Bureau, the Fisheries Bureau, the Military Police, the Telegraph Bureau, the Telephone Bureau, etc. First, they confiscated the weapons of the guards of each agency. Then, they set up guard posts of five or six soldiers each at the entrances of each agency, prohibiting entry and exit. After the Japanese troops confiscated the weapons of the Commercial Port Public Security Bureau and its branches, they were collected in one place and transported to the Japanese police station in a flatcar for storage. The city is now filled with panic, and residents are fleeing to take refuge. All banks and money shops have been closed. At 6:00 AM today, 200 Japanese infantry soldiers arrived from the Shahe Town station, stationed in the city, having been transferred from the Anfeng line. There are also reports that Japanese troops from Korea are being transferred here. The police from all branches of the Public Security Bureau in the city have been withdrawn from their posts since 10:00 AM on the 19th. Not a single Chinese policeman can be seen in the city. Only armed Japanese troops are patrolling the main streets in groups. At 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM today, airplanes flew twice from Pyongyang, Korea, circling the city three or four times before flying away. The sound of the engines was deafening and terrifying. Also, the through train that departed from Shenyang at 6:00 AM today stopped at Jiguan Mountain. All the passengers on the train were ordered to disembark. At the same time, all stations along the Anfeng line have stopped selling tickets. (September 19th)</p>
<p>Tianjin Reporters Group</p>
<h3>Account of Inspection Trip to Liaoning</h3>
<p>The Tianjin reporters' group, on the morning of the 19th at 11:30 AM, took a Beining train out of the pass for an on-site inspection. The train was the Beining Railway's third through train. It was fast and stable beyond compare. Aside from the Japanese, nearly all passengers in the train were silent. The train continued east, not stopping at the small stations along the way. Before midnight, the train reached Shanhaiguan. There were Japanese soldiers patrolling at all major stations east of Qinhuangdao. They carried rifles across their chests, looking fierce and behaving aggressively, pushing their way through as if no one else was there. The train arrived at Huanggu Village at 1:00 PM the next day. Huanggu Village was one station away from Shenyang, where the railway connection was cut. Passengers got off the train. The station was packed with refugees, numbering over a thousand. They looked panic-stricken and did not know where to go. After getting off the train, the reporters took rickshaws, intending to detour to the South Manchurian Railway concession. The purposes of this trip were, firstly, to interview the highest-ranking Japanese military officer and, secondly, to interview the Japanese consul, to ask for the reason for occupying Shenyang. The Japanese reporter Noguchi had previously agreed to introduce them. If the Japanese military permitted, they would investigate the situation in the streets. However, along the way, they had to pass through the South Manchurian Railway bridge, and at both ends of the bridge, there were Japanese guards and plainclothes reservists armed with military weapons on guard. There were also so-called "Western Police" who seemed to be gathering information, riding horses back and forth from time to time. Chinese people who passed this bridge had to wear a pass issued by the Japanese military on their arms, but they were still searched. Foreigners were allowed to pass without obstruction. When the reporters arrived here, Noguchi first went to negotiate. The Japanese military said that permission had to be obtained from their superiors. Therefore, the reporters sent Noguchi and Wang Jian [missing character] to go. While the reporters were waiting at the bridge entrance, because this place was a major thoroughfare, Chinese people were passing by from time to time. Even though they wore passes, the situation of how they were treated was unbearable to witness. Apart from the two guards, the rest of the Japanese soldiers on duty at this bridge were plainclothes reservists, totaling eight people. The rickshaw puller whispered to the reporters that there was also a Korean among them, who looked like he was about to devour someone. Just then, gunshots suddenly rang out from under the bridge. The Japanese soldiers quickly drew their bayonets and went down the bridge to search. Soon, Noguchi and Wang Jian returned in a car with the Japanese military, reporting that permission had been granted to pass through, but cameras were not allowed to be brought in. At the very least, the film had to be removed before crossing the bridge. There was about a platoon of Japanese soldiers stationed on the other side of the bridge. Beyond this point was the South Manchurian Railway concession. The only things seen in the streets were cars used by the Japanese military and self-defense groups made up of young men in plain clothes. Almost all Chinese people had disappeared. The Japanese were surprised to see a large group of Chinese people coming. The reporters then went to the Asahi branch office. There were many photos on display in the office. One of them showed three Japanese soldiers [missing character] a Chinese person whose body was covered in bloodstains, who had already died a violent death. A Japanese woman suddenly entered the office and took away all the photos and the extra edition of the newspaper issued by the company. It was speculated that there must have been many inhumane traces within. They had not yet seen the full picture.</p>
<p>After resting briefly at the Asahi branch office, they then went to the Taihe Hotel run by the South Manchurian Railway. Noguchi promised to introduce them to the Japanese military officer and asked the reporters to wait quietly. Upon arriving at the Taihe, the British and German reporters left one after another to visit their respective consuls stationed in Shenyang. Soon, Noguchi returned with news that the Japanese officer had refused to meet with them. At the same time, Japanese detectives also came in droves. According to Noguchi, the addresses of the reporters had to be reported to the Japanese military commander so that personnel could be sent to monitor them at any time. Since their movements were being monitored and there were many dangers, and they were subject to inspection at any time and place, the reporters felt that it was useless to stay for long and decided to return to Tianjin that day. The British and German reporters decided to stay temporarily. Thus, they split into two groups. The Chinese reporters returned to Tianjin, and the British and German reporters...</p>

<p>Then Leaving Shenyang, Acting Temporarily: a Japanese automobile, with a Japanese flag on its hood, was able to drive around to view the street conditions. Reporters and others inspected it and took advantage of it, acting without conscience. The matter was thus concluded in Huanggu Village, and they boarded the car and returned to Tianjin. The detailed circumstances recorded below are the result of investigations. On the 18th, late at night at 10 o'clock, a company of the Japanese garrison, led by Captain Kawashima, traveled by car and first destroyed the South Manchurian Railway bridge (called "Tiaogou" by the Japanese). Then, they continued to shell the Seventh Brigade of Wang Yizhe stationed in Beidaying (about one battalion). Besides the garrison, there was also a mortar factory in Northeast China. Before the shelling, the Japanese secretly threw hand grenades, and then immediately opened fire. To the east, a regiment of the Northeastern Army, also under Wang Yizhe, was surrounded by the Japanese. At this time, the highest military and political authorities in Shenyang were only Chief of Staff of the Governor's Office Rong Zhen and Liaoning Provincial Chairman Zang Shiyi. Rong was deeply surprised when he suddenly heard the artillery fire. At the same time, a report from the Beidaying troops arrived. Rong then telegraphed the Japanese Consul General Hayashi, inquiring about the reason for the shelling. Hayashi was not there, so Consul Morioka said he was unaware of the situation. Rong then telegraphed the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shenyang, and the result was the same as the consulate's reply. At this time, Rong and Zang notified the consuls of various countries that the Japanese army had suddenly taken military action and were arbitrarily shelling in the bustling areas. When they inquired with the Japanese consul, there was no definitive answer. If the shelling did not stop, they could not guarantee the safety of the foreign nationals in Shenyang. At the same time, they asked the consuls to inquire, but there was still no result. Later, Rong Zhen telegraphed the Japanese consul again, demanding that he stop the shelling within five minutes. The Japanese consul said it would take ten minutes, and Rong agreed. From 10 p.m. when the shelling began, it became more intense around 12 a.m. When Rong telegraphed the Japanese consul for the third time, the consul replied that he was an administrative official and had no right to interfere in the military's actions. Rong then notified the consuls of various countries, declaring that he was not responsible for protecting the safety of foreign nationals. At the same time, the troops in Beidaying, unaware of the truth and fearing that it would cause negotiations, secretly withdrew without resistance. To the east, a regiment also belonging to the Seventh Brigade was surrounded by the Japanese, and the Japanese completely occupied Beidaying, immediately burning the mortar factory. A large part of the Japanese army entered the city in formation from Nanchengzi, occupied various institutions outside the city, and cut off all transportation and communication. The post office and telegraph bureau in the commercial area and industrial district were completely under the control of the Japanese army. At the same time, they opened fire on the police stations, and the police died in great numbers. Rong knew that the Japanese army would enter the city, so he ordered the city gates to be closed to show complete non-resistance. The Japanese army first climbed in through the southwest breach, and then a large force entered through the city gates. After entering the city, the Japanese army successively occupied the Commander-in-Chief's Office, the private residence of Vice Commander Zhang, the Political Affairs Committee and its subordinate offices, the Provincial Government and its subordinate departments, the long and short wave radio stations, the wired telephone and telegraph bureaus, the official silver house, and the Bianye and Jiaotong Banks. At this time, the police in the city had been ordered to retreat and flee in disguise, but many of those who only changed into long robes without changing their inner uniforms were shot dead. The Fourth and Sixth Police Stations suffered particularly heavy casualties, reaching thirty or forty people. At the same time, only a small part of the Japanese army entered the Commander-in-Chief's Office and immediately disarmed the guards and forced them to sign a statement saying that they fired the first shot. It was heard that the British and American consuls happened to pass by in a car and witnessed this. Many of the Commander-in-Chief's motorcade and private cars were occupied and used to transport property. The cash stored in the official silver house and various banks was also completely taken away. When the staff refused, they were threatened with explosions. Other institutions were all occupied by the Japanese army before 6 a.m. After the occupation, a Japanese "occupied by the Japanese army" paper was added to the original wooden sign of the institution and people were sent to guard and be vigilant. At the same time, the prison was opened and prisoners were released.</p>
<p>After occupying the institutions in the city, the arsenal, mortar factory, aircraft factory, and naval headquarters outside the city were also successively occupied by the Japanese army. The arsenal was the lifeline of the Northeast and the location of the greatest wealth in the Northeast. The stored munitions were sufficient for dozens of divisions. After the Japanese army occupied it, they began to transport them out. The guards at the factory offered no resistance. When the Japanese army attacked the mortar factory, the internal staff had not received orders and there was a conflict. Rong Zhen, upon hearing the report, urgently ordered a retreat, but after the retreat, the workers were massacred by the Japanese army. The number of dead and wounded was said to be 300 in one account and 100 in another. The exact number is still under investigation. The aircraft factory contained 30 airplanes, which were occupied by the Japanese army and the Japanese army's emblem was painted on the wings. The naval headquarters was converted into the temporary headquarters of the Second Division. At the same time, about 2,000 students from the Jiangwutang and students from Feng Yong's Northeast University were expelled. The Japanese army was particularly cruel to intellectuals, especially the soldiers. In addition, the Liaoning Main Station and the Shenhai Railway Bureau were also occupied. Lao Mian and Fu Baoheng escaped in disguise. While occupying the institutions inside and outside the city, the Japanese army also searched for the main leaders of the military and political circles. Wang Yizhe, commander of the Seventh Brigade, took the opportunity to escape. Yu Zhen and Zhai Wenxuan were kidnapped by the Japanese army one after another. The Japanese army paid particular attention to Rong Zhen. The 17th of this month happened to be the birthday of his promotion. The Japanese army searched for Rong but could not find him. His assistant Xing (chief of the Benxi Tax Bureau), Chang Rongzhen (clerk of the Beining Railway Bureau), and Rong's friends Shi Li Qing, Zhang Hongru, Liu Ren, Song Shoushan, Wang Baotian, and others were at Rong's house and were all kidnapped by the Japanese army. Rong's father heard the alarm and jumped over the wall to escape, avoiding the disaster. Rong went to Zang's residence, and the Japanese army thought he must be in the Commander-in-Chief's Office, so he was able to escape calmly. At that time, Li Yulin, the head of the mortar factory, Han Yunpeng, the former garrison commander of Koubei, and several section chiefs of the railway bureau died tragically. At that time, news from outside was cut off, and the number of people who could not be investigated was countless. Even more civilians in the streets died. The whereabouts of the people who were captured are unknown, and it is difficult to predict whether they are alive or dead. Such cruel and violent acts have reached their limit. The Japanese army's actions were taken suddenly without issuing a final ultimatum in advance or formally declaring war, treating the Chinese entirely as enemies. Their intentions are incomprehensible. News from Shenyang was completely cut off, and the Japanese did not allow negotiations. There was no way to transmit news to the outside. Rong and Zang in Shenyang were extremely anxious at this time. In this helpless situation, they suddenly remembered that the Chinese had recently invented a small wireless radio that could transmit by borrowing the power of electric lights, perhaps directly to Beijing and Tianjin. So, at 6 a.m. on the 19th, they took it out from the dust and temporarily brought in the inventor. Zhao, the secretary-general, drafted a telegram, and Rong and Zang both signed it, sending a short telegram to Vice Commander Zhang, reporting the actions of the Japanese army in Shenyang before 6 a.m. Before the second half could be sent, the Japanese army entered the house, and the equipment was confiscated. Therefore, since then, no official telegrams from the Northeast have arrived in Beijing and Tianjin. After the Japanese army entered the city and occupied various institutions, Rong and Zang inquired with the Japanese consul on the morning of the 19th about whether negotiations were possible. The Japanese consul said that Commander-in-Chief Honjo had come to Shenyang from Dalian and would be asked for instructions. At 12 o'clock, Honjo arrived in Shenyang, and Rong telegraphed the Japanese consul again. The Japanese consul said that they were in a meeting. After that, the Japanese army paid special attention to Rong. At the same time, the furniture and belongings in Rong's house were destroyed, and the photos were also taken away. Rong was forced to disguise himself as a servant and sneak out from Zang's residence, wandering through small hotels. At that time, the telephone in the city was still working, but it was being monitored by the Japanese army. Rong used a false name to call Zang in the evening, and Zang said that the Japanese side had indicated that there was no need for negotiations, but that they would discuss security issues with local groups. Later, it was reported that the Japanese army had ordered various groups to organize self-defense corps, with Shenyang County Magistrate Li Qun as the head of the corps, dividing the city into six districts with 100 people in each district, a total of 600 people, to maintain local order in cooperation with the Japanese army. But it is not known whether the groups have expressed their opinions. After Rong and Zang spoke on the phone, Rong went to Zang's residence again alone. Zang was extremely surprised to see him. While they were talking, a Japanese officer came, and Rong hid in the room. After a short time, the Japanese army left, and Rong left Zang's residence, determined to leave Shenyang. He disguised himself and took a detour to the Huanggu Village station through Xiaodongmen, took a train west, first went to Jin County to visit Zhang Zuoxiang to report, and then went to Beijing and Tianjin. Several cadres and Zhang's family members came with Rong.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, Lieutenant General Domen, commander of the Second Division, issued a notice in his name, with two main points: (1) Anyone who hinders the actions of this army will be killed without mercy; (2) Anyone who investigates the actions of this army will be killed without pardon. The rest of the articles are no longer remembered. At the same time, the Japanese army in Shenyang can move freely. Streets can be traveled at noon, but not at noon, and then suddenly can be traveled at night. Those who do not know the rules and accidentally violate them, not to mention those who do not speak the language, will be shot dead. In recent days, twenty or thirty people have died because of this. At the same time, the Japanese army set up artillery platforms on the Drum Tower, which can sweep across the entire city. On the 20th, a citizen, not understanding the reason, paid a little attention, but unintentionally violated the ban and was killed by gunfire. In addition, strict defensive works, such as barbed wire, electric fences, and earth bunkers, were placed in the affiliated areas and near the South Manchurian Railway Station to prevent attacks.</p>
<p>The newspapers run by the Chinese have all been banned since the day the Japanese army entered the city. At the same time, all external propaganda is completely in the hands of the Japanese. In addition to the local Japanese newspapers, the major newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka temporarily published extra editions in Shenyang. Therefore, the news obtained by the Chinese and foreigners in Shenyang and the newspapers they read are purely one-sided propaganda by the Japanese. News from the vicinity of Liaoning and the interior has been completely cut off. Except for a few laborers in the streets, ordinary residents and merchants are closing their doors and shops, and there are hardly any pedestrians on the road. Food is particularly scarce, so grain prices have soared. Koreans and poor people took the opportunity to loot grain stores. The clothes and property of the military and political leaders, except for those who escaped or were captured or watched by the Japanese army, were also looted. Therefore, the military and political leaders, wealthy gentlemen, and rich families who are now stranded and hiding in Shenyang are not only without clothes and food, but also have no homes to return to. Zang Shiyi is still being monitored. Fu Baoheng, who was newly promoted to the post of Shenhai general manager, disguised himself as a servant, wearing coarse clothes, and walking hastily in the streets. Some people have seen him. Zhang Xueliang's private residence contained many antiques and utensils, and the loss this time is incalculable. The Dongsan Sheng Official Silver House is the only treasury of the three provinces. Although the first vault has not been damaged, it is difficult to preserve the credibility. In addition, the total loss of the arsenal, mortar factory, aircraft factory, and various public and private institutions is at least 200 million. There were rumors of the Japanese army's actions beforehand, and the Japanese army had also worked hard to transport military equipment in preparation. Therefore, once it broke out, whether it was soldiers in the countryside or self-defense youth groups, although their clothing was different, their guns and weapons were well-equipped. Their intentions were not just for one morning or evening. There were also many preparations along the South Manchurian Railway. The defensive works near the South Manchurian Railway Station had been completed long ago. However, on the Chinese side, it was not expected that they would suddenly take this action. It was heard that the day before the Japanese army launched the attack, they declared to the outside world that banditry was rampant along the South Manchurian Railway and that the Chinese government was unable to eliminate it, so Japan had to send troops on its own. Based on this, Rong Zhen urgently telegraphed Vice Commander Zhang to ask for instructions. Zhang immediately replied, ordering Rong to quickly send troops to do his best to eliminate the bandits, so as not to give others an excuse. In fact, the Japanese used this as a pretext to secretly send troops to Shenyang. Therefore, when Zhang's telegram arrived in Shenyang and the translation was completed and reviewed by Rong, the city had already fallen. According to the Japanese side, the military force dispatched this time, in addition to the garrison and the Second Division, the total number of self-defense corps and youth groups organized by soldiers in the countryside reached more than 20,000, while the Shenyang National Army had only one brigade. Who would believe that the incident was started by us? Moreover, the National Army offered no resistance and tried its best to retreat, which further proves that there was no intention of being hostile to Japan. Although the Japanese fabricated evidence that the Liutiao Railway Bridge was destroyed by the Chinese army, the world can see the truth at a glance, and it will be self-defeating. In the end, it will only expose their hypocrisy.</p>
<p>What Foreigners Witnessed:</p>
<h3>The Situation of Shenyang Being Occupied</h3>
<p>The Whole Incident Was Pre-Arranged by the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Even the Japanese Do Not Believe the Story of Chinese Soldiers Destroying the Road</p>
<p>The report from the Reuters Shenyang correspondent on September 19th on the Japanese army occupying Shenyang is as follows: "At about 11:15 p.m. on the 18th, the Japanese artillery began to bombard the Shenyang Airport and fired at Beidaying, which is about seven kilometers north of Shenyang. The Japanese artillery was in the Japanese concession near the railway station (i.e., the South Manchurian Railway Affiliated Area). The artillery fire was not very fierce, only firing one shell every five minutes. Before midnight, Japanese soldiers began to enter the Chinese city, fighting slightly with the Chinese police in several places. At that time, the Shenyang Club in the public concession (i.e., the Commercial Port Area) was holding a dance party. Several machine gun bullets penetrated the club's building, and many cars outside the door were destroyed. A Chinese named Han, who was a high-ranking military officer (i.e., Han Yunpeng, who once served as the garrison commander of Koubei), was passing by in a car and was hit by a bullet outside the club. The driver died on the spot, and Han was seriously injured and sent to a German doctor's house here. He died of his injuries the next morning. During the night, Japanese soldiers gradually occupied Shenyang City, paying particular attention to occupying the radio station, the Bank of China, the two arsenals, and the airport. The guards of the trenches and mortar factory (i.e., the mortar factory) resisted slightly, causing many of them to be killed. Many workers also died, because the workers' dormitories were next to the factory. The reporter sent a telegram to the Chinese Telegraph Bureau at midnight, which was accepted at the time, but returned the next day, saying that the wires had been cut off. The Japanese Telegraph Bureau is located in the Japanese concession. Because the situation was chaotic, it was impossible to enter the Japanese concession at night. Around 1:00 a.m. on Saturday, the 19th, the artillery fire stopped, but the sound of rifles was occasionally heard, probably due to occasional conflicts between Japanese soldiers and Chinese police in various places. On the morning of the 19th, Japanese soldiers were everywhere, as well as many armed plainclothes Japanese. The Japanese Consulate issued a formal announcement, saying that Chinese soldiers had bombed and destroyed the South Manchurian Railway in Beidaying, so the Japanese army took this action. Even the Japanese themselves do not believe this statement, because the whole incident was obviously pre-arranged. The Japanese consul stated that this statement was the official statement of the military, and the consulate had no knowledge of it at first, and only learned of it after it had become a fait accompli. On the morning of the 19th, Beidaying was seen on fire and is now almost completely destroyed. There is a gunpowder depot near Beidaying, which seems to be well protected. It was heard that a shell in the Shenyang Arsenal exploded in the workers' dormitory, killing many workers. During the day, everything was quiet on the streets. The Japanese police have occupied the Chinese police station, and the Japanese soldiers have occupied various key locations. In the evening, YMCA Secretary Yan Baoluo and several representatives went to the Japanese Consulate to discuss protecting the people, worrying that the thousands of workers in the Shenyang Arsenal whose wages were not paid and the soldiers who were driven out of Beidaying without restraint might cause incidents. As for whether the section of the South Manchurian Railway said to have been bombed and destroyed by Chinese soldiers by the Japanese officials is true, the reporter only said that this kind of damage was not very large, because the train had resumed traffic yesterday morning."</p>

<h3>Tranquility in Qingdao City</h3>
<p>Qingdao communication: Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied Shenyang, there have been rumors that Japanese warships will come to Qingdao, and the atmosphere has suddenly become tense. However, the market in recent days has been as peaceful as usual. The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>City Government: The city government authorities, because there are so many Japanese residents in the city, are deeply afraid that the citizens will be motivated by righteous indignation, which will be used as an excuse by the Japanese side. Therefore, an emergency municipal meeting was convened the day before yesterday to discuss ways to maintain public security. It was decided that (1) the Public Security Bureau should strictly protect the Japanese residents in Qingdao; (2) the Public Security Bureau should pay attention to protecting the safety of foreign nationals of all countries at any time; (3) the citizens should be earnestly advised to maintain order and remain calm. At the same time, personnel were sent to negotiate with the Japanese consul to order the Japanese residents not to create incidents on purpose so as to avoid unexpected accidents.</p>
<p>Navy: The Northeast Navy stationed in this city currently has three ships: Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohe. (The Jiangli ship is currently under orders to go to Shijiu Island and other places to suppress bandits.) Ling Xiao, commander of the First Fleet, is in Qingdao to coordinate everything. Sakai, the Japanese military attaché in Qingdao, went to the naval headquarters yesterday and the day before yesterday, requesting the navy to take measures to maintain public security in Qingdao and pay attention to protecting Japanese residents. The department replied that Qingdao's public security is currently very peaceful, and it will do its best to protect Japanese residents. Gao Fenghua, director of the naval arsenal, returned to Qingdao today (the 22nd) from Liaoning. According to him, Commander Shen Honglie is now in Shenyang, and the Second Fleet has very strict security precautions around Changshan Island.</p>
<p>Finance: Since receiving the news of the Shenyang Incident, merchants and people in Qingdao have been filled with righteous indignation, but they have all tried to remain calm. Therefore, the market has not seen any signs of unease, and all transactions are listed as usual. However, gold prices have been greatly affected and have fallen sharply in recent days. The Japanese gold ticket has fallen from 43 yuan (43 yuan of Japanese gold ticket can be exchanged for 100 yuan of national currency) to 57 yuan and six cents. According to the situation, it still has a downward trend. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Hubei National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>People from All Walks of Life in Wuhan Organize a National Salvation Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Wuhan people from all walks of life have seen that the famous cities of Liaoning and Jilin provinces have been successively occupied by the Japanese army, and the country will be destroyed soon. They are urgently rising up to launch an anti-Japanese national salvation movement. The National Salvation Association has now been established, gathering representatives of people from all walks of life to actively carry out activities. The citizens of Hankou have organized a volunteer army. At the same time, students from the Army Military Officer Branch School and the fortress troops jointly held a large anti-Japanese demonstration, wading through the water, not avoiding hardships. The generals of the Tenth Army, led by Xu Yuanquan, have also petitioned to be the vanguard, which shows where righteous indignation lies, and people share the same heart. The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The National Salvation Association Is Officially Established: After two days of preparation, various articles of association and rules have been drafted. At 2 p.m. on the 23rd, the inaugural meeting was held in the Provincial Party Headquarters. Those present included Zuo Duo, Wang Xianfang, Yang Zaichun, Yu Yuzhi from the Provincial Party Headquarters, Wu Qiyun, Li Yizhong, Shan Chengyi, Xiao Ruoxu from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Lou Botang, Zeng Juexian from the Pinghan Railway Special Party Headquarters, Gao Bochang and He Wenbing from the business community, Wang Jinxia, Li Kaichen, Hu Shumin, Guo Jianbing from the labor union, Tian Zhongyu from the farmers' association, Tong Xinkui, Hu Bohan, Zheng Zunfang, Wu Yuxian from the academic community, and Xiao Ruoxu, Bi Chengjun, Shen Kaihuan, Cao Yinzhi, Liu Jingzai, Li Yaoqing, etc. from the press. Zuo Duo presided over the meeting and reported on the preparation process. Then Li Yizhong explained the articles of the organizational outline, which were immediately revised and passed. Zuo Duo, Wu Qiyun, Gao Bochang, Wang Jinxia, and Xiang Xinkui were elected as standing committee members, and work began immediately. The address of the association was decided to be in the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Citizens of Hankou Organize a Volunteer Army: In addition to participating in the work of the National Salvation Association, the people from all walks of life in Hankou will also organize a National Salvation Volunteer Army to prepare for a declaration of war against Japan. A meeting was held at the Municipal Party Headquarters on the 23rd to decide on six anti-Japanese measures: (1) All sectors should organize propaganda teams separately and set off for speeches immediately; (2) Make cloth slogans and wear them on the body, with the words "The Japanese army has come to kill us! Compatriots, unite to save the country!" and other eighteen characters; (3) All civil organizations and party departments in each district should separately telegraph their opposition to Japan and issue an anti-Japanese declaration; (4) Each district party department and each civil organization should separately handle the registration of the National Salvation Volunteer Army and convene its establishment by a certain date; (5) Request the National Salvation Association to implement a non-cooperation movement against Japan immediately; (6) Telegraph opposition to Japan and ask the central government to actively prepare.</p>
<p>Military School Students Hold a Large Demonstration: All the students of the Wuhan Branch of the Central Military Academy held a large anti-Japanese demonstration in Wuchang on the 22nd and organized a propaganda team to set off for Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou for on-site publicity. On the 23rd, they rejoined the armed comrades of the Third and Fourth Regiments of the Wuhan Fortress Command, a total of more than 6,000 people, and continued to hold demonstrations. At 8 a.m., they set off from the school, passed through Dachao Street to the Hanyangmen Pier, took a ferry across the river, gathered at a pier, marched in formation from the Jianghan Customs, passed through Fuchang Street and Baohua Street in Special District 3 to the Commander-in-Chief's camp, turned to Baoheli, entered Zhongshan Road Liudaoqiao, then turned to Minquan Road, entered Dongjiaxiang, and arrived at Wangjiaxiang. They took a ferry across the river and returned to school. They waded through the water all the way, and although the accumulated water was knee-deep, the order was extremely serious. (September 23rd)</p>
<p>Third International</p>
<h3>Conspiracy with Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>(Continued from part 10)</p>
<p>The objective causes of this symptom are due to the enemy's continuous oppression. However, the real reasons are the remnants of Li Lisan's advocacy of war and the influence of right-leaning opportunism. Some people become shaken or shrink back due to the arduousness of the work. Others still apply old working methods or preconceived notions, believing that the difficulties of the work prove the infeasibility of the plan. They completely fail to understand that the current difficulties are inevitable challenges on the road to prosperity. Therefore, they entirely neglect the new foundation for the transformation of work decided by the Fourth Congress, and further lack the courage to use new working methods to overcome the arduous progress of the work. They merely nurture ideas of cancellation and do not study the various reasons for the difficulties in the work. They only shout empty slogans about the transformation of work. The inevitable result is that the authorities are unable to vigorously promote the planned new working methods to replace the old ones. Therefore, if we want to seek the smooth progress of our work in the future, we must fiercely struggle against the above-mentioned shortcomings before we can succeed.</p>
<p>Recently, the important organizational work of the whole country, including the fundamental transformation of the work, has been clearly stipulated in the spirit of the Fourth Congress. In particular, the intensification of the struggle to eliminate right-leaning tendencies is important.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, the main right-leaning dangers must be explained, and Li Lisan's theory should also be eliminated. Furthermore, loyal laborers and farmers should be absorbed into the cadre. Guide workers to eliminate opportunism in the course of their work. Lead the agile connection in the work. So that we can be truly prepared. Even the drawbacks of the old working methods must be overcome completely. The appointment system must also be corrected. The leaders of the various party departments must be established on a sound foundation. Industrial groups in large industrial areas should be organized as soon as possible. The party department will supervise party departments at all levels in the near future and earnestly implement the resolutions of the Central Committee to achieve the great transformation of the social structure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must also pay attention to the work in the central agricultural areas, especially the white areas adjacent to the Soviet areas (i.e., the areas that have not been reddened). As for within the Soviet areas, we must pay attention to testing the foundation and achievements of our party's work, thoroughly purging the rich peasants from the party, and establishing the party's foundation on the proletariat and poor peasants. The recent development of the Soviet movement and the oppression of counter-revolutionary forces make us pay more attention to secret work. Only then can our party organization operate smoothly anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>In order to realize the work stipulated by the Central Committee, all party departments at all levels must have extremely close contact with the following items, and must think about specific work plans and strive to implement these resolutions. (1) In order to implement all the work after the transformation, the party department must distribute the aforementioned work guidelines through circulars, and strictly stipulate the system of guiding the work. At the same time, eliminate the appointment system and strictly enforce the discipline of party departments at all levels.</p>
<p>The educational guidance work of each province must be carried out by the provincial committees, district groups, and party workers directly. In educational guidance work, unless there is a system of practical criticism, the organization in the area will have a certain benefit, then we can create a strong organization of cadres, establish the central core in the labor party, and formulate various leadership disciplines with the Central Committee.</p>
<p>(2) The development of the revolution requires us to have a thorough solution to the cadre problem. The most important mission is for party departments at all levels to clearly understand the true meaning of cadres, expose the past incorrect misunderstandings about cadres, and point out specific plans for forming new cadres. Especially, the most important method regarding labor cadres is the application of the organizational division of labor method.</p>
<p>Local branches and groups must correct their irresponsible mistakes regarding cadres, and must constantly intensify personal work among activists in industrial areas in order to absorb labor cadres. Only in this way can the local party department be prompted to request the Central Committee to send "cadres." (3) Group work must undergo a thorough transformation. Central groups in industrial areas must also be established in various provinces. We must find ways to work hard in factories and support the development of trade union organizations. Groups must undoubtedly become the link between the party and the masses. Under any circumstances, there must be a fixed foundation. Groups must absorb all mass organizations in factories, and the drawbacks of the past, which did not have close relations with the masses, must be urgently corrected.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the organization of the countryside, we must pre-select several central agricultural areas so that rural groups can be formed accordingly. The party's strength is entrusted here. At the same time, comrades working in the city should be sent to the countryside to lead.</p>
<p>The vast middle peasants should also be organized around the rural groups, but they are not allowed to be mixed into the party's organization.</p>
<p>(5) Local branches must change their previous management methods. Senior party departments must distribute a large number of comrades to various places so that they can form large party groups there to serve as leading agencies, connect with industrial area groups, and then distribute party members to work in various factories.</p>
<p>Comrades who do leading work must join the factory to work as much as possible (just like workers). At the same time, comrades who work in the factory must fulfill their guiding responsibilities to the local organs. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Popular Anti-Japanese Rally in All Circles. Since the Northeast Incident, all circles in Wu and Su have been extremely indignant. Yesterday (25th), a popular rally was held at the Public Stadium, attended by approximately 10,000 people from military, police, academic, and other circles. The Gendarmerie Regiment maintained order at the venue. After Chairman Zhou Shanfu held the opening ceremony, Regiment Commander Jin and others gave impassioned speeches. Two Japanese were present at the venue. Fearing that popular anger would be aroused and cause incidents, the military and police advised them to leave the venue. Although there were many people at the venue that day, the order was well maintained.</p>
<p>Reorganization of City and Township Residential Housing Tax. The Wu County city and township residential housing tax has been in arrears for as long as four or five months since it was implemented. Now, Finance Bureau Director Shen has invited representatives from various agencies, organizations, and gentry to organize a Housing Tax Reorganization Committee to carry out reorganization. Yesterday (25th), a meeting was held and it was resolved: (1) Fifteen investigators will be appointed separately by various legal entities; (2) When the investigators set out, the Finance Bureau will prepare symbols to be distributed for them to wear; (3) It is scheduled to start the investigation on October 6; (4) When the investigators set out, the Public Security Bureau will be asked to send household police officers to assist.</p>
<p>Establishment of Temporary Police Station. Yesterday (25th), the Wu County Public Security Bureau ordered the Third Branch to add one patrol leader, eight police officers, and one cook near the transformer substation of the electric plant outside Panmen (next to the Japanese concession) to establish the Third Temporary Police Station of the First Sub-Station of the Third Branch. At the same time, it sent another letter to the County Police Team, stating that recently, popular sentiment has been aroused, which can easily lead to misunderstandings. It requested to send two patrol boats to be stationed at Mudu Bridge to protect Japanese residents. At the same time, it ordered the sub-stations of the Third Branch to strengthen liaison and vigilance.</p>

<p>Petition to Exempt Cocoon Surtax. The case of resuming the collection of the cocoon surtax was previously resolved by the 20th District Chiefs' Conference, and the county government was to negotiate with the Cocoon Industry Association for handling. This cocoon surtax has always been allocated to the expenses of the breeding area public office. Now, the funds in each district are extremely depleted. County Magistrate Chen Chuande once sent a public letter to the Cocoon Industry Association regarding the conference situation, urging them to quickly notify all cocoon merchants to donate as before in order to maintain autonomy. After receiving the letter, Chairman Hua Shaochun stated that the local cocoon surtax has always been levied along with the silk cocoon tax. Now that the government has clearly ordered the abolition of the silk cocoon tax, the surtax is naturally not a problem. Under the circumstances of consecutive years of failure in the cocoon industry, merchants are enduringly operating with pain, unable to stop. In terms of the actual situation, they are even more unable to overcome it. Therefore, yesterday, he reported the situation to the county government, requesting that the exemption be continued.</p>
<p>Rice from Jiangsu is Allowed to Circulate within the Province. The Jiangsu Provincial Government stated that this year, the floods in Jiangsu Province are extremely severe. Each county, in terms of the relationship between grain and people's food, is often acting in rice hoarding. In rice-producing counties, it is harmless. However, in counties that produce little rice or do not produce rice, it will affect people's food and cause panic. It has been found that the rice ban in Jiangsu Province is to prohibit private transport out of the province. If it is within the province, it should still be allowed to circulate as usual. If rice is prohibited from being transported out of the county due to high rice prices, it will lead to inflexible transportation and business stagnation, which is not a proper solution. It should be strictly prohibited to maintain people's food. Yesterday, a special order was issued to all counties to comply. From now on, all rice and grain within the province will still be allowed to circulate as usual, in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>The Business Community is Actively Anti-Japanese. After the news of the incident in the Eastern Provinces spread to various places, all circles in Xi were extremely nervous about the work of resisting Japan and saving the country. The economic severance of relations with Japan is being carried out with particular effort. The County Chamber of Commerce held another emergency meeting at 1:00 p.m. yesterday (25th) to inspect enemy goods. It was resolved that all industries related to enemy goods should quickly have their goods in the store strictly inspected by the trade association. If any Japanese goods are found, they should be sealed separately and not allowed to be sold again. A register should be made and reported to the association within a time limit. If any trade member violates public opinion, does not inspect in time, or still privately sells enemy goods, the trade association will investigate and report to the anti-Japanese and national salvation association of all circles for severe sanctions by the public.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Silk Factory Association. The Silk Factory Association held an emergency meeting of its members yesterday. After the chairman reported that the factories were unable to start production after receiving public bonds and that disputes had arisen repeatedly, it was resolved that the public bonds for relief were to relieve factories that failed in business in the 19th year. The original plan at that time was for the industry to borrow and repay together, nominally for relief, but in reality, it was to be repaid by the industry. Now, someone has accused the factories that received public bonds but were unable to start production to the county. The trade association should issue a statement on its behalf based on the original plan.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Japanese Warships Actually Came to Zhenjiang to be on Alert. Since the important cities of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang were forcibly occupied by the Japanese army, the public's anger has been unprecedented in previous anti-Japanese movements. Unexpectedly, the provincial capital is in an atmosphere of anti-Japanese tension, and there are not many Japanese residents in Zhenjiang. The Japanese shallow-water warship "Atami" suddenly sailed upstream the night before yesterday, mooring at the Osaka Company, pontoon pier. Eight Japanese soldiers were sent to set up guard lines at both ends of the Nissin Company on Zheng Bridge, and they used the largest flashlight to search in all directions. For a time, people nearby were not allowed to pass, and everyone was alarmed and lost their color until dawn before returning to the ship to rest. Yesterday, they lined up and landed again, parading along the river for a week. In the afternoon, the ship began to move to the middle of the river.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>After the Flood, Banditry Followed. After the dyke burst in this county, the entire county became a swamp. Now the water has slightly subsided, and bandits have taken the opportunity to rise up again. They have gathered three or four hundred people, entrenched in the Zhazuosijia area in the eastern countryside. Half of them are wearing irregular military uniforms, all of them are old troops of Ma Yuren. They have sufficient guns and ammunition and do whatever they want, including burning, robbing, and kidnapping. The villages in the eastern countryside are all being ravaged by them. The wealthy have moved away in droves. After the Gaobao Youxun team leader Zhao Huchen and others reported, they immediately led the second team leader Liu Changzhen and patrol officer Hu Shaoqing on the morning of the 17th, together with the special team leader of the Sixth Water Police District, to lead the team to the bandit area to suppress them. At 5 a.m. on the 18th, they arrived at Zhazuo Town and met the bandits. They immediately opened fire and fought fiercely until 2 p.m. The bandit forces could not withstand it and began to withdraw from Zhazuo. In this battle, the bandit side suffered more than 20 casualties. Two young kidnapped victims were rescued. Three female bandits, Wang Sunshi, Xia Wangshi, and Ren Gaoshi, were captured. Four private salt smugglers and three salt boats were also seized. The special team leader of the Sixth District and the Gaobao Youxun team police officer Xie Jiayin were all wounded by bullets. At that time, the Water Patrol Team also sent a team to join the pursuit. On the afternoon of the 21st, they chased to Wacang and opened fire on the bandits again. This battle was very fierce. The officers and soldiers were gradually unable to withstand it. Later, the Gaobao Youxun team and the police officers of the Sixth District Special Team fought to the death with the bandits until dusk, when the bandits began to withdraw from Wacang. In this battle, the bandit side suffered more than 40 casualties. The Gaobao Youxun team police officers Hu Yousheng, Xu Fengyou, and He Desheng were killed in action. Hu Yousheng's body was shot into the water and has not yet been recovered. Wang Chuanren, Ma Hongjun, Shi Xiuhai, and Chen Wensheng were also wounded. The Sixth District Special Team police officers Xiang Wenshi, Li Xinghe, and Sun Enzhong were killed in action, and Shen Zilin was wounded. Now each team is concentrating in Linze. Gao Zhongkui, the captain of the 25th team of the Sixth Township Water Police District, and Ma Ji, the first team leader of the 24th team, also led their teams there. County Magistrate Wang telegraphed Director Zhang, General Commander Liang, the Civil Affairs Department, and the Sixth Water Police District Department last night (22nd) to send troops to Gaoyou to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Assassination in Yuxian Town. At about 7:00 p.m. the night before yesterday, two people speaking with Shaoxing accents suddenly came to Shen Yuanchang Doufu Shop in the East Market of Yuxian Town, Jiaxing. They invaded the shop under the pretext of buying fried tofu. At that time, shop owner Qi Aqiao was about to have dinner with his wife and children. He was attacked on the head by the two thugs wielding pistols. As the bullets penetrated his brain, he died on the spot. His wife, Shen, was also shot, but fortunately, she was only injured in the arm and there was no danger to her life. Qiu Zeshen, the chief of the town's public security branch, heard the news and rushed to the scene with the police to pursue the suspects, but the murderers were nowhere to be found. Chief Qiu has reported to his superiors for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Staff Begins Military Training. Zhang Nanxian, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stated that Japanese soldiers have committed animalistic acts, invading the country and shooting soldiers and civilians. The people of the country are indignant. He specially proposed that the staff of the provincial government's various departments and offices should first undergo military training to prepare to jointly face the national crisis. They are divided into four groups, combined into two classes. The young and strong are in Class A, and the old, weak, women are in Class B. A first meeting was specially held in the auditorium of the provincial government at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (25th) to discuss the progress. It was stipulated that the four groups would be four major teams, each with one captain and vice-captain, and one adjutant. The team is divided into three companies, with company and platoon leaders. The training dates are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day. Everyone is armed and no longer allowed to wear long gowns. It is scheduled to start next week.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Police Academy Vows to Punish Japan. The entire faculty and students of the Zhejiang Police Academy were outraged by the news that the violent Japanese had occupied our territory and massacred our soldiers and civilians. In addition to strict training and petitioning the provincial government to go to the Northeast to vow to punish Japan, they also organized an anti-Japanese and national salvation group. They have scheduled to hold an oath ceremony and review the troops on the 28th of this month to prepare for departure to punish Japan.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Fire in Jiangdong Dongwu Dian Alley. A fire broke out in Jiangdong Dongwu Dian Alley at midnight last night. The burnt-down buildings were the Xiangsheng Bamboo Shoot Factory and the Xiangsheng Rice Store, a total of five bungalows and two alleys, worth more than 10,000 taels of silver. Together with the price of the house, it is estimated to be more than 20,000 taels of silver. It is reported that the factory did not have fire insurance. Even the factory's account books and current silver were not taken out, resulting in this great loss.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Various Circles' Indignation at Japanese Atrocities. Since Japan sent troops to our country's Northeast and occupied Shenyang, Jilin Provincial Capital and various key points, all circles in this county have been extremely indignant. On the afternoon of the 23rd, shops, schools, institutions and organizations in the urban area closed for half a day and lowered flags to half-mast in mourning. They gathered in Xianxian Temple in the rain to hold an anti-Japanese rally. It was resolved: (1) to intensify the boycott of Japanese goods; (2) to telegraph the National Government to recover the occupied territory by revolutionary means. They then gave speeches, paraded, distributed leaflets and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou</h3>
<p>Branch Bureau of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Plans to Open Duanping Route. Since Wenzhou established a branch bureau of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, merchants have been traveling back and forth, and the number of goods transported each year is very large. However, the bureau has gradually declined in previous years due to the lack of competent people. Guo Zhijun came to lead this bureau last winter and was determined to rectify it. The business is booming. It is recently heard that there is also a plan to open the Duanping route and a request has been submitted to the General Bureau for handling. It is expected to be implemented soon. Guo is from Wenzhou and has successively served as the Director of Customs, Salt Superintendency, and Donation Bureau, as well as important positions in transportation agencies. He is especially familiar with the shipping situation.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Anhui Province Liquidates Tianjin-Pukou Railway Shares to Relieve Disaster. The Anhui Provincial Government recently received a request from the Chuxian Flood Relief Association and Qin Tiean of the Qianshan Finance Bureau to transfer the accumulated salt tax principal and interest for disaster relief. They were instructed to check with the two departments of Civil Affairs and Finance. The two departments stated that the province purchased 100,000 taels of silver in official shares of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Company in the Qing Dynasty and issued 16 stock certificates, which were stored in the old Fan Treasury. The Fan Treasury was looted in 1911, and the stock certificates were lost. In 1922, former Governor Xu Shiying sent a letter to the company to verify the numbers and consulted the former Ministry of Transportation to treat them as stock certificates of the Colonial Bank, and published a statement in the newspaper that the looted stock certificates should be invalidated. The stock certificates of the Colonial Bank were publicly entrusted by the Tianjin Association to Fang Lizhong to be deposited in the safe deposit box of the Tianjin Continental Bank for safekeeping and obtained a custody certificate, which was held by Fang. In July 1929, the provincial government's standing committee resolved to recover the stock certificates and interest and hand them over to the treasury. A delegate was sent and Fang was informed to go to Tianjin together. Fang replied that due to traffic obstruction, he would do so soon. The stock certificates and interest have not been delivered. In May 1930, the Beiping Anhui Association requested to allocate the Colonial Bank stock certificates as a fund for the Beiping Middle School. The Finance Department submitted it to the provincial government's standing committee for resolution, and it was resolved to discuss it after the stock certificates were recovered. Later, it was resolved to designate it as a fund for the Beiping Anhui Middle School. Now there is a request to transfer the principal and interest for disaster relief, and it seems that Fang should be informed to report and verify it, or a committee should be sent to calculate it. Sun Qi also collected more than 10,000 yuan in interest for one year in 1912, which should also be handled together. Therefore, the two departments submitted a report to the provincial government, which was discussed and resolved on the 22nd. The stock payment has been resolved by the former provincial government and allocated to the Beiping Anhui Middle School fund. Whether the school has received it is not recorded by this government. It should be ordered that Fang Lizhong give a reply. The interest handled by Fang Lizhong, should be ordered by the provincial relief committee to send personnel to liquidate and put it forward for relief.</p>

<h3>Report on the Inspection of Disaster Areas in Northern Jiangsu by the Temporary Relief Association for the Jiangbei Flood</h3>
<p>Our association was established on August 29th, four days after the breach at Youshao expanded. Deeply aware that the collapse of the canal embankments caused the floodwaters to rush eastward, spreading across a vast area, and that the survival of the remaining population was precarious, we urgently dispatched relief teams with supplies to rescue people in the Youshao, Xingtai, and Eastern Yancheng areas.  Upon the departure of each team, Yuqiu and others were instructed that while the areas near the city were easily visible to people, remote rural areas might not have been surveyed and aided. They were to bravely venture deep in search of those in need, so that relief could be widely distributed and people could escape danger as soon as possible. To further understand the actual conditions in the disaster areas of each county, we personally conducted an inspection on the 4th of this month. On that day, after departing from Zhenjiang, we arrived in Yangzhou in the evening. The handling of relief efforts in Yangzhou was well-organized. In addition to our association setting up a branch office in Yangzhou to facilitate transportation, various relief organizations were gathered here. All believed that the Youshao breach and the overwhelming floodwaters made this the most severely affected area, and therefore the area most urgently in need of assistance. As a result, large numbers of disaster victims were transported from Youshao and other places every day. Six shelters were set up, accommodating approximately five thousand people. Relief efforts were divided, with areas two and three handled by the National Relief Association, areas four, five, and six handled by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, and areas seven, eight, nine, and four handled by the Chinese Jisheng Society. The division of labor was cooperative and the organization was tight. On the 5th, we went from Yangzhou to Quanshao.  There were a total of thirteen breaches, large and small, in the canal embankments. Areas seven and eight were the most severely affected. Shaobo was in area eight. In this area, over forty villages and towns had five to six hundred thousand people in need of relief (the entire town has a population of over one hundred thousand). The floodwaters in the town were gradually receding. A relief association was being organized to handle shelter and other matters. We met with Zhao and Wang, the principals of the town's chamber of commerce, and their proposed relief plans were very well-organized. In the afternoon, we arrived in Youyi and immediately went to inspect the canal embankments. There were many places where both the east and west embankments had collapsed. The longest breach was at Dangjunlou, over two hundred zhang in length. Fields and houses had been completely washed away by the flood. The water flowed rapidly at the breach, like ten thousand galloping horses. One could imagine the tragic deaths and displacement of people when the embankments broke. The water inside the city was still over four chi deep in places. We met with local gentry, Ma Junqing and Wang Yunzhi, who said that of the county's population of over six hundred thousand, over four hundred thousand had been affected, nearly two-thirds. This was an unprecedented catastrophe, and they spoke with great grief. At dawn on the 6th, we went from You to Shao, and directly to Xinghua. Along the way, we passed Qiaoshu Town, in Jiangdu County, where the disaster was extremely severe. According to the locals, when the water was at its deepest, only the roofs of the taller houses in the entire town were visible above the water. Everything else had collapsed and washed away. It was a vast expanse of water without end. Currently, the county was handling the evacuation of disaster victims and the statistical surveying of the situation. Further ahead, the river and sky merged into one color. The Yangjiazhuang weitian fields were completely submerged. Many disaster victims gathered on the broken embankments. When they saw a boat passing, they cried out for relief. The scene was heartbreaking and unbearable to witness. Most of the buildings in the Zhenwu Temple had collapsed. Good farmland had been transformed into lakes. Yong'an Town was the same. The Fancha Town under the jurisdiction of You and Tai counties, and the surrounding fields, were also in the water. Because of the location of the small boat's passage, looking down into the water, new greenery was often submerged below. This new greenery was all ripe rice fields, which had not yet been harvested. After being submerged in water, new shoots emerged, so the small boat drivers could not distinguish whether they were navigating on a river, a field, or a small embankment. They often ran aground, causing great difficulty. By the time we arrived at the city of Xinghua, it was already dusk. We then changed to a ferry and entered the city. We met with County Magistrate Hua, as well as Gu, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, and Shi and Wu, the standing committee members of the emergency relief association. They said that the county had suffered from drought for three consecutive years, and this year it had suffered from flooding. All the towns and villages in the county were in the water. Approximately twenty thousand qing of fields and a population of six hundred thousand had all suffered in this disaster, without exception. A relief and famine association had been formed, but only over eight hundred disaster victims had been evacuated. Relief was urgently needed. Because Xinghua is located in a low-lying area and is at the tail end of the drainage system, the severity of the disaster was equal to that of Youshao. On the morning of the 7th, we planned to go from Xinghua to Yancheng. The riverways were vast, and it was impossible to distinguish east from west. We reluctantly traveled over twenty li, and even with the help of local people, we could not determine the navigation route. We had to turn back halfway and change course to Taizhou. We passed through Yiling Town (the sixth district of Jiangdu County) and met with the district head, who said that forty-six villages and towns in the district, thirty of which were severely affected. The town was located east of Shaobo, and suffered from the flooding caused by the breach at Dawangmiao. On the 8th, we arrived in Tai, where our branch office in Taizhou had already been organized and was busy handling relief efforts in Xingtai and other places. Ten shelters had been set up in Taizhou, accommodating approximately six thousand disaster victims, most of whom came from Xinghua. Two-thirds of the villages and towns in Taizhou County itself had also been affected. At noon on the 8th, we went from Tai to Dongtai and arrived the next morning. The county is located on the Fandi embankment. The disaster was most severe west of the embankment, where the water depth in the countryside reached over one zhang. East of the embankment, there were also many breaches in the Fandi embankment, so the streets were submerged. According to the county's chamber of commerce, of the county's population of one million one hundred and forty thousand, only Anfeng and Jiaoxie districts were unaffected. The rest were almost entirely affected by this disaster. Relief measures included setting up shelters and soup kitchens. Due to a shortage of boats, disaster victims could not be evacuated out of the area. In the afternoon of the 9th, we planned to go from Dongtai to Yancheng. After passing Baigu, we traveled to Liuzhuang, but the bridge was difficult to cross due to the high water level, making it impossible to proceed. Furthermore, we were summoned by telegram from the provincial government to attend the post-disaster committee meeting for the canal project. We had to return to Dongtai. We heard that the disaster in Yancheng was also very serious. It was estimated that all one hundred and forty weitian embankments in the entire area had collapsed. The floodwaters had overflowed the Fandi embankment by several chi, sweeping away people, livestock, and possessions. The tortuous harbor channels made drainage difficult, so the water level continued to rise. Youshao suffered from the direct impact of the breach, while Xingtai, Dongtai, and Yancheng suffered from the accumulation of water flowing eastward. The severity of the disaster was equal in all the places we visited. We only regretted that we were unable to personally visit the remote disaster areas. On the 10th, we went from Dongtai to Tai, and on the morning of the 11th, we crossed the river from Yangzhou and returned to Zhenjiang. The above is only a rough account of what Yuqiu and others saw in a short period of time. The painful impression of the disaster areas will likely be indelible in our minds. We would like to present our thoughts after the inspection to the public: (1) In summary, during this inspection, we passed through Youshao, Xingtai, Dongtai, and Yancheng. Except for the relatively high broken embankments, remnants of houses, and floating treetops, the surrounding thousands of li were all water. As a result, disaster victims were either perched in trees, floating on basins, or had waited for assistance without success. Some even wrote the words "Please collect my corpse" on paper and tied it to their lapels. Everywhere our boats passed, such scenes were visible. For the sake of the lives of these millions of disaster victims, our most urgent task is to transport food to the affected areas. We must also consider the problems of clothing and shelter, which are also extremely important. As autumn is approaching, the preparation of cotton clothing is urgently needed. In addition to the substantial preparations made by various relief organizations, our association alone needs at least two hundred thousand sets to be sufficient. As for the problem of shelter, further study is necessary. Because the number of disaster victims has reached over four million, even if each county accommodates the maximum number, accommodating twenty thousand people per county, then running shelters in ten counties can only accommodate two hundred thousand people. Compared to the total number of disaster victims, only a very small number can be accommodated. This is something that we ask the public to carefully consider for the aftermath. (2) During this tour of the counties, we observed that the local people in each county were at a loss due to the sudden disaster. In addition to sending telegrams requesting relief, they were also organizing relief agencies internally, but their strength was very weak. Furthermore, there were issues related to relief, such as public security and banditry in the disaster areas. We have investigated that the public security expenses of each county were previously paid by the local government. In the current situation after the disaster, local revenue will be insufficient. The provincial government should pay special attention to this, so that public security in the affected counties is not affected by funding issues. In recent days, bandit boats have been spotted in the four townships of Gaoyou. They are in groups of dozens, drifting aimlessly, taking advantage of the displacement and danger of disaster victims, and obstructing relief transportation. This is the second thing that we ask the public to carefully consider for the aftermath. (3) Regarding the post-disaster problems in the disaster areas, the priority is to plan for the food and shelter of the disaster victims. However, if we only focus on the present and do not consider the fundamental problems, there may be future troubles. We should focus on projects such as guiding the Huai River, dredging the canal, and dredging the waterways in the flooded areas. On the one hand, this can provide work for the majority of disaster victims to temporarily maintain their livelihoods. On the other hand, it can ensure that the rivers and canals can drain, and that flooding is permanently eliminated. We must also consider providing seeds for cultivation. This is the third thing that we ask the public to carefully consider for the aftermath. What we have presented is only a brief account of the thoughts of Yuqiu and others after the inspection. As for the breadth and severity of the disaster areas in northern Jiangsu, all post-disaster solutions depend on the unity and cooperation of all levels. If Yuqiu and others have any further foolish ideas, we will continue to present them to the public. Leng Yuqiu, Lu Xiaobo</p>
<p>Special Coverage of Education News</p>
<h3>A Warning to the Education Community Regarding Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>(1) Shu Xincheng</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, Japan used the so-called "Nakamura Incident" as a pretext to suddenly occupy Shenyang by force. Over the past week, they have continued to advance, destroying our military camps and schools, seizing our national officials, massacring our people, looting our property, and even burning down our arsenal, which we have been operating for decades. As of yesterday, all the important areas near Shenyang have been invaded, and Jilin has also been occupied. This kind of brutal action by Japan, disregarding justice, is unprecedented in the history of human civilization. Anyone with a human face must gnash their teeth, let alone our citizens whose bodies are being trampled on, and even more so our education community, who leads the masses. It is our natural and unavoidable duty as citizens and educators to be filled with righteous indignation and strive for legitimate defense.</p>
<p>Facing the great disaster of national subjugation, it is natural that we are stimulated and excited, and that our actions are passionate due to our excitement. However, if we sincerely want to avenge ourselves, it cannot be achieved through momentary anger or rash courage. It cannot be achieved by shouting slogans or pasting posters. Leaving aside the superficial topic and political background of Japan's atrocities, the fact that they dare to do this proves that they have been worrying and planning for a long time, and have been preparing for a long time. (Tianaka Giichi's presentation to the throne on July 25, Showa 2, on an aggressive policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia, explained this in detail. They have been plotting aggressive invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia even before annexing Korea. They originally used the so-called problem of survival as a pretext, saying that Japan's mainland only has a few large islands and dozens of small islands, and there are often irresistible earthquakes. For the sake of safety, they have no choice but to seek a foothold on the mainland. In the past ten years or so, Japan's population has surged, with a surplus of over eight hundred thousand people per year who have nowhere to settle. To solve their population problem, they have no choice but to seek development on the mainland. The most convenient and fertile part of the mainland for them is what they call Manchuria and Mongolia, (including the three eastern provinces and Inner and Outer Mongolia). However, Manchuria and Mongolia are ultimately our country's Manchuria and Mongolia, and this kind of pretext cannot justify their unjustifiable invasion. Relying on this completely unreasonable pretext, they are in fact advancing step by step. On the one hand, they are using Koreans as their vanguard, transplanting them to Manchuria and Mongolia, and using Japanese from the mainland as their rearguard to transplant them to Korea. On the other hand, they are sparing no effort in the political, economic, and construction work of Manchuria and Mongolia, in order to achieve their conspiracy to conquer East Asia and conquer the world (both in Tanaka's words). In education, they are simultaneously instilling their so-called Manchuria and Mongolia policy in the general public. The Imperial University has specifically published Yano's fallacy that Manchuria and Mongolia are not Chinese territories, in order to incite their people's ambition. (In Japan, whether it is primary school students or middle school students, if you ask them about the map of Japan, they will definitely include Manchuria and Mongolia. When someone mentions the Manchuria and Mongolia issue, they all have a sense of hatred and solidarity. This is what the author personally experienced in Japan last year.) In the past, it was only because the authorities in our three northeastern provinces were indifferent and allowed them to be slaughtered, that there were no atrocities. Recently, people in the Northeast, seeing the rapid progress of their political and economic aggression, and seeing the disaster of national subjugation impending, have been determined to resist with strength. The successful construction of the Fenghai Railway and the Huludao port are probably the reasons why they cannot help but expose their ambitions. With this motive, they had no time to care about the morality of providing disaster relief and helping neighbors. They took advantage of the time when our country was suffering from a natural disaster and took this brutal action.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that Japan's plot to seize our Manchuria and Mongolia is not accidental. It is a premeditated plot with long-term preparation. As for the main reason for attracting them to plot against our Manchuria and Mongolia, those Japanese claims of geographical defects and the unsolvable population problem are all pretexts to deceive the countries of the world. The real reason is that our country does not pay enough attention to and does not manage Manchuria and Mongolia well. As the saying goes, "A hole invites the wind."</p>
<p>We know that Japan's invasion of our Manchuria and Mongolia is a premeditated affair, and that the invasion is being carried out with long-term preparation. Our response must not be regarded as an accidental matter, but must be treated as a permanent affair.</p>
<p>In the face of this great disaster, all citizens will feel great excitement, and young people are full of blood and energy, and their excitement is even greater. If there is no proper guidance, public sentiment may be misused and will not help the matter. What we need now is an organized and planned approach, a spirit that can last and be contained, rather than a rash action of five minutes of fever. Therefore, I would like to offer the following humble suggestions to the members of the education community:</p>

<p>Telegram to the National Government The Nanjing National Government, Japan took advantage of our unpreparedness like a tiger or wolf, and suddenly attacked Shenyang, destroying our cities, trampling on our land, seizing our military equipment, and slaughtering our soldiers and civilians. They acted like pigs and foxes, with no humanity. And the Northeast authorities failed to prevent and mitigate the disaster before it happened, and failed to bravely lead the soldiers after it happened. The Divine Land of China has become a foreign land, and the noble descendants of Yan and Huang have become slaves. At this time, all who have blood and energy are indignant. The beautiful rivers and mountains cannot be allowed to be shattered. Although the country is weak, the hearts of the people are still there. Rather than seeing the country perish day by day, it is better to rise up and fight to the death with the Japanese. If we break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and everyone is determined to die, we can use this morale to resist their ferocity. Victory or defeat is not easy to predict. Our government has been entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the people. We ask that you quickly issue military orders, gather our righteous army, take up arms and advance to recover our territory, comfort our people, and strictly order the Northeast generals to organize their troops, serve on the frontier, redeem themselves through meritorious service, and thank the world. If there are those who retreat in fear of the enemy, or secretly negotiate with Japan for a partial settlement, not hesitating to fawn on the enemy to seek survival, we the people will abandon them. We, the people of the Shanghai education community, pledge to lead the eight thousand children of Jiangdong to be a strong and powerful support for our government.

<h3>Universities Ask the Government to Announce a Policy</h3>
<p>Otherwise, They Will Act in Concert with the Students</p>
<p>| Classes Will Resume as Usual Starting Next Week</p>
<p>The ten universities in Shanghai held a meeting yesterday to discuss anti-Japanese national salvation. Representatives Rong Qizhao, Hu Qibing (Guanghua), Chu Fucheng (Law School), Jin Tongyin (Fudan), Zeng Shuodu (Daxia), Zhu Fuding (Law and Politics), He Shixiao (Chizhi), Ou Yuanhuai (Daxia), Liu Zhanen (Shanghai), Pan Gongzhan (Zhonggong), and Sheng Genwei (Soochow Law School) attended. Important cases were resolved: 1. All schools will suspend classes this Saturday to allow students to participate in the civic assembly. 2. Classes will resume as usual starting next week. If the government does not have concrete measures within a considerable period of time, the school authorities will have no choice but to act in concert with the students. 3. The Soochow Law School will convene another meeting next Monday. 4. The above schools will jointly send a telegram to the National Government, requesting the government to announce an anti-Japanese policy as soon as possible to quell public outrage. 5. The Soochow Law School was asked to draft a telegram to American universities, requesting them to urge the government to uphold justice and maintain world peace. The telegram has been drafted by Dr. Wu Jingxiong, and will be sent out by university professors Wu Jingxiong, Liu Zhanen, and others in the near future. The main idea of the original telegram is that Japan's dispatch of troops and occupation of the three eastern provinces is a violation of international conventions. The entire Chinese nation is indignant. The League of Nations and your government have already made fair statements. We, as leaders of the intellectual community, must do our best to publicize the truth of this matter and uphold justice, so that those who use force to invade will be warned, and world peace can be maintained.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Promotes Anti-Japanese Propaganda</h3>

<h3>Jinan University Students Go to the Countryside to Give Speeches</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jinan University launched the National Anti-Japanese Salvation Campaign: (1) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Jinan University's school workers went to the countryside to give speeches in three teams in the afternoon, led by Yuan Jinqing and others. (2) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Jinan People's School also set off to conduct propaganda in three teams. The audience was very large and all harbored deep hatred.

(4) The Sino-Japanese Problem Discussion Meeting was held at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and there were also important discussions.</p>
<p>Labor University The school's anti-Japanese national salvation movement was launched the earliest with the cooperation of teachers and students.

At each general assembly, Director Liu Yu and Chairman Fan Zhengbo presided, with Director of General Affairs Lin Tongshi, Secretary Wu Changtao, Dean Tang Ying, Factory Director Li Yingbiao, and all faculty, staff, and students attending. Important cases included the formulation of a declaration, which was translated into various languages by the school's English, French, German, and Japanese teachers, to vigorously publicize to the international community, and the determination of a propaganda outline and methods for economic disconnection with the barbaric Japanese. The twelve creeds of joint observance proposed by Zhang Yuanruo, dean of the school's College of Social Sciences, were particularly fatal to the Japanese.</p>
<p>Cultural College The students of the Cultural College of this city held an emergency meeting the afternoon before yesterday at 3:00 PM, and passed proposals such as organizing a national salvation volunteer army, expanding propaganda, and intensifying anti-Japanese work.

If it becomes absolutely necessary in the future, they can depart for the front lines. Drills are scheduled to begin today at the public sports field. All the students in the school are willing to participate in military training. However, after the health office conducted physical examinations of each student, a small number of students were found to be physically weak and too young, only twelve or thirteen years old, and are temporarily not suitable for joining the Girls' Army. Therefore, out of more than five hundred female students in the school, more than four hundred students are participating fully, while the rest were eliminated by the health office. However, they still wish to participate in military training.</p>

<p>Chinese teams include Donghua, Zhenru, Yehua</p>
<p>丨Group B: Sixteen Teams丨</p>
<p>Chinese teams include Yuehan, Hujiang</p>
<p>丨Group C (Love Group): Eleven Teams丨</p>

<p>Permission Granted for Three Groups to Begin Competing for the Championship on October 10th; Teams Not Allowed to Reschedule, Otherwise Forfeit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football League Executive Committee held a meeting the other day and accepted the applications of Chinese and Western teams to participate. After careful consideration, it approved a total of forty-eight teams in Groups A, B, and C. There are three Chinese teams in Group A, two in Group B, six in Group C (Love Group), and three in Group C (Leather Group), totaling approximately fourteen teams. The committee was unable to accommodate everyone due to the lack of fields. Therefore, the teams that were not selected may request to join other Group B cup competitions. It is better to have fewer teams with quality than to have many teams that are mixed in ability. An important resolution was that Chinese and Western teams are not allowed to request postponements or changes to the order of matches, regardless of whether the reason is due to national, religious, professional, or other incidents. All teams must abide by the order. If this occurs, it will be considered a forfeit, and the opposing team will be awarded points. If a team violates this more than once, it will be severely punished by the league. The league strongly advocates that if Chinese and Western teams cannot comply with this rule, they should give up participating in various competitions before the games begin. Friendly matches will be arranged for the upcoming Saturday and Sunday (October 3rd and 4th). The official period for competing for the championship will begin on October 10th. The list of teams is as follows:</p>
<p>Group A: Ten Teams</p>
<p>Donghua, Zhenru, Yehua, British Navy, Portugal, Western Police, Napashandeng, Shigaote, Shanghai Team, Lakes.</p>
<p>Group B: Sixteen Teams</p>
<p>Yuehan, Hujiang, Aili, British Navy, Yiling, Western Police, Napashandeng, Shigaote, Shanghai Team, Lakes, St. Francis, Shaker, R.A.M.C., R.A.S.C., Jewish, French Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Group C (Love Group): Eleven Teams</p>
<p>Aurora, Jiaotong, Portugal, Italian Navy, Lingnan, Pagoda Red Hat, Hygiene, St. Francis, Youyou, Hualing.</p>
<h3>Group C (Leather Group): Eleven Teams</h3>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Heartbreaking Words</h3>
<p>— Dujuan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, isn't today the Mid-Autumn Festival, as it's called in the old customs? "The moon is especially bright at Mid-Autumn." How beautiful and fulfilling. However, I hope that tonight's moon will no longer be round and no longer be bright, for fear that it will shine on our fertile Northeast, where the solemn and splendid flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun has gone, replaced by flags of the Rising Sun, stained with blood. Where have the hundreds of thousands of soldiers of the great Republic of China, wielding their weapons to defend the nation, gone? Replaced by hordes of ogre-like dwarf soldiers. Alas, I cannot bear to look back on the moonlit homeland. Moon, oh moon, do not be round tonight, do not be bright.</p>
<p>Not Removing the Weeds, Jifu Talks</p>
<h3>Where Did General Fu Go?</h3>
<p>On November 28th, 1927, I gave a speech to all comrades about Fu Zuoyi, the garrison commander of Zhuozhou. Today, in my diary, I find the following record:</p>
<p>"Fu Zuoyi is defending Zhuozhou with several thousand men, and for more than forty days, tens of thousands of Feng army soldiers have not been able to shake him. He disregards the rates of the revolutionary soldiers, and is a model for the people of the country. He has a teacher named Yu Guohan, who is now working in the Feng army and wrote to persuade him to surrender. He replied, 'I don't remember that there was a lesson on surrender in the teacher's lectures.' I hope all comrades will remember this saying: ... We must have the art of living and the art of dying. The defense of Zhuozhou has reached the realm of art. I sincerely hope that reinforcements will arrive to relieve the siege and save this good general for the Republic of China, so that he can settle accounts with the imperialists on the world battlefield. Fu's army deserves our song of non-surrender! Let us all stand up and sing this song, paying tribute in our hearts to the warriors of Zhuozhou:</p>
<p>'Soldiers save the country and do not want their lives.</p>
<p>Do not want their lives, do not want their lives,</p>
<p>There are only beheaded generals,</p>
<p>There are no surrendered generals.</p>
<p>Soldiers save the country and do not want their lives.</p>
<p>Do not want their lives, do not want their lives,</p>
<p>There are only beheaded soldiers,</p>
<p>There are no surrendered soldiers.'"</p>
<p>If every defending general in the three northeastern provinces was Fu Zuoyi, then the three northeastern provinces would not be lost. If every defending general in the Republic of China was Fu Zuoyi, then the Republic of China would not be lost. Where is the Fu Zuoyi of the three northeastern provinces? Where is the Fu Zuoyi of the Republic of China?</p>
<h3>For Example</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>For example, I died yesterday. Now I am a ghost. Although the soul has knowledge, the actions are not free. Seeing the family cry, persuading them all without reason. Originally, the form and qi were separated. I only have something to say, how can it enter their ears? It only hurts my heart, what benefit is there to them? It is better not to ask, it is better not to open the mouth. Open the door of my east pavilion, sit on my old chair. Turn over the books of my old friends, stacked high. Farther back is three months ago, closer is ten days. It's like a person from another world, coming to read the Twenty-Five Histories. I can only pick it up at will, and then nod my head to open it. What I suffer is that people do not know, and I have not asked the ghost recorder. Exhaust my limited spirit, bend my nameless finger. Extinguish the wild goose foot lamp, write out the fly-head characters. Calling the boy, he refuses. Who will pay for the postage? Even if I send it to you, it is just a piece of paper. Ghost words cannot be seen, thinking about it is also meaningless. Therefore, I think about the affairs of the world, no matter how big or small. Each to the point of no way, only can listen to it. I am old and sick now, my strength has declined. I am busy for people, who will replace me? I do not seek fame, I do not covet wealth. Why bother to be a horse or cow? Why be driven? Ask relatives and friends far away, ask wife and children nearby. All say you are foolish, who forces you to do this? Therefore, I get a solution, for example, I died yesterday.</p>
<h3>Remembering Li Er, Who Vigorously Thwarted the Japanese</h3>
<p>— Yin Shouman</p>
<p>During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, there was a rascal named Li Er in Jinsha Township, Nantong. He was brave and fierce from a young age. When he was over ten years old, he once stole five dou of rice, carried it and walked swiftly for dozens of miles, and those who pursued him could not catch up. When he grew up, he could face and repel charging cattle. People were all amazed by his divine strength. Li also relied on his bravery, being stubborn, arrogant, and looking down on the world. One day, he accidentally fought with a neighbor because of a trivial matter. The neighbor was injured and died. The neighbor filed a complaint with the authorities, and the arrest was urgent. Li then fled to Shanghai and joined gangs. He did everything from robbery and murder to extortion. The gang members saw his ferocity and made him their leader. At that time, it was right after the Russo-Japanese War. The Japanese expatriates in Shanghai, with the lewd power of their victory, became even more arrogant. The number of Chinese people who were humiliated by them happened almost daily. The official government was dull and dared not protest. Li was very angry when he saw this situation and repeatedly thought of ways to punish them. One day, he passed by Wusong Road and saw four or five Japanese people surrounding a young Chinese woman, laughing and teasing her at will. The woman was in a desperate situation, bowing her head and wanting to cry. Li was furious, strode forward, and swept his arm. Two people were already lying more than a zhang away. The others knew they were no match and shouted for help. Dozens of Japanese people came upon hearing the sound. Li fought alone, without the slightest fear. Before long, the Japanese people all retreated with injuries. Li then calmly walked away slowly. No Japanese dared to chase him. Afterwards, the Japanese negotiated with our country's government, and our side repeatedly apologized, and then the matter was settled. But the Japanese never ceased to resent Li. Not long after, Li was finally ambushed in a remote alley in the British Concession, and was fatally wounded and died. Alas, according to Li's life, he did many evils, and his death is not worth regretting. However, his righteous and courageous act of vigorously thwarting the Japanese should not be forgotten. Therefore, I have written this record for him.</p>
<h3>Remembering an Interesting Story About Mooncakes</h3>
<p>— Xiaochang</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Qi family sent a box of mooncakes. After I ate them, I suddenly remembered an interesting story about mooncakes. Now I will record it below.</p>
<p>In Pingyao, Hang County, more than twenty years ago, there was a large southern goods store that also sold pastries. The shop assistants were very arrogant, so they often had arguments with customers. One day, a villager named Jia, who lived about five li away from Pingyao, took forty copper coins to the store to buy white sugar. Among these forty copper coins, one was a shashell. The shop assistant asked Jia to exchange it, but Jia did not have any small change, so he pleaded with the shop assistant to help him. The shop assistant insisted on not allowing it. Jia then angrily took out a silver dollar and told the shop assistant to give him change. The shop assistant gave him the change. Jia held a grudge in his heart and wanted to retaliate. At this time, it was the end of the seventh lunar month, when mooncakes were being put on the market. One day, Jia said to people in the teahouse, "The day before yesterday, when I was about to go to bed, I ate a mooncake produced by a certain store (referring to the store that exchanged the shashell). In the middle of the night, I suddenly had a stomachache, which gradually became more and more severe, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. It continued until dawn before it slowly got better. I think it was always because I ate this mooncake. But I often eat mooncakes, and I have never had any problems. Why did this mooncake cause abdominal pain and diarrhea? So I was very suspicious and came out to investigate the reason. Well, today I was actually able to find out the reason. It turns out that a small cat drowned in the lard jar used to make mooncakes in that store. Moreover, the cat had been dead for many days. Because this jar of lard was prepared, it had not been used yet. A few days ago, when they were about to use it, they opened the jar and found out that a cat had died there. And the cat had decomposed beyond recognition. The pastry chef was afraid that the manager would find out and scold him. So he quietly fished out the dead cat. The lard in the jar was still used to make mooncakes. The mooncake I ate was made with lard that had a dead cat in it. I was very apprehensive after learning about this. Originally, if we smelled the breath of a dead cat, we would get leprosy. What's more, we ate things stained with the blood and flesh of a dead cat. So if I only have abdominal pain and diarrhea like the night before, and then don't have any other problems, that is a great blessing in misfortune." After Jia finished speaking, the listeners were all shocked. So one person told ten people, and ten people told a hundred people. In a few days, people far and near knew about it. Needless to say, people who knew about this all agreed not to go to that store to buy mooncakes. But the store was completely confused. In the previous few days, business had declined, and they thought it was an accident. From a week before the Mid-Autumn Festival, they still rushed to make mooncakes day and night as in previous years, in order to prepare for a large number of sales during the festival. Who knew that by the time of the festival, the sales of mooncakes were only one-tenth or one-twelfth of the previous year. As a result, after the festival, there were many mooncakes in the cabinets. Both the economy and reputation were lost. The store manager was extremely frustrated and investigated in many ways. Only then did he find out that half a month ago, the shop assistant had asked Jia to exchange a shashell. Jia retaliated</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Soviet Russian Society (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yunfei</p>
<p>The author of this article, Vincent Vocovich, has lived in Soviet Russia for many years and served in the political world. He has many insights into all the various aspects of Soviet Russian society, which are beyond the reach of others. Therefore, this article is likely to be welcomed by those in the country who are paying attention to Soviet Russia. Translator's note: No matter who pretends to be familiar with the living conditions in Soviet Russia, he will always feel the lack of residential housing. Due to the rapid progress of industry and the entry of new social philosophies, the family life in Russia has undergone great changes. But this change has not given me progress in the living conditions of the people.</p>
<p>In the past, a family lived in one house, but now it has become a bedroom for several families. Each house has a modernized kitchen and a common bathroom. This kitchen is also public. Every family cooks with new-style oil stoves. The bathroom is often inverted and unclean. Therefore, the people living in this house often do not bathe for several months. They will never think of using this public bathroom. During the extremely long winter, the windows in this overcrowded house are always tightly closed. The air in the room is naturally very stuffy. In addition, the people living in this house do not trust each other. Therefore, all the food is hidden in this bedroom, which also serves as a dining room and living room. Therefore, this Europeanized Soviet Russian family is filled with the smell of food, the smoke of oil stoves, the crying of children, rags, and broken utensils.</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian communist government created a "Family Executive Council" dedicated to helping the Russian people manage their families. There are also other various associations for the purpose of guiding the Russian people in education and hygiene. Almost every association is led by members of the Communist Party. Meetings are held once a month. At the meeting, there are speeches on physiology and hygiene. A very small number of residents are happy to join this kind of gathering and listen to that kind of stagnant and boring educational speech. Even if coercive measures are used to force residents to attend the meeting, the result is still ineffective. Therefore, in their annual work reports, these few associations always have a sentence filled with disappointment: "No one pays attention to educational work. What to do?"</p>
<p>Social changes have given Soviet Russian women a new legal and moral responsibility. Now every woman should share the responsibility of supporting the family with men. It is considered the price they pay for getting freedom and equality. Russian factories, mines, markets, and offices are filled with women. Approximately four percent of the industries established by the government are women.</p>
<p>If a female worker in a factory gets married, she must carefully nurture her young children in the morning. When she is working in the factory, she will put the young children in the nursery. After a day's work, she will bring the children home and quietly feed them food. If a woman cannot endure this hard work and gets sick, then she can receive free diagnosis and treatment at a public hospital. Every woman must work, otherwise she will starve to death. Because Russian men are addicted to alcohol and do not care about their families. In addition, since 1917, most men have unfortunately become ill and died of old age because they could not withstand the stimulation.</p>
<p>After every girl in the family becomes an adult, she must go out to work. Because the money earned by the father can no longer supply them. Crowds of women without families, women abandoned by their husbands, orphans, and daughters of workers, all gather at the factory gate looking for work. A corner of the kitchen or bedroom is the resting place for these poor women after a day's work. Early marriage is the only way to solve their difficult situation.</p>
<p>Because of this, I fabricated the above facts and promoted them widely. The ancients said, "Many mouths can melt gold." Jin believed the above after reading it.</p>

<h3>A Husband's Wife (24)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>It is common for foreign couples to both have jobs and share the financial burden of the household. Moreover, the couples are exceptionally loving. It is not known why, but Chinese people cannot do this. When a wife has a job, it often leads to the gradual cooling of affection and alienation between the couple. In fact, a small portion of Chinese married women work outside the home because of difficult financial circumstances, but a large portion do so because the relationship with their husband is not very good. Mrs. Li's employment as a clerk at the China Products Company is an example of this. She was very competent in her job and sat at a desk opposite Mr. Chen. When she encountered a difficult matter, Mr. Chen would guide her or even do it for her. They went to the office together in the morning and returned home together in the evening. Everyone thought they were a very loving couple. However, Mrs. Li and Mr. Li grew colder towards each other day by day. They would often go two or three days without speaking, like strangers.</p>
<p>Two months later, Mrs. Chen suddenly changed her attitude. She stayed indoors all day, managed the household affairs in an orderly manner, and was very concerned about Mr. Chen's affairs, talking and laughing, truly a good wife. Mr. Chen was very pleased. He thought his wife had settled down and would no longer cause trouble as she had before. He felt very fortunate that he had restrained himself and had not had a physical relationship with Mrs. Li, otherwise how could he face his wife, how could he properly manage two absolutely conflicting anomalies; now he found much comfort in his family, and towards Mrs. Li, he could only gradually stop the giving and receiving of affections, only with a sense of apology for the unfortunate fate of Mrs. Li. Mrs. Chen had repeatedly refused Mr. Li's appointments and even spoke to him very little. Mr. Chen suspected that she had broken up with Mr. Li for some reason, which led to this result. He felt that he should properly comfort her, so that he would not miss the opportunity, which could make her realize that the foundation of love and understanding only existed in a real marriage which was very secure and valuable. From this point on, he would prevent her from changing her mind again and from being seduced by any man; at the same time, he might be able to move Mr. Li and Mrs. Li to reconcile and return to their original harmony.</p>
<p>Many friends already knew about their situation. At first, they only ridiculed them as "easily swapping wives;" now, however, some people were cursing Mr. Chen as having ulterior motives, because Mrs. Li was still working as a clerk at the China Products Company, and she and Mr. Chen still went to and from work together every day. The general public did not know that Mr. Chen was restraining himself, no longer loving Mrs. Li, and making every effort to reduce opportunities to talk to her. Because they lived in the same house, worked at the same location, and went to and from work together, which was not an easily concocted matter, and could not be designated a crime, the general public did not understand them.</p>

<h3>Great Fluctuations in Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Resulted in Little Net Change. Yesterday, the 25th, the wild and turbulent gold market was still difficult to suppress. Changes happened in an instant. Fluctuations of more than ten taels were common. Both the bulls and bears were at a loss. People's hearts were hesitant and uneasy, and trading was chaotic. The difference between the highest and lowest prices of the day totaled more than thirty taels, but in the end, it evened out, falling by only one tael. The silver market's decline was not considered significant. This was all because the exchange rate between the British and American currencies was tight, but the British gold was particularly strong, resulting in a lower opening. Later, it retreated to within 680 taels. Then, because of the different internal and external markets for bills of exchange, American and Japanese currencies rebounded, and because large investors were competing to buy, the market rose sharply, exceeding the 700 tael mark. Unexpectedly, the Guangdong merchants dumped long positions, causing the market to turn weak again, falling by more than twenty taels. The future market will see even greater ups and downs. This is because of rumors, and the market is panicking. Initially, it rose from within 90 taels to over 700 taels. Later, the international situation was chaotic, even with the Indian exchange suspending trading, and the atmosphere deteriorated, causing a sharp drop of more than ten taels. Moreover, because the banks are closed today (Saturday), the gold market is also closed. In addition, there is no market tomorrow (Sunday), and general retail longs are eager to close out, so in the end only eighty-five or six taels were counted.</p>
<p>Rapid Rise and Fall in the Morning. The market opened in the morning for November delivery, immediately falling eight taels to 682 taels. Large silver and silver prices both fell three-eighths, and private telegrams fell three-quarters. However, the exchange rate reported small, so it went down again, next to 80 taels. Then, due to more buying, it immediately rose ten taels to 90 taels. Unexpectedly, Yongfeng, Tianxing, Yongyuancheng, Yongyuan, etc., sold out one after another, plunging twelve or thirteen taels to 77 taels. Especially since British gold was quite loose, initially settling at 16.5, then actually at 17. Also, Japanese gold could be purchased with only one tael and five qian and four fen. Then, Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, and Laijin, along with HSBC, absorbed 16.875 for January delivery, so it became 85 taels. When British gold opened at 82 taels, the listing was 25 taels higher, but the US dollar was reduced by 1.75 yuan. Japanese gold rose by as much as 2 qian 2 fen 2.5, so the gold price immediately went up. In addition, Yuanmao, Yongqian, Changxiang, Dachen, Shunli, Tongtaichang, etc., all came in, and Mitsui absorbed 1 tael 5 qian 8 fen for October delivery from Dalian, and HSBC absorbed 163125 British gold, the market situation became even sharper, soaring more than 20 taels, reaching 710 taels at 10:20. Then, because Hengxing, Shengda, Yifeng, Yongchunyuan, Yongda, Dalian Gang, and hedging houses had an excited selling mood, it turned weak, falling wildly more than ten taels, but with occasional fluctuations of several taels, until 11:30 only 92 taels were counted. In a moment, it raised seven taels, to 99 and a half taels. Then, the short side slightly covered, but unexpectedly, the Indian exchange rate reported large, one rupee, and suddenly retreated to 84 taels. The noon closing was 87.5 taels, and it was again made to about 90 taels. The market situation was floating and uncertain, with no grasp at all. The opening price was changed to 843 taels, calculated to be 160 taels to 130 taels, 160 taels at noon.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market is Even More Chaotic. The afternoon market opened at 87 taels, then 86 taels, but there were many sellers. Later, Tongtaichang, Yuanmao, Yong et al. bought in, adding eight or nine taels, for 96 taels. Suddenly, Hengxing and Qianxiang sold, falling ten taels, at 2:20 for 86 taels. British gold was also hard, Mitsui released 1675, Sumitomo released 8125. Then, Zhengjin absorbed one tael and five qian five fen and two and a half from Dalian, and sold to HSBC's forward order 16875. The market buyers were still strong. Bingxing, Shunli, articles, and general retail shorts all came in, rising fifteen or sixteen taels, reaching 702 taels at 2:50. Later, Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanmao, Yong, etc., all unloaded, again presenting a depressed trend. Only from 3:00 to 3:30 were there five or six taels of twists and turns. Then, it was heard that the Indian exchange was difficult to auction, so there was no report. People's hearts were even more fearful. After 4:00, the final was 84 taels, when Tianfeng and Yong bought in, pulling up more than seven taels, to 91 and a half taels. However, Hengxing sold endlessly, and the market closed at 4:30 at 89 taels, and then again at 85 or 6 taels, only falling one tael compared to the day before yesterday (according to the list). According to the maximum price of 710 taels and the minimum price of 677 taels in one day, there were 33 taels of twists and turns.</p>
<p>150 Taels in Spreads Made. Articles opened at 85 taels, closed at 90 taels at noon, and closed at 89 taels in the afternoon. The opening price was estimated to be 150 taels or so. Dengzhen's water supplement was 88 taels in the morning, and 89 taels in the afternoon. Dengzhang was not counted. There were no transactions for spot red strips.</p>
<p>Guangdong Gang Sold Longs Heavily. Table transactions statistics showed that Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanmao Yong, Tianxiang, Qian Changxiang, Tongtaichang, and Shunli all came in. Wanxing, Cuichangyong, Yuanxingyong, Daxingyong, Yifengyong, Hengxing, Shengda, Chengfengyong, and Futaiheng all came out. Yuantai, Tiankang, Taifengcheng, and Yuankangxiang had quite a lot of inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Shunli, Tongtaichang, and Bingxing all came in. Hengxing, Wanxing, Yuanmao Yong, Zhifengyong, Qian Changxiang, Yifengyong, and Dachen all came out. Bills of exchange hedging all came out. Taking forward orders, the Guangdong Gang heavily sold more than 7,000 long orders. The Dalian Gang had a total inflow of 3,000 and an outflow of 2,000.</p>

<h3>Abnormal Exchange Rate Disorder</h3>
<p>Listed British Loose... American and Japanese Currencies Strangely Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday, both the British and American silver markets shrank, but the exchange rate between Britain and the United States went downstream again. Therefore, the Shanghai market bills of exchange went in the opposite direction, the British loose, and the American and Japanese currencies were tight. This kind of situation is really rare. The HSBC listing calculated that British gold was released by one notch, (two five), the American dollar was reduced by 1.75 yuan, Japanese gold rose sharply by 2 qian 2 fen and 2.5, French exchange shrank by 44 yuan, German exchange shrank by 9 yuan, He Yang went down by three yuan, and Po Yang went down by two taels. Hong Kong did not move. Indian exchange currently hangs at ninety-nine and a half rupees, and the internal market is also an abnormal trend. However, the market situation is abnormally chaotic, because the exchange rate is squeezed small. It was weak in the morning, then it stabilized, and it loosened again at noon. It was flat in the afternoon. The result compared to the day before yesterday was that British gold grew by eight seven five, the US dollar shrank by half a yuan, and Japanese gold rose by three points, while the gold market was extremely chaotic, and finally slightly inferior. Chinese commercial gold companies such as Chengfengyong, etc., which had previously thrown out British gold, are now replenishing, estimated at about 200,000 pounds. The hedging is much further away than before, estimated at more than 70 taels, with considerable profits. There was no market report for the Indian exchange yesterday afternoon, because the market was extremely weak and it was not easy to trade, so British gold may be difficult to shrink back. US dollars were slightly sold off, and the Dalian gang continued to sell more than one million yuan of Japanese gold. As for the exchange rate between the Japanese and US dollars, Zhengjin bought in at 490625 for December delivery before noon.</p>

If the declining trend had not been reversed the day before yesterday, the future would have been unimaginable. Fortunately, the dangerous period has passed, the proposal for the Central Bank to pledge funds has been determined, and our country has also achieved considerable results in diplomacy. It is no longer as dangerous and terrible as before. People's hearts in the market have settled down greatly, and prices have risen one after another.

<h3>The Cotton Yarn Market Is Soaring</h3>

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose at noon, and the situation was extremely tense. The factory spot goods of various factories have been collected by all gangs, the root is extremely short, and some factories have already sold out the goods after February. The anti-Japanese atmosphere is very strong, so the market is soaring and there are few sellers, so there is still an upward trend in the future.</p>

<h3>New Cotton Market Released Like Bees</h3>
<p>The cotton market has turned weak and the decline is extremely severe. US cotton is not vibrating, the silver price is growing longer, and the selling price of Indian cotton is extremely cheap. Shenxin Factory has purchased 10,000 pieces, Agura 28 taels and 5 qian, and Blocko 32 taels. The market is therefore weak, and new sellers have flocked to it. There is also the saying that Japanese factories have suspended work. If it is realized, the need for raw materials will naturally decrease. The world economic situation is chaotic, and the cotton market is even more difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Han Standard Tragically Drops by More Than Half a Taels. The Han Standard opened in the early market, with US cotton trending down, and each month fell by 2 or 3 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that a large number of Indian cotton had been opened, and each month fell by 2 or 3 cents again. 48,000 dan were traded in the early market. It was found that Meiji sold 5,000 dan, Dachang 3,100 dan, Xincheng 3,300 dan, and Gongtai 2,200 dan (Tianjiang bought 4,000 dan, Gengfeng 3,400 dan, Ruida 6,200 dan, and Changfeng 3,800 dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>November 3305 65 228,900 February 3300 55 194,200</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Transactions Are Very Smooth. The spot cotton market is weak and has not improved. The selling price of Indian cotton is extremely cheap, and various factories have placed huge orders. No native cotton has been seen to be shipped, and transactions are unheard of.</p>
<p>Candy Hsu 29.00 Shenxin Factory entered 4,000 pieces of spot goods, which were loaded and sent to the factory</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in Foreign Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>English Cotton Initially Firm, Then Weak: Yesterday, American cotton initially firmed due to foreign merchants buying, but later weakened due to selling in the South and a sluggish Wall Street. Futures fell 18 to 21 points per pound, spot fell 20 points per pound. English cotton futures rose 55 to 65 points, spot rose 54 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose 75 points. Indian cotton prices were mixed due to fluctuations in the British and American exchange rates but closed firm. Bengal rose 0.5 rupee, Oomra rose 4 rupees, and Broach rose 4.75 rupees. (Original telegram from the 24th)</p>

<p>Grains: Old White Pointed Rice Drops 40 Cents</p>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, various gangs had slightly more supply. In the morning, there was drizzling rain. Retail sales in towns and villages were scattered, so the market atmosphere was slack. However, sales were not very loose. The thick japonica rice market remained stable. Not much thin indica rice arrived, and sales were sluggish. It seemed that because of the continuous arrival of new goods, the market price weakened again. Although there was little old white pointed rice, buyers were all trying to bargain, and prices fell by as much as 40 to 50 cents. Sticky rice was scarce and still strong.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, it rained continuously, and the amount of goods arriving from the interior was limited, so the trend was declining. Changshu and Xixi North japonica rice prices were increased and then lowered. New japonica rice also had good demand because the amount of incoming goods decreased, and prices were firm. New Wuxi rice samples were seen. Two loads arrived yesterday, totaling 150 to 160 piculs. The rice quality was quite good, and the asking price was 16 yuan. New empty white pointed rice arrived one after another, but sales were not active, and the market was soft. Because there was only a small amount of Pointed White rice in the alleys, it picked up slightly. Sales of foreign rice were weak, and futures softened slightly. The market trend followed the rise in gold prices and was still firm. Tomorrow is the abolished autumn festival, and the north and south markets will uniformly stop measuring grain, ending the accounting period. There will be no market report.</p>
<h3>Large Volume of New Transactions in Futures</h3>
<p>7,500 Tons... Market Immediately Shows Wild Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw a large number of sales by foreign firms in the futures market, and the market changed drastically. However, the spot market was not affected by the morning transactions, but there were not many transactions. Only 500 bags of Xiao Jiao were opened, priced at 12.20 yuan, and handled by this street. In the futures market, Tianxiang Foreign Firm was selling off aggressively, and other foreign firms also followed suit. Near-term and recalled goods immediately dropped about 20 cents. Tianxiang sold 4,000 tons of Xiao Jiao for February-March delivery at 5.70 taels and another 2,000 tons for November delivery at 5.55 taels. Baolong sold 700 tons for October delivery at 5.5 taels. Bingchang sold 700 tons for October delivery at 5.55 taels, all traded with the English-Chinese firm. Recalled goods included 500 tons for October delivery at prices ranging from 5.5 taels to 5.55 taels. After this large volume of transactions, market sentiment was very weak, and the spot market and recalled futures showed signs of weakening.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Bean Noodle Bulls Voluntarily Exit</h3>
<p>Bean Noodle Falls Over 1 Cent</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the bean noodle market, the prices for various months mostly showed a pattern of near-term declines and long-term stability. Because this month is close to delivery and there will be a two-day market closure, major manufacturers have been selling very little, and due to the widespread violence by the Japanese in the North, shipments have been stopped, so they have given up on maintaining prices and allowed them to rise and fall freely. Therefore, the position of the bulls has become weaker and weaker, and they have to voluntarily exit step by step as delivery approaches, so the lowest price in the afternoon was 2.03 taels, a record unseen in several months. For longer-term months, because outside investors are still not giving up, they continue to buy, and the market atmosphere has improved slightly. As a result, this month's price fell 1.25 cents compared to the previous day, October fell 0.75 cents, November-December rose 0.25 cents, and January-February rose 0.5 cents.</p>
<h3>This Month's Wheat Plummets 18 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw a rare plummet this month because it was the last day and delivery was imminent, resulting in a large gap between supply and demand. The opening price in the morning was still 6.67 cents, and the closing price was not much different. However, in the afternoon, because there were still few buyers and the manufacturers had a very large inventory, they were unwilling to inquire, so the bulls were in a hurry and sold off, causing prices to fall continuously. The morning low plummeted to 3.51 taels, a huge difference of 1.9 cents from the previous day. This kind of record is not only unprecedented but also unexpected for those who are long. For longer-term months, because outside investors are still unwilling to give up, they are still holding on, so this month's price fell 1.8 cents compared to the previous day, October fell 0.2 cents, November-December remained unchanged, January rose 0.2 cents, and February rose 0.1 cents.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Cost of New Xinghua Dried Longan Reaches 100 Taels</p>
<p>This year, Xinghua dried longan had a bumper harvest, and the market price was high, unprecedented in recent years. It is said that the first batch of new goods has been shipped from the local area and will arrive approximately today or tomorrow. According to industry insiders, the cost of top-quality, genuine second-grade goods has reached over 100 taels per dan, which is almost half the market price of previous years, which is truly rare.</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<h3>English Steel Plate Stirs After Extreme Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's metal transactions were extremely chaotic. The business on the northern route, such as the three northeastern provinces, was largely at a standstill. The Tianjin gang showed lively activity yesterday, so they were very enthusiastic about buying English steel plates, so they bought as many as 700 to 800 dan. Therefore, the sluggish market had a hint of stirring after extreme quiet yesterday. Prices were estimated at 2.5 cents for 8.25 taels, 5 cents for 6.5 taels, 7.5 cents for 6.25 taels, and 1 cent for 5.75 taels. Business in Hankou still showed no improvement yesterday, because the local area still felt uneasy after the flood receded. The Fujian gang had no commissions to handle after the departure of the Wanxiang Wheel. The inland gangs lacked the appetite for purchases because the festival had passed. The market in this street also felt deserted yesterday. As for other metal categories, except for 48-gauge American white iron, which rose 25 cents and sold for 18.75 taels, there were no other major changes.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: The Foreign Firm Silk Market Remains Lifeless</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market remained lifeless. Japanese silk was competing for sales at low prices in overseas markets, and European and American silk factories had sluggish silk sales, and the exchange rate was still changing drastically, so there was no demand for raw silk. Silk telegrams were not transferred, and the market atmosphere was bleak. Yesterday, Zuxin Shichang imported ten packages of white dried silk, and Xinfu imported five packages of Sichuan yellow rough silk, all at flat prices.</p>
<h3>Source of Lu Silk Waste is Blocked</h3>
<p>Yellow and White Silk Waste Produced in Yushan Province, such as Wanshou Changtu Suozi, etc., Sells Well to European and American Firms. Now, because of the violent Japanese attack on Eastern Province, Yantai and Andong production areas have been devastated, silk factories have successively stopped work, transportation is difficult, and the market has invisibly come to a standstill. The source of Lu silk waste has been completely blocked.</p>
<h3>Lu Zhuang Gongxi Russian Sales Continue to Be Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, Russian Aid Association continued to spare no effort in searching for and buying Lu Zhuang Gongxi green tea. However, the board was more demanding than before, and Chinese merchants were unwilling to sell cheaply. English sales of Zhenmei pearl tea and other items were still sluggish. American sales of Lu Zhuang Pingshui large batches were also quite stagnant, but Chinese merchants were unanimously firm because the source was cut off and inventories were depleted.</p>

<p>Press Conference</p>
<h3>Hosting Western Newspaper Reporters Today</h3>
<p>Reporting the Truth About Japan's Rampant Actions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association believes that Japan is acting rampantly, and the Japanese are using their usual news policy tricks to reverse black and white and carry out major propaganda to confuse the vision of various countries in the world. If this is not strictly corrected, it will be difficult to obtain sympathetic assistance in future negotiations. The association will host reporters from various European and American countries stationed in Shanghai today (the 26th) at the Huamao Hotel in the Sassoon Building to report the truth about the Japanese military's forced occupation of the Eastern Provinces and seek future communication on propaganda so that the eyes of all countries in the world will not be blinded by the Japanese alone. Invitations were sent out yesterday.</p>
<h3>International Chamber of Commerce Willing to Do its Utmost for Peace</h3>

The International Chamber of Commerce is closely related to the world economy and will naturally do its utmost to promote a just and peaceful solution. Please release your worries. Montesson."</p>
<p>City Executive Committee</p>
<h3>Reply to Letter from Indian League</h3>
<p>People of All Countries Sympathize with Our Country Regarding Japan's Dispatch of Troops to the Three Eastern Provinces. The China-India League sent a letter to the Municipal Executive Committee, Expressing Readiness to Sacrifice and Willingness to Serve as the Vanguard. The Municipal Department Replied with Thanks. Here are excerpts from the two letters: (Letter) "Dear Sirs, We, the members of the Indian League, have made the following decisions regarding the brutal actions of Japan against peaceful China in Southern Manchuria: (1) Expressing full sympathy for the suffering of your country; (2) Resolutely opposing Japan's barbaric actions; (3) Severely condemning Japan's actions in reviving the war and disrupting the world; (4) Members of the Indian League are ready to sacrifice to overthrow Japan's illegal actions in Southern Manchuria; (5) Members of the Indian League are awaiting your association's orders, ready to help your association defeat imperialism, and hope to receive a reply soon." Indian League, September 23rd. (Reply) "Dear Sirs, We have received your letter stating that you sympathize with our suffering in Southern Manchuria due to Japan's brutality, are willing to sacrifice, and will severely condemn it. Japan's sudden dispatch of troops to our country's Three Eastern Provinces and occupation of key areas such as Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, and Xinmin violates international law and the non-war pact, and is intolerable to justice and humanity. Our people are filled with righteous indignation and are working with the government to deal with the situation. We are deeply grateful for your association's sympathy and assistance. Please take note and strive to fight together.</p>
<h3>Five Measures by the National Federation of Commerce</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce, due to the Japanese army's forceful occupation of the three northeastern provinces and the countless massacres of our compatriots, specifically convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday to discuss measures. The important telegrams issued yesterday, in addition to requesting a cessation of internal conflict to jointly defend against foreign aggression and a letter requesting the National Salvation Association to provide relief to Chinese personnel, requested that the Commercial Corps Regulations continue to be effective. Their unanimous telegram to Japan outlining five measures read as follows: To all chambers of commerce at home and abroad: Recently, our country's governance has been poor, internal conflicts have been frequent, floods have erupted, bandits are everywhere, and foreign troubles are constant. This time, the Japanese violent army invaded the Eastern Provinces, and our country cannot resist foreign aggression with the remaining strength of internal strife, abandoning cities and retreating, adopting a policy of non-resistance. The Japanese's tyrannical actions are indeed an exposure of their long-planned scheme to annex Manchuria and Mongolia, which need not be discussed. However, our country has used the blood and sweat of the people to raise an army of two million, but when the enemy approached, we surrendered without a fight, which is deeply regrettable. As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." Our people do not strive for self-improvement but vainly hope for help from others; we do not exhaust human effort but vainly hope for help from heaven. This is our people's greatest weakness. Therefore, in internal affairs, we leave everything to the government, and besides paying taxes and debts, we do not supervise foreign affairs. In foreign affairs, we tie our own hands and extravagantly expect support from other countries. Such actions are enough to perpetuate endless warfare and derail politics internally, and to invite the contempt of the great powers and frequent insults externally. This Federation believes that the Republic of China is the nation of all our people. The people are the foundation of the nation. Only when the people are strong can the nation be secure. The government is merely a unified representative organ of our people, executing the will of the people. Now, at this critical moment of national survival, all our people should immediately make a painful decision to correct past mistakes, broaden the sense of responsibility of every individual, from individuals to groups to the nation. This Federation specifically convened an emergency meeting of executive and supervisory committee members in Shanghai on September 24 to discuss and decide to send a telegram to the whole country to discuss implementing five measures: (1) Each chamber of commerce should quickly unite all sectors of society to organize anti-Japanese national salvation associations, awaken the people, and fight together. (2) Each chamber of commerce should jointly urge the government to concentrate its strength and announce effective strategies against Japan. (3) Each chamber of commerce should urgently organize commercial corps and implement military training for merchants to jointly face the national crisis. (4) Each chamber of commerce should unite with all sectors of society to sever relations with Japan and not cooperate with them. (5) Each chamber of commerce should encourage all merchants to strive to manufacture and promote domestic goods. These resolutions have been recorded and telegraphed. We hope that you will investigate and implement them accordingly, proceeding in unity. The country will be fortunate. Lin Kanghou, Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangxu, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, and Peng Chuli respectfully submit, Chairmen of the National Federation of Commerce.</p>

<p>The National News Agency reported that Mr. Fang Jisheng, a representative of the Eastern Question Research Association, came to Shanghai from Beijing because of the Japanese army's atrocities in Liaoning and Jilin.

They had been holding meetings for days, and some even cut off their fingers in anguish, vowing never to coexist with Japanese imperialism. The comrades are now planning to expand their organizations and are preparing to establish a Shanghai Special District Eastern Revolutionary Youth Association.

<h3>Various Expressions from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Fourth District Party Headquarters to the Central Government The Fourth District Party Headquarters. After the district's emergency meeting resolved to telegraph the Central Government to quickly promulgate countermeasures against Japan so that the public would know what to follow, the telegram was sent yesterday. The original telegram stated: "To the Central Party Headquarters and all members of the National Government. (Omitted above) At this time when public sentiment is surging and righteous indignation fills the chest, this national tragedy cannot be passed over in silence, nor can it be resolved by the so-called 'calmness' of the Central Government in the past. However, as of today, the incident has been going on for over a week, thousands upon millions of compatriots have been crying out under the hooves of the enemy, and millions of miles of territory have been trampled almost entirely by the Japanese invaders. Yet our government has not yet issued a complete strategy against Japan, which is no laughing matter. Furthermore, recent speeches by important figures at home and abroad have generally appealed to the League of Nations, seeking a just verdict. It must be known that in today's League of Nations, who is not plotting against us? So-called justice is still subordinate to force. Taking a step back, even if the League of Nations can truly help us, it would be like trying to quench a fire with water from afar. If we wait for the League of Nations to provide assistance, then the Rising Sun Flag will be flying over the Stone City. Now, public sentiment is indignant, and all are united against the enemy. If we mobilize our 400 million people to confront those of the three islands, we may even achieve an alliance under the city. 'I will destroy them before I eat breakfast; I hope to achieve that goal.' Do you, gentlemen in power, agree? Therefore, at this critical juncture of life and death, we still hope that you will not lose the opportunity due to calmness. Quickly determine a complete strategy against Japan for the Central Government, announce it to the people, so that public sentiment can be gathered as the center of gravity and the government can rely on it as a backing, so that the beautiful rivers and mountains will not become bloodlands and the revolutionary nation can stand on its own." The Fourth District Party Headquarters of the Shanghai Special Municipality respectfully.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuanruo's Vow to Save the Nation Since Japan suddenly dispatched heavy troops to forcefully occupy the Northeast, the people of the whole country have been indignant. For several days, the national atmosphere has suddenly become tense, with telegrams being sent, meetings being held, and people running around shouting. Residents of the Northeast have been fleeing in droves. Students in Ping City have been crying. (A telegram from Ping City on the 21st stated that Qi Bin, a middle school student in Ping City, bit his finger and wrote in blood, "Down with the military!" The sound of crying shook the city.) Alas, people of the nation, floods are rampant, the Red disaster is raging, and we are struggling to save the dying from the depths of water and fire, yet we are subjected to this major trampling. Government offices have been occupied, officials have been kidnapped, there is arson and destruction along the way, and looting everywhere. Women are being raped, and compatriots are being massacred. We are subjected to violence and unable to resist. What crime has China committed to deserve this? After the people of the nation have suffered this unprecedented humiliation, grief, and heartbreak, what exactly will the entire country use to confront and resist them? In recent days, everywhere there has been impassioned speeches and marches. All of these actions are right and proper (I am also one of the people taking these actions). However, judging from past experience, this will not hurt the violent enemy's slightest bit, nor will it compensate for the sacrifices of our nation. Looking at our people running around and shouting in recent days, even as they move in, Alas, after establishing the nation for thousands of years, with hundreds of millions of residents and raising an army of millions, we are still not enough to resist the invasion of the island nation of Japanese invaders. Those who hold the reins of government, how do you view the far-sighted strategies of your ancestors who established the nation? Those who are citizens, how do you view the spirit of our ancestors who created our culture? How can we face the glorious history of our nation and the brilliant culture of our nation? The Japanese imperialists, with their mainland policy, have been scheming to plot against us for a long time. Since the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese-Russian War and other battles have successively displayed their military strength, invading our barriers and seizing our key positions (see my book, "International Issues and Japanese Development"). This current battle is a necessary step to complete their mainland policy. The destruction of Manchuria and Mongolia has long been rumored and long prepared for. The change of governors in Korea, the replacement of the president of the South Manchurian Railway, the sharp increase in troops stationed in Korea, and the repeated occurrence of incidents involving Koreans are all clear evidence of this. No matter how the Japanese try to conceal it, they cannot cover the eyes and ears of the world. What we should be most vigilant and concerned about is that if the Eastern Provinces are lost, it will be the realization of Japan's mainland policy ambitions and the beginning of the establishment of Japan's mainland empire. Therefore, the loss of the Eastern Provinces is a matter of life and death for the Chinese nation. In the Sino-Japanese War, although our country was defeated, it was still able to fight to the death. On the other hand, today, apart from holding meetings and giving speeches, we do not have the courage and ability to fight them to the death. Predicting the future, if they do not restrain their ambitions and once they seek to take over the Central Plains, I fear that even the freedom to hold meetings and give speeches will no longer exist. Think, think, this is the most worrying and dangerous event for our Chinese nation. However, the dangerous focus is not only on this. As the saying goes, "Adversity can strengthen a nation; a nation without a foreign enemy will perish." The key to a nation's survival and decline lies in the revival of the people's spirit. Those who destroy a nation are never the aggressors using military force. What is dangerous is the degeneration of their own nation. If the people's spirit is vibrant, the people's hearts are united, and the people's will is upward, then their nation will be able to consolidate and develop. Even if there are strong neighbors, they will not be able to shake it. The only fear is that the people's emotions are numb, and even when disaster strikes, they are still indifferent. Then, when violence comes, they can only be slaughtered. Therefore, there is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and no greater danger to a nation than the death of the people's hearts. The Japanese's tyranny is not something to worry about deeply. What is worrying is the death of the people's hearts. The author, observing quietly, deeply feels that the nation's degeneration has reached its extreme, and he is worried and indignant day and night. If this continues, the nation will perish without even waiting for the enemy to reach the city. The common people and officials, living in hardship, are still mired in private interests. The people are poor, and the nation is exhausted. They are still raising troops and causing chaos, fighting over territory and plundering, without any consideration. Even in fundraising for disaster relief, there are people who are conscienceless, using public office for private gain, and satisfying their selfish desires. The moral decay of the people has reached this point, which is deeply regrettable. In recent years, in the areas of big cities where transportation is more convenient, modern men and women do not read books or do things, misunderstand Westernization, are accustomed to licentiousness, do not engage in production, indulge in consumption, and are immersed in the pleasures of men and women, unaware of the worries of the nation. The number of cases involving licentiousness and theft has shocked the cities, and decadent music has spread to the villages. In general, frivolous men and women rush to it and enjoy it as if their lives depended on it, to satisfy the desires of their eyes and ears. All social undertakings, national issues, and even their own duties are all ignored. Alas, the people's will has declined to this point. Is this because people are insulting us, or is it because heaven is destroying China? Recently, after being trampled upon by the violent Japanese, the people of the entire country have been frightened and indignant, and they have already awakened. However, what we earnestly hope from our people across the country is not temporary indignation or temporary impulse, but a permanent determination to strive, struggle, and sacrifice for the nation. If we still maintain a mentality of playing games, and if after the event passes, the voice disappears and the will fades, then we can only prepare for the simultaneous demise of the entire nation. The Central Government announces to the people of our nation: "Saving the nation and resisting foreign aggression is the most difficult and serious task in the world." How could Japan have today and have the ability to trample on our country without long-term and arduous struggles? Anyone who knows a little about Japanese history knows that its initial encounters and its initial position in the international community were similar to ours. However, its national culture had no foundation. At first, it even sought advice from our country. Now, with our long history of culture, vast territory, large population, abundant resources, mild climate, and all the other perfect conditions for building a nation, why have we fallen into decline and been unable to rise up, punish the violent enemy, protect peace, and extend justice? After the people of the nation are filled with grief and indignation, think again and think deeply. China's poverty, China's weakness, and today's disasters and humiliations are all self-inflicted and self-sown by the people of the nation. The people of the nation cannot escape their responsibility and should all deeply blame themselves. Japan's restoration occurred at the same time as ours, and none of its conditions for building a nation were as good as ours. However, everything today, whether spiritual or material, political or economic, military or cultural, we are far behind it. Why is this so? The Japanese work hard, we do not work hard; the Japanese struggle, we do not struggle; the Japanese are hardworking, we are not hardworking; the Japanese are strong, we are not strong; the Japanese build, we do not build; the Japanese are united, we are not united. The nation is the accumulation of people, and people are the vessel of the heart. Therefore, the strength, weakness, rise, and fall of a nation are all connected to the revival of the people's spirit. I deeply hope that the people of the nation, after being devastated, will deeply understand this point, make a permanent determination to struggle, strive to save the nation, and completely eliminate the usual habits of weakness, selfishness, harming the public, laziness, greed, cowardice, timidity, licentiousness, frivolity, indulgence, and ignorance. As long as we can do this, then there will be no unrest or chaos that cannot be quelled, no people who cannot be strengthened, and no humiliation that cannot be avenged. Based on this one thought of national revival and destruction, I, on this day when the entire nation lowers its flag to mourn and the nation is in dire straits, make the following twelve vows to save the nation and urge myself to act. I deeply hope that the people of the nation, in addition to being indignant, will also strive together: 1. Develop national production. 2. Increase work efficiency. 3. Enrich public knowledge. 4. Focus on scientific research. 5. Train organizational abilities. 6. Cultivate national consciousness. 7. Strengthen the people's physique. 8. Intensify military training. 9. Vow not to harm others to benefit oneself. 10. Vow not to fear difficulties and seek comfort. 11. Vow not to be lazy and waste time. 12. Vow not to use Japanese goods.</p>

<p>Boy in Western Suit</p>
<h3>Angered by Japan, Drowns Himself</h3>
<p>A Misanthrope's Last Words</p>
<p>An Unnamed Student</p>
<p>Near Yujidun in western Shanghai yesterday afternoon, a young man in a Western suit was seen walking along the riverbank, looking unhappy, as if suffering from a great sorrow. Curious villagers discussed him in whispers. Suddenly, the young man jumped into the river, causing splashes of water. No one dared to help. At the critical moment, the soldiers of the Su-affiliated anti-smuggling patrol boat stationed there managed to rescue him, saving his life. They took off his wet clothes and found a suicide note in his pants pocket, wrapped in oil paper. It read: "To all compatriots across the country: Our country has been known for its strength and prosperity for thousands of years, with abundant resources and the earliest civilization. In the last hundred years, we have lost rights and territory countless times. Finally, with the founding of the Republic of China, we were pleased to see the return of our rivers and mountains and the restoration of the glory of our ancestors. How could we know that national affairs would deteriorate daily, with internal conflicts becoming even more intense, leading to the removal of our barriers and the increasing urgency of foreign insults? The Japanese invaders seized the opportunity to send troops to the Northeast, massacre our compatriots, and occupy our borders. If the people of the nation do not rise up and strive for strength, the country will be doomed. A misanthrope's last words." The special agent of the patrol boat, seeing the suicide note, knew that he had committed suicide out of concern for the country. When asked for his name, he refused to reveal it, only saying that he had graduated from the Mainland University. The agent immediately comforted him and transferred him to his superiors for proper care.</p>

<h3>Relief Goods Returned by Original Ship</h3>
<p>Sending Relief Goods and Occupying Territory on the Same Day</p>
<p>Preferring Thirst to Drinking Stolen Water Expresses National Resolve</p>
<p>When Wuhan was hit by floods, Japan also pretended to send a condolence ship for the flood victims, the Tenran Maru, to Shanghai. The ship contained a total of 2,500 tons of rice, flour, cloth, medicine, etc. Since arriving in Shanghai on the 18th, it had been docked at Yangshupu. The leader of the condolence delegation was Mr. Fukao, the president of Nisshin Kisen Kaisha. When he arrived in Shanghai, he visited Song Ziwen and planned to immediately go to Hankou to distribute relief. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army invaded our Eastern Provinces on the same day. The flood victims in Wuhan refused the Japanese relief goods. The Tenran Maru remained berthed in Shanghai and could not go to Hankou. The Japanese representative, Fukao, still wanted to negotiate with our country to accept the relief goods and repeatedly visited Finance Minister Song, but was not received. On this day, the Japanese also felt that it was uninteresting. Yesterday, it had already been decided that the Tenran Maru, which was berthed in Shanghai, would load the original 2,500 tons of relief goods today and return to Moji, Japan, where it would dock in Hamajima, unload the goods, and return the ship to the Japanese Post Office.</p>

In addition to notifying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I hope to receive your instructions upon receipt of this telegram." Xu Shiying of the Relief Committee respectfully submits.</p>
<h3>Liyang County Levies Rice Donations for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Petition for Cancellation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, due to the Liyang County government's forced levy of rice donations for disaster relief, submitted a petition yesterday to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The petition stated that Liyang's forced rice donations for disaster relief are worse than local customs duties (Lika), hindering the people's food supply. They earnestly requested the matter be forwarded to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for strict orders to cease and thoroughly investigate the matter. According to a telegram from the Wuxi Rice Boat Industry Association, the Liyang County Government issued a notice on September 21st, stating, in brief, that Chairman Pan Xisheng of the county's Disaster Relief Association had reported severe disaster conditions in the county. All rice entering or leaving the county would be subject to a donation of three cents per "shi" (unit of dry measure) for unhusked rice and six cents per "shi" for husked rice, which was approved for record and enforcement. Inspection stations were established at the Jiaojie (border) and Kunlun bridges along the Yili (Yixing-Liyang) border, forcibly collecting donations from rice boats. This disguised form of forced levy is worse than local customs duties. If other counties follow suit, it would severely hinder the people's food supply, an unbearable situation. They requested assistance. Upon investigation, the association found that Jiangsu Province had suffered severe flooding, but Liyang, due to its higher elevation, was only slightly affected in terms of glutinous rice and was actually lighter than other counties. Furthermore, it is a major producing area of Indica rice, relied upon by disaster victims in other counties. Now, the county is forcibly levying rice donations. Assuming an average of 300 "shi" of unhusked rice per boat, each boat would be subject to a donation of over ten yuan. If other places along the route were to follow suit, the rice arriving in Shanghai, which must pass through Wuxi, Suzhou, and Kunshan, would be subject to multiple layers of harsh taxation, adding an extra burden of up to a hundred yuan per boat, a harm worse than local customs duties and extortion worse than corrupt officials. Food is the most important thing for the people. The government is even temporarily reducing business taxes on rice to benefit disaster victims. Yet, this county's disaster relief donation does not solicit contributions from wealthy merchants but forcibly levies taxes on all rice entering or leaving the county, intending to increase the cost of food for other counties' people, benefiting itself at the expense of others. Moreover, the notice only states the date of commencement but not the date of termination. Judging by the county's rice exports, the extent of the disaster is evident. If inspection and verification are implemented, the abuses will be endless. The county initially, based on a request from unscrupulous gentry, prohibited rice exports. It was only after rice merchants from various places petitioned the provincial government that passage was allowed. Subsequently, a scoundrel merchant, Binglin Shang, blocked bridge holes with huge logs at the Jiaojie bridge. Rice boats were not allowed to pass unless they were extorted. The ship merchants turned him in to the county office, but he was not punished and was immediately released. Finally, the Disaster Relief Association issued an open order for forced levy. The clues clearly show collusion, using the name of disaster relief to collect money, directly affecting the people's food supply and indirectly harming disaster victims, setting a bad precedent for disaster relief donations and giving unscrupulous local people opportunities for embezzlement, disregarding neighboring disasters, disregarding the people's food supply, nothing could be worse. Therefore, we specially petition your bureau, department, and association to forward this matter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, taking into consideration the severe disaster situation in various counties, to promptly order the Liyang County Government to cancel the forced rice donations for disaster relief and dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the Disaster Relief Association and the inspection stations' income and expenditure accounts to prevent embezzlement. The people's food supply will be fortunate, and the disaster victims will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Qian Xinzhi Resigns as Envoy to France</h3>
<p>In recent days, diplomatic relations have been strained, and the international situation has suddenly become serious. The newly appointed envoy to France, Qian Xinzhi, has repeatedly declined the appointment since being nominated. However, recently, due to strained diplomatic relations, the market has become tense simultaneously. Mr. Qian has been involved in the financial sector for many years and has handled many businesses. In this current situation, he cannot easily leave his position. However, the position of envoy to France is important and should not be vacant for too long. Therefore, he took the Wednesday night train to Beijing to meet with the authorities and request that they quickly appoint a capable person to replace him, so that the important position would not be vacant for long, and he could focus on his efforts in the financial sector to act as a rearguard for society in its relations with the outside world.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Gradually Resuming Operations</h3>
<p>The issuance of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds will soon reach one month. Silk factories in the city are repairing their machinery, replenishing raw materials, and making efforts to resume operations. Currently, it has been found that 65 silk factories in Shanghai have resumed operations, including 16 in the Hongkou district, 34 in the northern district, 11 in the concession area, and 4 in the southern district. The remaining factories are still preparing to resume operations.</p>

<h3>Engineer Drafts Plan to Dam the Grand Canal</h3>
<p>Completion in Two Months, Severe Punishment for Delay</p>
<p>Estimated Cost of Approximately 3.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Representatives from seven counties in northern Jiangsu who have suffered from flooding met at the Wu residence on Xinzha Road at 10:00 AM yesterday (25th). He Mingpu presided over the meeting and reported that today marks one month since the dike breaches of the Grand Canal have caused damage in Gaoyou, Xinghua, Shaobo, Yancheng, Taixing, and Dongtai. He asked everyone to stand and observe a moment of silence. Qiu Minggao proposed that the breaches have been in place for a month, and while they have heard about solutions every day, the water continues to pour eastward, and the disaster area continues to expand. Those responsible are simply stalling, and no one knows when the water will recede. He suggested that people from the capital and Shanghai should petition separately, demanding that the provincial authorities be responsible for announcing a deadline for completely repairing the breaches, so that the more than two million compatriots suffering in the water can find some comfort. Shen Zhuowu reported that he had visited the breach sites three times and, together with the foreign engineers invited as representatives, conducted an on-site survey. He said that repairing the breaches is relatively easy, and Chairman Ye is extremely anxious to find a proper solution. Yesterday, he accompanied Engineer Zhuo to deliver the engineering drawings and plans to Chairman Ye. He has no copies of the drawings, but he has a copy of the plan (see the original text below), which he is distributing for review and to urge completion. Everyone has a responsibility, and he hopes that all compatriots will work together to achieve success. In addition to this plan, there is also a descriptive statement and a cost estimate that he did not have time to copy. The general idea is that the Chinese and foreign engineers are fulfilling their mutual assistance obligation by contributing their opinions to the best of their ability and addressing the urgent desire of the people in the disaster area to stop the water. If they are commissioned to handle the project, they will prepare the arrangements for approximately one month and complete the project within two months after construction begins. If there is any delay, they are willing to accept the customary laws of river management, including capital punishment, to demonstrate their determination to succeed. The four major breaches may be tested with one or two sites, but this has not yet been decided. The total cost is estimated to be approximately 3.9 million yuan. The total length of the breaches in the eastern and western embankments is 10,150 feet, and all will be repaired. It is expected that a decision can be made within one or two days. Currently, there are suggestions for both new and old methods, and one can be chosen for comparison and implementation. He hopes that enthusiastic fellow countrymen will dedicate themselves to calling for action and that various disaster relief organizations will prepare bamboo, bark, wooden planks, and reed mats worth tens of thousands of yuan to be transported to the areas affected by the water. After blocking the water, these materials will be distributed to the victims to build shelters and residences, which will be a great act of merit. Mr. Zhuowu Shen met with Mr. Junren Xu last night and personally requested his attention and assistance. Otherwise, with so many disaster victims, the few shelters that exist can only accommodate one-tenth or one-fifth, which is not helpful. He strongly urged people to control their anger and urge the blocking of the breaches so that it can be implemented as soon as possible and to check whether the repaired dam is solid, which is essential. He also recommended Mr. Shen to draft the regulations and declaration of the Northern Jiangsu Disaster Relief Association and decided to publish a request for disaster relief plans for Northern Jiangsu, compile them, and distribute them for discussion and implementation.</p>
<p>Plan to Repair and Block the Dike Breaches of the Grand Canal: The most dangerous breaches currently in the Grand Canal are located at Danggjunlou, Miaoxiang Alley, Lotus Pond, and Zhaoguan Dam. Based on the results of the on-site survey, the following methods are proposed:</p>
<p>(1) Repairing the breaches: Based on the method of repairing the Gongjia breach of the Yellow River in Shandong in previous years, place (1) a steam pile driver at the starting point of the breach and drive wooden piles horizontally to form pile rows every five feet. On the outside of the dike, drive sloping water-facing pile rows at regular intervals to reduce the force of the water. At the same time, connect all the piles and place appropriate stones and soil underneath, advancing in this order until the breach is closed. This method can be compared to the Gongjia Dam, which has been in place for nine years and has withstood major floods without damage, which can be verified. The four breaches will be started simultaneously, with the west dike being repaired first, followed by the east dike.</p>
<p>(2) The situation of the breaches: The Danggjunlou and Miaoxiang Alley have the largest water flow, and the eastern dike breach is the most dangerous, with a total of 3,450 feet. The western dike breach has a total of 3,950 feet. In these two breaches, there is still a section of the old dike, which will be properly protected. The Lotus Pond eastern dike breach has a total of 1,020 feet, and the western dike breach has 1,035 feet. The water flow here is relatively calm, and construction is easier. The Zhaoguan Dam eastern dike breach has a total of 565 feet, and the western dike breach has 130 feet. Although this breach is narrower than the previous three, the survey found it to be quite dangerous. Because there is a deep whirlpool near the western dike, and the old eastern dike is easily susceptible to being shaken, it is decided to change the direction at the end of the western dike and add a protective dam of more than 100 feet. A self-regulating sluice gate will be built at a suitable location, so that the deep whirlpool area can rely on the siltation of the water flow to gradually increase its height and reduce the danger.</p>
<p>(3) Materials required: The materials required for repairing the four breaches are calculated as follows: (A) Danggjunlou and Miaoxiang Alley require a total of 3,008,000 feet of Oregon pine piles; (B) Lotus Pond requires 861,000 feet of Oregon pine; (C) Zhaoguan Dam requires 294,000 feet of Oregon pine piles. In addition to wooden piles, the breaches also require 50,000 stones, 100,000 hemp bags, and 250,000 cubic feet of earth.</p>
<p>(4) The width of the dike: After the breaches are repaired, the dike surface will be 30 feet wide, the dike base will be 90 feet wide, and the height will be approximately 2 feet higher than the current dike height. If only firewood, soil, and stones are used to fill these dangerous breaches, the dike surface can be widened by 20 or 30 feet, but the dike body cannot be so strong. Now, wooden piles are driven deep and tightly clamped with stones, with soil compacted in between, which will solidify over time.</p>
<p>(5) Location for extracting and transporting stone and soil: The soil required is enormous, and there is no place to extract it near the dike. It is proposed to extract 50,000 cubic feet of soil from the Beiwantou area north of Yangzhou and 200,000 cubic feet of soil from the Jinjiang area near Zhenjiang. The stones will also be sourced from the vicinity of Zhenjiang. The extraction, transportation, loading, and unloading of the soil are extremely complicated and require a lot of labor. It is proposed to employ disaster victims as laborers in a form of work relief. The soil, however, has no place to be stacked at the breaches, making construction even more troublesome. A cubic foot of soil must be moved ten times before it can be used, and due to the time constraints, scientific methods must be used to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<h3>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>Plan to Breach the Changwei Dike in Dafeng to Release Water: The association recently received a letter from the Xinghua Disaster Relief Branch stating that it has sent a draft telegram to the National Ministry of Interior and the Huai River Conservancy Commission for review and publicity. The telegram to the National Ministry of Interior and the Huai River Conservancy Commission (excerpt) stated: Xinghua is located in the lower reaches of the Grand Canal in Jiangsu Province, shaped like the bottom of a cauldron, and is the lowest-lying area among the six counties of Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixing, Dongtai, Yancheng and Funing. This year, the Hongze Lake flooded and the water level of the Grand Canal rose. In the autumn, the three dams of Che Nan, Xin, and San were opened, and the lower reaches of each county had become a swamp. Since the breach of the Grand Canal, the water level has risen to over ten feet. Gaoyou and Xinghua bore the brunt of the damage, with countless houses destroyed and people and livestock dead. The remaining disaster victims cried out, and the postal and telecommunications were disrupted, making rescue impossible. The situation was extremely dire. Fortunately, the Provincial Disaster Relief Association and various charitable organizations from China and abroad have come to Xinghua to save lives and shelter refugees, but it is impossible for one county to accommodate the people of another county. The disaster victims are suffering in the water, and their clothing, food, shelter, and transportation are extremely difficult. The most urgent task is to dredge the waterways to the sea to remove the blockage and to close the breaches to stop the source of the water, so that the people in the lower reaches of the river can have a chance of survival. Upon investigation, the waterways to the sea, apart from the Sheyang and Xinyang ports belonging to Yancheng and Funing, which are relatively easy to discharge, the Wang and Zhu ports in Dongtai are not connected to the sea. Only the Doulong Port in Xinghua is a vital channel for discharge, which meanders and twists for more than 300 li. In normal times, the discharge is already smooth, but it still relies on the seven original diversion rivers east of the port, which can discharge west-flowing water flatly into the sea. Therefore, although there was a breach at QingShuiTan in the 5th year of the Tongzhi reign, the water receded completely in a few days. Since the Republic of China, the government has only focused on reclamation to generate revenue and has never considered the great relationship between water conservancy and the life of farmland. As a result, over 100 li of the grassy marsh east of Doulong Port has been reclaimed and developed by the Taifeng and Zhuanghua Companies, and the original seven diversion rivers have been buried. The company has built several north-south dikes along the Maoyou River east, which impede the flow to the sea. This flood is unprecedented in scale, and disaster victims in various counties have unanimously called for the prompt opening of the outlets of the Maoyou Rivers to the sea to save the emergency. However, the Provincial Government dispatched personnel to open only a section of 800 zhang of the Wang Port, which is too short and the flow rate is minimal. Other sections of the Maoyou River opened were also not thorough. Therefore, the current water level has only receded by two or three inches. Shanghai China Economic Society member Sun Yunchuang, together with representatives from Xinghua and Dongtai counties, surveyed the undeveloped area of the Dafeng Company and found that there are six long Changwei dikes that are 15 li long each, which are obstructing water discharge. It is proposed to open 810 level breaches, with 10 zhang opened every 20 zhang, which will increase the amount of water discharged to the sea. The width would be 1,350 zhang, and the water level on the beach would be three feet, allowing it to flow flatly into the sea, without harming the crops on the company's already reclaimed land. Moreover, Zhu Jingci, the representative of the company, has agreed. Chen Zhanen, the section chief of the Ministry of Interior, and Xu Ji, a member of the Construction Department, have also surveyed the site and deemed it to be the most important solution. Mr. Sun estimates that it will cost 25,000 yuan and plans to recruit disaster victims to open the dikes as a form of work relief. He has already telegraphed the Disaster Relief Association for assistance and requests that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be notified to handle the matter accordingly. This is the first point regarding the dredging of the downstream waterways to the sea to save the disaster victims. Secondly, there are 27 breaches in the Grand Canal in the Jiangdu and Gaoyou sections, with a width of over 800 zhang. The most dangerous breaches are located at Danggjunlou, Lotus Pond, Qigongdian, Miaoxiang, Xiaocheluo, Nan Zhaoguan Dam and North Zhaoguan Dam. The project is huge and requires a large amount of funds. The Provincial Government has only raised 5 million yuan for the Grand Canal repair and damming, which is still insufficient. It is proposed to request the central government to allocate funds for subsidizing the National Flood Disaster Committee to oversee the Provincial Government's handling of the matter, which would be easier to implement. As for the construction plan, it is necessary to enlist specialized personnel to assist and to determine how the disaster victims in the counties along the Grand Canal should be assigned work and implemented as soon as possible. It is requested that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be notified to handle these matters promptly. This is the second point regarding repairing and damming the breaches of the Grand Canal in the upper reaches to save the disaster victims. In addition to telegraphing the Huai River Conservancy Commission (Ministry of Interior) for approval, we also telegraph this request for your review, hoping that you will consider the severity of the disaster in the lower reaches of the Northern Jiangsu counties and issue orders for prompt handling of these matters, as we await your instructions with the utmost urgency.

<p>Situation of Disaster Relief in Baoying: As Baoying is north of Gaoyou and has also suffered heavily, the association has established a Baoying office to provide disaster relief and shelter locally. According to a letter from the office, it has been rescuing over 1,000 people daily, sheltering over 1,000 people, sending away 800 to 900 people, and providing medical care to 30 to 40 people daily through Chinese and Western medicine. Preparations for livestock protection are underway.</p>
<h3>Liyang</h3>
<p>County Party Headquarters Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Raise Donations</p>
<p>Liyang County has experienced crop failure of silkworms and wheat this year, followed by floods and typhoons, which have submerged all rice crops and destroyed countless houses. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. With the weather gradually turning cold, 300,000 disaster victims are in dire need of food and clothing. The County Party Headquarters could not bear to stand idly by. In addition to working with local government agencies to raise funds and distribute relief clothing, they have dispatched Fang Zhengqing, Qian Benyi, Wu Zhifang, and Zhang Qiyuan to Shanghai on the 22nd to raise donations.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Distributes Relief Funds</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society held a special standing committee meeting the day before yesterday to resolve matters related to the distribution of relief funds. Those present included Wang Yiting, Yao Yuqin, Ha Shaofu, Wen Lanting, Wang Peiyuan, Zhang Nieyun, and more than ten others. Wang Yiting chaired the meeting, and Wei Ruifeng served as the recorder. After discussion, it was decided to allocate 7,500 yuan each to Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan, 3,000 yuan to Jiangxi, 5,000 yuan to Henan, 2,000 yuan to Zhejiang, 2,000 yuan to Guangdong, and 2,000 yuan to Sichuan. The distribution procedures will be carried out jointly by the local Red Cross branches, local public and private agencies, and organizations. The procedures for disaster victims to receive relief and the register will be compiled and sent to the General Association for record.</p>
<h3>Li Zushen Reports on Disaster Relief in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces held an interim meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Xu Shiying delivered a speech to welcome Mr. Li Zushen, who came to Shanghai from Wuhan, and to offer his condolences. Then, Mr. Li reported on the disaster relief situation in Hubei Province, stating that Hubei was in a period of emergency rescue from August 1st to 16th. On the 18th, the water rose by 5.2 feet, and the defense works were completely destroyed, almost a natural disaster that could not be salvaged by human power. The water at the railway embankment was 15.5 feet high. On the 27th, General Zhu Ziqiao arrived in Wuhan and discussed building a road. The initial plan was to buy hemp bags and build an earthen road, which would cost about 200,000 yuan. Later, because there was no place to get soil, they changed to using wooden planks to build a frame, and the wooden planks were borrowed, so the cost was more than 20,000 yuan. Emergency relief is now underway in the area, and the association has also organized four teams to investigate the relief in Echeng, Huanggang, Daye, and Huangpi counties. The first team is in Xindi, the second team is in Fankou, the third team is in Huanggang, and the fourth team is in Qingshan. There is currently 80,000 yuan, which can support them for about half a month. I privately propose that the association can continue to bear the burden of relief in these four counties for a period of two months. As for the relief funds, please continue to allocate and remit them. I plan to return to Hankou tomorrow. Since it was late, the other cases and the points reported by Mr. Li Zushen were all submitted to the 10th regular meeting next Wednesday for discussion. The dinner party started at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Willing to Survey Disaster Area</h3>
<p>According to the China Press, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China has notified the National Flood Relief Committee that he is willing to use the aircraft of the British aircraft carrier HMS Hermes, which is currently docked in Hankou, to survey the disaster area for China.

<h3>News from Various Circles on Aiding Relief</h3>
<p>Puyi Society Disaster Relief Auction: The Puyi Society of Datongmen recently held a fundraising concert, and the ticket sales totaled over 500 yuan. Nine disaster relief cakes donated by Westerners were sold on the spot for 45 yuan. The funds are now being sent to relief agencies for distribution and reported to the Social Bureau. In addition, a large number of clothing and supplies have been collected in recent days. Apart from some of them which have been sent to Shanghai reception centers, there are many valuable daily necessities which are planned to be sold from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM today (Saturday) at the Society. All circles of society are welcome to buy in order to help the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Typhoon Changes Direction</p>
<h3>Merchant Ships Are Sailing</h3>
<p>The typhoon is headed northeast: The wind direction of yesterday's typhoon has changed to the northeast. Shanghai only had showers. The typhoon is now in the Yellow Sea, and there are cyclones between Ma'an Island and Kyushu, but the fog at sea has not completely cleared. The navigation industry in this port is no longer affected. The Haiyan ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was in Wenzhou, sailed to nearby islands to avoid the typhoon when it started blowing. A telegram was sent yesterday afternoon reporting that the typhoon had passed and the ship had resumed normal operations. Other ships that were sheltering from the typhoon outside the Wusong mouth can also set sail. The postal ship Cravoca and the cargo ship Moncala of the Italian Post Company were delayed by one day due to sheltering from the typhoon in Xiamen. A telegram was sent yesterday afternoon stating that they have already set sail and will arrive today.</p>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is resuming: Yesterday, the Shanghai-Ningbo liners New Beijing of the Taikoo Company and New Ningshao of the Ningshao Company still risked sailing to Shanghai. Therefore, the two ships will still sail as usual at 5:00 PM. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Jiangtian and the Sanbei Company's Ningxing were stopped from exporting by the Jianghai Customs the day before yesterday. As the wind has changed direction yesterday, the two ships are scheduled to operate as usual today. In addition, the ships to Wenzhou and Chongming, which were suspended due to the wind, have all departed yesterday. The Ningshao and other ships of the Taikoo Company also departed yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>New Dutch Ship Found to Have Smuggled Firearms</h3>
<p>The new Dutch ship Gelskerkerk, which was making its first trip to the Far East, arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon and anchored in the Pudong area. After the customs searched it as usual for several hours, 31,420 Mauser bullets were found, but no smugglers were arrested.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Robbery Case to Be Heard</h3>
<p>A Portuguese national, Langier, colluded with eight Chinese individuals to commit armed robbery at 62 Xinzha Road on the 7th of this month. He was arrested on the 17th of this month at 26 Nanxun Road. The case was preliminarily investigated by the Portuguese Consulate Court in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and the evidence has been completed. The case will be heard at the beginning of next week.</p>
<h3>Tide-Watching Special Train Suspended</h3>
<p>Every autumn, the tides are at their highest, and the Zhejiang tides are especially spectacular. The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau routinely sets up a tide-watching station in Haining. The China Travel Service used to open a bus service from Hangzhou to Haining to watch the tides at Haining, which was very popular. This autumn, the Railway Bureau and the China Travel Service were preparing as usual, and those who bought tickets came one after another. However, the flood has caused havoc, affecting 16 provinces. Recently, Japan has also advanced troops to Liaoning and Jilin. Natural disasters and national disasters are pressing. In this serious situation, the Railway Bureau and the travel agency, which is under a state of distress, have resolutely decided to suspend the tide-watching special train, although it would incur a significant loss.</p>
<h3>China Society Holds Annual Meeting of Members</h3>
<p>The China Society on Weihaiwei Road in this port will soon be one year since its establishment. The Society's affairs have developed rapidly.

<h3>Arresting a Constable for Extortion of One Hundred Gold Pieces</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment After Capture</p>
<p>Xie Yuehui, a Jiangbei native who previously served as Constable No. 3119 in the Yangshupu Police Station, was dismissed from his position last month on the 11th after being caught smoking opium in a certain opium den. Unable to find other employment, Constable Liu Yaying of the northern box division gave him four dollars for travel expenses to return to his hometown. However, Xie felt resentful because his dismissal was instigated by Constable Liu, and on the 17th of this month, he returned to Shanghai and wrote two threatening letters. He delivered them to Constable Liu's residence at a certain address in Huaxingfang, Yangshupu. The language in the letters was extremely fierce, demanding one hundred dollars and arranging for payment at Liu's house the day before yesterday. Xie secretly went there, and happened to encounter undercover Chinese Constable No. 2306, who asked him what he was doing. Xie claimed he wanted to find business for Constable Liu, or else he would give Yuan Tou a hundred dollars and seek other opportunities. Constable Liu, who was upstairs, knew Xie had come to cause trouble and was unreasonable, so he used the telephone to notify the Yangshupu Police Station. Detective Chen Youling was dispatched and arrested Xie, taking him to the police station. Yesterday morning, Xie was escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, presented the case, requesting a strict investigation. The threatening letters were submitted for inspection, and it was stated that, according to the defendant's confession at the police station, the threatening letters were written by his teacher Yang Guangxian and fellow townsman Zhang Bingchang. However, the defendant had previously sent a letter to Constable Liu from his hometown, also borrowing money, and the handwriting was the same as the two threatening letters. This letter was also presented as evidence. Subsequently, Constable Liu and undercover Chinese Constable No. 2306 gave their testimonies. When questioned, the defendant denied writing the two threatening letters, offering evasive answers. Judge Xiao Xiefen examined the confession and ordered him to write numbers in court. Upon inspection, the handwriting was very similar to the three letters. Xie Yuehui was sentenced to three years imprisonment and the threatening letters were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Homicide Case Arising from Lust and Greed Results in Conviction</h3>
<p>Xu Guozhang Sentenced to Twelve Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Xu Guozhang, a native of Changzhou and a partner in Ma Dunhe Pharmacy located at No. 1039 Dongyouheng Road, on the 8th of this month at midnight, entered the bedroom of the shop owner, Ma Youzhi, a native of Zhenjiang, while intoxicated. Taking advantage of Ma's deep sleep, he used a medicine-cutting knife to violently hack at Ma's head, chest, and back, causing injuries. Ma cried for help, and someone reported it to Chinese Constable No. 1168, who was stationed outside. The constable apprehended Xu and handed him over to the First Special District Court. It was found that the motive was for money and sexual desire, as reported in this newspaper. The interrogation has concluded, and the case was awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the Third Criminal Division and sentenced Xu Guozhang to twelve years imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment is final will be credited at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Case Cracked on the Java Ship</h3>
<p>Smuggler Ni Cailang, along with his accomplice Wu Shangshi, smuggled a nine-year-old boy named Xiaogouzi, a fifteen-year-old girl named Weng Dahe, and Ye Gendi, etc. Yesterday, they were aboard the Java Company's mail ship, planning to take the children to Xiamen for sale. However, Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the relief association, along with Detectives Hu Changqing and Yao Guofa from the police station, boarded the ship and discovered them. They falsely claimed to be father and daughters, but because the girl and grandson were all from Jiangbei, their accents were different, so they were taken to the police station for questioning. It was confirmed that they had been abducted, so they were transferred to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Yang Linxiang's Tragic Death - Autopsy Waived</h3>
<p>The death of villager Yang Linxiang from Jiayi Bridge Village in the Caoging District of Xixiang, was rumored to be a murder committed by his wife, Yang Anan, due to a love affair. Because the corpse had decomposed, the court ordered the coffin to be brought to the court to steam the bones for examination. However, the corpse has not yet been delivered. Yesterday, the deceased's brother, Fusheng, and his mother turned themselves in, stating that his brother committed suicide by hanging himself and wished to open the coffin for examination. They cited local customs, stating that opening the coffin for examination would inevitably lead to the death of future generations, making it impossible for the remaining orphan to survive. Yang only left behind one son and did not wish to abandon him. Therefore, his brother and mother petitioned the local court yesterday, requesting to waive the transportation of the coffin to Shanghai and the opening of the coffin for examination, so that their descendants may prosper, etc. Prosecutor Wu convened a court session and ordered them to sign a pledge, closing the case.</p>
<h3>Widow with Substantial Wealth Deceived</h3>
<p>Accusation of Abandonment by Lover</p>
<p>The woman Qin Wenjuan, represented by lawyers Yan Jinyu and Li Yuan, filed a criminal complaint with the Second Special Court, stating that after her husband passed away seven years ago, she lived as a widow, relying on her inheritance. A man named Wang Yuqing, seeing that she had a lot of money, developed designs on her and seduced her. The plaintiff was weak-willed and was deceived into a cohabiting relationship. The following year, she gave birth to a daughter, who is now six years old. Unexpectedly, the defendant Wang Yuqing gradually tricked the plaintiff out of her entire fortune of over 30,000 dollars and then abandoned her, leaving her with no means of support. Therefore, she filed this complaint, requesting that the defendant be severely punished for abandonment, and to recover the defrauded funds and the daughter's education expenses of 5,000 dollars, etc. During yesterday's hearing, the plaintiff Qin Wenjuan stated that after she began cohabitating with the defendant, he used the excuse of lacking capital for business to gradually defraud her of her wealth. Now that he knows she has no more money and has affairs with others, he abandoned her. The lawyers made their arguments, and the defendant Wang Yuqing claimed that he and the plaintiff were simply lovers, not a formal married couple. He stated that the plaintiff was addicted to opium, and in the first month of last year, she absconded with all the money, spending it all. He claimed the case was a false accusation, requesting an investigation, and hired a lawyer to represent him. The lawyer stated that to accuse the defendant of abandonment under criminal law, it must be proven that they are a formal married couple and that there is an obligation to provide support. Since the plaintiff cannot prove her status and has no obligation to provide support, she cannot rashly accuse him of abandonment, which is unreasonable. He requested that the accusation be dismissed and that he be allowed to countersue for false accusation and theft. As for the daughter, it must be confirmed in civil court whether she is his biological child or if they both adopted her before any further questioning. The presiding judge declared the arguments closed and adjourned the court to deliberate.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Partner's Wife Hanging Herself</h3>
<p>Argument with Husband Over Money for Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<p>Depressed, She Hanged Herself and Died After Being Sent to the Hospital</p>
<p>Xie Cai, a young woman from Nanjing, was 24 years old and lived in a rented room on the second floor of Zhenxingli No. 16, Zilai Street, in the French Concession. Her husband, Hui Lin, used to be in the metal business, but now he is just a partner, and his income is limited. Because the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, and money was needed everywhere, she argued with Hui Lin due to financial difficulties. Afterwards, she became extremely depressed and, taking advantage of the fact that no one was watching, secretly consumed raw opium to commit suicide. She was later sent to Renji Hospital in a vehicle, but the treatment was ineffective, and she died at around 4 PM.</p>
<h3>Six Children Bitten by Yellow Dog</h3>
<p>Shot and Killed on the Spot After Capture</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a yellow dog was found wandering on Moganshan Road, biting anyone it encountered. One child living nearby was bitten by the dog, and then it bit other children, totaling six. The Pudulu Police Station in charge of the area was informed and immediately sent officers to chase the dog. They fired two shots and killed the dog. The injured children were all sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Explanation from the Municipal Finance Bureau</p>
<h3>Key Points for Reporting and Calculating Business Tax</h3>
<p>Reply to the Letter from the Various Industry Tax Research Association</p>
<p>The Various Industry Tax Research Committee of this city previously sent a letter to the Municipal Finance Bureau, stating that with the implementation of business tax imminent, the key points for reporting and calculating taxes urgently needed clarification. The bureau responded yesterday, stating that they had received the letter stating that the business tax was about to be implemented in this city, but because it was a new undertaking, detailed explanations were needed. The letter addressed each point and explained as follows: (1) Article 3 of the Implementing Rules of the Shanghai Municipality Business Tax Collection Ordinance stipulates that all those who collect business tax within the Shanghai area must apply for a business tax investigation certificate. Those who do not meet the business tax requirements do not need to apply for a business tax investigation certificate. (2) Regarding the proposal for the dental industry in this city, those who have not obtained a dental license within the special zone should pay tax according to the tax rate of the corresponding business tax category, according to the table. (3) The business situation of the construction industry is special, and it is difficult to accurately estimate income, which is indeed the case. However, the industry can report its total business income for the previous year. (4) Article 9 of the Shanghai Municipality Business Tax Collection Ordinance stipulates that manufacturers who directly retail their manufactured goods at their manufacturing site are still taxed according to the manufacturing industry regulations. If the manufacturing site is limited to the factory address, and the goods are sold away from the manufacturing site, they should still be taxed according to the sales industry regulations. The letter was sent accordingly.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Sinhwa Bank Shareholders Meeting</h3>
<p>Charter Approved and Directors and Supervisors Elected</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Sinhwa Trust and Savings Bank, all shares have been fully paid up. Yesterday, the first shareholders' meeting was convened at the Hong Kong Road Bankers' Association. 195 shareholders attended, representing 19,093 shares and 3,503 voting rights. Lin Kanghou was publicly elected as temporary chairman. After the opening ceremony, the chairman delivered an opening speech and reported on the reorganization process and the recruitment of new shares on behalf of the board of directors. Then, accountant Xu Yongzuo, representing the supervisors, reported on the accounts for 1919. After the report, the board of directors presented a temporary motion. Director Fang came to Shanghai to express the opinions of the Old Shareholders Maintenance Association, stating that they felt extremely pained by the decision made at the temporary shareholders' meeting on September 21 of last year to reduce old shares to 10%. They asked if the percentage could be increased or if there were other ways to compensate for the disappointment. The reduction of old shares had already been decided by the previous shareholders' meeting and filed with the ministry, so it could not be changed. It was proposed to actively reorganize the old accounts and, after the old assets were liquidated to offset the old debts, any remaining amount would be returned to the old shareholders. This matter was of great importance and should be decided by the shareholders. The chairman put this proposal to a vote, and the majority raised their hands in approval. Next, the chairman read the draft charter. Except for a slight amendment to Article 25, all other articles were approved as originally written. The election of directors and supervisors was held: Feng Youwei, Hu Mengjia, Zhang Gongquan, Song Hanzhang, Bian Baimei, Yang Yinshun, Yuan Songfan, Fang Renyuan, and Wang Zhixin were elected as directors; Bei Songsun, Qin Runqing, Wu Yunxiu, and Wang Xiaotong were elected as alternate directors; Wang Lengbo, Zhuang Shuhao, and Tang Shoumin were elected as supervisors; and Ye Xiaan, Shi Jiu'ao, and Liu Tiecheng were elected as alternate supervisors. After the election, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<h3>Mr. Liu Jibang Asks</h3>
<p>(Willing to Undertake Military Education in Schools Unconditionally)</p>
<p>I am a 23-year-old youth. Since graduating from the Whampoa Military and Political School in the 16th year of the Republic, I have been living in seclusion in Shanghai. For the past few years, I have been making a living solely by my pen, so my financial situation is self-evident. But there is a reason why I have been living in seclusion and not seeking an outlet for my education. I now dare to tell you, sir. First, the state establishes military schools for the sake of fighting for the nation's position, not for private individuals. Recently, those who fight for power and profit only want us to sacrifice for them personally, so I have softened, and all for this reason. Second, my old mother is at home, my elder brother is far away, and I am living a floating life at sea, with no one to take care of her morning and evening. Therefore, I have softened, and this is also a reason. I believe you understand what I am saying.</p>
<p>But having said all this, I have not yet expressed my requested opinion. Sir, let me continue. In the past few days, the news in the newspapers has caused everyone who has read it to have their eyes cracked and their gall bladders broken. Everyone knows that the Japanese Empire has always been barbaric and unreasonable. Judging from the current national spirit of our country, it has been aroused to the highest boiling point. Some are demanding that an ultimatum be issued. I think the letter is easy to send, but I am afraid that when the time comes, we will be at a loss. Moreover, observing the current attitude of the government, there is still no clear decision, and it seems ambiguous. Those who want to issue an ultimatum, I think, are merely expressing a momentary anger and have nowhere to vent their anger. My opinion is that if the national affairs break down, we will need to use our people. When the time comes, we will have no way to call on us. Therefore, my decision is that all primary and secondary schools should receive military education to avoid being at a loss. Therefore, I want to ask you to use the space in your newspaper to solicit support. If there are schools willing to receive military education, I am willing to teach what I have learned unconditionally. I think you will all sympathize. Address: 50 Tongchangli, Hening Road, this port. (Reply) Your usual conduct is so unpretentious and respectable. Now, in view of the national crisis, you are willing to undertake military education in schools unconditionally. How dare we not disclose your enthusiasm in this newspaper and introduce you? However, only Boy Scout education can be implemented in junior high school and below, and this point should also be taken into account.</p>
<h3>Mr. Mu Gengxun Asks (How to Recognize Japanese Goods)</h3>
<p>I read your newspaper's article on the 23rd of this month, "Mr. Shen Gengyao Asks," your second reply "Do not use Japanese goods." I also very much wish to permanently fulfill this article. However, there is one prerequisite problem, which is "How to Recognize Japanese Goods." Japanese people are extremely cunning, and not all goods have "Made in Japan" on them (those who do not know English, even if there is this word, do not understand). In addition, many of our country's unscrupulous merchants often refuse to tell the truth. When encountering the above situation, how should we distinguish between genuine and fake, and what kind of countermeasures should we take? Please advise.</p>
<p>(Reply) We should ask those who are old in the business world and can distinguish Japanese goods to compile various explanatory books on Japanese goods, explaining that important Japanese goods have this quality, this color, this pattern, and are Japanese goods. If they are not like this, they are not Japanese goods. Disseminate them widely for everyone to read. We hope that various public organizations that handle the boycott of Japanese goods will pay attention to this point.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Mengshi Asks (Anti-Japanese Slogans to Save the Country)</h3>
<p>Sir, I am a young man who pays close attention to the national situation, especially the ambitious neighbors to the east. In recent years, their so-called unfortunate events have emerged one after another. I have often wanted to commit suicide to inspire the people, but I feel that it is useless, and I can't bear to abandon my white-haired parents. I wanted to join the army, but I have been forced to delay until now due to economic pressures. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Empire, which destroys world peace, suddenly occupied our Eastern Province territory on the morning of the 19th. When the bad news came, the party departments at all levels in our county (Changshu) immediately held an emergency meeting and posted eye-catching slogans on bamboo cloth banners in the bustling streets. I couldn't bear to read them to the end. Looking around at my compatriots, many are still resentful. If we don't wake up soon, we will surely perish as a nation. How terrible! Therefore, I plan to write several slogans and post them in the streets, but I am afraid of violating the law and being punished. I would like to borrow the space in your newspaper to guide me. I am very grateful. The slogans are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Japanese are invading our territory, the national crisis has arrived, compatriots wake up quickly!</p>
<p>The people of the whole country unite as one and support the government!</p>
<p>At the critical moment of life and death, the people of the country wake up and work together to survive!</p>
<p>Rather die in battle on the border than bow our heads and become slaves!</p>
<p>The people of the whole country mobilize and work together to resist foreign aggression!</p>
<p>The survival of China depends on this, compatriots wake up!</p>
<p>(Reply) Very good. We will publish your slogans in the newspaper for all to see. However, we must all cultivate our strength. What is strength? It is three things: (1) train the body, (2) study science, (3) increase production.</p>

<p>Henan Promotes New Policies</p>
<h3>Sending Personnel to Europe and America for Observation</h3>
<p>Six people each to Europe and America</p>
<p>Expenses: 130,000</p>
<p>Henan is a land of constant warfare. Since the founding of the Republic, every time war has broken out, Henan Province has been dragged into the vortex. Last year, Tang Shengzhi's rebellion was followed by Yan and Feng, who mobilized troops in Henan Province, making it the destination for both sides' warfare. Over the years, it has suffered the calamity of war, and the local vitality has been greatly damaged. Now that the war has ended, the Provincial Chairman Liu Jingfu is making every effort to focus on construction. Henan has sent personnel to Europe and America once since 1919. Twelve years have passed since then, and no one has been sent abroad. Now, Chairman Liu believes that to carry out the new construction of Henan, specialized talents are necessary to achieve success. Therefore, he consulted with the Director of Education, Li Jingzhai, and decided to allocate 120,000 yuan from the education funds to send special personnel abroad to study new European and American policies, as the foundation for carrying out the new construction of Henan Province after their return. After the agreement was made, twelve people including Lu Ren'an were designated to go to various countries in Europe and America. Lu and others have arrived in Shanghai and are scheduled to set sail today. This time, Lu and others are going abroad for observation, which is an initiative in Henan's politics. Our reporter made a special visit to Mr. Lu and others to inquire about everything in detail. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Independent Educational Funds　The reporter met Lu Ren'an, Li Xukai, and others, and asked about the motivation for Henan Province sending personnel abroad for observation this time. According to Mr. Lu and others, Henan has suffered more from the pain of war than any other province. Since the founding of the Republic, there has been almost no year of stability. All administrative affairs have been suspended, and nothing has been done. Since the end of the Yan-Feng war, Henan has finally escaped from military administration. However, locally, whether it is education, industry, commerce, road administration, etc., everything has fallen behind. Now that the provincial situation is roughly settled, Chairman Liu is focusing on the innovation of administrative affairs and taking the cultivation of talents as the foundation. Therefore, he has listed educational funds as independent, not subject to military and political constraints, so that education in Henan Province can gradually become universal. He has also allocated a portion of the educational funds specifically for sending students to various countries to develop specialized talents, to be the basis for carrying out various industries in Henan after their return. This time, sending personnel abroad is funded by allocating funds from the educational funds, and they will go to Germany, America, and Sweden to study specialized subjects and cultivate talents for new construction.</p>
<p>Qualifications for Sending Personnel　Henan's sending personnel to Europe and America is an unprecedented event, so it is handled with great care. This matter is jointly handled by the Provincial Government and the Department of Education. Twelve graduates from universities in Henan Province are selected, and they are sent to Germany, America, and Switzerland, each being allowed to choose one subject they wish to study. Whether it is agriculture, engineering, law, or machinery, each person is given a three-year term, with an annual expense of 3,000 yuan per person, round-trip travel expenses of 1,000 yuan each, and clothing expenses of 200 yuan each. In total, six people will go to America, and six people will go to Germany, Switzerland, etc., requiring a total of 132,000 yuan.</p>
<p>First to America　Those who have passed the examinations and been sent to America include Lu Baoqing, Ma Chunde, Zhang Zhicheng, Zhang Jinjian, and Yan Zengcai. They have come to Shanghai from Kaifeng and have already purchased ship tickets. They will go directly to San Francisco across the Pacific Ocean from Shanghai and set sail on the 20th.</p>
<p>Setting Sail for Europe　Those who are going to Germany to study specialized subjects such as industrial machinery and those who are going to Switzerland include Lu Ren'an, Li Rentsan, Chen Yuting, Li Xukai, etc. They have arrived in Shanghai from Henan and are staying at the Mengyuan Hotel. Their passports and other documents have been processed, and ship tickets have been purchased from the French Postal Company for the Baosidao (Paquebot) liner. They are scheduled to board the ship and set sail today. The personnel will first go to Marseille and then transfer to Berlin and other places.</p>
<p>Tea Merchants</p>
<h3>Request to Cancel Tea Leaf Inspection</h3>
<p>Representatives to Go to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau implemented inspections on exported Chinese tea, Chinese and foreign tea merchants in Shanghai have unanimously opposed it. Now, all tea merchants in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang have publicly elected representatives Zheng Ziyu, Zhong Tanran, etc., to go to Beijing to petition, and have jointly submitted a request to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry, requesting the cancellation of the inspection. The original text is copied below: To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry: Upon the Ministry's promulgation of the seventeen articles of the Tea Leaf Inspection Regulations on June 20th, all colleagues were shocked and ran around telling each other. The day the inspection of exported tea leaves is implemented will be the day our tea merchants are doomed. The illness is deep and penetrates the skin, and there is no way to carry it out. We dare to analyze and present it to your esteemed Yuan and Ministry. Tea leaves are an excellent agricultural product of our country, and they have long occupied an important position in foreign trade. However, in recent years, British, Japanese, Indian, and Sinhalese merchants have used their strong capital to compete with us, resulting in a significant decline in the quantity of exports. Tea merchants are alarmed and cautious, and are trying to improve the quality of their products to reverse the precarious situation. The government should urgently give rewards and provide tea merchants with convenience to help them develop. Now that the suffering of tea merchants has not been alleviated, their products are subject to inspection first, which is like drinking poison to quench thirst and throwing stones to save someone who is drowning. It not only violates the government's original intention of maintaining industry but also puts tea merchants in a situation from which they cannot recover. All commodities have high and low qualities, which are divided into expensive and cheap. People have different preferences, and there are different purposes for choosing and abandoning. Cloth has fine and coarse qualities, each suitable for its own use. Business operators, for their own benefit, cater to the psychology of customers and use it as a criterion for their products. The quality of tea, whether it is colored or not, and the amount of adulteration with viscous powder, are all supplied according to the needs of the drinkers. Wealthy households often advocate thrift, while the poor cannot be forced to be extravagant. The most important thing for commodities is to have a market. Cutting the feet to fit the shoes does not harm the health of the drinkers in the slightest. What is there to prohibit? Moreover, in this era of commercial warfare, manufacturers all know that it is not easy to survive if their products are backward. They are all trying their best to make progress. The people's self-reliance is more reliable than what the government is concerned about. This is the first reason why inspection is fundamentally unnecessary. Moreover, the tea-producing areas in our country are mostly in Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and other provinces, which are all collected and processed locally. From picking, roasting, selecting, and making to boxing, it must go through multiple procedures. If our government wants to promote industry and assist in improvement, it can send personnel to various producing areas to guide, supervise, or inspect at any time, so that the tea produced meets the set standards. If non-standard products are found during the manufacturing process, they can be picked out immediately and reprocessed locally. Now, there is no prohibition before manufacturing and packaging. When the goods have been sold and foreign merchants are packing and shipping them, inspection is suddenly ordered. If any of them are considered unqualified, they cannot be returned to the producing area or resold domestically. Moreover, due to the different packaging and manufacturing, they do not meet the market demand. In addition to completely sacrificing their capital, tea merchants also have to bear all the expenses of the foreign firms' orders, all packing and exchange rates, and the compensation for breach of contract. How can tea merchants on the verge of collapse bear this? Moreover, although there are standards for good and bad quality, there is a world of difference between shades. Whether the inspectors' judgments are impartial, if approval or rejection can be manipulated, and good or bad can be weighed at will, then inferior tea may be lucky enough to run well, and superior tea may not be spared from being eliminated. This is mostly to open the door for lower officials to engage in corruption, causing endless suffering to tea merchants. The government's intention is to protect tea farmers, but the result is to kill them. This is another reason why inspection is practically inappropriate. A close reading of Article 2 of the Inspection Regulations states that tea leaves should be reported for inspection to the local commodity inspection bureau or branch before loading and bundling. Since it says "before loading," "local," and "branch," this clearly stipulates that the tea leaves should be inspected by the inspection branch in the producing area when they are still being manufactured and not yet boxed. There is no mention of reporting for inspection in transit. Now, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau is inspecting tea leaves that are shipped from various producing areas to be exported and pass through Shanghai, which is a violation of the regulations. Moreover, as soon as foreign merchants hear about the crackdown, they wait and see, and the price of goods plummets, falling by dozens of taels per dan, and they cannot be sold. The impact is unimaginable. Tea merchants know that the government has the determination to encourage foreign trade, so they dare to beg your esteemed Yuan and Ministry to consider the difficult situation of the tea industry and allow the selection of personnel with rich tea-making knowledge to go to various tea-producing areas to provide on-site guidance and supervision, and cancel the mid-way inspection method to relieve the restrictions. If the government does not sympathize, the tea merchants are afraid that they will not be able to withstand the devastation and will stop operating. The unemployment of tea merchants is not a pity, but what is worrying is that foreign trade will lose tens of millions of taels every year, and the tea farmers and tea workers in various provinces, totaling no less than millions of people, will have their livelihoods cut off. How can this be handled well? This is what we have to ask the government to consider. We are at a loss for words and look forward to your orders. The representatives of all tea merchants in Shanghai from Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, Zheng Ziyu, Wang Yusan, Zhang Zhaoting, Zheng Erzang, Wang Zuocai, He Jiefu, Sun Lisheng, Cheng Baochang, Hu Songpu, Hu Youqing, Yao Chengzhi, Cheng Jinxiu, Tang Minzhi, Wang Jinyi, Zhong Tanran, Shan Huanzhang, Cai Maoqing, Xie Buying, Lin Yaoting, Ye Zhongxiang, Wang Jianbang, Yu Daisha, Hu Liqing, Wang Chunru, Chen Zhongyu, Yu Jinghe, Zhang Shunda, Chi Shunsheng, Xiao Chuzhen, Yu Shaoxian, Cheng Zhilan, Wang Xizhang, Zhuang Jingan, Li Deji, Liu Fanggu, etc., kowtow.

<h3>Prostitute Runs Away with Debt</h3>
<p>Prostitute Bao Di Lao Ba, originally named Huang Jindi, is 17 years old and from Hangzhou. She was working at 504 Fuxiang Lane, Guangxi Road. Recently, due to poor business and accumulated debts, she stole 300 yuan in cash, a jadeite gold ring, and a gold square watch at 1:30 PM on the 23rd of this month and fled without a trace. The owner of the brothel reported it to the Laoza Gate Police Station and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Chief of County Public Security Bureau Accused</h3>
<p>Zhao Lian, the chief of the Second Public Security Bureau of Shanghai County, has been accused by the Second District Party Department of (1) protecting opium and gambling, (2) allowing the patrol chief to forcibly occupy a married woman, and (3) disregarding the county magistrate and allowing the performance of obscene Huaguxi opera, etc., on charges of dereliction of duty and endangering the public.

<h3>Development of the China Rubber Factory</h3>
<p>The "Star" brand galoshes produced by the China Rubber Factory have been sold throughout the country for several years. Last year, it built a factory building on Dong Youheng Road and added new-style machines to produce new "Flying Eagle," "Globe," and "Double Ball Lao Che" brand galoshes, which are comparable to imported products.

<h3>Pan Xulun Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Accountant Pan Xulun was previously entrusted by the Board of Directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation of Peking and the National Tsinghua University Foundation to audit the accounts of the association for the previous year.

<h3>Publication of the Second Volume, Seventh Issue of "Humanities Monthly"</h3>
<p>The "Humanities" Monthly, which has a high reputation in academic circles, has published and sold its second volume, seventh issue. The text and length of this issue are longer than before and are very exciting. Among them, for example, Wen Yu Jun's "Research on Japanese Products Imported into China" details the types of goods shipped to China by Japan from the 7th year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty to the 18th year of the Republic of China, a period of 62 years. It comprehensively records the various goods and their increases and decreases over time, and also examines the reasons for their changes. At this critical time for the survival of the country, those who seek to resist Japanese goods and manufacture domestic goods should urgently read this article. Wang Zaoshi's "The Whole Story of German Military Armament Reduction" is continued in this issue. It records the issues of the great powers' treatment of the German Navy and Air Force, the supervision of German disarmament, and the occupation of the Rhineland and demilitarization, etc. Zhang Jingrui's "Northeast Investment and the Shanghai Domestic Banking Industry" focuses on the relationship between the Northeast in terms of national defense, politics, and economics and the Shanghai domestic banking industry, and the ambitions of Japan and Russia to invade, analyzing and discussing them in detail. It is an article that those who are concerned about the current situation should read urgently. Xi Yin's "A True Record of the Southeast Mutual Protection During the Boxer Rebellion in the Year of Gengzi" and "Mr. Qian Luxiang's Notes" are both valuable records. In addition, Pan Guangdan's Reading Notes, which introduces "The Truth of Soviet Russia," is quite capable of clearly introducing the original author's intention. The attached index of magazine highlights contains 2,112 items, which is even more than before. In addition to the Humanities Editorial Office at No. 1 Nanqianbaotang, Lafayette Road, Shanghai, the issuing locations include Civilization, New Moon, Qixin, Nanxin, Suxin, Fuxin, Shenzhou, and Life Weekly, and the Commercial Press in various ports also sells them.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Greetings. I have just read in your newspaper published on the 8th of this month that Liu Yuhe, the director of the Fanchuan Chamber of Commerce, delayed the distribution of relief, and that Shen Yiqing, a representative of the disaster victims, filed complaints with the provincial party and government agencies and charitable organizations. Reading this, I was deeply shocked and surprised. Upon investigation, Liu Yuhe, the chairman of our town's Chamber of Commerce, has served the local area for decades, is enthusiastic about public welfare, and does not complain about hard work. All charitable acts such as winter relief and porridge distribution over the years have been initiated by him. The public sentiment is grateful, and there is unanimous praise. This time, the flood in Fandi was extremely severe, and we urgently raised funds for relief. We jointly formed an organization with various agencies, legal groups, gentry, and people from all walks of life. Our association was also elected as one of the standing committee members. Earlier, Dai Junxing B, etc., from Jiangdu distributed emergency relief. Wu Bingsheng sent bread late at night on the 1st of this month. Because it was humid in transit, there were some mold spots. Therefore, our association unloaded it on the morning of the 2nd, spread it out to dry, and added baked cakes. On the morning of the 3rd, we sent personnel to distribute it door-to-door without delay. It was not distributed by the Fanchuan Chamber of Commerce, and the Yangzhou Chamber of Commerce has never sent any relief supplies. Such slander and sabotage confuse the public and mislead the hearing. Not only does Chairman Liu's personal reputation affect the future of disaster relief, but it also has a great impact on it. What are the sins of the disaster victims to suffer such misfortune? In addition to sending representatives to explain to the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, and various charitable organizations, we are especially concerned that the outside world does not understand the truth. We hereby send another letter to your esteemed office, hoping that you will quickly correct it and publish this letter in the letters column. We would be grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Fancha Town Flood Relief Committee</p>

<p>Special Issue on the National Road and City Conference</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the Road and City Conference</h3>
<p>The Road Association was established in 1921. This year marks its tenth anniversary. During these ten years, national roads have made considerable progress. At the beginning of the association's establishment, the total length of completed roads in the country was only 1,500 miles. As of today, the length of completed roads has increased dramatically to 35,000 miles. Given the vastness of our country, this 35,000 miles of roads cannot be considered sufficient. However, in the past ten years, disasters and chaos have followed one after another, and financial resources have been strained. All construction projects have been stalled. However, the efforts of the entire country to build roads have never slackened, resulting in this achievement. In addition to our satisfaction, we must attribute the recognition of achievements to the Road Association.</p>
<p>Today, the Road and City Conference is being held in Shanghai, and the world-shaking incident of the violent Japanese troops advancing has occurred at this time. In addition to our grief and anger, we have agreed to go to the national crisis together. It seems that we have no time to pay attention to the Road and City Conference. However, let's think deeply about it. If the people of the country had paid a little attention to the border issues ten, twenty, or even thirty years ago, built roads, and developed resources, then today's Liaoning and Jilin would not be allowed to be trampled on like this. At this conference, the association has fully stated in its declaration the importance of the mission of how to promote national road administration, how to innovate urban undertakings, how to manufacture vehicles and equipment, how to cultivate road and city professionals, and how to extract gasoline materials. It will discuss them one by one to make them meet the needs of the times and remedy the losses of the past. Given the past success of the Dao Ge Association, our expectations for this conference are even more needless to say. The extension of roads is the progress of culture. Transportation is the lifeblood of the country. The participating gentlemen have long understood this meaning. There must be good plans to show us.</p>
<p>Regarding the Entire Country</p>
<h3>Hopes for the Road and City Conference by Li Zhiqing</h3>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association is holding a three-week National Road and City Exhibition and has designated the second week to hold a one-week National Road and City Conference. The purpose is to take this opportunity to gather representatives from various provinces in one hall to openly discuss and seek comprehensive solutions to all road and city problems in the country.</p>
<p>In the past week, representatives from various provinces have passed more than 30 important proposals. If combined with other minor proposals, the number is even greater than this. From this, it can be seen that the authorities in various provinces attach importance to road and city construction, which is no longer the same as when the China National Road Construction Association was founded ten years ago. Therefore, the improvement of road and city construction in our country in the future will also be incomparable to that of the past ten years.</p>
<p>I have no research on road and city construction, so I dare not make any comments. However, in the past two weeks, I have been in and out of the conference hall, and I have some feelings. I will now discuss three points of my personal hope with the representatives of various provinces.</p>
<p>First, connecting roads. According to the investigation of Road Monthly, there are currently more than 100,000 li of roads in the country. However, according to people who have traveled to various parts of the country, there are often unconnected roads between the two provinces, and even between the two counties. Travelers still have to change to riding mules and horses, sedan chairs, small carts, or take boats to detour. Then, the people who benefit from these completed roads are not limited to one county, but limited to one province. Not limited to one province, at most, it does not go beyond the scope of the neighboring provinces. Based on this, it can be said that a certain county in China already has thousands of li of roads. It can also be said that a certain province in China already has thousands of li of roads. If it is said that China already has more than 100,000 li of roads, it must first connect the completed roads. Otherwise, the traffic is limited to one side. As far as the country is concerned, it has not become a thoroughfare. How can it be said that China already has more than 100,000 li of roads? I hope that the representatives of various provinces will pay attention to this point when promoting road construction in the future.</p>
<p>Second, manufacturing cars. There are currently more than 27,000 cars in our country, all of which are purchased from abroad. At this Road and City Exhibition, there is a domestically produced freight car that makes the people of the country feel relieved. This is gratifying. The car is produced by the Minsheng Factory, which is attached to the Liaoning Mortar Factory. Except for the engine, tires, and electrical equipment, which are temporarily imported, the rest of the parts are manufactured by the factory. It has a load capacity of 4,000 pounds and a maximum speed of 40 miles per hour. It is said that starting this month, it can manufacture 10 two-ton freight cars and 5 three-ton freight cars per month, totaling 15 cars. Unfortunately, on the night of the fall of Shenyang on the 18th of this month, they were all destroyed by the artillery fire of the violent Japanese, making the only automobile factory in China disappear like a flash in the pan. Sad. I hope that the representatives attending the conference from various provinces will continue the unfinished business of the Minsheng Factory after returning to their provinces, establish automobile factories locally, and develop them as much as possible. The success of the automobile industry in our country depends on it.</p>
<p>Third, refining automobile oil. At present, the country consumes more than 200 million gallons of gasoline every year. Even at one yuan per gallon, it is worth more than 200 million yuan. Not to mention this huge leak, if the source is cut off, it will immediately kill more than 27,000 cars in our country. How dangerous it is. Although the various diesel oils displayed by the Shaanxi Provincial Government are far from the degree of refining gasoline, as long as we make a determination to continue research and continue to experiment, there will be a day of success. Moreover, China is so large that the oil-producing provinces should not be limited to Shaanxi. I hope that the representatives will return to their provinces in the future, conduct on-site investigations, and vigorously promote them. Then, after a few years, our China will not only have a large number of domestically produced cars, but also have domestically refined gasoline to supply the domestically produced cars.</p>

<h3>Summary of Resolutions</h3>
<p>(1) Proposal to establish a factory and testing facility for road and other construction materials. (Proposed by the Tianjin Municipal Government) The proposal is as follows: Upon investigation, the roads and other construction materials in our country mostly come from abroad, resulting in a loss of tens of millions annually. Our country has vast land and abundant resources, and there is nothing we lack. With such a large population, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. It is simply because we choose the easy path and avoid difficulties, lacking talent for innovation, which leads to various problems and the outflow of profits. If this continues, there is no end in sight. To remedy past shortcomings, considering only roads and other construction materials, it is highly advisable to establish material manufacturing factories and testing facilities in areas with convenient transportation and abundant resources. From prices to large amounts, the collection of property donations should be considered. In 1921, the land tax in Tokyo, Japan, accounted for only one-twentieth of the total revenue. Since the reconstruction, it has gradually adopted property tax as the basic tax. Guangzhou, China, has pioneered municipal administration. In 1921, the city's financial revenue was mainly from property donations, accounting for more than one-third. However, this phenomenon is not common in other cities in the country. While cities collect house donations, they pay little attention to land tax. At a time when construction funds are strained, it is proposed to rectify house donations and establish land tax, designating this revenue as the basic municipal tax for each city, and permanently using it for municipal material construction, without diverting it to other uses. Is this feasible? We respectfully seek public decision.</p>
<p>(3) Proposal to encourage the decentralization of industry and garden city movement. (Proposed by the Tianjin Municipal Government) The proposal is as follows: Urbanization is a common trend in modern countries. As a result of excessive population increase in cities, the concept of garden cities and industrial decentralization has emerged in recent times to make appropriate adjustments. The city's population is increasing daily, and problems such as transportation and housing are becoming increasingly complex. Land prices are also bound to rise. The industrial decentralization movement involves relocating factories to the outskirts of the city, allowing the city to avoid the noise and smoke of factories. At the same time, the population density in the city can also be reduced, and problems such as transportation and housing can be more easily resolved. Moving factories to the outskirts also benefits the industry itself. Land outside the city is bound to be cheaper than land inside the city, reducing factory costs. Even if a factory is located in the city, its warehouses and storage areas are often located in areas with lower land prices. Every year, the transportation costs for</p>
<h3>Opening Declaration of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>Premier Sun stated, "Since the founding of the Republic of China, there has been extreme destruction, but no extreme construction to follow it. This is why disasters follow one another, and things get worse every day. Warlords are dictatorial, politicians are disruptive, and there is no way to clean things up. During this extraordinary time, there must be extraordinary construction to refresh the people's minds and usher in a new era for the country." During this period of political tutelage, when foreign invaders are encroaching daily and natural disasters are widespread, the people of the whole country have long been displaced and yearn for the early realization of universal construction to make up for the shortcomings of extreme destruction and alleviate the suffering of all people. We adhere to the Premier's teachings and engage in road and municipal construction. At this critical juncture, how should we boost our spirits, pool our wisdom and efforts, and fully contribute to economic construction so that we can achieve excellent results and lay the foundation for the constitutional period? Moreover, the central government, based on the Premier's teachings, has set the period of political tutelage at six years. The groundwork for local autonomy, including household registration, establishment of institutions, assessment of land prices, road repairs, land reclamation, and school establishment, must be completed before 1935. In this short period, we can only succeed by working together. Our duty is to not shirk our responsibilities. The primary task of construction lies in people's livelihood. The Premier's legacy, the National Reconstruction Program and the Outline of National Reconstruction, provide detailed regulations for the procedures and programs. The national road network and municipal regulations have also been formulated and promulgated by the competent authorities. In recent years, provinces and cities have been striving to implement them, with increasing success. From now on, as long as the whole country is united and cooperates, it will not be difficult to complete millions of miles of roads, promote urban prosperity, and alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>However, road and municipal administration involve countless details, and design and planning are constantly evolving. Therefore, the Tenth Anniversary of the China National Road Construction Association has convened a national road and municipal conference to discuss how to promote national road administration, how to innovate urban affairs, how to manufacture vehicles and equipment, how to cultivate road and municipal professionals, and how to obtain gasoline and materials to meet the needs of the times and remedy past losses. These are all important issues that urgently need to be resolved. This conference is entrusted with the responsibilities of various provinces and cities and the expectations of the people. We must carefully review and thoroughly study these issues to contribute to the implementation and adoption of the national construction industry and to become a more practical and excellent path for construction. Therefore, the mission and purpose of this national road and municipal conference are most meaningful. To sit and talk is easy, but to stand up and act is our common goal. To not fear difficulties and not be complacent is our iron rule of service. Based on this meaning, we will strive to implement it, and while there is still a breath, this ambition will not waver. We must never repeat the mistakes of Egypt, Annam, Korea, and India, where they did not build their own roads and allowed others to build them for them, eventually leading to their demise. We firmly believe that after the conference, land transportation will gradually become universal, municipal undertakings will be painstakingly managed, and things will improve steadily. The Three Principles of the People will become a practical social organization and national structure, and then the people will have the happiness of prosperity and benefit. The uncultivated resources will have the opportunity to be developed, and the Far East and Tibet will have the possibility of being thoroughly saved. Now that the conference has begun, we hereby declare. We hope that our fellow builders will offer their guidance. The First General Assembly of the China National Road and Municipal Conference.</p>
<p>Planning matters. To regain the rights and enrich the country. The cement of Qixin Company in Tangshan has been quite effective. Our country is not without asphalt and oil, but due to poor quality, provinces have adopted it. Based on the above two examples, the establishment of factories for construction and testing should not be delayed. We respectfully seek your decision on the appropriateness of the proposal.</p>
<p>(2) Rectify house donations, establish land tax, and designate this revenue as a special fund for municipal material construction. (Proposed by the Tianjin Municipal Government and the Henan Construction Department) Urban administration places primary importance on material construction, and the successful completion of material construction depends on the sufficiency of construction funds. Examining the financial situation of various cities in the country, most funds are used for administrative expenses, while the allocation for construction expenses is only about 20%. This is the opposite of the principle of financial allocation in European and American cities, where business expenses exceed administrative expenses. Under this financial phenomenon, seeking the steady progress of urban material construction is like asking a clever woman to cook without rice. Therefore, it is well known that the sluggishness of general municipal construction in our country is entirely due to the lack of fixed construction funds, and the lack of fixed construction funds is due to the simple and crude municipal finance, without uniform tax rules and good sources of revenue to break through the routine of living within one's means. The only way to solve this problem is to first establish a basic municipal tax, opening up a good source of revenue for municipal finance, so that construction funds have a solid foundation and are no longer affected by administrative expenses, leaving a surplus. According to the municipal taxes of modern European and American cities, property donations account for the largest proportion. The reason for this is that modern municipal construction has an impact on the value of land in the city over the years and the transportation costs incurred. Combined, they are also quite considerable. If factories can be set up outside the city, then factories and storage areas can be located in one place, and transportation costs can be greatly reduced. Foreign cities have recently been vigorously promoting industrial decentralization for this reason. The industrial revolution in various parts of the country has just begun to emerge, and it is possible to use the experience of foreigners to encourage factories to be set up in the suburbs of the city before factories in the city are crowded. Then, the majority of municipal problems caused by factories can be easily solved. However, the following points must also be noted at the same time.</p>
<p>(1) The so-called industrial decentralization does not mean that all industries are not allowed to be set up in the city. Because there are several industries that, due to their special nature, must be set up in the city. Generally speaking, small industries, light industries, and industries with local characteristics must be set up in the city, while large industries and heavy industries can be set up outside the city.</p>
<p>(2) The industrial decentralization movement should be carried out in conjunction with the residential decentralization movement. Otherwise, problems such as transportation and housing in the city will still be difficult to solve. If factories are set up outside the city, and workers working in factories outside the city do not have suitable housing near the factories, they will inevitably still live in the city. Therefore, when building factories outside the city, the housing problem for workers must be planned in advance to avoid difficulties.</p>
<p>(3) When promoting the industrial and residential decentralization movement, we should also consider the city's road system and transportation tools. If this is the case, the city and the outside can be integrated without being isolated. The establishment of industrial and residential areas outside the city is actually a dependency of the city and cannot exist independently from the city.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>As for the garden city movement, its significance is even greater than the decentralization of industry and housing. The garden city movement can not only solve the congestion within the city, allowing citizens to enjoy rural life, but also adopt the spirit of cooperatives to publicly own land, so that the unearned income from land is distributed to the city instead of being monopolized by a few capitalists. In recent years, there have also been calls for the organization of new cities in the suburbs or rural areas of large cities across the country. Unfortunately, either because of the prevalence of banana leaves, it is difficult to proceed, or because of poor design, it is stopped halfway. It is proposed that the government should encourage and promote the industrial decentralization and garden city movement so that it can be realized as soon as possible. Is this appropriate? We respectfully seek your decision. (4) Proposal to solve the urban unemployment problem. (Proposed by the Hangzhou Municipal Government) The urban unemployment problem is quite serious these days. According to the investigation of the Social Bureau, the number of urban unemployed people in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and other places is increasing year by year. The responsibility of the urban authorities for relief work is extremely important. We respectfully put forward the following relief measures to the extent of our knowledge. (A) Active aspects. The urban relief business is not a simple problem. How should purely industrialized cities develop industry and commerce to prevent unemployment among citizens? How should cities with many agricultural products improve agriculture to achieve an increase in harvest and prevent disasters? How should cities with both industry and agriculture develop agriculture, industry, and commerce at the same time to avoid the great impact of a single aspect due to decline? Examining our country, which is based on agriculture, and cities, which are the center of artificial industry and commerce, the relief business is not just a single deliberation of gains and losses. It should be completely adapted to local conditions in an active aspect. All relief measures include a total of five items. (1) Supporting the development of urban industry and commerce. In industrial and commercial cities, the occupations of citizens are mostly workers, shop apprentices, and small capital merchants. Although there are many reasons for their unemployment, most of them are attacked by foreign capitalists, as evidenced by Shanghai. Relief methods: (1) Strictly implement national laws and regulations to protect the development of industry and commerce. (2) Actively promote the purchase of domestic products by the people. (2) Striving for the afforestation movement. The afforestation movement is one of the Premier's last instructions and the seven movements promulgated by the central government. It can not only benefit health, decorate the scenery, but also increase the power of agricultural products to prevent natural disasters. It is especially great. Recently, the entire country has suffered from floods, which shows that this movement cannot be delayed for a day. (3) Promote the thrift movement. The thrift movement has been actively promoted by various countries recently. After the European War and the Japanese earthquake, people were thrifty and frugal in order to recuperate and educate. Urban people in our country live luxuriously. Unemployed people in society who are even suicidal were often extremely luxurious people in the past. It is better to promote the thrift movement more often than to provide them with a meal and a porridge in the future. It can reduce unemployment and also achieve the effect of saving money. Moreover, the recent floods are so significant, and it is especially necessary for the people to save money and cherish resources. This measure should be expanded and promoted to attract the attention of all citizens. (4) Establish poverty-stricken factories, poverty-stricken lending offices, and vocational introduction agencies. The three agencies on the right are completely production agencies for unemployment relief and are not comparable to charitable reception agencies. Their poverty-stricken factories should be established on a larger scale so that they can accommodate a large number of unemployed poor people. In increasing the quantity of production, poverty-stricken lending offices should be established according to the divided areas so that one person does not borrow from many places and suffer the hardship of traveling and running around. (5) Strictly crack down on usury lending. Usury lending exploits the poor. Those who are not unemployed occasionally drink poison to quench their thirst because of debt. Over time, they can gradually become impoverished. The unemployed are even more so. Although our country's laws have cracked down on it, those who prohibit it prohibit it, and those who operate it operate it as before. The municipal authorities should strictly crack down on this. (B) Passive aspects. There are three relief measures that can be mentioned in the passive aspect. (1) Advocate relief. There are many unemployed people in the city, or when disasters have already formed, relief is unavoidable. However, under special circumstances, the city's revenue. After all, is there a fixed fund to prepare for temporary relief? It is indeed a problem. For example, the entire city of Hankou recently became a swamp, and the number of people affected by the disaster is uncountable. Also, the city of Beijing was flooded, and many citizens were submerged. Hankou and Beijing are political centers and prosperous industrial and commercial areas, respectively, but the disaster situation is so significant, and the number of unemployed citizens will increase even more. However, the relief in both cities is still in the midst of fundraising and preparation, and the hope of fundraising and preparation is still mostly on private individuals and the national treasury. It can be seen that passive business is slow to help and is far less effective than active prevention in advance. However, the municipal authorities must always be in a leading position. The effect of the neighborhood will be great. (2) Set up shelters. This agency is divided into temporary and permanent types. Those belonging to water long-term are like disabled hospitals, women and children's relief homes, orphanages, etc. Those belonging to temporary are like refugee shelters. This kind of relief work is completely of a receiving nature, slightly like what charitable organizations do. It is especially effective during the temporary period. (3) Cooperate with charitable organizations. Charitable organizations in our country, such as charity halls and red swastika societies, have always been unconnected with the government. The progress of their annual business is quite impressive. However, the methods are different, and the superstitious concepts are too heavy. This is where the drawbacks lie. In order to develop relief work, the municipal authorities should make every effort to rectify and cooperate with them. The methods are (1) stipulating various reports and ordering them to register and file with the municipal government for detailed examination. (2) Convene the persons in charge of charitable organizations to talk, instruct the direction of charitable work, and formulate various rules and regulations to be followed. (3) Crack down on superstitious actions. (4) Formulate reward measures. In this way, private charitable organizations can be connected with public relief work. The benefits of the unemployed are indeed not small. The above-mentioned active and passive measures are drafted based on past situations and current status. Is this appropriate? We respectfully seek your decision. (5) Request the National Government to draft standard drawings and practices for various road and municipal buildings (Proposed by the Tianjin Municipal Government)</p>
<p>The proposal is as follows: The development of cities in our country is the slowest. Various buildings are even more naive, resulting in chaotic results. There is no basis for it. If this continues, when will we be able to catch up with other countries? Therefore, we request the National Government to draft explanations for the practices of indoor roads, ditches, bridges, river dams, docks, and various houses, as well as architectural codes, etc., and explain their principles. In this way, engineering experts in major cities will have reference, and remote areas in rural towns will have a basis. Is this appropriate? We respectfully seek your decision.</p>
<p>(6) Request the National Government to order road and municipal agencies at all levels to hire experts and organize a procurement committee to be responsible for the procurement of all necessary items and printed documents for administrative and business aspects to save expenses. (Proposed by Dong Xiujia)</p>
<p>(7) Proposal to establish road and municipal specialized schools to cultivate road and municipal professionals (Jointly proposed by the Hubei Construction Department, Hankou Municipal Government, Fujian Construction Department, Jinan Municipal Government, and expert Cheng Dexu)</p>
<p>(Reason) The lack of road and municipal professional talents in our country is an important key that hinders the development of roads and cities. In the past, road and municipal engineering education in the country was very small. Moreover, due to incomplete equipment and infrequent practice, there were many people who were just making up the numbers, and the results were extremely poor. Students did not have any expertise, and the government sighed that it was difficult to find talents. A large number of people who are in charge of road and municipal administration are people who are not familiar with road and municipal knowledge. They cannot assess the situation and plan comprehensively for the design, construction, and material selection of cities and roads, so that they conform to scientific methods and economic principles. As a result, the impact on the progress of roads and cities is very significant. Therefore, it is necessary to actively establish road and municipal specialized schools to cultivate road and municipal professionals so that all aspects of management, construction, and manufacturing related to roads and cities can obtain appropriate specialized technical personnel. The result of road and municipal construction will not lead to waste and extravagance. The following methods are proposed. (Methods) 1. The central government allocates funds to establish a central road and municipal specialized university. After the establishment, the recurring expenses are drawn from the revenue of national roads or provincial roads by a certain percentage, amounting to 1.2 million yuan per year. 2. The road and municipal specialized university should be divided into three departments: management, construction, and manufacturing. The management department should focus on the management of road and municipal administration. The construction department should focus on the implementation of road and municipal construction projects. The manufacturing department should focus on the manufacture of road construction machinery and transportation vehicles. 3. Five years after the establishment of the road and municipal specialized university, road and municipal agencies in the country should give priority to hiring students from the school.</p>
<p>(8) Proposal to promote municipal public utilities (Proposed by the Tianjin Municipal Government) The proposal is as follows: Public utilities, such as trams, electric lights, and tap water, are closely related to citizens. Their importance goes without saying. The situation in various cities in the country is different. Some are managed by the public, and some are established by merchants who pool shares. Some even borrow materials from other places and foreign capital. Although they each have their own special circumstances, those that are run by merchants mostly have simple and crude equipment and are not very sound. Because they are business-oriented, they only know how to make profits and pay little attention to the interests of citizens. On the other hand, if they are run by the government, they should take the welfare of citizens as the premise. Therefore, this public utility should still be based on the principle of being taken over by the municipality. It is not only in line with social policies, but also the best source of revenue for increasing urban income. The income of British cities is mostly accounted for by the surplus profits of this public utility. Cities in our country can follow suit. According to this goal, seize the appropriate opportunity and strive to fully achieve the goal of recovering municipal management. Not only will the surplus of this business benefit the municipal treasury, but citizens can also enjoy the benefits. Is this feasible? We respectfully seek your decision.</p>
<p>(10) Proposal to improve earth roads and slag stone road surfaces. (Proposed by the Tianjin Municipal Government) The proposal is as follows: The roads in various cities in our country are mostly earth roads, slag stone roads, or oil roads. Earth roads should be urgently improved. Most of the materials used for oil roads are imported, and in recent years, the price has been increasing due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver. The financial resources of various cities may not be able to afford it, and it is difficult to popularize it. Slag stone roads and stone roads are still simple and economical. However, whenever the weather is dry and the wind rises, dust flies, which hinders traffic and harms health. It is quite inconvenient. It is found that green calcium (i.e., bittern) can be sprinkled on the road surface to make the road surface moist, firm, and less dusty, which is of great benefit to the cleanliness of the city. Many countries in Europe and the United States have adopted it, and the results are very good. Tianjin City has achieved success in trial operation according to law. Moreover, this material is available in all salt areas, and the price is very cheap. It seems that it can be notified to various places.</p>

<p>Follow suit. Simple and economical, it will benefit road administration greatly. Is this appropriate? We respectfully seek your decision.</p>
<p>(11) The Road Association should organize a Road Engineering Terminology Review Committee to review and finalize road engineering terminology as soon as possible. (Proposed by Yang Zheming) (Reason) Upon investigation, the translated names of road engineering terms in domestic publications recently are the most inconsistent. Therefore, it should be reviewed and finalized as soon as possible to unify the various terms.</p>
<p>(12) Stipulate that a national road and municipal conference should be held once a year to exchange professional knowledge and experience. (Proposed by the Jiangsu Construction Department) Since the restoration of road engineering, road transportation has become increasingly important. Engineering rules are also changing with each passing day. All the professional academic and practical experience in road repair during the development process urgently needs to be collected and observed to promote it. Most countries in Europe and the United States are also making progress. Our country's road construction business is just beginning to sprout. There is no doubt that it needs to absorb new knowledge and integrate local experience. Therefore, organizing a national road and municipal conference annually is a very important plan. It is proposed to hold a road and municipal conference annually in provincial guilds and important cities, solicit professional academic treatises from all aspects, and exhibit road construction materials and achievements from various provinces at the conference site for joint research, and visit the actual work of highways on the spot. It not only provides the participating representatives with the opportunity to exchange knowledge, but also increases the efficiency of work in various provinces by comparing them in the field. Is this appropriate? We respectfully await your decision.</p>

<h3>A True Account of the Road and City Exhibition by Yang Deren</h3>
<p>Announced by government decrees, published in newspapers, heard in the ears, and proclaimed to the world, the unprecedented grand Road and City Exhibition, a rare event both ancient and modern, domestic and foreign, officially opened on September 12th on Avenue Petain in Shanghai. Since its opening, numerous visitors have written accounts of the event, some in diaries, others in special publications, some as critiques, and others as news reports, varying in length and style. Yet, all are extremely appreciative and aim to disclose as much as possible for praise and publicity. I, being unworthy, had the honor to be one of the representatives from Henan Province, enabling me to participate in the convention and attend the Road and City conferences. My good fortune knows no bounds. Thus, I follow in the footsteps of those gentlemen and obey the elegant instruction of our head, Mr. Wu Shan of the Association, to draft this factual article after my visit, for the sake of correction from experts and to mark this unforgettable occasion.</p>
<p>Details regarding the purpose of this grand exhibition, the preparation process, and the reasons for holding it in Shanghai have been published in the "Roads Monthly" and other newspapers. Readers should already have a considerable impression in their minds, so there is no need to repeat them. Therefore, this article focuses solely on the content of each exhibition room, the significance of their displays, and my impressions after the visit. I hope the readers will pay attention to these points.</p>
<p>(1) The Hall of Origins: This hall is located in the center-right of the venue. Visitors should start their tour from this room first. Then, proceed in order to the Hall of Souvenirs, the Hall of Charts and Diagrams, the Hall of Photographs, the Hall of Road and City Conditions of Various Provinces, the Hall of Model Charts of Various Cities, the Hall of Models of Various Road Building Materials, the Exhibition Rooms of Various Automobile Companies, the Exhibition Rooms of Various Manufacturers, the International Road and City Library, the Office, and the Recreation and Dance Halls. This systematic approach will be more rewarding. Therefore, this article will begin with a description of this hall and then proceed in order, according to the nature of each room's exhibits, to provide readers with a clear overview. The reason for naming this exhibition room the Hall of Origins, as instructed by Mr. Wu, is because morality is declining, and people are increasingly forgetting their roots and turning against them. The concept of "trees having roots and water having sources" is adopted. The central display is a large, rectangular plaque of black characters on yellow background, framed in glass, bearing the names of the sixty-five founders of the China National Road Construction Association. To the left, right, and bottom of the plaque are hung portraits of the President, Vice-Presidents, and Honorary Presidents, totaling twelve. Among them, the twenty-four-inch half-body portrait of President Wang Zhengting is the most eye-catching. Both Chinese and foreign visitors who have never met President Wang cannot help but examine it closely. Below hangs a large sheet with the names of the past team leaders of the requisition campaigns, totaling over one hundred and eighty. On both sides of the room are four large glass frames displaying members' portraits, each containing sixty four-inch half-body photographs. Inside the room is a glass cabinet. The lower level of the cabinet contains over ten large volumes of registers for Permanent, Honorary, Supporting, Special, and Ordinary Members. The upper level contains three magnetic images, namely the portraits of Mr. Zhuo Tianwen, the Honorary President who donated 10,000 yuan to the Association's building fund; Mr. Chen Heji, the Team Leader of the Nanyang Heji Special Requisition Campaign; and Mr. Lin Shizong, the Plenipotentiary Representative of Nanyang. This is to show that the Association has been able to sustain itself to this day, despite its economic difficulties, thanks to the efforts of these three gentlemen. Above the cabinet is a thick album of handwritten inscriptions from various celebrities in commemoration of the tenth anniversary, consisting of seventy to eighty pieces of calligraphy from famous figures. In the center of the room is a decorated archway with the five characters "Hall of Origins" written on it. Behind the archway, on the left and right sides, hang a central scroll by Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, inscribed with the four characters "Leveling Road Barriers," and a silk banner from Zhang Feiran, Director of the Construction Department of Henan Province, inscribed with the twelve characters "Compare Past Achievements, Vigorously Plan for Future Publication." Also, there are central scrolls from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Medical Association, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai, and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Federation. Lin Chengxiu, Director of the Construction Department of Hebei Province, Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department of Shandong Province, and Mr. Wang Jingqi presented a pair of antithetical couplets each. In front of the archway, on both sides, are hung over forty various road construction blueprints, and below are two large oil paintings: Mr. Wu Shan's "Leveling the Perilous Mimei Pass to Create a Thoroughfare" and "Photographs of Dangerous Sections of the Guangxi Private Long-Distance Automobile Road." In the center hang two maps of China's national automobile road network planned by Mr. Wu. Also, there is a photograph of the opening of this exhibition, and three statements of past budget reviews, showing the transparency of the finances. On the exterior of the room are over twenty photographs of the vicinity of Yanmen Pass in Shanxi, framed in large glass to serve as decoration.</p>

<p>(2) The Hall of Souvenirs: This hall is to the right of the Hall of Origins. In the center of the room's upper end hangs a portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Below the portrait hangs a plaque presented by the Executive Yuan, inscribed with the four characters "Construction and Surveying." In addition, there are over twenty silver shields and ten plaques presented by various ministries, provincial governments, the Shanghai Municipal Construction Committee, the Architectural Association, the Directors of the Construction Departments of Hunan and Jiangsu provinces, and the Shanghai Local Court. In the center hang two large banners: the declaration of the tenth-anniversary celebration and Mr. Wu's supplementary record of his ten years of service to the Association. Reading them evokes a sense of sympathy and admiration. On both sides, at the upper end, hang antithetical couplets, banners, central scrolls, silk banners, and plaques presented by Minister of Military Affairs He, Minister of Agriculture and Mining Yi, Minister of Finance Song, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Shanghai Accountants Association, the Hebei Provincial Roads Bureau, the Shaanxi Construction Department, the Henan Provincial Government, the Shandong Party Affairs Rectification Committee, the Shandong Education Department, the Beiping Municipal Government, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, the Gansu Provincial Government, the China National Products Preservation Association, the Ningxia Provincial Government, the Liaoning Provincial Party Headquarters, the Director of the Construction Department of Chahar, the Hubei Provincial Government, the Hangzhou Municipal Government, the Jilin Provincial Construction Department, the Henan Provincial Highway Bureau, National Jinan University, and other individuals, totaling no less than fifty or sixty pieces. At the lower end are six large oil paintings: (1) The situation of spreading crushed stone of a thick inch on the west section of Bishan Road in Xiamen. (2) The status of the subgrade that has been rolled on the same road. (3) Photographs of the Hanpo Ridges on the Anshui Road in Sichuan. (4) The situation of rolling the subgrade of the Fulu Road in Southern Sichuan. (5) A section of the Ring Road of Guiyang. (6) Photographs of the reinforced concrete bridge at the first section of the Shaoguan Automobile Road in Fujian. In addition, there are fifty to sixty photographs of long-distance automobile roads in Sichuan, Shanxi, Fujian, and other provinces, framed in glass and displayed outside the room. After visiting these two rooms, one can understand the Association's founding process and the enthusiasm of people nationwide in supporting the Association, inspiring infinite hope for the future of the new China. (3) The Hall of Charts and Diagrams: Outside this room, in the center of the colored signboard, hangs a horizontal plaque inscribed with the four characters "Great Harmony and Shallow Rolling" by Ma Fuxiang, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government. Inside the room, on the main wall, hangs a large comparative chart of highways in various provinces of China. It uses red and green colors to separately indicate the mileage of highways that have been completed and those that have not, allowing visitors to know at a glance that there are currently more than 111,000 miles of highways in the country, with Guangdong Province being the longest and Jiangxi Province being the shortest, while Tibet has not yet been connected by automobiles. On both sides of the chart are twenty-six provincial maps, detailing the completed, uncompleted, and planned highways in each province. Also, on the left and right walls, hang the National Highway Statistics Chart, the Comparative Chart of Highway Mileage per Capita in Various Provinces, the Comparative Chart of Highway Mileage per Area in Various Provinces, the Comparative Chart of World Highway Types, the Percentage Comparative Chart of Highways in the Five Continents, the Comparative Table of Achievements in the Tenth Anniversary Road Building Movement, the Directory of Road Association Branches in Various Provinces, the Summary Table of Incoming and Outgoing Documents in the Tenth Anniversary, the Tenth Session Income and Expenditure and Loan Table, the Planned Road Association Building Site, the Comparative Table of Municipal Government Revenue in Various Cities of China, the Directory of Cities with Populations over 100,000 in China, and the Map of the North-South Unified Route, each consisting of one piece. These charts and diagrams are all drawn by the Road Association, authenticated by Chief Secretary Wu Shan, and colored, framed with glass, and quite spectacular. In addition, there are tables such as the organizational regulations and price list of the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance automobile. The statistical charts of the two administrations of roads and cities which are contributed by the Tianjin Jiangxi Highway Office, and the Henan Construction Department were approximately thirty more pieces. As a result, the left and right walls are full of colorful, exquisite, and informative statistical charts. Visitors cannot help but browse and register upon arrival. In the center of the room is a long table. On the table are more than ten volumes of survey plans and blueprints of the six major trunk lines of the Western Highway Office, fifteen volumes of various road and city plans and highway inspection reports from the Henan Provincial Construction Department, and three rolls of various blueprints. The government of Qingdao had approximately eight volumes of blueprints. The Fujian Provincial Construction Department had more than thirty copies of measurements and statistical charts. It has been found that the information found in these charts and reports is rich and the content is accurate. All road and city experts, engineering students, or school groups who come to visit take the time to extract and copy the information for research purposes.</p>
<p>(4) The Hall of Photographs: The horizontal plaque outside this room reads "China National Road and City Photograph Exhibition Hall." It is dedicated to displaying photographs of roads and cities in various provinces. At the top of the front wall inside the room hang forty colored oil paintings of arranged photographs, namely "Photographs of Chief Secretary Wu Shan of the Association Inspecting Newly Planted Roadside Trees on the Shaotong Road in Shaanxi While Riding a Donkey in the Snow," "The Situation of Human Transportation Before the Excavation of Hangu Pass," "The Situation of Vehicle Transportation After the Excavation of Hangu Pass," and "The New Atmosphere of Nanguan in Kaifeng." After viewing these four oil paintings of photographs, one feels the inconvenience of transportation and the hardship of human transportation. The benefit of convenient transportation and vehicle transportation, and Mr. Wu's spirit of perseverance and hard work, inspires even greater admiration. Below the paintings, and on the left and right walls, hang twenty-five photographs along the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance automobile, a large panorama of the Liaoning Road in Liaoning City, Sichuan, and the Central Park of Chongqing, forty photographs of various roads and cities and new buildings in Wanxian, Sichuan, various scenic photographs of Beishan and Xiaobaishan in Jilin, photographs of road construction by the Jilin Municipal Preparatory Office, and various road and city and building photographs from Andong, Harbin, Chahar Province, and Liaoning Province, totaling no fewer than fifty or sixty pieces. After viewing this, the hatred aroused by the water ban, which led to the violent destruction and invasion by Japanese imperialists, spoils the fun. In addition, there are various famous road and city architecture photographs from Jiangxi, Henan, Shanxi, Ningxia, Fujian, Chengdu, Anqing, Nanchang, Hankou, Hanyang, and other cities, totaling one hundred and forty to fifty pieces, all framed in glass and hung on the left and right sides of the room. In the center of the room is a glass cabinet. The upper and lower layers of the cabinet are filled with road and city photographs from various places. Above the cabinet are three thick albums of national road and city photographs, totaling three to four hundred pieces, and more than one hundred and twenty various road and city landscape photographs collected by the Fujian Provincial Construction Department. After browsing, it is as if one has traveled all over the country, with all the landscapes and conditions of roads and cities in the country entering the eyes of tourists, a grand sight indeed.</p>

<h3>Extraordinary</h3>
<p>— Lu Xiang</p>
<p>This was indeed an extraordinary day. Although the early autumn sun still shone on thin clothes with the same usual heat, and white clouds still drifted lazily and quietly in the sky, extraordinary things finally happened on this ordinary day.</p>
<p>Even though there were well over a thousand people on this field, it was as silent as midnight. No, at midnight, there are still the sounds of autumn insects chirping, but at this moment, there was no sound at all. Everyone was trying their best to restrain their wildly beating hearts, not even letting their breaths gasp loudly. Occasionally, when people turned their heads and their eyes met, they exchanged a bitter look, but this look did not have the courage to last and they immediately lowered their heads. Then, the words on the small square of white cloth on their chests, "Unity, Solidarity, Shared National Crisis," came into view again, and they had to shift their gaze to the soft grass beneath their feet. A layer of haze covered everyone's faces, but the burning of their hearts, combined with the scorching sun, reflected a unique red glow in this haze. Everyone was patiently waiting, waiting for the start of an extraordinary meeting.</p>
<p>The bell rang with a drawn-out sound, reverberating in the still air. Several excited hearts could not help but tremble along with this heavy, loud bell. After a while, our Principal Li, along with the secretary and the deans of the various colleges, walked onto the stage. On their faces, we could also find the same layer of haze as on ours, but without the red glow of us young people.</p>
<p>After the customary rituals, because the platform was not very high, the shorter students in the back would surely have their view blocked by the taller ones in front. Therefore, by order of the military instructors, everyone sat down on the natural green carpet. If this were at any other time, it would have been such a pleasant thing! Such lovely weather, under the green sky, sitting on the soft and comfortable grass, so many people gathered together, and these companions were all equally young, equally happy, equally loving life and the world. But, this was, after all, an extraordinary day. In this scene of this day, no one dared—no, not dared, but wanted to—no one wanted to admit that this was a pleasant and happy gathering.</p>
<p>Time passed, second by second, from nine o'clock in the morning until after one o'clock in the afternoon. However, everyone was so excited that they forgot about their cramped and numb legs, forgot about the burning pain on their skin under the scorching sun, and even forgot that it was long past lunchtime. Our blood was flowing wildly, our hearts were burning. We could only desperately clap our hands to vent the enthusiasm we were strongly suppressing when the speakers on stage paused. Our eyes were filled with an uncontrollable surge of anger as we stared at the speakers on stage, who were speaking hoarsely, their faces flushed. Every word of theirs tightly gripped the raw, throbbing hearts of these young people.</p>
<p>Blood continued to flow, hearts continued to beat, but in this serious and tense atmosphere, besides the impassioned voices of the speakers, everything remained silent. No one had the courage to lightly cough to break through this silent air. Not even a tree dared to make a louder rustling sound to shake its leaves.</p>
<p>One speaker after another spoke. When a round of applause sent off the last word of the last speaker, the chairman announced the slogans. This immediately awakened the general group of youths who had been listening intently. One by one, they left the green carpet and stood up, raising their right hands high, and hoarsely shouted the slogans. Everyone boldly vented the intense emotions they had been suppressing for half a day. When it came to the last sentence, "The Chinese people will never die," it was more like a tidal wave of mad roars. But after the mad roars, it immediately returned to the silence of just now. Everyone lowered their heads, dragging their shadows listlessly and walked back to their dormitories with endless pain.</p>

<h3>The Story of Chinese Migration to Korea</h3>
<p>By Zhu Hongxi</p>
<p>After the Wanbaoshan Incident, Koreans, in a fit of anger, assaulted Chinese immigrants, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. This is truly a sad and regrettable event. Chinese migration to Korea dates back to three thousand years ago. Historical records of Jizi's migration to Korea mark the beginning of Chinese migration to Korea. The story of Jizi's migration to Korea is quite interesting. Allow me to write this story for friends who love to read stories.</p>
<p>Jizi was a man of the Yin Dynasty and a relative of King Zhou. He was a very learned man with a noble character. One day, he went to pay homage to King Zhou and was displeased by the king's debauchery. He thought that if King Zhou did not change his extravagant and dissolute ways, the Yin Dynasty would be in danger. Therefore, he tried his best to advise King Zhou, but the king would not listen. As a result, the Yin Dynasty fell at the hands of King Zhou.</p>
<p>After the fall of Yin, its land became the property of the Zhou Dynasty. Naturally, Jizi was a patriotic man who deeply mourned the demise of Yin. Therefore, he resolved not to become a subject of the Zhou Dynasty and decided to migrate to Korea.</p>
<p>As Jizi was about to go to Korea, he said, "I am unwilling to be commanded by you Zhou people. I am unwilling to be your subject. I am going to Korea to develop." After saying these words, Jizi left China.</p>
<p>Before Jizi arrived in Korea, he knew that Korean culture was very low. He brought with him various aspects of Chinese culture, including poetry, books, rituals, music, yin-yang philosophy, divination, and the skills of various craftsmen. When he arrived in Korea, the situation was indeed as he had imagined.</p>
<p>Seeing the difficulties of the Koreans' livelihood, Jizi gathered many Koreans in one place and said to them,</p>
<p>"Come, I will teach you a method of raising silkworms. Silkworms spin silk, and when the silk is woven together, it becomes silk fabric. With silk fabric, you can make clothes. Your clothing problems will be solved."</p>
<p>After Jizi finished speaking, he stretched and prepared to continue,</p>
<p>"Listen again, I will teach you a method of cultivation. If you can cultivate according to this method, your food problems will be solved."</p>
<p>Later, he also taught the Koreans Chinese poetry, books, rituals, music, divination, yin-yang philosophy, and other aspects of Chinese culture. Seeing the barbarity of the Koreans at the time, he also established eight laws for them to abide by. As a result, a barbaric Korean people, after being educated by Jizi, gradually moved towards the path of enlightenment.</p>
<p>The author notes that modern historians hold a skeptical attitude towards the story of Jizi's migration to Korea. However, the various relics of Jizi discovered in Korea today cannot but make us believe that Jizi's migration to Korea is not a baseless legend. Therefore, I have written this story to serve as a small reference for those who are interested in studying the Korean issue.</p>
