<p>（南京）　蔣主席此次出發勦匪、對宣傳方面、尤爲注意、特令行營政訓處、擬就勦匪善後宣傳大綱、及告勦匪士兵、告地方紳士、告勦匪軍官、告匪區民衆、告農民們等書、茲錄告勦匪軍官、告匪區民衆、及告農民書如下、</p>
<p>（一）告勦匪軍官書</p>
<p>忠勇的軍官同志們、勦滅赤匪、爲全國民意一致的要求、現在中央已依照國民會議、鄭重的决議、下最大的决心、努力於最短期間、一鼓殲除、以解救目前被匪蹂躪壓迫的民衆、消滅中國民族生存發展之障碍、諸位同志、是國家的干城、是人</p>
<p>民的先鋒、在此關繫於國家安危和民族生存的剿赤軍事進行中、必須敵愾同仇、</p>
<p>誓死奮鬥、而尤須明切的認識與瞭解下</p>
<p>列二點、（一）獻身於黨國、以表示我革命軍人的眞精神、萬惡的赤匪、是我們誓不兩立的敵人、赤匪的力量澎漲一分、我們的生機便斵喪一分、所以赤匪的存在與蔓延、和我們革命軍人的生存、兩者决不相容、我忠勇的將士、既然以身許國、就必須以撲滅赤匪爲自己唯一的職責、以救國家民族者而自救、在軍事進展的時候、</p>
<p>决不能存一毫保存實力的私心、逡巡遲疑、致使赤匪日益猖獗、因爲赤燄苟囂張</p>
<p>無已、我們個人的生命、尙且無以自保、</p>
<p>實力又安所用、何况我們以一當百、以十當千、去剿除流寇式的赤匪、勝利必然屬於我們、即或偶有損失、政府自必適應國家的需要、力求補充、而對於努力的同志、並特予以特殊的褒奬、和不次的拔擢、單者易折、衆則難摧、這是一個很淺顯的道理、赤匪雖狡、祇須我們參加剿赤的軍隊、能夠同心合力、彼此收互助之效、必不難在最短期内、將他們消滅凈盡、假使我們人自爲戰、甲軍進而乙軍袖手旁觀、不但甲軍因勢孤而失機、且將使乙軍受連带的影響、而同遭挫折、所以這一次剿赤、必須屏除隔岸觀火的熊度、要各友軍同生死共榮辱、大家嚴密團結、一致並進、同時向赤匪進攻、然後才能收羣策羣力的效果、消滅赤匪於俄頃、而救國家民族於險危、以上二點、和我們這次剿赤戰事的成敗利鈍、有極大的關係、各同志在已往北伐討逆諸役、惡戰苦鬥、尙能博得百戰百勝的光榮、似此區區數萬的流寇、若一任其豕突狠奔、害家害國、豈不是我們革命軍人的恥辱、現在蔣總司令已經親赴前方、躬冒矢石、指揮督剿、與一般士卒、同嘗甘苦、希望諸同志必須上體總司令大無畏的犧牲精神、下副全國國民殷殷的期望、以最後的决心、爲最大的努力、消滅赤匪、綏靖地方、那才是革命軍人無上的光榮、那才可以全國國民愛戴我革命軍人、永久而勿替、</p>
<p>（二）告匪區民衆書</p>
<p>親愛的民衆們、你們在匪區内、已經愛夠了、赤匪的蹂躪、赤手空拳的民衆、自然無力抵抗赤匪的横暴、只好讓他焚殺刦掠、在朝不保夕的慘狀下、忍泣呑聲、過非人的生活、縱使有些隨聲附和的民衆、</p>
<p>然而多半是受其脅迫、有的是爲着勢孤力薄、不能抗拒、有的是爲着無衣無食、</p>
<p>只好屈從、决不是甘心從匪、這種情形、</p>
<p>政府已十分了解、對於安分守己的良民、</p>
<p>固然憐憫他們的苦况、對於被迫從匪的民衆、也充分的予以同情、我們知道、赤匪一天不剪滅、匪區民衆的痛苦、决不能解除、現在中央以最大的决心、雄厚的兵力、期於最短期間、澈底撲滅赤匪、要從水深火熱中、把你們拯救出來、使你們能永遠的安居樂業、同時你們也應該在匪區内、自動的嚴密組織起來、以便勦匪軍隊進攻時、好作國軍的内應、萬一你們没有能力機會去組織、也應該趕快逃出匪區、將赤匪的情形、報告國軍、作國軍的嚮導、這是你們的生死關頭、你們要各自努力、假若你們不趕快覺悟、一旦匪區攻破、良莠難分、玉石俱焚、那就後悔也來不及了、匪區的民衆們、歷史的事實告訴我們、盜賊的結果總是歸於滅亡、你們切不可再爲邪説所煽動、爲暴力所脅制、疑慮反側、因循自誤、你們唯一的生機、只有要求中央軍隊、迅速肅清萬惡的赤匪、</p>
<p>你們唯一自救的方法、就是援助中央軍隊、克復赤匪所盤踞的地方、　　（三）敬告農民書　　農民們、赤匪的凶横殘暴、你們總該認識清楚了、他們威脅你們的子弟、供他們驅役、替他們犧牲、他們把你們的妻女當作貨物、任意分配、自由奸汚、他們没收你們的土地、爲各區僞蘇維埃政府的公産、</p>
<p>你們的生活衣食、他們是一概不管、如果你們稍微表示反抗或不顧的意思、他們便焚毀你們的住宅、並使你們及你們的親屬、都成刀下之鬼、他們爲什麽要這様對待你們呢、原來他們所需要的、是游手無業的流氓地痞、這就是他們所謂眞正的無産階級、你們既以耕種爲業、他們把你們當作富農小地主、這就是他們所謂最有力量、最難掃除的障碍、所以他們造成流氓地痞的共産世界起見、第一步要把你們弄窮、第二步再把你們弄死、所以、你們要知道赤匪是與你們不能並存的、</p>
<p>你們要生存、便不能容赤匪、容赤匪你們便不能生存、赤匪既然與你們不能並存、</p>
<p>你不殺他、他要殺你、不能拼死、莫想求生、所以在匪區内的人、能夠反抗、便當即行動手、不能反抗、便當逃出匪區、</p>
<p>設法殺賊、在匪區以外的人、尤宜加緊團結、或組織守望隊、或成立義勇團、砲槍大刀、鋤頭鐮斧、都是殺匪的利器、自衛的武力、民氣既張、匪胆必怯、祇要有拼死的决心、便没有可怕的匪類、現在蔣總司令親自出發前方、督師進勦了、已抱了剿滅赤匪拯救你們的决心、不滅赤匪、誓不干休、望你們乘此時機、大家團結一致、與匪拼命、更應該援助國軍、替國軍作嚮導、代國軍探匪情、使勦匪軍隊、能迅速成功、這才是你們目前惟一的生路、</p>

<p>我國體育界。近已有人喚起注意於平均發逹。不沾沾於造就一二特殊之人才。不可謂非我體育界之進步也。德國體育。注重普遍。故其國人體力强健意志堅毅能耐一切勞苦。爲世人所共知。我國向承重文輕武之陋習。又不知衛生與健康爲何事。漸漸養成萎靡孱弱之身體。辦事則不勝繁劇。思想則不能鋭進。一切工作效率低淺。體弱之徵象如此。而欲競爭於國際之間。則無論爲學問爲技術爲事業上各種建設。皆在必敗之列。是豈我民族之特性。果劣於人哉。實我敎育界不知提倡有以成之也。數年前之辦敎育者。有見乎學風之浮靡。士氣之不振。求其改革之道而不得。則隨意嘗試或鼓以政治上興味。爲一時奮鬭之剌激。遂成一閧之習。敎育界之現象益危。最近一般青年。覺悟體育爲增進精神道德及一切學業之基本科目。而一致注意於此。不可謂非敎育界之好現象。惟若僅僅六意於一二傑出之人才。以備比賽時爲學校增光之用。則亦不無流弊。故必須一致注重於平均發逹謀普遍之健全自在學校當局。隨時留意於衛生之設備司運動訓練之責者。隨時留意指導與糾正。而其基礎則尤在小學中對於兒童之健康與其活潑之精神。皆須善於保養。始基既善。然後逐漸發展。以成就此勤勞忠勇樸實守律之習尙。而一掃織弱柔靡苟且消極浪漫之風。斯則我國最要之一事也。今者敎部。正在開會研究中小學課程設儰標準。吾甚望其能注意於此點。國内要電二</p>

<p>久聞溧陽龍潭山。風景殊絶。較之西子湖畔。尤勝一籌。日前因約友人劉友賢金冰蘭二君。并内子小女等五六人。買舟往遊。山在溧城之南。距城四十餘里。經戴埠鎭。自鎭以上。沿途松竹繚繞。溪水出脚下。山花羅布。野鳥爭飛。令人似入桃源仙境。更進數里。萬巒重疊。流泉自石上飛來。祇聞水聲。余等就石上小坐。忽見一樵子從綠陰中肩薪而至。即詢以龍潭山有何古蹟。樵子答曰。數里外有康甸禪師新建之龍潭禪寺。有何仙姑鍊丹處。有鍊丹井。鍊丹竈。並有明末陳忭若大儒隠居處。石壁數里。瀑布下瀉。再進龍山之南。數百畝李花正放。中有小村。可索茶解渴。再上里許。則有仙人石洞。可燃燭而入。樵子言畢。肩薪而去。余等由竹徑而過小溪。見山腰寺宇巍然。亟從松間小徑直上。復過一澗。逹龍潭禪寺。入寺。見佛像莊嚴。陳設古樸。但在寺許久。不見一僧。惟寺南深谷中。有一老叟。年逾花甲。竹笠芒鞋。手携竹杖。倚立桃花石塢之右。目炯炯然。似有法光外射。余等轉過石壁。趨前爲禮。詢以寺内有大和尙否。老叟答曰。大居士從何方來。老衲乃康甸和尙是也。遂延入寺内。汲龍潭泉。烹野山茶。味香而甘。繼復以粗米飯野菜根相餉。余等飽餐畢。康甸大笑曰。如此粗米菜根。能放下肚去。總歸善根不淺。聞康甸與滬上史量才王一亭先生等相稔。好吟咏。善書法。杭州靈隠寺彌勒閣之扁額。即其所書也。余因索聯一副。聯曰。池魚知水性。野鳥悦花香。筆法蒼勁。彌可寳愛。康甸近嘗遊六橋三竺間。泊舟靜慈寺湖畔。有詩一絶云。蓮花深處挹芬芳。口念彌陀也不妨。風捲微波無俗氣。紅塵遙隔水雲鄉。又題登大佛寺石欄憑眺一絶云。老樹叢中一度鐘。六橋波捲夕陽紅。熱心凈土超塵俗。冷面西湖笑醉翁。余等遊罷言旋。康甸歡送至數里外。殷勤可感。余等旋抵一小村。小息農家。老農出香茗相欵。余因問以康甸和尙身世。老農答謂。康甸爲前清翰林。曾充某軍長。復主湖北羣報筆政。茲因頻年國事蜩螗。心灰意懶。遂削髮爲僧。來此隠居云。越日返滬。誌之以留鴻爪。</p>

<p>萬里髫年即好藝事。家富庋藏。終日繙　於是獨得懸解。畫爲品格之表示。以萬里之清才超越。所作畫淡遠峻拔。瀟灑出塵。畫宗天池復堂。而甜潤有致。寫牽牛一幀。獨出靈性之表示。色澤蒼潤。志趣渾圓。天健乘醉爲題一絶云。畫到牽牛花不香。潘郎欲斷九迴腸。天孫雲錦空留恨。怎奈人间日月長。蓋萬里新赋悼亡。斯畫斯詩。寄感深遠。聞萬里夫人湯眉蒨女史。亦擅藝事。今則玉樓赴召。徒留長太息而已。子鼎以休寗諸生。歷官四方。夙嫺工筆人物。於改七薌尤爲神似。晚年復得文唐氣韻。爲藝林所推重。陳列畫中。以秋風清絶雁來時。及楓林晚坐二幅。最擅勝塲。至於趙君半跛。以七十餘老翁。好此不疲。尤爲藝林佳話。半跛於五十歲後。始習丹青。蟠根錯節。有八大風味。近復參以白陽新羅之神姿。冬心玉几之骨韻。更覺疎秀入骨。酣暢淋漓。惟平生拙於爲官。處脂不潤。乃粥畫自遣。蓋半跛以循吏之才。退隠於畫者。畫中頗富詩意。且筆到畫至。風味自存云。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>向善行君來函。略謂騐方新編所載救飢各法。均頗简而易行。究於人體生理。是否有益無損。頗慺疑義云云。栩按其第一方爲糯米三升芝蔴三升。各自用水淘凈。以慢火炒熟。先將糯米磨粉。後入芝麻同磨爲末。又用紅棗三斤。煮爛去皮核。搗和爲丸。每重五錢。日食一丸。滾水送下。可以不飢。如無糯米紅棗。則粳米黑棗亦可。此方實即吾杭尼庵中所製擦酥。但不爲丸。而爲一口酥狀耳。香味極美。耐人咀嚼。僅啖兩枚娵館。每枚重約四錢。能耐四小時之飢。惟多啖。則胸次梗塞不舒。故宜細嚼。佐以茶水。吾家即嘗製此爲食。並不足奇。考之人體生理衛生學。凡人每日所需滋養料。以中等勞動者論。需要蛋白質一百三十克至一百五十克。脂肪八十四克。澱粉四百零四克。水二千八百克。鹽三十克。蛋白質即維他命Ａ。爲含淡素物。尋常食米一斤。僅含三十六克。而糯米一斤。則含八十四克。芝蔴一斤。則含一百二十三克有奇。故用芝蔴一升。可抵食米三升半。糯米一升。約抵食米二升半。古人之法。亦正合於理化。具徵格物窮理之功。固已至乎其極。但習焉而不察耳。茲列比较表如左。均以六百克（即天平十六兩）之含量爲準</p>
<p>品名　淡　素　含　水　炭　素　備　　考　　　蛋　白質　脂肪　質　澱粉　質</p>
<p>米　　三六克　　一二、　　四四四、</p>
<p>麥　　六○、　　一二、　三八四、　每一升可抵食米一升七合</p>
<p>糯米　　八四、　　三九、六　　四五六、　每一升可抵食米二升三合三</p>
<p>芝　蔴　一二三、三　三○九、四　　七五、六　每一升可抵食米三升半</p>
<p>如上觀之可見糯米芝麻。所含淡素富。自可以少勝多、惟其所含脂肪過量。胃液不能使之完全消化、故宜炒熟。使其油分發揮。加以棗泥。不過使其容易揑和。棗於脾胃有益。具詳本草。故此第一方。决可用也。</p>
<p>其第二方云。板栗紅棗胡桃。均去皮。柿餅去蒂。各等分。蒸一二時取出。放石曰中摀極融爛。捻爲厚餅。以冬月修合曝乾收貯。一餅可耐三四日不飢、過三四日再服一餅。更能耐久。謂能補腎健脾潤肺清肝。但須細嚼云云。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>不過警士的槍。向來是不大朝着百姓放的。打槍還要讓老總是能手。所以警士　聽到軍士駡過去。照例忍耐着。只當没有聽見。只拼命去把打架的車夫拉開。一路带上區裏去。張小三兒道。「呔。巡警。滚開點。别管拉車。他們打他們的架。與你什麽相干。」警士見他明呌出來了。這可不能再裝媽虎。便道。「我們維持地面。不能讓他們在當街打架。我們辦我們的公事。與各位什麽相干。」張小三兒道。「揍你們這班混蛋。讓你瞧瞧膠皮團也不要緊。這一排兵士裏面。有七八個是入過膠皮團的。齊齊的和了一聲道。「揍。」於是一擁而上。對那三個警士。拳打脚踢。不問上中下。只管攻擊過去。張小三兒更是打得巧。解下腰上的皮带。拿着一頭。當着甩頭一子。亂抽亂鞭。看的人退着遠遠的。都替警士擔心。一些流氓和野孩子們。却鼓了掌呌好。三個警士先還想回手。打算抓住一兩個兵士。後來他們全排兵士。一齊動員。三個人只得掉頭就跑。人叢裏落下兩頂警帽。也不顧了。張小三兒喘着氣。繫起了皮带子。在地上檢起一根警棍和一頂警帽。將棍子頂着警帽。高撑過了人頭。張嘴哈哈大笑。别一個兵搶了向地上一扔。笑道。「别鬧了。排長在駡了。」長小三兒胸脯子一挺。一擺頭道。「兵没算白當。今天出了一口氣。」將軍帽取下。用手一抺頭上的汗。然後再把軍帽向腦袋頂上一磕。帽子前的遮日牌。鴨嘴兒向上。露出一大截額頭。得意洋洋的歸隊了。這事鬧過以後。並没有影響。只次日報上。有一條社會新聞。載着幾個穿灰布短衣的人。在農商部街口上。與警察小有衝突。旋即平靖。不但没載明那部的兵士。連這個兵字都没載出。於是他們除了白逛花園。白坐電車之外。多一項白揍警士。</p>

<p>▲絲身不佳…細絲四十六元肥絲四十元丹陽各市鄉、今歲春蠶因天時惡劣、繭産奇歉、繭身亦不佳、繭行拒收劣繭、鄉民紛紛自繅土絲、携市求售、城中各絲行已正式開市、因絲色黑次、開價不高、高等細絲、每百兩祇開洋四十六元、肥絲四十元、各行收貨寥云、</p>

<p>據一般茶商調查估計、祁門子茶、較上年不過十分之二、將來熟茶成本、扯價約需一百八九十兩云、</p>

<h3 id="e11">Bandit Suppression Proclamation of the Headquarters <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang is paying particular attention to propaganda during this bandit suppression campaign. He has specifically ordered the Political Training Department of the Headquarters to draft a general outline for bandit suppression and post-war propaganda, as well as proclamations to bandit suppression soldiers, local gentry, bandit suppression officers, the people in bandit areas, and farmers. The following are the proclamations to bandit suppression officers, the people in bandit areas, and farmers:</p>
<p>(1) Proclamation to Bandit Suppression Officers</p>
<p>Loyal and courageous officers, suppressing the red bandits is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. Now, the Central Government, in accordance with the solemn resolution of the National Assembly, has made the greatest determination to eliminate them in the shortest possible time in order to rescue the people currently trampled and oppressed by the bandits and eliminate the obstacles to the survival and development of the Chinese nation. Comrades, you are the pillars of the country and the vanguards of the people. In this anti-bandit military operation, which is related to the safety of the country and the survival of the nation, you must share the same hatred for the enemy and fight to the death. In particular, you must clearly recognize and understand the following two points: (1) Dedicate yourself to the Party and the country to show the true spirit of our revolutionary soldiers. The evil red bandits are our sworn enemies. The strength of the red bandits increases by one point, and our vitality decreases by one point. Therefore, the existence and spread of the red bandits and the survival of our revolutionary soldiers are absolutely incompatible. Since our loyal soldiers have pledged themselves to the country, they must regard the suppression of the red bandits as their only responsibility and save the country and the nation by saving themselves. In the course of military progress, you must not harbor the slightest selfishness in preserving your strength or hesitate, causing the red bandits to become increasingly rampant. Because if the flames of the red bandits continue to spread unchecked, we will not be able to protect our own lives, let alone use our strength. Moreover, we can defeat the bandit-like red bandits by using one to fight against a hundred and ten to fight against a thousand. Victory will surely belong to us. Even if there are occasional losses, the government will certainly adapt to the needs of the country and strive to replenish them. For comrades who work hard, special commendations and extraordinary promotions will be given. A single stalk is easily broken, but a bundle is difficult to break. This is a very simple principle. Although the red bandits are cunning, as long as the troops participating in the bandit suppression can work together and help each other, it will not be difficult to wipe them out completely in the shortest possible time. If we fight each other separately, and Army A advances while Army B stands by, not only will Army A lose the opportunity due to its isolation, but Army B will also be affected and suffer setbacks. Therefore, in this bandit suppression campaign, we must eliminate the attitude of watching from the other side of the river. All friendly troops must share life and death and glory and disgrace. Everyone must unite closely and advance together, attacking the red bandits at the same time, so as to achieve the effect of collective wisdom and eliminate the red bandits in an instant and save the country and the nation from danger. The above two points are extremely important to the success or failure of our bandit suppression campaign. In the past Northern Expedition and punitive expeditions, comrades, you were able to win the glory of winning every battle through fierce fighting. If we allow these tens of thousands of bandits to rush around and harm the country and the people, wouldn't that be a disgrace to our revolutionary soldiers? Now Commander-in-Chief Chiang has personally gone to the front, braving arrows and stones, directing and supervising the bandit suppression, and sharing the joys and sorrows with the general soldiers. I hope that all comrades must learn from Commander-in-Chief's spirit of selfless sacrifice and live up to the earnest expectations of the people of the whole country. With the final determination, make the greatest effort to eliminate the red bandits and pacify the local area. That is the supreme glory of the revolutionary soldiers, and that is how the people of the whole country can love our revolutionary soldiers forever.</p>
<p>(2) Proclamation to the People in Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Dear people, you have suffered enough in the bandit areas from the trampling of the red bandits. The unarmed people are naturally unable to resist the brutality of the red bandits. You have no choice but to let them burn, kill, rob, and plunder. In a state of precariousness, you swallow your tears and live an inhuman life. Even if some of you echo them, it is mostly because you are coerced, some because you are isolated and weak and cannot resist, and some because you have no clothes or food and have no choice but to submit. You are definitely not willing to follow the bandits. The government fully understands this situation. It not only sympathizes with the plight of the good people who keep to themselves, but also fully sympathizes with the people who are forced to follow the bandits. We know that the suffering of the people in the bandit areas cannot be relieved until the red bandits are eliminated. Now the Central Government, with the greatest determination and strong military strength, is determined to thoroughly eliminate the red bandits in the shortest possible time and rescue you from the abyss of suffering so that you can live and work in peace and contentment forever. At the same time, you should also automatically organize yourselves strictly in the bandit areas so that when the bandit suppression troops attack, you can act as internal support for the national army. If you do not have the ability or opportunity to organize, you should quickly escape from the bandit areas and report the situation of the red bandits to the national army and act as guides for the national army. This is a matter of life and death for you. You must work hard on your own. If you do not wake up quickly, once the bandit areas are broken, it will be difficult to distinguish between good and bad, and everything will be destroyed. Then it will be too late to regret. The historical facts tell us that the end of bandits is always destruction. You must not be incited by heresies or coerced by violence again. Do not hesitate and delay yourselves. Your only chance of survival is to ask the central army to quickly eliminate the evil red bandits.</p>
<p>Your only way to save yourselves is to help the central army recover the places occupied by the red bandits. (3) A Respectful Message to Farmers Farmers, you should all be clearly aware of the ferocity and brutality of the red bandits. They threaten your children and force them to serve and sacrifice for them. They treat your wives and daughters as goods, arbitrarily distributing and freely raping them. They confiscate your land as public property of the pseudo-Soviet government in each district. They do not care about your livelihood, clothing, or food. If you show the slightest resistance or disregard, they will burn your houses and turn you and your relatives into ghosts under the knife. Why do they treat you like this? Originally, what they needed were vagrants and hooligans who were idle and unemployed. This is what they call the true proletariat. Since you are engaged in farming, they regard you as rich peasants and petty landlords. This is what they call the most powerful and most difficult obstacle to remove. Therefore, in order to create a communist world for vagrants and hooligans, the first step is to impoverish you, and the second step is to kill you. Therefore, you must know that the red bandits cannot coexist with you.</p>
<p>If you want to survive, you cannot tolerate the red bandits. If you tolerate the red bandits, you cannot survive. Since the red bandits cannot coexist with you, if you do not kill them, they will kill you. If you do not fight to the death, do not think about surviving. Therefore, those who are in the bandit areas and can resist should take action immediately. Those who cannot resist should escape from the bandit areas and try to kill the bandits. Those who are outside the bandit areas should strengthen their unity, organize watch teams, or form volunteer corps. Guns, cannons, broadswords, hoes, and sickles are all sharp weapons for killing bandits and defensive forces. When the morale of the people is high, the bandits will be timid. As long as you have the determination to fight to the death, there are no bandits to be afraid of. Now Commander-in-Chief Chiang has personally set out for the front to supervise the troops and advance to suppress the bandits. He has made up his mind to eliminate the red bandits and save you. He will not give up until the red bandits are eliminated. I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to unite as one and fight the bandits to the death. You should also help the national army, guide the national army, and find out the situation of the bandits for the national army so that the bandit suppression troops can succeed quickly. This is your only way to survive at present.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen told reporters that the supplementary Jin army salary for May has been registered and claimed separately, and is being remitted back in succession. The funds prepared in Jin Sui have been stored in the Shanxi Bank, and will be issued to the various armies as soon as the funds are received. The Jin grain loan is purely for relieving the plight of the people in southern Shanxi. The opposition comes from the northern and central parts of Shanxi, who are protecting their own interests and not considering the suffering of their fellow provincials. If they insist on opposing, it can be stopped. The provincial government believes it can face the people of the entire province without shame. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">A Good Omen in the Sports World <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>In China's sports world, some have recently called attention to balanced development, rather than focusing solely on cultivating a few exceptional talents. This can be said to be progress in our sports world. German sports emphasize universality, so their people are known for their physical strength, strong will, and ability to endure all kinds of hardships. China has long suffered from the bad habits of valuing literature over martial arts and not knowing about hygiene and health. Gradually, it has developed a weak and frail physique. People are overwhelmed by complicated tasks, and their thinking cannot be sharp. The efficiency of all work is low and superficial. The signs of physical weakness are such that if we want to compete in the international arena, whether in academics, technology, or various construction projects in our careers, we are destined to fail. Is this truly the inferior nature of our nation? It is because our education system does not know how to promote and achieve it. A few years ago, those who ran education saw the frivolousness of the academic atmosphere and the lack of morale. They sought a way to reform it but could not find it. Then they tried arbitrarily or encouraged political interest as a temporary stimulus for struggle, which resulted in a chaotic practice. The situation in the education world became increasingly dangerous. Recently, a group of young people have realized that physical education is a basic subject for enhancing mental morality and all academic studies and have unanimously paid attention to it. This can be said to be a good omen in the education world. However, if we only focus on a few outstanding talents to bring glory to the school during competitions, there will also be drawbacks. Therefore, we must unanimously focus on balanced development and strive for universal health. School authorities should always pay attention to hygiene facilities, and those responsible for sports training should always pay attention to guidance and correction. The foundation is especially in elementary schools, where the health of children and their lively spirit must be well maintained. Only with a good foundation can we gradually develop and achieve the habit of diligence, loyalty, bravery, simplicity, and discipline, and sweep away the weak, soft, frivolous, perfunctory, negative, and romantic atmosphere. This is one of the most important things for our country. Today, the Ministry of Education is holding a meeting to study the curriculum and equipment standards for primary and secondary schools. I sincerely hope that they can pay attention to this point. National Telegraphic News II</p>

Key figures from the Philippine Parliament went to welcome them. Senator Hawes issued an article after landing, saying that he planned to stay in the Philippines for six weeks.

Now, the Philippines must send another delegation to Washington, DC, when the next Congress convenes to discuss the matter. People in Washington, DC, are in agreement with the uncertainty of the Philippines' status. Whether they oppose Philippine independence or support it, they all believe that the uncertainty of status is detrimental to the welfare of the Philippines and harmful to the interests of the United States.

<p>Attracts the attention of other countries. ▲ Reuters, London, 18th: News came from Shanghai that Soviet Russia is now willing to sell its shares in the Chinese Eastern Railway to China for 400 million gold rubles, without paying cash, but using the customs duties on Soviet Russian goods imported into China as collateral until the purchase price is paid off. Although the truth of this news is uncertain, it is extremely attention-grabbing. According to certain business circles, according to the treaty, China must allocate a large portion of its customs duties to repay foreign debts. If China and Soviet Russia conclude a treaty allowing Soviet Russia to actually import goods worth more than 100 million pounds duty-free, this policy will inevitably cause stern protests from other powers, because even if the agreement does not violate the most-favored-nation clause of various countries' commercial treaties, Soviet Russia, with its cheap goods produced under the Five-Year Plan, actually enjoys duty-free status and dumps them in China, which will inevitably create a very serious situation and affect other trading countries.</p>

As for the personnel of the Eight Departments, the Guards Brigade, and the Garrison Division who will accompany Chairman Chiang to Jiangxi, all of them arrived in the province by train from Xunjiang to Nanxun Road yesterday. The political training personnel were led by Luo Junqiang, the secretary-general of the department, and are currently residing in the Jiangxi Grand Hotel. Vice Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng, believing that transportation and transportation are very important with Chairman Chiang's imminent arrival in Jiangxi, also arrived in the province by special train from Jiujiang to Nanxun Road on the 16th and paid respects to Minister He and Chairman Lu to discuss the establishment and transportation of logistics stations. It is reported that a general logistics headquarters will be established in Nanchang to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>The Central Government recently approved the establishment of a Local Reorganization Committee in Jiangxi Province, with a term of three months, to handle the party and government affairs and post-disaster work in the bandit areas. Now that the three-month term has expired, and the General Headquarters has newly established two special committees for party affairs and politics, which will be established in Jiangxi in the near future, the Local Reorganization Committee convened its final meeting of all members yesterday, announcing its termination. The various matters that have been handled and have not been handled will be handled by the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and the competent authorities, respectively (17th).</p>

<p>To Distribute Salaries to Song, Pang, and Sun's Troops ▲ Zhang Yushu Discusses Advance Distribution of May Salaries Taiyuan Correspondence: The Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters dispatched Zhang Yushu, Li Linshu, Xie Youwei, Yang Linpu, and others to Shanxi to distribute May salaries to the troops of Song Zheyuan, Sun Dianying, and Pang Bingxun. Zhang and the others arrived in Taiyuan several days ago. However, Song and the others were all stationed in their defense areas, and there was no way to make contact regarding the distribution procedures. Yesterday, Song and Pang came to Taiyuan from Yuncheng specifically for this matter to discuss the distribution methods with Zhang and the others and expressed their welcome. Sun Dianying, due to his convalescence, sent Hu Jiesan, the director of his office in Taiyuan, to receive them on his behalf. It is said that Song and Pang decided to depart within a day or two with Zhang and the others to carry out the distribution. Yesterday, I visited Mr. Zhang Yushu, who said that he had been ordered to Shanxi with two tasks: first, to inspect the situation of all the troops; and second, since the Northern armies are now directly under the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, according to the usual practice of the Northeast Army, personnel must be sent to distribute salaries to see if they are distributed and whether the soldiers receive them. Now that the troops of Song, Sun, and Pang are under the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, they will naturally follow the same practice. We are here for this purpose. Now, we will first distribute the May salaries to the troops of Song and the others, and then we will distribute them monthly. Army Commander Song (Zheyuan) and Division Commander Pang (Bingxun) also came to Taiyuan today. The departure date for the distribution will be decided tomorrow (the 14th). I, along with Li Linshu, Xie Youwei, Yang Linpu, and others, will accompany Army Commander Song to Yuncheng for distribution. Chief of Staff Gao and a quartermaster will accompany the personnel sent by Division Commander Sun to Jincheng for distribution. In the future, the military pay and provisions for all troops will be allocated monthly and will no longer be supplied by the local people. As for the Shanxi military pay, there are already people here preparing the roster to receive it, but they have not yet been able to complete it. However, in my estimation, the May salaries should be issued soon. (June 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Shanxi-Suiyuan Generals Return to Their Defense Posts One After Another <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shang Zhen Will Visit Zhang Again at an Appropriate Time ▲ Wang Jingguo and Li Peiji Return to Suiyuan Together</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Shang Zhen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, came to Beiping a few days ago to meet with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang to report on the current military and political situation in Shanxi. When he arrived in Beiping, Zhang had already moved into the hospital for recuperation due to illness. Although he went to visit him once, he was unable to talk to him due to the doctor's orders, so he stayed in Beiping for a long time. Recently, although Zhang's condition has improved day by day, he still needs a long period of recuperation, and there are many government affairs in Shanxi that need to be dealt with. Therefore, Shang intends to return to Taiyuan first and visit him again at an appropriate time. However, he still needs to discuss this with the important figures in Beiping, so he has not yet made a complete decision. As for the Shanxi generals in Beiping, such as Fu Zuoyi, Li Peiji, and Wang Jingguo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang had instructed them to return to their defense posts first. Fu still has matters to attend to in Beiping and needs to delay his return to Suiyuan for a few days. Li Shengda took the Pinghan special train south to Taiyuan on the evening of the 14th. Li Peiji and Wang Jingguo took the Pingsui train west on the afternoon of the 14th. Wang Jingguo told reporters at the station that he had been in Beiping for nearly half a month.</p>
<p>He originally planned to return to Suiyuan after meeting with the Deputy Commander-in-Chief and receiving instructions. However, since the Deputy Commander-in-Chief was recuperating in the hospital and could not receive guests, and since he had been away from his defense post for a long time, he bid farewell to Chief of Staff Ji yesterday and returned to Suiyuan first. He will come to Beiping again after the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's health recovers, he said.</p>
<p>Li Peiji's return to Suiyuan is because the opening ceremony of the Minsheng Canal will be held on June 22nd, so he is returning to Suiyuan to preside over it. Before his departure, Li made a statement saying that he was originally waiting for Deputy Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>Ling to recover from his illness so that he could meet with him, request instructions, and then return.</p>
<p>However, the opening of the Minsheng Canal is near, and many Chinese and foreign guests have been invited to attend the ceremony. As the host, I must personally receive them, so I have to return temporarily first. After Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang is able to receive guests, I will come again. After I arrive in Suiyuan, I will go to Sa County to inspect the project and make arrangements for everything. A commissioner has been left here to receive Chinese and foreign guests. I have already negotiated with the Pingsui Railway and prepared two special cars, which will be attached to the passenger train on the 20th and will arrive at Sa County Station on the afternoon of the 21st. All the food and drinks used along the way have been prepared so as not to neglect the guests. I hope that more journalists will go to investigate the situation in the Northwest and inform the people of the country, so that they will know that the more remote the area, the richer the treasures are. It is not necessary to go to overseas colonies; we should first develop what our country already has and not leave it abandoned for a long time, which would arouse the covetousness of foreigners.

<h3 id="e78">Bandit Troops Flee in Western Hunan <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Army Has Recaptured Taoyuan ▲ Now Advancing Along the Yuan River to Suppress Them</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Dai Huiheng's troops in Western Hunan suddenly surrendered and then rebelled, their attitude uncertain. Recently, they fled back to Taoyuan from the border of Chenzhou. He Jian dispatched Deng Nanji, the commander of the 19th Division, to supervise the troops in a joint encirclement and suppression. On the 8th of this month, they recaptured Taoyuan City. The rebellious soldiers surrendered and turned in their weapons one after another, and many fled in all directions. Dai is ignorant of military affairs and has not changed his bandit nature, so the soldiers are unwilling to be used by him, so many surrendered and fled. However, there is still a part trying to resist. Our army is now encircling and attacking along the Yuan River.</p>
<p>The date of complete resolution should be just around the corner. The following is a telegram from Western Hunan: (1) Deng Nanji, the brigade commander, telegraphed on a good day, saying that the rebellious troops suffered heavy losses after being defeated by our army, and the soldiers fled in all directions. One group fled towards Jianjiaxi and Zhengjiayi, seemingly fleeing to the border of Yuanxun.</p>
<p>One group fled towards Xianrenxi, seemingly escaping to Cili and Dayong. I have already dispatched teams to pursue them in different directions, striving to resolve the issue and eliminate the root cause. (2) Liu Yungian, Commander of the Changli Garrison, telegraphed from Changde on a good hour of the You day, saying: 1. According to the report from Hu District Commander (Zai Kun), the main force of the enemy Qi Wan camped near one li north of Xianrenxi. I am leading the team to pursue them towards Xianrenxi. Chen Detachment (Zixian) was ordered to pass through Zhangjiawan and Jianjiaxi and advance along the river. I am reporting this for your information, etc. 2. I previously ordered a part of the team dispatched by Cili to encircle and suppress the bandits in the Huangshi Longtan River area. Recently, a member dispatched by Cili came to Long and said that four teams had been dispatched and departed on the Yang day and arrived near Longtan River on the Qi day. 3. According to the enemy situation reported from the front, it seems that the main force of the rebellious troops</p>
<p>has fled to Ciyong and is retreating towards Yuanling. I have already telegraphed Brigade Commander Gong Renjie, stationed in Yuanling, to send a team to block and attack them. Respectfully submitted by Liu Yungian. (3) Commander Liu telegraphed at a good hour of the You day, saying: According to Zhang Xicheng, the liaison officer sent by my department to Taoyuan, he reported the following: 1. Qi Yi, my Chen Detachment Zixian, used wheels to pass through Jiandao, and He Regiment Ping passed through Baiyang River and advanced towards the enemy in Taoyuan City along the highway. My team occupied Hailuo Mountain on the Yang evening and attacked Maqiao Yunxia Mountain from there on the Qi morning. The enemy was unable to resist, and the main force fled in the direction of Niqietan,</p>
<p>and part of the force fled towards Zhangjiawan in the direction of Taoyuan. 2. The team followed the enemy's main force to pursue them and arrived near Gaoya on the Qi evening. Today, they are attacking along the Yuan River. 3. Brigade Commander Deng and Regiment Commander He have already entered Taoyuan City on the Qi day. The above three items are specially telegraphed for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Hunan Province Asks the Central Government to Allocate Funds for Disaster Relief <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲ Floods After War and Banditry ▲ More Than One Million Victims ▲ The Disaster Area Occupies More Than Ten Counties</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province has suffered from war, banditry, and floods for years. People are displaced everywhere. Recently, floods have caused disasters again, inundating more than ten counties, including Xiangxiang. Fields and houses have been washed away, and countless properties have been lost and people drowned. Yesterday, the Hunan Disaster Relief Association and the Hunan Provincial Relief Association telegraphed the central government, requesting the urgent allocation of huge sums of money for relief. The telegrams are recorded as follows: ▲ Telegram from the Hunan Disaster Relief Association: To President Jiang of the Nanjing National Government, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Liu of the Ministry of the Interior, and Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee, with respect. Hunan Province has been plagued by war for years.</p>
<p>The people's livelihood is exhausted and has reached its limit. Last year, the Red Bandits wreaked havoc, occupying Changsha, killing, plundering, and burning, surpassing Huang Chao and Chuang Xian. The people's clothing, food, housing, and shelter had long been reduced to ashes. As for Chaling's four losses, Huarong's three occupations, Pingliu's transformation into a bandit area, and Yueyang, Xiangyin, Liling, Youxian, Nanxian, Anxiang, Lingxian, Rucheng, Yizhang,</p>
<p>Chenxian, Leiyang, Yongxing, and other counties, all suffered repeated losses. Although other counties were not occupied, the Red Bandits gathered and their poison spread throughout the four borders. Only because Changsha is the capital city, once it was occupied, the reports in the newspapers were so shocking and appalling that everyone was moved and frightened. Recently, floods have caused disasters. Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Hengshan, Chaling, Changde, Huarong, Shupu, Yuanjiang,</p>
<p>Qianyang, Luxi, and more than ten other counties have all been turned into swamps. The areas along the lake and the river are flooded, the rice seedlings are submerged, and the autumn harvest is in danger. The situation is on the verge of despair. The victims are everywhere, numbering more than one million, which is even worse than the drought in Qin and Long. Kan Shi and others are all from Hunan and have the heart to save those in distress. They have made a desperate plea and organized the Hunan Disaster Relief Association, which was established on the 8th of this month. However, the disaster in Hunan is so severe, and the Red atmosphere is still strong. We are afraid that the fleeing victims will have no way to save the dead and will take risks, which may lead to the formation of gangs and be used by the bandits. Then, a great disaster will be brewed, and the harm will be indescribable. The three Xiang heavens will soon be devastated. Thinking of this makes us shudder. We believe that you, sirs, are benevolent and love the people and cover everything without omission. We pray that you will remember that the disaster in Hunan is unprecedented in hundreds of years and is only seen in more than twenty provinces. We beseech you to raise huge sums of money and send them to Hunan as soon as possible to save the people who are left to die. Then, the masses who are on the verge of death will be able to bathe in the benevolence and benefit of heaven and see the sun again and obtain salvation. This is what the 30 million people of Hunan are eagerly looking forward to, gratefully remembering your boundless kindness. The telegram is urgent. We await your reply with anticipation. Respectfully submitted by the directors of the Hunan Disaster Relief Association, Su Kan Shi, Xiao Du, Hu Yiru, Wei Zhenbang, Fang Kegang, Shu Lijiang, Chen Jieshi, Qiu Weizhen, Chen Binsheng, and Pi Zongrang.</p>
<p>▲ Report from the Provincial Relief Association: The Provincial Relief Association reported to the Central Relief Committee, saying, "Hunan Province has been plagued by natural and man-made disasters in recent years. The people left after the catastrophe are suffering and displaced. They are wandering and have not been settled. Unfortunately, in May of this year, there was continuous rain for ten days, and mountain torrents broke out, rolling down the mountains and overturning stones and sand, flowing for dozens or hundreds of miles, causing Xiangxiang, Xiangtan, Hengshan, Hengyang, Chaling, Anren, Pingjiang, Luxi, and other counties to have their fields and crops washed away, houses destroyed, and utensils washed away, with property losses of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. The number of people drowned is also in the hundreds in each county.</p>
<p>The Dongting Lake in the lower reaches of the Han River is flooded, and the water level is rising, competing with the embankments for height. The fields in the counties along the lake, such as Yuanjiang, Hanshou, Xiangyin, Yiyang, Nanxian, Huarong, Anxiang, Changde, Yueyang, and Linxiang, are blocked by the lake water outside the embankments, causing waterlogging and crop failure. The autumn harvest is hopeless. The counties have suffered such a catastrophe, and the people are crying everywhere, waiting to be fed. Requests for relief and reports of disasters are pouring in. In the past, the relief funds of this association relied on the additional tax on the unified tax of Hunan Province. Since the abolition of the tax on New Year's Day this year, the source of funds has been cut off, and the treasury is empty. It is difficult to cope. In addition to sending personnel to investigate in different ways, we hereby submit a report to the Committee, requesting the allocation of huge sums of money to save the victims. We are anxiously awaiting your orders." (June 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Korean Chinese Laborers Eagerly Seek Self-Defense <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲ Establishment of the Chinese Labor Protection Association Andong Correspondence: In recent years, many laborers from the Eastern Provinces, such as carpenters, stonemasons, and coolies, have crossed the river to seek food in the interior of Korea. There are also farmers from the eastern border area who go to the deep mountains and dense forests of western Korea every spring and summer to raise tussah silkworms and make huge profits. The climate along the river in western Korea is suitable for raising silkworms. Korean farmers still adhere to the old methods and do not know how to improve them, so the results of raising silkworms are poor. Therefore, Chinese farmers are needed to raise them on their behalf, and the profits are divided equally. According to statistics, there are many Chinese laborers in the interior of Korea, but the exact number cannot be investigated. However, our country's laborers have no organization and are often bullied by Koreans. Recently, there have been incidents of expelling Chinese laborers along the Gyeongui Railway and at Gaeseong Station. Fortunately, the scope has not been expanded, and it has been stopped by the authorities and has been quelled. Recently, Chinese laborers in Korea, in view of the repeated oppression by the Korean people and their unbearable situation, want to resist but are isolated and helpless. Although there are Chinese consuls and consulates in places such as Seoul, Zhennampo, Pyongyang, and Sinuiju to protect the lives and property of Chinese citizens, the area is vast, and there are also the difficulties of being too far away to help. Therefore, the Chinese in Pyongyang and Seoul, together with many like-minded people, initiated the establishment of a labor protection association to protect the Chinese laborers in Korea by themselves. They have already prepared everything and requested the consulate to register it and name it the Chinese Labor Protection Association. A general association will be temporarily established in Seoul, and a branch association will be established in Pyongyang. It will also be gradually expanded to other major cities. The method is that all members who join the association will pay a membership fee of three Japanese coins per month, and each person will be issued a membership card. It is also heard that the Pyongyang branch has hired two Japanese directors with monthly salaries of more than 100 yuan each, who specialize in foreign affairs. On Saturday and Sunday evenings, there will be a lecture once a week. All Chinese laborers there can join the association and listen to the lectures at will, so as to increase the knowledge of Chinese laborers. If it can be handled properly and the organization is strong in the future, it will be a great guarantee for Chinese laborers. (June 14th)</p>

<p>Trial and Sentencing for Beating a Salt Police Officer to Death Chen Jinsheng, a patrol officer of the Songchang Salt Affairs Land and Water Patrol Bureau, was previously on sentry duty in the Zhuanghongkou area when he was beaten and killed by local salt smugglers. The county government has already appointed Xu, a trial officer, to go to examine the body and confirm that the death was caused by injuries sustained during his lifetime. The murderer, Zhu Fusheng, has been arrested and brought to the county by the bureau. Therefore, a court was specially opened yesterday to hear the case.</p>
<p>He confessed to the murder and admitted to beating Chen to death. According to the testimony of witness Li Guangyun, on the 9th of this month, at 3:00 p.m., he and the deceased Chen police were ordered to go to Zhuanghongkou to stand guard. Chen saw a load of smuggled goods in front and immediately went to arrest them. Unexpectedly, the smuggler took advantage of his unpreparedness and struck him on the head with a carrying pole, causing serious injuries. Later, Shen Qianxing, a gardener at the Wei Garden, and Ma Xiaolou and others heard the news and came to help. They caught the murderer together. As for Chen police, due to his serious injuries, he died in the bureau at 11:00 a.m. on the 10th before he could be treated. Now that the evidence from both sides is conclusive, Xu, the trial officer, immediately detained the criminal for sentencing.</p>
<p>Reorganization and Establishment of the Food Management Committee The county government is now reorganizing the Warehouse Management Committee into the Fengxian Food Management Committee in accordance with provincial orders. It has also added Cheng Weiyu and Gu Ren'an, two executive committee members of the former Zhuanghang Chamber of Commerce, to comply with the law.</p>

<p>sued his nephew, Zhu Songhua, to the county government over a dispute over land property. After several summons and trials, the case was not decided due to its complexity. Recently, due to a minor matter,</p>
<p>the two sides filed charges against each other at the First Public Security Branch, but no judgment was made. Zhu Houfeng, out of shame and anger, harbored the idea of ending his life. On the night of the 16th, he went to a tree in front of Zhu Songhua's house and hanged himself. By the time someone saw him in the morning, he was already dead. They immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau and then to the county government. On the afternoon of the 17th, County Chief Tu, along with Trial Officer Huang, went to examine the body and ordered that the case be investigated.</p>

<p>Cocoon Merchants Provide Assistance to Local Fees Following the central government's abolition of the cocoon tax,</p>
<p>all local autonomy fees, etc., collected with the dry cocoons have no source.</p>
<p>The county government previously telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that cocoon merchants be ordered to continue providing assistance as usual, following the example of Zhejiang Province. The provincial government then consulted the Zhejiang Provincial Government by telegram.</p>
<p>The reply was received, stating that the original assistance to local funds from cocoon merchants was not in the nature of a Likin tax and was related to various local undertakings. It should still be provided by the merchants as usual to maintain them. The county government of Wuxi received the telegram and has already notified all cocoon merchants.</p>
<p>The Sock Industry Labor-Capital Dispute Expands The sock industry labor-capital dispute in this county</p>
<p>has been dragging on for three months. Although the county government has repeatedly ordered both sides to abide by the agreement, the capital's attitude is adamant, causing a general workers</p>
<p>to repeatedly petition the party and government authorities. Yesterday was the day for Zhonghua Sock Factory to pay wages again. Worker Fang Xue specially invited union members to supervise. However, when the factory paid the wages, it still did not comply with the agreement. Therefore, the workers questioned them. Jin Zhaolin and others, members of the union's standing committee, were afraid of a dispute and immediately persuaded the workers. On one hand, they asked Factory Owner Ge Ziqi to go to the county for instructions in order to resolve the issue. However, Ge Ziqi expressed his unwillingness, and a dispute arose between the two sides. The police officer at the post reported it and took them to the Fourth Public Security Branch and sent them to the General Bureau. Section Chief Wang opened a court to hear the case. Since the matter had been mediated by the county government, he ordered both parties to wait quietly for the handling. The workers were extremely angry after hearing this news. More than 300 workers from the factory gathered at the General Labor Union to hold a temporary meeting to discuss how to deal with the situation.

<p>Summary of Three Robbery Cases: Dabeizi Bridge in Dongtang City, Hengtang District, is a crucial thoroughfare on the Kun-Chang shipping route. Only forty-odd households reside there. Li Shouren, the village head, also practices traditional Chinese medicine. On the 14th of this month, he received 300 silver dollars. The following night, around 1:30 AM, thirty to forty bandits suddenly broke in and robbed his house. The robbers spoke with a Hubei accent and were armed with flashlights and guns. After robbing Li's house, they searched and robbed the homes of neighbors Li Yulin, Li Aying, and Li Ada, each losing about one to two hundred dollars. Li Shouren suffered the greatest loss, with over six hundred silver dollars, three gold rings, two pairs of gold bracelets, forty-odd pieces of clothing, two boxes of cotton cloth, five cotton quilts, a jar of salted fish, eight chickens, and a Western-style stove stolen. The search and robbery lasted for two hours before they fled fully loaded. Furthermore, in Xiejiaqiao Dongzhuanggang area, Jiuzhe District, there was a Ding Gen who died early, leaving behind a wife and daughter. However, their residence was in a desolate place with no neighbors. The night before last, five or six bandits suddenly arrived armed with pistols, broke down the door, restrained Mrs. Luo, and beat her with clubs. As a result, they were robbed of seven silver dollars, five pieces of foreign cloth clothing, and one pair of gold bracelets before leaving. Also, in Qixingqiao Niujiaweng, a place more than ten li outside Xiaodongmen, on the 16th, farmers reported banditry to the police, and six families, including Ji Shihe, Xu Genshou, Ji Jinsheng, Ji Jingen, Xu Genquan, and Ji Maomao, were robbed one after another. The loss of Ji Shihe's family was the greatest. Ji Jinsheng was seriously injured by the bandits. The villagers were intimidated and dared not report to the county government.</p>

<p>Expansion of Land Dispute in the Third District: The charted land in the former Lujia Hamlets of the Third District of this county amounts to about six to seven hundred mu. Since it was recovered from the hands of the village secretary in the second year of the Republic, it has been controlled by local despots in a series of transfers. No report has been made for eighteen years. Former District Head Yang Huai once submitted a resolution to the district affairs meeting and presented it to the county government's Department of Civil Affairs for approval to be reclaimed for the district. However, some township heads, secretly influenced and utilized, opposed it, leading to years of disputes. It is now heard that at the 21st District Head Meeting, it was decided that the charted land was of the same nature as the charted land currently managed by various districts. If measures are not taken to correct this, it will inevitably affect other districts, leading them to follow suit. This is a cause for concern for the future of local autonomy. It was decided that the ten district heads would jointly submit a report to the provincial authorities for review and approval.</p>

<p>Finance Department Urges Collection of Business Tax: Jiangsu Province is actively implementing the business tax. However, merchants are strongly arguing for a lower tax rate, making collection extremely difficult. Yesterday, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance issued a special order to the business tax collection bureaus of various counties, instructing them to collect and remit the taxes for April, May, and June within this month. The full text is recorded below: "It has been found that the Business Tax Law has been promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, and the business tax in this province should be levied as soon as possible without further delay. Now, I, the Director of this Department, based on the annual budget and considering the circumstances of each county, have tentatively determined the quota and submitted it to the 407th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee for discussion and approval, and the Provincial Government has ordered compliance, etc. In addition to distributing this, we hereby transcribe the original proposal and quota table to instruct the Director of the Bureau to comply with the prescribed quota, gradually investigate and squeeze, and earnestly collect the tax. All households that have previously reported inaccurately should also suspend the verification of books and records, conduct a detailed review, make accurate estimates, and submit a form for verification. Future collection procedures are stipulated to be collected quarterly. All collections for the first quarter from April to June should be collected and reported by the end of the month. Those who pay beyond the deadline will be dealt with in accordance with the penalty regulations, etc."</p>
<p>The Case of the Party Committee Falsely Accusing Comrades Opened Yesterday: Chen Shixian, Shi Shunyuan, Feng Guozhen, and others, former members of the Nanhui County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, were investigated by the Provincial Party Headquarters and handed over to the Zhenjiang Court for handling due to privately engraving seals and falsely accusing comrades. Yesterday was the date for the court trial. It was heard that the court had issued more than ten subpoenas in advance, but only two witnesses, Chu Dongsheng and Zhang Xingsheng, reported yesterday. Chen Shixian and others were afraid of being punished and avoided appearing in court. They also planned to apply to the High Court for a transfer of jurisdiction in the hope of getting off scot-free.</p>
<p>The Murderer in the Jiang Buzhou Case Has Been Found: Jiang Buzhou, who lived in Baota Lane and ran a small restaurant, was shot and killed near the Dongyue Temple. The Sixth Public Security Bureau has successively arrested eight important suspects, including Li Shicai. After a brief interrogation, they were transferred to the Public Security Bureau. It is now learned that Jin Lunyuan, the section chief of the Judicial Section of the bureau, believed that the case involved murder with a gun and was of great importance. If he did not pay attention to the investigation, the truth would be difficult to determine. He conducted separate interrogations for days, using the testimony of one to corroborate the other. The suspects finally confessed the truth. The masterminds of the case were Zhang Zihuan and Li Shicai, and the perpetrator was Zhang Fengqi, who fired five shots that day. After the Public Security Bureau obtained the confession, it planned to send them to the Security Office for review today.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Borrows Money to Pay Salaries: The Provincial Government owed a large amount of salaries to the security teams of the Security Office and borrowed money from the Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Wu County chambers of commerce to alleviate the urgent need. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce has agreed to borrow 60,000 yuan, which will be advanced by the silver and money industry and guaranteed by various industries. The province will allow the business tax and grain transport tax of Zhenjiang as collateral.</p>
<p>Record of the Trial of Wang Shouyin for Neglect of Duty and Abuse of Power: Wang Shouyin, the former county police captain stationed in Baoyan Town, was reported for investigating and seizing opium in the house of Zhang Bao and privately releasing the suspect on bail without reporting the case, and was dismissed from his post and transferred to the court for investigation.</p>
<p>The criminal court filed a lawsuit, and it was heard that the case was publicly debated at 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>At that time, Judge Zhou of the Criminal Court presided over the trial in the Fourth Court and brought Wang Shouyin to court for interrogation. Witnesses Zhao Changkun and Yu Cuixing were also summoned to court for questioning. Yu was first summoned to court and testified that Wang was rarely at home and often away. Although he had heard about the opium case of Zhang Bao, he had not witnessed it. Wang and Zhao had never gambled together in people's homes. Once in March, they only watched a few cards and dispersed. Then Zhao Changkun testified that when investigating opium in Zhang Bao's house, he heard from outside the door that opium was found on the stove, but he did not witness it. He never gambled and did not know Cui Yuxing, etc.</p>
<p>Then Wang Shouyin was summoned to court and testified that the investigation and seizure of opium in Zhang's house was not his own decision, but that his subordinates had arrested the suspect, and he could not but question her. Later, because the suspect was seriously ill, she was released on bail. At that time, because the suppression of bandits and defense duties were tight, he did not report the case in time and only reported it after being transferred to the city. The procedure was wrong, and he requested a review. He himself did not gamble. The court rebuked him for not reporting to the court at that time, which inevitably made it appear that he was untruthful and incomplete. Wang stammered in response. Later, Prosecutor Zhu came to the court to make his arguments, and the court announced the end of the debate. Wang then requested bail, and Judge Zhong instructed that the case had been concluded and there was no need for bail. He could wait for the judgment and then review it. Then he announced that the case would be sentenced at 2:00 PM on the 23rd of this month. Wang was still returned to custody, and Zhao was released on his original bail.</p>
<p>Yu was ordered to return and leave the court.</p>

<p>Request to Waive Feast Tax Denied: The restaurant industry in the county has petitioned the provincial government, requesting that the education bureau stop collecting the feast tax, arguing that it hinders business.</p>
<p>The provincial government investigated and found that many counties have already implemented the feast tax, with most tax rates being 5%. The regulations in Nantong only collect 3%, which is already lighter than other counties. It is not appropriate to grant an exemption, as it would hinder educational funding. It has specially ordered the county government to instruct the restaurant industry to pay the tax in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Establishment of Temporary Court Pending: The county government previously received an order from the province regarding the trial of counter-revolutionary criminals, requiring the establishment of a temporary court.

<p>Urging Repayment of Rice Borer Eradication Loan: In Jiaxing during the 13th year of the Republic, the rice borer infestation was severe, and there were insufficient funds for eradication. The former county council resolved that the former magistrate, Li Shouci, should forward a request for a provincial loan of 10,000 yuan for use, and the 10% reduction in the provincial tax under the compensation fund was changed to the county's rice borer eradication expenses to be collected and repaid. The province approved the plan. However, the funds have not yet been returned to the provincial treasury. The Department of Finance investigated and found that Jiaxing County has insect control funds, in addition to the 10% rice borer eradication bond fund, and has been collecting two dimes of silver for insect control.</p>
<p>It has been several years and it is expected that the loan can be repaid. Yesterday, the county was ordered to strictly urge the Rice Borer Eradication Association to promptly allocate and repay the aforementioned reserve funds to the treasury, in order to value public funds.</p>

<p>Announces Selection of Archeology Award Recipient ▲ Winner: Pei Wenzhong – Annual Meeting Changed to Zhenjiang: The China Science Society established the Archeology Award starting in the 19th year, with an annual gold medal and a cash prize of 100 yuan. The award committee recommends one person with the best archeological research results in the country to the board of directors for the award. The award for the 19th year has been agreed upon by the committee members Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, and Zhang Zhao to be given to Pei Wenzhong. The 95th board meeting of the society has approved this. Mr. Pei's work achievements are published as follows: Pei Wenzhong joined the Zhoukoudian fossil collection organized by the Geological Survey in the 17th year of the Republic. In the 18th year, Mr. Pei independently took charge of this excavation work, continuing until the summer of the 19th year. During this work period, Mr. Pei discovered many valuable fossils. Now, Bu Dasheng, Yang Zhongjian, and Mr. Pei are separately studying various fossils. What is particularly praised by the world is the Peking Man fossil.</p>
<p>In addition to fragmented teeth, a fairly complete Peking Man skull was discovered on December 2, 18. In July of the 19th year, another Peking Man skull collected in October of the 18th year was found while sorting materials. This skull is not only more complete than the Java Man, but also an important material for studying the bones of early humans. At the same time, a large number of other animal fossils were completely preserved, which confirmed that they lived at the same time as Peking Man. Unlike the Java fossils, which were from the alluvial era, the study of these animal fossils can determine the geological age more accurately than that of any other hominid fossil found elsewhere. Mr. Pei also participated in the study of this paleontology. Some of it can be published now. Mr. Pei's rare discoveries, large-scale excavation work, and existing research work have been recognized by other specialists and praised by the world's academic community. All should receive considerable encouragement from the Chinese academic community.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Shanghai Municipality Inquires About How to Connect Large, Medium, and Small School Admissions: The Ministry of Education previously received a report from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education stating that the city's private secondary schools mostly adopt a dual-track system for student admission, with both spring and autumn semester classes. However, the city's private universities only have autumn semester classes, making it difficult for spring graduates to find immediate opportunities for further education. It is proposed that the bureau transfer the matter to the universities, devising ways to increase the convenience for spring graduates of Shanghai's secondary schools to enter universities. The Ministry has examined the university regulations issued by the Ministry and the revision of Article 14 of Chapter 4 of the specialized school regulations, stipulating that entrance examinations should be held at the beginning of each academic year. Therefore, students entering specialized schools and above should begin in the fall. Also, the provisional regulations for primary and secondary schools promulgated by the former University Council do not explicitly stipulate the beginning of the academic year, but the beginning of the academic year and the regulations of the school calendar all start in the fall. It is an exception for schools to start in the spring. However, it is a long-standing habit among the people in various places to send their young children to primary school in early spring. Therefore, primary schools have a dual-track system of starting in spring and autumn, which is also followed by private secondary schools, which are motivated to enroll more students. Therefore, there is no problem in connecting the timing of graduating from primary school and entering secondary school, <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>However, the timing of graduating from secondary school and entering specialized schools and above cannot be connected due to regulations, resulting in difficulties. Now, according to the requests of the private secondary schools, it seems that it is necessary to connect the timing of admission to large, medium, and small schools in the future. However, the bureau did not dare to make a decision on its own, whether to follow the people's habits and have universities add spring semester classes, or to strictly order primary and secondary schools to restrict the enrollment of spring semester students, and submitted a report for review. The Ministry of Education instructed that the spring semester classes in primary and secondary schools are intended to add classes, expand enrollment, and save repeating time for repeaters, not specifically to seek convenience for those seeking further education. The bureau believes that because specialized schools and above mostly start in the fall, spring graduates of secondary schools have difficulty entering school and proposes to restrict primary and secondary schools from enrolling spring semester students. This is difficult to approve. As for universities, if they are economically well-off, they can add spring semester classes, but there is no need to issue a general order for uniform implementation. Let it be known.</p>

<p>Distribution of Ten Drops of Water to Subordinate Rural Institutions The City Bureau of Education approved the Health Bureau's letter requesting the distribution of 500 bottles of Ten Drops Water medicine, stating that regardless of the type of Ten Drops Water, it can only be used as a temporary medicine for heatstroke and has no effect on preventing or treating severe illnesses such as cholera. For cholera prevention, it is still necessary to get cholera vaccinations and pay attention to food hygiene, etc. Since schools in the Shanghai South and Zhabei districts can easily purchase such medicine, the Bureau of Education distributed this medicine to subordinate rural schools and public education centers for their use. Schools and centers can pick them up at any time.</p>

<p>Davis Cup ▲ England and Czechoslovakia in the European Zone Finals ▲ Inter-Zone Finals in the Americas and Europe The World Tennis Davis Cup competition has been fought among dozens of countries around the world, with victories and defeats leading to the current situation where only three or four remain. The final stage of close combat has arrived. Recent news indicates that England and Czechoslovakia have won the rights to the European Zone finals, which will be held soon, to compete with the United States for the right to battle France for the cup. The situation of each side is described below:</p>
<p>▲ Japan Still Lacking This year, the Japanese Davis Cup team was affected by the retirement of Harada. The only hope lies with Satoh Jiro out of the three most promising players, Satoh Jiro, Satoh Hyotaro, and Kawachi. Therefore, even though they were triumphant in the first, second, third, and fourth weeks of the initial rounds,</p>
<p>after the semi-finals, they lost all five matches to England. Satoh Jiro also lost to England's Perry by a score of 3-1, demonstrating that world tennis is beyond our comprehension.</p>
<p>▲ England Hopeful The most highly touted team to battle France this year is England. New forces such as Perry and Hughes have risen, and they are formidable. Hughes defeated French tennis king Cochet at the French Open, and England's track record in previous matches has been the best. Therefore, there is reason to believe that they can defeat the United States. The team's lineup consists of Perry and Austin for singles, and Perry and Hughes for doubles.</p>
<p>▲ Czechoslovakia's Rise Czechoslovakia has caused a sensation in Europe this year, rising suddenly and achieving resounding victories. Italy, the champion team of the European Zone last year, was defeated by Czechoslovakia, and the right to the European Zone finals was assured. News has arrived that they have eliminated Denmark by a score of 3-0 and will face England in the finals.</p>
<p>The results of the three matches between Denmark and Czechoslovakia are as follows:</p>
<p>Mencl (Czechoslovakia) ...3-0... Ulrich (Denmark) Hecht (Czechoslovakia) ...3-2... Henriksen (Denmark)</p>
<p>Mencl (Czechoslovakia) (8-6 1-6 6-3 6-0) Ulrich and Holm (Denmark)</p>

<h3 id="e115">A Thought <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Holding Buddha</p>
<p>▲ Beauties are endowed with the essence of heaven and earth, so it is not easy to find them. Just like a masterpiece of writing, it may not come from the hand of someone with a great reputation. Therefore, in a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters, there may be extraordinary beauties that are unmatched in the city.</p>
<p>▲ Planting famous flowers in cow dung is more aesthetically offensive than burning a zither and cooking a crane.</p>
<p>▲ Mirrors are the confidantes of beauties, lamps are their good companions, and flowers are their reflections.</p>
<p>▲ Women who engage in carnal life on the sea often support their parents and raise their younger siblings. The act is shameful, but the intention is pitiful. Those who are seven feet tall and cannot fulfill their filial duties should be ashamed to die.</p>
<p>▲ Prostitutes may not want to be prostitutes. The reason why they eventually fall and cannot extricate themselves is often the encirclement of the procuress. The same is true for military men who are surrounded by politicians.</p>
<p>▲ The magic power of the eyes to colors and the ears to sounds is ultimately inferior to "touch". This is because the eyes and ears still belong to the six senses, while touch goes directly into the eight consciousness fields. The Romance of the Western Chamber says, "A little numbness comes on." Is this the reason?</p>
<p>▲ Westerners wrote a novel called "The World Cannibal Club", which roughly says that a train was trapped in the ice and snow of Siberia. When the food was exhausted, cannibalism was practiced. Later, someone made an experiential statement, saying, "Men's meat is as hard as iron, and women's meat is as soft as cotton." In fact, men's and women's meat are equally soft and hard. This is because even in this desperate situation, a little lust has not been extinguished.</p>
<p>▲ It is easier for women to become famous than men. The same is true for monks.</p>
<h3 id="e116">A Record of the Secret Tribunal <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Fei</p>
<p>During the thirteenth century, there were more than three hundred small states standing along the Rhine River in Germany. Politics were neglected and laws differed. Murder and robbery were seen everywhere at any time. However, the Germans were inherently strong and chivalrous, so they secretly organized secret tribunals, Vehm or Fehm, as a means of self-defense. It became popular throughout Germany for a time. Two centuries later, the Holy Roman Emperor, the seven electors, and the archbishops once took it as an honor to兼get security.</p>
<p>The origin of the secret tribunal in Europe is not recorded in Western history. It flourished in the thirteenth century. It first issued a warrant to the offender who could not be dealt with by the law, ordering him to be tried at a certain place on a certain day. The conviction was determined by one trial. It was either capital punishment or freedom. There were only these two ways. If the person did not arrive after receiving the warrant, the secret tribunal sent an officer to arrest him. One out of a hundred could escape. If three people in the court encountered a murderer, they should put the murderer to death without waiting for the court's judgment. The four letters S·S·G·G were written on the wood. People knew that it was done by the people in the secret tribunal and dared not investigate.</p>
<p>In the beginning, it eliminated violence and maintained peace, forced the strong to restrain themselves, and the social order was quite sufficient to maintain for a while. Later, it was used to retaliate for grudges, and the abuse was excessive, and its style declined.</p>
<h3 id="e117">One Day on Dragon Pond Mountain <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>I have long heard that the scenery of Longtan Mountain in Liyang is extraordinary. It is even better than the West Lake in Hangzhou. A few days ago, I made an appointment with my friends Liu Youxian and Jin Binglan, as well as my wife and daughter, and five or six other people to take a boat to visit. The mountain is located in the south of Liyang City, more than forty miles away from the city, passing through Daibu Town. From the town upwards, the road is surrounded by pine and bamboo, the stream flows under your feet, mountain flowers are scattered, and wild birds compete to fly, making people feel like they are entering a paradise. After advancing a few more miles, there are overlapping mountains, and streams of water fly from the stones. Only the sound of water can be heard. We sat on the stones for a while, and suddenly saw a woodcutter carrying firewood on his shoulders from the green shade. We immediately asked him what ancient sites were on Longtan Mountain. The woodcutter replied, "A few miles away is the Longtan Temple newly built by Zen Master Kangdian. There is also the place where Immortal He practiced alchemy, the Alchemy Well, the Alchemy Stove, and the place where the great Confucian scholar Chen Bianruo of the late Ming Dynasty lived in seclusion. There are cliffs for several miles, and waterfalls cascade down. Further into the south of Longshan Mountain, hundreds of acres of plum blossoms are in full bloom. There is a small village in the middle where you can ask for tea to quench your thirst. Further up for about a mile, there is a Fairy Stone Cave, which can be entered with a candle." After the woodcutter finished speaking, he carried his firewood and left. We passed through a bamboo path and over a small stream, and saw the temple towering on the mountainside. We quickly went straight up along the small path among the pines and passed another stream to reach Longtan Temple. Entering the temple, we saw the solemn Buddha statues and the simple furnishings, but we did not see a monk in the temple for a long time. Only in the deep valley south of the temple, there was an old man, over sixty years old, wearing a bamboo hat and straw shoes, carrying a bamboo stick in his hand, leaning on the right side of the peach blossom stone dock, his eyes shining, as if a dharma light was radiating outward. We turned around the stone wall, stepped forward to salute, and asked if there was a great monk in the temple. The old man replied, "Where did the great laymen come from? I am the monk Kangdian." He then invited us into the temple, drew water from Longtan Spring, and cooked wild mountain tea, which tasted fragrant and sweet. Then he served us with coarse rice, wild vegetables, and vegetable roots. After we had eaten our fill, Kangdian laughed and said, "If you can put such coarse rice and vegetable roots into your belly, you are not lacking in good roots." I heard that Kangdian was familiar with Mr. Shi Liangcai and Mr. Wang Yiting in Shanghai, and he liked to chant and was good at calligraphy. The plaque of the Maitreya Pavilion in Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou was written by him. I asked for a couplet, which said, "Pond fish know the nature of water, wild birds are pleased with the fragrance of flowers." The brushwork is vigorous and worthy of treasure. Kangdian recently traveled between Six Bridges and Three Tianzhu Temples and moored his boat by the lake of Jingci Temple. He has a poem that says: "Deep in the lotus flowers, I drink the fragrance. It doesn't hurt to recite Amitabha. The breeze rolls up the ripples without vulgarity. The red dust is far away from the land of clouds and water." He also inscribed a poem on the stone railing of the Great Buddha Temple, saying: "Once again a bell rings in the old trees. The six bridges roll the setting sun red. Enthusiastically purify the land beyond the mundane. Cold-faced West Lake laughs at the drunken old man." After we finished our tour, Kangdian happily saw us off for several miles. His enthusiasm was touching. We then arrived at a small village and rested at a farmer's house. The old farmer offered fragrant tea as a treat. I asked about Kangdian's background. The old farmer replied, "Kangdian was a Hanlin scholar in the Qing Dynasty. He once served as a military commander and was also the editor of the Hubei Qunbao. Because of the constant turmoil in the country in recent years, he was disheartened and became a monk to live in seclusion here." The next day, we returned to Shanghai and recorded it to leave a mark.</p>

<p>Watching Xun Huisheng's performance of the literary meeting is like Yun Nantian setting the colors of peach blossoms in the daytime. The emotions are enchanting, but the hairpin phoenix drama is like a sprig of autumn begonia. It is the blood in the eyes of a thoughtful woman.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Notes on Reading Paintings in the Art Garden <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Too Thin Student</p>
<p>My friends Ma Wanli, Wu Ziding, and Zhao Banbo have been immersed in poetry, books, and paintings day and night. From the 13th, they jointly held a painting exhibition for three days at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Tibet Road. I went there with He Tianjian and was already intoxicated in the Wushuang Studio, so I drove to visit again. I felt that the walls were full of exquisite paintings and colorful clouds were fluttering. The air of worldliness was washed away from there.</p>
<p>Wanli loved art since he was a child. His family was rich in collections, and he spent all day flipping through them, so he gained a unique understanding. Painting is a reflection of character. With Wanli's pure talent and transcendence, his paintings are light, distant, precipitous, and free from worldliness. He imitated Tianchi Fudao in his paintings, but they are sweet and rich. His painting of morning glories is a unique expression of spirituality. The colors are rich and moist, and the interests are full and round. Tianjian wrote a poem while drunk, saying: "The painted morning glories are not fragrant. Pan Lang wants to break his nine-turned intestines. The Weaver Girl's cloud brocade is left in vain. How can it be helped that the days and months in the world are long?" It is said that Wanli recently wrote an elegy for his deceased wife. This painting and this poem express deep feelings. It is said that Wanli's wife, Ms. Tang Meiqian, was also good at art. Now she has gone to the jade palace, leaving only long sighs. Ziding was a student in Xiuning and served as an official in all directions. He was skilled in meticulous figure painting, especially similar to Gai Qixiang. In his later years, he regained the charm of Wen Zhengming and Tang Yin and was praised by the art world. Among the paintings on display, the two paintings "When the Autumn Wind is Clear and the Geese Come" and "Sitting Late in the Maple Forest" were the most outstanding. As for Mr. Zhao Banbo, it is a good story in the art world that he, an old man in his seventies, is fond of this and never tires of it. Banbo began to learn painting after the age of fifty. The gnarled roots and intertwined branches have the flavor of Bada Shanren. Recently, he has also participated in the divine posture of Bai Yang and Xin Luo. The bone charm of Dong Xin's jade table makes it feel more elegant and unrestrained. However, he is clumsy in being an official and does not live in a rich place. He relies on painting to comfort himself. It is said that Banbo retired to painting with the talent of a law-abiding official. His paintings are rich in poetic meaning, and the pen and paintings are full of flavor. (Thanks for the reward)</p>

<p>— Master of the Plum Blossom Hall</p>
<p>Du Liyun, a talented student of Wang Yaoqing, had already gained a great reputation in Beijing and Tianjin. This time, she came to Jinan from Beijing, hired by the National Grand Theater. Before taking the stage, she first performed a court opera for one night at the Provincial Government. The opera was "Su San Escorting." Central Committee members Shao Lizi and Jiang Bocheng, as well as Chairman Han, Finance Director Wang, Chief Commander Ma, and others, were all in attendance. They praised her performance highly. After the opera, each of the dignitaries presented her with a large silver shield as a token of appreciation. It can be imagined that Liyun was both flattered and surprised by this generous gift. Since her performance at the National Grand Theater, every show has been sold out. Various members of the Provincial Government and military dignitaries have also been reserving seats to show their support. Such a grand occasion is unprecedented in the history of the Peking opera world.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Research on Famine Relief Foods (Part 1) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Xiang Shanxing states that the various famine relief methods recorded in the newly compiled "Verified Formulas" are quite simple and easy to implement. However, he has doubts about whether they are beneficial or harmless to human physiology. Xu has reviewed the first formula, which consists of three sheng of glutinous rice and three sheng of sesame seeds. Each is washed clean with water and stir-fried over low heat. First, grind the glutinous rice into flour, then add the sesame seeds and grind them together into a powder. Then, use three jin of red dates, boil them until soft, remove the skin and pits, and mash them into a paste. Mix the paste with the powder and form into pills, each weighing five qian. Eat one pill daily, chased down with boiling water, to alleviate hunger. If glutinous rice and red dates are unavailable, japonica rice and black dates can be used instead. This formula is essentially the "er su" crisps made in the Hangzhou nunneries, but instead of being made into pills, they are made into bite-sized crisps. They are extremely fragrant and delicious and require chewing. Eating only two such crisps can quell hunger for four hours, with each crisp weighing approximately four qian. However, eating too many can cause chest tightness and discomfort, so it is best to chew them slowly, accompanied by tea. My family has often made this as food and it is nothing new. According to human physiology and hygiene, the daily nutritional requirements for an average laborer are 130 to 150 grams of protein, 84 grams of fat, 404 grams of starch, 2800 grams of water, and 30 grams of salt. Protein is vitamin A, a nitrogenous substance. One jin of ordinary rice contains only 36 grams of protein, while one jin of glutinous rice contains 84 grams. One jin of sesame seeds contains more than 123 grams. Therefore, one sheng of sesame seeds is equivalent to three and a half sheng of ordinary rice, and one sheng of glutinous rice is equivalent to two and a half sheng of ordinary rice. The methods of the ancients are indeed in line with reason and chemistry. Their ability to investigate things and pursue principles has reached its peak, but it is simply not noticed through familiarity. A comparison table is listed below, with the content of 600 grams (16 taels) as the standard:</p>
<p>Ingredient　Protein　Fat　Water　Carbohydrate　Notes</p>
<p>Rice　36 grams　12　444</p>
<p>Wheat　60　12　384　One sheng equals 1.7 sheng of rice</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice　84　39.6　456　One sheng equals 2.33 sheng of rice</p>
<p>Sesame　123.3　309.4　75.6　One sheng equals 3.5 sheng of rice</p>
<p>As can be seen from the above, glutinous rice and sesame seeds are rich in protein and can achieve more with less. However, their fat content is excessive, and gastric juices cannot fully digest them, so they should be stir-fried to evaporate the oil. The addition of jujube paste is simply to make them easy to knead and mix. Dates are beneficial for the spleen and stomach, as detailed in the "Compendium of Materia Medica." Therefore, this first formula is definitely usable.</p>
<p>The second formula states: take equal parts of chestnuts, red dates, and walnuts, all skinned, and persimmon cakes, with the stems removed. Steam for one to two hours, take them out, and mash them extremely finely in a stone mortar. Press into thick cakes, which are prepared and dried in winter for storage. One cake can last three to four days without hunger, and taking another cake after three to four days can last even longer. It is said to nourish the kidneys, strengthen the spleen, moisten the lungs, and clear the liver, but it must be chewed carefully.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>However, the policemen's guns were not usually aimed at the common people. Shooting was always the prerogative of the boss. So, the policemen, hearing the soldiers cursing, usually tolerated it, pretending they didn't hear it, and just tried their best to pull the fighting rickshaw pullers apart and take them to the district office. Zhang Xiaosan said, "Hey, patrolmen, get out of the way! Don't interfere with the rickshaw pullers. Let them fight their own battles. What's it to you?" The policemen, seeing him shouting it out loud, could no longer pretend to be deaf. They said, "We're maintaining order. We can't let them fight in the street. We're doing our duty. What's it to you?" Zhang Xiaosan said, "We'll beat you bastards! Let you see that being a 'rubber hose squad' member is nothing. There are seven or eight former 'rubber hose squad' members in this row of soldiers!" They shouted in unison, "Beat them!" And they swarmed forward, punching and kicking the three policemen, aiming everywhere. Zhang Xiaosan was especially skilled at fighting. He took off his belt and, holding one end, used it like a whip, lashing out wildly. The onlookers retreated far away, worried for the policemen. Some hooligans and wild children, however, clapped and cheered. The three policemen initially wanted to fight back, planning to grab one or two of the soldiers. But then the whole row of soldiers mobilized, and the three policemen had no choice but to turn and run, leaving two police caps behind. Zhang Xiaosan, panting, fastened his belt. He picked up a police baton and a police cap from the ground and held the baton, with the cap on top, high above his head, laughing loudly. Another soldier snatched it and threw it on the ground, laughing, "Stop it! The platoon leader is scolding us." Zhang Xiaosan puffed out his chest, tossed his head, and said, "My time in the army wasn't wasted. I finally got some satisfaction today!" He took off his military cap, wiped the sweat from his forehead with his hand, and then slammed the military cap onto his head, with the visor pointing upwards, exposing a large part of his forehead, and swaggered back to the ranks. This incident had no impact. Only the next day, a piece of social news in the newspaper reported that some people wearing grey cloth short coats had a minor conflict with the police at the entrance of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. The situation was quickly resolved. Not only was the army unit not mentioned, but even the word "soldier" was omitted. So, in addition to going to the garden for nothing and riding the tram for nothing, they now had the added benefit of beating the police for nothing.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Finance: Gold Bar Prices Fluctuate <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲Prices Eventually Fall Slightly　　▲Silver Price Outlook Remains Unchanged　　▲Fluctuations of Nine Taels: Yesterday, the 18th, the gold bar market showed minor fluctuations, with changes occurring from time to time. The total fluctuation throughout the day was nine taels, ultimately trending downwards slightly. Early in the morning, due to reports of an earthquake in Japan and the lack of any new developments in the silver market, the market opened lower. Subsequently, it fluctuated, with a rise and fall of six taels. Guangdong buyers were actively selling. However, with the exchange rate stable, the market only fluctuated by two or three taels. Initially, sellers were strong and briefly broke the 800 tael mark. Afterward, with the exchange rate remaining stable, small investors on the trading floor gradually started buying, leading to a緩和situation. In the end, it settled at 802 taels. It is predicted that the silver market may not experience any changes this morning.</p>
<p>▲Opening Low: The market opened lower by 1.8 qian at 801.5 taels early in the morning. There were no changes in large contracts and public or private telegrams regarding silver prices, indicating that the market had failed to fall the day before, leading to a bearish sentiment. Subsequently, Yuan Maoyong, Tong Taichang, Wan Xingshunli, Da Decheng, and others came in to buy, immediately driving the price up by two qian. English gold for August and September was traded around 31.25. There was no change in the announced English gold price, remaining at 0.04 taels. Subsequently, Qian Changxiang, Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Fu Yuxing Yong, and others also entered the market, further increasing the momentum, driving the price up by three qian. Additionally, Guangdong banks were settling English gold at 25 with HSBC and Huabi, so by 10:15, it reached 0.079 taels. Almost instantly, the market weakened. Various banks were selling English gold at 25, especially Yifeng Yong, who was reportedly unloading on behalf of Hengxing. Yuan Maoyong, Long Sheng, Zhifeng Yong, Tong Taichang, Fuxing Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, and others colluded to sell, causing a rapid decline and a drop of six taels, with only a one tael difference. By 11:45, it was only 0.02 taels. Subsequently, it rose by one tael, driven by Yuanxing Yong and Qian Changxiang, reaching 0.032 or 3 qian. However, sellers remained active. Yuan Maoyong and Huixiang goods and others were selling. The market closed at 0.021 taels at noon and then fell slightly by another tael, totaling only about 0.01 taels. The announced price remained at 838.2 taels, with a discount of 30 to 35 or 6 taels.</p>
<p>▲Market Eases: The afternoon market opened at 0.01 taels, then at 0.005 taels, due to a smaller opening for goods. Subsequently, due to a smaller exchange rate of one anna for Indian currency, it reached 0.015 taels. However, Yongfeng, Heng Yu, Long Sheng, and others were selling, and the English gold market was flooded, with banks buying at 31.25 to 375, resulting in weakness. Eventually, it fell to 799 taels. Soon after, Bingxing, Yifeng Yong, Yuanxing Yong, and others started buying, with Taiwanese Zhengjin and HSBC also buying. The English gold for the following month was 31.25, so at 2:30, it was 0.027 taels. Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Maoyong, and others were selling, and banks were trading September contracts at 31.25, causing another decrease of two taels. At 3:20, it fell back to 800.005 taels. Afterward, there was a fluctuation of one tael from time to time. Until 3:30, HSBC absorbed 31.25 again, especially because Long Sheng was buying on behalf of a customer, causing it to be pulled up by two qian. After 4:00, it was 0.036 taels. In an instant, Fuyu and others sold, causing a sharp drop of two taels, totaling 0.016 taels. Approaching the closing, Yuanheng and others bought in, so the market closed at 0.024 taels at 4:30, and then depreciated by 4 or 5 qian, totaling only about 2 taels. Compared to the previous day (based on the listed price), it dropped by 9 qian. The highest price for the day was 807.9 taels, and the lowest price was 799 taels, a difference of 8.9 taels. The goods market opened at 0.017 taels in the morning, closed at 1.5 taels at noon, 1 tael in the afternoon, and 2 taels at closing. The announced price had a discount of 36 or 7 taels, recorded a 0.05 taels for July, 0.02 taels for August, and a daily water supplement of 0.05 taels.</p>
<p>▲Guangdong Banks' Peculiarity: The transactions of various firms differed. Qian Changxiang, Hengxing, Fuyu, Yuanxing Yong, and Cuichang Yong were all buying. Wanxing, Shunli, Tong Taichang, Fuxing Yong, Tongchang, Yu Da, etc., had balanced buy and sell transactions, with a large number of transactions. Yuan Maoyong, Zhifeng Yong, Bingxing, Long Sheng, and Da Xingyong were all selling. Yifeng Yong sold a considerable amount, approximately 2-3,000 bars (rumored to be on behalf of Guangdong banks). Da Decheng, Yuantai, Heng Yu, Yuanchun, Futai Heng, etc., had frequent buy and sell transactions, not a small number. In the afternoon, Yuan Maoyong, Yifeng Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Bingxing, Qian Changxiang, Wanxing, Shunli, Hengxing, Yuan Kangxiang, Yuanheng, etc., all bought. Tong Taichang, Futai Heng, Yuantai, Da Decheng, Chunyuan Yong, etc., had occasional buy and sell transactions. Zhifeng Yong, Fuyu, Yongfeng were all selling. Long Sheng was selling and then buying back. Mr. Wu had frequent buy and sell transactions. Guangdong banks bought 200-300 bars, but the sell transactions were conducted through other firms, seemingly designed to obfuscate and confuse the truth. Dalian banks sold a total of over 1,000 bars and bought over 2,000 bars.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Exchange Market Quiet</p>
<p>▲Initial Transactions of 300,000 Pounds　　▲Japanese and American Exchange Rates Extremely Idle　　Yesterday, the British and American silver markets showed no changes, and the market situation was stable. However, sellers were unenthusiastic. The Shanghai market also had no special boom or bust. HSBC's listed price decreased by only 0.25 for Hong Kong, totaling 80.875, and all other areas remained unchanged. The transaction price of banks was also very stable, with only minor fluctuations. However, gold bar prices showed a difference of 8 or 9 taels, ultimately declining slightly, which was very different from the foreign exchange market. The results were similar for British and American exchange rates, while Japanese gold, although only half a point, saw active trading by Chinese merchants. It is estimated that British gold was settled by Guangdong banks such as Sheng Da for over 100,000 pounds in the morning. Fuchang and Taikang Run also sold tens of thousands of pounds. In the afternoon, various firms sold approximately 100,000 pounds. It is estimated that approximately 300,000 pounds were traded throughout the day. American gold transactions were idle, and Japanese gold transactions were also limited.</p>

<p>▲Market Overview: The financial world typically experiences a downturn during the summer months. This year, due to poor cocoon yields, foreign sales have been significantly hindered, and silver has fewer applications, resulting in a decline in silver prices. Additionally, the summer harvest in the countryside is not very plentiful, which is suppressing commercial activity. Since finance is the core of all industries, each industry naturally experiences a decline as well. Therefore, current business conditions are weakened along with the market.</p>
<p>▲Discounted Prices: (Silver Dollars) The discount price in the early market remained at 7 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, 6 hao, 2 hu, 5 si, the same as the previous afternoon. However, the afternoon market was slightly better by 3 hao, 7 hu, 5 si, at 7 qian, 2 fen, 6 li. The overall trend was mostly downward, ultimately remaining low. (Silver Futures) Both the early and afternoon markets were at 6 fen, with a premium of 4 to 5 fen, slightly lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver coins remained unchanged in both the early and afternoon markets, at 6 qian, 4 fen, 7 li, and trading was inactive. Guangdong small silver coins were at 6 qian, 4 fen, 5 li, 5 hao in the early market and 6 qian, 4 fen, 4 li, 5 hao in the afternoon market, a difference of one li. Transactions occurred, with 110,000 jiao in the early market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by another 1,500 wen, totaling 377,500 wen. Over 30,000 strings were traded.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: (Silver) Bank deposits were moderate yesterday. Chinese banks deposited over 2.8 million in banknotes. Foreign banks deposited over 1.89 million in banknotes, over 1 million in special deposits, and over 10.67 million in various goods, foreign exchange, taxes, and miscellaneous deposits. 500,000 entered the warehouse, and 300,000 exited the warehouse. Japanese banks deposited over 4.8 million in various deposits, 600,000 entered the warehouse, and money houses deposited over 48.8 million in banknotes, over 4.2 million in premium deposits, over 1.1 million in remittances, and tens of thousands in cash. (Silver Dollars) Over 1.77 million in remittances were made in the early market and over 990,000 in the afternoon market. 65,000 in banknotes were made in the early market and 30,000 in the afternoon market. 172,000 in external banknotes were made in the early market and 85,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading amounted to 720,000 in interbank transactions in the early market and 600,000 in interbank transactions in the afternoon market. Bank accounts received and released over 1.4 million in deposits, and over 1.78 million in banknotes were recovered and issued.

<h3 id="e126">Securities: Bond Prices Fall Sharply <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲1920 Customs Bond Drops by Over 1.5 Yuan　　▲Remaining Bonds Also Weak; Transactions Reach Over 19 Million: Yesterday, the bond market in Shanghai saw limited spot trading in the Disbandment Bond, while other bonds saw no trading. The futures market remained active. Trading in July contracts increased compared to previous days. The changes in each bond showed a significant decline as the market opened, falling by around one yuan, but after the initial drop, supply and demand stabilized. After this point prices remained range bound. Consequently, closing prices were much lower compared to the previous day, including 1920 Customs Bond, July and June, and 196 July and June each down 1.7 yuan, Disbandment and Troop Reduction, 20 and Customs bonds also down around one yuan. The 1996 saw still minor fluctuations.

<h3 id="e127">Yarn &amp; Cotton: Market Sees Increase in Bearish Sentiment <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>▲Cotton Yarn Market to Close for One Day on the 20th</p>
<p>The yarn market opened lower in the morning but rose in the afternoon, with the market remaining tense. The condition of foreign cotton yarn was stable, and actual sales were relatively brisk. Tianjin merchants remained active in making offers, but there was a lack of available stock, causing the prices of 16 and 20 count yarns to be exceptionally tight. The market was very firm. Business for 10 count coarse yarn was especially lacking. Japanese merchants continued to offer sales in distant months. A portion of large short sellers closed out their positions in large quantities and flipped to long positions, resulting in unusually dry trading. As a result, the market has become increasingly tight.</p>
<p>▲Speculators Cover Shorts: Pre-market opening at the exchange showed that with U.S. cotton being flat and actual sales stagnant, the market was somewhat loose, with prices falling by 6, 7, 8, and 9 qian. After the market closed in the afternoon, prices surged by 7 qian to 1.45 taels due to short covering in a market without sufficient volume. Total trading was estimated at 60,000 bales. Shenxin sold 1,350 bales, Rongxing sold 1,800 bales, Shenchang sold 1,700 bales, Yongfeng sold 5,050 bales, Senkang sold 1,850 bales, Yuantai sold 1,600 bales, and Xincheng sold 1,050 bales. Gengfeng sold 2,250 bales. Tianlong bought 3,050 bales, Taixing bought 1,250 bales, Yiyu bought 3,450 bales, Gengfeng bought 2,100 bales, and Yichang bought 2,300 bales. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>▲Quiet Sales: Actual sales of yarn were relatively quiet. Purchases made by all merchants totaled 1,540 bales, with trading firms buying 1,400 bales, and the market was firm. Merchants from Tianjin bought 1,200 bales, inland merchants bought 70 bales, Guangdong merchants bought 75 bales, Sichuan merchants bought 140 bales, and miscellaneous merchants bought 180 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Reasons for the Sudden Rise in Cotton Prices <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲Major Players Shift from Short to Long Positions… 30,000 to 40,000 Bales in Two Days Cotton market trends are firming. Although overseas cotton markets and gold prices are mediocre, the local market has seen a general shift from short to long positions by major players due to rising yarn prices. In the past two days, contract volumes have reached approximately 30,000 to 40,000 bales, resulting in a remarkably tight supply. Consequently, market prices have soared.</p>
<p>▲Hankow Standard Cotton Closes with Significant Gains The Exchange's Hankow Standard cotton market was flat in the morning, with prices falling by 1.5 to 2 cents. The market remained flat after the afternoon opening, but prices suddenly rebounded by 3 to 5 cents at the 3:00 PM closing. Total transaction volume reached 70,700 bales. Sales included 3,200 bales from Mei Kee, 1,700 bales from Rong Xing, 2,700 bales from Geng Feng, and 1,000 bales from Shen Kee. Purchases included 7,000 bales from Tian Long, 1,400 bales from Chang Feng, 1,900 bales from Yi Chang, and 1,800 bales from Yu Da. The closing prices for Hankow Standard cotton are recorded below: Hankow Standard Closing Prices (Rise/Fall) Account Balance August: 40.30 (+.25) 53,600 bales June: 39.95 (+.20) 77,500 bales October: 38.40 201,639 bales July: 40.35 (+.35) 52,100 bales November: 38.00 118,800 bales</p>

<p>▲U.S. Cotton Sees Southern Selling Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially firmed due to buying by industry participants, but later weakened due to selling from the South and favorable weather conditions. Futures fell by 7 to 9 points, while spot prices fell by 5 points. U.K. cotton futures rose by 10 to 11 points, with spot prices up by 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. Indian cotton weakened due to selling by European exporters and profit-taking by bullish investors, closing quiet but stable. Prices for Pingguo'er were unchanged, Aomula rose by 1 rupee, and Bairuoxi fell by 1 rupee. Original telegrams are recorded below: (17th Telegram) U.S. Cotton Compared to Previous Day Converted to Shanghai Tael U.K. Cotton Compared to Previous Day Converted to Shanghai Tael 7.874 Down 7 41.00 7.473 Up 2 45.10 10.912 Down 7 45.90 8.477 Up 11 45.50 12.936 Down 7 44.00 10.484 Up 10 46.20 1.947 Down 7 44.50 Spot 4.85 Up 15 46.30 3.965 Down 9 45.40 Egyptian Cotton 7.65 Up 15 73.00 5.988 Down 5 46.60 Pingguo'er 1.44 Unchanged 31.10 Spot 8.90 Down 5 41.80 Aomula 1.59 Up 1 34.40 Bairuoxi 1.37 80</p>

<h3 id="e130">Silk and Tea: European and American Silk Sales Still Difficult <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>In the European and American markets, Japanese silk merchants are competitively selling new crop silk, causing prices to weaken. As a result, Chinese and Italian silk merchants are not quoting high prices. Chinese merchants, having substantial holdings, are only slightly adjusting prices in response to telegrams, making it difficult to boost sales. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson and others imported 30 bales of Shanghai white filature silk, while Qianli and others imported 70 bales of white dried silk. Prices remained stable, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e131">New Danyang Native Silk Enters the Market <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>▲Poor Silk Quality… Fine Silk at 46 Yuan, Thick Silk at 40 Yuan This year's spring silkworm cocoons in various towns and villages of Danyang were exceptionally scarce due to unfavorable weather conditions, and the cocoons were also of poor quality. Cocoon merchants refused to accept inferior cocoons, so villagers are reeling their own native silk and bringing it to market for sale. Silk merchants in the city have officially opened for business. Because the silk color is dark and of secondary quality, prices are not high. High-quality fine silk is only fetching 46 yuan per 100 taels, while thick silk is fetching 40 yuan. Few merchants are buying, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Qimen Zi Tea Prices Surge by 40-50 Yuan <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>This year's Qimen black tea, due to the dedicated improvements by various tea estates,</p>
<p>emphasizes the gathering of young leaves, resulting in fine and tender tea with excellent quality. Since the spring tea season opened in Shanghai, sales have reached nearly 50,000 chests. The high prices and rapid sales are unprecedented. Currently, Qimen Zi tea, according to letters from Qimen estates, is entering the market. However, due to many estates selecting high-grade, tender leaves, production is greatly reduced. The opening price at the mountain is 60 yuan per dan, continuing to surge to over 100 yuan. With demand exceeding supply, the rising trend seems unstoppable. Recently, the first batches from estates such as Qicheng Jun Da, Zhangcun Fushengchang, Tafang Tongda Xin, Tongyichang, and Penglong Yida have been prepared and will be shipped soon.</p>
<p>According to estimates by general tea merchants, the output of Qimen Zi tea is only about 20% of last year's. The future cost of processed tea is estimated to be around 180-190 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Grain: Rainy Weather Prevents River Cargo from Being Unloaded <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>▲Xin Zha Due to yesterday's rain, river cargo could not be unloaded. Only four firms, Tong Xing Gong, Wan Sheng Tai, He Feng Tai, and Heng Xing, conducted some business. Thick japonica rice, thin indica rice, and early rice all rose by a few cents. Due to shallow water in the Xiang Road waterway, vessels in the Yejidun area cannot enter. Buyers are taking advantage of the approaching holiday to push prices up. Inland sources are scarce, and market sentiment is tense. Very little Anhui and Jiangxi rice has arrived recently. Local transactions are limited, and buyers are stirring slightly, tightening the situation. A survey of rice boats along the Suzhou River yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM counted over 300 boats, holding approximately 32,000 shi of rice.</p>
<p>▲South Shanghai The Feng Ji wharf rice market in South Shanghai saw very few people present at the morning market. There was little interest in goods displayed for inspection. Due to the continuous rain, no river cargo was transacted, so there was no market report. Six boats from the western routes, including Jiaoli, Songjiang, Fengjing, Tongli, Jinze, and Xitang, did not unload rice due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival and the period for settling accounts for firms.</p>

<p>According to news from foreign firms yesterday, Mitsubishi Corporation, Huishanzhan, and others have received new shipments of 3'7" East White Iron, which had been in short supply for many days. Therefore, there is no concern about market shortages. The market price is 1 tael 3 mace per sheet, a slight decrease of 1 cent compared to before, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday's metal trading was significantly dampened by the moldy rain, so actual transactions in the market were quite subdued. Sales were minimal except for some decorative items. However, there was strong interest in Black Iron Sheet and Huisi Iron, which had been neglected for a long time, resulting in transactions of several hundred dan each. Prices were 11 taels 7 mace 5 candareens per dan for Black Iron Sheet and 33 taels 5 mace for Huisi Iron. It is reported that buyers in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other areas are also considering purchases.</p>

<p>Reception for U.S. Congressional Delegation ▲Numerous Chinese and Foreign Socialites in Attendance ▲U.S. Congressional Delegation Departs Shanghai Today ▲Mr. Pittman to Return Home at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry, hosted a tea party yesterday afternoon from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM at Chen Bingqian's residence at No. 6 West Seymour Road to receive the U.S. Congressional Delegation. Numerous Chinese and foreign socialites were in attendance. The garden was beautiful, with lush greenery. Regrettably, with the Yellow Plum season just beginning, the weather was unpredictable. Refreshments were set up in the East and West living rooms, and the guests and hosts chatted and laughed as if meeting old friends. Melodious music emanated from both corridors. U.S. Senators Oddie and Robinson, as well as Congressman Doutel and their families, were specially invited and escorted into the living room by personnel from the Ministry of Industry. They shook hands with the host, Mr. and Mrs. Kong, and exchanged pleasantries. Mr. Oddie then told this newspaper's reporter that Congressman Gibbon had been ill for several days and had gone aboard the USS Henderson to recuperate. He regretted that he was unable to participate in the grand gathering. He also said that he and Senator Pittman were in China to study the silver issue separately. Mr. Pittman is currently in Peiping and will return to Shanghai in a few days. He will release a report after returning to the United States. The four, including Mr. Oddie, are scheduled to depart Shanghai today aboard the USS Henderson, heading to Manila on their way back to the United States. In addition to the congressmen's families, there are also more than 100 key figures from the U.S. military and political circles, 170 U.S. sailors, and 358 sailors. As for Mr. Pittman, he will pass through Beijing from Peiping in the coming days and return to Shanghai. He will take another ship back to the United States around the 24th or 25th of this month. Regarding the prospects of the International Silver Conference, it is understood that the Chinese banking community finds the situation complex and has not yet made any concrete statements to the U.S. congressmen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, those who also attended Mr. Kong's tea party included U.S. Ambassador Johnson, Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, newly appointed Ambassador to France Qian Xinzhi, U.S. Consul General Cunningham and his wife, British Consul General Brenan, Chief of Customs Maze, Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police Chen Xizeng, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai, Chinese Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Hu Mengjia, President of St. John's University Bu Fangji, President of Jiaotong University Li Zhaohuan, President of Fudan University Li Denghui, General Secretary of the YMCA Chen Liting, Principal of St. John's Middle School Na Deng and his wife, President of the Bank of China Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank Chen Guangfu, as well as Song Ziliang, Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Zhang Zhuping of this newspaper, Gu Angruo, Dong Xianguang of the Continental Daily News, and Powell of Millard's Review, totaling more than 100 people.</p>

<p>Please Revise the Maritime Law ▲ Remove Obligation to Remove Sunken Ships ▲ The Shanghai Shipping Guild yesterday submitted a petition to the Legislative Yuan, stating that it was petitioning for the revision of the articles of the Maritime Law regarding the obligation to remove sunken ships, and earnestly requesting review and implementation. Since the promulgation of the Maritime Law, various shipping companies, due to their close relationship, have conducted thorough research to avoid conflicts and to facilitate compliance. Although there are many aspects that are not entirely suitable for our country's shipping merchants, the most significant damage and unbearable burden for shipping merchants is Article 23, Section 6. Upon repeated requests from members, the guild has petitioned for revisions in the past. This was submitted to a special members' meeting for public discussion. It was unanimously agreed that our country's shipping industry is undeniably in its infancy and relies entirely on the government's principle of providing the utmost protection to offer treatment suitable to its level, in order to safeguard the existing and promote the future. Although there are many methods, the law is the most important. Now, because our country's maritime industry has no precedent to follow, the Maritime Law has been compiled and implemented to bring it onto the right track and achieve the rule of law. The intention is excellent. It is believed that the reason our government implemented tutelage before constitutional government was because it recognized that the people's overall level had not yet reached a sound state, so it lightened their burden, aiming to ensure it was within their capacity, guiding them gradually to seek suitability. Shipping merchants are one part of the people as a whole, and their level is also very elementary, with training just beginning. Responsibility should be slightly relaxed to allow for development and hope. In today's shipping industry, the essence of laws and regulations should naturally embody the intention to protect and support, to nurture the budding sprouts of existing businesses, and to stimulate the investment interest of those in the future, so that the number of Chinese ships increases daily. Once maritime rights are recovered and Chinese ships are sufficient to supplement them, the realization of doctrines will rely on this practicality. The relationship is extremely important. Examining maritime operations, they inherently contain danger, and shipwrecks are a common occurrence. Now, listing the removal of sunken ships as one of the responsibilities of shipowners seems to imply a punitive intent. However, when the causes of ship sinkings are investigated, whether they are self-inflicted or caused by collisions, they are generally not intentional. Since they are not intentional, there is no basis for punishment. To say it is a matter of holding someone responsible for their actions, there is even more to say. For example, if someone is driving a car on a main road and is hit and the car is destroyed, leaving it on the road would obstruct traffic. The local police authorities would naturally immediately remove it. One has never heard of the car owner being ordered to remove it themselves. This is because the car has already paid taxes, and the car owner is a taxpayer to the state or local area. The local police authorities' expenditure to remove it on their behalf is merely fulfilling their due obligations. Comparing maritime law to land law, comparing ships to cars, and comparing shipowners to car owners, the situations and positions are completely identical, and there is no possibility of ordering it. Moreover, in reality, the majority of shipping companies in our country own only one ship. The capital raised is often insufficient to cover the ship's value, so they borrow and mortgage to supplement it. The insurance amount is set at the standard of the loan mortgage amount due to saving expenses. Payment of the insurance amount requires a considerable amount of time. After obtaining it, it is often insufficient to repay the debt. They are already struggling to compensate for the remaining ship value and the various expenses of negotiation, compensation, and severance. Therefore, even if they are ordered to remove the sunken ship, it is impossible to make something out of nothing, and it cannot become a reality. Therefore, merely having laws without the ability to enforce them is not the government's original intention in legislating. Furthermore, some may refer to the insurance amount as the ship value, but it is not known that insurance is a contractual act, containing a preparatory nature, to meet the needs of replenishment and to aim for a day of recovery. Therefore, although insurance uses the ship as the subject matter, the intended use of the amount paid after the insurance is determined in advance, and it should not be regarded as the ship value. This is not a theoretical matter. In 1923, various countries convened the International Maritime Law Conference in Geneva and agreed on the uniform treaty for maritime disasters. Article 5 adopted a proactive approach to insurance claims, considering them as a reserve fund for shipowners to restore business and compensate for losses, and absolutely not recognizing them as ship value. This has become a common international practice. Furthermore, in terms of laws and regulations, when a ship sinks under the circumstances listed in Articles 163, 1, 2, and 3 of this law, the shipowner may declare abandonment. Once abandoned, their status as the owner is terminated, and as they are no longer the owner, they naturally do not bear the responsibility of contributing to the removal. Moreover, in the United Kingdom, which has advanced maritime commerce, the Sunken Vessels Act of 1877 and Articles 530 to 32 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 assign the responsibility for removing sunken vessels to the port authority. The expenses are paid from the maritime fund, in addition to using the items salvaged from the sunken vessel to offset the cost. These laws and regulations are sufficient for our country to learn from. Moreover, various countries in the East and West promote shipping without empty talk, allocating huge amounts of money annually to provide practical subsidies. Although the methods vary, the key to protection and the thoroughness of cultivation are the same. All these facts are clearly understood. Our country's unification has just been completed, and the treasury has not yet been replenished. Although the government intends to imitate this, its strength is still limited. Shipping merchants humbly understand the difficult times and dare not have extravagant hopes. However, concerning the government's designated funds from shipping merchants for specific uses, abandoning them and still ordering shipping merchants to bear the burden, the treatment is as different as heaven and earth. This is also something that shipping merchants are unwilling to accept. The so-called designated funds from shipping merchants for specific uses are the tonnage dues collected by customs, which are levied on ships and used for dredging waterways. The payment of tonnage dues by shipping merchants already covers the expenses on waterways. Government agencies clearing obstacles on waterways are merely fulfilling their due duties and should not damage the national treasury. If we follow the provisions of our country's Maritime Law and list the removal of sunken ships as the responsibility of shipowners and attempt to handle it accordingly, it would be practically impossible due to the environment. If we treat it as mere paperwork, we are afraid of trampling on the law. If it is forcibly enforced, once a ship sinks, there will be no basis for replenishment or hope for recovery. Our country's shipping merchants will inevitably decrease daily due to accidents. Not only will future investors regard it as a dangerous path due to the thought of gambling everything, but existing businesses will also sell out and switch to other industries because of one fall making it difficult to recover. This is contrary to the government's main objective of recovering shipping rights and promoting the shipping industry. All of this is due to laws and regulations that have not examined the facts or suited the level. The survival or abolition of this article is a matter of life and death for shipping merchants, and they are determined to appeal as much as possible to seek survival. Fortunately, the laws and regulations are newly enacted, and their suitability is still being tested. Therefore, revision is a necessary stage, and petitioning is a civil right conferred upon them. The guild should submit petitions to the Legislative Yuan and relevant ministries, earnestly requesting prompt revision to be changed to handling by the port authority, and the expenses to be paid from the tonnage dues, so as to alleviate pain and support development. The shipping industry and shipping rights are deeply intertwined with interests. Approaching the presentation, we cannot help but await your urgent orders.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Difficulty in Collecting Fushun Coal Export Tax <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲Due to Unreasonable Protest from Japanese ▲ According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the issue of collecting export taxes on Fushun coal passing through Dalian will soon escalate. Deputy Ambassador Shigemitsu visited Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting on the 17th to protest in person. However, Song and Wang both sternly rejected the protest. Song stated that this was an appropriate and reasonable measure, and Wang also stated that this was China's tariff autonomy and that foreigners could not interfere. If Japan insisted on refusing to pay, they would not hesitate to submit it to international judicial arbitration, as China had sufficient justification in terms of tax treaties. Yesterday, after reading this news, the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter happened to meet a key figure in diplomatic circles and discussed the brief history of the mine and the reasons for the protest. It was said that the Fushun Coal Mine includes several areas such as Qianjinzhai, Dashan, Dongxiang, Yangbaobao, Laohutai, Wandawu, and Xintun Longfeng. Although the total amount of reserves cannot be accurately known, according to past measurements, it is estimated to be over 100 million tons. On average, it can produce more than 9,000 tons per day. When it was first established, it was purely Chinese-owned. Later, due to operational difficulties, it was jointly operated with the Russians. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan forcibly occupied the mine, claiming it was Russian-owned, and has been doing so ever since. The coal produced there is of excellent quality, and none of the coal produced in various mines in Japan can compete with it. Therefore, the Japanese industrial sector relies heavily on the supply from this mine. Now that the National Government has imposed an export tax on it, the impact on the Japanese side is conceivable. However, the Japanese seized our country's mineral resources to meet their own country's needs, and now they do not want to pay the export tax on it. Moreover, this export tax is not levied solely on Japan. Why should Japan protest this matter alone? Therefore, commentators believe that this is likely an unreasonable demand from the Japanese diplomatic community.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Shanghai Shipping Merchants Oppose <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Customs Collects Tonnage Dues on Deck Cargo ▲ The Jianghai Customs announced that from July 1st, all deck cargo loaded on Yangtze River ships must be subject to tonnage dues, with a tax of one mace of silver per ton. Various shipping companies in this city believe that deck cargo should not be taxed as an exception, and have specially requested the Shipping Guild to petition the Ministry of Finance to exempt this special tax. The main reasons are that customs has regulatory measures for the transportation of goods by ships, and insurance companies have restrictive conditions. Items such as fish and fresh fruit, due to their perishable nature, cannot be loaded into the cargo hold. Also, items such as cotton and cloth, due to their flammability, are easily jettisoned and must be placed on deck or in the ship's passages, not because the cargo hold is full. Moreover, tax calculation hinders ship schedules, and restricting loading hinders the flow of goods. It should be requested that this tonnage due be immediately cancelled by the customs to alleviate merchants' difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Negotiations on the National Products Market Case Today <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>▲ Directors and Staff of the Public Works Department Invited ▲ Municipal Government Instructs to Claim Losses According to Law ▲ The Chinese National Products United Market has been ordered to close by the Public Works Department and has been closed for ten days. The Municipal Government has protested to the Public Works Department yesterday, and ordered the market to claim compensation for losses according to law. The various situations yesterday are recorded as follows. ▲ Negotiations Today National Products Market Committee Chairman Zhang Zilian and Hong Yanbin Ren Jinpin received a request from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai yesterday, urging them to go to the meeting at 4:00 PM today (19th). It is reported that the Chamber of Commerce also invited Hua Xun Yu Qiaqing, Western Director Bairang, and staff from the Public Works Department Fire Department of the Public Works Department to discuss the next steps together.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Instructions The Municipal Government issued instructions to the National Products Market yesterday, stating that both submissions have been received. The Public Works Department of the International Settlement abruptly ordered the closure of the market and sealed it off due to the issue of the attached amusement department's license. It had not requested permission from the court beforehand.</p>
<p>The rash execution was a fundamental error, not only hindering our country's legal rights but also violating the agreement of the Shanghai International Settlement Special Court. The Secretariat of this government has been instructed to send a letter to the Public Works Department of the International Settlement to lodge a serious protest. As for the losses suffered by the market, the market should directly claim compensation according to law. This instruction is hereby notified. ▲ Ministry of Industry Instructions The Ministry of Industry received a report from the Industrial and Commercial Visiting Bureau, dispatched personnel to investigate the truth of the National Products Market case, which was ordered to close by the Public Works Department, and the process of negotiation. It immediately consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for investigation and handling. The National Products Market received instructions from the Ministry yesterday, stating that the telegram has been received and the situation has been reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for investigation and handling on the 13th of this month. This instruction is hereby notified. ▲ Bureau of Social Affairs Instructions The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the closure order of the National Products Market by the Public Works Department and reported the situation to the Municipal Government a few days ago. Instructions were issued to the National Products Market yesterday, stating that the submission has been received and the situation has been reported to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Public Works Department of the International Settlement for protest. Further instructions will be issued after receiving instructions. This instruction is hereby notified.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Public Works Department Collects Land Tax on "Fangdan" Land <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ Taxpayers Association Sent Letter to the Bureau Yesterday Requesting Correction ▲ The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Joint Settlement sent a letter to the Director of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating that according to a letter from Mr. Gu Deqi, he sold a piece of land measuring 1.7 fen (a Chinese unit of area) to the Shanghai Public Works Department on June 25, 1928. The land is located west of Muir Ming Road in the settlement, registered as No. 2289 in the Public Works Department's register. The land is connected to the ancestral "fangdan" land. When buying the 1.7 fen of land, the Public Works Department instructed him to sign a contract stipulating that the land tax must be paid for the "fangdan" land as well. He was forced to sign the contract at the time and was unaware of the implications. Now he understands that the Public Works Department has no right to collect taxes on "fangdan" land. The contract he signed with the Public Works Department, stipulating that the "fangdan" land must pay taxes to the Public Works Department, violates the charter and is legally invalid. Moreover, the Public Works Department's sale of the remaining 1.7 fen of land to him is merely an ordinary transaction and there is no reason to make tax payment a condition for the "fangdan" land. He is ignorant and does not know the correct interpretation of this matter, so he is writing to request instructions for compliance. Based on this, the Executive Committee decided that in the interest of caution, Li Bohan and Liu Hongyuan were assigned to investigate. Now, according to the report, the point of contention is whether the Public Works Department can collect taxes on "fangdan" land according to the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. According to the investigation, the Public Works Department has never collected taxes on "fangdan" land. This is evidenced by pages 132 and 319 of Volume 1 of Judge Feitang's report. As for Gu Deqi's case, the Public Works Department had him sign a sales contract with an attached condition that the buyer must acknowledge the seller's right to collect taxes on his "fangdan" land when buying 1.7 fen of land from the Public Works Department. In terms of private law, private contracts are absolutely valid. However, there is an exception for contracts that violate public interest or national sovereignty, which are legally invalid. Moreover, using tax payment as a condition for a sales contract seems unreasonable in terms of law and sentiment. Whether or not this is appropriate is up to you to decide. This matter was referred to the Standing Committee, which decided to send a letter to your bureau for review and request that you correct this error immediately. While this was being processed, another letter was received from Mr. Wang Anfu, stating that he has an ancestral land plot located on East-West Huade Road. In 1924, when he rebuilt his house, the Public Works Department ordered him to cede a few feet of land and compensated him with 3,000 yuan. The following year, the Public Works Department started collecting land tax from him. However, his inheritance is a "fangdan" rather than a "daoqie" (official land deed). He pays grain tax to the Shanghai Municipal Government every year. Now, the Public Works Department is collecting land tax from him again. Although he protested, the Public Works Department forced him to pay, and he had no power to resist, so he had to pay. Moreover, because the amount was small at the time, the land has now been revalued by the Public Works Department, and he is now required to pay nearly 200 yuan per year in land tax. It is unreasonable for him to pay tax with a "fangdan". He is writing to request your association to uphold justice and negotiate with the Public Works Department. This matter should also be handled together. Please investigate and correct this error immediately.</p>

<p>Revises Procedures for Property Rental Assessment ▲ Establishes Valuation Committee ▲ According to the Public Works Department Gazette, the revised procedures for property rental assessment are as follows: the bureau has hired three experts from outside the settlement to form a Rental Assessment Committee with two members from the bureau. All disputes regarding rental assessment for the purpose of collecting police rates will be resolved by the committee. If taxpayers are dissatisfied with the rental assessment made by the bureau, they should notify the director of the bureau in writing within 30 days of receiving the assessment notice and submit it to the committee for review. If no notice is submitted after 30 days, the police rates must be paid according to the assessed value. Furthermore, if taxpayers are still dissatisfied with the review result of the Rental Assessment Committee, they should provide reasons in writing and notify the director of the bureau within 30 days of receiving the review result notice, and submit it to the Tax Rate Appeals Committee for review. Otherwise, the review result must be absolutely complied with.</p>

<p>▲ To be Completed Within One Year ▲ The second part of Judge Feitang's report, advisor to the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, has been published. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Mr. Wu Jingxiong, the newly appointed advisor to the Public Works Department, and asked for his opinion on the report. Mr. Wu said that he had just received the second part of the report yesterday and was currently reading it. Although the facts on which Judge Feitang's report is based are quite accurate, due to the different standpoints and the complexity of the situation in Shanghai, there may be omissions in its objective aspects, which is inevitable. He (Mr. Wu referring to himself) plans to prepare a report within one year to contribute to the Public Works Department. He has already started working on it, and the materials in Judge Feitang's report are also worth collecting. The reporter asked what would happen if Mr. Feitang's report contradicted his opinion. Mr. Wu said that fortunately, the Public Works Department regards this report as a reference only, and not as a policy guideline. Therefore, the report he drafts will also be for the Public Works Department to use as a reference for research. Mr. Wu then said that a certain tabloid reported today (i.e., yesterday) that he would resign from the presidency of the Supreme Court, which was a completely unfounded rumor. Since he has a contract with the Public Works Department, apart from legal affairs that can still be carried out without conflict, it is not convenient for him to break the contract to take on other positions for the time being.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs has recovered the river berths on the Huangpu River that were occupied by foreign ships and naval vessels. Berths No. 7 and No. 8 were used by the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK). When the customs went to recover them, the Japanese initially refused to return them. After several negotiations, the matter has now been resolved. The two river berths have been recovered by the Jianghai Customs, but for the convenience of NYK's ship mooring, the berths have been leased to the company, with a fixed monthly rent collected by the customs.</p>

<p>Advocates for the Immediate Expulsion of Cheng Xun The National News Agency reports that since the Jiangwan shaman Cheng Xun has been spreading rumors and misleading the public, it has drawn serious attention from party members. Newspapers have been widely reporting on this news in recent days, and the truth behind the inside story has become clear to the general public. The Seventh District Party Headquarters believes that Cheng the shaman is deceiving the people in this way, which is intolerable under party rule. If it is not stopped, the spread of superstitious ideas will be extremely dangerous. They have requested the Municipal Party Headquarters to expel the shaman Cheng Xun immediately to prevent him from bewitching the ignorant masses. They have also sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that they immediately carry out the expulsion to eliminate the atmosphere of superstition and gradually improve the people's intellect.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Reform of Japanese Raw Silk Inspection <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Government Decides to Implement Quality Inspection on Exported Raw Silk from January Next Year ▲ Japan is the largest silk-producing country in the world, exporting 600,000 bales annually, worth more than 300 million Japanese yen at current market prices. Its development is largely due to the government's research and encouragement, and the people's efforts to promote it. According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Raw Silk Inspection Office, the Japanese government has been researching raw silk grading. After two meetings, Japanese and American opinions have gradually converged. Also, in view of the fact that the inspection methods adopted by export silk merchants are not uniform, it has been decided that from January next year, all Japanese exported raw silk must undergo quality inspection at the two national raw silk inspection offices in Yokohama and Kobe, and be graded. Then, buying and selling will be based on the inspection results of the inspection offices. It is reported that after this is implemented, various trade disputes in raw silk trading will be reduced, and the credibility will be increased, the benefits of silk manufacturers will also be protected, and the Japanese raw silk grading work will be implemented. This is a great help to the Japanese raw silk trade, and our country should pay attention to it.</p>

<p>▲ Yan Huiqing Presumed to Be Chairman of the Pacific Conference ▲ The Pacific Association's current conference is scheduled to be held in Hangzhou from October 21st to November 4th. It has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Yan Huiqing has been presumed to be the chairman of the conference. About 150 representatives from various countries will attend. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has promised to do its best to assist with the hospitality arrangements. There are many issues to be discussed, the most notable of which are Judge Feitang's report, an expert advisor to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement, and the world silver market problem. Regarding the Manchuria-Mongolia problem, the Japanese representative proposed an exception, and the Australian representative proposed a reduction of armaments by Pacific countries. Yu Rizhang, the chairman of the Chinese branch of the Pacific Association, has resigned due to illness. Yan Huiqing has been publicly recommended to succeed him.

<h3 id="e173">Destruction of the Minghe Steamer <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲All Crew Members Rescued and Returned to Shanghai  ▲British Steamer "Maqin" Also Unable to Help</p>
<p>The Ningbo-Shaoxing Steamship Company's "Minghe" steamer was wrecked off the coast of Haishenwai. The crew has now been rescued and returned. The ship has been completely destroyed, with losses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The salvage vessel "Fengpu" returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Our reporter made a special trip to investigate and learned the details, which are recorded as follows and should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>▲Ship Owner Reports the Accident</p>
<p>Mr. Andy Wilkinson, the owner of the "Minghe" steamer, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and submitted a report stating that after the "Minghe" was chartered by the Soviet Russian fleet, it arrived off the coast of Zhupanova in Kemchatke's Peacock Harbor on April 22nd to await barges to transport goods. At that time, the barometer on the ship fell, and they dared not drop anchor. Instead, they used nets to block the wind and release pressure. Unexpectedly, a heavy snowstorm struck at night, and the ship could not withstand it. It was hit by huge waves onto the sandy beach, and the hull was stuck and unable to move. They urgently telegraphed for help. The Soviet team in Sui sent a ship to lighter the goods. The steamer was repeatedly struck by tides and waves, gradually being pushed towards the beach. Now, after more than 40 days, it has been completely washed onto the sandy beach and sunk into the mud.</p>
<p>▲The Rescue Efforts of the Fengpu</p>
<p>Upon receiving the news, the Shanghai General Bureau immediately dispatched the "Fengpu" steamer, along with workers and technicians from the Sanbei Company's factory, to carry out the rescue. While in Japan, they also hired several divers to go to the site of the accident together. After investigation, Zhupanova was still seven days' sailing from Sui. When the "Fengpu" arrived, it was observed that the "Minghe" was one nautical mile away from the sea. At low tide, the entire ship was on the shore. The steamer could not approach, and sampans could not reach it. After inspection by workers and technicians, and divers entering the water, all stated that it was too far from the sea and there was no such long cable for towing. To attempt a rescue, the project would be huge, costing at least four to five hundred thousand dollars, requiring the seabed to be deepened to allow water to enter the ship. As a result, after requesting instructions from the Shanghai Bureau, it was decided to abandon the ship.</p>
<p>▲Rescued Crew Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>Upon receiving a reply telegram from the General Bureau, the "Fengpu" steamer transferred the 49 employees of the "Minghe" steamer, from the shipowner down to the workers, onto the ship and rescued them back to Shanghai. Since it was decided to abandon the "Minghe," all detachable items inside the ship were unloaded one by one and transported onto the "Fengpu" and loaded together. However, the engine, machinery, etc., could not be removed and had to be destroyed in the ship. Yesterday, the "Fengpu" returned. When the crew arrived in Shanghai, the Bureau ordered them to temporarily stay in Shanghai to be reassigned to other ships. It is noted that the "Minghe" steamer had a load capacity of 2,400 tons and was currently valued at 400,000 dollars, but was only insured for 80,000 taels, so the loss must be over 300,000 dollars.</p>
<p>▲The "Maqin" Also Abandoned</p>
<p>The "Nanshan Maqin" of the Laisi Foreign Firm, which ran aground in the same area last year, was also the target of a rescue attempt. This time, when the "Fengpu" went to rescue the "Minghe," Mr. Maqin, the owner of Laisi, also brought 16 rescue workers and technicians on the same ship to tow the vessel. However, after inspecting it at Peacock Harbor, its situation was the same as the "Minghe," impossible to salvage. They had to abandon this ship as well. Mr. Maqin had already taken the "Fengpu" steamer, leading the rescue workers, back to Shanghai. The abandonment of these two ships will result in a total loss of 700,000 to 800,000 dollars, which is a great misfortune for the Shanghai shipping industry.</p>

<p>▲Dispute Over Shipping Rights on the Sichuan River</p>
<p>Due to foreign merchants seizing business, Chinese shipping companies have suspended operations. As reported by this newspaper, yesterday, the local steamship companies received a telegram from Yichang stating that since foreign merchant ships joined the shipping association and broke up the Chinese merchant alliance, a major dispute has arisen in the shipping and navigation industries in Sichuan. The most important issues are: Chinese merchants proposed reducing the number of ships to even out business, but this was opposed by British Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire. As a result, only five Chinese ships remained, while foreign ships numbered nearly thirty. Regarding the issue of ship schedules, it was agreed that the first to arrive would depart first, but this was broken by Nissin Kisen Kaisha. Furthermore, it was later proposed that all ships on the Sichuan River reduce their cargo by half to prevent large ships from monopolizing the market, but this was rejected by the Yujiang Company. Finally, the Sichuan Chamber of Commerce refused to accept the new price of six taels per piece for cotton yarn water transport, only recognizing four taels per piece. As a result, a major dispute has arisen between the shipping and navigation industries in the Sichuan River. So far, neither side is willing to yield, and there is no solution. ▲American Steamer Rescued from Danger</p>
<p>The No. 1 steamer of the Shanghai Jiejiang Company ran aground near Yichang, as reported by this newspaper. Yesterday, definite news was received that the ship had been towed out by a ship dispatched by Jiejiang Yichang. The hull was not severely damaged, and the cargo was undamaged.</p>

<p>Continued Allocation of Disaster Relief Funds for Rehe Chaoyang</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society, previously concerned about the severe disaster situation in Rehe Chaoyang, jointly operated the Chaoyang Congee Kitchen with Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, a great philanthropist, and Mr. Yang Zigong of the Four Provinces Charity Association. Each society allocated 10,000 yuan to select key locations to set up kitchens and distribute congee, as reported in previous issues. The Society has now received a report from Mr. Yang Zigong stating that the Chaoyang area is vast, and the disaster situation is expanding. Three to five congee kitchens cannot solve the problem. After considering the suitable locations at a moderate distance, a total of nine locations were established, including Chaoyang Main Street, Shuangmiao, Yangshangen, Deyingzi, Tazigou, Datun, Gangyaoling, Ershijiazi, and Miaogou. In addition, one location was established in Shanguotun, Jinxi County. The directors of each congee kitchen have been assigned and started operations on June 10th. However, the 10,000 yuan allocated by the Four Provinces Charity Association and the Society, totaling 20,000 yuan, is insufficient. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao sent a telegram requesting additional funds, stating that each association needed to add 10,000 yuan. The Society is currently in a very difficult situation and could not refuse. Fortunately, a certain great philanthropist generously made a grand vow to donate 2,500 yuan. The Society decided to telegraph Mr. Yang Zigong, adding 5,000 yuan first. The Society will also add 5,000 yuan, and find ways to raise the rest.</p>

The autumn seedlings were completely destroyed, and the ripening wheat was also severely damaged. The villagers suffered greatly from this disaster and are in unspeakable pain. Please promptly inspect the area, etc. The society immediately sent personnel to conduct a detailed survey, which confirmed the reported situation. Please quickly provide relief, etc. The county has been plagued by natural disasters and banditry, and the people have reached the point of extreme suffering. Currently, they are trying their best to provide relief and call back the refugees. Unexpectedly, they suffered another hailstorm, with no hope for the autumn harvest. The situation is tragic, and urgent relief is needed. It is hoped that the central government and charitable organizations will consider that the people of the county have been in dire straits for a long time, and have suffered such a severe disaster, with no harvest and no food. They are imploring for quick relief and generous donations, so that the stranded carp can be revived early. Zhang Fang of the Henan Relief Association.</p>

<p>Precautions After Repeated Robberies  ▲Joint Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Police and Local Militia Implement Joint Defense ▲Inspection of Stations and Wharves</p>
<p>On the night before last, at around 8 PM, more than ten bandits armed with guns and electric torches suddenly arrived in Luodian Northwest Township, which is under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County. They robbed six or seven peasant households in the village before fleeing with shouts, resulting in a loss of approximately 600 yuan. Unexpectedly, around 10:30 PM, the residences of the Xu and Wang families in Dachang and Liuhang were robbed by bandits one after another. By the time the police and local militia arrived, the bandits had already fled far away. Yesterday, after receiving the report, Qiu Mingjiu, the county magistrate of Baoshan County, was extremely angry that robberies had repeatedly occurred in various townships under the county's jurisdiction, which seriously hindered local public security. He immediately convened a temporary joint meeting at around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, gathering the leaders of the first, second, third, and fourth public security bureaus, as well as the local militia, various agencies, and public organizations.

<p>The Shanghai French Concession Mixed Court yesterday issued a proclamation stating that, for the matter of the proclamation, it was approved by the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai Special District Stamp Tax Office, stating that, according to the report from Liu Chuntuan and Shen Rulin, the stamp tax commissioners of the French Concession, it was recently read in the newspapers that the Special District Local Court announced that any house tickets in rent arrears litigation cases that are not stamped will be punished according to regulations. The French Concession should follow the same rule. It is proposed to request the French Public Bureau for assistance in following the precedent that, in future property litigation cases, any house tickets that are not stamped should be punished according to regulations, ordered to be stamped, and announced in advance so that everyone knows. Since its establishment, this office has written to the Public Bureau for assistance in promoting stamp sales as much as possible, so that it can proceed smoothly and increase tax revenue. The office is very grateful. House tickets should be stamped according to regulations. Currently, many property owners in the French Concession are complying with the regulations, but there are also many who have delayed complying. According to the aforementioned report, in addition to instructing the commissioners to provide earnest guidance at any time, the Public Bureau should be informed to investigate that, in future rent arrears litigation cases, any house tickets that are not stamped should be punished according to regulations, ordered to be stamped, and an announcement should be issued so that the public is aware. Please also order a copy of the draft to be sent to the office for publication in the newspaper. With utmost anticipation, etc. In addition to copying the draft and responding, the litigants are required to stamp house tickets in all rent arrears litigation cases from the date of this proclamation. If any have not been stamped, in addition to being ordered to be stamped, they will be punished according to regulations. Everyone must comply and not violate this proclamation, June 18th, 1931.</p>

<p>▲Lantern Parade Postponed to Tonight</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association is organizing a children's hygiene movement. The lantern parade, originally scheduled for yesterday, was postponed to tonight due to the rain all day yesterday. Here is the information received yesterday: ▲Lantern Parade: Yesterday (the 18th) afternoon at 6 PM was the day for the lantern parade for the children's hygiene movement. However, due to the bad weather and rain all day, the parade could not be carried out. It was decided to postpone it to tonight. Children and boy scouts from various schools will gather in the field at the end of Qiujiang Road in Zhabei and depart in classes with lanterns at 6 PM. ▲Fly-Catching Competition: In the summer season, the most significant vector for infectious diseases is flies. Flies reproduce very quickly. As the weather has warmed recently, it is appropriate to reduce them through catching in a timely manner. The Association will hold a fly-catching competition for one week, divided into school and individual groups. The Association will send fly swatters and bags to municipal schools, and the schools will distribute them to the children to catch flies. Individuals can also participate. After one week, the Association will view the results of the catching, produce forms, and announce the results. The winners will be awarded prizes by the Association. The school group will be awarded banners, etc., for first, second, and third prizes. The individual group will be awarded ten prizes.</p>
<p>▲Free Injections: During the four days of the children's hygiene movement, doctors and nurses from the Municipal Health Bureau and the Public Concession Health Department will be dispatched to the Zhabei and Yangshupu Child Welfare Health Hospitals to give children visiting the exhibition area injections to prevent epidemics. ▲Lectures and Performances: Tonight, during the children's lantern parade, when all the teams have gathered, key members of the Association and representatives from the Education Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Health Bureau, etc., will give speeches on various issues of children's hygiene. Representatives from the Child Welfare Education Institute and the Youth Propaganda Team will then give performances. Afterward, a children's hygiene film will be shown in the area. ▲Children's Bathing: Today from 2 PM to 5 PM, children viewing the various children's displays at the Child Welfare Health Hospital on Qiujiang Road in Zhabei can declare their intention to take a bath at the hospital and join in order without paying a bathing fee. ▲Declaration of the Movement: Alas, our elders, brothers, sisters, uncles, and aunts! Have you heard the report from the Shanghai Pushan Manor? According to Pushan Manor's statistics, Shanghai averages one hundred coffined children's corpses collected every day. Calculated in this way, excluding those buried by families themselves, 36,000 young compatriots die every year. Is that not terrible? The reason for this is that people do not pay attention to hygiene, which makes it easy to spread diseases, leading to death. Although there are charity hospitals everywhere that can treat diseases, "knives and medicine are effective, but it is better not to cut," and "medicine is good, but it is better not to get sick." To avoid getting sick or being infected, hygiene is essential. However, there are also difficulties in this. For example, poor friends live in small, low houses, eat leftover tea and rice, and do extremely hard work. How can they pay attention to hygiene? What people do not know is that these poor friends need to pay even more attention to hygiene, because they live in small rooms with poor air quality, which makes them susceptible to disease. They eat leftover tea and rice that have been visited by flies and sleep in open-air places where mosquitoes bite, which makes them susceptible to infectious diseases. Once they get sick, they spread confusion everywhere. Children do not develop fully, and once infected, they are bound to die young. Therefore, this association has launched this children's hygiene movement! In particular, in the Zhabei area, there are the most friends doing small businesses, and in the Yangshupu area, there are the most friends doing labor. These friends in both places go out to seek food and clothing and neglect their children, letting them live and die on their own. Now that the weather is gradually getting hotter, and diseases will slowly come. If people do not pay attention to hygiene, and once epidemics become prevalent and diseases spread, it will be beyond redemption. Therefore, this association has launched the children's hygiene movement, which will be held first in the Zhabei and Yangshupu areas. This time, the event is larger than last year. In addition to requesting guidance from the government agencies, Social, Health, Public Security, Education, and Public Utilities Bureaus, many enthusiastic public welfare schools and organizations are participating and assisting. Although this movement of the association is said to be for children's hygiene, it is actually to urge parents to take responsibility, because children's happiness depends on adults seeking it for them. Naturally, children's health should also be sought by adults. This is a win-win situation: children's health and freedom from pain are the greatest happiness for the whole family. Being able to teach children about hygiene means that they themselves must understand hygiene. Therefore, this solemn declaration is made, hoping that our elders, brothers, sisters, uncles, and aunts will join and assist in making the local people have a common understanding of hygiene, so that the mortality rate of children can be reduced, and the number of healthy citizens in society can be increased. Then the children will be fortunate, the country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate.</p>

<p>Various silk and satin dyeing workshops in this city, due to the soaring prices of dyes and the sharp increase in coal prices, which have greatly increased costs, previously notified various silk businesses in January of this year of a four-cent surcharge per dollar. Now that the first accounting period of this year has arrived, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Trade Association has sent separate letters to the Silk and Satin Trade Association, the Electrical Silk Weaving Trade Association, and the Xu Lun, Qianjiang, Crepe, and Shengjing guilds, stating: “Regarding the steadily rising prices of dyes and coal, your respective firms are well aware of this. Our industry has settled the dyeing accounts for the first period of the 20th year [of the Republic], and after deliberation at a general meeting, it was decided to increase the prices by 40% according to the regulations in the letters sent to various silk firms in January of this year (i.e., four cents per dollar). In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper and informing the dyeing factories to comply, we are sending this letter accordingly. We respectfully request that you examine this, inform your respective silk firms, grant understanding, pay the full amount, and refrain from making difficulties. Post-holiday prices will be discussed and determined at a later date.”</p>
<h3 id="e190">Han and Xiao’s Housing Dispute Case Adjudicated <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Han Boping previously sued Zhou Xiaozi Zhen over a dispute concerning jointly rented housing at the Public Concession Court. The court ordered Xiao to compensate the plaintiff, Han Boping, with a surplus of several thousand dollars. However, Xiao was dissatisfied with the judgment and hired a lawyer to file a false accusation, requesting a retrial. His request was granted, and after investigation, the debate was declared closed, awaiting a verdict. Yesterday, the date of the verdict arrived, and both parties were summoned to court. Judge Zhu ruled as follows: (Main text: The original judgment is revoked, and the defendant’s initial lawsuit in the retrial is rejected. The litigation costs are to be borne by the defendant in the retrial.) Reasoning: According to the plaintiff in the retrial, in 1925, he and the defendant in the retrial jointly leased a house in Huaqing Lane, Zhengjia Wood Bridge. Less than two months later, the defendant in the retrial moved to another place, which is an undisputed fact. This kind of joint lease of housing is not comparable to a separate business partnership. If the defendant in the retrial did not express any intention to dissolve the partnership or abandon the leasing fee when he moved out, then why did he neither transfer the lease to someone else at that time nor ask the plaintiff for the leasing fee? Now, after six or seven years, he has begun to negotiate and demand surplus rent. Furthermore, after the defendant in the retrial moved out, the plaintiff in the retrial bore the full rent. Later, because he did not want to continue living there, he terminated the lease in 1927, and Yang Xiao rented it instead. Regarding this point, the landlord's agent of the Sino-French Bank has provided proof, which further shows that the two parties no longer had a leasing relationship with the house. What disputes could there still be? The defendant in the retrial, in the initial trial, was in the position of the plaintiff and had the burden of proof. He neither presented any written agreement entered into with the plaintiff in the retrial nor proved who was subletting for profit and where the surplus was. These were just empty claims. The initial trial did not investigate carefully and hastily ordered compensation, which was quite inappropriate. Now, the plaintiff in the retrial's request for a retrial cannot be said to be unreasonable.

<p>▲Xu Shiying and Zhang Qun Officiated at the Wedding ▲Wang Xiaolai Delivered a Congratulatory Speech Minister of Communications Wang Boqun and Miss Bao Zhining, a graduate of Datong University, held their wedding ceremony at the Xu Garden on Connaught Road at 5:00 PM yesterday. Congratulatory guests filled the venue, and carriages clogged the streets, creating a grand scene for a time. The officiators were Xu Shiying and Zhang Qun, the introducers were Zhang Wenhua and He Jiwu, and the representatives of the parents were Mrs. Wang and Bao Junhao. The guests included Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Li Zhonggong, Cai Ziping, He Yaozu, Zhuang Zhihuan, Xu Xiuzhi, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Xizeng, and hundreds of colleagues from the Ministry of Communications, as well as dozens of foreign guests. At 4:35, the bride and groom entered the hall to the sound of military music. Mr. Wang wore a blue robe and black mandarin jacket, while Miss Bao wore a white satin embroidered gown and a long veil, with an elegant demeanor, dignified and beautiful, and a beaming smile. After the ceremony, the officiator Xu Shiying delivered a congratulatory speech, saying, "Today, Mr. Boqun and Miss Zhining are holding their wedding ceremony. Mr. Boqun has devoted himself to the Party and the country and is in charge of communications. Therefore, I have an analogy. Today's wedding is like the launching ceremony of a newly built giant ship, like the postal service sending its first package, holding an opening ceremony, and like the opening of the telegraph office, holding a foundation-laying ceremony. I deeply hope that Miss Bao will assist Mr. Wang in making the communications industry increasingly prosperous." His words were extremely humorous, and the crowd applauded and burst into laughter. Next, Zhang Qun delivered a speech, and finally, the guest representative Wang Xiaolai delivered a congratulatory speech, saying, "I am honored to be elected as the representative by the guests because I have many sons and daughters. I would like to offer my congratulations. I hope to eat red eggs on this day next year. I have heard that Miss Bao won the first prize in speech competitions at school. I am not good at rhetoric, so how dare I show off my skills in front of an expert? I hereby represent the guests in requesting Miss Bao to report on the process of their love." The crowd applauded and urged her to speak, but the master of ceremonies saw the opportunity and shouted to play music. Thus, the newly married couple exited the hall to the sound of music. The congratulatory guests then swarmed upstairs, offering their congratulations. It was not until around 11:00 PM that they gradually dispersed. It is reported that the newly married couple plans to go to Nantong for their honeymoon in the coming days.</p>

<p>Scenery of the Three Gorges in Sichuan. The scenery of the Three Gorges where Sichuan and Hubei meet is magnificent, with precipitous cliffs, crumbling cliffs, and chaotic rocks, which are shocking to the eye. It is famous all over the world and is the only way for the Yangtze River to enter Sichuan. For thousands of years, due to the swiftness of the river and the treacherous shoals everywhere, it has been heard that civilian boats have hit reefs and had accidents every day. During the winter when the water is shallow, even steamers going upstream are often dangerous. Therefore, although the scenery has always been beautiful, few photographs have been circulated, because travelers are always wary, and the photographs taken by steamers passing by rarely achieve good results. This newspaper specially sent its Sichuan border photography reporters Wang Xiaoting and Liu Shuofu, who recently arrived in Chongqing from the Sichuan border. In view of this, they were willing to brave the dangers and travel down the river in a small boat, taking pictures along the way. Mr. He Beiheng, the director of the Sichuan River Shipping Department, greatly supported this initiative and specially ordered protection along the way and specially invited Mr. Leng Bofu, the owner of the Deyuan Photo Studio in Chongqing, to accompany them, specifically to take pictures of the dangerous shoals for the Shipping Department. It is learned that the three gentlemen took the Fushun ship to Fengjie on the 9th of this month, hired a small boat, and started from Kuifu, passing through Baidicheng, Kuimen, 灔澦堆, Qutang Gorge, Chijia, Baiyan, Ershan, Fengxiang Gorge, Wushan, Gaotang Temple, Shennu Temple, Wuxia, Twelve Peaks, Badong County, Zigui County, Quyuan Temple, Bingshu Baojian Gorge, Kongling Gorge, Niugan Mafei Gorge, Baigou Gorge, Huangniu Gorge, Dengyingzi Gorge (i.e., Xiling Gorge), and arriving at Yichang. The boat traveled in the river, taking pictures along the bank everywhere. Regardless of the precarious cliffs and dangerous rocks, they only sought a superior position and were not afraid to climb. When passing through Bashu, because the local area strictly guarded against the communists, a misunderstanding occurred with the local militia, and the militiamen fired guns, piercing two holes in the boat and shattering a tripod and three teacups. Fortunately, no one was injured. The films taken by the two gentlemen this time are mostly scenes that are not easily seen and will be gradually published in this newspaper's pictorial. According to the Wang Liu Er jun, who traveled west for more than half a month, they should be able to return to Shanghai tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Day and Night Bank <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Begins to Return Deposits After the Day and Night Bank went bankrupt, various deposits and the deposits of the Great World Savings Department, after the liquidation of the two accountants Wu and Pan, began to issue one-tenth of the deposit starting from the 18th of this month, entrusted to the Shanghai Bank for distribution. As the branch of the bank in Baxianqiao was about to open, a temporary office was set up next to the Great World. As the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching, the depositors of the Day and Night Bank and the Great World were eager to obtain a small amount of cash to meet their urgent needs. Therefore, the branch office, which was originally scheduled to open after the festival, opened early before the festival. At 8:00 AM on the 18th, before the office door was reached, it was already crowded with people. At that time, it was raining heavily, and people were standing in the rain. In order to facilitate the people, the office started issuing earlier at 8:00. However, there were so many people that the staff of the office were waving their hands and looking around, extremely busy. Although they were unable to cope with the situation, the staff were all energetic and managed things in an orderly manner. The manager of the branch, Xi Yushu, was also very busy, directing back and forth.</p>
<h3 id="e206">The One Who Jumped to His Death <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Turned Out to Be a Kidnapped Hostage ▲Was an Accountant at Ruikang Paint Store ▲Had No Contact After Being Kidnapped The case of an unnamed man jumping from the third floor at No. 2, Sicheng Lane, Julai Da Road, in the French Concession the day before yesterday, resulting in his immediate death, was reported in this newspaper. However, since the case occurred, people have been discussing it and have been unable to agree. However, according to the speculation of most people, it was said that he was mostly a kidnapped hostage, imprisoned there, and took the opportunity to jump from the building to escape, resulting in his unfortunate injury and death. It was not until the next day that someone came forward to claim the body. The deceased was indeed a local kidnapped hostage. At that time, Baldi, the Western detective of the French police, feared that the news would spread and make it difficult to solve the case, so he specially instructed the newspapers to postpone the disclosure. However, yesterday, the local news column of a certain newspaper had already described it in detail. This newspaper specially supplements the information to make up for the deficiency.</p>
<p>▲Often Did Not Return at Night It was found that the deceased's name was Wu Tingfang, from Ningbo, 44 years old, residing at No. 2 Junyi Lane, Belle Road, French Concession. He was currently the chief accountant at the Ruikang Paint Store on Wangping Street. In addition to his wife, Mrs. Liu, there was only a chauffeur and a maid at home. Wu took a car to the store every day around 9:00 AM, but Wu was extremely fond of gambling and often returned home late at night or did not return at all. ▲Suddenly Heard of the Kidnapping On the 26th of last month, Wu left home in the morning and did not return all night. At that time, his family only thought that Wu was out performing local opera and did not expect him to fall into the hands of bandits. Several days later, they suddenly received a letter from the bandits, urging them to pay a ransom. However, the letter did not specify the contact location or the amount of the ransom, so Wu's wife ignored it. Until the day before yesterday, Wu took advantage of the bandits' carelessness and jumped from the building to his death. ▲Indeed Identified Correctly Although Wu was over forty, he still had no children, so he adopted his nephew, Xiaojin, as his heir. The nephew, 25 years old, originally lived in Wenzhou and is now working at the Xiehe Kerosene Company in Tunchi, Anhui. He took leave a month ago to return home, and passed through Shanghai, staying at Wu's place. Yesterday, after reading the newspaper and observing the clothing, he was certain that it was his uncle. He told his mother, and they went to the morgue together to claim the body. Sure enough, it was Wu's body. The aunt and nephew were overwhelmed with grief and immediately gathered the family to move the body to the Siming Guild Hall. The body was placed in a coffin yesterday morning. After the funeral affairs are completed, the coffin will be taken back to their hometown for burial.</p>

<p>Continuation of the Trial of Shuai Songping ▲ Numerous witnesses give conclusive testimonies ▲ The Shuai household's furnishings are like those of the wealthy ▲ Shuai claims his family has a scholarly lineage for generations ▲ The current affair is a case of malicious fabrication Shuai Songping, also known as Shuai He, Shuai Huzi, Cai Songling, Cai Henian, Cai Peng, a native of Jiangxi who previously held prominent official positions, came to Shanghai after leaving politics and engaged in kidnapping. He acquired cars, motorcycles, and exquisite houses and equipment for kidnapping purposes. His operation was large-scale and could be considered the chief of kidnappers in Shanghai. On December 18th of last year, Lu Shaotang, a Suzhou native and comprador of the Compagnie Franco-Chinoise, was kidnapped by bandits on Yunnan Road. Lu's Russian bodyguard, Martis Tado, was shot and killed by the bandits. Less than half a month after the incident, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspectorate of the General Police Station, along with Inspectors Liu Shaokui, Tang Jian, Detectives Feng Zhiming, Wang Chengying, Detective Bao Wu Hanzhang, and others, uncovered the bandit den at No. 374 Hart Road, rescued the hostage Lu Shaotang, and arrested the kidnapper Hu Mingde, who was guarding the hostage. Four pistols and over a hundred bullets were seized.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the kidnappers Wang Sanhuai, Tian Changsan, and Liu Dianqing were apprehended and handed over to the Special District Court. They all confessed that the principal offender in the case was Shuai Songping. The Special Court later sentenced Wang and Tian to death, and Hu and Liu to life imprisonment. Meanwhile, an order was issued to all police stations to strictly apprehend Shuai and bring him to justice for interrogation. On May 2nd of this year, Shuai was suddenly arrested by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. Chief Inspector Lu ordered Inspector Liu Shaokui to bring Shuai to Shanghai and hand him over to the Special Court for interrogation and detention, as already reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Jiashi of the Criminal Court opened the first court to continue the trial. Shuai Songping hired lawyer E Sen to defend him. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station stated that the police were prosecuting Shuai Songping under Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Kidnappers, Article 1 of the Regulations for the Prohibition of Military Firearms, and Item 1 of Article 284 of the Criminal Law. It was also stated that when Lu Shaotang was kidnapped, a motorcycle slowly preceded Lu's car, blocking it. The police later found that the vehicle was a Victory brand, number 238. Subsequently, the vehicle was discovered on Jiujiang Road and seized by detectives. Wang Sanhuai, who was driving the vehicle, was arrested. Wang confessed that the operation was based in room 51 of the Dadong Hotel, and the hostage was hidden in Shuai Songping's home at No. 414 Lane Lafei, Lafei Road. Detectives went to Dadong and apprehended Tian Changshan. They went to the Shuai's house but they did not find the kidnappers or the hostage. Later, under the guidance of the criminal Wang, they went to another residence of Shuai's at No. 374 Hart Road, where the hostage was rescued. The doorkeeper of Lane Lafei, Dai Shikui, also found a pistol in Shuai's garden, along with many bullets.</p>
<p>After the police arrested Shuai, they presented Wang Sanhuai and Tian Changshan. Wang and Tian identified Shuai from among the other criminals, stating that Shuai looked much thinner than before. Zhan Chengxiang, the rent collector for the house at No. 374 Hart Road, and Li Zhaokun, the driver, also testified that the keys to the house were given to Shuai, and the rent was also collected from Shuai. Cao Linbao, a tea server at the Dadong Hotel, also testified that Shuai frequently visited room 51. One of the four pistols seized from the Hart Road residence was examined by the Western detective Milers of the Bureau of Public Works, who determined that it was used to kill Tado. All the witnesses were present in court and available for questioning. Dai Shikui testified that he found a pistol inside the bamboo fence opposite Shuai's house. Western Detective Milers testified that one of the pistols seized from No. 374 Hart Road, with the number 629612, was the one used to kill Tado. Zhan Chengxiang testified that in June of last year, a young man came to the house of the landlord Cheng Zhongshi to rent the house. He claimed to be from Anhui, and his father was named Wang Zhisan, who had served in politics and was now in Shanghai to avoid the chaos. He paid a deposit of 20 yuan. The next day, Cheng asked me to visit Wang Zhisan at room 307 of the Dahua Hotel to discuss the rental procedures. I went and met the defendant, who claimed to be Wang Zhisan. I gave him the lease to find a guarantor. The defendant said that he was not familiar with Shanghai and could not find a guarantor from a shop, only a personal guarantor. He paid me the remaining rent of 110 yuan. In July, he moved in. In August, I went to collect the rent. The defendant gave me the lease with the name Wang Sanhuai as the guarantor. After the defendant and others moved in, I went to see the inside, and the furnishings were well-arranged and extremely luxurious, appearing like those of the wealthy, so I did not suspect anything. When I saw the defendant, he was a little fatter than he is now, etc. Li Zhaokun testified that he gave the house keys to Shuai and showed him the inside once. Cao Linbao testified that Shuai frequently visited room 51 of the Dadong Hotel. Wang Sanhuai and Tian Changshan, who had been sentenced to death, testified that the defendant was indeed Shuai Songping. When they went to kidnap Lu Shaotang, Shuai was still in room 35 of the Dadong Hotel. However, Shuai is now thinner than before, and his beard is also white. Hu Mingde and Liu Dianqing, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, said they did not know Shuai Songping. At this point, the witnesses had finished their testimonies. Shuai Songping was then questioned, and Shuai firmly denied the charges, saying that he was in Tianjin at the time of the incident and that he was being falsely accused. He also stated that his family had a scholarly lineage for generations, his ancestor had served as the chief examiner of Shandong, and he was a civil servant, pleading for leniency. Judge Xu Jiashi verified the testimonies and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, rescheduling the trial for July 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Chen Bingxiang Kidnapping Case <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Suspicious Taxi Driver ▲ Car Once Carried a Bandit Away ▲ Taxi Also Used in Previous Kidnapping Case in Nanshi Cantonese Chen Bingxiang was kidnapped by bandits on Morrison Road the night before last. Fortunately, the taxi driver was alert and drove away quickly in an empty car. Although the bandits got the ransom, they could not return to the bandit den, so they all fled, allowing Chen to escape. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Afterwards, the Hongkou Police Station received a report from Wang Arong, a Tongzhou native and driver for the Zhongshan Taxi Company at No. 294 Zhaipu Road, which rented the car, stating that the bandit who rented the car claimed to be surnamed Qiu and rented the car to go to Baoxing Road, Zhabei, for business. After the incident, the man was still in the car and asked to be driven around the various roads for a week. When they reached Fujian Road, he paid a fare of 1.4 yuan and got out of the car. He appeared to have a pistol hidden in his sleeve. After investigation by Captain Mao Yiwen and Detective Liang Yongji, the police suspected that the driver, Wang Arong, was also involved in a case on the 12th of this month in Nanshi, where a person surnamed Mou was taken away in a car rented from the Zhongshan Company and driven by Wang Arong. Wang was brought back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Xiao.</p>
<p>The police lawyer stated that the kidnapped person shouted for help at the time and fled into the Japanese residence at No. 2. When the detectives arrived after hearing the alarm, the taxi driver was still carrying a bandit and did not stop the car. Furthermore, the taxi in the kidnapping case in Nanshi was also rented from the Zhongshan Company and driven by the same driver, making Wang highly suspicious. Wang Arong stated that he did not know that the person in the car was a kidnapper. The court ordered the defendant to be detained and further investigated.</p>

The motivation for the Public Concession to hire Fei was because a method would soon be adopted to "gradually abolish extraterritoriality in China," and they wanted Fei to make suggestions. However, it was clarified that the abolition of extraterritorial rights would have a significant impact on the entire status of the Public Concession. "However, the reason for preparing a construction plan for the future of the Public Concession is not only for the abolition of extraterritorial rights. Regardless of whether the abolition is near or far, the current system is peculiar in nature, and there are difficulties and dangers attached to the existing circumstances. Therefore, even if the status of extraterritorial rights does not change for the time being, all important issues must be addressed urgently." It then goes on to describe the widespread issues arising from the demand for "recovery." "Recovery" refers to "the termination of the existing system of the Public Concession and the return of its actual administration to Chinese management." The main issues regarding recovery are listed as follows: (1) The first is a general issue, namely, what are the reasons for supporting or opposing recovery? Whether the theory of those who support recovery, whether it is to be implemented immediately or ultimately, is convincing. It must be noted that the reasons put forward by those who advocate a policy of recovery are based half on theory and half on practice. In terms of theory, the existence of the current system of the Public Concession is an infringement of China's sovereignty. Therefore, returning the Public Concession to Chinese management is a legitimate and necessary step to satisfy the reasonable aspirations of the Chinese people. There are two points based on practice: (a) In some respects, the current administration of the Public Concession is imperfect and inefficient. If the concession is returned to Chinese management, these shortcomings can be remedied. (b) Whether the current administration of the Public Concession has been beneficial or culpable to those who actually reside or do business in the concession, dividing the entire Shanghai into three unconnected administrative regions, namely the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, results in a division of jurisdiction and significant disadvantages. Therefore, for the benefit of the entire Shanghai, its municipal system needs to be unified. The viability of the recovery claim, which is based on practice rather than theory, depends on further questions, namely (2) If recovery is implemented, what new system will replace the old system? If the existing governance regulations in the Land Regulations are about to disappear, will all local autonomy of the Public Concession be lost? Will the concession be merged with the adjacent Chinese area to be governed by a completely Chinese municipal system, without foreign participation? Or will a new system be established to maintain the existing system of autonomy and the cooperation between Chinese and foreigners in the existing local representative body? If the latter approach is adopted, will a representative municipal council be established in the Public Concession itself, or will it only be a part of the local autonomy organ organized for the entire Shanghai? In addition, there are important questions regarding timing: (3) If the principle of recovery is accepted, should recovery be an immediate goal, or should it be regarded as an ultimate goal? In other words, will the change be implemented immediately, or will it be implemented after a transitional period? (4) If a transitional period is required, how long should this period be, or what considerations should be used to determine the length of the transitional period? Then, it goes on to describe other key issues that need to be examined: (a) If the policy of recovery is not adopted, or (b) If recovery is deemed the ultimate goal of policy implementation, there must be a transitional period, during which the existing system of the Public Concession will remain unchanged. First, the issue of the relationship between the Public Concession and extraterritorial rights: In order to maintain the main characteristics of the Public Concession system, the most notable of which is to enable the municipal system established in accordance with the Land Regulations to continue, is it necessary to rely on the maintenance of extraterritorial rights, or at least to rely on the main countries in the concession to maintain their extraterritorial rights? Second, the existing governance system of the Public Concession needs to be reformed so that its shortcomings can be removed, or its nature can be improved. There are various issues regarding this reform. What are the current shortcomings and areas for reform regarding the following: (a) The organizational laws governing the organization and task methods of the taxpayer meeting and the organization and election methods of the board of directors? (b) The powers and responsibilities of the Bureau of Public Works in both administrative and legislative aspects within the Public Concession? (c) The powers that consuls and ministers of various countries may exercise over Public Concession affairs? (d) The relationship between the Bureau of Public Works and the central and local governments of China? (e) The exercise of judicial power by the courts in the Public Concession? ▲ Chapter 2 With reference to the above in this report, the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works is recognized as an executive body with administrative duties.</p>
<p>The current position and responsibilities of the Bureau are examined. The report indicates that although the Bureau is commonly known as the "Shanghai Public Concession Bureau of Public Works", in some respects its responsibility for governing is far greater than that of an ordinary municipal institution. The general situation regarding the scope of responsibility of the Bureau of Public Works and the magnitude of the interests it protects is outlined as follows: In addition to the ordinary responsibility of municipal management, the Bureau of Public Works must also be directly responsible for preventing internal and external troubles in order to maintain the safety of life and property within the Public Concession. The prosperity of Shanghai, and the welfare of Chinese and foreign residents in the Public Concession and its adjacent areas, clearly depend on the Bureau of Public Works fulfilling its responsibilities to the fullest extent. Since Shanghai is China's main commercial center, its importance means that the interests involved are far greater. If Shanghai cannot maintain law and order and sufficiently interfere with the credit and safe environment required for large-scale commerce, the economic impact will be far-reaching.</p>
<p>International and domestic trade, whether exported or imported, via the main rivers that converge in Shanghai, or directly or indirectly maintained and controlled by Chinese and foreign banks and commercial institutions in the Public Concession or its neighboring areas, will be stopped or hindered. Furthermore, the national government's tax revenue, collected from commerce passing through Shanghai or from industries centered in Shanghai, accounts for nearly half of the total customs revenue, and a large proportion of other taxes represented in the published budget. The amount of domestic government bonds raised by Chinese merchants in Shanghai is also far greater than elsewhere. Therefore, if riots or disturbances occur in Shanghai, depleting the important sources of tax revenue and government bonds, or significantly reducing the current large supply of funds from these sources, the government's finances will be exhausted. Among the issues affecting the future governance of the Public Concession, the interests that are involved and at risk are not only the interests of Chinese and foreign commercial firms and individuals engaged in industry and commerce within the Public Concession and the interests of their employees, but also general and far-reaching economic interests, including the interests of various parts of China with Shanghai as a commercial or banking center, the national interests of the entire China, and the interests of other countries, which vary according to the depth of their foreign trade relations with China. This is clearly obvious without further discussion. ▲ Chapter 3 Focuses on the attitude of Chinese and foreign residents in the Public Concession towards the issues affecting the future of the concession. The situation when Fei Tang arrived in Shanghai in January 1930 is described, with particular attention paid to "increasing the general approval" of the Chinese directors for various reasons, the most important of which is "that the atmosphere in January 1930, in terms of the relationship between Chinese and foreign residents in the concession, was better than two years earlier in dealing with issues affecting the future of the concession." The report then mentions how the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors from three to five, proposed in April 1930, was discussed. How the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 16 rejected this proposal, and how the special meeting on May 2 passed this proposal with an absolute majority. The opinions expressed by leading Chinese and foreign merchants when talking to Fei Tang are excerpted in the report, and attention is paid to the fact that when quoting the opinions of "Chinese merchants", it is known that the merchants who express</p>
<p>This opinion is not only important, but it is truly related to businesses operated entirely by Chinese. It then mentions that the Chinese people insist on the demand to reclaim the concession, but it is clearly not an eagerness to reclaim it immediately. Responsible people in Chinese society are fully aware of the value of security provided by the concession system and do not want it to be changed easily. One of the facts that Chinese residents value is that "the Public Concession is able to govern itself without being controlled by the Chinese government or the Kuomintang because it enjoys the right of autonomy." Moreover, these Chinese people are well aware of how the Public Concession and the Chinese municipal territories connected to it differ in terms of autonomy. The opinions of the foreign community are described as follows: Leaders in the foreign community, while intending to acknowledge that China must eventually reclaim the Public Concession, also pay particular attention to the fact that it is not yet time to fundamentally change the status of the Public Concession. If any changes are made to its current status now, and the Public Concession is directly managed by the Chinese, there will be harm. These people clearly believe that security is an indispensable factor for the protection of commercial interests and the maintenance of Shanghai as a great industrial and commercial center. The meaning of security, as explained above, not only includes the protection of life and property from internal disturbances or external attacks, but also includes the maintenance of the rule of law in the Public Concession and exemption from illegal arbitrary taxes. They believe that this situation can only be achieved by continuing the governance system of the Bureau of Public Works while rejecting Chinese administrative officials from directly exercising their powers within the Public Concession. In other words, they want to maintain the Public Concession as a safe and well-governed urban area where residents can continue to enjoy the safety of life and property under the protection of the courts, and they firmly believe that if the Public Concession is returned to Chinese management now, there will be no hope of obtaining the above elements. Therefore, what they advocate is nothing else but that if Shanghai's future is to remain a commercial center, it depends on maintaining security in the broad sense, as described above. The attitudes of both Chinese and foreign residents are summarized by two slogans: What are these two slogans? They represent what people on both sides often say: "security" and "cooperation." "Security" is the slogan of the foreign community, because foreigners believe that unless the Public Concession continues to be governed by a board of directors with a majority of foreign representatives for a long time to come, its security cannot be maintained. Responsible Chinese merchants, although expressing this less directly, seem to recognize the necessity of security. And I can say that the majority of responsible Chinese merchants are prepared to agree that before China's situation becomes what they call "more stable", there is no hope of returning the Public Concession to Chinese management and having it provide the same security as the existing system of the Public Concession. In early 1930, and thereafter, I had private conversations with responsible Chinese and foreign business leaders, and based on the attitudes generally expressed by these leaders, I came to the conclusion that under the current circumstances, if it is certain that the various foreign countries intend to withdraw their troops stationed in China, and that in the near future, the Public Concession will be returned, and the conditions they set will make the Public Concession governed by the Chinese without restrictions, then an atmosphere of terror will fill the air, the foundation of credit will be greatly shaken,</p>
<p>Commerce will be stalled, and serious dangers will follow in the economic sphere. The Chinese slogan is "cooperation." Cooperation means that in the near future, the system of the Public Concession should be maintained jointly with foreigners, and the affairs of the Bureau of Public Works should be handled jointly with foreigners in a practical manner.</p>
<p>From the Chinese perspective, this will enable the administration of the Bureau of Public Works to take on a new look. The Chinese believe that in this way, the Bureau of Public Works will no longer be seen as an institution that maintains the power of foreigners to rule the Chinese, but will become an institution where Chinese and foreigners can jointly handle concession affairs to protect the common interests of all residents and promote the welfare of the Chinese and foreign communities. The sincerity of the Chinese people is demonstrated by how they nominated several prominent figures to serve as Chinese directors, and how these directors performed their duties. As for the foreign community, look at their acceptance of Chinese directors and the policies they adopted on issues that particularly affect the interests of the Chinese people. This not only shows that they have accepted the principle of cooperation, but also shows that they intend to put this principle into practice. In my opinion, as far as the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors is concerned, it is clear that not only the leaders of the foreign community have recognized that the cooperative efforts of Chinese and foreign residents are a necessary condition for the continuation of the concession system and the security it provides, but also the majority of the foreign community has recognized this. The above conclusion regarding the opinions of responsible Chinese merchants is based on private conversations. The statements of various Chinese groups quoted in Part Four, on the whole, do not contradict this conclusion. The statements naturally endorse the recovery of the concession, but there is a clear indication that there must be a transitional period before recovery. Even those who express the demand for immediate recovery are only making a formal proposal, because those who drafted the statements all hope for an extremely long transitional period, so that various organizational reforms and other innovations can be implemented in the concession during this period. It should also be remembered that the current situation in China often shows a consensus on certain issues, but this is only true on the surface and can be misleading. Because on this issue, it would be dangerous for Chinese people to express an opinion and openly oppose the demands that the masses often shout. Therefore, it is difficult for any Chinese person to express an opinion about the future of the concession publicly or semi-publicly, and it is difficult to publicly disagree with the demand for immediate recovery, even if it is to share the responsibility for expressing this opinion. Even if they express support for this demand in public, their individual opinion is completely opposed. ▲ Acknowledgement We thank the Commercial Press for donating Volume 28, No. 5 of the Eastern Miscellany, Volume 17, Nos. 4 and 5 of the Women's Magazine, and Volume 22, No. 3 of the Fiction Monthly, one copy each.

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor, After reading your newspaper report about the incident on the evening of June 1st, where bandits injured military police patrolling near the Zhengui Railway Station, there are many inaccuracies. According to the statement from the First Regiment of Military Police, on the evening of June 1st, the night fog was dense and visibility was near zero. Military police patrolling the area traveled to a location about three miles west of the Zhengui Railway Station when bandits suddenly opened fire, wounding two military police officers. During the chase, a speeding train passed by, separating us from the bandits, allowing them to escape. A search was conducted for a long time, but nothing was found. There was no arrest of foreign bandits. Most of the reports in the newspapers afterwards were not factual, especially the report of the arrest of foreign bandits, which is easily misunderstood. We are issuing this solemn statement to clarify the truth. We respectfully request that your newspaper correct this report to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Songhu Garrison Headquarters, June 18th.</p>

<h3 id="e211">The Great Xia Wanbai Literary Society's Farewell to Graduating Members <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Heng</p>
<p>The Wanbai Literary Society of Great Xia University, known for its prestigious reputation, has seen its affairs flourish since the re-election this semester. It is heard that with the summer vacation approaching, more than ten of its members are about to graduate. In order to bid farewell to the graduating members and report on the society's affairs, the society held a farewell party for the graduating members at the Great Xia Hotel the day before yesterday. More than fifty people attended. At seven o'clock, the society's chairman, Mr. Tong Shiquan, presided over the meeting, with Mr. Gao Liepeng serving as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that today's meeting is a farewell party for the graduating members, and there are four purposes that can be reported. The first is that at the end of the semester, the society's affairs should be gathered with all members to make a detailed report. The second is that some members of the society will graduate from the school this semester. Everyone has been like-minded and has been together for a long time. Once separated, whether serving society or studying abroad, they will be separated by distance and see each other less and less. The psychology of parting is common to all, so there must be today's meeting to commemorate us. The third is that the graduating gentlemen have specialized knowledge, and will either dedicate themselves to society or continue their studies in the future. The society sincerely hopes that you will work hard for the country and seek happiness for society. The fourth is that we are busy all day long, and there are few opportunities to gather together, and in a wandering life, we are all guests in a strange land, and we still meet today when we are about to part. So we feel that today's gathering is worth commemorating. After the chairman finished his report, Mr. Wang Ruinian delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the society. In addition, Dr. Huang Jingsi, a member of the society, gave a speech, mainly on three points regarding the society and the graduating members: first, there must be a spirit of cooperation; second, there must be the courage to fight; and third, it must be organized. Finally, graduating members Zhang Zhenyong and Xu responded one after another, briefly stating that they were very grateful for your kindness, and that they would bravely move forward and work hard for the Party and the country, hoping to meet the society's expectations. Afterwards, various recreational performances were performed to add to the fun. Among them, Wang Yingjun's "The Unofficial Biography of Taizhen," Wu Zongrong's "Nanyang Pass," and Yi Kejian's "Fenhe Bay" all won a lot of cheers. Finally, the chairman told a very humorous joke and the meeting adjourned. The clock struck ten.</p>
