<h3>今後敎育上基本問題之討論（三）</h3>
<p>第三問題之所以提出。共中心意義。在於希望確立敎育之方針與目的。使其合於實際。合於現代。尤其合於現代我國家社會與人民共同之需要。今日我國家之病。在於貧。人民之病。在於無知。無生産之學識與技能的知。貧與無知托出呈現於社會表面者。乃爲混亂。爲騷擾。爲種種之天災與人禍。故今日敎育之任務。不在於徒搬東洋西洋不合我國情之敎育原理。主義。學制。重演於我國。亦不在於造出少數出類拔萃。裝飾體面之人物。而在於授予人民以實際適合生存之學識與技術。使個人能持以爲生。國家與社會能賴以進入建設與進化之途。然而今日。敎育之所表現者。大學敎育徒爲少數富裕子弟之裝飾品。徒爲富裕子弟轉入仕途獵取功名利祿之階梯。惟其目的僅爲裝飾也。故敎育放任。學者荒蕩。選舉皇后。竟成時尙。優遊歌舞。亦成風氣。惟其目的爲從事政治也。故學校遂成爲角逐之塲。成爲政治鬬爭之實習地。排此迎彼。風潮迭生。至於中學則絕無其獨立性。似乎純爲升入大學之準備。惟其純爲準備升學。故所學與實際生活隔離。而純爲書本上之裝飾知識。惟其獨立性。故除少數富裕子弟能得升入大學。以完成其裝飾門面與獵取功名之美夢外。多數無力升學生。遂流爲一無所能一無所用之高等遊民。强者乃鋌而走險。弱者遂厭世自殺。曾有人批評二十年以來之敎育。爲改土八股爲洋八股。改土科舉爲洋科舉。爲小姐少爺之裝飾品。縉紳先生之娱樂品。與一般人不發生關係。即與受敎育者本身生活。亦毫無關係。此種大膽之暴露。固指前五六年之情形而言。然而吾人試一檢閱今日敎育界之實際情形。如不强自掩飾。則五年前後。有無進步。吾人殆將慚怍無以自答。質言之。今日之敎育。爲拉靑年出社會。與實際生活分離。而非引靑年入社會。以解决其本身及社會一切問題。爲提高靑年生活之慾望。走入奢靡無能無用之絕境。而非導靑年走入生産與建設之坦途。故愈敎而國愈貧。社會秩序愈亂。人民乃愈苦痛。職業敎育會議宣言中有云。「今日匪之八九。皆爲兵。共産黨十之八九。皆爲學校畢業生。」靑年同感無出路。同感生之艱難環境所激。思想隨之而轉變。近兩年來「思想國難」爲不可掩飾之事實。而當局不求諸敎育。（自亦非敎育單方面所能解决）徒訴諸政治。政治之裁制愈嚴。無出路之羣衆乃愈激而惡化。敎育已失其效能。而敎育者則依然繼續從事於「爲敎育而敎育」之敎育。此種現象。至爲可痛。今後如不求所以改進之道。則靑年將永無出路。靑年思想亦將永無可解决。「民不畏死。奈何以死懼之。」嚴刑峻法。將安所施。固然此種現象之造成。不僅由於敎育。要之敎育之使命。爲對現實求進步。爲追求比現實較高較遠之理想。現實如此。敎育家安所辭其責。此記者之所以有第三問題之提出也。</p>

<p>▲肇事原因昨晚（十八）八時許、小鮑島桓台路永順利魚行華商小販孟吉瑞、到遼寗路一百六十八號日商魚行門前、與該魚行庖役劉某（華人）談天、當時該行經理日人志磨證彰、出而阻止伊等閒談、並强行驅逐、孟當時略有伸辯、詎該日人即脫下木屐、猛向孟毒毆、警士葉恒逹向前排解、亦遭毆辱、時華人圍觀者甚多、均抱不平、即有人上前理論、該日人初不置答、忽用電話報吿國粹會、邀集打手數百日人、各手持刀棍等兇器、蠭擁而來、於是慘劇從而發生矣、</p>
<p>▲行兇情形查國粹會爲日本僑居靑島的浪人所組織、平日假武士道大和魂之名、要刀要槍、說是保存日本的武士道國粹、故名國粹會、其實完全是仇視華人、壓迫華人、一其有組織的機關、故一經志摩電邀、立時携帶刀槍、全體出發、旣到之後、逢着華人便砍、並派人阻絕交通、不許警察近前干預、以遂種慘殺之目的、是時華人在外乘凉、及來往行人、約有千數百人、因手無寸鐵、無法抵禦、均受刀棍重傷、一時秩序大亂、哭嚎之聲、慘不忍聞、該管分所巡官見無法制止、只得飛報公安總局請示、</p>
<p>▲臨時處置公安局接報吿後、立用電話報吿胡巿長、胡氏深恐釀成大變、立飭保安大隊前往彈壓、公安二分局長萬永壽亦率警趕到、會同日本憲兵、先將雙方人趕散、然後將受重傷之華人十一名、用汽車送往巿立醫院救治、一塲風波、暫吿平息、</p>
<p>▲受傷調查今日（十九）上午十時、巿府派社會公安兩局、會同日領館人員、調查受傷人數、我國方面到者、有社會局科長陳魏·公安局科員呂錫智·劉永祿·巿立醫院院長李功范·及新聞記者等、日方到者有日領館館員平山勇·神内醫院院長神内正範、並請德國名醫衛士英、檢騐傷痕、以作佐證、先往巿立醫院查看、並將華人受傷者之口供各取一紙、由中日醫士作證、所供均係路過該處、被日人砍傷、兹將受傷者姓氏傷痕誌下、（一）胡耀南、年二十一歲、右肩胛部、左胸及左耳下、均受刀傷甚重、（二）宋本珍、年十三歲、頭頂受刀傷二處、長六寸、深傷腦骨、（三）葉恒逹、年三十九歲、公安局警士、左頰部打撲傷、（四）王潤兹、二十六歲、第一艦隊海鶴艦兵士、左肘刀傷、創口三寸、骨已砍斷、（五）王志新、二十九歲、頭部刀傷兩處、長二寸餘、又左膝部挫傷、（六）張保祁、二十九歲、左足打撲傷、（七）王殿柱、二十七歲、右肩胛及背部刀傷三處、一長四五寸、一長三寸、一長寸許、（八）韓少祺、三十三歲、公安局警士、左下臂刀傷、長五寸餘、（九）莊相福、二十八歲、頭部刀傷兩處、均深及骨膜、長二寸餘、（十）張吉發、四十九歲、右背部刀傷、創口長六七寸、深一寸、昏迷不醒、脈搏細弱、恐有性命危險、（十）（一）孟吉瑞、二十八歲、左顴被木屐打腫、</p>
<p>▲巿府抗議巿府接到各方報吿後、即派參事周家彦赴日領館口頭向日領事提出抗議、午后日領事館亦據片面理由、用書面向巿府抗議、巿府已據理駁覆、一面將肇事經過、電呈中央報吿、一面復用書面、向日領館正式提出抗議、大略以暴力團擾害社會安寗、應請嚴予取締、此外並有懲兇·道歉·撫卹·賠償·各項要求、（至日人兇器、有長刀一把及竹棍木棒等、已交公安局保存作證、）</p>
<p>▲責任問題此次事件發生、原由日人志摩無理阻止華人談話之自由、旣以木屐擊傷孟吉瑞、復用電話邀集國粹會議徒行兇、而且日人向來遇事發生、必報吿日警察所、今不報吿日警察、獨報吿國粹會、該會亦竟於夜間集有數百人之多、立即持刀到塲行兇、顯然事前似有組織有計畫、事後該志摩又將廚役劉某藏匿、更有隠秘之處、且華人均屬徒手、絕無抵抗能力、故受傷者、大都在背後、是以日人應負此次事件之全部責任、</p>
<p>▲日報造謠本巿日人所辦之報紙、今日竟出號外、顚倒實事、謂有華人五千人、圍攻國粹會、且謂日人受重傷者數十人、並急電駐旅順之日艦球磨速開靑援助、純作一面之反宣傳、以期事件之擴大、誠堪痛恨者也、（八月十九日）</p>

<h3>魯省黃河險象槪况</h3>
<p>▲重要險工到處皆是</p>
<p>▲下游水勢又漲一尺</p>
<p>濟南通信、本年黃河水勢之大、沿河二十二縣、上中下三游、延長不下七八百里、重要險工、到處皆是、幾於防不勝防、搶不勝搶、而水之來源尙旺、昨十九日河務局特將全河所有險工、呈報省府、原文如下、「山東省政府主席韓鈞鑒、據北二·北三·北五·北六·南二·南三·南四·段委各員先後急電稱、北二分段五龍潭民埝溜勢陡變、第二壩埝頂刷坍、長十餘丈、北三譙莊第七八石埽、坍塌一二丈不等、王莊第三石壩、席家道口第二及第二十六號石壩、相繼塌陷一二丈不等、北五唐家·常家第四五灰石堤、下角冲塌、王家集八壩、吊蟄入水、劉家口四壩前眉、五壩下角、第十二壩中間、均冲塌丈餘、大崔家第三壩、全埽坍塌、馬張家第十壩三埽、淘蟄六丈餘、北六宫家·孫家·大馬家·綦家嘴·王莊等處、埽壩全行上水一二尺不等、蟄陷迭呈、南二霍家溜二十石護沿下角冲塌、陳家圈二十一稽埽上下角、被溜冲没、洛口第七·第九·第十四石壩均漫水、五壩上角、刷塌二丈、大道王埽壩基、塌坍丈餘、麻家平水稽埽六段、道旭八段、馮家十三段、王旺莊十九段、周家漫水稽埽十段、小王莊五段、佛頭寺四段、工情之險、岌岌可危、各等情據此、除電飭各該承防段長等督率兵夫、無分風雨晝夜、分别拚力搶護期保無虞外、謹電禀陳、河務局長張連甲叩皓、」</p>

<h3>江北洪水調查紀（太晚）</h3>
<p>夏秋之交、霪雨兼旬、吾國之遭水患者、計十有餘省、尤以蘇省江北、受災最慘、其特殊原因以地勢低窪、毘連高郵邵伯洪澤諸湖、素有澤國之稱、加以上游黃河故道、淮沂各水、汜濫而下、以至運河漫溢、而江南太湖、浩浩蕩蕩、長江水勢日增、上下堵塞、　高寶一帶、儼如水櫃、其水平線、高出江湖、僅持多年失修一線長堤、故土圩冲毁平地變成汪洋百姓蕩析離居、農事盡遭淹没、災情奇重、爲數十年所未有、江蘇水災義賑會囑余前往視察一周、余乃乘便輪、破浪而上、直逹淸江浦、</p>
<p>淸淮爲舊遊之地、故友甚多、此次爲勘災而來、槪未往竭、小水門及北門、均用土襄疊堵、忽傳二閘崩潰、人心惶惶、其實二閘雙孔洞决口、（涵洞出險、）高升橋被漫、計决處面積一丈二尺、水頭一丈、向柴米河泥溢、地方人士、迭開緊急會議、要求淮邳叚工務所、啟放雙金閘板、梁總指揮部、亦派特務團前往搶險、水逹南門小街、（按南門之水、半由寶應高郵湖水頂托所致、並非完全决口之水也、）見災民無數搶修舊有營圩、爲暫時避水之計、城外一片大水、禾苗淹没、牲畜漂流、房屋墳墓、俱被冲毁、死亡確數、未能詳查、遙計目下無家可歸、嗷嗷待斃者、當逾二三萬戶、東圩門外、運河南岸何家巷地方、堤工於前日潰决、一時扶老携幼、人聲鼎沸、三江鄉長李君萬　、鳴鑼集衆、約五百人搶險、幸未成大災、</p>
<p>翌日乘驢至淮城、計三十里、沿途河岸、間有新修之處、淮西自高良澗至運河西堤、楊家廟至太平南隄、縱横各數十里、圩田僅持秋收一季、因洪湖水漲、挾勢東趨、白馬湖及運河水勢飽滿、無從宣洩、貧民籽草全無、大半依樹巢居、八方半新河頭、人畜死屍、飄浮水面、傷心慘目、筆不勝書矣、</p>
<p>由淮城至寶應、經過二舖平橋、計八十里、買舟而下、水溜船高、帆如箭發、西望大湖、一白無際、土堤幾與水平、湖田盡成澤國、老弱溺斃者、不可數計、其有未被淹死而逃出者、均在河之西岸、搭蓆居住、蜿蜒數十里、咸爲災民唯一之安身處、婦挽其夫、兒携其母、鳩形鵠面、待哺尤殷、東望則寶應孤城、如居鍋底、岌岌有陷城之危、運堤間斷新加土埝、寛不過三尺、水距土埝、低者尺餘、浩浩蕩蕩、危險萬分、所幸連日東南風、尙可施工運石、加料壓土、晝夜防守、一遇西北風、則湖水三五丈、潮頭陡起、白浪滔天、如移山倒海、百餘里外、沙石捲來、如鹽·阜·泰·東·興·各縣、莫不頓成澤國河湖一片、與海接連、設有不測、則滄海桑田、又易局面、實河患較江患爲烈、防患以高寶最險、果河堤潰决、其害可及數千里之遙、經過歷史、載諸高寶縣志、非妄言也、</p>
<p>寶應至高郵、百二十里、其運堤亦間有新修者、河水已高過舊堤、而新加浮土、堤工單薄、爲水冲蕩、亦至可慮、</p>
<p>是日庽城外御馬頭、時至夜半、一時鳴鑼搶險聲、婦儒哀號聲、不絕於耳、守岸農民、羣起搶險、五里壩忽被水冲開、三壩開後、上河水勢、較前略小二寸、下河水勢、忽漲八尺有奇、水到之處、破圩極多、最慘者高廟圩、距壩僅里許、首當其衝、水過屋頂、淹死人畜無數、樹間尙聞生人呼籲黃口白髮、孀婦孤兒、或呻吟於道旁、或呼號於兩岸、傷心滿目、慘不忍聞、</p>
<p>搭郵船南下、至邵伯登岸、其堤新修約八里許、前以水勢高漲、加築子埝、刻以水位繼高、前項子埝、已失禦水功効、因之連日復加工三尺、（自南大王廟至北板廠）昭關壩附近三溝水誌、以上游增漲關係、漲至二丈二尺五寸、水位之高、實打破歷屆紀錄、此次經過各地、無處無災民、其涙盈於睫、哽不成聲者、比比皆是也、</p>

<p>今歲之大小、患在普遍、雖三壩齊開、一時不易宣洩、若論江北災情、高寶爲重、因其地位本居湖濱、田廬漂没、人畜流離、仁者善士、若不急起圖救、則盈千累萬無衣無食無住之災黎、又將何以圖存乎、</p>

<p>▲奪標之經過</p>
<p>余錢旣各勝二次、昨日乃相逢作决戰、余以直落三大敗錢而獲錦標、</p>
<p>▲上塲聲勢余先發球、竟以凈四勝第一局、復連勝二局、三比○佔極對優勢、氣槪凶凶、不可一世、錢受此一挫亦以凈四奪回一局、繼成五比二、余田光不慌不忙、以六比三勝第一盤、</p>
<p>▲難解難分錢發漲、勝一局、聲勢似前爲振、三比一領前、惜又連失三局、幸再勝二局、仍以五比四勝、在此緊要關頭、不能再勝、任余造五比五、六比五後、余突勝三局、以八比六再勝第二盤、</p>
<p>▲形勢已非錢旣失二局、形勢已非、余田光四比二佔先、雖進上一局爲四比三、卒不能維持而以六比三又敗、余共以三比○勝、</p>
<p>▲表演之比較</p>
<p>論穏健余勝錢多多、錢昨日已較少火氣、然因過於小心、表演反差、發球之雙錯誤、常使已勝之局敗績、不勝可惜、第二盤甚佳、時以近遠不一之球勝余、雖常欲攔網、然有機時、終以缺乏重力而歸無效者甚多、余田光之長抽、甚可取、且有策略、第三盤之第三局、曾以極準之對角抽球、使錢滿跑疲於奔命、掌聲大起、觸網野球均少於錢、而於危急中能挽成勝局、尤非易事、昨日勝錢、尙綽有餘也、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>南洋的橡皮事業</p>
<p>南洋的橡皮事業。異常發逹。旅客們倘從新加坡搭火車往檳榔嶼。歷時七個鐘點。經行之地。在三百英里以外。你可於車窗中看見連綿不斷的橡皮樹。竟没有一分鐘瞧不到的。那橡皮樹之多。也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>意外的幸運</p>
<p>瑞士日内瓦Geneva城一家美術店中。有一天來了一位旅客。出五先令的代價。買去一張塵封灰積而很齷齪的小油畫。作爲此游的紀念品。回去時抺凈汚塵。却大喜過望。原來這畫實是意大利大畫家藍尼G·Ｒeni氏的作品、在巿上不易多得。倘賣與識者、可發一注小財。</p>

<h3>淸道人請客與冒鶴亭出京</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>臨川淸道人。長辭賓朋。忽忽已十一年。日内又爲其六十五冥壽矣。憶其寓滬鬻藝時。工於作客。而不一作主人。某日爲人作書。得潤甚厚。忽折柬宴客於酒樓。朋儕莫不相詫。詩人兪愙士爲詩嘲之曰。鬻書漸有垂靑意。請客都得喫白看。上館也知俄頃事。在家容易出家難。道人見之莞然。兪詩之韻。蓋出於冒鶴亭出京之詩也。民國元二之交。士大夫留滯舊都頗衆。貧無所歸。冒氏自命遺老。與二三詩友結社。飲酒唫詠。相約以不受民國官職爲高。其名片大書前淸四品京堂。無何。授甌海關監督。冒不知所可。委屈就職。出都時。某君於車站言曰。吾儕來送遺老出山耳。冒賦詩解嘲。中有四句云。文章那有黃金賣。時輩多將白眼看。餓死也知俄頃事。一身容易一家難。靦然解嘲。其心良苦。一日。兪氏語其家屬。生計日艱。遭世屯厄。何以度日。將來更莫能收束。其姬人曰。除非絕應酬不請客耳。若長治久安。惟有素食。最爲節省。如是則撙節匪鮮。兪仿冒詩解之曰。淸油自比豬油賤。胖子休同瘦子看。喫素也知俄頃事。一家容易一身難。順手拈來。足見匠心。</p>
<h3>災賑之我見</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>治水之法。鯀堙洪水。禹濬畎澮距川。堙·塞也。濬·深也。深其畎澮。以通於川。故禹能平治天下。而鯀則九載績用弗成。蓋負薪以塞瓠子。捧土以塞孟津。皆不過爲治標之策。非治本也。今閱水災報吿。莫不言水面高出海面。是以决而爲災。夫水性就下。所貴因勢利導。故益稷謨注。九州名川。通之於海。正義以小注大。故從畎遂溝洫。乃以入澮。澮入於川。川入於海。是以禹之治水。但盡力乎溝洫。賢於鯀者。只在此耳。今乃集視線於上游。而不一顧下游之地。譬之自來水管。失其關鍵。而窨溝已塞。水乃盈溢乎中庭。當此之際。欲堵塞其來源。勢必不及。則惟通其淤塞。以資排洩。地下本有溝渠。自不致以鄰爲壑。惟如鄰溝亦已早塞。則惟合力以通其塞。務使通出馬路總溝。入於黃浦而後止。决不致有黃浦倒灌之虞也。今議開壩。而被阻撓者。猶之鄰溝已塞。以致引起恐慌。然使鄰人袖手。不肯合力以通其溝。則泛濫波及。亦必不能避免。故爲今之計。惟有迅速以工代賑。率此災民。馳赴下游。與當地之民合作。濬其畎澮。以防禍水之至。其辦法。即仿周禮匠人之制。一夫之力。所掘祗以廣半尺爲度。二人爲耦。自上而下行。一耦之伐。廣尺深尺。謂之甽。而在田首者倍之。廣宜二尺。深二尺。是謂之遂。所以蓄甽水也。另以九夫爲井。井間廣四尺。深四尺。謂之溝。以承甽遂下游之水。每方十里爲成。成間廣八尺。深八尺。謂之洫。以承溝水。每方百里爲同。同間廣二尋。深二仭。謂之澮。於是專逹於川。自川而注於海。其着手之初。必以一日之功。先成一里以爲式。里爲式。然後可以傳衆力。使各分濬下游。各鄉各邑。莫不於此一時。盡力乎溝洫。則雖决汝漢以排淮泗。無不可自溝洫入川。而注於海。正與上述通窨溝之理同也。夫以一夫之力。祗掘廣半尺深一尺之地。一往無前。其成功實至神速。假令有千夫一日之功。其進展之里程。殆與行軍無異。掘起泥土。即准其旁。用爲防埂。以保田畝。則曩容一尺水者。今可容三尺。水因分散而勢殺。由巨浸化爲細流。分途而出。正與災民分組而爲工。自不致於爲患。將來若遇旱荒。即可引此水灌田。是爲周禮稻人之功。固良法也。當此哀鴻徧野。棲止無所。覔食不得之際。若以一人而率十人。分途爲疏濬溝澮之功。即以賑欵。用作工食。但就下游固有之田溝水道。濬而深之。正不必學而後能。而治標治本之策。亦即兩全於此。不解何以不出此途。而徒駭歎乎水面之高出於海。知大難之將至。而不謀平治之方。徒效乎鯀。而不取法乎禹。豈所謂當局者迷。旁觀者淸耶。江海不逆細流。竊願當局者不以斯言爲河漢。則動員令下。河伯望風而靡、其利直可千載。又豈徒在此一時哉。（却酬）</p>
<h3>跳舞新紀錄</h3>
<p>— 姚英</p>
<p>巴黎最近舉行跳舞耐久競賽會。得勝者名塔特史德來。計舞七百五十二小時。又麥木仁氏與法蘭西少女福蘭同舞。結果名列第一。得獎一百金旁。</p>
<p>當他們宣佈不再跳的時候。那少女已經穿破了二十雙舞鞋。靑年亦掉換了八雙。列亞軍的是一對靑年舞侣。在他們前一日停止。因他的舞伴的腿筋吊了。</p>
<p>他們跳時的音樂。是用電器傳聲片伴奏。在每一點鐘内許可休息十五分鐘。不分晝夜。此次盛大的跳舞會。發起人除了獎品開支之外。尙盈餘一千六百金鎊。</p>
<h3>名伶佳片小評</h3>
<p>— 少卿</p>
<p>邇來灦病發作。困於蝸居。心煩慮亂。不知所云。幸有友人假以高亭公司新片數十種。臥聽旬日。疾爲之瘳。唱能療疾奇矣。因作小評以當謝醫云耳。</p>
<p>楊小樓郝壽臣合唱連環套。旗鼓相當。工力悉敵。一個咳吐殊玉。一個叱咤風雲。對白謹嚴。令聞者眉飛色舞。馬連良尙小雲合唱探母回令。桑園會。謂高聲逸。字斟句酌。不落恒蹊。豈同凡響。裘桂仙尙小雲王少樓合唱二進宫。鐵板銅琶。間以晚風殘月。宫商競奏。各逞才情。雪艶琴盤絲洞廻龍閣。如美女簪花。好鳥鳴春。妙音天然。不假粉飾。雪艶琴王少樓合唱梅龍鎭。聲調新奇。韻味深長。荀慧生新劇還珠吟。以古人長短句詩。譜成四平調。立意新奇。音節曼妙。創新腔者。可資參考。劉天華敎授南胡獨奏。病中吟空山鳥語。此是創作。名貴異常。妙在曲中有情。沁脾悅耳。此外大鼓有劉寶全之鬧江州單刀會慷慨激昂。白雲鵬之黛玉焚稿纒綿悱惻。老倭瓜之牷娃娃滑稽可喜。彈詞有沈儉安薛筱卿之珍珠塔。夏荷生之三笑。王美玉之楊柳靑等。宛轉動人。佳片尙多。不勝枚舉。皆高亭新片行將發售者也。</p>

<h3>印度遊記（八七）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>婆羅門所以有勢力者。非但其敎義也。其外護之組織。甚爲重要。即階級制度也。彼用嚴寗之方法。以組成政敎社會系統。使之弱而不可犯。外敎不能破之。殊可怪也。至其敎義。則華嚴之曼衍廣大。大日如來各經之荒渺神秘。多神一神無神之竊奇幽曲。與惟識法相之詰屈敖牙。皆從印度敎演成者耳。惟其階級制一端頗有問題耳。印度敎義。蓋世界之新象也。誰能竊詰之。若有甘地首領以運用政治經濟。蓋未可量也。</p>
<p>近少年多願破壞其階級制者。而余見反對之議論擁護階級制者。亦似有理。蓋不澈底之原理。盧信先生大著所以有價値也。吾將奈大白牛之敎何哉。</p>
<p>雖然。吾中國之牛均黃牛黑牛。而乏白牛。吾若從印度歸華。必買而白牛以歸也。大白牛者。代表印度之文明。大可笑也。</p>
<p>印少年亦稍有倡自由戀愛者。然又遇一大梗。則階級制神話之血淸主義。印人信神。欲接近於神。必講種類。故婆羅門種最貴。乃易接近於神。即非此種亦不可與他族通婚。因彼族之血統。久與神接爲最貴。雖然。將來科學日進。當可破此驕傲也。</p>
<p>余寫此段。述新婆羅門敎之大勢力。非余意料所及。夢想不到。因余多年輕視此敎。及來印度。又輕視其階級制。當然又冷笑其科牛之俗。雖然。自訪甘地後。及再讀甘地傳。與從印度各方面觀察。乃感而書此。印度文化能復興如此。吾意中國人士亦當注意及之。勿爲人奴隸。而且不可太淺薄。研究須深通世界文化學術。以資建設也。老年者勿固守。少年者勿淺薄。則庶幾矣。有詩爲證。印度文明大白牛。（詳於法華經）深深悲願釋恩仇。東方新象今何在。蹴起風雲俱樂洲。（佛經大同社會學）楚雖三戶必亡秦。大地佛徒無一人。讀罷拜侖哀希臘。摩娑舍衛幾沾巾。（拜侖英詩人。慕希臘文化。助其獨立而戰死。）百感沈吟讀拜侖。詩腸俠骨是天民。奉身麈刹（楞嚴語）恩須報。仗義共扶文化輪。</p>

<h3>女人女人（二六）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>丁小姐也忘記了替自己怨恨，憤怒，但更怨恨，更憤怒，爲了在泥水中給小榮拖着走的小榮的妻子。伊眼看着那殘忍的强者和屈服的弱者之間的異乎尋常的衝突，畢竟把給與弱者的同情之火燃熾了。伊也衝了出去，冒着雨，在呼號，意思是希求着任何人的援助。秋子也跟在後面，一邊發狂地呌喊，一邊迅捷地奔走。但對於小榮的暴行是並不曾發生絲毫的阻碍。</p>
<p>天黑暗得像夜，何况在大雨中，這一段馬路上又是冷淸得没有一個行人，小榮依然用力拖着他的妻子向前奔走，漫無目的地向前奔走。</p>
<p>走過了幾百步路，在地上的小榮的妻子已經不再有抵抗的表示，但小榮在此時是絕不覺得他自身的憤怒以外的一切了，他氣吽吽地依舊拖着他的妻子向前奔走，到了四叉路口。</p>
<p>突然地，一輛汽車從横的馬路中飛駛過去，雖然有幾聲喇叭的警吿，但對於小榮是没有用的，何况在雷雨中，天又黑暗得像夜，於是小榮給汽車撞倒了。</p>
<p>丁小姐最先就瞧見這一幕新的慘劇的發生，立刻和秋子奔了過去。汽車已經停了下來，把地上倒着的兩個人抬了上車，預備送到醫院裏去。雖然在小榮的身上發現了許多的鮮血，但丁小姐是没有一些憐惜，祇看見小榮的妻子已經晕厥了，倒覺得十分的難過。</p>
<p>接着，在醫院中，小榮是終於受着自然的懲罰，在極痛苦的呻吟中離開了這個罪惡的世界。小榮的妻子却不過是受了一些驚嚇和剌激，醫治了幾天便恢復原狀。</p>
<p>丁小姐在家裏先得到了小榮死去的消息，—是秋子去探聽得來的—也暗暗地背人流涙，爲自己的不幸的遭遇流涙。</p>
<p>小榮的妻子也只有仍舊回到了丁小姐那裏來。丁小姐對於伊，似乎很憐惜又似乎很抱歉；就把小榮以前給伊的那個鑽戒去兌換了錢，自己又另外送了伊一些衣服之類的東西，打發伊回到蘇州家裏去。小榮的妻子一方面儘自流着眼涙，一方面却非常感謝。但是，這感謝是丁小姐良心上所不敢領受的。</p>
<p>不久，學校裏開學了。學生中少了陸先生和丁小姐兩個人。李文耀打了一個電話到同孚路丁家去，電話局裏說「那邊的電話已經拆去了。」</p>
<p>後來李文耀又自己去過一次，但丁家大門上已經掛上了一塊召租的牌子。（完）</p>

<h3>紗花紗巿仍然無起色</h3>
<p>紗巿晨漲午跌、趨勢依然不振、世界棉業異常悲觀、三品紗跌勢亦熾、壓力尙重、投機者多數傾向抛出、至於大戶則進近出遠、而四川帮現紗需要尙稱發逹、然人心未能震動、因環境不良、大勢狀况積重難返、而海外巿况無大漲力、所以價格一高、出者較衆、不過紗巿比較與花巿不同、或能堅硬一點、亦未可知、</p>
<p>▲人標晨優午劣人標前巿開盤、以美棉微漲、形勢薄弱、人心尙平、惟實銷良好、巿氣較緊、各月漲四·五·六錢、午後聞三品紗大跌、人心大疲、各月跌七·八九錢至一兩一錢、成交計二萬七千八百包、查賣出同餘一千○五十包、公泰七百五十包、長豐一千○五十包、買進梅記一千六百五十包、天隆四百包、義餘五百五十包、利昌五百五十包、兹將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉巿乏力</h3>
<p>棉巿殊弱、以美印棉價較廉、各洋行在巿極力兜售、然接受者殊爲缺乏、諸廠商鑒於國外過剩、使人心寒慄、皆抱觀望態度、至於美棉因生産豐富、反動上漲力較爲薄弱、所以大戶依然抛賣、而據日商消息、美棉出産又增八九十萬之說、如果證實、尙有劇變之慮、又某洋行買辦因營業不振、業已失踪、有印棉五萬件、在某銀行做押、此貨大槪削價、售於華廠矣、</p>

<h3>糧食厚薄粳回跌三角</h3>
<p>▲南巿昨各帮來源依然不斷、且浦存尙厚、城鄉店銷、際此秋熱、巿上作客稀少、胃納揀鮮稍取、厚粳薄稻各跌三角、早稻貨因銷懈改短角許、蘆洋尖高料貨甚薄、略形堅定、宿次銷呆疲態、陰化貨稀胃平、勢歸穏定、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨日米巿仍在呆滯狀態中、裏路來源尙湧、近來到貨、蘇常二帮尤多、人心難好、存積豐厚、蘇州河畔重船截至昨日午後止、共有一百餘號、總計存米額在二萬五千石光景、各店號去胃更覺淡薄、早間各貨開盤皆趨疲、去路僅洋蘆尖尙活、</p>
<h3>洋米又有電詢交易</h3>
<p>昨日洋米巿况、形居定勢、因洋米巿存不多、而本街胃口轉活、客帮實化停頓、久無大批去路、巿面乃無榮辱、昨日統巿由本街辦去小絞一千一百包、價十三八角、一號西貢一百二十包、價十四元八角半、其他均無成交、洋米産地價雖已跌落、但與申巿尙難合划、邇日洋行雖有兜售、但價高者無吃戶、而低價電報則無覆准、昨日又由三井洋行打出小絞電報七百噸、九月裝船、價六兩四錢半、又同興泰轉准即裝五百噸、價六兩五錢半、惟因先付定銀關係、反爲無人過問云</p>
<h3>期粉賣氣大熾</h3>
<p>▲各月暴跌三分許</p>
<p>昨日期粉開巿後、巿上復有美國借欵裝麥之說、賣方抛售甚健、多頭心虚降服、行情立見逐盤下跌、後廠家與客帮亦有抛售、雖洋麥報大二三角、空頭亦有抵補、而跌風仍不稍殺、午後有接近政界之客戶售出、賣方氣燄更熾、收巿價本月份小三分、九月小二分二五、十月份小二分半、十一月份小二分七五、十二月份小二分半、一月份小二分七五云、</p>
<h3>期現麥都呈小象</h3>
<p>昨日小麥巿况、現麥廠胃觀望、統巿開出千餘包、爲崑山·無錫·揚州·太倉等麥、麥品較高、售價反小二三分、乃因巿上盛傳政府美國借欵已將成爲事實、致人心虚弱、而期麥開巿後、亦受此影響下落、收巿價本月小四分、九·十·十一·十二各月份各小三分、一月份亦小四分云、</p>
<h3>絲茶黃白廠經歐銷難暢</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲巿、仍難轉暢查海外巿塲、因各絲織廠暑假開工、生絲廠銷活動、而華絲開價仍小、絲電雖有轉滬、華商絲本不敷、成交寥落、昨祇信孚等進滬白廠經二十包、開利進黃廠經十包、價均堅定云、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉法銷活動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶巿、蝥源·屯溪等路之珍眉綠茶、法國巿塲又有來電需求、永興·協和·錦隆·同孚等行進意濃厚、惟華茶商鑒於存底枯薄、不願讓價求售、故交易未能十分見旺、針眉秀眉等項、巿面續俏、祁門紅茶、英莊怡和洋行亦復開辦、惟認價苛緊、巿盤又跌五六兩云、</p>

<h3>五金英白鐵行情重提</h3>
<p>英白鐵近來又趨活動、故巿塲點綴爲數可觀昨日開出共有八九百担、而購戶多爲福建·天津兩帮、長江路則因水大、已無胃口、行情二十二號售十五兩二錢半、二十四號十五兩七錢半、二十六號十六兩二十八號十六兩五錢、三十一號十七兩云、</p>

<h3>印度的毒蛇</h3>
<p>— 富蘭</p>
<p>印度的毒蛇、向來著聞世界、就中有名羅賽兒Russell的、不論矌地、路旁叢林、屋角、到處可以遇到、他的神氣、雖則說不出的可怕、但他的確是一種美麗的蛇、他的顔色、是深褐和淡褐相間着、加上一排一排的深暗色的椭圓斑點、他也和别的毒蛇一般、喜歡負暄在暖熱的陽光下面、他的脾氣、又懶又狠、些不怕人、他止住在一處地方之後、要想去移動他分毫、他必定使展出十二分的抵抗力來、他的主要食品、便是老鼠、大凡蛇　一年之中、不知要摧殘多少鼠類、關於這一點、好像蛇是替人類服務、因爲人類所遭老鼠的損失、實在很大、總之不論那一種動物、不論他那樣兇毒、終究也有一樣好處、來平衡他的罪過、人們認定一種動物有害於人、便千方百計想斬盡他的根株、或是認定一種動物有益於人、便多方誘導養育、結果違反自然界互相尅制的原則、到底仍舊害了人們自己、</p>
<p>一切的爬虫類、都是卵生、内裏面也有幾種、尤其是毒蛇、樹蛇、以及一切海蛇、他們的卵、是在母體裏孵化、所以也和胎生一般、羅賽兒蛇爲最著名的産子蛇之一、曾有一尾雌、養在孟買博物史社的博物院中。接連産生六十三尾小蛇、都蠕動着一條不死、說到羅賽兒蛇、長足之後、最長不過五英寸至六英寸、此外像鋸尺蛇、極少有長到一呎以上的、但是這小小的周圍裏、實蓄貯着罪孽無數、鋸尺蛇在印度遍地皆有、而在乾燥的沙土區域、尤其來得普通、經他咬過的人、遭着不治的、約占全數百分之二○、但在數處地方、如孟買等城巿、每年人口死於蛇咬的、委實不在少數、這大半是爲了蛇類喜歡負暄在空矌塲合的緣故、</p>
<p>鋸尺蛇在印度蛇類中、要算最會挑釁的了、性情乖僻、只要些微裏慈動他、便立刻發起威來、好像要喫人一般、關在博物院籠子裏的、只要人們站在或走過他的傍邊、便抖起來、啾啾呌着、似乎和人相駡、這些毒蛇、着手攻擊的時候、設定一種十分巧妙的軍略、將身體盤成雙圈、只露出頭部、這些盤圈、是繼續不斷地移動、繼續不斷地互相磨擦着、因此發出沙沙的聲音、在地脅腹部、給像錫狀的條尺遮蓋着、中間作鋸齒形、所以出名呌做鋸尺蛇、他的身體一移動、接獨隆起的鋸尺、便發出一種很可聽的怒聲、繼之以不斷的呌着、敏疾地擺動着舌頭、和突然地把頭前伸、神氣煞是可怕、</p>
<p>鋸尺蛇的顔色、種種不同、普通完全和他的環境相調和、在沙地中的蛇、一半展臥在沙土之中、他的顔色、和沙土一般無二、很難去探踪他、此外還有一種棕色樹蛇、顔色和標記、與鋸尺蛇非常相像辨别之法、只有從頭部着手、鋸尺蛇的頭部、給許多小人形的條紋包圍、正和他的身子一般、至於棕樹蛇的頭部、闊而扁平、和他的背部完全不同、</p>
<p>有人要問、到底上述的幾種毒蛇、咬起人來、他的中毒程度有否分别、不、每椿事情、要依人體所吸收毒液的數量多少而定、有時給蛇戳進去的時候、正好没有毒液注入、或是蛇所含的毒液、正好放完、或是數量所剩無幾、不足使人體感着反應、那就即使極毒的蛇咬了人、也不受影響、反之即使完全無毒的蛇、有時咬了人、也足致他死命、在印度地方、儘有不少證據、可以證明十分無毒的蛇、咬死許多人命、這裏面的最大原因、就是驚懼、『驚恐』的殺人、比蛇毒更加來得快、牠的兇毒的感應、在身體上起的很速、能使人體感着和蛇毒一般的影響、</p>
<p>本來蛇的毒液的原始功用、是用以戰勝他的犧牲的、第二步的功用、是當作一種消化液、及消除自己或别的蛇的毒素用的、不過吾們要知道、這樣的消毒、是不十分完全的、乃是像種痘將毒素接種、或是用注射的方式把牠移轉過去、例如可帛拉（Crobra）毒蛇、能把羅賽兒毒蛇的毒消除、因爲没有羅賽兒能彀把可帛拉咬死、反之曾有人見過一條大可帛拉蛇、把一條普通可帛拉咬死、這是爲了大可帛拉所含的毒液很多、他的注射力又强的緣故、</p>
<p>蛇的毒液所含的毒質、旣不能用水來溶解、也不能用日光來消滅、牠是一種極複雜的液體、不能用化學來分析的、牠的毒一到了人身、運行極快、所以救濟很覺因難、紮綁傷口以上肢體、使血液停止流動、甚或實行那「毒蛇螫手壯士斷腕」的那句古話、或許可以减輕或阻止毒氣迷漫到全身、但是一遇到了致命的創毒、這些方法、没有什麽效力可言、</p>
<p>關於治蛇毒的丹方符咒、很多很多、有些人大家都以爲非常靈騐、其實遇到了毒蛇咬幾口、未必一定是致命傷、這時施用符咒、便是符咒交了好運了、在科學上說、近來發明一種血淸療法、對於某幾種蛇的毒液、可以當作解毒劑、這在醫學上立論、乃是針治蛇毒惟一的方法了、這等血淸的製造、是將多量的蛇的毒液、注射到一隻馬的血分裏去、第一次注射很少、於馬不發生甚麽影響、最後一次、差不多要十倍於原來足以毒死一馬的量、而結果那馬吸收之後、依然無恙、於是從這馬的血液製成血淸、便成爲一種强有力的解毒劑、</p>
<p>當巴黎柏斯篤學院敎授喀梅脫氏（Calmette）首次製造他的藥劑時候、他相信他對於一切毒蛇的咬、有了救濟了、那知後來證明没有這般容易、因爲每種蛇有一種特殊的毒液、用甲種蛇毒液製成的注射劑、只能施之於甲種蛇咬傷的蛇毒、不能施之於乙種蛇或丙種蛇、如果能把各種蛇的毒液、一齊收齊攏來、分别製成血淸、分别應用、纔能着手成春、但要收集這多量的毒液、以供巨獸的注射、委實難辦、除非是羅賽兒和可帛拉兩種、在印度是到處可覓、最近喀掃里的柏斯篤學院、製成一種血淸、是用可帛拉及羅賽兒兩種毒蛇的毒液混合而成、醫治任何的蛇咬、都有很好的效應、但是如果你逢着蛇咬、在不曾正式治療之前、應當先紮縛傷口的上部、只須一條手巾、就夠應用、這樣可使毒液不致立刻給全身吸收了去、如果咬處在手足等處、紮縛處應該在腕上或膝蓋上面、一面趕緊請醫生來施救、</p>

<h3>Wuhan Area River Level Unchanged Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wuchang City-Wide Electricity Outage</p>
<p>Many Died in Tragic Building Collapses</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Negotiates Loan with Banks</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river level has not risen or fallen on the 21st, and the water gauge remains at 53 feet 4 inches. In Wuchang, a house collapsed at Wusheng Gate, killing more than forty people. The Kai Zi Battalion was also flooded. This area was a shelter for disaster victims from Hankou. It is reported that over a thousand disaster victims drowned. The electricity in Wuchang is completely out, plunging the entire city into darkness. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Chamber of Commerce is negotiating a loan of two million with banks, using goods as collateral, to facilitate financial turnover. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) All U.S. warships on Chinese waters have received orders to provide full assistance to the Hankou flood. Furthermore, the Commander-in-Chief has also been ordered to send more warships to Hankou to assist the American consular officials in handling emergency relief efforts. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yesterday morning, the water in the city receded by five inches, but by last night, it rose again by two inches. Currently, there is no rise or fall. The water used to be muddy, but now it has turned bluish-black, with filthy, turbid matter and a pungent odor. In addition, the weather is extremely hot, reaching 95 or 96 degrees. With the scorching sun overhead, there is no fresh air to breathe outdoors. Japanese residences have not collapsed yet, but Chinese buildings have been submerged for over a month. Many foundations have shifted, and it is unknown when they will collapse. Moreover, the Japanese Meiji Elementary School, which is very sturdily built, can withstand the water pressure, but the entire floor has bulged out. The Jianghan Middle School, operated by the East Asia Common Culture Association, has been repeatedly battered by wind and waves and is in danger of collapsing. Currently, the authorities of the various concessions are on alert for building collapses. If a strong wind strikes, a wind disaster will follow the flood, causing even greater damage. The reservoir's levees still have a surplus capacity of one foot five inches. As long as the water volume does not increase, the danger of water cut-off can be avoided. The Japanese concession is supplied with electricity by the Chinese Street Electric Light Company, and street lights have been lit since the 19th. Food and daily necessities are mostly distributed by the civil defense corps. Donations from Shanghai are also arriving in Hankou one after another, and the Japanese residents are gradually settling down. (21st Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Association to Establish Wuhan Branch</h3>
<p>(Hankou) It is heard that the National Government Flood Relief Association will establish a branch in Wuhan, with Mr. Baker, the railway advisor who came to Hankou, consulting with political, military, commercial, and banking circles to form a joint organization. The committee will consist of thirty-two members, with seven standing committee members, and will be established at the military headquarters on the 23rd. Fang Benren and others will serve as committee members. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water Level Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>Both Upstream and Downstream Show Declines</p>
<p>Zhang Lianjia Reports to Provincial Authorities by Telegram</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River water level is relatively stable. The Luokou water gauge is 29.29 meters above sea level, dropping six inches at night and four inches this morning. Compared to the highest level of 29.3 meters on the 19th, it has dropped a total of one foot one inch. On the evening of the 20th, the upstream Linsheng Tun dropped four inches, and Sunlou dropped one foot three inches. In the midstream, Dong'a Guanzhuang dropped eight inches, and Qihe dropped three inches. This morning, the midstream Qihe Beidianzi dropped eight inches, the downstream Wangzaojia dropped one inch, and the Sunjia dropped one inch. River Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia telegraphed the provincial government to report that today the Shuozhou water level is calm, and Luokou has dropped one foot. All sections report water level declines. If the rise does not continue, the project may be safe. Zhang returned from the upstream on the evening of the 20th and went to the upstream again this morning for inspection. Qingcheng's Chief County Magistrate Bai Zi and the Public Security Bureau were reprimanded by the province for ineffective disaster relief. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) River Affairs Bureau Director Lianjia went to the downstream to inspect the river works. Today, he telegraphed the provincial government from Lijin Damajia, stating that all the work stations along the way are not strained. The levee at Dao Xu and Wang Wangzhuang on the south bank of the Putai County border has water seeping out at the lower sections by only two feet. The same is true for the levee at Lijin Xiaolizhuang. Of all the works and Qing embankments, eight or nine out of ten are overflowing, with water depths ranging from two to three feet, all sufficient to cause slippage. Fortunately, the foundation of the main dam was reinforced and is secure, preventing any missteps. He has ordered all sections to cut willow branches, bundle pillows, and add pressure with sacks for relief. There is no major danger at present. However, the downstream river water has not yet receded, and he urges that an urgent telegram be sent to the public security bureau chiefs and county magistrates of the counties along the river, instructing them to station personnel at the works regularly to supervise the laborers, ascend the levees to inspect the water, and assist the soldiers in rushing to protect them to avoid negligence. In addition, the dangerous work at Beidianzi, forty miles northwest of Luokou, is temporarily stable after being rushed to protect it. In the afternoon, the Luokou water gauge dropped two inches and is now 29.27 meters above sea level. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Relief Committee Petitions for Implementation of Water Management Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Relief Committee stated that the unprecedented flood disaster suffered by the entire country was due to the lack of water management and petitioned the government to postpone all non-urgent construction projects and implement the water management plan in advance as a fundamental relief measure to stabilize the people's livelihood.

(5) Distribute cash or rice, flour, and mixed grains, depending on the local situation. (6) When the relief work in each county is completed, it should be announced to the public to demonstrate transparency. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Implementation of Huai River Diversion Project in Early October</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Huai River diversion project is scheduled to begin implementation in early October, and it is estimated that it can accommodate at least 10,000 workers, which is a good opportunity to provide relief through work.

<h3>Reporters' Association Requests Bail for Liu and Wu</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 5:00 PM on the 21st, the reporters' association went to the Garrison Headquarters to see Gu Zhenglun regarding the arrest of Liu Ziren and Wu Huinong of the Minzhi Daily, requesting that they be granted bail first.

<h3>Russian Petroleum Merchants Building Oil Tanks in Harbin</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The diplomatic community received a telegram from Harbin stating that the Soviet Russian Petroleum Trust has recently signed a contract with the Chinese company Fuxing (transliteration) to build oil storage facilities in Harbin, worth 600,000 Japanese yen. It is said that this facility is only the initial stage of the Russian merchants' large-scale plan. The competition between Russian oil and the oil industries of Britain and the United States in northern Manchuria has lasted for a long time, but judging from the Russian merchants' recent active planning and construction of oil storage facilities, it seems that they intend to monopolize the oil industry in northern Manchuria. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nature of Maritime Court</h3>

<h3>Qingdao Municipal Government Sends Telegram Detailing the Truth of Japanese Violence</h3>

(21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to receive a telegram from Qingdao today stating that on the evening of the 18th, a conflict occurred between Japanese residents and Chinese people gambling on Liaoning Road, and they invited foreigners from the Japanese Kokusuikai (National Essence Society) to carry knives, sticks, and other weapons to beat people along the road, which was clearly a provocation. More than ten Chinese people were injured, and the public was outraged. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) In the case of the Japanese killing Chinese in Qingdao, although the Japanese side fabricated facts and engaged in counter-propaganda in an attempt to expand the incident, according to the report from the German doctor's diagnosis, ten Chinese people were seriously or slightly injured, all with knife wounds, while the Japanese only had skin injuries. This seems to indicate that the Japanese carried weapons and intended to riot. In addition, the Japanese alarmed themselves and telegraphed the Yamazato warship to Qingdao for protection. The warship has now arrived in Qingdao. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Discussion of Fundamental Issues in Education Going Forward (3)</h3>
<p>The reason for proposing the third issue is that its central meaning lies in the hope of establishing the direction and purpose of education, making it suitable for reality, suitable for the modern age, and especially suitable for the common needs of our nation, society, and people today. The illness of our country today lies in poverty. The illness of our people lies in ignorance. The knowledge and skills that do not lead to production are ignorance. Poverty and ignorance manifest on the surface of society as chaos, disturbances, and all kinds of natural and man-made disasters. Therefore, the task of education today is not to merely transplant educational principles, doctrines, and school systems from the East and West that do not fit our national conditions and reenact them in our country. Nor is it to create a few outstanding individuals to decorate the facade. Rather, it is to impart practical knowledge and skills to the people that are suitable for survival, enabling individuals to support themselves and the nation and society to enter the path of construction and evolution. However, what education demonstrates today is that university education is merely a decoration for a few wealthy children, merely a ladder for wealthy children to enter officialdom and seek fame and fortune. Because its purpose is only decoration, education is lax, and scholars are dissolute. Electing a "queen" has even become fashionable. Indulging in singing and dancing has also become a trend. Because its purpose is to engage in politics, schools have become arenas for competition, becoming practice grounds for political struggles. Rejecting this and welcoming that, waves of unrest arise one after another. As for middle schools, they lack independence altogether, seemingly purely for preparing for entering university. Because they are purely for preparing for entering university, what is learned is isolated from practical life and is purely decorative knowledge from books. Because they lack independence, apart from a few wealthy children who can enter university to fulfill their dreams of decorating their facade and seeking fame and fortune, the majority who cannot afford to go to university become highly educated idlers who are incapable of anything and useless. The strong then take risks and break the law, while the weak become disillusioned with life and commit suicide. Someone once criticized the education of the past twenty years as changing native Eight-legged essays into foreign Eight-legged essays, changing native imperial examinations into foreign imperial examinations, becoming decorations for young ladies and young masters, amusement for gentry and gentlemen, and having no connection with ordinary people, nor even with the lives of those who receive education. This kind of bold exposure certainly refers to the situation of the previous five or six years. However, if we try to examine the actual situation of the education sector today, if we do not force ourselves to cover it up, whether there has been any progress in the past five years, we will probably be ashamed and unable to answer. In plain terms, education today pulls young people out of society and separates them from practical life, rather than guiding young people into society to solve all the problems of themselves and society. It raises young people's desire for life, leading them into the dead end of extravagance, incompetence, and uselessness, rather than guiding young people onto the path of production and construction. Therefore, the more we educate, the poorer the country becomes, the more chaotic the social order becomes, and the more the people suffer. The declaration of the vocational education conference states, "Eight or nine out of ten bandits today are soldiers. Eight or nine out of ten communists are school graduates." Young people feel the same lack of a way out and are stimulated by the difficult environment of life, and their thinking changes accordingly. In the past two years, "ideological national crisis" has been an undeniable fact, but the authorities do not seek solutions in education (and of course, education alone cannot solve it), but only resort to politics. The stricter the political controls, the more the crowds with no way out become agitated and deteriorate. Education has lost its effectiveness, but educators still continue to engage in education "for the sake of education." This phenomenon is extremely painful. If we do not seek ways to improve in the future, young people will never have a way out, and the thinking of young people will never be resolved. "The people do not fear death, why threaten them with death?" Where will strict laws and harsh punishments be applied? Of course, the creation of this phenomenon is not only due to education. In short, the mission of education is to seek progress in reality, to pursue ideals that are higher and farther than reality. Reality is like this, how can educators shirk their responsibility? This is why this reporter has proposed the third issue.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>British Finances Urgent, London Meetings Busy</h3>
<p>Conservative Party Emphasizes Spending Cuts</p>
<p>Trades Union Congress Advocates New Taxes</p>
<p>Three-Party Deliberations Fail to Reach Agreement</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 20th: The Cabinet has decided on its economic program. Today, cabinet members are spending the day trying to ascertain the extent to which the House of Commons and the country support their plan. The government's proposal only announces the main points in a closed-door meeting, but the differences of opinion between cabinet members and trade unions have spread widely. This afternoon, the Cabinet Economic Committee, the Administrative Council of the Trades Union Congress, and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party held a joint meeting. Shortly afterwards, the Administrative Council of the Trades Union Congress and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party held separate meetings. Henderson attended the Executive Committee meeting. Macdonald and cabinet members seemed pleased after consulting with key members of their party, giving the impression that things were progressing smoothly. Labour MP Hayter told a Reuters reporter that the Prime Minister and the Advisory Committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party began discussions this morning and have now concluded. After the joint meeting of the Administrative Council of the Trades Union Congress and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, a brief statement was issued stating that members of the Cabinet Economic Committee attended the meeting. Macdonald and Snowden briefly described the urgency of the nation's finances and reported on the principles of the government's balanced budget proposal. After the joint meeting, the National Executive Committee met on its own to consider the situation reported by cabinet members at the joint meeting. Henderson and Klein spoke in succession, and the meeting decided to listen to the government. Conservative Party spokesman Hall said that when he and Neville Chamberlain met with the Prime Minister today, they both argued that to solve the financial crisis, the focus should be on spending cuts rather than new taxes. The Conservative Party believes that the financial panic is due to huge expenditures. The discussions among representatives of the three parties at the Prime Minister's residence were informal in nature and covered a wide range of topics, but they have not yet reached a stage that could be considered satisfactory to the Conservative Party. Rumor has it that the Administrative Council of the Trades Union Congress is dissatisfied with the cabinet's economic proposals. This rumor seems to be confirmed by the official announcement of the Union Council. According to its announcement, the Administrative Council will send a delegation to the Cabinet tonight to present its views. It is widely believed that the Administrative Council will request another conversation with the Cabinet Economic Committee. The content of the economic proposals is kept secret on all sides, but there seems to be no doubt that there is a large difference in views between the Union Council and the government. It is said that the focus of the disagreement is the proposal to revise the unemployment relief system. The so-called revision may not necessarily mean reducing relief, but may refer to increasing workers' contributions. There is now reason to believe that tax regulations are not included in the proposal. Of the five representatives sent by the Union Council to meet with the Cabinet Committee, four had previously spoken in favor of tax regulations. From this news, it can be generally seen that the Union Council Executive Committee probably stated today that it would prefer tax regulations to spending cuts. However, Snowden, the iron-fisted Finance Minister, is extremely opposed to tax regulations. It is said that the cabinet proposal also includes a restriction on transitional relief for the unemployed who have exceeded the statutory insurance period. It is also said that although the Conservative Party has not publicly declared it, it is not satisfied with the government's proposal because the austerity measures it has proposed are not enough to cope with the difficulties. Today has been very busy, with meetings here just finishing and meetings there starting again, rotating endlessly, and all kinds of rumors are spreading in the air. But tomorrow will be a major date for expressing fate. The Cabinet met tonight to hear Macdonald's and Snowden's reports on today's events and adjourned at 9:30 PM, scheduling another meeting for 10 AM tomorrow, at which time there will be concrete decisions. The delegation from the Trades Union Congress met with the Cabinet Economic Committee for an hour. Tomorrow, they will report to the Administrative Council on the progress of their meeting with cabinet members. After the delegation left the cabinet, the Economic Committee continued to meet until 11:15 PM, roughly to discuss the objections raised by the Trades Union Congress. In addition to the meeting of representatives of the three parties tomorrow, cabinet members must continue negotiations with people from the trade unions.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Madrid, 21st: Although the French colonial authorities are keeping silent about the news that Moroccan chieftain Abd el-Krim escaped from the island, the chieftain's subordinates are already eager to act, causing unrest in Morocco. In Spanish Morocco, the Communist Party is very active, military discipline is lax, and desertions are common. The authorities cannot stop it, and because these people often sell weapons privately to intellectuals, the plan to reduce the number of troops stationed there has been decided by the Spanish government to be temporarily postponed.</p>

<h3>Qingdao Japanese Riot Following Successive Cases of Korean Massacre</h3>
<p>▲ Prior Planning and Organization by Japanese Residents</p>
<p>▲ Ronin of the Kokusuikai Act Upon Receiving Telephone Calls</p>
<p>▲ Carrying Weapons, They Assaulted People Indiscriminately Throughout the Night</p>
<p>▲ Eleven Chinese Citizens Severely Injured</p>
<p>▲ Afterwards, Japanese Residents Requested Naval Ships to Reinforce Threats</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The blood of the Korean massacre has not yet dried, and Japanese residents in Qingdao, within our own territory, have once again resorted to brutal methods of slaughter. It seems that the Japanese believe the massacre of our overseas Chinese in Korea was insufficient and will gradually extend their actions to the Chinese mainland. I will now present a detailed investigation of the incident, divided into the following sections:</p>
<p>▲ Cause of the Incident: Last night (18th) around 8 PM, Meng Jiru, a Chinese peddler from the Yong Shun Li fish shop in Xiao Bao Island, was chatting with a cook named Liu (Chinese) from the Japanese fish shop at No. 168 Liao Ning Road. The Japanese manager of the shop, Shima Shozo, came out to stop them from chatting and forcibly drove them away. When Meng slightly protested, the Japanese man immediately took off his wooden clogs and violently beat Meng. A policeman named Ye Hengda stepped forward to mediate but was also beaten and humiliated. Many Chinese bystanders felt indignant, and some stepped forward to reason with the Japanese man, who initially ignored them. He then suddenly used the telephone to report to the Kokusuikai, summoning hundreds of Japanese thugs, each armed with knives, sticks, and other weapons, who swarmed to the scene. Thus, the tragedy unfolded.</p>
<p>▲ Circumstances of the Attack: The Kokusuikai is an organization formed by Japanese ronin residing in Qingdao. They claim to uphold the spirit of Bushido and the Yamato spirit, demanding swords and guns in the name of preserving Japanese Bushido and national essence, hence the name Kokusuikai. In reality, they are completely hostile to and oppressive towards the Chinese. It is a well-organized body, so upon Shima's telephoned request, they immediately armed themselves with knives and guns and set off en masse. Upon arrival, they slashed at any Chinese they encountered, and sent people to block traffic, preventing police from interfering, in order to achieve their goal of slaughter. At that time, there were about one thousand Chinese people outside enjoying the cool air and passing by, who, being unarmed, could not resist and suffered severe injuries from knives and sticks. Order was immediately disrupted, and the sounds of crying were unbearable. The precinct officer in charge, seeing that he could not stop it, had to report to the Public Security Bureau for instructions.</p>
<p>▲ Temporary Measures: After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately telephoned Mayor Hu. Mr. Hu, fearing a major incident, immediately ordered the security detachment to suppress the riot. Wan Yongshou, the head of the Second Public Security Bureau, also rushed to the scene with police, and together with the Japanese military police, they first dispersed both sides, then transported the eleven severely injured Chinese to the Municipal Hospital for treatment by car. The disturbance was temporarily brought under control.</p>
<p>▲ Investigation of Injuries: Today (19th) at 10 AM, the municipal government sent representatives from the Social and Public Security Bureaus, together with personnel from the Japanese consulate, to investigate the number of injured. The Chinese side was represented by Chen Wei, Section Chief of the Social Bureau; Lv Xizhi and Liu Yonglu, staff members of the Public Security Bureau; Li Gongfan, Director of the Municipal Hospital; and newspaper reporters. The Japanese side was represented by Hirayama Isamu, staff member of the Japanese Consulate, and Kannai Masanori, Director of the Kannai Hospital, and they also invited the famous German doctor, Weiss, to examine the injuries to serve as evidence. They first went to the Municipal Hospital to inspect the injuries and took statements from the injured Chinese, with Chinese and Japanese doctors as witnesses. The statements all indicated that they were passing by the area and were slashed by Japanese. The names and injuries of the injured are listed below: (1) Hu Yaonan, 21 years old, severe knife wounds on the right scapula, left chest, and below the left ear; (2) Song Benzhen, 13 years old, two knife wounds on the top of the head, six inches long, penetrating the skull; (3) Ye Hengda, 39 years old, policeman of the Public Security Bureau, contusion on the left cheek; (4) Wang Runzi, 26 years old, soldier of the Haihe gunboat of the First Fleet, knife wound on the left elbow, three-inch cut, bone broken; (5) Wang Zhixin, 29 years old, two knife wounds on the head, over two inches long, and contusion on the left knee; (6) Zhang Baoqi, 29 years old, contusion on the left foot; (7) Wang Dianzhu, 27 years old, three knife wounds on the right scapula and back, one four or five inches long, one three inches long, and one about an inch long; (8) Han Shaoqi, 33 years old, policeman of the Public Security Bureau, knife wound on the left forearm, over five inches long; (9) Zhuang Xiangfu, 28 years old, two knife wounds on the head, both penetrating the periosteum, over two inches long; (10) Zhang Jifa, 49 years old, knife wound on the right back, six or seven inches long, one inch deep, unconscious, weak pulse, possibly life-threatening; (11) Meng Jiru, 28 years old, left cheek swollen from being hit by a wooden clog.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Protests: After receiving reports from various sources, the municipal government immediately sent Councilor Zhou Jiayan to the Japanese consulate to verbally protest to the Japanese consul. In the afternoon, the Japanese consulate also protested to the municipal government in writing, based on one-sided reasons. The municipal government has refuted the claims with reasoned arguments, and at the same time, telegraphed a report of the incident to the central government, and also formally protested to the Japanese consulate in writing, roughly stating that violent gangs disrupting social order should be strictly prohibited, and including demands for punishment of the perpetrators, apology, compensation, and indemnity. (The Japanese weapons, including a long knife and bamboo sticks, wooden clubs, etc., have been handed over to the Public Security Bureau for safekeeping as evidence.)</p>
<p>▲ Responsibility Issue: The incident originated from the unreasonable obstruction by Japanese man Shima of the freedom of Chinese people to talk. First, he injured Meng Jiru with wooden clogs, and then he used the phone to invite Kokusuikai members to commit violence. Moreover, the Japanese always report incidents to the Japanese police station, but this time he did not report to the Japanese police but reported only to the Kokusuikai. The society also gathered several hundred people at night and immediately went to the scene with knives to commit violence, obviously seeming to have had prior organization and planning. Afterwards, Shima hid the cook Liu, indicating something more hidden. Moreover, the Chinese were all unarmed, with absolutely no ability to resist, so the injured were mostly stabbed from behind. Therefore, the Japanese should bear full responsibility for this incident.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Newspaper Spreads Rumors: The newspaper run by Japanese residents in this city published an extra edition today, reversing the facts, claiming that 5,000 Chinese people besieged the Kokusuikai, and that dozens of Japanese residents were severely injured, and urgently telegraphed the Japanese warship Kuma stationed in Lushun to quickly come to Qingdao for assistance, purely conducting one-sided counter-propaganda, hoping to expand the incident, which is truly hateful.

<h3>The Wanbaoshan Case in a Standoff</h3>
<p>▲ Zhong Yu Returns to Harbin and Speaks to Reporters</p>
<p>▲ Withdrawal of Police is Only One of the Preliminary Issues</p>
<p>▲ No Negotiations on Any Other Issues Have Been Held Yet</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Zhong Yu, under orders from the central government, has been negotiating the Wanbaoshan case in Jilin for almost a month. On the morning of the 14th, he returned to Harbin for business and will return to Jilin in a week to continue negotiations with Japanese Consul Ishii. In the past few days, Wang Jiazhen has been in Harbin, and he has been busy with social engagements. Reporters have visited him several times without success. It was not until 11:00 AM on the 16th that he was finally received. When asked about the progress of the Wanbaoshan case negotiations, he spoke as follows:</p>
<p>I have been away from Harbin for almost a month, traveling back and forth between Jilin and Liaoning to seek instructions and to meet with Japanese Consul Ishii. The negotiations are currently in a standoff, with no hope of progress in the near future. I am returning to Harbin for a few days to deal with urgent official matters, as I have been away for some time. I will have to return to Jilin in a week to continue negotiations. When I left Jilin, I instructed Director Shi (Luban) of the Jilin office to immediately telegraph me if he received any notification from the Japanese Consul, so that I could go there. These negotiations are more difficult because the Japanese side insists that local negotiations should be casual, and each meeting does not adhere to diplomatic norms. Regardless of whether it is related to the case or not, they simply engage in idle talk. I have met with them more than ten times, without adhering to diplomatic customs. Several times we sat and talked for eight or nine hours, from morning to evening, without even stopping to eat. Our side has consistently maintained that (1) the withdrawal of Japanese police from Majiashao and (2) the departure of Koreans from the Wanbaoshan area are preliminary matters for this negotiation. If these two matters cannot be resolved, then there is no need to discuss the issues of the case itself. The Japanese side insists that the Japanese police cannot withdraw until the case has</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>been resolved. If they withdraw, they must (1) still allow Koreans to reside in the Wanbaoshan area and must make every effort to protect them, (2) ensure that the ditches and dams at Majiashao are not damaged, so that rice can be planted and water can be drawn next year. There are many other conditions, but in short, they insist on not withdrawing immediately. On one occasion, they even demanded the leveling of the ditches and the installation of water pipes, claiming that this would be to avoid damaging farmland. I refused all of these requests. Ishii had no choice but to consult his Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which replied that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' first note contained the words "withdrawal of Japanese police, departure of Koreans, pending resolution," which was almost a command. If they were to comply, it would inevitably appear that they knew they were wrong and were showing submission. The Ministry instructed Ishii not to comply. After several more discussions, the Japanese Consul finally obtained instructions from his Ministry of Foreign Affairs, allowing the withdrawal of police, but there was no need to publish any documents, and the Japanese police would withdraw automatically and unconditionally. At the same time, Koreans would be free to move as they please, and the ditches and dams would not be leveled for the time being. Our side would unconditionally advise farmers not to riot during this period, pending negotiations. However, Changchun Japanese Consul Tashiro at this time was still unwilling to withdraw police. After Ishii negotiated with him several times, he finally agreed, and the 26 Japanese police withdrew on August 8. Before leaving, they demolished a section of the dam to release the upstream water. As for the Koreans, they will also be leaving the country in the next few days. Such is the current situation of the case negotiations. The conversations between me and Ishii reported in various newspapers are purely fabricated, because I have never made any statements to the outside world, and Ishii also agreed not to publish anything in the newspapers until a result is reached. The reports in the outside world are clearly fabrications. I have already sent letters to the newspapers to correct them. Regarding the previous negotiations, both sides have kept records as a basis for future discussions. In short, although the Japanese police have withdrawn, negotiations are just beginning. There will be many difficulties in future negotiations, because Japan considers the Wanbaoshan case to be related to its entire New Continent colonization policy, and therefore will not relax in the slightest on negotiations.

<h3>Shanxi Provincial Party Department's Efforts to Prevent Yan's Activities</h3>
<p>▲ The Issue of Yan and Feng Going Abroad</p>
<p>▲ May Be Difficult to Achieve in the Short Term</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since Yan moved to Baifotang and instructed personnel at the Dingxiang train station to decline guests, the number of visitors has decreased, but he is still secretly active. Therefore, the Provincial Party Department is making vigorous efforts to urge Yan to leave Shanxi, and the atmosphere is extremely tense. In addition to sending a telegram to the central government through the National Government the day before yesterday, ordering the Shanxi Provincial Government and Shanxi generals to strictly arrest and bring him to justice to maintain law and order, they also telegraphed the Shanxi generals yesterday, saying, "Generals stationed in Shanxi, be aware that since the end of last year's war, the generals have re-aligned with the central government, and the country has regained peace, and the people have been able to rest for a while. Recently, Shi Yousan raised troops again and rebelled, rushing through Hebei. Fortunately, the armies swiftly suppressed and annihilated him in a few days, and the overall situation in North China was spared from destruction. Unexpectedly, at this time when the people's vitality has not yet recovered and Shi has just been eliminated, Yan Xishan, who was hiding in Dalian, suddenly returned on a Japanese plane, setting a bad international precedent, with a high suspicion of colluding with imperialism. Rumors arose for a time, and people were panicked, foreshadowing a major crisis in the future. Previously, this committee had offered loyal advice, saying that the generals are all pillars of the country, not henchmen of one person, and that the military supplies for more than ten years have come from the blood and sweat of the people, not from one person's private favor. We hope that the generals will leave the wrong path and embark on the right path. Since you have aligned with the central government, you have already embarked on the right path. The generals all understand the great righteousness, love the country, and love their hometowns, and have always been enthusiastic. You should uphold the initial intention of supporting unity and peace, and not be used by Yan again, and not go astray again. You will not only be able to preserve your personality, but also greatly benefit your hometown. In the past six months, Shanxi has suffered from natural disasters, financial disorder, coupled with heavy levies of grain and taxes, and the disturbance of red bandits and local bandits, resulting in widespread devastation and extreme suffering. The people all hope that the generals will be able to save them, and this committee has endless enthusiasm for the generals. This is to express our thoughts, and we hope you will consider them. Deleted and printed by the Shanxi Provincial Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party." Recently, due to Yan's return to Shanxi, the long-term residence of Feng in Shanxi has also attracted the attention of the general public. On the second or third day after Yan returned to his hometown, it was widely rumored here that Feng had indeed gone to meet Yan, but the Hebian side strongly denied it. Xu Yongchang has been receiving frequent telegrams from the central government, Vice Zhang, and Lu, Han, Yu, and Liu, requesting Xu to take responsibility and urge Yan and Feng to leave Shanxi as soon as possible to reassure people and quell rumors. He has been discussing with the Shanxi generals that Yan's return this time is due to his mother's illness, and he is not interfering in political affairs, so it may be possible to let him temporarily reside in his hometown under strict surveillance, to fulfill his filial duties. Therefore, it was decided to telegraph Chiang and Zhang for instructions, and at the same time, Xu would go to the plane to discuss, in order to obtain agreement. Beiping Correspondence: There has been a lot of talk about Yan and Feng going abroad, but in fact, it is still far from reality. Shang Zhen and Li Jingrong came to Ping this morning, and Pang Bingxun will also arrive tonight. According to them, there may still be changes within Shanxi. However, Bao Wenjie and Ge Jingen still telegraphed the campaign headquarters today, saying that Xu Yongchang stated that Yan would definitely go abroad, and would not interfere in foreign affairs before leaving the country, guaranteed by Xu's character. It is true that someone once made efforts to seek a pardon for Yan a few days ago, but that is already in the past. Although Song and Pang are in Ping, and Bao and Ge are in Shanxi, and are actively proceeding, the issue of Yan and Feng going abroad is still unknown. (17th)</p>
<h3>Overview of the Dangerous Situation of the Yellow River in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>▲ Important Dangerous Works Are Everywhere</p>
<p>▲ The Downstream Water Level Has Risen Another Foot</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The water level of the Yellow River this year is high, and in the 22 counties along the river, in the upper, middle, and lower reaches, extending no less than seven or eight hundred li, important dangerous works are everywhere, almost impossible to prevent and impossible to rescue. The source of the water is still strong. Yesterday, the 19th, the River Affairs Bureau specially reported all the dangerous works on the entire river to the Provincial Government. The original text is as follows: "To Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Jun: According to urgent telegrams from the second, third, fifth, sixth sections in the north and the second, third, and fourth sections in the south, the sudden change in the flow of the Wulongtan People's Embankment in the second section in the north, the collapse of the top of the second dam embankment, over ten zhang long; the seventh and eighth stone dykes in Qiaozhuang in the third section in the north collapsed by one or two zhang; the third stone dam in Wangzhuang, the second and twenty-sixth stone dams in Xijia Daokou, successively collapsed by one or two zhang; the lower corners of the fourth and fifth gray stone dikes in Tangjia and Changjia in the fifth section in the north collapsed; the eighth dam in Wangjiaji was submerged; the front of the fourth dam, the lower corner of the fifth dam, and the middle of the twelfth dam in Liujiakou all collapsed by more than one zhang; the entire dam of the third dam in Dacui collapsed; three dykes of the tenth dam in Mazhangjia were eroded by over six zhang; the dikes and dams in Gongjia, Sunjia, Damajia, Qijiazui, Wangzhuang, etc., in the sixth section in the north all rose in the water by one or two chi, and the erosion is constantly occurring; the lower corner of the twentieth stone retaining wall in Huojia Liu in the second section in the south collapsed; the upper and lower corners of the twenty-first dyke in Chenjiaquan were submerged; the seventh, ninth, and fourteenth stone dams in Luokou were all flooded; the upper corner of the fifth dam collapsed by two zhang; the base of the Da Daowang dyke dam collapsed by over one zhang; six sections of the Majia Ping Dyke Dyke, eight sections of Daoxu, thirteen sections of Fengjia, nineteen sections of Wang Wangzhuang, ten sections of Zhoujia Overwater Dyke Dyke, five sections of Xiaowangzhuang, and four sections of Fotousi have all been submerged. The situation of the work is dangerous and precarious. In addition to telegraphed orders to the section chiefs of the respective areas to lead their troops and civilians, regardless of wind, rain, day, or night, to spare no effort to rescue and protect them to ensure safety, I respectfully report. Director of the River Affairs Bureau Zhang Lianjia respectfully kowtows."</p>
<p>According to veterans of river affairs, the Yellow River in the upper reaches of this province is as wide as thirty li, while the lower reaches are as narrow as one li. The water that rose three chi and four cun in Shaanxi on the 17th had already been seen in the upper reaches on the morning of the 19th, so the water level rose again by one chi and two cun. When the water reaches the lower reaches, where the river is narrower, the water level will definitely increase. A telegram has already been received from the upper reaches, reporting an emergency, "To Jinan River Affairs Bureau and directors of all bureaus in the middle and lower reaches, Chief of Qing River Section Liang Junjian, from yesterday (18th) evening to this (19th) morning, the river water has risen by over one chi, totaling over eight chi with the previous rise. The dangerous works in Sunjia and Damajia are critical, and the flow is fierce. All the dykes and dams are completely submerged, with depths of two, three, or four chi. The flow on the dykes is eroding the base of the dams and splitting the top of the embankments, making them extremely dangerous. It is necessary to mobilize more civilians to strengthen the rescue efforts to ensure safety. A letter has been sent to the magistrate of Lijin County, ordering him to immediately dispatch 500 police and civilians to the embankment to assist, but fearing that the process will be slow and not timely, troops have been ordered to the embankment to urgently mobilize 200 civilians with gongs. The seat is requested to come to the works to instruct on the situation. Kowtows waiting for orders. Also, the works at Gongjiaba, Qijiazui, Wangzhuang, etc., are also critical at the same time. The county magistrate of Lijin has been instructed to dispatch civilians separately to assist in the rescue. Respectfully reported, Zheng Rong, Di Jibaoren kowtow." (20th)</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Flood Investigation Notes (Too Late)</h3>
<p>Between late summer and autumn, continuous rain for weeks has caused flooding in more than ten provinces of our country, with the Jiangbei region of Jiangsu Province suffering the most severe disaster. The unique reasons include its low-lying terrain, adjacent to Gaoyou, Shaobo, and Hongze Lakes, which have long been known as a land of marshes. In addition, the former course of the Yellow River upstream and the waters of the Huai and Yi Rivers overflow downwards, causing the Grand Canal to overflow. The vastness of Taihu Lake in Jiangnan and the increasing water level of the Yangtze River, block both upstream and downstream areas. The Gaobao area resembles a water tank, with its water level higher than the rivers and lakes. Only a long dike that has been neglected for many years is holding it back. Consequently, the earthen levees have been breached, and the land has been turned into a vast ocean, with the people scattered and displaced, and agricultural activities completely submerged. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in decades. The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association entrusted me to inspect the area for a week. I took a steamer and sailed against the waves, directly reaching Qingjiangpu.</p>
<p>Qinghuai is a place I have visited before, and I have many old friends there. This time, I came to survey the disaster, so I did not visit them. The Xiaoshui Gate and the North Gate were both blocked with earthen embankments. Suddenly, news came that the two sluice gates had collapsed, causing widespread panic. In reality, both gates had double-hole breaches (a culvert was in danger of collapsing). The Gaosheng Bridge was submerged, with a breach measuring twelve feet wide and ten feet deep, flooding into the Chaimihe River. Local people held emergency meetings one after another, requesting the Huaipi Engineering Office to open the Shuangjin gate panels. The Liang General Headquarters also sent a special task force to deal with the emergency. The water reached Xiaojie Street in the South Gate (according to reports, the water in the South Gate was partly caused by the pressure of Gaoyou and Hongze Lakes, and not entirely from the breach). I saw countless disaster victims repairing the old camps and levees as a temporary measure to escape the water. Outside the city, a vast expanse of water submerged crops, carried away livestock, and destroyed houses and graves. The exact number of deaths could not be determined. It is estimated that more than 20,000 to 30,000 households are currently homeless and awaiting death. At Hejiaxiang, south of the Grand Canal and outside the Dongwei Gate, the dike collapsed the day before yesterday. For a time, people supporting the old and carrying the young created a clamorous noise. Li Junwan, the head of Sanjiang Township, gathered the people by sounding a gong, and about 500 people joined the emergency repair effort. Fortunately, a major disaster was averted.</p>
<p>The next day, I rode a donkey to Huaicheng, about thirty li away. Along the riverbank, there were some newly repaired sections. West of Huai, from Gaoliangjian to the west dike of the Grand Canal, and from Yangjiamiao to the Taiping South Dike, there were dozens of li in each direction. The polder fields only yielded one autumn harvest. Due to the rising water of Hong Lake, it moved eastward with force, and the waters of Baima Lake and the Grand Canal were full and unable to discharge. The poor people had no seeds or seedlings, and most of them lived in nests in trees. The bodies of people and animals floated on the surface of the water in the newly constructed riverheads of Bafang. The heartbreaking scene is beyond description.</p>
<p>From Huaicheng to Baoying, passing through Erpu Pingqiao, about eighty li, I took a boat downstream. The water was high, and the boat sailed like an arrow. Looking west to the Great Lake, it was a boundless expanse of white. The earthen dike was almost level with the water, and the lake fields had become a marshland. Countless elderly and weak people drowned. Those who had not drowned but escaped were all living on the west bank of the river, dwelling in mat sheds, winding for dozens of li, serving as the only place of refuge for the disaster victims. Wives held their husbands, and children carried their mothers, appearing emaciated and eager for food. Looking east, the isolated city of Baoying was like sitting at the bottom of a pot, in imminent danger of falling. The Grand Canal dike was intermittent, with newly added earthen berms that were no more than three feet wide. The water was only a little more than a foot below the berms, vast and extremely dangerous. Fortunately, the southeast wind had been blowing for days, allowing for the construction to continue with stone transport, additional materials, and soil pressing, with round-the-clock defense. If a northwest wind were to suddenly blow, the lake water would rise steeply by three to five zhang, creating a tidal wave, white waves reaching the sky, like mountains moving and seas overturning. The sand and stones would be swept away for more than a hundred li, and the counties of Yan, Fu, Tai, and Dongxing would all become marshlands connected to the sea. If there were an unforeseen event, the world would change again. The river disaster is actually more severe than the Yangtze River disaster. Preventing the disaster is most dangerous in Gaobao. If the river dike collapses, the damage could extend for thousands of li. Historical records in the Gaobao County Chronicle confirm this, and it is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>From Baoying to Gaoyou, about one hundred and twenty li, the Grand Canal dike also has some newly repaired sections. The river water has already risen above the old dike, and the newly added loose soil and thin dike construction are also a cause for concern as they are eroded by the water.</p>
<p>That day, I stayed outside the county town at Yumatou. At midnight, the sound of gongs urging emergency repair and the wails of women and children were incessant. The farmers guarding the shore rose up to repair the breaches. Suddenly, the Wuliba was breached by the water. After the Sanba opened, the water level of the upper river was slightly lower than before, but the water level of the lower river suddenly rose by more than eight feet. The water broke through many embankments. The most tragic was Gaomiaowei, only a short distance from the dam, which bore the brunt of the disaster. The water reached the rooftops, drowning countless people and livestock. From the trees, one could still hear the cries of the living. The young and old, widows and orphans, either groaned by the roadside or wailed on both banks. The heartbreaking scene was unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>I took a mail boat south to Shaobo and disembarked. The dike had been newly repaired for about eight li. Because the water level had risen sharply before, a sub-dike had been added. Now that the water level continued to rise, the previous sub-dike had lost its ability to resist the water. As a result, three more feet were added to it in the following days (from the Nan Dawang Temple to the North Ban Factory). The water level at Sangu Shuizhi near Zhaoguan Dam rose to two zhang and two chi and five cun due to the increase in upstream flow. The water level was the highest on record. During this trip to various places, there was disaster victims everywhere, with tears in their eyes and choked voices.</p>
<p>Reaching Yangzhou, about forty li, the market near the customs house was flooded. The disaster was more severe in the Hongqiao area on the south side of the Yangtze River. San Gongwei, north of Guazhou Liuwei, collapsed the day before yesterday. The water was extremely strong, destroying more than 300 houses and submerging countless fields. The disaster victims scattered in all directions. The strong went to Jiangnan to find food, while the weak wandered in ditches and gullies. Their cries for help echoed back and forth in the waves and floods.</p>
<p>The disaster this year is widespread in size and scope. Even if the Sanba are opened together, it will not be easy to drain the water in a short time. If we consider the disaster situation in Jiangbei, Gaobao is the most severely affected. Because of its position on the shores of the lake, the fields and houses have been submerged, and people and animals have been displaced. If benevolent and kind people do not quickly rise up to rescue them, how will the tens of thousands of disaster-stricken people who have no clothes, no food, and no shelter survive?</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Second Provincial Congress Meeting Notes</h3>
<p>▲ Numerous Important Cases Resolved on the 21st</p>
<p>▲ Requesting the Central Government to Punish Mu Bin, Sun Hongzhe, and Others</p>
<p>▲ Emergency Motion to Request the Central Government to Remove Lin Biao from Office</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st) was the seventh day of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Congress of Provincial Representatives. At 9:00 AM, the sixth general meeting was held. 78 representatives were in attendance. The presidium nominated Zhang Renjie as chairman. After leading the ceremony, Xu Wenjun, a member of the proposal review committee, reported. Following this, the proposals were discussed: (1) Proposal to promote party affairs work in this province (proposed by the Provincial Party Consolidation Committee), divided into: 1. Determining the central work of party affairs in this province within one year: (A) Guiding all district branches in the province to hold meetings on time and concentrating all party member activities in the district branches; (B) Formulating measures to improve the educational level of party members in this province; (C) Concentrating the work of district party headquarters and district branches to handle rural public education and propaganda of party doctrines; (D) Stipulating the work that party headquarters in each county in this province should carry out for local autonomy and the rights and responsibilities borne by party members; (E) Stipulating the strategies for party headquarters at all levels to guide the work of local people's organizations. 2. Determining the treatment standards and inspection methods for party affairs workers in this province. 3. Stipulating that party members should be coordinated and supervised by the senior party headquarters in their locality when serving the community. 4. Determining the period, methods, and standards for recruiting probationary party members in this province. Resolution: Passed in principle, and the review opinions were submitted to the Congress Secretariat to organize the text. (2) The former Jiangsu Provincial Director of Civil Affairs, Mu Bin, violated the law, betrayed the party, harmed the country and the people, and his evil deeds are well-known. The Congress should resolve to request the Central Government to expel him from the party, strictly arrest him according to the law, and purify party discipline (proposed by Suining representatives, co-signed by 50 representatives from various counties in Zhenjiang). The reasons are fourfold: employing the poor and corrupt, openly engaging in bribery, excluding dissidents and harming comrades, and plundering the people's wealth. Resolution: Passed. Measures: 1. Request the Central Government to expel Mu Bin from the party, order his arrest and bring him to justice, and confiscate all his stolen goods and turn them over to the public. 2. In addition to receiving party discipline, Mu Bin should also be handed over to the court to be tried for the crime of slander. 3. Request the Central Government to thoroughly investigate the unscrupulous party members who colluded with Mu Bin to harm comrades in our party. (3) Sun Hongzhe, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, Mao Yisheng, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and Li Zhongqiang, Chief of the Gaobao Section, are ignorant of water conservancy and lack common sense of river engineering. They employed private individuals and neglected their duties, resulting in an unprecedented catastrophe, drowning countless people and animals, and turning houses into ruins, causing millions of people to starve to death. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. We earnestly request the Congress to impeach them to show a warning and to appease public anger (proposed by representatives from Yancheng and other counties). Resolution: The Congress will request the Central Government to forward to the National Government a request to promptly dismiss Sun Hongzhe, Director of the Department of Construction, and punish him. The Provincial Government should also be consulted to promptly dismiss Mao Yisheng, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and Li Zhongqiang, Chief of the Gaobao Section, and hand them over to the court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Emergency motion: Lin Biao, President of the High Court, should be given a serious warning for failing to attend the Congress to report on his work under the pretext of illness. Resolution: Submit to the Central Government a request to order the Ministry of Judicial Administration to remove Lin Biao from office.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>The abduction and enticement of a maid, requesting a thorough investigation. Hu Musheng, a farmer from Xiahengjing, Songjiang, has a daughter named A Hui. Since childhood, she was betrothed to Zhang Atong of Tinglin as his wife. However, due to their poor family circumstances, at the age of twelve, she was pawned by Tang Heshang Niangniang of Zhuangxing for twenty yuan to Zhuang Zhihe of Nanqiao to work as a maid. It was agreed on three sides that the redemption date would be fifteen years. Unexpectedly, after the girl grew up, Zhuang saw her beauty and seduced her into an affair. Later, she was not tolerated by the first wife and was privately sold as a concubine to Dai Lanshi, who opened a lace company in Xiaoyouli, Xujiahui, Shanghai. After Dai died, she remarried Song Yinghe, a patrolman in Yangshupu, last year. Now, the girl's father, Hu Musheng, believes that the pawn period has expired, so he prepared the redemption price last month. When he arrived in Nanqiao, Zhuang had already moved to Shanghai. So he asked people everywhere to inquire about the news and finally learned the truth. The Zhuang family saw that Hu could be bullied and refused to admit it. Therefore, Hu had no choice but to hire a lawyer yesterday together with Zhang Atong, the girl's husband, to file a lawsuit to investigate.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>The Provincial Order Prohibits Foreigners from Leasing Land. The Kunshan County Government previously received a letter from Pu Aide, the president of the Shanghai Yacht Club, requesting to permanently lease the riverside land along the Qingyang Port in this county to build a yachting venue for the club. Maps and previous contracts were attached. After receiving the letter, the county government believed that the matter was related to international territory and of great importance, so it reported the situation to the provincial government for instructions. Now, the provincial order states that Qingyang Port belongs to the interior and the request cannot be approved. After receiving the order, the county government has sent a reply to the club to inform them.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Inspector Yang cracks down on kidnappers. Kidnappings have occurred frequently in various townships of Fengjing. The Public Security Bureau strictly ordered Inspector Yang Shijie to arrest the perpetrators within a time limit. Today (the 21st), Inspector Yang cracked down on Zhang Yunting, the principal offender who kidnapped four members of Li Yuting's family in Fengjing for a ransom of 4,000 yuan, and two suspected accomplices, Xiang A'er, in a restaurant south of Changqiao in this city. They were sent to the Public Security Bureau for preliminary interrogation. According to Zhang Yunting, he had kidnapped two Tang family members in Qingpu territory in the 17th year [of the Republic], obtained funds for ransom, and so on. He was ordered to be detained pending verification.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Shen swears in. County Magistrate Shen Yong was transferred to Songjiang and has been here for a month. On the 21st, he held a supplementary swearing-in ceremony at the County Government's Haishitang. Yan Shenyu, the county magistrate of Shanghai, was appointed by the Provincial Office to supervise the oath.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Investigating the Situation of Grain Storage in Wuxian Charity Granaries. The Department of Civil Affairs sent Jiang Fuqin to Suzhou to investigate the Wuxian Charity Granaries and to investigate the flood situation at the same time. Regarding the flood problem, since the fields in the various townships are currently a vast ocean, there is no way to investigate. The investigation of the Charity Granaries has been completed. Yesterday (the 21st), it was reported to the Civil Affairs Office by the county government: (1) The current amount of securities and bills in the Charity Granaries is 20,742 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen, with 500 yuan in interest, 8,970 yuan, 6 jiao in the bank, and 1,814 yuan, 2 jiao in silver rice. (2) There are 6,514 dan and 20 jin of grain stored. (3) The grain is suspected to have come from donations from gentry and merchants in urban and rural areas. (4) Measures to establish rural and town granaries have been ordered by the county magistrate to be handled by the various district offices.</p>
<p>The Provincial Office Orders the Selection of an Abbot for the North Temple. The North Temple in Suzhou is one of the ancient temples in Suzhou. The current monks of the temple, Zhao San and his disciple Jiu Hua, are competing for the position of abbot, resulting in various disputes. The county government hired local people to organize a committee to reorganize the North Temple and carry out the reorganization. However, the two monks have entrusted various major patrons to find ways to help them, and the dispute has not yet been resolved. Yesterday (the 21st), the county government received an order from the Civil Affairs Office to select an abbot for the North Temple immediately to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Zhao Weixian is Arrested. Detailed account of the kidnapping of Wei Tingrong, the son-in-law of Zhu Bao San of Shanghai and a well-known figure in the French Concession. This newspaper previously reported on the incident of his escape. Wei has a brother-in-law, Zhao Weixian, who has repeatedly served in the military. Yesterday (the 21st), Zhao was suddenly arrested in Suzhou on suspicion of being involved in the case. The details are as follows: Four years ago, a Hunanese man named Zhao Weixian graduated from the École Libre des Sciences Politiques in France and then from the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr, the highest cavalry school in France. After returning to China, he served in the Ministry of the Army when Duan Qirui was in power and was sent to Japan to observe. After completing the task, he became the chief instructor of the volunteer regiment in the French Concession. Wei Tingrong was the commander of the regiment, and the two got along well. That year, Zhu Bao San's ninth daughter married Zhao. Not long after, the volunteer regiment was reorganized into a volunteer team. Zhao and Wei had disagreements, and Zhao left the team, taking his family to Hankou. Later, he was the deputy commander of the special task force of the Fourth Division, went to Jiangxi to suppress bandits, and recovered Yushan. Now, Zhao is the battalion commander of the Sixth Water Police Battalion of the Ministry of Finance, stationed in Bengbu. Recently, due to the floods in Hankou, he took leave to go to Hankou to pick up his family and brought them to Suzhou, living at his mother-in-law's house at No. 3 Fuxing Bridge inside Xumen. It has been several days. Yesterday (the 21st) at 11:00 AM, Zhao received a telegram from Bengbu urging him to return to the battalion. Therefore, he bid farewell to his mother and wife and took a chartered car directly to the train station. Unexpectedly, Wei Tingrong's son, Mao Sheng, reported to the detective team that Zhao was the principal offender in Wei's kidnapping two years ago. The team sent detectives Wu Rongshan and others to arrest Zhao and take him to the team headquarters for interrogation. At that time, Mao Sheng led the way with a pistol in his hand. Afterwards, according to Zhao's wife (Zhu Bao San's ninth daughter), there was another background to this matter. It was also heard that Zhao is the brother of Zhao Hanying, a female calligrapher and painter, 31 years old. Huang Jinrong, a consultant to the Shanghai French Concession Police, heard the news that night and ordered someone to take a letter to the Suzhou Public Security Bureau, the content of which roughly stated that the suspect was of great value for research, and asked that he be strictly detained and that detectives be sent from the French Concession Police to Suzhou this morning to take him away.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Ministry Orders Protection for Lixin Cloth. After the Wan case, when Lixin Textile Factory in Wuxi shipped its products to Shanghai, they were detained by the anti-Japanese association as Japanese goods. Although they were immediately returned after clarification, the time lost caused a lot of damage. Afterwards, the factory believed that at a time when domestic goods were being actively promoted, although the goods had trademarks and names for identification, they were afraid that there would be a recurrence of mis-deduction. Therefore, they specifically requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to protect them. The Ministry approved, "The presentation has been noted. We have informed the provincial governments to instruct their subordinates to facilitate the transportation and sales of domestic cloth in order to maintain it." At the same time, the provincial government ordered the counties to comply.</p>
<p>Anhui Rice Merchants Come to Wuxi to Buy Rice. Qian Zhongliang, the district chief of the First District, recently reported that rice merchants from Anhui Province have come to Wuxi to purchase large quantities of indica rice, as many as 200,000 shi, which will be shipped out soon. As a result, the price of rice has soared by more than three yuan, affecting the future of people's food supply. Yesterday, he specifically submitted a report to the county government requesting a strict ban on the export of rice and ordering the Rice and Bean Industry Association to lower the price of rice in order to maintain the people's livelihood and ensure social stability.</p>
<p>The Detective Team Arrests Thieves. The detective team of the County Public Security Bureau arrested two thieves, Zhu Guitian and Junru, on the road yesterday in connection with the robbery case at Bantang Temple. After being taken to the team, they were severely interrogated. According to their confession, they had previously shot and injured their accomplice, Qian Hai. This time, they had agreed with seven companions to go to Rongxiang in Kaiyuan Township to commit a robbery. The team obtained the confession and has prepared a document to send them to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>A Young Girl Dies After Falling From a Building. Xu Rongda, a resident of No. 2 Yingqiao Lane in the city of this county, is 27 years old and works as a silversmith in the Lao Renjin Jewelry Store in the North Gate. He has some savings and has not yet married. Last winter, he roamed around Zhou Shanbang and met a female worker from a silk factory named Miao Xiudi (also known as Miss Er), 19 years old, who lived in a nearby workshop. Unexpectedly, after a few dates, she became pregnant. However, the girl had already been betrothed to the son of the Liu family in Liutanqiao in this township. This spring, the matter was discovered by the Liu family, who forcibly took Xiudi home and forced her to marry. Xiudi was unwilling to live in the Liu family for a long time. Recently, she took advantage of an unguarded moment to sneak away and came to the city to discuss with Xu about divorcing her husband. Later, Xu persuaded someone to negotiate with Liu, and Liu agreed to receive 180 yuan as the cost of the wedding. At this point, Xiudi and Liu were divorced. Xu Rongda and Xiudi then started to live together. Who knew that her beauty would be short-lived and disaster would strike. Three days later, Xiudi suffered unbearable abdominal pain. She jumped from the building to escape, but her fetus was injured and could not be saved. She passed away at 10:00 PM that night.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Detectives Stationed in Shanghai are Sniped by Bandits. Ni Gusheng, the captain of the detective team of the Wuyi County Government, recently sent detectives to Shanghai to arrest the notorious bandit Qin Ermao, which was a great relief to the people. Qin's gang still has accomplices in Shanghai. Captain Ni continued to send detectives Zhao Xilin and others to Shanghai to arrest a bandit named Shen. At about 7:00 AM on the 20th, Zhao and others were in front of the Yangshupu Foreign Settlement Bureau, preparing to arrest the bandit Shen. Unexpectedly, the bandits struck first, and Zhao Xilin was shot three times. Detective Huanxi was shot once, and passersby were also killed and injured. Captain Ni Gusheng heard the news that day and took a night train to Shanghai to investigate.</p>
<p>Disaster Victims from Liyang Come to Changzhou. More than 80 refugees from Liyang County arrived at the train station outside Zhongshan Gate in Wuyi. They said that the county was hit by a major flood, and the beans and crops were all submerged. They had no choice but to go out to find food. The refugees stayed overnight at the station and then went to Shanghai to find hard labor.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Another Robbery and Assault Case Occurs in the Northern Countryside. Last night, many bandits armed with guns suddenly came to the home of Sun Daheng in Fengyi Township, Gaoqiao, in the northern countryside. They rushed in through the back door, grabbed Daheng, and demanded silver, but they did not succeed. He was burned by fire. The remaining bandits searched the house and fled with their loot.</p>
<p>A Wanted Criminal is Arrested in Shanghai. After the bandit disturbance in Wujiaqiao in the northern countryside in January of this year, the wanted criminal Zhu Jinhai fled far away and has not been arrested. Now, the criminal Zhu has opened a Zhongnan Bookstore in Shanghai under a pseudonym. Yang Qinggeng and others from the county detective team learned of this and reported it to the county government, who prepared a document and went to take Zhu back to Danyang. After Wang Cheng审 conducted an interrogation, the confession was cunning. He has now been detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Chengxi Automobile Has Already Been Test-Driven. The Chengxi Road was damaged by the flood. The Construction Bureau is rushing to repair it. The construction has now been completed. The entire road is scheduled to be opened to traffic on September 1. Today (the 21st), five small cars were first used to transport passengers from Xicheng. Each ticket cost one yuan. It took one hour and twenty minutes to travel from Cheng to Xicheng. However, at Tangtouqiao, because the bridge surface was being raised, it was necessary to change cars to Xicheng, delaying the trip by ten minutes. After the official opening of traffic on September 1 next month, each ticket will only cost eight jiao.</p>
<p>The Total Number of Flooded Fields in the County. This year's flood has caused disasters in all 14 districts of the county. The disaster situation has been reported to the county government by the district chiefs, and personnel have been sent to investigate separately. The investigation has now been completed, with a total of more than 290,000 mu of disaster-stricken fields. The average loss is about 70%.

<p>Prison Inmates Request General Amnesty. Inmates in prisons in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, and Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, initiated an telegram to the Central Government because the National Government's order for general amnesty this year only applied to political prisoners and not to ordinary civil and criminal offenders, requesting equal treatment and also granting amnesty. They also telegraphed to prisons in various counties to proceed together.

<p>The Repeated Rise in Rice Prices is Worrying. Since the opening of the Sanba in this county, nine-tenths of the fields in the four townships have been submerged. Therefore, although rice factories in this city have large quantities of rice in stock, they are regarded as scarce goods and arbitrarily raise prices. The general population is very alarmed. Most of the middle and lower classes have switched to eating flour. It is hoped that the local authorities in this county will quickly establish a food investigation committee, strictly prohibit the export of food, assess market prices, and not allow price increases in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>

<p>The transportation of water has somewhat stabilized. Distributing relief and recovering corpses in the Grand Canal. Due to prolonged clear weather, the water level is gradually receding. The local Red Swastika Society is raising funds to purchase dry rations. On the 19th, the society dispatched its relief team, exiting Xu Ning Gate and heading east to the breach outside Quekou Gate in the north. They counted approximately five to six hundred households of unemployed poor families and distributed aid to them accordingly. On the other hand, from Xu Ning Gate, they headed west to the area outside the Customs House to prepare for the distribution of relief goods. On the afternoon of the 20th, the society, due to insufficient funds for extensive relief efforts, held a special meeting to discuss solutions. They decided to seek assistance in the form of relief funds from the head office and various philanthropists. As for the handling of floating corpses found in the Grand Canal, local residents Ruan Lianzhong, Xu Tingsong, Yin Kejun, and others have gathered like-minded individuals to hire workers to recover and bury the corpses.</p>
<p>Telegrams regarding Ma Yuren's activities to plot rebellion were received by the Pacification Commissioner's Office. According to a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Liang Jian, "The magistrate of Funing County, Lu Jixi, has repeatedly reported that Ma Yuren is indeed planning to take advantage of the situation and has colluded with bandits Shi Bao, Tian San Da Wang (Third King Tian), Er Tu Huanzi (Second Earth Badger), and other gangs, gathering forces in the area of Shibadunzi (Eighteen Mounds) in Lianjing. It has also been discovered that a large group of pirates are gathering in Dalian, intending to land from the mouth of the Yellow River, hoping to launch a major offensive. Considering the need to prevent any possible problems, I have dispatched two battalions from the 96th Brigade, led by Regiment Commander Chen Maolin, to set off early in the morning for Funing to rigorously suppress them." Furthermore, according to a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Liang Jian, relaying a telegram from Brigade Commander Zheng Tingzhen, "The bandit leader Tu Han's troops, numbering approximately five hundred, with three to four hundred rifles, aboard dozens of small steamers and civilian boats, are entrenched in the area of Zhouji Tujiagou, and are heading towards the western part of the Huai River and West Lake, cutting off traffic to Huozheng. Today, I have dispatched Regiment Commander Cao Dianwen, leading two battalions of soldiers, two field guns, and two machine guns, to cooperate with the populace and Song Brigade, aboard two steamers, to conduct a joint land and water suppression."</p>

<p>Extortion Attempt Failed, God of Wealth Thrown into the Sea. Li Zunying of Baidu Village, Fenghua, was a relatively well-off man. In June of this year, he was kidnapped by bandits, who demanded a ransom of several thousand yuan. Li's family, finding it difficult to raise such a large sum of money at once, were trying to find ways to do so. Unexpectedly, the bandits, after waiting for two days without receiving any reply, threw Li Zunying into the sea, drowning him.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Opening of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway on Schedule. The Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, from Hangzhou to the Jiangsu border, has long been open to traffic. However, the Jiangsu section had not been completed, causing delays until now. Yesterday, reliable information was received that the Jiangsu Construction Department has officially scheduled the grand opening ceremony for the entire road to be held on September 1st. It is also reported that the road was opened to Yiyang yesterday (the 21st). It would have been possible to reach Yixing directly, but due to the floods that have not yet receded in that area, it has been temporarily postponed for a few days.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Decides to Dismiss Foreign Employees. The Zhejiang Construction Department reported that there is currently no need to retain foreign personnel for various tasks. It was decided that the contract of the bureau's Chief Engineer, Mr. Blancou, is about to expire, and a decision needs to be made as to whether or not to renew it. Also, a decision should be made regarding other Austrian personnel. After the Provincial Government discussed the matter, it was decided that the contract should not be renewed. Yesterday, the Construction Department was instructed to terminate the contract as soon as the expiration date arrives. Furthermore, the appointments of Mr. Beaumeier and Mr. Anaya, whose terms of office are tied to the Chief Engineer's term, should be terminated simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Proposal to Use Salt Tax Savings for Disaster Relief. Before the end of the Qing Dynasty, when constructing the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the provinces of Zhili, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui increased the salt tax to serve as railway stock. During the reign of Emperor Xuantong, this salt tax was loaned to foreigners, and the funds were later returned to the provinces. Anhui Province received over 80,000 taels of silver. This money eventually came into the hands of Fang Luzhong, the former vice-chairman of the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee, who deposited it. The principal and interest have now exceeded 300,000 yuan. Due to the severe flooding in Anhui Province, people from Anhui living in Tianjin have sent a joint letter proposing that these funds be used to provide disaster relief.</p>
<p>Request to Revise the Date of Confucius' Birthday. The magistrate of Quanjiao County submitted a request to the Civil Affairs Department, asking them to forward it to the Ministry of Interior, to revise the date of Confucius' birthday. He cited that the Guliang Commentary and the Records of the Grand Historian both state that Confucius was born in the tenth month, with the Zhou calendar beginning in the Zi month, which corresponds to August in the Xia calendar. The national calendar should still be based on October. If the dates are not revised, it would be tantamount to saying that Confucius was born in June of the Xia calendar. The Civil Affairs Department instructed him to provide detailed citations and resubmit the request for verification and forwarding.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Planning Post-Disaster Relief for the Flooding in Northern Anhui. The scale of the flooding in northern Anhui this time is unprecedented in the last hundred years. The disaster area covers eighteen counties, with millions of victims. Wails of sorrow are heard everywhere, and everyone is clamoring for food. The Anhui Office of the World Red Swastika Society has raised over 10,000 yuan in relief funds and has sent personnel to various counties to investigate and distribute aid. However, the autumn harvest is hopeless, and the days ahead are long. Therefore, gentry from Anhui's Linhuai, Suzhou, Bengbu, Fengyang, Huaiyuan, Shouxian, and other counties plan to work together and devise relief measures collectively. Recently, they discussed initiating the Anhui Northern Anhui Disaster Relief Association and will convene representatives from eighteen counties in northern Anhui to Bengbu to discuss organizational methods. The planned measures include: (1) providing work as a form of relief, (2) private fundraising to establish fair-price rice distribution, and (3) requesting the central government to allocate funds for joint relief efforts. These measures are currently being planned and implemented.</p>
<p>Rampant Banditry in Dingyuan. Dingyuan in northern Anhui has long been known as a bandit area. In the spring of this year, it was disturbed by the bandit gang of Jiang Guochang, known as "Three-Legged Jiang." Later, the troops of Ge Wucheng, the Third Brigade of the Second Cavalry Division, exerted efforts to suppress them, and the banditry was somewhat subdued. However, recently, with the rise of the green gauze tents (referring to the period when crops grow tall, providing cover for bandits), the bandits have become rampant again. The bandit stronghold is located in the fields southeast of the county seat. They go out to rob and kidnap people every day. A few days ago, bandits gathered several hundred people and suddenly surrounded the house of a wealthy man, Liu Changsong, in the southeast of Outang Town. Liu's security guards colluded with the bandits from within, opening the gates. The bandits rushed in, captured Liu, and forced him to hand over foreign banknotes. Liu firmly refused and was shot dead. His son was also kidnapped. The Liu family's security guards, totaling more than thirty people, had long been in contact with the bandits and left with them. According to estimates, the Liu family suffered losses of tens of thousands of yuan. The magistrate of Dingyuan County, due to the rampant banditry, has not dared to go to the area to investigate.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suixi Town and Over Two Hundred Villages Submerged. Suixi Town is located at the border of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui provinces. The people have long suffered from the scourge of war and bandits. Since the beginning of summer, there have been continuous rains for months. Furthermore, the dams of the Lieshan Coal Mine have blocked the flow of water, causing the north, central, and south branches of the rivers to overflow without drainage. Water has accumulated to a height of over three feet on the plains, destroying all the crops and turning homes into ruins. Fortunately, the residents of the town built defenses day and night, preventing the town from being completely submerged. However, over two hundred nearby villages have been swallowed by the raging waves. Among the affected villagers, aside from those who were rescued and escaped, approximately sixty people have been drowned, and the loss of property is estimated to be over eight million yuan. It has been reported that the area suffered from severe hailstorms this summer, resulting in a reduced harvest of winter wheat, causing widespread panic among the people. Now, they have suffered this great calamity. If the authorities do not provide proper post-disaster relief, the potential for future problems is very deep.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3>Letter from Xia Jinsheng of Fengxian</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>I read the article "Fengxian Adultery and Abduction Case Scheduled for Trial" in the local news section of your August 2nd edition. It stated that my wife suddenly appealed to the county government yesterday, admitting to having committed adultery with Secretary Zhou, and that Chen arranged the sale for a price, etc. Upon reading it, I found it to be slightly inconsistent with the facts. After my wife, Zhang, ran away on April 11th, Chen Shiqian, the owner of Chen Yuanxing Egg Shop on Nanqiao East Street, filed a lawsuit. As for the sale for a price, it has been explained as a misunderstanding by local officials, and a request has been filed with the county government to allow the withdrawal of the lawsuit. I am afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth, so I am writing to request your newspaper to correct the facts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Xia Jinsheng, August 19th.</p>

<h3>1930 National Education Expenditure Statistics</h3>
<p>▲106,495,690 Yuan</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st. The national education expenditure statistics for 1930 have been compiled. Higher education expenditure is 11,177,735 yuan (excluding administrative expenses for private schools).

<h3>Ministry of Education Clarifies Three Ambiguities in the Education Association Law</h3>
<p>▲Instructions to the Jiangsu Education Department</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a telegram from the Jiangsu Education Department, which stated: Previously, the Ministry of Education telegraphed that, in addition to the elected representatives of lower-level education associations, other members of the county/city education associations, and provincial education association supervisors and directors also have the right to be elected as officers. Currently, in the county education associations, where lower-level district education associations have been established, most only list the names of the representatives of the lower-level district associations when submitting the member rosters. If a non-representative is elected as an officer, and the name of this officer was not initially included in the member roster, should the name of this officer be added to the roster after being elected, or how should it be handled? Requesting instructions (1). Article 19 of the Education Association Law states that upper-level education associations have their direct lower-level education associations as members. Therefore, these members should belong to the lower-level education associations, not to the individual representatives of the lower-level associations. In the member roster, the member should be the name of the lower-level education association. Under each member name, list the names of the representatives. If the Education Ministry hasn't given clear instructions on this procedure, we do not want to presume the procedure. Requesting instructions (2). Furthermore, Articles 12 and 13 of the Education Association Law stipulate that the establishment of city, county, and provincial education associations requires the consent of more than half of the district/county education associations. However, after the organization is established, should the district/counties that did not agree be allowed to freely withdraw? Requesting instructions (3). The Ministry of Education clarified: (1) District education associations should prepare two copies of the member roster and submit them to the county education association for storage and verification. (2) Upper-level education associations should treat the lower-level education associations as members and the suggestion from the Jiangsu Education Department on listing the member association names is correct and approve to follow the procedure. (3) All district education associations within a county should be required to join the county education association. Those who do not agree should follow the majority and should not be allowed to freely withdraw. Please comply with these instructions accordingly.</p>
<h3>Principal Wang Diancun of Suzhou Middle School Resigns</h3>
<p>▲To become the Director of the Education Department at the Central Political School</p>
<p>It was recently rumored that Wang Diancun of Suzhou Middle School would be promoted to a Ministry Supervisor. It is now known that the Capital Central Political School is establishing an Education Department this year and, admiring Wang's profound knowledge, the Principal Jiang (Chairman Jiang) has hired him as the Director of the department and sent a letter urging him to go to Beijing immediately to plan everything. However, Wang has a well-established reputation, with outstanding achievements in managing Suzhou Middle School, and has made significant contributions to secondary education in Jiangsu. The Education Department relies heavily on him. His departure would have a significant impact. Director Chen of the Education Department sent personnel to Suzhou yesterday to persuade Principal Wang to withdraw his resignation. The faculty and staff of the school also believe that Wang's departure would have a significant impact on education in the Wu region and urgently telegraphed the Education Department, earnestly requesting his retention. The original telegrams are as follows: (1) Telegram (abridged): "Principal Wang's resignation has caused widespread consternation. Earnestly requesting his retention." (Omitted). (2) Express Mail (abridged): "Principal Wang has submitted his resignation. All colleagues are shocked and alarmed. We have already telegraphed Director Chen, earnestly requesting his retention. Principal Wang has a long-standing reputation for his scholarship and moral character. Colleagues in the education field admire him unanimously. He has been the principal for four years and has worked hard to make plans, with outstanding achievements and a remarkable reputation. Further progress in school affairs depends on his leadership and direction. We sincerely hope that Director Chen will consider the great importance of education in the Wu region and persuade him to stay. The school would be fortunate. We are sending another telegram, hoping for your consideration." (Omitted).</p>

<h3>Approval for the Establishment of the Dongya Sports Academy</h3>
<p>▲The first sports academy in the country to be formally established.</p>
<p>The Dongya Sports Academy on Luban Road, Lujiawan, Shanghai, has been developing rapidly and achieving outstanding results in recent years. The academy's affiliated high school sports teacher training program and the Boy Scout training program have already been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and the China Boy Scout Headquarters. The academy applied to the Ministry of Education for formal establishment of the specialty program last year. The Ministry sent personnel to investigate and found that the curriculum and structure were excellent, but the funding and equipment did not meet the legal standards and the application was not approved. After receiving the order, the academy actively prepared and applied to the Ministry of Education for formal establishment again this summer. The Ministry sent personnel to conduct another inspection and found the academy very satisfactory. It has now instructed the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to approve the establishment. It is reported that, apart from the sports departments attached to universities, there are currently no public sports academies in the country, and this is the first private sports academy to be approved.</p>
<h3>List of New Students for Jinan University Announced</h3>

<h3>Career Paths of Graduates from Wuben Girls' Middle School</h3>
<p>Since Wang Xiaoying became the principal of the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School two years ago, she has worked hard to improve all aspects of the school, including teaching, administration, and discipline. Last year, Cao Yihua took charge of teaching affairs and worked to improve the level of each subject. At the same time, the school also enforced strict examinations and encouraged students to pay more attention to extracurricular research and sports. This year, there were only seventeen graduates from the general studies program. One was hired as a staff member by a bank, and one was retained by the school as a teaching assistant. The remaining fifteen all passed the entrance examinations for prestigious national universities, including three who were admitted to the National Jiaotong University, one to the College of Science at the National Central University, three to Zhejiang University, five to Guanghua University, and five to Datong University. Most of those admitted were accepted into science and mathematics programs, indicating that, although the school is a girls' school, its achievements in science and mathematics are comparable to those of various universities. It is difficult to achieve this. It is reported that one of the graduates, Ms. Yang, was accepted into the science programs at Jiaotong University, Central University, and Zhejiang University. As for the 35 graduates of the normal school program, most have already been hired by education authorities in various counties. The Nanjing Orphans School has also sent a letter hiring three of them. Therefore, only nine remain to serve in the municipal schools and affiliated elementary schools. It is reported that over 1,300 applicants applied for the first and second rounds of admissions to the school, indicating the deep trust that the public has in the school.</p>

<p>▲The Process of Winning the Championship</p>
<p>Yu and Qian had each won twice, so they faced each other in the final match yesterday. Yu defeated Qian in straight sets to win the championship.</p>
<p>▲The Situation on the Court</p>
<p>Yu served first and won the first game with a clean sweep of four points. He then won two more games in a row, taking a commanding lead of 3-0. Qian, after suffering this setback, also won a game with a clean sweep of four points. The score then became 5-2. Yu Tianguang, unhurried, won the first set 6-3.</p>
<p>▲The Difficult to Resolve Match</p>
<p>Qian improved his serving and won a game, seeming to regain momentum, leading 3-1. Unfortunately, he then lost three games in a row. Fortunately, he won two more games, still leading 5-4. At this crucial moment, he could not win again, allowing Yu to make it 5-5 and then 6-5. Yu then suddenly won three games in a row to win the second set 8-6.</p>
<p>▲The Situation is No Longer Favorable</p>
<p>Qian had already lost two sets, and the situation was no longer in his favor. Yu Tianguang took an early lead of 4-2. Although he then advanced one game to make it 4-3, he ultimately could not maintain it and lost again 6-3. Yu won with a total score of 3-0.</p>
<p>▲Comparison of Performances</p>
<p>In terms of stability, Yu was much better than Qian. Qian was less fiery yesterday, but because he was too cautious, his performance was actually worse. His double faults on serves often led to the loss of games that he had been winning, which was a great pity. The second set was very good. He often won against Yu with balls that were close or far away. Although he often wanted to block at the net, there were many times when there was an opportunity, but ultimately the lack of power led to ineffectiveness. Yu Tianguang's long shots were very commendable and strategic. In the third game of the third set, he used a very accurate diagonal shot to make Qian run around, exhausting him and eliciting applause. Yu also had fewer net touches than Qian, and it was not easy for him to turn a dangerous situation into a victory. His victory over Qian yesterday was still more than adequate.</p>
<p>▲Prizes for the Top Three</p>
<p>▲Champion: A Spoulding tennis racket with Spoulding's best quality string from Spoulding, worth 80 yuan, won by Yu Tianguang.</p>
<p>▲Runner-up: A Spoulding tennis racket with Spoulding's good quality string from Spoulding, worth 60 yuan, won by Qian Yaobin.</p>
<p>▲Third Place: A Spoulding tennis racket with Spoulding's Singapore string from the East China Company, worth 40 yuan, won by Ma Anquan.</p>

<h3>Various Sectors Organize to Rescue Flood Victims</h3>
<p>▲Propaganda... Fundraising... Relief Distribution... Epidemic Prevention</p>
<p>This year, floods have caused disasters in various locations, affecting as many as sixteen or seventeen provinces, with the number of victims reaching fifty to sixty million. This is truly unprecedented in over a hundred years. Relief organizations of officials and civilians in this city have been established one after another. The various news received yesterday was complex and varied, but can be summarized as propaganda, fundraising, relief distribution, and epidemic prevention. These are compiled and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Officials and Civilians Rise Up to Cooperatively Provide Disaster Relief</p>
<p>▲Relief Committee Dispatches Personnel to Provide Urgent Relief</p>
<p>The Relief Affairs Committee is making every effort to provide relief for the floods in various provinces. Previously, Chairman Xu Shiying obtained two million yuan in salt tax treasury bonds from the central government, and has already borrowed one million yuan in cash by mortgaging them to Shanghai banking circles for urgent relief use. Personnel for relief distribution have been assigned separately, and relief fund allocation will be handled in accordance with the meeting's resolutions. All matters regarding relief distribution telegrams and relief distribution items have been submitted to the Ministry of Transportation to instruct the provinces to take note. It is reported that the dispatched committee members, Wang Zhen for Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and Xie Zhuang for Anhui and Jiangxi, according to a telegram from Nanjing, have already departed from Beijing. Li Huanying for Hunan and Wang Shouzhen for Henan will depart from Beijing by train tonight. Li Jin and Guan Huai, concerned about the severity of the disaster in Hankou, departed from Shanghai by plane this morning to provide emergency relief in Hankou. All relief distribution personnel have uniformly shipped relief supplies and relief tickets, medicines, etc., in advance, and have set off separately. Furthermore, the committee received a telegram yesterday from the Henan Relief Affairs Committee, addressed to Mr. Wang Yilao of the Relief Committee's Shanghai Office, and forwarded to Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Wu Zhihao, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing: "The people of Henan, surviving soldiers and bandits, have once again fallen into a great calamity. Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been too much rainfall, and dozens of rivers, including the Huai, Sha, and Luo, have successively overflowed. Currently, it has been found that there are already fifty-four affected counties, including Xin, Yan, Luo, and Shang. The losses of the people are immeasurable, truly a unique disaster in history. This committee is responsible for providing relief and cannot sleep soundly. However, the disaster area is too large, and funds are unavailable. The central government has promised to allocate relief funds, but repeated telegrams have been sent requesting them, and they have not yet been issued. Twenty million disaster victims are daily in deep water, crying out for food. We dare not evade blame for the criticisms from all sides. In addition to dispatching personnel to various counties that have not been affected by the floods to raise funds, we are also recommending Chairman Zhang Boying of this committee to personally go to Beijing and Shanghai to plead with the government and various charitable organizations of the Relief Committee on behalf of the dying famine victims. We urge our fellow countrymen to provide strong assistance and facilitate their progress. We hope for your benevolence and will offer endless prayers. This special telegram is sent to you, hoping for your clear understanding. The Henan Relief Affairs Committee bows in respect."</p>
<p>▲Establishment of the Liaison Group of the Flood Relief Committee</p>
<p>In view of the floods in various provinces and the urgent need for relief, the National Government has specially established a Flood Relief Committee, appointing Song Ziwen, Xu Shiying, Liu Shangqing, Kong Xiangxi, and Zhu Qinglan as government committee members. Seven groups have been established, namely Investigation, Finance, Accounting, Audit, Hygiene, Epidemic Prevention, Transportation, Liaison, and Disaster Area Work. Each group has a director, appointed by the committee members. Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi serves as the director of the Liaison Group. Regulations have been drafted, dividing the work into five sections. Xu Jianping has been appointed as the director of the General Affairs Section, Liu Kuidu as the director of the Documentation Section, Guo Bingwen as the director of the Coordination Section, Mu Xiangyue as the director of the Investigation Section, and Zou Bingwen as the director of the Propaganda Section. Furthermore, more than sixty people, including Lu Peizhang, Huang Tao, Zhao Shutong, Zhu Yinong, Huang Dingxun, Chen Jingsheng, Han Yougang, Ge Tianhao, Qin Bangzhen, and Xu Shanxiang, have been hired as staff members. The Liaison Group's office is located in the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau, and it has been actively operating since yesterday.</p>
<p>▲The Municipal Government Decides on Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, in view of the current severe disaster situation in various places and the plight of the people, and with the establishment of the Central Disaster Relief Committee and the Shanghai Fundraising for Provincial Flood Relief Emergency Association in this city, but fearing that fundraising alone may not be sufficient given the vastness of the disaster area and the large number of victims, Mayor Zhang proposed five measures for flood relief at yesterday's municipal government meeting, which were discussed in detail and resolved as follows: (1) To provide as much guidance and assistance as possible to the provincial flood relief emergency associations organized in this city, in order to achieve the goal of raising as much funds as possible for adequate relief. (2) The Social Affairs, Public Safety, and Health Bureaus shall properly plan for the accommodation of refugees. (3) The Finance Bureau shall allocate 100,000 yuan to be used as disaster relief funds, with the usage to be determined on a case-by-case basis. (4) In addition to donating part of their salaries to aid relief, the staff of the Municipal Government's various offices and affiliated institutions shall also be responsible for finding ways to solicit donations. The donation of part of their salaries shall be in accordance with the following standards: (1) Those with monthly salaries below 50 yuan may donate as they wish. (2) Those with salaries between 51 and 100 yuan shall donate at least 5%. (3) Those with salaries between 101 and 200 yuan shall donate at least 10%. (4) Those with salaries between 201 and 300 yuan shall donate at least 20%. (5) Those with salaries between 301 and 400 yuan shall donate at least 30%. (6) Those with salaries between 401 and 500 yuan shall donate at least 40%. (7) Those with salaries above 501 yuan shall donate at least 50%. In addition to donating funds to aid relief in accordance with the above standards, all staff members may also donate clothing and other items and organize disaster relief campaigns to promote publicity and facilitate relief efforts. It is reported that the above measures have been communicated by Mayor Zhang to the Secretariat and various bureaus for prompt implementation. It is also reported that in addition to initially donating one month's salary to aid relief, Mayor Zhang has scheduled to present several measures to the standing committee members, finance committee members, design committee members, and the chief secretary of the city's Fundraising for Provincial Flood Relief Emergency Association on Tuesday, the 25th of this month, to jointly discuss implementation.</p>
<p>▲Social Affairs Bureau Prepares for Accommodation</p>
<p>The Municipal Government, in view of the wide scope and severity of the floods in various provinces and the displacement of the people, and also recognizing the increasing number of disaster victims coming to Shanghai, urgently needs to find ways to accommodate them to prevent homelessness. It is currently planning to allocate a large sum of money and has tasked the Social Affairs, Public Safety, and Health Bureaus with responsible management. On the Social Affairs Bureau's side, it is reported that a temporary relief section has already been established yesterday to facilitate communication and preliminary planning for accommodation matters. It has been scheduled to convene a meeting at the bureau at 10:00 AM on the 24th of this month, inviting representatives from the Public Safety and Health Bureaus, the Shanghai Fundraising for Provincial Flood Relief Emergency Association, the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association, the Guilds Joint Association, the Shanghai Buddhist Association, the Hu Nan Charity Association, the Shanghai Charity Group, the Pu Shan Villa, the Lianyi Charity Association, the Chinese Jishēng Society, the Zhabei Charity Group, the Moral Society, the Shengde Charity Society, the Renji Charity Hall, the Ciyou Xiejihui, the National Medicine Association, the Shanghai Hospital, the Guangyi Chinese Medicine Hospital, the Shenzhou Hospital, the Bean and Rice Industry Guild, the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Guild, the Flour Mill Industry Guild, and the Confectionery and Biscuit Factory Industry Guild to jointly discuss specific measures.</p>
<p>▲Women's Circles Organize Women's Disaster Relief Committee</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, the government has specially appointed five people, including Song Ziwen, as committee members, and has also hired dozens of other committee members to expand fundraising. Mrs. Kong Song Ailing, Mrs. Zhang Yu Fengzhi, and others from the women's circles have also been hired as committee members. Mrs. Kong, witnessing the vast disaster area and the urgent need for relief, took advantage of Mrs. Zhang's presence before her return north to convene a meeting yesterday at her residence on Avenue Haig to plan for the implementation of women's disaster relief work. Mrs. Sun Song Qingling, Mrs. Jiang Song Meiling, Mrs. Wang Chonghui, Mrs. Yang Zhaoyun, Mrs. Zhang, the mayor's wife, and Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, among others, attended. As a result of the discussion, a Women's Disaster Relief Committee was organized, and the National Goods Bank was designated as the association's headquarters. However, Mrs. Kong is currently in poor health due to excessive grief over the passing of her mother, and doctors have advised her to avoid strenuous activities. However, Mrs. Kong, recognizing the severity of the disaster, is determined to serve the public despite her illness. Mrs. Zhang, after returning north, will immediately organize the North China Women's Disaster Relief Association and transport grain from Shandong Province to the disaster area for relief distribution.</p>
<p>▲Jointly Discussing Health Measures for Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the Seaport Quarantine Station, Hu Hongji, Director of the Health Bureau, and personnel from the Public Concession and French Concession's Public Works Departments, in view of the vast floods in Hankou and the daily arrival of disaster victims in Shanghai in large numbers, which would be difficult to manage properly, and considering that this not only relates to local security but is also particularly important in terms of hygiene, decided to hold a meeting every Friday to jointly plan for prevention and relief measures. At yesterday's first meeting, it was resolved that (1) personnel should be dispatched to Nanjing in advance to establish the first line of epidemic prevention, and that in addition to administering vaccinations when ships pass Xiaguan, the Nanjing municipal authorities should be requested to designate open space for the accommodation of refugees; (2) strict quarantine procedures should be implemented when ships arrive at the Shanghai docks; (3) Mayor Zhang should be requested to designate a place to accommodate disaster victims. The points to be noted for disaster victims are dysentery, cholera, and typhoid fever, the three types of infectious diseases that are unavoidable in flood-affected areas. Therefore, in addition to raising funds for disaster victims, it is urgent to prevent the entry of infectious diseases, which is a crucial task.</p>
<p>▲National Medicine Association Encourages Urgent Relief</p>
<p>The National Medicine Association held a temporary executive and supervisory committee meeting and a joint meeting of the board of directors of the association's affiliated Chinese Medical College at 8:00 PM the night before last. Ding Zhongying, Jiang Wenfang, Xue Wenyuan, Guo Boliang, Huang Baozhong, Fu Yongyan, Qin Bowei, Xie Liheng, Bao Shisheng, Tang Liangchen, Shen Xinjiu, Shen Jianhou, Zhang Zanchen, and two or thirty other people attended. Xie Liheng and Bao Shisheng were publicly elected as chairmen, and Jiang Wenfang reported and recorded the proceedings. (A) Reports: (1) A letter from the Hankou Municipal National Medicine Branch; (2) A letter from the Pudong Branch Office of this association; (3) A letter from Bao Shisheng, President of the Chinese Medical College. (B) Proposals: (1) Ding Zhongying and Guo Boliang proposed that in view of the severe floods in various provinces and the urgent need for relief, should this association do its best to assist? It was resolved that (1) a notice should be published in the newspaper to inform the national medicine community to donate as much as possible, and relief funds should be sent directly to the collection point of the city's Fundraising for Provincial Flood Relief Emergency Association, such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, the China Fú Bank, and the Jin City Bank; (2) when flood relief bonds are issued, this association will do its best to encourage subscriptions; (3) this association will print 500,000 copies of a text encouraging donations for flood relief and distribute them to members to pass on to patients to donate as much as possible; (4) we earnestly request that the national medical and pharmaceutical communities, based on the principle of disaster relief and compassion, jointly take responsibility and proceed in a unified manner. (2) President Bao of the Chinese Medical College proposed to hire Mr. Qin Bowei as the director of education of the college. It was resolved that the proposal was passed. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲Relief Committee Issues a Summary of Governance Regarding the Huai River</p>
<p>The National Government's Flood Relief Committee issued the following summary regarding relief for the floods in the Huai River basin: (1) Affected Areas: The disaster area in the Huai River basin can be divided into two major parts: (A) The upper reaches are west of Yanggānhé and Sānhéjiān, extending upstream to the Pinghan Railway line and the tributaries of the Huai River in northern Anhui, such as the areas along the Sha, Ying, Ru, and Hong Rivers. The floods were caused by mountain torrents, and more than twenty counties were affected. Although the water level has gradually receded, the areas where fields and cities were flooded during the peak of the floods were severely affected. (B) The middle and lower reaches are east of Zhengyangguan on the main stream of the Huai River, passing through Hongze Lake and reaching the downstream river area. The terrain is low-lying, and the current floodwater is submerged to a depth of more than ten feet, and even the shallow areas are two or three feet deep. The area covers approximately 80,000 square miles. In addition to the fields and cities being submerged, there is no hope for the autumn harvest. Therefore, the disaster is more severe than in the upper reaches. Other rivers, such as the Yi and Shu Rivers in Shandong, are also tributaries of the lower reaches of the Huai River, and more than ten counties have also reported floods. Therefore, within the Huai River basin, the disaster area spans the four provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong, affecting more than eighty counties and approximately ten million disaster victims. (2) Causes of the Disaster: The amount of rainfall in the Huai River basin this year is unprecedented. From late June to early July, there was continuous rain day and night in various places, especially in the high areas of the northwest of the Huai River basin and the tributaries. As a result, mountain torrents erupted and rivers overflowed, and the counties in the Huai River basin in Henan and Anhui and their tributaries were the first to suffer. Subsequently, the floodwater from the upper reaches flowed into the main river, overflowing the banks. From July 11th to 15th, the dikes below Zhengyangguan to Wuhe were first overflowing and then breached, and the dikes along four to five hundred miles were almost completely destroyed. As a result, the main and tributary rivers were connected, and land and water were connected, turning flatlands into lakes. The counties along the Huai River in Anhui suffered the pain of submersion, with no one spared. The Huai River in Henan and Anhui flows to Hongze Lake, which is located at the border of Jiangsu and Anhui, as a temporary destination, and then exits through Gaoyou and Shaobo Lakes to the Yangtze River. The current discharge of large amounts of floodwater at the Yangtze River outlet is insufficient. However, since the water flow from the upper reaches has overflowed the flatlands, the downstream flow is slower. When the disasters in Henan and Anhui were evident, Jiangsu Province, except for the areas along the lake, had not yet suffered a major disaster. By late July, due to the difference between the amount of inflow and outflow each day, the amount of water stored in the lakes increased, and the water level of the lakes continued to rise. The downstream canal is connected to Gaobao Lakes, and the water level of the canal also increased in the same way. Soon, from Huaiyin to Shaobo for three hundred miles, the eastern dike of the canal was in danger of overflowing. Although the Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and the troops stationed along the Huai River continuously reinforced and raised the dikes, the water level continued to rise, and the danger of the canal dike was indescribable. In early August, three dams of the returning sea dam were opened as a last resort. Since there were no large channels to accommodate the discharge below the dam, and the Fan Gong dike was blocking the way, the water flowing eastward flooded the plains, and the counties in the downstream river area of Jiangsu Province became a swamp. This is a summary of the causes of the disaster in the Huai River basin this year. (3) Work Relief and Disaster Relief: The fundamental plan for treating the flood disaster in the Huai River is: (A) Downstream Tail Water Engineering: The waterway entering the Yangtze River should be reorganized, and a waterway entering the sea should be opened to increase the amount of water discharged into the Yangtze River and the sea. (B) Midstream Flood Control Engineering: Dikes should be built and river channels should be dredged to accommodate flood flows. (C) Upstream Water Storage Engineering: Reservoirs should be built and ditches should be widely opened to store flood flows. The Huai River Guidance Committee has either completed the design of these projects or is actively planning them and will implement them in sequence. Now that a major disaster is at hand, it is imperative to provide disaster relief to the refugees. Work relief is a way to kill two birds with one stone. The principles of work relief must be that the work is something that everyone can do, something that can be done nearby, and something that provides permanent benefits. Therefore, in terms of the Huai River guidance project, the most appropriate projects are the opening of the waterway entering the sea and the construction of dikes on the Huai River in Anhui. All plans have been prepared and can be started in sequence, and the disaster victims in the Huai River basin can be fully utilized.</p>
<p>▲Salt Reclamation Companies Request Dispatch of Personnel to Inspect</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Salt Reclamation Companies in southern Huai River sent a telegram to the Construction Department of the Provincial Government: "To Provincial Government Chairman Ye and Construction Department Director Sun: The heavens have sent a flood disaster, and the people's livelihood is miserable. Who with blood and qi would not be heartbroken? This is the day when the government and the people are jointly planning to provide relief and seek fundamental solutions. If, because of the height of the terrain, we hate each other, trying to save ourselves by cutting off the lives of others, it does not seem to be in accordance with humanity. The salt reclamation companies of the association are located at the edge of the sea tide and usually serve as an outer defense for the upper section of the land, preventing the qi from approaching the people's fields and eliminating the need for tidal defenses. This is also due to the terrain. The companies dare not take credit from the inland. Now, due to the heavy rains in the west and the flooding of the canal, we are in danger. We have already opened the dam for emergency relief to alleviate the disaster in the downstream river area. However, we cannot ignore the lives of the people west of the canal. The dams that can be opened have already been opened. Now, those who hold the position in the downstream river area, because they cannot prevent the canal from opening the dam, are taking their anger out on the salt reclamation companies, saying that we are blocking the flow of water to the sea. If we are removed, they will be happy. How can they know that after the canal dam is opened, the water in the downstream river area is still lower than the eastern salt reclamation area? Since ancient times, the lower river area has been shaped like the bottom of a pot, with the canal high to the west and the peak high to the east. This was not caused by the salt reclamation companies building dams. If we advocate opening more rivers into the sea within the salt reclamation area to facilitate drainage, this is what the companies are seeking, and we have no reason to refuse. If we must remove the embankments and dams, allowing the water to flow on the ground and restoring the ancient wilderness, and then say that it does not obstruct the interior, then may we ask if it is the responsibility of the country to promote prosperity and eliminate harm, so that high and low areas can have harvests? If the higher land is harmed by water later, should we remove it to vent our anger? Then the canal carries water and flows at a high place, and there is always the danger of flooding downstream. How should the hatred be? Can we remove everything west of the canal? Now, those who accuse the salt reclamation companies are speaking recklessly and inciting each other, and we are deeply afraid of causing riots and endless disasters. We respectfully request that you quickly send specialized water conservancy personnel to investigate the truth, announce the correct theory, stop the chaos, and save the imminent disaster. We await your orders with great urgency."</p>
<p>▲Di Chuqing Requests Opening of the Sanmao You River</p>
<p>Di Chuqing sent a telegram to the Provincial Government requesting the opening of the Sanmao You River to discharge water and alleviate the disaster: "To Provincial Government Chairman Ye: With the opening of the sea dam in Jiangbei, several counties in the downstream river area have become swamps. The Dafeng Yuhua Dike is blocking the flow. We earnestly request you to quickly open the Sanmao You River to discharge water and save millions of lives. Di Chuqing bows in respect."</p>

(6) Investigation forms were formulated and distributed to various disaster-affected areas to be filled out for statistical purposes. (7) It was stipulated that standing committee meetings would be held every Wednesday and Saturday at 4:00 PM, with emergency meetings convened on a temporary basis. (8) The Anhui Provincial Government replied in a telegram that there was no execution of disaster victims in Tongling and Nanling counties, and the provincial government had never approved any county to post announcements. The counties had not yet made such a request. The representatives were asked to report on what basis, and the two counties were ordered to verify and refute. Please take note.</p>

<p>▲Donations Received by the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, The Sino-Foreign Relief Association has recently received remittances from overseas Chinese, specifically for the relief of disaster victims in Hankou, which has aroused the excitement of people in the country. The following two letters are recorded: (1) Yiji Letter: The Sino-Foreign Relief Association, Greetings. This major flood has not been seen since the 29th year of Daoguang. We are all compatriots, and no one can hear of it without feeling pain and sorrow. Your association's advertisement appeals for 50 million disaster victims, demonstrating your great ambition and admiration. What is even more inspiring is that Mr. Hu Wenhu, an overseas Chinese businessman, is far away but deeply concerned about his disaster-stricken compatriots. He has not only repeatedly provided huge sums to help the poor and eliminate disasters, but also donated self-made Wan Jin Oil, Headache Powder, Qing Kuai Shui, and Bagua Dan, etc., in sufficient quantities to distribute to the disaster areas. These relief items are even more effective than money. Looking at past major disasters, epidemics are rampant. Now, with these good medicines, countless people can be saved from groaning and dying. It is not only a matter of benefiting tens of thousands of people for generations to come, but also a source of inspiration. I deeply sympathize with this righteous act, but I regret that my meager strength is limited and I cannot contribute all my wealth. I have managed to collect 5,000 yuan and specially offer it. Please check and quickly distribute it to the disaster area in Hankou. I know that a cup of water cannot extinguish a burning cart of firewood, but Mount Tai and the sea may not be without a trickle of soil and streams. (2) Zhongshutang Aid Fund Letter: I have repeatedly read newspapers, and most of them report on the water disaster, which is heartbreaking. Your association is doing its best, and all overseas Chinese admire you. Today, I read that Mr. Hu Wenhu is donating both funds and medicine, which shows that he is not shirking his responsibility and is enough to arouse the enthusiasm of people in the country for relief. I feel that the people of Hankou are standing in the water, and their cries for help are especially urgent. I cannot sit idly by and have specially donated 3,000 yuan. Please quickly distribute it to the area for urgent relief, hoping to help them reach the other shore.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Announces Raw Material Passage Measures</h3>
<p>▲Industrial and Commercial Circles Express Cooperation and Mutual Progress</p>
<p>▲Five-Year Plan First Determines Drafting Steps</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Committee has been working on the resistance-to-goods movement for days and is still in progress. After the various labor unions resolved to express their dissent regarding merchants conducting self-inspection, the leaders of the industrial and commercial circles explained in detail, and after the opinions were communicated, it was realized that the methods of both parties were originally different. They still expressed the spirit of cooperation and mutual progress. All misunderstandings have been completely eliminated. The passage measures for essential industrial raw materials have also been publicly announced yesterday. The five-year industrial plan first determines the drafting steps. The various news reports are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲Raw Material Essential Goods Passage Measures The Anti-Japanese Association issued a public announcement yesterday, stating: "After investigation, the passage measures for essential industrial raw materials have been resolved at the 11th Standing Committee meeting of this association and will be implemented from the 20th of this month. The measures are hereby publicly announced for your information." The attached measures are as follows: (1) Those who purchase Japanese industrial raw materials and essential goods must first apply for registration with the registration section of this association. (2) After registration, if this association verifies that there are no goods from other countries that can be substituted, permission will be granted to draw a fund to establish a factory. (3) After approval to establish a factory, a fund should be deposited at the bank designated by this association. (4) This association will issue a passage permit based on the bank's deposit receipt, allowing passage. (5) The articles of association, general rules, triplicate deposit slip, and passage permit forms for establishing a factory will be determined separately.</p>
<p>▲Five-Year Plan Determines Drafting Steps, The five-year industrial plan, since the Design Committee of the association resolved to appoint economic experts Li Quanshi, Xu Yongzuo, and Gui Yanfang to draft it, after two meetings of the association, has been slightly discussed, but no concrete measures have been seen to be expressed to the outside world. According to Mr. Yan Guangqian, private secretary of the Design Committee, speaking to the New Voice News reporter, the five-year industrial plan takes the overall development of China as a premise and is greatly related to the future. Observing the Soviet Union's five-year plan has had a profound impact on the international community. However, the Soviet Union's plan, with the power of the government, gathered talents from all over the country and devoted themselves to planning, so that this effect was achieved. Now, our country intends to proudly draft a five-year industrial plan, and it will not be successful unless experts are gathered together for joint research. The drafters also think the same way. Therefore, they only intend to stipulate the steps on how to draft it and submit written opinions for joint discussion at the Design Committee meeting next Monday to proceed with the process.</p>
<p>▲Expressions from Jiangyin and Wuxian Telegrams (1) Jiangyin Telegram: Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Committee, Greetings. Our association was established at the Qi Day (8th) meeting and has been telegraphed on record. After investigation, the first committee meeting was of the unanimous opinion that Shanghai is the throat for the import of foreign goods, and Japanese goods in the interior are all imported from Shanghai. If Shanghai can thoroughly inspect and eliminate them, then there will be no problem in the interior. We should telegraph your association to urge strict inspection to eliminate the source and prevent Japanese goods from flowing into the interior, etc. The minutes of the resolution are on file. A corresponding record telegram is hereby sent, hoping you will investigate and implement it vigorously. Deeply grateful. Jiangyin Economic Severance Committee for Japan, Knocking, Seal. (2) Wuxian Telegram: Shanghai Municipal Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Committee, Greetings. I have recently read in the newspapers that your association has seized Japanese goods, and Japanese soldiers have forcibly seized goods, arrested staff, and committed illegal acts of insults, which are outrageous. We have already telegraphed the National Government to order the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct serious negotiations with Japan. We also send a special telegram of condolences, hoping that you will continue to fight. Our association vows to be your backing. The telegram is urgent and pressing, and we are extremely grateful. Wuxian Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Committee Chairman Zhang Wentang, Fan Junbo, Lu Baoyu, Knocking.</p>

<h3>Female Student Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>▲Sacrificing Her Life for Patriotism</p>
<p>▲Hoping Six Items Will Awaken the Chinese People</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, on the Pu shore in front of the Naval Hospital on Zhang Xuehua Beach in Wusong, a person dressed in a white silk cheongsam, resembling a female student, suddenly committed suicide by drowning. Before entering the water, she discarded several books she was holding on the beach. Then, she calmly walked towards the Huangpu River and jumped in. At that time, the Junpu Bureau's Li Hua small steamer was towing a barge and several mechanics were going to the old Hailong dredging machine ship for repairs. Passing by the area, they caught sight of a woman drowning. The helmsman, Lu Hongsheng, immediately steered the rudder to rescue her. However, the distance was too far, and towing a large barge slowed down the small steamer, so it was too late to catch up, and the female student tragically drowned. Later, the small steamer approached the beach and picked up the books discarded by the woman. One of them was a blue-grid, green-covered practice book with Chinese and Western circular seals on the cover. The Chinese characters said "Nanyang Girls' High School" and there were handwritten words in fountain pen "Tang Deling's friend's address," etc. It is not known whether the woman was Tang Deling or whether there was another Tang Deling. Therefore, it is specially recorded for those who are familiar with her to investigate. The addresses, house numbers, and names of many friends in Tianjin, Hankou, and this port are written in the book, including Li Hui at 30 Defuli, Chuan Highway, Baotong Road, Zhabei, Li Shenrou at 1020 North Fifth Lane, Hengqingli, Qipulu, and Lu Tongsun at 4 Yideli, Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, and Sun Jingyan at 3 Tiandeli, Tongji Road. However, there was another piece of paper on which was written "Patriotic Chain," the words were as follows:</p>
<p>Comrades, do you read the newspaper? Haven't you seen the Koreans brutally killing our overseas Chinese compatriots? We must know who is directing it. Isn't it the Japanese dwarfs who created the May 30th Incident? Since you are Chinese, then you should be determined to: (1) Overthrow imperialism. (2) Do not help the Japanese do things. (3) Do not buy any Japanese clothing, food, housing, or other utensils. (4) Do not supply the Japanese with any goods. (5) Forever sever economic ties with the Japanese. (6) Promote domestic goods. Comrades, after receiving this letter, you must fulfill your patriotic methods and please sacrifice some time within 24 hours of receiving the letter to transcribe nine copies and send them to your classmates and friends for widespread publicity. Friends, if you buy even a little Japanese goods, do not fulfill the above items, and do not forward the nine copies of the patriotic chain, then I will unceremoniously call you a slave to a fallen nation, a cold-blooded animal. According to superstition, your family will be childless, your family will be ruined, and your family will be destroyed. Friends, do you hate me? Do you scold me? Sincerely, a patriotic comrade who knows you.</p>
<p>From this, it is undoubtedly clear that the female student's suicide was due to her keen patriotism and her anger over the brutal killing of overseas Chinese compatriots by the Japanese. Although suicide is not desirable, her ambition is also worthy of pity.</p>
<h3>Worker Wrongly Accused of Theft and Beaten, Angered and Poisoned Himself to Death</h3>
<p>▲The Deceased's Aftermath is Extremely Desolate</p>
<p>▲The Perpetrators Still Attempt to Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th of this month, at 11:00 AM, in the Tao Rongji Construction Factory on Liaoyang Road, the night watchman Lao Shaoxing, also known as Chen Qingliang, 34 years old, was involved in the theft of one dan of rice and two boxes of nails from the factory. He was tied up and beaten by his colleagues, and then released. Chen felt wronged and secretly swallowed opium, which caused him to be sent to the hospital. He died despite treatment. The various circumstances have been reported in previous newspapers. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Police Station have successively arrested the perpetrators Wang Xuquan from Pudong, Lu Xuxu, Lu Xiusheng, Shen Maojian, Song Afu from Wusong, and Li Yuanhai from Haimen, and sent them to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieqiu opened the court for continued questioning. According to the statement of Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the police station, and the statement of Wu Chenshi, the younger brother of the deceased Chen Qingliang, whose original home was in Jin, had a 69-year-old mother, a wife, a 7-year-old daughter, and a 3-year-old son. He heard that he was a small worker in the factory, earning eight yuan a month, had no hobbies, and had no illnesses. At that time, he swallowed opium without knowing it. Now he demands that the perpetrators be severely punished. Wang Xuquan firmly claimed that the stolen rice and nails belonged to Lu Xiusheng, the head of the carpentry team, who asked him and Lu Xuxu to keep them. The deceased stole them, and Lu asked him to tie him up and question him, but he did not beat him. Lu Xuxu claimed that he was not instructed by Lu Xiusheng to tie him up, but that it was the idea of him and Wang Xuquan. He did not beat him either. Lu Xiusheng confessed that he was not present when Lao Shaoxing (i.e., the deceased) was tied up. Later, he saw someone tying him up, but he did not know who. He also hired lawyer Wu Linkun to defend him. Shen Maojian and Song Afu confessed that they were carpenters in the factory and had nothing to do with the tying up and beating of the deceased at the time. They asked for leniency. Li Yuanhai confessed that he and Lao Shaoxing were both small workers. He was not present when he was tied up. Because he accused him of stealing the rice and nails with him, he used an iron bar to lightly hit his left foot. Then he was released. Judge Xiao then asked Wang Xuquan and Lu Xuxu whether Shen Maojian and Song Afu participated in the tying up and beating of the deceased at the time. They all claimed that they did not. Then he ordered Shen and Song to be released on bail by a reliable shop, and the rest were detained for further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3>Case of Forced Inducement of a Foster Daughter of Judge Xiong Fei</h3>
<p>▲ Shen An'nan Appeals Against the Original Sentence</p>
<p>Xiong Fei, a judge of the Civil Execution Division of the First Special District Court, resides at No. 18, Rehe Road. He has two foster daughters, Lai Fu and Lin Xi, both around 19 years old and possessing some beauty. In February of this year (lunar calendar), both girls suddenly disappeared simultaneously. It was reported to the Huizi police station, and after investigation by Detective Xiao Shangwu, it was discovered that Lai Fu had been induced into fornication by Shen An'nan of Ningbo and was hiding in a hotel. Shen and Lai Fu were arrested and taken to the police station, but Lin Xi's whereabouts remain unknown to this day. The next morning, they were escorted to the Special Court. After questioning, Shen An'nan was sentenced to six months in prison. Lai Fu, unwilling to return home, was sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for care. These details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Shen, dissatisfied with the sentence, has hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to file an appeal. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Division Chief of the High Court, Song Yuan, along with judges Du and Gao, and Prosecutor Zheng, held a court session for the hearing. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin appeared in court on behalf of the police station to present the case. Subsequently, Judge Song questioned the appellant, Shen An'nan, about his reasons for dissatisfaction. According to Shen, he and Lai Fu became acquainted because they lived nearby. One night in February, Shen encountered Lai Fu at the intersection of North Xizang Road and inquired why she was out so late. Lai Fu claimed that she had escaped due to mistreatment by her mistress and did not want to return. Shen obtained her consent and took her to the Zhongxing Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, later moving to the China South Hotel. They eventually rented a house to live together due to financial constraints, but this was entirely of the girl's own volition and not inducement. Xiong Lai Fu was also sent to court by representatives of the Women and Children Relief Association. According to Lai Fu, she is 19 years old and met Shen in January. She escaped with Lin Xi due to mistreatment by her employer. She is a maid in the Xiong family, not a foster daughter, and has been in the Xiong residence in Jiangxi for ten years before coming to Shanghai. She now wishes to live with Shen and does not want to return. Judge Song verified the testimony and ordered the commencement of arguments. Lawyer Shen Xingxia, representing the appellant, argued that the original judgment was based on Article 257 of the Criminal Law, which punishes those who induce or abduct men or women under the age of 20 to leave the guardianship of their parents, guardians, or curators. However, Lai Fu is a maid in the Xiong Deng family, referring to Xiong Deng as "Madam." Does Xiong Deng have the right to guardianship and prosecution? Furthermore, according to Lai Fu's testimony, there is another girl named Lin Xi in the Xiong family. If they were foster daughters, one would have been sufficient; why would they need two? Moreover, the name "Lai Fu" clearly indicates that she is a servant girl. Therefore, Xiong Deng has no right to prosecute, and the original judgment should be revoked, declaring the appellant not guilty. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin then rose to respond, stating that the original trial record clearly stated that Xiong Lai Fu was indeed a foster daughter, not a servant girl. Shen's lawyer claims that because there are two girls, Lai Fu and Lin Xi, in the Xiong residence, they must be maids. This is unreasonable. Famous Shanghai figure Hartung has countless adopted sons and daughters. The name "Lai Fu" cannot be used to assume that she is a servant. The appeal should be rejected, and the original judgment upheld. Judge Song verified the testimony and ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing. Shen An'nan was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory Sues Russian for Losses</h3>
<p>▲ Chartering Vessel but Failing to Take Delivery as Agreed</p>
<p>▲ No Rental Payments Received</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory of the Navy has recently engaged lawyer Qiu Fenling to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Russian national Qiu Niheng (Chanechen, owner of the Shanghai Salvage Company) of breach of contract and demanding compensation for losses. The complaint states that the plaintiff entered into a charter agreement for the Hua'an vessel with the defendant on June 1 of this year. According to Article 13 of the contract, the charter fee was 12,000 yuan per month, calculated from the date the vessel was repaired and delivered. A check for 12,000 yuan, dated June 30, was received from the defendant on June 26, but it was not honored on the due date. By that time, the plaintiff had already completed the repair of the Hua'an vessel and was prepared to deliver it on July 4, and the defendant was formally notified to take delivery. However, the defendant not only failed to pay the charter fee as agreed but also failed to take delivery of the vessel. On July 17, the defendant issued another note, extending the payment of the 12,000 yuan charter fee to July 25, promising to compensate for all losses in case of default. However, the defendant again failed to meet the deadline. Since the Hua'an vessel was chartered by the defendant, the plaintiff notified them to prepare for delivery, and the defendant should have immediately taken delivery and paid the charter fee as agreed. The defendant's failure to take delivery constitutes a breach of contract, which is entirely their own fault. The plaintiff cannot be expected to suffer losses without cause. The court is requested to order the defendant to return the check for 12,000 yuan (prepaid rent) and pay cash, as well as to be responsible for the loss of 12,000 yuan per month from August 4 until the vessel is chartered out again, and legal interest from July 4 until the date of execution, and to bear the costs of this lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Shouyi held a hearing to summon the parties. The defendant's lawyer requested a postponement, stating that they had just been appointed and had not had time to prepare. Chen Zaofan, representing the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory, recounted the circumstances of the case. Judge Guo then adjourned the hearing for a later date.</p>

<h3>Master Killed by Pet Tiger Cat</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Jingcai Loved His Cat, But Was Bitten to Death</p>
<p>Wang Jingcai, a native of Jingjiang residing at No. 124, Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai, kept a large male tiger cat. It was incredibly agile at catching rats, and the owner loved it. However, a few days ago (the 18th), the cat's behavior changed. It ate less. The owner thought it was sick and bought Wuyao (Lindera root) to mix with its food. (It is said that Wuyao can cure cat illnesses.) However, after eating it, the cat fiercely bit the owner several times. At the time, he only felt unbearable pain. Several days later, Wang experienced severe itching and pain at the bite site and began foaming at the mouth. In an instant, Wang lost consciousness and rolled and crawled on the ground. His family immediately hired a car to take Wang to the Labor Hospital for treatment. However, he died en route before reaching the hospital. It is truly strange.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of Gunfire and Resisting Arrest in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ The Reason Was a Conspiracy to Rob Land</p>
<p>Gang policemen Deng Zhiming and Zhang Jinshan, leading Du Futang and others from the Third Branch of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, were on duty at Caoxi Road around 4 a.m. the day before yesterday when they saw a white-plate operating car with the city license number 4429 carrying four people, heading south from the north. Because it was late at night, their behavior was suspicious, so they immediately ordered the car to stop for inspection. Two passengers got out of the car and were searched, and no illegal items were found. When the third person got out, unexpectedly, he pulled out a gun and fired at the police, firing several shots. The police also drew their guns and returned fire, and the car immediately turned around and fled. The three people who got out of the car also fled in different directions. This was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that the criminals were indeed conspiring to rob land in the countryside. Earlier, Mao Caichen, a farmer residing at No. 17, Maojia Catholic Church, West Caohijing Town, learned that Mao Songtao next door had a large quantity of opium. On the afternoon of the 19th, he reported to Mao Jiusheng (a mason, 22 years old) in his clan on Rue Gascogne in the French Concession.</p>
<p>They agreed to go rob the opium that night. After receiving the message, Jiusheng invited Xie Amao, Xu Guansheng, Lao San, and four others. At around 3 a.m. on the 20th, they went to the Dade Motor Company at No. 1194 Route Lafayette and rented a covered car with the city license number 4429, driven by Feng Aqi, and sped to Dexi Road. They were inspected by the gang policemen and fired shots to escape. Xie Amao, sitting in the front of the car, forced Feng Aqi to drive away. Helplessly, Feng drove back to the concession and reported to the Lujiiawan Police Station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, it was decided that the case occurred in the interior, so Detective Li Yaolong, Tang Hao, and others were sent to the Sixth District Third Branch, along with Xie Amao and the car driver Feng Aqi, and the car No. 4429, for investigation. At the same time, Zhou Yida, the police chief of the Tushanwan Police Station of the Sixth District Second Branch, also heard gunshots and police sirens and led the police to search the area. Mao Jiusheng was apprehended in the riverbank behind the Shunzhi Guild Hall on Tianyaoqiao Road and taken back to the station. After interrogation by Director Liu, he confessed that at around 3 a.m. today, he and his friends Xu Guansheng, Lao San, and Xie Amao went to Mao Songtao's house at Maojia Catholic Church, West Caohijing Town, to rob opium. They had a pistol, and when they encountered the police at Caoxi Road, Xu Guansheng fired the gun directly, and they fled in different directions. Director Liu then sent Patrol Officer Wang Xuce and Liu Shaoqing, the leader of the Sixth District Detective Team, along with Detective Cao Chuqiao, Patrol Officer Fu Xingen of the Third Branch, and Police Chief Man Qiwei, to search Mao Songtao's house at the Catholic Church with Mao Jiusheng. However, Mao had also fled beforehand, and there was no opium in the house. Mao Caichen, who sent the message, was also apprehended. After separate and strict interrogation by Director Liu, all the defendants admitted to the robbery. The gun belonged to Xu Guansheng, and he was the one who fired it. After obtaining the confession, Director Liu temporarily released Feng Aqi and ordered the police to strictly apprehend the three fugitives: Xu Guansheng, Lao San, and Mao Songtao, who sold the opium, for investigation. Mao Jiusheng, Xie Amao, and Mao Caichen were all sent to the bureau for strict punishment according to the law.</p>

A camera was placed on the dock, and a white banner reading "Welcome Mr. Hong Shen and Mr. Garson from America to Shanghai" was hung high. At that time, the welcomers surrounded Mr. Hong and others as they disembarked from the ship. The cameraman moved the camera to record the scene on film.

<h3>Wu Gunong Covered in Excrement</h3>
<p>▲ Qingpu Doctor Arrives to Diagnose Dead Pulse</p>
<p>▲ Police Station Doesn't Handle Legal Matters</p>
<p>Wu Gunong, a pediatric specialist from Qingpu, has been making a decent living with his ancestral skills. However, he is inherently slow, so his house calls are usually in the middle of the night, neglecting the patients. Hence, he has the nickname "Muddlehead." Recently, Zhang Qixiang, the manager of the Xiangtai Xin dry goods store in Hongkou, took his sick child to the store for convenience and specifically hired Wu to treat him. However, by the time Doctor Wu arrived in Shanghai, his child had already been dead for several hours. Zhang, grief-stricken, thought that Doctor Wu treated human life like grass, completely delaying the treatment. However, he still treated Doctor Wu cordially, inviting him upstairs to examine the child. Zhang had Doctor Wu take the dead child's pulse. Wu, realizing something was wrong, hurriedly tried to escape, but one of the store's apprentices threw the pre-arranged excrement at Doctor Wu's face, covering his head with it. The stench was unbearable. Doctor Wu's servant, who had come with him, immediately shouted for the police, and they were all taken to the Harbin Police Station for investigation. After questioning by the police chief, it was decided that this case was within the scope of the law and should be prosecuted in court, not under the jurisdiction of the police station. It is said that Doctor Wu intends to file a formal lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Unforeseen Disaster While Driving for Pleasure</h3>
<p>▲ Seven People, Including Men, Women, the Elderly, and Children, Injured</p>
<p>▲ Good Fortune and Misfortune Depend on Each Other; It's Best to Be Content</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at around 5 a.m., seven people, including men, women, the elderly, and children, suddenly arrived at the Herde Motor Company at No. A-1709 Avenue Edward VII, claiming to rent a car to drive around Wusong. The company's accountant ordered driver Yao Kunsheng to drive a covered car, No. 17573, to their destination. When the car reached the vicinity of Jungong Road, the driver, seeing that the area was desolate and there were few pedestrians, accelerated. He intended to drive to the Wusong seaside, but misfortune is unpredictable, and an accident occurred. Due to excessive speed, the car accidentally hit a large tree on the side of the road while turning on Jungong Road, causing irreparable damage to the machinery. The passengers in the car were all injured. After the police from the Seventh District Public Security Bureau arrived after receiving the report, they first took the driver Yao Kun into custody for investigation. The injured people hired another car and went to the Baolong Hospital for treatment. The names of the injured people are listed as follows: Shi Chendong, 25 years old, Suzhou native, tailor, injured his left forehead; Liu Laoqi, 15 years old, Suzhou native, injured his arms, etc.; Liu Laoliu, 18 years old, female, Suzhou native, injured her face and lips; Liu Zhangyou, a child, 12 years old, Suzhou native, abrasions on his hands; Mao Jinda, male, 22 years old, Suzhou native, beef seller, injured his face; Yan Dalang, male, 38 years old, Chongming native, bamboo craftsman, fractured his left arm; Yang Mingming, male, 24 years old, Suzhou native, minor injuries to the top of his head.

<h3>Deserter Who Stole Military Equipment Apprehended</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, around 5 a.m., on the Shanghai-Taicang Motor Road, a large man, about six feet tall or more, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and white shorts, carrying four rifles on his back and bullets wrapped around his waist, was walking on the Shihe Bridge west of Dachang. He was resting on the bridge. At that time, there were many villagers from the area and two plainclothes security guards on the bridge, enjoying the cool air. Seeing the large man, they asked what he was carrying on his back. The large man replied that they were water pipes (because the guns were wrapped in cloth). They also saw bullets wrapped around his waist, which made them even more suspicious. The large man angrily said, "They are rifles! Do you dare to take them?" As he spoke, he put down the guns and threw them on the bridge, saying, "Do you dare to take them?" After a while, he left. The two guards knew that he was not a good person, so they followed him to see what he was up to. They walked to the vicinity of Maqiao, which is about three miles away from Dachang. The sky was just beginning to brighten. Seeing that he was being followed, the large man loaded the guns with bullets and fired several shots. The guards lay down in the fields to avoid the bullets and fled back to the regiment headquarters to report. They also reported to the Security Office's company, which sent a large number of armed soldiers and guards to arrest him. At that time, the villagers of Maqiao, hearing the gunshots, suspected that there were bandits and started beating gongs and drums, armed with wooden sticks, shoulder poles, etc., and surrounded the area to capture him. The soldiers arrived and also fired back. The large man, seeing that he was outnumbered, threw the guns and bullets into the river and surrendered empty-handed. He was taken back to the company headquarters. At the same time, the abandoned guns and bullets were recovered. After interrogation by the company clerk, he confessed that his name was Chen Fusheng, 26 years old, from Liuhe. He had joined the 5th Mortar Team in Zhabei, Shanghai, on May 7. The guns were stolen from the armory upstairs, lowered down with a rope, so the guards were unaware. He passed through many police checkpoints, and no one interfered. He said that the local people were really formidable, and he would rather die than suffer. After verifying the confession, the company clerk reported to company commander Zhang Xueli, who took a memorial and escorted him to Shanghai by car at 8 a.m. yesterday and then transferred him to the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to be sent to the Songjiang Pacification Command (i.e., the Second Regiment Headquarters of the Jiangsu Security Office) for investigation.</p>

<h3>Customs Announces Measures for Inland Goods Transshipment Tax</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has stipulated matters concerning the inland goods transshipment tax and officially announced its implementation yesterday. The original text is recorded below. It is now stipulated that all inland goods transshipped from this trading port to another trading port for export to foreign countries, or re-exported to foreign countries, shall be handled in accordance with the following measures from the date of this announcement: (1) (A) For inland goods, including silks, lacquerware, and paper umbrellas, transported to a trading port that should pay the transshipment tax, or transported to foreign countries that should be exempt from the export tax, and declared to be transshipped to foreign countries via other ports, it is now necessary to handle them in accordance with the measures for machine-made goods transported to foreign factories via trading ports. That is, the goods are exempt from tax at the port of origin, but a stamp is affixed to the duplicate manifest, stating that if the goods are not transported to foreign countries within the prescribed transshipment period at the final port, the port will collect the transshipment tax. (B) For the above-mentioned inland goods that have paid the transshipment tax at the original port of shipment and declared that they will be re-exported to foreign countries from the final port within one year, the transshipment tax paid will be refunded by the final port to which the goods are transported to foreign countries upon presentation of the tax payment certificate or export certificate. When the above-mentioned measures are implemented, all guarantee measures for lacquerware and paper umbrellas will be abolished. However, the current guarantee measures for straw hats and straw hat braids, as well as the tax payment measures, will all be handled as before. (2) (A) For inland goods transported to a trading port that should be exempt from the transshipment tax, or transported to foreign countries that should pay the export tax, and declared to be transshipped to foreign countries at the original port of shipment, the export tax should be paid at that port.

(3) For taxable inland goods declared to be shipped abroad via other ports, and the export tax has been paid at the original port of shipment, if they are not exported abroad at the final port but are consumed at other ports, the port that consumes the goods should verify the tax payment certificate or export certificate issued by the original port of shipment, and refund or collect the difference between the transshipment tax and the export tax. (4) For taxable inland goods that are not declared for transshipment tax, or re-exported to foreign countries, or are transported domestically and their transshipment tax has been paid at the original port of shipment, if they are subsequently re-exported to foreign countries by other ports within one year of the original document reaching that port, the final port should verify the tax payment certificate or export certificate issued by the original port of shipment, and collect or refund the difference between the export tax and the transshipment tax. The above measures are hereby announced for the information of all merchants.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Announces Deadline for Payment of Brokerage Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau issued an announcement yesterday stating, "Brokerage tax is a special fund for education and is related to education expenses. Everyone should actively pay it in turn to fulfill the obligation of taxpayers. It has been found that many brokers in the county do not exchange their licenses on time when they expire. Some brokers even hide and do not comply with the regulations to obtain licenses. They engage in unlicensed brokerage activities, hoping to take advantage of loopholes, and this has become a prevailing practice. Since taking office, the director of this bureau has repeatedly received strict orders from the Education Funding Management Office to rectify the situation and can no longer tolerate concealment and delay. Therefore, this announcement is hereby issued to all brokers in the county for their information. If your brokerage license is about to expire, you must come to the bureau to donate and exchange for a new license within this month when it expires. If you fail to do so, you will be punished according to the regulations. Those who have newly established brokerage firms must also quickly come to the bureau to obtain licenses and start their business, and must not wait and delay the exchange, which may lead to punishment. In addition to dispatching personnel to conduct random inspections at any time, this announcement is hereby issued. Furthermore, the personnel dispatched by this bureau for investigation will be issued investigation brokerage license stamps as proof. Be careful not to be deceived. Please be informed."</p>

<h3>Domestic Bulk Hibiscus Seeds Available for Sale</h3>
<p>▲Good News for the Paper Industry Amidst the Boycott of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Hibiscus seeds are a raw material for papermaking and are produced in Japan. Every year, imports amount to no less than hundreds of thousands, resulting in the outflow of profits, which is a pity. Now, the Shichang Plant Seedling Farm in Dawan, Chuansha, recognizing that boycotting Japanese goods must start from practical measures, carefully selected seeds, researched cultivation, and planted more than 110 acres in total. It is estimated that this year's output will be more than 500 dan, specifically for state-run paper mills. If paper mills need this raw material, they can directly contact the farm. This is also good news amidst the boycott.</p>

Because there are no comprehensive textbooks available in the market for the subjects taught by Wang Jun, he compiled and printed "On Property Law" and "Outline of Bankruptcy Law" last year, which became popular in the country. It is now heard that he has also written "Outline of Commercial Law" based on his years of experience in commercial law. It discusses in detail the evolution of commercial law in our country, the merits and demerits of commercial law in various countries, and the legal principles of commercial law. The content is rich, and the style is precise. The entire book is about 200,000 words, bound in one volume, and sells for 2.20 yuan. It is currently being bound and will be published within a day or two. At the same time, he felt that the previous compilation of "Outline of Bankruptcy Law" was slightly brief, and scholars might find it difficult to fully understand. Therefore, he also re-compiled "On Bankruptcy Law", using simple words to express the subtle and profound legal principles, and exhausting his thoughts on the difficult problems of bankruptcy, clarifying them one by one, without being perfunctory. He also compiled the judgments and interpretations of the former Dali Yuan on bankruptcy cases and appended them to enable readers to know how to apply them. At the end, he added the draft of the Chinese Bankruptcy Law and translated the new Japanese Bankruptcy Law for readers' reference. It is truly a comprehensive book on bankruptcy law. It is now nearing completion of printing and is scheduled to be published on September 1st. The price is also 2.20 yuan. It is heard that the Shangwen Store on Xiaoximen Shangwen Road will first sell pre-orders at a 10% discount. There will be no discount after publication. The above-mentioned books have been agreed to be sold on consignment by the Commercial Press and its branches, as well as Shangwen Store and the Nanjing Law Review Society. No other consignment sales will be made.</p>

The other is two groups of hexagrams, "Earth-Heaven Peace" and "Swamp-Wind Great Excess" from the Book of Changes, which are engraved on the left and right sides. A small red enamel heart is inlaid in the middle of the reverse side to represent the upright heart, with three upright lines engraved on each side, with different lengths and heights. At first glance, they do not form words. When you move your finger and rotate them, they become the English words "I LOVE YOU", and the Chinese words "True Love". They are quite artistic and are welcomed by people in academic circles. Because they can rotate, they are also called "Rotating Chapters". It is heard that this type of rotating chapter can only be manufactured with advanced arithmetic, so other companies cannot imitate it.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I read the news in today's issue of your newspaper about the Qingli news of the Zhihe Money Shop, which stated that the total amount of debts owed was about 2 million yuan, and that the Lawyers from the Fair Legal Firm and accountant Xu Yinghao, etc. have been entrusted by the Money Industry Association to clear up etc. The Zhihe Money Shop is a small business and not a member of our Association. This time, the liquidation of the shop, was announced by the Xu Yinghao Accountants Chao Chuan Ding Lawyers representatives, and was appointed by the shop itself, not by our Association. Due to inaccurate news, I am writing to clarify this matter, and I would like to ask your newspaper to publish this letter in the Letters to the Editor section, in order to make the facts known. Sincerely, Shanghai Money Industry Association, August 21, 20th year.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I read in your newspaper that Ji Sun, a person from Yancheng, committed suicide by taking poison at No. 47 London Road, Zhabei.

<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Rubber Industry in the South Seas</p>
<p>The rubber industry in the South Seas is exceptionally developed. If travelers take a train from Singapore to Penang, it takes seven hours. The area it goes through is over 300 miles. You can see continuous rubber trees from the train window. There isn't a minute that you don't see them. The number of rubber trees is imaginable.</p>
<p>Unexpected Luck</p>
<p>One day, a tourist came to an art shop in Geneva, Switzerland. He paid five shillings for a small, dusty, and dirty oil painting as a souvenir of his trip. When he went back, he wiped off the dust and was overjoyed. It turned out that the painting was actually the work of the great Italian painter G. Reni, which is not easy to find on the market. If it is sold to a connoisseur, he can make a small fortune.</p>
<p>A Person Without Pain in His Life</p>
<p>In a small village in Lincolnshire, England, an old man named Allen T. Vlleno died at the age of ninety-five. It is said that he never had any pain in his life and did not know what disease was. What a piece of luck.</p>
<h3>Qing Daoren's Treat and Mao Heting's Departure from Beijing</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Linchuan Qing Daoren has been away from his friends for eleven years. His sixty-fifth birthday is coming up in a few days. I remember when he was selling his art in Shanghai, he was good at being a guest, but never a host. One day, he was commissioned to write a piece and received a generous payment. He suddenly sent out invitations to his friends for a banquet at a restaurant. His friends were all surprised. The poet Yu Keshi wrote a poem to mock him, saying, "Selling books gradually brings the intention of being treated well, getting a treat is all a freebie. Eating at restaurants is only a momentary thing, it is easier to go on a trip than to stay at home." Daoren smiled when he saw it. The rhyme of Yu's poem comes from Mao Heting's poem about leaving Beijing. Around 1912, many scholars and officials lingered in the old capital. They were poor and had nowhere to return. Mao styled himself as a remnant of the old dynasty and formed a society with two or three poet friends. They drank and sang, agreeing that not accepting official positions from the Republic was noble. His name card was written with "Former Qing Fourth-Rank Beijing Official." Before long, he was appointed as the Superintendent of the Wenzhou Customs. Mao did not know what to do but reluctantly took the job. When he left the capital, a friend said at the station, "We are here to see off the remnant of the old dynasty leaving the mountains." Mao wrote a poem to explain himself, which contained four lines saying, "Writing articles cannot be sold for gold, people of this generation mostly give white eyes. To starve to death is only a momentary thing, it is easier to live alone than to support a family." It was a shameless self-explanation, and his heart was bitter. One day, Yu said to his family, "Life is getting harder and harder, we are suffering from this era, how can we get through it? In the future, we will not be able to manage it." His concubine said, "Unless we stop socializing and treating guests. If we want to live a long and stable life, we can only be vegetarian, which is the most economical. This way, we can save a lot of money." Yu imitated Mao's poem to explain it, saying, "Vegetable oil is cheaper than lard, fat people should not look down on skinny people. Eating vegetarian food is only a momentary thing, it is easier to live alone than to support a family." He picked it up casually, showing his skill.</p>
<h3>My Views on Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The methods of controlling floods are as follows: Gun embanked floods, while Yu dredged ditches and diverted rivers. "Embank" means to block, and "dredge" means to deepen. He deepened the ditches to connect them to the rivers. Therefore, Yu was able to govern the world, while Gun failed after nine years of effort. Piling firewood to block the gourd dike and carrying soil to block the Mengjin ferry are merely superficial solutions, not addressing the root cause. Reading reports on water disasters, they all state that the water level is higher than the sea level, which is why breaching causes disasters. Water naturally flows downward, so the key is to guide it according to the terrain. Hence, the annotations in the Yi and Ji Model mention that the famous rivers of the nine provinces are connected to the sea. The explanation emphasizes that small channels lead to large ones, so water flows from ditches to gullies, then to streams, then to rivers, and finally to the sea. Therefore, Yu's method of controlling floods was simply to focus on dredging the ditches, which is what made him superior to Gun. Now, the focus is solely on the upstream, without considering the downstream areas. This is like a water pipe losing its key connection, and the underground drain is blocked, causing water to overflow into the courtyard. At this point, trying to block the source is futile; the only solution is to clear the blockage to allow drainage. Underground, there are existing channels, so one should not resort to harming one's neighbors. However, if the neighboring channels are also blocked, then joint effort is needed to clear the blockage, ensuring that the water flows through the main road's drainage into the Huangpu River before stopping. This will prevent the Huangpu River from backflowing. Now, there is discussion about opening dams, but it is being obstructed, like the situation where neighboring channels are blocked, causing panic. But if neighbors stand idly by and refuse to join in clearing the channels, then flooding will be unavoidable. Therefore, the current plan should be to quickly provide work relief, leading these disaster victims to rush to the downstream areas and cooperate with the local people to dredge the ditches, preventing the arrival of floodwaters. The method should be based on the system of craftsmen in the Zhou Rituals. One person's effort should only dig to a width of half a foot. Two people form a pair, working from top to bottom. The work of one pair, one foot wide and one foot deep, is called a "quanche." At the head of the field, it should be doubled, two feet wide and two feet deep, which is called a "sui," to store the water. Nine people form a well, with a space of four feet wide and four feet deep, called a "gou," to receive the downstream water from the "quanche" and "sui." Every ten li forms a "cheng," with a space of eight feet wide and eight feet deep, called a "xu," to receive the water from the "gou." Every hundred li forms a "tong," with a space of two "xun" wide and two "ren" deep, called a "hui," which directly connects to the river, and from the river, it flows into the sea. At the beginning, one should complete one li in a day as a model, and then the collective effort can be distributed to dredge the downstream areas. Every village and town should, at this moment, exert their efforts in the ditches. Then, even if the Ru and Han rivers were to be diverted to drain the Huai and Si rivers, the water can still flow from the ditches into the rivers and into the sea. This is the same principle as unblocking the underground drain mentioned above. With the effort of one person, only digging half a foot wide and one foot deep, moving forward without stopping, the success will be swift. If there are a thousand people working for a day, the distance covered will be almost like a military march. The excavated soil can be placed on the side to be used as embankments to protect the fields. Then, fields that could only hold one foot of water can now hold three feet. The water will be dispersed, reducing its force, and the massive flood will be transformed into small streams, flowing out through different routes, just as the disaster victims are divided into groups to work. This will not cause harm. In the future, if there is drought, this water can be used to irrigate the fields. This is the merit of the "Dao Ren" in the Zhou Rituals and is a good method. At this time, when the cries of grief are everywhere and people have no place to live and cannot find food, if one person leads ten people to dredge the ditches and channels, and the disaster relief funds are used as wages, simply deepening the existing field ditches and waterways downstream, it does not require special skills, and both superficial and fundamental solutions can be achieved. I don't understand why this approach is not taken, but instead, people lament the high water level compared to the sea, knowing that a great disaster is coming, but not devising a plan to manage it. They are imitating Gun and not learning from Yu. Is it true that those in power are confused, while the onlookers are clear? The rivers and seas do not reject small streams. I hope that those in power will not dismiss these words as irrelevant. Then, once the mobilization order is issued, the God of the River will surrender at the mere sight of it, and the benefits will last for a thousand years. It's not just for the immediate moment.

<h3>New Dancing Record</h3>
<p>— Yao Ying</p>
<p>A dance endurance competition was recently held in Paris. The winner was named Tat Shide Lai. He danced for a total of seven hundred and fifty-two hours. Also, Mr. Maimuren and the French girl Fulan danced together. As a result, they ranked first and won a prize of one hundred gold coins.</p>
<p>When they announced that they would no longer dance, the girl had already worn out twenty pairs of dancing shoes, and the young man had also changed eight pairs. The runners-up were a young dancing couple. They stopped the day before because his partner's hamstring was strained.</p>
<p>The music they danced to was accompanied by electrical phonograph records. They were allowed a fifteen-minute break every hour, day and night. In addition to the expense of the prizes, the organizers of this grand dance party had a surplus of one thousand six hundred gold pounds.</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary on Famous Artists' Excellent Records</h3>
<p>— Shaoqing</p>
<p>Recently, my asthma flared up, confining me to my humble abode. My mind was troubled and confused, and I didn't know what to say. Fortunately, a friend lent me dozens of new records from the Gaoting Company. After listening to them for ten days, my illness was cured. It's amazing that singing can cure illnesses! So, I wrote this brief commentary as a thank you to the doctor.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou and Hao Shouchun sing "Lianhuan Tao" together. They are evenly matched and have equal skills. One coughs out jade-like words, and the other roars like the wind and clouds. The dialogue is meticulous, making the listeners' faces light up with joy. Ma Lianliang and Shang Xiaoyun sing "Tan Mu Hui Ling" and "Sang Yuan Hui." They are eloquent and meticulous in their choice of words, avoiding the beaten path. They are truly extraordinary. Qiu Guixian, Shang Xiaoyun, and Wang Shaolou sing "Er Jin Gong" together. With voices like iron and copper, they interweave the evening breeze and the remnant moon. The palace and commercial tones compete, each displaying their talents. Xue Yancin's "Pan Si Dong" and "Hui Long Ge" are like beautiful women adorning flowers and lovely birds singing in spring. The wonderful sounds are natural and unadorned. Xue Yancin and Wang Shaolou sing "Mei Long Zhen" together. The tones are novel, and the flavor is profound. Xun Huisheng's new drama, "Huan Zhu Yin," uses ancient short-sentence poems to compose a "Si Ping Diao." The idea is novel, and the rhythm is beautiful. Innovators of new tunes can use it as a reference. Professor Liu Tianhua's solo performance on the Nanhu, "Bing Zhong Yin" and "Kong Shan Niao Yu," are original compositions, exceptionally precious. The wonderful thing is that the music contains emotion, refreshing and pleasing to the ear. In addition, there are Liu Baoquan's "Nao Jiang Zhou Dan Dao Hui" in Dagushu, which is慷慨激昂generous and impassioned, Bai Yunpeng's "Daiyu Feng Gao"纒綿悱惻 which is melancholic and moving, and Lao Wogua's "Quan Wawa," which is滑稽可喜 humorous and delightful. The story-telling songs include Shen Jian'an and Xue Xiaoqing's "Zhen Zhu Ta," Xia Hesheng's "San Xiao," and Wang Meiyu's "Yang Liu Qing," etc., which are宛轉動人 touching and moving. There are many other excellent records, too numerous to mention. They are all new releases from the Gaoting Company.</p>

<h3>Travelogue of India (87)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The reason why Brahmins have power is not only their doctrine but also their external protective organization, which is the caste system. They use strict methods to form a political, religious, and social system, making it weak but inviolable. External religions cannot break it. This is quite strange. As for their doctrine, the vastness and extensiveness of the Huayan school, the mysteriousness of the Mahavairocana Buddha and various sutras, the peculiar and obscure concepts of multiple gods, one god, and no god, and the intricate and esoteric nature of the Vijnanavada and Dharmalaksana schools are all derived from Hinduism. Only the caste system is problematic. Indian Hinduism is a new image of the world. Who can question it? If a leader like Gandhi uses politics and economics, it is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Recently, many young people have wished to break their caste system, but I see that the arguments against it and in favor of the caste system also seem reasonable. The principle of not being thorough is why Mr. Lu Xin's great work has value. What shall I do with the doctrine of the Great White Cow?</p>
<p>However, our Chinese cows are all yellow and black, lacking white cows. If I return to China from India, I will definitely buy a white cow to bring back. The Great White Cow represents Indian civilization, which is quite laughable.</p>
<p>Indian youths also slightly advocate free love. However, they encounter a major obstacle, which is the bloodline theory of the caste system myth. Indians believe in gods and want to be close to gods, so they must emphasize lineage. Therefore, the Brahmin caste is the most noble, making it easier to approach the gods. Even if they are not of this caste, they cannot marry other races because their bloodline has been in contact with the gods for a long time, making it the most noble. However, as science advances in the future, it should be able to break this arrogance.</p>
<p>I am writing this section to describe the great power of the new Brahmin religion, which is beyond my expectations. I never dreamed of it because I have looked down on this religion for many years. After coming to India, I also despised its caste system and naturally sneered at its custom of valuing cows. However, after visiting Gandhi and rereading Gandhi's biography, and observing from various aspects of India, I felt moved and wrote this. If Indian culture can be revived like this, I think Chinese people should also pay attention to it. Do not be slaves to others, and do not be too superficial. Research must be deep and thorough in world culture and academics to contribute to construction. Older people should not be stubborn, and younger people should not be superficial. Then we will be close to success. There is a poem as evidence: The Great White Cow of Indian Civilization (detailed in the Lotus Sutra). Deep sorrowful vows release kindness and enmity. Where is the new image of the East today? Kick up wind and clouds, a pleasure continent. (Buddhist sutras, utopian society) Although Chu has only three households, it will destroy Qin. There is not a single Buddhist disciple on the earth. After reading Byron, I grieve for Greece. Stroking Shewei, I often wipe my scarf. (Byron, an English poet, admired Greek culture and helped it fight for independence and died.) A hundred feelings linger when reading Byron. A poetic heart and chivalrous bones are a natural endowment. Serving in the temple (Lengyan language) is to repay kindness. Uphold righteousness together to support the wheel of culture.</p>
<p>Storytelling and Helping Society</p>
<h3>Woman, Woman (26)</h3>
<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>Miss Ding also forgot to resent and be angry for herself, but she was more resentful and more angry for the wife of Xiao Rong who was dragged along in the muddy water. Looking at the extraordinary conflict between the cruel strong and the yielding weak, she finally ignited the fire of sympathy for the weak. She also rushed out, braving the rain, shouting, meaning to seek help from anyone. Qiu Zi also followed behind, screaming madly and running swiftly. But there was no obstacle to Xiao Rong's violence.</p>
<p>The sky was as dark as night, especially in the heavy rain, and this section of the road was so deserted that there was not a single pedestrian. Xiao Rong still dragged his wife forward with force, running forward aimlessly.</p>
<p>After walking hundreds of steps, Xiao Rong's wife on the ground no longer showed any signs of resistance, but at this time Xiao Rong did not feel anything other than his own anger. He was still dragging his wife forward, panting with anger, to the intersection.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a car sped past from the cross street. Although there were several horn warnings, it was useless to Xiao Rong, especially in the thunderstorm, the sky was as dark as night, so Xiao Rong was knocked down by the car.</p>
<p>Miss Ding was the first to see the occurrence of this new tragedy, and immediately ran over with Qiu Zi. The car had stopped, and the two people lying on the ground were lifted into the car, ready to be sent to the hospital. Although a lot of blood was found on Xiao Rong's body, Miss Ding had no pity for him, she only saw that Xiao Rong's wife had fainted, and she felt very sad.</p>
<p>Then, in the hospital, Xiao Rong finally received natural punishment and left this sinful world in extremely painful groans. Xiao Rong's wife, however, only suffered some fright and stimulation, and recovered after a few days of treatment.</p>
<p>Miss Ding got the news of Xiao Rong's death at home first—Qiu Zi had inquired about it—and secretly shed tears behind people's backs, crying for her own unfortunate experience.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's wife could only return to Miss Ding's place again. Miss Ding seemed very pitying and apologetic to her, so she exchanged the diamond ring that Xiao Rong had given her for money, and gave her some clothes and other things, and sent her back to her home in Suzhou. Xiao Rong's wife kept shedding tears on one hand, but was very grateful on the other hand. However, this gratitude was something that Miss Ding's conscience dared not accept.</p>
<p>Soon, school started. There were two fewer students, Mr. Lu and Miss Ding. Li Wenyao made a phone call to the Ding's house on Tongfu Road, and the telephone bureau said, "The phone there has been removed."</p>
<p>Later, Li Wenyao went there himself once, but a sign for rent had been hung on the gate of the Ding's house. (The End)</p>

<h3>Gold Standard Plunges Suddenly</h3>
<p>▲ Retreats into the Eighty Taels Range</p>
<p>▲ Falls Sharply by Ten Taels and Seven Fens Yesterday, the 21st, the gold standard showed weakness again, the situation was weak, the decline was rapid, and the progress was slow. The market as a whole had a review of ten taels. As a result, it fell sharply by ten taels and more. People were panicked and eager to sell, almost like the silver market before. It opened slightly lower, and then the exchange rate loosened, the listed price did not change, and Yuankang, Xiangchang, etc. sold actively, so the price continued to decline. Finally, it fell into eighty-two taels. It stabilized at noon. The selling trend was even stronger in the later market, especially the exchange rate was quite firm, so British gold was 1.26875, both buying and selling were possible. Finally, the bank bought in at 1.275, so the gold price was even more tired, and suddenly broke into the seven hundred and eighty taels range, which was really unexpected.</p>
<p>▲ Morning Market Gradually Shows Weakness From the opening of the market in the early tenth month, it dropped by one tael and one qian, to seven hundred and eighty-eight taels and a half. The big bars and silver prices still have no connection, and the European market is dull. Only the private telegram fell by one-sixteenth, without being affected, and also because the US stocks rose slightly. Yongfeng, Tongchang, Shunli, Wanxing, etc. all had sales, and then fell from eighty-eight taels, seven or eight qian to five taels and seven qian. The exchange rate immediately showed a loose trend. The bank bought British gold for the tenth month at 1.2625, and sold the price for December at the same time. Then, it still absorbed 625 in October, and Zhifeng, Yongyifeng, Yuyuan Chun, etc. came in, adding slightly more than one tael, to seven taels and three qian. The British gold listing was not changed, and the time was about seven taels. Fuyu, Richang, Yuankang, Xiang, Xiexingyong, etc. poured sales on the market, and the British gold was even more scarce. Mitsui sold 625 in September and absorbed 625 to 6875 in December, so by about ten o'clock it fell to eighty-three taels and five qian. Soon, Sumitomo and HSBC mutually traded 625 in September, and Gan Changxiang, Hongli, Yuanmao, Yong, etc. bought in, raising it to five taels and seven qian. However, recently Mitsui sold 625 in British gold, and Yuankangxiang continued to sell it, and Fuyu, Xiexingyong, etc. followed suit, so it dropped to eighty-two taels and three qian. At half past ten, Yuanheng, etc. bought in, recovering one tael, seven or eight qian, to four taels and one qian. However, the selling spirit was not tired, Yuanmao, Yiyifeng, Yong, etc. came to sell, and it fell more than two taels again, to eighty-one taels and seven qian near eleven o'clock. Afterwards, it seemed to turn gentle, but there were ups and downs of more than one tael. By eleven fifty, it was eighty-four taels. The Indian exchange rate was large and small, but it didn't matter. The noon closing was three taels and two qian, and continued to do within and without three taels. The revealed price was still eight hundred and seventeen taels and eight qian, with a total of thirty-one or two taels to thirty-five or six taels.</p>
<p>▲ After the market plunged thousands of miles After the market opened at eighty-three taels, Yuda, Juchang, etc. sold it, and the Indian exchange rate reported a large one anna, which dropped to eighty-two taels. Before long, it raised one tael zero, which was a retail purchase, entering at two and three quarters to three taels and two, and then it was quite flat, and transactions were limited. Until after three o'clock, Tongtaichang, Hongxingyong and Shunliwan sold them, because Bombay sold British gold at 625, at three and a half o'clock it was eighty-one taels and seven qian, and then added six or seven qian. The exchange rate was even more loose. British gold in October was 75, and Japanese banks had received it. Yongfeng, Dadecheng, Gan Changxiang, Yuanchun, Yongfengcheng, Yucheng Yong and goods rose like a storm, agreeing to sell it, and the market had a general idea of ​​falling thousands of miles, and even broke eighty taels, and it dropped to seventy-eight taels and eight qian at four o'clock. In a short time, it went back to one tael, which was a set-head purchase. At four ten minutes, it was eighty taels and four qian. There was no way to get rid of the emptiness of the world, and by the time the market closed at four thirty, it was only seventy-eight taels and nine qian, which was more than ten taels and seven qian compared to the previous day. After the market closed, it was suppressed to between eight taels. The maximum of one day was eighty-eight taels and eight qian, and the minimum was seventy-eight taels and eight qian, and a total of ten taels was returned.</p>
<p>▲ The current red plus eight and a half taels of goods was seven and a half taels in the early market, three taels in the noon closing, three taels in the afternoon, and the closing was seventy-eight taels. The revealed price was thirty-five to thirty-nine taels, and the registration was eighty to eighty-three taels. The water replenishment was eighty taels, and the afternoon was seventy-six taels. The current red bar was calculated to add eight and a half taels, although the way out was stagnant, but the industry was holding up. Taikangrun received more than one thousand taels, which were sold by Yingfenghng, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Transactions are still lively and the transactions on the counter are still sensitive, but the sellers are enthusiastic. Statistics show that Gan Changxiang, Tong Taichang, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Yifenyong, Shunli, and Wanxing all came in, and Yuantai, Yuancheng, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Hengyu, Daxingyong, etc. came out and went in from time to time. Yuankangxiang sold two or three thousand bars on behalf of a speculator from Fuxingyong, Yongfeng, Richang, Xiexingyong, Futaiheng, Yuda, Cuichangyong, and Yuanmaoyong all came out. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Yifenyong, Gan Changxiang, Yuanxingyong, and Yanyu all came in, Tong Taichang, Futaiheng, Shunli, Wanxing, Richang, Yuda, Yongfeng, Yongfengcheng, Dadecheng, Yucheng Yong, Zhifengyong, Longsheng and set the heads of goods also came out, Yuantai customers came in and out of the receipts without payment, Guangbang still had no considerable transactions, and Dalianbang came in and out of two thousand, which was flattened.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Foreign Exchange is Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets remained unchanged, and the exchange rates were also the same as before. The trend in the Shanghai market was loose, but HSBC's listed prices, except for the German exchange rate plus half a yuan, which was 123 marks, were all unchanged. The internal market initially saw shortages, and later it was even more decadent. By the close, British gold was up 1875, US gold was up 375, and Japanese gold was down one and a half points compared to the previous day. The gold market had also broken through the 80 taels mark. It was indeed a large-scale sale by large households, especially influenced by the exchange market. Chinese merchants generally threw out about 300,000 pounds in British gold, including many set heads, and Japanese banks really had a lot of stomach. There were also telegrams from Bombay selling out, and very little US gold, but Japanese gold had settled tens of thousands of dollars. It seems that the various exchange rates still have a round of rotation.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds: "19 Good", Consolidated Tax Bonds Rise 6-7 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Shanghai bond market, spot transactions were scarce, and although the futures market was slightly more active, the overall market situation remained quite calm. This was because major buyers and sellers continued to be inactive. Regarding the trend of bond prices, although there were no new changes in the overall bond market environment and no large transactions by major players, retail purchases were relatively strong. As it was late in the month, short positions were also slightly covered, so the market showed some activity. However, the selling pressure was not as strong as before, resulting in a rebound in the prices of various bonds. However, the trend was moderate, with no significant fluctuations in prices between the morning and afternoon sessions. As a result, futures for "Consolidated 6% Customs," "Reorganization," "Disbandment," and "96" were sluggish with minimal price changes, while "19 Good," "Consolidated Tax," and "20 Customs" bonds rose by 6-7 jiao each. In addition, spot customs bonds rose by 2 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the beginning of the month. The total value of spot transactions was 5,000 yuan, and the value of futures transactions was 7.9 million yuan in the morning and approximately 5 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling nearly 12.9 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Markets Remain Lifeless</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning but fell in the afternoon, with the trend remaining weak. The global cotton industry is exceptionally pessimistic, and the decline in Three Grades Yarn is intensifying, with heavy downward pressure. Most speculators are inclined to sell. As for major players, they are buying near-term and selling far-term contracts. The demand for spot yarn from the Sichuan group is still relatively strong. However, market sentiment has not been shaken because of the unfavorable environment and the difficult-to-reverse overall situation. Overseas markets lack significant upward momentum, so when prices rise, more sellers emerge. However, the yarn market is different from the cotton market and may be a bit more resilient.</p>
<p>▲Man-Label Cotton: Morning Good, Afternoon Bad. The Man-Label market opened with a slight increase in American cotton, with a weak trend and stable sentiment. However, actual sales were good and the market atmosphere was tighter. Prices for all months rose by 4, 5, and 6 qian. In the afternoon, news of a sharp drop in Three Grades Yarn weakened market sentiment, and prices for all months fell by 7, 8, 9 qian to 1 liang and 1 qian. The total transaction volume was 27,800 bales. Sales exceeded purchases by 1,050 bales, with Gongtai selling 750 bales and Changfeng selling 1,050 bales. Purchases included Meiji buying 1,650 bales, Tianlong buying 400 bales, Yiyu buying 550 bales, and Lichang buying 550 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Man-Label Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |  | Man-Label Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| August 157.0 | Down 5 | 28,850 | | November 152.1 | Down 3 | 17,200 |</p>
<p>| September 153.3 | Up 2 | 71,450 | | December 152.7 | Up 2 | 101,900 |</p>
<p>| October 152.4 | Up 4 | 94,500 | | January 152.7 | Up 5 | 68,800 |</p>
<p>▲Yarn Sales: 3,300 Bales. Spot yarn sales remained strong. Total purchases by various groups throughout the day were 3,300 bales. Among them, fellow traders bought 450 bales of futures. Prices were stable. Among the out-of-town traders, Sichuan bought 2,850 bales, Qingdao bought 125 bales, Hankou bought 125 bales, Guangdong bought 180 bales, inland areas bought 100 bales, Tianjin bought 200 bales, Gaoyang bought 100 bales, and miscellaneous traders bought 30 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Lacks Strength</h3>
<p>The cotton market is particularly weak due to the relatively low prices of American and Indian cotton. Foreign firms are vigorously promoting sales in the market, but there is a significant lack of buyers. Manufacturers, aware of the surplus abroad, are apprehensive and adopting a wait-and-see attitude. As for American cotton, due to abundant production, its ability to rebound is weak, so major players continue to sell. According to Japanese sources, there are rumors of an additional 800,000 to 900,000 bales of American cotton production. If confirmed, there are concerns about drastic changes. Furthermore, a compradore from a certain foreign firm has disappeared due to poor business performance, leaving 50,000 bales of Indian cotton pledged at a certain bank. This cargo will likely be sold to Chinese factories at a reduced price.</p>
<p>▲Hankou-Label Cotton Drops 2-3 Qian. The Hankou-Label market opened with a slight increase in American cotton, with slightly stronger sentiment. Prices for all months rose by 5 fen to 1 qian. In the afternoon, the Japanese market was weak, major players sold, and the market fell sharply by 3.5 qian. The total transaction volume was 83,500 dan. Sales included Ruidai selling 16,800 dan, Yichang selling 2,100 dan, Yiyu selling 3,800 dan, Jifeng selling 2,100 dan, Xiesheng selling 2,100 dan, and Xincheng selling 2,000 dan. Purchases included Dafu buying 2,400 dan, Xinheng buying 1,400 dan, Tianjiang buying 2,400 dan, Rongxing buying 6,800 dan, and Taixing buying 3,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Hankou-Label Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |  | November 3350 | Down 20 | 279,100 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| August 3390 | Down 20 | 25,200 | | December 3350 | Down 35 | 255,700 |</p>
<p>| October 3350 | Down 25 | 164,900 | | January 3350 | Down 35 | 174,700 |</p>
<p>▲Spot Transactions Disappear Again. Spot cotton transactions have disappeared. Sources indicate 120 bales of Yao cotton were available.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Slightly Rebounds After Short Covering</h3>
<p>▲American Cotton Rebounds 10 Points. Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to selling pressure, but later strengthened due to short covering and support from Wall Street. Futures rose by 8 to 11 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 1 point, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton initially fell slightly following American cotton, but rebounded later due to short covering and better news from Liverpool. Pingguoer fell by 2.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 3.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated 20th):</p>
<p>| American Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | Equivalent Shanghai Standard |  | British Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | Equivalent Shanghai Standard |</p>

<h3>Grain: Heavy and Light Japonica Rice Fall by 3 Jiao</h3>
<p>▲Southern Market: Yesterday, the sources of supply from various groups remained constant, and port stocks were still heavy. City and rural store sales, in this autumn heat, had few customers, and buyers were selective, taking only fresh goods. Heavy japonica and light indica rice fell by 3 jiao. Early rice prices were slightly reduced due to weak sales. High-quality Lu Yang and pointed rice were very scarce and showed slight firmness. Stale rice sales were sluggish and fatigued. Shady rice was scarce and demand was stable, leading to price stability.</p>
<p>▲Xin Zha: Yesterday, the rice market remained sluggish. Sources of supply from the interior continued to flow in. Recent arrivals were particularly abundant from Suzhou and Changzhou. Market sentiment was poor, and stocks were abundant. As of yesterday afternoon, there were over one hundred rice boats on the Suzhou River, with an estimated total rice stock of around 25,000 shi. Sales at various stores were even weaker. Opening prices for all types of rice were weak in the morning, with only Lu Yang pointed rice showing some activity.</p>
<h3>Inquiries and Transactions for Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market showed a stable trend. Due to the small stock of foreign rice and a rebound in local demand, coupled with stagnant activity from out-of-town merchants and a lack of large-scale sales, the market showed no significant gains or losses. Yesterday, 1,100 bags of small ground rice were sold by local merchants at 13 yuan and 8 jiao per bag, and 120 bags of Saigon No. 1 were sold at 14 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen per bag. There were no other transactions. Although the prices of foreign rice in producing areas have fallen, they are still difficult to match Shanghai prices. Although foreign firms have been offering sales recently, there have been no buyers for high-priced offers, and low-priced telegrams have not been approved. Yesterday, Mitsui &amp; Co. sent out a telegram for 700 tons of small ground rice for shipment in September at 6 taels and 4 qian and 5 fen. In addition, Tongxingtai approved the immediate shipment of 500 tons at 6 taels and 5 qian and 5 fen. However, due to the requirement of advance payment, no one inquired about it.</p>
<h3>Flour Futures: Selling Pressure Intense</h3>
<p>▲All Months Plunge Approximately 3 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour futures market opened, rumors resurfaced about the US lending money to purchase wheat. Sellers aggressively sold off, long positions became anxious and surrendered, and prices immediately dropped across the board. Later, factories and out-of-town merchants also sold. Although foreign wheat was quoted at 2-3 jiao higher, short positions also covered, but the downward trend did not abate. In the afternoon, a client with close ties to political circles sold, and the selling pressure intensified further. Closing prices were down 3 fen for the current month, down 2 fen and 2.5 li for September, down 2.5 fen for October, down 2.75 fen for November, down 2.5 fen for December, and down 2.75 fen for January.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures and Spot Prices Show Slight Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw spot wheat factories adopting a wait-and-see approach. The local market offered over a thousand bags of wheat from Kunshan, Wuxi, Yangzhou, and Taicang, among others. The quality of the wheat was relatively high, but the selling price fell by 2-3 fen due to widespread rumors that the government's US loan was becoming a reality, leading to weak market sentiment. Wheat futures were also affected by this and declined after the market opened. Closing prices were down 4 fen for the current month and down 3 fen for September, October, November, and December. January was also down 4 fen.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, Yellow and White Filature Face Difficulties in European Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market remained difficult to improve. Overseas markets saw active sales by raw silk factories as European silk weaving mills resumed operations after the summer break, but Chinese silk prices remained low. Although silk telegrams were forwarded to Shanghai, Chinese merchants lacked sufficient silk, resulting in few transactions. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others imported 20 bales of Shanghai white filature, and Kaili imported 10 bales of yellow filature, both at firm prices.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Active in Law's Estate and Fine Eyebrow Tea Sales to France</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm tea market saw renewed demand for treasure eyebrow green tea from Law's Estate such as Mouyuan and Tunxi in the French market. Yongxing, Xiehe, Jinlong, Tongfu, and other firms showed strong interest. However, Chinese tea merchants, aware of the thin inventory, were unwilling to lower prices for sales, so transactions were not very strong. Needle eyebrow and show eyebrow teas continued to be popular. Qimen black tea was also resumed by the English firm Jardine Matheson, but their assessed prices were harsh, and market prices fell by another 5-6 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Jardine Matheson Opens with 10,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market telegrams from producing areas showed that the price of Cuban spot sugar continued to fall by 3.125 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures for September and December both fell by 3 points, March of the following year remained unchanged, and May also fell by 1 point. Java spot and futures sugar lacked price fluctuations. Transactions on the public market were quiet. The price of Dutch coarse sugar and white new goods remained at 11 taels, 6 qian, and 7.5 fen, while old goods were at 11 taels and 4 qian and 5 fen. 20-grade medium sugar white was at 11 taels and 1 qian, and inferior grades were at 11 taels. Demand was very limited. Jardine Matheson sugar saw a sudden easing of factory prices, and buying sentiment weakened further. B Mark prices fell to 11 taels and 1 qian, DY Mark to 11 taels and 9 qian, and AX Mark to 11 taels, 8 qian, and 2.5 fen. The market trend was stable. The company opened with 10,000 bags of DY Mark for September disposal at 4 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen per day; B Mark at 4 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen; and HM Mark at 4 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen. Merchants' interest was very weak, and the trend was flat. Jinfa offered several hundred bags of coarse sugar white at 11 taels and 6 qian per yuan, and Zhenxiang offered it at 11 taels and 5 qian and 5 fen, with few transactions. The market appeared flat and lifeless.</p>
<h3>Metals: English Galvanized Iron Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>English galvanized iron has recently become more active, resulting in a considerable volume of transactions.

Prices were 15 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen for 22-gauge, 15 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen for 24-gauge, 16 taels for 26-gauge, 16 taels and 5 qian for 28-gauge, and 17 taels for 31-gauge.</p>

<h3>Indian Poisonous Snakes</h3>
<p>— Fulan</p>
<p>Indian poisonous snakes have always been known throughout the world. Among them, the Russell's viper is found everywhere, whether in open fields, roadside jungles, or house corners. Its demeanor is indescribably frightening, but it is indeed a beautiful snake. Its color is a mix of dark brown and light brown, with rows of dark oval spots. Like other venomous snakes, it enjoys basking in the warm sun. Its temperament is lazy and fierce, and it is not afraid of people. Once it settles in a place, it will resist with all its might if you try to move it even a little. Its main food is rats. Generally, snakes destroy countless rats every year. In this respect, it seems that snakes are serving humans, because humans suffer great losses from rats. In short, no matter what kind of animal, no matter how venomous it is, it ultimately has some good to balance its sins. When people believe an animal is harmful to humans, they try every means to eradicate it; or when they believe an animal is beneficial to humans, they try to induce its breeding. As a result, they violate the principle of mutual restraint in nature, and ultimately harm themselves.</p>
<p>All reptiles are oviparous, but there are also several kinds, especially venomous snakes, tree snakes, and all sea snakes, whose eggs are incubated in the mother's body, so they are like viviparous animals. The Russell's viper is one of the most famous ovoviviparous snakes. A female viper kept in the museum of the Bombay Natural History Society successively gave birth to sixty-three small snakes, all wriggling and alive. Russell's vipers, when fully grown, are no more than five to six inches long. In addition, the saw-scaled viper rarely grows to more than one foot. However, this small creature harbors countless sins. Saw-scaled vipers are found all over India, especially in dry, sandy areas. Of those bitten by them, about 20% die. In several places, such as the cities of Bombay, the number of people who die from snake bites each year is indeed not small. This is mainly because snakes like to bask in open spaces.</p>
<p>Among Indian snakes, the saw-scaled viper is considered the most provocative, with a perverse temperament. The slightest movement near it will cause it to become aggressive, as if it wants to eat people. When kept in cages in museums, it will shake and chirp whenever people stand or walk past it, as if scolding them. These venomous snakes employ a very clever strategy when attacking, coiling their bodies into double loops, exposing only their heads. These loops are constantly moving and rubbing against each other, thus producing a rustling sound. On its flanks, it is covered with tin-like scales, with a serrated shape in the middle, hence its name, "saw-scaled viper." When its body moves, the protruding scales rub together, emitting a very audible angry sound, followed by constant chirping, rapid tongue flicking, and sudden head thrusts, making it look very frightening.</p>
<p>The color of the saw-scaled viper varies, usually completely harmonizing with its environment. Snakes in sandy areas often lie half-buried in the sand, their color indistinguishable from the sand, making it difficult to track them. There is also a brown tree snake, whose color and markings are very similar to the saw-scaled viper. The only way to distinguish them is to look at their heads. The head of the saw-scaled viper is surrounded by many small, human-shaped stripes, just like its body. As for the brown tree snake, its head is broad and flat, completely different from its back.</p>
<p>Some may ask whether there is a difference in the severity of poisoning when the above-mentioned venomous snakes bite people. No, every case depends on the amount of venom absorbed by the human body. Sometimes, when a snake strikes, no venom is injected, or the snake's venom has just been depleted, or the amount left is very small, insufficient to cause a reaction in the human body. In that case, even if a highly venomous snake bites a person, it will not have any effect. Conversely, even a completely non-venomous snake can sometimes bite a person to death. In India, there is plenty of evidence to prove that many people have been killed by completely non-venomous snakes. The biggest reason for this is fear. "Fear" kills faster than snake venom. Its vicious impact on the body is very rapid and can cause the body to feel the same effects as snake venom.</p>
<p>Originally, the primary function of snake venom is to overcome its prey. The secondary function is as a digestive juice and to eliminate toxins from itself or other snakes. However, we must know that such disinfection is not entirely complete, but rather like vaccination, where toxins are inoculated or transferred through injection. For example, the cobra can eliminate the venom of the Russell's viper, because no Russell's viper can kill a cobra. Conversely, someone once saw a large cobra kill an ordinary cobra. This is because the large cobra contained a lot of venom and its injection force was strong.</p>
<p>The toxic substance contained in snake venom cannot be dissolved in water or destroyed by sunlight. It is an extremely complex liquid that cannot be analyzed chemically. Once its venom enters the human body, it spreads very quickly, making rescue very difficult. Tying the limb above the wound to stop blood flow, or even implementing the ancient saying, "A brave man cuts off his wrist when bitten by a poisonous snake," may reduce or prevent the spread of poison to the whole body. However, when encountering a fatal dose of poison, these methods are of little use.</p>
<p>There are many remedies and spells for treating snake venom, and some people believe them to be very effective. In fact, being bitten by a venomous snake a few times is not necessarily fatal. In such cases, using a spell is just the spell having good luck. In science, a blood serum therapy has recently been invented that can be used as an antidote for the venom of certain snakes. From a medical point of view, this is the only way to treat snake venom. The production of this serum involves injecting a large amount of snake venom into the blood of a horse. The first injection is very small and has little effect on the horse. The last injection is almost ten times the amount originally sufficient to kill a horse, and as a result, the horse absorbs it without any harm. The serum made from the blood of this horse becomes a powerful antidote.</p>
<p>When Professor Calmette of the Pasteur Institute in Paris first created his medicine, he believed he had a cure for all venomous snake bites. However, it later proved not to be that easy, because each snake has a unique venom. The injection made with the venom of snake A can only be used for snake bites caused by snake A, not for snake bites caused by snake B or snake C. Only by collecting the venom of various snakes, preparing the serum separately, and applying them separately can treatment be successful. However, collecting this large amount of venom for injection into giant animals is indeed difficult, unless it is Russell's vipers and cobras, which are found everywhere in India. Recently, the Pasteur Institute in Kasauli has produced a serum made from a mixture of the venom of cobras and Russell's vipers, which has a good effect in treating any snake bite. However, if you encounter a snake bite, you should first tie the upper part of the wound before formally seeking treatment, just a towel is enough to use. This can prevent the venom from being immediately absorbed by the whole body. If the bite is on the hands or feet, the binding should be above the wrist or knee. At the same time, quickly call a doctor for help.</p>
