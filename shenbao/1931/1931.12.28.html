<p>時評</p>
<h3>這一年</h3>
<p>一年來的我國敎育</p>
<p>天寒歲暮。蕭蕭落葉。告訴我們又到了一年的盡頭。</p>
<p>雖說在茫無盡期的時光之波流中。一年只是如像駒遇决隙的一瞬。然而在繼往開來的人類歷史之篇幅中。一年來這人世的滄桑變幻也儘有作一次總的結束之必要。尤其是我們的國家。在這一年中。洪水的泛濫。强鄰的脅迫。飢寒交迫的哀號。以及時代英雄之角逐。爲悲壯。爲凄厲。爲滑稽。在歷史長期的序幕上。也儘有作一總的報告之價値。</p>
<p>在此。我們將於今後數日。將我國内一年來的内政外交分别作一總的報告。現在請從敎育說起。</p>
<p>我國以政治未上軌道。敎育亦迄不能進步。與歐美文明先進國相較。隔殊天淵。據今年敎育部發表統計。在數目字上的記錄。全國大學共三十四。私立</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>佔其。九專門學校共十八。法學佔其五。而工業僅佔其三。農業僅佔其二。中等學校共一·三三九。平均約三○○·○○○人始得有中等學校一所。中等學校學生人數共二三四·八一一。平均約每一·七○○人始得有一中學生。中等學校女學生共三七·六○四僅佔中學生全數百分之一六。就這些數目字而觀。我國敎育的衰落已是無可掩飾。一國的敎育。代表一團的文化。我國的敎育如此其衰落。人民都缺乏精神上的食糧。文盲佔全國人數百分之八十以上。國家那能不貧而且弱那能不致今日之情勢岌岌不可終朝呢。　　至於政府的敎育政策。與全國學生思想潮流的趨向。在此也有概予評述的必要。因爲由此我們以窺歷史的轉捩。更可以窺見社會推進的路向。　　民十六黨軍北伐全國人民盡爲喚起。特别是靑年學生實際從事於革命運動。奮門犧牲。確實曾留下不可磨滅的偉績。黨國底定。馬上得來的天下。斷不容馬上治之。所以政府在此時而求於敎育的是靜。是安寗。是忠孝禮義的聖敎之復活。所要求於學生靑年的是順從。是讀書救國。是各安其分。十九年十二月蔣主席於總攬萬幾之暇。復親長敎育。其重視敎育。已可槪見。是月行政院嚴令敎部。整飭學風令中有云。「此後政府施政方針。自當致全力於敎育之改善。本院長兼長行政。尤當竭其精神能力。以謀學風之整飭。嗣後各校學生。務當修養人格。努力學問。反對校長。即無異反對政府。當一意力學。涵養心身。凛古人思不出位之訓戒。奉總理三民主義爲依歸」蔣主席更以行政院長兼敎部長資格。發表誥誡全國學生書。誥誡書中有云「中正見聞所及。深覺於國家前途具有莫大危機。而引爲隠患者。莫過於各地學校學風之敗壞。與學潮之蜂起。若非立即嚴加糾正。將如洪水横流。爲害無所底止。」又說「往者旣已武力掃革命之魔障。今後當以文治宏訓政之規模。誓以改進</p>
<p>敎育。整飭學風。爲當務之急。所願全國靑年學生。重節操。尚實學。爲三民主義之忠實信徒。毌惑邪說。毌蹈歧途。敬師保。重學術。己立立人。自救救國。」從行政院的飭令。與蔣主席的告誡書裏。政府對於敎育之要求靜止。對於學生要求埋頭讀書。不是已經明白昭示全國嗎。</p>
<p>七月間行政院更令飭敎育部。通令直轄各機關及各學校。提倡道德。製匾縣掛。確定忠孝仁愛信義和平八字。爲訓民要則。并提倡中國固有道德。其在各省。更有湖南省政府咨請敎部改良課本。咨文中有說「民八以前。各學校國文課本猶有文理。近日課本每每狗說猪說鴨子說以及貓小姐狗大哥牛公公之詞。充溢行間。禽獸能作人言。尊稱加諸獸類。鄙俚怪誔。莫可言狀。」有吉林當局禁用語體文。認爲膚淺空疏。毫無是處。添講經書。并嚴厲禁止歌舞。認爲乃妓女行爲。狂態畢露。體面何存。當衆嬉戲。觀瞻不雅。這是吉林敎育當局禁止歌舞的理由有山東省政府建議重興孔廟。有中央委員戴季陶劉紀文主張興修顔廟子思廟及孔陵孟陵諸賢陵。并制定奉祀官條例。有導淮委員會副委員長莊崧甫向國民大會提出施行禮敎。以養民德。倡導與論。以達民情兩案。此一時期。敎育上的極端復古。和文化上的極端開倒車。更是極其明顯的事實。這便是黨政府敎育上復古運動的最高峯。</p>
<p>同時在此一時期。政府在敎育政策一面厲行復古。一面更表示决心確立敎育基金并保障其獨立。二月間。行政院明令財政部。切實執行敎育部所呈請的保障敎費獨立辦法。國民會議中三讀通過的約法。也明白規定「中央及地方應寬籌敎育上必需之經費。其依法獨立之經費。並予以保障。」而胡漢民氏對於整飭學風發表意見。更明白反對官僚政治侵入敎育界。這都是政府積極從事於整飭敎育的具體表現。</p>
<p>可是這一企圖終於失敗了。連綿不絶的學潮。和敎職員罷課索薪的風潮。終於將政府整飭敎育之企圖擊爲粉碎。綜計自去年以至今年。曾爆發學潮之學校。有廣州中大。上海光華。中公勞働南洋醫學院。安徽大學。東北大學。北平師大。民大。淸華。河南大學。河南省立一中南京中央軍校。濟南女師。山西一師。厦門雙十中學。以及吉林。蓬蓬勃勃。彼起此應。另一方面因敎費獨立在事實上不能兌現之故。全國各地罷課索薪的風潮。也蓬勃興起。有安徽敎育界呼籲償淸積欠。江蘇省校敎職員八屆代表大會。山西全省中小學。北平全市中小學等。各地各校之罷課索薪。至於因敎費無着。敎職員無法維持生活。不安心於所事。更是極其普通的現象。更加以軍隊對於靑年。每加殘殺如四川之横殺學生。即其一例。在此種情勢之下政府想整頓敎育。又豈可能。</p>
<p>所以政府整頓敎育的一企圖。終於在主觀的條件與客觀的環境兩種矛盾之下。沉痛的失敗了。</p>
<p>這裏政府又轉變一個方向。這方向便是以提倡職業敎育勞働敎育。并提倡奬學基金。派送黨員留學等。爲安定靑年心理的另一種政策。敎育部曾明令提倡職業敎育和勞働敎育。國民會議中曾有此同樣的决議。所謂奬學基金。各地學校設置很有幾處。這顯然是無辦法中的辦法。然而不幸偏是在此人心思亂的時候。更加以内災外患相逼而來。靑年學子内感於災民號呼的凄厲。外感於强鄰侵略的無厭。同時更是目擊政府鎭靜敷衍。舉棋莫定。於是自動奮起。自救救國。成立義勇軍。組設抗日會。奔走號呼。由　願以至示威各省都發生風潮都發生衝突。如南京。如上海。如山西。如廣東。如湖南。如杭州。行動一致。如火如茶。不可遏止。這裏已確切表示學生靑年由不安心讀書進而　接行動了同時更已確切表示政府要求敎育復古。而學生則已自起而推之前進了。政府要求者爲靜。而事實上則恰成爲動。爲騷擾。爲不安。此蓋有其必然性。絶非偶然。把握此一必然性。并把握敎育的根本意義。以確定如何領導靑年。敎育靑年。這是敎育家當前的責任。</p>
<p>一九三一年的我國敎育的成績和動向。便是這樣。我們希望一九三二年能有較好的成績。能有更正確的動向。</p>

<h3>上週棉市緊俏</h3>
<p>多方態度不某軟化</p>
<p>廠需依舊木然不動</p>
<p>棉市在週初頗軟、因國外棉市萎靡、美棉合價終在二十五兩至二十八兩之間、各廠均被塞飽外棉、本棉絶無需要、故到貨雖枯、然廠需停滯、且漢路到貨漸湧、入户一致看疲、但多　及漢帮因底盤甚小、做多心思殊濃、終不軟化、週末本月份爲　後一日、寗波帮收貨、交解姚花、標準市盤突漲五錢外、遠期亦被帶起、結果各月價比前週近月漲五錢、遠月漲一二錢、美棉漲二十磅云、兹錄漢標各月份最高低價列表比較如左、</p>

<h3>糖市粗砂白步趨步漲</h3>
<p>荷赤號盤開漲五分</p>
<p>昨糖市產區電訊　因値星期無到來、公會市塲劃盤交易仍寥、荷糖二十四號糖砂白、出户見缺、喊價奇高、初尚相持、旋以買方頗見活躍、初市成交價至九兩六錢半、賣方仍扳、後市升九兩七錢、市形略定、綿荷百十一兩三錢、二十號中砂白九兩六錢、八號荷赤八兩三錢半、九號貨升八兩六錢、市形均挺、太古糖交易較懈、Ｂ嘜十一兩七錢半至七分半、ＨＸ嘜十一兩五錢半、趨勢見穏、號盤華新號售出現貨ＰＮ嘜荷赤數百袋、價元八兩六錢、比前逐升五分、而市氣且强、大有步昂之勢云、</p>
<h3>五金薄白鐵走銷流利</h3>
<p>薄貨英白鐵、新近到貨十分湧旺、市上頗有貨滿之患、惟近幾日來、走銷極暢、如長江帮盡量收買、内地帮收胃亦暢、福州·龍口·天津等帮、亦多有問津、是以成交方面、在此萎靡不起之市塲中、堪云獨步、因此標準賴以維持而不跌、刻市七尺每張售一兩四錢、六尺一兩錢半、雖昨逢星期日、然然交仍有七八千張之多、綜觀最近人心之挺秀、恐標準前途尚無回跌之虞云、</p>

<h3>日軍决計攻錦</h3>

<p>事實上訴人聲明請爲廢棄原判、並駁斥被上訴人在第一審之訴及附帶上訴、令被上訴人負担兩審訟費之判决其陳述事實、略謂本案解除婚約、未見民法第九百七十二條之規定、自無解除理由、倘認爲解除婚約、係上訴人所提起、亦屬謬誤、查上訴人之要約、早經拒絶、固已失其拘東力、此爲民法第一百五十五條之規定、且解約之意、由友人周劍雲約上訴人前往談話、始知被上訴人竟已實行决裂解約、實出諸被上訴人、已可槪見、原審不察事實、不問法律、遽令解約、焉能令人甘服、胡蝶公司係被上訴人之父所開設、依法應以被上訴人之父爲主體、被上訴人之父尚生存、繼承尚未開始、被上訴人焉能代父行使權利况其所訴債務、如付汽車價三百八十兩、哈同房租一百三十八元二角、榮康祥洋五十元、早已償還被上訴人、將帳簿湮滅、致無從稽核、明星公司支票六百元、係被上訴人託上訴人向銀行取欵、當即交付被上訴人收受、當時以彼此係屬未婚夫婦、未立收據、原審乃以此絲毫未能證明債務關係之支票、而認爲債務之發生、偏頗之意、灼然可見、至上訴人所請求之損害洋一千元、查上訴人並未受有損失、其附帶上訴亦毫無理由云云、被上訴人聲明請爲駁斥上訴、並判給附帶上訴人慰藉金洋一千元、令上訴人負担兩審訟費、其陳述事實、略謂查兩造婚約係由上訴人先行委託律師兩次函求解除、且於函中及在報紙上誣指被上訴人行爲不檢、聲譽不好、且其書面表示、業已恩斷義絶、實已構成民法第九百七十六條第九項重大事故之條件、原判准予解約、至爲允當、胡蝶公司之財產係被上訴人與父所共有、被上訴人之父胡少貢曾經到庭供明、有原審筆錄、可資考證、上訴人所云、全係虛構事實、誤解法理、關於代付汽車價銀三百八十兩、哈同房租一百三十八元二角、及榮康祥西服洋五十元、均有支票存根可據、上訴人又因做金子交易、缺少保證金、商懇被上訴人向上海明星公司借給支票洋六百元、由其自去支欵後轉向上海銀行立摺存欵、事實具在上訴人明知被上訴人之公司因遭回祿、所有帳册貨物、俱經焚燬、乃故意要求提出帳簿、察其用意、無非藉此圖　、應請將其上訴駁斥、至兩造解除婚約之原因旣如上所述應歸責於被上訴人之一方、則被上訴人依照民法第九百七十八條及九百七十九條之規定、請求賠償慰藉金一千元亦不爲多云云、</p>
<p>理由　本件理由可分三部份言之、兹爲分别說明如下、（一）關於婚約部分、查解除婚約、先由上訴人要求、有上訴人委託鄂森律師專致上訴人之信函爲證、該函並載有恩斷義絶、令人萬難容忍、請迅爲依法進行解除婚約等語、上訴人對於該函所載各節、亦並不爭執、惟上訴人主張忽謂解約之說、曾向周劍雲表示在先、忽謂上訴人之要約、被上訴人早經拒絶、已失其拘束力云、其主張固已前後抵觸、且據周劍雲在原審供詞、被上訴人當初並無解約之表示、而被上訴人有無拒絶上訴人之要約、亦絶無相當證明、則解除婚約、旣經上訴人要求在前、被上訴人因而訴請解約、原審判令解除、自無違誤、（二）關於債務部分、查胡蝶公司爲上訴人代付汽車價銀三百八十兩、哈同房租洋一百三十八元二角、榮康祥五十元、上訴人承認無異、又明星公司支票洋六百元、上訴人亦承認由伊支取、惟上訴人據爲抗辯者、以胡蝶公司係上訴人之父胡少貢開設、被上訴人未得胡少貢之授權、不能訴追、且代付汽車房租及榮康祥銀洋、均已償還、而明星公司支票一欵、於支取後即交付被上訴人等語、本院查胡蝶公司係被上訴人與其父胡少貢共同開設、業經胡少貢在　審供述明晰、並謂起訴係共同商最過的、是胡蝶公司之債權、即爲被上訴人與其父共有之債權、被上訴人出而訴追、於法並無不合、至代付各欵、上訴人謂業已償還、則無證明方法、縱謂被上訴人未能提出帳簿爲證、以攻擊上訴人之隠匿帳簿、然胡蝶公司曾經失火、經上訴人代理律師提出安平水火保險公司之信函、已足證明被上訴人謂帳簿燬於失火、自非無</p>
<p>據、詎得謂爲隠匿、（三）又其中明星公司支票洋六百元、據被上訴人謂上訴人曾凑足五百兩、存入上海商業儲蓄銀行虹口分行等語、雖經本院函致該行查復、未能徴實、然該支票旣經上訴人前往支取、並於支票上蓋有雪懷之圖章、則上訴人於支取該欵後、苟無其他證據足以證明其已經交付於被上訴人、即不能免除償還之責、至上訴人曾否將該欵存入上海銀行、要亦無甚關係、原審就上述各欵、責令上訴人償還、亦無不當、上訴各節、不能謂爲有理由、據上論斷、本件上訴及附帶上訴、均無理由、依民事訴訟條例第五百十七條第一百零三條、爲判决如主文、</p>

<h3>讀馬占山主席來電</h3>
<p>前些日子馬占山主席來了一個電報勸靑年自動援馬抗日團不要到黑龍江去，電文裏有這樣的幾句話：『……婢織奴耕，各有專職：保國禦侮，責在軍人…』我讀到這幾句話，心裏起了兩種感想：一是不忍批評：一是不得不批評。爲什麽不忍批評呢？馬主席在冰天雪地中，孤軍抗日，在萬死中爲國家爭國格，一片丹心，人所共仰，即使說錯了一兩句話做國民的也當原諒，我何忍吹毛求疵？爲什麽不得不批評呢？馬主席現在是全國一致推崇之人物，國人對於他的一言一行，幾乎只有信仰，没有懷疑。倘使國人因推崇馬主席功榮之故，對於這些話也看做金科玉律，豈不是大家一起都要做成古代人？我始於不忍批評而終於不得不批不評的正是因爲這個緣故。</p>
<p>婢織奴耕的時代是早已過去了。現在織布的是工人，不是婢妾。現在耕田的是農人，不是奴隷。工人和農人之上再也不該有那「四體不勤，五榖不分」的士大夫了。中山先生所說的阿斗不是孫科而是我們的工人和農人。工人農人是中華民國的主人翁。我們該承認他們是主人：若再以奴婢看待人人，說得輕些是思想錯誤，說得重些，則歷來武人一切背叛民國之行爲都發源於這一念之差。　　顧亭林說：『天下興亡，匹夫有責。』近代國民有當兵的義務即負了共同保國禦侮之重責。軍人的責任不在單身匹馬的守士而在鍜鍊國民使有共同衛國之實力。馬主席倘能實現這個主張，則不但黑龍江一省可保、將見四方聞風興起，中華民國便成了鋼鑄的江山，誰也打不進來了。</p>
<p>有人說，這個電報也許是秘書起了草就拍，未經馬主席看過。我說，即使是馬主席親筆寫的，也是君子之過，如同日月之蝕，無傷於他的光明。</p>
<h3>吳長慶之遠慮</h3>
<p>— 靑松居士</p>
<p>日本以東方島夷。藐視我國。鐵騎横行。蹂躪東北。尚論者雖謂不抵抗主議。致貽滔天之禍。而不知禍之作。不作于作之日。必有所由兆。以故推原禍始。殆肇于淸代甲午一役。然而當甲午十年前。淸代宿將中。未嘗無人揭破其陰謀。而欲以未雨綢繆。雖余涉世也晚。然得諸父老傳聞。則當時有吳公者。抱絶大之遠識。而有對日之雄心。雖賚志以殁。未竟厥功。然其以後事叮嚀。言當時所不敢言。而爲後人津津樂道。因乃效許子之不憚煩而爲究心國事者資一談助焉。</p>
<p>吳公名長慶武謚壯。安徽廬江人也。幼有大志。究心韜略。淸同治初元。李鴻章氏治兵于蘇滬。公其麾下。雖東征西擊。累保至總兵。而公以内戰頻仍。傷我族類非其所願。特迫于積威之下。口不言而良用疚心耳。嗣於淸光緒八年。公官廣東水師提督。適朝鮮亂黨。圍攻日使館。波及王宮。日人大譁。以爲有機可乘。李鴻章乃檄公馳援。公聞訊。投袂而起。以爲立功異域振我國威。在此時機。率師五千人。由海道疾駛。比日兵到韓城。公已先至二日。嚴行戒備矣。日兵驚以爲神。相顧駭愕。公乃偵知亂黨所。禽斬數十人而事息。而日人憤技必欲造言生事。倭提督花房。以兵繞韓王宮。覘吳軍勤靜。偵騎大出。訛言四起。意欲與我軍姚釁。而狡焉思逞。公已洞察其詭謀。部勒肅整。劍㦸森嚴。懍乎不可犯。日人氣懾。竟不敢校。且相戒曰。勿謂彼無人。愼毌生事也。踰月而朝鮮大定。奏留五營保護。韓人德之爲生祠以尸祝。翌歲爲光緒十年。因病回京。自知不起。屢言于李氏云。『朝鮮政敝民困。兵單地要。日本鬼蜮多端。萬分兇惡。其於朝鮮。耽耽虎視。是宜練兵保衛。防患東倭。庶幾莫余敢侮。而永懷藩屬。否則倭將肆行無忌。必有吞併之禍。而我國之藩籬撤。』遠大之言。目光如炬。異日之倭人。封豕長蛇。荐食上國。公無不燭照而數計也。若使天假之年。即有甲午一役。而得公以赴援。當不使喪師失地。納欵議和。而更不至有今日之日逼處此。辱國若斯。詩曰。人之云亡。心之憂矣。予是以憤東倭不道。憶及父老傳聞。而低徊于吳公遠慮。爲不可及矣。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>曾幹二十餘種職業的靑年英國惠得奈Ｗitney地方。有一位三十二歲的靑年。名甘爾。Ｊ.Ｇill他生平幹過二十餘種職業。全世界的靑年不知有多少。</p>
<p>怕誰也比不上他吧。他曾做過賣報童子。屠夫的副手。理髮匠的副手。雜貨商的副手。送電報人。漁船上的水手。木雕匠。電匠。馬達工程師。汽車夫。磚匠。粗木匠。小車夫。僕役。酒排間侍者。園丁。無線電推銷員。開電梯人。漆匠。郵差。樵子。機器工頭。他又開過水電廠。汽車行。并曾坐了簡單的機脚車。周游世界一次。但看他以三十二歲的年齡。幹了這許多種種不同的職業。雖說没有恒心。但他身體的健康。精神的活潑。與進取心的充足。於此可見。加以仗着一輛機脚車周游世界。更是難能可貴的事。</p>
<h3>改賀年片爲警年片</h3>
<p>— 君碩</p>
<p>國難未已。國憂未歇。熱心之士。恐各界沿用年頭賀片舊例。致忽忘目前之憂患。棄國家奇恥大辱於不顧也。於是相與主張停止賀年。其說亦旣一再披露於報端。爲閱者所共見矣。昨者吾鄉反日救國會開會時。有提議比停止賀年事。更作進一步之警告者。謂僅停止不賀。尚嫌淡漠。蓋尋常本多不發賀年片。但云停賀。無以爲震動警惕之表示。不若改賀年片爲警年片。因二十一年之年頭。旣無新禧之可賀。又多患禍之當警。故同是郵寄一片於新年。而其措詞應大異於前。此議當時一致通過。遂擬定片中之揩語云。二十一年已屆矣。不堪回首。來日大難。無嬉游。無宴樂。無以新歲而自逸。國將不國。願共策勵。日新與新。以今日之警。留爲他年之賀。某某垂涕鞠躬。余聞在會友人之述如是。深爲贊同。謂果能常此憂勤惕勵。且以感化各界。我國前途。庶有豸乎。昔楚莊王日討國人而訓之。遂覇中原。吳王夫差以父闔閭因戰越而喪也。日使人立於庭。每出入。必呼之曰。夫差。爾忘越王之殺而父乎。則對曰。唯。不敢忘。三年乃報越。是故有救國雪恥之志者。其策勵蓋無日無時而可間斷也。改賀年爲警年。用意深哉。</p>
<h3>偶筆四則</h3>
<p>— 石天籟</p>
<p>「上海」兩字的由來上海初似爲一漁村。爲往來停泊之所。後來之蔚成巨埠。實基於此。今所定名。意即海上也。其時尚有一下海。或係本有兩海港故有上下之分。其地居海之上者。則名曰上海也。</p>
<p>「極司非而路」的緣起。考極司非而之得名。據聞當年有葡萄牙人某君者。偶行經虹口馬戲塲側。聞帳中有女。哭聲甚哀。乃爲之贖身。送交某美敎士撫養。女後是某君之助。赴美留學。歸國後。遂歸某君。以女名極司。乃戲呼其所居之地爲極司非而。意即極司之地也。後人隨呼其地爲極司非而路。</p>
<p>「外漢公園」的由來　是地爲黃浦江與蘇州河合流處。淤泥所成。昔嘗有船沉于是。故積淤乃愈甚。其地原爲英領署所有。繼乃取得英政府同意。移歸工部局。開闢公園。於是斥資塡士。所費鉅萬。而</p>
<p>今日美麗之公園。始湧現於一片荒灘之上。</p>
<p>「抛球塲」名稱　今無可考。但知其在南京路與河南路轉角某處。（昔南京路四十九號）有中國式房屋一所。屋側小門。即爲通抛球塲云。今雖房屋業經翻造。而當地人士。尚稱是地爲抛球塲云。</p>
<h3>國難聲中返鄉紀趣</h3>
<p>— 高亞魂</p>
<p>外侮日亟。國將不國。胸𥃤問充塞亡國慘象。更何暇憶念故鄉。日前因公如杭。與友聯攝影隊主任陳君接洽諸事畢尚有半日餘閒本可飽覽湖山。因興少逸致。從友人之勸。遄返故鄉。雖信宿往還。而途中見聞趣事甚多。記之。亦破涕爲笑之意也。</p>
<p>一江兩渡　余家在紹興。本渡錢塘江直達西興岸此次渡江至彼岸時。須再涉一衣帶水。余不禁稱異。詢之興夫。始知半江中一帶漲沙遇潮汛淺小時。凸出水面。須一江兩渡矣。然而一輩苦力。藉此而大敲竹槓。</p>
<p>人力汽車　紹興公路局之長途汽車。佳而速者雖有。然破舊不堪而充數者亦不少。余所乘之車開駛時。須用數十小工。力挽而行半里之遥。始得順道直駛。到站停後。又須人力推挽。余無以名之。故謂之人力汽車。</p>
<p>日本不來　余到家後。隣翁王君。來詢余時局。余告以暴日掠我土地。國家將亡等情。聞者均爲髮指。惟王翁似作不信狀曰。恐難馮信。因俗語有云。打也來。駡也來。蝕本總不來。日本敢來麽。悞蝕爲日。一何可笑。</p>
<p>募捐叩頭　余在家越宿返杭。在江干見有學生募捐隊數十人。遇一鄉老。不破鏗囊。學生竟環繞此鄉老作揖叩頭。鄉老被迫無法。在囊中探取多時。出雙毫一枚。擲地飛奔而逸。旁觀者均閧然大笑。</p>
<p>應兎聯和　余到杭後。友聯攝影隊陳君。因「荒江女俠」外景已將攝竣。有一鷹。一兎。囑余先携之返申。鷹兎裝置一筐。本欲使其聯和。但鷹見兎。欲膏　吻。兎受驚。狂跳不已。乃分置兩處。迨登車矣。余置鷹於車擱板上。置兎於座椅下。始各安然。</p>
<p>飽嘗鷹矢　有一乘客。見人稀而仰臥車椅上。不知睡不逾時。車擱板上筐中之白鷹矢。忽由板縫中直滴而下。正滴在此睡客之臉上。客起而與余交涉。余再三道歉始罷。</p>
<p>短訊　何香凝女士主辦救濟國難書畫展覧會。定二十八日開幕。精選六十餘名書畫家之作品七百餘件。屆時邀請各書畫家合作。即席揮毫。并聞永安堂主人胡文虎氏。將以飛機兩架捐入該會。專作救護之用云。</p>
<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 誅菴</p>
<p>四合房</p>
<p>海寗王敎授國維曾撰明堂廟寢通考一書。據甲骨文字證明古建築通制爲四宮相對而中函一庭。中庭即中霎。禮所謂家主中　而國主社稷。正謂其當一家之中央爲集會之地。若如舊說以中霎爲穴居漏雨之地。殊違理智。扞格難通。此說旣立。則明堂廟寢一切古今經學大師聚訟不决之禮制。皆得疏通證明。游刄有餘。王氏爲近代國學祭酒。信道好學。粹然儒者。而又精曉歐文。博通藝事。能以西方科學論證方法整理國故。每樹一義。必犁然有當於人心。不獨故步自封之老輩望塵莫及。即並時治學之士。持論間有不同。而以言造詣之深。無不歛手推服。王氏以十六年夏日感憤時事自沈於頥和園之昆明湖。全國學術界遂失山斗。顧其遺書益爲世所重矣。　前氓一說。爲王氏闡明經學最精之作。以之印證北都所沿之建築通式。殆彌不可拔也。北都中等家庭多爲四合房式。謂上房三楹或五楹。東西廂房各三楹。而對上房之客廳。北人謂之倒坐者。又三楹或五楹也。此正與王氏四宮相對之說若合符契。北俗多沿古昔。今山陜皆尚存穴居之風。則古宮室制之存於北都。極無可疑。又宮殿亦大體襲古制。都下居民本有定式。特宮殿之具體而微者耳。徑直言之。則北方建築足以代表古代建築也。</p>
<p>大抵居宅之大門不能正對中堂。必偏闢其右。惟公署王邸乃備朱門瑣窗。前施行馬。王府則兼列棨戟。重闥洞啟。可以直抵内寢。自餘民宅。皆啟右門也。入門有塾。（門旁小屋）俗稱門房。爲厮役所居。與門房相連者。即上所稱之倒座。賓至則入之。旁或有小院。可以爲庖廚涵溷厠。倒座與正屋必隔以短垣。而樹以屏門。俗稱垂花門。以其短楹刻鏤爲倒垂菡蓞之狀也。入垂花門。爲正屋之庭院。即上所稱之上房及廂房所在矣。通例上房爲臥起所在。廂房則以爲書齋賓館。或以居子姓庋雜物。上房之後。或更闢一小院。爲後照房。其旁或更闢别院。則或以處僕媪。非中等以上不辦矣。要而言之。都下之屋多爲上述之四合式。縱使千變萬化。亦僅以廻廊複室見奇。大體不出此也。等而下之。則有三合式。謂無倒座也。若貧户所居。則爲雜院羣房。不能備此格矣。</p>

<h3>一九三一年諾貝爾化學奬金得主　王逢壬</h3>
<p>據柏林通信云、自從一九○一年阿飛里特諾貝爾氏Ａlfreb　Nobel首倡此項奬金以來、每次瑞典科學社選舉的得主、向來偏重於一般理論的科學家、但是到了今年、這慣例已改途易轍了、因爲今年的得主、是分享給二位德國著名的科學家、一名弗萊特里許柏鳩斯博士Ｄr　Friedrich　Aergins一名卡爾巴斯去博士Ｄr.Karl　Basch、他們倆不但是在理論的科學研究工作上、曾獲得世界的榮譽、就是在他們所發展和完成他們自已的方法上、也已經有實際的功效了、所以他們在這著名的科學界裏、大家都已認爲這是歷史上一件珍奇的事呢、</p>
<p>（一）柏鳩斯博士</p>
<p>他曾經在柏林愛特隆旅社Ａdlon　Hotel裏、被某新聞社代表會面過、知道他是一個愉快的壯夫、穿着漂亮的衣服、今年剛到四十七歲、他對於這次榮獲此項的奬金、表示出一種感佩和愉快的心裏、各地的賀物、好像雪片的飛來、致使他所居留的一套房間、變成了一爿花店的景象、</p>
<p>關於他化學上的研究、他說是限於煤和木兩種、在他最初從事研究的時候、他在哈柏敎授指導下、學習化學、丨丨哈氏是從前諾貝爾奬金的得主丨丨哈氏就引他特别注意看注二大自然的產物、後來在一九○一年、他就開始研究把這些原料想一個最完善而經濟的辦法來利用、嗣後他經過一翻的苦心、並且有時犧牲了極大的費用、去試騐、在這個時候、他又碰過幾次的失望和挫折、最後才獲得成功、達到了他的目的丨丨從煤中取油、　　後來到他宣佈他實際的發明時、他的聲名、隨此大震、這發明最重要的一點、就是本來在原煤裏、炭和氣的關係是一和十六之比、而在煤油裏、牠們的關係是一和八之比、換句話說、就是在液體的燃料（油）裏、含有二倍輕氣的成分、所以牠的效能、比原煤大一部、因此在今日全世界的各種實業裏、均需利用牠、尤其是在各種駕使的引擎裏、實爲須臾不可或離的要件、但是吾們回顧世界上煤油的洪給、是總有盡源的、那末不是要造成煤油的恐慌嗎、可是在另一方面、如德英中日諸國、對於煤的產量、可算滿坑滿谷、惟獨對於煤油的產量、倒稱絶無僅有、因此他們今後就可利用柏鳩斯博士的方法、從大量的煤產裏、提鍊煤油、供給自己國内的消費、而造成油產的獨立國家、那末這煤油的恐慌、至少須再延長至幾千萬年哩、</p>
<p>但是柏氏不祇限於研究煤中取油的方法、他對於木材中、認爲還有别種的原質、頗有研究的價値、因此後來又經過了他一翻勞碌的研究後、他又發明一種方法、利用了這個方法、木材中就可產出炭水化物來、現在據個例吧、好像在任何植物的纖維素裏、如果用鹽酸在某種的情形下、經過强烈的分解後、這結果便成爲糖、柏氏發明此種的方法、對於工業上實爲莫大的貢獻呢、</p>
<p>現在從木材中、可以化成别種有價値的物質來、譬如一塊木材、用了柏氏的方法後、三分之二可以化成炭水化物、這些如果同水分溶解、就可當作動物的食料、若再加以改造、也可充人類的食料、餘下的三分之一、就變成各種不同的副產物、像醋酸和褐煤等東西、而這種褐煤仍可像平常的木材、再製成木炭、</p>
<p>柏氏發明此法、能使木材善於利用、獲利更厚、因此世界各國、遲早定會效行、這是一件意中事吧了、就拿德國作證、近來每年進口的畜料、不亞三百萬噸、頗思塞此漏巵、苦無相當辦法、最近柏氏發明此法後、不久當可見諸實行了、至於其他富於森林之國家、不久當然也可以木材改製酒精等物、而爲有效的使用、</p>
<p>（二）卡爾巴斯去博士</p>
<p>他是一位著名電氣工程師卡爾巴斯去的姪兒、今年五十七歲、他現在除了擔任德國化學托拉斯的總經理外、還被舉爲諾貝爾（即奬金之發起人）公司的董事、所以他不但是一位著名的科學和化學工程師、並且是居德國實業界頭等領袖之一呢、</p>
<p>他的稱名世界、遠在哈柏Ｈaber敎授獲得諾貝爾奬金的時候、因爲那時哈柏敎授的最初由空氣中抽氣的發明、不由他的輔助、不由他建造一部必需的機器、來完成其最後之步驟、哈柏敎授或許就不會成功哩、原來博士對於化學上曾由此創出一特殊的藝語、就是在華氏表七百五十度時、在氣壓二○○度之下、也能製造輕氣了、博士努力的有形結果、是在侖那Ｌeuns和奥渡Ｏppan地方的德國化學托拉斯、製造有幾部極大的機器、由此可製不少的肥料、不但可使國内完全不必再由智利進貨、並且還能超出國内需要之外呢、</p>
<p>德國在歐戰時、因爲加工製造炸藥和肥料的緣故、對於氣的需要、頓失了常態的供給、這時如没有哈柏　巴斯去、Ｂaber.Bosch的方法、那末國内勢必缺此兩種物品、而這都戰事、或則不會維持到一九一八年十一月之久哩、</p>
<p>按自一九○一年諾貝爾奬金初發時始、迄於今歲、化學奬金曾先後發給二十七次、德人得十五次爲最多、次爲英國得五次、再次爲法國及瑞典得三次、又次爲瑞士美國捷克等國各得一次云、</p>

<h3>洗臉的問題</h3>
<p>— 冰</p>
<p>今天下午上國文課時、莫明其妙地、訓育處接二連三不斷的來呌男同學、女同學、這引起全課堂的注意、同驚疑、人人感着不安、空氣亦緊張起來、連先生都感到奇異、所以放下課本、很嚴肅的問問學們丨丨　　「你們這課堂出了什麽事情、訓育處這樣接二連三來呌你們、」</p>
<p>大家同聲說、「不知道、」</p>
<p>「不知道」、你們自己課堂的事會不知道的、没有什麽事情發生、訓育處會來呌你們麽、别人或者不知道、呌去的人總知道吧、</p>
<p>但大家都默默無言、被呌到訓育處去過的同學也說、「没有什麽事、」</p>
<p>「哼、」先生没有辦法、祇好說、「下次你們自己留意點、要守規則、守紀律、不要再被訓育處在上課時來呌你們、尤其是上我的課、下次再來呌、我是不許你們出去的、但查出有犯規的、亦是要受嚴厲的處分、」</p>
<p>在這樣含有神秘性的緊張空氣之中、不知不覺一點鐘過去了、一打下課鐘、課堂就擾亂起來、大家都問到訓育處去的同學、爲什麽事吃大菜、</p>
<p>我這時聽見「吃大菜」三字、不懂是什麽意義、就問傍邊一位同學什麽呌「吃大菜、」</p>
<p>他說、「你連吃大菜都不懂嗎、」</p>
<p>我說、「不懂、」</p>
<p>他說、「吃大菜就是到訓育處去啊」</p>
<p>哦、我這才恍然大悟、同時被好奇心所驅使也、急急想知道他們爲什麽吃大菜、所以亦加入他們的團體、去打聽這是什麽一回事、</p>
<p>呌的結果還是使我不很明白、但知大槪是爲男女同學的事、（昨天下午發生的）這更引起子我的趣味、我一定要去打聽明白、</p>
<p>我就跑到宿舍裏去找娟、因爲她亦是一份子、一定很淸楚這回事、</p>
<p>娟氣憤憤的站在窗前、我拉住她、要她告訴我這回事、</p>
<p>她說、「你難道不知道麽、要來問我、」</p>
<p>我說、「不知道呀、因爲昨天下午找請假、没有來上課所以一點亦不知道、」</p>
<p>她說、「哦、是的、昨天下午你不在課堂、啊、冰、昨天我們氣死了、馨氣得在課堂裏哭、」</p>
<p>愛國女學訓育主任黃汕</p>
<p>我愕然問、爲什麽事要哭、在課堂裏哭、我想男同學一定要笑我們的、女子只會哭、有什麽事同他辦交涉就是、何必要在課堂裏哭呢、」</p>
<p>娟說、「這次的事、太使她難堪了、難怪她要氣得哭、我都氣的要死、男同學侮蔑我們女同學的尊嚴人格、而且不祗這次、以前亦常常受他們的欺侮、你總知道的、這次起先雖是馨不好、但他們亦太欺侮我們了、不給他們一次警戒、下次更要被他們輕視了、」</p>
<p>事情起因是這樣的丨丨昨天下午下了第二課倫理時、我同馨英幾個人在說笑、剛剛一位外路同學走過馨身邊、碰了馨一下、她一見這位同學的面孔、就笑着同我說、「這人多懶、恐怕今天臉多没有洗的」、</p>
<p>「那知就被他聽見了、『是呀、我今天腰都不曾洗、我又不要人家來愛我、不象你們女同學漂亮、一天洗幾十次臉、塗幾百次白粉、胭脂、多漂亮……』還有種種不堪入耳的說話、我聽不過去、才說、『你說話留神點、不要瞎說八道、任意侮蔑人、馨氣得一句話亦說不出、旁的同學（平時馨不很理他們的）、又趁此機會來報仇、幾面夾攻、我只好呌馨不要去理他們、就拉她出課堂、她氣的說、不願再在此讀了、受這種野蠻同學的氣、」</p>
<p>上第三課文字學時、我先進課堂、馨後進來、她一進課堂、男同學口裏就吹出一種怪聲、並在黑板上她書桌上寫着侮蔑她人格的話、於是她氣得哭了、我們亦代她氣不過、他們這種行爲、不僅是侮蔑他一人、可說是連我們大家都侮蔑了、所以我們再不同他們客氣、就大家跑到訓育處去問訓育先生、『我們是來求學的呢、還是來給男同學開玩笑欺侮的、』並呌他自己到課堂去看黑板上同卓上的字、是不是女同學是應當給男同學開玩笑的、丨丨』</p>
<p>「訓育處見了這種課堂擾亂的形狀、亦很氣、說說要調查一下、查出是那幾個人幹的、一定要重里處罰、今天來呌去的同學、有的是有嫌疑、有的是呌去問問、」</p>
<p>這次吃大菜的結果、有幾位男同學記了一個大過、女同學被敎訓了幾句、說在課堂裏不要同男學多說話、不要去笑他們、這次的事你們亦有不是處的、」　　聽了娟的話我才明白這次風波的細底、但是我却想不到這事件的導火線原來祗是一個洗腰的問題、</p>

<h3>Japanese Artillery Continues Fierce Attacks on Dawagou Station</h3>
<p>Repelled by Our Armored Train</p>
<p>Goubangzi Situation is Critical</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bombing Everywhere</p>
<p>Military Strength Concentrated at Tianzhuangtai</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Goubangzi, at 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 26th, a company of Japanese soldiers, under the cover of an artillery company, attacked Dawagou Station, firing more than seventy shells. More than ten shells landed near the railway, causing slight damage to the tracks. At 8:30 AM on the 27th, a Japanese direct-firing artillery company, under the cover of an infantry company, and guided by a plane, attacked Dawagou Station. Our armored train immediately engaged in battle, then feigned retreat from the station. The Japanese soldiers rushed to occupy the station. Our armored train charged towards the station, and the Japanese soldiers retreated in disarray. At 9:30 AM, the Japanese soldiers counterattacked, and the plane dropped six bombs from low altitude. One bomb landed near our locomotive, but reportedly caused no damage. Subsequently, more than 500 local militia arrived to assist. The Japanese soldiers suffered more than a hundred casualties and retreated in defeat at noon. Our positions remained at Dawagou. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Jinzhou reports that the Japanese army in Yingkou continues to send aircraft to Dawagou, Panshan, and other places to drop heavy bombs. The Tianzhuangtai area is also being bombarded with artillery near Dawagou. The situation in Goubangzi is critical. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese news agency announced last night that Zhang Xueliang appointed</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong as the Commander-in-Chief of Aid to Jinzhou, but officials have denied it. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Jinzhou reports that railway personnel at Dawagou Station on the Yingkou line have left their posts due to Japanese bombing and are working inside armored trains. On the 26th, the Japanese army built trenches and laid landmines north of Tianzhuangtai Station. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military has recently dispatched a large number of student-like personnel in batches to Pingjin, Yuguan, Jinzhou, Tanggu, Tangshan, and other areas for secret work. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shanhaiguan reports that the Japanese army in Shenyang is actively preparing to advance westward. Japanese troops and a large amount of military supplies are being transported from the north shore of Yingkou to the south shore and concentrated at Tianzhuangtai. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinzhou Chinese authorities report that several Japanese aircraft appeared over Goubangzi and Yixian this morning, but did not drop bombs, presumably conducting reconnaissance. Another Japanese aircraft dropped two bombs in Zhangwu. Dawagou still has Chinese troops and armored trains stationed. Jinzhou remains very quiet. Military attachés from various countries who came here from Beiping are still here as observers. If there are no unexpected developments in the next few days, they plan to return to Beiping next Tuesday. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news this morning, a conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops in the Yingkou branch of the Beining Railway is imminent. It is said that 8,000 Chinese soldiers, including irregular forces, are advancing southward from Panshan, west of Tianzhuangtai, and have already passed Ganlongtai (transliteration) between Panshan and Yingkou. According to Shenyang news, these Chinese soldiers are cooperating with 6,500 irregular troops occupying Niuzhuang, seemingly intending to recapture Tianzhuangtai. Tianzhuangtai is on the Goubangzi-Yingkou line and was occupied by the Japanese army on the 25th of this month, at which time the Chinese garrison retreated to Panshan. It is reported that the Japanese army, in view of the serious situation that has developed, is now concentrating at Tianzhuangtai. The Second Division of the Japanese Army, under Domon, will move its headquarters there tomorrow to clear the route to Goubangzi. At the same time, it is reported that 4,000 to 5,000 bandits in the territory of Tai'an and Liaozhong have begun to move towards Liu'erbao, apparently intending to disrupt the Japanese army's rear. Therefore, Japanese troops in Anshan and Liaoyang have been ordered to prepare to depart. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Orders All Units to Advance Towards the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Returns to Hailun from Keshan</p>
<p>Yuan Chonggu's Troops Arrive Near the Outskirts of Qiqihar</p>
<p>Skirmishes Between Patrols on Both Sides at Linjiadian</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Qiqihar Move Outside the City</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 26th, Ma Zhanshan ordered the brigades of Yuan Chonggu, Cheng Zhiyuan, and Wu Songlin to advance towards the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway. Due to the urgent situation in Jinzhou, in order to contain the Japanese army, Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, requesting permission for a counterattack. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 25th, plainclothes troops of the Heilongjiang Army's Yuan Chonggu's unit arrived near the outskirts of Qiqihar, awaiting orders to enter the city. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan returned to Hailun from Keshan today. The Heilongjiang Army's Xu Baozhen regiment moved into Linjiadian on the 26th. A Japanese armored train arrived in Taha'er on the 26th, confronting our army. On the night of the 26th, our army and enemy patrols clashed at Linjiadian on the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway. Two of our soldiers were killed. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) This afternoon, Japanese troops in Qiqihar moved outside the city. An artillery regiment moved to Toutun on the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway. 1,500 bandits from the puppet autonomous army of Wang Dianzhong and Li Shoushan, controlled by the Japanese army, entered Qiqihar on the 26th to join forces with the Japanese army to defend against Ma Zhanshan's counterattack. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Due to the growing rapport between Zhang Jinghui and Ma Zhanshan, the Japanese side has cancelled its intention to force Zhang to head the Heilongjiang government and has ordered the head of the Harbin Special Affairs Agency, Arai, to monitor Zhang's actions. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hailun Tightens Martial Law</h3>
<p>Farmers Along the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway Relocate</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese army has bribed bandits in Qiqihar and organized them into plainclothes units to infiltrate Hailun and Baiquan, plotting against the provincial government. Hailun began tightening martial law on the night of the 25th, with soldiers patrolling in double shifts. A plainclothes unit dispatched by the Japanese army was discovered near Wangkui on the night of the 25th. Ma Zhanshan dispatched the Li Qingshan regiment to intercept them. Cheng Zhiyuan, the commander of the cavalry, went to the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway today from Keshan to inspect defenses. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Farmers along the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway, fearing the outbreak of war, have requested that Ma Zhanshan run trains to transport them to other places free of charge. Ma has agreed and will run Keshan-Ningnian trains today specifically for transporting farmers. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Increases Troops in Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Another Mixed Brigade Transferred from Korea</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The cabinet approved today the transfer of another mixed brigade from Korea to Manchuria to strengthen the Japanese military presence there. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army explained the reason for the transfer of another mixed brigade from Korea to Manchuria, saying that this brigade is only temporarily being transferred to Manchuria. The rear railways of the Japanese army in Manchuria, especially the Shenyang-Andong line, are often attacked by groups with unified affiliations, and the situation is serious. The current troop strength is insufficient to cope, so it is necessary to dispatch another mixed brigade. The military authorities have decided to use these troops to help protect the railways and suppress bandits west of the Liao River in order to restore peace and order in Manchuria. The Ministry of the Army also announced that a division headquarters and a mixed brigade are currently being dispatched from Korea to Manchuria. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's Policy Towards Us</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Jinzhou reports that the Japanese army's policy towards us has been decided: (1) Lure bandits, consolidate them, provide them with weapons, and use them as vanguards for a westward advance. If they refuse to obey, suppress them severely. (2) Plan to force all troops stationed outside the Guan and bandits into the Guan before January 10th of next year. (3) Advance westward in three routes: one from Yingkou to cut off Goubangzi and then advance westward, one to launch a long-range attack along the Beining Railway towards Jinzhou, and one to occupy Faku and Kangping and then occupy Tongliao and Zhangwu and directly take Yixian. At that time, the Japanese army south of Shanhaiguan will also be ordered to destroy the Beining Railway to cut off transportation between the inside and outside of the Guan. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Responds to the Warnings of Three Countries</h3>
<p>And Issues a Statement to the Outside World</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, after submitting its replies to the British, American, and French governments, the Japanese government issued a statement explaining its attitude towards Jinzhou. It stated that the Jinzhou military authorities, while claiming to have a non-aggressive attitude, continue to instigate and utilize bandit groups to the detriment of the Japanese army, Japanese people, and law-abiding residents. Furthermore, the soldiers of the Jinzhou army are largely mixed with bandits, making it impossible to distinguish between soldiers and bandits. As long as this situation exists, China must bear the responsibility for any actions taken by the Japanese army in self-defense. The text is quite lengthy, but its main point can be summarized in the aforementioned words. This text states that the maintenance of peace and order in Manchuria has always been regarded as extremely important by the Japanese government and explains the reasons why Japan has no choice but to bear this responsibility at this time. It also states that Japan has obtained irrefutable evidence proving that the Jinzhou military authorities are currently implementing a systematic conspiracy to utilize bandits. The text then elaborates on various details, indicating that the number of Chinese soldiers and bandits has increased in recent weeks and their activities have become more rampant. Finally, it details Japan's efforts to persuade Zhang Xueliang to withdraw his troops in order to avoid conflict. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After receiving warnings from the British, American, and French governments, the Japanese government officially replied to the ministers of the three countries today and issued a statement at 3:00 PM. Its main points are as follows: (1) In response to attacks from the Chinese side, the Empire has decided to take self-defense measures in order to maintain public security and protect the interests of residents. (2) Since the Manchurian Incident, in view of the destruction of existing governing institutions, bandits have become rampant, and the situation has become increasingly unsettling. Since November, this has been particularly evident in the railway-affiliated areas, and this is all due to the planned activities of the Jinzhou military and constabulary. The recent reorganization of Jinzhou military officers and soldiers has increased the scale of their activities. These bandit disturbances have reached 1,529 incidents. However, the Japanese army has not pursued the bandits in the Liaoxi area in order to avoid conflict with the official Chinese army. (3) Gu Weijun, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, has agreed to withdraw the Jinzhou troops to the west of Shanhaiguan, and Zhang Xueliang has also voluntarily declared this repeatedly. However, there is still no sign of troop withdrawal. (4) Negotiations for the withdrawal of the Jinzhou troops inside the Guan have been ongoing for a month, but have not been effective. Recently, the Japanese army will begin to conduct large-scale bandit suppression operations, so it has no choice but to advance into the Liaoxi area to eliminate their bases. Moreover, when the League of Nations Council made its resolution, our representative Yoshizawa reserved the police power for bandit suppression. In the current situation, it is not easy to distinguish between bandits and official troops, so our army is taking appropriate self-defense measures, and the responsibility should be borne by China. (5) The Imperial Government has endured for a month while adhering to the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, the world's public opinion should recognize the sincerity of the Empire's actions. (27th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yoshizawa's Remarks to French Reporters Before Departure</h3>
<p>French Government Awards Medal</p>
<p>(Paris) Yoshizawa is scheduled to leave France at 3:00 PM on the 27th to return to his country. He may stay in Shenyang for one or two days en route. (27th Rengo Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Before his departure, Yoshizawa issued a declaration to the Parisian press, stating, "I have been summoned back to my country to assume the duties of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I have enjoyed a friendly relationship with the political circles and people of your country, which is a very pleasant memory. Before my departure, various circles in your country have expressed their sympathy, for which I am extremely grateful. I regret that I have not been able to thank everyone individually due to the short time. I had originally intended to further promote the economic relations and long-standing friendship between our two countries, but I regret that I have not been able to fully realize this intention due to my short stay in France. After returning to my country, I will continue to work hard in accordance with this long-cherished wish in the hope of success. From a political and economic point of view, Europe and Asia must maintain and develop their mutual relations and make them closer and more seamless. In particular, the concept of the interconnectedness of Japan and France has made genuine progress and should be noted. At the previous meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, I attended as the representative of Japan and had the opportunity to meet and cooperate with great politicians, which I was fortunate to use to enhance international relations. The special nature of the Sino-Japanese conflict, which was discussed at the recent meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, was made clearer by the prestige and skillful handling of Chairman Briand. As a result, a satisfactory solution was found in accordance with the actual situation in China. The investigative committee will be able to gather various information on the spot, which will be sufficient to calm the current dispute. I am fully aware of the ins and outs of this matter and will do my best to make the people of my country understand the many efforts made by France and the League of Nations for peace. Your country and the League of Nations believe that there is a common desire. I am leaving, and Japan's ambition is nothing more than to consolidate peace and order in the Far East, which I am convinced will be fully understood by France and other countries." (26th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yoshizawa, the Japanese ambassador to France, who has been promoted to Minister of Foreign Affairs of that country, was recently awarded the Second Class Medal of Honor by the French government. (26th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Arriving in Tianjin in Succession</h3>
<p>Another Thousand Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>Military Supplies Total Nine Covered Cars</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The second batch of 350 Japanese soldiers, four artillery pieces, 100 horses, and five iron covered cars of military supplies arrived in Tianjin from Tanggu at 8:30 AM on the 27th. The third batch of 650 Japanese soldiers, 38 horses, ten mortars, 20 machine guns, and four iron covered cars of military supplies arrived in Tianjin at 11:20 AM. They immediately formed ranks and entered the Japanese concession, stationing in Zhang Yuan and the former site of the Gongli Hospital. The residents' association delivered a welcoming speech, stating that they hoped that the army arriving in Tianjin would protect the concession and overseas Chinese and prevent the situation in Tianjin from escalating. They also hoped that the Jinzhou incident would not drag Tianjin into the vortex. Japanese women and children presented many towels, gloves, food, fruit, and cigarettes. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Two trains loaded with a large detachment of Japanese soldiers and an artillery unit arrived in Tianjin from Tanggu this morning. This batch totaled 1,700 people. Japanese men, women, and children all waved flags to welcome them. It is rumored that this military train came to protect Japanese expatriates and the Japanese concession, fearing that Chinese soldiers in Jinzhou would retreat in disarray during the Japanese offensive and disturb the Japanese concession. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Zhangwu Station</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 9:00 AM on the 27th, two Japanese aircraft bombed Zhangwu Station, dropping two bombs that exploded in an open area, causing no damage. At 11:00 AM, two Japanese aircraft reconnoitered Shangqitai for half an hour, then returned to Zhangwu Station and dropped two bombs, causing no damage. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoitered Yushu Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Harbin) A Japanese aircraft arrived in Yushu today to reconnoiter the movements of the 25th Brigade of the Jilin Army. It flew for more than ten minutes before leaving.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Qiqihar Disrupt the Tao'ang Railway</h3>
<p>(Harbin) On the 25th, Japanese troops in Qiqihar rode an armored train to Jiangqiao Station on the Tao'ang Railway, reportedly because the National Salvation Army intended to destroy the bridge. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the night of the 25th, the National Salvation Army detoured from Daxing Station to Moguxi, intending to disrupt the Tao'ang Railway. 300 Japanese cavalrymen from Qiqihar have gone to suppress them. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jilin Provincial Government to Issue Temporary Public Bonds</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Jilin Provisional Provincial Government will issue temporary public bonds of 5 million yuan due to a shortage of funds. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The local militias of various counties in Jilin Province have decided that personnel will be sent by the Army Training Office for training. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Special Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses Policy Towards Japan</h3>
<p>Decisions on Principles Have Been Made, Drafting Begins</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaoshu, the acting chairman of the Special Foreign Affairs Committee, convened a meeting of the committee members on the afternoon of the 27th to discuss policy towards Japan. Principles have been decided, and drafting has begun. The results can be submitted to the general assembly for discussion on the 28th. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person said that regarding the Jinzhou issue, Japan is avoiding a frontal attack and is instead gradually threatening Jinzhou from its left and right wings, and is stationing heavy troops in Tianjin and Tanggu in the rear, so that Jinzhou has no choice but to feel the pain of the Japanese encirclement and retreat without support. This plan is very obvious. The reason why the Japanese army has not decisively captured Jinzhou is merely to deceive international public opinion. It is also believed that Inukai Tsuyoshi's group may send personnel to China to use sweet words such as the old friendship of old friends from the Minseito party and the late premier to persuade the authorities to negotiate with Japan, take over the Northeast, take away the economic rights of the four provinces, return the sovereignty, and thus fulfill their long-cherished wish of buying a pearl and returning the casket. This layer should be expected. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The First Plenary Session Holds Its Fourth Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Electing Key Positions in the National Government</p>
<p>Revising the General Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>Scheduled to Close This Afternoon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The First Plenary Session is scheduled to hold its fourth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th. It is reported that the items for discussion are: 1. Electing the Chairman of the National Government and the heads of the five Yuan; 2. Electing nine standing members of the Central Executive Committee; 3. Revising the closing declaration of the General Assembly. If there are no special motions, the session can be closed in the afternoon; otherwise, it will be extended to the next morning. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The First Plenary Session will hold its fourth meeting on the afternoon of the 28th to discuss unfinished cases and elect the Chairman and members of the National Government and the heads of the various Yuan. If this is completed, the session will be closed; otherwise, it will be closed on the morning of the 29th. Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, and Lin Sen are the most promising candidates for Chairman of the National Government; Sun Ke for President of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin for Vice-President; Hu Hanmin for President of the Legislative Yuan; Wang Chonghui for President of the Judicial Yuan, or Zhang Ji or Zou Lu; Lin Sen for President of the Control Yuan, or Yu Youren or Cai Yuanpei; and Ju Zheng or Cai Yuanpei for President of the Examination Yuan. After the closing of the General Assembly, the new National Government will be formally established. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo, Ye Chucang, Deng Jiayan, Luo Jialun, and other members of the drafting committee for the declaration of the First Plenary Session began finalizing the wording of the declaration at the official residence of the Ministry of Railways on the afternoon of the 27th. A draft was completed that evening and will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion on the 28th. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Important cases at the General Assembly on the 28th: 1. Candidates for Chairman of the National Government; 2. National Salvation Conference; 3. Organization of People's Representative Organs during the Tutelage Period. Military issues may also be discussed in detail at the General Assembly. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Candidates for Chairman of the National Government</h3>
<p>Yu Youren Has the Loudest Voice</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Most members prefer to use the method of recommendation rather than voting to select the candidate for Chairman of the National Government. According to various sources, Sun Ke is confirmed for the position of President of the Executive Yuan. The Minister of Finance will be appointed by the National Government upon Sun Ke's recommendation. If there is no suitable candidate, the President of the Executive Yuan will temporarily hold the position concurrently. The candidates for ministers of the various departments will also be submitted by the President of the Executive Yuan for public decision by the General Assembly. The candidates for the heads of the various Yuan will also be determined by the General Assembly on the 28th using the method of recommending the Chairman of the National Government. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Pan Yunchao said that the news reports that Mr. Yu Youren has a very loud voice as the candidate for Chairman of the National Government is not far from the truth. The members of the National Government and the heads of the various Yuan have probably been discussed by all parties. It is not yet fully known whether it is as rumored outside. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the candidates for Chairman of the National Government, a certain member of the Central Committee said that Tang Shaoyi, Lin Sen, and Hu Hanmin are all unwilling to take the position. Currently, most people favor Yu Youren, but Yu is also being modest. Given the current situation, Yu is very promising. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that Wang Jingwei has strongly resigned from holding any position in the National Government. As a result, the members advocated that Wang Jingwei be invited to serve as Chairman of the Central Political Council. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Presidium Reviews Proposals by Gu Mengyu and Others</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The proposal by Gu Mengyu and others to convene a National Salvation Conference and establish a People's Representative Organ during the Tutelage Period was reviewed by the Political Group. On the afternoon of the 27th, the Presidium held another meeting to review it in preparation for submitting it to the General Assembly for discussion on the 28th. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Bai Wenwei submitted a proposal to the General Assembly: 1. The current government has several institutions such as the Ministry of Military Affairs, the General Staff Department, and the Military Advisory Council, which are specifically designed to implement military administration and military orders and provide consultations. There should be no additional National Defense Committee to waste national funds and gradually increase the power struggle. 2. The establishment of a political sub-committee would hinder unification and is limited to the pacification of Guangdong, which is tantamount to a three-way division. If there are more requests for precedents, how will the central government deal with them? 3. The Northeast Incident was caused by the bad feelings of one or two people. The Japanese side's goals and intentions are very clear. If one or two people cause the lives and property of many people to be affected, and a single hair moves the whole body, the aftermath will be endless. At this time of crisis, if a slight change can be made, much disaster can be avoided. 4. Diplomacy is urgent and difficult to deal with. Academic knowledge and experience are certainly necessary, but prestige and emotion are even more important. We must carefully select talents to avoid misleading the major plans of the country.

<h3>Gan NaiGuang Discusses the New Organization Law of the National Government</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Gan Naiguang said that the two special features of the National Government's organization law are: 1. The Chairman of the National Government does not hold other official positions, reducing power, which is in line with the responsible cabinet system. All powers are transferred to the Executive Yuan in order to solve all matters politically, avoid armed conflicts, and thus eliminate internal wars and unite against foreign aggression. 2. Half of the legislative and supervisory committee members are elected by the people and actually participate in politics, thereby enlightening civil rule, with the aim of embarking on the path of democratic politics, so that power can be handed over to the people in the future constitutional period.

<h3>This Year</h3>
<p>Our Country's Education in the Past Year</p>
<p>The weather is cold, and the year is drawing to a close. The rustling fallen leaves tell us that we have reached the end of another year.</p>
<p>Although a year is but a fleeting moment, like a horse glimpsing through a crack, in the endless flow of time, there is still a need for a general summary of the great changes and vicissitudes of the human world in the past year in the annals of human history. Especially for our country, in this year, the flooding of rivers, the coercion of strong neighbors, the cries of hunger and cold, and the contests of heroes of the times, whether tragic, desolate, or farcical, all have value in being reported on as a summary in the long prologue of history.</p>
<p>Here, in the next few days, we will make a general report on the domestic and foreign affairs of our country in the past year. Now, let's start with education.</p>
<p>Because politics in our country is not on track, education has also not been able to progress. Compared with the civilized and advanced countries of Europe and America, there is a vast difference. According to the statistics released by the Ministry of Education this year, in terms of numerical records, there are 34 universities in the country, of which private</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>schools account for nine. There are 18 specialized schools, of which law schools account for five, while industrial schools account for only three, and agricultural schools only two. There are 1,339 secondary schools, with an average of about 300,000 people for each secondary school. The number of secondary school students is 234,811, with an average of about 1,700 people for each secondary school student. There are only 37,604 female secondary school students, accounting for only 16% of the total number of secondary school students. Judging from these figures, the decline of education in our country is undeniable. The education of a country represents a culture. The decline of education in our country is so severe that people lack spiritual food. Illiterates account for more than 80% of the country's population. How can the country not be poor and weak? How can it not be in such a precarious situation today? As for the government's education policy and the trend of thought of students across the country, it is also necessary to make a general review here, because from this, we can glimpse the turning point of history and see the direction of social progress. In 1927, the Northern Expedition of the Party Army aroused the whole country. In particular, young students were practically engaged in the revolutionary movement, and their dedication and sacrifice did leave indelible achievements. With the Party and the country settled, the world won on horseback must not be governed on horseback. Therefore, what the government sought from education at this time was stillness, peace, and the revival of the sacred teachings of loyalty, filial piety, propriety, and righteousness. What was required of students and young people was obedience, studying to save the country, and keeping to their duties. In December of 1930, Chairman Chiang, in his busy schedule, also personally took charge of education, which shows his emphasis on education. In that month, the Executive Yuan sternly ordered the Ministry of Education to rectify the academic atmosphere, saying, "From now on, the government's policy will be to devote all its efforts to improving education. The President of the Executive Yuan, also in charge of administration, should exert his mental and physical abilities to rectify the academic atmosphere. Hereafter, students in all schools must cultivate their character and work hard in their studies. Opposing the principal is no different from opposing the government. They should concentrate on learning and cultivating their minds and bodies, revering the ancient people's precept of not overstepping their bounds, and following the Three Principles of the People of the Premier as their guide." Chairman Chiang also issued a proclamation to students across the country in his capacity as President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Education. The proclamation stated, "Zhongzheng (Chiang's given name) has learned that the country's future is in great crisis, and what causes hidden concerns is the corruption of the academic atmosphere and the rise of student unrest in schools across the country. If this is not immediately and strictly corrected, it will be like a flood that will cause endless harm." It also said, "In the past, military force has swept away the obstacles of revolution. From now on, we should use cultural governance to promote the scale of political tutelage. We vow to improve</p>
<p>education and rectify the academic atmosphere as the most urgent task. I hope that young students across the country will value integrity, uphold practical learning, and be loyal followers of the Three Principles of the People. Do not be misled by heresies, do not stray from the right path, respect teachers, value scholarship, establish oneself and help others, and save oneself and save the country." From the Executive Yuan's order and Chairman Chiang's proclamation, isn't it clear to the whole country that the government requires education to be static and students to bury themselves in their studies?</p>
<p>In July, the Executive Yuan further ordered the Ministry of Education to issue a circular to all directly affiliated agencies and schools to promote morality and make and hang plaques, establishing the eight characters of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace as the essential principles for educating the people, and to promote China's inherent morality. In the provinces, the Hunan Provincial Government requested the Ministry of Education to improve textbooks. The request stated, "Before 1919, the Chinese textbooks in schools still had literary principles. Recently, the textbooks are often filled with the words 'dog says, pig says, duck says,' as well as 'Miss Cat, Brother Dog, Grandpa Cow.' Animals can speak human words, and respectful titles are added to animals. The language is vulgar and strange beyond description." The authorities in Jilin banned vernacular writing, considering it superficial and empty, and completely useless. They added the teaching of classics and strictly prohibited singing and dancing, considering it the behavior of prostitutes, revealing madness and losing all dignity. Publicly playing and teasing is not pleasing to the eye. These are the reasons why the Jilin education authorities banned singing and dancing. The Shandong Provincial Government suggested reviving the Temple of Confucius. Central Committee members Dai Jitao and Liu Jiwen advocated repairing the Yan Temple, the Zisi Temple, and the tombs of Confucius and Mencius, as well as establishing regulations for sacrificial officials. Zhuang Songfu, deputy director of the Huai River Water Conservancy Commission, proposed two proposals to the National Assembly: implementing the rites and teachings to cultivate the people's virtue and promoting public opinion to understand the people's feelings. During this period, the extreme restoration of education and the extreme reversal of culture were even more obvious facts. This was the peak of the Party government's restoration movement in education.</p>
<p>At the same time, during this period, while the government was vigorously restoring the old in its education policy, it also expressed its determination to establish an education fund and guarantee its independence. In February, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to earnestly implement the Measures for Guaranteeing the Independence of Education Funds submitted by the Ministry of Education. The provisional constitution passed by the National Assembly also clearly stipulated that "the central and local governments should raise the necessary funds for education as widely as possible, and the funds that are legally independent should be guaranteed." And Hu Hanmin's remarks on rectifying the academic atmosphere clearly opposed the intrusion of bureaucratic politics into the education sector. These were all concrete manifestations of the government's active engagement in rectifying education.</p>
<p>However, this attempt ultimately failed. The continuous student unrest and the wave of teachers and staff striking for salaries finally shattered the government's attempt to rectify education. From last year to this year, the schools that have experienced student unrest include Guangzhou Zhongda, Shanghai Guanghua, Zhonggong Labor University, Nanyang Medical College, Anhui University, Northeast University, Beiping Normal University, Min University, Tsinghua University, Henan University, Henan Provincial No. 1 Middle School, Nanjing Central Military Academy, Jinan Women's Normal School, Shanxi No. 1 Normal School, Xiamen Shuangshi Middle School, as well as Jilin. They were vigorous and echoed each other. On the other hand, because the independence of education funds could not be realized in practice, the wave of strikes for salaries also flourished throughout the country. There were appeals from the education sector in Anhui to repay the accumulated arrears, the eighth representative conference of teachers and staff in Jiangsu Province, all primary and secondary schools in Shanxi Province, and all primary and secondary schools in Beiping. It was a very common phenomenon that teachers and staff in various places and schools were striking for salaries because there was no money for education and teachers and staff could not maintain their lives and were not at ease in their work. In addition, the army often massacred young people, such as the massacre of students in Sichuan. Under these circumstances, how could the government rectify education?</p>
<p>Therefore, the government's attempt to rectify education ultimately failed miserably under the contradictions of subjective conditions and objective environment.</p>
<p>Here, the government has changed direction again. This direction is to promote vocational education and labor education, and to promote scholarship funds and send Party members to study abroad as another policy to stabilize the psychology of young people. The Ministry of Education has clearly ordered the promotion of vocational education and labor education. The National Assembly had the same resolution. The so-called scholarship funds have been established in many schools in various places. This is obviously a measure of last resort. However, unfortunately, it is precisely at this time when people's minds are in turmoil, compounded by domestic disasters and foreign troubles. Young students are internally affected by the desolation of the cries of the disaster victims, and externally affected by the insatiable aggression of strong neighbors. At the same time, they have witnessed the government's calm perfunctoriness and indecisiveness. Therefore, they have spontaneously risen up to save themselves and save the country. They have established volunteer armies, organized anti-Japanese associations, and run around calling for action. From petitions to demonstrations, disturbances and conflicts have occurred in various provinces, such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Hangzhou. The actions are consistent, like fire and tea, and cannot be stopped. Here, it is clearly indicated that students and young people have moved from uneasiness about studying to direct action. At the same time, it is clearly indicated that the government requires the restoration of education, while students have taken the initiative to push it forward. What the government requires is stillness, but in fact, it has become movement, disturbance, and uneasiness. This must have its inevitability and is by no means accidental. Grasping this inevitability and grasping the fundamental meaning of education to determine how to lead young people and educate young people is the current responsibility of educators.</p>
<p>This is the achievement and direction of education in our country in 1931. We hope that 1932 will have better achievements and a more correct direction.</p>

<h3>Hu Hanmin's Reply to Lin Sen's Telegram</h3>
<p>Blood Pressure Still High, Unable to Travel North</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Hanmin replied to Lin Sen on the 26th, saying, "Upon receiving your telegram, I am earnestly instructed to come to Nanjing, which is too much of a demand and makes me both grateful and sad. The general situation of my illness has been reported to you in the telegrams from Xiaoma. I have been through decades of revolution and have suffered many hardships. Now that the country is in urgent danger and a new opportunity has just begun, how dare I be idle? However, since the spring of this year, I have suddenly suffered an unexpected change. I have been living in seclusion for eight months, and my mental and physical strength have been greatly damaged. Earlier, when the rebellion occurred in Shandong Province, those in charge were almost dumbfounded and helpless and did nothing. I deeply regretted that the country would be destroyed soon and the foundation of the Party would be overturned. At the request of all parties, I went to Shanghai to promote peace despite my illness. Then, following the doctor's advice, I transferred to Hong Kong for recuperation. However, there were disputes at the Fourth Plenary Session in Guangdong, and I again stood up to mediate despite my long illness. For the past two months, I have been exhausted, but unscrupulous people are still fabricating rumors and slandering me everywhere. You must know this news, and I need not elaborate. The reform of the Party and government is the most urgent task today. I have always held this view, and I have already shed tears for my comrades in Beijing. Recently, I also telegraphed Jingwei, Zhesheng, and Tiyun to discuss together. We should say everything we know and say everything to the best of our ability. I believe that the people's hearts are the Party's base. Today's affairs are not just about fighting for a day's length, nor are they about the actions of one hand or one foot. We should seek spiritual unity, and the form should not be restricted. If we can meet each other with sincerity, then our intentions should be consistent. My blood pressure is still high. Today's examination still shows 115 degrees. The doctor said that if I do not rest, I will have a stroke at any time. Therefore, I am uneasy and unable to travel north. I am saddened and hurried to reply, hoping for your understanding." (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Presidium Hosts Banquet for All Central Committee Members</h3>
<p>Li Liejun Delivers Speech</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Presidium of the Plenary Session, Yu Youren, He Yingqin, Ju Zheng, Ding Weifen, Gu Mengyu, and others, hosted a banquet for all Central Committee members at the Lizi Society on the evening of the 27th, with more than 100 people attending. Each committee member made an important speech. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Presidium of the Plenary Session hosted a banquet for all Central Committee members on the evening of the 27th, the committee members from Nanjing held an informal discussion at the Lizi Society to exchange opinions on the candidates for the new government. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Lin Sen, He Yingqin, Wu Tiecheng, and others hosted a banquet for the Central Committee members at the Lizi Society at 6:00 pm on the 27th, with more than 100 people attending. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 7:00 pm on the 27th, Lin Sen, Yu Youren, and others hosted a banquet for the Central Committee members at the Lizi Society, with more than 100 people attending. Li Liejun delivered a speech, saying, "Tonight, we are very grateful and pleased to be invited by Chairman Lin and the central government officials to a banquet. In the past two or three months, our Party members have come to the capital resolutely, assessing the urgency of the situation, the demands of society, and the hopes of the people, to participate in the conference. In just a few days, we have decided on all major plans. Not only has the spirit of democratic centralism been manifested, but the implementation of democratic politics will also not be far away. Now that Feng Huanzhang, Liu Yuncheng, Li Renchao, and Li Delin have successively entered the capital, we will see that our Party is becoming more and more united and the central government is becoming more and more consolidated. Following this gradual progress, if we can truly unite spiritually and work together harmoniously, then we can foresee that those who are farming in Fenghua, writing the Cao Quan stele in Hong Kong, and recuperating in Shanghai will all gladly enter the capital to lead everything. If so, the great unity of our Party, in fact and in spirit, is greatly promising. Not only will we be able to comfort ourselves, but we will also be able to comfort the people of the country. What fear is there of the violent eastern neighbor? The success of this conference is due to the leadership of the elders. Whether we are serving in the central government or whether we are comrades from various provinces and overseas, we are all willing to assist those of us who are old and virtuous to implement new plans."

<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Special Train Passed Through Jinan Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Feng Talked About the Significance of Going to Beijing in Three Ways</p>
<p>Published a Letter to Compatriots on the Way</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Feng Yuxiang's special train passed through Fengtai at 10:00 am on the 27th, Luofa at 11:00 am, and arrived in Tianjin at 12:40 pm. Wang Yimin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, led a security team and a military band to the main station to guard the area. Sun Chuanfang, Cheng Ke, Lin Shuyan, Lu Chengwu, Dong Xicheng, and more than 10 others arrived at the station to welcome him. Wang Shuchang and Zhou Longguang, the provincial and municipal authorities, did not arrive at the station. Wang sent Chief of Staff Liu Jialuan to represent him in welcoming him. Those who traveled with Feng included Central Committee member Liu Shouzhong, aides Gao Xingya, Li Xingzhong, Wang Shijiu, He Chuqiang, Lei Jishang, Guo Zengkai, Zhang Shengsan, Wang Daoyu, Ding Shuben, and more than a dozen members of the pistol team. Feng wore a blue cloth cotton-padded jacket and a gray cloth cloak, looking like a countryman. Feng got off the train, shook hands with those who welcomed him, and repeatedly said that he was sorry to have troubled everyone to come and greet him in such cold weather. He then agreed to be photographed by reporters from various newspapers and went into the car with Sun Chuanfang and others to talk. The car then turned to the Jinpu Road and headed south. The reporters also boarded the car to the West Station and had a ten-minute conversation with Feng. Feng said, "When I arrive in Nanjing, I will focus on foreign affairs. Seeing that Japan has trampled on the three northeastern provinces, we cannot but think of a way. Therefore, I have many proposals that I want to put forward at the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Now that there are no obstacles in politics, everyone will be able to unite and find a way for diplomacy and put politics on track. Furthermore, Nanjing is surrounded by the guns of imperialism and is not suitable as a capital. I intend to move it to the interior of China to ensure safety." At this point, the car arrived at the West Station. The reporters and Sun Chuanfang and others got off the train. Han Fuju and Shi Yousan sent telegrams and sent representatives to Dezhou to welcome him. (Special telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang passed through Fengtai at 8:30 am this morning and went to Tianjin. Feng wore a blue cloth jacket and trousers and rode in a closed railway car and a freight car. Aides Liu Shouzhong, Yun Rong, Lei Jishang, and a hundred members of the guard training regiment accompanied him. Zhang Xueliang sent Bao Wenxue to Fengtai to welcome him. Feng said that he had received successive telegrams from the central government summoning him to attend the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. He said that he did not dare to accept the welcome along the way. "The plan to save the country cannot be exhausted in one word. The whole country should unite and differences of opinion should be resolved through political means, not through war. The Party should be close to the people, and politics should be open and honest. A unified government should be formed, and preparations should be made for war against Japan and the recovery of lost territory." Yan Xishan could not come because his father was still ill. He highly praised Wang Jingwei's meeting to save the country. He said that there were three points to going to Beijing this time: (1) The Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou was very urgent; (2) To promote national unity; (3) To quickly recover the lost territory. Feng reported his itinerary to Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin in a telegram from Shijiazhuang. He also published a letter to his compatriots on the way, saying that in order to jointly meet the national crisis, he resolutely came to Beijing to attend the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. He will put forward the following specific opinions: 1. Representatives from various mass organizations should quickly organize a National Salvation Conference to supervise all major diplomatic, domestic, and military plans during the national crisis. 2. Establish a National Defense Committee to unify military organizations and military command, select strong troops, and move them to the forefront and other important areas to implement the recovery of lost territory by force. 3. Give pensions to the martyrs who died in previous revolutionary battles and the current anti-Japanese war to encourage morale. Feng believes that the above three items are the current urgent tasks to save the country. He has telegraphed a detailed plan to the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee and requested a public decision. He called on all compatriots and all comrades of the Party to work together to promote its realization, upholding the spirit of peace, struggle, and saving China of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang's entourage said that Feng had previously lived outside Fenyang City, Shanxi Province, with Li Dequan, first in Yudao River, and then bought a mill near Shidun'an, 30 miles from the city. He lived there and ate noodles, and he personally milled the flour. Every morning, he went around the mountains for a week and returned to read and practice calligraphy. He read social science books. Feng established a civilian primary school nearby, providing students with food and drink. There were more than 100 students. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Feng Yuxiang submitted a total of three proposals to the Central Plenary Session. The full text has been telegraphed to Beijing. The main text and measures of each proposal are as follows: (A) Proposal for Mass Supervision of the Government: In order to prepare for the war against Japan in the face of the national crisis, mass organizations should supervise the government and military organs, as well as the troops in various places. 1. A National Salvation Conference should be established as soon as possible. Branches of the National Salvation Conference should be established in various provinces, cities, and counties, organized by representatives of purely mass organizations. The members are as follows: (1) Farmers' organizations; (2) Workers' organizations; (3) Businessmen's organizations; (4) Journalists; (5) Educators; (6) Important production organizations; (7) Other occupational combinations; (8) Party departments at all levels. The tasks of the National Salvation Conference are: (1) Supervising government administration; (2) Auditing government revenue and expenditure; (3) Matters that should be promoted or abolished should be discussed and handed over to the government for implementation; (4) If the National Salvation Conference considers an official to be corrupt or derelict in his duties, it may petition his directly superior organ to suspend the war and hand him over to judicial judgment. The National Salvation Conference at all levels has the power to supervise the troops fighting against foreign countries at the front and may control their retreat in the face of battle. It may also supervise and audit the military discipline and military supplies of the local garrison troops. (B) Proposal for Recovering Lost Territory by Force: (1) Main text: Implement the recovery of the lost territory in Northeast China by force. (2) Measures: Organize a National Defense Committee, unify steelmaking, steel production, and arsenals, and build the interior. (3) Select strong troops and concentrate them at the forefront and other important areas. (4) Implement conscription. (5) Implement national mobilization. (C) Proposal for Giving Pensions to Deceased Officers and Soldiers: (1) Main text: In order to prepare for war against foreign countries, pensions and awards should be given to the officers and soldiers who died in previous revolutionary battles and the anti-Japanese war to strengthen the faith of officers and soldiers. (2) Measures: (1) Worship the deceased officers and soldiers. (2) Give pensions to the families of the deceased officers and soldiers. (3) Welfare homes and factories should be established to accommodate the disabled officers and soldiers. Those who are injured and meritorious should be given separate awards to encourage them. (4) Establish schools for the children of military officers and soldiers. (5) Establish a special management agency and designate special funds. (26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Feng Yuxiang's special train passed through Dezhou at 9:35 pm and came south. It is expected to pass through Jinan at 12:00. Preparations are being made here to welcome him. The station is heavily guarded. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Feng Yuxiang and Liu Shouzhong went south to attend the plenary session. Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, and others sent a telegram to welcome him on the 27th, forwarded by the Jinan Provincial Government and the Xuzhou Garrison Headquarters. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Two Suggestions for Military System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Swiss General Sonderer has made some suggestions on China's military system, saying that China's military expenditure reaches as much as 434 million yuan per year, but it does not actually help national defense. This is the malpractice of mercenary soldiers. We should quickly switch to conscription and militia systems so that military expenditure can be reduced and the number of combatants can be increased. If we switch to conscription, with one-year discharges, it will only account for 40% of the current military expenditure, and we can obtain 6 million combatants in ten years. If we train militias, the number will be even greater. Because the four countries of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia were punished by the Paris Peace Conference, they were restricted from using conscription. Why should China impose restrictions on itself and not adopt the conscription system? Furthermore, Wu Guang, our military attaché in Germany, suggested that conscription and militia should be used together. The number of militiamen who enlist in our country every year is over 500,000, and it is not difficult to draw one in a thousand. Conscription should be limited to 300,000 regular troops, with one batch of infantry discharged every year and cavalry, artillery, and special forces every two years. We only need to spend the military salary of 300,000 men each year, and after ten years, the call-up of militiamen and conscripts can reach 5 million people. Therefore, the reason why the militia is the main force is to save money and stabilize production. If the militia is formed on the spot, it can easily deal with any banditry in the area. Because the people of our country think that tribes are more important than the country, it is enough to give the militia the responsibility of self-defense to give play to their natural tendencies.

<h3>The Shaanxi Fellow Townsmen in Beijing Held a Tea Party Yesterday</h3>
<p>Criticized the Authorities for Suspending Schools</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shaanxi fellow townsmen in Beijing held a tea party at the Central Hotel on the afternoon of the 27th, with hundreds of people attending. Yang Hucheng sent Finance Director Li Zhigang to report that Shaanxi Province's finances were extremely strained after the disaster. Compared with the annual income and expenditure, there was a shortfall of several million yuan. It was inevitable that Northwestern University and various middle schools would be temporarily suspended. Once the finances were available, they would be restored. Due to insufficient financial resources, the construction projects could not be implemented as scheduled. However, local bandits have been severely suppressed and have been gradually eliminated. At that time, many fellow townsmen criticized the suspension of schools, and the atmosphere at the meeting was very tense. Yu Youren said that the politics of Shaanxi Province have been extremely corrupt over the years, and the people have suffered greatly. Therefore, he hoped that Shaanxi people would govern Shaanxi for the happiness of their hometown. He now hopes that Director Li will convey the public opinion of his fellow townsmen and earnestly reform politics and revitalize public welfare to relieve the suffering of the people. The fellow townsmen also felt that the situation in the Northeast was critical and decided to ask Yang to transfer troops north to support and recover the lost territory. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Hucheng is scheduled to arrive in Beijing from Hubei on the 28th and plans to return to Shaanxi on the 29th. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>

At the same time, the Guangzhou Martial Law Command was also abolished accordingly, and the Central District Pacification Commissioner's Office was established in its place. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Cavalry Mutiny in Feng County</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Jinpu Garrison Headquarters has sent personnel to Feng County on the 27th to investigate the mutiny of the 3rd Cavalry Division in Feng County and wait for a report to be processed. Zhang Zhankui appointed Yang Tianbin, deputy division commander stationed in Feng County, as the city defense commander, and announced that Dong Yu, a member of the Party Committee, was suspected of being reactionary and would be handed over to the Pacification Commissioner's Office for handling. County Magistrate Yang Jian and the detained personnel have not yet regained their freedom. Telephone communication to Tongfeng is still blocked. Feng County civil servants continue to flee to Xuzhou.

<h3>Lancashire Cotton Industry Brewing Strike</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Manchester, 26th: The Lancashire cotton industry is on the verge of a strike in the new year. 500,000 workers will be affected. The main reason is the increase in working hours, followed by the reduction of wages and the reduction of staff. In the past two years, the cotton industry has often been in a state of decline and unrest, either due to strikes by workers or shutdowns by factory owners. Recently, the Cotton Spinners' and Manufacturers' Association announced that it would terminate the 1919 working hours and wage contract on December 31. The contract stipulates a 48-hour work week and a 30% increase in wages. Later, wages were reduced by 12.5%. It is now heard that the Association wants to restore the 52.5-hour work week and reduce wages by another 12.5%. If the Manufacturers' Association also joins the Cotton Spinners' and Manufacturers' Association, 200,000 people will be directly affected, and another 300,000 people are likely to be affected as well. However, the Manufacturers' Association itself is also in dispute with workers over increasing the number of looms managed per worker, and no solution has been reached. The Association has now decided to ask its branches to express their views on the decision of the Cotton Spinners' and Manufacturers' Association. The factory workers in Lancashire are now very angry and have organized an office to actively promote their cause. Union leaders have also stated that they intend to persevere to the end. If the factory owners do not make concessions, a strike on January 1st is likely unavoidable. The factory workers are particularly angry about the restoration of the 52.5-hour work week, saying that if this is the case, they will have to get up earlier and start work at 6:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>All India Congress Chairman Nehru Prepares to Welcome Gandhi, Arrested</h3>
<p>Situation Unstable on the Northwest Frontier of India</p>
<p>Havas, Allahabad, 26th: Yesterday morning, Nehru, Chairman of the Indian National Congress, was about to set off to prepare for welcoming Gandhi, who will arrive in Bombay on Sunday, when he was suddenly arrested by the police. Upon hearing the news, the Congress Committee cancelled all the welcoming ceremonies for Gandhi and announced a "day of mourning" to protest. Many members of the Volunteer Corps immediately took cars to various places to spread the news of Nehru's arrest and distribute declarations issued by the Committee, calling on workers everywhere to stop work. Telegrams from all over India stated that the Congress Committee was encouraging the people not to pay rent, and the non-resistance movement seemed to be reactivated. The situation on the Northwest Frontier of India has also become unstable again. Communist leader Abdu Ghaffar Khan and many of his followers were arrested for advocating independence in violation of orders and have been exiled to Bengal. Eighteen representatives of the Round Table Conference returned to Bombay yesterday and issued a declaration stating that the Round Table Conference has not failed. Whether the results achieved can be effective depends entirely on the Indians themselves.</p>
<p>Havas, Peshawar, 26th: The situation in the Northwest Frontier Provinces of India is currently extremely unstable. Therefore, the police stations arrested many members of illegal organizations and Communist agitators yesterday and today.</p>
<h3>Plot to Assassinate Japanese Ambassador to Russia Hirota Case</h3>
<p>Czech Government Suspects Russian Intelligence Deliberately Fabricated</p>
<p>National News Agency, Prague, 26th: The Czech government authorities do not believe the rumor that Werner, an official of the Czech diplomatic office in Russia, plotted to assassinate Hirota, the Japanese ambassador to Russia. It is said that Werner had a disagreement with the Russian intelligence authorities and was therefore framed. Werner is gentle in nature and has never been fond of risky undertakings. He has also served as the secretary of the Russian office for five years. Before this incident, the Czech authorities had planned to promote him.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 26th: The conspiracy of a Soviet citizen to assassinate Japanese Ambassador Hirota is still attracting attention here. According to various indications, this matter may not be ended merely by recalling a certain diplomatic official who was the mastermind. There may be important repercussions.</p>

<h3>Capital Citizens Support the Grand Meeting for Peaceful Reunification</h3>
<p>Various agencies, groups, and people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting at the public sports field at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th to support peaceful reunification and urge the Central Committee members to jointly alleviate the national crisis. Zhou Bomin, representing the municipal party department, Ni Guanghe, representing the agricultural sector, Jing Songquan, representing the industrial sector, Mu Huaxuan, representing the business sector, and Luo Ciqi, representing the overseas Chinese, served as the presidium of the meeting. On the Central Committee side, Li Liejun, Jing Hengyi, and Shang Zhen attended. Approximately 5,000 representatives from various agencies and people's organizations attended. Chairman Zhou Bomin presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, the chairman reported the significance of the meeting, stating that since the Party lost its cohesive force, internal political disturbances have lost their center of operation, and external powers are coveting and taking the opportunity to occupy our territory. The national situation is in danger, and people are panicked. Fortunately, the advanced members of the Party feel that in this critical situation, there is no solution except to unite and strive for peaceful reunification. Now, all parties are working together, and peaceful reunification has been successfully achieved. The significance of today's meeting is (1) to hope that the Party will improve Party affairs and political organization with a spirit of great unity and permanently lay the foundation for peaceful reunification. In the future, anyone who undermines peaceful reunification will be the public enemy of the people. (2) To hope that the unified government will relieve all the suffering of the people after its establishment so that the people can obtain genuine benefits. (3) To hope that all the people will have the determination to sacrifice and fight, concentrate their strength, and serve as the government's backing to jointly overthrow Japanese imperialism. Next, Central Committee member Jing Hengyi gave a speech, stating that Japan is showing its violence, abandoning all international treaties and credibility, and the world's justice, and is not satisfied with occupying our Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, but is launching a large-scale attack on our Jinzhou. This barbaric act is indeed intolerable by justice. However, if our people only know how to rely on justice and do not immediately mobilize to resist violence, they are actually abdicating their duty. However, our national education is too incomplete, and even compared with Japan, it is inevitably inferior. This is a fundamental and major problem. As a member of the education community, I speak of education in terms of education, so I sincerely hope that national education will become more and more developed to enrich the strength of the people. Next, Li Liejun gave a speech, stating that today's national affairs are urgent. In terms of external aggression, it is even worse than the Sino-British War, the Sino-French War, the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, and the Boxer Rebellion. In terms of the domestic disturbances in the past few years, it is even worse than the Spring and Autumn Period, the Warring States Period, the Six Dynasties, and the Five Dynasties. This is truly a critical moment for the nation's survival. It is time for our comrades and compatriots to die for the country. We are instructed to peacefully reunify and jointly face the national crisis. We came to Beijing for this purpose. Since we have been entrusted with the task, we must work harder. However, in order to jointly face the national crisis, we must unite the strength of the entire people and be of one mind and one heart. However, empty words are of no use. If we really want to achieve the goal of saving the country, we must quickly publicize the power to the people so that the people can directly and indirectly participate in politics and embark on the road of people's politics so that the power of the people throughout the country can be used. Li Liejun has proposed to his comrades in Beijing to implement civil rights, carry out constitutionalism, and elect county magistrates, but these proposals have not been adopted, which is very regrettable. However, at this serious moment, the people at the conference are working hard to find a way to save the situation, and the people must still unite and work hard and not abandon their responsibility and work together to solve it. Next, Shang Zhen gave a speech, painfully stating the urgency of the situation in Jinzhou. If Jinzhou is not defended, then all parts of North China will be shaken. Therefore, the government and the people must cooperate to resist aggression, otherwise, the danger of national destruction will be imminent. Now, the Party's unity and political unification should have a true spirit and be carried through to the end, not just in form. Next, overseas Chinese representative Luo Ciqi and others gave speeches in succession, and then the following proposals were passed: (1) Send a telegram to the whole country to support peaceful reunification and vow to use the power of the people to permanently stop any civil war. (2) Send a telegram to all members of the Central Committee, asking them to follow their conscience, unite sincerely, and jointly face the national crisis. (3) Send a telegram to leaders such as Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and Chiang Kai-shek, asking them to come to Beijing immediately to jointly govern the central government. (4) Request the Central Government to telegraph Zhang Xueliang to defend Jinzhou with all his strength. (5) Request the Central Government to quickly send elite troops to recover the lost territories. (6) Request the Central Government to request the United States to immediately convene the signatory countries of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty to sanction the violent Japan. (7) Request the Central Government to determine its diplomatic policy and vigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy. (8) Request the Central Government to concentrate diplomatic talents and quickly strengthen the embassies and consulates. (9) Request the Central Government to formulate a national defense plan. (10) Request the Central Government to implement a conscription system. (11) Request the Central Government to rectify discipline and purify internal affairs. (12) Request the Central Government to convene a national salvation conference as soon as possible. (13) Effectively guarantee the people's various freedoms. (14) Request the Central Government to support the people's movement and restore its vertical organization. (15) Request the Central Government to strictly prohibit the military from interfering in politics. (16) Oppose the establishment of political subcommittees and military region systems to avoid the development of separatist situations. Finally, the meeting ended with slogans.</p>
<h3>Feng and Yan Decide to Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>They Have Already Discussed Everything in Lancun</p>
<p>And Sent Telegrams to Wang and Hu to Solicit Opinions</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Yan and Feng, who have been separated for over a year, have achieved unity due to the current national crisis. The First Plenary Session of the Central Committee has already opened in Beijing, and Lin Sen and others have sent telegrams urging them to go to Beijing to attend, believing that it is necessary to meet and discuss. Therefore, they mutually agreed and invited Zhao Daiwen and Liu Shouchong, two Central Committee members in Taiyuan, to meet yesterday (the 23rd) at Jinshan Middle School in Lancun, because the area is relatively quiet and can avoid the hustle and bustle. The situation in Taiyuan and Lancun yesterday is recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Feng Passes Through Taiyuan: Feng was originally scheduled to depart from Fenyang at 7:00 AM to go to Taiyuan and then to Lancun. However, due to a farewell meeting held by students from various schools in Fenyang before his departure, he was slightly delayed and did not depart until 8:30 AM. His accompanying staff included Li Xingzhong, Wang Sijiu, He Chuqiang, Ying Yiquan, Lei Jishang, and Guo Zengkai, a total of six people, traveling in two cars. They stopped to refuel in Wenshui, and Feng walked seven or eight li, so he did not arrive in Taiyuan until after 11:00 AM. Military and political figures such as Yang Aiyuan, Sun Chu, Li Fuying, Wang Jingguo, Rong Honglu, Zhou Dai, Wang Ping, Wang Xifu, Li Shangren, Shao Xiuwen, and Chen Zengzhi all went to meet him at the New South Gate Bus Station. After Feng got out of the car, he shook hands with each of the welcomers, repeatedly saying, "In this cold weather, I am really sorry to trouble you all." His staff distributed short declarations (see below). Feng wore a short blue cotton jacket, with a blue cotton padded coat and trousers underneath, and blue cloth single-strap cotton shoes, blue cloth socks, and a snuff-colored felt hat, completely dressed as a countryman. He nodded frequently, his smile amiable, and his spirits were excellent. By this time, the platform was crowded with welcoming students and representatives of various groups, who applauded when they saw Feng arrive. The crowds watching on both sides also applauded. After walking a few steps, he was accompanied by Yang Aiyuan and others to get into a car to rest at the second guesthouse of the Provincial Government on Xinmin Street. He exchanged greetings with the officials for about ten minutes. Most of the welcomers then excused themselves, and Feng personally saw them to the gate before returning. After a short rest, he took a car to visit Central Committee member Liu Shouchong at No. 7 Xinmin West Street. After talking for half an hour, he and Liu took a car out of the Small North Gate and drove to Lancun. Yang Aiyuan, Wang Ping, and others also went by car one after another.</p>
<p>Yan Arrives at Lancun: Yan set off from Hebian at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. His entourage included Du Chunyi, Li Guanyang, Ning Chaowu, and Wang Zunguang, traveling in two cars. They arrived at Jinshan Middle School in Lancun at 11:00 AM and immediately went to the teaching office to rest and wait for Feng. Yan's spirit was better than last year's. He wore a small melon-shaped hat, a blue satin mandarin jacket, a gray cloth cotton robe, and gray cloth cotton trousers, with grayish-white woolen socks on his feet. Zhao Daiwen arrived at Lancun at 10:00 AM. Yan had a long talk with Zhao and met with Li Fuying, Wang Xifu, and others who had arrived before Feng. For a while, Yan went out of the school to tour the mountains and watch the springs. After half an hour, Feng and Liu Shouchong arrived, and Zhao Daiwen went out to greet them, shook hands, and bid farewell, then led them to the small rest area in the inner courtyard.</p>
<p>Yan and Feng Meet: Soon Yan returned, walking to the inner courtyard, repeatedly saying, "Mr. Feng has arrived, Mr. Feng has arrived!" When he entered the room, he rushed forward to shake hands with Feng in greeting, each saying "Long time no see, long time no see," and smiled at each other. Then, he dismissed the others, and only Yan, Feng, Liu, Zhao, and Yang Aiyuan remained in the room. They immediately had a very thorough discussion on their future positions on the current situation and the proposals for the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. They dispersed at 3:00 PM. Then, Ning Chaowu and Gao Xingya drafted a telegram. Yan, Feng, Liu, and Zhao went to the courtyard to take a group photo. Yan and Liu Shouchong, Feng and Zhao Daiwen yielded their positions to each other for a long time. Finally, Yan stood on the right, and his left was in the order of Liu, Zhao, and Feng. After the photo was taken, Feng went to the back mountain with his staff to watch the springs, saying, "Let me open my eyes." He returned after half an hour.</p>
<p>Yan and Feng Give Speeches: Feng then acceded to the request of all the students of Jinshan Middle School and gave a speech in the auditorium. In essence, he expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the authorities' lack of resistance to the recent occupation of the three northeastern provinces by the violent Japanese, and advocated striving for mass movements. Young people should fight and shed blood for this civil right. The only glimmer of hope for China now is that patriotic young people can rise up together to save the country. He hoped that everyone would rush forward. After the speech, there was thunderous applause. Yan also took the stage to speak, saying that China used to seek survival on the basis of equilibrium, but now it can no longer do so. Our country's weakness did not begin today, and it is necessary to prepare for at least twenty years. We should not lightly declare war today, but we must also resist.</p>
<p>Feng's Remarks: After Feng's speech, reporters from various Taiyuan newspapers went forward to request an audience. Feng led them to the conference room and made the following simple remarks: "My political views for the future have been detailed in my reply to Mr. Wang's telegram and the simple declaration I issued today, so I will not repeat them. In short, I advocate active war preparation against Japan and internal unity and cooperation. I will not return to Fenyang and have decided to go to Beijing to attend the Central Committee Plenary Session. Mr. Yan and the two members Liu and Zhao have also decided to go and have telegraphed Mr. Wang and Mr. Hu to solicit their opinions. Once their reply arrives, a decision can be made. I have already telegraphed Mr. Lin Zichao with this intention. I believe that there is nothing that cannot be said to others and I am very willing to meet with you all. I hope to have a long talk with you tomorrow and hope that you will raise more questions so that I can do my best."</p>
<p>Yan's Remarks: The reporters then visited Yan and had a brief question-and-answer session with him: (Question) Mr., what was the result of today's meeting with the members Feng, Liu, and Zhao? (Answer) Faced with the national crisis, it is our inescapable duty. I have decided to do my best and work hard with all the comrades of the party and the country to jointly save the crisis. (Question) What are your views on the current situation? (Answer) The country is so weak that it is already at its limit. We should establish common goals for national salvation, determine a plan of action, catch up quickly, and work together to seek salvation. (Question) Will you and the members Feng, Liu, and Zhao go to Beijing immediately? Has the departure date been determined? (Answer) We have telegraphed Mr. Wang and Mr. Hu, asking them to go to Beijing together. (Question) Can the original text of the telegram that the members sent to Mr. Lin today be published? (Answer) It can be published. The original telegram is as follows: "We have telegraphed comrades Wang and Hu to discuss the departure date. We will reply as soon as we come to Beijing together. (Signed) Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, Liu Shouchong, Zhao Daiwen." (Question) How will the Shanxi massacre be handled? (Answer) I have discussed this matter with Mr. Feng, Liu, and Zhao. We all advocate going together to offer condolences to the injured and dead students, and jointly send a telegram to the Central Committee Plenary Session to report the truth of the incident and request that it be dealt with according to law. (Question) Will you still return to Hebian? (Answer) I will return to Hebian temporarily. (Question) What proposals do you have for the Central Committee Plenary Session? (Answer) I plan to propose two cases: national salvation and self-strengthening. I am currently drafting them. (Note: One is a ten-year self-strengthening plan, which includes military, political, educational, economic, and production development, and the other is a plan for ten thousand elite troops to defend Jinzhou to the death.)</p>
<p>Yan and Feng Return Separately: At about 5:00 PM, Yan, Feng, and the officials went to the dining room for dinner. At 6:00 PM, Feng bid farewell to Yan and returned to the city by car, staying at the office at No. 30 Cangmenqian. At 6:10 PM, Zhao Daiwen and Liu Shouchong also entered the city by car. Yan stayed in Lancun alone, personally organizing the telegrams and proposals. At 7:30 PM, he returned to Hebian by the original car.</p>
<p>Feng's Declaration: Feng issued a simple declaration when he arrived in Taiyuan yesterday, saying, "Fellow compatriots, comrades, Yuxiang has come to Taiyuan this time to work with comrades to overcome the national crisis. The specific views have been detailed in the previous telegram to Mr. Wang Jingwei. I firmly believe that in the future, if China wants to overthrow imperialism externally and eliminate feudal warlords internally, it must support democratic forces and establish democratic politics so that the general revolutionary masses can carry out legitimate struggles with concrete organizations. If the government leaves the masses, it will become counter-revolutionary. If the government does not have a broad mass base, it will soon collapse. Now that autocratic politics has fallen, we must work harder from now on to ensure that the roots of autocratic politics are eradicated in China in the future. The future of the Republic of China will be promising. I, Xiang, uphold this belief and will never waver. I am willing to work with my compatriots throughout the country and comrades in the party to achieve this." Feng Yuxiang, December 23, 1931.</p>
<h3>Changes in Zhang Zhankui's Troops in Fengxian County</h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies are Controlled</p>
<p>And Trenches are Being Dug Outside the City</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Third Cavalry Division of Zhang Zhankui has been stationed in Feng, Pei, and Dang counties in northwestern Xuzhou for several months. Zhang's troops are organized according to a three-regiment system, with a total of about 2,000 people. The division headquarters and the first regiment are stationed in Fengxian County, the second regiment is stationed in Zhouzhai, Dangshan County, and the first regiment is stationed in Loulou, Peixian County. However, the pay is insufficient, and most of it is levied locally. Two weeks ago, Zhang borrowed 5,000 yuan from all sectors of Fengxian County to maintain military pay. The county government was responsible for 3,000 yuan, and the chamber of commerce was responsible for 2,000 yuan. Fengcheng is a small area, and its strength is already difficult to overcome. Zhang then borrowed daily maintenance fees from the local area, about 500 yuan, from the county magistrate Yang Liang to convene a meeting of various agency personnel, and decided that it was difficult to comply. Zhang was very dissatisfied and immediately expressed that if there was no money, it would be difficult to maintain military discipline. However, all sectors felt that the money was really not available, and it was difficult to take care of it. At that time, the situation was already serious. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 PM on the 25th, the troops of Zhang's troops stationed in the city suddenly acted freely.</p>
<p>For a while, gunshots rang out everywhere, and important agencies in the city, such as the county government, the party headquarters, the finance department, the agricultural and industrial bank, and the chamber of commerce, were successively controlled, and the county magistrate Yang Liang, the party committee Dong Yuqiu, and other important leaders were all taken into custody. All the police and police guns were confiscated, the city gates were closed to prohibit entry and exit, and the order in the city was in chaos. Fortunately, the merchants and people were not disturbed. The deputy captain of the county police team, Zhang Yaxuan, and the seventh district chief, Wang Chunjiu, disguised themselves and escaped from the city overnight, running to Xuzhou this afternoon (the 26th). They immediately reported to the garrison headquarters. According to Zhang and Wang, when Yu and others left Feng, Zhang's troops outside the city were digging trenches around the city. Before the change, Zhang's troops stationed in Loulou and Zhouzhai had transferred some of their troops to Fengxian County, and the family members of Zhang's division commander had also been sent away from Feng. After the police team surrendered their guns, the officials were forbidden to go out. A platoon leader was injured in the shoulder by Zhang's soldiers because he and Yu and others escaped together, and his military uniform had not been removed. When Yu and others left the city, there was no looting in the city. It is not known what happened at night. The most strange thing is that Zhang's division commander walked along the city, and his troops had acted freely, which is very strange. Yu Qing used a long-distance call to inquire to Fengcheng. Although the line was not broken, he repeatedly shouted without responding. According to legend, the order in Fengcheng was very chaotic. The garrison department paid great attention to this and heard that it would be reported to the authorities for handling. (26th)</p>

<p>Jiangbei Disaster Victims Obstruct the Operation of Cars: The Zhenyang Road has been unable to travel for more than four months since the autumn floods, resulting in considerable losses for the company. After the water receded, the roads that were submerged were fundamentally redone, and most of the roads that were not submerged were occupied by disaster victims living in sheds nearby. Then, they invested money to obtain relocation. Currently, the car has not been opened for a month, and in the afternoon of the previous day (25), when the car arrived at Hongqiao Town, it was blocked by the disaster victims who had previously lived on the road, claiming that when they moved, they had asked the company staff to help them ask the Justice and Relief Agency for relief, so now they are here to get flour or they will not allow the car to be opened. After the company sent people to explain in detail, and the passengers spoke from the middle again, the car was allowed to go. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM yesterday (26), three or four hundred male and female disaster victims gathered again to block the car at the original location yesterday. After the company staff Ma Zhongwen and Hu Ansheng and the Hongqiao Land Station Chief repeatedly persuaded the men to disperse, but the women still refused to retreat.

The disaster victims then dispersed.</p>

The Provincial Middle School even has a declaration of unlimited strike, roughly saying that they will wait until the government sends troops before resuming classes.</p>

The previous day, Chen氏There was another telegram to the Executive Yuan, roughly meaning that Zisheng's talent and learning are shallow and his experience is sparse, and Wei uses governance to govern the education of bandit provinces, to follow the Ze Yu Ku Gao, and to correct the direction of the wind.

<h3>Hunan Provincial Government Strictly Orders to Maintain Education Fees</h3>
<p>A Letter to the Headquarters of the Fourth Route Army to Stop the Military from Intercepting and Taking Education Salt Attached</p>
<p>Order the Salt Transport Bureau to Allocate 93,000 yuan per Month for Education Expenses</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province's education funds were originally allocated 93,000 yuan per month from the salt tax surcharge. The provincial government made overall arrangements to order the Hunan Coast Salt Transport Bureau to allocate it monthly. Therefore, in this time of financial distress, education funds can still maintain the status quo. Recently, salt taxes in various places have been intercepted locally by the managers of various divisions, which has caused the salt to be attached to education and the future of education to be extremely dangerous. The provincial government, according to the request of Chen Runlin and other representatives of the education community, forwarded a letter to the headquarters, strictly ordering each division not to directly intercept and take the salt to be attached to education fees, and ordering the Salt Affairs Audit Office and the Hunan Coast Salt Transport Bureau to allocate 93,000 yuan of education fees per month to maintain education, etc. It has been sent to the Hunan Coast Salt Bureau and the Salt Affairs Audit Office for compliance, and a letter has been sent to the headquarters of the Fourth Route Army for investigation and handling. The letter said, "The sender is Chen Runlin and other representatives of the education community, who are presenting the case of 93,000 yuan attached to salt, which is shaking. Please quickly send a letter to the Ministry to stop the interception and take it, and strictly order the bureaus to allocate it monthly to show faith and maintain education. I believe that the 93,000 yuan education funds in Hunan Province, which are allocated monthly from the salt attachment item, are the lifeblood of each school. Since the financial support telegram occurred, Jun Zuo ordered the Hunan Coast Salt Transport Bureau to allocate it monthly, hoping to obtain security and勉可Maintain the status quo, but the facts are getting poorer day by day. If it is not strictly implemented, it will be impossible to solve it. I have presented it to Jun Zuo in detail. I hope that Jun Zuo will approve the examination of the salt attachment that has been legally independent for ten items. The Central Government and Jun Fu have clearly designated the education of Tianyun, which is related to survival, and can be misappropriated. Now the schools are about to run out of food and are in danger. The principals of each school have held a full meeting and resolved that (1) they will present a letter to the provincial government to forward it to the commander-in-chief to strictly order each division not to directly intercept the salt and attach it to education fees, and (2) they will present a letter to the provincial government to strictly order the audit office and the salt transport bureau to comply with the above orders and allocate them monthly. 93,000 yuan will be allocated no later than the 10th of the following month, etc. The records are in the file and should be prepared in writing to earnestly request Jun Zuo to be mindful of the education students, and allow the transfer of the letter to the commander-in-chief to strictly order each division not to directly intercept the salt and attach it, and quickly strictly order the audit office and the salt transport bureau to comply with an order and allocate 93,000 yuan per month. No later than the 10th of the following month, complying with this request is imminent, and the survival of the school is at stake. The words of disclosure are extremely urgent and await orders. According to this investigation, education is the foundation of the country, and funding is the lifeblood of education. Since 53,000 yuan of the salt tax surcharge has been determined, it cannot be used for other purposes, which will hinder the progress of education. According to the above, if it is true, it should be strictly restricted to maintain education. The attached instructions and training orders to the Audit Office and the Salt Transport Bureau shall comply with them. The corresponding letter shall be sent to your department for investigation and handling. This is to say Yunyun."</p>
<h3>The Student Volunteer Army of Each School Should Intensify Training</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education通令The Education Department of each province and city shall order the Student Volunteer Army of each school to intensify training, Yuan Yunyun.</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee, with the approval of the Central Secretariat, the Nanjing Special City Executive Committee was submitted for submission. The Second District Executive Committee submitted that since the Japanese army invaded and occupied my Liaoning and Jilin for more than two months, and the troops have not been withdrawn, it can be seen that it is deliberately provoking and destroying world peace. All party, government, and military agencies in the country, in view of the increasing brutality of the Japanese, have organized a volunteer army, but they should intensify training to prepare for driving the Japanese army out of the country. The 14th plenary session of the full district party members passed a resolution to submit a request to the Central Committee to pass a resolution to the Central Committee to order the national volunteer army to intensify training and prepare to drive the Japanese army out of the country. When the meeting passed, the 理合It was recorded in the file and presented to the Jun Association for review and presentation to the Central Government for implementation. With the approval of this, in addition to replying in a letter, it is urgently ordered to comply with this order.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Inauguration of the Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff</h3>
<p>Thirty Member Representatives Elected</p>
<p>Since Zheng Hongnian, Chu Minyi, and others initiated the organization of the Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff, preparations began immediately. Two preparatory meetings were convened over a period of two weeks. The association then held its inaugural meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. The meeting passed a brief charter and elected thirty member representatives on the spot. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meeting Circumstances: Around 200 faculty and staff members from various schools arrived at the meeting successively by 10:00 AM. First, the music team of Jinan University played to commence the meeting. After the music, the master of ceremonies, Ren Qishan, shouted to mourn the compatriots in the Northeast who suffered misfortune. The members of the hall stood up unanimously and remained silent for three minutes. Then, Chairman Chu Minyi delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that today's inaugural meeting of the Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff is of extreme necessity. Although there have been many organizations among universities in Shanghai in the past, a universal, large-scale, and permanent group is still lacking. The organization of this association is suitable to this kind of need, and also embodies the meaning of a labor union. Labor unions are organizations for laborers, but intellectuals should also have such organizations to help each other, connect feelings, and be comforted both materially and spiritually. Especially in the midst of national crisis, education is the cultivation of national power, and our faculty and staff should work together. Today, all of you are joining this association. Please discuss the organization of this association in detail so that it can be healthy and complete. Next, He Tingshu reported on the preparation process, and Kang Xuanyi explained that the charter adopted a flexible constitution. Then, the charter was discussed, and representatives were elected. By this time, it was past noon. The entire body took a photograph and then took a temporary break. The ballots were counted in the afternoon until 6:00 PM, when the elected representatives were tallied. Zhang Shouyong and Hu Shuhua reported the election results and then adjourned the meeting. It was planned that the remaining recreational performances would be held later due to time constraints. It is heard that a grand recreational event will be held after the executive and supervisory committees are elected in the future.</p>
<p>Elected Representatives: A total of thirty member representatives were elected, listed below: Chu Minyi 105 votes, Wang Jingqi 91 votes, Zheng Hongnian 89 votes, Hu Shuhua 87 votes, Kang Xuanyi 79 votes, Li Yingbiao 70 votes, Li Zhaohuan 69 votes, Zhang Shouyong 68 votes, Lin Tongshi 56 votes, Li Denghui 53 votes, Lin Zhongke 51 votes, Fan Shouzhi 43 votes, Jiang Zhensan 43 votes, Chen Qifu 43 votes, Tang Ying 41 votes, He Tingshu 38 votes, Ren Qishan 38 votes, Ding Yao 38 votes, Sun Boqian 38 votes, Jing Yuanruo 37 votes, Yuan Shuibo 37 votes, Chen Qun 35 votes, Yan Fuqing 34 votes, Zhang Wenfu 32 votes, Yang Yufen 31 votes, Han Yanmen 31 votes, Hu Yaomei 29 votes, Chen Zhuzun 29 votes, Huang Xianzhang 28 votes, Deng Zhongying 37 votes. The above are the member representatives. The school representatives will be completely produced before January 5th. After the school representatives are produced, the association plans to hold a plenary meeting of all representatives at 3:00 PM on January 10th at the YMCA to elect the executive and supervisory committees.</p>
<p>Declaration of the General Assembly: Humans are social animals and cannot live in isolation. Therefore, "things gather by category, and people group by kind," and "similar sounds respond to each other, and similar spirits seek each other." Throughout history, regardless of China or foreign countries, ancient or modern times, human beings who are committed to the same cause constantly form a special organization due to the same living environment and the occurrence of spiritual communication. We, who dedicate ourselves to higher education, certainly cannot be excluded from the "universally applicable" public rules of humanity. There are numerous schools in this city, and talent is abundant, but the association is loose, like scattered sand. Past academic organizations were either limited to local areas or occurred temporarily, and were insufficient to meet universal needs or complete permanent missions. We deeply feel that this is a shortcoming and always think of ways to remedy it. This association has gathered the faculty and staff of various schools to initiate the association. All schools in the urban area, from principals to employees, are included regardless of academic faction, to gather the great achievements of thought and temper all parties in one furnace to address common problems, improve their own lives, exchange books, instruments, and equipment to make up for deficiencies, study advanced academics, discuss administrative courses, observe each other and be good, and follow the good. We will also proceed to statistically analyze talent, coordinate and cooperate, and strive to match supply and demand, allow people to use their talents to the fullest, and each get what they deserve. Other matters, such as establishing academic clubs to harmonize the lives of educators, creating educational banks to circulate academic finance, supporting educational progress, promoting Chinese culture, and restoring self-confidence, are all things that the association has planned day and night, constantly contemplating, researching, and thinking deeply, and striving to realize them. This association does not sing high-sounding tunes, make empty promises, or seek immediate results. We will take a roundabout route, be pragmatic, proceed gradually, and persevere. The great cause of culture is not the responsibility of others. All my colleagues, come!</p>
<p>Charter Passed: (1) Name: This association is named the Shanghai Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff. (2) Purpose: The purpose of this association is to connect feelings, study academics, promote culture, increase the interests of members, and cultivate national strength. (3) Membership: Anyone who is a faculty or staff member of a college or university in Shanghai can be a member of this association. (4) Meetings: The meetings of this association are divided into the following types: general meeting of members, meeting of representatives, executive committee meeting, supervisory committee meeting, and various other committee meetings. (A) The general meeting of members is held at least twice per academic year. If necessary, a special meeting may be convened upon the proposal of more than two-fifths of all members, or by the resolution of the executive committee or the meeting of representatives. (B) The meeting of representatives is held at least once a month. If necessary, a special meeting may also be convened upon the proposal of five representatives. (C) The executive committee meets once a week. (D) The supervisory committee is convened when necessary. (E) Various other meetings are determined by each committee. (5) The meeting of representatives is organized by member representatives and faculty and staff representatives from various schools. (A) Thirty member representatives are elected by the general assembly for a term of half a year and may be re-elected. (B) Each school elects faculty and staff representatives: two from each university and one from each independent college or vocational school. The term of office is one year and may be re-elected. (6) The association's executive committee has fifteen members and the supervisory committee has five members, elected by the meeting of representatives for a term of one year. (7) The executive committee may establish various specialized committees at any time and hire members to organize them. (8) The executive committee mutually elects five standing committee members to handle daily affairs. (9) The executive committee and the meeting of representatives each have two general affairs officers to manage affairs separately. (10) Membership fees are collected from each school and each member upon joining: 20 to 50 yuan per school and 1 yuan per member. Regular expenses are 20 to 50 yuan per month per school and 2 yuan per member per semester. Special donations are decided by the meeting of representatives and collected by the executive committee. (11) The association's office is located in Shanghai. (12) A quorum for various meetings of the association is more than one-half of the total number of people. (13) Matters not covered in this charter may be revised by the meeting of representatives.</p>
<p>Explanation of Entertainment: It is inappropriate for the student union of various universities to use music to celebrate the establishment of the association during the national crisis and should be warned. Yesterday, Mr. Kang of the association said to reporters that patriotism and entertainment do not conflict. In economics, there is the so-called "consumptive production," which means that production can be increased after consumption and entertainment. Music is not just for enjoyment. Songs of grief, anger, and heroism can inspire ambition, and sounds of sadness and lamentation can release sorrow. Therefore, golden horns and war drums are used to assist in battle, and stringed and bamboo instruments are used to express mourning. This cannot be discussed with a superficial view. Our patriotism can be expressed through art, and the power of art can promote our patriotic spirit. The two complement each other and are not contradictory. (Daily News)</p>

<h3>Replies from Mingqiang and Yan'an Schools Regarding the Disturbances</h3>
<p>Student Disputes Have Been Submitted to the Education Bureau for Review</p>
<p>Declaration That There Is No Interference in Student Affairs</p>
<p>Mingqiang Middle School and Yan'an's Middle School had previously forced students to leave school. The Anti-Japanese Association of Secondary Schools led representatives of middle schools throughout the city to negotiate with them. Because Principal Li Haoshan was away, it was decided to send a cadre the next day with a letter to demand that the school not interfere in student movements and other conditions. Yesterday, the association received replies from Mingqiang and Yan'an's schools, saying: "To the Shanghai Secondary School Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association, with respect, we reply that we have received your letter of the 25th of this month and have learned of its contents. The situation of the student disputes in our school has already been reported to the Director of the Education Bureau for review because our association does not know how to deal with them properly. Your letter will be forwarded to him today and will be considered together. As for the student patriotic movement, our association has investigated and found that there is no interference.

<h3>Shanghai Student Delegation Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mission Temporarily Concluded</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's Coffin Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>After the Shanghai student delegation went to Beijing, all the work had made headway. In addition to investigating the number of arrested people and negotiating for the return of the corpses, they also petitioned the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the National Government several times. They expressed serious views on domestic and foreign affairs, and the requests were published in various newspapers. More than ten students from the delegation in Peiping were handed over to the court, and representatives were sent to plead with the National Government for their release. Recently, the situation has become serious. The violent Japanese have launched a major attack on Jinzhou, so they specifically requested the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee to quickly send troops to defend it to the death, and urged the members of the Central Committee to unite sincerely and unanimously against foreign aggression. The mission of the delegation has been largely completed. Also, due to insufficient funds, they left Beijing at 7:00 AM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM.

<h3>Finance Last Week's Gold Market Stable, Rose by Thirteen Taels</h3>
<p>Fluctuations of Thirty-Four Taels in the Market on the Fourth Day. The trend of bid gold was stable and firm last week, and the volatility was still not small, with daily fluctuations of twenty taels. However, due to the Christmas holiday, there were only four market days. The lowest morning opening at the beginning of the week was only 656.5 taels. On Tuesday, it once rushed to 690 taels and five mace, and then fell back, retreating 80 taels. The entire week had a review of 34 taels. In total, it rose by 13 taels and two mace. The overseas silver market and the Shanghai British and American exchange rates have slightly fallen, such as the British exchange rate shrinking by two gears and the American exchange rate leveling off. This is because the British and American exchange rates rose first and then fell, and then rose sharply. The internal situation of the bank seemed to be tense. The gold gang had some collusion to resist the previous short positions. Most of them were arbitrage transactions, and the arbitrage price gradually narrowed to only about thirty taels. As for the settlement price, it was pressed down by forty to fifty taels. All forward transactions that had not been completed were raised to nearly thirty taels due to pressure from the multi-party. However, on Thursday, Da Fengheng and other spot dealers dropped 11 taels from the spot house. In general, the chips were limited, and the spot was also scarce. As for burning red, it added fifteen or sixteen taels. Since the telegraphic exchange rate of Datiao Bank on the 24th slightly grew by zero six two five, there was no market on the 25th and 26th due to Christmas. The details of these four days are extracted below.</p>
<p>Limited Chips, the Market Situation Is Finally Good. Since Datiao Bank returned to a length of 0625 on Monday (October 21st), 25, the silver price grew by 25, and the first order did not change. Because the US dollar was squeezed and the exchange rate was large, it grew by 375, and the domestic market was also very good. The industry scrambled to buy, and even a certain bank also bought in the second month of the bid gold opening, which was reduced by 4 taels and 8 mace, to 657 taels. Next, it was 6 taels and a half. Afterwards, the buying atmosphere was vigorous. Large households such as Wu and Lu made up for the short positions, especially since a certain bank had also started to buy, and Yufeng Yong knocked on large forward positions, which turned out to be 25 taels. The exchange rate followed closely, so the gold price went forward bravely and soared by 20 taels. At noon, it reached 77 taels and a half, and Shi closed the market at 75 taels and two mace. The afternoon market opened at 4 taels and a half, followed by 5 taels and a half, and then seemed to be frustrated. The exchange rate returned to level, and the sellers seemed to be more limited to 70 taels. By the close of the market, it was 73 taels, up 11 taels and two mace from the previous Saturday, with a difference of 21 taels throughout the day. The personnel of Datiao Bank did not change on Tuesday, the American Bank shrank by 25, the first order opened as before, and then changed to shrink a gear. The internal situation was also tight, and it seemed that cloud-based buyers were bidding. The gold market opened with an increase of 5 mace, to 73 taels and 5 mace. The next one was 1 tael and 8 mace, and then it was high. The market price was around 84, and the buyers were eager, reaching 85 taels and 5 mace. At noon, it was frustrated to 80 taels and 02 mace at the close of the market. The afternoon market opened at 77 taels and 5 mace, and then retreated to 76 taels and 6 mace due to sales by a certain Wu. Later, Mumbai reported small, and all parties were excited to buy, rising sharply and rushing out of 90 taels, reaching 90 taels and a half, to close the market at 88 taels and 5, which was another 15 taels and a half higher than the 10th. The overall market had 18 taels and 7 mace up and down. On Wednesday, Datiao Bank returned to shrink 125 to 0625, the silver price shrank 125, the first order shrank one gear, but the internal situation was loose, and it was said that the Ming and Dark trends were different and the Chinese merchants did not trade much. Most of them sold, and the bid gold opened small for two taels, at 86 taels and 5. Later, due to more purchases, the exchange market was tight and the heavy sight of 90 taels and a half was seen. Unexpectedly, a certain Wu sold his hand, and the situation became complicated. However, the potential weakness gradually dropped by more than ten taels, to 74 taels and 5 at noon, and to 75 taels and 8 mace at the close of the market. The afternoon market opened at 7 taels and a half, and then retreated to 74 taels and 5, suddenly becoming 9 taels and 8 mace. People's hearts were uncertain, and buying and selling in the market were either smooth or stagnant. By the close of the market, it was 78 taels and 5 mace, which was ten taels smaller than the 10th, with 16 taels up and down throughout the day. On Thursday, Datiao Yi shrank 375, the American Bank did not change, the first order was as before, and the US dollar added 25, which was because the exchange rate was squeezed. The gold price opened at 80 taels and a half, then rose from 82 taels and 5 mace to 71 taels. Afterwards, it floated around aimlessly. At noon, it was 89 taels, and at the close of the market, it was 87 taels and 4 mace. In the afternoon, it was 84 taels and 5, followed by 5 taels and 8 mace. Suddenly, due to the loose exchange market, the sellers were also strong, and they saw 71 taels again to close the market at 75 taels, which was also a reduction of 3 taels and 5 mace compared to the previous day. There were 18 taels of circulation throughout the day. The high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as the exchange bill bid gold, are described below.</p>

<h3>British Bank Silent, American Bank Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the settlement day. As usual, all foreign banks in China and abroad were closed. Therefore, there were no reports on financial matters or foreign exchange markets. London telegraphs and British reports on the Shanghai and Mumbai markets were silent due to the Christmas holiday. Only the New York telegraph came, and the market remained sluggish. The price of American silver remained unchanged, with spot prices at $0.30625 and private telegraphic transfers at $0.30875. Furthermore, the American exchange rate against the British pound dropped by 2.5, to $3.435, it is said.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Bond Prices Showed Drastic Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Price increases and decreases were both suspended from trading, and the results varied.</p>
<p>Trading was suspended on the weekend in preparation for settlement.</p>
<p>During the past week (from December 21st to 26th), although spot prices for various bonds on the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange were still quoted, the volume of transactions was lower than before. Over the four days, a total of 100,850 yuan worth of transactions took place, including approximately 18,000 yuan of the 20th-year Customs Salt Tax bonds, 13,000 yuan of the 19th-year Customs bonds, and 10,000 yuan each of the demobilization and reorganization 20th-year bonds. The remaining bonds each accounted for approximately 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Although the futures market was approaching settlement, trading was suspended on the weekend in preparation for the settlement of December futures. However, the minimum price limit for bonds previously set by the Ministry of Finance was lifted on Monday, and market buyers and sellers were once again free to trade. Market prices fluctuated significantly, and transaction volume increased. Market sentiment was active. The total volume of transactions was 6,780,000 yuan for each of the first two days of the week, 9,600,000 yuan on Wednesday, and nearly 12,000,000 yuan on Thursday. The total transaction volume for the four days was 25,200,050 yuan, an increase of over 3,000,000 yuan compared to the previous week. This included 2,705,000 yuan for the December Unified Tax futures, 3,090,000 yuan for the January futures, 2,530,000 yuan for the December 10th-year Customs futures, 2,835,000 yuan for the January futures, 2,020,000 yuan for the December Salt Tax futures, 2,750,000 yuan for the January futures, 1,710,000 yuan for the December 19th-year Customs futures, 1,370,000 yuan for the January futures, 1,925,000 yuan for the December 19th-year Philanthropy futures, 2,160,000 yuan for the January futures, 1,635,000 yuan for the December 20th-year bonds, 1,955,000 yuan for the January futures, 2,370,000 yuan for the December Demobilization bonds, 690,000 yuan for the January futures, 1,420,000 yuan for the December Reorganization bonds, and 105,000 yuan for the January futures. Remaining amounts included 340,000 yuan for the December Customs Tax futures, 75,000 yuan for the January futures, 615,000 yuan for the December Six Percent bonds, 110,000 yuan for the January futures, 420,000 yuan for the December 1996 Public Bonds, and 165,000 yuan for the January futures. As for the trend of public bond prices during the past week, during the first two days of the week, the minimum price limit for bonds had just been lifted, and the diplomatic situation became increasingly serious. The Japanese army was advancing on Jinzhou on a large scale, and there were widespread concerns that formal war was inevitable. In addition, there were rumors that the principal and interest of certain bonds would be postponed due to financial difficulties. As a result, market sentiment was very uneasy for a time, and the market was extremely tense. If there were problems with the principal and interest of the bonds, the financial industry would be severely affected. Therefore, the panic in the market was unprecedented since the price declines. Selling pressure was very strong, and on Monday, prices fell sharply by around 3 yuan. Trading in the current month's Unified Salt Tax futures was even suspended due to rumors. The downward trend continued on Tuesday, with further small declines of 1 to 2 yuan. On Wednesday, market sentiment was still very weak, and bond prices continued to reach new lows. However, in the afternoon, market sentiment improved slightly, and the situation improved somewhat. Buying interest was strong, and bond prices mostly rebounded. Although many bond prices fell sharply, the 19th-year Philanthropy bonds rose by nearly 2 yuan, and the 20th-year Customs and Salt Tax bonds also rebounded by several jiao. Although the situation in Northeast China remained severe on Thursday, the bond market environment had become more optimistic. The previous rumors of postponed payments of bond principal and interest proved to be untrue, and the principal and interest of bonds due this month had been paid. Market sentiment was greatly relieved, and buying interest was very strong. For a time, the market became a short squeeze, and prices rose sharply. Eight bonds were suspended from trading after rising to the limit price, and many others rose by around 3 yuan. However, the results were mixed. The 19th-year Philanthropy, Six Percent bonds, and Reorganization bonds rose slightly, while the others fell slightly. Judging from the bond market situation, it is not yet permissible to be optimistic. How to encourage investment and bring about a better future is the responsibility of both the government and the financial industry. The current situation is still very concerning, it is said. The following table shows the highest and lowest prices and price fluctuations of various bonds over the past four days. (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<h3>Last Week's Yarn Sales: Sichuan Merchants Exclusively Prosperous</h3>
<p>Negotiated transactions were bleak.</p>
<p>The yarn market weakened during the past week, mainly due to the country's multiple difficulties. The Japanese army's harassment in Jinzhou intensified daily, Sino-Japanese relations became increasingly precarious, financial conditions tightened daily, and market sentiment became more panicked. As a result, the market became sluggish and depressed. Nowadays, there is an increasing number of Japanese yarns changing brands and being packaged in foreign locations, which has dealt a major blow to the sales of domestic yarns. However, Sichuan merchants still have a strong interest in domestic yarns, and because their inventories in Sichuan are low, they are very interested in making large-scale purchases. Unfortunately, tight credit conditions and the lack of external trade in Sichuan have prevented them from doing so as desired. Nevertheless, they have purchased approximately 12,000 bales of domestic yarn in total. Other merchants have rarely taken action. The inactivity in negotiated transactions is due to the chaotic situation and the approaching end of the year, as businesses prepare to close and are unable to act freely. The selling prices of current yarns are also declining daily, it is said. The following is a comparative table of the highest and lowest prices of negotiated yarn for each month:</p>
<p>| Negotiated | Highest | Lowest | Weekend Price | Compared to Previous Week |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| December | 153.00 | 149.00 | 150.00 | Down 3.00 |</p>
<p>| January | 152.80 | 151.00 | 151.00 | Down 0.20 |</p>
<p>| February | 152.90 | 151.80 | 152.90 | Up 0.60 |</p>
<p>| March | 153.90 | 152.70 | 153.90 | Up 0.70 |</p>
<p>| April | 154.00 | 153.00 | 154.00 | Up 0.70 |</p>
<p>| May | 154.20 | 153.00 | 154.00 | Up 0.70 |</p>
<h3>Last Week's Cotton Market Tight</h3>
<p>The majority's attitude did not soften.</p>
<p>Factory demand remained unmoved.</p>
<p>The cotton market was quite soft at the beginning of the week due to the sluggishness of the foreign cotton market. The combined price of American cotton was between 25 and 28 taels. All factories were stocked full of foreign cotton, and there was no need for domestic cotton. Therefore, although the supply of domestic cotton was low, factory demand stagnated. In addition, shipments from the Hankou route were increasing. Everyone agreed that the market was weak, but the majority of merchants and those from Hankou had very small stakes and were keen on going long, so they did not soften their stance. The last day of this month was the settlement date. Merchants from Ningbo were receiving goods and settling Yao flower contracts, which caused the standard market price to suddenly rise by 5 qian. Forward contracts were also pulled up. As a result, the prices for each month were up 5 qian for the near month and 1 to 2 qian for the distant months compared to the previous week. The price of American cotton rose by 20 pounds, it is said. The following is a comparative table of the highest and lowest prices of Hankou cotton for each month:</p>

<h3>Grain Market Rice Prices on the Lower Reaches of the River Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>Southern cargo: Yesterday, about 20 boats carrying goods from Changzhou, Wuxi, Xianzi, and other regions arrived. Merchants refused to sell unless prices increased. Furthermore, prices in production areas such as Songjiang and Qingpu were 30 to 40 jiao lower than prices in Shanghai. Dealers took advantage of favorable weather conditions and increased activity. Thick new japonica rice and early and late indica rice prices increased by nearly a jiao. Rice affected by rain had a weak market and prices softened slightly.</p>
<p>New Gate: Not many ships arrived. West Road white japonica rice was actively sold in the city market, and prices increased by about a jiao. Merchants from rural villages purchased 2,000 bales of thin early indica rice, and prices increased by 2 to 3 jiao. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian rice were firm. There were few arrivals of rain-affected glutinous rice, and sales to cake shops were active. The market trend was mediocre.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>Hechi (Dutch raw sugar) quotations opened up five fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from sugar production areas due to the weekend. There were few transactions on the association's market quotations. Number 24 Dutch sugar was in short supply and was quoted at a surprisingly high price. Initially, there was some resistance, but buyers were quite active. The opening transaction price was 9 taels and 6 qian and a half. Sellers continued to raise prices, and later it rose to 9 taels and 7 qian. The market trend stabilized somewhat. Mian He (soft Dutch sugar) was at 11 taels and 3 qian, Number 20 medium white sugar was at 9 taels and 6 qian, Number 8 Hechi was at 8 taels and 3 qian and a half, and Number 9 rose to 8 taels and 6 qian. The market trend was strong. Transactions of Taikoo sugar were more sluggish. B Mark was at 11 taels 7 qian and a half to 7 fen and a half, and HX Mark was at 11 taels and 5 qian and a half. The trend was stable. The quotation from Hua Xin was that PN Mark Hechi current goods were sold for several hundred bags at a price of 8 taels and 6 qian per yuan, which was an increase of 5 fen compared to the previous quotation, and the market sentiment was strong, with a large trend of gradual price increases, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Thin Galvanized Iron Sheet Sales Flowing Smoothly</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of thin English galvanized iron sheets has been very abundant, and there is a concern about the market being overstocked. However, sales have been extremely smooth in recent days. Merchants from the Yangtze River region are buying as much as possible, and merchants from inland regions are also actively purchasing. Merchants from Fuzhou, Longkou, Tianjin, and other regions are also inquiring. Therefore, in this sluggish market, it can be said that it is unique in terms of transaction volume. As a result, the standard price has been maintained and has not fallen. The current market price is 1 tael and 4 qian per sheet for 7 feet and 1 tael and 1 qian and a half per sheet for 6 feet. Although yesterday was Sunday, there were still as many as 7,000 to 8,000 sheets transacted. Considering the recent optimistic sentiment, it is feared that the standard price will not fall in the future, it is said.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke and Others Accompanied Guangdong Committee Members to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>However, Wang Jingwei and Zhang Fakui remained in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Central Committee members Sun Ke and Li Wenfan, who had a dispute at the second meeting of the Fourth Central Committee, withdrew from the meeting and came to Shanghai. The conference sent representatives Jiang Zuobin, Chen Mingshu, and Zou Lu to Shanghai one after another to explain and persuade them. Sun and others agreed to enter Beijing the night before. However, Sun intended to travel with Wang Jingwei. Therefore, before leaving yesterday, he went to the hospital with Zou Lu and Chen Mingshu at 10:30 a.m. to meet Wang and strongly urged him to accompany them. Wang immediately agreed to go to Beijing within the next few days. Sun and others then returned to Beijing with Guangdong Committee members Li Jishen and Li Zongren at 3:30 p.m. to attend the Central Committee meeting. Yesterday, Li Jishen expressed his opinion to the Central Committee, advocating for the expansion of civil rights, the reorganization of people's organizations, and the addition of elected members to the Supervisory and Legislative Yuan. The following is a record of the various news obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>Sun and others urge Wang: Chen Mingshu and Zou Lu arrived in Shanghai the night before and visited Sun Ke around 9:00 p.m. with a joint letter from Lin Sen and others.

Therefore, Chen and Zou visited Sun again around 10:00 a.m. yesterday and then took Sun's car to the hospital at 10:30 a.m. to urge Wang. Wang, who was still recovering from his illness, did not agree to go with them but promised to go to Beijing within two or three days. Sun and others then returned to their residence at 11:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Accompanied Guangdong Committee members to Beijing: Since Wang would postpone his trip to Beijing, Sun and Li Wenfan decided to travel to the capital first at 3:15 p.m. with Guangdong Committee members Li Jishen and others. Upon hearing this, the Railway Bureau specially prepared a train with two decorated cars for the committee members to ride in. Around 3:10 p.m., Sun and others sent Jian Youwen in the car first.

<h3>Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji Takes Office Today</h3>

<p>The new Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji is scheduled to take office today. Yesterday, the department was operating as usual. All official documents and files were checked and transferred by Chief of Staff Xu Jinyuan and Adjutant General Jiang Yi.

<h3>The County Party Committee Issued Two Telegrams Yesterday</h3>
<p>Eliminate prejudices and jointly resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Committee sent two telegrams to the Fourth Central Committee yesterday, one requesting that military officers be prevented from leaving their posts on the grounds of illness, and the other requesting the elimination of prejudices and joint resistance against foreign aggression. The original telegrams are recorded below. The first one: (Omitted above) Since the violent Japanese army occupied the Northeast and invaded the three provinces, we have felt that they are stronger and more barbaric than bandits. However, they still feel that their policies are too weak, so they have reorganized the cabinet and formed a cabinet under Inukai Tsuyoshi, the president of the Seiyukai, to implement the Tanaka Doctrine and implement a strong foreign policy. The attack on Jinzhou has become a reality, and the defenses in Guanzhong are urgent. At this time, it is appropriate to send more troops to defend the area in order to preserve the remaining territory and plan to recover the lost three provinces. However, it is reported that Rong Zhen has left Jinzhou on the grounds of illness and gone to Ping for medical treatment, treating national defense as a game and placing military duties outside of his concerns, going against the tide and not knowing what his conscience is. Currently, there is no one sitting in Jinzhou, and the defenses are empty. Once the Japanese attack, Jinzhou may fall again. Therefore, we especially telegraph to your committee to stop him as soon as possible, and quickly send troops to defend Jinzhou to resist foreign aggression. The people of the country are anxiously awaiting orders. The second one: (Omitted above) At this time, the invaders are getting deeper and deeper, and national destruction is imminent. All of us comrades should abandon prejudices and unite as one. There is no need to talk about political systems. We should immediately plan the major strategy of resisting foreign aggression. However, since September 18th, the country has been in turmoil for several months, and no one knows what to do. There have been disputes at the Shanghai meeting and competition in the elections. Fortunately, the Central Committee meeting has opened, and we can unite to deal with Japan. However, news has come that some members of the Central Committee have been absent due to illness and others have walked out in anger. The country is in difficulty, and there are many things to manage. Those who bear the responsibility of party affairs should be humble, tolerant, and willing to do their best to realize their responsibilities and overcome the difficulties of the country and turn danger into safety. They must not be willful and disregard the current crisis, which will only make the future of the nation more and more devastated. This committee is compelled to send this telegram in desperation, hoping to make a final struggle to support this dangerous situation. All members of the Central Committee should gather in the capital and not take independent action until a solution is reached. We are anxiously awaiting this.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Overseas Chinese from British and Dutch Colonies in Southeast Asia Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Request the government to send troops to recover the lost territories as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese National Salvation General Association of British and Dutch Colonies in Southeast Asia previously sent a telegram to Huang Jundu, a member of the Guangdong Military and Political Training Committee, as its general representative to come to Shanghai and then to Beijing to petition the government. Huang has many friendly relations with the Central Committee members and expects that there will be considerable results at that time. It is reported that after Huang arrives in Shanghai, he plans to first organize a joint office in Shanghai for the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association of British and Dutch Colonies in Southeast Asia and appoint Lin Jingxian, the former secretary of the Fourth Army Group Headquarters, as the director of the office, it is said.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Determined to Attack Jinzhou</h3>
<p>News of the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou is becoming increasingly tense. Although the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have issued warnings to Japan, it is reported by those close to Japanese military personnel that the Japanese government is determined to attack Jinzhou, and it is inevitable. The attacking force consists of the First Division, originally stationed in Tokyo, and the Eighteenth Division, originally stationed in Korea, totaling approximately 20,000 men. They are ready to launch the attack. The original plan was to occupy Jinzhou by the end of this year, but now the aim is to occupy Jinzhou by early January of next year. A major war seems unavoidable. However, according to a certain diplomat, the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou still depends on the attitude of the United States. The previous sudden order from the Japanese Emperor to withdraw troops from the attack on Jinzhou was indeed due to a statement by US Secretary of State Stimson. Therefore, if the United States expresses a strong stance in the future, the Japanese government may have some concerns.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines to Hold Large-Scale Exercises</h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the Japanese army in Liaoshen attacking Jinzhou, the Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai will hold a demonstration. Yesterday, Rear Admiral Shiozawa, commander of the unit, notified all Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai to hold joint naval exercises, scheduled for January 4 at the Japanese New Park in Hongkou.</p>
<h3>Son of Japanese Ambassador to France Yoshizawa Kenkichi Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Japan's Telecommunication Expenses to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Exceed 100,000 Yen</p>
<p>Yoshizawa Kenkichi, the Japanese ambassador to France who was newly appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs, will soon return to Japan from Europe to take office. He first sent his son, Yoshizawa Hideo, back to Japan from France. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Japanese ship Akikuni Maru. The Japanese Deputy Consul stationed in Shanghai, Mr. Iguchi, boarded the ship to greet him. According to Yoshizawa Hideo, the reason Japan was able to achieve victory in the League of Nations on the Manchurian issue was entirely due to effective propaganda. Because of the Manchurian issue, the cost of telecommunications used by the Japanese Embassy in France totaled over 100,000 yen. The French telegraph office gained a huge revenue from the Manchurian issue. His father, Yoshizawa Kenkichi, had lost several pounds due to the busyness of attending the League of Nations meeting. The Japanese spare no expense on international affairs, so our country's envoys cannot compete with them on the world stage.</p>
<h3>Publication of Japanese Trademark Compilations</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Associations Everywhere Are Buying for Reference</p>
<p>Since the publication of the "Japanese Trademark Compilation" compiled by the International Commercial Research Institute, it is like having a demon-revealing mirror. No matter how many types of Japanese goods there are, once they are compared, there is no escape. Therefore, anti-Japanese associations everywhere are sending letters to purchase it. The Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee and other places have even issued orders to their subordinates to purchase it for reference. It is reported that the book is also distributed by the publishing department of the Xinsheng News Agency in the Dadongfang of Shilu, Hankou Road, Shanghai. The Commercial Press and the Dadong Bookstore also have consigned sales. The entire book is divided into sixty-five categories, containing 1,200 copperplate trademarks and 3,000 names, totaling 396 pages. Each copy of the paper print costs only 1.50 yuan, plus one yuan for postage for out-of-town purchases. In addition, the society has recently published several new books that are essential reading for anti-Japanese efforts. The main points are excerpted below for the attention of patriotic people:</p>
<p>* "Translated Summary of the Secret Meeting Record on the So-Called Protection of Manchurian and Mongolian Rights by Japanese Imperialism," send a letter with 3 cents for postage per copy, reprint 2 yuan per 100 copies plus postage.</p>
<p>* "The So-Called Pending Issues of One-Sided Reasons from the Japanese Side," send a letter with 4 cents for postage per copy, reprint 3 yuan per 100 copies plus postage.</p>
<p>* "The Active Policy of the Japanese Tanaka Cabinet to Invade Manchuria and Mongolia," send a letter with 5 cents for postage per copy, reprint 4 yuan per 100 copies plus postage.</p>
<p>* "A Chronology of Major Events in Japan's Aggression Against China" by Qiu Peihao, 10 cents per copy plus postage.</p>
<p>* "From Liaoning to Japan" by Pan Yangyao, 60 cents per copy plus postage.</p>
<p>However, if you want to add words to the cover when reprinting the above books, you must start with a minimum of 1,000 copies. For purchases from abroad, the postage must be increased fivefold.</p>
<h3>Continued Solicitation of Donations by the Flood Relief Emergency Committee</h3>
<p>Striving to Achieve the Goal of Thorough Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Flood Relief Emergency Committee of Various Provinces sends a circular to leaders from all walks of life: According to reports and telegrams from disaster relief committee members and organizations in the disaster-stricken provinces, after this major disaster, the fields and homes of the victims have been completely destroyed. Even if the flood recedes, they will still be without clothing or food. With the arrival of severe winter, wind and snow will encroach upon them. Those of us who share flesh and blood with them are suffering the pangs of hunger and cold. If we do not promptly raise relief funds, there will be virtually no survivors. These situations have been reported to the association, and the Standing Committee has resolved to end the emergency relief and continue raising winter relief funds to achieve the goal of thorough disaster relief. Unexpectedly, the tyrannical actions of Japan have distressed the people and concerned the nation. The public is planning to resist the invaders, resulting in a sharp decline in the number of donations received by the association. We lack the skill to turn base metal into gold, and it is difficult to cook without rice. It seems that the disaster victims who have already been rescued will inevitably fill the ditches again, making the association's relief efforts unfinished and incomplete. This is something that the donors could not have foreseen, nor is it something that the executive committee members can remain unheard of. Please, directors, broadly solicit donations, or continue to contribute. To carry through the original intention is to avert the great catastrophe.</p>
<h3>Record of the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Large Shipment of Cotton Clothes Transported to Hankou</p>
<p>The Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai's Emergency Relief Committee for Flood Disaster in Hubei Province held a committee meeting yesterday at its association office on Nan Wuxi Road. Du Xiangqing, Gao Jianqing, Li Yaoqin, Fan Wenhua, Sun Songnian, Lu Xingjie, Wang Hengqing, and over twenty others attended. Gao Jianqing was publicly elected as chairman. They reported a letter from the Hubei Flood Disaster Rehabilitation Committee and that there was still over 11,000 yuan remaining in the Shanghai Bank from the collected donations. Then, they discussed the proposed resolutions: (1) How should the relief funds currently in the bank be allocated? The majority believed that since the severe winter is approaching and the victims have no way to keep warm, and the price of cloth in Hankou is expensive, it would be better to entrust the Lianyi Charity Association to make 3,600 sets of men's and women's cotton clothes at 2.50 yuan per set, which was unanimously agreed upon. Du Xiangqing was instructed to contact the Lianyi Charity Association, and he immediately returned to report that it had been settled, and the association had also donated another 500 sets of cotton clothes. (2) How should the cotton clothes be packaged and transported after they are made? Resolved: A letter should be sent to the National Government's Flood Disaster Relief Committee, requesting them to ask the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation to issue free transportation and tax-exempt passports. Liu [...], Chen and Peng Chunfang were appointed to supervise the packaging. (3) Can this association be concluded within the year? Resolved: Continue to urge the collection of donation ledgers. In any case, conclude it within the year. (4) Should the donors who have not been reported in the newspaper be supplemented? Resolved: When it is concluded, they will all be supplemented, and a credit record will be compiled and distributed for reporting. The meeting was adjourned. The association then received a reply letter from the National Government's Flood Disaster Relief Committee, stating: We have received your letter stating that you have raised 4,100 new winter clothes, totaling 102 packages, and plan to transport them to Hubei for distribution.

<h3>Defense of the Fujian Aviation Patriotic Association</h3>
<p>Refuting Rumors of Purchasing Aircraft and Transporting Soil</p>
<p>The Minnan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai received a telegram from the Fujian Aviation Patriotic Association yesterday (abridged title): A few months ago, Fujian fellow-provincials in Shanghai, based on reports from an unknown source, telegraphed the provincial government, requesting attention to the prohibition of Minnan soldiers from purchasing aircraft and transporting soil, etc. At that time, the association considered the wording to be (unclear code) and did not investigate who was being accused. Therefore, we just laughed it off and did not respond. Unexpectedly, recently we read in the newspaper that the rumors of purchasing aircraft and transporting soil are rampant. Fujian representatives Zheng Luosheng and others have proposed it to the Fourth National Congress, and the China Anti-Drug General Association has also listed it as an important agenda item, resolving to petition the government to severely investigate. For a time, fallacies spread, all alluding to this association. If this association remains silent and does not correct it, not only will the aviation effort fail, but the arguments will cause universal discouragement, which is enough to trap the country in a state of eternal destruction. At the beginning of this association's establishment, it clearly stated in Article 2 of its charter that this association uses civilian-run aviation power to prepare for the government's requisition of red eradication and national defense and is subject to the command and supervision of the central aviation supreme authority and local military authorities. Military actions should only handle matters, but not for any internal struggles. Since internal struggles are not provided, how can we provide people to transport soil? Furthermore, based on facts, let us assume that there is opium in Fujian, and it is planted everywhere. Then, those who force planting only need to levy taxes, so why purchase aircraft for transportation? Let us also assume that there is soil in Fujian, which is readily available. Then, the prohibition of opium is already very public, so there are many tools for transporting soil, such as the frequent occurrence of large-scale smuggling of opium cases in major trading ports, which is one example. Why use airplanes, which have a small capacity and many dangers? Let us further assume that aircraft can transport soil, but where will it be transported? May I ask whether it is possible for a foreign aircraft to fly and park arbitrarily in neighboring territories with different defense zones and neighboring countries with different nationalities? In short, planting opium is one thing, and aviation is another. The former has someone who can defend it, so this association does not need to overstep its bounds and speak for them. As for the latter, for the sake of following the late premier's teachings and for the sake of the reputation of aviation, this association dares to guarantee with the personality of all its members that such an unfilial act will not occur. If it does, we will willingly accept the extreme penalty and will not escape. It must be known that under the heavy oppression of foreign aggression and internal troubles, the cause of saving the country is not limited to aviation, but aviation is indeed the most important tool for saving the country. Since its establishment, this association has worked tirelessly and vigorously, and after many difficulties, it has achieved today's results. The ordered aircraft will arrive soon, and the facts will prove that the date is not far away. The gentlemen who made the proposal may as well wait a little longer before making a judgment. As for those who do not save the country considering those who save the country to be meddlesome, and empty talkers considering those who seek truth from facts to have hidden motives, they do not hesitate to fabricate evidence and conduct counter-propaganda, which only pleases the enemy and hurts our loved ones, cutting themselves off from the country without harming this association in the slightest. The members of this association will only strengthen their sincerity in carrying out the late premier's aviation teachings and, under the supervision and guidance of the military authorities, ensure that the Fujian Air Force emerges from itself and makes the most Zhou's application of pressure to the enemy. The impassioned words, I hope you will understand. The Fujian Aviation Patriotic Association kowtows.</p>

<h3>British-Owned Public Bus Company Dismisses All Workers</h3>
<p>Forced Operation with Police Protection Today</p>
<p>Company Prepares to Hire New Ticket Sellers</p>
<p>After the British-owned public bus workers went on strike due to work slowdowns, the company announced a deadline for the workers to return to work. As of yesterday, none had reported. The company immediately announced the dismissal of all workers and decided to operate routes 1, 9, and special express buses with police protection today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strike Situation: After all ticket sellers of the British-owned public bus company went on strike, public buses on routes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and special express cars AC were ordered to stop completely to avoid accidents. The general passengers felt very inconvenient. As for the striking workers, they gathered in the open space near the Jiaozhou Road racetrack yesterday morning to discuss countermeasures. It was reported that the result was a decision to use force to deal with those who violated strike discipline.</p>
<p>Dismissal of All: The company announced the day before yesterday, ordering all ticket sellers to report to the company for service yesterday, otherwise their jobs would be terminated, and they should return their uniforms and other items and collect their wages. As of yesterday from 5:00 AM to 6:00 PM, none of the 280+ ticket sellers reported. The manager then notified the writing room staff to settle the wages of all ticket sellers, announced the dismissal of all, and prepared to hire new workers. As for all drivers, ticket checkers, ticket writers, small workers, inspectors, etc., they did not join the ticket sellers' strike and still went to the company for service every morning and were scheduled as usual. However, because there was no one to sell tickets, they had no choice but to sign in and then leave. Wages were still paid by the company.</p>
<p>Company Losses: After all ticket sellers went on strike, the company had no choice but to stop the public buses on each route. It is reported that the daily loss due to the strike is about 4,000 yuan. As for the loss of wages for the striking ticket sellers, it is about 200+ yuan per day.</p>
<p>Protected Operation: To maintain traffic, the company agreed with the police station yesterday on measures to protect the operation of buses. The company decided to operate 14 buses on Route 1, from Jing'an Temple to Laobaizi Road, driven by Russians, with Chinese and Koreans checking tickets and acting as ticket sellers. Route 9 would have 20 buses, from Jing'an Temple to Tilanqiao, driven by Chinese, with Koreans checking tickets and Chinese checking tickets and writing tickets, acting as ticket sellers. Special express car A would have 3 buses, and special express car C would have 2 buses, driven by Chinese, with Western plainclothes ticket checkers acting as ticket sellers. The police station will devise ways to provide armed protection.</p>
<h3>Japanese in Pudong Rihua Yarn Factory Refuse to Resume Work</h3>
<p>Continued Unjustified Dismissal of 30 Workers</p>
<p>Arrested Female Workers Released by Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese Use Marines to Intimidate Workers</p>
<p>After all the female workers in the cloth machine room of the Pudong Rihua Yarn Factory could not bear the oppression of the Japanese and went on strike, the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau tried to persuade them to resume work. After a general meeting, it was resolved to obey the order with pain and resume work yesterday morning, but they were rejected by the Japanese, who used the Marines to intimidate the workers. They also continued to dismiss a large number of 40+ workers. Public sentiment was indignant, and the situation became serious again. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>General Meeting: At 5:00 PM on the 26th, the Rihua Branch Office of the Fifth District Cotton Spinning Workers' Union held a general meeting of all workers in the cloth machine room. Zheng Xiechen was publicly elected as chairman, and Sun Xiaoru recorded the minutes. The chairman reported on the Japanese capitalists' oppression of workers. Then, the discussion began and resolved: (1) The issue of workers resuming work. Resolved: To comply with the order, we will reluctantly enter the factory to resume work tomorrow. (2) If the Japanese resist the order and illegally refuse to resume work, all will vow to fight the Japanese capitalists to the end. (3) The case of Ni Jinxiu and Lu Xiaomei being falsely accused for no reason. Resolved: File a lawsuit with the court according to law. (4) The case of punishing the running dogs Hu Azhen and Zhang Fuying. Resolved: Permanently refuse to enter the factory. (5) If the factory increases work, deducts wages, and dismisses workers, we should unanimously refuse. Resolved: Passed. (6) Request the factory to give compensation for losses and retirement benefits. Resolved: In accordance with the Nanyang Tobacco Factory method, each person will receive a subsidy of six months. It did not end until 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Refusal to Resume Work: All workers in the cloth machine room, in order to comply with the order, reluctantly entered the factory to resume work at 5:00 AM yesterday. The Japanese capitalists used a poisonous scheme, colluding with a few running dogs and Japanese thugs, to forcibly refuse them to enter the factory at the factory gate. As a result, more than 400 workers gathered in front of the factory gate until about 6:00 AM and had no choice but to return to the labor union to report the truth. The labor union immediately petitioned the party and government authorities to severely punish the Japanese who oppressed the workers.</p>
<p>Continued Oppression: After the Japanese refused all workers to resume work, they believed that Chinese workers could be deceived and resumed oppressive measures. Yesterday morning, they posted a notice at the factory gate, stating that Jiang Guiyuan and 30 other loyal old workers who had worked for many years would also be required to leave the workshop within ten days. Together with the previous cloth machine room, there were a total of 41 people, and other departments were not included. As for the 3,000+ workers in each department, they were also indignant due to the excessive oppression by the Japanese. They expressed deep sympathy for the cloth machine room and decided to assist them with their strength.</p>
<p>Release of Female Workers: After the female worker foreman Hu Azhen and the female worker Zhang Fuying, who colluded with the Japanese to act as accomplices, were beaten by all the female workers, they falsely reported to the police station, causing Lu Xiaomei, Ni Jinxiu, and other four people who had been wrongfully detained to be transferred to the local court. All workers petitioned, and Bao Cuidi and Cai Fuzhen, who had been innocently arrested, were released. Since the female worker foreman was not injured, Lu Xiaomei, Ni Jinxiu, and other two people were also released yesterday.</p>
<p>Intimidating Workers: Since the Rihua Yarn Factory was boycotted by our country, sales have stalled, and inventory has piled up, putting it in an unsustainable position. Therefore, it adopted an oppressive policy to take the opportunity to dismiss workers and not provide retirement benefits. This time, the workers could not bear the oppression and went on strike. The Japanese believed that their goal had been achieved. Now, seeing the workers resume work, they refused them and used the Japanese Marines to land and intimidate the resuming workers.</p>
<h3>Another Yong'an Yarn Factory Labor Committee Member Arrested</h3>
<p>Party Department and Labor Union Issue Declaration of Assistance</p>

Yesterday afternoon, the First Precinct of the Seventh Public Security District, acting on orders, arrested Jin Yaowen, an executive committee member of the factory's labor union, on Songxing Road and sent him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Yesterday, the party department and labor union issued declarations of assistance, including the Third Sub-branch of the Eighth District, the Water and Wood Industry Workers' Union of the Eighth District, and the Cotton Spinning Industry Workers' Union of the Eighth District. The wording was extremely indignant.</p>

<h3>The Anti-Opium Society Bitterly Condemns the Failure to Enforce Opium Prohibition</h3>
<p>Presents Nine Measures to the Central Conference</p>
<p>Advocating the Strict Enforcement of Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>In recent years, the scourge of opium has spread throughout the country, causing internal strife and planting the seeds of poverty and weakness, leading to widespread suffering and frequent foreign invasions. Tracing the root cause, this drug is the most severe culprit. In the 17th year of the Republic, the central government, upholding the teachings of the late Premier and responding to the demands of the people, revoked the powers of the Ministry of Finance and other departments to regulate opium prohibition, and established the Opium Prohibition Committee to handle the matter exclusively, demonstrating its intention to start anew with the people. However, regrettably, the government has neither the resolute determination to completely eradicate it nor the vigorous spirit to carry it out. Chen Tiaoyuan transported soil with justification, and his obstinacy went unpunished. Yang Shuzhuang was accused of smuggling, and Zhu Yu was sent to investigate. As a result, local officials regarded the prohibition laws as mere formalities and treated the decrees as straw dogs. When the Jiang'an soil case occurred in Shanghai, the military and police accused each other, revealing the truth. The people clearly understood who was responsible for transporting the soil and who was shielding the culprits. Unexpectedly, the central government's investigation resulted in the demotion of those investigating opium and the promotion of those shielding the soil. Such a reversal of right and wrong is astonishing. If there were no collusion between those above and below, how could such a phenomenon occur? The prohibition laws strictly prohibit the sale of soil and the levying of taxes, yet the Ministry of Finance openly established the Two Lakes Special Tax Bureau in Wuhan. The central government issued an order strictly prohibiting the cultivation of opium seedlings, yet the authorities in Anhui and Fujian forced the people to grow opium more severely than before. The people's appeals went unanswered. Recently, they have become even more brazen and are acting perversely. Those in charge are all central government officials, such as Chen Tiaoyuan and Hao Yuhua in Anhui, and Fang Shengtao, Zhang Zhen, Chen Guohui, and He Xianqi in Fujian. Their crimes are numerous, and public opinion is in an uproar, yet the central government has not shown any reaction. Furthermore, Fang Shengtao, the chief culprit in the opium cultivation in Fujian, was recently honored with the position of Central Committee member. The dignity of the party and the nation has been swept away. Such phenomena are intolerable to both party discipline and national law. If there is no change in course, the people of the whole country will not need the guns of the enemy; they will die under the policy of raising money by promoting drugs. At this critical moment, we must seek fundamental improvements in opium prohibition. Those who are concerned about the opium disaster in our country know that opium merchants, soil peddlers, hooligans, and ignorant people only create the fruit, while government officials and the army and navy in various places create the cause. Opium merchants and soil peddlers can only engage in small-scale drug trafficking, while military officers and officials, like tigers in a corner, blatantly engage in large-scale drug promotion plans that are hundreds or thousands of times larger. If we want to bring them to justice, they control the law. Therefore, officials and military officers who promote drugs for their own benefit are more guilty than soil peddlers and opium merchants. Expecting them to enforce opium prohibition is like asking a tiger for its skin. It is known that it is impossible. Therefore, in the future, attention should be paid to the selection and organization of personnel in opium prohibition agencies, and improvements should be made to ensure satisfactory results. Our association, with its responsibility for opposing drugs, has a clearer understanding and more accurate knowledge. Based on years of research, we present nine proposals for opium prohibition, hoping that the committee members of the conference will consider the difficulties of the party and the nation, the root causes of poverty and weakness, and accept and implement our proposals in full to eliminate this scourge, plan for prosperity for centuries, and save the country from collapse. Our association dares to represent the four hundred million people and sincerely pray. (1) For opium prohibition, the principle of Premier Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug teachings, the provisions of the Kuomintang's party platform, and the unanimous demands of the people of the whole country should be upheld, and a policy of complete prohibition should be adopted, never to be changed. (2) Any form of opium monopoly and any method of using opium as tax revenue should be absolutely prohibited. Speech advocating opium monopoly should also be banned, and those who violate party discipline should be punished. (3) The special opium tax in the two lakes and Anhui, the public sale of opium paste in the two Guangdong provinces, and the planting of opium seedlings in Fujian, Anhui, and the northwest and southwest provinces, as well as the protection of private smuggling by the army and navy along the coast, are all open secrets that cannot be concealed. The transportation of soil by plane in Fujian is known far and wide, and the facts are all there. An immediate investigation of the responsible officials should be requested to maintain the prohibition laws. (4) The opium businesses in the concessions and leased territories, where unscrupulous foreigners use extraterritorial rights and consular jurisdiction to profit from drugs, as well as the prevalence of narcotics, should be studied by experts to find effective methods of prohibition. (5) The harm of opium and narcotics is extremely complex in various places. The relevant departments of the government should, together with people's organizations, form an investigation committee to conduct on-the-spot investigations using scientific methods to clarify the truth and establish the standards for prohibition. (6) The government should provide as much support and protection as possible for the people's anti-drug movement, such as eradicating opium seedlings, providing smoking cessation services, and conducting anti-drug education and publicity. It must also cooperate with the people's anti-drug organizations. Local party and government agencies that undermine the anti-drug movement should be punished. (7) The government should recognize opium prohibition as a major task for national salvation, and order officials at all levels to implement it strictly. All civil servants related to opium prohibition, such as county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs, should first join anti-drug organizations and swear to oppose drugs for life, demonstrating their determination to prohibit opium and facilitating public supervision. (8) The income from opium prohibition fines from judicial and public security agencies nationwide should be used to fund anti-drug education, publicity, and smoking cessation services, and should be jointly managed with people's organizations in accordance with Article 6 to achieve practical results. (9) The government should pay attention to the organization and personnel selection of opium prohibition agencies, prevent those who promote public sales and corruption from entering, maintain the strictness of the prohibition laws, and hold opium prohibition meetings regularly to receive public opinions.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Rice Federation Held a Meeting of the Executive, Supervisory, and Standing Committees</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ningbo-Shanghai Municipal and County Rice Industry Association held its seventh meeting of the executive, supervisory, and standing committees at the Cuixiutang yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The committee members present were Ye Huijun, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Qiang Zisheng, Fu Qiangeng, Zhao Zixin (represented by Shen Zhenzhong), Zhang Jingzhai, Cai Yukun, Chen Junyu, Li Zhongchen, Lu Zhuqing, Zhu Zhaoqi, and Zhu Yin Zheng, totaling thirteen people. Chairman Ye left early due to frequent engagements and was temporarily replaced by committee member Zhu Zixiang. The meeting proceeded as usual. The chairman reported that standing committee member Zhao Zixin had requested leave due to business, so Mr. Shen Zhenzhong was commissioned to attend as a representative. The association's account for the year 20 had been closed, with a surplus of 1,321.23 yuan, and requested a review. The meeting then discussed: (1) Letters from the Zhenjiang and local rice industry associations stating that imports of foreign rice and wheat are increasing daily, prices are falling, hindering the livelihood of farmers and affecting the future of the rice industry. A proposal to discuss this issue was resolved to request the authorities to pay attention; (2) The association's appointed year-round legal counsel, Lawyer Qu Shaoyi, had completed his term and had been reappointed, and a proposal to ratify this was resolved and passed; (3) The meeting date for the association's eighth standing committee meeting coincided with the end of the year for closing accounts, and a proposal on whether to postpone the meeting was resolved to approve the postponement until February, and then to convene the meeting.</p>
<h3>Shareholders of the Tongsheng Money Exchange Accuse the Manager of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>After the Tongsheng Money Exchange in this city closed on May 24th last year, a lawyer was appointed to liquidate the assets. Recently, shareholders Yang Jinrong, Yang Zhonghe, Yao Weiyong, and Zhang Xingchu discovered that the manager Zhang Chunlai had embezzled funds, and they hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Yuan Hanyun to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special Court. The indictment stated that after Tongsheng's closure, Hu Yongde was entrusted to handle the liquidation and to publish advertisements to collect debts, but Hu Yongde's measures were improper and he did not report the defendant's fraud, resulting in no progress after several months of liquidation. The shareholders discovered the irregularities and managed to terminate the previous contract and hire another lawyer to liquidate the assets. Upon reviewing Tongsheng's books from the 19th year and the general ledger, it was discovered that Hu Yongde had privately transferred and cancelled numerous accounts receivable and payable since taking over the liquidation on May 27th, not only failing to uphold the principle of fair liquidation but also suspected of helping the defendant embezzle funds. One of the significant unlawful accounts discovered was a sum of 19,566.459 taels received from Zuyin Account, which was then paid to Chunyuan Account. Since Zuyin Account was a debtor of Tongsheng, the funds should have been properly stored for future distribution to creditors. However, the funds were paid to Chunyuan Account, which was clearly the defendant's account, as evidenced by Hu Yongde's "General Copy Book of Tongsheng Liquidation Office for the 20th Year of the Republic." Therefore, Hu Yongde's transfer of 19,566.459 taels was clearly transferring the funds received from Tongsheng's Zuyin Account into the defendant's hands, which is clearly an act of helping to conceal the crime. As the manager of Tongsheng, the defendant disregarded the shareholders' losses and intentionally embezzled funds at the time of Tongsheng's closure, which is a violation of conscience and a crime of professional embezzlement under Article 57, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Whether there was any other embezzlement will be investigated and prosecuted later. The plaintiffs suffered from this harm and filed this lawsuit to request the court to investigate, summon, and convict the defendant. The plaintiffs also filed a civil lawsuit to request the court to order the defendant to repay 19,566.459 taels and pay interest calculated from May 27th of the 19th year until the date of enforcement, according to the rates of Shen Bank Money Exchange and discounted money exchanges. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide summoned the defendant, and lawyer Wu Linkun requested a postponement, which the court granted.</p>
<h3>Spring Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses Will Be Collected on Schedule</h3>

<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai Baochuan Chongqi Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Bureau sent a letter yesterday to the various trade associations of West Tobacco, Dry Tobacco, Tobacco Exchange, Local Yellow Wine, Liang Baijiu, Fenjiu, Jiangjiu, Medicinal Wine, etc., stating: "We hereby inform you that the spring tobacco and alcohol license tax for the 21st year will be collected from January 1st to the 10th. A fine will be imposed for late payment. All tobacco and alcohol merchants should come to the bureau to renew their licenses within the time limit.

<h3>Man Freezes to Death Near Hujia Bridge</h3>
<p>An unidentified male corpse, approximately fifty years old, was found frozen to death in front of the Yonganfang entrance on Hujia Bridge in Hongkou the night before. He was wearing a short overcoat and was barefoot, but wearing galoshes. The Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District ordered the local police to investigate, but no family members came forward to claim the body. Therefore, it was reported to the local court, and Prosecutor Yang and others were commissioned to inspect the scene. They ordered the undertaker to collect the body and take a photo, awaiting family members to claim it.</p>
<h3>A Box of Suits of Unknown Origin</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 27th) morning, Chinese detectives Zhang Shoushan and others from the Hongkou Police Station searched pedestrians on Broadway Road and found a Ningbo native named Zhang Agen carrying a suitcase. His behavior was suspicious, so they ordered him to open the suitcase for inspection. Inside were several sets of Western-style clothing worth over 200 yuan. When questioned about the origin of the clothing, he hesitated to answer. Fearing that it was stolen property, they immediately took him to the Hongkou Police Station and reported to the head of the detectives. The head ordered him to be detained pending investigation of the origin of the clothing.</p>
<h3>Fuchang Tobacco Company Hosts a Banquet</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Jinrong, the general manager of the Fuchang Tobacco Company in this city, in view of the recent invasion of Shenyang by the violent Japanese and the valiant defense of the country by Chairman Ma Zhanshan, who has earned the admiration of all, specially issued a "General Ma Zhanshan" cigarette, so that the people of the country will think of this person when they smoke and never forget him. Last night, he hosted a banquet at the Taohuagong Restaurant on Mintiniyin Road to entertain the press in this city, with over four hundred people attending. Mr. Huang was unable to attend because he went to inspect the construction project at his ancestral shrine in Caohejing. He specially invited Mr. Tang Jiapeng to attend on his behalf. The guests and hosts toasted each other and enjoyed themselves until around 10 PM, when the banquet ended.</p>
<h3>The Fuyang Fellow Villagers Association is Established</h3>
<p>An increasing number of people from Fuyang County, Anhui Province, are working, doing business, studying, and engaging in various fields in Shanghai.

<h3>A Fire at Qichang Warehouse Causes a Loss of Two Million</h3>
<p>District Chief Zhang Visited in Person to Investigate</p>
<p>The Fire Was Caused by a Short Circuit</p>
<p>The British Ewo Yoko's Qichang Warehouse H warehouse in Pudong was accidentally destroyed by a fire, burning a large number of printed fabrics and other items. This newspaper reported yesterday that the Director of the Public Security Bureau and District Chief Zhang of the Third District personally visited to investigate the cause of the fire.

Each bale was calculated at 150 yuan, totaling a loss of 1.2 million yuan. Together with the warehouse and other goods, the total loss was nearly 2 million yuan. The warehouse had insurance of over 100,000 yuan taken out by the company, and the printed fabrics and other items were insured separately by each company, but the amounts are unknown. District Chief Zhang reported the details of the fire and the approximate losses to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review.</p>

<h3>雪蝶案 Judgment</h3>
<p>Lin Xuehuai, previously dissatisfied with the first instance judgment in which Hu Die sued him for breach of engagement and recovery of debt, continued to retain lawyers Oson Ni and Ao to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Hu Die, also dissatisfied with the fact that her claim for compensation for mental distress was not fully upheld, filed a cross-appeal at the same time. The court has now concluded the hearing and rejected both appeals. Both parties are responsible for the costs of the second instance. This was previously reported. The judgment in this case has now been officially delivered to both parties. The facts and reasons are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Facts: The appellant (Lin Xuehuai) declared that the original judgment should be overturned, the appellee's (Hu Die's) claims in the first instance and cross-appeal should be rejected, and the appellee should bear the costs of both instances. The appellant's statement of facts roughly stated that the breach of engagement in this case did not comply with Article 972 of the Civil Code, so there was no reason for the breach. If it is considered that the breach of engagement was initiated by the appellant, that is a mistake. The appellant's offer had already been rejected, so it had already lost its binding force, as stipulated in Article 155 of the Civil Code. Moreover, the intention to break the engagement came from the appellee, who had Zhou Jianyun invite the appellant to a conversation, at which point it was learned that the appellee had already decisively broken the engagement. This can be seen from the appellee's actions. The original trial did not examine the facts or the law, and ordered the engagement broken, which is unacceptable. The Hu Die Company was founded by the appellee's father. According to the law, the appellee's father should be the principal party. The appellee's father is still alive, and inheritance has not yet begun, so the appellee cannot exercise rights on behalf of his father. Moreover, the debts claimed, such as 380 taels for the car, 138.2 yuan for the Hardoon's apartment rent, and 50 yuan for Rong Kangxiang Western clothes, have already been repaid to the appellee. The account books were destroyed, making it impossible to audit them. The 600-yuan check from the Star Company was entrusted by the appellee to the appellant to withdraw money from the bank, which was immediately handed over to the appellee. At the time, they were engaged, so no receipt was issued. The original trial used this check, which failed to prove the debt relationship, to conclude that the debt occurred. This shows blatant bias. As for the appellant's claim for 1,000 yuan in damages, the appellant did not suffer any losses, and the cross-appeal is completely unreasonable. The appellee (Hu Die) declared that the appeal should be rejected, the cross-appellant (Hu Die) should be awarded 1,000 yuan in compensation for mental distress, and the appellant should bear the costs of both instances. The statement of facts roughly stated that the engagement was first terminated by the appellant, who twice sent letters through a lawyer requesting termination. The letters and newspaper reports falsely accused the appellee of improper conduct and a bad reputation. Moreover, his written statements already indicated that the relationship had ended. This constitutes the conditions for a major event as defined in Article 976, paragraph 9 of the Civil Code. The original judgment approving the termination of the engagement was extremely appropriate. The property of the Hu Die Company is jointly owned by the appellee and her father. The appellee's father, Hu Shaogong, testified in court, which can be verified in the original trial transcript. What the appellant said is completely fabricated and misinterprets the law. Regarding the payment of 380 taels for the car, 138.2 yuan for the Hardoon's apartment rent, and 50 yuan for Rong Kangxiang Western clothes, there are check stubs to prove it. The appellant also lacked security deposit due to gold transaction. He implored the appellee to borrow a check of 600 yuan from the Shanghai Star Film Company. After he withdrew the money himself, he turned to Shanghai Bank to deposit money in a new account. The facts are all there. The appellant knew that the appellee's company suffered a fire, and all the account books and goods were destroyed. However, he deliberately demanded the presentation of account books. Its intention is nothing more than attempting to escape the responsibility. The appeal should be rejected. As for the reason why the engagement was terminated is as stated above. The blame should be attributed to the appellant's party. According to Articles 978 and 979 of the Civil Code, the appellee requests 1,000 yuan in compensation for mental distress, which is not excessive.</p>
<p>Reason: The reasons for this case can be divided into three parts, which are explained separately below. (1) Regarding the engagement: The termination of the engagement was first requested by the appellant, as evidenced by the letter from the appellant to the lawyer Oson, which contains the words "the relationship has ended" and "it is unbearable" and "Please proceed with the termination of the engagement according to the law." The appellant does not dispute the contents of the letter. However, the appellant claims that the talk of breaking the engagement was expressed to Zhou Jianyun earlier, and that the appellee had already rejected the appellant's offer and lost its binding force. His claims are contradictory. Moreover, according to Zhou Jianyun's testimony in the original trial, the appellee did not express any intention to break the engagement at the beginning, and there is no proof that the appellee rejected the appellant's offer. Since the termination of the engagement was requested by the appellant first, the appellee then sued for the termination of the engagement. The original trial's judgment ordering the termination is not wrong. (2) Regarding the debt: The Hu Die Company paid 380 taels for the car, 138.2 yuan for the Hardoon's apartment rent, and 50 yuan for Rong Kangxiang Western clothes on behalf of the appellant. The appellant admits this without objection. The appellant also admits that the 600-yuan check from the Star Film Company was withdrawn by him. However, the appellant's defense is that the Hu Die Company was founded by the appellant's father, Hu Shaogong, and the appellee did not obtain Hu Shaogong's authorization, so he could not sue. The payment for the car, apartment rent, and Rong Kangxiang Western clothes has been repaid, and the check from the Star Film Company was delivered to the appellee after it was withdrawn. This court found that the Hu Die Company was jointly founded by the appellee and her father, Hu Shaogong. Hu Shaogong testified clearly in the trial and said that the lawsuit was agreed upon together. Therefore, the creditor's rights of the Hu Die Company are jointly owned by the appellee and her father. There is nothing illegal for the appellee to sue. As for the payment of various items, the appellant said that it has been repaid, but there is no way to prove it. Even if the appellee failed to produce the account books as evidence, attacking the appellant for concealing the account books, the Hu Die Company had suffered a fire. The letter from the Anping Water and Fire Insurance Company submitted by the appellant's lawyer is sufficient to prove that the appellee said that the account books were destroyed in the fire, which is not unreasonable. It cannot be said to be concealment. (3) Regarding the 600-yuan check from the Star Film Company, the appellee said that the appellant had raised 500 taels and deposited it in the Hongkou Branch of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank. Although this court sent a letter to the bank to verify, it could not be confirmed. However, the check was withdrawn by the appellant and stamped with Xuehuai's chop. If the appellant does not have other evidence to prove that it has been delivered to the appellee, he cannot be exempted from the responsibility of repayment. It does not matter whether the appellant has deposited the money in Shanghai Bank. The original trial ordered the appellant to repay the above items, which is also appropriate. The above appeals cannot be said to be reasonable. Based on the above judgment, both the appeal and cross-appeal are unreasonable. According to Article 517 and Article 103 of the Civil Procedure Regulations, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>

<h3>Yan Jinbiao, Sentenced to Death, Identifies Li Guocheng</h3>
<p>Identifies Li Guocheng in a Photo of Ten People</p>
<p>Request to bring Li for Retrial</p>
<p>The Fasheng New Hostel at 113 Xinxiaoqiao Street, French Concession, on the evening of August 15 of this year, a robbery and murder case occurred in Room 2, killing Xia Yongsheng and two others surnamed Xue and Jiang Zhongfa. The French police arrested the suspect Yan Jinbiao, also known as Yan Er, from Funing, and found that Yan had committed three cases of gang robbery this spring. He was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and sentenced to death. Yan refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the High Third Branch. The result of the trial was still a death sentence, and he was detained for execution. Now, Yan is in custody and has submitted a petition requesting the arrest of Li Guocheng, a key suspect in the case, for questioning. It is now known that Li was arrested and detained by the Public Security Bureau in the Chinese Concession for another case. The Second Special Court prepared a document and sent police to the Public Security Bureau to bring him. The Public Security Bureau replied that a total of ten people were captured in the case, and it was necessary to identify who Li was before transferring him. Therefore, the photos of the ten captured suspects were sent to the Second Special Court. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Criminal Judge Ge Zhitan sat in the Criminal Court III and ordered the suspect Yan to be brought for questioning. Yan confessed that the murder case was actually committed by Li Guocheng. The people were arrested and sentenced to death. The real situation was a miscarriage of justice. He requested a clear understanding and the arrest of Li for questioning. The official showed the photos to Yan and ordered him to identify the face of the suspect Li. Yan accepted the photos and, after examining them, pointed out the second photo from the right in the second row as Li Guocheng. The official said that he must identify clearly and not rush to identify. Yan replied that he and Li were from the same village and knew each other, so he would not make a mistake, and that Li was a very famous person in the Jiangbei area. Judge Ge then ordered him to wait for a change of date to transfer Li Guocheng for questioning. Yan was still detained.</p>
<h3>Three Thugs Sentenced to Garrison Headquarters</h3>

After preliminary hearing, it was ordered to be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for punishment.</p>
<h3>Lu Xingdi's Problem of Forcing Prostitution</h3>
<p>Circumstances of Repeated Prostitution</p>
<p>Lu Xingdi, a 16-year-old woman from Jiading, because she was not yet an adult, retained lawyer Cai Jishi as her legal representative, with her mother, Lu Lu (43 years old), as her legal guardian. She filed a criminal complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing the woman Li Liu of restricting her freedom. She stated that the woman usually made a living farming in her hometown, but because she had many children and could not afford to raise them, she entrusted her daughter Xingdi to the care of Li Liu, the landlady of the Hefeng Hotel on Simalu Road, four years ago, through Chen Jinqing, to learn opera, so that she could rely on her for life in the future. Later, because the hotel was being renovated, it moved without a trace. The woman came to Shanghai several times to look for her, but still could not find her. She was in despair. Unexpectedly, last month, her daughter suddenly returned home alone, recounting the situation of being forced into prostitution by Liu. Therefore, she was unwilling to give up and filed a lawsuit, requesting an investigation. Lu Xingdi said that after she was introduced to Liu's family by Chen Jinqing, she first learned opera, and then was sent to a brothel in Hankou to work as a prostitute. Last March, she came to Shanghai and was again taken to the Aimei Brothel on Shantou Road. In May, she went to the Lijuan Brothel in Leyu Lane, and in August, she went to the Yinghong Brothel in Fuyu Lane. She has been repeatedly forced into prostitution several times and has been abused. Therefore, she could not bear the suffering and escaped back to her mother's home. This is the truth. Li Liu, who is 60 years old and from Suzhou, said that she opened the Hefeng Hotel. The daughter of the plaintiff is actually a prostitute who runs the hotel. She has never learned opera at the woman's place, and has never been forced into prostitution. She also hired a lawyer to defend her. After a long period of mutual defense by the lawyers of both parties, the presiding judge ordered the defendant to post bail and wait for a continued hearing on another date.</p>
<h3>Woman Hu Shanshan Sues Her Brother for Living Expenses</h3>
<p>Failed to Reach an Agreement</p>
<p>The woman Zai Shanshan, who is 31 years old, is a spinster. Recently, she retained lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special District, accusing her brothers Hu Disheng and Hu Lansheng of occupying her inheritance and illegal insults, and requesting an allowance for living expenses. The complaint stated that the plaintiff was born at an unfortunate time. Seven months after she was born, her father Youxiang died of illness, leaving behind nearly one million yuan in property, which was managed by her eldest brother Disheng and second brother Lansheng. Disheng was born to the plaintiff's former mother, Zhou, and Lansheng was born to the plaintiff's biological mother, Cheng. When Youxiang passed away, the plaintiff was still an infant and had no knowledge of anything. Afterwards, time passed quickly, and the defendants treated the plaintiff as a stranger, with the power in their hands. Even the daily supply of food and clothing was met with complaints. The plaintiff complained about her bad fate and adhered to the principle of not marrying for life. Now that she is over 30 years old, she lives in Lansheng's place and is spared from freezing and starvation thanks to the protection of her biological mother. However, the defendants' cold eyes and taunts made it difficult for the plaintiff to tolerate herself. For the sake of her lifelong livelihood, she intended to ask the defendants to give her a discretionary allowance for living expenses. Therefore, this year, she entrusted lawyer Jiang Bao to send a letter on her behalf. Unexpectedly, the defendants not only did not reply or agree to give her the allowance, but instead insulted her arbitrarily and even wanted to drive the plaintiff out. The plaintiff, in her resentment, had no choice but to seek legal remedy. Considering that her father Youxiang had passed away for 30 years, according to the current Civil Code, the plaintiff has no provision to request a re-analysis of the inheritance. However, after reviewing the precedent of the Dali Court, No. 318 of the Five Years, it is stated that before a sister is married, the expenses of raising her should be borne equally by each brother and sister. There should be no discrimination based on whether they have the same mother or not. The second half of No. 669 of the Three Years states that if the biological mother is liked by her family, she should be given a share of the property without any doubt. However, the benchmark for apportionment should be based on the wishes of the parents. If the parents did not express their wishes during their lifetime, the trial court should consider the situation and the status of the estate to determine the benchmark. No. 761 of the Seven Years states that if the biological mother is liked by her family, the mother may be given a discretionary amount of the inheritance after the father's death, but it should be less than the amount divided equally among the number of people who should be divided. Now that the plaintiff is determined not to marry for life, and the defendants have an inheritance of one million yuan under their management, according to the above precedents, they have the obligation to support the plaintiff and give her a discretionary allowance for living expenses. The plaintiff's request is based on the kinship and the legal principles of the precedents. The defendants should not have refused so sternly, and even insulted and expelled her. Although the plaintiff requested the court to mediate, the defendants all denied and claimed that the inheritance was only tens of thousands of yuan, resulting in the failure of mediation. At that time when the defendants inherited the estate from their father, the will recorded the actual number. If the defendants were ordered to hand over the will for reference, it could prove that what the plaintiff said was true. Therefore, please summon the defendants and order them to jointly pay the plaintiff 100,000 yuan for living expenses and bear the costs of the lawsuit. This case has been heard by the court once, and it was ordered to try mediation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren of the Civil Court held another hearing and questioned the lawyers of both parties about the mediation. However, both defendants failed to appear as summoned. According to the defendant's lawyer, his lawyer had mediated with the plaintiff's lawyer, Tingrui, but the plaintiff stated that she needed 100,000 yuan, while the defendant was willing to give 1,000 yuan. The amount was too far apart, resulting in the failure of mediation. Judge Zhou said that the two parties were siblings and it was best to mediate. He must know that litigation will eventually lead to misfortune. He persuaded both parties to compromise and not go to extremes. The defendant's lawyer then said that according to the defendant, he would give the plaintiff 30 mu of farmland in Yuyao. The land price there was quite expensive at first, about 100 yuan per mu, but now it has fallen to 70 or 80 yuan per mu. When the plaintiff Hu Shanshan heard this, she declared that she was unwilling. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer, Chen, said that when Youxiang died, he made a will, which was recorded in detail. Now, the defendant himself is not only absent, but the will is also not brought to the court, so there is no hope of mediation. The lawyer can now cite one thing: someone from the defendant's clan failed in business and suffered a huge loss, and the defendant generously helped him with 2,000 taels of silver. Now, he is only willing to give 1,000 yuan to his sibling, which is too far apart. If the defendant can give a substantial amount, the lawyer is willing to persuade the plaintiff to compromise. Judge Zhou ordered the case to be rescheduled to January 11 next year to wait for the defendant to appear in court for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Fellow Townsman Threatens with Letter</h3>
<p>Three Arrested, One Escaped</p>
<p>Li Anfa, the owner of the Shengli Weaving Factory at No. 831 Qiwupu Road, who is from Anhui, recently received a threatening letter written by bandits, which was stuffed into the factory fence, extorting 2,000 yuan, otherwise they would shoot him to death with a pistol and set fire to the weaving machine frame. The next morning, he sent a representative to a certain place on Taopeng Road to deliver the money, and someone would come to accept it. After Li received the letter, he was extremely frightened and reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to the vicinity of the place at the appointed time to wait, but there was no trace. Li thought that the letter must have been written by unemployed fellow townsmen, so he asked his fellow villager Zhang Xuechuan to investigate. The next day, Zhang and his friend Jin Changsheng, who was also from Anhui, went to the factory and told Li that the letter was written in the French Concession, and someone named Luo Bengen knew about it. He would go to investigate further. After a while, he went to Li and asked him to go to a certain place in the French Concession to talk. Li did not go because he did not have so much money. Early in the morning, Luo Bengen, Luo Lunpu, Jin, and Zhang came to Li and negotiated, asking him to pay 1,500 yuan to settle the matter. Li refused, and the amount was reduced to 1,000 yuan or 800 yuan. Li still pleaded to reduce it, and Jin and Zhang mediated, reducing it to at least 200 or 300 yuan. Seeing this situation, Li determined that this matter was done by them, so he secretly reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest Luo Lunpu, Jin Changsheng, and Zhang Xuechuan, while Luo Bengen took the opportunity to escape. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court Gao Yi Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, stated the previous situation and requested a postponement. He then presented the threatening letter for inspection. Then, Li Anfa, the victim, reported the situation, and Luo and the other three defendants were questioned. They all claimed that they were mediating the threatening letter for Li and had no accomplices. They asked for a review. Judge Shen Bingrong ordered them all to be detained and waited for a continued hearing to investigate.</p>
<h3>Two Unfortunate Deaths in Wusong</h3>
<p>Climbing Crabs: Kang Guilin, a 58-year-old resident of Kangjiagang, behind the Huafeng Yarn Factory in West Wusong, made a living by farming. However, after completing his agricultural work, he often took climbing crabs as a sideline. Therefore, he owned a sampan. Every year from the end of autumn to winter, Kang would moor his sampan on the Sitang River (near Taixing'an Bridge), and use several small square nets to climb and catch river crabs and sell them in Songzhao the next morning, as he had been accustomed to doing. Unexpectedly, while Guilin was climbing crabs the night before, a sudden northwest wind broke out. Guilin accidentally fell into the riverbank. Because it was late at night, no one rescued him at that time, and he tragically drowned, and no one noticed. It was not until yesterday morning that his son Zhanglin went and did not see his father's figure, so he searched nearby and found his father's body, and he knew that he had fallen into the river and died. So he salvaged the body, carried it back to Kangjiagang, and prepared a coffin for burial.</p>
<p>Swallowing Smoke: Zhu Yang, a resident of Li Jiazhaizi in West Wusong, who was nearly sixty years old, suffered from nervous disorder after going to visit relatives in Yangxing a few days ago. She secretly went out to buy raw opium and swallowed it secretly, and lay on the bed. Later, her son Lao Er saw that her face was pale and examined it carefully, and learned that she had swallowed raw smoke. He immediately ordered someone to carry his mother to Jiang Yisheng's Western doctor's office. After Dr. Jiang injected as much as 16 pounds of disinfectant, the poison had gone to the limbs and could not be saved. He was carried back home and died yesterday morning. Now, his sons Lao Er and Lao San have prepared a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Young Floating Corpse</h3>

It was already ineffective. The deceased was about 30 years old, wearing blue cloth clothes and pants, and looked like a worker. He was sent to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>Lu Haogen Crushed His Right Hand and Died</h3>
<p>Lu Haogen, a 32-year-old mud mason from Jiangyin at the Shenxin No. 6 Yarn Factory at Gaolangqiao in Yangshupu, was painting the wall in the workshop yesterday morning. He accidentally got caught in the machine, crushed his right hand, and injured his head. He was dying. Later, the fire brigade sent him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment by car. He died shortly after due to his serious injuries. The hospital reported it to the morgue, waiting for a report from the court for examination.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Injury on Qingyun Road</h3>
<p>Ge Hecai, a 39-year-old man from Haimen who worked at the Commercial Press at No. 37 Hongfa Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, was suddenly visited by several bandits wearing blue-black cloth long shirts at 7:25 PM the night before. Two bandits knocked on the door, pretending to ask for a letter. Ge's wife, Ms. Chen, 38 years old, did not suspect anything and opened the door. The two bandits rushed into the living room. At that time, Ge had not returned home. A bandit wearing a black long shirt took out a pistol, threatening silence, and hugged Ms. Chen around the waist. Another bandit took off the gold jewelry on Ms. Chen's hand and fled to the door. The bandit hugging Ms. Chen also followed suit. When he reached the door, Ms. Chen dragged the bandit in blue clothes, shouting "Robbery!" The bandit in a hurry used the handle of a pistol to hit Ms. Chen's head, piercing a hole and bleeding profusely. Ms. Chen, in pain, let go and saw the bandit fleeing to the back door of No. 31, jumping on the platform to the open space in the west and escaping. The neighbor Zeng told the Pengpu Security Corps' Third Team duty platoon leader Hong Yunfa, who was nearby, to take a gun and rush to the scene, but the bandit had already fled far away. He then took the victim to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau and the Xibinxing Road Police Station to report the incident, and agreed to try to investigate. However, Ms. Chen's head was severely injured, her face was badly injured, and her nose was broken by the bandit. However, according to Ms. Chen, when she twisted and fought at the door, the bandit in the blue cloth long shirt was also bitten hard on the shoulder, and his clothes were torn. The bandit may also be injured. He was only able to escape because no one was at home and the neighbors did not dare to help.</p>
<h3>Someone Sleeping and Snoring in a Trash Can</h3>
<p>Likely Suffering from Mental Illness</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, in the Dongjiadu area of the Nanshi district, a man, appearing to be in his thirties and wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, was found sleeping in a trash can placed by the roadside. He neither ate nor drank, which onlookers found strange. After waking him up, they asked why he was lying in the trash can, but he only stared blankly and remained silent. Shortly after, he turned over and resumed snoring loudly, appearing to be suffering from mental illness. The local police station prepared a letter and sent him to Puyutang (a charitable institution) for care. According to acquaintances, the man was usually fond of gambling, but unfortunately, he had lost repeatedly, sending all his family property into the "thirty-six gates" (gambling dens). After becoming depressed, he developed this mental illness, waving his arms and stamping his feet all day long, with erratic moods. Sometimes he would run wildly in the streets. Today, it was likely due to the cold weather that he slept in the trash can.</p>
<h3>Mistaking 248 for 842</h3>
<p>An Understandable Situation</p>
<p>The Gongda Rice Shop at 134 Kangti Road in the French Concession recently had a No. 248 bicycle stolen. All the shop's employees were very vigilant. Yesterday morning, an apprentice from the shop saw a No. 842 bicycle speeding past and mistook it for the stolen one. He then gave chase, apprehended the rider, and handed him over to the Lujia Police Station. After questioning, it was found that the bicycle belonged to a gardener named Wei Tingrong from the Fahua Nursery. Therefore, he was immediately released. The gardener, extremely angry, gathered a group of people and went to the Gongda Rice Shop to negotiate, demanding compensation for reputational damage. Amid heated arguments, a scuffle broke out. Later, the shop owner, Mr. Qu, decided to ask the Chamber of Commerce to mediate, and the matter was finally resolved.</p>
<p>Reader's Letter</p>
<p>Tang Qi writes about the Disposal of Sealed Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Resisting Japanese goods has been ongoing for nine times now, and each time it has been criticized for being a "five-minute fad" because there is no thorough solution. My humble opinion on a thorough solution involves both fundamental and superficial measures: (1) Fundamental solution: Organize a state-run import and export trading company. In this era of industrial backwardness in our country, we cannot avoid importing bulk commodities. It is imperative to organize a state-run import and export trading company. Its branches should be distributed in various seaports and commercial cities. All purchases of foreign goods by Chinese people should be handled by the company. Individuals should not be allowed to directly order goods. Those who order from foreign firms should first register and obtain permission from the company. (In the future, if diplomatic solutions are available, all foreign firms importing goods to China for sale should also be handled by the company.) Those who do not register and obtain permission should be punished. Since the state-run import and export trading company is the central hub for commodity imports, people should not be allowed to order Japanese goods, and Japanese goods would then have no way to enter. (2) Superficial solution: Establish import and export registration offices in various ports. Before the establishment of the state-run trading company, each port should organize an import and export registration office. All people in the city who import goods from other ports must first register and obtain permission, then obtain a registration certificate. Carriers must verify that the registration certificate matches the goods before transporting them. Violators, both importers and carriers, will be subject to penalties. (The registration office will conduct inspections at any time.) Since the registration office is the review authority for all commodity imports in the city, people should not be allowed to purchase and transport Japanese goods, and Japanese goods would then have no way to enter. At the same time, a domestic goods promotion department could be established to introduce domestic goods to merchants to replace the foreign goods they want to purchase. However, the registration of import and export trade may cause inconvenience for law-abiding people. The quality of personnel in various ports may be uneven, and there may be abuses of power for personal gain, which is indeed worth considering. However, this is a superficial solution, and it should be abolished after the state-run import and export trading company is established. The establishment of the state-run import and export trading company should be limited to the shortest possible time. Since import and export registration offices have been established in various ports, Japanese goods will no longer be able to continue entering the country. The sealed Japanese goods within the country can be released and allowed to be sold freely, which will not affect the overall anti-Japanese action. These released sealed Japanese goods will be the last batch of Japanese goods. Shops and customers can buy and sell them with a clear conscience, and merchants' capital and the social economy can be restored as a result. When releasing the goods, merchants should pay 5% of the total value of the sealed goods to the state-run trading company as a fund. Nationwide, this should amount to more than ten million, which would allow the state-run import and export trading company to be established quickly, and Japanese goods will be permanently eradicated from our country.</p>
<p>(Reply) Using a state-run import and export trading company as a fundamental solution and import and export registration as a superficial solution to resist Japanese goods is indeed essential. However, the letter also considers whether registration will be inconvenient for merchants and whether officials can avoid abusing their power for personal gain. Even if the state-run company is established, whether corruption can be completely eliminated is also a question. Look at the current state-run enterprises; almost all of them are eroding the national economy, exploiting the people's livelihood, and enriching officials. Where can we talk about credibility? If there is really no solution, it is better to promote less. Furthermore, before formally declaring economic severance, using a state-run import and export trading company to absolutely prohibit the import of goods from a certain country may give that country an excuse because it comes from the government rather than the people.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To the Editors of Shenbao:</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that I read on page 16 of the fourth section of your newspaper on December 23rd, an article about a joint meeting held by the various district branches of our city’s Party. It was deeply alarming to read that Branch 21 of District 2 was listed as being in attendance. Upon investigation, this branch did not formally send any representative to attend on that day. It is believed that this was an error in the meeting records, and it concerns the responsibility of this branch. Therefore, in addition to investigating this matter, we are writing to request that your newspaper grant us a correction. Respectfully, Yu Hui Guan, Standing Committee Member of Branch 21, District 2, Shanghai Special City Party Department, December 27th.</p>

<h3>Reading Chairman Ma Zhanshan's Telegram</h3>
<p>Some time ago, Chairman Ma Zhanshan sent a telegram advising the Youth Volunteer Corps to Aid Ma in Resistance Against Japan not to go to Heilongjiang. The telegram contained these words: "...Handmaidens weave, slaves till the land, each with their own specific duties; safeguarding the country and resisting foreign aggression is the responsibility of soldiers..." Reading these words, I had two thoughts: one was a reluctance to criticize, and the other was a necessity to criticize. Why the reluctance to criticize? Chairman Ma is fighting the Japanese in the frozen wilderness, fighting for the nation's dignity amid the risk of death. His loyalty is admired by all. Even if he said a wrong word or two, the people should forgive him. How could I dare to nitpick? Why the necessity to criticize? Chairman Ma is now a universally respected figure in the country. People have almost blind faith in his words and actions. If the people, because of their admiration for Chairman Ma's merits, also regard these words as golden rules, wouldn't we all become like ancient people? I began with a reluctance to criticize, but ultimately felt compelled to criticize precisely because of this reason.</p>
<p>The era of handmaidens weaving and slaves tilling the land is long gone. Today, it is workers who weave cloth, not handmaidens. Today, it is farmers who till the land, not slaves. Above workers and farmers, there should no longer be those scholars who "do not toil with their limbs and cannot distinguish the five grains." The "idiot ruler" that Mr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of is not Sun Ke but our workers and farmers. Workers and farmers are the masters of the Republic of China. We should acknowledge them as masters. To treat everyone as slaves is, to put it lightly, an ideological error; to put it harshly, all acts of treason against the Republic of China by warlords throughout history originated from this single misconception. Gu Tinglin said: "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual." Modern citizens have the duty to serve in the military, thus bearing the shared responsibility of safeguarding the country and resisting foreign aggression. The responsibility of soldiers lies not in defending the land alone but in forging the people to have the collective strength to defend the nation. If Chairman Ma can realize this idea, not only can Heilongjiang province be secured, but the entire nation will be inspired, and the Republic of China will become an impregnable land, impossible for anyone to invade.</p>
<p>Some say that this telegram might have been drafted by a secretary and sent without Chairman Ma's review. I say that even if Chairman Ma wrote it himself, it is a gentleman's error, like a solar eclipse, not harming his brilliance.</p>
<h3>Wu Changqing's Foresight</h3>
<p>— Qing Song Jushi</p>
<p>Japan, as an Eastern island nation, looks down on our country. Its iron cavalry roams rampant, trampling the Northeast. Although commentators say that the policy of non-resistance led to the滔天之禍 (immense disaster), they do not know that the disaster did not originate on the day of its occurrence; it must have been foreshadowed. Therefore, tracing the origin of the disaster, it almost began with the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. However, ten years before the war, among the senior generals of the Qing Dynasty, there was someone who exposed their conspiracy and wanted to prepare for a rainy day. Although I entered the world late, I heard from the elders that there was a man named Wu, who had great foresight and ambition to counter Japan. Although he died with unfulfilled aspirations, his earnest warnings about the future, saying what no one dared to say at the time, were praised by later generations. Therefore, I am following Xu Zi's example of not being afraid of bothering people and providing some assistance to those who are concerned about national affairs.</p>
<p>Wu's given name was Changqing, and he was given the posthumous title of Zhuang. He was from Lujiang, Anhui. He had great ambitions from a young age and studied military strategy diligently. In the early years of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, Li Hongzhang was training troops in Suzhou and Shanghai. Wu served under his command. Although he fought in numerous eastern and western campaigns, rising to the rank of general, he did not wish to see frequent internal conflicts that harmed his own people. He was only forced to do so under overwhelming pressure, and although he did not speak of it, he felt guilty at heart. Later, in the eighth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Wu became the admiral of the Guangdong Navy. At that time, Korean rebels attacked the Japanese embassy and affected the royal palace. The Japanese were in an uproar, thinking that they had an opportunity to take advantage of. Li Hongzhang then ordered Wu to rush to support. Upon hearing the news, Wu immediately got up, thinking that this was an opportunity to achieve merit in a foreign land and boost our national prestige. He led 5,000 soldiers and sailed swiftly by sea. By the time the Japanese soldiers arrived in Hanseong, Wu had already arrived two days earlier and was strictly on guard. The Japanese soldiers were surprised and looked at each other in shock. Wu then detected the whereabouts of the rebels, captured and beheaded dozens of people, and the matter was settled. However, the Japanese were so angry that they insisted on fabricating events. The Japanese admiral, Habusa, led troops to surround the Korean royal palace, spying on the Wu army. Scouts were sent out everywhere, spreading rumors, intending to provoke a conflict with our army. Wu had already discerned their deceitful scheme, reorganized his troops, and made the spears and halberds stern and inviolable. The Japanese were intimidated and dared not challenge. They warned each other, "Don't say they have no one; be careful not to cause trouble." After a month, Korea was largely pacified. He requested to leave five battalions to protect the area. The Koreans were grateful to him and built a shrine for him. In the following year, the tenth year of the Guangxu reign, he returned to Beijing due to illness. Knowing that he would not recover, he repeatedly told Li, "Korea's government is corrupt and the people are poor. The country is militarily weak and strategically important. The Japanese are cunning and malicious. They are eyeing Korea like tigers. It is necessary to train troops and defend it, to prevent the Eastern Japanese from causing trouble, so that Korea will forever remain a vassal state. Otherwise, the Japanese will act recklessly and inevitably annex it, and our country's barrier will be removed." His far-sighted words were like torches. The future Japanese would be like boars and long snakes, gradually feeding on the upper state. Wu was fully aware and considered it all. If Heaven had granted him more years, even if there had been the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, if he had been able to go to support, we would not have lost troops and territory, paid reparations, and been forced into a situation where we are being threatened today. The poem says, "When a good man is gone, my heart is filled with sorrow." That is why I am angry at the unrighteous Eastern Japanese and remember the stories passed down by the elders, and I admire Wu's foresight, which is beyond my reach.</p>
<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>A young Englishman named Gill from Whitney, England, who had worked in more than twenty different occupations, at the age of thirty-two. There are countless young people in the world.</p>
<p>I'm afraid no one can compare to him. He has been a newsboy, a butcher's assistant, a barber's assistant, a grocer's assistant, a telegram deliverer, a sailor on a fishing boat, a woodcarver, an electrician, a motor engineer, a chauffeur, a bricklayer, a carpenter, a cart driver, a servant, a bartender, a gardener, a radio salesman, an elevator operator, a painter, a postman, a woodcutter, and a machine foreman. He has also opened a power plant and an automobile shop, and he has traveled around the world on a simple motorized bicycle. But seeing him, at the age of thirty-two, having done so many different occupations, although he may lack perseverance, his physical health, mental agility, and ambition are evident. Moreover, it is commendable that he traveled around the world on a motorized bicycle.</p>
<h3>Change New Year's Greeting Cards to Warning-of-the-Year Cards</h3>
<p>— Jun Shuo</p>
<p>The national crisis has not ended, and the national worries have not subsided. Enthusiastic people are afraid that all sectors will follow the old practice of sending New Year's greeting cards, causing them to forget the current worries and disregard the country's great shame and humiliation. Therefore, they have advocated stopping New Year's greetings, and their views have been repeatedly disclosed in newspapers, and are known to readers. Yesterday, when the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in my hometown held a meeting, there was a proposal to go a step further than stopping New Year's greetings, saying that simply stopping greetings is still too weak. After all, many people don't send New Year's greeting cards anyway. But simply ceasing these actions does little to communicate the shock and gravity of the current moment. It would be better to change the New Year's greeting cards to "warning-of-the-year" cards. Since the beginning of the twenty-first year has nothing to celebrate and is full of disasters to be wary of, the wording on the card should be very different from before. This proposal was unanimously adopted at the time, and the words on the card were drafted as follows: "The twenty-first year has arrived. It is unbearable to look back. Great disasters lie ahead. No play, no feasting, no indulgence in the New Year. The country is on the verge of collapse. Let us encourage each other to renew and refresh ourselves. Use today's warning to leave for the celebrations of future years." So-and-so bowing with tears. I heard the description of a friend who was at the meeting like this, and I deeply agreed. If we can always maintain this concern and vigilance and use it to influence all sectors, there may be hope for our country's future. In the past, King Zhuang of Chu discussed and trained the people every day, and thus became the hegemon of the Central Plains. King Fucha of Wu, because his father Helü died in battle with Yue, had people stand in the courtyard every day. Every time he went in and out, they would call out, "Fucha, have you forgotten that the King of Yue killed your father?" Then he would answer, "No, I dare not forget." After three years, he avenged Yue. Therefore, those who have the ambition to save the country and avenge shame must have their plans constantly in place. Changing New Year's greetings to "warning-of-the-year" is deeply meaningful.</p>
<h3>Four Casual Notes</h3>
<p>— Shi Tianlai</p>
<p>The origin of the name "Shanghai": Shanghai seems to have initially been a fishing village, a place for ships to stop and dock. Its later development into a major port was based on this. The current name means "above the sea." At that time, there was also a "Lower Shanghai," perhaps because there were two seaports, hence the division into upper and lower. The place located above the sea was named "Shanghai."</p>
<p>The origin of "Kaisar Road": According to legend, a certain Portuguese gentleman happened to be passing by the Hongkou Circus. He heard a woman crying sadly in a tent. He redeemed her and sent her to be raised by a certain American missionary. Later, with the help of the gentleman, the woman went to the United States to study. After returning to China, she married the gentleman. Her name was Kaisar, so he jokingly called the place where she lived "Kaisar Road," meaning "the place of Kaisar." Later generations also called the place Kaisar Road.</p>
<p>The origin of "Foreigner Park": This place is where the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek converge. It was formed by silt. In the past, a ship sank here, so the silt accumulated even more. The land originally belonged to the British Consulate. Later, with the consent of the British government, it was transferred to the Public Works Department, which opened a park. Therefore, a large sum of money was spent to fill the land, and today's beautiful park emerged from a wasteland.</p>
<p>The name of "Bowling Alley": The origin of the name cannot be verified now, but it is known that it was located somewhere at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road (formerly No. 49 Nanjing Road). There was a Chinese-style house there, and a small door on the side of the house led to the bowling alley. Although the house has been rebuilt, the local people still call the place the Bowling Alley.</p>
<h3>An Account of Returning Home Amidst the National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Gao Yahun</p>
<p>The foreign invasion is intensifying, and the country is on the verge of collapse. My mind is filled with the tragic scenes of national destruction, and I have no time to think of my hometown. A few days ago, I went to Hangzhou on business and met with Mr. Chen, the director of the Photographic Team, to discuss matters. I had half a day of free time, and I could have enjoyed the scenery of the lake and mountains. However, I had little interest, and I returned to my hometown at the persuasion of a friend. Although it was only a short trip, I saw and heard many interesting things on the way, which I recorded to bring a smile to my face amidst the tears.</p>
<p>One River, Two Crossings: My home is in Shaoxing. Originally, one could cross the Qiantang River directly to the Xixing shore. This time, when crossing the river to the other side, I had to cross another strip of water. I couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. I asked the boatman, and he told me that a strip of sand rose in the middle of the river. During shallow tidal floods, it protruded from the water surface, so one had to cross the river twice. However, a group of coolies took this opportunity to make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Manpower Automobile: Although there are good and fast long-distance buses in the Shaoxing Highway Bureau, there are also many old and dilapidated ones used to make up the numbers. When the car I was riding started, it had to be pulled by dozens of coolies for half a mile before it could drive smoothly. After stopping at the station, it had to be pushed by manpower again. I couldn't name it, so I called it the "Manpower Automobile."</p>
<p>The Japanese Won't Come: After I arrived home, my neighbor, Mr. Wang, came to inquire about the current situation. I told him about the violent Japanese seizing our land and the impending demise of the country. Those who heard it were all furious. However, Mr. Wang seemed to disbelieve it, saying, "It's hard to believe. There's a saying: 'If you hit them, they'll come; if you scold them, they'll come; but they'll never come if it costs them money.' Would the Japanese dare to come?" It was laughable that he mistook "costing money" for "Japanese."</p>
<p>Begging with Kowtows: When I returned to Hangzhou after spending the night at home, I saw dozens of students begging for donations in Jianggan. When they encountered an old villager who didn't open his purse, the students surrounded the old villager and kowtowed. The old villager was forced to search his purse for a long time and took out a two-cent coin, threw it on the ground, and fled. The onlookers all burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Eagle and Rabbit United: After I arrived in Hangzhou, Mr. Chen of the Photographic Team, because the filming of "Female Knight of the Barren River" was about to be completed, asked me to take an eagle and a rabbit back to Shanghai first. The eagle and rabbit were placed in a basket, and I originally wanted them to unite, but when the eagle saw the rabbit, it wanted to peck at it, and the rabbit was frightened and jumped wildly. So, they were placed in separate places. When boarding the car, I placed the eagle on the luggage rack and the rabbit under the seat. Only then were they at peace.</p>
<p>Fully Tasting Eagle Droppings: One passenger saw that there were few people and lay down on the car seat. Before he knew it, the droppings of the white eagle in the basket on the luggage rack dripped straight down through the gaps in the board, right on the face of the sleeping passenger. The passenger got up and argued with me. I repeatedly apologized, and it finally stopped.</p>
<p>Brief News: The National Salvation Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition, organized by Ms. He Xiangning, is scheduled to open on the 28th. It features over 700 selected works by more than 60 calligraphers and painters. Calligraphers and painters will be invited to collaborate on the spot. It is also heard that Mr. Hu Wenhu, the owner of Yong'an Hall, will donate two airplanes to the association for rescue purposes.</p>
<h3>Records of What I Saw and Heard in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Courtyard Houses</p>
<p>Professor Wang Guowei of Haining once wrote a book, "A Comprehensive Study of the Mingtang Temple and Burial Chamber." According to the oracle bone script, the common architectural system in ancient times was four palaces facing each other with a courtyard in the middle. The courtyard was the central space. The "Book of Rites" says that the head of the family is in the central hall, and the lord of the country is at the altar of the soil and grain, which means that the central space of a family is a place for gatherings. If we follow the old saying that the central space was a leaky place for cave dwellings, it would be contrary to reason and difficult to understand. With this theory established, all the ritual systems of the Mingtang Temple and Burial Chamber, which have been disputed by ancient and modern classical masters, can be clearly explained and proven. Wang was the chief scholar of modern Chinese studies. He was a man of faith, fond of learning, and purely Confucian. He was also proficient in European writing, knowledgeable in the arts, and able to use Western scientific methods to organize ancient traditions. Every time he established a theory, it resonated with people's hearts. Not only were the old people who stubbornly adhered to tradition unable to catch up with him, but even contemporary scholars, who held different views, had to admit his profound knowledge. Wang drowned himself in Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace in the summer of 1927 because he was indignant about the current situation. The academic circles of the whole country lost a guiding star. However, his posthumous writings were even more valued by the world. "The Interpretation of the Classics" is Wang's most brilliant work in explaining the classics. Using it to verify the common architectural style of the Northern Capital, it is almost unshakable. Most middle-class families in the Northern Capital have courtyard houses, with three or five rooms in the main house, three rooms each in the east and west wing rooms, and three or five rooms in the living room facing the main house, which the Northerners call the "inverted seat." This is exactly in line with Wang's theory of four palaces facing each other. The customs of the north mostly follow the ancient ways. Today, cave dwellings still exist in Shanxi and Shaanxi, so there is no doubt that the ancient palace system exists in the Northern Capital. Moreover, the palaces also largely follow the ancient system. The residents of the capital have a fixed style, which is just a microcosm of the palaces. To put it bluntly, Northern architecture is sufficient to represent ancient architecture.</p>
<p>Generally, the gate of a residence cannot face the central hall directly. It must be opened on the right side. Only public offices and royal residences have vermilion gates and latticed windows, with hitching posts in front. Royal residences also have halberds. The heavy gates are wide open and can lead directly to the inner chambers. All other civilian residences open the right door. There is a study inside the gate (a small room next to the gate), which is commonly called the gatehouse and is where the servants live. Connected to the gatehouse is the "inverted seat" mentioned above. Guests enter it. Next to it may be a small courtyard, which can be used as a kitchen and privy. The inverted seat and the main house must be separated by a short wall and a screen door, commonly called a "hanging flower door," because its short pillars are carved into the shape of inverted lotus buds. Entering the hanging flower door is the courtyard of the main house, which is where the main house and wing rooms mentioned above are located. Generally, the main house is where one sleeps and lives, while the wing rooms are used as studies, guesthouses, or to house children and store miscellaneous items. Behind the main house, there may be a small courtyard, called the "back light room." Next to it, there may be another separate courtyard, which may be used to house servants and maids. Only families above the middle class can afford this. In short, most of the houses in the capital are of the above-mentioned courtyard style. Even if there are thousands of changes, they are only remarkable for their corridors and interconnected rooms. The general structure does not deviate from this. Lower than that, there is the three-sided style, which means there is no inverted seat. If it is a poor family's residence, it is a miscellaneous courtyard, unable to have this style.</p>

<h3>1931 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Winner: Wang Fengren</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from Berlin, since Alfred Nobel first initiated the prize in 1901, the Swedish Academy of Sciences has consistently favored scientists engaged in general theoretical work when selecting recipients. However, this year, this custom has been altered. The prize for this year will be shared by two renowned German scientists: Dr. Friedrich Bergius and Dr. Karl Bosch. They have not only achieved worldwide recognition for their theoretical scientific research but have also demonstrated practical effectiveness in the methods they have developed and perfected. Therefore, within the esteemed scientific community, this is considered a rare historical event.</p>
<p>(1) Dr. Bergius</p>
<p>He was interviewed at the Adlon Hotel in Berlin by representatives of a certain news agency. He was described as a cheerful, robust man, well-dressed, and just turning forty-seven this year. He expressed a sense of gratitude and joy upon receiving this prestigious award. Congratulatory gifts arrived like snowflakes, transforming his suite into a flower shop.</p>
<p>Regarding his chemical research, he stated that it was limited to coal and wood. He initially studied chemistry under the guidance of Professor Haber (a previous Nobel Prize winner), who drew his attention specifically to natural products. Later, in 1901, he began researching the most efficient and economical ways to utilize these raw materials. Subsequently, after painstaking efforts and sometimes sacrificing significant expenses for experimentation, he encountered several disappointments and setbacks before finally achieving success and reaching his goal: extracting oil from coal. When he announced his practical invention, his fame spread rapidly. The most important aspect of this invention is that the ratio of carbon to gas in raw coal is 1:16, while in coal oil, their ratio is 1:8. In other words, liquid fuel (oil) contains twice the amount of light gas, making its efficiency greater than that of raw coal. Therefore, it is now utilized in various industries worldwide, especially in various driving engines, where it is an indispensable component. However, when we look back at the global supply of coal oil, it is ultimately finite. Wouldn't that create a coal oil panic? On the other hand, countries like Germany, England, China, and Japan have abundant coal reserves but virtually no coal oil production. Therefore, they can now utilize Dr. Bergius's method to extract coal oil from large coal deposits, supply their domestic consumption, and become oil-independent nations. In that case, the coal oil panic would be postponed for at least tens of millions of years.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Bergius is not limited to researching the method of extracting oil from coal. He believes that there are other valuable substances in wood that are worth studying. Therefore, after another round of laborious research, he invented another method. Using this method, carbohydrates can be produced from wood. Now, take an example: if cellulose in any plant is strongly decomposed using hydrochloric acid under certain conditions, the result becomes sugar. Dr. Bergius's invention of this method is a significant contribution to industry.</p>
<p>Now, wood can be transformed into other valuable substances. For example, using Dr. Bergius's method, two-thirds of a piece of wood can be converted into carbohydrates. These can be dissolved in water and used as animal feed. With further modification, they can also be used as human food. The remaining one-third becomes various by-products, such as acetic acid and lignite. This lignite can still be processed into charcoal like ordinary wood.</p>
<p>Dr. Bergius's invention enables the effective utilization of wood and generates greater profits. Therefore, various countries around the world will inevitably follow suit sooner or later. This is an expected outcome. Taking Germany as an example, it imports no less than three million tons of animal feed annually, and it has been trying to plug this leak, but without a suitable solution. Recently, after Dr. Bergius invented this method, it will soon be put into practice. As for other countries rich in forests, they can naturally convert wood into alcohol and other materials for effective use in the near future.</p>
<p>(2) Dr. Karl Bosch</p>
<p>He is the nephew of Karl Bosch, a renowned electrical engineer. He is 57 years old this year. In addition to serving as the general manager of the German Chemical Trust, he has also been elected as a director of the Nobel (i.e., the initiator of the prize) Company. Therefore, he is not only a renowned scientist and chemical engineer but also one of the leading figures in the German business community.</p>
<p>His fame worldwide dates back to when Professor Haber won the Nobel Prize. Because Professor Haber's initial invention of extracting gas from the air could not have been successful without Dr. Bosch's assistance and the construction of a necessary machine to complete the final steps. Dr. Bosch has created a special artistic term in chemistry, which is that he can produce light gas at 750 degrees Fahrenheit and under 200 degrees of air pressure. The tangible result of Dr. Bosch's efforts is that the German Chemical Trust in Leuna and Oppau has several large machines that can produce a large amount of fertilizer, not only eliminating the need for imports from Chile but also exceeding domestic needs.</p>
<p>During the European War, Germany's need for gas for processing explosives and fertilizers disrupted the normal supply. If there had been no Haber-Bosch method, the country would have inevitably lacked these two items, and the war might not have lasted until November 1918.</p>
<p>Since the first Nobel Prize was awarded in 1901, the Chemistry Prize has been awarded 27 times. Germans have won the most, 15 times, followed by the United Kingdom with 5 times, then France and Sweden with 3 times each, and Switzerland, the United States, and Czechoslovakia with 1 time each.</p>

<h3>The Question of Washing One's Face</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>During Chinese class this afternoon, inexplicably, the Discipline Office repeatedly called out male and female students one after another. This drew the attention of the entire class, causing surprise and unease. The atmosphere became tense, and even the teacher felt strange. So, he put down the textbook and asked the students seriously, "What's going on in this class? Why is the Discipline Office calling you out one after another?"</p>
<p>Everyone said in unison, "We don't know."</p>
<p>"You don't know? You wouldn't not know what's happening in your own class. Would the Discipline Office call you out one after another if nothing happened? Others might not know, but the people who were called out must know, right?"</p>
<p>But everyone remained silent. The students who had been called to the Discipline Office also said, "Nothing happened."</p>
<p>"Humph," the teacher said helplessly, "Next time, pay attention to yourselves, follow the rules and regulations, and don't let the Discipline Office call you out during class again, especially during my class. I won't let you go out if you're called out again, but if you're found to have violated the rules, you will be severely punished."</p>
<p>In this mysterious and tense atmosphere, an hour passed imperceptibly. As soon as the bell rang to end the class, the classroom became chaotic. Everyone asked the students who had gone to the Discipline Office why they were "eating big dishes."</p>
<p>At this time, I heard the words "eating big dishes" and didn't understand what they meant. So, I asked a classmate beside me what "eating big dishes" meant.</p>
<p>He said, "You don't even know what eating big dishes means?"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't."</p>
<p>He said, "Eating big dishes means going to the Discipline Office."</p>
<p>Oh, I suddenly understood. At the same time, driven by curiosity, I eagerly wanted to know why they were "eating big dishes." So, I joined their group to find out what was going on.</p>
<p>The result of asking still didn't make me very clear, but I knew it was roughly about the matter of male and female students (what happened yesterday afternoon). This further piqued my interest. I must find out what's going on.</p>
<p>I ran to the dormitory to find Juan because she was also part of it and must know the whole story.</p>
<p>Juan stood angrily by the window. I pulled her and asked her to tell me what happened.</p>
<p>She said, "You don't know? You're asking me?"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't know because I asked for leave yesterday afternoon and didn't come to class, so I don't know anything at all."</p>
<p>She said, "Oh, that's right. You weren't in class yesterday afternoon. Ah, Bing, we were so angry yesterday. Xin was so angry that she cried in class."</p>
<p>Huang Shan, Director of Discipline at the Patriotic Girls' School</p>
<p>I was stunned and asked, "Why did she cry? Crying in class? I think the male students must have laughed at us. Girls only know how to cry. If there's anything, just negotiate with him. Why cry in class?"</p>
<p>Juan said, "This matter made her too embarrassed. No wonder she was so angry that she cried. I was so angry that I wanted to die. The male students insulted the dignity and personality of us female students. And not just this time, we've often been bullied by them before. You always know. This time, although Xin wasn't good at first, they bullied us too much. If we don't give them a warning this time, we'll be despised by them even more next time."</p>
<p>The cause of the matter was like this: Yesterday afternoon, after the second lesson of ethics, Xin, Ying, and a few others were joking around. Just as a student from another area passed by Xin, he bumped into Xin. When she saw this student's face, she laughed and said to me, "This person is so lazy, I'm afraid he didn't even wash his face today."</p>
<p>"Who knew he would hear it. 'Yes, I didn't even wash my waist today. I don't need anyone to love me. Unlike you female students, who are beautiful, washing your faces dozens of times a day and applying hundreds of times of powder and rouge, so beautiful...' There were also all kinds of unbearable words. I couldn't listen anymore, so I said, 'Watch your words, don't talk nonsense and insult people arbitrarily.' Xin was so angry that she couldn't say a word. Other classmates (who Xin usually doesn't pay much attention to) took this opportunity to take revenge. They attacked from several sides. I had no choice but to tell Xin not to pay attention to them and pulled her out of the classroom. She said angrily that she didn't want to study here anymore and be angry with these barbaric classmates."</p>
<p>When the third lesson of philology started, I went into the classroom first, and Xin came in later. As soon as she entered the classroom, the male students made a strange noise and wrote words insulting her personality on the blackboard and on her desk. So, she cried angrily. We were also angry on her behalf. Their behavior was not only insulting to her alone, but it can be said that it insulted all of us. So, we were no longer polite to them and ran to the Discipline Office to ask the Discipline teacher, 'Are we here to study or to be joked with and bullied by male students?' and asked him to go to the classroom himself to see the words on the blackboard and the desk, and whether female students should be joked with by male students."</p>
<p>"The Discipline Office was also very angry when they saw this classroom disturbance. They said they would investigate and punish those who did it severely. The students who were called out today are either suspects or were called out to ask questions."</p>
<p>The result of "eating big dishes" this time was that several male students received a major demerit, and the female students were taught a few sentences, saying that they should not talk to male students too much in class, and should not laugh at them. "You also have some fault in this matter." After listening to Juan's words, I finally understood the details of this storm, but I didn't expect that the trigger of this incident was originally just a matter of washing one's waist.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>The Chinese Merchants Advertising Company announced that the Ford Motor Company's Roush plant in Dearborn, Michigan, is currently renovating all its electric engines. The 27,000 engines range in size from small enough to operate a sewing machine to large enough to generate 1,750 horsepower. The entire project is now 45% complete. The expenditure has exceeded 6 million gold dollars. It will take approximately two more years to complete the installation. This project is extremely large, requiring the factory's DC engines to be converted to AC engines. This move is part of the company's expansion plan to meet future needs. After the renovation, engine consumption can be reduced, workers can work more safely, and production equipment can be easily expanded. In the beginning, Ford engineers studied the entire plant's equipment in detail. The dimensions and tasks of all old-fashioned engines were taken into consideration. After the research, a list was made, and the needs of each factory building and each part were listed one by one. All machines, from small parts to one-mile-long vehicles, were affected. It has now been proven that each machine can save one to two horsepower after this reinstallation. The current completed equipment can save a total of more than 2,000 horsepower compared to the previous equipment. The Lincoln Motor Company, a part of the Ford Motor Company, will also be renovated at its Detroit plant, estimated to cost approximately US$600,000.</p>
<p>The Liangchen Hao You Society at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road announced that the company has new samples of stationery, envelopes, business cards, and New Year's cards, each with 60 to 70 pieces, for selection or custom printing.
