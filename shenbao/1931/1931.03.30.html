<p>上海市敎育局長徐佩璜昨在上海靑年會講演上海市敎育行政概况略謂敎育之宗旨如提綱挈領說來非僅限於造成自謀生活能力並要造成適合社會環境人才敎育與文化有密切關係我國敎育設施專注重於物質上之發展將來必形成相互爭鬥結果恐仍有礙於文化之進步故對於敎育非惟須適合本國環境且必須與世界各國相互連合至中國現代之敎育係以三民主義爲原則使國人皆能認識總理遺敎三民主義而成大同主義蓋三民主義頗適合中國之</p>
<p>環境故宜努力進行使達目的上海市敎育甚爲複雜不若各國之大都會敎育是狠純粹的若上海租界上之有華童公學敎會學校又有國立·市立·私立·有私塾私塾呈經取締然有一般爲飢寒所迫之文人仍有設立者因此三民主義敎育之實施在上海甚爲困難蓋在外人所辦之學校與我國敎育方針當然不同且敎會學校皆係傳敎作用其他國立市立私立各校情形又各相同在未立案之私立學校其敎育方面</p>
<p>皆不按照敎育方針而設施上海之學校旣如是複雜兹統計其學校數目如下已立案之大學計八處國立大學五處此外獨立學院在十八年度已立案者一一處未立案者八處國立者三處私立八處中學四十五處小學七十三處未立案之中學六十處小學五九處故目今要圖首在促督立案務使與市敎育局所規定之標</p>
<p>準通令其私校不能請求立案之原因有二（一）敎員皆係兼課（二）基金問題故現在敎局擬設法使一般學校皆能限期立案否則予以取締敎育經費方面在十六年度統計幼稚園與小學每年經費二一三九八一二四元中學一六二一一六五二元專科以上學校一四八九○五三元職業與補習學校二四五六八五元統計五四九六二二四元佔市府經費小學與幼稚園爲百分之三二二元中學佔百分之六·三元在十九年度計市校情形現有小學一八五所中學五所民衆敎育五二所補習學校十六所民衆補習四所體育塲七所流通圖書館一所理科實騐一所其經費在八十二萬元以上至學生人數市中男生四六○人女生三二○人市小學學生高級四九九○人初級二五九九○人男敎員一一○人女敎員一八○人市小學男生六五○人女三三○人全市學齡童共一○二○二二人就學者三三七三九人不得就學者四六○五六人未到學齡就學者二二二三七人計學齡童已就學者祗佔百分之四二·六（租界除外）其經費照十九年統計約佔百分之十七元本局對於敎育行政方面費用共九二五八九○元末後希望我國市政日趨發達敎育主權統一能與租界合作依照我國敎育方針實施三民主義敎育云</p>

<p>— 南心</p>
<p>四卷十三號</p>
<p>純文藝的草野周刋它底内容祗是一期比一期地有如海水一般地向前突進着無論何任大小刋物在數量上固然須洋洋大觀是能引起讀者的注目但是在内容上也該力求充實中國的新文藝作品眞正偉大的具有最高藝術價値的在中國文壇的現勢之下是未曾產生的這並不是是餒的話在目前充滿着濫汚作品的文學出版物中是可以採用客觀的藝術眼光來估量它底價値本身的在另一方面讀者所具的鑑賞力是已提高到某種程度那種含有低級趣味迎合一般普通心理的無聊作品在稍稍對於文藝有嗜好者就不願閱讀所謂有藝術成分的高級文藝這般讀者是最爲歡迎的但是這裏所述的高級文藝在中國最近的文壇上却是很少見或許可以說是還未曾發現即使現行的刋物上有時不過刋一兩篇比較偉大的作品換言之也是貧弱得很的在我們所感覺得是讀者們鑑賞力的逐漸增高這實是促進文藝作品向前進突進的一種良好的現象不能說將來的中國文壇所產生的文藝作品是即能超於西洋的文藝作品之上如果永此作忠實藝術的態度來努力文藝創造美麗的至上的藝術之花那麽中國的新文藝至少可以放射光明的異彩有比較偉大的作品呈顯於我們讀者之前的或許這種眞義的希望在不久之後即可實現的吧</p>
<p>其次要使新文藝的盛興而質最上是有所可觀在乎各種刋物選載文藝作品採取嚴格主義同時並進的是對於文藝作品作嚴正的忠實的批判這都是促使文學作品向前進展的一條進路在目前一般大小刋物選載文藝作品已向這條進路來鑑定文藝作品的本質是一種値得注意的良好的表象</p>
<p>草野周刋在數量上它是薄薄的一張實際它是在當今文藝末潮之下前進着的一種刋物内容是一期一期地加以革新大有不使其中文字成爲空虚無力的决心確在努力文藝運動是該具有向上的精神的倘若使之成爲一種沉悶的没有生氣的刋物寗可不必向文藝這方面發展豎横對於中國荒蕪的文藝園囿中是不能有所貢獻徒費着一番心血的灌溉草野在我們讀了終覺得這般主辦者是向前努力着的是一羣忠實文藝的園丁在以心血的給晶灌溉着荒蕪的文藝園囿其中的作品在數量上因爲篇幅的關係當然不能儘量容納但是在質量上我們可以顯然地看出他們是採取嚴格主義很少是濫汚從事的在前所出版的創作專號是給予我們一種極好的印象在最近創作界中是略爲司以算是有所貢獻雖然其中的作品是不能推崇爲成熟的已達藝術最高峰的接着所貢獻於文壇之前的是詩歌專號詩歌依照現勢的情狀之下是該加以鼓吹的使之在最近的將來放有閃燦的異彩這是根有希望而且是可能現實的事因爲詩歌的藝術技巧是隨了讀者的鑑賞力的增高漸漸地而健全起來　於圓熟的地步在内容上是採取不平凡的題材在形式上是有一種新的表現這實値得我們加以叙述的與諸「五四」時代那種詩的技巧互相比擬顯然地已有突異的進展即如這期的草野專號裏所包含的詩篇都是走問詩歌的新路是現在中國詩壇上很少見的力作</p>
<p>計有六首詩一首散文詩如余珊女士的「謝辭」王鐵華的「當晨曦冲出了地平綫」鄒枋的「從墓隙窺覘墓裏」宓羅的「我等候着你已中宵」王墳的「阿走失了路的小羊何拂的「殘稿」徐炎的「夢底憧憬」查理斯的「憶友人」湯增敭的「詩人的自畫像」等這裏每一首詩篇都可以代表每一個作者的作風而且在此更能看出詩歌中所具的幾種形式以及今後詩歌該走的新路</p>
<p>最先値得提及的確是余珊女士的「謝辭」這位女詩人似乎在草野上初次露着頭角的但是她底詩作已有這樣的圓熟可喜委實使我們應引爲讚許的那熱情的奔放眞不啻拜倫所表現的那樣熱烈大膽的描寫是勝過冰心女詩人所刻畫着的母愛在詩的組織上是異常的圓熟含意的深沉用字的的當修詞的講究都爲最近詩擅上很少見的佳作其中有兩節在我是以爲表露得最眞切的現徴引於下以供讀者的吟味例以！</p>
<p>你要深深地明瞭詩人的心吧</p>
<p>將好比捉摸深淵裏旋躍的魚</p>
<p>曾火山噴燄般燃燒—爲了你</p>
<p>曾黃河决口地奔流—爲了你</p>
<p>我想愛你我想戀你</p>
<p>只是只是啊我怕你少着勇氣的朋友</p>
<p>將空費了我底眞情摰意</p>
<p>你愛我—愛我的美麗容貌</p>
<p>你纞我—戀我的靑春時期</p>
<p>敎我怎樣愛你怎樣戇你</p>
<p>不健全的意志正飄着風狂</p>
<p>靑春誰長保得這樣黃昏底細雨</p>
<p>這樣充溢着愛的熱情用眞摰的詩筆將它刻畫下來尤其是出諸一個少女的心如値得我們讚許和推崇的它所表現的藝術的技巧又是那麽的純熟却是不易見到的事差不多余詩都緊張而有力最後她以重疊之句作結構更能看出作者是趨向詩歌的新路不沉入流俗的漩渦和那種舊的技巧可以互相比擬的這</p>
<p>也是這詩唯一的特點同時作者的意識是向上着的在這詩裏是找不出所謂詩人多傷感的痕跡來</p>
<p>王鐵華的「當晨曦冲出了地平線」是一首激壯的民族主義的詩歌在形式上是絶端走向了一條新路爲任何詩人所未表現過的換言之即是具有新的風格新的技巧的詩篇由此也可到民族主義詩歌在技術上的進展</p>
<p>當晨曦冲出了地平線</p>
<p>露珠便紅透了我倆的脚尖</p>
<p>同聲仰嘯着宿雲片片地亂飛</p>
<p>呀悲壯的河山永彪着光榮的一戰</p>
<p>美麗的詩境啊爲甚忘了行吟</p>
<p>血花的飛迸啊怎敵得豪邁的詩魂</p>
<p>加緊您火烈的節拍吧</p>
<p>求民族的生不辭我們底死</p>
<p>這新頴的表現雄壯的氣魄都顯現着民族主義的詩歌已趨向於藝術的高峰比其它一般的詩歌都屬偉大極値得我們底注意</p>
<p>鄒枋的詩又代表一種風格也是一首力作</p>
<p>何拂的殘稿是字句整齊的詩在中國詩壇曾風行一時的查理斯的「憶友人」一首是五四時代詩歌的雛體頗値得我們的注意湯增敭的「詩人自畫象」是一首美的散文詩其它王墳徐炎宓羅的詩都値一讀</p>
<p>這期詩歌專號内容極爲充實可以見到各種新詩的體式同時又可以指示我們明白新詩該走的那條新的進路這極得推許的</p>

<p>— 安平</p>
<p>四「我的潔瑪」</p>
<p>二號早上起來吃了一些東西上下關中國旅行社去辦妥了車票之後我們便打算上中山陸去謁墓</p>
<p>我這次所以願意在南京停留一大半的原因就是想去謁一謁中山陸還記得在五卅慘案的那一年我最後一次離開南京的時候心想要再這末來一次南京總不是怎難的事然而人事浮沉霎一霎就是整整的六年要是這次經過南京不停一停則誰說得定要等到那一年我再會到南京呢所以我不願意敢棄這「順便」</p>
<p>他們聽見我說想上中山陵都贊成祗就浩不能成告假所以没去</p>
<p>飯吃好已經一點鐘了我們一起走到神廟口去僱車車主似乎是要了三塊半我們這裏還價兩塊</p>
<p>不知怎樣我忽而想騎馬熹也願意鴻渚也願意我問他們有没騎過他們都說没有我說我也不曾騎過馬於是大家流露出一個措然但是年靑的人有的就是勇敢好奇新鮮活跳没一個會騎不要緊祇要高興不是勉强</p>
<p>然而馬太貴了兩塊錢一個鐘頭上中山陵來回三個鐘頭都不夠那末我們三個人在一起不是要二十多塊嗎要騎彷彿價錢又賺大不騎心上又不甘心在那時騎馬的心眞熱就是車主願意兩塊錢僱一輛車給我們彷彿我也不願意似的然而價錢相差太遠了事實似要已經到了無所希望了的地步而天天居然會帮起忙來帮什麽不慌我告訴你</p>
<p>原來因爲我們要僱馬不知怎樣一個誤會兩家馬行賭起醋來這好爲賭醋有一家願以以一塊錢一個鐘頭的價錢租了三匹馬給我們</p>
<p>三個人大家從没騎過馬大家也都没一絲絲關於騎馬的常識大家想「我不要走第一個我也不要走最末個最好是當中」</p>
<p>到頭還是我走在第一個雖然隔别了南京六七年大致的路我自然還熟過浮橋過大行宮心頭也未嘗不有些胆小一上了中山大道便彷彿壯了胆了馬鞭經過一種極優美的勢子在空中一兜接着在馬的臀部上閃電般抽過於是以一種最靈巧最敏捷的脚步那隻長着一身雪片似的白馬開始飛奔起來像一個極其熟練的騎手一樣我一隻手握着轡繩一隻手揑着鞭子以最適當的重心與最優美的姿態將自己的身子坐穏着嘴裏吹着一種口哨兩旁的抖和人祇見向後面退風微微地在我臉上拂過没有一絲凉意一種健康的活潑的靑春的感覺像電一般的在我血管裏通過</p>
<p>二十多里的路程祗一口氣彷彿還没滿四十分鐘就衝到了一座那樣大的氣概的墓陵便展現在我眼前我下了馬將它帶到一塊空地上繫住預備等熹和鴻渚到了一起上去但等了二十多分鐘始終還不見他們的影子我眞不再有這個耐性了</p>
<p>我懐着一顆極嚴穆的心和舒緩的步子走上去走在石級上也時常回過頭來望一望像一張畫片般的山樹一條白淺的中山路一個黑圈的城墻和城墻裏的黑點「眞是那樣一個氣概喲」我心上領略着走進禮門要簽名我以最榮幸最驕傲最鄭重的態度在簽名簿上寫下了這三個字</p>
<p>「儲安平」</p>
<p>我在陵上徘徊了長久心像死去了般的沈靜嚴穆佔據了我全部的意識我眞想坐在石級上像摸不着一絲邊際地悠思一回</p>
<p>去到那時他們才來熹時常想和我說話我不願意他擾亂我平和的情緒說「請原諒我一切留待下去了再說吧</p>
<p>陵脚下張着許多白布棚像露宿的童子軍營一樣原來都是賣茶賣咖啡的我們用了三杯可可</p>
<p>那時紫金山巓已經爲一片迷濛所罩是有雨來了我們得趕緊上馬趕回城靈谷寺都没來及去</p>
<p>歸去時在馬上是比來時更熟練更老手了雨幸而没有大下祇一些濛濛然而有這一些濛濛比没有還好你想寄在馬上心境是那樣的闰暢和愉快再來一些濛雨眞是夠神仙的了</p>
<p>到校後熹對我說了一許多頌揚的話這一些話在他倒是出乎本心的不過他眞是那樣一位說起話未歡喜說得分量過度的人然而平時不很願竟得到他的稱頌的我那時他說了這一句話却使我</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>歡喜透到心他說的一句話是</p>
<p>「我看見你騎在馬上的姿態那樣的優美英俊自然使我像做夢地連想起了屠格湼夫的春潮裏的沙寗」</p>
<p>謝謝他這句話雖然使我聽了一駭但確也高興不但高興而且感激他的那樣認眞</p>
<p>唉沙寗我怎樣能有像沙寗一樣秀美的身材好看的面貌一雙淺籃的眼睛溫和的神色全黃的頭髮細膩的紅白相間的皮　最招人愛的那特别的自然的愉快的眞摯的坦白的初看似乎有些優氣的表情孩子似的微笑天眞健康溫柔溫柔温柔……唉沙寗我怎能及得上如屠格湼夫所寫出來的這樣一個沙寗呢</p>
<p>然而老實的熹姪眞是那樣一本正經地說說他眞的見了騎在馬上的我時就是毫不知覺地那樣連想着啊</p>
<p>是的假若我是沙寗我是呌作第米特利·巴夫洛淮支·沙寗樣的人話那末求求上帝不要使我遇見那樣的女人像瑪利亞·尼古拉夫納·波羅助夫那樣的女人要是眞的遇見了她那末由她是有着多厚多漂亮的頭髮多可愛的頸子多美的肩膀多苗條的身材多令人心醉的態使人一見要發狂而且說一那一個女子向着一個人走過來的時候好像是把一個人一生的幸福完全帶了過來迎接他」的步態多柔和的聲音又長又紅又潤濕的嘴層微笑時的酒渦那親暱的似是柔和的聲音……以及如普希金所說的無論誰遇着好都要呆呆的站住爲之神往但是她并不是站在「美的神龕」之前而是站在一個花朶盛開魔力正盛的半俄國半吉普西的婦女的魔力之下使人爲她靜立着出神决不會覺得不情願樣的魔力……而我我還是願意守着我的潔瑪跪在他的脚下將臉按在她的腰上這樣說</p>
<p>「我的潔瑪你放心我永久是你的」</p>

<p>Crowded Audience, Disrupted Order</p>
<p>Beiping: In the North China Ball Games, the senior football match between Beiping and Tianjin started at 3:00 PM. The Beiping team won with a score of 3-2, but the referee blew the whistle to stop the game ten minutes early due to misreading the clock. The Tianjin team was dissatisfied and the Tianjin Sports Federation has filed a complaint with the organizing committee, which is still in dispute. The senior basketball game between the Tianjin and Beiping teams at 4:00 PM was announced to be stopped due to the crowded audience and the inability to maintain order. The women's basketball game also dispersed without a result due to the chaotic order on the field. Organizing Committee members Zhang Boling, Yuan Dunli, and others held an emergency meeting and decided to continue the competition on the morning of the 30th, limiting the number of tickets to 5,000. At 11:00 AM tomorrow, Yu Fengzhi will still be invited to present the awards. The players from the various provinces and cities plan to tour scenic spots. The Education Bureau has sent letters to the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, and other offices for introductions. Over 10,000 tickets were sold today. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Executive Yuan believes that the method of suppressing bandits by stopping the symptoms is to use military force, and the method of addressing the root cause is to use civilian corps. It is better to have the people defend themselves than to have soldiers defend the people. In recent years, communist bandits have been rampant in the seven provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. If we want to eradicate them at the root, it will be difficult to achieve results without organizing civilian corps and establishing Baojia. Therefore, the government specifically ordered the governments of the respective provinces to supervise and urge the counties to earnestly plan and establish defense corps in accordance with the County Defense Corps Law promulgated by the central government, and to complete the organization of the defense corps uniformly by August 1st. The government will use this to assess the performance of the provincial governments. (29th Dispatch)</p>

Irwin made a brief speech, stating that the leaders would gather to discuss the situation arising from the Legislative Assembly's rejection of the budget yesterday. He said that the members' attendance at the assembly despite the danger, allowing the proceedings of the Indian Parliament to not be interrupted, was deeply appreciated. After finishing his speech, he shook hands with each member one by one, and the crowd stood up and cheered repeatedly. Yesterday, the Legislative Assembly opposed the increase in income tax and surtax, so the budget was rejected. Irwin's successor is Viscount Willingdon, the former Governor-General of Canada.</p>

<p>Promulgates Emergency Decree</p>
<p>Deprives Citizens of Rights</p>
<p>Has Aroused Repercussions in Public Opinion</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th - The German government has issued an emergency decree temporarily depriving citizens of several fundamental rights, such as personal freedom, the sanctity of the home, the secrecy of mail, the rights of assembly and association, and private property. The purpose of this decree is to curb political riots, such as the recent conflicts between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 28th - The President's announcement this afternoon of a strict ban on political misconduct has aroused repercussions in public opinion. However, the views are extremely inconsistent. Some extremist newspapers point to the decree as the final struggle against the opposition party. Moderate newspapers are somewhat inclined towards the government and welcome the decree, saying that it is sufficient to show the government's determination to raise its political position, even temporarily depriving the people of freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly granted by the constitution. The Berlin Daily News stated that the decree is extremely rational, because in the past year, the number of lives lost due to politics reached more than 300, and if the government does not intervene in time this year, the number of deaths may exceed last year's number. According to a certain newspaper of the Conservative Party, the decree has sufficient theoretical basis, but some points seem excessive and the wording is too vague, making it easy for people to twist the meaning. The most important provision of the decree states that all political gatherings, whether indoors or outdoors, must be approved by the police authorities before they can be convened. Otherwise, all participants will be subject to heavy fines or suspended sentences. Newspapers that slander the government and government agencies may be ordered to suspend publication for eight weeks. If it is a periodical, the publication will be suspended for half a year. All notices, leaflets, and pamphlets must be approved by the police before distribution, and those who wantonly attack churches and religions must be severely punished. The last section is actually aimed at the Communist Party's anti-religious propaganda.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 28th - The President's decree strictly prohibiting political assembly now has its strength increased by President Hindenburg's praise of Brüning's remarks. When Chancellor Brüning reported to the President on the closing of Congress and the government's past and future policies, the President greatly praised Brüning and his colleagues for governing the country effectively and turning danger into safety. This praise was even published in the President's Office Gazette, which is an unprecedented event since the European War.</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Political Situations in Germany and Spain <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The political situations in various countries are different, and the strictness and leniency of government administrative methods must also be determined according to the needs of the people. If strictness is needed but leniency is shown, then the turmoil in the country will not be settled in the end. If leniency is needed but strictness is shown, then it will be easier to provoke change. Now, I will use the affairs of Germany and Spain to prove this. Since the power of extremist factions in Germany has been increasing day by day, acts of violence by the people have been frequently discovered. According to investigations, more than 300 people lost their lives due to political disputes in the past year alone. If it is not stopped in time this year, the number of deaths may exceed that number. Therefore, Germany today is in need of strictness. Therefore, although the German government issued an extremely severe order prohibiting political misconduct, only extremist newspapers expressed dissatisfaction, while other moderate newspapers expressed great welcome, and even said that this move shows the government's determination to raise its political position, even temporarily depriving the freedom of assembly and speech granted by the constitution. It can be seen that Germany needs strictness, so there is no major backlash and there is even praise. The Spanish people have been longing for a republic for a long time, and they are apprehensive about the government's restoration of autocratic politics and its oppression of the people with cruel means. They hope that the government will adapt to the trend of the times. General Berenguer's declaration also stated that the government should quickly return constitutional freedoms to the people as the only way to maintain peace. Spain today is in need of leniency. However, its government dismissed Berenguer from his position by severe means and sentenced him to two months in prison. The anger of the Spanish people will inevitably be even greater, and the revolutionary atmosphere will inevitably be even stronger. This is also predictable. Because the government's behavior is contrary to the needs of the people, the adverse consequences are naturally to be expected.</p>

<p>tax agreement had caused a shock. The agreement itself is a serious event, but the procedures used are a very serious problem because the methods used are outside the cooperative policy that it previously proposed. Several senators spoke, all saying that Britain's hesitation about this agreement could be compared to the hesitation in 1914, and the price would be extremely harsh. Since 1918, nothing has been more harmful to peace than this agreement. Briand replied that there are no concrete developments at present, only draft agreements and preliminary talks. If he is in office, he will ensure that Germany and Austria do not carry out their intention to undermine their external obligations.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 28th - It is now only two weeks away from the scheduled date of the general election, but doubts have arisen as to whether the election can actually be held. Although the government is doing its best to ease public sentiment, the undercurrent has actually spread throughout the country, so Republican leader Zamora's statement that the people's thinking has been controlled by the revolutionary tide is very insightful. However, rumors circulated among the people from Friday to Saturday last week that there would be drastic changes in the political situation and that the dictatorship system would be rebuilt. It has now been proven that these rumors are unfounded. Perhaps the government is well aware that such</p>
<p>plans will further push the political situation into an unmanageable state and has invisibly eliminated the plan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 28th - General Berenguer published an article yesterday saying that Spain is determined not to tolerate the dictatorship system again.

<p>New York News: Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, came to New York to negotiate with the Federal Reserve authorities and local bankers on the issue of gold and silver, which caused a lot of attention in the US financial community. The main topic of negotiation is to use cooperative methods to prevent gold from flowing out of the UK, but it is heard that Norman may also discuss stabilizing silver prices and other international economic issues. The International Bank, located in Switzerland, is scheduled to hold its first general meeting in May this year and will also discuss these issues. It is expected that after President Hoover, who is currently traveling in the West Indies, returns to New York,</p>

<p>New York News: According to the Federal Reserve Bank, the amount of gold coins concentrated in the United States at this time is unprecedented in any country since civilization. The current depression in the world is mostly due to this. It is estimated that the total gold reserves in the United States reach 4,685,000,000 yuan, which is twice the amount of gold reserves in France and seven times the amount of gold reserves in the UK. This gold reserve in the United States has exceeded the total amount of all paper money circulating in the country. At present, there are about 11,000,000,000 yuan in gold coins in the world, of which the United States accounts for 42.5% and France accounts for 20 and 1/5%. In the past ten years, the Federal Reserve Bank has tried to prevent the import of gold into the United States, but the result has only been a continuous inflow of gold. (World)</p>

<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The opposition party once questioned Inoue, the Minister of Finance, in the Diet whether the estimated revenue in the budget for Showa 6 was too high. The Minister of Finance replied that the tax revenue would decrease by about 110 million yuan and other revenue would decrease by about 155 million yuan. The estimate was absolutely not too high. However, according to the recent actual results, it is difficult to obtain 8 million yuan per month from customs duties. In addition, the liquor tax has decreased unexpectedly due to the downturn in the brewing industry. There is no other way than to conserve the expenditure budget. However, because the government has strongly argued in the Diet, it is inconvenient to openly conserve again. The authorities of the Ministry of Finance are currently secretly requesting all provinces to conserve forcibly. The opposition party is paying close attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Origin of Ocean Currents <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>New York News: Dr. Youzhi, a geologist at Shaw University in the United States, published his theory on the origin of ocean currents, saying that the north-south movement of ocean currents between the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans is always orderly. This is because seawater from the tropical seabed near the equator, through the deep holes of the seabed, passes through the bottom of the land, and then flows out of the ocean from the holes in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. That is, in tropical areas, seawater flows into the deep holes in the seabed, and in polar regions, it flows out of the seabed like a fountain. From these two effects, ocean currents flow from north to south or from south to north. The evidence for this is that oceanographers have measured that there are 57 large holes in the seabed of tropical regions that are more than 18,000 feet deep. (World)</p>

<p>Telegram from Fuzhou: To the Shenbao Newspaper Office,</p>
<p>Regarding Lin Zhong, Sa Fuchou, Qiu Zhenwu, and others from Fujian Province, who last year, according to one report, rebelled with arms, illegally arrested provincial committee members, and caused the death of Chen Naiyuan's wife, a warrant for their arrest has been issued by the Central Government. Now, upon hearing of their capture in Shanghai, it truly gladdens the people. These criminals possess extraordinary abilities. Besides sending a telegram requesting their swift transfer to the Central Government for just punishment, we earnestly implore a joint effort to uphold national discipline and prevent cunning escapes.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Chen Lin Yuxin.</p>
<p>Telegram from Shenyang: To All Newspaper Offices,</p>
<p>Recalling that since the beginning of our Party's establishment, it has been a time of extreme hardship and danger, with powerful nations invading and the country's situation precarious, we deeply appreciate that our late Premier Sun Yat-sen initiated the Three Principles of the People, fought for over forty years, and advanced valiantly, with the whole country following his lead. The foundation of the nation is now consolidated, and the anticipation for unification and peace throughout the land is high. Our association, fortunately at this moment, is fully organized. Recalling that the comrades in this province have been quietly working diligently for years, their love, sincerity, and dedication have benefited the nation and the local communities. Remembering the past, we are pleased to merge and will carefully consider the end from the beginning, daring not to slacken. What should be solemnly declared are three points:</p>
<p>The first priority in national construction is the people's livelihood. "With the country secure, the people are at peace" is an age-old saying. Our nation's rural economy is increasingly declining, and industry and commerce are becoming increasingly distressed. When competing with other nations for survival, we constantly feel inferior. Furthermore, imperialists, with their superior economic and military power, exploit unequal treaties as excuses to encircle and scheme against us, never relenting. If our Party does not strive to remedy this, I fear we will be engulfed and drowned. From now on, Party comrades should delve deep among the people, acting as their vanguard, implementing the Party's program and policies, actively building, relieving the people's suffering, striving for national survival, securing internal stability, resisting external aggression, setting clear goals, persevering without error, and striving for success. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Ideological complexity is rampant today. To save China and advance towards the Greater Harmony, our Party's principles are the revolutionary standard. As for various conflicting theories, they are like trying to stop boiling water by pouring it out. Our Party's efforts in Liaoning have been long-standing, but our organization is incomplete, and discipline is lax. We have only maintained a broad-mindedness without achieving transformative effects. Hereafter, all compatriots in the province should collectively uphold our Party's principles to seek China's freedom and equality, avoiding deviations that lead astray. Know that there is no other party besides this one, and no factions within it. We must reject superficiality and prevent weeds from disrupting the seedlings. We must discard the old and embrace the new, and walk together on the path of prosperity. This is the second point.</p>
<p>The period of political tutelage has just begun, and there are countless aspects to manage. At the initial stage of implementation, careful planning is essential. If Party affairs agencies are seen as government offices to interfere in politics and pursue private gain, it will not only easily breed corruption but also lose the people's trust. Last winter's Fourth Plenary Session clearly issued admonitions with righteous words and serious tone. From now on, Party comrades should uphold the spirit of saving the world and the nation, establish themselves as individuals, examine themselves, strive to be complete persons, abide by Party discipline, and be loyal servants of the people. They must neither be tainted by accumulated habits and be criticized by others nor engage in empty talk that does not contribute to practical achievements. They must strive to integrate comrades and compatriots into the Party's ideals so that the great cause of national construction can be completed sooner. This is the third point.</p>
<p>The association assesses the urgent needs and firmly believes that our Party is essential to saving the nation, that saving the nation is essential to survival, that striving for national revolution is essential to protecting our nation, and that struggling through difficulties and doubts is essential to eliminating reactionary forces. We hope that our comrades and compatriots will be of one heart and one mind, striving together diligently. With sincerity, even metal and stone can be opened. The success of the revolution truly depends on it.</p>

<p>Telegram from Customs: To All Newspaper Offices,</p>
<p>An investigation reveals that Shangcheng County has suffered repeated losses in recent years. Communist bandits in the area have established Soviet reactionary governments and Red Army headquarters and other organizations, expanding propaganda, disrupting order, massacring innocent people, and coercing farmers and laborers. Even the worthless people have been indoctrinated by the bandits. Wealthy households have long moved far away, and the people are in a state of panic and extreme danger. According to successive accounts from fleeing refugees, the burning, killing, looting, and rape are extremely cruel, and the devastation is heartbreaking to hear. Our association previously allocated 3,000 yuan for emergency relief and is in the process of dispatching personnel to distribute it, but it is merely a drop in the bucket and cannot fully save the people. Such areas urgently require special relief to win back the people's hearts and prevent them from being exploited by the communists. We have long admired your association's benevolence in considering the hunger and drowning of others as your own responsibility. We earnestly request that you sympathize with the people of Shangcheng who have long been in deep water and fire, and who are craning their necks in anticipation of rescue. Please promptly provide relief to save the people from disaster. We await your command with utmost anticipation.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Zhang Fang of the Henan Province Relief Association.</p>

<p>Ma Chaojun's Report:</p>
<p>In brief, today is the memorial day of March 29th, which is the most glorious event in the revolutionary history of twenty years ago. Twenty years ago, our nation was a nation oppressed by both imperialism and the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Premier Sun, in order to seek national independence, called on comrades at home and abroad to create this revolutionary cause. Although the March 29th revolution failed, the nation was awakened and the world was shocked, hence the success of the Wuchang Uprising, which was the price paid by the March 29th martyrs. The process of the March 29th comrades sacrificing themselves for righteousness is now briefly recounted on this occasion. Before March 29th, Premier Sun failed in his efforts to mobilize the New Army and went overseas to raise funds, leaving Huang Xing, Zhao Boxian, Hu Hanmin, and others to guard the Hong Kong headquarters. The comrades all worked separately, with propaganda and mobilization being conducted in secret, and expenses being borne by the comrades themselves. By February, the situation became increasingly urgent, and Manchu officials in Guangzhou were arresting Party members everywhere. At that time, the comrades believed that if they did not launch an uprising quickly, the opportunity would be lost. They decided to launch the uprising on February 15th, but the mobilization of all parties was not yet complete, and the purchased firearms had not yet arrived, so they postponed it to March 15th. At that time, comrades from overseas also gathered one after another, but because the Hong Kong government and the Manchu officials in Guangzhou were heavily guarded, it was difficult to act quickly. It was postponed to March 25th when the place where the comrades in Guangzhou hid their military weapons was discovered by Manchu officials. As the opportunity became more urgent, Huang Xing decided in Guangzhou on the 28th that the next day (29th) at 3 pm, the comrades would carry pistols and bombs and advance towards various government offices, taking the blowing of the deer horn as a signal. Huang led a part of the troops to attack the governor's office. Naval Admiral Li Zhun sent Wen Dexiong to lead a battalion of soldiers to reinforce the governor's office. When they arrived at Shuangmend, they met Fang Shengdong. Wen had a relationship with our party, and he was asking Fang about the situation. Fang mistakenly thought that Wen was leading troops to attack, so he preemptively attacked and wiped out Wen. At that time, all four cities had revolutionary flags, and there was great chaos in the city, but the revolutionary army was ultimately outnumbered and failed to achieve a complete success. Huang was injured in the attack on the governor's office and fled from the East Gate, fortunately escaping. At 5 am the next morning, Zhao Boxian led several hundred reinforcements from Hong Kong by boat to the province. Knowing that the event had failed, he rushed to Henan and embraced Huang Xing and cried bitterly. In fact, more than just seventy-two people died in this uprising, but only seventy-two martyrs are known today. After the failure of the March 29th uprising, Manchu officials sent out detectives to search for revolutionary party members, and the comrades all knew that Guangzhou was prepared. Therefore, they changed their strategy and went to various provinces to mobilize, which led to the Wuchang Uprising and the national response, and the national revolution succeeded. Premier Sun said that if the revolution does not succeed, then we will die for the cause. Now that the revolutionary cause has not yet been fully completed, we should commemorate the martyrs by following Premier Sun's teachings, continuing the legacy of the martyrs, and working hard to build the nation. This is the meaning of commemorating the martyrs today.</p>
<p>After the report, mournful music was played and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Capital Circles:</p>
<p>On the same morning, at 9 o'clock, various circles in the capital held a grand meeting to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs in the Nanjing City Party Headquarters Auditorium. Over a hundred people attended, including City Executive Committee members Xiao Jishan, Lai Lian, and representatives from various organizations and groups. Chairman Xiao Jishan gave a speech after the ceremony, briefly stating that before the Xinhai Revolution, China was subject to imperialist aggression from the outside and the autocratic rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty from the inside. The revolutionary martyrs of our party deeply knew that revolution was necessary to save the country, so they spared no effort to promote revolution at the cost of everything. At that time, I do not know how many comrades sacrificed themselves, especially in the March 29th campaign. Their spirit of sacrificing themselves for righteousness was enough to sway the public opinion at that time. Therefore, not many months after the March 29th campaign, the Wuchang Uprising succeeded. Today, commemorating the martyrs should know that the sacrifices of the martyrs were entirely for the country and the nation. We should eliminate selfishness, learn from the spirit of sacrifice of the martyrs, work hard to overthrow imperialism, abolish unequal treaties, and seek national construction. Only in this way can commemoration be meaningful. Then Lai Lian gave a speech, briefly stating that the success of the Xinhai Revolution was entirely the result of the sacrifices of the martyrs. Today, commemorating the martyrs should be based on the spirit of sacrifice of the martyrs, work hard to complete the unfinished will of the martyrs, and eliminate corrupt and degenerate elements in order to be worthy of the martyrs. After the speech, slogans were shouted and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Panchen Lama's Representative Reports on Sino-Tibetan Relations <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Losang Nangyal, the chief of staff of the Panchen Lama, and Senator Jin Xiaoben, representatives of the Panchen Lama, came to Beijing from Ujimqin Banner in Inner Mongolia to report on the Panchen Lama's plan to come to Beijing for an audience. They have already visited the Presidential Office and ministers of various Yuan and departments, submitting letters and completing negotiations. They are now waiting for the Panchen Lama's telegram to arrive in Shenyang, preparing to go to Shenyang to report on their visit to Beijing and then accompany the Panchen Lama south.</p>
<p>The representatives also hosted a reception for the press at Jinlingchun at noon on the 29th, attended by more than 50 people, and reported in detail on Sino-Tibetan relations. Their statement was as follows:</p>
<p>"Shun exiled the Sanmiao people to Sanwei. Sanwei is present-day Tibet. The so-called Tubo people are descendants of the Sanmiao. In the Zhou Dynasty, they were called the Western Rong. When King Ping moved east, they had contact with the Central Plains. In the Han Dynasty, they were called the Western Qiang. Emperor Wu ordered them to live in the borderlands. During the reign of Emperor Huai of Jin, they once lived in Chang'an. In the Kaihuang period of the Sui Dynasty, they destroyed the Shi Guhun, and the Tuoba clan began to establish their kingdom. In the Tang Dynasty, they were erroneously called Tubo. At that time, their Zanpu Songtsen Gampo was quite strong and repeatedly invaded the Tang border, seeking marriage with the Tang Dynasty. In the fifteenth year of Zhenguan, Princess Wencheng married Tibet. At that time, the Tang Emperor and the Tibetan Zanpu each led their ministers to slaughter livestock, inserted blood, and announced to the gods of heaven, earth, sun, moon, mountains, rivers, and the state, establishing a great alliance, carving stones and erecting monuments in the Grand Assembly Hall. The two countries will forever abide by their oaths, help each other, and fulfill the duties of nephews and uncles. In the first year of Jingyun, Emperor Ruizong again married Princess Jincheng to the Tibetan Zanpu. The escorts of the two princesses numbered tens of thousands, all marrying Tibetan women, and the friendship was extraordinary. During the Song Dynasty, they lived in peace. In the first year of Baoyou during the reign of Emperor Xianzong of the Yuan Dynasty, the Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Marshal's Office of the Six Pacification Commissioners of the Tubo were established in Hezhou. Emperor Shizu took Pagpa as his teacher and granted him the title of Grand Treasure Dharma King, ordering him to create the Mongolian script. In the sixth year of Zhiyuan, the Pacification Commissioner's Office of U-Tsang was re-established, dividing its territory into counties and ordering Pagpa to lead it. His disciples were mostly Situ, Sikong, and Dukes, all wearing gold and jade seals. This is the ancestor of the Red Sect. Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty granted Namgyal Palzang of U-Tsang the title of Grand Master of the Flourishing Buddha Treasure Kingdom, in charge of the entire territory of U-Tsang. In the third year of Yongle, the title of Grand Treasure Dharma King and the Tathagata of Buddhist Exposition was granted to Khalima of U-Tsang. His disciples were granted the titles of Dharma Kings such as Mahayana and Mahakaruna, as well as Bodhisattvas who expounded, transformed, protected, and assisted in teaching and accumulated merit. In the tenth year of Yongle, the Grand Master of the Western Sky Buddha and nine to eighteen Grand Masters were also granted.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of Yongle, Tsongkhapa was born in Xining, Qinghai. He initially studied the Red Sect, but later made major reforms and became the ancestor of the Yellow Sect. He ordered his two great disciples, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, to reincarnate in each generation to govern religion. In the early Qing Dynasty, in the seventh year of Chongde, the Panchen Lama sent representatives to Shengjing to offer local products. Emperor Taizong treated them generously, granting them the title of Vajra Master and decreeing that the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama, when young, should follow the military and when older, should study the classics, treating them with the etiquette of a teacher. Before long, the power of Tsangpa Gyawe became strong, unifying the front and back of Tibet, worshiping the Red Sect Lama Taranatha, and suppressing the Yellow Sect's Fourth Dalai Lama, Yonten Gyatso, and prohibiting its re-establishment. At that time, Gushri Khan of Qinghai, who believed in the Yellow Sect, heard of the unrest in Tibet and sent people to Tibet to investigate, encountering the Fourth Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, who knew of the imminent demise of the Yellow Sect. Gushri Khan then ordered Güshi Tenzin Chögyal to lead 3,000 soldiers into Tibet to join the Panchen Lama to quell the Tibetan rebellion and re-establish the Fifth Dalai Lama, Lobsang Gyatso. Gushri Khan reported the facts of pacifying Tibet to the Qing court. Emperor Shizu sent officials to urge the Panchen Lama to come, but the Panchen Lama, being nearly a hundred years old, was inconvenient to travel far, claiming that he and the Dalai Lama were equal in character and learning, despite their age difference. He instructed the Dalai Lama to come to the mainland immediately. Therefore, the Dalai Lama traveled to Beijing, China in the ninth year of Shunzhi. In the fifty-fifth year of Kangxi, China pacified the Zunghar invasion of Tibet and erected a monument in the Grand Assembly Hall. In the seventh year of Yongzheng, China pacified the rebellion of Tibetan minister Arbu-Ba, punishing the chief culprits after investigating. Lang-A was initially left to serve as the vice resident minister, leading 2,000 soldiers from Sichuan and Shaanxi to be stationed in the front and back of Tibet to protect the religion. In the fifteenth year of Qianlong, China executed Polo-Nai County King Zhulmo Tedan for disturbing Tibet, robbing and killing the resident commander Fu Qing and others, knowing that Tibet's politics and religion could not be separated. It was then stipulated that the Tibetan king would be selected from among the Panchen Lama, the Dalai Lama, and the four great Hutuktu, and traditional inheritance was not allowed. Another 1,500 soldiers were added to guard Tibet. Twenty years later, China pacified Yili for Tibet, allowing Tibet to be forever free from the Zunghar threat. Forty-five years later, the Sixth Panchen Lama came to China to celebrate Emperor Gaozong's birthday, passing away due to smallpox at the Yellow Temple. Fifty-seven years later, the Gurkha forcefully invaded Tibet, occupying the western territory. China sent Fukangan and Hailancha to lead troops to recapture the lost territory of Tibet. The troops arrived at the Gurkha capital, and the Gurkhas, in fear, surrendered, stipulating a tribute every five years. From then on, Fukangan, under the command of the Qing court, together with the Sichuan governor and the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama, stipulated the etiquette for the resident ministers, treating them equally with the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, and determining the official system and tribute system for the front and back of Tibet, as well as all tax matters, and comprehensively planning national defense and military system, as well as protecting the indigenous military quotas in the front and back of Tibet. All military expenses were paid by the national treasury. Sichuan paid an annual subsidy of more than one hundred thousand taels of silver, which was part of the expenses for the resident officials and soldiers in Tibet. Political power belonged to the Tibetan king, and religious power belonged to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. The front and back of Tibet did not govern each other, each governing itself. All matters were directly discussed with the resident ministers. Military and diplomatic affairs were discussed by the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, the three major monasteries, and the resident ministers. When necessary, instructions were sought from the Chinese government. The above-mentioned friendly relations between China and Tibet can be imagined. Therefore, the Tibetan people, all those over the age of thirty, still look east, hoping to restore the old friendship between China and Tibet. Throughout the generations, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama have assisted each other and have had no problems. The front and back of Tibet are like one family, without dividing borders. Unexpectedly, since the second year of the Republic of China, communication between China and Tibet has been interrupted, and the feelings of both sides cannot be expressed. The Panchen Lama believes that Tibet has been repeatedly oppressed by strong neighbors for hundreds of years, and has been protected from destruction by China's strength. As for the salaries and food for the soldiers stationed in Tibet, as well as various items for almsgiving, China has spent millions of taels of silver annually. Even during the British invasion of Tibet in the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, China paid the war expenses. Without boasting or seeking favors, recalling the past and thinking about the present, the good relationship is still vivid. Not forgetting China's actual benefits, in the winter of the twelfth year, he came to the mainland in person, not afraid of the difficulties and obstacles, to express his unwavering loyalty. At that time, the military was restless, and there was no way to appeal. He traveled extensively through the provinces of Zhili, Fengtian, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, as well as various leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia, chanting scriptures and expounding religions. Time passed quickly. Now, the revolution has succeeded, the north and south are unified, and the national government has no worries at home and can plan to consolidate the borders of the entire nation. The joy can be imagined. It is also heard that envoys between China and Tibet are traveling back and forth, and Tibet has sent plenipotentiary representatives to Beijing to participate in the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and is preparing to participate in the National Tibetan Conference. This is even more gratifying. Therefore, it is planned to come to the capital in the shortest possible time to listen to the good news between China and Tibet, hoping that the national territory will be as solid as a rock and that the happiness of the Tibetan people will be increased and the relationship between China and Tibet will be restored. Therefore, these unworthy ones are sent to Beijing in advance to negotiate everything, and now these unworthy ones have obtained the consent of the comrades of the national government to report to Shenyang soon, hoping that the Panchen Buddha will come soon and peacefully resolve the Tibetan affairs to fulfill his original intention of coming east."</p>
<h3 id="e39">Qingdao Native Product Merchants Still on Strike <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Party and Government Authorities Have Telegraphed the Central Government</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence:</p>
<p>The strike by Qingdao native product merchants has lasted for ten days without resolution. Laborers are unemployed, and commerce is stagnant, which is detrimental to the local community. The local Party and government authorities have tried to mediate, but the Inspection Bureau, due to its vested interests, refuses to abolish the inspection fees, leading to a stalemate. In view of this, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Steering Committee, requesting that it telegraph to the Central Government for permission to waive inspection fees to maintain the market and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The Municipal Steering Committee, upon receiving the petition, forwarded it to the Central Government yesterday for review and approval. The telegram reads as follows:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Central Executive Committee in Nanjing,</p>
<p>Qingdao native product merchants have repeatedly appealed to the Commodity Inspection Bureau regarding the inspection fees for peanuts and peanut oil sold domestically, but their appeals have not been approved. As a result, they have stopped trading, and the situation is urgent. Inspection of goods not intended for export is unnecessary and harmful to the people's livelihood. We earnestly request that your committee instruct the National Government to order the Ministry of Industry to allow exemptions from inspection fees to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. We await your response with utmost anticipation."</p>
<p>At the same time, the Municipal Government, based on the request of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, also telegraphed the Ministry of Industry today, requesting leniency for the merchants' difficulties and exemption from inspection fees. It also sent a letter to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, temporarily waiving inspection fees and awaiting resolution from the Ministry of Industry. The telegram to the Ministry of Industry is recorded below:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Ministry of Industry in Nanjing,</p>
<p>According to the Qingdao Municipal Chamber of Commerce's forwarding of the petition from the Guild of Stacks and Native Product Merchants, the merchants have requested exemption from inspection fees for native products sold domestically. Previously, the Ministry approved that all non-export goods, except for cotton and goods specifically approved by the Ministry, would be exempt from inspection fees, and the Inspection Bureau announced its implementation. Subsequently, the Bureau informed them that, according to the Ministry's telegram, peanuts and peanut oil, whether exported or sold domestically, would still be subject to inspection fees. Due to the conflicting instructions, the merchants are at a loss. Although they have telegraphed the Ministry to request the revocation of the order, the Bureau has decided to resume levying fees on March 16th. The merchants' business is difficult, and they have reluctantly stopped trading on the 17th, hoping to receive leniency. The merchants believe that raw rice and oil are related to the people's food, and inspection is cumbersome, and fees increase the price of food. Tianjin, Hankou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places do not levy inspection fees, so Qingdao cannot be an exception. We earnestly request that you telegraph to the Central Government for permission to waive inspection fees to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Please reply." (26th)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Shandong Salt Merchants in Great Panic <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Affected by New Policies</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence:</p>
<p>The new salt law has been passed by the Legislative Yuan for many years, and the abolishment of the salt concession system is imminent. Shandong Province, being a salt-producing region, has caused great panic among salt merchants. According to a certain salt merchant, after the Legislative Yuan decided on the new salt law, Commissioner Zhang Yun tried his best to reassure the salt merchants, saying that the implementation procedures of the new salt law were still many, and that it would not be implemented until two years later at the earliest. Everyone should not panic. But in fact, it has been greatly affected, even if they do not want to panic, they cannot. One reason is that the salt merchants rely entirely on selling salt, but recently a slogan has appeared in various counties - "Quickly eat cheap salt" - and it is everywhere. As a result, buyers are unwilling to buy in bulk, and sales have plummeted. Second, the salt merchants' business has been declining in recent years, relying entirely on borrowing money from banks. Now that it is time to sell ya salt (used for pickling toon) and sell jian salt (for pickling silkworm cocoons), the new salt law has suddenly been announced, and bankers are unwilling to lend money. Salt merchants are almost unable to transport salt. With these two major reasons, how can they not panic? Currently, salt merchants in this province plan to state their difficulties to the Central Government and request a postponement of the implementation of the new salt law to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<p>According to reports, the current annual sales of salt in this province is less than 300 permits (each permit transports 500 bags of salt, each bag weighing 100 catties). In the 13th year of the Republic of China, annual sales could reach 700 permits, more than double that amount. The biggest reason for this is that years of war have led to a proliferation of smuggled salt (soldiers transporting salt). Salt in the Jiaodong counties is sufficient for ten years, all of which was hoarded in previous years smuggled salt. In the thirteenth year, the number of salt merchants (those with permits) and traveling merchants (those who rent permits to transport salt) in this province was no less than 600 or 700. Because Zhang Zongchang handled salt permit registration, traveling merchants advanced the registration fees of more than 3 million for the salt merchants. Salt merchants, due to years of war and the disruption of salt sales, and the inability to rent out their permits, have had bankruptcies reaching more than 200. They could not repay the loans of the traveling merchants. The traveling merchants, due to the lack of salt sales and the bankruptcies of the salt merchants, have also had bankruptcies reaching more than 200. To this day, there are only about 100 salt merchants and traveling merchants. The three most famous companies, Dingli, have closed down. Dingxin has been affected by the Tengyi banditry, and its business is sluggish. Dingyu is better. The salt tax in this province (more than 7 million yuan annually in the 13th year, and never more than 3 million yuan since then) has slightly improved since the end of the war last year, but it will soon be affected by the new salt law. In the future, the implementation of the new salt law will directly and indirectly lead to the unemployment of no less than 200,000 people in the salt merchant community in this province.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Shandong Business Tax Set to Begin Next Month <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Province is Divided into Thirteen Tax Collection Zones</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the abolition of Likin taxes on January 1st, the province has established a Business Tax Preparatory Committee to handle preparations. The committee dispatched numerous members to conduct surveys in various zones. Originally, it was planned that the surveys would be completed this month, and tax collection would begin on April 1st. However, due to the fact that the investigators still have over ten areas that have not yet been investigated and the urgency to begin collection, the Bureau held its tenth regular meeting yesterday and resolved to request the provincial government to extend the committee's term by one month, and to announce the commencement of tax collection from April 1st. Areas that have not been surveyed will be re-surveyed concurrently. After the regulations and detailed rules are approved by the Ministry of Finance, business licenses will be issued and taxes will be collected to avoid delays. The tax collection zones have been determined according to the current tobacco and alcohol tax zones, dividing the province into thirteen zones: 1. Jinan, 2. Tai'an, 3. Tengxian, 4. Jining, 5. Dong'e, 6. Linqing, 7. Jiyang, 8. Huimin, 9. Zhoucun, 10. Yizhou, 11. Weixian, 12. Jiaozhou, and 13. Yantai. Depending on the complexity of tax affairs in each zone, several tax collection offices will be established. It is estimated that the total annual revenue will not exceed two million yuan, which is insufficient to offset the monthly assistance provided by the central government after the abolition of Likin. The Bureau is currently planning to divide two or three additional zones outside of the existing thirteen, but such measures would only increase expenses, and the revenue may not increase significantly. The biggest reason is that the consolidated tax on goods in Qingdao has historically been a source of over one million yuan in annual revenue for the provincial government. Now that the business tax is allocated to the Qingdao municipal government, the provincial treasury has lost this significant income, which has a huge impact. Attached are the draft regulations for the collection of business tax in Shandong Province and the tax standards:</p>
<p>Regulations for the Collection of Business Tax in Shandong Province: (1) These regulations are based on the national general outline for the collection of business tax in various provinces and supplementary measures promulgated by the central government. (2) All businesses operating within the province, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, shall comply with the provisions of these regulations to pay business tax, unless otherwise stipulated by law. (3) The collection of business tax shall be handled by bureaus established by the Finance Department based on the commercial prosperity of various localities. The location of the bureaus, organizational regulations, and expense budgets shall be determined separately. (4) The standards for collecting business tax are temporarily set as two types: (A) based on business turnover; (B) based on capital. (5) The tax rates for collecting business tax are stipulated as follows: (A) For those based on business turnover, the tax rate is divided into five levels: Level 1 is set at one per thousand, Level 2 at two per thousand, Level 3 at five per thousand, Level 4 at ten per thousand, and Level 5 at fifteen per thousand. (B) For those based on capital, the tax rate is divided into two levels: Level 1 is set at ten per thousand, and Level 2 at twenty per thousand. The tax standards and tax rate levels for each industry are specified separately in a table according to the type and nature of the business. (6) For businesses that should be taxed but are not listed in the tax table, the collection agency shall propose a tax rate based on the type and nature of the business and submit it to the Finance Department for approval.

The aforementioned business license must be renewed annually without any fee. (9) Business tax shall be collected once a month, and the Finance Department shall issue a unified tax receipt. (10) The calculation of business capital shall include all basic capital, reserve capital, public accumulation, and other funds actually available for business use. (11) If a business engages in multiple types of business with different tax rates, the tax amount shall be calculated separately for each type and then totaled for payment. (12) If a business has branches within the province, the business tax may be paid by the head office. If the head office or a branch is located outside the province, the business tax shall be paid only for the branches or head office located within the province. (13) For businesses engaged in the sale of goods, those that specialize in wholesale may be taxed at half the established rate. The same applies to those engaged in partial wholesale. (14) If a manufacturing business directly retails its manufactured goods, the retail portion shall still be taxed according to the tax rate stipulated for the sale of goods. (15) Businesses that are taxed based on business turnover shall calculate their business turnover once every year in June and at the end of December and report it to the relevant collection agency before the 15th of the following month. However, if the business ceases operation in less than half a year, it shall be reported at the time of cessation. (16) If a business undergoes changes in its operations, adds new capital, reorganizes, changes its registration, or relocates, it shall immediately report to the relevant collection agency and surrender the old license for a new one. (17) When a business ceases operations, it must report to the relevant collection agency within fifteen days, along with the business license, and pay all outstanding taxes due before the cessation of operations. (18) If a business license is lost or damaged, a new license shall be issued upon payment of a license fee of one yuan. (19) Businesses with capital less than 500 yuan and branches opened within the province whose business tax has already been paid by the head office may be issued a supplementary business license by the Finance Department to indicate the distinction.

(28) After the implementation of the business tax, all existing tooth taxes, pawn taxes, slaughter taxes, and other taxes and levies in the province that are similar to the business tax shall be converted into business tax and collected at the original tax rates. (29) Detailed implementation rules for these regulations shall be determined separately. (30) These regulations shall be promulgated and implemented after being resolved by the Provincial Government Council and reported to the Ministry of Finance for record.

<h3 id="e43">Truth About the Incident on Nanri Island, Fujian <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for Island Residents' Attack on the Island Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: An incident occurred on Nanri Island recently in which island residents attacked the Island Affairs Bureau. An investigation reveals that the root cause of the incident was that some unscrupulous individuals opened gambling dens during the Lantern Festival celebrations held by the island residents a month ago. Many bandits from nearby areas also infiltrated, and the Island Affairs Bureau, being far away, was unaware of this. A certain island resident, Mr. Jia, suffered repeated losses in gambling and ran out of money. He asked his landlord for a loan, but the landlord refused, which made him very unhappy. He went to the bureau and reported to the Bureau Chief, Qiu Zhenjie. Upon hearing this, Qiu sent many police officers to arrest the bandits on the fourteenth. The bandits scattered upon hearing the news, but one or two residents of the island were unable to escape and hid under a bed. The police officers mistakenly thought they were bandits and opened fire, killing one person. This incited public outrage. The police officers had not been gone for an hour when the island residents, armed with weapons, surrounded the bureau. As a result, the police officers were outnumbered, and a total of 59 officers and police were killed. It is said that 26 of them were brought by Qiu Zhenjie from Putian to the island to guard against pirates. Unexpectedly, they died at the hands of the island residents just a few days after arriving at the bureau. Qiu had only been in office for 40 days. Qiu also served concurrently as the head of the water police outpost. The family members of the personnel involved in this riot were also not spared, which is truly tragic. Wu Shu, the Director of the Maritime Public Security Bureau, immediately sent personnel to the island to investigate the truth. He also submitted a request to the provincial government yesterday to grant generous compensation to comfort the departed souls. (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e44">Shanxi Currency Plummets Amid Panic <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Public Panic, Financial Disorder</p>
<p>Officials Hold Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>Relief Measures to Be Announced</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Shanxi currency (Jin鈔) plummeted in price the previous two days was already very unsettling. However, yesterday, the situation worsened. The rate of exchange rose to three yuan or more for one silver dollar, and it was difficult to purchase dollars at even that rate. The provincial bank, in order to maintain stability, sold 120,000 silver dollars, hoping to adjust the market. However, this had no practical effect. Since yesterday, the market has been in a state of extreme panic. Various businesses have been converting all their transactions to silver dollars. The teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools even held an emergency meeting at the Education Association this morning, seeking a solution. Seeing this situation, Shang Zhen was very concerned. The night before last, he held an emergency meeting at his private residence, inviting the Director of Finance, Fen Yantian, and the Assistant Manager of the Provincial Bank, Yan Zixiu. Although the outcome of the meeting is unknown, a certain member of the Provincial Committee stated that Shang was extremely angry at the merchants who were manipulating the financial situation. He was determined to severely punish them. The Finance Department had a carefully planned method to stabilize the currency, the general outline of which would be announced in the next day or two. A number of major merchants will be arrested. According to a prominent member of the business community, the Shanxi currency's continued plunge has caused extreme panic in society. Their only hope lies in whether the authorities have concrete measures. For the past few days, while the Shanxi currency has been plummeting, the authorities have been eager to provide relief, but they have not yet issued a plan to correct the situation. As a result, the general public has gone from hope to disappointment, from disappointment to panic, and from panic to the feeling that the Shanxi currency is about to become worthless. That is why the price of the currency has plummeted so drastically in the past few days. The current financial situation in this province is indeed at a dangerous point. Today, the only hope for a turnaround is if the government can provide thorough relief and establish a remedy as soon as possible. Such a situation cannot be remedied by severely punishing merchants who manipulate the market or holding lotteries to redeem currency. Furthermore, two issues are closely related to the rectification of the Shanxi currency: one is the issue of restoring and rectifying Shanxi financial bonds, and the other is the issue of investigating Yan Xishan's withdrawals when he left. Although the people of Shanxi have fervently requested the bond issue to be addressed, the government has yet to issue clear regulations, so the matter has been shelved for a long time. Yesterday, a certain official here received a private telegram from Beijing stating that the National Government authorities have discussed the Shanxi financial bond case several times. The central government has received over two hundred letters and telegrams from Shanxi people's organizations and the provincial government requesting the restoration of the 24 million financial bonds. Minister Song Ziwen has visited the Chairman to discuss this matter, who immediately decided to approve the request of the people of Shanxi and restore the bonds. It is expected to be submitted to the State Council meeting this week. This is good news. Regarding the investigation of Yan Xishan's withdrawals, it has been approved by the provincial government to form a joint investigation committee with representatives from the provincial government, the military, and the Chamber of Commerce. The committee will first conduct an investigation and then determine the course of action. The committee is scheduled to meet this morning at the General Chamber of Commerce. The degree to which the resolution of the Shanxi currency problem is connected to the progress of the above two matters can be asserted. The Shanxi currency is currently in a difficult situation, with the hardship of being difficult to both save and abandon. The impact on finance is small, but the direct impact on society and people's livelihoods is great. The meeting and discussion of the education community today is the beginning of this impact.

<h3 id="e45">Disaster Situation in Huixian and Yanjin, Henan Province <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Huixian is a small and poor county. In the past, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang repeatedly levied money and grain and conscripted laborers and vehicles from the county. After Political Inspector Wang Boying investigated, the amount of money extorted from the county by Yan and Feng reached 200,000 yuan. Liu Chunrong's troops mutinied in the county and plundered at will, leaving no village spared within a hundred li around the city. The total loss exceeded 300,000 yuan. Recent investigations by Disaster Relief Committee members Li Chengyi and County Magistrate Su Zhongbin revealed the following: (1) Over 300 houses were burned; (2) 400 vehicles and over 1,400 mules and horses were requisitioned; (3) Property loss amounted to approximately 5 million yuan; (4) Wheat and flour worth over 104,000 yuan; (5) Straw and firewood worth over 8,900 yuan; (6) The average harvest for both the summer and autumn seasons was less than 40%. Currently, there are 30,000 poor households and 8,000 extremely poor households, all suffering from hunger and cold, with scenes of devastation everywhere. The tragic situation in the county can be seen in its entirety.</p>
<p>Yanjin is located in a strategic area between Kaifeng and Weihui, with mostly sandy soil and few houses for storage. The people's livelihood is extremely difficult. Last year, drought caused a sharp decline in the harvest of summer wheat. In the summer, floods caused water levels to rise to over a foot in flat areas. Subsequently, locusts appeared along the old course of the Yellow River, and the northeast of the county seat experienced heavy rain and hail. The autumn harvest was non-existent. The devastation caused by natural disasters was already unbearable, but military disasters occurred repeatedly, with endless supplies. According to the report submitted by the County Magistrate Peng Tingxuan and forwarded by the Provincial Government, Shi You'san's army occupied the area for over eight months, demanding silver and conscripting horses, vehicles, military wheat, and laborers, totaling 179,182 yuan. The Second Route Army exchanged banknotes for opium, and requisitions of vehicles and horses amounted to 22,089 yuan. The Sixth Route requisitioned vehicles and horses for 5,420 yuan. When Han Fuju was Chairman, 1,880 vehicles and horses were requisitioned, worth over 1,880 yuan. The Twenty-sixth Route requisitioned wheat worth 2,596 yuan. The Second Cavalry Division extorted 8,400 yuan, and the First Cavalry Division took mules and horses worth 240 yuan. Chen Tiao's army extorted money and requisitioned vehicles and horses for 12,826 yuan. In addition, the various armies that passed through requisitioned food, dug trenches, and conscripted laborers for 7,086 yuan. Such a small county suffered such losses that over 1,250 disaster victims fled. Currently, there are 12,320 extremely poor households and 41,170 poor households. The cries for help are unbearable to hear.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Ji Yiqiao Returns to Shenyang After Inspecting Shanxi, Accompanied by Zhao Chengshou <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Chengshou Accompanies Him</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Ji Yiqiao, a member of the Northeast Inspection Committee for the Shanxi-Suiyuan Garrison, has completed his public duties and returned to Shenyang on the evening of the 23rd with the inspection personnel. He reported to Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang. Zhao Chengshou, commander of the Shanxi Cavalry and commander for bandit suppression of Datong, also arrived in Shenyang. Ji stayed at the Tongze Club, and Zhao stayed at the Lumingchun Restaurant. A reporter visited Ji and Zhao at 3 PM on the 24th. Ji stated that he was ordered to inspect the Shanxi-Suiyuan Garrison. The troops he inspected were the infantry and cavalry of Wang Jingguo, Fu Zuoyi, Zhao Chengshou, and the artillery unit of Zhou Dai, all stationed in the Datong area of northern Shanxi and Suiyuan. The soldiers were in good spirits and physical condition, and the officers were knowledgeable and capable. The weapons were also well-equipped. The current payment issue is a temporary problem. Currently, all the generals are extremely supportive of General and Deputy Commander Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang. When Deputy Commander Zhang was in Tianjin, he allocated 800,000 yuan issued by the central government to the various units. After deducting 350,000 yuan for the Northwestern Army units of Pang Bingxun, Song Zheyuan, and Sun Dianying, the remaining 450,000 yuan was allocated to the Shanxi army and used to close the Shanxi Army Headquarters. As for the so-called 2 million yuan allocation for disbandment, it was the back pay owed to the Shanxi troops under Yan Xishan's command, which they had requested Deputy Commander Zhang to borrow. Recently, Jing Kenyan, the Special Financial Commissioner of Hebei Province, has contacted Tianjin banks to borrow 1 million yuan. This amount will soon be borrowed and remitted to Shanxi for the disbandment. The disbandment is now complete. The only remaining issue is the monthly salary, which will be discussed in person with Deputy Commander Zhang when they come to Shenyang. The current Shanxi army has over 100,000 men, and it has been decided to pay only half of them. The generals will come to Shenyang one after another to discuss how to raise the remaining half. Inspector Fu Dianwei will come to Shenyang with Sun Dianying to report after completing the inspection with the central government inspectors in the next few days. I will end my mission after meeting with Deputy Commander Zhang. Zhao Chengshou stated that his unit originally had four cavalry divisions with over 10,000 men. After this disbandment, three brigades with six regiments, including over 7,000 officers and soldiers and over 7,000 horses, have been retained. Ji has completed the inspection. They are stationed in the Datong and Suiyuan areas. The total cost of salary and supplies is 200,000 yuan. At present, there is no source of funding, and the supply of provisions is very difficult. The disbanded soldiers have been given separation pay, and the remaining horses have been distributed to various infantry units. The Shanxi army has received considerable training and education. After this disbandment and reorganization, they can become a strong force for national defense. Zhao will visit Zhang on the 25th and stay in Shenyang for about ten days. (March 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Zhang Jinghui, President of the Military Council, Plans to Visit Shenyang and Then Go to Beijing <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zhang Jinghui, the Administrative Officer of the Special Region, was appointed as President of the Military Council. Because the position of Special Region Officer was important, he once telegraphed Beijing to resign from the position of President of the Military Council, but the request was not approved. Zhang Jinghui felt that the Deputy Commander Zhang greatly relied on him as the Special Region Officer and did not allow him to resign. However, the government repeatedly telegraphed him to go to Beijing to take office. Both positions are very important, and it is difficult to take care of both. Therefore, he telegraphed Beijing again a few days ago to resign, explaining the reasons why he could not go to Beijing. According to the government's reply, they still encouraged him to overcome the difficulty and go to Beijing to take office as soon as possible. If the affairs of the Special Region are important and he cannot leave for a long time, he can return to Harbin to take charge or send someone to act as an agent after the Military Council is established. He can telegraph for instructions on important matters. Zhang has now decided to go south. He has already telegraphed Shenyang to seek Deputy Commander Zhang's opinion, then determine the date of his trip to Beijing. Zhou Shouyi, the Director of Education of Eastern Special District, will also accompany Zhang to Shenyang. (March 24th)</p>

<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Miles, the U.S. Consul General in Shenyang, took office as Consul in Fengtian in February 1925 and was promoted to Consul General in April 1930. Consul General Miles has applied to his government for leave to return home. On the afternoon of the 23rd, he paid special visits to Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang and Zang Shiyi, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Wang Jinghuan, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Shenyang, to bid farewell. On the evening of the 24th, Special Commissioner Wang hosted a banquet at the office, inviting consuls from Britain, Germany, France, and Italy, as well as the U.S. Deputy Consul, Lin Qisi, to attend. Consul General Miles has completed his preparations and is scheduled to take the South Manchuria Railway train to Dalian on the evening of the 26th and return home via Shanghai. Before the new Consul General arrives, the duties of the U.S. Consulate General in Shenyang will be performed by Deputy Consul Lin Qisi. Hugh Hodgkin, the British Trade Commissioner in Northeast China, will meet with Deputy Commander Zhang and Chairman Zang on the 25th and 26th respectively to express his respect since taking office and to express Britain's hope for the development of trade in Northeast China.

<h3 id="e49">Formal Election of the Liaoning General Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Fifteen Executive Committee Members and Seven Supervisory Committee Members Elected</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Liaoning General Chamber of Commerce held an election for the executive and supervisory committee members on the 24th. The meeting formally started at 9:00 AM. Zhao Jun, the Provincial Government Supervisor, and Li Kaijia, the Agricultural and Mining Department Supervisor, attended. Jin Enqi, the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, Lu Guangji, the Head of the Labor Union, and over two hundred chairmen of various associations greeted the attendees. First, Chairman Jin Enqi gave an opening speech, stating that the Liaoning General Chamber of Commerce was ordered by the central government to hold elections today. It is an honor to have provincial government officials, officials from the Department of Agriculture and Mining, and reporters present to oversee the elections. According to the investigation, there are over 10,000 shops in the provincial capital, Dadong District, the Shenhai Road area, and the commercial port area. There are 56 members in the commercial associations and 10 members in the shops. Over 920 people are eligible to vote and be elected, which is several times more than even the most prosperous Shanghai. Therefore, we must pay serious attention to this election. I hope that everyone will act according to the law in this election to avoid any future embarrassment and to ensure the smooth development of the Chamber of Commerce. Provincial Government Supervisor Zhao Jun and Agricultural Department Supervisor Li Kaijia gave speeches, stating that the elected individuals should have expertise in economics or experience in commerce and should work for the benefit of the province's chamber of commerce and strive for the glory of the national business community. At a time when economic rights are being lost to foreign countries and the financial situation is declining, we should try to recover the lost rights and revitalize the endangered situation. Voting began at 11:00 AM and continued until 4:00 PM. Under the supervision of officials from the Provincial Government and the Department of Agriculture and Mining, the ballot boxes were opened and the votes were counted. As a result, fifteen executive committee members and seven supervisory committee members were elected. The list of executive committee members is as follows: Jin Enqi, Lu Guangji, Li Futang, Wang Tongxuan, Wang Xiaowei, Qi Zirong, Fang Xudong, Qiao Jinqing, Liu Guanyi, Gao Zhenduo, Wang Heng'an, Li Yunshan, Wang Minqing, Gong Tianmin, Liu Zhaoxiang.

<h3 id="e50">Anhui Merchants Demand Abolition of Inland Customs Stations <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: At the National Likin Abolition Conference, it was resolved that inland customs stations are through-taxes that must be abolished for the complete elimination of Likin. Therefore, it was resolved that customs stations outside fifty li should be abolished, and one month later, all customs stations within fifty li should be abolished. Recently, merchants in various regions have been calling for this, but the Ministry of Finance has replied that a comprehensive plan must be drawn up before a decision can be made on the abolition date, delaying it until now. The Anhui Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce believe that the abolition of customs stations has been overdue for a long time, and the business tax in the province has already been implemented, so the burden on merchants has actually increased. Furthermore, Wuhu is surrounded by customs stations, and merchants feel the pain deeply. In addition to submitting a request to the central government, they have also sent letters to various industry associations, asking them to unanimously advocate for the previous proposal to the central government.

<p>Robbery and Injury Occur in Yangming Township: In the Sixth-Ninth Map of the Third District (Yangming Township), Zhang Zunsan, a resident of the Zhang Xiaomu Bridge area in the West Lane, currently operates the Hengchun Rice Store under the Kuatang Bridge outside the South Gate. At approximately 12:00 AM the night before last, more than ten robbers suddenly arrived, speaking in a strong Northern accent and carrying flashlights, knives, clubs, and homemade bombs. They broke open the front door and entered. Mr. Zhang and his wife were already asleep. After entering the room, the robbers went straight to the upstairs bedroom and dragged Mr. and Mrs. Zunsan out of bed. They tied them up with ropes and forced them to reveal where the silver was hidden. When Mr. and Mrs. Zhang were slow to answer, they were kicked violently by the robbers, causing serious injuries to their waists and other parts of their bodies. The robbers then burned the lower parts of Mr. and Mrs. Zunsan's bodies with candles and straw. Afterwards, they divided up to search for loot and left with the stolen goods, shouting loudly. After investigation, it was found that gold, silver jewelry, clothing, and other items worth approximately two hundred silver dollars had been stolen. The heads of the Third and Eighth Sub-bureaus of Public Security were informed and immediately led police to search for the robbers, but they had already fled far away and could not be apprehended. At the same time, more than twenty robbers also entered the home of Zhang Songnan, a resident of Xiaozhang Lane in the same district, and carried out a robbery, causing significant losses.</p>

<p>Resolutions of the Jiangsu-Changzhou Pacification Conference: The Jiangsu-Changzhou Pacification Zone held a meeting in Chengxiang on the 28th. Details have been reported in this newspaper. The meeting began at 9:00 AM, with sixteen representatives from the eight counties of Wuxi and Wu attending. Commander Zhu presided. More than twenty proposals related to bandit suppression were submitted, and the details of the resolutions were kept secret. The following are the resolutions published by the Headquarters: (6) If any armed group fails to provide assistance to neighboring areas when bandit alarms occur, the circumstances will be investigated and reported for punishment depending on the severity. (7) When suppressing bandits, if the bandits flee in a certain direction, the unit responsible for guarding that direction will be held responsible under military law. If there are special circumstances that need to be reported in advance, otherwise, if there are suspicious activities, the County Magistrates should report to the Headquarters for investigation and punishment. (9) The Jiangsu-Changzhou area is mostly a water region, bordering Lake Tai, with numerous rivers and streams, making it a key location for bandit activity. The most important strategy for prevention and suppression is to focus on water patrols. However, the number of water police teams is insufficient. Can each county expand the water patrol teams that have already been established? Or can they raise funds to establish regular patrols to supplement the water police and quell banditry? (15) During the purification period, the counties should thoroughly investigate and report to the Headquarters any privately held firearms or bandit weapons so that they can be forwarded for review and handling. (18) Counties without bandit disturbances should immediately assist the local purification bureau in carrying out purification. (19) For areas that have been cleared or counties without bandit disturbances where purification has been completed, the County Government should report to the Headquarters so that it can be forwarded. (20) Each armed group should submit a detailed report to the Headquarters every week on their daily bandit suppression activities and assistance with purification. If there are special circumstances, a report should be submitted immediately. (1) Temporary Proposal by the Wu County Government: Bandits in Lake Tai appear and disappear unpredictably. It is proposed to plan and establish a leading team to fundamentally suppress them in order to protect the inland towns. (2) Proposal by Wujiang, Taicang, and Wu Counties: Please send troops to station and maintain local security. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The representatives left Chengxiang one after another today (the 29th) and returned to their respective counties.</p>

<h3 id="e61">National Treasury Burden Per Japanese Student <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Faculty of Law: Minimum... 180 yuan</p>
<p>Faculty of Medicine: Maximum... 2,090 yuan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th Telegram: According to a Ministry of Education survey, the total recurring educational expenses of the six Imperial Universities, six official universities, and eighty-one directly administered vocational schools in the third year of Showa (1928) was 43,050,128 yuan, of which the government expenditure was 29,185,609 yuan. The national treasury burden per student was the lowest for the Faculty of Law, at only 180 yuan, and the highest for the Faculty of Medicine, with Niigata Medical University spending 2,090 yuan per person, ranking first. It is also a comical phenomenon that the Faculty of Law, which receives the least government financial support, has the most difficulty in obtaining employment, while graduates of the Faculty of Medicine, which receive the most government funding, are uniquely popular.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Ministry of Education Pays Attention to Social Education Funding <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Ordering Provinces and Cities to Raise Funds to Meet Standards</p>
<p>Those That Have Met Standards Will Be Rewarded Separately</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education will separately reward and commend provinces and cities whose social education funding for the 18th and 19th years (1929 and 1930) has met the standards. Those that have not met the standards will be ordered to promptly report their plans to increase funding. The document sent to the Provincial and Municipal Education Bureaus states:</p>
<p>It is necessary to ascertain and compile the amount of social education funding for each province and city for the 18th and 19th years. A form has been created and sent by telegram for compliance and reporting. Based on the original numbers reported by each province and city, a statistical summary table and a comparative ranking table have been created. According to the calculations in each table, the explicitly stipulated standard for social education funding to account for 10 to 20 percent of total education funding has been met by seven provinces and cities: Fujian, Hunan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Hankou, and Nanjing. Although the standard amount has not been reached, the proportion is still above 5 percent for five provinces and cities: Yunnan, Hubei, Shandong, Henan, and Beiping. The remaining are far behind, with Shanxi Province at four per thousand and Rehe Province at one percent being the smallest. It has been investigated that during the period of political tutelage, social education is extremely important. The Ministry believes that the implementation of the cause depends on the fulfillment of talents, and especially on the fulfillment of funding. The Ministry has stipulated the percentage of social education as the standard for assessing the administrative performance of social education in each province and city. Fujian, Hunan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and the two cities of Hankou and Nanjing have all been able to comply, which is deeply commendable. The fact that Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Shaanxi, Henan, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Guangdong, Nanjing, and other eleven provinces and cities increased their funding in the 19th year compared to the 18th year is also sufficient to prove their efforts. Among them, Zhejiang Province increased by 6.8 percent, Yunnan Province increased by 6.99 percent, Shaanxi Province increased by 4.51 percent, and Fujian Province increased by 4.44 percent, which is particularly commendable. However, there are also as many as eleven provinces and cities where funding was reduced in the 19th year compared to the 18th year. Among them, Hankou City decreased by 8 percent, Hunan Province decreased by 7.47 percent, and Shandong Province decreased by 3.3 percent. This phenomenon is particularly inappropriate. As for Shanxi and Rehe Provinces, their percentages are even smaller, and their undertakings are even more backward, so they should be promptly revitalized in order to advance. Now, at the time of preparing the budget for the 20th year (1931), all provinces and cities that have not selected the stipulated standard must strive to increase funding, and strive to ensure that social education funding for the 20th year is significantly increased, and should promptly prepare and submit a plan to increase social education funding for the 20th year for assessment. Those whose percentage has reached the stipulated standard but is lower than the previous year should also find ways to increase it so that it can progress year by year. In addition to separate orders, a summary table and a comparative ranking table, each with twenty copies, are hereby printed and distributed for compliance with this order.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Ministry of Education Investigates Unregistered Private Secondary Schools <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education sent a circular to the Education Bureaus of all provinces and cities to investigate and report on all unregistered private secondary schools in each province and city for verification. The circular states: It has been investigated that the deadline for the registration of private schools is the day before the start of the first semester of the 20th year (1931). The Ministry has previously issued orders to this effect. Recently, the educational administrative organs of various provinces and cities have successively submitted to the Ministry for filing a list of private secondary schools that have been registered, which is certainly very many. However, apart from the Guangdong Provincial Education Bureau, which has separately reviewed and approved the establishment of unregistered private secondary schools in the province and reported them to the Ministry for record, and the Rehe Provincial Education Bureau, which has reported that there are no unregistered private secondary schools, the Ministry has no way of knowing how many unregistered private secondary schools there are in other regions. Now that the deadline is imminent, it is hereby ordered again to expedite the investigation and clear reporting of the number and names of all unregistered private secondary schools under jurisdiction to the Ministry for filing. At the same time, unregistered schools should still be urged to complete registration procedures within the deadline. Those who deliberately wait and see and fail to apply for registration after the deadline should be strictly dealt with in accordance with the Ministry's Instruction No. 697 of July of the 19th year (1930). In addition to separate circulars, this order is hereby issued to the office for compliance with reporting.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Xu Peihuang's Speech on the General Situation of Municipal Education <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, delivered a speech at the Shanghai YMCA on the general situation of Shanghai's educational administration. He stated briefly that the purpose of education, to put it simply, is not only to cultivate the ability to make a living independently but also to cultivate talents suitable for the social environment. Education is closely related to culture. The educational facilities in our country focus solely on material development, which will inevitably lead to mutual struggle in the future, and may still hinder cultural progress. Therefore, education must not only be suitable for the national environment but also be united with various countries in the world. Modern education in China is based on the Three Principles of the People, so that all Chinese people can understand the legacy of the Premier's Three Principles of the People and achieve the Great Harmony. The Three Principles of the People are quite suitable for China's</p>
<p>environment, so we should strive to achieve the goal. Education in Shanghai is very complex, unlike the education in major cities of other countries, which is very pure. In the Shanghai concessions, there are Chinese Children's Public Schools, church schools, as well as national, municipal, private schools, and private tutoring schools. Private tutoring schools have been banned, but some scholars who are compelled by hunger and cold still set them up. Therefore, the implementation of education based on the Three Principles of the People is very difficult in Shanghai. The schools run by foreigners naturally have different educational policies from our country, and the church schools are all for missionary purposes. The situations of other national, municipal, and private schools are also different. In the unregistered private schools, the education</p>
<p>is not carried out according to the educational policies. The schools in Shanghai are so complex. Here are the statistics of the number of schools: There are eight registered universities, five national universities, and one independent college registered in the eighteenth year, and eight unregistered ones, including three national and eight private. There are forty-five middle schools and seventy-three primary schools, sixty unregistered middle schools, and fifty-nine primary schools. Therefore, the primary task now is to promote and supervise registration to ensure compliance with the standards stipulated by the Municipal Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why private schools cannot apply for registration: (1) The teachers are all part-time; (2) The problem of funding. Therefore, the Education Bureau now plans to find ways to enable all schools to register within a time limit, otherwise they will be banned. In terms of educational funding, according to statistics in the sixteenth year, the annual expenditure for kindergartens and primary schools was 2,139,812.4 yuan, for middle schools 1,621,165.2 yuan, for colleges and above 1,489,053 yuan, and for vocational and supplementary schools 245,685 yuan, totaling 5,496,224 yuan, accounting for 32.2% of the municipal government's expenditure for primary schools and kindergartens, and 6.3% for middle schools. According to the statistics in the nineteenth year, the current situation of municipal schools is: 185 primary schools, 5 middle schools, 52 mass education centers, 16 supplementary schools, 4 mass supplementary schools, 7 sports fields, 1 circulating library, and 1 science laboratory, with an expenditure of over 820,000 yuan. As for the number of students, there are 460 male and 320 female students in municipal middle schools, 4,990 senior and 25,990 junior students in municipal primary schools, 110 male and 180 female teachers. There are 650 male and 330 female students in municipal primary schools. The total number of school-age children in the city is 102,022, with 33,739 enrolled and 46,056 not enrolled, and 22,237 children who are not of school age are enrolled. It is estimated that only 42.6% of school-age children are enrolled (excluding concessions). According to the statistics of the nineteenth year, the expenditure of the bureau on educational administration accounts for about 17%. The total cost is 925,890 yuan. Finally, I hope that our municipal administration will become more and more developed, and that the sovereignty of education will be unified and cooperate with the concessions to implement education based on the Three Principles of the People in accordance with our national educational policies.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Western Police Secure Group A Championship, Zhenru Still Defeated <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>A Score of One to Three</p>
<p>| End of the Chinese Teams in Group A Football League |</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Zhenru football team played its final game of the Westerners' Football League against the Western Police in a misty rain at the Chinese baseball</p>
<p>field. Zhenru, having been repeatedly defeated by the Western Police, had hoped to vent its anger and raise its eyebrows yesterday, but many of its warriors were injured and had to make many changes. As a result, they were still defeated by the Western Police by a score of one to three. This marked the end of the Chinese teams in this year's Westerners' Football League. The lineups of the two teams yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Zhenru Team</p>
<p>Liang Shutang Fu Hexuan</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Yang Baosen</p>
<p>Xie Quanhe Chen Jiaqiu Dai Linjing</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Chen Fuzhong Tong Rongwen</p>
<p>Western Police Team</p>
<p>He Lei Wei Jinsheng</p>
<p>Shi Gu Tuo Tui Na</p>
<p>Bo Lai Tai Ga Wei France</p>
<p>Ji Bosun Jie Ke</p>
<p>Wei Sihe O Kelai</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Sportsmen of Zhenru Are Commendable <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The athletes of Zhenru have fought tirelessly in this year's Westerners' Football League, playing no less than twenty-odd games, and after yesterday's battle, they can finally take a rest. Although not all of these twenty-odd games were victories, they have defeated strong enemies and overcome stubborn opponents. Zhenru has risen to replace the declining Lehua. It is indeed Zhenru that has been able to achieve such results as a university student team. This will be an indelible page in the history of Chinese football. Looking back at the record at the end of this season, we must say that it is commendable and deeply hope that they will make further efforts in the next season and breathe out and raise their eyebrows. As for the performance of the center-back line yesterday, it was the most distinctive. Chen Jiaqiu's vigor was undiminished, and Liang Shuliang was also not bad. The defense had gaps from time to time, so the merits and demerits were half and half.</p>
<p>Dai, the center forward, was also more active than in the International Games, while Yu Ziping was mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Western Police Secure the Championship with Their Victory <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Group A competition has come to an end. Shi Gude has a total of twenty-three points, the most. Although the Western Police only have twenty points, they still have three games left. Yesterday's difficult hurdle has been passed, and adding two points will make it twenty-two points, which is no problem against Lax. The Navy is also mostly not their opponent, so with yesterday's victory, the Western Police have once again secured the Group A championship. As for their performance and talent, they are indeed superior to others. Only the second half of yesterday's game was impressive.</p>
<h3 id="e70">The Momentum at the Beginning Was Overwhelming <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The two armies lined up, and Zhenru attacked against the wind, rushing left and right, unparalleled. Tong Rongwen quickly advanced from the left, and Yang Baosen also actively responded to Dai Linjing's support. The center forward was also more successful. Just as they were warning each other, Tong Rongwen passed the ball to Fu Hexuan, and the five forwards advanced together, like hungry tigers pouncing on eagles, swarming towards the opponent's talisman, and fiercely shooting at the goal. The ball was blocked and bounced back, and he fell to the ground. Yang Baosen calmly kicked the ball and shot it accurately into the net, and the audience cheered and congratulated him.</p>
<h3 id="e71">A Penalty Kick Greatly Hurt the Vitality <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Although the Western Police tried their best to counterattack, the defense revealed huge loopholes and dangerous situations occurred from time to time. After holding on for more than thirty minutes, Zhenru was still ahead by one goal, and everyone thought that they could at least win the first half. Unexpectedly, several attacks failed to counter, and Tui Na and others followed. Feng Yunyou fell to the ground and touched the ball with his hand. A hard-won ball was converted into a penalty kick by Tui Na, and the score was tied. From then on, Zhenru's vitality was</p>
<p>greatly damaged. The score was one to one in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e72">A Score of One to Three Determined the Outcome <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The field changed and the landscape changed. The Western Police retaliated and broke through the goal within five minutes, taking the lead with a score of two to one. Zhenru tried to rally after this loss, but unexpectedly failed to defeat the enemy and conceded another goal. Ten minutes before the end of the game, Western Police center forward France shot a ball from twenty yards away from the goal. Jiang and Feng jumped up at the same time to block it, but they gave way to each other, and the ball leaked through and entered the net. A score of one to three determined the outcome of the game.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Financial Last Week, the Gold Market Fluttered <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>In Constant Turmoil and Change</p>
<p>The changes in gold prices last week were still strong, with the situation changing like the weather, almost in a whirlpool. Fluctuations of several taels in an instant were common, with a difference of twenty taels a day. The fluttering state was unstoppable. In fact, various news were divergent, and the potential for weakness was lurking. At the beginning of the week, the early market once reached 711.5 taels, because major players such as Lu were shorting, especially as the silver market shrank and the exchange rate was still tight. On Wednesday morning, the silver market rose and the sellers exceeded Heng, suddenly falling to 674.5 taels. Afterwards, it rebounded, probably due to the fierce purchases by the Guangdong gang. Afterwards, it rose and fell, advancing and retreating outside the 700 taels mark. People were extremely</p>
<p>anxious and panicked. By the weekend, the total audit showed a slight drop of 1.8 taels. There was a difference of 37 taels during the week, but the overseas silver price was the opposite, truly going against the grain. The English silver fell by 4375, the American silver fell by 625, and the Shanghai market also shrank by half a grade (125 days of gold were increased by one</p>
<p>point and 25). The bank's internal market was tight and loose, and the Chinese merchants sometimes tried to cover their positions, but the English silver was still in a short position, and the price of daily gold was still heavily pressed, from 50 taels to 70 taels. It is heard that Xinyong and Yongheng (Luo's) originally held long positions, but have recently sold them off one after another, almost offsetting their positions. As for spot exports, there has been little activity in recent days, and the bare bond mark-up has increased by eight or nine taels. The general situation of the week is recorded below.</p>
<p>Found Many Unusual Storms</p>
<p>Since Monday (23rd), the big bar silver has shrunk by 25 to 1875, and the American silver has shrunk by 375, so the exchange rate has also been reduced by half a grade. The internal market is tightening, and Chinese merchants are actively buying to make up for the previous short positions, and the bars are being套出(sold). The gold market opened in May and soared by 11 taels to 707 taels. However, Wu and Hengxing sold, returning to 01 taels. After Lu補空(covering short positions), it soared to 711.5 taels. In the afternoon, Hengxing and others scrambled to sell, plummeting by 10 taels, closing at 700 taels and 005 qian, turning flat at 04 taels and 3 qian, continuing to rise by 8.3 taels from the previous Saturday. There was a total of 11 taels of twists and turns throughout the day. The next day, the big bars did not change, and the exchange rate did not rise or fall. However, the internal market tended to loosen, and the industry resumed selling, and the gold market suddenly became weak. There were 23 taels of waves throughout the day, because major players Wu and Lu were selling. The opening was 702 taels, and then it broke through the 700 taels mark. The afternoon was particularly weak, with a rapid and violent plunge of 20 taels to a minimum closing of 681 taels, a miserable drop of 23.3 taels from the previous day. On Wednesday, the big bars had grown by 25, the silver price had increased by 75, and the English silver had initially grown by three grades and then shrunk by one grade. The statistics still show a growth of one grade (25), and the internal market tended to rebound. The Chinese merchants initially threw and then扒(bought), because it was rumored that there was another political turmoil between England and India, saying that the British had punished three Indians who had rioted, causing a strike, so the outlook for silver prices was pessimistic. The general short positions were closed, and the English silver broke through to 4 pence. The gold market initially fell by 2 taels, 79 taels, and then, due to the sale of major players, it was only 74.5 taels, and then Hengxing Shengsheng actively pursued 7,000 to 8,000 bars, soaring by 20 taels, and the English silver was also tight. The afternoon seemed to soften, closing at only 688.6 qian, a rebound of 7.6 qian. There was a difference of 20.5 qian throughout the day. The next day, the big bars shrunk by 3125, the American silver was reduced by 75, and the English silver was reduced by one grade. The internal market was tight first and then loose. The industry initially扒(bought) and then released. The gold market opened and rose by 10.4 qian, 699 taels, followed by 702.5 taels, which was bought by Wu and 物品(goods). Afterwards, Hengxing and Yongheng sold a lot, and it plummeted by 10 taels. The minimum closing price in the afternoon was 86 taels and 5, falling back by 2.1 qian, a total of 16 taels of ups and downs throughout the day. On Friday, the big bars did not change, the silver price increased by 125, and the English silver was掛　牌(listed) without change. The internal market saw tightening, and the gold market suddenly turned upwards. Then, due to the sale of Yongheng and others, it returned to 692 taels. Zhifeng Yong and others bought it, and it rose to the 700 taels mark. The afternoon was soft and firm, closing at 700 taels and 5 qian, a total increase of 15 taels from the previous day. It was rumored that Spain had switched to the gold standard and sold a large amount of silver, so the market was turning upward. There was also a fluctuation of 9 taels on that day. On Saturday, the big bars shrank by a small amount of 125 to 0625, the silver price shrank by 375, and the English silver掛牌(listing) did not change. The internal market seemed loose, and the gold price was initially firm and then挫(depressed). The opening price was 704 taels, followed by 707 taels and 5 qian, and then there were fluctuations of five or six taels. At noon, the Guangdong gang was selling strongly. By the closing, it was 694 taels and 2 qian, a drop of 7.3 qian from the previous day. After the closing, it was suddenly suppressed to 91 taels and a half, with a fluctuation of 14.2. However, the future market may still have a dramatic change. The high and low prices of the English, American, and Indian silver markets, exchange rates, and gold prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday (Sunday), the London telegrams showed that the big silver bars had rebounded, with recent bars growing by 125 and distant bars growing by 0625, both at 13.5 pence (equivalent to English gold at 1 shilling 3 pence 9375). Local Chinese bankers advanced and then retreated, and the transaction was rare. The market was flat after the closing. A New York telegram also reported that the American silver price also grew by 25 to 2 corners 9 points 25. The English-to-American exchange rate went down by 03125, and the American-to-English exchange rate went down by 03125 to 4 yuan 8 corners 5 fen 32 parts of 25.

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday. In the money market, in addition to opening prices to decorate the market, there was little new news. The foreign li market price seemed to be slightly better, with the early market being 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 8 hao 7 half, and the afternoon market being 7 qian 2 fen 5 li.

<h3 id="e88">New Voices of Silk Cocoon Dumping <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Now that the business community has implemented the Gregorian calendar, the lunar calendar has been abolished. Therefore, the so-called end of March in previous years has been invisibly eliminated, and the provisions of the period ocean have no fixed standard. Yesterday it was heard from those who work in this field that the dumping of silk cocoon is mostly determined by the cocoon collecting period, with no so-called bottom of March or half of April. It is only agreed that a certain place will上簇(spin cocoons) on a certain day or出發(ship) on a certain day, then this</p>

<p>The Trend is Moderate with Minimal Fluctuations</p>
<p>Over Four Million in Transactions</p>
<p>During the past week, the Shanghai stock market's government bond situation remained sluggish, with only sporadic transactions occurring daily. Total turnover for the week was only 78,500 yuan. Apart from 27,300 yuan for the 1929 Customs Bonds and 13,000 yuan for the 1929 Disbandment Bonds, other transactions were only in the thousands. Although the futures market was nearing settlement, the overall environment did not change significantly, and the market was more active than the previous week. Monday's turnover reached 1,060,000 yuan, Tuesday's was 880,000 yuan, and Wednesday's was also approximately 800,000 yuan. The second half of the week was relatively calm, with an average daily turnover of over 500,000 yuan on Thursday and the weekend. On Friday, trading in the March contract was suspended in preparation for settlement, while the May contract had not yet opened, resulting in a quieter market with only 360,000 yuan in transactions. The total turnover for the week was 4,137,500 yuan, an increase of over 1,100,000 yuan compared to the previous week. The bond market trend was very stable, as all parties were preparing for settlement, resulting in few large transactions and a balanced supply and demand situation. However, daily fluctuations occurred, with the market being slightly weak only on the first day of the week. Subsequently, scattered purchases in the market were quite active, causing bond prices to gradually rise daily. As a result, prices rebounded by half a yuan to over one yuan. The bond market trend appears to remain in a state of dormancy, and without new changes in the bond market environment, it is unlikely to see development in the near future. The following is a statistical list of the high, low, and fluctuation of bond prices during the past week (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn: Yarn Market Turned from Strong to Flat Last Week</p>
<p>The yarn market showed a strong upward trend at the beginning of last week, with rapid price increases. This was mainly due to the development of domestic demand. The price of imported yarn increased, and exchange rates were difficult to loosen, making it profitable to purchase domestic yarn in China. Japanese firms were actively seeking to purchase large quantities of Japanese yarn, leading to a significant shortage of Japanese yarn. Most of the yarn for August and September was sold out, prompting purchases of Chinese yarn. Shenxin and Yong'an factories exported a considerable amount of yarn, further tightening the market. A major merchant and powerful players held long positions, exacerbating the upward trend. The entire output of the Qingdao yarn factory was shipped to Japan, leaving no stock available locally. As a result, purchases were made in Shanghai, boosting business along Qingdao and Tianjin North Roads, creating a prosperous market. The highest price for standard yarn reached 172.3 taels. Towards the weekend, as March approached its final day, sellers released a large quantity of cheap yarn, impacting the market. New sellers concentrated their efforts, and although buyers had significant purchasing power, the overwhelming selling pressure proved difficult to resist. Many intended to go short due to the high base price and clear sales volume, making it difficult for the market to stabilize. Consequently, sellers collectively dumped their holdings, causing prices to fall by three to four taels in the near term and 167 taels in the long term. However, a certain manufacturer remained unusually calm, as their stock had already been sold out, and their internal organization was strong. Considering the surrounding environment, a major drop was unlikely. Nevertheless, the aggressive selling pressure from general short sellers temporarily impacted the market. Compared to the previous week, the price of standard yarn fell by one to two taels in the near term and seven to nine qian in the long term. Statistics show that various buyers purchased a total of 12,640 bales of spot yarn during the week, with Qingdao, Tianjin, and inland regions being the most active markets. Prices remained firm and high. It is reported that Shenxin and foreign firms also shipped five to six thousand pieces to Japan, but the exact number needs to be verified through customs records. The current period is during the peak spring sales season, and a large portion of purchases have not yet been made. Therefore, major players remain optimistic about the future. The actual direction of the market will depend on current sales trends. The total turnover of standard yarn for the week was 238,650 bales. The following is a breakdown of the number of bales purchased by each group:</p>
<p>Group  Bales  Group  Bales  Group  Bales</p>
<p>Qingdao  3,200  Sichuan  400  Shantou  530</p>

<p>The cotton market experienced an extremely strong trend last week. However, the overseas cotton market was flat and lackluster, causing most people to remain calm. Later, due to the depletion of stocks from various sources, it became difficult to increase the stock level at local warehouses beyond 20,000 bales. As a result, buyers adopted a stable attitude with strong pulling power. Although prices in the foreign market were flat, exchange rates were difficult to loosen, making the silver-based purchase price still high. Therefore, imports remained difficult. Whenever an opportunity arose, prices would increase by one to two liang, as the stock was too low, and the future was uncertain. The total turnover of standard cotton for the week was 467,900 dan. Sources included 3,495 dan of Yao cotton and 600 bales of Tongzhou cotton. Transactions among various factories were light. The total purchase amount was 6,640 dan. The price of American cotton fell by 20 points compared to the previous week. The following is a breakdown of the amount purchased by each manufacturer:</p>
<p>Manufacturer  Purchase  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Transaction Volume  Deadline</p>
<p>Velvet Set Cotton  37.50  ---  130 pieces  Spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton  39.75  ---  500 bales  Delivery to Suzhou</p>

<p>Chairman's Report Fellow Comrades, Fellow Representatives</p>
<p>Today is the 20th anniversary of the sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs, which is also the revolutionary memorial day of the most significant, most intense, and most influential sacrifices in the revolutionary movements before the Xinhai Revolution. Before the Opium War in 1842, the situation in China was unclear to the world. After the Opium War, China's weakness, political corruption, and the betrayal of officials were clear to all countries in the world. At the same time, the world's colonies were fully exploited by imperialists, and the world's small and weak nations were completely slaughtered by imperialists. Only our large and resource-rich China still stood in the East. As a result, international imperialists challenged us in every way and sought opportunities to exploit us. As a result of the various Sino-Japanese, Anglo-French, and other wars, China was burdened with territorial concessions and unequal treaties. After the Sino-French War, although Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Prime Minister of our Party, and many revolutionary martyrs advocated revolution, the people were still ignorant and apathetic. Therefore, the first step for the revolutionaries was to awaken the people, hoping to use practical revolutionary movements and tragic sacrifices to awaken the general public. Since the "99" revolutionary movement, there were successive failures for several years, with more than nine failures. The number of party members who were martyred is unknown. However, the indomitable revolutionaries did not lose heart. Therefore, after the ninth revolutionary failure, Dr. Sun Yat-sen convened a secret meeting in Penang, British Malaya, with Mr. Huang Xing, Zhao Boxian, Hu Hanmin, and others. After negotiation, it was decided to convene the elite of the entire Party on March 15, 1910, for a final attack. Unexpectedly, on March 11, a shocking and sensational heroic act occurred, in which party member Wen Shengcai assassinated the Qing general Fu Qi, causing panic among Qing officials. Fearing the bravery and greatness of the revolutionaries, the city of Guangzhou was placed under special martial law, and the party's funds were not fully prepared. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the attack to March 29, which is today, twenty years ago. The plan was extremely meticulous, and the revolutionary troops were unaware. After the attack was launched at 5 p.m. on the 29th, it was attacked because the Qing officials were prepared and suffered mutual misunderstandings and infighting. The tenth revolutionary movement ended in a tragic failure. Those who participated in the attack were the most staunch revolutionary forces of the Party, and many were students who had returned from overseas. Therefore, the sacrifice was great and the loss was unprecedented. Guangdong is located in the tropics, and it was spring in March. The corpses of the martyred party members littered the streets, a tragic sight that caused tears. Fortunately, the righteous Mr. Pan Dazheng came forward and buried them collectively at Huanghuagang. We must know that the seeds of the Wuchang Uprising were deeply sown by the Huanghuagang Uprising. The revolutionary martyrs regarded death as returning home and taking righteousness as life. They did not simply hope to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, nor did they simply hope to hang up a signboard of the Republic of China. They demanded the establishment of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People of the people, by the people, and for the people. Although the warlords have been overthrown, reactionary elements are still lurking in various places, feudal forces are still rampant, bandits are still burning and killing in rural areas, and imperialists are still advancing step by step. Today, as we commemorate the martyrdom of the revolutionary martyrs, we should mourn the martyrdom of the revolutionary martyrs and consider how to continue their spirit and complete their unfinished will. I now put forward three points in the hope that everyone will work hard. First, we must complete the political tutelage and construction so that the Republic of China is not just an empty signboard and so that every citizen can exercise their political power and participate in national affairs. This all depends on whether the work of political tutelage can be completed. The reason why the Xinhai Revolution failed so tragically was that there was no period of political tutelage. The reason why Yuan Shikai, Zhang Xun, and all the warlords, large and small, were able to wreak havoc in the history of the Republic of China for more than ten years was that the people had no ability to exercise political power. Learning from the past, the work of the political tutelage period is truly important. Fellow Comrades, we are now at this critical juncture, and I hope that everyone will work hard. Second, we must continue the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs and strive to destroy the old and build the new. Whether we can thoroughly destroy and build depends on whether we have a full and rich revolutionary spirit. During the "2129" revolutionary movement, Mr. Zhu Zhixin was in another position, but when he learned of it, he immediately cut off half of his gown and rushed to kill the thieves. After Comrade Li Yanan was arrested, he asked for a bullet to enter his mouth and died by shooting himself. This heroic spirit of regarding death as returning home is the result of the deep cultivation of the revolutionary spirit. With this spirit, nothing is impossible. This is what every party member and every citizen should emulate. Third, the issue of the National Congress is the key to governing the country, because the construction cause can never be borne by the Kuomintang or the National Government alone. We must unite all the people to achieve success. The National Congress is the place to discuss the current major national affairs. However, the people of Shanghai seem to be too little concerned about the National Congress. It seems that whether the representatives are produced or not, whether the meeting is held or not, it is all the same. This kind of indifference to national affairs is truly worrying about the future of political tutelage. I hope that the representatives present will understand this and work hard to propagate to the people and continue the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs to build a new Republic of China. The report is over. Then the representatives delivered speeches one after another, which were mostly tragic, impassioned, and aroused the audience. The words are lengthy and</p>
<p>abbreviated.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans (1) The spirit of the revolutionary martyrs is immortal (2) Continue the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs (3) Continue the sacrificial spirit of the martyrs (4) Complete the unfinished will of the martyrs (5) Eradicate reactionary elements (6) Eliminate feudal forces (7) Overthrow imperialism (8) Abolish all unequal treaties (9) Complete revolutionary construction (10) Realize the Three Principles of the People (11) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang (12) Long live the Republic of China</p>

<p>Disaster Situation Film Shown on the Spot</p>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce members Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, and others held a banquet at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce last night at 7 p.m. to raise donations for the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association. Over hundreds of people attended, including representatives from various industries in the city and leaders from all walks of life, such as Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, Kang Jiyao, Chairman of the Shaanxi Relief Association, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Wu Zhihao. The meeting was chaired by Wang Xiaolai, who then invited Yu Youren to give a speech, saying that the Shaanxi disaster was extremely severe and urgently needed relief. Today is the anniversary of the sacrifice of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and it is fitting that people from all walks of life in Shanghai are working to help the people of Shaanxi. Saving the country and saving the people leads to the same goal through different paths, and the significance of the commemoration is even more precious. Then, Kang Jiyao stood up to report on the disaster situation in Shaanxi and the recent relief efforts. Finally, Wu Zhihao gave a speech, asking the representatives of various industries to work hard to recognize donations and create boundless blessings. At 8 p.m., a film about the Shaanxi disaster was shown, showing the red land for thousands of miles, starving people everywhere, and disaster victims eating grass roots and tree bark to survive, with their limbs reduced to skin and bones, looking like living corpses. The tragic situation was unbearable to witness. The banquet ended at around 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Minhang Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Correction</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approves Review</p>
<p>The Minhang Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai County previously submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance requesting prompt correction of the business tax collection regulations and implementation details formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, as they exceeded the scope of the Ministry's outline. This was done to comply with the established case and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It was reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Chamber has received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, stating, "The petition has been noted. The Ministry is currently reviewing the Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax Collection Regulations and will forward the finalized version to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for transmission to the Department of Finance for compliance. This is for your information."</p>
<h3 id="e100">Various Industries Petition for Business Tax Reduction <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Jewelry Industry: There are over 80 jewelry businesses in this city.</p>
<p>There has been an organization of the same industry association, but there is no fixed standard for the size of capital, and there is no fixed scope for the amount of business. Most of the high-end goods are imported. According to the person in charge of the association, in the revised business tax regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the jewelry tax is 10 per thousand. The businessmen in this industry are unable to bear it because the goods are luxury goods, but the industry is not a luxury industry. Imported jewelry has been taxed as luxury goods by the Customs according to the import tariff. There is no luxury in the scope of business. Moreover, there is no fixed amount of capital and no standard for business. Taxing 10 per thousand is factually impossible. Therefore, letters have been sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Tariff Research Committee requesting discussion. A meeting of members will be convened to discuss ways to reduce the business tax and proceed accordingly. However, in terms of the scope of business, if the government reduces the business tax by 2 per thousand, it should be able to bear it.</p>
<p>Ham Industry: The Ham Industry Association previously stated that the 15 per thousand business tax rate set by the Ministry of Finance was too burdensome for its members, causing them to decline. It repeatedly appealed for a reduction and sent Cai Xiaohe and others as representatives to Beijing to petition and present their difficulties. In the revised Jiangsu-Zhejiang business tax regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the ham business tax is still 10 per thousand, while the taxes for most industries have been reduced. Although the ham industry has been reduced to 10 per thousand, it is still included in the highest level of business tax rates. The results of previous appeals and petitions are equal to zero. Therefore, a meeting of members will be convened again this afternoon (30th) at 3:00 pm to discuss and plan to send representatives to Beijing to petition as a final request.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Mayor Zhang's Remarks on Recovering Roads Built Beyond the Concessions <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Daily News reported that the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had negotiated with the ministers of the countries concerned regarding the incident of roads built beyond the Shanghai Concessions, but no results have been achieved. The Shanghai Municipal Government is also making great efforts to negotiate for recovery. Recently, the Concession authorities have met with Mayor Zhang at the Municipal Government several times to discuss the matter, but the extent of progress is rarely known to the outside world. Yesterday, a reporter from the Daily News visited Mayor Zhang to inquire about the progress of the negotiations. Mayor Zhang replied to the reporter, "The Concession authorities have indeed met with the Municipal Government several times to discuss the matter, but they were all informal talks. The main body of negotiations is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ministers of the countries concerned. However, the intention of this government is that all citizens of this country should exercise their sovereignty and absolutely cannot give up any of it. Recently, the police, finance and other rights have been recovered. As for the formalities of</p>
<p>negotiation, it is up to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Public Works Department Establishes a Real Estate Valuation Committee <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Nominating Five Chinese and Foreign Committee Members</p>
<p>The properties in the Public Concession are often changed and improved, and their prices also rise accordingly. However, taxpayers often have disputes with the Public Works Department during valuation. In view of this, the Public Works Department has appointed five representatives of different nationalities to form a committee to adjudicate petitions regarding valuation disputes. In the past, owners could petition the Finance Committee of the Public Works Department for revaluation of land prices within the prescribed period, but there was no way to petition for revaluation of house prices based on rent. Therefore, the Public Works Department's move is convenient for the owners. The five committee members are Zhe Yanfang, Mr. Mizuta, Mr. Naisse, Mr. Louis, and Mr. Comrie. Except for Louis and Comrie, who were appointed by the Public Works Department, Zhe Yanfang was nominated by the Chinese Property Owners' Association, Mizuta was nominated by the Japanese Residents' Association, and Naisse will be the representative of the expatriates of various countries.</p>

<p>What China Needs Now</p>
<p>Is Peace, Not Loans</p>
<p>The China Press reported from London on March 28 that Sir Thompson, leader of the Far East Economic Study Group, was very satisfied with the results of this trip. His report stated that what China needs now is peace, not loans. All members believe that the loan recently proposed by the United States to China will not help consolidate silver prices. However, this proposal has been withdrawn after the silver price has risen slightly. The members also believe that if the United Kingdom wants its commerce in the Far East to progress, it must place its commerce on a competitive basis.</p>

<p>At around 7 pm last night, the B-9 freight train locomotive at McGonagall Road Station, pulling seven heavy cars, was intended to be sent from the E-character freight track No. 10 to the B-character freight warehouse No. 5. When the train reached the No. 26 turnout, the last three cars suddenly derailed. The traffic in the freight warehouse area was completely cut off. Fortunately, it was far from the main road, so the traffic between Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou was not blocked. The North Road Engineering, Mechanical, and Traffic Departments have dispatched workers to repair it and dispatched a rescue vehicle. It is expected to be repaired at around 2 or 3 am this morning.</p>

<p>Displaying the National Flag</p>
<p>Reported for Investigation and Confiscation</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications, stating that according to the telegram from He Yushu, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining, after the Customs ordered the restriction of foreign ships under 100 tons, more than 30 foreign fishing boats in Shanghai suddenly borrowed the names of Chinese people and changed to display the national</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>flag to fish in our country's territorial waters, which is a loss of sovereignty. Please transfer the telegram to investigate and restrict to avoid the recurrence of foreign ships occupying Qingdao and Yantai. If it is found that the aforementioned foreign ships have a license and are displaying the Chinese flag, please revoke the ship's license to maintain the fishing industry and protect sovereignty. After the Superintendent's Office sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Taxation Secretary Mei for detailed investigation, it was reported that</p>
<p>According to the report from the director of the Wusong Sub-Customs of this Customs, it was found that there were four Japanese-style gasoline fishing boats with hand nets displaying the national flag outside the port. The ship names are Shuangtai 1, Shuangtai 2, Xinde, and Xinchang, and they came from Weihaiwei. The shipowners are Shandong people, and their names are unknown. They are reported for investigation and confiscation. After receiving the report, the Customs Superintendent's Office has reported it to the Ministry of Communications for investigation and confiscation.</p>

<p>Since last summer and autumn, Japanese fishing boats have successively come to China to cross-border and invade fishing areas. Since our government did not stop them, and there are more than 4,000 new and old fishing boats in Japan, it is difficult for the fishing areas to accommodate them, and the fish species have been reduced. Therefore, they have crossed the sea to China to fish every day. According to the recent investigation by the fishing industry organizations in this port, there are more than 200 Japanese fishing boats in the seven coastal provinces from Northeast China to Guangdong, especially in Dalian, Qingdao, and Shanghai. Since the Customs has implemented the collection of fishing tax on foreign fishing boats and strictly cracked down on Japanese fishing boats imported as merchant ships, Japanese fishermen have been panicked and are requesting the Japanese government to negotiate with our government for relief.</p>

<p>To Maintain National Business</p>
<p>And Restore Lost Rights</p>
<p>Since the import and sale of Japanese Dongyang fish (also known as salted fragrant fish), it has flooded the whole country. In Shanghai alone, the total daily sales of each fish dealer is more than 10,000 yuan, which has reduced the sales of domestic salted fish. The fishermen in our country have suffered losses for years. Yesterday, it was heard that the fishermen in this port were planning to unite and join forces with the fish dealers in the South City to stop selling Japanese Dongyang fish in order to cope with the situation, maintain national business, and restore lost rights.</p>

<p>The Tu Bu Industry Association yesterday requested the issuance of shipping licenses, and Retelgraph Chen Finance Department·Industry Department·Customs Administration said·The Association learned that the Shanghai Tu Bu South Industry Gauze and Cloth Association has been submitted for the certificate of uniform tax required by the Customs for the export of tax-free Tu Bu. Check that the Tu Bu has long been tax-free according to the regulations on a tax on one thing. It seems that no re-collection will be given to the Chamber of Commerce to apply for proof. The Association has submitted the original submission to the various departments for review, and has also communicated with the Unified Tax Administration for reference to the tax-free case and the inspection and handling of the fifth article of the regulations. April 1 is only three days away, and Tu Bu Gou has no shipping license.</p>
<p>The Customs will inevitably cause damage to the industry. The whole city is in a panic and is urgently requesting that the approval be forwarded. The matters relating to tax-free cases and uniform tax regulations are beneficial to merchants. It may be possible to telegraph the competent authorities to issue shipping licenses to maintain business and benefit the people. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Zhou Weichen: Zhou Weichen, a 30-year-old man from Songjiang, resided at 834 Maigen Road. He had been unemployed for a long time. His wife, Ye Pinzhen, worked at the Boyi Yarn Factory, so she did not live with Zhou. They were husband and wife in name only. On the evening of the 26th of this month at 10:30 PM, Zhou suddenly had a suicidal thought and secretly consumed opium in his bedroom. When his housemate, Jin Apin, found out, he rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital, but the poisoning was too severe, and he soon died. The hospital notified the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched Detective Liang Yuliang to investigate. Zhou left two letters, which stated that he was committing suicide due to economic oppression and nothing else. The body was then taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the Special District Local Court, arrived at the office. The coroner determined that Zhou Weichen died from self-administered opium poisoning. The body is being held for his mother to come to Shanghai for the encoffining and burial.</p>

When the poison took effect, he groaned. The inn reported it to the police, and Yang was sent to Jisheng Hospital on Baoshan Road for treatment, but he died. Yesterday, Yan Liugen, the local security officer of Jiyitu, reported the death to the Local Court for examination. It was approved and the body was encoffined for burial.</p>
<p>Zhang Rufeng: Yesterday morning, around 3 AM, before dawn, a young man suddenly came to the Dada Wharf on the 16th pier in Nanshi. He was elegantly dressed, but his eyebrows were tightly furrowed, and his face was full of unspeakable pain. As he gradually walked to the edge of the pier, he was about to jump into the Huangpu River when Guo Xiushi, a patrolman from the 1st District General Office Pier Police Station, spotted him and immediately rushed over and grabbed him. He was taken back to the station for preliminary questioning. The young man burst into tears and said that his name was Zhang Rufeng, he was 32 years old, a native of Ningbo, and lived at No. 72 Wengjia Lane inside the Old West Gate. He was engaged in the cloth business and was suffering from economic oppression and family discord. He felt that there was no joy in his life and wanted to commit suicide by jumping into the river.

<p>Meng Baorong: The Hongkou Grand Hotel was visited by a guest on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at around 4 PM. The bellboy led him to room 85. The register showed that the guest was Meng Baorong, a 19-year-old man from Wuxi. He paid for the room and sat for a moment before going out to visit friends. He returned around 7 or 8 PM in the evening and went to bed. He didn't get up until noon the next day. The bellboy was very surprised and called out his name outside the door several times, but there was no response. He immediately found a way to pry open the door and saw Meng lying stiff on the bed, barely breathing. A diary was found on the bedside table with a suicide note. The handwriting was very messy and difficult to copy, but the general content stated that he was at odds with his father, left his hometown and came to Shanghai. He often read newspapers that mentioned a certain great philanthropist on the sea who was kind and generous. He packed his bags and set off, intending to visit a philanthropist after arriving in Shanghai and ask for his help. However, he was unfamiliar with the place and could not find him anywhere. He looked back at his empty wallet and felt that the future was bleak. He was ashamed to go home and had no way to make a living in Shanghai. He had no choice but to leave the world. The hotel accountant was informed and immediately ordered the bellboy to call the police and send Meng to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that Meng took too much poison and his life is in danger.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Failure to Report Births Must Be Severely Punished <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Health and Public Safety Bureaus jointly issued a public notice yesterday, stating: "It is hereby announced that the statistics on births and deaths are extremely important for comparing population growth rates and for hygiene and sanitation facilities. Since this bureau has been handling this statistics, many families have repeatedly failed to report births, leading to a large discrepancy between the number of births and deaths each month. We have repeatedly issued earnest announcements and ordered the police to provide reminders at all times. However, our words have gone unheeded. The majority of families who have had births believe that this matter is not easily detectable, so they wait and see, disregarding the government's orders. If this continues, not only will population statistics be inaccurate, but hygiene and sanitation facilities will also lose their standards. After discussions between the Municipal Health and Public Safety Bureaus, it has been decided that in the future, regarding births, on the one hand, obstetricians, midwives, and delivery nurses will be responsible for reporting the facts of deliveries each month. On the other hand, each district office will be ordered to conduct thorough inspections and cross-reference the data at any time. If a family conceals a birth, they will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations. If the delivering personnel violate the regulations and fail to report or report falsely, they will be punished for violating the police regulations once discovered. The order will be carried out to the letter without any leniency. Therefore, we jointly issue this announcement, urging all citizens to abide by it without fail. This announcement is issued on March 29th, the 20th year of the Republic of China."</p>

<p>Was She Marrying through a Matchmaker?</p>
<p>Or Was She Abducted?</p>
<p>Huan Longbao from Xinghua was previously accused by Xu Binglong from Gaoyou of abducting his daughter, Xu Zhaodi. Huan insisted that Zhaodi was his wife. Both parties held their ground. The Special District Local Court decided to send letters to Xinghua and Gaoyou counties to ask for clarification for verification. The two counties have now replied to the Special Court. Xinghua replied that Zhaodi was indeed Huan's wife. Gaoyou replied that the detailed report submitted to the authorities did not contain the name of the Huan family's house or land, and there was no way to find out any other information. The Special Court continued to hear the case the day before yesterday. The plaintiff, Xu Binglong, was absent, which showed that his claims were false. Judge Xiao questioned Zhaodi, who testified that she was originally from Dongxiang, Gaoyou. In December of last year, she was abducted from the fields where she was drawing water by Huan and his relative, Sun Fulan, to Shanghai. She had never married Huan before.

<h3 id="e134">Large Number of Ancient Bottles Discovered in Liuhekou <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Divided into Korean Bottles and Qi Bottles</p>
<p>Most of the residents of 72 Village in Liuhekou, Taicang County, are engaged in fishing. Recently, fishermen in the area have caught a large number of pottery ancient bottles while fishing with corner hooks in the sea mouth. They are divided into two types: Korean bottles and Qi bottles. Korean bottles have four ears, and Qi bottles have two ears. The ears have holes that can be used to thread ropes. It is said that these ancient bottles were used by Han Shizhong of the Song Dynasty after Gaozong crossed south to quell the Miao rebellion to hold wine and reward soldiers. During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Qi Jiguang also used this method after using Zhejiang soldiers to quell the Japanese pirates. After the soldiers drank all the wine, they threw the empty bottles into the sea. The bottles are divided into three sizes: large, medium, and small. Large bottles are about two feet high, medium bottles are about one foot high, and small bottles are five or six inches high. The diameter of the mouth is very small. The style is similar to the current thermos bottles, but the belly is slightly bulging. The texture is very rough and has swirl patterns. The bottom is slightly pointed. Large bottles can hold ten catties of wine, medium bottles can hold five catties, and small bottles can hold two catties. Fishermen obtain them and sell them in the market. Those who are curious buy and collect them. Small bottles cost four corners of a silver dollar each, medium bottles cost six corners, and large bottles cost one dollar. It is a pity that few of these ancient bottles are complete because fishermen need to hook the ear holes of the bottles with rolling hooks to lift them up, and after many years, the bottles are full of sea sand. When they are lifted out of the water, they are extremely heavy. If they are not careful, the bottle ears will fall off and it will be difficult to lift them up. Therefore, most of the bottles obtained have incomplete ears. The reporter is also one of the curious people who have seen these bottles but has no knowledge of antiquities. Therefore, I record this to await the textual research of antiquities scholars. According to the elders in the area, these ancient bottles are discovered every year, but not many. This year, the fishermen in the village have obtained hundreds of them, all of which were lifted from Liuhekou. It is thought that they have been washed away by sea tides over the years. It is said that if they are used to grow flowers, they can last for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Suspect in the Old Case, Nie Dianbang, Found Not Guilty <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Jiangning Local Court Concludes Investigation</p>
<p>Insufficient Suspicion, No Prosecution</p>
<p>Nie Dianbang, father of the deceased Kunqu actress Qin Qiufang, was previously accused by Han Yaozhong, Yao Zhengyang, and others of the Shanghai Jiangsu River Police Team as an accomplice in the assassination of martyr Chen Ying shi in the fifth year of the Republic of China. He was then transferred by the General Headquarters Military Law Department to the Jiangning Local Court for investigation. The investigation by the procuratorate concluded that the suspicion was light, and he was temporarily granted bail. This newspaper has repeatedly reported on this. It is now learned that the court has concluded a careful investigation and decided not to prosecute Nie Dianbang. The full text of the disposition is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Non-Prosecution Disposition Jiangsu Jiangning Local Court Prosecutor's Non-Prosecution Disposition No. 758, Year 20. Defendant: Nie Dianbang (aka Nie Zhenbang), male, 42 years old, from Yutai County, Shandong Province, performer. The defendant's case of suspected homicide, Jianzi No. 4770, Year 19 of the Republic of China, has been investigated by this prosecutor. This office believes that no prosecution should be filed. The facts and reasons are now stated below. Nie Dianbang is the father of the late Kunqu actress Qin Qiufang. On April 20th, Year 5 of the Republic of China (March 18th of the abolished calendar), Dianbang escorted Qiufang and her cousin Qin Xuefang from Shanghai to Little Luzon to perform. They only returned to China in the autumn of the following year. Unexpectedly, after fifteen years, Han Yaozhong and Yao Zhengyang accused Dianbang of being an accomplice in the assassination of martyr Chen Ying shi in Shanghai on May 18th, Year 5 of the Republic of China, and that he had recently arrived in Shanghai with conspiracies and unruly intentions. The report was made by Zhang Zhaoxiang, detective chief of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu River Police Team, who arrested Dianbang on January 6th of this year. The case was transferred by the Military Law Department of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Judicial Yuan instructed the Ministry of Judicial Administration to issue an order for investigation. The case was investigated according to law, and it was concluded that no prosecution should be filed.</p>
<p>The Reasons: (A) The testimonies of Han Yaozhong and Yao Zhengyang are not credible. According to the records, Han Yaozhong and Yao Zhengyang stated before the military judge of the Military Law Department of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force on January 18th of this year: "At that time (referring to May 18th, Year 5 of the Republic of China), I lived upstairs in the alley entrance of Xinminli, Bairbu Road. They (referring to Nie Dianbang and others) were six or seven people who often went to a tailor shop to make clothes. That day, we were chatting when we heard gunshots on the road. We ran downstairs to the alley entrance and saw them running away towards the open space across from Xinminli, heading west. Nie Dianbang and Wu Baoxian were also together," and so on. Yao Zhengyang's testimony was similar. When this court entrusted the Shanghai Special District Local Court to summon Han Yaozhong for questioning, he said, "I was a partner in a clothing store in Xinminli. That day, many people were walking around the alley entrance, including Nie Dianbang and Wu Guohua (aka Wu Baobao), because they often came to my store to have clothes made, so I recognized them." Regarding the previous statement that Nie Dianbang often went to a tailor shop, upon close examination, that shop was not Han Yaozhong's place of work, but merely a statement of what he saw from the alley upstairs at the time. However, according to the later statement that Nie Dianbang often came to my store, it seems that Nie Dianbang frequently went to Han's place and was well known to Han. If Han Yaozhong did have firsthand knowledge of the assassination of Chen at that time, why would his statements regarding his own position be inconsistent? Furthermore, the submitted diagram clearly states that the murderers Nie Dianbang and others fled west (the open space at the west end of Bairbu Road and Pushi Road), which is clearly different from the eyewitness account of Shen Zuyin (Mr. Chen Ying shi's bodyguard), who said that the murderers fled out the back door of No. 14 Sapo Sai Road, heading east to Sapo Sai Road and then south. Moreover, Han Yaozhong previously said that Chen was killed outside the entrance of the Xinminli alley, but later said that Chen was killed inside the Xinminli residence, which is inconsistent with Shen Zuyin's statement that Chen was assassinated in the reception room of Sapo Sai Road (which is consistent with the facts recognized in the previous confirmed judgment of the Shanghai Local Court). All of these factors lead to the conclusion that the testimonies of Han and Yao are not credible. (B) Nie Dianbang had already gone to Little Luzon before the day Chen was assassinated. According to the investigation, Nie Dianbang went to Little Luzon in April of the fifth year of the Republic of China. The testimonies of Nie Dianbang and his wife Nie Hao shi were consistent and unwavering. Furthermore, the Shanghai French Concession Joint Court confirmed in its reply that Nie Dianbang was not in Shanghai when martyr Chen Ying shi was assassinated on May 18th of that year, so he could not have been a suspect. (C) There is no active evidence of Nie Dianbang's crime. Nie Dianbang has been thoroughly interrogated by the Military Law Department of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and this court, and it is confirmed that he did not assassinate Chen. Furthermore, the Shanghai Special District Local Court was requested to interrogate the prisoner Wu Baobao (reported by Han Yaozhong and others as Nie's accomplice) in the theft case, and it was confirmed that he did not assassinate Chen with Nie. As for the newspaper report that Nie Dianbang was the escaped prisoner in the Chen assassination case, the military judge of the Military Law Department personally visited Zhao Yuhuang and Peng Qi, the judges of the first and second instance of the case in Shanghai, and Qin Liankui, the lawyer appointed for defense, and presented Nie's photo to them for identification. They all said that he was definitely not the principal offenders Xu Guolin and Su Zhenfang at the time. Moreover, Xu and Su were already over fifty years old, while Nie was only forty-two years old. Since their ages and appearances were different, it can be concluded that he was not an alias of Xu and Su. In conclusion, the defendant Nie Dianbang does not have sufficient criminal suspicion. Therefore, according to Article 244, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision not to prosecute is made. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu, March 23rd, Year 20 of the Republic of China. This document is certified to be identical to the original. Clerk Zhao Baoqing.</p>

<p>120 Yuan Per Boat</p>
<p>Fishing Boats Request Suppression</p>
<p>Sea bandit leaders Zhong Dakui, Yan Zhenlin, Fu Damou, and others, with their remaining bandit gangs of about 400 men, are looting merchant ships in coastal ports and holding people for ransom. Recently, they have been taking advantage of the fishing season to force fishermen to pay a flag fee of 120 yuan per boat. If they do not pay, the boats will be seized and fishing will be prohibited. The fishermen are finding it difficult to cope with the simultaneous extortion by the three bandit gangs, and the spring fishing season is the most crucial time of the year. Therefore, yesterday, they sent representatives to the Wusong Coastal Defense Office and the Fourth District of the Wusong River Police to request suppression in order to maintain their livelihoods.</p>

<p>River Police Forcibly Claim Cotton as Small Goods</p>
<p>Private Torture Leads to Grandson's Death</p>
<p>Xu, the captain of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's River Patrol Team, received a complaint yesterday afternoon from Luo Yang shi, an elderly woman of seventy years old, who lives on a boat at Yong Sheng Wharf and makes a living by boating. On January 16th of this year, Wu Xing Flower Shop (operated by Chen Tianxi, municipal commissioner of Yangsi Township) in Yangjing Town, Pudong, entrusted me to transport 150 packages of flower clothing from the shop to another port. I immediately loaded the cargo and set off with my grandson Luo A'gen. Unexpectedly, when the cargo ship passed through Wusong, it was spotted by patrols of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu River Provincial Public Security Team, who stopped us and forcibly claimed that it was small goods. We were taken to the district and forced to confess where we had stolen it. We truthfully explained the situation, but we were accused of lying and my grandson Luo A'gen was subjected to private torture, causing him to be covered in injuries. Then, we were transferred to the Shanghai Local Court. After the court investigated and found that we were indeed law-abiding citizens and that the flower clothing was indeed from Wu Xing Flower Shop, we were released and returned home on the 28th of this month. After returning, the injuries that A'gen had sustained from the Fourth District suddenly flared up and he died despite medical treatment. His body was completely purple. Recalling that my grandson A'gen was forcibly beaten to death by the Fourth District, leaving me with no recourse, I am requesting justice. The captain, recognizing the importance of the case involving human life, ordered the local neighborhood chief to report to the Local Court for an autopsy before further investigation.</p>

<p>Suffers Constant Abuse from Stepmother</p>
<p>Father and Daughter Weep Upon Meeting</p>
<p>Jiang Liang sheng, a businessman from Sanlintang, Pudong, who deals in foreign goods, has two daughters. The eldest daughter is already married, and the younger daughter, Pei Hua, is twenty-one years old and unmarried. Jiang's wife died of illness two years ago, and the family lacked someone to take care of them. Therefore, last summer, relatives arranged a marriage for him with a woman surnamed Wu from Yangjiadu as his stepmother. After she entered the home, Pei Hua and her stepmother often had conflicts over family matters, so the mother and daughter rarely spoke to each other. Recently, another quarrel broke out. A few days ago, Pei Hua left home and crossed the river to Shanghai to buy silk and satin at Xiaodongmen. She returned home a little late and was reported to her father by her stepmother. Jiang immediately questioned Pei Hua. Pei Hua, feeling that her stepmother was instigating the situation and causing her father to humiliate her, quarreled with her stepmother again. However, Jiang protected his wife and scolded his daughter. Pei Hua, feeling resentful after being humiliated, suddenly left home on the 22nd of this month, taking all her jewelry with her and leaving a letter at home stating that she was now a nun and would not return home, asking her father not to worry about her. Jiang learned of this and asked people to inquire at various nunneries. Until the day before yesterday, Jiang was informed that there was a young woman at the Wanshou Nunnery in Zhabei who was apprenticing to a nun. Jiang went to the nunnery yesterday to search for her. After waiting for half a day, he saw the woman coming from inside to the main hall. Jiang stepped forward to identify her and it was indeed his daughter. Father and daughter wept uncontrollably upon meeting, which was very sad. Jiang asked his daughter to return home, but she resolutely insisted on becoming a nun and told her father, "Please don't worry about me, Father. It is better for me to practice here than at home. Please go home quickly." Jiang tried to persuade her repeatedly, but to no avail, and could only return in tears. Jiang has now asked his daughter's sister to persuade her to return home, but it is unknown if she will succeed.</p>

<p>▲ A single telegraph pole can withstand the ravages of wind and rain, but a weak youth cannot withstand the pressures of the environment.</p>
<p>▲ A woman who is good at telling other people's love stories is not necessarily strict about keeping her own love story a secret.</p>

<h3 id="e144">The Flow of the Three Seals of Abdication to Foreign Lands <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Yu</p>
<p>The Seal is also called the Qin Seal. Since Emperor Qin Shi Huang, the seal has been used as the emperor's seal. Before the Qin Dynasty, the use of seals on documents as proof of authenticity was not limited to the noble and lowly and was commonly called Seal Writing. The Zuo Zhuan says, "Ji Wu zi sent Gongye to ask for the Seal Writing, pursued him, and gave it to him," which is one example. Emperor Qin Shi Huang obtained the Heshibi jade and had Prime Minister Li Si write "Appointed by Heaven, May He Live Long and Prosper" and carved it into a seal, which became a treasure passed down through generations. When Ziying surrendered to the Han, he presented this seal to Gaozu. Later, when Wang Mang usurped the throne and the various pretenders of the Wei and Jin dynasties, they all fought for the seal because it had the words "Appointed by Heaven" and they used obtaining the seal as a sign of approval. Its gains and losses and the changes in its origins are detailed in Cui Yu's Memorial on the Hereditary Seal. Since Emperor Shun fled, this seal was lost again and its whereabouts are unknown. In the thirteenth year of Hongzhi in the Ming Dynasty, a resident of Hu County said that he had obtained this seal and presented it to Emperor Xiaozong, but he did not use it. The authenticity of the seals passed down through the generations cannot be known. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Qing Dynasty, this seal reappeared. Fan Wencheng said that Emperor Shun of the Yuan Dynasty was forced by the Ming army to carry the seal out of the country and eventually died in Yingchang. The seal's whereabouts were also unknown. Later, a shepherd in the hills saw a sheep that did not eat for three days and used its hooves to dig in the ground. It discovered the seal and returned it to the Yuan descendant Bosuoketu Khan. It was transferred to Lin Dan and then returned to Emperor Taizong, who regarded it as a good omen for entering the customs to replace the Ming Dynasty. However, it is uncertain whether it was the original Qin seal. This publication previously reported that this seal was found in a foreign country (I don't remember which country). It was seized by a sailor in the palace when the Allied forces entered Beijing in the Gengzi year. Later, due to a lack of funds for the journey, he sought to sell it to someone, but the Chinese consulate bought it and planned to return it to the Qing court. However, a revolution broke out in the country and it was not successful. It is now still stored in the home of a certain overseas Chinese. Recently, I heard from a friend that there are still several seals flowing overseas, all of which were carved during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. One is the Supreme Emperor's Abdication Seal, made of green jade with a turtle-shaped handle, half an inch long. One is the Supreme Emperor's Abdication and Continued Instruction Seal, made of green jade with a turtle-shaped handle, also an inch and a half long. One is the Wishes Fulfilled Seal, made in an oval shape. All three seals are in seal script and are stored in a box. The Qianlong period was the most prosperous era of the Qing Dynasty. Military achievements and cultural education both surpassed the past, and Emperor Gaozong's long reign was rare in history. Although Emperor Shengzu also reigned for sixty years, Emperor Gaozong still reigned for four years after abdicating before he died, truly worthy of being called the Perfect Emperor. Emperor Gaozong said that when he first ascended the throne, he swore to heaven that he only wished to reign for sixty years and dared not exceed the number of years Emperor Shengzu was in power. If he exceeded sixty years, he would abdicate. In fact, Emperor Gaozong was fond of grand achievements and spent his life enjoying glory, wealth, and honor to the extreme. Because he could not add more, he made the abdication an event within the dynasty and became the Supreme Emperor, regarding the emperor as even more honorable. His oath to heaven was just a pretext. Therefore, the extravagance and pomp at that time were beyond description and can be seen from these three specially carved seals. Now they have flowed to foreign lands, serving only as materials for museums, which is truly enough to make people feel the sense that the heroes of a generation are now nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>— Lian Nanhu</p>
<p>After the passing of Deng Guangwen of my hometown, people everywhere searched for his remaining manuscripts but knew nothing about them. Recently, I met his nephew, Zhu Jichi, who informed me that there were three volumes of his poems and lyrics in Wuchang. I searched and found them and was overjoyed and unable to sleep. I am proofreading a copy to entrust to printers to pay tribute to him with poetry and report it to Han Ya.</p>
<p>Lonely lamp transcribes manuscript, both calligraphy and sincerity, handling a thousand years of sorrow, a heart-stirring spirit. Dreams of singing and calling become a world away, Jiang Guan desolate has a successor. (The poem sent to Ji Chi says: There is a fine nephew who is very similar) Occasionally talk about flowers and moon, the body is weary, the upper air is thin, the unrestrained spirit is naturally pure. Helping the drunken win the past, now nearly exhausted, how many dust does Jiu Yuan see on the sea? (Thirty years ago, I once invited Gong and Yuan Zhang, Minister of the Province, Qin Wuqi, and Nong to get drunk on a painting boat on Ronghu Lake. There was a horizontal plaque hanging with the words "Sunset Xiao Drums." Gong smiled and said to me, "This is Chen Zhuangyuan's calligraphy." Wu Niang heard this and was quite proud. The moon rose on a cold night, and we helped each other home in a drunken state, which was a memorable event at that time. Now, Gu Zhang and Qin Wu are both buried with grass, and my stomach aches every time I pass the state gate.)</p>
<p>Sima Lingyun is not easy to climb, and his high name should be ranked with the ancients. (Yu Zhai's wall hangs a couplet by Bachelor Shanzhou, with the inscription 顨庵. Gong saw it and was very happy, saying that it coincided with his pen name, so he used it as a birthday gift) I was surprised to see it for the first time at Hongsheng Shop, and I looked for the old inscription by the Yingdong Lake. (I first met Gong at Hongsheng Shop in Xuan Nan. The next day, Gong visited me at the Yiguan to talk about the anecdotes of Ye Yuanli, saying that he had seen Yuyang's manuscript with the phrase "transformed into seventy-two mandarin ducks," which refers to this. After that, I checked the collection and could not find it) How dare I be a later generation of Ziyun? I left office and was lost in the path of Yuanliang. (My late uncle, Wu Kangzhi, retired from office and returned to seclusion, comparing himself to Tao Yuanliang. He built Juyin Villa between Longmian and Fudu. He died only five days after returning home. Gong selected and described a volume of Juyin Villa's remaining poems, saying that it is sad to say that there is no knowledge in the yellow soil and the silent blue code is of no benefit to the underworld.) The fishing companions have white heads, cutting paper to summon the soul until the sun sets in the west.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Anecdotes from the Preparatory Meeting of the Central National Medical Center <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>The origin of our country's medicine has been a long time, but because the people of the country stick to conventions and do not know how to improve, it has gradually disappeared and lost its true tradition. Instead, Western medicine has flooded the market, and the economic invasion suffered every year is truly regrettable. After the late Director Tan proposed it, it was decided at the political conference to hand it over to the Executive Yuan to establish a Central National Medical Center, modeled after the Central National Martial Arts Center. Jiao Yitang and others were appointed to organize a preparatory committee. After several months of preparation, the outline has been determined, and famous doctors from various places have been invited to be initiators. The preparatory meeting was held in Beijing on the 17th of this month, and the talent was so great that it was a grand event. I was invited by a friend to go and watch, so I will describe the trivialities of the meeting to those who care about national medicine.</p>
<p>▲ The preparatory committee almost looked forward to piercing the autumn water The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on the 15th, but it was delayed until the 12th. Only a few dozen doctors from various places reported to the meeting. It was thought that the number of people would be difficult to gather at that time, so it was postponed to the 17th. Unexpectedly, between the 13th and 14th, representatives from various places reported one after another, and the number of registered people exceeded 200. The preparatory committee was too busy to entertain them, so they set the 15th to hold a preparatory meeting at Jinling Spring and the 17th to officially hold a meeting at the National Martial Arts Center. I heard that the reason why the initiators from various places were late was mostly due to occupational problems and they could not easily stop seeing patients, so they all set the time to come to Beijing to avoid delays. The preparatory committee did not know this situation and could not help but look forward to it.</p>
<p>▲ National martial arts and national medicine are brothers in distress On that day, many representatives gave speeches, and the speech of a certain gentleman from the National Martial Arts Center was the most interesting. He said that the government ordered the establishment of a National Medical Center, modeled after the National Martial Arts Center. It is a coincidence that the preparatory meeting of the National Medical Center is being held at the National Martial Arts Center. National martial arts can make the weak stronger, and national medicine can make the sick healthy. Different paths lead to the same goal, which can be regarded as brothers in distress. The National Martial Arts Center has been established for three years, but the national medicine is still in the womb. According to the facts, the National Martial Arts Center should be the elder brother. I hope that this little brother will be born as soon as possible so that the brothers can join hands to lead the people to the avenue of health. The metaphor was appropriate and aroused a lot of spirit from the audience.</p>
<p>▲ The lame man left ink marks on his new clothes There was a lame gentleman running around the meeting place quite laboriously. When asked, an acquaintance said that he was He Yunsheng, a representative of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association. On that day, Mr. He was wearing a newly made satin robe and was very stylish. Unexpectedly, the chairman accidentally spilled ink on his body and quickly apologized. Mr. He repeatedly said it was okay, and said that he was thinking of leaving a souvenir here today, and this ink stain on his lapel could be called an excellent souvenir. So he limped around, showing his lapel to his friends, and everyone was amused by it.</p>

<p>The Russian Clotilde Sakharoff Dance Troupe has traveled to Europe and the United States, and its reputation has been growing. This time, it was invited to Shanghai by the Xia Ling Pei Ke Theatre. Since March 18th, they have been performing every other day, and every night is sold out, no less than the Tanney Xiang Dance Troupe of the Carlton last year. On the night of the 27th, I went to see the performance with three brothers, Shou Juan, Mu Yun, and Ban Kuang. I was very comfortable in my assigned seat. Although there are only four members in the troupe, the programs are varied and there are many patterns. They are constantly introducing new things, which makes people dazzled. The heroine is Clotilde Sakharoff, and the hero is Aoexa andre Sakharoff. Those who specialize in dancing, on the one hand, have fleshy and sensual breasts and legs, and on the other hand, have bizarre shapes and vivid descriptions. All kinds of dances have special advantages. The Spring Flower Dance and the Black Dance are especially enjoyable for me to watch. The male and female characters are both beautiful in posture and equal in skill. The whole body pays attention to the performance of "power". The waist, chest, hips, abdomen, arms, legs, fingers, and toes all contain powerful elements, so every move can give people a considerable sense of beauty. In addition, Gaveau's piano solo is always in tune, sometimes like a slight wave, leisurely and fascinated, sometimes like a gust of wind and rain, the courage is shocking, the technique is amazing, and the sigh is over. According to my experience, Leitlinger's flamboyance is far beyond the reach of ordinary people's fingers, no wonder the audience's welcome is constant. It is said that the troupe originally planned to leave Shanghai and return to Europe immediately, but due to the sincere retention of the hospital owner, they will continue to perform at the original location on Wednesday night of this week, with new programs added.</p>

<p>It is heard that the sound film "Yu Meiren" produced by Yiming Company and entrusted to Youlian Company has been completely completed. The sound is clear and accurate, the plot is sad and moving, and the grandeur and richness of the scenery are only seen in domestic films. There is a "Fang Cao Mei Ren Song" in the film, which was written by Wu Zhongwen Hao Cheng Zhanlu, and the tune was composed by the famous singer Feng Chunhang, integrating the advantages of Beijing Kunming lyrics into one furnace. Xu Qinfang and Shang Guanwu, the two movie stars, jointly sang it, which is both graceful and majestic. It has already been turned into a record and entrusted to Desheng Company on Fuzhou Road for sale, and it will also be broadcast by Tianling Company. Qian Shiyun praised the beauty of Yu Meiren's lyrics, saying that the silver lights reflect the sad history, and the audience sheds tears together. It is doubtful that it is illusion and truth. It is cast into a big mistake, not without reason. The verdant green grass of the world is endless, where are people like jade? The song of high mountains and flowing water becomes musk, and the setting sun of the double tomb remains for the infatuated soul.</p>
<p>▲ Acknowledgment and Introduction The "Football Chess" newly invented by the New Art Company is a pure game with sports meaning. Since its production, the number of sales in this city alone has reached more than 3,000 sets in less than a month. The chess game is ingenious, with thousands of changes and full of fun, which is very suitable for providing entertainment to the general public. I am grateful for the gift I received yesterday and would like to express my gratitude and introduce it.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The architecture of Jia City is grand and orderly, much like the Western-style buildings in Shanghai. It's neither very new nor very old. The trees are lush and fresh, resembling Nanjing in its tranquility and Beijing in its stillness. However, the beggars filling the streets are quite unsightly. Although in India, it is difficult for us to distinguish between ascetics and beggars. Indians do not harm birds; birds fly all over the city, and their songs often enter the ear. Indians do not harm birds above, nor cows below; their equality with all creatures is truly admirable. However, if they encounter someone strong enough to subdue them, they are powerless to resist. Even Westerners in India are transformed and do not shoot birds; the law forbids it. Examining this custom, various countries also have some degree of it. Italy forbids harming doves, and Muslims forbid harming spiders, claiming to have saved their religious leader. Now, Indians' kindness extends to birds and beasts, but they cannot defend their own people, which is lamentable. Observing this, one understands the graded love—love for relatives, love for the people, and love for all things—in China, which is the beautiful foundation for creating universal harmony through the nation.</p>
<p>On the 27th, several Ceylon monks came. The Buddhist layperson greeted them with the practice of touching their feet, reminiscent of ancient customs. This so-called head-to-foot greeting. China does not have this custom, but letters still refer to the recipient as "at your feet," which is somewhat close. Now, Buddhism has completely disappeared in the entire central and northern India, only remaining in Ceylon Island and small states in northern Bhutan and Nepal outside of southern India. From there, it connects to Tibet and extends to China. To the east, from Sikkim to Burma, it connects to Siam and reaches China. The relics of Buddhism in Java are also very abundant, and there are now gradual promoters who are Ceylon Buddhists, not Indians. The Indians I have seen, scholars, gentry, and merchants alike, acknowledge the Buddha as one of the Buddhas, respecting but not worshipping him. When asked, they generally say that they are largely the same. I repeatedly asked for their differences, and they all said that the Buddha only talks about cause and effect and does not mention God, while Hinduism talks about God. This is fundamentally different. I briefly examined the differences between Buddhism and Hinduism discussed in the Gedatsu scriptures, and it was indeed so. Atheism is not suitable for the Indian people. However, since the Tang Dynasty, various esoteric masters such as Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra have all displayed great supernatural powers. Now, Tibetan and Japanese Buddhism both rely on esoteric practices to manifest, so Buddhism cannot be said to be completely devoid of God. Only India and Burma take Theravada as their religion, so they specialize in cultivation and attaining nirvana, self-cause, self-effect, self-nature, and self-salvation. I asked why Ceylon Buddhism is so prosperous. Mr. Xin Han said that according to legend, Buddha once personally preached and transformed in Ceylon. However, Ceylon's written history actually began around 200 BC, coinciding with the Ashoka dynasty. It is credible that King Ashoka sent people to preach everywhere. This is using scientific research. However, Taoist Master Daojie said that Mount Lanka is in Ceylon Island, and the Mahayana Lankavatara Sutra was spoken here, likely through the Buddha's supernatural powers. According to my consideration, it is difficult to examine history based on supernatural powers. Judging from the facts, if one were to travel to Ceylon from the mainland, it would be impossible, but if one were to travel to Ceylon by sea to preach, it would not be difficult. Perhaps the Buddha traveled to Ceylon by sea? However, there is no historical record of the Buddha ever boarding a ship. In the Gospels of Jesus, it is clearly recorded that Jesus rode a boat and a donkey, but Buddhist scriptures do not mention anything. It is difficult to determine.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Wild Grass Poetry Special Issue <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Nanxin</p>
<p>Volume 4, Number 13</p>
<p>The purely literary Wild Grass Weekly, its content is advancing like the tide, more with each issue. Regardless of the size of a publication, it is important to be grand in quantity to attract readers' attention, but it is also necessary to strive for substance in content. Truly great new literary works in China, possessing the highest artistic value, have not yet been produced in the current state of the Chinese literary scene. This is not to be discouraged. In the current literary publications filled with shoddy works, one can adopt an objective artistic perspective to assess their value itself. On the other hand, readers' appreciation has improved to a certain extent. Those boring works containing low-level tastes and catering to the general public's psychology are unwilling to be read by those who have a slight taste for literature. So-called high-level literature with artistic elements is most welcome by these readers, but this high-level literature mentioned here is rarely seen in the recent Chinese literary scene, or perhaps it can be said that it has not yet been discovered. Even if current publications sometimes publish one or two relatively great works, it is still very weak. What we feel is that the gradual increase in readers' appreciation is indeed a good phenomenon that promotes the advancement of literary works. It cannot be said that the literary works produced by the Chinese literary scene in the future will surpass Western literary works. If we continue to work hard with a faithful artistic attitude to create beautiful and supreme artistic flowers, then Chinese new literature can at least radiate brilliant colors and present more great works to our readers. Perhaps this true meaning of hope can be realized soon.</p>
<p>Secondly, to make the new literature flourish and be of the highest quality and worthy of attention, various publications should adopt strict standards in selecting literary works, while simultaneously making serious and faithful critiques of literary works. These are all paths to promote the advancement of literary works. At present, the general trend of large and small publications selecting literary works has moved towards this path of identifying the essence of literary works, which is a noteworthy and good sign.</p>
<p>The Wild Grass Weekly is thin in quantity, but in reality, it is a publication advancing against the tide of the current literary decline. The content is being innovated with each issue, with a determination to not let the words become empty and powerless. It is indeed striving for the literary movement to have an upward spirit. If it is made into a dull and lifeless publication, it is better not to develop in this literary direction. For the barren literary garden of China, there is no contribution to be made, and it is a waste of effort to irrigate it. After reading Wild Grass, we feel that the organizers are working hard and are a group of faithful literary gardeners, irrigating the barren literary garden with their efforts. The works within, due to space limitations, cannot be accommodated as much as possible in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality, we can clearly see that they are adopting strict standards and rarely engaging in shoddy work. The previously published creation special issue gave us a very good impression and can be considered a contribution to the recent creation world, although the works within cannot be praised as mature and reaching the highest peak of art. Following this, what is being contributed to the literary scene is a poetry special issue. Poetry, according to the current situation, should be promoted to make it shine with brilliant colors in the near future. This is hopeful and realistically possible because the artistic techniques of poetry are gradually becoming sound and mature as readers' appreciation increases. In terms of content, it adopts extraordinary themes, and in terms of form, there is a new expression. This is worth our describing. Compared with the poetic techniques of the "May Fourth" era, there has obviously been a distinctive progress. For example, the poems contained in this issue of the Wild Grass special issue are all on the new path of poetry and are rarely seen in the current Chinese poetry scene.</p>
<p>There are six poems and one prose poem, such as Ms. Yu Shan's "Gratitude," Wang Tiehua's "When the Morning Light Breaks Through the Horizon," Zou Fang's "Peeping into the Tomb from the Grave Gap," Mi Luo's "I Am Waiting for You in the Middle of the Night," Wang Fen's "Ah, the Little Lamb Who Lost His Way," He Fu's "Scraps," Xu Yan's "Yearning in a Dream," Charles's "Remembering a Friend," and Tang Zengyang's "Self-Portrait of a Poet." Each of these poems can represent each author's style, and here we can also see the several forms contained in poetry and the new path that poetry should take in the future.</p>
<p>The first one worth mentioning is indeed Ms. Yu Shan's "Gratitude." This female poet seems to be making her debut on Wild Grass, but her poetry is already so mature and gratifying that we should praise her. The passionate abandon is truly like that expressed by Byron. The bold description surpasses the maternal love depicted by the female poet Bing Xin. The structure of the poem is exceptionally mature, the meaning is profound, the wording is appropriate, and the rhetoric is refined, all of which are rarely seen in recent poetry. There are two sections in which I think the most sincere expressions are revealed, which are quoted below for readers to appreciate:</p>
<p>You must deeply understand the heart of the poet,</p>
<p>Like trying to grasp a swirling fish in the depths of the abyss.</p>
<p>It once burned like a volcanic eruption—for you,</p>
<p>It once flowed like a Yellow River breach—for you.</p>
<p>I want to love you, I want to cherish you,</p>
<p>But alas, I fear that you lack courage, my friend,</p>
<p>And will waste my true feelings and sincere intentions.</p>
<p>You love me—love my beautiful appearance,</p>
<p>You cherish me—cherish my youth,</p>
<p>How can I love you, how can I be foolish for you?</p>
<p>The unsound will is drifting wildly in the wind.</p>
<p>Who can keep youth for long in this drizzly dusk?</p>
<p>Such a passion filled with love is carved out with sincere poetic strokes, especially coming from the heart of a girl, it is worthy of our praise and admiration. It is not easy to see such a mature artistic technique. Almost all of Yu's poems are tense and powerful. Finally, her use of repeated sentences to construct the structure shows that the author is moving towards a new path in poetry and not sinking into the vortex of vulgarity, which can be compared with the old techniques. This is also the unique characteristic of this poem. At the same time, the author's consciousness is upward. In this poem, there is no trace of the so-called sadness of the poet.</p>
<p>Wang Tiehua's "When the Morning Light Breaks Through the Horizon" is a heroic nationalist poem. In form, it is extremely oriented towards a new path that has not been expressed by any poet. In other words, it is a poem with a new style and new techniques. From this, we can also see the technological progress of nationalist poetry.</p>
<p>When the morning light breaks through the horizon,</p>
<p>The dewdrops redden our toes.</p>
<p>We roar in unison, watching the clouds fly in disarray.</p>
<p>Ah, the tragic and magnificent rivers and mountains will forever mark a glorious battle.</p>
<p>Beautiful poetic realm, ah, why have you forgotten to wander and sing?</p>
<p>The splashing of blood flowers, ah, how can it match the heroic poetic soul?</p>
<p>Tighten your fiery rhythm,</p>
<p>Seek the life of the nation, not refusing our death.</p>
<p>This novel expression and heroic spirit show that nationalist poetry is trending towards the peak of art and is greater than other general poems, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Zou Fang's poem also represents a style and is also a powerful work.</p>
<p>He Fu's "Scraps" is a poem with neat sentences that was once popular in the Chinese poetry scene. Charles's "Remembering a Friend" is a prototype of poetry in the May Fourth era and is worthy of our attention. Tang Zengyang's "Self-Portrait of a Poet" is a beautiful prose poem. The poems of Wang Fen, Xu Yan, and Mi Luo are also worth reading.</p>
<p>This issue of the poetry special issue has extremely rich content. We can see various new poetic forms and at the same time, it can indicate to us clearly the new path that new poetry should take. This is extremely praiseworthy.</p>

<p>— Anping</p>
<p>4.  "My Gemma"</p>
<p>I got up on the 2nd morning, ate something, and after taking care of my train ticket at the China Travel Agency in Xiaguan, we planned to go to Zhongshan Mausoleum to pay respects to the tomb.</p>
<p>The main reason I was willing to stay in Nanjing this time was to pay my respects to Zhongshan Mausoleum. I still remember when I last left Nanjing in the year of the May 30th Massacre, I thought it wouldn't be too difficult to come to Nanjing again. However, the ups and downs of life pass by in an instant, and it's been a full six years. If I didn't stop in Nanjing this time, who could say when I would come to Nanjing again? So I didn't want to abandon this "convenience."</p>
<p>They all agreed when they heard that I wanted to go to Zhongshan Mausoleum, except that Hao couldn't ask for leave, so he didn't go.</p>
<p>After lunch, it was already one o'clock. We walked together to Shenmiao Kou to hire a car. The driver seemed to want three and a half yuan, and we bargained it down to two yuan.</p>
<p>I suddenly wanted to ride a horse, and Xi and Hongzhu were also willing. I asked them if they had ever ridden, and they both said no. I said that I had never ridden a horse either. So everyone revealed a bit of hesitation, but young people have courage, curiosity, and a fresh and lively spirit. It doesn't matter if no one knows how to ride, as long as they are happy and not forced.</p>
<p>However, horses are too expensive, two yuan per hour. Going to Zhongshan Mausoleum and back wouldn't be enough in three hours, so wouldn't it cost more than twenty yuan for the three of us? It seemed like the price was too high to ride, but I didn't want to give up in my heart. At that time, the desire to ride a horse was so strong that even if the driver was willing to hire a car to us for two yuan, I wouldn't want it. However, the price difference was too great, and it seemed like there was no hope. But Tian Tian actually helped out. Helped with what? Don't worry, I'll tell you.</p>
<p>It turned out that because we wanted to hire horses, somehow there was a misunderstanding, and two horse dealers started arguing with each other. Fortunately, due to the argument, one of them was willing to rent three horses to us at the price of one yuan per hour.</p>
<p>None of the three of us had ever ridden a horse, and none of us had any knowledge about riding. Everyone thought, "I don't want to go first, and I don't want to go last. It's best to be in the middle."</p>
<p>In the end, I still went first. Although I hadn't been to Nanjing for six or seven years, I was naturally more familiar with the route than they were. After passing Fuqiao and Daxinggong, I couldn't help but feel a little timid. Once I got on Zhongshan Avenue, I seemed to have gained courage. After the horse whip made a very graceful gesture in the air, it flashed like lightning across the horse's rear. With a most agile and nimble step, the white horse with a body covered in snow-like patches began to gallop. Like an extremely skilled rider, I held the reins with one hand and pinched the whip with the other, keeping my body steady with the most appropriate center of gravity and the most graceful posture. Whistling in my mouth, the companions on both sides only saw the scenery receding behind us. The wind gently brushed my face, without a trace of coolness. A healthy, lively, and youthful feeling passed through my veins like electricity.</p>
<p>The journey of more than twenty li seemed to take less than forty minutes. A mausoleum of such grandeur appeared before my eyes. I got off the horse, led it to an open space, and tied it up, waiting for Xi and Hongzhu to arrive together before going up. But after waiting for more than twenty minutes, I still didn't see them. I really couldn't have this patience anymore.</p>
<p>With an extremely solemn heart and slow steps, I walked up. Walking on the stone steps, I often turned back to look at the mountain trees like a painting, the white and shallow Zhongshan Road, the black circle of the city wall, and the black dots inside the city wall. "What a magnificent atmosphere!" I realized in my heart as I walked into the Li Gate to sign my name. With the most honorable, proud, and solemn attitude, I wrote these three words on the signature book:</p>
<p>"Chu Anping"</p>
<p>I wandered around the mausoleum for a long time, my heart as still as if it had died. Solemnity occupied my entire consciousness. I really wanted to sit on the stone steps and think aimlessly.</p>
<p>They didn't come until then. Xi often wanted to talk to me, but I didn't want him to disturb my peaceful mood and said, "Please forgive me, let's talk about everything later."</p>
<p>At the foot of the mausoleum, there were many white cloth sheds, like a summer camp of Boy Scouts. They were all selling tea and coffee. We had three cups of cocoa.</p>
<p>At that time, the summit of Zijin Mountain was already covered in a haze. It was going to rain, so we had to quickly get on our horses and hurry back to the city. We didn't even have time to go to Linggu Temple.</p>
<p>Returning on horseback was more skilled and experienced than when we came. Fortunately, the rain didn't come down heavily, just a drizzle. However, this drizzle was better than nothing. You think, riding on horseback, the mood is so smooth and pleasant. Coming back with a little drizzle is really like being a god.</p>
<p>After returning to school, Xi said many complimentary things to me. These words came from the bottom of his heart, but he was truly someone who liked to exaggerate when he spoke. However, I, who usually didn't really want to get his praise, was overjoyed when he said this sentence to me:</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>He said, "When I saw you riding a horse, your posture was so graceful and handsome and natural that I unconsciously associated you with Sanin in Turgenev's Spring Torrents."</p>
<p>Thank you for this sentence. Although it startled me when I heard it, I was indeed happy. Not only happy, but also grateful for his seriousness.</p>
<p>Alas, Sanin, how can I have a beautiful figure like Sanin, a good-looking face, a pair of light blue eyes, a gentle expression, all yellow hair, delicate red and white skin, the most endearing special, natural, pleasant, sincere, and frank expression, a childlike smile, innocent, healthy, gentle, gentle, gentle... Alas, Sanin, how can I compare to such a Sanin as written by Turgenev?</p>
<p>However, honest nephew Xi was really saying it so solemnly that he unconsciously associated it with me when he saw me riding a horse.</p>
<p>Yes, if I were Sanin, if I were someone called Dmitry Pavlovich Sanin, then I would beg God not to let me meet such a woman as Maria Nikolaevna Polozova. If I really met her, then with her thick and beautiful hair, her lovely neck, her beautiful shoulders, her slender figure, her intoxicating and charming gesture that makes people go crazy at first sight, and that woman walking towards a person as if she has brought all the happiness of a person's life to meet him, her soft voice, her long, red, moist lips, the dimples when she smiles, that intimate and seemingly soft voice... and as Pushkin said, whoever meets her will stand still and be fascinated by her, but she is not standing before "the shrine of beauty," but under the magic of a half-Russian, half-Gypsy woman with blooming flowers and flourishing magic, making people stand still and be fascinated by her and never feel reluctant ... and I, I would rather stay with my Gemma and kneel at her feet, pressing my face against her waist and saying:</p>
<p>"My Gemma, rest assured, I will always be yours."</p>
