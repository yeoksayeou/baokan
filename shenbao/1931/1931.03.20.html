<h3 id="c28">中歐經濟會議 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>巴爾幹各國。去年在雅典召集聯邦會議。土耳其亦加入。謀團結合作之方法。模倣國際聯盟。成立一種永久性之組織。并有人倡議締結一關稅同盟。作爲將來政治聯盟之張本。在當時之用意。雖僅謀巴爾幹各國團體之堅固。以防各大國勢力之侵入。然其專注之點。固人所共知者也。今日維也納電。忽有奥德　荷波等國。與巴爾幹諸國代表。在奥舉行中歐經濟會議之訊。是中歐諸國與巴爾幹。將聯結爲一大同盟。是果德奥　之計劃歟。抑巴爾幹願擴大合作範圍以與中歐聯歟吾人尙未知其詳也。</p>
<p>惟從别一方面言。歐洲聯邦計劃。今方在運動進行之際。歐洲聯邦之主要目的。即在策全歐經濟同盟之成功。全歐經濟同盟而果成功。則又何必另謀中歐之結合。一般人之感想。當無不如是者也。故此中歐經濟會議。從中歐與巴爾幹方面言。固可謂爲經濟合作之進步。從歐洲全部方面言。又可謂爲經濟合作增一阻力且歐洲關稅休戰會議甫以宣告失敗聞。而中歐經濟會議。忽又同時發現歐人之感想又將如何乎。</p>

<p>自由談世界小事記  海客　　▲據英國一位生理學家說。學校中一般紅頭髮的男孩與頭髮柔軟而波動的女孩。總和同學們很合得來。因爲他們是最樂觀而最有精神的。　　▲法屬馬逹加斯加島中的士人。對於鷓鴣有一種極奇怪的迷信之俗。他們倘發見了一個鷓鴣的巢。必須將巢内的蛋搗碎。否則他們的母親就有性命之憂。　　▲將牛乳鷄蛋綠色的菜蔬與鯡魚常川同食。能生出一副完美的牙齒。這是英國一位衛生家發明的。　　▲法國某飛行家。曾利用無線電。將一架飛機從巴黎飛到都爾。Ｔours更從都爾飛回。計程二百八十英里。機中並無駕駛員　　▲倫敦動物院中的鴕鳥。全仗丁香糠生菜玉蜀黍菜子肉骨石塊等等解渴。並不飲水。　　▲意大利米蘭Milad城中。有一部分電車。有特别的設備。專供人家出殯時運柩用的。　　▲埃及的婦人。近在要求制定一種法律。將女子出嫁的年齡。延至十六歲。不得早嫁。　　▲據一千九百二十三年八月份調查所得。英國與威爾士的盲人。計有四萬人。歐戰後的軍人尙不在内。　　▲英國斯丹福府司冬StoneSttafs鎭中。有大羣的蜂飛入一家人家。盤據不去。屋中人只得遷出相讓。自殺方法之研究  愼之　　年來自殺之案。層見疊出。識者每謂爲意志薄弱所致。予謂其心理之卑劣。亦一重大原因也。夫希望之成爲事實。以及一切困難之解决。必出之以自已之力量而奮鬥。而後有效果之可言。此常理也。自殺者。因憚於奮鬥。欲求成功而不出諸於自已之力量。其心理之卑劣。爲何如耶。　　天下之所最難得者。决死之精神耳。若能有决死之精神。以辦天下之事。天下果何事不可爲哉。自殺者有此精神。而不以爲天下之事。而以求其死寗不甚愚耶。　　自殺者恃一時之衝動耳。其自殺之後。未死之前。殆無有不自悔其孟浪。而思所以求其不死者。惜乎其已入不可挽回之境耳依法醫學及洗寃錄上所載斑可考用刀自殺者之傷痕。其初下手時必重。收手時必輕。死後。其執刀之手必軟而可以彎曲。蓋皆因悔心之生。而起掙扎求活之徵象也。　　自縊死者。其屋下梁楣枋桁之間。搭繩之處。塵上必滚亂無序。蓋旣繫之後。必生悔死之心。遂竭力爭命。而塵士遂滾亂也。又其屍之大腿上。必有血癊。如火炙之斑痕然。是蓋由於垂死悔恨之極。而卒不得生。於是以兩手拍其大腿。而血遂積而成癊也。　　赴水死者。額上往往有傷痕。耳鼻指甲間。必有泥沙。皆其水底掙扎求活之徵象也。又赴水死者。若有人以竹竿木板近其身。未有不力握不釋者。其求活之心切可知也。　　服雅片死者。往往復蘇。洗寃錄集證載。嘗聞老年仵作言。檢服雅片屍骨。伏者居多。側者亦常常有之。平仰者甚少。蓋因其人埋在土中。雅片毒性退盡。仍復醒活。輾轉棺中。不能復出。久則眞死矣。故其骨殖。不伏則側。實爲服雅片可救之確證也。又記。道光七八年間。粤東有吳姓者。寄居客店。窮極無聊。呑雅片而死。店主人不敢收殮。知此人有親屬在三水地方。遣人往告。迨其親屬趕至。而此人已於前一日活矣。計死已三日四夜。故凡服雅片烟者。輕則心中發燥。亟用活鴨血。或鴿血。或糞汁·或醬油·或凉水。多多灌之。吐盡即愈。或用白礬雄黃研末。清水調灌亦效。又廣東藥舖有藥曰鮮崩碗草者。又名缺碗草。搗自然汁灌之神效。若服多毒重。則身冷氣絶。似乎已死。若肢體柔軟。乃雅片烈性迷醉之故。實未死也。將其人放在潮濕陰地。以竹筷一支。橫放口内。令口常開。以冷水或糞汁等物頻頻灌之。外用冷水在胸前摩盪。每日夜十餘次。又用冷水一盆。將頭髮散放水盆内漂之。愼勿見日光。但身不僵硬。不變色。七日以内。勿遽棺殮。此方曾救活多人云。　　蓋自殺之觀念。不過一時情感之衝動耳。及其　死。其腦中必起清醒之反應。或思及可以不死之道。或思及死而無補於事。反令敵方痛快。或思及事雖無成。此身尙可他用。因而自悔其孟浪。此必然之事也。至若呑服雅片者之死而復蘇。蘇而又死。方其於棺中輾轉反側之時。思潮起伏。悔恨不已。其痛苦爲何如耶。因誌其事。並誌其方。此或有用此方而得活。足以證實之者。希見告焉。記古猗園  沈陛雲　　古猗園。爲南翔名勝之一。相傳爲明時嘉靖年姚姓所置。園離車站約三里許。京滬車抵該處。僅費洋二角半。入園不另取資。入門有一楠木廳。已破壞不堪。其上一匾額。題曰華巖墨海。清書家董其昌眞蹟也。復入内。兩旁枊竹並茂。不次於滬瀆之半淞園。中有石船。曰不繫舟。内設檯凳。備遊客啜茗小息之需。不繫舟三字。爲何長治所書。其他如廬山軒照相館。佈置完備。其左爲曲廊。右爲竹徑。穿鶴守軒。而登士山。遠望鄉村河流。亦足爽心悅目。入柳帶軒。壁上題詩甚夥。悉鄙俚不堪一讀。歸而識之。藉留鴻爪。橘林哀思錄  孫籌成　　國民政府衛生部中央衛生委員會委員俞鳳賓博士學貫中西。熱心公益。爲滬上醫界領袖。以積勞成疾。於去年十二月四日殁於滬寓。年僅四十有六。無諭識與不識。咸爲歎息。全國醫師聯合會中央大學醫學院上海新藥同業公會等七團體。前日聯名發起。在西藏路時濟醫院開追悼大會。以表哀忱。是日到軍政黨學各界領袖曁醫藥兩界聞人甚衆。下午一時半公祭時。恭讀祭文。狀甚肅穆。推刁信德報告俞君行述。大致謂傅士天性篤厚。自少以孝友稱。畢業上海聖約翰書院。得醫學博士後。爲求學問深造起見。又游學美國本雪文義大學。專修内科診斷熱帶病。及公衆衛生學。畢業後。兼得公衆衛生學博士學位。回國懸　海上。爲人治病。不論風雨。驅車即往。暇時潛心著作。刋行書籍凡十八種。又與同志發起組織醫學會。及全國醫師聯合會等團體。行醫二十年。竭忠盡智。活人無算。勞心勞力。致得腎臟症。勸其節勞。則謂人壽修短。視生前事業多寡爲華準。苟能爲社會服務。壽雖促。亦奚害。至理名言。胸襟曠逹。聞者飲泣。祭堂中。供博士西裝半身遺象。架眼鏡。奕奕如生。各界所贈評辭輓聯數百副。遍懸四壁。兹擇最沉痛者。摘錄如下。葉楚傖　曰觥觥國手。何遽云殂。瘡痰满地。孰起沉疴。吳稚暉　曰能活人者偏不假之年。豈造物本不好生耶。鳴呼傷矣。胡樸安　曰國學爲本。醫學爲用。歐美頡頏。蒼和伯仲。維持道心。博施濟衆。著述遺留。名山以頌。鈕惕生　曰醫界之泰斗。民生之曙光。豈意中年而摧折。家國之損失歟。世界之損失歟。天何不懸遺斯人歟。張岳軍輓曰天不假年。留得名山遺簡在。才堪濟世。豈惟仁術活人多。唐文治輓曰鳴呼甥今去耶。益徵天道難知。仁義道德不中壽。吁嗟余心痛矣。惟望善人裕後。孝弟忠信秉遺型。并有不書姓名。僅具痛心友呼愴哭輓者長聯一。文曰公何亟亟歸歟。念平生光　襟懷。肫摯如陳遵。清兹如孟博。汪洋如叔度。高華雋上如元禮。林宗合儒賢藝苑爲一爐。盛氣包含。届指輪君能有幾。僕更　　老矣。恨後死交遊淘汰。輕財想鮑子。知病想涪翁。好義想監門。下士憐才想太邱。小簡擅風雅文明三絶。殘秋怛化。傷心似我最難堪。唱片瑣談  膽瓶室主　　海上唱片事業。至爲蓬勃。推陳出新。競爭甚烈。僕於戲曲一道。素有奇癖。對於唱片。尤所酷嗜。舉凡各公司之佳片。幾搜羅殆遍。日前蓓開公司。又發行新片。余購得十餘種。俱甚愜意。爰將各片佳處。略述於下。爲同嗜者介焉。　　梅蘭芳之唱。以慢板爲最有工力。祭江一片。與前次發行之霸王别姬。結構相同。而韻味過之。馬連良與王又宸配合成片。連良之審潘洪。以瀟灑流利勝。又宸之御碑亭。以蒼老清逸勝。珠聯璧合。允稱雋品。言菊朋以皇帽戲爲最擅長。金水橋一片。精神非常飽满。唱大段快三眼。快如并剪。爽若哀梨。與駡殿宮門帶二片。有異曲同工之妙。麒麟童向不灌音。蓓開獨具隻眼。以重金請其灌唱六片。前次所出路遙知馬力打嚴嵩封神榜三片。已收美譽。此次新出投軍别　掃松蕭何月下追韓信三片。精采更多。别　與潘雪　合唱。雪　之王寳川。搭配亦頗得力。雪　又獨唱小上墳新紡棉花二片。俱幽婉動聽。紡棉花之北平小調與揚州小曲。風光　旋。尤愜余懷。金少山所灌之片。已不下十餘種。發音準確。首推蓓開。此次新出之審李七。前面干板。後面西皮原板。均爲審七劇中之精華。大氣磅礴。聲震屋瓦。聽之使人精神爲之一爽。華慧麟爲坤伶界之驕子。其藝得自小子和李琴仙。在票友時代。已著盛譽。現經王瑤卿悉心指導。爐火純青。益復可觀。此次發行之玉堂春審頭刺湯二片。其清越如梅啘華。其柔媚如荀慧生。蓋華女士平日固師承梅荀者也。（聞華於梅荀之唱片日夕研摩。孜孜不倦。故能得其神髓。）其餘如王无能之哭哭哭。劉春山之壓坍鹹肉莊。陸嘯梧之改良八仙。管无靈程笑亭之印度牧處關諸滑稽片。鈎心鬥角。獨具匠心。絶妙之笑料也。旅歐漫談（五）  汪亞塵　　下午華林陪余等參觀里昂美術館。該館在市政廳之右榜。詎已閉門。美術館與里昂美術學校同一建築。美術館旣閉門。順便先參觀學校。學校中有廣大庭園。其構造乃仿照羅馬式樣。四圍走廊。中間留有曠地。走廊間陳列意大利名雕翻印品甚多。參看一周。華林邀我們到對面咖啡館小憇。這家咖啡館。内部裝置極新穎。咖啡亦可口。爲華林所賞識者。休息約一小時。再步行至里昂公園。此園名金頭。不但是里昂著名公園之一。亦可謂全法國之冠。園内佈置。雖是工人造成。但是點綴得極合天然。入園一瞥。廣約十餘里。樹木茂盛。鳥語花香。隨地皆是。園中有湖。可以蕩舟。里昂天氣不佳。冬春二季。非霧即雨。旅居不甚相宜。余憶及近代法國壁畫大家薛望。是里昂人。薛望畫中傅彩。常模糊含靜穆之感。畫家與自然的環境極有關係。王石谷是常熟人。他畫山的皺法。很似虞山自然的景象。假使薛望不生長於里昂。或者不會有他畫面那些柔　的色彩吧。我看到金頭公園内的迷霧。聯想到薛望的畫面。沿公園散步。在園之後方見各種珍禽異獸。拳養旣久。能意會人語。小孩　食於動物口中。毫無畏懼。園中麻　白鴿。都會飛至遊人手中爭食。歐洲小　不怕人。已成習慣。凡到過歐洲者。皆能回憶。聞此園是里昂大學生物及自然科學敎授等所設計。即一花一木。都不失其天然的現象。歐洲對於花木。都用正實學理去研究。今見此園之設置。即可知法國園藝的一斑。　　翌晨再赴市政廳。先游覽街景。里昂是法國商埠之一。如意大利之米朗。日本之大阪。工廠極多。此問出品。以絲綢爲大宗。近來人造絲工廠甚多。已執全球絲綢之牛耳。講到美術。不過是文明社會的一種點綴。除了里昂美術館外。其精華已盡。九時許抵里昂美術館。入内參觀。歷二小時之久。該館陳列繪畫雕刻之外。尙有磁器陶器及其他工藝美術品甚多。兹將繪畫傑作。略記於下。</p>

<h3 id="e28">Central European Economic Conference <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the Balkan countries convened a federal conference in Athens. Turkey also joined. They sought methods of unity and cooperation. Imitating the League of Nations, they established a permanent organization. Some even advocated the conclusion of a customs union as the foundation for a future political alliance. At the time, the intention was only to seek the consolidation of the Balkan countries as a group to prevent the invasion of the great powers. However, the focus of their attention was well known to everyone. Today, a dispatch from Vienna suddenly reports that representatives from countries such as Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands are holding a Central European Economic Conference in Austria. Will the Central European countries and the Balkans be linked into a great alliance? Is this the plan of Austria and Germany? Or is the Balkan willing to expand the scope of cooperation to unite with Central Europe? We do not yet know the details.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, the European Federation plan is now underway. The main purpose of the European Federation is to ensure the success of the all-European economic alliance. If the all-European economic alliance is indeed successful, then why bother seeking the union of Central Europe separately? The general feeling of people should be no different. Therefore, this Central European Economic Conference, from the perspective of Central Europe and the Balkans, can indeed be said to be progress in economic cooperation. From the perspective of the whole of Europe, it can also be said that it adds an obstacle to economic cooperation. Moreover, the European Tariff Truce Conference has just been declared a failure, and the Central European Economic Conference has suddenly appeared at the same time. How will Europeans feel?</p>

However, the Seiyukai Demanded That Prime Minister Hamaguchi Give Unlimited Answers, Which Was Clearly Intended to Make Prime Minister Hamaguchi Exhausted to the Point of Not Being Able to Rise Again. Then the Seiyukai Caused Chaos in the Meeting Place, and Its Violent State Was Beyond Words. We Have No Choice But to Repel the Seiyukai, Which Is the Same as a Violent Group. The Seiyukai's Statement Said That the Government and the Party Could Not Defeat the Seiyukai's Correct Arguments. The Seiyukai Declared That Prime Minister Hamaguchi Could Be Trusted to Assist the Prime Minister and Made Him Attend, But His Attendance Was Only a Formality and Lacked Substance. Since Things Have Come to This Point, the Hamaguchi Cabinet Should Resign and Take Responsibility. Instead, They Rely on a Majority and Dare to Act Wrongly. Yesterday, the Questions Were Not Finished in the Meeting Place, and Prime Minister Hamaguchi Hastily Went Home, Causing the Deliberations to Be Unable to Continue. Yet the Shameless Party Still Relies on a Majority and Wants to Stop the Questions and Pass the Supplementary Budget in One Breath. The Tyranny Is So Great That It Must Be Said That It Is Unconstitutional. The Seiyukai, in Order to Uphold Party Politics and Constitutional Politics, Has Decided to Rectify Its Wrongs by Political Means.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Electric Communication Prime Minister Hamaguchi Felt Extremely Tired as a Result of Answering Questions in the House of Representatives Yesterday, and Suffered from a Mild Sore Throat. He Stopped Attending Today and Rested Quietly at His Official Residence.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Electric Communication Company Dispatch. The Seiyukai Held a National Cabinet Overthrow Meeting at Marunouchi and Shiba Park at 2 PM Today. More Than 20,000 People Attended the Meeting, Making a Great Show of Strength. The Metropolitan Police Department Sent 1,000 Police Officers and Mobilized Everyone in Case of Emergency.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th, Japan Allied News Agency Dispatch The Seiyukai's Motion of No Confidence in the Cabinet Was Submitted to the House of Representatives at 11 AM Today. Tokonami Took the Floor to Explain the Reasons for the Motion As Follows: 1. The Hamaguchi Cabinet's Economic and Industrial Policies Are Flawed, Depriving the People of Their Livelihood, Making People's Hearts Weak and Vicious, Ruining the National Treasury, Disrupting Financial and Personnel Administration. In Foreign Affairs, the Negotiations With Foreign Powers Are Flawed, Putting National Defense in Insecurity, Regressing and Submitting, Sharply Lowering the Prestige of the Empire, and Losing Rights and Interests. The Government Is Responsible for Policy Flaws and Should Resign. However, the Government Is Shamelessly Attending the Imperial Diet, Disregarding the Meaning of the Constitution. Moreover, Prime Minister Hamaguchi Is Still Firmly Holding Power Despite Being Sick. At a Time When the Fate of the Country Is at a Crossroads, There Is No Greater Disaster for the Country Than This. Therefore, This Motion Is Submitted to Urge Prime Minister Hamaguchi to Make a Decision.</p>

<p>Drafted by Experts from Britain, France, and Italy Representatives from the United States and Japan Do Not Participate</p>
<p>London, 18th, Electric Communication Company Dispatch Whether the Representatives from the United States and Japan Will Participate in the Drafting Committee for the Franco-Italian Naval Agreement Is Receiving the Most Attention From All Parties. As a Result of Today's Meeting Between the British Foreign Secretary and the U.S. Secretary of State Stimson's Representative Moro, It Has Been Decided That Only Legal Experts From Britain, France, and Italy Will Draft the Agreement, and the United States and Japan Will Not Participate. The British Foreign Office Then Announced This Decision. The Text of the Agreement Is Scheduled to Begin Drafting Tomorrow, and After the Draft Is Completed, It Will Be Sent by Britain to the Governments of the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>London, 18th, Reuters Dispatch In Today's House of Commons Question Time, Concerning the Franco-Italian Naval Agreement and Britain's Commitments, Conservative Party Member Cassel Asked Whether the Written Guarantees Given by Britain to France and Italy Would Also Be Given by the United States and Japan as Britain Did (The Guarantee Refers to Britain's Support for Reducing the Caliber of Main Battleship Guns to 12 Inches and for Greatly Reducing the Maximum Displacement of 35,000 Tons). Naval Minister Alexander Replied That Britain's Guarantee Was Not Dependent on the United States and Japan Making the Same Guarantee. Cassel Then Asked If the United States and Japan Did Not Agree to Reduce, Would This Guarantee Bind Britain? The Naval Minister Replied That He Had Said Before Regarding This Matter That the Government Had Expressed Its Opinion on the Size of Warships, But There Was No Agreement. The Naval Minister Continued That the Reduction of Main Battleships Could Not Be Carried Out Too Much. What Is Needed Now Are Warships That Have a Reasonable Opportunity to Resist Attacks From the Air and Underwater. He Was Sure That Past Main Battleships Were Too Large and Too Expensive, But to Greatly Reduce Their Tonnage, There Must First Be Very Careful Expert Research.</p>

<p>London, 18th, Reuters Dispatch Members of Parliament of the Liberal Party Met Today. Before the Meeting, There Were Many Rumors That the Liberal Party and the Labour Party Would Have Closer Ties. There Were Even Rumors That Party Leader George Would Accept an Important Position in the Labour Cabinet. However, There Was No Real Decision at the Meeting Except for Some Discussion. Later, George Moved to Adjourn the Meeting Until March 24, When the Liberal Party's Overall Attitude Toward the Current Government Would Be Considered Again. Sinclair Read Out a Letter at the Meeting Asking to Be Relieved of His Duties as Party Guidance Director Due to Differences in Party Views. George Claimed That He and Sinclair Would Advance and Retreat Together, and That the Situation Was Serious and That He Could Not Allow Anyone Else in His Party to Suffer the Disdain That Sinclair Had Suffered (Received by the National News Agency Telegram). Liberal Party Newspapers Also Hinted That Today's Meeting Would Lead to the Party's Split Becoming More and More Certain. This Is Enough to Indicate That British Free Trade Has Declared the End of Its Life, at Least in the Party Aspect. If the Party Does Determine to Split, Then George, Together With 60% of the Party's Members of Parliament, Will Join Hands With the Labour Party and Implement Important Socialist Reforms. Sir Simon, Together With the Remaining Members of Parliament, Will Openly Join the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>Armored Vehicles Are Also Planned to Be Returned to the Central Government in Full. Claiming That No Vehicles Will Be Left Behind. Fanyang Correspondence The 13th Route Commander-in-Chief Shi Yousan Has Complied With the Demobilization and Reorganization Very Much This Time, But There Is No Way to Settle the Many Veterans. Shi Yousan Originally Had Close Ties With Wan Fulin, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, and Asked Wan to Ask Vice Commander Zhang to Approve the Settlement of Idle Officers and Soldiers of His Unit in Heilongjiang Province. At 2:00 AM on the 12th of This Month, a Special Train Arrived From Beiping, Carrying Two Battalions of Shi's Guards, With a Total of More Than 1,000 Officers and Soldiers. They Were Called Up by Shi to Go to Heilongjiang. When They Arrived in the Shenjing Territory, Because of Insufficient Provisioning, They Stopped at the Xiaoxibianmen Military Station. Guo Shuwu, the Director of the Public Security Sub-Bureau, Approached the Nearby Restaurant to Purchase More Than 1,000 Jin of Flatbread. Shi Yousan Specifically Went to the Station on the Morning of the 13th to Give a Speech to the Officers and Soldiers, Urging Them to Obey the Orders of the Senior Officers After Going to Heilongjiang. The Wording Was Sincere and Earnest. In the Afternoon At 4:00 PM, the Officers and Soldiers Took the Original Train Westward Again and Transferred to Heilongjiang Province Via the Datong Line. Those Who Went With Them Were Liu Yanguang, Director of Military Law for Shi Guo, and Zhang Shenfu, Second Section Chief of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Affairs Department. Another Report Said That After Shi's Unit Was Reduced Twice, There Were About 10,000 Soldiers Remaining. 精干 were Selected to Transfer to the Jiangxi Province to Replenish the Vacancies in the Defense Army. The First Unit of 1,200 People Has Already Been Transported Across the River to Jiangxi Province by the Defense Division. The Remaining Numbers Are Still Being Transferred. Shi Has Been Staying in Shenyang for More Than a Month and Has Not Returned to His Defense Area. There Are Many Rumors Outside. According to Secretary-General Zhang of Shi's Office, The Rumors Outside Are Not Credible. Shi's Temporary Stay in Shenyang Is Because the Funds Have Not Been Fully Settled. There Is No Mention of Urging Shi to Go Abroad or Ordering Another Division to Remain.</p>
<p>The Vehicles Detained by Shi Yousan's Unit Have Been Returned One After Another Through Repeated Negotiations by Various Relevant Parties. Shi Has Followed Minister Sun Ge's Instructions From the Railway Department to Return All the Remaining Vehicles to the Central Government, Leaving Nothing Behind. The Six Columns of Armored Steel Left Behind Are Also Planned to Be Returned in Full.

<h3 id="e91">Cavalry Division Destroys Bandit Gang in Suining <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Liu Rongduo led his gang to flee into the Anhui province. There have always been many bandits active between Xuzhou and Haizhou. Zhang Zhijiang, as the director, previously dispatched the 1st Cavalry Division, Zhang Huatang's unit, to pacify the Xuzhou-Haizhou area. Recently, he also transferred the 3rd Cavalry Division, Zhang ZhanKui's unit, to assist in the suppression. Zhang Huatang set up his command post in [blank space]. Zhang ZhanKui's unit was stationed in Suining. However, the bandit leader Liu Rongduo, nicknamed Liu Ershui, occupied the Lingcheng area, thirty miles away from Suicheng, and besieged villages and towns, engaging in arson, murder, and looting. Liu's gang had previously disturbed the Suining area last year and was suppressed by the 52nd Division under Han Deqin. Liu himself was wounded and fled. Now that he has recovered from his injuries, he has returned to the original location to cause trouble again. The 3rd Regiment of the Zhang Division, led by Cavalry Commander Ma, led a team on the 15th to suppress the bandits. The bandit crowd had about five or six hundred men with guns and stubbornly resisted in the fort. Commander Ma immediately engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits at the Guandi Temple for a day and night. The bandit forces were unable to withstand the attack and more than twenty people were killed. Eight hostages were rescued. The remaining bandits fled south into Anhui province. Zhang's unit is now pursuing them with cavalry. Zhang Huatang also dispatched teams to search and suppress separately and plans to hold a local cleanup. On the 16th, he convened representatives from all sectors of the local community at the Yaowan Command Post to discuss and decide on two matters: first, cleanup measures will be implemented by first checking household registrations and reporting local bad elements to prevent villages and towns from leading bandits into their homes. If bandits are discovered in a certain village and the village chief does not report it beforehand, they will be punished as colluding with bandits. Second, bandit suppression measures will be implemented. If bandits flee to the area, in addition to dispatching troops to suppress them severely, local militias must also assist in the suppression. Or, if the officers and soldiers are unfamiliar with the geography, the militias can serve as guides. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Conflict Between Southern Fujian Militia and Local Army <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Internal strife has also occurred within the local army in northern Fujian. Fuzhou correspondence: The six counties of Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, Dehua, Anxi, and Yongchun in southern Fujian were previously designated by the Security Department as the defense area of the 1st Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army under Chen Guohui, and Chen was also appointed as the commander of the 5th District Bandit Suppression and concurrently the Yongdeannan Police Commander. Chen established a police headquarters in Yongchun and a bandit suppression headquarters in Jinjiang. However, the militias of the various counties in the area have had deep-seated grudges with Chen.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Therefore, they submitted to the 49th Division Commander Zhang Zhen. Zhang appointed Qin Wangshan as the director of the Quanzhou Militia Command. The office was set up in Quanzhou (that is, Jinjiang County). The militias of Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, Anxi, and Tongan counties were reorganized by districts. In addition to the existing militiamen being organized into two types of volunteer teams and reserve teams, each district could also hire strong men to establish standing teams for temporary deployment. Chen Guohui was deeply concerned about the expanding power of the militia. It is said that the Jinjiang Militia had a conflict with Chen's troops due to tax collection issues a few days ago. Both sides telegraphed the provincial government to report. The provincial government, in view of the previous conflicts between the Hui'an Militia and Gao Weiguo's troops and the Yongchun Militia and Chen Guohui's troops, which caused severe disasters, with villages burned and people displaced, which have not yet been restored to their original state, urgently telegraphed to stop the fighting and investigate and resolve the situation. However, it is difficult to predict whether the militia will obey the order to cease fire with just a telegram, since they have already clashed with Chen's troops.</p>
<p>The local army and the militia have long been at odds, and internal conflicts within the local army also frequently occur due to power struggles. Currently, Lu Xinming and Regiment Commander Huang Yuebo in Liancheng, Zhang Ziming and Regiment Commander Chen Heling in Jianning, Qian Yuguang and Battalion Commander Yu Caizhuo, and Desheng in Pingnan have successively experienced internal strife and are deadlocked. Furthermore, the 2nd Brigade of the Marine Corps, because former Brigade Commander Lin Shouguo was dismissed after the January 16th political change last year, the Naval Department reassigned the 3rd Regiment Commander of the Brigade, Lin Bingzhou, to succeed him. The officers of the 4th Regiment were dissatisfied with this and, led by Battalion Commander Lin Jizeng and others, resisted the order to transfer defense in Xinghua. (The Lin Bingzhou Brigade has now been transferred to Jian'ou for defense.) They also demanded that the Naval Department and the Provincial Government replace Lin Bingzhou. If they were not granted, they would declare independence. The situation in the Xinghua area has been very serious in recent days. Provincial Government Chairman Yang Shuzhuang has not yet found a solution. It is said that fellow villagers from Beijing and Shanghai received reports of conflicts between the militia and the local army and specially submitted a petition to the National Government requesting that the Fujian Provincial Government thoroughly suppress the troops of Lu Xingbang, Gao Weiguo, Chen Guohui, and Qian Yuguang to pacify the area. At the same time, the Provincial Party Department also submitted a petition to the Central Government, which was forwarded to the National Government, stating that the provincial troops were extremely complex and the local burden was too heavy, requesting that the Provincial Government find a way to disband them to alleviate the people's suffering. The Civil Service Department of the National Government yesterday sent a letter to the Provincial Government ordering it to investigate and handle the matter accordingly. (March 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Jiangxi Province Implements Business Tax Collection <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Tax collection in bandit areas will be temporarily suspended. Nanchang correspondence: Similar likin taxes and levies in Jiangxi Province have long been abolished, and the salt surtax has also been taken over by the central government. Therefore, income falls short of expenditure by an estimated five to six million yuan. Huang Bozhong, Director of the Department of Finance, specially drafted an outline and regulations for the collection of business tax and submitted them to the Provincial Government Council for approval in order to implement the collection and offset the deficit. It is found that the regulations have been approved by the 354th Provincial Government Council. Director Huang, after receiving the order, decided to first start collecting in prosperous areas, and the bandit areas will be handled later. However, due to the vast bandit areas and sluggish business in the province, the income is still insufficient to make up for the annual likin deficit of approximately two to three million yuan. The Provincial Government has therefore submitted another petition to the Central Government for subsidies to avoid tax rates. The appendix is as follows:</p>

<p>Bonds and Loans: The total amount of bonds and loans in the 18th year was 100,942,710.42 yuan in national currency, which has been detailed in the aforementioned Central Revenue and Expenditure Report. Among them, public bonds and treasury bills accounted for 90,510,656.13 yuan, net short-term debt was 5,107,832.15 yuan, and bank overdrafts were 5,324,222.14 yuan. The names and amounts of various bonds issued by the government during this year are as follows: Bond Name | Issue Amount 18th Year Military Reorganization Treasury Bills | 70,000,000 yuan 19th Year Customs Revenue Bonds | 20,000,000 yuan 19th Year Cigarette Treasury Bills | 24,000,000 yuan Total | 114,000,000 yuan. In recent years, internal strife has occurred frequently. Due to the huge military expenditure, the government has had no choice but to issue bonds to make up for the deficit. Now that unification has been completed, it is urgent to plan fundamental solutions to bring the national finances back on track and eliminate the long-standing problem of living on borrowed money for the past 20 years. This is the consistent policy of the Ministry of Finance. The nature of the various expenditures of the National Government can be found in detail in the aforementioned Central Revenue and Expenditure Report. Details will not be repeated here. It is found that in the 18th year, in addition to the 35,565,000 yuan directly allocated to local agencies by the Salt Revenue Audit Office, the 6,700,600 yuan in central subsidies to various provinces, and the 1,660,000 yuan allocated to provisional and reserve items, the remaining expenditures can be divided into three categories as follows: Category | Approximate Amount | Percentage | (Net Amount) Debt Repayment (Including Debt Paid from Boxer Indemnity) | 185,942,000 yuan | 37.5% Military Expenditure | 245,445,000 yuan | 49.6% Government Administration Expenditure (Including Disaster Relief Expenditure of 10,000,000 yuan) | 49,381,000 yuan | 12.9% Boxer Indemnity Used for Cultural and Educational Matters | 14,306,000 yuan |</p>
<p>Total | 495,074,000 yuan | 100.0%</p>
<p>The distribution of the above expenditures is not balanced, and there is almost nothing worth mentioning for construction projects. However, in the past year, internal strife and chaos have continued in China, and the government has been too busy suppressing rebellions and pacifying the country to carefully consider this. This is also due to the circumstances and should be understood by the people of the country. In recent years, the price of silver has plummeted and foreign exchange has shrunk sharply. In June of the 19th year, Yan Xishan seized the Tianjin Customs and intercepted tax revenue. Although the government suffered from this unfortunate impact, it was able to allocate funds on schedule for various debts guaranteed by national taxes. The measures for clearing salt tax debts announced in September of the 18th year have now been implemented in order. The arrears of interest on British and French loans and Crisp loans have been paid from salt tax revenue. Only the principal remains to be cleared. The amount of the Huguang loan that should be paid from salt tax revenue has also been fully allocated according to the amount. During the government's busy military affairs, it was able to maintain national credit to the end. This is also enough to comfort the people of the country. Debt Reorganization: Last November, when the military affairs ended, the government convened representatives of creditor countries to hold a meeting in Nanjing. The Internal and External Debt Reorganization Committee submitted the principles of debt reorganization as a basis for discussion. This committee was joined by Dr. Wang Chonghui and Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, whose views were more comprehensive. Domestic debt creditors have also recently organized a creditor group to contact the government. Various internal and external debts will be included in one plan and reorganized at the same time, without discrimination, to demonstrate fairness. The reorganization of national debt is a complex process, but it concerns the government's credibility and cannot be delayed. What we earnestly hope is that the foreign debt reorganization plan can be finalized as soon as possible, and that the restoration of national credit will also open up avenues for foreign investment in China. The government has begun to earnestly reorganize the accumulated internal and external debts. The initial step is to allocate 5 million yuan annually from customs revenue as preparation for future clearing. Judging from the government's current financial situation, the ability to repay this debt is very limited. However, in the next 15 years, the amount of money that the government needs to allocate to other types of debts will decrease year by year. The amount of the decrease can be transferred to the fund for repaying debts without solid guarantees. Therefore, the total amount of annual debt costs can also be prevented from increasing when calculated comprehensively. Borrowing Foreign Loans: Recently, the discussion of foreign loans to China has been very noisy. The Ministry of Finance, due to its responsibilities, has given careful consideration to the issue of borrowing foreign capital. Using foreign capital for construction is the late Premier's legacy. Now that unification has been completed and all government affairs are being rectified, many things, such as currency reform, debt reorganization, and the establishment of public utilities, rely on foreign capital. However, foreign investors will ultimately view investing in China with trepidation before our country's budget is on the right track and the financial reorganization plan has not been finalized or implemented. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance firmly believes that sound finances are essential for construction. Furthermore, whether the loan from European and American governments that the general public hopes for can be established still depends on the attitude of the parliaments of various countries or requires international agreements before it can be done. It is not an easy task and cannot be achieved in the short term. The financial policy of our country must not rely solely on this hope. The way to save China is for China to plan for itself. If the government and the people can truly cooperate, carefully plan, and endure hardships to manage affairs, then all the difficult problems can be solved easily. As for abandoning the financial reorganization plan and relying on foreign debt to hope to build a foundation for construction, we believe that it is not advisable. Central Bank: The Central Bank has continued to develop this year. However, the various plans set when the government established the national bank have not yet been fully implemented. This is because military affairs are frequent and there are many local troubles. During the tense situation, the bank has been a very powerful support for the government and its effectiveness is great. The cash reserves and cash held by the Central Bank in various banks in recent years have been high. However, in order to strive for stability, even if development is slightly delayed, it is not a pity. In recent months, the overall situation has been basically settled, and the mission that the bank should shoulder can be carried out in the future. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Another series of robberies occurred in the southern countryside. In the township of Nanxiangdong, nine families, including Zhou Guozhen and Zhou Gui of Shenghuaqing Iron Shop Lane in the county, were robbed on the evening of the 17th by more than twenty robbers resembling people from north of the river. Each carried a gun and waited at the door to rob them. It is estimated that about a thousand yuan worth of clothes, jewelry, and cash were stolen.

<p>The military hospital has been closed. This county was ordered last year to be designated as the 30th Rear Hospital to accommodate more than 400 wounded soldiers. Except for a small number of disabled and incurable, the rest have recovered. It has now been ordered to reorganize the Second Heavy Wounded Hospital and move to Hankou.

<p>The Han family collapse case has been resolved. Han's dilapidated six-room house in Xianghuaqiao, west of the city, had been in disrepair for many years. Last winter, it was repeatedly exposed to rain and snow and collapsed, crushing and injuring the six poor tenant households. The situation was very [blank space]. The 1st District Office tried to provide relief, sending the injured to the hospital for treatment. Those who were not injured but had no place to live were temporarily accommodated by the Joseph Hospital. Now the injured have recovered and their livelihoods are difficult, and finding a house to move into requires assistance. Therefore, District Chief Zhong acted as a mediator and ordered the homeowner to bear the cost of the injuries. Depending on the severity of the losses of each tenant, the Han family would provide compensation. An agreement was reached on the 18th, and the money was distributed separately. The tenants happily received the money and left.</p>

<p>The land tax case has been submitted to the Central Party Department for review. Zheng Chengyuan, the former magistrate of Liyang County, Pan Bin, the Director of Finance, Ren Shuchun, the Director of Education, and Shi Taorong, the party secretary, and other eleven people, refused to accept the Zhenjiang District Court's judgment on land tax fraud and hired lawyers to appeal to the High Court. After the High Court accepted the case, it was handled by Judge Zhan of the 3rd Criminal Division. Zhan believed that administrative officials and party members who accepted bribes of more than 1,000 yuan were subject to the death penalty. Therefore, he specially submitted a request to the Central Party Department last month to indicate whether the High Court should hear the case or whether a special court should be formed. A decision will be made after the Central Party Department's reply.</p>

<p>The startling news of a cook at Qitai Inn committing murder on the road. The kitchen of Qitai Inn's meal delivery service was contracted by Xiang Jingen from the inn's accountant.

The day before yesterday, Afu was dividing up petty cash with his colleague A'er, and they quarreled over the unequal division, almost resorting to violence. After being persuaded by others, they stopped. However, at about 6 am yesterday morning, Afu got up and went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. A'er suddenly had murderous intent and took an iron rake, hitting Xiang Afu's head without asking any questions.

<p>The Rice Shop Manager Embezzles Savings and Negotiations. Du Zhou, a rural woman from Yangming Township in the 3rd District, has 400 acres of good land and 32,000 yuan in cash. She deposited it in a rice shop opened by Zhou, a resident of Zhouxin Town, several years ago and paid interest monthly. However, the shop's business has been sluggish in recent years, and it has suffered heavy losses. In addition, the manager, He, engaged in private embezzlement. Therefore, it was difficult to maintain. The day before yesterday, He sent a shop assistant to invite Du Zhou to the shop, claiming to calculate the interest on her savings. However, the manager had bad intentions and detained Du Zhou's passbook, intending to embezzle the huge sum. At that time, Du Zhou argued with him and He forcibly broke two of Du Zhou's fingernails, causing blood to flow and great pain. After the district chief of the district, Zou Qingxiang, learned about it, he came forward to mediate, but to no avail. The serious negotiations are now underway, and it is unknown how it will end.</p>

<p>The Cai Weng area was robbed again. The Cai Weng area, about seven or eight miles outside Xiaodongmen, is a waterway area with no roads. It is bounded by Kuncheng Lake to the west and Yangjing Pond to the east. A farmer named Qian Taifu, about 40 years old, lives there. He had a son who was married last month. The 16th of this month was the date for the bride to return to her parents' home. Because the road was not far, he returned home that day, and the bride's gorgeous clothes for her first return after marriage were coveted by bandits. At about 10 pm, a bandit boat landed and 14 or 15 people went to Qian's house to rob. Taifu and his son heard the noise and immediately fled and hid in a nearby mud pond. Only the bride was left in the house. The bandits first stripped off the bride's clothes and then searched the house separately, losing about 200 yuan in jewelry and cash.</p>

<p>A robbery occurred in the city. Shen Chengzhai's house in the Huashengyi Transportation Company in Shixiang Road in the city was suddenly visited by seven robbers at about 2 am on the 17th. They entered through a hole in the wall at the back, drove the victim into a room, took out a box cannon to threaten and forbid him to make any noise, and searched wantonly for about two hours before escaping with the loot. After the incident, it was checked that about 1,000 yuan in silver, jewelry, and valuables were lost. A murder occurred in Pengjia Village. Hu, the wife of Liu Yunqing, a farmer in Pengjia Village near Lingkou, had an argument with her sister-in-law Liu Jing on the 11th of this month over a vegetable field. Liu became angry and hanged herself. Her husband, Liu Lianqing, accused Liu Jing of strangling her to death and went to the county to file a complaint. Liu Jing also accused him of moving the body to harm her, etc. After Magistrate Shen read the complaint, he sent an investigator to verify that she had committed suicide. He has now ordered both parties to appear in court for a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>A mother and daughter were injured while catching bandits, and the local security guard was arrested for releasing bandits. Wang Xushan, from Nianjiaqiao in the northern countryside of the county, married Xia and had a daughter who married Wang's son last year. They lived together. Unexpectedly, on the night before last (16th), two bandits suddenly came, one holding a box cannon and the other holding a wooden stick. They broke down the door and forced themselves on Wang's daughter. The daughter resisted desperately and shouted for help. Her mother, Xia, also tried her best to push forward and knock the bandit down. Wang's daughter immediately pressed on the bandit's stomach. Wang Xushan went outside to call for help. The bandit was afraid that he would not be able to escape, so he fired three shots, wounding Wang's daughter. Even though she was injured, she continued to resist and hugged the bandit tightly, not letting go. Xia was also hit on the head by the bandit holding the wooden stick. Just as the bandit was about to escape, Wang Xushan invited two local security guards, Li Hua and Zhang, to enter the door and capture the bandit holding the box cannon. The other bandit saw that the situation was not good and fled through the back wall. Therefore, he handed over the captured bandit to the two security guards for custody. Yesterday morning (17th), Wang and the two security guards escorted the bandit and the injured to the city to the court for examination. However, on the way, the bandit suddenly escaped. Wang immediately arrested the two security guards who were escorting him and brought them into the city. The prosecutor's office of the court interrogated them. According to Wang, the two security guards released the bandits halfway. According to the two security guards, they were robbed halfway and did not release them privately. As a result, they were ordered to arrest the two local security guards first and wait for the investigation. Wang's mother and daughter were both sent to Guangyi Hospital for treatment. It is still unknown whether they will survive.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education approved flexible procedures. The private Yanjing University in Beiping submitted a petition to the Ministry of Education asking whether overseas Chinese students returning to China to study at the school should be allowed to be admitted through flexible procedures.

<h3 id="e105">The Ministry of Education will not temporarily establish a supervisor for students studying in Europe <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>During the Beijing government era, the number of students from our country studying in Europe and the United States gradually increased, and the academic affairs became more and more complicated. In order to facilitate the management of students studying in Europe and the United States, the Ministry of Education had established supervisors for students studying in Europe and the United States. However, the affairs of students studying abroad were complex, especially the funding for studying abroad, which was independently managed by various provinces, resulting in specialized personnel managing affairs being cumbersome and ineffective. Therefore, since the establishment of the National Government, the position of supervisor for students studying in Europe and the United States has been abolished. The day before yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the repeated requests from various consulates abroad, stated that the number of students studying in Europe was large and difficult to manage, and it was indeed necessary to send specialized personnel to manage them. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then sent a letter to the Ministry of Education requesting the establishment of a supervisor or commissioner for students studying in Europe. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education replied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that due to financial reasons, it would not temporarily establish a supervisor or commissioner for students studying in Europe. Regarding the affairs of students studying abroad, please have each embassy designate one staff member to handle them.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education previously received a submission from Beiyang Institute of Technology regarding the old age retirement of Shibrley, an American professor who served full-time, and requested a retirement pension. After the Ministry of Education submitted it to the Executive Yuan, it has been approved. It is now instructed to the Institute of Technology, saying that the petition has been acknowledged. It has been investigated that Professor Shibrley is an American citizen. Whether he can receive the retirement pension according to the example of national citizens applying for retirement pensions has not been clearly stipulated in the regulations on school staff and teacher retirement pensions and survivor benefits. A petition was submitted to the Executive Yuan, which was forwarded to the National Government for verification. Now, the Executive Yuan has issued an order stating that the National Government's order in the case has been submitted to the ninth meeting of the National Government and it was resolved to approve the payment of the retirement pension. Please be informed. It has been investigated that Professor Shibrley has continued to serve in the school until July of this year, which is the end of the 20-year term. His monthly salary is over 200 yuan. According to the provisions of Article 4 of the Regulations on School Staff and Teacher Retirement Pensions and Survivor Benefits, the annual retirement pension should be 1,050 yuan. The final annual salary should not be given separately. The retirement pension should be submitted to the Ministry for approval according to the provisions of Article 13 of the Regulations on School Staff and Teacher Retirement Pensions and Survivor Benefits and Article 11 of the Implementation Rules after the end of this semester.</p>

The chairman reported briefly that he was very happy that the Society was holding its inaugural meeting today and that all comrades were gathered together. Before discussing matters, he wanted to report on two periods: one was the origin of the Society and the other was the preparation of the Society. In the past few years, Guozhang, Comrade Dai Bore, and others had long had the motive to create the Society. Later, in the autumn of last year, a start-up was drafted to solicit comrades widely. Then, in November, a dinner party was held at the World Hotel in Beijing. At that time, more than 40 people attended, and Mr. Cai Zimin and others attended to provide guidance. It was then filed and approved. This was the first phase. After approval, a preparatory committee was elected to hold a preparatory meeting to draft the Society's charter and resolved to temporarily set the Society's address as No. 10 Doujizha and other equipment. The preparation was completed by the end of February this year. This was the second phase. After these two phases, today's inaugural meeting was able to be produced. After the report, representatives from all walks of life gave speeches. Then, matters were discussed and Dai Xun, Qiao Guozhang, Qiu Yangshan, Xu Gongmei, Chen Dabei, Jiang Daonan, Cheng Zhi, Wang Yongyu, Gui Ru, and other nine people were elected as executive committee members. Lang Kuidi, Chen Duhao, Huang Decheng, Wu Shizhong, and others were elected as alternate executive committee members.

<p>The Pacification Office Implements Maritime Pacification</p>
<p>Scheduled to be implemented before the Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>Su Province Pacification Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang recently issued a special order to the local military, police, and security agencies, and specified methods for encirclement and suppression, because pirates were rampant, fishing boats were in distress, and fishermen and merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang repeatedly telegraphed requesting suppression. Those with strength on land will mainly consist of the original pacification troops. In addition to the water police patrol boats, 40 ships will be rented and hired together with the Coastal Defense Office, and two shallow-water gunboats will be dispatched to patrol the Yangtze River along the coast. The Fuhai gunboats of the original Jiangsu and Zhejiang fishermen and merchants will also join. Before the departure date, the warships gathered in Nantong and held a meeting to determine the leadership of the troops and the methods of opportunistic attacks. It is rumored that the large-scale suppression is scheduled to be implemented before the Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>Shenxin Company Failed to Take Over Sanxin Yarn Factory Yesterday</p>
<p>Workers demanded that the aftermath be resolved first.</p>
<p>The factory abruptly stopped the night shift last night.</p>
<p>The base was purchased by foreigners to build a shipyard.</p>
<p>Notice of Shutdown:</p>
<p>General Manager Rong Zongjing of Shenxin Textile Company issued a notice at the factory gate yesterday after buying the Sanxin Yarn Factory machinery, stating:</p>
<p>Notice: Upon initial takeover by the manager, all workshops must not temporarily cease work. Once the transfer procedures are completed, work will resume immediately. It is hoped that all staff, foremen, and workers will rest assured and not cause trouble. March 19, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The Truth About the Sale:</p>
<p>Sanxin Textile Factory has been established for a long time. It was renamed Huasheng Jicheng during the Guangxu period. It was renamed again during the Xuantong period. In the third year of the Republic of China, it was renamed Sanxin again. The initial capital was 800,000. It was 1.5 million when it was renamed Sanxin. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, it was increased to 4.5 million. The factory owner was originally Sheng Xuanhuai, now continued by his sons Pingcheng and Zecheng. It was registered with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce during the Beijing government, but not with the National Government. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, it was registered in Hong Kong and started using a British merchant license. It is rumored that Sanxin owes a huge sum to HSBC Bank, which transferred the factory to China Business Company. China Business Company sold it to Sassoon, which sold the machinery in the factory to Rong Zongjing. The factory building and foundation were sold to the American firm Dalai Steamship Company. It is said that Dalai offered 5.4 million, and Rong Zongjing offered 400,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Rong Expressed:</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Rong Zongjing at the Shenxin Yarn Factory office yesterday. According to him, after the news of the sale of Sanxin Yarn Factory spread, many friends advised me to buy it to prevent it from being bought by foreigners. The deal has now been completed. There are currently 70,000 spindles and 1,000 looms in the factory, and it is planned to rent the factory and continue working for a term of two years. The disposal after the term has not been decided. Today (March 19) the takeover will be implemented. Due to the initial takeover, all factories have to temporarily cease work. Work will resume as usual after one or two days after the takeover is completed. It is rumored that the factory base was purchased by Dalai Steamship Company, which is preparing to build a shipyard.</p>
<p>Notice from the Workers:</p>
<p>All staff and workers yesterday entrusted a lawyer to publish a statement, which read:</p>
<p>Lawyers Wu Jingxiong and Cai Lucheng, representing all staff and workers of Sanxin Textile Company, hereby announce:</p>
<p>According to the representatives of all staff and workers of Sanxin Textile Company and factory, Sanxin Yarn Factory has been established for a long time and has had repeated surpluses. All factory staff and workers have always been diligent. Recently, the factory owner suddenly announced that the factory has been sold and will be handed over to a new owner, etc. However, no concrete arrangements have been made for the bonuses that should be paid to all staff and workers, the retirement pay after the sale of the factory assets, and the severance subsidies. This is practically disregarding the rights that the staff and workers should have. Therefore, all colleagues unanimously decided that, in addition to maintaining order, they would entrust your esteemed lawyers to legally protect their rights and fully represent them in demanding that the factory owner make up for the years of short-paid bonuses, retirement pay, and severance subsidies. Before a concrete solution is reached, if the factory owner intends to use hasty means to arrange for the transfer to a new owner without making the resolution of the employees' essential issues a priority, all staff and workers will vow to oppose it according to the law. Please ask your esteemed lawyers to quickly send a letter to the company to make a request and publish a statement on behalf of the employees, so as to avoid misunderstandings from the owner and the outside world, etc. We have already sent a letter to the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sanxin Textile Company to negotiate.</p>
<p>Letter to the Police:</p>
<p>Yesterday, lawyers Wu and Cai, representing all staff and workers, sent a letter to the Yangshupu Police Station stating the facts, which read:</p>
<p>All four thousand staff and workers of Sanxin Textile Factory have entrusted representatives to negotiate with the factory because the factory suddenly sold the factory, disregarding the workers who have worked for many years, for the sake of their livelihoods and various issues regarding the aftermath. Please understand that this is a labor dispute of a civil nature, etc.</p>
<p>Refusal to Take Over:</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day when Shenxin Yarn Factory took over the factory. At about 4:00 PM, the Yangshupu Police Station first sent more than 20 armed Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order inside and outside the factory. Then, representatives of Shenxin Factory, Zhu Guangcheng, Zhong Kexian, Rong Binggen, etc., and shareholders of Sanxin Factory, Sheng Pingcheng, arrived in three cars to prepare for the takeover. Because there were still no concrete arrangements for various issues regarding the aftermath, all staff and workers expressed their refusal. Thereupon, the factory announced that work would be stopped from the night shift last night, and only the day shift workers were released, and night shift workers were not allowed to enter the factory. Thousands of workers outside the factory came in droves to wait in the middle of the road, without any measures.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan Went to Beijing Yesterday</p>
<p>To attend the National Accounting Conference</p>
<p>Negotiations for the issuance of Shaanxi Disaster Public Bonds</p>
<p>Kang Jiyao Hosted a Banquet for the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>Kang Jiyao, chairman of the Shaanxi Accounting Conference, hosted a banquet for reporters from various newspapers last night at 7:00 PM at Gongdelin Vegetable Society. More than ten people attended. Kang first stood up and gave a speech, reporting on the recent situation in Shaanxi and thanking the Shanghai people for their enthusiasm in donating and the news media for their publicity, on behalf of the disaster victims. He also said that the Shaanxi disaster was extremely serious and unprecedented in recent years. Although donations from various parties were very enthusiastic, they were not widespread enough. The number of deaths in Shaanxi has reached more than 2 million, and corpses are scattered across the fields, unattended. The central government had previously agreed to issue 8 million yuan of Shaanxi disaster public bonds, which was formally approved by the Western China Plenary Session, but it has not been fulfilled. I (i.e., last night) decided to go to Beijing with Mr. Zhu Ziqiao and Mr. Wang Yiting to attend the National Accounting Conference and negotiate with Finance Minister Song Ziwen to expedite the issuance of public bonds. Once there is progress, I will go north to distribute the funds in Shaanxi. I hope the press will provide assistance and urge the government to handle this matter, etc.</p>
<p>Sun Weidong then reported on the disbursement of funds. The party ended at around 9:00 PM. Zhu Qinglan and Wang Yiting also hosted a banquet for business leaders last night at Gongdelin, attended by more than 20 people. Zhu stated that he would be attending the National Accounting Conference in Beijing tonight (i.e., last night) to allocate funds to various provinces and negotiate with the government on the issuance of Shaanxi disaster public bonds. He also intends to return to Shanghai once before going to Beijing.</p>
<p>Shanghai Shaanxi Disaster Relief Urgent Account Association Schedules Final Results in One Month</p>

<p>Freight Transportation Industry Calls Meeting to Reduce Shipping Costs</p>
<p>Meeting of the trade to be held tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Freight Transportation Association has been receiving letters from freight transportation associations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in Xieshi, stating that the Railway Bureau's shipping costs have increased by another 20%. All of our colleagues are still following the agreed-upon prices, which has been affected and calculated to be detrimental. The association's goods shipped by car have very little profit and are struggling to maintain, which is already well known. This additional increase is really difficult to manage. It is believed that the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is the same, including important water transportation relationships. Please lead the way in preparing a document and submitting it to the Ministry for discussion, explaining the various difficulties and requesting a commutation reduction to alleviate the burden and care for the merchants. Our association should also join and request each station association or company to co-sign a public presentation. Otherwise, a joint meeting should be convened to discuss and mutually discuss good strategies. It was heard yesterday that the Shanghai Mutual Freight Transportation Association of Shanghai will convene a meeting of all colleagues on the 21st of this month to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>Various Groups Rise Up to Oppose the Municipal Council's Valuation and Levy</p>
<p>The Municipal Council of the Public Concession has been collecting patrol fees based on actual rent collection, but recently changed to collecting based on valuation. The Chinese Taxpayers Association has received reports from citizens and has sent a letter to the Municipal Council to protest and notify taxpayers that patrol fees should be calculated based on actual rent and not valuation. It was reported yesterday. It is now known that groups such as the local Candy and Biscuit Industry Association have sent letters to the Taxpayers Association, unanimously expressing their opposition. The United Association of Citizens in the Special District held its 22nd plenary preparatory committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. After Chairman Yu Hualong performed the ceremony, the cases were first discussed. Finally, Committee Member Jiang Xinzhao proposed that the Municipal Council should change the standard for collecting donations. For the sake of the interests of the citizens of the district, how should this association try to stop the change and correct it as soon as possible? It was resolved to send a letter to the Municipal Council to warn them and ask the five Chinese directors to do their best to oppose the change. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>National Coal Association Telegraphed the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Please instruct the Purchasing Committee not to purchase Japanese coal. The National Coal Association telegraphed the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which read:</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways, Nanjing, and the Purchasing Committee of the Ministry of Railways:</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that the promotion of national coal has been ordered by the Executive Yuan of the National Government. Your ministry has also enthusiastically expressed its support. This time, the Purchasing Committee of your ministry published a notice for the purchase of national coal, which is a sign of your ministry's efforts to promote national coal, and we are very grateful. However, we have recently heard that the committee still intends to purchase Japanese coal, which is extremely alarming. Furthermore, according to newspaper reports, the committee is clearly purchasing domestic bituminous coal, so there is no need to purchase Japanese coal again. It is said that there is no smoke without fire, so the association is deeply concerned. At a time when the tide of economic aggression is raging, if vested interests are allowed to flow out, it would be tantamount to handing over a weapon to the enemy to attack us. Since your ministry is a national agency and has already promoted national coal, it should order its purchase to set an example for the people of the country. We hereby telegraph your ministry, requesting that the Purchasing Committee be instructed to earnestly purchase national coal to show its support.</p>

<p>On the 25th of this month</p>

He has purchased tickets from the local Dalai Shipping Company for the President Taft, which will depart from Shanghai next Wednesday, the 25th of this month, first to Hong Kong and then to his hometown.</p>

The National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approved the proposal to be raised during the discussions between the two countries on the resumption of relations. Based on this, the National General Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice to merchants across the country to solicit documents and materials from past negotiations between the two countries so that they have a basis for negotiations.</p>

<p>Beijing-Ping Air Transport to Load Mail First</p>
<p>Passengers Can Only Be Carried After One or Two Months</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Beijing-Ping line will officially begin flying on April 1. All stations along the line will temporarily use the Aviation Administration's airports for take-off and landing. Because the construction of the radio machine rooms and machine operator's rest rooms at each station will take time, the company has decided that the Beijing-Ping flights will not carry passengers in April and May. The flights will operate once a day, flying in both directions, carrying only mail, newspapers, packages, etc. The mailing fee standards are the same as the Shanghai-Hankou flights. However, if the destination of the item is near the flight route, a registered mail fee must be paid at the post office to expedite delivery. For example, if a Shanghai resident sends a letter to Huangpi, Hubei, the airmail letter will arrive in Hankou, and if the registered mail fee is not paid, the post office will still send the letter to Huangpi by regular mail.</p>
<p>Investigation After Sino-Foreign Ferry Accident</p>
<p>The Shinchang Ship Sank Completely</p>
<p>After the Shinchang ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ran aground on Sijiao Reef, the company entrusted Mr. Komori, a technician from the Japan Tokyo Salvage Company, to bring divers to the site of the accident to determine a salvage plan. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the Wenzhou ferry Guangji, stating that the ship had inspected near Sijiao and the Shinchang's chimney was still visible above the sea, but it has now completely sunk. The Japanese technician who inspected the Shinchang also returned to Shanghai yesterday and reported the details to the company. Whether to proceed with the salvage has not been announced, but according to the Guangji, the entire ship has sunk into the sea and there is probably no hope. At most, only the engine will be unloaded. The cargo is completely abandoned. It is rumored that the cargo on board is worth a total of 200,000 taels. This matter is borne by the insurance company and has nothing to do with the company.</p>
<p>The Rose Village Only Showed Its Masts</p>
<p>The Norwegian ship Rose Village ran aground off Shantou and has now completely sunk into the sea, with only one mast protruding from the water.</p>
<p>The Whereabouts of the Yangtze River are Unknown</p>
<p>The French ship Yangtze River, which runs between Annam and Shanghai, encountered a reef in the Min Sea after departing from this port. The SOS signal for help was received by an American freighter, the Anacalia, which was traveling from Hong Kong to Shanghai. However, the American ship searched near the Min Sea but never found the location of the shipwreck. It is said that there are more than 300 passengers on board, most of whom are Chinese. The whereabouts of the Yangtze River are unknown. Some say that it has been rescued and will arrive in Fuzhou today. The truth should be known in a day or two.</p>
<p>French New Ship to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>France's Plan to Expand Far East Shipping</p>
<p>The French Mail Company is building three large ships of 24,000 tons to expand its Far East shipping. The first ship, the Forssoso, is 536 feet long, 60 feet wide, and has a horsepower of 10,000. It can travel at 19 knots per hour. It is the largest ship on the company's central route. The cabins are excellent and the best in the Far East, so the ticket price is 5 pounds and 15 shillings higher than the original large ships (referring to the Shanghai-France ticket price).

<p>Gold Prices Soar</p>
<p>A Wild Jump of Twenty-Seven Taels, Strong Market, Chaotic Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, March 19th, the standard gold price reached another peak. The state of affairs was extremely complex and chaotic, changing drastically in moments. The raging tide and giant waves were difficult to quell, causing considerable apprehension. The total fluctuation between the morning and afternoon sessions was thirty-three taels. In retrospect, the final surge was a staggering twenty-seven taels and change, truly unexpected. This was likely due to the continued strength of foreign exchange rates, with the listed prices widening and then contracting. Bank transactions were inconsistent. Moreover, buying and selling within the industry differed. In the morning session, firms like Yuansheng and Yongheng aggressively pursued purchases, covering short positions and turning long. Yuanmao, Yongchang, Shengyong, and some speculators sold. Overseas silver markets experienced a slight decline, and the gold price opened high. However, large players leaned towards selling, and exchange rates tightened, causing a sharp drop of ten taels. Subsequently, buyers became emboldened, and exchange rates turned tight, causing a sudden surge, exceeding twenty taels, surpassing ninety taels. In the afternoon session, firms like Xinheng and Yuanchun maintained strong buying interest, especially with extraordinarily tight exchange rates. The price continued to surge, soaring beyond the 700 tael mark, moving swiftly. However, the available funds were still limited. This morning, it is said that large speculators expect the price to fall.</p>
<p>The opening was slightly weak. From the early inquiries, the May opening price increased by four taels and two qian, reaching 680 taels, then 683.5 taels. Suddenly, large speculators sold off one-sixteenth. The silver price did not rise or fall. Private telegraphic transfers slightly decreased by one-eighth. Later, Yuanmao, Yongheng, and others sold heavily, resulting in a ten-tael drop, totaling 72.5 taels. Initially, the British gold price was 1425, then 14375. Soon after, Fuchang, Zhifeng, Yong, and others bought in, bringing the price back up by four taels. When the initial price was announced, it was 76.5 taels. The listed price had increased by 125 US dollars. The gold price on the 25th saw a slight decrease of 1.25%, but it had no impact and even increased to 78 taels. However, Yuanmao, Yongchang, Shengyong, and others maintained strong selling interest, and the British gold price could be settled at 143125. Banks absorbed 4375, so the market sentiment weakened. At 9:45, the price fell to 70 taels and 5 qian. After entering the market, the foreign exchange market strengthened, and Yongheng, Yuansheng, and others aggressively pursued purchases, indicating a bullish intention. Therefore, the price soared by ten taels, reaching 80 taels and 5 qian at 10:00. Hengxing, Yuanwu, and others sold, and in just over ten minutes, the price retreated to 74.5 taels. Around 10:30, buyers were very active. Chengfeng, Yongheng, Yushunli, Wanxing, and others surged forward, especially with the tightening of British gold. Huabi and others offered 1875, then 0625 for settlement, propelling the market to new heights. In a short hour, the price surged by seventeen or eight taels, reaching 92.5 taels by 11:30. However, there were occasional hidden drops of two or three taels. Soon after, Wu Pin and Bingxing came to sell, reaching 87.5 taels at 11:45. One account said that the price soared by ten taels as Dadecheng, Hengyu, and others competed to buy. As British gold could be sold at 0652, the price rose to 97.5 taels. The market closed at 96 taels at noon, but Wu Pin aggressively sold, causing the price to fall again to 91-92 taels. The announced price was changed to 739 taels and 8 qian. The discount was small, around 62-63 taels to 70 taels, and 43-44 taels at noon.</p>
<p>After a rapid surge, the afternoon market opened at 92.5 taels, then 89 taels, reflecting the residual momentum from the noon close before weakening. Subsequently, the Indian exchange rate reported a small increase, returning to 93 taels. However, there were frequent fluctuations of three or four taels.

<p>The situation in the yarn and cloth market is slightly better.</p>
<p>The yarn market is rising again, and the trend is slightly firm. This is because the price of American cotton has risen, and the exchange rate remains strong, leading to good sentiment. Actual demand in the market is gradually developing, and the Sichuan traders are very active, which has shaken the market. There are more buyers in the market, but a certain large merchant remains strong and has no intention of letting go. However, ordinary retail investors view the bottom goods as substantial and have a strong intention to sell. However, considering the global situation, there is currently no drastic downward trend. The future situation depends on the current needs.</p>

<p>American cotton rose by more than ten pounds yesterday. American cotton rose because the同業 bought in and the empty amount was抵補. Sellers were lacking, and the market situation was calm and firm.

Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 25 points. Indian cotton initially firmed due to purchases by European exporters, Japanese merchants, and speculators.

The grain and rice market shows a circling trend.</p>
<p>There were not many sources arriving at Zhabei yesterday, but the sales market felt flat. The high-end white粳米 could still be sold, and the price was stable. The middle and low-end ones were sluggish and slightly decreased. There was also a circling of角外 between the morning and noon sessions, and the overall trend seemed to be stabilizing. The thin稻货 was slightly more expensive, but there was no honor or disgrace. The situation for ordinary and low-end sheep秈 and 杜子秈 was weak, and transactions were not very active, and the price was mediocre. The top goods of 通變陰元 were still good, and the rest were gradually sluggish. The斛脚 turned down, and the market was barely stable.</p>
<p>The source of supply at Shanghai South yesterday continued, but sales were sluggish and there were few transactions. Changxi and Beigeng were soft. The price of Jiangsu and Tongji粳零 fell. The price also showed a downstream trend and was weak. The supply and sales of South帮薄 early rice were poor, and the market shouted low角外. Sheep and Du尖 were tired and无神, and the mixed goods were increasingly quiet. 白元 was very flat, and 元 such as 中闲 were slightly shortened. The标粉 was flat and uninspired.</p>
<p>The flour market continued to be flat and tired yesterday afternoon. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat was good, with prices around 12 jiao, and the gold price was stable, the trend seemed to be转坚. However, the total number of 寿码 on the exchange was exceptionally large, and the volume thrown out by each factory was over 10 million bags. Although the purchasing power of outsiders was also considerable, it was inevitable that there would be stagnation. In addition, the sale of foreign wheat was temporarily suspended, and the quotation for foreign flour was again active. It was heard that the selling price of Citibank flour was only 2 yuan and 7 jiao, and the price including the handling fee was only about 1 qian and a half. In this situation, people were ultimately uninspired. As a result, the current month was 7 li and a half lower than the previous day, April was 1 fen and a half lower, May was 1 fen lower, and June/July was 5 li lower. The wheat market is sluggish as before.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market did not show a good performance after the opening in the morning. Because the foreign wheat continued to be priced at 3 taels and 1 qian and a half, and the transaction was confirmed, most people's hearts were naturally more soft. The lowest price for this month was 3 taels and 9 qian and 1 fen, and the rest were also 34 fen lower than the previous day. Afterwards, the gold market recovered and people's hearts were slightly better, but the situation was still bleak and optimism was difficult. The current situation is that if the exchange rate continues to rise, it may continue to be weak. As a result, the current month was 1 fen lower than the previous day, April was 2 fen lower, May was 4 fen lower, June/July was 2 fen lower, and August was 1 fen lower. The price of North-South goods and orchid seeds increased by 3 taels.</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of orchid seeds, they have been sold out for a long time. It was found that the Zhejiang ship arrived from Xiamen and运到 a batch of 11 items. Among</p>

<p>Building a Library and Gymnasium｜The Private Ginling Girls' Middle School of Soochow Operates with Perfect Facilities, Excellent Teaching, and Diligent and Disciplined Scholarship. In its past history, eight or nine out of ten of its graduates have gone on to universities, such as the famous National Central University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Ginling College, Soochow University, and Shanghai University. Every year, when these universities recruit students, all the graduates of this school who apply are admitted. Those who serve society are also highly reputable. In the past, a well-known figure in education called this school the national center for women's education, which is not an exaggeration. March 15th of this year was the date of the school's board meeting. The meeting was held at 2:00 PM that afternoon. More than ten board members attended, including Meng Xiacheng, Zhang Yigeng, Zhang Yipeng, Cai Zimin (representing Wang Zhongzhou), Li Genyuan, Wang Maozu, and Yu Qingtang, all of whom are well-known figures of their time. Among the matters discussed were the expansion of classrooms and dormitories (the school's buildings are still new, but the number of students has increased dramatically in recent years, making them insufficient; this year, because new students were not admitted, many who wished to enter were turned away) and plans for various improvements. It is heard that the original library is no longer sufficient, and plans are now underway to build a new library. Funding has been secured and construction will begin soon. In addition, due to the emphasis on physical education, it has also been decided to add a gymnasium, which should be completed soon. At present, the government is striving to reorganize the education system. The school's teaching is both practical and comprehensive, and the teaching staff are all appointed from among the most accomplished scholars at home and abroad. Moreover, the facilities are being expanded and improved as quickly as possible. Therefore, women in the country who aspire to study need not worry about not having a good school.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The Hidden Reefs in the Japanese Sports World <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Conflict Between the Sports Association and the Equestrian Federation - Both Extremes Are Difficult to Resolve (Tokyo Correspondence) The Japanese Sports Association recently decided to select athletes from nine sports, including track and field, swimming, rowing, soccer, hockey, boxing, ice skating, snowshoeing, and equestrian, to attend the 10th World Olympic Games to be held in Los Angeles, USA, next year. In the budget, equestrian was listed as a separate expenditure. It is surprising that this abnormal situation exists in Japan, which is known for its unified sports administration. The hidden reefs here are obvious, and the Sports Association is facing the Equestrian Federation in a head-on confrontation. According to the charter of the International Olympic Committee, athletes attending the Games must be affiliated with their respective national Olympic committees, and the Japanese Sports Association is the national Olympic committee of Japan. All the sports organizations that have decided to participate in the Games this time, except for the Equestrian Federation, are affiliated with the Sports Association, so there is no problem with the athletes' participation. The equestrian athletes have always been represented by army officers and students, and the number is almost zero. At the 9th Games, they also participated with a special budget and the recommendation of the Sports Association. This time, the Sports Association has repeatedly written to the Equestrian Federation, citing administrative unity and compliance with the charter of the International Olympic Committee, asking it to join the Sports Association, but all have been rejected. Finally, the Sports Association formally notified the Equestrian Federation that it could not approve the qualifications of equestrian athletes to participate because it was in violation of the charter. The conflict between the two sides then arose. According to Equestrian Federation Director Colonel Yusa and Major Kido, the Sports Association, at the risk of great disapproval, has used despicable means to force the Equestrian Federation to join the Sports Association, which has a special motive. After joining the Sports Association, all finances, etc., must be subject to its control, and the Sports Association can then implement its trick of encroaching on the Equestrian Federation's funds. However, the Equestrian Federation is different from other sports organizations. The equestrian representatives are all nobles and officers, and all actions are related to the honor of the Japanese nation and the prestige of the national army, so the expenses are self-funded, and it is easier to raise funds. This time, the Sports Association, as an organization representing the whole country, has acted in a threatening and coercive manner, which is a pity. The Equestrian Federation is determined to oppose joining the Sports Association to the end, and has obtained the approval of the Minister of the Army and the Inspector of Cavalry. It has already sent a letter to the Ministry of Education on the 8th expressing this intention. (Note: The Japanese Ministry of Education has the power to supervise all sports organizations.) Sports Association President Kiyoshi Anai declared that the Equestrian Federation's joining issue is entirely a matter of the charter of the International Olympic Committee and has no conflict with the Sports Association itself. The Sports Association will always adhere to this kind of hardship and spirit of abiding by the law to prevent future problems from happening. The procedures for the Equestrian Federation to attend the last Games were not in compliance, but this was a flexible measure to suit the circumstances at the time. If it continues to be done, it will become a precedent and violate the constitution of the Games. From the perspective of international dignity and credibility, the Sports Association will never compromise.</p>
