<p>巴黎今日法外長白里安以國聯理事會主席名義、致函日代表芳澤、建議中日兩國立派代表商定撤兵辦法、措辭雖婉和而語氣堅定、此間觀察時事者、以爲日本雖不受理事會最近决議案之拘束但應遵行九月三十日决議案實踐其可能的迅速撤兵之諾言、白氏此時顯欲舉全世界及國聯道德的壓力相逼迫、俾可對於滿案立即派出監視員與公斷員、現中國旣己允派代表考慮有關撤兵問題、白氏自母庸再以同樣堅决態度對中代表、故本日單獨致函芳澤也、函中大旨係請日本追念九月三十日理事會之决議案、且十月二十四日日本所提議案、與理事會請日軍於十一月十六日以前撤盡之决議案亦有一部份相同、該决議案雖無拘束力、而道德的力量實超越一切、請日本追憶其中與日本提案相同之各節及日本贊　以可能的最速撤兵之事實、芳澤大使曾允對於理事會决議案、立予考慮、現中國己遵行該案内中日立派代表商定撤兵與接收細目一節云云、（五日路透社電）</p>

<p>根據鹽署副稽核報告</p>
<p>日内瓦今日中國代表施肇基有公文遞交國聯理事會、報告日本在滿洲軍事當局佔據稅捐機關之事、據施氏之報告、日本軍隊在本省將鹽稅全部提去、用以資助現在日本軍人在東省設立之傀儡政府　　請看暴日侮辱國聯之鐵證</p>
<p>（一）譯意</p>
<p>在此境界犬之氣勢異常兇猛</p>
<p>（二）譯意在滿洲開戰危機切迫之時犬即夾尾鑽入賣内</p>
<p>、該項鹽稅曾經中國政府用以抵押外債、故日人此種舉動、於外國利權影響甚大、施氏報告書中、引用中國鹽務稽核總所會辦克利佛蘭博士之正式報告爲根據、克利夫蘭博士報告驚中指明日本軍人在九月十八日以後之東三省鹽稅一槪封存、（一）牛莊積存鹽稅共一百零八萬、長春二百六十萬、日本軍人不許匯解與南京中央政府、并在牛莊强調没收鹽欵六十七萬二千餘元、（二）克利佛蘭報告書指斥日本軍事當局現正竭力將各種中國稅收提作别用、（四日國民社電</p>
<p>南京日内瓦五日電、國際財政問題、或將因東省事件而受影響、中代表施肇基己通知國聯行政院、謂日軍在東省任意扣留鹽稅、並將該欵交與在日軍卵翼下之僞政府使用、因鹽稅爲中國外債擔保品故日軍行動己造成嚴重新局面、同時施又將鹽稅署副總稽核克利佛蘭報告送國聯會其要點、（一）自九月十八日後、本省鹽稅日軍己一律扣留（二）牛莊鹽稅一百零八萬長春二百六十萬、日軍己拒絶交付中政府、同時又將牛莊積存之鹽稅六十七萬二千七百零九元、全數没收、日軍現復擬將東省每月爲外債擔保之二百萬移作别用、（五日專電）</p>
<h3>駐美日大使向美政府聲明</h3>
<p>修橋非以運兵爲目的</p>
<p>華盛頓駐美日大使出淵向國務院聲稱、日本在滿洲未有各路進兵之意、滿洲日兵之最近行動、目的在修理己被炸毁之鐵橋、以便大豆之運輸、因南滿鐵路每年收入、以大豆爲大宗也、日本旣無各路進兵之謀、自無開放此路以使運兵之意且橋樑被毁之河、不久即將冰凉、如日本果欲進兵、則無妨稍待、履冰過河云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓今日美國務院接哈爾濱美總領翰森報告、日軍在北滿行動、似僅欲修復嫩江鐵路橋、因此一般人對於日俄將起衝突之焦慮爲之稍釋、四日國民電）</p>

<p>今日日内瓦訊國聯方面對行政會所將採取處理滿洲問題之第二步驟甚多猜疑國聯會員將以中日雙方皆不肯讓步而大費周章夫事勢至此國聯諸會員固必甚成困難然謂中日皆不肯讓步則非事實蓋今日之事祇有日本可言讓步中國則一聽國聯約束並遵國聯之决議而極力保護日僑生命財産之安全而設接收委員會以待日本撤兵之談判固無所謂再有所讓步也如中國接受日方先商原則而後撤兵之議則非特爲我全國人民所萬不能承認且適違反國聯之决議不遵守國聯之决議必欲於國聯决議之範圍以内而再有所讓步在國聯則顯示其怯弱而喪失威信在中國則獲破壞國聯决議之咎而更自喪其國格我國人豈有愚騃至此故今日之國聯衹能希望日方之讓步而不能再希望中國之讓步也</p>
<p>日本先旣以絶無理由而出兵以絶無理由而擾亂我東北釀成今日如此危險之局而則今日欲收拾此危險之局面當然須先令日本撤兵而後可言談判國聯固亦認中國方面最低限度之要求爲正當而有此一致通過决議今日本非特不允依期撤兵且在我東北着着進行其擾亂政策着着展布其永久佔據之計劃務欲陷世界於大混亂之域而後己如此情勢國聯除希望日本之覺悟外寗有他法日本不覺悟則國聯惟有憑公理盡力量以進行其所謂第二步驟耳我國人無他言惟有靜待國聯第二步驟之處置</p>
<p>雖然國聯第二步驟之處置果可恃耶我國人當然知其不可恃也不可恃則我國人惟有準備我自身之第二步驟我自身應採取之第二步驟第一固在國人一致犧牲而一致犧牲尤貴能一致合作事急矣今日之黨國要人尙忍斷斷爭是非鬭閒氣耶</p>

<h3>英總選舉保守黨勝利之意義</h3>
<p>對内…保護資本家增加生産</p>
<p>對外…注重殖民地擴張貿易</p>
<p>喬治謝絶自由黨國會領袖</p>
<p>倫敦訊、全世界注視之英國總選舉政府黨以五百五十一名之絶對多數獲勝、與在野黨比較、相差至五百餘名之多、此項絶對多數、不僅出於一般預想之外、於英國議會史上實無其先例、工黨自一九○六年以來、其勢力繼續增長、迨至本年、形勢逆轉、一蹶而復歸於二十年前之狀態、其慘敗原因約有三端、（一）英國財政之危機（二）小選舉區制、（三）工黨内部之分裂、此三端之中、最重要者爲財政危機、最近英鎊暴落、極爲猛烈、鎊價之即落、爲英國喪失世界金融覇權之證、亦可謂英帝國世界覇權之動摇、其財閥不能不積極擁護保守黨、實行强度的保護關稅政策、力圖鎊價之安定、目下全世界汲汲於關稅之競爭、而英國之採取保護關稅政策、使全世界關稅競爭更加猛烈、殆無疑義、英國將於貿易上與列强開始激烈競爭、同時法美兩國力爭金融覇權、此爲新政府之最大使命、其對内對外之一切政策、必以此使命爲根據、對内則保護資本家積極增加生産、對無産階級不得不加以相當壓力、對外則注重其殖民地及一切商塲之和平與安寗、努力於銷路之擴張、以世界和平爲外交上之標榜、對於殖民地之擾亂、與以世界革命號召之蘇俄、必取强烈之壓迫政策、可斷言也、據英國一般政界之推測、新内閣旣佔絶對多數、在其内部倘能維持協調、可保其政權至五年之久、但關於保護關稅問題、保守黨與自由黨出身閣員之間、極難有一致態度、世界經濟之不振、仍難樂觀、保護關稅之政策必使世界經濟發生致命之恐慌、亦係意料中之事、故保守黨之上台、爲一種過度期之現狀、工黨不過暫爲雌伏而己、（世界社）</p>

<h3>科學的孩子</h3>
<p>問眞探眞兩位小寳寳</p>
<p>你們知道現在是一個科學的世界科學的世界裏應該有個科學的中國科學的中國要誰去創造呢？要小孩子去創造！等到中國的孩子都成了科學的孩子那時修我們的中國便自然而然的變爲科學的中國了</p>
<p>我希望你們倆從今天起立刻變爲科學的孩子是怎樣的變法呀？</p>
<p>你們要攀上科學樹去摘幾個科學菓子我現在送你們兩種書一是小朋友書店出版的兒音生活一是兒音書局出版的兒童科學叢書這些書會敎你們怎樣攀上科學樹怎樣去摘科學菓子怎樣變個科學的孩子</p>
<p>這些書不是給你們看乃是引導你們玩科學的把戲做科學的實騐如果你們藏而不看看而不做那就算是辜負我的好意了</p>
<p>現在差不多要到冬要到冬天了，你們怕就要戴上手套吧？科學的孩子的手是一天忙</p>
<p>到晚用不着手套你們向媽媽禀告說「今年我們都是科學的孩子不再戴手套了請您把買頭繩的給我們買實騐的材料吧」</p>
<p>我寄给你們的東西請你們放心吃！從前買可可糖送你們我必先吃一塊看看裏面壞了没有這次送你們的科學菓子我都嘗過你們放心吃吧！</p>
<p>這些科學菓子裏有幾個是我親自摘的放在花籃裏一起送給你們這樣我送給你們的菓子同時可以送給全國的小朋友一同嘗新時代的孩子一定贊成我這個一舉數得的辦法</p>
<p>父們吃了這些菓子我不希望别的報酬只希望你們每星期寫一封信告訴我玩了這個科學小把戲做了幾個科學小實騐使我知道你們是的確變了科學的孩子抱着决心去創造一個科的中國我就心滿意足了</p>
<p>祝你們努力向科學樹上攀攀得高高的把那肥大的菓子摘下來給全世界的人吃不要只顧自己吃得一肚飽忘了樹底下的民衆</p>
<p>你們的爸爸也是你們的朋友</p>

<h3>鄉下人又到上海（八）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>這時兩個人爲了一張畫報幾乎打起來大家勸住了說這没有什麽多大關係的兩位何必閑爭呢</p>
<p>一刻兒工夫又講到别的事情上去了</p>
<p>「近來江西的朱毛不知情形如何了」這是一位喜歡談時事的客人他到處都是談時事有時也牛頭不對馬嘴說蔣百器和蔣百里是弟兄唐生智是唐紹儀的兒子還說袁世凱如今没有死宋老太太有七子八壻張天師今年只有十二歲宣統皇帝和衍聖公結爲親家等等此刻不知是那裏聽得來的忽然提出了朱毛問題</p>
<p>這時全車子裏也没有一個人接他的下文可是鄉下人却覺得這空氣太寂寞了</p>
<p>「朱毛的情形我倒曉得一點兒　」他要賣弄他有這一點兒知識在許多座客之中得意地這樣說了</p>
<p>在他的旁邊却睡了一個人那人是穿了一黑拷綢的短衫敞開了胸裏面露出了雪白的汗衫下面也穿了一條黑拷綢的大肢管褲撩到了膝蓋骨上露出了小腿上茸茸的黑毛拖了一雙漆皮的鞋子他雖睡在那裏睛睛是閉着耳朶却是張着你們同車的人說什麽話他都留心聽着現在他聽得坐在傍邊的鄉下人自己說「知道朱毛的情形」他微微張開了他的眼睛慢慢兒坐起來假做打了一個呵欠使人知道他是剛纔睡醒撮着笑容向鄉下人點了點頭</p>
<p>「老先生－你倒知道朱毛的情形嗎？」他開始向鄉下人問了</p>
<p>「我知道一點現在朱毛的價值不小呀」</p>
<p>「是的是的－」穿黑拷綢衫褲的人和他接腔</p>
<p>原來這穿黑拷綢衫褲的是一位偵探他正在要查共産黨這回坐火車也正爲了查案而來他閉緊了眼睛張開了耳朶正想聽一點兒關於共産黨的消息忽然有個鄉下老頭兒自己承認知道朱毛情形這不是一條魚兒自己跳進網裏來嗎？他想怪不得人家說共産黨是專門去煽惑農民有好幾處地方在鄉村間搜出了共産黨來瞧他這樣一個枯瘦的老頭兒土頭土腦的却暗中和共産黨通氣今天無意之中被我偵探着這個功勞不小咧</p>

<h3>日本人口過剩嗎</h3>
<p>— 風舞</p>
<p>日本帝國主義朝野一致舉國若狂亂嚷地少人多的人口過剩底怪調、未免言過其實了、然而「裝腔作勢、」「放大厥詞、」又是日本人一致的傳統思想呵、依地理的關係而淪、日本全國、面積共有一七六○○○方哩、而朝鮮亦有一四三一二方里（日方里）、除開臺灣琉球彭湖諸島不計外、亦有一九○三一二的面積、假令日本人口在八千萬來算、每方哩平均也不過二百餘人、何况日本人口尙不到六千萬呢、據大正十四年的調查日本人口只是五九、七三六、八二二、從大正九年到十四年、其人口增加數爲三、七七三、七六九、其增加率爲六·七％而己、據一九二九年世界新聞的調日本的人口、全國男子共有三、一六八、三四○女的共有三一二五四八○○統計共有六二九全國男子共有三、一六八、三四○女的共有三一二五四八○○統計共有六二九三八二○○、而同年僑居我國内地者亦有二四五、六三四日僑（見三月份案勒評論報）、但日人之移殖滿蒙者則無人得知了、沽計起來亦有十萬以上吧、依此而論、日人的人口生産速率無論如何强、從其開口唱人口過剩的怪調始而迄現在的今日、也没這回事、只是暴日底侵華狡技、鼓動其人民移殖我國、壩佔我國的領士底一種兇惡政策、及翻亂世界聽聞的恐嚇手段就是了、關於這點願我國人世特别注意、以墮其奸計之中、</p>
<p>兹從生産方面來視察、日本人滿的問更是子虚、兹據英人登肯歐衞利（Dan_can　C.Onaurell)著的日本並不人滿一文爲證（該文曾載日本廣告報）、他依統計的分析方法、解剖日本、人滿的事是虚一僞的、兹攝述其要點如下、</p>
<p>第一表人口與食物（表示日本人口與重要農産品增加比較的指數）</p>
<p>年度人口米麥甘薯豆</p>
<p>一八八三一○○一○○一○○一○○一○○</p>

<p>一九二六一七二一九四二四五三八二一五六</p>
<p>一九二七一七五一八八二三六－－－－</p>
<p>在一八八三年各項原有數這樣、人口三九、七○○、○七九、米三○六九二○○○石的、麥是二、四七九、○○○石的、甘薯是二六○、○七二、○○○石的、而豆則係二、三二二、○○○石、</p>
<p>依上表就可明白、日本米的生産的增加率、實實在在比人口增加大、而麥　　第二礦業（日本人口與礦産出品的速率比較表）</p>

<p>一九二五一○五七一八九九三一六九一五九一○三</p>
<p>一九二六一○七八○一○八九八一九一二二六一○八</p>
<p>然而在一九二年的時候、人口是五七、九一八、六七一、鉛－六九四五、三五七斤、鋅－二六、二四一、二四六斤、銅－一一二、九八七、三八一斤、錫三四－一、八五一斤、琉璜－三六、九○八、二六六貫、煤－二九、二四五、三八五咪噸、</p>

<p>一九二四二五三二二八</p>
<p>一九二五二六六二四四</p>
<p>一九二六二五八二五四</p>
<p>在一九一七年時絲織品數－一○○、○八三、八八八元、棉織品－三○四、四九○、二五六元、毛織品－五二、二一八、三六一元、人口則爲五五、六三七、四三一、</p>
<p>以貨幣值價爲標準、雖則是缺憾、然而其漲落的曲缐大致與其實際生産上相近、從這表上看來紡織品的生産銳進向上加增、比諸其人口增加曲線爲大、大似此則人口與紡織品底生産率比較、前者遠不如後者之增加率之速、</p>
<p>再從生絲方面加以研究、其生絲的生産率也非常的迅速而且佔日本經濟中重要地位、在過去十年中、生絲的出産幾增至一倍、同時在他方面其價值也增加了三倍、號稱人口稠密的日本有此眞實的現象、眞是咄咄的怪事了、兹錄生絲表如後、</p>

<p>一九二五一七二一六七二一○</p>
<p>一九二六一九四一○六三一二</p>
<p>按在一九一七年生絲的生産總量數－六、○三四、四○六貫、－其價值爲三二二、五五一、六六○元、而人口則爲五五、六三七、四三一、</p>
<p>從上表－生絲與人口增加率加以比較、何者爲速、前者之增加率遠過於後者多多了、</p>
<p>於運輸方面加以視察、人口增加率遠不如運輸率增加率之神速、兹日本人口增加率和運輸事業擴張的比較如後、</p>
<p>年度鐵路運輸噸輪船運輸噸人口</p>
<p>一九一七一○○一○○一○○</p>
<p>一九一八一一一一○八一○一</p>

<p>一九二四一五四一九四一○九</p>
<p>一九二五一六六二○七一一○</p>
<p>一九二六一六八二○七一一二</p>
<p>查一九一七年時日本人口爲五五、六三七、四三一、鐵道運輸噸數爲四二、一○○、七三四、輪船運輸噸數爲依可以調查者爲一、七一七、七二四噸、由此可知、人口的增加速率遠不及運輸率增加的神速了、人口過剩在這種情况之下又得了反證了、日本人口過剩可以成爲問題嗎、</p>
<p>兹再就日本人口與煤氣電氣生産增加率舉證如下、</p>
<p>年度人口電氣煤氣</p>
<p>一九一七一○○一○○一○○</p>
<p>一九一八一○一一○九一二一</p>
<p>一九一九一○二一二二一四一</p>

<p>一九二三一○八二二一一八八</p>
<p>一九二四一○九二五六一七六</p>
<p>一九二五一一○二七八一九○</p>
<p>一九二六一一二三四四二二○</p>
<p>依一九一七年日本人口－－五五、六三七、四三一、電氣－－八○五、二八九基羅瓦特、煤氣－－一八五、二四七、九六八立方米特、依此而論、日本人口增加率也不及電煤氣事業之進展來得快了、况且煤電氣事業的建設、需要巨額的投資、這種投資也含重層義意上是固定的、第一對於産品的關係是固定的、第二對於地點是固定的、因爲這些産品袛能在煤汽廠或電汽廠附近出售的、因此這種事業祗能在一個己經富庶的地方或表現出富庶可能的塲合而建立的、煤電汽之生産和分配在經濟學上的這種轉質、在這表内有特殊的意義、／</p>

<h3>中國移民南洋問題</h3>
<p>— 丘斌存</p>
<p>（一）殖民與移民</p>
<p>人們對於殖民與移民的一般的解釋、以爲「個人或團體、以營業謀生爲目的、不問有否經過本國政府特設殖民或移民機關應有的手續、離去祖國、坐車或乘船、向他的目的地進發、致力於勞動謀生者、和他偕往的父母兄弟姊妹妻子同伴、都可以呌做殖民或移民、」</p>
<p>其實殖民與移民二者、有絶不相同的界說在、殖民的英文爲Settlen或Colonizer、就是拓闢者的意思、殖民地的英文爲Settlement或Colony就是供己國殖民而包含有屬地的意思、移民的英文爲Emigrant或Immigrant、就是僑寓外國的意思、</p>
<p>前人對於殖民地的定義的解釋、己經有了很多種的見地、有共通性質的說法、是以本國人民的一部份徙殖於本國以外的地方、而使該地方隷屬於本國政府的統治權之下、建設成一和本國同樣文明的社會制度者、呌做殖民、至所謂殖民地者、就是指在這個組織下面的地方而言的、更明白的說、殖民地一切的現象是本國民族精神的反映而己、</p>
<p>就南洋各國來說、許多許多異國異種的國民、同居雜處、在各國各種僑民中占最大多數者、要推華僑首屈一指、然我們的華僑、只能稱做移民、而不能稱做殖民、那塊給我們居留的地方、只可謂爲我們的移民地、而不能謂爲我們的殖民地、因爲那個地方的統治權屬之别國的政府、而不屬之我國的政府故啦、</p>
<p>這樣看起來、殖民與移民、殖民地與移民地、不同的界說、在有統治權的獲得與否以爲斷、現在殖民與移民的界說弄清楚了、就可以來說我們南洋移民的區域、</p>
<p>（二）南洋的區域</p>
<p>我們披開世界地圖一看、亞洲大陸的南邊、有香港·澳門·台灣·菲律賓屹立着、溯海而進爲越南·暹羅·缅甸·暹羅介於安南缅甸兩者的中間、南行爲馬來半島、是即地理上所稱的印度支那半島、更南就爲蘇門答獵·婆羅洲·爪哇亞里伯·香料羣島等、合分布於太平洋與印度的　　諸大小島嶼、總稱南洋羣島、此中領土能夠保全、主權能夠完整、而稱爲獨立國者、惟暹羅一國而己、其他都淪爲美法英荷等强國的殖民地了、這些地方爲美法英荷等帝國解决經濟矛盾的尾閭、也即爲中國「取之無窮、用之不竭」的寳藏的外府、南洋羣島的地位、南自赤道下十一度起、北迄赤道上二十七度止、西爲東經九十度起、東至一百四十度止、包含一十萬平方哩、人口一百兆、現在各地的面積與人口列表顯示之、</p>

<p>香港原爲我國的地方、自中英鴉片戰爭、我國失敗後、不得己於一八四二年在南京締結媾和條約、將香港割讓於英國做殖民地、本來不可以同其他别國的殖民地視之、</p>
<p>澳門於香港未割與英之先、原爲我國沿岸對外的唯一貿易巿塲、清時由葡人年納五百兩的租金、租與葡人、至一八八七年、葡與清締結條約、於是澳門成爲葡正式的領地、這個地方、我們也不能視爲尋常别國的殖民地、</p>
<p>台灣原爲我國屏藩、於民國前十七年、（道光二十一年－公曆一八九五年）因朝鮮内亂而引起的中日戰爭的惡果、在中日講和締結馬關條約之下、與澎湖羣島割與日本、這回地方我們當然也不可看做其他别國普通的殖民地、</p>
<p>就是菲律賓、越南、暹羅、缅甸、爪哇…等地、昔日也曾或則父事我國、或則進貢結納、到了現在「桃花仍舊、人面己非、」我們要知道自己怎樣的不肖、而失掉這些肥沃「天府之國」、而須怎樣的奮發才好呢、</p>
<p>南洋的地域、面積、人口、約略說過了、就要來說南洋中國移民的數目、</p>
<p>（三）南洋中國移民的數目</p>
<p>我國在海外的僑民、計有一千萬人的樣子、單單南洋和台灣的華僑、就有了九百萬人、現在我且把南洋各地我們移民的數目、和士著與别的殖民移民的數目、作比較的表顯示於後、以見我們　民地位的重要、</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops on the Tao'Ang Railway Line Attack Ma Zhanshan's Forces Again</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Increased to Two Thousand</p>
<p>Artillery Fire Exceptionally Fierce</p>
<p>The battle on the Harbin-Tao'Ang Railway Line is raging. Japanese troops have been attacking since the night of the 4th and have not stopped. The Amano unit of the Japanese army stationed in Jilin dispatched over a thousand infantry and artillery troops on the night of the 4th, transferring them from the Siping-Tao'an Railway to Jiangqiao Station. Japanese troops from various locations are continuing to increase their forces in that direction today. The number of Japanese troops invading the Tao'Ang Railway has reached two thousand. One brigade of the newly organized Black Army reclamation troops, along with one regiment of Zhang Dianjiu's cavalry, set out for the front lines this morning. Part of Su Bingwen's brigade is also being mobilized. Ma Zhanshan has ordered that any officials who abandon their posts without authorization will be executed. Although fierce fighting is currently underway on the front lines, Heihe City remains calm as usual. In the night battle on the 4th, the Japanese army increased its troops from Tao'an, using armored vehicles with searchlights to direct artillery fire. Our troops used the reeds along the riverbank for cover and fought against the enemy. The enemy also attempted to secretly bypass our rear with a hundred ferry boats from the north bank, intending to carry troops across the river, but were repelled by our machine gun teams. Many enemy soldiers drowned as the boats capsized. By 3:00 AM on the 5th, the enemy troops were defeated and retreated. This morning at 6:00 AM, it was learned that they had launched another attack. Five airplanes also came over our troops' airspace, dropping bombs to assist in the attack. The current state of the most intense battle is still unknown. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Harbin, the Japanese troops who invaded the Tao'Ang Railway Line were repelled by our troops at 3:00 PM on the 4th and have all retreated to Tao'an. At 6:00 AM this morning, the Japanese army launched another attack with approximately five hundred infantry and artillery soldiers. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, and the firing and aerial support have been incessant since morning, pressing towards our trenches. They even managed to briefly land on the riverbank, but were all repelled by the loyal and courageous Wu Brigade. At 1:00 PM, the vanguard of the Black Army's First Brigade arrived and joined the front lines. With our troops reinforced, morale has doubled. At 3:00 PM, the enemy was defeated, with over three hundred killed or wounded. Our troops have now dug trenches in the Jiangqiao area to defend against further invasions. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Harbin, the Black Army has established a general headquarters, with Ma Zhanshan concurrently serving as the commander-in-chief and Xie Ke as the deputy commander-in-chief. Wang Jingxiu is the chief of staff. The staff department is divided into three groups: military affairs, military balance, and intelligence, with Shi Lanbin, Jin Kuibi, and Wang Zhilan serving as directors respectively. Tang Fengjia, Li Menggeng, Jin Xijun, and Cai Yamin serve as adjutants. Ma Zhanshan, due to the unreasonable coercion of the Japanese army, is encouraging all soldiers and civilians in the province, saying that even if there is only one soldier or one general left, they will not allow the Japanese army to invade Heilongjiang Province. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Harbin, the northern section of the Siping-Tao'an Railway was destroyed by the "righteous bandits" of the Three Harmonies Society on the evening of the 4th, preventing the Japanese army from advancing towards the Tao'Ang Railway. A train of Japanese armored vehicles from Gongzhuling set out to suppress them on the night of the 4th, but the bandits had already escaped. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Harbin, the Heilongjiang Provincial Government has issued a notice to foreign consulates stating that the areas along the Tao'Ang Railway, the Nen River, and Jiangqiao are military zones and prohibit foreigners from traveling there. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Nanjing, a telegram from Harbin dated the 4th states that on the morning of the 4th, dozens of Japanese soldiers crossed Jiangqiao and advanced towards the Jin'gang Stone Land of our Daxing Station. Our troops, in order to maintain peace, did not resist. The Japanese soldiers then detained three of our sentries. Later, after negotiations between the Japanese consul and our representatives, the Japanese occupied Jiangqiao. A Japanese officer verbally announced that our troops were to withdraw from the Daxing defense area before 12:00 PM that day, otherwise they would launch a fierce attack. Chairman Ma immediately informed the defense area officials to not engage with the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army continued to fire at our defense area. Although our side exercised extreme restraint, the Japanese army continued to advance step by step. Subsequently, more than two hundred Japanese infantry soldiers crossed the river and attacked our troops. Our troops, for the sake of self-defense, had no choice but to resist. Currently, the Japanese army has retreated to the opposite bank of the river, but it is reported that a large number of Japanese troops are still preparing to launch a major attack. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Nanjing, a certain party received a telegram from Ping that, according to reliable reports from Jiangsu Province: (1) At 1:00 AM on the 3rd, a unit of Japanese troops crossed Jiangqiao and fired at our positions and threw bombs. Our side did not retaliate. The Japanese troops then retreated to Jiangqiao. (2) At 2:00 PM on the 3rd, two Japanese airplanes came to reconnoiter our positions. (3) Six more trains of Japanese soldiers arrived in the Tailai Wumiaozai area. (4) Four more Japanese airplanes arrived in Tao'an. Japanese soldiers are also disguising themselves in Chinese clothing and mingling with the civilians. (5) The Tao'an radio station is no longer functioning. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Nanjing, officials received a telegram from Ping. The message relayed the telegram from acting Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province on the 4th, stating that the Japanese army's demand to occupy Daxing Station was ineffective. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Japanese army disguised themselves in Chinese clothing and, along with local bandits, fired guns at our positions. Later, two airplanes circled the positions and dropped bombs, killing and wounding more than twenty of our officers and soldiers. They are advancing step by step, leaving us no room to avoid them. We are currently holding our original positions and striving for legitimate self-defense. It has been discovered that Daxing Station is entirely within the borders of Jiangsu Province. The Japanese army demanded repairs and then occupied Daxing Station, sending a total of six trains of soldiers to Jiangqiao. Their intention is entirely to cover Zhang HaiPeng's attempt to disrupt Jiangsu Province. Although they have changed into Chinese clothing as a deceptive tactic, their blatant bombing with airplanes shows that they have no scruples whatsoever. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Beiping, Zhang, a cavalry company commander guarding Heihe City, was killed by Japanese troops. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Beiping, a telegram from Bu Kui states that yesterday, Japan sent two thousand infantry soldiers and a squadron of airplanes to cover Zhang Haipeng's forces in an attempt to attack the provincial capital. Ma Zhanshan dismantled ten kilometers of nearby railroad tracks to prevent Zhang's forces from advancing.

<h3>Briand Urges Japan to Withdraw Troops</h3>
<p>In a Firm Tone</p>
<p>Letter to Japanese Representative Yoshizawa</p>
<p>Nanjing Geneva 4th Dispatch: Briand has sent a letter to the Japanese representative Yoshizawa, and to the member states of the League of Nations, stating that China has resumed its guarantee to Japan, and at the same time, the resolution of the League of Nations has included the five principles proposed by Japan. Therefore, Japan should also immediately resume its guarantee in the September 30th resolution of the League of Nations, and quickly and immediately withdraw its troops. Briand said that the first four of Japan's five principles are included in the first four of the League of Nations resolution. At the same time, the resolution has been accepted by China. In fact, in addition to Japan's treaty rights in the three eastern provinces, the League of Nations has taken everything into consideration, and the issue of treaty rights is also included in the statement of the Chinese government, which is willing to resolve the issue in accordance with Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, it can be said that the Chinese government has declared to the League of Nations, giving the guarantee to the principles proposed by Japan. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris, today, French Foreign Minister Briand, in the name of the chairman of the League of Nations Council, sent a letter to Japanese representative Yoshizawa, suggesting that China and Japan each send representatives to negotiate withdrawal methods. Although the wording is gentle, the tone is firm. Observers here believe that although Japan is not bound by the recent resolution of the Council, it should follow the September 30th resolution and fulfill its promise to withdraw troops as quickly as possible. Briand clearly wants to force Japan with the moral pressure of the whole world and the League of Nations, so that supervisors and arbitrators can be immediately dispatched to the Manchurian case. Now that China has agreed to send representatives to consider the withdrawal issue, Briand does not need to treat the Chinese representative with the same firm attitude, so he sent a separate letter to Yoshizawa today. The main point of the letter is to ask Japan to recall the resolution of the Council on September 30th, and that the proposal made by Japan on October 24th is also partly the same as the Council's resolution requesting the Japanese army to withdraw completely before November 16th. Although the resolution is not binding, the moral power is beyond everything. Please Japan recall the parts that are the same as the Japanese proposal and the fact that Japan agreed to withdraw troops as quickly as possible. Ambassador Yoshizawa once promised to give the Council resolution consideration. Now China has complied with the clause in the resolution that China and Japan should send representatives to negotiate the details of withdrawal and reception. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva, today, League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond forwarded to the Council the note from Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara in response to China's request for Japan to send personnel to negotiate the details of the troop withdrawal. At the same time, Briand also sent a letter to the League of Nations Council members, claiming that regarding the five points proposed by Japan, China has guaranteed to the Council, so Japan should be asked to fulfill its guarantee given on September 30th, and the resolution of the Council on that day, that its troops will be withdrawn from Chinese territory into the South Manchuria Railway Zone as quickly as possible as permitted by the safety of expatriates. The letter solemnly stated that the first four points proposed by Japan are contained in the first four sections of the Council's resolution, and that China has already accepted the resolution, so Japan and China are in complete agreement on these four sections. The rest is only the issue of Japan's treaty rights in Manchuria, but China has agreed to seek a solution to this point in accordance with Article 8 of the League of Nations Charter, which is also appropriately included. From this point of view, China has given the Council the guarantee that includes Japan's five basic points. The letter will now also be forwarded to all member states of the League of Nations. (5th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing Paris 5th Dispatch: Briand, in serious terms, notified Yoshizawa, requesting the prompt dispatch of representatives to cooperate with Chinese representatives in handling the troop withdrawal in the Eastern Provinces. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Reports to the League of Nations on the Illegal Seizure of Salt Taxes by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Based on the Report of the Deputy Auditor of the Salt Office</p>
<p>Geneva, today, Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji submitted an official document to the League of Nations Council, reporting on the Japanese military authorities in Manchuria occupying tax collection agencies. According to Shi's report, the Japanese army in the province seized all the salt tax and used it to support the puppet government now established by the Japanese army in the Eastern Provinces. See the ironclad evidence of the brutality of Japan insulting the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(1) Translated meaning</p>
<p>In this realm, the dog's power is exceptionally fierce</p>
<p>(2) Translated meaning When the crisis of war in Manchuria is imminent, the dog immediately tucks its tail and crawls into the sell</p>
<p>The salt tax has been used by the Chinese government to mortgage foreign debts, so this move by the Japanese has a great impact on foreign interests. Shi's report is based on the official report of Dr. Cleveland, the co-director of the Chinese Salt Affairs Audit General Office. Dr. Cleveland's report pointed out that the Japanese army sealed up all the salt tax in the three eastern provinces after September 18th. (1) The accumulated salt tax in Niuzhuang totaled 1.08 million, and 2.6 million in Changchun. The Japanese army did not allow them to be remitted to the Nanjing Central Government, and forcibly confiscated over 672,000 yuan in salt taxes in Niuzhuang. (2) Dr. Cleveland's report criticized that the Japanese military authorities are now making every effort to divert various Chinese tax revenues for other purposes. (4th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>Nanjing Geneva 5th Dispatch: International financial problems may be affected by the Eastern Provinces incident. Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji has notified the League of Nations Executive Yuan that the Japanese army is arbitrarily detaining salt taxes in the Eastern Provinces and handing them over to the puppet government under the wing of the Japanese army. Because the salt tax is a guarantee for China's foreign debt, the Japanese army's actions have created a serious new situation. At the same time, Shi also sent the report of Cleveland, the Deputy Chief Auditor of the Salt Tax Bureau, to the League of Nations. The main points are: (1) Since September 18th, the Japanese army has uniformly detained the salt tax in this province (2) 1.08 million of the salt tax in Niuzhuang and 2.6 million in Changchun, the Japanese army has refused to hand over to the Central Government, and at the same time has confiscated all 672,709 yuan of the salt tax accumulated in Niuzhuang. The Japanese army is now also planning to divert the 2 million per month guaranteed for foreign debt in the Eastern Provinces for other purposes. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the United States Issues Statement to the US Government</h3>
<p>Bridge Repair is Not for the Purpose of Transporting Troops</p>
<p>Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Debuchi stated to the State Department that Japan has no intention of advancing troops on all roads in Manchuria. The recent actions of Japanese soldiers in Manchuria are aimed at repairing the iron bridge that has been bombed in order to transport soybeans, because the South Manchuria Railway's annual income is mainly soybeans. Since Japan has no plan to advance troops on all roads, there is no intention to open this road to transport troops. Moreover, the river where the bridge was destroyed will soon be frozen. If Japan really wants to advance troops, it might as well wait a little longer and cross the river on ice. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington, today, the US State Department received a report from US Consul General Hanson in Harbin that the actions of the Japanese army in northern Manchuria seem to be only to repair the Nen River railway bridge, so the anxiety of the general public about the conflict between Japan and Russia will be slightly relieved.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The League of Nations' Second Step</h3>
<p>Today, the Geneva news reports that there are many speculations about the second step that the League of Nations will take to deal with the Manchurian problem. The members of the League of Nations will be greatly troubled because neither China nor Japan is willing to give in. The members of the League of Nations must be very difficult. However, it is not true to say that China and Japan are unwilling to give in. Only Japan can be said to give in. China will listen to the constraints of the League of Nations and abide by the resolutions of the League of Nations, and do its best to protect the safety of Japanese expatriates' lives and property, and set up a reception committee to wait for the negotiations on the withdrawal of Japanese troops. There is no so-called further concessions. If China accepts Japan's proposal to negotiate principles first and then withdraw troops, it will not only be something that the people of the whole country cannot admit, but also violate the resolution of the League of Nations. If it is necessary to make further concessions within the scope of the League of Nations resolution, it will show its weakness and lose prestige in the League of Nations. In China, it will be blamed for destroying the League of Nations resolution and further lose its national character. How can the people of our country be so foolish. Therefore, today's League of Nations can only hope for Japan's concessions and can no longer hope for China's concessions.</p>
<p>Japan first sent troops for no reason and disturbed my northeast for no reason, causing such a dangerous situation today. Of course, if Japan wants to resolve this dangerous situation, it must first order Japan to withdraw its troops before negotiations can be mentioned. The League of Nations also recognizes that China's minimum demands are legitimate and has reached a unanimous resolution. Now Japan not only refuses to withdraw its troops on schedule, but also carries out its disturbing policies in my northeast and gradually expands its plans for permanent occupation, trying to trap the world in a chaotic field before it is over. In this situation, the League of Nations has no other way but to hope for Japan's awareness. If Japan does not realize it, the League of Nations can only do its best with reason to carry out its so-called second step. My countrymen have nothing else to say but to wait for the League of Nations to take the second step.</p>
<p>However, can the League of Nations' second step be relied on? Of course, my countrymen know that it cannot be relied on. If it cannot be relied on, then my countrymen can only prepare for our own second step. The first step that we should take is the unanimous sacrifice of our people, and the unanimous sacrifice is especially valuable because we can cooperate unanimously. The matter is urgent! Today's party and national leaders still can't bear to constantly fight over right and wrong and fight idly?</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams 2</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji's Memorandum to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Geneva, 5th Telegraphic Dispatch, Chinese Representative Shi Zhaoji recently sent a memorandum to the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, reporting on the situation in the Eastern Provinces. (1) China has sent a committee to negotiate with Japan on the detailed procedures for the Japanese troop withdrawal. However, the Japanese side said that the basic principles must be negotiated first before troop withdrawal can be discussed. (2) According to Japan's Honjo Declaration, the salt tax in the Eastern Provinces, which is estimated at 24 million per year, should be sent to Fengtian. The current government has found that the salt tax is a guarantee for foreign debts. This declaration by Honjo is an infringement of international obligations. (3) Japan's forcible seizure of the Fengtian Customs is a precursor to Japan's independent plan to separate the finances of the Eastern Provinces from the Chinese mainland. (4) The Japanese army has now seized 760,000 yuan of salt in Niuzhuang and shipped 1.2 million yuan of cash to Japan, which is packed in 600 boxes. It has also built 300 military camps in Fengtian and 40 military camps in Jiliuhe. Artillery and cavalry teams have all been budgeted for long-term stationing. (5) The Japanese army has now seized the operating rights of the Fengtian-Hailong Railway and is building platforms at Manchuria Xingfa Station to facilitate the shipment of Japanese military supplies. (6) Four Japanese military trains have arrived in Suizhong. (7) Several thousand Mongolian bandits are behind the Japanese army, preparing to attack Tongliao. (8) Japan supplies Ling Yinqing with military supplies to attack Jinzhou in order to eliminate Zhang Xueliang's forces in the Eastern Provinces. (9) The Japanese army in Jilin forces local people to submit to Japanese military officers, requesting that the Japanese army be stationed there to maintain order. (10) The Japanese army's various arrests, imprisonments, and other forced behaviors, as well as the continuous arrival of troops and military supplies, and all kinds of actions by the army, politics, and air force, all prove that Japan intends to consolidate this illegal military occupation politically and economically.

<h3>Genevan's Ten Views on the Situation Still Pessimistic</h3>
<p>Believing Neither Side Is Willing to Concede</p>
<p>Today in Geneva, news arrived of the clash between Chinese and Japanese soldiers at the Nenjiang Bridge. As a result, the pessimism that has permeated this area for days has become even more bleak and somber. When Geneva first heard reports that the Japanese military authorities had decided to send troops to Nenjiang under the pretext of repairing the bridge, and requested that nearby Chinese soldiers withdraw ten kilometers, there were concerns that a conflict might occur. There was also fear of the serious nature of the conflict, and a hope that the situation would not worsen. Unexpectedly, this hope has now been shattered. According to various sources, the Nenjiang fighting has not only not stopped, but is also continuing. Currently, everyone is asking, "What will happen next?" Everyone is eagerly awaiting news from Manchuria, but every new piece of news seems to increase the public's anxiety. Chinese representative Dr. Shi Zhaoji continues to provide the League of Nations Secretariat with news regarding the Manchurian incident. Today, Dr. Shi received a telegram from the government stating that Japanese troops had bombarded Tongliao again and planted landmines near the railway junction. It was also said that five shells hit the Tongliao station. (Fifth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Regarding the second step that the League of Nations Council intends to take in handling the Manchurian issue, there is much speculation within the League of Nations. League members are now aware that neither China nor Japan is prepared to compromise. This can be seen in the documents received by the League of Nations from both China and Japan. The Chinese document is a letter from the Chinese chief representative, Dr. Shi, to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, stating that the Japanese military in Manchuria is currently pursuing a pre-determined policy to replace the authority of the Chinese government in Manchuria with various groups and private rights established by the Japanese themselves. Dr. Shi's letter included a report from Dr. Cleveland, Deputy Chief Inspector of the Salt Revenue Inspectorate, detailing how the Japanese in Manchuria forcibly seized the salt revenue of the Chinese government, which was used as collateral for foreign debt. As for the Japanese document, it was a response from Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara to the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, expressing that Japan had no intention of changing its attitude. This document was delivered to the League of Nations by Sawada, an attaché from the Japanese Embassy in France. Sawada remained in Geneva after Yoshizawa returned to Paris. In his reply, Shidehara mentioned the appointment of a Japanese representative to decide on the details of the troop withdrawal together with the Chinese representative, saying that the Japanese government had already explained the proposed measures in the statement issued on October 26, and asked the Chinese government to review it. He also said that the Japanese government hoped that the Chinese government would accept the views expressed in the statement and promptly begin negotiations to reach an agreement on fundamental principles, so as to provide a basis for restoring normal relations between China and Japan and negotiating the withdrawal of troops. According to the Japanese statement of October 26, Japan is determined not to allow any reduction in its rights relating to the survival of the Japanese state and the structure of Japan's political and economic relations with China. It stated that, given the current situation, the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops to the South Manchurian Railway area under the empty assurances of the Chinese government would create an intolerable situation and place the Japanese people in great danger. Therefore, the Japanese government is only prepared to begin negotiations with China on certain fundamental principles for adjusting normal relations between the two countries. In the view of those in Geneva, Japan's attitude remains unchanged, and China has not conceded either, refusing to discuss Japan's so-called fundamental principles until the Japanese troops have withdrawn. The current situation is almost at a standstill. When the League of Nations Council meets in the future to discuss this difficult issue, it is feared that it will be a major undertaking. (Fifth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Refutes Japanese Note</h3>
<p>Submits Document to League of Nations Secretary-General</p>
<p>According to information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact previously sent identical telegrams to the governments of China and Japan. The Japanese government responded with a note. Now, Representative Shi has prepared a rebuttal to the Japanese note and submitted it to Secretary-General Drummond on the fourth. The text is as follows: (1) The Japanese government claims that the occupation of Chinese territory is a measure of self-defense. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that the Chinese army has not engaged in any offensive actions, and has pointed out that the Japanese army does not allow the Chinese army to pass through the railway area. If the Japanese government does not agree to an impartial investigation, world opinion will ultimately find it difficult to accept Japan's position. An impartial investigation is the only method consistent with the principles and practices of the League of Nations in determining responsibility. In short, using self-defense as an excuse to seize a country's strategically important locations cannot be regarded as an action that does not conflict with the Covenant. Looking back to 1925, the words of Briand, Chamberlain, and Ishii at a special meeting of the Council can now be quoted: "Briand has already understood that the Greek representative has stated that if Greece had not needed to take swift and just defense and protection measures, the incident would not have occurred. This idea should not be imprinted in the minds of the League of Nations member states and become a principle of law, which is extremely dangerous. Under the pretext, a reasonable dispute may arise, even if it is limited in scope, but in terms of the damage it causes, it is always unfortunate. Once such a dispute breaks out, it may reach a point where the government that initiated the dispute feels that it is legitimate self-defense and will soon be unable to make reservations." Chamberlain expressed complete agreement with Briand's points. Ishii said that he fully agreed with Chamberlain's statement endorsing Briand's declaration. If the Japanese government's true intention is that the withdrawal of troops depends solely on the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people, then the Chinese government has already solemnly stated that it is willing to provide the fullest assurances and unconditionally accept the assistance of the Council in planning and implementing local measures. (2) The Chinese government is very pleased that the Japanese government declares that it will use all peaceful means to resolve the dispute. However, the Japanese army is still occupying Chinese territory. On October 24, Briand stated that the League of Nations is the trustee of the obligations borne by its member states. The duty of the League of Nations is to observe whether these obligations are respected. Article 10 of the Covenant states that the member states within a national group agree to respect each other's territorial integrity and political independence. Article 2 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact states that the contracting states mutually agree that any disputes or conflicts between them, regardless of their nature or origin, can be resolved by peaceful means. I will not elaborate on this point, but I believe that world opinion will find it difficult to accept military occupation as a form of peaceful means. I believe that military occupation should be excluded from this category. Therefore, extending the occupation will also prolong the long-standing unpleasant feelings. The Chinese government, in accordance with the resolution of October 24, has undertaken to take a step to discuss with the Japanese commission the details of the troop withdrawal and the takeover of the evacuated area. This is the only issue in the Council. On October 23 and October 24, Briand and other members had already pointed this out. Therefore, any attempt to make the discussion of other issues a condition for the troop withdrawal is contrary to the path indicated by the Council and is tantamount to denying the Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Chinese government hereby draws attention to the declaration of the Chinese representative in the Council, namely, that once this unfortunate situation is resolved, the Japanese government will see that we are not only willing, but also hope to discuss all issues between the two countries. This is the determined policy of the Chinese government and is in line with the Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the recommendations of the Council. (3) The Chinese government is deeply surprised that the Japanese government believes that the boycott movement violates Article 2 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If the Kellogg-Briand Pact can be used to blame the Chinese people for refusing to buy Japanese goods, then it goes without saying that it can blame a government for maintaining troops in the territory of another signatory country. Anti-Japanese sentiment is a direct and inevitable result of the Japanese army's stationing in Manchuria. Once the cause of the animosity is removed, it will naturally disappear. The Chinese government is determined to protect the lives and property of the Japanese people and to vigorously promote good relations with Japan, in order to lay the foundation for lasting peace in the Far East. The Chinese government earnestly hopes to conclude a treaty with Japan as soon as possible, stipulating the means of reconciliation and arbitration for all disputes. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Pu Wei Plans to First Establish Four Provincial Governor's Offices</h3>
<p>Expanding the Organization of the Four Peoples' Maintenance Association</p>
<p>The Northeast independent political entity of Pu Wei in Harbin has been largely decided. The Northeast Four Provincial Governor's Offices will be established first, with Pu himself as the governor. There will be three departments under the governor's office: military affairs, civil affairs, and secretariat. Outside the governor's office, there will be departments such as finance, education, construction, and agriculture and mining. If things go smoothly, the next step will be to realize the Ming Guang or Zhonghe country. A rough outline is currently being drafted. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Northeast Four Provincial Governor's Offices in Harbin are scheduled to be established before the 15th. Currently, the outline has not been finalized due to slight differences of opinion between Pu Wei and Zhao Xinbo. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After Pu Wei became the chairman of the Shenyang Four Peoples' Maintenance Association under the protection of the Japanese in Beiping, he decided to expand the organization. It is planned to divide the association into five major departments: general affairs, counselors, relief, cultural affairs, and investigation. At the same time, it will also actively contact local legal entities in order to cultivate the association's influence. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>A foreign reporter in Tianjin wired Tianjin from Shenyang on the 5th, stating that Prince Gong is the chairman of the Manchurian-Mongolian independent government. It is hoped that it will be formally established before the year ends. He is currently fully building a permanent government. The Japanese, because of the obvious revival movement of Prince Gong, fear public opposition to debt matters. Therefore, they are doing their best to suppress Prince Gong, while being responsive to the pro-Japanese faction. According to the Japanese consulate, the Japanese government does not assist Prince Gong's revival movement. However, some Japanese in Shenyang are secretly helping him, which is not credible. The Japanese ordered Yuan Jinkai to change the Four Peoples' Maintenance Association into the Liaoning Provincial Government, but Yuan refused. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Preparing for Rotation</h3>
<p>Regarding the rotation of Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria, the Japanese military has specially dispatched Military Councillor Shirakawa to Manchuria for investigation and research. It has now been decided to dispatch the following replacement troops from the mainland Japanese divisions. The matter will be submitted to the Cabinet for discussion in the next day or two. After being approved by the Japanese Emperor, it will be implemented.

<h3>Northeast Tax Revenue Entirely Controlled by Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The salt surplus in the three eastern provinces, after deducting the principal and interest on foreign debt, had a monthly surplus of approximately 2.2 million yuan. Since the violent Japanese occupation, this salt money has been entirely withheld and deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. After the Salt Revenue Inspectorate General Office instructed the foreign officers of the Shenyang Inspectorate to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese army, the Japanese army colluded with the Shenyang Maintenance Association to transfer and intercept this money, using it as local police and administrative maintenance fees. In reality, all of it was still used by the Japanese army for military expenses and was not reported. This matter has attracted the attention of various countries. According to information obtained from financial circles, the total monthly income of national and local taxes in Shenyang is approximately 1 million yuan. Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied Shenyang on September 18, it has completely monitored the tax collection agencies. Most of the tax money has also been plundered, with losses of no less than three to four million yuan. Because the government was destroyed by violence, the people have moved to Jinzhou and are unwilling to provide money to the Japanese. Therefore, many are unwilling to pay taxes. Recently, the Japanese army handed over the tax collection agencies to the Maintenance Association for collection. The Maintenance Association provides the Japanese army with 900,000 yuan per month for military expenses. It also reports and provides the Commander of the Kwantung Army and the Commander of the Military Police with personal fees of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan each, under the name of office expenses. All tax bureaus completely use a bidding system and have added various new tax tickets and passports, completely imitating the Japanese style, with the words "valid forever" marked on them, as a means of fooling taxpayers.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Expresses Gratitude for Government's Good Intentions</h3>

<h3>British Ambassador to Japan Denies Alliance with China to Antagonize Japan</h3>
<p>British Ambassador to Japan, Lindley, yesterday declared to the Japanese government, on the instructions of the British government, denying the claim that Britain is currently planning to contact China to plot against Japan. Japanese officials believe that this statement by the British ambassador regarding the Manchurian issue will surely reassure the public. The news of Britain's alliance with China to antagonize Japan has been widely reported in the Japanese newspapers, causing anti-British sentiment. The Japanese newspapers are now disclosing the British ambassador's statement, but except for the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" and one other newspaper, they are not commenting. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" said that it is regrettable that the British Ambassador to China, Lampson, has not explained his plan to put pressure on Japan to restore Manchuria to its original state and allow Zhang Xueliang to return to Shenyang. It is reported that Vice Foreign Minister Uchida had a frank discussion with the British ambassador regarding the issue of Japanese anti-British sentiment when he received the British ambassador. Uchida said that while the occurrence of this sentiment is regrettable, the seemingly rash attitude of the British representative in Geneva, although due to Lord Cecil's urgent need to return to Britain, not only caused an unfortunate impression based on misunderstanding in Japan, but also made it difficult for the Japanese representative, because the Japanese representative needed some time to seek instructions from Tokyo. The British ambassador should also acknowledge this situation. (Fifth Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Second National Congress of the All-Students Anti-Japanese Federation</h3>
<p>Adopts Four Resolutions and Issues Circular Telegram</p>
<p>The National Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation held its second congress on the 5th and resolved: 1. Send a telegram of condolence to Xue Bai and Bao Silin, students of Zhenjiang Middle School, for their hunger strike for the country. 2. Issue a circular telegram to fight against Japan. The specific measures will be drafted by the original proposer. 3. Economic severance with Japan will be discussed and implemented by the Executive Committee in the future. 4. Request the National Government to implement revolutionary diplomacy and propose five measures: A. In accordance with the League of Nations' stipulated time, insist on unconditional troop withdrawal by Japan and reserve the conditions for compensation and apology. B. Absolutely deny Japan's so-called five basic principles. C. If Japan continues to be cruel and disregards this, declare a severance of diplomatic relations. D. Request the government to make the diplomatic policy toward Japan and the process of negotiations as public as possible, or request the government to automatically abolish all unequal treaties between China and Japan. After the meeting, a circular telegram was issued, stating that Japan's invasion of our country has been going on for almost two months. The arrogance is increasing day by day. All our citizens are deeply indignant. The local students, in particular, are running around and calling for action, taking the lead in resisting Japan and strictly organizing to fight for national salvation. However, the systems feel fragmented, and the strength is difficult to concentrate. This association officially convened a meeting at the National Central University in the capital on November 3 to urgently seek to organize a systematic anti-Japanese organization in order to unify command and not seek temporary preservation, preferring to be shattered as jade. We are wholeheartedly united until death. The only desire is to resist foreign violence, and we must first plan internal unity. To achieve the goal of unity, the realization of a peace conference is truly the only important plan before the Party. In this regard, this association sincerely hopes that all the gentlemen of the Party and the country will, on the one hand, abandon established opinions and jointly face the national crisis, and on the other hand, openly discuss and inform the people of the country. If one party still stubbornly adheres to its own opinions and is willing to be a public enemy who destroys peace, then this association will not hesitate to suspend all schooling. The life and death of the Party and the country are imminent. We wish all our compatriots to rise up together, resist the invasion of foreign insults together, and save the fate of the country from the brink of collapse. The electric messages are rushed out, and there is no limit to the anticipation. In addition, the three members of the presidium of the congress were pushed to go to the National Government again to petition for the promotion of peace. The representatives of the association who went to Shanghai to petition the peace conference appointed representatives from 13 units at the preparatory meeting the day before to form a delegation and went to Shanghai on the evening of the 5th.

<h3>Deliberation of the Conscription Law Draft Not Yet Completed</h3>
<p>The Military Law and Finance Committees of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan have held several joint meetings to deliberate the draft of the Conscription Law. According to a drafter, China's population has reached 470 million. If conscription is implemented at a rate of one per thousand, 470,000 people can be conscripted each year. Over three years, this would amount to 1.41 million conscripts. In practice, there would be many difficulties regarding the required firearms, uniforms, and personnel. However, military training for all citizens is essential for establishing a nation, and should be implemented. The General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of War, and the Training Directorate have all submitted reference opinions. The General Staff Headquarters favors a voluntary enlistment system, but some also advocate a combined conscription and enlistment system. The principle of this system is to train all citizens, but the name is somewhat novel. This system may also be adopted in the future to adapt to local conditions. For example, conscription can be used where suitable, and enlistment can be used where suitable. Currently, reference materials are being collected, and a draft may be completed by the end of the year. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Interprets Ambiguities in the Income Tax Law</h3>

It was unanimously agreed that the collection of income tax from the banking industry should be limited to banks organized as joint-stock limited companies, according to Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Income Tax Law for the Banking Industry and Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Business Tax Law. The term "the aforementioned bank" in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Income Tax Law for the Banking Industry refers to banks organized as joint-stock limited companies in Paragraph 1 of the same article. Banks organized as general partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and unlimited companies as referred to in Article 5 of the Banking Law, will be subject to business tax in accordance with the Business Tax Law.

<h3>Jiaoji Railway Coal Transport Crisis Presents Mediation Conditions</h3>
<p>In addition to the Ministry of Railways allocating vehicles from various lines to transport coal specifically to meet the needs of Shanghai, the Jiaoji Railway and coal merchants in Nanjing have proposed mediation conditions for the coal transport strike. The railway authorities will postpone the increase in freight rates for three months. The coal merchants will abide by the following conditions: 1. Do not sell coal to foreigners; 2. Coal prices will not rise; 3. The Jiaoji Railway will reduce coal purchase prices. According to those familiar with the situation, these conditions naturally suit the public sentiment. However, the Luda Mine is a Sino-Japanese joint venture, with a large Japanese shareholding. The Donghe Mine is also a Sino-Japanese joint venture, and most of the Qingdao ships are Japanese ships. Therefore, it is questionable whether the first condition can be implemented. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Significance of the Conservative Party's Victory in the British General Election</h3>
<p>Domestically… Protect Capitalists and Increase Production</p>
<p>Externally… Focus on Colonies and Expanding Trade</p>
<p>George Declines Leadership of the Liberal Party in Parliament</p>
<p>London News: The British general election, watched by the world, has resulted in a landslide victory for the government party, with an absolute majority of 551 seats. This is a difference of over 500 seats compared to the opposition parties. This absolute majority is not only beyond general expectations but also unprecedented in the history of the British Parliament. The Labour Party's power has been continuously growing since 1906, but this year, the situation reversed, and they have returned to the state of twenty years ago. There are approximately three reasons for their crushing defeat: (1) the British financial crisis, (2) the small constituency system, (3) the internal divisions of the Labour Party. Among these three, the most important is the financial crisis. The recent sharp drop in the pound is extremely severe. The fall in the pound price is evidence of Britain's loss of world financial hegemony, and can also be said to be the shaking of the British Empire's world hegemony. Its financial magnates cannot but actively support the Conservative Party and implement a strong protectionist tariff policy to stabilize the pound price. At present, the whole world is preoccupied with tariff competition, and Britain's adoption of a protectionist tariff policy will undoubtedly make the world tariff competition even more fierce. Britain will begin fierce competition with the great powers in trade. At the same time, France and the United States are striving for financial hegemony. This is the new government's greatest mission, and all its domestic and foreign policies must be based on this mission. Domestically, it will protect capitalists and actively increase production, and must impose considerable pressure on the proletariat. Externally, it will focus on the peace and stability of its colonies and all commercial markets, and strive to expand sales. It will use world peace as a diplomatic slogan, and will take strong repressive policies against disturbances in the colonies and the Soviet Union, which calls for world revolution. It can be asserted that, according to the general political circles in Britain, the new cabinet, having secured an absolute majority, can maintain its power for up to five years if it can maintain coordination within itself. However, regarding the issue of protectionist tariffs, it is extremely difficult to have a unified attitude between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party members of the cabinet. The stagnation of the world economy remains difficult to view optimistically. The policy of protectionist tariffs will inevitably cause a fatal panic in the world economy, which is also expected. Therefore, the rise of the Conservative Party is a temporary phenomenon of transition, and the Labour Party is only temporarily lying low. (World Press)</p>

George had previously sent a letter to Samuel declining to attend the meeting, implicitly indicating his unwillingness to be elected. After being elected, Samuel gave a speech to the party members, strongly emphasizing the necessity of national unity and saying that various political parties should cooperate to improve working conditions without harming their respective parties. He ended by expressing regret that he did not have the assistance and cooperation of George.</p>
<h3>Division of Seats in the US House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Democrats Win in By-Election</p>
<p>National Press, Washington, 4th: In the by-election for members of Congress in the United States yesterday, the Democratic Party won, gaining three seats in total. The Republican Party only gained two seats. However, there is still one vacancy to be filled in a by-election on the first of next month. If the Republican Party can win it, then the two factions may still be evenly matched.</p>
<h3>Franco-German Negotiations on Debt Issues</h3>
<p>Differences Between the Two Sides Still Significant</p>
<p>National Press, Berlin, 4th: Today, the government convened a special cabinet meeting to discuss the progress of talks between the German ambassador to France and French Prime Minister Laval and French Finance Minister Flandin. After the cabinet meeting, the content was not made public, and it is expected that the issue will need to be further discussed. Regarding the debt issue currently under discussion between Germany and France, the opinions of both sides have not yet been reconciled. Germany is extremely willing to end the 700 million mark short-term loan issue once and for all, while France insists on resolving the reparations issue first, as France still hopes that Germany will continue to pay reparations. If this point is resolved, then the restructuring of the short-term debt will naturally be easy. German public opinion generally states that France's attitude is of little benefit and is merely wasting time, as Germany has no remaining capacity to pay not only war debts but also commercial debts.</p>
<h3>British Industries Federation Releases Report on Financial Research</h3>
<p>Advocates Convening an International Silver Conference</p>
<p>to Seek the Stabilization of World Silver Prices</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: The joint committee appointed by the British Industries Federation and the Economic Society to study the British monetary system and general financial policies has now completed its report, which contains important proposals regarding the silver issue. This report, released today, advocates restoring the role of silver in the world monetary system and urges the government to convene or participate in an immediately held international silver conference. The committee does not want to advocate the restoration of silver coinage or a permanent bimetallic standard, but advocates finding ways to increase the purchasing power of consumers in the Far East, such as China and India. The recommended method is that the central banks of various countries should allow some percentage of their reserves to be converted into silver. Regarding the issue of the British Empire's monetary system, the report recommends convening an Imperial Monetary Conference to enable the British Empire to escape the current chaos in the world monetary system. The report does not consider Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 to be a good idea, and urges Britain to ensure that the rules of a beneficial monetary standard are faithfully followed by other countries before it can restore an international monetary standard. The report concludes that efforts should be made to encourage more capital to be invested in Imperial enterprises and less in foreign enterprises, and that an Imperial Central Bank should be established as a clearing house for the banknotes of the various central banks of the British territories.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Doihara Secretly Arrives in Tianjin, Threatening Puyi to Go to Shenyang</h3>
<p>Conducting the So-Called Restoration Movement</p>
<p>But It Is Expected That Puyi May Not Be Fooled</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Yesterday, a telephone call was received from Tianjin, saying that Doihara Kenji, the chief instigator of the Liaoning-Jilin Incident and the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in China, secretly arrived in Tianjin on the 2nd and stayed at the Tokiwa Hotel in the Japanese Concession. The reporter learned that Doihara was the mastermind behind the Northeast Incident and had lived in China for a long time. He usually provoked everywhere, and whenever there was internal strife, he was always involved in pulling the strings. The Shi Yousan Mutiny, he was one of the main figures in it. This time, he secretly came to Tianjin after giving the post of mayor of Shenyang to Zhao Xinbo, which must have been a very important mission. Therefore, the reporter exerted all his energy for a day, investigating everywhere, and finally learned that Doihara's arrival was actually for a major task, and that Jin Liang was also accompanying him. After the Japanese army occupied Liaoning and Jilin, in order to conceal the international community's attention, they did not dare to openly admit their aggression, so they were determined to cultivate the emergence of the so-called new regime. Their sole purpose was to separate the three northeastern provinces from China, declare independence, place them under their protection, and then gradually merge them, to achieve their so-called "Korea-Manchuria Integration" goal. Therefore, in Jilin, they used Xi Qia to organize the so-called Jilin Chief Executive Office, and in Heilongjiang, they incited Zhang Haipeng to attack Qiqihar. In Liaoning, they provided aid to Ling Yinqing to disrupt the Beining Railway, so that Jinzhou could not establish a provincial government. Unexpectedly, Zhang Haipeng was defeated after one attack, and even though the Japanese army urged him to try again, Zhang's henchman Xu Wenlong was killed by an explosion when inspecting mortar shells, which caused Zhang to lose his arm and his ambitions gradually faded. He has already shown signs of handing over his troops to his branch team leader and going to convert to the Panchen Lama. Ling Yinqing led bandits to disrupt the Panjin Tianzhuangtai area on the 28th and 29th of last month, but after being severely attacked by our 19th Brigade stationed there, he suffered more than half casualties and fled without a trace, and has already been unable to cause trouble. The Japanese army received this heavy blow and was filled with grief and indignation. Moreover, the date of the League of Nations' resolution to withdraw troops is approaching. Although Japan claims that it is not a resolution and has no obligation to comply, it also fears that the international situation will change and become more isolated in terms of moral responsibility. Therefore, the movement to divide the three northeastern provinces is deemed more necessary and must be done quickly. However, the difficulty is that there is a lack of a leader for the new regime among the people of the three provinces. After repeated consideration, they believe that it would not be permitted by time to cultivate one from scratch. The most appropriate and readily available person is to use Puyi. Therefore, after considering the results, Doihara came to Tianjin with Jin Liang. It is heard that after Doihara and Jin arrived in Tianjin, they went together to visit Puyi once and talked secretly for two hours before leaving. Although the specific content of the conversation is unknown, it can be inferred. It is still unknown what Puyi said in response, but it is known that on the afternoon of the 3rd, Puyi's key aides met with Doihara and Jin Liang at a certain place to avoid attention. The content is also unknown. However, combining the above circumstances, it seems very certain that Japan wants to establish the so-called "Mingguang Empire" in the three northeastern provinces. Jin Liang is a Manchu bannerman stationed in Zhenjiang, who pretends to be elegant and attaches himself to the literati, and often styles himself as a "remnant elder." He is particularly forceful in advocating restoration. Puyi, Jin Bi'dong, and Xi Qia are all members of the Qing imperial family. This time, Puyi has taken on the position of President of the Pseudo-Four People's Maintenance Society in Shenyang, worshipping the Beiling, convening Mongolian princes, and inviting the Qing Dynasty remnants for a meeting. His ambition is nothing more than to restore the dynasty. Now that Doihara and Jin Liang have come to Tianjin, and Puyi is living in the Japanese Concession, what could the Japanese not do by inciting and coercing him? Although there are not a few people around Puyi who understand the general situation, it is difficult to predict whether they will willingly be puppets of a foreign race. Moreover, according to what the reporter has heard, there is one more detail worth noting, that is, Jin Wenxiu, Puyi's concubine, who has been with him for almost ten years, suddenly requested to leave this year. There is a great reason for this. Before the Shenyang Incident, the Japanese had already made plans. In August, the Japanese consul stationed in Tianjin secretly contacted Puyi. Wenxiu learned about this and conspired with her sister to use this to threaten to break off the relationship and demand 500,000 yuan in alimony. Puyi did not make any concrete representations to the Japanese consul, but he did not want this matter to be spread in society, so he had to admit his bad luck and ask a lawyer to mediate. In the end, he paid 50,000 yuan in alimony to break up with Xiu. This major case was not revealed. Now, with the power of Doihara and Jin Liang, they are greater than the Japanese consul. Whether Puyi can overcome his desires and firmly refuse, the reporter is paying attention to the actions of his key aides. There may be a more detailed report in the coming days. (November 3rd)</p>
<h3>Ling Yinqing's Bandit Troops Have Been Defeated</h3>
<p>Jinzhou Correspondence: At two or three in the afternoon on the 28th, two or three hundred of Ling Yinqing's accomplices attempted to cause trouble in the southeast of Tianzhuangtai, claiming that they would enter the village. Lian Zhang Yin Decai, the company commander of the Northeast Army stationed in Tianzhuangtai, met them head-on and dealt them a heavy blow. Many bandits were killed, and Ling's bandits retreated in defeat. On the 29th, the bandits returned with a crowd and attacked. Zhao, the battalion commander of the infantry division of the 19th Brigade of the Northeast Army, severely attacked the bandits, killing forty or fifty bandits and capturing more than ten alive. The bandits have scattered and fled. It seems that they have been suppressed and cleared. Foreign reports claim that the bandit leader Ling Yinqing had invaded and occupied Panshan. This was originally to boost the thieves' strength. After our army's two days of heavy attack, it seems that they will not dare to act rashly. Ling is originally from Liaodong and has no profession. He was incited by the Japanese to gather troops. However, this bandit has no significant prestige among the bandits, so all the bandit gangs do not rashly attach themselves to him. Those who deal with him cautiously are trying to swindle guns. Therefore, in the past month, he has only recruited a few hundred people. (October 31st)</p>
<h3>The Enthusiastic Patriotic Movement in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Merchants Voluntarily Block Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Domestic Products Unable to Meet Demand</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the Japanese army's invasion and occupation of Liaoning and Jilin, the people of Tianjin have been extremely indignant. However, due to the suppression by the military and police, no incidents have occurred. Recently, the business community has organized a "Committee of Merchants for Voluntary Economic Severance of Relations with Japan" and will no longer purchase Japanese goods, which has already been implemented. However, the Japanese goods that have already been purchased continue to arrive, which has caused great dissatisfaction among all sectors of society. Therefore, an "All Sectors Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association" was formed. Because the "Committee of Merchants for Voluntary Economic Severance of Relations with Japan" was not working effectively, it requested the Municipal Party Headquarters to abolish it and merge it into the National Salvation Association. The handover was completed on the 29th of last month. However, the merchants are</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>afraid that the National Salvation Joint Association would handle affairs too rashly and hinder business. Therefore, after consulting with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, they obtained the consent of the Municipal Party Headquarters to allow merchants to seal up all boxed Japanese goods stored since the 31st, and place miscellaneous goods in a separate area in the store, allowing people to buy them freely, so as to maintain the merchants' difficulties. The National Salvation Joint Association formed a inspection team of ten squads yesterday, with a total of more than 500 people, divided into 100 groups. They set off in groups yesterday morning, one group on patrol, one group setting up checkpoints, and one group inspecting. If they encounter Japanese goods smuggled from the concessions to the interior, they will immediately detain them and publicly burn them on a scheduled basis in the future. On the 27th, Tajiri, the acting Japanese Consul-General stationed in Tianjin, protested to the municipal government to stop the boycott movement. The municipal government notified its subordinate agencies to investigate as usual. On the 29th, Deputy Consul Goto went to the municipal government to protest verbally. Because the result was not fulfilled, he ranted and raved. On the 31st, Shinsaka, the head of the Japanese police署in Tianjin, also went to the municipal government to protest. Mayor Zhang Xueming felt quite difficult. He was not willing to suppress the patriotic movement of the citizens, nor could he fail to perfunctorily deal with the Japanese consulate's protest. Therefore, on the evening of the 30th, the education authorities notified all principals to prevent students from leaving the school to avoid accidents (the inspection team was composed of students and workers). Unexpectedly, all the students did not go to school and went directly to the National Salvation Joint Association to wait for work. As a result of the inspection on that day, everything was safe and sound. Today (the 1st), the inspection team organized by workers set off. Although the Japanese wanted to create trouble, they had no chance. Ten days ago, the National Salvation Joint Association had planned to block Dagu Port on the 28th to prohibit Japanese goods from landing. The Japanese barracks stationed in Tianjin sent armed soldiers and three machine guns to Tanggu on the 26th to prepare for provocation. In order to avoid conflict, the National Salvation Joint Association cancelled the plan to block the port. The Japanese soldiers returned to Tianjin on the 28th in disappointment. The Japanese stores in the Japanese concession have been deserted for a month. Although they used the method of "buy a certain amount and get a certain amount free" to attract buyers, it was only effective at first. After the newspapers criticized it, the Chinese no longer bought it. According to customs statistics, the import of Japanese flour in October decreased by one-third compared with September. According to the investigation of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the value of Japanese sugar imported from Dagu every month was more than 10 million yuan. Since October, merchants have switched to using Dutch sugar and Taikoo sugar, and no Japanese sugar has been imported. According to the report of the Five Kinds Consolidated Tax Administration Office, the Yuda yarn factory, which is opened by Japanese capital in this city, produces more than 70 packages of yarn every day. There were no buyers in October. Although it is still working as usual, it may be difficult to maintain it for a long time. The Chinese yarn factories Hengyuan (80 packages per day), Yuyuan (60 packages per day), Baocheng (60 packages per day), Beiyang and Huayu (50 packages per day each) are all working overtime because supply cannot meet demand. The two Japanese-owned match companies, Zhonghua and Sanyou (a total of more than 120 boxes per day), have had no buyers since the 24th of last month. Because there is too much inventory, they may have to stop operations soon. The three Chinese match companies, Beiyang, Danhua, and Rongchang, produce a total of 120 boxes per day, and are now also increasing overtime work because supply cannot meet demand (November 1).</p>

<h3>Shandong Coal Merchants Still on Strike</h3>
<p>Hainan Correspondence: Coal merchants along the Jiaoji Railway are on strike since November 1 due to the Jiaoji Railway's 20% increase in freight rates. The coal merchants in Zichuan, Boshan, Zhangqiu, and Weixian are all on strike. After mediation by the Ministry of Railways, three conditions were proposed: ((1) Coal mines along the Jiaoji Railway shall not be sold to foreigners; (2) Coal merchants shall not take the opportunity to raise prices; (3) Coal merchants shall reduce the price of coal supplied to the Jiaoji Railway) in exchange for the railway's consideration of cancelling the increase in fees. The Jiaoji Railway and the coal merchants are now meeting in Qingdao to study solutions. In the first meeting yesterday, there was no concrete solution regarding the quantity and value of the Jiaoji Railway's purchase of coal at reduced prices (coal merchants asked for seven yuan per ton, while the Jiaoji Railway only agreed to give six yuan). Therefore, today (the 3rd), all coal merchants along the line are still on strike. Qingdao, Jinan, and the Jiaoji Railway all rely on coal supplies from Zibo, Boshan, Zhangqiu, and Weixian. Moreover, the demand for coal is especially high in winter. Now that the strike has suddenly cut off the source, coal prices have increased, and society has become uneasy. Today, the provincial government's political affairs meeting secretly proposed a temporary discussion and resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to Shandong to jointly investigate and handle the matter. In addition, the Jiaoji Railway supplies 5,000 tons of coal free of charge to various agencies for coal use. Because there is an organization of the Price Stabilization Committee of various agencies, there was already a precedent last year. Today, the Provincial Government Standing Committee proposed that the scope be expanded and the Price Stabilization Committee of various agencies be changed to the Shandong Provincial Government Price Stabilization Committee. The organizational regulations are under review. The proposal of the Secretariat is recorded below: One, the Secretariat's temporary report. The Ministry of Railways replied that the Jiaoji Railway's increase in freight rates this time is very small, and coal merchants should not have any objections. According to the Zibo, Boshan, Zhangqiu Coal Industry Federation, the order should be swiftly sent to the railway bureau to withdraw the order to increase prices. How should it be handled? Please decide by resolution. "Telegram to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways. Personnel will be sent to Jinan to jointly investigate the situation with personnel sent by the provincial government and discuss a proper handling plan."</p>
<h3>Japanese Secretly Made Bombs in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Yoshida and Abe Died Due to Carelessness</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Qingdao: On the 2nd, at noon, two Japanese residents, Yoshida and Abe, at No. 1 Taishan Road, Qingdao, were injured by an explosion of dangerous goods. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate after hearing the news. According to Xie Ruiyu, Yoshida's cook, the house was indeed Yoshida's residence. This morning, Abe brought two paper packages from outside and instructed Xie to buy a basket of charcoal powder. At that time, Xie saw that the two paper packages looked like white flour and sulfur. Xie went upstairs to the kitchen to prepare lunch. A few minutes later, he heard a loud noise downstairs. He rushed to see that Yoshida and Abe were already lying on the ground, their flesh and blood blurred. The Japanese consulate had also heard the report and sent personnel to the scene to investigate together. It was found that there were two broken glass bottle bottoms containing sulfur potassium carbonate in the house, a large package of sulfur weighing more than four pounds, and three old dry batteries, two of which were broken. The injured person's left hand was half gone. The Japanese consulate officials insisted on taking the above items away. The Public Security Bureau insisted that the items were evidence and refused to allow it. As a result, the Japanese consulate officials only took one undamaged battery away. The injured people were sent to Qingdao Hospital by the consulate's car. Yoshida died in the hospital. Abe also died on the morning of the 3rd. It was found that the various items and Xie's confession indicated that the Japanese residents intended to make bombs. Xie saw something similar to white flour, which was probably gunpowder. The battery bottom was hollowed out to make the bomb shell. The destroyed battery iron shell can prove it. According to reports, Yoshida and others were members of the Japanese Kokusuikai and were well-known violent elements. Recently, Japanese residents in Qingdao held a meeting in the city and made a secret decision to try to provoke riots. Yoshida probably died due to carelessness in secretly making bombs. The Japanese consulate also tacitly acknowledged this.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Started Collecting Special Product Sales Tax</h3>
<p>Implemented Starting from the 3rd of the Month</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province's finances have long been riddled with holes. However, in the past few months, the central government's monthly subsidy of 200,000 yuan was still able to barely make ends meet. Recently, since the Shenyang Incident occurred, the central government's subsidy has not arrived for two months. Not only are the military and political expenses suspended, but also the food expenses of various agencies are difficult to maintain. He Jian has repeatedly discussed with the party and government committees to find a way to alleviate the emergency. It was decided to start collecting special product sales tax immediately, designating various products such as coal, rice, oil, paper, bamboo, wood, hardware, leather goods, southern goods, medicinal materials, cloth, and silk, and levy 2 to 5 percent of the value, regardless of whether they are imported from other provinces or exported from this province, and sold within this province. It is estimated that the monthly income can be more than 200,000 or even 300,000 yuan. However, fearing that merchants would object, a banquet was held in the Provincial Savings Hall at 4:00 pm on the 2nd of this month, inviting the Provincial Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees to explain the difficulties and hope for understanding from all parties. After the banquet, a notice was issued, stipulating that the implementation would start on the 3rd of this month, and the detailed rules for collection were announced as follows: (Article 1) From the date of implementation of these regulations, all previous regulations and tax rules in this province regarding the collection of special product output tax shall be abolished. (Article 2) For goods that have been started and completed output tax before the implementation of these regulations and want to be transported to other ports, the provisions of Article 9 of these regulations shall be followed. (Article 3) For goods that have completed output tax before the implementation of these regulations and have not reached the designated sales location, the output tax ticket shall have the same effect as the product sales tax ticket after implementation. However, if the goods are more than the ticket, they should still be taxed according to the regulations. (Article 4) After the supplementary tax in the preceding article, a product sales supplementary tax ticket should be filled in according to the amount of supplementary tax, and the old tax ticket should be pasted on the overlap and stamped with a seal and given to the merchant for collection. (Article 5) These detailed rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation (November 3).</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The notorious bandit Caiyi Ajin committed suicide. It is said that Xu Ximing, the leader of the Lake Bandits Taibao Ashu, nicknamed Caiyi Ajin, and Gan A Zuo were captured by Fan Guozhong, the captain of the waterway police detachment, and Zhou Liancheng, the captain of the second detachment, who disguised themselves and seized them while drinking in a small restaurant in Xuejia浜, Shanghai. A pistol was confiscated and taken back to the Jinshan detachment headquarters. It was temporarily sent to the Jinshan County Prison. Before the document was prepared to be sent for interrogation, the bandit suddenly tore the cloth strip in prison last night in fear of guilt, and connected it into a belt to commit suicide by hanging. It was not discovered until this morning that it was too late to rescue him. The news was spread by people from Zhujing. It seems that it is not without reason. It is said that the headquarters also received a phone report from someone. According to reports, the bandit was a wanted bandit by the headquarters for a reward of 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A kidnapping incident in Hetou Village was resolved safely. Chen, the daughter-in-law of Ye Xingquan in Hetou Village, Dongshan, and her three-year-old grandson were kidnapped by bandits on September 15 this year. At the same time, Guo, the eldest daughter-in-law of Xu Yunfeng, a neighbor, was shot and killed by bandits. Xu's brother, Dingfeng, was also kidnapped. Now, all three hostages returned safely yesterday (the 5th).</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Bandits kidnapped people for ransom. On the night before last, six bandits armed with pistols, wooden sticks, and firecrackers suddenly came to Xu Zhizhou's house in Majia 穻 Village, District 3, and climbed over the wall to enter. They injured Xu's head and ransacked the boxes and cabinets at will. Before leaving, they also took Xu's six-year-old grandson away.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Construction funds were taken away by the government. The county magistrate approved it with emotion. The Construction Bureau of this county has accumulated more than 140,000 yuan in construction funds. Recently, the Department of Finance and Construction sent personnel to Changshu to withdraw half of the amount as a public debt for water management. At that time, County Magistrate Tan Yiwa happened to be on leave to the province, and the county administration was handled by Secretary Jin. Therefore, Chen Qixu, the director of the Construction Bureau, asked Secretary Jin, the acting county magistrate, for instructions and transferred the funds. Jin did not examine it in detail and rashly stamped his personal seal and ordered the bank to release the funds. However, County Magistrate Tan thought that the accumulated construction funds belonged to the local finances and planned to allocate half of it for repairing the embankments in the future. Now, it was taken away. Secretary Jin and others privately stamped the seal to withdraw the funds, which was an act of overreach. Chen Qixu was also quite dissatisfied with his willingness to flatter his superiors. Therefore, he announced to the outside world. Although the general public believes that the disaster situation this year is urgent, Jin and Chen arbitrarily used public funds, which is quite resentful. However, County Magistrate Tan Yigui often took leave, which led to this kind of shocking incident. Although he did not agree, he could not shirk the suspicion of absenteeism and oversight. Therefore, he also expressed quite dissatisfaction with him.</p>
<p>The truth about the sudden death of the female principal will be revealed soon. In the case of the unclear death of Hu Tinglian, the principal of Yanxiang Primary School in this county, the four pieces of male clothing that have been examined have been stored in the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, Hu Tianpu, the younger brother of the deceased, arrested a man with serious suspicion in the countryside named Wu Xiaosheng and immediately sent him to the Public Security Bureau for questioning by the judicial section. According to his confession, he is thirty years old this year and lives in Jiaochang湾, Xiaodongmen, where he opened a hotel. He is indeed familiar with Hu Tinglian. He met her in the home of a Su family in Zhong胜巷 two years ago and became friends through the introduction of Su (female). He often visited her. On the 30th of last month, when he learned that Hu was ill, he went to the countryside to visit her and asked Chinese medicine doctor Wang Xiangjiu to go to the countryside for diagnosis and prescription. When asked what disease caused her death, he vaguely replied that Zhou Shimu (wife of doctor Zhou Mansun) of Huakang Hospital knew. He then ordered the man clothing that had been examined to be worn, but the waist and collar were all larger than those of the wearer, which were not suitable for him. It is feared that the clothing belongs to someone else. The Public Security Bureau will send it to the county for judicial interrogation. However, according to what the deceased's younger brother Hu Tianpu told others yesterday, according to the man Wu Xiaosheng's confession, Zhou Shimu of Huakang Hospital has a major relationship. After the incident happened the day before yesterday, I went to Huakang Hospital and asked obstetrician Jiang Yingren to go to the countryside for diagnosis. Unexpectedly, Zhou Shimu volunteered to go. After arriving in the countryside, there was no result. However, after returning to the city, he declared to the newspaper that he did not start because of dizziness after arriving in the countryside. There is obviously a clue in this. Also, the deceased had taken ten white pills from Huakang Hospital before his death. As for what disease he was treating, it is unknown. Therefore, according to the general assumption, he died of abortion.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>In the case of defrauding money, the district chief and others were dismissed and investigated. Ni Jianye, the chief of the Second District, was previously accused by Miao Jinshan, a villager in Tao Dian Township, to the county of dereliction of duty and defrauding money. The case involved Wang Weixin, the director of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Later, Qian Zhongliang, the chief of the First District, ordered Zhang Xin, the assistant of the district office, to investigate the bureau. Zhang suddenly had a conflict with Wang Weixin and they scuffled with each other to the Public Security Bureau. Both parties were released on bail and reported to the county government by Hua局. Chen County Magistrate learned that the case tarnished the official and should be investigated. Yesterday, he specially ordered Ni Jianye, Wang Weixin, and Zhang Xin to be dismissed and handed over to the County Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to law. The position of the chief of the Second District was taken by Zhang Guangdi (formerly the chief of the Third District), who is currently the staff member of the First Section of the County Government. The vacancy of the director of the Third Branch has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>The loss of items in the sealed hotel is bizarre. The entire property of Fan Jiangsheng, the former owner of the Zhonghua Hotel on Tongyun Road outside Guangfu Gate, was sealed for mortgage after being accused by Fan Yu Shi, Shi Yanchang, Tao Renqian, etc. to the County Court to recover funds. Yesterday (the 5th), personnel were sent by the County Court to open the seal and check the items. It was found that a large number of items had been stolen. Because Fan Jiangsheng was suspected, he was immediately taken to the court and sent to the prosecutor for interrogation.</p>

Bao Enlian and Xue Baiyi, senior students of Zhenjiang Middle School of Jiangsu Province, are extremely worried because the country is in dire straits and peace talks are difficult to achieve. They started fasting on the evening of the 1st to promote peace and save the country together. They issued a statement seeking comrades. Although the teachers and students of the school repeatedly advised them, they did not change their minds. Yesterday morning, the school's student union held an emergency meeting to discuss the case. It was decided to send a telegram to the National Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Beijing for support and to inform and encourage them at the same time. The school authorities, because the two students could not be persuaded, specially informed their parents yesterday and asked them to come to the school to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Stop the official property bureau from selling land at Daikoumen. Six agencies including the Zhenjiang County Party Department, the County Government, the Education Bureau, the Construction Bureau, the First District Office, and the Chamber of Commerce believe that filling the old canal of Daikoumen to build a road was originally intended to prosper the streets and facilitate transportation. Therefore, the residents there endured sacrifices. However, the construction of the road has been stopped and stopped. It has not been completed yet. Recently, the Jiangzhenju Six Official Property Branch approved the people to lease the land at a low price. Not only is it related to the provincial government's resolution, but also it has not gone through proper procedures. It is difficult to recognize it. Therefore, it is specially submitted to the provincial government for the Department of Finance to stop the official property branch from selling the land to emphasize the decree and maintain construction.</p>

The villagers of Qionghe闸 Township also jointly presented a complaint to the district office accusing Ma Junkang of fabricating the charges. The mother of Sibao once said that she had seen Ma, who was from Sanguan Township, had previously served as a soldier in a certain team. Because his wife had an affair with Huang, she immediately divorced him and bore a grudge. The command also suspected Ma of fabricating the charges and detained him for investigation.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Economic pressure led to a suicide by drowning. Zhang Dun'an, a native of Anhui, was engaged in the pawn shop business in Nanjing. Recently, due to long-term unemployment, he suffered heavy losses. He went to Shanghai to visit a friend but did not meet him. He could not solve the economic problem and was ashamed to return home. He took a car to Hangzhou the day before yesterday and wandered around the West Lake alone. At about 11:00 p.m. last night, he drowned himself by the Yue Tomb Lake. Fortunately, the police on duty heard the alarm and rushed to rescue him and transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for relief.</p>
<p>A large number of Hubei refugees arrived in Hangzhou. This year, there were major floods in various provinces, especially in Hankou, Hubei. There are already five to six hundred refugees from Mianyang who have come to Hangzhou for food. A night train to Hangzhou on the 4th was loaded with more than 300 refugees from the county, supporting the old and carrying the young, in a pitiful state. They stayed in the  台内 that night. After receiving the news, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau sent a car patrol team and police from the police station in charge to order them to leave the country.

<p>A disturbance occurred at Zhejiang University. More than 600 students from the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Agriculture of Zhejiang University petitioned the president, Shao Peizi, over the issue of funding. The language was conflicting, and Shao declared his resignation and ordered the secretariat to rush to complete the matter overnight. One party telegraphed the central government to firmly resign. Li Ximou, the dean of the Faculty of Engineering, also took the blame and resigned because he failed to stop the students' actions at the scene. However, classes at the school continued as usual on the 5th. The matter of the resignation of the two deans is difficult to resolve.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>A primary school student was shot by a primary school student. Hong Jihuang, the 13-year-old son of Hong Yuanchen, a resident of Zhoujiadian, Xiguan District, Zhenhai, was studying at the Huashi Zhongxing Primary School. He recently took a leave of absence due to染  illness. His parents happened to go to Shanghai to attend a wedding. The child secretly took his father's shotgun at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday and played outside. Hong Shaoming, the 13-year-old son of Hong Yuanqin, a villager in the same village, was also studying at the Shangzhi Primary School in the area. He met Hong Jihuang on his way home from school yesterday and joined in the play. Unexpectedly, he moved the gun and the bullet came out of the gun and hit Hong Shaoming's head, and his brain was scattered and he died immediately. It is said that the father of the deceased has telegraphed Hong Yuanchen to return home to file a protest.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>The silk and cloth industry suspended business due to the inspection of Japanese goods. Because Yongruixing Cloth Shop on Beidajie, Jiaxing, was suspected of selling Japanese goods, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association inspection team went to inspect it on the evening of the 4th. The shop immediately put up the shop board, and the inspectors ordered the Japanese goods in the cabinet to be checked out. The shop denied it, and the two sides held each other until midnight. Huang Tongsheng and Yang Changsan, members of the Standing Committee of the Anti-Japanese Association, arrived at the scene and took away several sections of flannelette. One side sealed fifteen sample cabinets and scheduled another inspection for the 5th. The inspection team then left. On the morning of the 5th, the same industry Yuanchangsheng, Yichangfu, Tongfuchang, Zhengchunhe, Gaojinhua, and Fengxin and other silk and cloth shops unanimously suspended business. All the shop assistants went to the Chamber of Commerce to ask for guidance to various parties to petition. In the afternoon, they gathered again at the County Party Department and the National Salvation Association to demand that all the sealed Japanese goods be returned and declared that no more inspections should be conducted in the shops in the future. As of 7:00 p.m., there was still no solution.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>After the floods in Anhui Province, the provincial treasury was empty and government expenses were severely stretched. The business tax was a new system to compensate for the abolishment of the likin tax. However, the tax collection often fell short of the target. Liu Pengyi, the Finance Commissioner, believed that the various agricultural businesses of Anhui Province, such as tea, hemp, bamboo, wood, eggs, and cocoons, were mostly seasonal.  Imposing taxes in two seasons each year would not only make it difficult to ascertain the exact amount of capital, but the tax collection period would also be inconvenient for business. The Finance Commissioner, by analogy with Zhejiang Province, drafted seven articles of a plan to negotiate with trade associations to undertake the business tax. These articles were submitted to and passed by the Provincial Government Standing Committee. To date, only the egg merchants' association has recommended representatives who have been approved to undertake the provincial egg business tax, with an annual quota of 80,000 yuan. No one is willing to undertake the taxes on items such as bamboo, wood, tea, silk, and cocoons due to the lack of certainty in collection after the floods. Therefore, a quota number was proposed and resolved by the Provincial Government Standing Committee that before anyone undertakes the taxes, the Finance Department would temporarily send personnel to set up offices to collect the taxes. The quotas are as follows: A. Bamboo and wood category: 100,000 yuan for various counties in southern Anhui, and 70,000 yuan for counties in central and northern Anhui. B. Tea category: 120,000 yuan for various Qing counties in southern Anhui, and 60,000 yuan for counties in central Anhui. C. Hemp category: 30,000 yuan for Lu'an. D. Cocoon and silk category: 30,000 yuan for various counties in southern Anhui, and 10,000 yuan for counties in central and northern Anhui. E. Egg category: 80,000 yuan for various counties in the province. The total annual quota for the above five categories is 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Special Education News</p>
<h3>Saving the Nation and Resisting Aggression Through Educational Transformation (1)</h3>
<p>(President of the School of Social Sciences, National Labor University) A few days ago, the Nanjing Central Daily News issued a special publication soliciting opinions from the domestic academic community on the subject of resisting Japan and saving the country. I am ashamed to be included in that group. As far as I can see, the basis for saving the nation and resisting aggression lies in earnestly developing science and culture and restoring our nation's inherent ability to create culture. All forms of impassioned and indignant gestures cannot erase the current humiliation, let alone save us from future disasters. Although this is common talk with no grand insights, I have been deeply committed to it for many years and have never wavered. It is because cosmic truth has its own measure, and the more common the saying, the truer the principle. If it exceeds its scope, it will tend towards heresy. For more than a month, the public has been passionate, but it has only ended in passion. There is still no concrete proposal from the entire country. Only Mr. Liang Shuming has shown unique insight and been able to pay attention to culture, which is particularly gratifying. (However, there is still room for discussion on Mr. Liang's views, which will be discussed separately.) As for the students in various places, initially impassioned and indignant, they then avoid responsibility by feigning illness to save the nation and taking the opportunity to strike from class. This kind of suicidal mentality and behavior is actually ten thousand times more dangerous than the brutality of Japan and only causes us sorrow.</p>
<p>Culture is the result of human efforts in seeking survival, adapting to the environment, improving life, and inventing and transforming. Without effort and struggle, there is no occurrence of culture. Without invention and transformation, there is no progress of culture. If mankind wants to survive, it cannot be without struggle for a single day and cannot be without culture. If a nation wants to progress, it cannot but strive to improve its culture. Therefore, the progress of culture is the progress of the nation, and the demise of culture is the demise of the nation. Therefore, I say that the key to the rise, fall, survival, and demise of a nation lies in culture, and the basis for resisting Japan and saving the country lies only in culture.</p>
<p>Chinese national culture flourished in the Yellow River basin and declined in the Yangtze River basin era. The spirit of the Yellow River basin era culture was effort, struggle, creation, and improvement. The spirit of the latter was laziness, licentiousness, debauchery, and extravagance. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor made boats and vehicles and built palaces. Leizu taught silkworm rearing. Suiren drilled wood to make fire. Youchao taught people to build houses. Shennong tasted all kinds of herbs as medicine, solving people's lives and improving people's clothing, food, housing, travel, and various lifestyles. It was truly the golden age of our country's cultural development. Unfortunately, later generations became fond of ease and hated work, advocated conservatism, and rejected progress. Not only did they follow ancient systems without improvement, but they also completely eliminated the national spirit of creating culture. The richness of Jiangnan made the people accustomed to licentiousness, and the complete decadence of the Six Dynasties was a symptom of the decline of Chinese culture. Although the surface of people's lives in today's metropolitan areas has improved, this kind of deformed development is enough to expose the weakness of national backwardness. If we remove the elements of Western culture from today's state, has what remains progressed compared to the Yellow Emperor era? I fear it has only declined. In thousands of years of long history, national culture has not made any progress, but has become increasingly lazy and decadent. Desires are insatiable, and there is reliance on Western materials everywhere, resulting in the complete loss of the spirit of independence in national life. The loss of this spirit of independence is actually more dangerous than the inability to be politically independent. The current poverty of the country and people is clear evidence of this. This is truly a great crisis for the nation's future.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains Qualifications for Graduation from Law and Political Science Specialties</h3>
<p>According to the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, the head of the Minqing County Education Bureau stated that the current education system is different from the past, and disputes often arise due to the rotation of public land. In this clan, there are graduates from the Fujian Private Law and Political Science Specialty School who are allocated public land. Chen Qiming and others do not agree because they believe that specialty schools and universities are obviously different. Therefore, they have submitted a document to inquire whether graduation from a Law and Political Science Specialty School can be considered equivalent to graduation from a university. In the past, the university system required one year of preparatory courses and three years of undergraduate courses. According to the university organization law promulgated by the Ministry in July of the 18th year, the study period for each department in each college or independent college of a university is four years. Can the degree of graduates from a Law and Political Science Specialty School who have completed one year of preparatory courses and three years of undergraduate courses be considered the same as the degree of the above two types of university graduates? The Ministry of Education replied that graduation from a specialty school cannot be considered equivalent to graduation from a university. However, the regulations for reviewing the qualifications of civil servants, lawyers, and accountants stipulate that graduates from domestic and foreign universities or higher specialty schools recognized by the Ministry enjoy equal treatment. The dispute in Minqing County over the rotation of public land should be resolved with reference to this. You should be informed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains That There Are No Grade Restrictions for Military Training</h3>
<p>According to the National Central University, the military education program stipulates that all university students should receive two years of military training, from the first to the second grade. The regulations are clear and unambiguous. However, the grade placement of transfer students in the current year varies. Some have not received military training, while others have received one year or half a year of military training. If students transferring to the second and third grades have not received military training at all, can they be exempted from training or required to complete one or two years of training? Furthermore, those who apply for the second and third grades but are transferred to the first grade due to insufficient academic level, and whose military training has been completely completed or has been completed for a certain number of years, do not need to continue training or supplement what was lacking from the original school to be given credits. These exceptional circumstances are clearly documented, but there are no precedents to follow. Students are constantly questioning, which is impossible to handle. Only by submitting a detailed explanation can a response be provided. The Ministry of Education instructed that the revised military education program for secondary schools and above only stipulates that the duration of military education training is two years and does not have grade restrictions. Transfer students who have not received military training should receive the same military training as students at this school. Those who have received part of their military training but have not completed the limit should immediately make up the training period. Those who have completed the limit do not need to train again. You should be informed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Disturbance at Zhejiang University</h3>
<p>President Shao Resigns in Anger</p>
<p>The Education News Agency reports that on the afternoon of the 4th, students from the College of Agriculture of National Zhejiang University went to the city to petition the president about funding issues. President Shao met with them in the auditorium. The students from the College of Agriculture requested three points: (1) One-third of the 30,000 yuan of scientific research equipment funds that the board of directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation decided to subsidize the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences this year should be allocated to the College of Agriculture. (3) The president should be responsible for the funding of the College of Agriculture in the future and should not be in arrears again. At that time, President Shao replied that the first point could not be decided due to the bylaws of the China Culture Foundation's board of directors. The third point was that the president was responsible for the funding of the school, but the national and provincial treasuries were extremely stretched and often could not allocate funds on time. Furthermore, no funds had been received for the first two months of this year, so the school's funding was even more difficult. He could not guarantee that there would be no arrears in the future, but he would do his best. As for the second point, the surplus funds of the secretariat had already been allocated to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. A school affairs meeting would be held again on the 6th of this month to decide on a solution. While the students from the College of Agriculture were about to resolve the issue, students from the College of Engineering entered the auditorium temporarily. Several professors from the College of Agriculture asked the president to temporarily leave the meeting for a talk. Suddenly, some students from the College of Engineering surrounded the president, demanding a temporary meeting and declaring that the professors from the College of Agriculture would be expelled and not allowed to participate. The situation was chaotic. President Shao retreated to his office, and the students swarmed in and broke the glass door of the office. Seeing that the students' discipline had deteriorated to this point, President Shao was extremely saddened and announced his resignation in the auditorium. That night, he telegraphed the Ministry of Education, asking them to send someone to take over.</p>

<h3>The Student Volunteer Army Training Office Will Start Working Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Hu Shuhua Negotiates with Wang Boling for Ammunition</p>
<p>After Wang Boling, the director of the Shanghai Student Volunteer Army Training Office, arrived in Shanghai, he established an office in the library of Labor University. The office is organized into three sections: (1) Training Section, (2) Organization Section, (3) General Affairs Section. The head of the General Affairs Section is Mr. Zhu Yiming, an advisor to the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He came to Shanghai with Director Wang and went to Jiangwan Labor University yesterday morning to order the staff to tidy up the rooms so that Director Wang could hold an inauguration ceremony at 10:00 tomorrow morning and start working. Tongji, Zhonggong, Fisheries, Merchant Marine, Fudan, and Datong have all prepared to report on the real situation of the volunteer army in each school. According to Mr. Zhu, Director Wang came to Shanghai with patriotic enthusiasm and must earnestly perform his duties. He will encourage the young students of each school to endure hardships and receive strict discipline and training in order to be able to serve the country in the future and meet the expectations of all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Hu Shuhua Asks for Ammunition. A reporter from the Guomin News Agency met with Hu Shuhua, the president of Tongji University, yesterday to ask for his opinion on the volunteer army in this city. Mr. Hu said that the volunteer army in this city should be earnestly managed for the sake of saving the country, but three months of training may not be effective. During the European War, he personally saw that European students could fight after being slightly trained because they had a foundation. However, Chinese students do not have this foundation and may not be immediately applicable. It should also be noted that the central government only issues guns and not ammunition, which is a pity. If the government can issue ammunition and schedule the target practice time for a certain school, and issue ammunition on time, then there will be no danger, and the students' practical target practice will definitely be impressive. I (Hu) will discuss with Mr. Wang Boling about issuing ammunition appropriately.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Evening's First Western-Style Boxing Match for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Kwok Wai Tak, a Chinese Man, Astonished the Audience</p>
<p>＝Defeated Murray in Four Rounds＝</p>
<p>One of the Most Exciting Scenes of the Entire Evening</p>
<p>－Tonight at 9 PM, Renowned Professionals Will Compete－</p>
<p>Kwok Wai Tak, with his profound wrist strength and admirable spirit, wrestled with his opponent Murray for four rounds, ultimately emerging victorious. This created a fervent atmosphere throughout the venue, marking an important scene in yesterday evening's inaugural Western-style boxing competition for disaster relief. It can also be considered a victorious commemoration of the first time a Chinese person from Shanghai participated in such a competition. On that evening, there were a total of thirteen bouts, involving twenty-six participants, all of whom were amateurs. Among them were two Americans, three British children, six from the Scottish team, one from the Macklin team, one from the Italian Navy, one Western police officer, nine from the Shanghai Overseas Chinese community, and three Chinese individuals, namely Kwok Wai Tak, Pang Pan, and Fong Tsang Kam Choi. Tonight at 9 PM will be the second competition, with participation from renowned professionals.</p>
<p>－Organizing Staff－</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Individuals Sharing Important Responsibilities</p>
<p>Initiators: Soong Tse-ven, Chang Chun, Yu Ya-ching, Mcnaghten, Hogg, Mr. Faiming, Mr. Thomas</p>
<p>Executive Committee: Chairman Soong Tse-liang, Vice Chairman Yahara, Secretary and Accountant Mr. Sheng, Kai Lai Fsi, Glover, Shen Suliang, Zhang Zhuping, Kwok Wai Tak, Xu Zhendong, and twenty others.</p>
<p>－Venue Arrangement－</p>
<p>Chinese Participants Particularly Numerous</p>
<p>The venue is located inside the International Businessmen's Guild Hall at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road. The fighting platform is situated in the center of the hall, one foot above the ground, surrounded by three giant ropes. Over a dozen spotlights are installed around the platform. During the fight, all lights in the hall are extinguished, with only the spotlights on the platform brightly illuminating the scene, making the audience's view exceptionally clear. Around the platform are press seats and positions for various staff members. Tickets are priced at twenty yuan, fifteen yuan, ten yuan, five yuan, three yuan, and one yuan, in five denominations. Spectators were very crowded, with Chinese individuals accounting for the majority. The purpose of the audience was half for charity disaster relief, and half for appreciating the artistry of our Chinese Kwok Wai Tak.</p>
<p>－The Truth of the Great Battle－</p>
<p>Kwok Wai Tak's Artistry Captivated People</p>
<p>The final bout of the thirteen, the climax of the entire show, was also the most interesting battle. Kwok Wai Tak was the protagonist of this bout. When he was studying in the United States, he was the captain of the boxing team funded by his mother. He is currently employed at the Shanghai Mint, and the factory director Kwok Piu is his esteemed father. After returning to China, he diligently practiced in his spare time. Therefore, once he stepped onto the stage, he unleashed renowned techniques and defeated the strong enemy Murray, a skilled fighter from the Scottish army. Murray was both experienced and robust. Fortunately, Kwok employed endlessly changing techniques, causing Murray to fall under his pair of leather gloves. In the four rounds of combat, Kwok completely dominated the first round, his hands alternating in striking with endless mysteries, so that the strong enemy Murray hardly knew how to cope, falling to the ground several times. In the second round, Kwok continued to maintain an extremely advantageous position. Finally, Murray got up, and Kwok, being careless, was also knocked down once. In the third round, Murray, with his strength renewed, rose to fight and stood on par with Kwok, evenly matched and indistinguishable in skill. At the beginning of the fourth round, Kwok, not succumbing to pressure, was trapped near the ropes, appearing extremely dangerous. Suddenly, his spirit surged, and he stood up to fight, wrestling with all his might, again resulting in a stalemate. The great battle ended, and the referee announced Kwok's victory. The entire venue applauded in congratulation. Afterwards, Mr. Fleming presented the awards. Kwok received a large silver cup from the Ministry of Finance, Soong Tse-ven. The remaining winners and losers each received a silver cup, presented by Kung Hsiang-hsi, Chang Chun, Soong Tse-liang, and others.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Voice of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>— Yen Chung-lou</p>
<p>Ever since Japan occupied our Eastern Provinces, compatriots across the country have been dismayed and frightened. All have been striving to rouse themselves and find ways to save us from danger and death. Leafing through various newspapers, one sees anti-Japanese writings everywhere. All kinds of books put out special anti-Japanese collections. Anti-Japanese slogans are plastered all over the streets and alleys. The masses often wear black armbands and rings engraved with oaths to avenge national humiliation, in an effort to keep this impression in mind and never forget.</p>
<p>Recently, I have made a type of national salvation card. On the card is drawn a red heart, within which are embedded the eight characters "Work hard, strive to improve oneself, save the nation." I deeply appreciate the words of the ancient philosophers: "Only when one improves oneself can the family be harmonious; only when the family is harmonious can the nation be governed." In the current urgent task of saving the nation, self-improvement should be seen as the only essential. Therefore, I have specially printed this type of card to give to relatives and friends, to engrave on their right side as a common guide to follow.</p>
<p>Every New Year, relatives and friends often send each other New Year cards. I believe that this year's New Year cards should be changed to national salvation cards. The style of the cards can be designed in various ways, with words of warning and encouragement mutually gifted, achieving two goals with one action.</p>
<p>Why Discuss Important Matters Without Eliminating the Weeds in the Courtyard?</p>
<h3>Scientific Children</h3>
<p>Two Little Darlings, Asking About Truth and Exploring Truth</p>
<p>Do you know that the present is a scientific world? A scientific world should have a scientific China. Who will create a scientific China? Children will create it! When the children of China all become scientific children, then our China will naturally and gradually become a scientific China.</p>
<p>I hope that you two will immediately become scientific children from today onwards. How does one become a scientific child?</p>
<p>You need to climb the science tree and pick some science fruits. I am now sending you two types of books: one is "Children's Life," published by the Little Friends Bookstore, and the other is "Children's Science Series," published by the Children's Bookstore. These books will teach you how to climb the science tree, how to pick science fruits, and how to become a scientific child.</p>
<p>These books are not for you to just look at, but to guide you in playing scientific tricks and conducting scientific experiments. If you hide them away without looking at them, or look at them without doing anything, then you would be letting down my good intentions.</p>
<p>It's almost winter, and winter is almost here. You're probably going to have to wear gloves, right? A scientific child's hands are busy from morning till night and don't need gloves. Tell your mom, "This year, we are both scientific children and won't wear gloves anymore. Please use the money for buying headbands to buy us materials for experiments."</p>
<p>Please eat the things I'm sending you without worry! In the past, when I bought cocoa candies to send you, I would always eat one first to see if it was spoiled inside. This time, I've tasted all the science fruits I'm sending you, so eat them without worry!</p>
<p>Among these science fruits, there are a few that I personally picked and put in a flower basket together to send to you. This way, the fruits I send to you can also be sent to children all over the country to taste together. The children of the new era will definitely approve of my way of achieving multiple benefits with one action.</p>
<p>Fathers, I don't hope for any other reward after you eat these fruits, I only hope that you will write me a letter every week telling me about the little scientific tricks you've played and the scientific experiments you've conducted, so that I know that you have indeed become scientific children and are determined to create a scientific China. I would be completely satisfied.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best in climbing the science tree. Climb high and pick those plump fruits to feed to people all over the world. Don't just eat your fill and forget the people under the tree.</p>
<p>Your dad is also your friend.</p>
<h3>A County Magistrate of Chongqi Sub-County</h3>
<p>— Kunhua</p>
<p>Our Qi originally belonged to the outer sand of Chongming, located on the northern bank of the Yangtze River estuary. Separated from Chong Island by forty li of river surface, it was no less than a divide of sky and sea. The people of Qi, thinking of escaping the bonds of the people of Chong, were brewing separation and governance. Over several decades, it finally came to fruition in the 17th year of the Republic. The people of Chong, hoping for a renewed merger, spared no effort in continuous action. Now, the case, having been resolved by the provincial government and finalized, made it difficult to change. Perhaps the cunning schemes of the people of Chong could be slightly curbed. Looking back on the merits of the sub-county, it was largely thanks to the county magistrate Yuan Xiluo's fearlessness of difficulties and avoidance of suspicion, demarcating boundaries and establishing a definitive plan. Although the people of Chong repeatedly appealed to the provincial government and the national government, they ultimately had no way to overturn it. To this day, what the people of Qi praise and do not forget is Yuan Gong, a member of the old Tongmenghui, participating in secret work in successive revolutions. In the first year of the Republic, when the First Premier took office in Nanjing, he was recommended as a representative of Jiangsu Province and personally handed the seal of the Provisional President. With an inherently upright nature, he delighted in speaking out against injustice. Therefore, he had the reputation of "Machine Gun." In the winter of the sixteenth year, he was ordered to come to Qi, initially as an administrative member of the outer sand, preparing for the sub-county affairs. At that time, sea bandits were rampant, and alerts were frequently heard. One evening, it was suddenly reported that the bandits had completely arrived, only twenty li away from the town. The officials in the Longzhen Town government scattered like birds and beasts, urging him</p>
<h3>Feeling the Times (1)</h3>
<p>— Ma Xiaozhou</p>
<p>Not selling Japanese goods is loving the country; not using Japanese goods is killing the enemy; striving for domestic production is the best policy for saving the nation.</p>
<p>The three islands of Fusang, like bullet pills, are narrow and densely populated, making it difficult to gain a foothold. To strive for survival, they seek to plunder, seizing opportunities to hunt. Unluckily, the plump China stands in the vital path. We must not be complacent in our efforts to survive. Unanimously develop domestic production, invisibly causing the wild eagle to be殘.</p>
<h3>Feeling the Times (2)</h3>
<p>— Ma Xiaozhou</p>
<p>When national crisis looms, one must urgently save oneself; contribute wealth if one has wealth, contribute strength if one has no wealth.</p>
<p>The mansion is tottering in the wind and rain; the cries of chickens do not stop, and sad thoughts move to Wu Zixu. How can one say there are no extraordinary scholars? In the restoration of the Han, it should be known that there were strong men. Bu Shi contributed wealth, and the captives'胆怯. Wang Qi charged into battle, and the enemy's威移. Only by preserving the nest can one find intact eggs. Fellow patriots, rise up quickly and give chase.</p>
<p>to take refuge. Publicly, he cannot say "I will guard this place"; how can I avoid it? I even want to hold on to my office. So he summoned a police officer and obtained one, bringing a gun to inspect it, only to find it was unusable. "If you can guard it, then guard it; if you cannot guard it, then leave. Don't force it." The police officer then left. He then summoned a certain member of the local party department. By then, it was late at night. The member arrived, panting. The magistrate said, "The bandits are coming soon; why not quickly take refuge?" I must change my sleeping place several times every night, tying the party department's seal to my trousers, fearing it might be lost. The magistrate said, "The bandits are coming soon; can you guard this with me?" The member委否否, and so he waved him away. He returned to the office, sat precariously at his desk, and read for four hours, ultimately not seeing the bandits arrive. The clerks of the office gradually gathered, and he sent someone to investigate, learning that the bandits had turned back early after reaching Longzhen Town. The magistrate had governed Qi for more than a year, diligently and lovingly, and his reputation was widely praised. After the sub-county was established, he urgently sought to leave, submitting several resignations. Local people repeatedly urged him to stay. The magistrate said, "If I stay here, the ill feelings of the people of Chong Qi will probably never be dispelled. I have enabled the people of Qi to have a county; where can I not be an official? I must leave." At that time, the sea bandit Pan Kaiqu was powerful, with a crowd of thousands of followers, plaguing the three counties of Tonghai Qi. A meeting was held in Haimen, deciding to appease him, appointing Bandit Pan as the head of the three counties' defense, providing his salary. The signing was about to proceed when the magistrate firmly objected, saying, "Pan is a wolf with wild ambitions; there should be suppression, not appeasement." Everyone looked embarrassed. The magistrate angrily said, "The people of Qi have painfully borne the salary; I do not want to obstruct the agreement of the three counties with my departure. I, representing the public opinion of the people of Qi, will sign, but I insist on a thorough suppression." At that time, the provincial order to transfer him to Taicang was about to take effect. His unyielding spirit was often like this. Those who have the responsibility to defend the land and the power to resist the enemy are loudly advocating non-resistance; how does one compare them to the magistrate? (Moved to Fundraising)</p>
<h3>The Rōnin Shops of Qingdao and Jinan</h3>
<p>— Bingding</p>
<p>The overweening ambition of the violent Japanese towards our country is manifest in every means of aggression they employ. The reason for this is due to the wide-open doors of our country, the inability to reclaim consular jurisdiction. The Japanese who come to our country rely on the violence of their navy and the protection of concessions, behaving lawlessly. All dens of iniquity originate from what the Japanese do. Thus, the Japanese nature inherently contains aggressive ambitions and is also base and despicable. No matter what, things that the people of other countries would disdain to do, the Japanese all consider to be where the great profit lies. Therefore, all narcotics that are strictly prohibited by national laws are regarded by the Japanese as the sole business to bring disaster to China. The Japanese bases in our country are naturally in South Manchuria and Eastern Shandong, and of the Eastern Shandong region, the areas of Qingdao and Jinan are the</p>
<p>most prominent. Both of these areas are places where the Japanese have special influence. The majority of the shops in these two areas are owned by Japanese. The so-called rōnin shops are those that specialize in businesses not tolerated by national laws, such as morphine, opium, heroin, and other drugs. The number of them is truly shocking. In their own country, these Japanese rōnin are viewed as a scourge by their government, who move to crack down on them. But once they come to our country, they are protected without end, as they are able to be the root of aggression in our country. There are about two hundred rōnin shops in the area of Qingdao, of which no more than one in a hundred is engaged in legitimate business, and all of them are engaged in selling drugs and smuggling arms to supply bandits. Roughly speaking, those selling morphine and heroin account for five-tenths, those selling opium account for three-tenths, and those transporting arms account for two-tenths. Because they are closely protected by the Japanese police, the local government cannot arrest them. The rōnin shops in Jinan are fewer than in Qingdao, but there are still about one hundred of them, mostly branches of the Qingdao shops. The drugs and arms that the rōnin shops in Qingdao sell are openly transported to Jinan via the Jiaoji Railway, which is managed by the Japanese. Moreover, when their country violently invades our country, these rōnin rise up in response, each with firearms, even more cruel than the military. The reason why Liaodong was able to be as if entering a land without people was also due to the support of these rōnin. How can we not be afraid?</p>

<h3>The Country Bumpkin Goes to Shanghai Again (8)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>At this time, the two men almost fought over a picture magazine. Everyone stopped them, saying, "This is not a big deal. Why are you two arguing?"</p>
<p>After a while, they talked about other things.</p>
<p>"I wonder how things are with Zhu and Mao in Jiangxi recently." This was a guest who liked to talk about current events. He talked about current events everywhere, sometimes talking out of turn. He said that Chiang Pai-chi and Chiang Pai-li were brothers, that Tang Sheng-chih was the son of Tang Shao-yi, that Yuan Shih-kai was not dead, that Old Madam Soong had seven sons and eight sons-in-law, that Zhang Tianshi was only twelve years old this year, and that the Xuantong Emperor and the Duke Yansheng had become relatives. Now, from who-knows-where, he suddenly brought up the Zhu and Mao issue.</p>
<p>At this time, no one in the whole car followed up on what he said. But the country bumpkin felt that the atmosphere was too quiet.</p>
<p>"I happen to know a little about the situation with Zhu and Mao," he said, wanting to show off that he had this little bit of knowledge, and was pleased with himself among the many passengers.</p>
<p>However, there was a man sleeping next to him. That man was wearing a short black silk jacket, with his chest open, revealing a snow-white undershirt inside. He was also wearing a pair of large black silk trousers, rolled up to his kneecaps, revealing the shaggy black hair on his calves, and dragging a pair of patent leather shoes. Although he was sleeping there, his eyes were closed, but his ears were open. He listened carefully to what the people in the car were saying. Now, he heard the country bumpkin sitting next to him say that he "knows the situation with Zhu and Mao." Wasn't this a fish jumping into the net on its own? He thought, "No wonder people say that the Communist Party specializes in inciting peasants. Communist Party members have been found in several places in the countryside. Look at this skinny old man, looking rustic and unsophisticated, but secretly communicating with the Communist Party. I, the detective, have unintentionally detected this today. This is no small achievement!"</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Rumors of a Sudden Crash</h3>
<p>Shocking News… England to Change to Silver Standard</p>
<p>A steep fall of 23 taels. Yesterday, the Gold Exchange had a full day of business. The fluctuations in standard gold were unpredictable, and the fall was historically fierce, akin to a mountain collapsing and the sea overturning. In total, the day saw a fall of 28 taels. Looking back, it had already broken the 670 tael mark. Domestic speculative fervor was high, but overseas silver market trends diverged. Especially with the Sino-Japanese situation evolving into worsening conditions, Japan was holding emergency meetings to discuss banning gold exports, leading to hopes of a rise in silver prices. As a result, the people were in utter terror, and the trend of remittances loosened. Afterwards, the market was even more turbulent, with rumors that England would switch to silver coinage and temporarily abandon the gold standard. Upon hearing this news, large players in the market rushed to sell, causing another sharp fall of more than ten taels, breaking the 60 tael mark. Consequently, exchanges with England and America became increasingly weak. In the end, a massive plunge of 23 taels occurred, and the chaotic market situation was entirely unmanageable.</p>
<p>The Forward Market Breaks Below the 70 Tael Mark. The market opened at 677.5 taels, down one tael from the previous day. However, in the early morning, around 80 taels were traded. A large transaction indeed fell by 5/16, while the price of silver rose by 1/4. Wansheng and Shunli took the lead in selling "shan" (short positions), followed by 77 Liang and Tongbenchang, Neixing, etc. buying in. Immediately, the price rose to 80 Liang and 6 qian. Suddenly, Cuichang, Yongtong, Taichang, Hengchang, Yongdeng, etc. came to sell. Furthermore, the remittance market was weak, with HSBC buying December US dollars at 33.25 yuan and Huabi buying January English gold at 19.3125. Subsequently, Qianchang, Xiangfuchang, Renxingyong, and others from outside the market all came to sell. The market atmosphere was quite poor, and the price had already fallen to 71 taels. In an instant, it rose again to 75 taels and 3 qian, as items were bought. Also, forward US dollars and US-Japanese yen were traded at 33.25 yuan to English gold. The announcement was that US dollars would not change, so Changsan was 3.75. At that time, the exchange rate returned greatly, so it was 73 taels and 2 qian. Then it increased again to 6 taels. However, the internal market was very weak, and Maixing bought March US dollars at 33.5 yuan. Afterwards, American Silver Company sold US dollars and drafts, so the market became even weaker. Among the industry players, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Fuchang, Yuanxingyong, Hengchangyong, and Dalianbang tried hard to sell, almost like a river flowing downwards. A plunge of several taels to 10:30 AM reached 67 taels, and then American Silver and Gold Bank bought 6.25. Then, English gold at 19.5 came in. Later, head-covering (arbitrage) traders came in, and Mitsui and Mitsubishi did December English gold at 19.25. At 10:45 AM, it was 69 taels and 8 qian. Again, with English gold added to 19.5625, the selling pressure in the market was intense, and a frenzied fall of 6 taels occurred. At 11:30 AM, it was 61.5 taels. Dadecheng, Wupin, and Cuichangyong came in, and it was heard that the Indian remittance had gone down a little, and 12 anna was immediately raised by 1.4 taels, exceeding 68 taels. At closing, it was 67 taels and 7 qian, and then it increased again to over 69 taels. The market was bewildered and helpless, and the quoted price was changed to 738.9 taels, estimated to be 70 taels down.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Became Uncontrollable. The afternoon market opened at 70 taels, and in an instant, a waterfall-style market appeared, with Daxingyong, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Yuanxingyong, Hengxingcheng, Chengrenyong, and Renlianbang boldly selling. As a result, the price fell to the border of 60 taels. Rumors circulated from foreign telegrams that England had abandoned the gold standard and switched to silver, so people became even more panic-stricken and lost color. Suddenly, the 60 tael mark was broken, and the sellers continued to sell non-stop. English gold was 19.6875, and US dollars had broken through 34 yuan. By 3:30 PM, it was only 53 taels and 5 yuan. Maoyong and Fuchang Neixing bought, and then pulled up 4 taels to 7 taels and 4 qian. However, the market sentiment was extremely weak and cowardly, and it still fell back 5 taels. At slightly after 4:10 PM, it suddenly became 51.5 taels, and US dollars rose even more to 34.875 yuan. Banks bought some, and then it returned to over 3 taels, estimated to be 56 taels. At this time, HSBC absorbed at 34.25 yuan, and in a moment, it was less than 1.5 taels. At 4:30 PM, the market closed at 55 taels and 5, a sharp drop of 23 taels compared to the previous noon, and it was further suppressed to 54 taels, with few buyers. According to the record, the highest was 80 taels and 6 qian, the lowest was 52.5 taels, a total of 28 taels and 1 qian. Wupin was 79 taels in the early market, 69 taels at the noon closing, 70 taels in the afternoon, and 55 taels and 5 qian at the closing. The quoted price was suppressed to 70 taels to 80 taels. The registered price was 68 taels in the morning and 56 taels in the afternoon. The bare bar was estimated to add 9 taels.</p>
<p>The trading was extremely complex and chaotic. According to statistics, Yuan Maoyong, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Neixing, Taifengcheng, and Shitou, etc. all entered. Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, Fuchang, Fuyu Hengchangyong, Futaiheng, Yu Da, Daxingyong, Yuanxingyong, Chengfengyong, and Wu, as well as the American Silver Company, all exited. Shunli Yuantai, Zhifengyong Cuichangyong, Huixiang, and Hengxing had inconsistent ups and downs. In the afternoon, Fuchang, Yuanmaoyong, and Bingxing all entered. Tongtaichang, Wanxing, Yifeng, Shunli, Futaiheng, Dadecheng, Daxingyong, foreign merchant Qiaozhifu, Hengxing, Cheng Dayong, Yuanxingyong Yu Da, Xie Xingyong, and Cuichangyong all exited in large quantities. Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, Tianxiang, Longsheng, Dehe, Zhifengyong, etc. entered and exited frequently and were extremely busy. Dalianbang entered more than 2,000 bars and exited a total of 3,000 plus bars, already occupying a large short position. Guangdong gang exited 600 and entered 2-300.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Market is Excessively Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, English silver fell and American silver rose. The market was flat, but the exchange rate between England and America suddenly rebounded. Therefore, HSBC's listed price for American exchange had lengthened by 3.75, making it 32.5 yuan. The English gold did not change. Also, the French franc joined at 8 yuan, and the German exchange added half a mark for foreign currency. Hong Kong rebounded 4375, estimated to be 76 taels and 6875. The Singapore and Indian did not change. Probably, the internal market of banks for both English and American suddenly broke into 660 taels or less. It was said that foreign news was mostly unfavorable to the gold market. Countries planned to switch to silver to save the world's economic panic, so people were frightened. As a result, compared to the previous noon, English gold lengthened by 325, and American dollars were even stronger, lengthening by more than one yuan, coinciding with the opposite direction of Japanese merchants. Chinese merchants threw out a lot, but banks bought cheaper and cheaper. It was heard that the American Silver Company was selling US dollars. The market had about 200,000 pounds in English gold and between 500,000 and 600,000 yuan in American dollars in transactions. Among the gold industry, Fuchang and others covered in drafts, and the situation was extremely loose.</p>
<p>The internal market for English exchange had a fluctuation of 3.75. The opening price was 1 shilling and 9 pence 25 to 1875. The buying price was 3125 to 25. Huabi entered January 325. Shanghai entered March 9.5. Mitsui Mitsubishi did December 25. Shanghai bought month 5625. The noon closing selling price was 9.5 to 437. The buying price added 0625.

Mitsui entered January 6875. Maixing exited 625 and then entered 6875. The closing selling price was 625 to 5625. The buying price was 6875 to 625.</p>

The listed price of American dollars was 3 taels, 0 fen, 7 li, 692 per yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silver Futures Fall, American Silver Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to a telegram from London, Shanghai Silver Futures suddenly turned lower, a reflection of the recent continuous soaring prices.

<h3>Securities and Government Bonds Experience Renewed Decline</h3>
<p>Falling by more than one yuan to three yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th), the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw few types of spot bonds opened for trading, and transactions were scarce. The forward market was also watched by large players. Although the market price fluctuated greatly, the situation was dull. When it first opened, the situation for demand and supply was still balanced. Although the price was slightly lower than before, the number was still small. The secondary market's buying momentum gradually cleared, and it continued to fall. The market situation was serious because domestic peace had not progressed and the Japanese army disregarded the League of Nations' resolutions and massively invaded the northeast provinces. The scope of the invasion of China was expanding, and the reinforcement of troops and preparations for war were becoming more urgent. There was also a danger of provoking Soviet Russia's armed intervention. Although the powers had not expressed other attitudes, the serious situation had surpassed the past. Therefore, people in the market felt extremely uneasy and feared that war would be difficult to avoid. As a result, retail investors' selling was quite active, but the situation on all sides was very quiet. The market price of various bonds fell sharply, with supply exceeding demand, and the downward trend moved more than in the morning. As a result, reduction of force, reorganisation, 69 customs, unified salt tax, etc. all fell by several jiao to two yuan. Others also fell by one yuan, 6 or 7 jiao or so. Only the 76 financial bonds were still strong. It seemed that the bond market situation was still difficult to watch. If the diplomatic situation does not turn around, the bond price must be guarded against continued decline. Statistics for the entire day's spot trading was 25,000 yuan, and the forward trading was 5.55 million in the morning and 5.4 million in the afternoon, totaling more than 10.9 million yuan. Among them, unified tax was 2.66 million yuan, and 20 Customs and salt tax were more than 1.7 million yuan each.</p>

<h3>The Yarn, Cotton, and Yarn Market Decline Intensifies</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very sluggish, and the decline is more intense, making it difficult to be optimistic. The tight monetary situation leads to discouragement. The severe disaster situation in all directions greatly weakens the purchasing power of farmers, so the actual demand is very cold, and the market atmosphere is very weak. However, the current yarn market price can still be maintained due to the low inventory.</p>
<p>The People's Standard Continues to Fall by Two. The People's Standard early market opening saw a lack of buyers in the market, and each fell by 5, 6, 7, or 8 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price was bad and the raw cotton was loose, and the market price fell again by 6, 8, or 9 qian. The total volume of transactions for the entire day was 24,650 bales. Checking the sales, Chongyu sold 1,050 bales, Rongxing 850 bales, Yichang 1,650 bales, and Shenda 700 bales. The purchases were Gongtai 1,900 bales, Taixing 2,950 bales, Senkang 850 bales, and Tianjiang 950 bales. The closing price is recorded below:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Price Rise and Fall Account Number</p>
<p>January 1589 fell 26 0092 February 1591 fell 15 79650</p>
<p>December 1591 178670 February 592 560050</p>
<p>January 1591 491654 April 1586 1825850</p>
<p>Current Sales are Relatively Stagnant. Current yarn sales are relatively stagnant. Checking the statistics for the entire day, only 500 bales were sold by various gangs. Among the peers, 85 bales were entered, and the price fell by 5 qian and a half. Tianjin entered 35 bales from guest gangs, the mainland entered 185 bales, Fujian entered 45 bales, Guangdong entered 125 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 65 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Severely Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weak and the decline is severe. With American cotton trending down, silver prices rising daily, gold prices trending short, and news of Japanese factories being blockaded and ceasing operations becoming more intense, people are weakened. The spot price of foreign cotton is particularly cheap, so bears are again fearful and selling pressure is intense. The market is turning downwards.</p>
<p>The Han Standard Longda is More Than 7 Qian. The Han Standard early market opening saw American cotton trending down and Indian cotton even weaker, and people softened. Each fell by 4, 5, or 6 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price was falling, causing people to soften even more. Each month fell by 1 qian and a half to 3 qian. The total volume of transactions for the entire day was 127,800 dan. Checking the sales, Hengde sold 9,000 dan, Changfeng 2,600 dan, Xinheng 2,700 dan, and Yifeng 2,000 dan. The purchases were Yichang 5,100 dan, Shenchang 3,800 dan, Yiyu 1,800 dan, Dachang 2,500 dan, and Mingde 2,100 dan. The closing price is recorded below:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Price Rise and Fall Account Number</p>
<p>November 2230 fell 75 128300 February 3230 fell 65 219400</p>

<p>January 3220 70 234200 April 3230 08 88600</p>
<p>No Spot Cotton Transactions at All. Spot cotton factories have no intent to source. The source is estimated to be 550 bales of Yao cotton and 184 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>American, English, and Indian Cotton All Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially pressured by short sellers due to estimated cotton harvests favoring short positions, and then strengthened due to some short covering. Futures fell by 10 to 18 pounds, and spot fell by 15 pounds. English cotton futures and spot both fell by 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 10 points. Indian cotton was bought by Japanese merchants and sold by speculators, and the closing was calm. Pingguo and Aomula fell by 4.5 Robbie, and Bairuoxi fell by 5.25 Robbie. The original record is on the left (4th telegram):</p>

<p>Bairuoxi 187255.2527.60</p>
<h3>American Cotton Private Estimates Increase Again</h3>
<p>The New York Electric Number Four Pan Que Er Company's estimated output for this year's new cotton production is 6,748,000 pieces, an increase of 910,000 pieces compared with the previous (October 5). In addition, the amount of ginned flowers as of October 31 was 11,612,000 pieces</p>
<h3>The River Rice Sales are Strong and the Market is Stable in Liangshi</h3>
<p>There are not many sources in the southern market, and the sales channels are often open. The shape of the early japonica rice in Changxi, Tongbei, Jinchuan and other places is rising, and each additional two-corner head is higher than ordinary, and the secondary color is mediocre. Qingjiao Baige Bairen is still active due to the scarcity of goods, and the hard start corner is calculated. After arriving at the port, there is a slight surge, but the city is still very firm. The old white broken pick is taking slightly higher, and no one cares about the secondary color, and the city presents a decline. The price of Yang Du Jiantao is flat, and the situation is a little tired.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 20 or 30 ships came to Xinzha, and the city's stomachs were quite refreshed. There were limited goods at the top of the west new wharf. The price of medium-sized Gu Suci were all high. The market for wild rice was not good. The purchase price for Ningbang Jinyi increased by half a corner. The glutinous rice sales were initially sluggish and then lively, and the city's sales were lively. The sale of Yin's meal dan was clear, and the shape was tired and triangular. Du Yangjian Wu Rongru was few and far between, and the price of Baige rice was reduced by two corners.</p>
<h3>Changsha Gang Absorbs Future Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Various Foreign Firms Dump Large Amounts of Future Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot of foreign rice still had its continuation in the street, and the market was still lively. The market continued to be good for several minutes. The price of a thousand bags of small-grained rice was opened at ten yuan and a corner six points to ten yuan and a corner eight points. The price of one-and-a-half thousand bags of Taizhou white rice was also newly transacted at ten yuan and five points, and then at ten yuan. In the middle of the period, Changsha Gang absorbed some in the market, and the market atmosphere was extremely good. However, due to the violent gold prices of twenty or thirty yuan, each foreign firm dumped a large amount of future rice, with a total of over 10,000 tons of small-grained rice in March, April and May, and 2,300 tons of Saigon and other rice in November. It was dumped by Jinlong and Xianggang foreign firms, and was collected by Changsha, Hankou, and the street. The market was flat in the morning and fell in the evening, and the market atmosphere was very tired.</p>
<h3>The Noodle Market Suffers Another Setback</h3>
<p>After the opening of the noodle market yesterday morning, the quotations of foreign wheat for each month rose by about six, seven, and eight corners, causing the people inside and outside the industry to become agitated again. The opening prices for near and far futures were invisibly better than one or two points. However, the inland gangs remained on the sidelines, so although the situation was good, the volume was rare, and the increase was not much. Until the afternoon opening, it was initially stable, and then I heard that the gold market was violent, and the exchange rate also followed step by step, causing people to soften again. Although the number of dumping was not prosperous, the market atmosphere finally weakened. As a result, this month was only slightly better by two-and-a-half li, December was better by seven-and-a-half li, January was better by two-and-a-half li, February did not move, March was better by five li, and April was better by two-and-a-half li.</p>
<h3>The Future Wheat Soars with the Foreign Market</h3>
<p>Slightly Frustrated in the Afternoon Due to the Plunge in Gold Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the people were greatly shocked because the quotation of foreign wheat soared again, and the opening prices for each month rose by six, seven, and eight points. The highest price this month was three taels and four qian, and the highest price in April was four taels and three qian. However, there were very few customers and limited volume, because the mainland gangs were unwilling to enter or leave due to the fear of the same track. Until the afternoon opening, the highest price this month was three taels and nine qian and four points, and the highest price in December was four zero five points. However, due to the miserable decline in the gold market, people were also affected. This situation may be due to some changes internationally. As a result, this month still rose by seven points compared to the day before, December rose by six points, January rose by four points, February and March rose by two points, and April rose by three points.</p>
<h3>Hardware English Steel Plate Trend Turns Weak</h3>
<p>Although the hardware transaction has been creeping for several days, the number is very small, so it has nothing to do with the prosperity and disgrace of each city. The English steel plate market, which was at its peak last month, has also been sluggish and lifeless recently. Although all colleagues have tried their best to sell it, it is ultimately due to the suspension of business by the northern gang that there is no active atmosphere. The market price has been rising very strongly because the shilling has rebounded very strongly, and there is a trend towards weakness. At the moment, the market is selling at 8 taels, two qian and a half, half a point, and six taels and two qian and a half, or seven and a half at five taels and seven qian and a half, and two points at five taels and five qian, and half a point or more are sold at five taels and two qian and a half. Recently, except for the slightly more sales of the two grades of half and two points, the other colors are rarely opened.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Domestic Cotton Flannel Step-by-Step Increase</h3>
<p>The piece goods market has risen sharply because there are not many domestic products, resulting in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. In particular, the coloured striped flannels produced in Changzhou and Changre are being sold at a profit and have been sold for eight taels. Cotton flannel has also gradually risen from two qian and five fen to two qian and seven fen and a half due to the scarcity of products, and the retail price of Hongcao's Three Sheep brand has reached three qian, because the weather is getting colder and colder and the sales of the door shops are unusually smooth. However, white flannel is in a dull situation due to the crowding of products and the impact of floods in foreign ports. Yesterday's 22 Jincheng was 6 taels and 7 qian and a half, and the 13-pound trolley was 10 taels, and the 15-pound trolley was 11 taels. The 15 pound trolley was 11 taels. Shenxin's double clock alone rose by 1 qian and sold for 8 taels and 5 fen, the 3-clock was 8 taels and 5 qian and a half, the 16-pound 24 double fish Jiqing was 10 taels and 6 qian, and the 260 was 10 taels and 7 qian and a half. There is still a shortage of spot coarse cloth, and 16-pound and 15-pound goods need to be distributed. The 11-pound cloth is slightly softer than before. The 3-cat is 5 taels and 5 qian and a half, the person clock is 5 taels and 5 qian, and the fine twill is 8 taels. There are still few sources of Guanshi goods and main road goods, and there are only 1-foot and 6-inch Yuanyuan velvet and silk plain satin, etc.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Shuang Gong Factory Silk Exports Decrease Further</h3>
<p>Exports in October Fell Short of 140 Bales</p>
<p>Since the Shuang Gong factory silk in this port has been on the market with new cocoons, there has been no turnaround in European sales for a long time. In addition, the suspension of sales to Japan due to the severance of diplomatic relations has led to a further decline in exports. Last month (October), only 137 bales of Shuang Gong factory silk were exported from Shanghai. Therefore, the Shuang Gong silk factories in Shanghai have reduced production and stopped machines in order to reduce production.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Fluctuations, Raw Sugar and Refined Sugar Prices Flatten</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market report from the production area stated that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.34375, and the price of New York futures sugar for December was 1.33, up one point compared to the previous report. The prices for March and May of next year were 1.28 and 1.32 respectively, with no rise or fall. The price for September was 1.43, up two points. The current price of Java sugar remained unchanged. The exchange market remained quiet. The price of Dutch No. 24 raw sugar continued to decline, with an initial transaction price of 11 taels and 1 mace, and Hong Kong goods at 11 taels and 0.05. However, the market was sluggish, and later prices were 11 taels and 0.05 for Hong Kong goods ex-warehouse, with a slight shortage in the market. No. 20 medium raw sugar was 10 taels and 0.075, and No. 16 was 10 taels and 0.06, with very little movement. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 12 taels and 0.15, HX mark was 11 taels and 0.95, ZW mark was 12 taels and 0.1, and HM mark was 10 taels, 0.475. The trend was still stable, and the exchange market remained quiet. The price of our factory's No. 1 refined sugar was 13 taels and 0.82, and No. 2 was 13 taels and 0.7. Although there were slight openings, the market was still weak. Foreign firms were selling Dutch raw sugar for delivery this month at prices ranging from 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 0.5 fen to 7.5 fen. The Fuga company sold more than 300 tons at a price of 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 7.5 fen.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Daylily Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of daylilies from various regions have been quiet, and the trend has been relatively weak. There is still a lot of inventory in the producing areas, and there has been little shipment recently. There are also few transactions of local goods here. Currently, the sales to the Cantonese and Fujianese groups, who are most interested in promoting digestion, are watching and waiting, and there is little activity. The remaining groups feel even colder. Yesterday, the top daylily stores sold for 25 taels and below, ranging from 22.5 taels to 17 taels. Secondary grade daylilies were around 15 taels. If sales do not improve, it may be difficult to recover.</p>
<h3>Coal: Kailuan Lump Coal is a Rare Commodity</h3>
<p>List price rises by 5 qian</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a significant shortage of Kailuan lump coal in stock. It is estimated that the total amount of goods currently available is less than 800 tons. However, the demand from users has been particularly strong recently, causing merchants to compete to purchase, but the current stock is truly scarce and difficult to obtain at the moment. The market situation has been quite tense recently, and those with a slight reserve of coal have a rare commodity to trade. Yesterday, the market selling price had risen from 10 taels and 0.05 per ton to 11 taels.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 1,260 barrels of tobacco leaves arrived from New York.</p>

<h3>Sixth Preparatory Meeting Postponed Again</h3>
<p>Because Zhang Ji and the Guangdong reply telegram have not arrived</p>
<p>Guangdong representative gave another speech yesterday</p>
<p>Bank representatives visited Guangdong-Nanjing representatives yesterday</p>
<p>The sixth preparatory meeting between Nanjing and Guangdong representatives was announced to be postponed. It was originally scheduled to continue yesterday morning. However, because Nanjing representative Zhang Ji went to Nanjing to ask for instructions regarding the issue of the Fourth Plenary Session, and the Guangdong representatives had not received a telegram from the Guangdong government, both parties agreed to postpone the meeting until 9:00 AM this morning, when a discussion session would be held first, and then the time for the continuation of the sixth preparatory meeting would be decided based on the discussion. The news from various parties is recorded below.</p>
<h3>The Talk the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>After the sixth preparatory meeting between Nanjing and Guangdong representatives was announced to be postponed at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, the representatives of both parties continued to hold a discussion session to discuss the issue of the Fourth Plenary Session. Because the telegram from the Guangdong government advocated postponing the Fourth Plenary Session, which was too far from the Nanjing side's proposal, the Guangdong representatives proposed a compromise after discussion: (1) The Nanjing and Guangdong sides would hold separate meetings, and the names of the executive and supervisory committee members would be determined by both parties first; (2) Regarding the reform plan for the central political system previously passed in the preparatory meeting, the right to make the final decision would be resolved in the Fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting that would be produced. Both parties then decided to ask their respective central governments for instructions on this proposal. The Nanjing representatives sent Zhang Ji to Nanjing that night to report, and the Guangdong representatives still telegraphed for instructions.</p>
<p>Wan Talks About the Reasons for the Postponement: It was originally scheduled to continue the sixth preparatory meeting yesterday morning. However, because Nanjing representative Zhang Ji did not return, and because all the Guangdong representatives received bank representatives yesterday afternoon, it was decided to change the meeting to a discussion session this morning. The formal meeting may be held this afternoon. According to Guangdong representative Wang Jingwei, the Guangdong representatives had already received a telegram from the Guangdong government advocating postponing the Fourth Plenary Session in the preparatory meeting the day before yesterday. However, when it was proposed for discussion, the Nanjing representatives firmly rejected the postponement and requested a postponement. It was decided to postpone the meeting for one day. It was originally scheduled to continue the sixth preparatory meeting this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). However, the Nanjing representatives requested a further postponement because Zhang Ji returned to Nanjing to ask for instructions. The Guangdong representatives have formally sent a letter to the Nanjing representative Cai Zimin today (i.e., today) requesting a meeting tomorrow (i.e., today) in order to realize peace and unity as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Discussion at the He Residence Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, Central Committee member He Yingqin specially invited Nanjing representatives Cai Yuanpei, Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jingjiang, Central Committee members Shao Lizi, Zhu Peide, Zhang Qun, and others to lunch to discuss the future of peace. It was heard that the result of the discussion was to decide to continue the sixth peace meeting today to avoid external doubts, and to hope that the Guangdong side would comply with the first of the three previously determined principles regarding the holding of the Fourth Plenary Session and invite the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session representatives to Nanjing as soon as possible in order to realize spiritual unity and external consistency.</p>
<h3>Meeting at Hu Hanmin's Residence</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:00 AM, Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Chen Youren, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, and Li Wenfan gathered at the Hu residence on Medhurst Road to talk. Zou Haibin did not participate due to other appointments. The content of the conversation was not disclosed. Wang Jingwei and Li Wenfan left at 11:10 to meet with representatives from all walks of life on Seymour Road. Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Wu Chaoshu, and others returned to their residences at 11:30.</p>
<h3>Talk Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Guangdong representative Wang Jingwei sent a letter to Nanjing representative Cai Yuanpei as a representative to discuss the meeting with Zhang Ji and others after their return today at 8:00 AM. Cai replied that the time was tight and changed the meeting to 9:00 AM at Wu's residence on Gordon Road. Whether the formal preparatory meeting will be held this afternoon will depend on the situation of the discussion this morning.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Does Not Change its Position</h3>
<p>Since the representatives of both parties failed to reach a result in the discussion on party affairs the day before yesterday and proposed a postponement, Nanjing representative Zhang Ji and Central Committee member Wang Youzhi went to Nanjing that night. It was heard that they attended the Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday to report on the progress of the six preparatory meetings in Shanghai and explained the Guangdong side's opinion of postponing the Fourth Plenary Session. After the discussion of the Standing Committee meeting, it was decided that the Central Committee would still maintain its original proposal on the issue of the Fourth Plenary Session and formally telegraphed the representatives Wu Tiecheng, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jingjiang, etc. yesterday afternoon, stating that the Central Committee still advocated holding the Fourth Plenary Session on schedule and hoped that the Guangdong representatives could cancel the postponement proposal and come to Nanjing as soon as possible. If there are any procedural shortcomings, they can be changed slightly.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Representative's Speech</h3>
<p>The Guangdong representatives issued a second statement yesterday. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech at the National Government Memorial Week in Nanjing on the 2nd of this month. On the 3rd, Shanghai Western newspapers recorded his words. Because of its great relationship with the future of peace talks, I took the opportunity to answer it in a reporter's talk. On the 4th, all newspapers except the family published it. On the 5th, the Chinese newspapers began to publish Mr. Chiang's speech draft, which differed from the Western newspapers. I don't know which one is correct. The Chinese draft is more peaceful than the Western newspapers, but the content still contains inaccuracies and misunderstandings about the attitude of our colleagues and the future of the peace talks. It is still of great importance, and I have to make a second reply. The points that are the same as the Western newspapers have been answered the day before and will not be repeated here. (1) On October 31, the newspapers published a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing replying to a telegram from the Nanjing representatives. I was shocked when I saw it. If there is such a telegram, then my coming to Shanghai is unnecessary and the meeting of representatives is meaningless. Therefore, I asked the Nanjing representatives if they had received this telegram. I was told that there was no such telegram. Now Mr. Chiang said, "Yesterday's record seems to say that the Central News Agency fabricated the telegram. There is no such telegram." It is in the form of a watch, but in fact, the Nanjing representatives told me that the Central News Agency fabricated this telegram, and they are willing to be responsible for the thorough investigation (see the newspapers of November 1). Although this point is not important, what is noteworthy is that today's newspapers reported that there is indeed such a telegram from Yanri, which cannot but make my colleagues feel that my coming to Shanghai is unnecessary and the meeting of representatives is meaningless. (2) Mr. Chiang said that at a time of national crisis, it is impossible to achieve results by allowing a few people to discuss day after day in Shanghai, as if the Song Dynasty's discussions were not settled and the Jin soldiers had already crossed the river. This kind of argument is the same as what Mr. Chiang said in his Yan telegram, but it is absolutely contrary to Mr. Chiang's repeated telegrams inviting me to Shanghai to discuss national affairs together. When I left Guangdong, I also considered that my virtue was thin and my ability was shallow, and that discussions in Shanghai might not be effective. However, because the people of the country were eager for peace and Mr. Chiang's invitation was sincere, I reluctantly made the trip. This should be stated first: the Song people did not know how to rectify national defense in advance, so the enemy had already crossed the river before the discussions were settled, but they still had the will to resist. But today, it is not so. How can the enemy only cross the river and enter thousands of miles into the hinterland? Not only do we not have discussions on self-defense, but we also say that we will not resist. All of this happened more than ten days before I arrived in Shanghai. This should be stated second. (3) Mr. Chiang said that the country's major plans cannot be discussed in the concession, leaving aside the capital. Let alone the fact that I am discussing in Shanghai at Mr. Chiang's telegram invitation, but in the past, the preparatory meeting for the fourth Central Plenary Session in the 16th year of the Republic of China was also held in Shanghai. Mr. Chiang may still remember it. To discuss the country's major plans, we only need a suitable location and environment. Not only can it be held in the concession of Chinese territory, but it can also be held in foreign territory. Patriotic people are doing this everywhere, and there is nothing strange about it. As for whether the location and environment of Nanjing are suitable for peace talks at this time, there is no need to elaborate, and I cannot bear to elaborate. (4) Mr. Chiang said that I do not come to relieve the country's difficulties, and it is not a way to unite against the outside world. How can I not know that my coming to Shanghai is precisely to relieve the country's difficulties? The first thing that I discussed in Shanghai was diplomacy, both to remedy the past mistakes and to offer advice on how to deal with the present and the future. Recently, the Nanjing government has implemented it. This is a direct contribution to diplomacy. The separation of Nanjing and Guangdong has a real impact on diplomacy, so we must strive for unity. However, the method of unity must eliminate all the causes of separation in order to unite Nanjing and Guangdong, and to make Nanjing and Guangdong not only a temporary unity but a permanent unity. It must be known that uniting against the outside world is of course necessary, but it cannot be used to prohibit discussions that I do not want to hear. Going to the country's difficulties together is a slogan that should be used, but it should not be used as a protective talisman everywhere. (5) Mr. Chiang proposed three principles to the Guangdong side: one is Mr. Chiang's resignation, two is the cancellation of the Guangdong government, and three is cooperation between the two sides. The newspaper reported that Mr. Chiang said that we are now taking the first road. It is probably another newspaper error, because when I was in Guangdong, I explained to the three representatives Cai Zhang and Chen sent by Mr. Chiang that it was the first road. The draft telegram of both parties prepared in Guangdong was clearly the first road. According to Mr. Chiang's own report, the draft telegram preparing to resign also clearly refers to the first road. As for why Mr. Chiang's proposed telegram asked to postpone the statement for a few days, I have already explained it in my talk on the 4th, which is purely for the sake of the overall situation. As Mr. Chiang said, I certainly did not intend to play tricks. As for my statement that although this telegram was issued, its intention was not to abandon responsibility, Mr. Chiang did not explain this point in detail, thinking that after this telegram was issued, how could this responsibility be borne? However, in the procedure formulated in Guangdong, the two parties first communicated by telegram, then organized a unified meeting, then produced a unified government, and finally Mr. Chiang implemented his resignation and the Guangdong government cancelled it. Mr. Chiang had approved this proposal in principle, and all those who hold national office, even if they resign, should be responsible when there is no one to take over, both at home and abroad, and from ancient times to the present. Moreover, Mr. Chiang bears the heavy responsibility of the country and directly commands hundreds of thousands of troops. In the midst of internal and external troubles, when he resigns, he must make a proper handover so as not to leave in frustration. This is what I firmly believe. Military officers are certainly not lifelong, and the handover will eventually come. Those who are loyal to the country must have a way to take care of themselves in the future.</p>
<h3>Bank Public Council Proposal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers' Association convened an emergency meeting of the Executive Committee yesterday to discuss the current situation and resolved two items: (1) to issue an important declaration on the current situation (see below); (2) to make suggestions on financial policy. I publicly recommended a representative to take the declaration and the proposed draft financial policy suggestions to visit the Nanjing-Guangdong peace conference representatives to present the case. It is understood that the content of the draft suggestion is as follows: (1) to jointly promote peace and unity and realize it as soon as possible; (2) after the peace agreement is reached, the government should immediately convene a financial committee to determine the military and political expenditure budget, which should be 19 million yuan according to the resolution of the National Economic Conference; (3) the above budget of 19 million yuan should be offset by income each month, and the deficit should be made up by public debt, which should not exceed 12 million yuan in cash. If the deficit exceeds 12 million yuan in cash, the budget should be further reduced; (4) In the future, when the government issues public debt, it should hand over all the debt documents to the Finance Committee and the Fund Management Committee for joint custody in order to gradually stabilize the bond market. The number of public bonds sold each month should be limited to the number suitable for the third item.</p>
<h3>Bank Representatives Visit</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, important figures in the Shanghai banking community, such as Zhang Gongquan and Hu Mengjia, made an appointment with the Guangdong representatives to hold a conversation at Hu Hanmin's residence at 5:00 PM. The Guangdong representatives arrived at Hu's residence on time. The bankers who came to visit were Zhang Gongquan, Hu Mengjia, Chen Guangfu, Wu Dingchang, and Li Fusun. Hu and the Guangdong representatives received them. The banking community expressed their opinion that the future of the peace conference has been quite pessimistic recently. Once it breaks down, the relationship will be very serious. Therefore, they sent representatives to ask the representatives to be open and honest with each other and continue the meeting so that true unity can be realized. If the opinions of the two sides differ too much, the fundamental methods of each side can be clearly announced so that a third party can use an appropriate compromise solution. The Guangdong representatives replied that the Guangdong representatives followed the proposals determined by the Extraordinary Conference, putting military rule under politics and abolishing the dictatorship system in order to produce a unified government. They then discussed military finance and other matters. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Nanjing, the Nanjing side suddenly changed its mind and made party affairs the primary issue, so that the two sides could not agree on the issue of the Fourth Plenary Session. As for the three compromises determined the day before yesterday, (1) to hold a meeting in Nanjing, (2) to hold a meeting simultaneously by both sides, (3) to postpone the meeting and re-elect representatives, the Nanjing side insisted on convening the meeting in Nanjing as scheduled, and the Guangdong side could automatically come to Nanjing to participate. However, the Guangdong side said that those who came to Nanjing to attend the meeting would wait until the unified government was produced. It is feared that it will be difficult to agree. Yesterday, I have telegraphed this intention to the Extraordinary Conference, but I have not received a reply today. The representatives then left at 7:00 PM and continued to visit the Nanjing representatives to make the same plea.</p>
<h3>The Declaration of the Banking Community</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government in the Republic of China in the sixteenth year, all the people of the country have believed that the day of destruction has ended and the period of construction has begun. All the measures taken by the party and the country are sincerely supported in order to stabilize politics and seek economic development. Unexpectedly, in the past five years, the disasters of war could not be stopped, the troubles of bandits could not be stopped, and natural disasters could not be prevented. Even the party and the country themselves could not maintain their integrity, and they were finally taken advantage of by foreign enemies who occupied Liaoji and shocked the world. The country has no way to survive, and the people have no way to live. All of us citizens ask ourselves whether our belief in the party and the country has been the same for five years, and its results have turned out to be so. We really cannot but feel infinite grief, especially my colleagues in the financial community. In the past five years, we have followed the Nationalists and constantly promoted and helped the party and the country in society. At this point, we cannot but feel a great sense of shame. Now, fortunately, the leaders of the party and the country can realize the public opinion and strive for unity. The representatives of Nanjing and Guangdong are gathered in Shanghai. We colleagues believe that at this critical moment, the opportunity cannot be missed and the time will not come again. Looking at the recent British politics, only because the economy has encountered difficulties, the Maikbaoza and other members of the other party can still sacrifice their prejudices and immediately cooperate to conform to public opinion. Is China's economy today only difficult? It is really a matter of life and death, and foreign troubles have suddenly arrived. The people can no longer take care of their own life and death, and they are rising up to fight for the survival of the country. What a tragic, serious, and urgent time this is. Can the members of the party who avoid and act in the same way still not return to good terms and stop fighting against the enemy? Unfortunately, the road is narrow and there are still many disputes. All of us citizens, and even our colleagues in the financial community, cannot help but feel bewildered and worried. We believe that under the current situation, the two sides should immediately make concessions and cooperate within a time limit, no matter what conditions are in this representative consultation. If it is absolutely necessary, the two sides should also immediately appoint a third party and quickly mediate in the spirit of mutual concession. Both sides should also accept its mediation in order to ensure that unity will be achieved. The princes must be like the tutelage politics in the princes, and the one who authorizes the tutelage politics to the princes is still the people. It can be known from the recent British election results that those who sacrifice party views and are loyal to the country will be supported by the people. Otherwise, they cannot but be subject to the true public opinion. "Conscience judges that the people are forced to have the last chance for party and national unity today, and they can no longer allow the princes to break it themselves. The princes appoint any legal group or any fair individual in the country as a mediator, the third party. We colleagues should really hold up the public's trust, although we still believe that all the members will be able to make concessions without waiting for mediation, and we are willing to take the people of the world to believe this. However, the time is urgent and we cannot help but speak out. The current dangerous situation of politics, military affairs, and diplomacy should be known to the princes. We will not say much more. We colleagues only discuss from the point of view of national economy, and we believe that if this peace talk fails and unity is lost again, then the subsequent economic capacity of the society will definitely not be able to meet the political needs of the government. This is undoubtedly true. No matter who is in power, they will not be able to do well in the future. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang's Telegram</h3>
<p>The Guangdong representatives received a telegram from Chen Jitang from Guangdong, which read: I am fully committed to the proposals of the Extraordinary Conference. Various rumors from the outside are all words of provocation. Please do not believe them lightly and continue to work hard to promote peaceful unification.</p>
<h3>Save the Party Comrades Association Telegram</h3>
<p>(Title omitted) A copy to the public. The Chinese Kuomintang Save the Party Comrades Association gathered revolutionary comrades due to the needs of the times, striving to save the party in order to achieve the national revolution as soon as possible.

The comrades of the Chinese Kuomintang Save the Party Comrades Association should immediately unite and sincerely support the realization of the great revolutionary cause, without organization, without gathering, without gathering, without struggle. Today, the advanced comrades are eager to unite against the outside world, and the people of the whole country are eager for unity and peace. The comrades of the Chinese Kuomintang Save the Party Comrades Association unanimously decided that from today onwards, the Chinese Kuomintang Save the Party Comrades Association announced the cessation of activities, wishing that the party would be restored as a whole and the country would be unified, and the disputes would be permanently ended. Then, the hard work and sacrifices of the Chinese Kuomintang Save the Party Comrades Association for a year would not be in vain. This is a telegram respectfully hoping for your attention. Save the Party Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang, micro-printed</p>

<h3>Municipal Volunteer Army Actively Proceeding</h3>
<p>Nursing Training Class Holds Entrance Examination The Municipal Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Volunteer Army, in view of the fact that the country is in dire straits and the women's world is full of Mulan-like figures, and the situation is getting tighter every day and war is inevitable, the work of rescuing and protecting in chaotic places is particularly important, but it is difficult to talk about serving the country without training, so women from all walks of life are specially solicited. Those who are over sixteen years old and have qualifications above elementary school are trained in classes to teach all battlefield rescue knowledge in the shortest period of time in order to fulfill the women's world's responsibility to serve the country. It is heard that Dr. Liu Guoxiang of Southeast Hospital has been appointed to prepare everything, and everything is ready. Women from all walks of life who have signed up are very enthusiastic. Yesterday was the date of the examination. The first batch of those admitted included more than 20 people, including Xi Mingjie, Xie Huajie, Zhang Yingjie, and Gu Qi.

<h3>Anti-Japanese Work in All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Fujian Paper Industry Refuses to Import Japanese Goods The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Fujian Jinjiang County Paper Industry Association yesterday, stating that this time, the Japanese slaves acted recklessly and invaded the Eastern Province, sending troops to harm the people, burning railways, insulting our compatriots, robbing our property, and raping and looting in a brutal and inhumane way. Upon hearing the news, the whole country was furious. Therefore, the commercial enterprises of our county established the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress on October 15 and publicly resolved to swear to economically sever ties with the Japanese slaves. From now on, if there are those who are greedy for profit and forget their righteousness and privately transport enemy goods, in addition to confiscating the enemy goods, they will also be severely punished. If the Japanese slaves are cunning by nature and can forge trademarks of other countries and mix them everywhere, how can they be cleaned up if they are not cracked down on? The National Association has requested the Chamber to quickly forward the letter to the Quanzhang Guild Hall and the Jianbang commercial firms, informing them to carefully check all the goods entrusted to them by our county. If they are negligent and mistakenly配Japanese goods, resulting in punishment by the authorities, the selling and selling parties shall be fully responsible.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation 20th District Branch Inspects Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Japanese goods inspection team of the 20th District Branch of the Municipal People's Federation continued to inspect house by house on the 4th Road in the past two days. It is estimated that more than 20 households have been sealed up in Hua Da Dongfang. The stores that have been sealed up by the industry association must also be inspected by the association, but they will not be sealed up again. The stores in the eastern section of the district have been inspected, and it is estimated that the western section can be completed today and tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Western Clothing Industry's Regional Inspection of Japanese Goods</h3>

<h3>He Yingqin and Chu Minyi Go to Nanjing</h3>
<p>He Yingqin and Chu Minyi took the night train to Nanjing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Resigns from Northeast Acceptance Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai municipal government has a heavy responsibility for maintaining public order, making it difficult for Mayor Zhang Qun to leave easily. Zhang Qun was previously appointed by the National Government as a member of the Northeast Acceptance Committee. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically inquired about his departure date and his views on accepting the lost territories. According to his statement, the National Government's appointment of him as a member of the Northeast Acceptance Committee was something he should obey and go to. However, Shanghai's affairs are complicated. In normal times, he can leave briefly and entrust the responsibilities to the Secretary-General, but since the Northeast issue arose, the diplomatic situation has been very tense, and the city's public order has become more complex. The protection of foreigners and the prevention of instability require someone to be practically responsible every day. Moreover, since Japanese ruffians have repeatedly provoked incidents, the pending cases have not been resolved, and he feels it is not appropriate to leave easily. Therefore, he has telegraphed the central government, detailing the reasons and requesting resignation. As for the acceptance of the Northeast this time, China is completely based on the resolutions of the League of Nations, which is legally justified and morally correct. In addition to formally negotiating with Japan to accept the occupied territories, there is nothing else to say. If Japan still cannot abide by the international resolutions and completely withdraw its troops to the railway area before the 16th, its atrocities will be further exposed to the world.</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Goods Certified by the National Goods Exhibition Hall Must Not Be Obstructed</h3>
<p>Joint Announcement by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government instructed that all matters related to the certification of domestically produced goods in the city should be handled by the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition Hall, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau jointly issued a notice on November 4, stating the following: "Concerning the joint issuance of the notice, it is found that there are numerous factories and shops in the city, and the products are complex and varied. There are often cases of secretly changing trademarks and counterfeiting domestically produced goods, which seriously affects the future of industry. In view of this, the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition Hall to follow the 'Provisional Standards for Chinese Domestically Produced Goods' set by the Ministry of Industry and formulate ten articles of 'Provisional Measures for Certification of Domestically Produced Goods', which were submitted to the Bureau and forwarded to the Municipal Government for approval, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was notified to instruct all manufacturers to comply. The case has been urgently opened to show the 'Provisional Measures for Certification of Domestically Produced Goods' and jointly announced to the merchants and people of the city for their general knowledge. Hereafter, all domestically produced goods that have been certified and issued a certificate by the Hall should be protected, and no organization may detain them. This announcement is hereby made." Recently, many factories in the city have gone to the National Goods Exhibition Hall to apply for certification. It is said that the Hall handles certification matters with extreme caution and can only issue certificates after detailed investigation.</p>
<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>Import of Foreign Wheat in Three Days</p>
<p>Valued at Over 3 Million National Currency</p>
<p>The large-scale arrival of Australian wheat and the large import of Japanese wheat are alarming. First, 7,000 tons of Russian wheat arrived in Shanghai, followed by two ships carrying a total of 14,000 tons of American wheat. One ship was carrying American wheat, and the other was purchased by a Shanghai factory. Yesterday, the British ship "Frangokastelo" imported 105,552 bags from New Gold Mountain, Australia, worth 700,000 silver dollars, which is already being unloaded. Another batch of about 7,000 tons, or about 100,000 bags, shipped by the "Madrid City" is also loaded from Hanzhou and Lanbang and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. These two ships of Australian wheat were purchased by various flour mills. It is estimated that about 37,000 tons of foreign wheat have arrived in Shanghai in these three days, valued at over 1 million national currency.</p>
<h3>Change of Personnel in China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau</h3>
<p>The position of head of the shipping department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau has been jointly handled by Zeng Guangqing and Li Yunchen. Zeng was originally in charge of the business department and still managed the shipping department concurrently. Recently, due to the unjustified dismissal and salary deduction of ship crew members of the Bureau's "Gongping," "Xinfeng," "Jianghua," and "Jiangjing" ships, such as Xiang Weixin, Qian Shanshan, Cheng Quansheng, and Yu Xueming, a group of ship crew members went to the Bureau to protest, causing various disputes. Although Deputy Director Cao Renze came forward to mediate and reinstate the crew members, the situation did not subside, and Li Yunchen has not been to the Bureau for four days due to an accident. The position of department head is temporarily held by Cao Renze.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Personnel Change on "Jingshun" Ship</h3>
<p>The "Jingshun" ship of the Haitong Shipping Bureau dismissed six Japanese crew members, which was reported in this newspaper. At that time, the Nan Shi Wheel Opportunity immediately sent two people to forcefully dismiss Huang Duncai and Chen Rongsheng, who were hired by Haitong. Afterwards, the Wheel Opportunity said that this matter was initiated by Chen and others privately. Now, Chen and others have presented the shipping bureau's approval documents (stored at Huang and Chen's place) to the shipping bureau, requesting a fair resolution.</p>
<h3>Commercial Ship Runs Aground and is Damaged</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's "Jiahe" ship ran aground in the vicinity of Naimaishan while traveling to Haizhou this time due to the receding tide. It took days and nights to unload 250 tons of cargo before the ship was dragged out of the shoal. In addition, the "Tunan" ship was damaged by the Bureau's "Jianguo" ship when it departed from Hankou, with the engine and deck destroyed, and has now come to Shanghai for repairs.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships to Suspend Service to Fujian</h3>
<p>Fujian Merchants Urge Dispatch of National Ships to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Dockworkers Refuse to Unload Cargo Since the boycott of Japanese goods, Fujian Province has gone a step further and suspended the loading of goods and passengers on Japanese commercial ships. Yesterday, Shanghai received a telegram from Fuzhou stating that the dockworkers at various wharves and the lightermen on the river in Fujian have unanimously decided that from now on, they will not work for Japanese ships arriving in Fujian, and they will not allow passengers to board or disembark or handle cargo. Currently, four Japanese ships of the Osaka Company's Fuzhou route are still in operation in Shanghai. After receiving the telegram, the company's Fuzhou ships plan to try to sail once or twice. If they really cannot unload cargo, they will suspend service.</p>
<h3>Fujian Community Urges Dispatch of National Ships</h3>
<p>It is currently the season for fruits to be marketed in Fuzhou, and large quantities of olives, oranges, etc., are shipped to Shanghai every year. Now that Japanese ships are being boycotted and there are no other foreign ships operating between Shanghai and Fujian, the Hakka merchants from Fuzhou have sent urgent telegrams to the China Merchants, Sanbei, and Changan Shipping Bureaus, requesting them to quickly dispatch national ships to Fujian to transport goods and urging them to sign contracts for transporting fruits to prevent foreign ships from taking the opportunity to seize this business.</p>
<h3>Japanese Shipwrecked in Shantou</h3>
<p>The "Ryujin Maru" of the Japanese Ueda Steamship Company, loaded with a large amount of cargo from Dalian Bay for Shantou and other places, ran aground at 9 PM on the 4th while sailing to the waters off Fuzhou, near the port of Shantou. The captain could not free the ship, and the bottom of the ship was pierced by hidden reefs, causing seawater to rush into the cabins. The captain sent a wireless "US" signal for help, which was received by the British aircraft carrier "Hermes," which immediately rushed to the rescue. Yesterday afternoon, a follow-up telegram was received stating that all the crew members and sailors had been rescued and taken to Hong Kong by the British warship. The ship has not yet sunk, and there are concerns about pirates looting it. The Japanese destroyer "Nashi," stationed in Shantou, has sailed to protect it.</p>
<h3>The Petition of the Coal and Mining Representatives</h3>
<p>Conditional Acceptance</p>
<p>The Shanghai coal merchants' movement to resist the sale of Japanese coal and strive for national coal was unexpectedly hit hard by the Jiaoji Railway's increase in freight rates. For the sake of society, the mine owners had no choice but to make a legitimate appeal. Therefore, on October 29, they publicly elected Lu Qisheng and Pan Yisan as representatives, together with Yang Yuan and Li Zumo, representatives of the Shandong Zibo Futan Mining and Coal Industry Association, to go to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Railways. At 10 AM on the 30th, they arrived at the Ministry of Railways, where Section Chief Xiao of the Business Section received them. First, the four representatives stated the purpose of their petition, requesting the cancellation of the Jiaoji Railway's price increase. Then, Section Chief Xiao had the following conversation with the representatives: (1) Section Chief Xiao said that the freight rate increase by the Jiaoji Railway was very small and would definitely not affect the price of coal. The four representatives replied, "Since the Ministry recognizes that the price increase is very small, it should not be made during this time of national crisis. Now the people of the whole country are angry at Japan's aggression, leading to economic severance with Japan. In this situation, it is necessary to promote domestically produced goods. If Japanese coal is boycotted and national coal is not used to support it, there will inevitably be a coal shortage, which will have a profound impact on social stability. At this time, measures should be taken to provide relief in a way that is as thorough as possible. However, the Ministry, without prior notice, suddenly proposed a price increase at this time, which is more harmful than beneficial and will only cause unrest among the people." (2) Section Chief Xiao said that the coal merchants' opposition was for their own selfish interests. The four representatives replied, "The Jiaoji Railway's price increase can be passed on to consumers by the coal merchants. As the saying goes, 'As the water rises, so does the boat.' The petition to the Ministry to withdraw the order is to prevent the water from rising, and the boat will naturally not be high. If the price of coal is low, the burden on consumers will naturally be light. The coal merchants' actions are actually to maintain social stability. What selfish interests are there?" (3) Section Chief Xiao said that the price of gold is high, and the freight rate must be increased. The four representatives replied, "The issue of high gold prices has been around for more than a year, and now it has fallen from over 800 taels to below 700 taels. If the high price of gold is used as a reason for increasing prices at this time, it is somewhat lacking. When the price of gold was at 800 taels, there was no mention of a price increase. Even in May of this year, freight rates were exempted during the off-season. The exemption during the off-season means that there must be an increase during the peak season. It is clear that the Ministry's price increase is not due to the high price of gold but is related to the peak and off-season business. Furthermore, as Section Chief Xiao said ('Exports of local products from Jiaoji are very strong after the autumn harvest, and the price of coal must be high due to the coal shortage in Shanghai'), it is taking advantage of this opportunity to increase prices. However, it is not known that the coal merchants, for the sake of saving the country, have limited the price of coal to be no higher than the average price before the boycott of Japanese coal, and have already presented it to government agencies for verification and filing. The Jiaoji Railway's viewpoint on the price increase is not as far-sighted as that of the coal merchants." (4) Section Chief Xiao said, "The freight rates on the light railways in Boshan are very high. Why don't the coal merchants object?" The four representatives replied, "The light railways have been built and operating for seven years and have not increased freight rates. If the Ministry believes that the higher freight rates on the light railways affect the price of coal, it is truly the Ministry's responsibility to ensure the convenience of national transportation. The power to improve belongs to the Ministry. It is difficult to explain why the Ministry is now blaming the merchants." (5) Section Chief Xiao said, "Qingdao has over 200,000 tons of coal in storage. Why don't you immediately ship it? The coal merchants only say that the price increase will lead to a coal shortage." The four representatives replied, "The amount of coal in storage in Qingdao is only 70,000 to 80,000 tons. The coal merchants are reluctant to hire Japanese ships, so the shipment is delayed. They are currently discussing with state-owned shipping companies to arrange for ships to transport it. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have repeatedly discussed this issue, and the progress has been reported in the newspapers. The coal merchants are trying to find ways to move the coal stored at all coastal ports. This kind of question from the Ministry is irrelevant." (6) Section Chief Xiao said, "The dock fees in Qingdao have increased sharply. Why do the coal merchants remain silent?" The four representatives replied, "The increased dock fees in Qingdao are the result of merchants voluntarily proposing to build another dock. The funds will be managed by the merchants, which is different from the Jiaoji Railway's price increase. The Ministry's excuse is based on a misunderstanding of the facts." (7) Section Chief Xiao said that the coal merchants are objecting to the price increase by the Jiaoji Railway but are selling coal to the Jiaoji Railway at a low price. The four representatives replied, "If the Jiaoji Railway believes that the coal merchants' prices are not low, it has the right to decide whether or not to purchase it. The coal merchants have no way to force them. Moreover, there are many coal mines in the Jiaoji area, and the competition is fierce. They are afraid of falling behind in the bidding and would never raise prices to cut off their own opportunities. This cannot be used as a reason for the price increase." (8) Section Chief Xiao said that the Jiaoji Railway's price increase had been ordered by the Ministry long ago and did not start today. The four representatives replied, "The Jiaoji Railway had long been ordered by the Ministry, but during the off-season, the Ministry had already complied with public opinion and stopped the price increase. How is the current situation in China compared to May or June? At a time when the country is facing disaster and there is no time to spare, how can we be lenient during the off-season but not be flexible during the national crisis?" After two hours of questions and answers, Section Chief Xiao stood up and said that he would visit Minister Lian in the afternoon to seek a solution. The four representatives then returned to their hostel. At 1:30 PM, the four representatives went to the Ministry of Railways again, where Guan Genglin, the Director of the Business Department, and Xu Chuanyin, the Assistant Director, received them. First, the four representatives stated the purpose of their petition, requesting the withdrawal of the Jiaoji Railway's price increase, and then they questioned each other. As a result, Director Guan and Assistant Director Xu agreed to the four representatives' request but proposed an exchange agreement: (1) Coal produced from mines along the Jiaoji Railway must not be sold to a certain country; (2) Coal mine owners must not take the opportunity to raise prices; (3) Coal mine owners must supply coal for railway use at a low price. The four representatives immediately expressed their acceptance of the proposed conditions. At the same time, Guan and Xu agreed to telegraph the Jiaoji Railway to temporarily cancel the price increase and then revise a fair freight rate. The representatives were satisfied and left, and then returned to their respective destinations.</p>

<h3>Daxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory Reports Closure</h3>
<p>Using Exhaustion of Fine Yarn Raw Materials as an Excuse</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Orders Maintenance of the Status Quo</p>
<p>The shareholders of the Daxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Shanghai are still financially sound. Recently, using the exhaustion of fine yarn raw materials as an excuse, they reported to the Social Affairs Bureau that they would announce the complete closure of the factory on the 19th of this month and declare the immediate dismissal of all workers in accordance with Article 29 of the Factory Law. Due to the workers' livelihoods, they specially submitted a request to the two Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to order the factory to operate as usual. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has approved the order for the factory to maintain the status quo and take care of the workers' livelihoods. There are ways to obtain raw materials, including domestically produced fine yarn and British yarn. At the same time, the factory workers were ordered to strictly maintain order and not to cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory Resumes Work</h3>
<p>Staff Member Ye Kequan Temporarily Suspended from Entering the Factory</p>
<p>Waiting for the Handling of Party and Government Organs</p>
<p>After all the workers at the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, went on strike, Li Weixiong of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Guilin of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Inspector Xu of the Sixth District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau repeatedly persuaded the factory to agree that, to avoid expanding the dispute, Ye Qiukuan, the general manager of the cloth department, would be temporarily suspended from entering the factory. All 600 workers in the cloth, yarn, and thread departments resumed work as usual the night before. Yesterday morning at 8 AM, a misunderstanding arose due to the resumption of work notice from the Third District Dyeing and Weaving Union. A small number of female workers in the cloth department who were not members of the union demanded that Ye Qiukuan be reinstated. After the factory manager explained the situation, they were reassured and continued to work. Members of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters returned to the factory at 10 AM to coordinate and mediate, and the labor and management agreed to the following solutions: (1) The workers will continue to work as usual; (2) Staff member Ye Qiukuan will be temporarily suspended from entering the factory to avoid misunderstandings and will wait for the party and government organs to handle the matter according to law.</p>

<h3>Ai Jianming Borrows More Than 800,000</h3>
<p>All in the Name of Yifengxiang Silk Shop</p>
<p>Unable to Repay, He Avoids Meeting</p>
<p>Shareholders Implicated and Sued in Court</p>
<p>Judge Agrees to Issue Arrest Warrant for Investigation</p>
<p>Ai Jianming, residing at No. 216 Ningbo Road in Zhenyuxiang and Hengchang Silk Shop, has recently been sued by Xu Lingyun, Chen Yizhen, and others in the Special District Court through lawyer Lu Shaozong for violating his duties and seeking illegal gains, requesting legal punishment. The lawsuit states that the plaintiffs jointly operated the Yifengxiang Silk Shop, and the defendant was also one of the shareholders. The defendant was publicly elected as the manager of the shop. The scope of business of Yifengxiang and the limits of the manager's authority were strictly defined. The defendant, as the manager, should abide by the rules and regulations and be careful in handling matters to gain the trust of the public. Unexpectedly, the defendant was insidious and violated the trust. Because the Dingyuan Silk Factory opened by his close friends Zhang Hesheng and Huang Qianchen was heavily in debt and had difficulty with cash flow, he colluded with various money houses to borrow more than 800,000 taels in the name of Yifengxiang and privately transferred the loans to Dingyuan, totaling more than 770,000 taels. Other indebted households are not included, causing the foundation of Yifengxiang to be shaken and the business to be greatly affected. The defendant, knowing that it would be impossible to repay the debt when it was due at the end of October, entrusted lawyer Chen Wenzhao to declare his personal liquidation on October 9, disregarding Yifengxiang. He has been avoiding meeting for many days, obviously feigning weakness and shirking responsibility. The plaintiffs have been checking the accounts for days and found that not only did he violate his duties, but the circumstances were also bizarre. After checking the capital and deducting the value of the inventory, the actual external debt is more than 600,000 taels, all borrowed from money houses and banks by Sun Zhonglu, the accountant of Hengchang Silk Shop, which was set up by the defendant himself. The clues are very suspicious. In summary, the defendant has indeed committed the crime of Article 366 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, it is requested that he be severely punished according to the law in order to reveal the truth. On the 4th of this month, Judge Feng Shide heard the case in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff stated as above, and Hua constable No. 1281, Jin Wanxiong, stated that the summons was delivered to the defendant's residence, but it was said that there was no such person and no one could be found anywhere else. Therefore, it was impossible to deliver the summons. The court then issued a warrant and changed the date to the afternoon of the 11th to retry the case after the defendant was arrested.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Renting a Wife</h3>
<p>Zhang Shihai Rents a Wife to Have a Son</p>
<p>Now Accused of Deception and Abuse</p>
<p>Zhang Shihai, a Ningbo native residing at No. 815 Yongcheng Lane, Broadway Road, Hongkou, has recently been sued by Yao Cuidi, a woman from the same hometown, in the First District Court through lawyers He Sui and Yao Wenshou for deception, abuse, and requesting the cancellation of an illegal contract. Zhang is nearly fifty years old and has no children. According to Ningbo custom, anyone without children can rent a wife from a third party and give her a corresponding price, stipulating a term. Any son born during the term can be inherited by the lessee. After the term expires, they will go their separate ways and not communicate with each other. In April of last year, Zhang Jinshui, Ma Chenshi, Wang Shishi, and others introduced Yao Cuidi, whose former husband was addicted to gambling and was poor, and was willing to rent his wife to Zhang as a matchmaker. Zhang then rented her for 200 yuan for a term of ten years. Unexpectedly, Yao Cuidi left and did not return on September 1 of this year and sued Zhang in court. The main points of her lawsuit are: After her divorce from her former husband who was addicted to gambling, Zhang Jinshui and others came last year as matchmakers, saying that Zhang Shihai had no children but was wealthy and wanted to marry the plaintiff as his wife. Her father, Yao Anfu, agreed and decided on a betrothal gift of 200 yuan. On April 27 of the lunar calendar last year, a banquet was held at the Yipinxian Hotel, and Ma Chenshi and Wang Shishi took the plaintiff to the hotel. Zhang Jinshui said, "After I write the marriage certificate, please ask the officiant to sign it." At that time, the plaintiff's father had important matters to attend to, so he first signed the unsigned marriage certificate and left. After Zhang Jinshui wrote it, he ordered the plaintiff to sign a cross under her name. After the guests dispersed, the couple lived together. Within a few days, the defendant saw that the plaintiff's clothes trunk contained 1,000 yuan in cash and falsely claimed to keep it in the bank. He listened to her and took it away and wrote a receipt for Zhang Shiji Lacquer Workshop. Unexpectedly, the defendant treated her differently afterwards and claimed that it was a lease and often provoked abuse. On the morning of September 2, she was driven out. Therefore, she was forced to file a lawsuit requesting the cancellation of the illegal contract, ordering the defendant to return 1,000 yuan in savings and compensate for damages of 10,000 yuan. The case was opened for trial yesterday by Judge Guo Shouyi in the Seventh Civil Court. First, the plaintiff stated that when she was married, she was told she was to be a stepmother and initially lived at No. 812 Yongcheng South, with food delivered from No. 815 in the same neighborhood. Later, the defendant discovered 1,000 yuan in cash in her trunk and took it away on June 16 of last year for safekeeping, as evidenced by the receipt presented to the court. After that, he called her a rented wife, which led to quarrels and eventually being forced to leave. Now she is still willing to live with him, but he must return 1,000 yuan and give her 10,000 yuan as security. Next, the defendant's attorney, Ma Junshuo, stated that the defendant was a lacquer merchant who wanted to marry a woman to have children because he had no heir. Zhang Jinshui and Wang Shishi came and said that Yao Cuidi's husband was extremely poor and planned to rent his wife to Zhang according to Ningbo customs. They repeatedly persuaded him, saying that they only wanted to survive and did not care about anything else. He could not refuse, so he agreed. He gave 200 yuan in cash as rent for a term of ten years and made clothes and ornaments for her. Unexpectedly, she recently acted absurdly and behaved irregularly and secretly took the gold bracelets and other jewelry that he had lent to his wife for her to wear in September and secretly fled. He was about to report to the police to arrest her, but before long, he received a letter from lawyer He Sui requesting the cancellation of the contract (according to Ningbo customs, the contract for renting a wife is called "Dianhun") and requesting the return of 1,000 yuan. Observing this situation, it is clear that Yao Cuidi coveted money and was acting in collusion with Ma Chenshi and Wang Shishi to run a white pigeon scheme. In addition to having no reason to accept Yao Cuidi's request, he felt that if he kept the woman, there would be endless troubles. Therefore, he strongly supports the cancellation of the contract and must countersue her for absconding with valuables. Judge Guo verified the statements and ordered the summons of relevant persons Ma Chenshi and Wang Shishi to appear in court and ordered lawyer Ma Junshuo to quickly supplement the counterclaim and reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3>Record of Wu Tianbao's Interrogation</h3>
<p>Formerly Served in the Military</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case Was Carried Out by Subordinates</p>
<p>The notorious bandit Wu Tianbao of Fenghua, who repeatedly committed kidnapping and robbery cases in Hangzhou, Shaoxing and other places, fled to Shanghai with his family and hid in No. 1, Bei Di Fang, Bei Di Ao Road, French Concession. The Security Department of Zhejiang Provincial Government discovered this and dispatched Detective Chief Jiang Yunzhong, along with informant Lou Zirui, to Shanghai on the 24th of last month to meet with the French Concession Police Detective Bao. When Wu realized he was being surrounded, he opened fire and resisted arrest, escaping from the roof. He shot and killed Zhejiang Detective Chief Jiang Yunzhong and seriously wounded French Concession Police Detective Ni Jinrong and Police Assistant Wang Dingyu. Later, Police Detective Zhao Chunsheng arrested Wu's wife, Wang, his concubine, Yang, and his wife's younger sister, Wang Xiaohui, and sent them to the police station. The Second Special Court ordered them to be held for further interrogation on the 9th. Wu, who was still at large, hired a lawyer to try to exonerate his wife and concubine. However, Wu's wife, Wang, who was addicted to opium, fell ill in custody and was sent to Guang Hospital, but died before she could be treated. The court confirmed her death and the body was taken care of by the court. Now, the Special Agency Detective Inspector of the French Concession Police, Jin Jiulin, discovered that Wu was hiding at No. 9, Taihe Li, Bai'erbu Road, the night before. That night, he led the on-duty detectives, including Zheng Tan Qin Youyu and Zhou Buguang, to arrest Wu. Also arrested were the two landlords, Sun Naitai (49 years old), Sun Jiying (28 years old), and Zheng Deshi (51 years old or older), all from Ninghai.</p>
<p>A General Headquarters Counselor's symbol was found in Sun Naitai's house (Sun was formerly a regimental commander). A Browning pistol with nine bullets (with the serial number 135090 printed on it, wrapped in newspaper) was found on the roof of No. 18, Gansidong Road. They were taken to the police station for investigation. The details have been reported yesterday. Yesterday morning at 11:00, the police sent Wu and the other four to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Luo Renji, together with Prosecutor Ding Shikui, took the stand for interrogation. The judge first asked the defendants their names, ages, and origins. Then, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi stood up to state the case, saying that defendant Wu Tianbao had committed serious kidnapping cases in Hangzhou and had also committed the crime of opening fire and resisting arrest and murder in the concession. The police are still investigating and request a postponement for further interrogation on the 9th. Then, Deputy Detective Qian Yumin reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants, claiming that at 4:00 PM yesterday, a tip-off was received that Wu Tianbao was hiding at No. 9, Taihe Li, Bai'erbu Road. The Inspector led the on-duty detectives to wait near Taihe Li. At 8:30 PM, Wu and two others were seen entering the alley into No. 9, and they were immediately arrested. A pistol and nine bullets were found on the roof of No. 18, Gansidong Road, and the defendant admitted that it was the gun used to resist arrest. The gun and bullets were presented as evidence. The judge asked Wu, "Where do you live?" Wu replied, "I lived at No. 1, Bei Di Fang. After the incident, I lived in a hotel." (Question) "Did you open fire at No. Bei Di Fang to resist arrest on the morning of the 24th of last month?" (Answer) "I opened fire, but I don't remember how many times." (Question) "Did you fire down from upstairs?" (Answer) "They had already reached upstairs when I opened fire." (Question) "Did you escape from the roof?" (Answer) "I escaped down the stairs." (Question) "Did you go to Taihe Li immediately after escaping?" (Answer) "Sun Naitai lives in Taihe Li. My wife's younger sister was arrested, and I wanted to ask Commander Sun (Naitai) for help, so I went there." (Question) "Who is Wu Wang?" (Answer) "My wife." (Question) "Who is Wu Yang?" (Answer) "I met her in the countryside before coming to Shanghai, and we have been living together for three or four years." (Question) "Who is Wang Xiaohui?" (Answer) "She is my wife's younger sister. She came to visit her sister because she was sick." (Question) "Have you committed any crimes in Hangzhou?" (Answer) "I have never been to Hangzhou and have not committed any crimes." (Question) "Have you committed kidnapping cases in Zhejiang?" (Answer) "My subordinates used my name without my knowledge." (Question) "Have you always been involved in kidnapping?" (Answer) "I was in the military, I did it before joining the military." (Question) "Where did you get the pistol?" (Answer) "It was left over from the military." At this point, it was close to noon. Judge Luo ordered the defendants to be detained and postponed the interrogation to the 9th.</p>
<h3>Xiong Xiling Will Come to Shanghai to Discuss Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>A reporter from Xinshi News Agency interviewed an important official of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee yesterday. According to him, the committee received a telegram from Xiong Xiling from Peiping yesterday, saying, "The winter relief is imminent, and the disaster victims are crying out for food, which is extremely miserable. I plan to take the Jingping train south from Peiping on the morning of the 4th and arrive in Nanjing on the evening of the 5th. I plan to stay in Nanjing for one night, and on the morning of the 6th, I will take the train to Shanghai to discuss all the winter and spring relief measures with Chairman Zhu (Qinglan)." It is also said that Xiong plans to stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to Peiping to carry out the relief work according to the results of the discussion.</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Associations of Various Provinces to Hold a Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Emergency Flood Relief in Various Provinces began preparing for emergency winter relief, there have been many urgent matters to be carried out. It is specifically scheduled to hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss them. The announcement issued by the association yesterday is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, this association has decided to hold the 15th standing committee meeting at 4:00 PM on the 6th of this month (Friday). Please attend on time."</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Fellow Villagers Association Asks for Continued Shelter for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Please forward to all newspaper offices from Shenbao: An urgent telegram from the Social Affairs Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the First and Second Disaster Relief Shelters: "Regarding the report that the city's shelters are sending disaster victims back to Jiangbei, a telegram was sent to the Jiangbei Yizhen Association requesting them to stop sending them back and continue to provide shelter. Reading the report on the 4th, the reason for sending the disaster victims back is mainly because sheltering is a measure to save the dying, not the poor, and the flood in Jiangbei has receded, so they are being sent back to receive winter relief and engage in spring plowing. The intention is not good, and it does not conform to the facts. To elaborate further, the largest breach in Gaoyou is the Party Army Building, which has not yet been closed. The accumulated water in various places in Yundong is deep and the source is endless. Therefore, many disaster victims in the rural areas are still clinging to their land and waiting for death, staying on the embankments and high ground, crying out from hunger and cold. The shacks that have been washed away everywhere cannot be repaired, and they have no strength. Moreover, the time for sowing wheat has passed, and there is no guarantee of spring plowing. How can they prepare? There are at least 300,000 disaster victims in our county, and less than 1-2% of them are being sheltered in Shanghai, and less than 2-3% of them are receiving relief in their hometowns. The charitable organizations stationed in the post office to provide relief often find themselves unable to do so, and recently, starvation deaths have been heard of daily in areas that have not received emergency relief. How the winter relief is being handled can be seen from this. They are too busy to divide the food for immigration, but those who have come to Shanghai to escape death are being driven back to their homes where they have no home and no food, either filling the ditches or becoming bandits. The area between Jiangbei and Jiangsu is chaotic and will not be a blessing for Shanghai. Is this in line with your original intention of saving the dying? You must know that the disaster victims of today are not all lazy people. The winter relief of today is not enough to be generous. The shelters everywhere are not all trying to transport people to Shanghai. They are forced to do so. If you can conduct an on-the-spot investigation and clearly understand the truth, we urgently request you to review and approve it, quickly order the cessation of repatriation and continue to provide shelter. If there are special difficulties, please transfer the matter to the Shanghai charitable organizations for reception and handling. Saving a few people will save many lives. We are waiting for orders in extreme urgency." We hope that your newspaper will advocate for saving lives, the merit of which is not small. Chairman and members of the Shanghai Gaoyou Fellow Villagers Association, Wang Hongzao, etc."</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association's Relief Donation to End</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association's relief effort for the flood disaster in various provinces has obtained 200 donation registers from the Emergency Relief Association and distributed them to enthusiastic members to raise funds. The association has sent several batches of relief funds directly to the Emergency Relief Association, totaling several thousand yuan, and the funds raised by the members indirectly sent have also amounted to four or five thousand yuan. Due to the imminent end of the fund-raising, the association yesterday issued letters to the members who had not yet returned the donation registers, requesting them to return the original donation registers and funds to the association within one week for finalization.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Tram to Sell Unified Fare Tickets</h3>
<p>Guowenshe News Agency reports that the trams and trolleybuses running on various routes in the Shanghai Public Concession will soon sell unified fare tickets in accordance with the fare system of the public buses. The company plans to issue unified fare tickets for the trams on routes 1 to 11 (Route 1 runs between Yangjingbang and Tilanqiao, and Route 11 runs from Bazilu to Yangjingbang) and trolleybuses on routes 14, 15, 16, 19, and 20. The fare for all third-class tickets will be 8 cents (8 copper coins), and the fare for first-class tickets will be 13 cents, regardless of the distance. This will soon be implemented. It is reported that since the public buses switched to selling unified tickets, the daily revenue of the trams and trolleybuses on various routes in the Public Concession has decreased from 13,000-14,000 yuan to around 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Sleeper Cars on the Jinghu Railway Began Selling Tickets Yesterday</h3>
<p>Two sleeper cars rented by the Jinghu Railway from the International Sleeping Car and European Express Company have now been transported to Shanghai from the Zhongdong, Beining, and Jinpu railways. One sleeper car was added to the night train No. 2035 last night and began service. Tickets were sold last night. Since the cars were not sold to the railway but were a cooperative venture, the railway only collects the first-class ticket price, and the sleeper ticket income goes to the branch company. The current sleeper ticket price is fixed at 6.90 yuan per person, regardless of the distance, whether it is an upper or lower berth. Passengers can contact the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road or the International Sleeping Car Company at No. 10, Zengyi Lane, Jielu, to reserve berths.</p>

<h3>Swindling Money by Selling Diamonds for a Trip to Nanjing</h3>
<p>He Zhicheng Claims He Was Confused for a Moment</p>
<p>Little Left of the 2,800 Yuan</p>
<p>On the morning of October 7, a broker named Sankou (Japanese) and He Zhicheng, a 21-year-old from Suzhou, obtained four pieces of diamond from Lilishoushi Jewellery Store at No. 3, Wusong Road, worth more than 5,400 yuan. They took them to the Zhang residence at No. 282, Xiafei Lane, to sell. He went inside and did not come out after an hour. Sankou went to the defendant's house to look for him, but could not find him. He reported the situation to the manager of the store, who reported it to the Hongkou Police, who arrested him. A few days ago, the police received a report that He Zhicheng had fled to a hospital in Suzhou. The detective head dispatched Huatan Zexing to the address and arrested He. A notebook and 90 yuan in cash were found on him. He was taken to Shanghai for detention and was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and presented the notebook and cash for inspection, requesting a postponement. Zhou Chunbo, a native of Anhui and a shareholder and manager of the store, testified that he did not know He and that the Japanese Sankou was a shop employee. He learned that Sankou was a jewelry broker and gave the diamonds to Qian to be given to the Japanese for sale. The purchase cost of these diamonds was 4,300 yuan. The Japanese stated that he had been a jewelry broker for many years and had known the defendant for two years. He also briefly described the situation. He Zhicheng confessed that he had been a translator for the Japanese and is now a jewelry broker. He has known the Japanese for many years. That morning, he obtained four pieces of diamond and went to the Zhang mansion at No. 282, Xiafei Lane, to sell them. However, the owner was not there. At that time, the Japanese Sankou was waiting in the Dongyang Garden. He was confused for a moment and secretly sold the diamonds to Tianchengxiang Jewellery Store in the Chinese-controlled area of Xinbeimen for 2,800 yuan in cash. He gave 400 yuan to his friend to help him move and hide, and used the money as a reward. He took the train to the capital that morning and stayed at the Datong Hotel for about half a month, depositing 800 yuan in the Shanghai Bank there. The rest of the money was used to redeem and spend. Later, he returned to his hometown. Judge Shen Xunrong verified the confession and ordered him to be detained for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Abattoir Director Approved to be Sent to Taicang</h3>
<p>Falsified Documents and Embezzled Large Sums of Money</p>
<p>Yang Gang, director of the Taicang County Abattoir, alias Tixian, from Haimen, was suspected of falsifying documents and embezzling 2,545 yuan in abattoir taxes. He fled to Shanghai and was arrested by Ren Songlin, a member of the Taicang County Public Security Bureau's detective team, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Xinzha Police Station, at a lawyer's office at No. 570, Baker Road, on the 30th of last month. He was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the interrogation at the Second Criminal Court. The Taicang County Government sent officials to court to apply for his transfer and presented official documents and all evidence regarding Yang Gang. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang did not object to the transfer. Yang's lawyer objected to the transfer. Judge Feng approved Yang Gang's transfer to the Taicang County Government.</p>
<h3>Ren Zhennan's Wife Requests Separation</h3>
<p>Ren Refuses to Provide a Penny</p>
<p>She Now Works as a Seamstress to Make a Living</p>
<p>Ren Jiangshi (also known as Jiang Xingjuan), the wife of former lawyer Ren Zhennan, filed a criminal complaint with the District Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Ren of sodomy and abuse. Ren avoided appearing in court. After someone secretly reported Ren's whereabouts, the court sent police to arrest Ren and detain him. The case was prosecuted in the Criminal Court and scheduled for public trial today, the 6th. However, Jiang Xingjuan also hired lawyer Tao Jiachun to apply to the court's mediation office for separation and to request alimony. Because the two mediations failed, she formally filed a petition requesting the court to grant her separation and an alimony of 120 yuan per month. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Bingxin specially opened the Ninth Court for interrogation. The plaintiff Jiang Dujuan and lawyer Tao arrived in court. The defendant Ren Zhennan was brought in from the detention center. The judge first asked the plaintiff her age, address, and place of residence. Jiang Xingjuan said she was 21 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at her mother's home at No. 11, Dafang Lane, Xiaobeimen. The judge then asked the defendant Ren Zhennan his age and origin. Ren Zhennan said he was 23 years old, from Guangdong, and was a former lawyer. (Judge asked) "Why does the plaintiff want to separate?" (Answer) "He abused me and tried to sodomize me, so I want to separate and also want alimony of 120 yuan per month." (Question) "Who arranged your marriage?" (Answer) "My mother. We got married on May 10th this year. My mother's family is very poor. My mother used to comb hair for a living, but now she washes clothes. I now work to make a living." (Question) "Defendant, what do you mean?" Ren (Answer) "I did not abuse her, and the accusation of sodomy is completely fabricated. The criminal case has not yet been decided. As for the separation, she is now living at her mother's house and is already separated. As for the monthly alimony, I am now detained and have no income, so I cannot afford it." The judge said, "How about a small allowance?" Ren (Answer) "I really have no money." The judge asked the plaintiff again, "Can you ask for less money or no money?" Jiang replied, "If I have work to do, I only earn 20 cents a day. If he mends his ways, I still hope to live with him." (Question) "120 yuan a month is not necessary." (Answer) "The rent alone is more than 30 yuan." (Question) "Did you report to the police when you left?" (Answer) "Because he beat me, I reported it to the Chenxiangge Police Station (the First Precinct of the Second District)." (Question) "How about 20 yuan a month?" (Answer) "His family is very rich, and his father runs the Yian Printing House." At this point, lawyer Tao Jiachun stood up and said, "Our firm originally did not accept this case because we saw that Jiang Xingjuan and her mother were very miserable, so I accepted it. However, the announcements of this case in the newspapers are not only bad for Ren Zhennan personally, but also for the legal profession. Therefore, our firm advocated for a reconciliation, but we did not know Ren. Later, we recalled that Ren had hired lawyers Jin Yu and Xue Jiaqi to defend him in another case. According to lawyer Xue, the matter has reached this point and there is no possibility of mediation. Now the plaintiff is working in the Huadong Umbrella Factory and her life is extremely difficult. Although she is now requesting separation, she still hopes to reunite in the future. The defendant claims that he has no money to give the plaintiff for living expenses, so there should be a practical solution." The judge then persuaded the defendant to reduce the allowance to 30 yuan per month. Ren (Answer) "Alright. She has already left. I am now detained, and she can return to my house." Lawyer Tao said, "Ren's father does not consider the defendant his son or the plaintiff his daughter-in-law, so how can she live in peace?" Ren immediately said to lawyer Tao, "Please refrain from making such remarks. What evidence do you have that my father does not consider me his son?" Lawyer Tao replied that this statement came from the plaintiff and could be asked to the plaintiff. The judge then announced the postponement of the interrogation. Ren was taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>American Sailor Abuses Cantonese Prostitute</h3>
<p>Although Redeemed, She Was Often Whipped</p>
<p>The Prostitute Escaped and Was Sent to the Jiliang Institute for Care</p>
<p>Ye Shaofen, a Cantonese woman of 29 with a pleasing appearance, was abducted from her hometown and brought to Shanghai last February. She was forced to work as a prostitute in a Cantonese brothel on Beijiangxi Road, with a redemption price of 350 yuan and a one-year term. From then on, Ye lived a life of flesh and blood in the brothel until the term was about to expire. Last month, an American sailor named John J. visited the brothel and fell in love with Ye at first sight. He paid for her redemption and rented a house to live with her. However, John was very violent and often whipped her. The day before yesterday, in the afternoon and evening, he used a leather belt to beat Ye severely for no reason, causing her unbearable pain. She took the opportunity to escape at 11:00 PM and sought help from the Hongkou Police Station. Cantonese detective Feng Qi questioned her and temporarily sent her to the Jiliang Institute. Yesterday morning, the institute sent Ye to the First Special Court's Prohibited Court. Ye was wearing Western clothes, crying and covering her face. Judge Shen Shan inquired about Ye and Feng. He ordered Ye Shaofen to be sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. After the order, Judge Shen returned to the judge's rest room and talked to Ye standing at the door for about five minutes before the Chinese and Western female directors of the Jiliang Institute took the woman away.</p>
<h3>A Ridiculous Scam</h3>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang's Condition Worsens?</p>
<p>Baking Soda Worth Sixteen Yuan</p>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang and Yuxiang, the sons of the deceased Hua Tong wharf head Zhang Linsheng, were shot and assassinated by thugs at No. 112, Huayuanshi Bridge, Pudong. Yuxiang died immediately, and Guoxiang was sent to the hospital for treatment and was not in danger of death. Guoxiang identified the murderer as Zhang Qingxiang (his third younger brother), his stepmother Zhang Zhang, and Zhang Quansheng (Guoxiang's maternal uncle). The Third District arrested them and sent them to the District Court for detention pending further interrogation after Guoxiang recovered from his injuries. Yesterday morning at 11:00, a well-dressed young man suddenly came to Guoxiang's house (No. 7, Huayuanshi Bridge, 35 Yamen). The young man claimed to be a staff member of the Baolong Hospital and reported to Guoxiang's wife that Guoxiang's condition had worsened and that a special medicinal powder was needed to save him. He had already purchased it for 16 yuan and had paid for it, but it needed to be guaranteed and stamped before he could give it to him. He asked her to return the money first. Zhang's wife gave him 16 yuan as requested and took the receipt to find a guarantor. When she returned home after completing the procedure, the young man had disappeared. Zhang's wife took the medicine to the hospital for inspection and found that it was baking soda bought from a French pharmacy worth less than one yuan. Social scams are becoming more and more bizarre.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cotton Mills to Close</h3>
<p>Results After Continued Meetings</p>
<p>Damei Evening News reports that the Japan Cotton Spinners' Association in China, an organization of Japanese cotton mills in China, decided to close down after continued meetings yesterday in light of the serious anti-Japanese situation. However, the exact date of closure for each factory has not yet been decided. The association's members in this city include Dakang, Daxing, Rihua, Gongren, Neiwai, Shanghai Textile, Yufeng, and Donghua factories. Currently, due to the impact of the boycott of Japanese goods, their products have no sales and it is difficult to continue operating. Therefore, they have decided to close down. If there are drastic changes in the situation in the future, they will all be closed down. In addition, the Japanese cotton mills in Qingdao, Hankou, and the three northeastern provinces are all members of the association. It is reported that six factories in Qingdao are also facing closure due to the boycott of Japanese goods.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee Continues to Work as Usual</h3>
<p>The Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union on Qiujiang Road in this city was sealed up by the District Court due to the Seamen's Union case. The Garrison Command sent personnel to the association yesterday to inquire about the truth. The association, fearing misunderstandings from all walks of life, sent telegrams to the party headquarters and organizations of various provinces and cities yesterday, saying, "On the morning of the 2nd of this month, bailiffs from the Shanghai District Court suddenly came to the association, claiming that the former China Seamen's Industrial Union owed rent and was ordered to seal the union's property. The association's staff informed them that the association was the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union, established on July 21 by order of the Central Government, and was not related to the former China Seamen's Industrial Union, so there was no debt relationship. Moreover, the association had not defaulted on rent since leasing the building. However, the bailiffs were aggressive and unreasonable and posted the Shanghai District Court seal on the door. The court's failure to verify the facts, the police's illegal abuse of power, and the impact on the association's future are of great concern. We urgently request the Central Executive Committee to forward this telegram to the National Government for thorough investigation and to request the court to immediately lift the seal and publish an explanation. All of the association's work will continue as usual. We fear that rumors will be spread and cause misunderstandings."</p>
<h3>Further Discussion of the Labor Dispute at China Merchants Electric Power Company</h3>
<p>Employee Attitudes Remain Firm</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: The labor dispute and work slowdown at the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Power Company was resolved through the vigorous mediation of the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau, leading to a full resumption of work. However, the company's manager, Lu Bohong, submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday, expressing objections to the agreed-upon terms. As a result, all employees were once again on edge yesterday. The following is a summary of various news items:</p>
<p>Employee Petition: Petition respectfully requesting that the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Power Company be immediately ordered to disburse the collectively agreed-upon additional subsidy for four months of this year to employees and to earnestly fulfill other agreements. On October 29th of this year, we were honored by your presence, along with Section Chief Xu Minxun of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters and Representative Zhang Shouchun of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, to convene representatives of both labor and management of the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Power Company to collectively agree that all employees' annual salary increases for this year would be paid by the company in full on the day after the employees resumed work for four months. On the afternoon of October 30th at 3 p.m., Bureau-appointed Section Member Guo Yongxi, along with Representative Xu of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters and Representative Zhang Shouchun of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, visited the China Merchants Electric Power Company's lighting office on Guohuo Road to convene a meeting with all company employees. They stated on the spot that Chief of the General Affairs Section Wu Quesheng had voluntarily resigned from his position in the company, and the company had approved his immediate departure. Employees should resume work immediately. Upon receiving this news, all employees rejoiced and immediately resumed work. However, today, various newspapers published a document from Lu Bohong, manager of the China Merchants Electric Power Company, to your office, with absurd wording that completely contradicts the facts. He is shielding Wu Quesheng in many ways, even claiming that the collectively agreed-upon agreements have no legal or moral basis for the company to accept, clearly intending to overturn the already agreed-upon resolution in the hope of causing a major dispute. Upon reading this, all employees were outraged by Manager Lu's inconsistency and lack of integrity. The situation is tense, and a spark could ignite. Uncle Ping et al., seeing this situation, have no way to cope. We believe that the manager treats the company's major interests as trivial, prioritizing the maintenance of Wu Quesheng's individual position, who is destroying labor-management cooperation. His blatant disregard for public opinion is truly astonishing. Given the anxious state of all employees, Uncle Ping et al. are compelled to submit this document to your office for review and verification. We humbly request that the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Power Company be immediately ordered to disburse the collectively agreed-upon additional subsidy for four months of this year to employees and to earnestly fulfill all other agreed-upon agreements to appease public anger and eliminate hidden dangers. Otherwise, if other complications arise, the company should bear full responsibility for all consequences. As for Manager Lu's claim that the company lost 4,600 yuan due to the three-day work slowdown, we believe that this loss should be borne in full by Wu Quesheng, as the slowdown was entirely caused by him personally. This is stated in conjunction.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Order: After the employees resumed work, the Social Affairs Bureau initially received a petition from temporary representative Deng Shuping et al. requesting the company be ordered to disburse the subsidy. On November 3rd, the Bureau instructed the company to disburse it immediately and informed the employees of the reply. The original reply is as follows: All submitted documents have been read. The employees' request for an additional subsidy for four months was promised by the company representative during the joint persuasion by representatives of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau, along with this Bureau. You are hereby ordered to promptly verify and disburse it. As for the other matters mentioned in the submission, this Bureau has no record of them and should not be misunderstood.</p>
<h3>Joint Statement by Postal Workers' Union and Others</h3>
<p>Regarding the omission of notification letters for the discussion meeting</p>
<p>More than ten labor unions, including the Postal Workers' Union, initiated a discussion meeting for the city's labor circles the day before yesterday. However, notification letters were not sent to a few labor unions, preventing them from participating. A joint statement was issued, stating: Regarding the statement, our unions initiated a discussion meeting for all labor unions in the city on the first of this month. When sending out notification letters, we followed the list of labor unions in the city as listed in the work report of the Municipal Party Headquarters' People's Training Committee. As a result, labor unions such as the city's press circles, which were not listed in the list, were omitted from the mailing list. We sincerely regret this and hereby issue a formal apology. In the future, if any labor unions in the city have changes in address or other information, we hope they will promptly inform the Postal Workers' Union to avoid delays. This statement is issued in the hope of understanding and forgiveness. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Postal Employees' Union, Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, City Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, Sixth District Water and Electricity Industry Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Leye Occupational Union, City Sauce Industry Occupational Union, City Hat-Making Industry Union, City Dyeing Industry Union, First District Shipbuilding Union, City Toothbrush Industry Union, City Qin (stringed instrument) Industry Union, Steamboat Wood Industry Union, Silk Finishing Office, Fifth District Cotton Flannel Industry Union, Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, Ninth District Soap and Medicine Industry Union, First District Paper-Making Industry Union, Shanghai Hu Yong Steamboat Tea Room Union, Shanghai City Incense Industry Union, Ink-Making Industry Union, Leather-Making Industry Union.</p>
<h3>Efforts of the Southern Fujian Fellow-Countrymen Association to Reject Opium</h3>
<p>The Southern Fujian Fellow-Countrymen Association in Shanghai resolved to protest the fact that Fuzhou and Xiamen were involved in the transport of opium, and Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Xinghua, and Yongchun were forced to plant opium, which destroys the law. The protest telegrams have already been sent out, and the text is recorded as follows: (A) Telegram to the Fujian Provincial Government: To Yang, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government: Reports state that the military police in Fuzhou and Xiamen openly established institutions to transport opium, and local tyrants and stationed troops in Quanzhou, Yongchun, Zhangzhou, Xinghua, and other counties colluded with each other to force villagers to plant opium. The provincial government is not effectively cracking down on this. Such a practice is like drinking poison to quench thirst, leading to endless harm, which greatly violates Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. We request that you order the military and police chiefs in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Xinghua, and Yongchun to ban the transport and planting of opium to eliminate the scourge of opium. Our hometowns and villages may then have hope. This is an urgent telegram awaiting your reply. Southern Fujian Fellow-Countrymen Association respectfully. Jiang.

The provincial government claims to crack down on it but secretly protects and indulges it. This is like drinking poison to quench thirst, leading to endless harm. We request that your Party Headquarters follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to supervise lower-level party headquarters and various organizations to lead the people in thoroughly protesting and achieving the goal of banning the transport and planting of opium to eliminate the scourge of opium. Our hometowns and villages may then have hope. This is an urgent telegram of extreme importance. Southern Fujian Fellow-Countrymen Association respectfully. Jiang. (C) Telegram to the Fujian Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee and the Xiamen Opium Rejection Association: To the Fujian Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee and the Xiamen Opium Rejection Branch: Reports state that the military police in Fuzhou and Xiamen openly established institutions to transport opium, and local tyrants and stationed troops in Quanzhou, Yongchun, Zhangzhou, Xinghua, and other counties colluded with each other to force villagers to plant opium. The provincial government claims to prohibit it but secretly protects and indulges it. This is like drinking poison to quench thirst, leading to endless harm. Your association's continued protest fulfills its duty and is admirable. Please continue to strive to achieve the goal of banning the transport and planting of opium so that our hometowns and villages may have hope. Please telegraph us the situation at any time. Southern Fujian Fellow-Countrymen Association respectfully. Jiang.</p>
<h3>Planning to Build Seawall in Upper Baoshan, Nanhui, Jianghai</h3>
<p>Since the typhoon and torrential rains in mid-August this year, the seawalls along the Yangtze River and Wusongkou in Shanghai and Baoshan, Nanhui, and other counties were completely destroyed by floods. After the Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau and the Jiangsu Provincial Seawall Works Bureau rushed to repair them, they have been fully restored. It is now learned that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering that although these dikes have been restored to their original state, they can be maintained in normal times, but they are still afraid that they will not be able to withstand strong winds, heavy rains, and storm surges. Therefore, for the sake of permanent security, both parties have specially organized a Jiangnan Seawall Reconstruction Committee to plan to build a seawall resembling the Qiantang River seawall along the Yangtze River Estuary and Wusongkou in order to consolidate and last. It is expected that the project will be completely completed within three years. The seawall in the Shanghai Municipal Government's area is already under planning by the Public Works Bureau, which will cost about 2 million yuan. The Baoshan County and Nanhui County areas are also being planned separately.</p>

<h3>Achievements of the Domestic Raw Material Research Association</h3>
<p>Attention of the Sauce Industry</p>
<p>The sauce color used in our country's sauce industry has always been made from local soil (caramel). Since the invention of scientific sauce color by the Japanese, Chinese people have mostly used it. Our country has repeatedly had similar products, but the color, luster, taste, and various quality points are still unable to surpass imported products. Therefore, for more than ten years, although the price of Japanese sauce color has been twice that of domestic products, it is still difficult to prevent its popularity. Now it is clear that among the researchers of the Domestic Raw Material Research Association in Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, this port, a method for manufacturing products equivalent to those from the East has been invented. Sauce industry people who want to know its quality can obtain samples from the association for testing.</p>

<p>News from Mr. Cheng Suiting</p>
<p>(Advocating Cloth Clothing Association, Promoting Domestic Goods for Western Clothing, Promoting Patriotic Slogans)</p>
<p>The national crisis is at its height, and the whole country is boiling. Looking north to the three eastern provinces, there are no tears to cry. Whether we will be slaves or remain independent in the future depends on whether the people's will can be firmly determined. The reason why the Japanese bully us is that they first engage in economic activities and then engage in military occupation. The Japanese military force is cultivated by the Japanese economy, and those who cultivate the Japanese economy and make it prosperous are all caused by our love of Japanese goods and the failure to stop the leaking jar. Therefore, boycotting Japanese goods to prevent their economy from functioning is indeed a good way to get to the root of the problem. I will briefly state three points for my compatriots who boycott Japanese goods to choose from. (1) In the previous Reader Correspondence column, Mr. Jin Ye Qiu advocated the Cloth Clothing Association to cultivate vitality, which is an important task for saving the country and should not be easily relaxed. In the past, our country's men farmed and women weaved, so the land was used to its fullest extent and the people were prosperous. In recent times, people have become lazy and customs have become extravagant. Foreign goods take advantage of this and compete to show off. The livelihood of our Chinese people is suddenly cut off. Those who used to manufacture to supply people's needs are now turning to imports. If the people lose their jobs, the country will be in chaos. If the leaking jar is not stopped, the country will be poor. When the country is poor and in chaos, luxury will become even worse. When foreign insults become more and more serious, the government is blamed for not protecting our people. However, they do not deeply reflect on their daily emphasis on foreign goods, which is the gradual cause of insults. It is also sad. Therefore, respecting the actual and rejecting the fancy is indeed the first important meaning for those who speak about saving the country. (2) In recent years, Chinese people have loved to wear western clothing and short clothes. If we infer their intentions, they may not only emphasize singing and dancing, but may also be for the convenience of operation. However, most of the raw materials for tailoring are foreign goods, so the import of wool, serge, and billiard cloth has been increasing year by year. The annual consumption is hundreds of millions. I think that these materials can be replaced by domestic products, whether cloth or cloth, are all suitable. Not only can we recover our rights and interests, but we can also indirectly give full assistance to the domestic textile industry. Moreover, in recent years, our country's textile industry has been innovating various products day by day. In fact, it is only second to foreign goods. Therefore, why must the raw materials for western clothing be foreign goods, so that they will be called patriotic? I deeply hope that schools, organizations, and institutions will pay attention to this and do their best to promote it. (3) Since the violent Japanese have wreaked havoc, our compatriots have been resentful. For a time, slogans and paintings were everywhere, deeply affecting people's hearts and achieving great results. However, wind and rain make it difficult to guarantee permanence. I think that advertising boards should be set up in places such as the ferry docks and train stations, and they should be painted with excellent oil paint, which can last longer. In addition, the bowls, plates, cups, and chopsticks that are necessary for households have words and paintings such as scenery and poems. If the porcelain kiln can use this point to change the national salvation slogans and satirical paintings, the effect will be more broad and more people will make progress. Replace the middle hall that is hung in the home with a map. The couplets are also written with sentences of saving the country and wiping out shame, so that they are shocking to the eye and there will be no more criticism of five-minute heat.</p>
<p>News from Mr. Liu Shaoquan (Officials should also publicize)</p>
<p>In the face of the tense foreign troubles, the ruling authorities should search for all the facts of Japan's oppression of our country, print them into a special book, and distribute them to the governments of various counties for distribution to the people in various districts. According to the special book, everyone should be informed so that everyone can understand Japan's atrocities.</p>

<h3>Is Japan Overpopulated?</h3>
<p>— Feng Wu</p>
<p>The Japanese Empire's government and public, as a whole nation, are frantically clamoring about the scarcity of land and the overpopulation, but it is rather an exaggeration. However, "putting on airs" and "exaggerating claims" are consistent traditional thoughts of the Japanese. Based on geographical relations, the total area of Japan is 176,000 square miles, and Korea also has 143,12 square miles (Japanese square miles). Excluding Taiwan, Ryukyu, Penghu and other islands, there is also an area of 190,312. Assuming Japan has a population of 80 million, the average population per square mile is just over 200 people. Moreover, the Japanese population is not even 60 million. According to a survey in 1925, the Japanese population was only 59,736,822. From 1920 to 1925, the population increase was 3,773,769, with an increase rate of only 6.7%. According to a 1929 World News survey, the Japanese population was 3,168,340 men and 3,125,480 women, totaling 62,938,200. In the same year, there were 245,634 Japanese residing in mainland China (see the March issue of the "An Le Review"). However, the number of Japanese who have migrated to Manchuria and Mongolia is unknown, but it is estimated to be over 100,000. Based on this, no matter how strong the Japanese population production rate is, from the beginning of their cry about overpopulation to today, it is not the case. It is just the brutal Japanese technique of invading China, encouraging their people to migrate to our country, occupying our country's territory, a vicious policy, and a scare tactic to confuse the world's hearing. Regarding this point, I hope our countrymen pay special attention to avoid falling into their treacherous scheme.</p>
<p>Now, from the production aspect, the Japanese people's complaint is even more unfounded. Here, I will use the British Duncan C. Onaurell's article "Japan is Not Overpopulated" as evidence (this article was published in the "Japan Advertising News"). He uses statistical analysis to dissect Japan, and the fact that Japan is overpopulated is false and untrue. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Table 1: Population and Food (Index Comparing the Increase in Japanese Population and Important Agricultural Products)</p>
<p>Year Population Rice Wheat Sweet Potato Beans</p>
<p>1883 100 100 100 100 100</p>
<p>1893 113 135 124 218 134</p>
<p>1903 129 191 163 273 135</p>
<p>1913 146 163 206 375 151</p>
<p>1923 165 197 229 385 157</p>
<p>1924 167 180 208 391 148</p>
<p>1925 169 186 211 367 140</p>
<p>1926 172 194 245 382 156</p>
<p>1927 175 188 236 – – – –</p>
<p>In 1883, the original values ​​of each item were as follows: population 39,700,079; rice 30,692,000 *shi*; wheat 2,479,000 *shi*; sweet potato 260,072,000 *shi*; and beans 2,322,000 *shi*.</p>
<p>According to the table above, it can be clearly seen that the increase rate of rice production in Japan is indeed greater than the population increase. And wheat…</p>
<p>Table 2: Mining Industry (Table Comparing the Rate of Japanese Population and Mineral Production)</p>
<p>Year Population Lead Zinc Copper Tin Sulfur Coal</p>
<p>1921 100 100 100 100 100 100 100</p>
<p>1922 101 75 66 81 113 86 99 90</p>
<p>1923 103 78 79 78 137 117 95</p>
<p>1924 104 65 88 87 149 163 99</p>
<p>1925 105 71 89 93 169 159 103</p>
<p>1926 107 80 108 98 191 226 108</p>
<p>However, in 1921, the population was 57,918,671, Lead - 6,945,357 *jin*, Zinc - 26,241,246 *jin*, Copper - 112,987,381 *jin*, Tin - 34,1851 *jin*, Sulfur - 36,908,266 *guan*, Coal - 29,245,385 metric tons.</p>
<p>According to the table on the right, Japan's increase in production value in 1921-11) Comparison of the rate of increase in production value)</p>
<p>Year Silk Fabric Cotton Fabric Wool Fabric Population</p>
<p>1917 100 100 100 100</p>
<p>1918 137 129 86 101</p>
<p>1919 236 205 167 102</p>
<p>1920 421 339 251 103</p>
<p>1921 292 227 312 105</p>
<p>1922 314 218</p>
<p>1923 263 209</p>
<p>1924 253 228</p>
<p>1925 266 244</p>
<p>1926 258 254</p>
<p>In 1917, the amount of silk fabrics was - 100,083,888 yuan, cotton fabrics - 304,490,256 yuan, wool fabrics - 52,218,361 yuan, and the population was 55,637,431.</p>
<p>Although it is a defect to use currency value as a standard, the curve of its rise and fall is roughly close to its actual production. From this table, it can be seen that the production of textiles has increased sharply, which is greater than its population increase curve. The comparison of the population and the production rate of textiles, the former is far less than the increase rate of the latter.</p>
<p>Further research on raw silk shows that its raw silk production rate is also very rapid and occupies an important position in the Japanese economy. In the past ten years, the production of raw silk has almost doubled, and at the same time, its value has also increased three times. Japan, which is known as a densely populated country, has this real phenomenon, which is really a strange thing. The raw silk table is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Year Production Value Population</p>
<p>1917 100 100 100</p>
<p>1918 116 130 101</p>
<p>1919 129 169 102</p>
<p>1920 139 196 103</p>
<p>1921 126 181 105</p>
<p>312 106</p>
<p>263 108</p>
<p>349 109</p>
<p>290 110</p>
<p>351 112</p>
<p>1922 141 190 106</p>
<p>1923 143 127 208</p>
<p>1924 152 123 209</p>
<p>1925 172 167 210</p>
<p>1926 194 106 312</p>
<p>According to the total amount of raw silk produced in 1917 - 6,034,406 *guan* - its value was 322,551,660 yuan, and the population was 55,637,431.</p>
<p>Comparing the increase rate of raw silk and population from the above table, which one is faster? The increase rate of the former is much faster than the latter.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the transportation aspect, the population increase rate is far less than the rapid increase rate of transportation. The comparison between Japan's population increase rate and the expansion of transportation is as follows:</p>
<p>Year Railway Transport Tons Shipping Transport Tons Population</p>
<p>1917 100 100 100</p>
<p>1918 111 108 101</p>
<p>1919 126 137 102</p>
<p>1920 142 167 103</p>
<p>1921 134 177 105</p>
<p>1922 137 187 106</p>
<p>1923 152 192 108</p>
<p>1924 154 194 109</p>
<p>1925 166 207 110</p>
<p>1926 168 207 112</p>
<p>It was found that in 1917, the population of Japan was 55,637,431, the railway transport tonnage was 42,100,734, and the shipping transport tonnage was 1,717,724 tons according to the available investigation. From this, it can be seen that the rate of population increase is far less than the rapid increase in the rate of transportation. Is overpopulation in this situation a counter-evidence? Can Japan's overpopulation become a problem?</p>
<p>Now, let's cite the increase rate of Japanese population and gas and electricity production as evidence below:</p>
<p>Year Population Electricity Gas</p>
<p>1917 100 100 100</p>
<p>1918 101 109 121</p>
<p>1919 102 122 141</p>
<p>1920 103 141 149</p>
<p>1921 105 171 159</p>
<p>1922 106 189 163</p>
<p>1923 108 221 188</p>
<p>1924 109 256 176</p>
<p>1925 110 278 190</p>
<p>1926 112 344 220</p>
<p>According to the 1917 Japanese population - 55,637,431, electricity - 805,289 kilowatts, gas - 185,247,968 cubic meters. Based on this, the increase rate of the Japanese population is not as fast as the development of the electricity and gas industries. Moreover, the construction of coal and electricity industries requires huge investments. This investment is also fixed in a heavy sense. First, the relationship to the product is fixed. Second, the location is fixed, because these products can only be sold near coal gas plants or electric gas plants. Therefore, this type of business can only be established in a place that is already wealthy or shows the possibility of wealth. The transformation of coal, electricity and gas production and distribution in economics has special significance in this table./</p>

<h3>The Problem of Chinese Immigrants in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>— Qiu Bincun</p>
<p>(1) Colonization and Immigration</p>
<p>The general explanation of colonization and immigration by people is that "individuals or groups, for the purpose of making a living, regardless of whether they have gone through the necessary procedures of a special colonization or immigration agency of their own country's government, leave their motherland, take a car or ship, head to their destination, and devote themselves to labor to make a living, and their accompanying parents, siblings, wives, companions can all be called colonizers or immigrants."</p>
<p>In fact, colonization and immigration have completely different definitions. The English word for colonization is Settler or Colonizer, which means pioneers. The English word for colony is Settlement or Colony, which means a territory for one's own country's colonization. The English word for immigration is Emigrant or Immigrant, which means residing in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Previous people have had many views on the definition of a colony. A common saying is that a part of the people of one country migrate to a place outside their own country and make the place subordinate to the ruling power of their own government, building a social system that is as civilized as their own country, is called colonization. As for the so-called colony, it refers to the place under this organization. To put it more clearly, all the phenomena of a colony are a reflection of the national spirit of the country itself.</p>
<p>In the case of Southeast Asian countries, many, many nationals of different countries and races live together. Among the various overseas Chinese, the most numerous are the overseas Chinese. However, our overseas Chinese can only be called immigrants, not colonists. The place where we live can only be called our immigration area, not our colony, because the ruling power of that place belongs to the government of another country, not to the government of our country.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the different definitions of colonization and immigration, colony and immigration area, are determined by whether or not the right to rule is obtained. Now that the definitions of colonization and immigration are clear, we can talk about the area of ​​our Southeast Asian immigration.</p>
<p>(2) Southeast Asia</p>
<p>When we open a map of the world, on the south of the Asian continent, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan stand tall. Going up the sea is Vietnam, Siam, Burma, and Siam is in the middle of Annam and Burma. Going south is the Malay Peninsula, which is the Indochina Peninsula in geographical terms. Further south is Sumatra, Borneo, Java, the Arib Islands, the Spice Islands, etc., which are collectively called the Southeast Asian Islands, distributed in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Among them, the only country that can preserve its territory, maintain its sovereignty, and be called an independent country is Siam. The others have all become colonies of powerful countries such as the United States, France, Britain, and the Netherlands. These places are the outlets for the US, French, British, and Dutch empires to resolve their economic contradictions, and they are also the external mansions of China's "inexhaustible and inexhaustible" treasures. The position of the Southeast Asian Islands starts from 11 degrees below the equator in the south, up to 27 degrees above the equator in the north, from 90 degrees east longitude in the west, to 140 degrees east longitude in the east, including 100,000 square miles and 100 trillion people. The area and population of each place are now displayed in a table:</p>
<p>Place Name Area Population</p>
<p>Philippines 127,000, 11,000,000,000,</p>
<p>Vietnam 274,000, 19,639,000,</p>
<p>Siam 200,000, 9,207,000,</p>
<p>Burma 263,000, 3,212,000,</p>
<p>British Malaya 53,000, 3,212,000,</p>
<p>British Borneo 31,000, 257,000,</p>
<p>Sarawak 58,000, 600,000,</p>
<p>Brunei 4,000, 25,000,</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies 734,000, 49,350,000,</p>
<p>Total</p>
<p>Hong Kong 177, 360,000,</p>
<p>Macau</p>
<p>Taiwan 3,891,000,</p>
<p>Hong Kong was originally a place in our country. Since the Opium War between China and Britain, after our country's defeat, we had no choice but to conclude a treaty of peace in Nanjing in 1842, ceding Hong Kong to Britain as a colony. It should not be regarded as a colony of other countries.</p>
<p>Before Hong Kong was ceded to Britain, Macau was originally the only trading market on the coast of our country. During the Qing Dynasty, the Portuguese paid an annual rent of 500 taels to lease it to the Portuguese. In 1887, the Portuguese concluded a treaty with the Qing Dynasty, and Macau became a formal territory of Portugal. This place should also not be regarded as an ordinary colony of other countries.</p>
<p>Taiwan was originally a barrier to our country. Seventeen years before the Republic of China (Guangxu 21st year - 1895 AD), due to the Korean civil war that caused the Sino-Japanese War, under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which concluded peace between China and Japan, it was ceded to Japan along with the Penghu Islands. This place, of course, should not be regarded as an ordinary colony of other countries.</p>
<p>That is, the Philippines, Vietnam, Siam, Burma, Java... and other places, in the past, either served our country as a father, or paid tribute and formed a alliance. Now, "the peach blossoms are still there, but the faces are no longer the same." We need to know how unworthy we are to lose these fertile "countries of abundance", and how we must work hard.</p>
<p>The region, area, and population of Southeast Asia have been roughly discussed, and then we will talk about the number of Chinese immigrants in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>(3) The number of Chinese immigrants in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>There are about 10 million overseas Chinese in our country. The overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and Taiwan alone account for 9 million people. Now I will make a comparative table of the number of our immigrants in various parts of Southeast Asia and the number of natives and other colonial immigrants, so as to see the importance of our people's status.</p>
