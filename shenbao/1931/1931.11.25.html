<h3 id="c13">日本毒辣外交之新成功 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>暴日對我東北之實力發動。實以資本主義國家相互間之衝突。及資本主義與社會主義之衝突。兩大矛盾為其原動力。蓋日本為欲實現其雄霸東亞。即（亞洲為日本人之亞洲）之企圖。必以掠奪我東北為鞏固其軍備與陣地之第一着、此於田中義一計劃積極侵略我東北之奏稿中。闡述最為詳明。同時為欲發動資本主義對社會主義之戰爭。日本以地域昆連蘇聯。利害更為深切之原因。亦處於反社會主義第一道防線之地位。其必以略奪我東北為開始對蘇聯之威脅。并取得戰爭上優越地位之先着。蓋亦有其必然。不過事實之另一面。則為以日本之實際强佔我東北。而資本主義國家間之暗鬥。乃日見劇烈。同時又以日本佔我東北對蘇聯威脅挑釁之態度益趨明顯。而資本主義與社會主義之衝突。亦日益接近。此蓋為自九月十八日以來彰彰屹立於我人之眼前。而不可否認之事實。</p>
<p>日本之實際强佔我東北。便全世界帝國主義者國家立即同域日本在遠東勢力頓時澎漲。并予帝國主義者集團權力表現之所謂國際聯盟與非戰公約等之尊嚴面具。有所傷害。故美法英德意等以至任何一國。在禍變爆發之初。都極注目。在國際聯盟第一次集會之際。亦一致不直日本之暴行。至第二次集會以十三票對一票决定美派代表列席。復以十三票對一票决定日軍撤退日期。更可見各國以實際之利益衝突。正各操其如意算盤。計算其本身之利害。而共同籌劃抑制日本勢力過度之伸張。難以各國利害關係之不同。其所表現於行動者。不能具體切實。但其態度之漸趨一致。則極為顯然。</p>
<p>日人固早已料知對我東北實力發動。必足以引起世界之（公憤。）同時更瞭然於國聯態度一致。為其最大之禍患。故一面以承認撤兵。并切實聲明防制事態之擴大。不妨碍各國在東北之利益。以和緩國際空氣。遷延時日。另一方面。則從外交方面向各國分別進行其縱橫捭闔之活動以取得與國。軍事外交。雙管齊下。故國聯第一第二兩次集會。雖對日都有顯呈干涉態度之决議。而日人則絲毫不為其所束縛。其對我國之暴行。且日益擴大。</p>
<p>自國聯第三次集會以來。日本在外交之活動上。顯然又有新的成功。此一成功為日帝國主義最毒辣最險惡之手段。其在事實上。則幾可以完全迴轉列强干涉日本之態度。轉而對日諒解。甚且為日人張目。此一手段。即為日帝國主義者從形式上宣傳反蘇聯。與誣稱我國暗通蘇聯。又從事實上對蘇聯挑釁。以擕成反社會主義向蘇聯進攻之聯合戰線。</p>
<p>吾人試檢閱自九一八以來之事實。蘇聯對東北。禍變自始迄今。旣已聲明保守其絕對中立之地位。俄外長與駐日俄大使在談話中。亦曾一再切實聲明。同時以蘇聯目前之處境。世人亦可斷言其决不至左袒中日任何一方。而日本則一面竭力宣傳蘇聯在北滿有軍事上之準備。并予我馬占山將軍以實力之接濟。中東路且輔助由東西兩面達齊齊哈爾與昂昂溪我國軍隊之運輸。又謂中韓共黨逐日由俄境入東三省。而一再對蘇聯發出所　友誼之警告。另一面在行動上則更超越中東路。實行佔領齊齊哈爾。而予蘇聯以迫近之威脅。以此激起蘇聯全國之憤慨。蘇聯中央機關報。遂有（蘇聯之政策。固竭力主張和平。但此不得引為蘇聯對於外來一切侮辱破壞。一律容忍而</p>

<p>當甲午中日失和時。余年纔十五耳。冬應縣試。與驚盟兄覽周弟同往。邑尊汪舊舫明府名進士也。第一場首題足兵。次題請以戰喻。全場均有激昂慷慨之詞采。余用薛仁貴戚纔光與。業師顧鐵生責為不當。其實一時氣憤所致也。館中向備新聞報。為養生課餘排悶之需。警電遙傳。頗多失實。蓋大半諱敗言勝。每一披誦。色舞眉飛。感懷詩中尾句云。寄語蛤洲諸酋首。王師指日掃氛埃。頗為同學所欣賞。友人胡君謙六自東瀛歸。述彼邦出師之初。朝野担憂陸軍大將大島圭介。海軍大將東鄒。咸為倭人所推重。親赴前敵。一戰而獲倖。舉國慶賀。顚狂如中魔。迨前敵一挫於依克唐阿。再挫於宋慶。警信傳來。婦孺飲泣。赴各廟祈禱者。絡繹不絕。迨吳大澂全營潰散。乃又破涕為笑。咸謂已得神助。其舉動之迷信。令人失笑。惟其愛國心。則較重於我國也。</p>

<p>合肥李文忠公。當同光之朝。勳業功名。彪炳中外。論者以其効忠清室。致有微詞。然外交之才。有足多者。新會梁卓如氏。推李為一代偉人。非虛言也。今者日寇內侵。國壞日蹙。環顧國內。實乏外交長才。回憶李公。曷禁神往。因輯有清名人褒語數則。錄寄本談。藉資觀感</p>
<p>中原多故。狡寇訌於內。强鄰伺於外。則非英武出羣之將帥。而兼備宰輔疆吏之任者。不足旋轉乾坤。奠又區宇。（沈秉成）</p>
<p>通商以來。釁端閒作。六詔除道。則有烟台之役。柳邊索地。則有新疆之役。赤嵌避風。則有瑯嶠之役。越裳開關。則有馬江之役。以其無厭之請。要挾多端。而占見大人。弭首就撫。（潘壽）</p>
<p>天津居幾輔之地。重扼兩洋之咽喉。重譯來王者。瞻元老音容。歸語其酋。嚴憚而不敢逞。（洪鈞）</p>
<p>其移督直隷也。屬泰西通商事起。訂約互巿者。五十餘國。朝廷命公為北洋大臣駐天津。總各國交涉事。旣又會辦海防。凡公使之經臨。夷商之游歷。與夫邦交鄰衅。莫不建威銷萌。其尤關軍國至計者。則講求富國之略。不主故常。其創造舟輿兵械。與夫匠作之工。機軸之巧。敵所能者。我能之。敵所利者。我利之。（譚繼洵）</p>
<p>當是時。泰西諸國之入我海口者。颿檣相屬。各挾其財貨器械。環伺我𨻶。公乃外以信義相聯接。內修戰守之具。謂已用兵十餘年。公私交困。不能不深培原氣也。泰西諸國。亦礱於威望。積久而無敢干以非禮者。惟俄人敗盟於東北。法人肆擾於西南。然皆不旋踵而言歸於好。唐史之稱賢相曰。姚崇善應變。宋璟善守文。公乃兼有此長。（許振袆）</p>
<p>夫自同治以來中外相閧。則有日本臺灣之役。俄羅斯劃界之役。法人越南之役。皆陳師鞠旅。從事疆塲矣。而或舍地而退。或略有迫昨而止。最後越南之役。亦旣兵矢相接矣。而卒也諒山一捷。玉帛旋陳。方事之殷。皆有侵軼難禦之勢。而公主持密勿。時其緩急。以相因應。卒皆墬息以去。而冿沽重鎭。能使敵艦不敢闌入窺伺。以視昔年之憑陵要挾。不可收拾者。有心人當亦曉然於其故矣。（劉瑞芬）</p>
<p>海禁旣弛。環球之上。狎起而議欵者。數十國。江海邊徼。咸視北洋為權輿。公乃沈幾應之。從容鎭之。大信以要之。柔武以綏之。漏巵塞於未萌。利原培於未贏。詰戎肄武。設險固圉。凡所以崇國體而愼邦交者。罔弗周而而布濩。（張煦）</p>
<p>從古天驕之性。不懷德而畏威。廟算之功。惟有備而無患。往者西鰈梗道。東獒跳波。公乃擴騶衍之說。訂化益之圖。來遠交鄰。詰戒表海。智創巧述。文附武威。經緯萬端。牢籠八極。凡所措置洋務海防諸大端。均足以弼成我國家無疆之休焉。（張之洞）</p>

<p>— 張啟麟</p>
<p>契友陶君。當矮奴侵佔吉林時。正置身該地。現因不堪其擾。遷避哈埠。昨接來信。歷述其身受及目擊之經過。讀之令人髪指。爰露諸報端。藉暴倭寇之罪。讀者幸勿輕視焉。來函節錄如下。</p>
<p>九月二十一日。即日軍佔吾吉垣第一日也。是日日軍於晚間抵吉。人民亦無如之何。午夜二時半許。我家已入睡。忽聞巷中槍聲兩晌。弟夢中驚覺後。繼而聞擊門聲急耳重。似非用手所擊者。知有故。亟披衣出戶窺。時則小門已被擊破。知勢必不能久持。遂呼僕挺身出開門。門旣闢。日警二人蹌踉入。手各執長槍。其一尚執有鐵錘。想即適才擊門所用。其後復入一衣西服者。作華語曰。此處非軍法處科長王某所居乎。（王某固曾居我院下屋。惟已於數日前遷去。）言時聲色甚厲。其時一警出呼其衆。一則舉槍指余胸。鐵錘加諸額上。余是時無可奈何。祇得曰。王某前固曾居此處。惟已遷去有日矣。詎彼怒曰。何往。汝必知之。余答不知。彼怒甚。形欲撻余。時適又有日陸軍四人趨入。槍上刺刀。閃閃有光。二人立門畔。二人以刺刀加之余腰。余此時恐嚇過甚。反置死生於度外。與之爭論。詭曰。彼因與我家不睦。是以遷去。余安知其所往。時彼輩猶不以為然。欲余引往尋覓。余見勢已如此。縱說出。亦徒累他人。乃堅持前說。彼屢以鐵錘作欲擊狀。後見余終不改口。汝家有韓人否。余答無有。乃又以刀槍威嚇。幸始終未為所屈。繼而搜查。是時余父母均躱於暗處。一日警排門入·高聲曰。得矣。即捉吾父兩手引出。衣西服者袖出照片一紙。此吾父容貌。照片上人即王某也。徼天之幸。適王某乃瘦長。而吾父則矮胖。彼見貌大不相類。遂釋手。復往各屋搜尋。見一無所得。乃復還。詢吾父姓字。遂以名剌示之。彼見非遼寗軍界中人。亦稍歛其兇勢。而余胸前之利器。亦得稍離咫尺。復以王某所在地詢吾父。吾父亦如余言。彼等見無𨻶可乘。乃悻悻而去。烏乎。吾人民居吾固有之領土內。而受外人深夜搜查逮捕。其辱何甚耶。其後更有甚於斯者。言之令人慘然而髪指。一日。東門外日軍亦藉口搜查。强命居民及商人跪諸街心。彼等入內。翻箱倒篋。有細軟飾物能藏之囊中者。莫不收羅一空。間有少婦長女。則㚥淫在所不免。學校中搜查至一次二次三次此往彼來。循球不已黨義等皆付之丙丁偶有問及。學生對答稍遲者。則撲撻之。同學有居城外者。入城稍早至城門。竟令跪於路旁。待日上竿頭。始得起去。在此時期。學校中本無上課之必要。奈被其逼迫。出於不得已耳。余不忍多述總之一切情形。乃亡國之現象。余家不願為亡國奴。故於十月十七日奔避於哈爾濱。以上之言。在吉時則信函上不敢有一字述及。蓋郵件均須受其檢查也。（却酬）</p>

<h3 id="c125">鄕下人又到上海（二十七） <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>其實揷燒是一種燒猪的肉廣。東人是最喜歡喫的。連婚姻大典，也把這燒猪作為隆重的禮儀，一個女子的貞淫問題，也用這燒豬為表示。因為那燒猪是揷在鐵又上燒的，所以簡言之曰揷燒。不想那位鄕下人，把揷燒纒了拆梢。引出了一段議論。</p>
<p>鄕下人想：再要給他們纏弗清爽，這一頓飯，不知要什麼時候，纔得到肚？胡亂弄了幾樣菜，且醫了肚皮再說。他那時自己點了幾樣菜：要什麼醬肉燒豆腐，鹹菜燒黃魚，百葉炒蝦，韮菜炒肝油。那個夥計把頭都要搖了下來，一疊連聲的說道：</p>
<p>（沒有！沒有！我們沒有那樣的菜。）</p>
<p>（那末你所報出來的菜，都是奇奇怪怪的，呌我買響鑼咧，又是什麼拆梢咧，纏弗清爽。我所報出來的菜，你又說：沒有，沒有，把頭搖得似搖堂鼓一般。看上去，我是要抱着空肚子進來，還是要捧着空肚子出去嗎？）鄕下人有些憤然作色起來。</p>
<p>我們是廣東館子咧，我們有的幾樣菜，就是椒鹽排骨，蝦仁炒蛋等類，你揀幾樣好了。）</p>
<p>鄕下人對於那幾樣菜，倒也聽得明白，便道：</p>
<p>（也好！就是那幾樣菜吧。）</p>
<p>那個廣東堂倌，暗想今天來了這們一個鄕下土老兒，他和別一個堂倌操着廣東話談天，指指鄕下人，不覺漏出了（丟那媽）三個字，</p>
<p>（你們說什麼話）？鄕下人忽然詰問了，</p>
<p>廣東堂倌以為鄕下人是聽不出他們廣東話的，所以無意漏出了一句口頭罵人的話，不料鄕下人提出責問，好像是他聽得懂廣東話的，連忙說道：</p>
<p>（沒有說什麼。我們在講自己的事）。急急的掩飾過去。</p>
<p>你們好像是在說我來兜奶媽，那是沒有的事。雖然我們阿姪媳婦阿土的新娘子，生了一個小毛頭。說要到上海來公館人家當奶媽，我們都不勸伊來。他們那些有錢人家生下孩子來，雇用奶媽，眞是祇知道自己舒服，不顧人家的死活。把奶娘關在他們家裏，好比下了監牢一般，自己的男人，不許見一面：自己的孩子，不許望一望。有的因為貪他們幾個錢，自己的孩子沒有奶吃，活活的餓壞，眞有些可憐。我是不主張有口飯吃的鄕下人，到城裏來當奶媽的。怎麼你們還說我到上海來兜奶媽？）</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論明年新車槪論　頌·　　　　或樣構造均有進步　　一九三二年民瞬即屆。汽車巿塲上。又將有一番新興氣象。在此歲尾年末。正為介結新車之最好時期。爰將明年新車之形式。及與目上下不同諸點。槪括一述如次。關於車架之式樣構造。除少數加以改革外。大部與一九三一年式者相同。凡須革新之處咸從經騐得來者也。至車身之大小式樣。據甘里斯氏稱。目下經營汽車事業者。鑒於國家及國際間之形勢。凡購車者大半趨重於小車一途。因其取價較廉。平時使用雙極經濟。因之將來巿上小車必形衆多。故製造廠方面現多注力於四缸及十二馬力之小車。蓋亦趨於購買者之風尚故也。　　車身之構造及式形。向來日新月異。故明年新車車身。式樣繁多。要在意料之中。大凡得見此種新車者。初初一望。以為其大體上與現行式樣。不相上下。然細加觀察之下。又將發見其改革之處甚為衆多也。從大體上講。新車車身之優異。為地位寬暢。闊而進深。而其前部亦較舒暢。此點粗觀或不可見。但置身車上。定必咸能感到也。新車車身較舊式者為低。此係車架形式低矮之故。乃令車身亦低。此外或因全車各部份配置停勻。亦覺其低而美觀矣。故車線調亦多改觀。雖非大部份如此。要亦十分精審耳。且不僅車身大部份之鑲板作灣曲線形。即兩翼亦莫不盡然。此蓋由於造車方面採用扁鋼日多。不但全鋼之車身如此。凑合式之車身。其木架之上。亦均以扁鋼鑲嵌也。　　汽車之外觀式樣。為目下造車界中最關重要之問題汽車銷售暢滯。大都視其式樣之優劣為轉移。故明年新車對於式樣問題。大費研究苦心。雖然。此非言汽車之動作形狀。可以不顧也。大概識別力特殊之汽車駕駛家。對於汽車行動形狀。均甚注意。不過此點能與其車之身份相稱即佳矣。但造車家於一輛製作精美之汽車。其式樣外觀及出售後之服務。必須十分注意。因若是常能引起意圖購車者之選擇也。職是之故。新車式樣。大為造車家之注意點。不但着重於側面觀看。即前形背影亦都顧到也。　　就上述之範圍而言。汽車上之散熱器·遠射燈·及號角等。必須面面顧到。其配裝上常令與全車相稱也。往日造車家對於散熱器之構造。常在胸中先有一種式樣。對於全車之是否相得益彰。每不顧及。及其成也。式樣非不美觀。然往往駕駛者之視綫為此散熱器所遮蔽耳。車之後部造車時對於其式樣亦經注意及之。大體上觀之。其趨勢為整塊式。彈鐄鈎鏈。當然作擴伸之式。目下各種汽車之構造。彈簧鈎鏈及金屬圈等。其滑潤大多採用集中式。故事實上無須將各部顯露於外也。煞車調整器及避震等裝置。與前大同小異。對於式樣上明年新車有一重要特色。即車架與車身配置適宜。大小勻稱。形式上成為整個之調濟。並非截然成為兩段者也。車身兩旁取形甚深。如此可免窗帷之設。此風現下甚為盛行。新車自亦採用。惟跑板一項從前曾經一度欲消除者、現仍保留。蓋此種設備、其副作用可帮助兩翼防護泥污。雨天甚為需要者也。車上即用緊翼。此種短形跑板亦必採用。其故即如上述耳。　　有一式樣為著名之馬律師及羅浮兩車所採用者。亦頗値得注意。即前部作平式或陸軍式是也。此種式樣前祇於定造車中可以見之。但近為各標準車所擇用。亦殊有一述之價値耳。至於此種式樣是否為進步。此當就全車作一個整個的觀察而言之。但其能令車身內部多得光亮則係事實也。就事實上言此種式樣之車首。駕駛者每欲裝置一風屏。以免耀光閃目之患。若需此種裝置。當以不取外罩式為是。否則式樣上當蒙影響也。　　遮布之鑲板。不用時貼伏於車頂之下。如需使用祇一舉手之勞耳。此種簡單方法。甚為便利。至風屏一頂雖關係較小。在此亦不妨一述。現下風尚。大都採用裝置固定之風屏。一經裝就即不能任意開啓。實則就事實上言。即在極熱之天氣。亦無須開啓風屏也。但有一事為固定風屏所大感不便者。即霧天及溫度降低之時是也。其時霧露迷漫。着於風屏變為潮氣。即有括水亦屬徒然。所幸此種天氣平時所遇極罕。購買固定風屏之汽車者。大可不必担心也。　　四座車門之汽車。使用者甚感便捷。已屬毫無疑義。明年新之車中。兩門雙人車之式樣甚為衆多。此種車輛實際上為兩人座者。但亦另有裝置。可座四人。凡可裝載四人或五人之轎式車。大都均裝四門。以取便利。　　明年一九三二年式之新車。色澤方面大有進步。光明悅目。得未曾有。所有顏色種類。範圍甚廣。若與昔日之祇有若干種類色。及以黑色為尚者。大不相同矣。木材質光亮漆料之使用。流行甚廣。造車家對於此點供獻甚鉅。若與一二年前相較。優美甚多。即在低價車身。其顏色方面所用之光亮工料。今後直可與定製車相媲美。而此種光漆如使用得當。亦甚耐用。自上述之木料質光漆使用後。車身顏色為之煥然耀目。絲織物料之車身乃弗為人所喜用矣。今日雖仍有多人喜用絲織物料之車身。但欲求其鮮明耐用。於保護之上必大費事。否則二年之中即呈蔽舊之象耳。　　一九三二年之車身製造尚有一端甚為重要。即汽車商人於其營業政策上。另闢一種新途徑是也。其法即有若干家之車架製造者。將與專造精美車廂之製造廠聯合。使在此種合作下所產之汽車。成為一種（標準特別車身）。此種名稱驟視之似甚特殊。但實際上則此種車身製造精固。質料優美。堪與其代價相符也。製造廠與車身製造家所合作出產之汽車。將為一般喜新好奇之顧客所歡迎。若車身製造家不與廠家合作。則廠家除製造一種標準式之汽車外。此外並無他法可想。此亦可以反而言之。即標準式者殷求多。而標準特別式需要稀也。譯叢汽車瀛談　　立區蒙之福特新廠　美國福特汽車製造廠。近在加利福尼亞省立區蒙地方創一分廠。資本為五、000、000美金。該廠專將福特出品供給中部及北部加省。此外如夏威夷島·美屬薩穆亞·社會島·大歇的·及加姆等各地之需要。亦均由分廠供給之。去年福特公司宣佈以六0、000、000美金發展其環球事業。此廠即為此項事業中之一端。而代舊金山福特分廠之地位者也。立區蒙分廠為福特沿太平洋岸之第二大廠。其第一廠在加省樂土案極立斯相近之長島地方。係從一九三零年起開工者。第三廠將在華盛頓之西雅圖地方成方。大約十二月一日可以成立。各分廠中之規模最大者當推紐裘賽之愛琪華德分廠。自紐約往。須經赫特森河始達。成立於去年。立區蒙分廠地基計七十二英畝。主要建築之房屋長九百六十尺。闊三百二十尺。另有次要房屋長度相等。寬一百六十尺。配裝部中八小時可成車四百輛。車身廠中亦以八小時之工程完成各車。全廠工作時須用工人二千六百名。　　倫敦汽車展覽盛况　倫敦舉行之汽車展覽。上月十四日在夏令配亞開幕。自啓門後一小時內。來賓之衆多為近三年各種展覽會所未見。由朝達暮觀衆絡繹不絕。對於英製小汽車大為稱賞。蓋衆人心理咸有購英貨為愛國之表示也。參觀者以英製之車與別牌相較。僉以為質料·價格·安靜·美觀及式樣。均覺勝人一籌。熱心之觀衆逐一考察奧司汀·馬律斯·太而卜·伏克斯好爾星格·享博·司坦達·立萊·漢爾門等各種英製汽車。購買者雖似沉靜。然購貨員對於明年營業甚為樂觀。陳列之各車中售價在五百鎊以下者。大為人所注意。（長成小孩車）之具有八匹或十匹馬力者。最為卓越。觀衆中婦人亦屬不少。對於齒輪變更之新裝置大感興味。外人參觀者亦較往年為多。對於英製汽車之迅速進步。咸表驚奇。　　橫斷美洲之老汽車　哇爾特司麻皮爾之老汽車一輛。厥名（老斥堠）。具有一隻汽缸。一九零五年自紐約至卜特蘭。獲得橫斷美洲汽車比賽之首獎。近又重溫舊課。自紐約駛至卜特蘭。第一次比賽時駕駛此車者為赫司氏。此次第二次行程中仍由赫氏駛之一。九零五年初次比賽時。自紐約至卜特蘭其所費時間為四十四天。赫駕車共四十日。當時自早至暮輪不停駛。夜中駛行之時候亦甚多。平均每日行九十六英里。今年赫氏駛車不求別創紀</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>錢。所至各地常作停頓。然此老車每小時猶能駛行二十英里也。　　黑色汽車為人歡迎　法國巴黎最近舉行汽車沙龍展覽。關於汽車之顏色。大都歡迎黑色者。據特各通訊社所得之巴黎報告。大概如次。陳列之五百六十九輛汽車。其中以黑色獨佔首席。此誠令人驚異不止。因大部份人心理中。以為此次陳列展覽會後。淺淡悅目之顏色當最得人歡迎也。黑色之外。其次最為人所喜者為藍色、栗色、綠色、以外牙色、灰、棕色、黃色及紅色。亦有為人所稱賞者云。　　製造車身之新材料　倫敦訊。英國汽車製遵界最近發明一種製造車身之新材料。此項材料係石棉混合物。具有防火、耐用。易修等各項特點。較之金屬製造之車身更為美觀。現在英國所造之汽車中。已有不少採用此項新材料者。製造車身時係用帆布之材料兩層相夾。中間實以石棉混合質。在未經變硬之前。可用模型造成種種式樣。用此項新材料所造成之車身。其外層大為光滑。有若鏡面。其耐用經久。尤為他物所不及。即用鎚擊亦不受影響。茍車身上忽現一洞。則補綴亦殊便利。祇將補料裝入可矣。此種車身之特點。大概如次。夏日較為凉快。冬日較為溫暖。因石棉為不傳熱之質料也。且能減少聲音及震動。又不受潮氣之侵蝕。實較金屬為優良云。　　紐絲倫購英國汽車　自不列顚運往紐絲倫銷售之汽車。為數頗為可觀。本年開始之六個月中。至六月底為止。計自英運往紐絲倫之汽車為一·0八七、輛價値一八六·一二二鎊。自美國運往之汽車為數甚低。祇有三百二十三輛。價値四八·二四六鎊。英製車架銷往紐絲倫者計三百七十架。價値四六·三八零鎊。自合衆國運往者則祇四架。價値六百五十七鎊。六月份中自英運紐絲倫之汽車計五十九輛。價値九·八三三鎊。自美合衆國運往者祇三輛。價値七百七十鎊。英製車架計四十一架。共値四千零六十五鎊。自美國運往者。一架亦無之。車輪胎自英運往紐絲倫者値一七八·一四鎊。自美合衆國運去者。値七千七百四十一鎊。　　黑潑麻皮兒車革新　黑潑麻皮兒車近來製造優。改革之處甚多。七年前該車引用直形八缸。成績甚為卓越。今黑潑麻皮兒又因自由輪之運用於汽車製造上成為一種標準。故黑潑麻皮兒車今後出品咸有自由輪之裝置。且以造車二十年之經騐。預料成績之佳可操左劵。　　英製小號汽車卓越　英國所製造之小號汽車。邇來風行一時。行銷甚廣。據英國運輸部之註冊統計。小號汽車因具有大車之優點及形式。極為顧客所喜購。其中成以星格牌車之行銷為最廣幾佔全部車輛百分之二十三·九。此項車輛係具有八匹馬力者。消息湘桂線工程槪况　山浪·　　湘桂線為由衡陽起經祁陽零陵以達廣西選定省道經過之全縣。乃湘桂交通要道。長三百九十里。預估所需經費。路基三五一·000元。橋樑涵洞三九0·000元。路面舖築三一二·000元。購地遷移拆缷賠償等費一五六·000元。測量一九·五00元。工程處事務費一一七·000元。車站道棚電話綫桿等費五八·五00元。合計約需一·四0四·000元。如無其他事故發生。則此估計。當相差不遠也。　程分三期進行。第一期自十八年十月　至十九年六月止。完成由衡陽至洪橋一百二十里路基及橋涵舖砂等工程。第二期自十九年七月起至二十年六月止。完成由衡屬洪橋至湘桂邊境路基及橋涵工程。第三期日二十年七月起至二十一年六月止。完成由衡屬洪橋至湘桂邊境舖砂及車站道棚電桿等工程。如無特別漳礙。亦可克期完成也。其首段為衡洪段。在衡陽西站與湘粵線銜接。路線自衡陽城外易賴街起。經三塘泉湖吉隆街絲塘舖以達祁陽懸屬之白鶴舖東富舖至洪橋。計程一百二十里。路線多依繞山麗。循舊驛道而行。沿途崗陵其布。土質又甚惡劣。而本段經過區域。即素稱貧瘠之衡陽南鄕也。與湘江蒸水距離極遠。舖砂砂石。無河砂可採。惟就沿途選擇石質較堅者。搥碎作用。涵管石灰等材料。亦來自遠地。運輸困難。需費稍巨。本段復分二分段興修。一為衡泉分段。計程七十里。民國十七年三月開始測勘。至同年九月始决定開工。士工涵甕。均次第於三四月內完成。計涵管一百二十九處。大小橋甕二十二座。橋工以二塘砂石拱橋。工程最大。全橋三甕。每甕徑間三十尺。橋墩岸。頗稱堅固。但開工後。受時局應響。工程旋作旋輟。至十八年六月。路面始實行鋪砂工作。十一月湖南全省公路局成立。接辦之後賡續進行。至十九年二月而衡泉分段。乃完全造成。通車營業。計共用去工程事務費洋約二十二萬餘元。一為泉洪分段。自泉湖至洪橋。於十八年六月繼續測量。計程約五十里。有新舊兩驛道。舊驛道地勢逼狹。時有水患。新驛道有將軍嶺分水㘭山脈橫亘。蜿蜒數十里。故泉洪分段路線之測勘選定。先循舊驛道。經吉隆街附近折東南行。與新驛道絲塘。舖相接合而達洪橋。涵管計八十四處橋甕十五座。建築材料。較衡泉段。採取稍易。土工涵管。早已完竣。未成橋甕。僅十之二三。搥砂工作。亦達十之五六。惟十九年六月。桂軍犯湘。泉洪分段。適當其衝。各項材料。大半損失。七月共匪復陷長沙。於是工欵無着。不得已奉令停頓。計共用去工程事務費洋約九萬餘元。電話桿線。已敷設至泉湖。購地手續將近辦竣。沿途風景尚佳。地方民氣古𣝢。惟商業不盛。居民交易。三日一巿。猶有上古遺風。物產米最多。京針荸薺次之。全段路線。為湘桂兩省交通大道。沿途商旅繁密。且地處湘水上游。小輪不能行駛。故交通全恃此路。近雖祗衡泉段七十里路程。通車營業。商旅已覺便利不少。將來全線能車。其發達可預卜也。浙省最近之交通建設　學遷·　　改組公路局　浙省公路。截至現在已成通車路線。計有拱三·蕭紹·鄞奉·杭長·杭平五路。及杭昌路一小段。共長七百徐華里。營業收入。每月多不過十萬元。而公路局開支。除工程費外。每月需洋十一萬八千六百餘元。收入相抵。每月不敷總數在二萬元以上。是以積年累月。負債達三十餘萬雹元。現汽車雖有百餘輛。多半損壞。路面凸凹不平。地價尚未發給。若不及早挽救。勢必不可收拾。因之浙建廳一再考慮。為免除將來危險計。將公路局改組為公路管理局。專管營業養路等項。每月開支。减為七萬七千九百四十一元。比較以前。已核减三萬餘元。收入方面。經嚴飭整頓後。已增至十二萬九千餘元。預計將來。每月可盈餘三四萬元。作購車養路。及清理債務付給地價之用。故目下正將各路路面。分別修理。汽車已添購十九輛。下月當再購十輛。分發各路應用云。　　績修杭江路　杭江路開工後。中間曾一度因欵絀。擬從緩辦。去年之秒。省府改組之後。實行緊縮政策。經費尤感困難。大有陷於絕境之勢。較日業迭與銀行團磋商借欵。以利進行。現借欵合同。已經簽字。自江邊修至蘭路。已不成問題。該路雖屬輕便鐵道。僅車頭鐵軌。枕木較小。其餘如軌道之寬度。車箱之大小等。均與普通鐵路全同。將來如欲與滬杭甬或南潯各鐵路接軌。均易於辦理。惟沿路橋樑。前為節省經費起見。擬槪建木橋。現第一第二第三三段。業已修成。當無庸更改。至第四第五第六三段。已决定一律改建耐久之洋灰橋或鐵橋。預計增加經費。僅八萬元。至鐵路局經常費。雖每月減少一萬四千元。然所减皆係欠費。於工程之進行。絕無妨碍。江邊至諸曁一段。已於六月一日起通車營業。預計明年三月。可以通至蘭谿矣。　　完成各公路　現在興路之公路。有產樂路之樂館路桃兩叚。抗平路之乍平叚。杭昌路化龍至昌化一叚。及鄞鎭慈全叚。自十八年下半年起。因經費無著。時作時輟。近數月來積極進行。化昌叚僅除少數工程未竣。鄞奉慈路已築土方十一萬餘方。涵洞十餘座。乍平路桃樂館三叚。土方水管。行將完成。惟橋梁尚未建築。總計上開五路。全部完工。尚需經費七十餘萬元。無論經費如何困難。定當設法完成。並擬在公路局償還債務。抽回原抵押之公債票內。暫先抵供撥墊。以應急需。如將來省庫充裕。當集全力。以發展浙省交通。　　核减航政費　浙省航政事宜。原有省航政局。負責辦理。下設四分局。二十五辦事處及內河輪船營業處。開支浩大。自應設法樽節。因於本年二月間。將航政局裁撤。於建廳內附設航政處。辦理其事。原有各區航政分局。改為各區管理船舶事務所。其所屬辦理處。則改為分所。綜計每月核行政費四千二百餘元。而事務進行。反較以前便捷。至內河輪船營業處。。係由前任承租招商局由河輪船。行駛開辦僅七閱月。虧累達一萬餘元。雖經另委委員。力加整頓。無奈積弊太深。積金難返。且船隻多半損壞。亟待鉅欵修理。而省庫奇絀。無法挹注。為提倡民營實業。且免糜費公帑起見。祇行招商承辦也。　　减輕船照費　浙省航船經費。自十八年下期起。尚多延未徵收。一旦連徵三期。船戶勢難担負。浙建廳為體恤貧苦船起見。將十八年下期應徵未收之航船照費。一律免除。至十九年兩期照費。亦减至九折徵收。至農民自用船之照費。則全數豁免而恤農艱云。　　以上數端。胥為浙江最近關於交通方面之建設事項。似皆瑣碎之整頓。而其路政交通之進步。已灼然可見。至其整頓錢江義渡。及完成杭州自動電話。對於交通。亦甚重要。茲不　叙。利和之新貨車　　運貨車之外觀。現在已與乘客車之外觀。互相爭競。新利和之四缸貨車與六缸貨車。現在均採用V形的散熱器。其前坐部份駕駛之合宜與舒服。幾同於新式之轎車。其汽缸為一種鉻與鎳之合金所製成。其四度傳力。確不覺費力。四缸的與六缸的標準輪距為一百三十六英寸與一百六十英寸。其一百卅六寸一種之車架。有一百0二寸。前部坐位處為四十二寸。（後部為六十寸。）一百六十寸者為一百二十六寸與四十二寸。（後部為八十四寸。）一週間汽車肇禍記三原　　日期　地址　　汽車　受傷　傷勢　最後情形　　　　　　　　　號碼　人　　　十八　民國路　運貨　王杳　左足　由人送院　　日　　　　　　汽車　生　　微傷　醫治　　十九　張華浜　某號　某甲　重傷　候族　領　　日　　　　　　　　　　　　身死　　二十　北京路　兩車　脚踏　撞毀　汽車賠償　　日　　　　　　互撞　車　　車　　了事　　二十　四川路　某號　蔣良　碾傷　送院醫治　　一日　　　　　　　　生　　右足　　二十　狄司威　運貨　江北　撞傷　同右　　二日　路　　　汽車　男孩　手足　　二十　中華路　運貨　龔友　右足　同右　　三日　　　　　汽車　生　　微傷　　二十　漢口路　互車　諸阿　碾傷　由人和解　　四日　　　　　至撞　貴　　足骨　了事　　本週間之汽車肇禍共有七起。內因重傷身死者。計男子一人。碾傷手足者。計男子四人。男孩一名。兩車互撞一起云。福州巿之公共　　　汽車　　圖示福州巿首創之公共汽車公司所駛行之一列福特公共汽車此種情形。足為中華各地公共汽車公司採用福特車輛之代表。</p>

<p>Battles Already Occurring West of Juliu River</p>
<p>Japanese Issue Warning to Zhang</p>
<p>(Shenyang) A Reuters correspondent reports that Japanese and Chinese troops engaged in battle this morning at 9:00 AM in the Xinmin area of the Juliu River. As of 6:00 PM this evening, fighting was still ongoing. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) A Reuters correspondent continues to report that, according to Japanese authorities, two squads of Japanese soldiers were drilled this morning and fired upon by Chinese. The area inhabited by the Chinese is Gaotaishan (transliterated), four miles northwest of the Juliu River. The Japanese soldiers immediately launched a counterattack. It is not yet known who was fighting against the Japanese soldiers, but it is thought to be a considerable number of Chinese soldiers. Furthermore, according to unofficial sources, the fighting is still ongoing. However, the Japanese military headquarters stated that it had not received any reports since 2:00 PM this afternoon. Upon receiving this alert, Shenyang dispatched a squad in heavy vehicles to assist. Unofficial reports indicate that after receiving news of the battle, 400 Chinese soldiers departed from Xinmin towards Gaotaishan. It is also reported that 800 Chinese soldiers are stationed at Beijipu (transliterated), twelve miles southwest of Xinmin. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Major General Mori, Commander of the Independent Railway Guard, has begun operations with the aim of suppressing bandits in the area surrounding the Tankengzi coal mines east of Niuzhuang. It is said that there are thousands of bandits who have recently been plundering everywhere and now threaten the South Manchurian Railway south of Liaoyang. Major General Mori intends to drive the bandits west of the Liao River. Local authorities commented that this battle is purely local in nature and not aimed at attacking Jinzhou. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram: Yesterday, the Japanese troops in Xinmin suddenly withdrew a portion of their forces back to Shenyang. The intention is unclear, perhaps because the plan to assist bandits in causing unrest has not been successful, and they dare not act rashly. However, it is rumored that the Japanese army in Shenyang is advancing westward on a large scale, and preparations are indeed underway. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Japanese troops are fiercely attacking Chinese troops near Anshan Nantai, approaching the Liao River from three directions. The Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army has issued a general attack order. Large units from Anshan and Qianshan, along with the Hirosaki Brigade and the Yokosawa Battalion infantry and cavalry from Tanggangzi, are advancing step by step, dropping bombs from airplanes. The Chinese troops are retreating towards the Taizi River. (Dentsu Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese Ministry of the Army and the Kwantung Army Headquarters have suddenly issued a warning to Zhang Xueliang, urging him to reflect and prohibiting any military action. (Dentsu Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Military Authorities Claim Intention to Attack Jinzhou <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Martial Law Imposed in Jinzhou Yesterday</p>
<p>(Beiping) An American reporter in Shenyang telegraphed to Beiping, stating that the Honjo declaration prohibits the existence of two governments in the three northeastern provinces, and it is planned to eliminate the Jinzhou provincial government in a short period. Martial law has been imposed in Jinzhou. At the HuangguTun station, a Japanese bomb killed a station employee. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese military authorities here declared that a major battle will soon take place on the Beining Railway. According to Japanese propaganda, Zhang Xueliang is currently making every effort to prepare a counterattack on Shenyang in order to recover the lost territories of Liaoning Province. They also claim that Rong Zhen will advance on Shenyang from Jinzhou, and this action will be carried out as soon as Chiang Kai-shek travels north from Nanjing. It is further stated that Rong Zhen has assembled his troops in the Goubangzi area. Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, also declared to foreigners that all passenger trains on the Beining Railway were suspended last Sunday due to Chinese troop movements. The troops assembled are from Shanhaiguan and various locations within the Pass, and their destinations are Jinzhou, Shenyang, and the Liao River area. Honjo further stated that Zhang Xueliang has transferred Tang Yulin's troops to Jinzhou, so Tang's cavalry has departed from Rehe in succession, and 2,000 men have already arrived in Jinzhou. The remaining troops can reach their destinations on schedule. Furthermore, according to Japanese military reports, Chiang and Zhang will soon hold a meeting in the north, either in Beijing or Jinzhou, and the highest Chinese military authorities have every intention of formally declaring war on the Japanese Kwantung Army. (National Society News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese official circles today firmly believe that if the Chinese troops around Jinzhou do not withdraw and the majority of Zhang Xueliang's troops are not transferred within the Pass to establish a neutral zone, then a formal declaration of war and serious entanglement will be unavoidable. Although Zhang Xueliang denies amassing troops in Jinzhou, Japanese official circles say that there are indeed several thousand Chinese soldiers in Jinzhou, and that the stationing of these troops in Jinzhou has no beneficial purpose but poses a threat to Shenyang and the South Manchurian Railway. If these troops do not withdraw and a neutral zone is not established, the situation will further escalate, and actual war may break out. Japanese official circles also said that they feel that future developments are becoming increasingly worrying, and the news of Chairman Chiang of China travelling north makes them even more anxious, fearing that the Japanese garrison troops in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanhaiguan will greatly increase.

During the chaos, a box of kerosene and seven hand grenades, as well as two mortar shells, were placed in front of the county government gate. One hand grenade and a box of pre-positioned kerosene were dropped in front of the Dayouqing Commercial Company and a certain barber shop next to the county government. Fortunately, no fire broke out. Two bombs were also found at the Japanese consulate, and the source is not difficult to guess. At the same time, a Japanese plane came to Xinmin for inspection and immediately flew back. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>

(Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram: According to reports from an American journalist in Shenyang, the Japanese army will dispatch troops westward in four or five days under the pretext of suppressing bandits. This is evidenced by the recent activity of bandits in the Xinmin area and the incident on the 23rd when a Japanese representative openly threatened the county government to declare independence.

<h3 id="e12">Draft Resolution of the League of Nations Slightly Revised Yesterday Morning <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>China May Abstain from Voting</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Presents Important Notes</p>
<p>Insists that the Resolution Stipulate Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Has Obtained the Support of Britain and Spain</p>
<p>(Paris) The Council of the League of Nations convened a meeting at 11:00 AM this morning. All council members were present, and representatives from China and Japan also attended. Japanese representative Yoshizawa first read two dispatches, explaining Japan's policy towards the three northeastern provinces. One stated that the occupying troops would not interfere with the Chinese Eastern Railway under any circumstances, and the other reported that the Japanese army had withdrawn the headquarters personnel of a brigade, two companies of infantry, several small teams of engineers, and a number of heavy artillery units. Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji then rose to report that the Japanese army had begun to take the offensive against Xinmin and was preparing to attack Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan. (National Society News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, diplomatic circles in Paris widely circulated that Chinese Chief Representative Shi had told Briand last night that if the resolution adopted by the Council did not include provisions for troop withdrawal, it should not be sent to Nanjing. Shi told Briand that a resolution without provisions for troop withdrawal could not be accepted by the Chinese government. Shi now appears to have obtained the support of Britain and Spain. It is said that Simon and Leroux both agreed to add a sentence to the proposed resolution stating that the dispatch of a committee to the Far East must not be used as an excuse to delay troop withdrawal. The support of British and Spanish representatives for Shi's position has surprised many, as no one expected Britain to take this stance. (National Society News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Dr. Shi met with US Ambassador Dawes today and also wrote to the Council, explaining the situation of the Japanese army's planned attack on Jin County. After sending the letter, Shi personally visited Briand to discuss the matter. (National Society News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The secret meeting will continue tomorrow morning. Private talks continued until the afternoon today. Briand received Dawes and Chaleski, informing them of the difficulties discussed in the morning and the failure of the resolution drafted by the Secretariat to pass. Prior to this, several members of the Administrative Council, especially the representatives of Spain, Yugoslavia, and Poland, believed that if military occupation still existed during the work of the investigation committee, the measures adopted by the Administrative Council would set a bad precedent, and they all expressed their concerns. Furthermore, the draft resolution was based on Japanese suggestions, and many members said that it should be discussed after first seeking China's consent. Therefore, talks were held for a day in the hope of obtaining Shi Zhaoji's approval. Briand met with Shi for a long time. It is said that the text regarding the investigation committee was previously rejected by Japan as unfavorable, so the Chinese government need not oppose it. Nanjing has already expressed its trust in the League of Nations, and the League of Nations should strive to restore the original state within its capabilities, and it will eventually succeed. The key is for China to continue to trust the League of Nations and help it uphold the rule of law. There are seven items in the draft resolution: (1) The resolution of September 30 remains valid, and the withdrawal of Japanese troops should be carried out as soon as possible. (2) The Administrative Council will continue to deal with the incident, and both parties should continue to provide information. (3) Both parties should order their military commanders to cease military action. (4) Both parties should prevent any actions that would further aggravate the situation. (5) Delegations that can collect information in the Far East should continue to report to the Administrative Council. (6) During the on-site investigation by the three-member committee, both parties may provide one staff member to assist, and the withdrawal of troops must be carried out as soon as possible and should not be delayed by the dispatch of the committee. (7) The committee will not interfere in direct negotiations or supervise military actions. Both parties will present their current related issues to it. What the situation will be tomorrow is still unknown. As of now, although an agreement on the investigation committee has not yet been reached, the appointment of committee members is underway. This committee will be composed of people from the United States, Britain, and France. The United States will appoint someone from outside the military and political circles, subject to White House approval. Britain will appoint a jurist, while France has not yet decided whether to appoint a military officer or an ambassador. In any case, those appointed must not be too old and must be able to travel long distances in the cold of Manchuria. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, after 11:00 AM, members of the League of Nations Administrative Council held secret talks for several minutes, and representatives from China and Japan were not present. Yoshizawa was still awaiting instructions from the Japanese government on the attitude that the Japanese representative should adopt towards the League of Nations' proposal to send a committee to investigate the Manchurian incident. As far as the League of Nations' intervention in the Manchurian dispute is concerned, everything now depends on whether China and Japan can accept the League of Nations' proposal. If accepted, the committee will be dispatched immediately, and its report will be the basis for a permanent solution to the difficulties between China and Japan. Before the meeting this morning, Briand met with Yoshizawa, anticipating that there would be no resistance from the Japanese side. What the members of the Administrative Council are now worried about is China's resolute and unwavering attitude. It is reported that Dr. Shi again stated to Briand last night that China would never agree to sending an investigation team without more concrete provisions regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, the League of Nations Administrative Council began substantive work in order to create a magical plan that could resolve the Manchurian crisis. The Secretariat was still busy late at night drafting the clauses of a proposal to send a neutral country investigation team to Manchuria. The original text of the proposal first stipulated that the Japanese army should withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway area as soon as possible, which was almost identical to the resolution passed by the Geneva Administrative Council on September 30. It also suggested sending a three-member committee, assisted by representatives from China and Japan, to investigate the entire state of relations between China and Japan. This clause was broad enough to contain a vast range of general meanings and stipulated that the committee should not interfere in direct negotiations between China and Japan, nor should it monitor or interfere in the actions of the Japanese army. There was not much discussion at the Administrative Council meeting this morning, as it was felt that it would be better to listen to the statements of the Chinese and Japanese representatives first and give them time to consult with their governments. There is now a significant trend towards using all possible forces to reach a solution before the end of this week. (Negotiations are underway.) The original text of the proposal will be revised based on the results of the negotiations, but it is hoped that the Administrative Council will submit a concrete proposal to a public meeting tomorrow night or on Wednesday. Today, Dr. Shi submitted a memorandum to the Administrative Council, stating that he could not consider the proposal to send a committee to Manchuria for investigation only, without stipulating an immediate ceasefire and the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops. Although such an investigation team is not objectionable in principle, if there is no immediate ceasefire and the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops, it will only become a tactic to condone the invading country's unwarranted occupation of Chinese territory and prolong the occupation period. Now, while the League of Nations is leisurely discussing, the invading country has almost obtained what it should not have. Any proposal that ignores and evades the fundamental requirements of China's request to the League of Nations cannot be accepted by China. This document by Dr. Shi was drafted on November 22 and sent to the League of Nations yesterday as a private document for the members of the Administrative Council, but the Secretariat released it today because Dr. Shi requested its publication in a telegram. Dr. Shi's tone was quite strong, seemingly saying that China would refuse to vote on this proposal at the last moment, but China may not vote against it as Japan did at the meeting on October 24. China may abstain from voting. If so, the Administrative Council's resolution can be unanimously agreed upon, giving the proposal legal force. Germany had this practice during several discussions of the reparations issue in the Administrative Council. There was considerable activity behind the scenes today, which did not end until night. After visiting Dawes, Dr. Shi, accompanied by League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, visited Briand at 9:30 PM, and then went to meet Simon. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, the Administrative Council briefly reviewed the draft proposal for sending an investigation team and made some minor revisions. The meeting was extended at 12:25 PM to await instructions from the Chinese and Japanese representatives. Briand reported to the members of the Administrative Council on his conversation with Dr. Shi.</p>

<h3 id="e13">A New Success of Japan's Vicious Diplomacy <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The violent Japanese launched a forceful attack on our Northeast, essentially driven by two major contradictions: the conflicts between capitalist countries and the conflict between capitalism and socialism. Japan aims to realize its ambition of dominating East Asia (Asia for the Japanese) and regards plundering our Northeast as the first step to consolidate its military strength and bases. This is most clearly elaborated in Tanaka Giichi's memorial, which actively advocates invading our Northeast. At the same time, in order to initiate a capitalist war against socialism, Japan, due to its geographical proximity to the Soviet Union and its deep-seated interests, also stands at the forefront of the anti-socialist defense line. It is imperative for Japan to begin threatening the Soviet Union by plundering our Northeast and to take the first step in gaining a superior position in the war. This is also inevitable. However, on the other hand, Japan's actual occupation of our Northeast has intensified the infighting among capitalist countries. At the same time, Japan's occupation of our Northeast and its increasingly obvious attitude of threatening and provoking the Soviet Union have brought the conflict between capitalism and socialism closer. This has been a glaring fact before our eyes since September 18th and cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Japan's actual occupation of our Northeast has immediately allowed imperialist countries around the world to witness Japan's power in the Far East swell suddenly and has harmed the facade of respectability of international organizations such as the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which represent the power of the imperialist bloc. Therefore, countries like the United States, France, Britain, Germany, and Italy, and even any other country, paid close attention from the beginning of the disaster. During the first meeting of the League of Nations, they unanimously condemned Japan's atrocities. The second meeting decided to have a U.S. representative attend with thirteen votes against one, and it also decided on the date for the Japanese army to withdraw with thirteen votes against one. It can be seen that countries are manipulating their own calculations based on actual conflicts of interest, calculating their own interests, and jointly planning to suppress Japan's excessive expansion of power. Due to the different interests of various countries, their actions cannot be concrete and practical, but their attitudes are gradually converging, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>The Japanese have long anticipated that their forceful attack on our Northeast would be enough to arouse world (public anger). At the same time, they are more aware that a united League of Nations attitude is their greatest disaster. Therefore, on the one hand, they acknowledged the troop withdrawal and made sincere statements to prevent the expansion of the situation, not hindering the interests of various countries in the Northeast, in order to ease the international atmosphere and delay the time. On the other hand, they carried out diplomatic activities separately with various countries to gain allies through military and diplomatic means simultaneously. Therefore, although the first and second meetings of the League of Nations both had resolutions showing an attitude of intervention against Japan, the Japanese were not bound by them at all. Their atrocities against our country have only intensified.</p>
<p>Since the third meeting of the League of Nations, Japan has clearly had new successes in diplomatic activities. This success is the most vicious and insidious means of Japanese imperialism. In fact, it can almost completely reverse the attitude of the great powers towards interfering with Japan, turning to understanding Japan, and even speaking up for the Japanese. This method is that Japanese imperialists formally promote anti-Sovietism, falsely accuse our country of secretly colluding with the Soviet Union, and factually provoke the Soviet Union in order to form a united front against socialism and launch an attack on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If we examine the facts since September 18th, the Soviet Union has declared its absolute neutrality in the Northeast disaster from beginning to end. The Russian Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador to Japan have also repeatedly and sincerely stated this in their conversations. At the same time, given the current situation of the Soviet Union, the world can also assert that it will never lean towards either China or Japan. However, Japan has vigorously promoted that the Soviet Union has military preparations in northern Manchuria and has provided substantive assistance to our General Ma Zhanshan. The Chinese Eastern Railway also assisted in the transportation of our troops from the east and west to Qiqihar and Ang'angxi. It also stated that Chinese and Korean communists were entering the three northeastern provinces from Russian territory and repeatedly issued friendly warnings to the Soviet Union. On the other hand, in action, it went beyond the Chinese Eastern Railway and occupied Qiqihar, giving the Soviet Union an imminent threat. This aroused indignation throughout the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's central organ newspaper then had the following statement: "The Soviet Union's policy strives for peace, but this should not be taken as meaning that the Soviet Union will tolerate all insults and damage from outside."</p>

<p>Situation: The instructions from Nanjing to Dr. Shih will probably arrive in Paris after tomorrow evening. Briand hosted a luncheon for members of the Administrative Council, about 30 people, after the meeting. Matsudaira and Yoshizawa were both present. Simon did not attend because he had already left for London at 8:25 this morning. Cecil will attend the Administrative Council meeting in his place, but Simon can return to Paris if necessary. (Reuters telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, rumors spread that Gu Weijun had submitted a counter-proposal to the Administrative Council. The Chinese delegation could not confirm this news, but said that Briand and Shih Chao-chi met yesterday afternoon without any results. The Chinese representative's request for three things was not satisfied: (1) The objective of the Investigation Committee should be clearly specified, and Japan's claims in this regard should not be accommodated. (2) Members of the Investigation Committee should be selected locally so that they can start work immediately without the labor of long trips to Europe and Asia. (3) Although the resolution of September 30 was passed unanimously, Japan's attitude afterward has not been consistent with it. The Chinese government no longer considers these provisions satisfactory and requests the Administrative Council to clearly stipulate the withdrawal of troops. The Japanese delegation has not yet expressed its views, but insists that the mission of the committee cannot be recognized except in accordance with Japan's claims. Briand originally planned to meet Yoshizawa this morning, but stopped because China raised the above objections. The Administrative Council met at 11:00 this morning for only 45 minutes. The members deeply regretted that the talks made by the chairman and representatives of the two parties were fruitless and postponed the meeting until tomorrow. Members who left the meeting answered questions with a bad impression. It is generally feared that Gu Weijun may take a more resolute attitude when he is the Minister of Foreign Affairs in order to satisfy domestic public opinion. Gu enjoys a high reputation in Paris and has many friends in international political groups here. People generally know him as a steady politician and express their trust in him. (Havas telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government is now willing to accept the League of Nations' resolution to send an investigation committee to Manchuria, but opposes one of its clauses, which requires Japan to promise not to rely on hostile actions again. Japan's attitude is that it cannot make this promise while continuing to concentrate troops in Jinzhou and other places in China. It is expected that an instruction containing this meaning will be sent to Yoshizawa tonight. At the same time, Yoshizawa will be instructed to propose to the League of Nations to find a way to persuade China to withdraw its troops from Jinzhou to within the customs and leave a small number of police to protect the Beining route. Local authorities claim that if China agrees to withdraw its troops from Jinzhou, Japan intends to refrain from fighting except as necessary to suppress bandits; otherwise, the Japanese government cannot bind the hands of its army.

<h3 id="e15">The League of Nations Should Impose Sanctions on Japan Under the Covenant <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Government Instructs Representative Shih</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomatic authority said that our government has previously instructed Representative Shih to urge the League of Nations Administrative Council to pay close attention to the practical sanctions that the League of Nations should take against Japan under the Covenant. The main idea of the instructions is that the Japanese army has recently continued to advance in various parts of the Eastern Provinces, disregarding the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, resulting in a serious situation. Japan, under Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, formally undertook, like other member states, to respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of all members of the League against external aggression. Under Article 12 of the Covenant, it agreed to submit any disputes likely to lead to a rupture to arbitration, legal settlement, or investigation by the Administrative Council. In any case, it cannot resort to war until three months after the arbitrators' ruling, the legal judgment, or the Administrative Council's report. Under Article 13 of the Covenant, it agreed that any disputes deemed suitable for arbitration or legal settlement should be submitted to arbitration or legal settlement, and it would not engage in war against any member of the League who complies with the judgment or ruling. Under Article 15 of the Covenant, it recognized that disputes not submitted to arbitration or legal settlement should be submitted to the Administrative Council, and it would not engage in war against the party that complies with the recommendations in the Administrative Council's report. According to the above provisions, even if Japan obtains a favorable judgment or ruling, or after the Administrative Council's report, it may not immediately resort to war. Moreover, Japan has not taken any peaceful steps (it has sought force from the beginning, and its responsibility for destroying the Covenant is even greater). Now, what measures should the League of Nations take? The Covenant itself has clear provisions for this issue. Article 16 stipulates that if a member of the League resorts to war in disregard of the covenants stipulated in Articles 12, 13, or 15 of the Covenant, it shall be deemed, by this fact, to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League. Other members undertake to immediately sever all commercial or financial relations with it, prohibit all intercourse between their people and the people of the Covenant-breaking country, and prevent the people of any other country, whether members of the League or not, from having financial, commercial, or personal relations with that country. Violation of any one of the above three articles is sufficient to constitute an act of war against all members of the League of Nations and should immediately apply its sanctions. Japan is now simultaneously violating Articles 12, 13, and 15. Therefore, China firmly believes that the Administrative Council must immediately proceed to take measures to implement Article 16; otherwise, the world will question the fundamental purpose of the League's existence, and the international organization for maintaining peace produced after World War I will be flawed. Since the occurrence of this problem, the Chinese government and people have realistically trusted the League of Nations, believing that in this dangerous period encountered by the world, upholding the authority of international conventions and trusting the international community are our only obligations. Therefore, no matter what difficulties and sacrifices, we are determined to endure. Over the past sixty days, all actions of the Chinese government and people have been expressions of faithfully abiding by international covenants and strictly fulfilling the resolutions of the Administrative Council. The fact that Japan deliberately destroyed the entire Covenant is already clear, and the dangerous situation is increasing every moment. The only obligation of the League of Nations and other member states at this time is to resolutely implement the sanctions stipulated in Article 16, which is beyond doubt. However, the Administrative Council is still trying its best to seek a solution outside of implementing sanctions. The Chinese government also fully understands the painstaking efforts of the League of Nations Administrative Council. However, it must be noted that the League of Nations must not forget its sacred responsibility at this time, quickly deliberate on practical methods of peace and justice, and implement them immediately; otherwise, the only path China will take is Article 16 of the Covenant.

<p>A Keen Observation by a Russian Newspaper</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Moscow newspapers all carried a foreign dispatch stating that American bankers and business leaders are eager to establish a bulwark against extremism in the Far East, especially in Manchuria. Therefore, the U.S. government's ambiguous policy on the Sino-Japanese negotiations in the three northeastern provinces aims to provoke a Russo-Japanese conflict so that one party can hinder the Soviet Union's five-year plan and the other can reduce the strength of Japan, its commercial rival in the Pacific. As the People's Daily, the organ of the Communist Party Central Committee, commented this morning, this can explain the sluggish actions of U.S. Secretary of State Stimson and the sudden adherence of U.S. Ambassador to Britain Dawes in Paris to the plan of the League of Nations Council. The workers of all countries must unite against the fierce efforts to provoke and ignite a new world war across the ocean. Other newspapers also mostly stated that capitalist countries, especially the United States, are seeking a world war as a weapon against the Soviet Union and to solve the world's long-suffering economic recession. The Izvestia newspaper, the organ of the Soviet Union Central Executive Committee, stated that the Washington government is now seeking an opportunity to besiege the Soviet Union and is therefore inciting Japan's fighting spirit.

<p>Insist on Three Key Points</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the government has issued a most urgent instruction to Representative Shih, the general idea of which is that China must adhere to the following key points that the League of Nations has resolved as the basis for resolving this issue: (1) The League of Nations must immediately deliberate on the most effective method to stop the Japanese military's acts of aggression. (2) Japan must withdraw its troops within two weeks from the date of the League of Nations' resolution. (3) Japan's troop withdrawal must be under the supervision of people from neutral countries. If the League of Nations abandons its previously resolved methods and uses the organization of an investigation committee that does not contain the aforementioned clauses to perfunctorily deal with the current situation, the Japanese warlords' recklessness will become even more unscrupulous, and the future will be even more dangerous. World peace will be impossible for the League of Nations to maintain. China's efforts at this time are to protect the League of Nations as its only loyal member, not only for its own benefit.

However, Stimson is unwilling to discuss the details of the Paris negotiations, fearing interference with the League of Nations. He also said that he often receives reports from Mr. Dawes, but he is unwilling to comment on Mr. Dawes' observations.

<p>French Newspapers No Longer Make Optimistic Remarks</p>
<p>(Paris) The situation in the League of Nations Council on mediating the Manchurian incident has suddenly changed again. This morning, the French newspapers have also abandoned their unique optimistic and promising peaceful resolution tone and mostly admitted that the stalemate remains and seems impossible to break. The New York Herald Tribune, published in Paris, even claimed that the Council's resolution to send an investigation committee has suddenly been sentenced to death. Only Mr. Pannetier of the Paris Echo still claims that reconciliation is still promising and says that he has received confirmation that the committee will first go to Nanjing to inquire about the Chinese government's audience and that its powers are quite broad and its actions are extremely free so that it can monitor Japan's troop withdrawal and the methods used by the Chinese authorities to protect Japanese residents. In addition, the French newspapers also carried details of yesterday's secret meeting. According to the Matin, representatives of Yugoslavia, Poland, and Spain strongly opposed the wording in the proposed resolution, fearing that it would not recognize the right of small countries to demand the return of enemy troops in similar events. Therefore, the representatives of the three countries requested that a statement be inserted in the resolution stating that the resolution cannot become a precedent in Europe. As for the issue of troop withdrawal, all newspapers said that the future is bleak in yesterday's meeting, even the Petit Parisien holds this view and claims that the council members have turned a deaf ear to China's new memorandum requesting troop withdrawal.

<p>(Tianjin) After Doihara instigated the plainclothes team to harass and kidnapped Puyi last time, he came to Tianjin again the day before yesterday. Therefore, rumors that the Japanese army will challenge us on the 25th and 26th are rife again. (Special Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is reported that the Japanese Consul, on the pretext that the disturbance by the plainclothes team endangers the lives and interests of the Japanese, will lodge a counter-protest with us, demanding compensation for the losses of merchants and civilians, and medical and bereavement expenses. The municipal authorities resigned to the provincial government en masse because they could not satisfy the wishes of the public in handling the Tianjin Incident, and they have been retained. The provincial government also resigned to the Deputy Commander and has also been retained. (Special Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Vice-Consul Goto agreed with Shen Dijia, the representative of the Municipal Government, on the 23rd that at 11:00 a.m. on the 24th, the 2nd District and 6th Police Stations would be returned. At that time, our side would send personnel to take over. However, the Japanese soldiers were seen defending the streets and alleys under the jurisdiction of the 3rd District and 6th Police Stations, not only did they not withdraw, but they continued to guard as usual. When asked why, the Japanese side replied that what you wanted was the 2nd District and 6th Police Stations, and now the buildings in the 2nd District and 6th Police Stations have been vacated. Please take them over immediately. As for the sentries of the Japanese soldiers in the streets and alleys under the jurisdiction of the police station, it is difficult to withdraw them temporarily. Seeing that the Japanese side went back on its word, our side did not take over. (Special Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) One-third of the Japanese soldiers guarding the road crossings in the Japanese Concession withdrew on the 24th. All Japanese shops reopened. Only two-thirds of the Chinese shops in Asahi Street reopened. Except for food stores, which were eagerly purchased by customers, no one asked about the remaining silk, cloth, and foreign goods stores. The tram was able to pass through the Japanese Concession on the 24th. Four Japanese soldiers, Japanese police, and Chinese police were stationed at the north and south entrances of Asahi Street to conduct strict and barbaric inspections of tram passengers before allowing them to enter the Concession. However, trams were not allowed to stop in the Concession. The sandbags at the south entrance of Asahi Street have been removed, but the electric fence has not been removed. One-third of the sandbags at the north entrance have been removed, but the electric fence has not been removed. In addition to the openings at the south entrance of Asahi Street, Furong Street, and Akashi Street to the French Concession, the electric fences were also opened on the 24th, and people were allowed to enter and exit after inspection. The remaining road crossings were still blocked. From 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., there was a little vitality. After 3:00 p.m., pedestrians disappeared, and the shops closed, turning into a dead city again. After 6:00 p.m., Japanese soldiers patrolled the streets and alleys in groups of three or five, with a grim atmosphere, no different from Fengdu City. Because the Japanese military only allowed trams to pass through the Japanese Concession but did not allow them to stop to sell tickets in the Concession, the tram company's losses from stopping for half a month have been huge. It has now decided to stop paying the Japanese Police Department's subsidy for November. The French Engineering Bureau will manufacture a large number of new electric fences and transport them outside Qiangzizi River for installation on the 24th. (Special Telegram, 24th)</p>

Secret methods include buying off hooligans, beating anti-Japanese association personnel, preventing the inspection of Japanese goods, disturbing market order, and hindering the sale of domestic goods. It is also heard that the Japanese Consul received instructions from the government that Japanese residents who are unwilling to stay in Hankou can be transferred to Korea and Taiwan for shelter.

The discussion lasted until 7 p.m. before dispersing. All the generals are scheduled to return to their defense posts within days. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Shao Lizi Discusses Zhang Xueliang's Election <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) There are considerable doubts in society regarding Zhang Xueliang's election as a Central Supervisory Committee member. A reporter interviewed Central Committee member Shao Lizi yesterday, inquiring about his opinion. Shao responded that when the Japanese army suddenly occupied Liaoning and Jilin, Zhang was in Beiping and failed to take precautions in advance, and public opinion is certainly justified in blaming him. However, when evaluating people and events, we should focus on the overall interests of the nation. When the Northern Expedition was about to be completed in the 17th year of the Republic, Zhang resolutely changed the flag, completing the unification of the country, despite various internal and external threats and obstructions. This action greatly angered the Japanese, but it was a contribution to the nation. Later, he joined our party, supported the central government, and consolidated unification. Even his various measures in the Eastern Provinces to protect national rights and resist economic aggression cannot be said to have been without considerable effort. We can see from the Japanese' relentless efforts to exclude and discredit Zhang, and their public declaration that they would never allow Zhang to return to Manchuria, that the key lies in something self-evident. What the enemy wants to destroy is what we should cherish. This is my personal opinion. In this conference, the representatives' election of Zhang to jointly shoulder responsibility, I imagine, is also based on this opinion. Patriotic citizens should also encourage Zhang to strive forward with expectation, he said. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Scheduled to Set Sail on the 27th</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 24th. He first visited Gu Weijun at the Huilong Hotel to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue for half an hour. Then he went to his younger brother Yan Deqing's residence to rest. At 2 p.m., he bid farewell to Chiang. They had a long discussion about future diplomatic strategies and his mission after going to the United States. Yan told visitors that regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, the League of Nations recently complied with the Japanese request to form an international investigation team. Our country naturally opposes this kind of investigation team, which would delay the withdrawal of troops, unless the Japanese first withdraw their troops. The purpose that the Japanese hope to achieve with the investigation team is to deceive the members of the team and hope to have their dispatch of troops recognized as legitimate. Our country believes that the current situation in the Northeast is extremely dangerous, and a disaster may erupt at any time. If the fuse is not removed first, then the investigation is an investigation, and the forcible occupation is a forcible occupation. What good is it to the facts? The League of Nations should not accept this. I have already purchased a ship ticket and will go to Shanghai on the 26th and set sail on the 27th. It is expected that when I arrive in the United States, it will be the time when the United States Congress is in session, and perhaps a fair review of the Sino-Japanese incident can be heard. I still need to meet with Mr. Wu Ti Yun when I pass through Shanghai, he said. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Conference Overturns the Shanghai Meeting Proposals</p>
<p>Sun, Chen and Li Consider this a Vote of No Confidence</p>
<p>They Exit the Conference to Hong Kong</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Sun Ke, Chen Youren, and Li Wenfan left the province for Hong Kong on the 24th, along with twenty other representatives to the Fourth Plenary Session. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Because the opinions of the representatives to the Fourth Plenary Session were inconsistent, Sun Ke visited Chen Jitang three times to negotiate, but Chen claimed illness and refused to see him. When the Fourth Plenary Session opened on the 23rd, Sun and Chen did not attend. After the resolution to overturn the Shanghai Conference was passed, Sun, Li, and Chen considered the conference to be a vote of no confidence in them and decided to withdraw from the conference and report to Shanghai by telegram. On the morning of the 24th, they came to Hong Kong with northern representatives Zhao Pilian, Guo Chuntao, Bai Yunti, and dozens of others. Sun, Li, and Chen decided to go to Macau on the 25th and then transfer to Zhongshan County for temporary residence. Jing Tingyi, Zhang Zhiben, Liang Hancao, and others also withdrew from the Fourth Plenary Session. This disturbance was initiated by the power faction and Xiao Focheng, Deng Ziru, and others.

<p>(Hong Kong) Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and Chen Youren sent a letter to the Fourth Plenary Session from Hong Kong on the 24th, first stating the results of the peace talks: 1. To promote the unity of the party and the unity of the country; 2. To determine the reform of the future political system. Among them, the most important is to reassemble the cadres of the first, second, and third central committees to give the party new life. If the decisions of the peace talks can be implemented one by one, then dictatorship will naturally not occur. Advocating an extraordinary conference is consistent with this idea. Next, they defended the election of members of the first, second, and third central committees as members of the fourth central committee, which the conference considered to be in violation of the party charter. They said that the party has been in turmoil for several years, and it is impossible to resolve it entirely based on the party charter. We cannot use the party charter to erase all facts. Even if the extraordinary conference has no basis in the party charter, the fourth plenary session convened by the extraordinary conference also has no basis. How can we respond to this? They continued that one of the most important parts of the peace talks has been rejected, then the prospects for party unity and national unity have been greatly hampered. Ke, Fan, Ren and others are representatives of the peace talks, how can they bear this important responsibility lightly? They can only withdraw from the conference and quietly await the public judgment of comrades and citizens. Finally, they said that Wang and Hu are united in good faith and working for the country with all their hearts. They hope that their comrades will overturn the previous resolution and accept the proposals of the extraordinary conference, then it is not too late to mend the fold. Also, Bai Yunti said that since we are not succumbed by dictatorship, how can we be insulted by separatism? A total of one hundred representatives to the Fourth Plenary Session came to Hong Kong on the 24th. The entire left wing withdrew. The Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session will issue a declaration to explain the resolution of the 23rd, in order to avoid outsiders suspecting that it hinders the progress of unification. On the 24th, the price of medium paper fell from 91 to 83. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Adachi Advocates Organizing a Coalition Cabinet</p>
<p>The Government and Parties Form a Head-On Conflict</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 24th - The conflict between the government and parties is becoming increasingly complex. The status quo maintenance faction centered on Prime Minister Wakatsuki and the coalition faction advocated by Interior Minister Adachi have begun vigorous efforts. One side is making every effort to prevent its realization, while the other side is actively working to establish a plan. The head-on confrontation is as incompatible as fire and water, and the disintegration of the cabinet is inevitable.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The attitudes of various senior statesmen towards the coalition cabinet advocated by Interior Minister Adachi are currently calm, but many believe that Wakatsuki's claims and Adachi's advances are too biased. The Wakatsuki's non-partisan cabinet has considerable reasons, but they do not want to change the current situation regarding the coalition cabinet issue.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Finance Minister Inoue met with Wakatsuki at 4:30 PM yesterday to discuss the coalition cabinet issue advocated by Adachi. He strongly opposed it, believing that the foundations would be shaken during this autumn of financial and diplomatic difficulties, and he hoped that Adachi would reflect and avoid affecting the overall situation.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Interior Minister Adachi met with advisors Tomita and Matsuda, and Director-General Raiki yesterday and made an important statement as follows: The success or failure of realizing the coalition cabinet depends on future efforts. Those who oppose a non-partisan cabinet united by the whole country should be regarded as unpatriotic.</p>

<p>Ma Zhanshan Leads Troops in Fierce Battle for Two Days and Nights</p>
<p>Soldiers Fight Bravely Against the Enemy, Depleted of Support and Ammunition</p>
<p>On the 19th, Retreat to Keshan with Plans for Counterattack</p>
<p>Harbin Communication, Republic of China Year 10, November 19th. Ma Zhanshan, with his isolated army without support, exhausted of ammunition and strength, was defeated and retreated to Keshan. The city of Heilongjiang Province, belonging to our territory and under our government, is being watched by 400 million compatriots and 2 million soldiers as it falls to a foreign race. I, foolishly drafting this communication now, am heartbroken and do not know whether it is ink or tears.</p>
<p>Preparation of the Japanese before the Great Battle. Since November 4th, the Heilongjiang army has repeatedly crushed strong enemies. The Kwantung Japanese Army, with all its 8,000 troops, attacked several times but were repelled. Therefore, Honjo Shigeru was furious and secretly requested instructions from his government. His memorial to the Chief of the General Staff stated, (Regarding the military situation in Heilongjiang, it has reached a state of extreme evil. The Kwantung Garrison has come to believe that the time has come to make a final decision to defeat it. For strategic convenience, certain locations should be occupied so that our army (Japanese army) can defeat the many with the few. If we always act according to the will of the government, opportunities will be lost. Please grant the Kwantung Army Commander the authority to make independent decisions in emergencies, and please approve this intention.) With the plan to attack Heilongjiang finalized, Honjo issued a final ultimatum to Ma Zhanshan in his name at 8:30 AM on the 16th. The original text stated, (I have received an urgent telegram from Minister of the Army Minami in the Ministry of the Army, making three demands on Ma Zhanshan: (1) The Ma army must withdraw north to Qiqihar. All troops concentrated in Qiqihar and Ang'angxi must be returned to their original locations immediately. (2) The Ma army must not be stationed south of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (3) Ma must not interfere with the management of the Tao'ang Railway Bureau. Otherwise, the Japanese army will immediately take necessary and effective measures. Regarding the above three points, they must be implemented within ten days from November 14th. After all conditions are met, the Japanese army may consider withdrawing the Nenjiang Detachment. A reply is required by noon today (the 16th), to be forwarded by the Japanese Special Service Agency in Harbin.) After receiving this unreasonable demand, Ma immediately reported the information to Zhang Xueliang and requested instructions on how to deal with it. Zhang telegraphed a detailed refutation: (1) Qiqihar and Ang'angxi are entirely Chinese territory, and the Ma Zhanshan army is a Chinese government army. On what basis does the Japanese government interfere with their stationing within their own country? It is highly inappropriate. (2) Both north and south of the Chinese Eastern Railway are Chinese territory. Why should the Japanese army forcibly withdraw and change its garrison location? (3) The Tao'ang Railway was built with a Japanese loan, but the loan contract clearly stipulates that the sovereignty of the railway belongs entirely to our country. All management and control cannot be unilaterally controlled by the creditor. This is recognized by all countries in the world and is a completely unreasonable demand that cannot be accepted.) Before the Japanese ultimatum arrived, the Korean 8th Mixed Brigade had already been formed and dispatched. On the 16th of this month, trains between Shenyang and Changchun on the South Manchuria Railway were stopped for half a day. It was rumored that bandits were disturbing the railway at Fanjiatun, causing transportation disruptions. In reality, the Japanese were trying to free up space to transport troops from the 8th Mixed Brigade. The two regiments of cavalry artillery from that unit arrived in Taonan on the evening of the 17th. Thus, the battle began at about 10 PM that night.</p>
<p>Two Days and Nights of Bloody Battle by Our Army. The Japanese army, well-prepared, divided into two forces for frontal and flank attacks. The Hasebe Brigade and the Lushun Heavy Artillery Regiment, totaling about 4,000 troops, attacked the first line of defense at Daxing Station, Sanjianfang, Xiaosanjiazi, Daguantun, etc., pressing from the front and preventing our army from moving. Meanwhile, the newly arrived Korean Mixed Brigade, with two cavalry regiments, plus a portion of the Domon Division's infantry and artillery, and all of the Amano Brigade's cavalry and infantry, totaling more than 7,000 troops, with four tanks attached, bypassed the northern end of Jiangqiao and attacked the left flank of our cavalry on the third line of defense at Tangchi Mushroom Creek. Defending that area were the 1st regiment of Cheng Zhiyuan's 8th Cavalry Brigade, the 1st regiment of Ma Zhanshan's guards, and the Shali Township Regiment of Wu Songshan's 1st Cavalry Brigade, totaling three regiments. However, after repeated casualties, no more than 2,000 men remained. The enemy attacked with a force several times larger, with extremely fierce artillery fire. Our army was outnumbered, but the soldiers were loyal to the country and did not flinch because of their small numbers. From the start of the firing at ten o'clock, the battle was extremely fierce. Our army resisted with all its might, defending from the trenches. Enemy cavalry battalions charged more than ten times, but were repelled by our effective use of mortars and machine guns. After three hours, the enemy's tanks had approached our trenches, covering infantry machine gun teams. Bullets rained down, and wooden stakes and iron nets outside the trenches were destroyed. Many trenches were collapsed, and each regiment and battalion was forced into dozens of separate locations by machine gun and artillery fire. At the same time, Japanese cavalry surrounded from the left rear. Our army could no longer stand in the trenches, and fought outside the trenches after four o'clock. However, the ranks had already been scattered, and most of the horses had been blown up. The regimental commander Tu Quansheng still bravely shouted and led his two cavalry companies and one infantry squad to charge into the enemy lines five times. The enemy cavalry retreated several times to avoid them. By five o'clock in the morning, our army had no reinforcements, and ammunition was running out. The gun barrels were all heated and could no longer be used. Seven Japanese planes also assisted in the attack from the air, dropping hundreds of heavy bombs. At this point, almost none of our soldiers were intact, but they still fought bravely, retreating to Hongqiyingzi in hopes of receiving reinforcements from that direction and cooperating in a counterattack. Unexpectedly, the infantry in that area was also pressing tightly from the front, rushing to provide support. At this point, Tu Quansheng had no choice but to lead the remaining 700 soldiers, breaking through the firing line and retreating to Ang'angxi at about ten o'clock, blocking the railway to resist the enemy. Japanese planes and cavalry artillery continued to attack fiercely, and many shells fell on the tracks of the Eastern Railway. After holding out until noon, Chairman Ma Zhanshan rushed from the provincial capital to encourage the soldiers and personally led the pistol team as a vanguard, launching a fierce counterattack. After a strong attack, the enemy was driven back at about two o'clock in the afternoon, and the original defense was restored at half past two. The flank battle ended at this point. The battle on the front line at Daxing Station, Xinlitu, and Sanjianfang occurred at 10:40 PM. The Japanese army immediately attacked with 4,000 troops, first harassing our left and right wings with cavalry, and then attacking the front of Sanjianfang with infantry and artillery. Initially, the intention was to contain us, preventing us from rushing to aid the flanks, so the attack was not yet fierce. After two o'clock on the morning of the 18th, the troops were increased, and eight tanks and more than thirty artillery pieces were used to attack fiercely. Our army had only three flat-trajectory guns, which were used to resist their tanks. The enemy's advantage was slightly repelled, but the guns and artillery fired continuously, and the pressure gradually increased. Our artillery was not able to withstand the long range, and the soldiers only used rifles to resist. The resistance was naturally weak. At 3:20, the Xinlitu defense line was the first to be broken. The troops in that area retreated to Daxing Station, and with the assistance of the artillery, they launched two fierce attacks and recaptured the position at about four o'clock. However, not long after, the Daguantun defense line was again surrounded by the enemy. Zhang Brigade's cavalry was trapped in the trenches, and the situation was already critical. Wu Songshan's unit assisted Yuan Brigade in a rescue operation at five o'clock, relieving the siege. Since then, the situation has become even more dangerous, and the position has been lost and recaptured several times. After holding out until ten o'clock, twelve Japanese planes and twelve tanks attacked, and at the same time, a regiment of new Korean troops arrived to join the fierce attack. The Japanese army attacking our Tangchi Mushroom Creek, taking advantage of their victory, circled around from our rear. Our army on the third line of defense, with less than 2,000 men, was originally only a link between the first and second lines of defense. It was difficult to stand firm under the enemy's attack, so it gathered at the first line of defense. The enemy's encirclement having been completed, they unleashed the power of both air and land forces, attacking from above, below, front, and back. Since the night battle on the 17th, ammunition had been cut off. People and horses had not eaten for a day and a night. The mountain guns and flat-trajectory guns had also run out of ammunition due to firing too many shells, so they switched to using mortars to bombard the enemy's dense formations. However, the enemy, relying on the power of the tanks, was not afraid at all. At two o'clock in the afternoon, the trenches were completely destroyed. More than half of the Yuan and Wu Brigades had died. A battalion of Zhang Dianjiu's unit, with ammunition running out, was the first to break through and retreat. The other units were affected, and it became increasingly difficult to defend. The officers and soldiers left the trenches one after another, cutting a path to the rear. Due to the lack of ammunition, they even engaged in hand-to-hand combat with gun stocks. The enemy charged with bayonets, and countless of our soldiers fought to the death. At 4:30, they were unable to resist the enemy any longer and retreated to Hongqiyingzi. During the most intense battle, a mortar soldier named Pang Zhenhai from the 4th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Brigade fired more than eighty shells. Suddenly, the firing pin broke. He still shouted and killed with his bare hands. His comrades pulled him out of the trench, but he became so agitated that he went insane. Barefoot and naked, he rushed to the enemy lines, and other soldiers had to drag him back by force.</p>
<p>The Inevitable Retreat to Keshan. In the urgency of the situation, Chairman Ma Zhanshan repeatedly telegraphed various parties for assistance. The Jilin army watched without moving. The authorities in Beiping also gave no definite instructions. Ma borrowed ammunition from Ding Chao in Harbin, but Ding refused. Since the Tao'ang Railway battle, the bullets used were all old stocks from Heilongjiang Province, and most were moldy and unusable. After a day and night of fierce fighting, nine out of ten rounds had been used up. The soldiers had fighting spirit, but what could they do when they were unable to fight back with their bare hands? Seeing that the front line was already hopeless, Ma issued a general retreat order at six o'clock on the afternoon of the 18th. All the main forces retreated along the Qiqihar-Ang'angxi Railway to the provincial capital, leaving the cavalry to set up a defensive line at Wuma Place, 18 miles from the city (Qiqihar-Ang'angxi Railway Station). At that time, the provincial capital was already in chaos. A separate detachment of the Japanese army, with four to five hundred cavalrymen as one branch, bypassed the Chinese Eastern Railway from Jingxing, passing through Gan Jingzi, Jixin River, and Lindian, to attack the provincial capital. Ma divided his troops to block them. After ten o'clock in the evening, the situation became increasingly tense. The Japanese army advanced from Hongqiyingzi towards the provincial capital. The provincial capital had no defenses to hold. Ma then issued another order to move the provincial government to Keshan County. All provincial government officials who were willing to go were escorted in retreat by Yuan Chonggu's brigade. Ma himself still led his guard force of more than 500 men and more than 700 cavalry to guard Longsha. That night, Ma spoke to Zhang Jinghui and Ding Chao in Harbin via long-distance telephone, instructing them to convey to the Japanese army not to harm the people of Heilongjiang. At nine o'clock on the morning of the 19th, a large part of the Japanese army crossed the Chinese Eastern Railway line from the Tianqiao on the Tao'ang Railway, stopping at Yushutun, fifteen miles outside the Black Wall. At 9:20, they attacked our army at Wuma Place. Ma Zhanshan mobilized the entire city to fight, reinforcing the defending troops there. The Japanese army still used planes to drop bombs, and two planes flew over the city, dropping twenty bombs, destroying one military and civilian government office and one house each, causing fierce fires. A part of the Japanese army cavalry appeared at the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway Station, attacking the rear of our army and civilians. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Ma entered the city to bundle up important documents from various agencies and protect a part of the merchants and civilians, retreating along the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway. Thousands of merchants, civilians, the elderly, children, and personnel from various agencies followed, and the situation was extremely miserable. When retreating, in order to prevent the Japanese army from pursuing, a section of the Qiqihar-Taianzhen railway tracks was destroyed. Keshan is ninety Chinese miles from the Black Wall, and Taianzhen is sixty miles from the Black Wall. It is heard that Ma's plan is to gather the people's militia in Keshan and try to counterattack. If the Japanese army continues to press on, or if time does not allow, then he will retreat to Baiquan and train the people's militia.</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian Attitude is Extremely Silent. On the morning of the 19th, the Japanese army sent a team of soldiers to the Ang'angxi station of the Chinese Eastern Railway to monitor the railway staff and special police and railway police. Station staff entering and leaving must wear armbands. During the fierce fighting on the 18th, the Japanese army dropped many bombs on the Ang'angxi station, destroying railway tracks and sleepers. The Soviet Russian government made no comment, and the Russian personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway also acted as if they did not see it. Although the Japanese army withdrew from Ang'angxi on the afternoon of the 19th, a large number of Japanese troops were still stationed at the Ang'angxi station of the Tao'ang Railway (eight Chinese miles from the Chinese Eastern Railway station), and the Russian side made no statement. It is heard that the Japanese Consul General in Harbin, O Hashimoto Chuichi, sent a public letter to the Russian Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway on the night of the 18th, so the Russian side considered it satisfactory. The original text is as follows: (The Japanese army's challenge to Ma Zhanshan's army concentrated in the area south of Ang'angxi is a measure of self-defense and has to resort to war. The commander of the Kwantung Army has ordered the commander of the first line of troops to respect the interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and also said that if the railway protection army does not take hostile actions, the Japanese side will not attack. However, in the future, in the progress of the war, Ma Zhanshan's army may use the terrain and objects near the Chinese Eastern Railway, or take military actions to retreat within the area, which will inevitably damage the property of the Chinese Eastern Railway. At this critical moment, it is urgent for your railway to seriously advise Ma Zhanshan's army not to take the above actions. In order to protect the property of your railway, I dare to inform you of the above. Addressed to Lodeevsky Li Shaogeng. Hashimoto Chuichi, Japanese Consul General in Harbin, November 18th.) As for the security of Harbin, it is still under our country's jurisdiction at present. However, with Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang successively falling, Harbin, with its small area, is isolated in the middle, and it may be difficult to survive alone. However, whether the Japanese will send troops to Harbin, or order the officials and clerks in Harbin to fly the Japanese flag and implement martial law to inspect mail and telegraphs, is still a question. As for the Japanese army, at half past ten on the afternoon of the 19th, they first sent more than a hundred cavalrymen, in several small teams, to enter the Black Wall to search. Seeing that there was no movement, they stopped at the consulate. At one o'clock in the afternoon, a Japanese plane circled over the Black Wall, distributing Domon's absurd proclamations, which stated, (Our army has been forced to fight with the Chinese Heilongjiang army. The target is the enemy. I will never disturb the Chinese Eastern Railway and Qiqihar Station, and I am willing to have friendly relations with the local people and authorities. In the future, if troops are needed to stay in the provincial capital of Jiang Province, I do not want to interfere in local internal affairs, so I hope that those who do not hinder my army's actions will continue to work as usual.) At three o'clock in the afternoon, Domon led a part of the army into the city, staying at the Longjiang Hotel, and sent troops to extinguish the flames of the provincial border office. In the evening, two regiments of cavalry and infantry entered and occupied the three major camps in the east, south, and north. Another part of the army camped outside the city, and more than 3,000 cavalry pursued our army along the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway. However, the retreat of the Heilongjiang army was very methodical. On the evening of the 19th, Bu Brigade Yuan Chonggu set off for Baiquan. The people's militias in Heilongjiang, Dongqinggang, Suihua, and other places, upon hearing the news, rose up to support Ma, and telegraphed Ma to retreat to Baiquan, and that the joint force would provide support. Therefore, last night, the Japanese army stopped near Taianzhen and did not dare to advance. Merchants and civilians in Heilongjiang Province closed their businesses completely on the 18th. For the past two days, they have not yet resumed business. The Japanese army forced them to hang Japanese flags to welcome them. Many merchants and civilians, fearing the threat of the Japanese army, fled to Harbin. The passenger trains from Ang'angxi to Harbin last night were all packed with men and women seeking refuge. Today, there are still a large number of refugees waiting for trains in Ang'angxi. Last night, seven robbery cases occurred in the Black Wall, all committed by Korean vagrants. The Japanese army turned a blind eye. The Chamber of Commerce, because the police had withdrawn with the army, specially formed a temporary merchant corps yesterday to maintain order. The Japanese plan was originally to make Zhang Haipeng the chairman of Heilongjiang. Recently, because Zhang killed the Japanese who were monitoring the Zhang army, he has become an enemy of the Japanese. On the evening of the 19th, Zhang also led his troops to disrupt the Tao'ang line, destroying the railway tracks between Tailai and Taonan, and clashed with the Japanese army. Therefore, the Japanese army had to look for someone else. In recent days, the Japanese Consul in Harbin, Black and Forest Hide, the representative of Honjo, repeatedly forced Zhang Jinghui to go to the Black Wall to serve as chairman, and Ding Chao of the Railway Protection Army replaced Zhang as the chief of the special zone. Yesterday afternoon, the Chinese Eastern Railway and Qiqihar-Ang'angxi railways prepared a special car for Zhang, but he did not depart at the appointed time. He will go at three o'clock this afternoon. As for Ding Chao, he was originally a classmate of Xi Haxia. After Xi became independent, he appointed him as commander of the Railway Protection Army. At the same time, Zhang Zuoxiang also telegraphed Ding to act as his agent. After Ding took office, he straddled the fence for a long time. Recently, through Zhang Jinghui's mediation, he has reached a tacit understanding with the Japanese. Therefore, when the Heilongjiang army begged for help on the 18th and 19th, Ding held several brigades of the Jilin army and watched without moving. He also ordered the Railway Protection Army at the Ang'angxi station not to oppose the Japanese army when it passed through. On the 19th, when the Japanese army passed through the Ang'angxi station, Ding's troops hung Chinese and Japanese flags to show no resistance. All of this shows the leopard's transformation in the current situation and the rise and fall of slave patriots. (12:00 noon on the 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Secrets Before Pu Yi Left the Customs <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Talked About by Pu's Followers</p>
<p>Beiping Communication. This time, Pu Yi was taken to Guanwai by Doihara Kenji and Zheng Xiaoxu, etc., and the Japanese will use him as the protagonist of the independence of the three northeastern provinces, which is undoubtedly beyond doubt. However, what is Pu Yi's personal will? Until now, everyone has different opinions. Now, Mr. Hu, who accompanied Pu Yi to play tennis in Tianjin for five years, came to Ping today and talked about Pu Yi's usual behavior and the recent events. Pu Yi's attitude can at least be known in most cases. Mr. Hu said, I have been with Pu Yi for five years and observed his behavior. He is a stupid and昏庸person. He usually has a very bad temper. Even if his teachers Chen Baochen and Zheng Xiaoxu slightly offended him, he would scold them. Chen and others would kowtow and cry to persuade him, but they were never heard. Pu Yi has very close relations with the Japanese. He likes to eat Japanese sashimi and authentic sake, and he tries his best to imitate Western habits, wearing Western clothes and leather shoes, and speaking broken English, thinking he is very happy. He also has a love for boys and keeps as many as twenty-five of them. Among them, Wang Xiaosan is the most favored. He is as charming as a prostitute and never leaves for a moment. As far as I know, the rewards Wang has received are more than 100,000. These boys all live on the third floor, indulging in lewdness day and night, and the filth is spreading everywhere. He is very indifferent to his wives and concubines because of the encirclement of the boys. His wife, Rong, is a modern woman who is good at dancing and singing, and is very lively. She occasionally gets Pu Yi's favor. As for his concubine, Jin Wenxiu, she is an old-fashioned woman, very restrained and good at crying, and Pu Yi hates her even more. After being provoked, Pu once issued an edict saying, (You deceive the king, and your crime deserves death. I will give you death), etc. Wenxiu was even more afraid, and she was not tolerated by the wife, so she divorced. Pu spent 190,000 yuan on this matter, and Wenxiu only received 50,000. His昏瞆and muddleheadedness can be known. Pu respects the Englishman Reginald Johnston the most, because he also believes in Europeanization. After the Eastern Province Incident, the Japanese side sent a person named Kageyama to live in his house to guard it. All those who visited had to get his consent. At the beginning of the month, Doihara came to Tianjin with Jin Liang, Zheng Xiaoxu, and Zheng's son Zheng Yu, etc., to encourage Pu Yi to leave the customs. When Zai Tao and Chen Baochen heard about it, they strongly opposed it, saying that the Japanese were only using this to scare the Nanjing government and make it soften. They were not really helping. If they were fooled, it would be very dangerous in the future. It is better to temporarily go to Beiping to ensure safety. They also discussed with the Ping authorities, planning to take the opportunity to take Pu Yi to Ping to avoid being surrounded by the Japanese. The Ping authorities also agreed with their statement and had found a house next to the American Embassy in Dongjiaomin Lane for Pu Yi to live in, and promised to send a special car to Tianjin to pick him up. However, Doihara and Jin Liang, etc., knew about it, so they used tricks to send gifts, secretly placing bombs to scare him. Pu Yi was really caught in the trap, and was panic-stricken. On the 8th, the plainclothes team launched an incident, and there was a lot of gunfire. Jin Liang, Doihara, Zheng Xiaoxu, and his son Zheng Hao thought that the opportunity had come, so they greeted Pu Yi in an armored car, falsely saying that Tianjin would be in great chaos and that the Japanese concession would become the focus of artillery fire. It is better to avoid it early and go to the Japanese consul's residence in the British concession to seek safety. Pu Yi was taken away in panic and confusion. The next day, he boarded a Japanese warship from the Japanese Consul's residence and went to Dalian. Zheng Xiaoxu and his son also followed. As for the details of the agreement with the Japanese, nothing is known. The rumors from the outside are mostly speculation. It is heard that Pu's wife, Rong, knew in advance that Pu intended to agree to leave the customs and tried to dissuade him. Pu said angrily, (Living here, I am just a citizen of Tianjin. When I get to Guanwai, even if I am the second Joseon, I will be a hundred times more glorious and wealthy than being a commoner). Therefore, judging from Pu Yi's daily behavior and his recent statements, it can be concluded that he is willing to be a Japanese puppet. (22nd)</p>

<p>Advocating the Use of Tongzhou Native Cloth. Tongzhou large-sized native cloth was sold exclusively to the three northeastern provinces and Jiangbei Li Xiahe. Since Guanwai has fallen and there is a major flood in the lower reaches of the river, the sale of cloth has been greatly affected. The local people from all walks of life are now appealing to the province and ministry to advocate its use to save the cloth industry.</p>

<p>Agricultural Association Estimates of Field Industry are Unsatisfactory. The previous unilateral estimates of the yield of fields and crops by the rural agricultural associations in Xiaoshan County were mostly unsatisfactory to the owners. In addition, the collection fee of one dime and two cents per mu further increased the burden on the farmers. Now both the tenants and the owners have jointly filed complaints with the provincial and county governments, so there will inevitably be a dispute when the rent payment period arrives this year.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Joint Associations of Universities and Middle Schools in this city, in view of the increasing national crisis and the relentless attacks by the brutal Japanese forces, and the lack of united resistance from our government and people, which is insufficient to save the nation from destruction, the Joint Associations of Universities and Middle Schools organized a delegation to urge the government to send troops.

<p>There were three to four hundred petitioners from Jinan University. The school anticipated heavy traffic and overcrowding when all schools gathered, so they left early in the morning. They took the Beijing-Shanghai train around 7 AM and arrived at Xiaguan at 4 PM, waiting for the Shanghai university students to gather before going to the National Government to petition.</p>
<h3 id="e98">A Glimpse of the North Station <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Around 2 PM, students from various schools arrived by moving trucks. The students from each school wore volunteer army uniforms and held petition flags, with slogans such as "Request the government to recover lost territories" and "Punish the negligent officials in the Northeast." By the time, several thousand people had arrived, crowding the platform and station. Flags fluttered and military music played. The petitioners were all spirited and filled with grief and anger.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Five Departures <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Students from various schools arrived at the North Station one after another around 2 PM. Those who lived farther away arrived by moving trucks and lined up in the open space in front of the station before entering the platform and boarding the train in order. They boarded the Tongkuai train to Beijing via Zhabei at 3:15 PM. However, the train had limited carriages. There were over 8,000 students who arrived at the station, and the Railway Bureau only allowed seven additional carriages, which was still insufficient. Therefore, none of the teams boarded the train and waited on the platform. At the same time, the general command gathered representatives from various schools and held an emergency meeting in the waiting room of the station. It was decided to send eight representatives to negotiate with the Transportation Department. After several discussions, no results were achieved. It wasn't until around 5 PM that the Railway Bureau reluctantly mobilized carriages, stopped selling tickets, and allocated the originally scheduled number of passenger cars to the students. They were divided into five trains. The first train departed at 5:33 PM, the second at 6:27 PM, the third at 6:55 PM, the fourth at around 10 PM, and the fifth at 1:15 AM this morning. At the same time, schools along the way, such as Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, also joined, totaling over 5,000 people. The total number was over 14,000 people.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Condition of the Passenger Cars <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>When representatives from various schools negotiated with the Railway Bureau, and the Railway Bureau claimed that there were no cars available, the Zaokuai train and Tongche train from Beijing to Shanghai were about to arrive at the North Station. The Railway Bureau, fearing that the students would occupy the trains, hurriedly ordered the Maigen Road Station to hold the two trains and drive them into the storage track. The trains that were supposed to depart from Shanghai were also suspended as a result. All ticket offices stopped selling tickets and displayed "Sold Out." Only after the trains carrying the students from various schools had departed did the Zaokuai train from Beijing, which had been stopped at Maigen Road, release to the North Station. The Tongkuai train also arrived in Shanghai and switched tracks to Hangzhou. The Yekuai train from Shanghai to Beijing still departed as usual, but the departure time was much later than originally scheduled.</p>

<p>The delegation of university representatives held its fourth emergency meeting in the waiting room of the North Station at 2 PM yesterday. Zhou Xiaobo of Fudan University presided over the meeting. The key resolutions were: (1) to ratify the Secretariat; (2) how to solve the vehicle problem? It was resolved that on the one hand, the general commander would send personnel to seize vehicles, and on the other hand, the general affairs department would notify the management office not to sell any more tickets. (3) The orders of the delegation would be conveyed by the director of the secretariat to the general commander. The resolution was passed, and the general commander reported that the total number of students from various schools was 3,000, and that 24 vehicles had been seized.

<h3 id="e104">Document to Chairman Chiang <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese and National Salvation United Association of Students of Shanghai Universities presented a document to Chairman Chiang to urge the government to send troops: Presented to urge the Japanese invaders to become increasingly urgent, the national situation is in danger, and a special delegation has been sent to appeal to you to follow the situation and immediately send troops to recover the lost land in the Northeast to maintain the survival of the nation. Since September 18, when the Japanese imperialists, disregarding the great injustice of the world, invaded and occupied Liaoning and Jilin, the local officials in the Northeast adopted a policy of non-resistance, retreating step by step, which was absurd and perverse, and shocked the whole country. The students were filled with righteous indignation and formed teams in late September to appeal for troops to be sent to resist the invaders and avenge the humiliation. At that time, you publicly declared that the lost land would be recovered in the shortest possible time, and that if the Japanese soldiers advanced any further, they would be met with a head-on blow. The students believed that you held an important position in the country and that your word was as good as gold, and that you would have something to comfort the people. Therefore, we obeyed the order and returned to Shanghai, on the one hand, to intensify our studies in preparation for a long-term struggle, and on the other hand, to carry out military training to serve as a backup for the government. However, more than a month has passed, and not only has not a single inch of the lost land been recovered, but the invaders' flames have grown and the invaders' atmosphere has become more intense. After the disturbances in Tianjin and Tianjin, followed by the fall of Heilongjiang Province, they even attacked Jinzhou, entering homes and ascending halls, and the country is facing destruction every day. However, the government's self-defense and sending of troops has not yet been shown in fact. The students have been holding their composure for too long, and their boiling blood is unbearable. Therefore, we have sent 5,000 students to organize a delegation, with a very orderly spirit and a firm attitude, to appeal to you again, one, to personally write a mobilization speech to the public immediately, stating in the speech that you will personally lead the troops to depart north immediately, no later than December 1, and will not return to Beijing until the lost land is recovered; and two, to strictly order Zhang Xueliang to send troops immediately to recover the lost land, and if there is still no indication of sending troops within three days, he will be dismissed and severely punished. The delegation represents the will of all Shanghai students, is entrusted by all Shanghai students, and pleads for the sake of the people in the Northeast who are in deep water and for the sake of the entire country that is in imminent danger. We swear to be loyal and foolish, dare to imitate the weeping in the Qin court, and will never leave Beijing until our goal is achieved. You have dedicated yourself to the country and made repeated declarations. At this time of national crisis, we respectfully ask you to follow the situation, approve our request, so as to show great faith and calm people's hearts. We are waiting for your orders with the utmost urgency. Respectfully presented to Chiang, Chairman of the National Government.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the students of the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School, since hearing of the fall of Heilongjiang Province, have become even more righteous. This time, the middle schools in the city organized a petition delegation to Beijing, and the school was also very enthusiastic. After the principal and teachers explained in succession yesterday, most of them understood the central government's policy of recovering lost territories. However, in order to take consistent action with the anti-Japanese work of various schools, they jointly elected more than 20 representatives to participate in the majority of the students, and they are still studying peacefully.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese and National Salvation United Association of University Students in Shanghai recently notified various schools to suspend classes for two days on the 19th and 20th to go out and raise funds to support the generals and soldiers in Heilongjiang Province. St. John's University, because classes were still being held as usual, only raised donations on campus. The students of the school were very enthusiastic in donating because General Ma Zhanshan fought alone. It was also reported that St. Mary's and McTyeire School for Girls would also send donations to the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association of the school for safekeeping. At 3 PM yesterday afternoon, the donations were publicly opened in the school's Friendship Room. The Shanghai Bank sent someone to count the money, totaling 1,793 yuan, 7 jiao, and 8 fen, including 678 yuan, 2 jiao, and 6 fen from McTyeire School for Girls, and 545 yuan, 4 jiao, and 2 fen from St. Mary's. Those present at the scene to supervise were Zhao Xiuhong, a professor at the school, and Qiu Gaohua and Han Runpeng, representatives of the student union. It was also reported that Liu Zufa, chairman of the school's Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association, had sent letters to the student union representatives of St. Mary's and McTyeire School for Girls, but they were unable to attend due to other matters. The middle school department is still conducting fundraising.</p>

<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1894, I was only fifteen years old. I went to Ying County for the winter examination with my brothers Jingmeng and Lanzhou. The magistrate Wang Jiufang, whose name was Jinshi, was also a Jinshi. The first question of the first session was about strengthening the army, and the second question was about using war as a metaphor. The entire field had impassioned and generous words. I used Xue Rengui and Qi Cai Guang. My teacher, Gu Tiesheng, criticized it as inappropriate. In fact, it was caused by momentary anger. The inn always had the News, which was needed to relieve boredom after the health class. The alarming telegrams were transmitted remotely, and many were untrue. Most of them concealed defeats and reported victories. Every time I read them, I danced with joy. The final sentence of my poem, "Tell the chiefs of Hezhou, the king's army will sweep away the atmosphere soon," was quite appreciated by my classmates. My friend, Mr. Hu Qianliu, returned from Dongying and described that when they sent troops, the government and the people were worried about Army General Oshima Keisuke and Navy General Tojo, who were respected by the Japanese. They went to the front line and were lucky enough to win the first battle. The whole country celebrated, as if they were possessed. When the front line suffered a defeat at Ike Tang'a and another defeat at Song Qing, the alarming news came. Women and children wept. Those who went to various temples to pray were endless. When Wu Dazheng's entire camp was defeated, they laughed through tears again. They all said that they had been helped by the gods. Their superstitious behavior was laughable. However, their patriotism was more important than ours.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Fate of Wei Zhi <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>I heard that the Japanese attacked Ma Zhanshan, but the Japanese army did not enter Shanhaiguan. There is still a gate inside Shanhaiguan, and it is better to be inside the gate than outside. I heard that the Japanese army will enter the gate. The Japanese army did not climb Zijin Mountain. There is a river full of water under Zijin Mountain; the boatman watches with his hands in his sleeves as the boat capsizes?</p>
<h3 id="e122">Record of Praising Words on Li Shaoquan's Diplomacy <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Jianfu</p>
<p>Li Wenzhong, Duke of Hefei, during the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns, his meritorious achievements shone brightly both domestically and internationally. Commentators have voiced reservations about his loyalty to the Qing Dynasty. However, his diplomatic talent is certainly commendable. Liang Zhuoru of Xinhui praised Li as a great man of his era, and this was not an overstatement. Now, with the Japanese invaders encroaching internally and the nation deteriorating daily, looking around the country, there is a genuine lack of diplomatic talent. Recalling Duke Li, one cannot help but feel a sense of yearning. Therefore, I have compiled several eulogies from famous Qing figures and recorded them for this discussion, hoping they will provide inspiration.</p>
<p>When the Central Plains is beset by troubles, with cunning bandits causing internal strife and powerful neighbors watching from abroad, it requires generals of extraordinary valor and statesmen with the responsibilities of both prime ministers and border officials to turn the tide and secure the realm. (Shen Bingcheng)</p>
<p>Since the opening of trade, disputes have frequently arisen. To clear the path through the Six Edicts, there was the Yantai Incident. To demand land along the Willow Palisade, there was the Xinjiang Incident. To seek refuge from the wind at Chihkan (Taiwan), there was the Langqiao Incident. To open customs at Vietnam, there was the Majiang Incident. With their insatiable demands and constant coercion, they would meet the dignitaries, lower their heads, and submit to appeasement. (Pan Shou)</p>
<p>Tianjin, located in a pivotal strategic area, serves as a crucial gateway to both oceans. When envoys from afar arrived, they observed the appearance and demeanor of the veteran statesman, and upon returning to their chiefs, they were filled with awe and dared not act presumptuously. (Hong Jun)</p>
<p>When he was transferred to govern Zhili, it was at a time when Western trade was beginning, and over fifty countries were establishing trade agreements. The imperial court appointed him as the Minister of Beiyang, stationed in Tianjin, to oversee all foreign affairs. He also concurrently managed coastal defense. Whether it was the arrival of foreign envoys, the travels of foreign merchants, or diplomatic disputes, he would assert authority and nip problems in the bud. What was particularly crucial to the nation's military and economic strategies was his pursuit of ways to enrich the country, without adhering to old conventions. Regarding the creation of ships, vehicles, weaponry, and the work of artisans, the ingenuity of machines, whatever the enemy was capable of, we could also do; whatever the enemy benefited from, we could also benefit from. (Tan Jixun)</p>
<p>At that time, the Western nations entering our ports lined up their sailing ships, each carrying their wealth and armaments, watching our borders intently. Duke Li connected with them through good faith and righteousness while strengthening our defenses internally. He stated that after more than ten years of war, both the public and private sectors were exhausted and that it was necessary to deeply cultivate our vitality. The Western nations were also awed by his prestige, and for a long time, none dared to treat us without due respect. Only the Russians broke their treaty in the Northeast, and the French stirred up trouble in the Southwest, but both soon returned to peaceful relations. Tang Dynasty history praised virtuous ministers, saying that Yao Chong was good at responding to changes, and Song Jing was good at upholding tradition. Duke Li possessed both qualities. (Xu Zhenyi)</p>
<p>Since the Tongzhi era, conflicts with foreign countries have included the Japanese invasion of Taiwan, the Russian demarcation of territory, and the French invasion of Vietnam, all of which involved deploying troops and engaging in combat. However, in some cases, land was surrendered, while in others, progress was slightly impeded before stopping. Finally, in the Vietnam War, despite the exchange of arrows, peace was ultimately restored through the presentation of silk and jade after the victory at Lang Son. During these critical moments, there was a sense that invasion was imminent. Duke Li, however, managed the secret matters, adapting to the changing circumstances, ultimately quelling the disturbances. Tianjin, as a critical location, was protected and enemy warships dared not enter or spy, unlike the past when they were able to bully and coerce us uncontrollably. Those who are thoughtful will understand the reason for this. (Liu Ruifen)</p>
<p>Once the maritime ban was lifted, dozens of countries eagerly sought to negotiate treaties with us. The coastal regions all looked to Beiyang as the starting point. Duke Li responded calmly and decisively, managing the situation with great trust and pacifying it with both gentleness and force. He prevented problems from arising and cultivated resources. He prepared for war, fortified defenses, and thoroughly implemented measures to uphold national dignity and handle diplomatic relations with care. (Zhang Xu)</p>
<p>Throughout history, the nature of arrogant rulers has been to fear power rather than appreciate virtue. The key to strategic planning lies in preparation and prevention. In the past, the western invaders obstructed our paths, and the eastern aggressors stirred up waves. Duke Li promoted Zou Yan's theories and formulated plans for transformation. He cultivated distant allies and warned those beyond the seas. His intellectual creativity was coupled with military strength, and he organized everything meticulously to encompass all aspects. All of the major measures taken in foreign affairs and coastal defense were sufficient to assist in ensuring the boundless peace of our nation. (Zhang Zhidong)</p>
<h3 id="e123">A Letter from Someone Who Moved from Jilin to Harbin <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qilin</p>
<p>My close friend, Tao Jun, was in Jilin when the dwarf invaders occupied it. He has now moved to Harbin to escape their disturbance. I received a letter from him yesterday recounting his personal experiences and what he witnessed. Reading it makes one's hair stand on end in anger. I am sharing it in the newspapers to expose the crimes of the Japanese invaders. Readers, please do not underestimate this. Excerpts from the letter are as follows:</p>
<p>September 21st was the first day that the Japanese army occupied our Jilin. The people could do nothing. The Japanese army arrived in Jilin in the evening. Around 2:30 AM, our family was already asleep when we suddenly heard two gunshots in the alley. My brother woke up startled from his dream. Then, we heard a rapid, loud banging on the door, as if not done by hand. Knowing something was wrong, I quickly put on my clothes and went to peek outside. The small door had already been broken. Knowing we couldn't hold out for long, I called the servant to open the door. As soon as the door opened, two Japanese police officers stumbled in, each holding a long gun. One was still holding an iron hammer, likely used to break the door. After them, a man in Western clothing entered, speaking in Chinese, "Does Section Chief Wang of the Military Law Office live here?" (Mr. Wang did live in the lower house of my courtyard, but he moved away a few days ago.) He spoke in a very harsh tone. At that moment, one police officer shouted to his comrades, and another pointed his gun at my chest, placing the iron hammer on my forehead. At that moment, I had no choice but to say, "Mr. Wang did live here before, but he moved away some time ago." To my surprise, he angrily said, "Where did he go? You must know!" I replied that I didn't know. He became very angry, threatening to hit me. Just then, four Japanese soldiers rushed in, their bayonets gleaming. Two stood by the door, and two pressed their bayonets against my waist. At this moment, I was so frightened that I forgot about life and death and argued with them. I said, "He moved away because he didn't get along with my family. How would I know where he went?" They still didn't believe me and wanted me to lead them to find him. Seeing how things were, even if I told them, it would only hurt others. So I insisted on what I said. They repeatedly made motions to strike me with the iron hammer. Seeing that I would not change my story, they asked, "Do you have any Koreans in your house?" I replied no. Then they threatened me with their knives and guns. Fortunately, I was not swayed in the end. Then, they searched the house. At this time, my parents were hiding in the dark. One police officer broke into the room and shouted, "Got him!" and grabbed my father's hands, pulling him out. The man in Western clothing took out a photograph, which was my father's picture. The person in the photo was Mr. Wang. Luckily, Mr. Wang was tall and thin, while my father was short and stout. When they saw that they looked nothing alike, they released him and continued to search the other rooms. Finding nothing, they returned and asked my father's name. Then I showed them my business card. Seeing that I was not involved in the Liaoning military, they softened their tone slightly, and the sharp weapon in front of my chest was moved a little further away. They again asked my father where Mr. Wang was. My father said the same thing as I did. Seeing that there was no way to take advantage of the situation, they left angrily. Alas, our people live within our own territory, yet they are subjected to late-night searches and arrests by foreigners. What greater humiliation is there? What happened after that was even worse. It is unspeakable and makes one's hair stand on end in anger. One day, the Japanese army outside the East Gate also used the pretext of searching to force residents and merchants to kneel in the middle of the street. They went inside, overturning chests and cabinets. Small valuables and ornaments that could be put into bags were all taken away. Occasionally, young women and daughters were subjected to unavoidable rape. The schools were searched once, twice, three times. Ideologies were all thrown aside. If students were asked questions and were slow to answer, they were beaten. Some classmates who lived outside the city arrived at the city gate a little earlier and were made to kneel by the roadside until the sun was high before they could get up. During this time, there was no need to have classes in schools. But they were forced to do so. I can't bear to say more. In short, the whole situation is like a country that has been lost. My family does not want to be slaves of a conquered nation, so on October 17th, we fled to Harbin. I didn't dare to write a single word about the above matters in the letters when in Jilin because all mail had to be inspected. (Que Chou)</p>

<h3 id="e126">A Country Bumpkin Visits Shanghai Again (27) <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Actually, "cha shao" (叉燒) is a type of roasted pork. People from Guangdong love to eat it the most. Even in grand wedding ceremonies, this roasted pig is used as an important ritual, and a woman's virginity is also represented by this roasted pig. Because the roasted pig is roasted on iron skewers, it is simply called "cha shao." Unexpectedly, this country bumpkin confused "cha shao" with "chai shao" (拆梢), leading to a debate.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin thought: If I keep arguing with them, I don't know when I'll get to eat this meal. I'll just order a few dishes at random to fill my stomach. At that moment, he ordered a few dishes: braised pork with tofu, braised yellow croaker with salted vegetables, stir-fried shrimp with baiye (tofu skin), and stir-fried liver with chives. The waiter shook his head repeatedly and said in a series of quick replies:</p>
<p>(We don't have those dishes! We don't have those dishes!)</p>
<p>(Then the dishes you listed are all strange and bizarre. You want me to buy a gong, and then you talk about "chai shao" (拆梢), which is confusing. The dishes I ordered, you say you don't have, and you shake your head like a rattling drum. It seems like I'm going to come in with an empty stomach and leave with an empty stomach?) The country bumpkin became somewhat indignant and assertive.</p>
<p>(We are a Cantonese restaurant. The dishes we have are salt and pepper spare ribs, stir-fried shrimp with eggs, etc. Pick a few of those.)</p>
<p>The country bumpkin understood those dishes clearly, so he said:</p>
<p>(Alright! Just those dishes then.)</p>
<p>The Cantonese waiter thought, "Today, a country bumpkin has come." He chatted with another waiter in Cantonese, pointing at the country bumpkin, and unintentionally blurted out the phrase "diu na ma" (丟那媽).</p>
<p>(What are you saying?) the country bumpkin suddenly asked.</p>
<p>The Cantonese waiter thought that the country bumpkin wouldn't understand Cantonese, so he unintentionally blurted out a common curse word. Unexpectedly, the country bumpkin questioned him, as if he understood Cantonese. He quickly said:</p>
<p>(We didn't say anything. We were talking about our own things.) He quickly covered it up.</p>
<p>(It sounds like you were saying I came here to find a wet nurse. That's not the case. Although my nephew's wife, A Tu's new bride, gave birth to a little one, and they said she wanted to come to Shanghai to be a wet nurse for a wealthy family, we didn't encourage her to come. Those wealthy families who hire wet nurses only care about their own comfort and don't care about the lives of others. They lock the wet nurses in their houses, as if they were in prison. They aren't allowed to see their own husbands or even glance at their own children. Some, because they are greedy for a few coins, let their own children go hungry to death. It's truly pitiful. I don't encourage country people who can find a meal to come to the city to be wet nurses. Why are you saying that I came to Shanghai to find a wet nurse?)</p>

<h3 id="e127">Finance: Gold Market Shows Subtle Signs of Weakness <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations remain erratic. Yesterday's gold prices showed a slight decline. Although the volatility was not drastic, the overall price range was considerable, fluctuating by several taels each time. From morning to evening, there were about thirteen or fourteen taels of fluctuations. Traders felt uncertain, and there were significant discrepancies in buying and selling activities, ultimately resulting in a drop of more than six taels. The initial opening was weak, likely due to a slight drop in major trading. Subsequently, fluctuations became irregular, revolving around seventy taels. Exchange rates strengthened but then loosened, with some traders settling positions. British exchange rates hardened due to persistently small British-American exchange rates. The afternoon market saw high and low prices, with six to seven taels of fluctuation. Large holders sold off positions, and there was a slight upward trend at the close, with a total volume of over six hundred and seventy taels. Major traders may anticipate a rebound.</p>
<p>Morning hovered around seventy taels. The morning opened with a decline of three taels, to six hundred seventy-four taels and five qian. Major trading showed a recent decline of three-sixteenths, with no change in forward prices. Silver prices fell by seven-eighths, and private telegraphic transfers decreased by one fen, but this had no impact, likely due to selling by Shunli, Wanxing, and others. Buyers seemed strong for a moment, rising to seventy-seven taels, then declining by more than seven taels to sixty-nine taels and seven qian due to selling by Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yonghengchang, Yong, and Mr. Wu. However, exchange rates, such as for US dollars, tightened. Mackellar offered 32.125 yuan, and HSBC absorbed February British gold at 19.1875. Hengchangyong, Tianfengyong, Yuanmaoyong, and others then entered, raising the price by seven taels in just over ten minutes. The published price of British gold did not change, and US dollars were quoted at a small seven-five, at seventy-six taels and nine qian. Suddenly, Hengxing, Bingxing, Shunli, and others all sold, and China Bank once bought and sold one-month British gold at twenty-five and offered US dollars at 32.3125. At 9:30, it dropped to seventy-one and a half taels. Exchange rates seemed to show interest, with forward US dollars at 32.1875 yuan, and with Tongtaichang, Yifengyong, Richang, Senchangyong, Qianchangxiang, and others competing to purchase, the price gradually rose by more than seven taels. At 10:00, the price was seventy-nine taels, and with Dalian dealers and Chengfengyong, Yuankangxiang, Senchangyong, Hengchangyong, Bingxing, and others selling in unison, the price could not hold for long and worsened, falling nearly ten taels, with only one or two taels of fluctuation. At 10:30, the price was sixty-nine and a half taels, and then it rose again by four taels, to seventy-three taels and seven or eight qian. But selling pressure arose again, with Tongtaichang, Yuanmaoyong, Dalian dealers, Yuanmao, Hengchangyong, and others selling in succession. US dollars could be settled at 32.275 to half a yuan, causing another drop of seven taels, to sixty-seven taels at 11:30. Subsequently, there were minor fluctuations of two to three taels. Bombay decreased by three annas, and at 11:45, it rose again by three taels, to seventy taels and eight qian at noon. Unexpectedly, the market closed at sixty-eight taels and nine qian, with scattered short covering pushing the price back above seventy taels. The quoted price was changed to seven hundred sixty-two taels, calculated with a deduction of seventy-five, seventy-six, up to ninety taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon market moved from high to low. The afternoon market opened at seventy-one and a half taels, then two and a half taels, reflecting the lingering effects of the noon closing. Suddenly, due to Bombay reporting a large five annas, the price retreated to sixty-eight taels. Before long, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Shunli, and others entered, and Mackellar absorbed one-month British gold at 4375, and Zhengjin and HSBC traded US dollars at 32.625 yuan, causing a rise of six taels, with only one or two taels of fluctuation. At 2:30, the price was seventy-three taels and nine qian. Subsequently, banks traded at 32.75 yuan and British gold at nine and a half pence. Hengxing, Fuchang, Yifengyong, Hengchangyong, Zhifengyong, and Yuanmaoyong all sold, resulting in a drop of more than eight taels. Market conditions became weak, and at 3:30, the price suddenly fell to sixty-five taels and five qian. Afterwards, conditions turned calmer, with various firms entering and short sellers covering positions. Exchange rates held steady, and sentiment shifted from weak to firm, with only one or two taels of fluctuation in half an hour. At 3:50, the price rose sharply, increasing by more than four taels. At 4:20, the price was seventy-one taels and four qian, and at the 4:30 closing, the price was seventy taels and eight qian, down six taels and seven qian compared to the previous day. It then rose again to slightly above seventy-one taels. Throughout the day, the maximum price was seventy-nine taels, and the minimum was sixty-five and a half taels, resulting in a fluctuation of thirteen and a half taels. Early market for goods was seventy-four and a half taels, noon closing was seventy-two taels, afternoon was one and a half taels, and closing was one tael. The quoted price was calculated with a deduction of around ninety taels. Morning accounts were recorded at seventy-two to sixty-nine taels, with seventy-two taels for additional funds. Afternoon was seventy-four taels, with a deduction of five taels and five qian for the spot market.</p>
<p>Complex trading activity. The trading on the floor was complex. According to statistics, Qianchangxiang, Hengxingyuan, Tongtaichang, Richang, Yuanmaoyong, and Futaiheng all entered. Dadecheng had mixed trading, with a total of over one thousand several hundred transactions. Shunli, Wanxing, Bingxing, Hengxing, Hengchangyong, Yuankangxiang, Yuanmao, and Mr. Wu all exited. Yuantai, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yudai, Dakang, Tongfu, and Dacheng, Zhifengyong had many mixed trades. Yongfeng and Qunchangyong exited and then re-entered. Senchangyong, Tianfengyong, and Chengfengyong entered first and then exited. In the afternoon, Dadecheng, Yuankangxiang, Shunli, Wanxing, and Futaiheng all entered. Fuchang, Yuantai, Yudai, Zhifengyong exited and entered alternately. Yuanmaoyong, Taifengcheng, Yifengyong, and Hengchangyong all exited. Dalian dealers had three thousand two hundred to three thousand three hundred transactions, breaking even. Guangdong dealers had three to four hundred transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Exchange Market Slightly Loosened <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British and American silver markets both fell. However, exchange rates were still prone to decline. HSBC's listed exchange rates for British, Indian, and Po equaled no changes. US dollars decreased by seven-five, to 31.5 yuan, mainly due to small exchange settlements. French francs decreased by fifteen yuan, and Japanese yen decreased by three shields. German exchange decreased by two and a half marks. Hong Kong added .0625, calculated at 76.75 taels, likely due to domestic markets loosening early, then firming, and then loosening again. The afternoon was particularly strong, resulting in an increase of five-sixths for British gold compared to the previous day. However, US dollars only increased by .0625, forming a stable situation, leading to an even greater distance between the gold market hedging positions. The morning was outside sixty taels to sixty-five or sixty-six taels. The afternoon was slightly closer, calculated at fifty-seven or fifty-eight taels. When the gold market reopened with a small face, it briefly broke into the seventy tael range. Transactions in Chinese commercial drafts were not as prevalent as the previous day, but there were some settlements. There were few transactions in the afternoon market. British gold traded in about sixty to seventy thousand pounds, and US dollars traded in a total of four to five hundred thousand yuan. Major traders may anticipate an upward trend.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The domestic market had a difference of half a penny throughout the day. The morning offer was approximately one shilling and nine pence. Buying price was one-two-five. HSBC absorbed February at 1875, and Shanghai entered January at twenty-five. The noon closing offer was three-seven-five, and the buying price was four-three-seven-five. In the afternoon, Mackellar entered January at four-three-seven-five. Holland and San Bing traded half a penny. The closing offer was 19.4375, and the buying price was half a penny.</p>
<p>American Exchange: The domestic market fluctuated by .625. The early market offer was 32.25 yuan, and the buying price was 32.375. Pan Gen Mackellar offered January at 32.125 yuan, and East Asia offered March at twenty-five. Shanghai San Bing offered January-February at 3125, Mackellar offered January at twenty-five, Shanghai offered March at 1875, East Asia offered December at 1875, Huabi offered January at 375. The noon closing offer was five-six-two-five, and the buying price was six-eight-seven-five. In the afternoon, Mackellar and Yun Tong traded January at six-two-five, Zhengjin and HSBC traded February at six-two-five, and San Bing Pan Gen traded February at seventy-five. The closing offer was 32.5625 yuan, and the buying price was 6875. One US dollar equaled 3.17460 taels of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e129">British and American Silver Prices Both Retreated <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegrams, the recent British silver price retreated by .1875, calculated at eighteen pence and three-one-two-five. The forward price remained at eighteen and a half pence. The land in China and the United States both entered first and then exited, the market was stable, and the post-closing market was calm. The United States attitude was hesitant, exiting near-term and then entering long-term. The New York telegrams reported that American silver prices had fallen repeatedly. The spot price decreased again by .875, to 29.75 cents. British gold fell sharply against American gold, down 6.75, to 3.66125 yuan. American gold also fell slightly against British gold, down 6.75, calculated at 3.6575 yuan. The British Shanghai shilling decreased by .375, to one shilling and nine pence and three-seven-five. Bombay spot decreased slightly by one anna, to 59 rupees and 01 annas, and forward increased by one anna, to 59 rupees and 05 annas.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Slight Rise in Foreign Interest, Easing of Silver Supply <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, there wasn't much change in foreign interest rates. However, regarding silver supply, banks were able to issue large amounts of secured loans, which eased the market atmosphere and lowered silver interest rates. Overnight loans were especially loose and prevalent. However, the overall market situation remains unstable due to national affairs, hindering business development. Consequently, those currently lacking silver and seeking financial assistance are lamenting their difficulties.</p>
<p>Interest Rate and Overnight Loan Prices: (Foreign Interest) Interest rates remained stable due to balanced supply and demand. The morning rate was 7.2445%, and the afternoon rate was 7.24875%, a slight increase of 0.0025% compared to the previous day.

Overnight loans with added interest were even more lenient, starting at 0.0134% and eventually dropping to only 0.0089%. Bank rates were listed at 0.016%.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The morning rate for Jiangsu small silver coins was 0.0649%, and the afternoon rate was 0.0647%, a difference of 0.0002% between the two sessions. Trading volume was 7,000 角 (jiao) in the morning and 2,500 角 in the afternoon. The morning rate for Guangdong small silver coins was also 0.0649%, and the afternoon rate was 0.064975%. Trading volume was 220,000 角 in the morning and 95,000 角 in the afternoon. Copper coins were traded at 379,500 文 (wen).</p>

<p>Market Closed for Three Days Starting Today for Settlement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Securities Exchange's November futures settlement period has arrived. Trading will be suspended from today onwards to facilitate various procedures before settlement. Today, initial account clearing will take place, with formal settlement scheduled for this Friday. This month's settlement volume is less than the approximately 20 million in October, so accounting will not be as heavy as before. Regarding yesterday's bond market conditions, spot transactions remained scarce, while futures prices continued to decline sharply, although trading was not entirely quiet. This was mainly due to the imminent settlement, leading to more transaction closures. However, compared to the previous day, the situation has slightly improved. Given the trend of bond prices, and the increasing influence of the Japanese, coupled with a tense diplomatic situation, the market is generally pessimistic. If there is no turnaround in the future, Sino-Japanese relations may inevitably break down, causing widespread anxiety and fragility in the market. Furthermore, news of new bond issuances further weakens the market. Although major players are not selling off significantly, small-scale sales are quite active. However, buyer sentiment remains extremely cold, with investors adopting a wait-and-see approach, leading to a significant imbalance between supply and demand. Consequently, prices continued to fall sharply, with several bonds nearing trading halts during the morning session. The situation continued to weaken at the start of the afternoon session, before slightly stabilizing by the close. As a result, compared to the previous day, except for the 1926 bonds, which remained stable, all other bonds fell by about two to three yuan, with the Reorganization bonds for November falling by a significant four yuan and three jiao. The bond market remains pessimistic. However, if the overall situation turns around, improvement is not impossible. Total spot transactions for the day amounted to 6,000 yuan, with futures transactions totaling over 8.1 million in the morning and over 4.4 million in the afternoon, adding up to 12.51 million yuan.</p>

<p>South China Merchants Actively Trading Spot Goods</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and stabilized in the afternoon, with a slight upward trend. However, the national situation remains turbulent, and Japanese aggression is intensifying, making it difficult to ease financial conditions and boost morale. Only the South China region is actively purchasing fine yarn, providing some impetus to the market. In general, the unstable situation limits upward momentum.</p>
<p>Near-Term Futures Rise, Distant Futures Fall: At the opening of the People's Standard (人標) market, there was a shortage of sellers in the market, and the market situation was firm. Prices for all months rose by 6.9 to 1.3 cents. In the afternoon, the current month remained strong, while distant months fell by 1.35 cents. Total transactions were 28,000 bales. Yichang (益昶) sold 750 bales, Yongda (永大) sold 550 bales, and Deji (德記) sold 500 bales. Gongtai (公泰) bought 1,250 bales, and Taixing (泰興) bought 1,950 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>1,500 Bales of Spot Goods Sold: Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that various merchants bought a total of 1,300 bales throughout the day. Domestic traders purchased 200 bales. The market is firm. Among the customer groups, Guangdong bought 1,000 bales, Shantou bought 90 bales, Jiangxi bought 50 bales, inland buyers bought 50 bales, and miscellaneous buyers bought 50 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Cotton Market Feels More Relaxed <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak. Due to stagnant actual sales and increasing supplies from various sources, many bullish Han merchants are now selling off. Additionally, tight silver conditions make it even harder for those receiving goods this month. The market atmosphere is becoming increasingly relaxed. However, Ningbo merchants remain firm and maintain a bullish position. Overseas cotton markets are still weak, and the outlook is mostly bearish.</p>
<p>Near-Term Cotton Falls by 6.5 Cents: At the opening of the Han Standard (漢標) market, the market atmosphere was flat. The current month fell by 3 cents, while distant months rose by 1.5 cents. In the afternoon, the current month fell by another 3.5 cents, while distant months fell by 1.2 cents. Total transactions for the day were 81,500 dan. Shenchang (愼昌) sold 7,800 dan, Heshen (和愼) sold 2,800 dan, Yuda (裕大) sold 2,400 dan, and Ruiyuan (瑞源) sold 2,600 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market showed mixed trends due to Wall Street's weakness and factory purchases. Futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 2 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. Both British cotton futures and spot prices rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton saw slight purchases from Japanese traders, and the market was firm. Pingguoer rose by 3.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 2.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 23rd):</p>

<p>Nan Tou: Yesterday, the supply remained at 30 to 40 units, while the inventory in Pu was increasing daily. Sales in urban and rural stores were significantly reduced due to the increasingly tight silver supply and subdued sentiment. Moreover, the poor quality of goods made quick sales difficult, leading to a gradual decline. The price of thick, newly harvested japonica rice slightly decreased by about 0.02 yuan. There was a small amount of early and late rice, with steady outflows on Benjie Street but thin sales among Ningbo merchants, resulting in a price decrease of nearly 0.01 yuan. Although the sales of Du Yangjian rice were not smooth, the low inventory provided some support, but market sales were sluggish.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: Yesterday, 36 or 37 boats arrived, and sales were even more scarce than the previous market session. Top-quality West Xin rice fell by 0.02 yuan, while medium and lower-quality rice dropped by 0.03 yuan, showing a rapid decline. The kilns were the weakest, with abundant arrivals but no transactions, leading to a gradual decline in prices. There were some sales of Yang Dujian rice, with the market sitting firmly. Old and broken goods were scarce and did not fluctuate much, with the price hovering around 2 yuan, and limited spot transactions were observed for top-quality goods. Liquor merchants were sluggish, and prices were adjusted by about 0.01 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Ben Jie Street Still Actively Selling Spot Foreign Rice <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw active spot sales on Ben Jie Street, while other merchants had no inquiries. However, the continuous sales within Ben Jie Street helped support the market, and recent orders and arrivals were limited. Due to high costs, sellers were unwilling to lower prices, allowing the market to stabilize. If large-scale customer orders were to materialize, prices could rise immediately. Yesterday, there was only one new transaction for foreign rice: 500 tons of Saigon rice for January delivery, priced at 5.40 yuan, purchased by Ben Jie Street merchants. Other transactions were not yet opened, and foreign firms were not as aggressively purchasing as before, leading to hopes of market stabilization. Small batches of returned goods were offered, with 500-600 tons for March delivery priced at 4.99 yuan and 5.02 yuan for April delivery, and 5.07 yuan for May delivery, all showing signs of stabilization compared to previous levels.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Slight Activity in the Flour Market <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market generally showed a fluctuating trend. In the morning sessions, wheat quotations from overseas decreased by about 0.06-0.07 yuan, causing most market participants to soften their stance. The lowest price for the current month fell to 1.89 yuan, setting a new low for previous months. Distant months also decreased by varying amounts of about 0.01 yuan. However, later sessions saw a slight improvement. The current month rose due to spot sales and withdrawals, while distant months continued to see purchases from non-industry buyers, leading to a recovery in the market. At the afternoon opening, the current month continued to fluctuate due to tight credit conditions, while distant months saw more active buying due to positive sentiment from non-industry players, improving by nearly 0.01 yuan compared to the morning. However, the future outlook remains uncertain if spot sales do not improve. As a result, the current month improved by 0.0005 yuan compared to the previous day, December improved by 0.0175 yuan, January improved by 0.0125 yuan, February improved by 0.01 yuan, March improved by 0.015 yuan, and April improved by 0.01 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Wheat Market Turns from Flat to Firm <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market generally showed a pattern of initial flatness followed by firmness. Initially, the decrease in overseas wheat quotations by 0.06-0.07 yuan caused uncertainty. However, a slight improvement in the flour market led to slightly better buying sentiment, and near-term and distant months recovered by about 0.02-0.03 yuan compared to the morning's lowest prices. However, since the current month required immediate delivery, and mills were not actively taking delivery due to poor flour sales, prices were likely to remain around 0.04 yuan. Distant months were able to hold their ground due to continued accumulation by non-industry buyers. Future fluctuations will depend on flour sales. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, December improved by 0.01 yuan, January improved by 0.02 yuan, February and March improved by 0.03 yuan, and April improved by 0.03 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Pushed Up by Foreign Exchange <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw telegrams from producing regions indicating no arrivals of Cuban spot sugar or New York sugar futures. Spot and futures prices in Java remained unchanged from previous levels. Market prices in the association's trading sessions increased due to the appreciation of foreign exchange, slightly improving sentiment. Sellers raised prices, with the transaction price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sand being 10.075 yuan, rising to 10.10 yuan in the later session. No. 20 medium white sand was priced at 9.875 yuan, and finely ground white sand was priced at 10.15 yuan, all showing strong trends. Taikoo sugar trading was particularly quiet, with B-mark at 11.55 yuan, DY-mark at 11.50 yuan, HX-mark at 11.40 yuan, and HM-mark at 11.10 yuan. Sellers were scarce, but prices were 0.05 yuan higher and stronger than the previous session. Medium-grade sugars were quite lively.</p>

<p>Sales of Sichuan preserved mustard tubers (榨菜) have remained sluggish, and few goods are being shipped out, making sales prospects bleak. As a result, the market has weakened slightly. Export merchants in the northern route have seen few transactions due to the current situation, while domestic sales on Benjie Street are also limited to sporadic transactions. Yesterday, the market price was 19 yuan, down to 16-17 yuan for lower grades. The subsequent market will depend on whether sales improve.</p>

<p>Chinese and Foreign Traders Disagree on Silk Prices by 30-40 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk market for foreign traders in this port remained unimproved. Although Shanghai silk mills discussed prices with American traders for Bai Changjing silk, no agreement was reached due to price discrepancies, and transactions were pending. The highest price offered by American traders was 860 taels for Grade 80 silk, while French traders offered only 890 taels for 13-15-thread silk (Grade B). The mills insisted on prices of 890-930 taels before selling, a difference of 30-40 taels, making it difficult to reach an agreement. Yesterday, Bai Xing bought five bales of hand-reeled silk, and Maihe and others bought 20 bales of Baiganjing silk, with prices remaining stable.</p>

<p>Factory Sales Stagnant... Double Extra Grade Only Opening at 220 Francs</p>
<p>Due to economic panic in the Lyon market, silk inventories are high and sales are sluggish. The demand for raw silk materials has decreased, and the number of silk mills suspending operations is increasing daily. Italian silk factory sales remain stagnant, and silk prices are gradually declining. Extra-grade silk is only opening at 220 francs per kilogram, special grade at 188 francs, and superior grade at 151 francs, with more availability than demand.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market in this port saw green tea from various routes, including Lvzhuang and Tuzhuang, purchased by British firms such as Jinlong, Xiehe, Tongfu, and Qianyi. Trading was quite active, with prices remaining similar to previous levels. Recently, over 6,000 boxes of green teas such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei Needle have been sold, leaving an inventory of only 10,000 boxes. Chinese tea merchants, with limited inventory, have adopted a firm stance.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Metals: Metals Market Remains Calm <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's metals market was calm due to tight credit conditions, with few purchases from various merchants. There were no large transactions to report. The foreign exchange rate has been tightening in recent days. In the past, this situation would have caused prices to rebound, but due to oversupply and sluggish actual sales, prices remain weak. Although industry members are motivated to raise prices to protect their investments, unfavorable conditions make it difficult to do so, leading to a bleak outlook. Yesterday, 600-700 dan of scrap iron was offered. New goods, such as 3-6 foot smokestack iron, thin white iron from British goods, new lead wire, and French Xiding nails, saw some inquiries, but other goods attracted little interest.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Guangdong Representatives: Important Discussions Held Yesterday <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Decision to Send Wu Chaoshu to Guangdong for Explanation</p>
<p>In addition to the Central Fourth Plenary Session, which concluded the day before yesterday, the Guangdong side currently has some opinions regarding the dual election issue in the seven preliminary peace conference resolutions, seemingly creating some setbacks for the future of peace. After the Central Government sent representatives such as Chen Mingshu to Shanghai for explanation, the situation became more optimistic. Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaoshu, Zou Lu, and representatives Ma Chaojun and Tan Zhen, who were sent to Shanghai by the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session, convened a meeting at 6 PM last night to discuss remedial measures. The representatives deliberated until 7 PM before dispersing. According to Wang Jingwei, he and Mr. Hu Zhantang have decided not to return to Guangdong. Regarding this minor setback, in addition to immediately informing the Guangdong Extraordinary Conference by telegram, they also decided to send Mr. Wu Chaoshu, along with several military advisors from the Extraordinary Conference, back to Guangdong to report to the members of the Extraordinary Conference in person. The departure date of Wu and others has not yet been determined. Peace is not in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Regarding Guangzhou's Potential Veto of Peace Conference Resolutions</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspapers reported that the Fourth National Congress in Guangzhou on the 23rd had potentially vetoed the resolutions of the seven peace conferences. Guangdong representative Wang Jingwei issued the following statement to various news agencies yesterday: (Question) It is rumored that the Fourth National Congress in Guangzhou recently experienced setbacks in recognizing the resolutions of the peace conference. Is this true? (Wang's Answer) For several years, political disputes have unfortunately been resolved through military means. After Mr. Cai Ziming, Zhang Puquan, and Chen Zhenru arrived in Guangdong, I believed that a political solution was possible and devoted all my efforts to this. If the Guangzhou National Government's cancellation of the telegram and Mr. Jiang's resignation telegram could have been issued sooner, the setbacks could have been reduced. Although obstacles have inevitably arisen, I firmly believe that future disputes should be resolved through political methods and will continue to work hard, not disheartened by minor setbacks.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Wu Tiecheng Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Reports on Central Government's Hope <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Special Foreign Affairs Committee Responds to Guangdong Representatives' Letter</p>
<p>Complete Agreement on Measures Regarding Japan</p>
<p>Requests Hu Jingwei and Others to Go to Beijing Immediately for Discussions</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the Fourth Plenary Session the day before yesterday, Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng took a train to Shanghai that night and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. He immediately visited the Guangdong representatives in Shanghai to discuss matters. It is reported that Wu's discussion concerned the opening of the Central Fourth Plenary Session and the election of the Fourth Central Committee members. In order to achieve unity within the party and unification of the country, the Central Fourth Plenary Session fully accepted the measures proposed by the Guangdong comrades at the Shanghai Preparatory Meeting. Wu also conveyed the Central Government's intention and hoped that the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session would achieve a unanimous and satisfactory outcome. Regarding the Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaoshu, and Zou San's letter to the Central representatives on the 20th of this month regarding opinions on diplomatic relations with Japan, Wu also replied. The Central Special Foreign Affairs Committee entrusted Wu to reply to Wang and others as follows: Respectful regards to Mr. Wu Tiecheng. Mr. Cai Ziming forwarded the letter from Jingwei, Ti Yun, and Haibin, inquiring about three points. We have entrusted Mr. Cai Ziming to reply in detail to the three gentlemen. We are immensely grateful for the gentlemen's constant guidance. The current situation has become increasingly serious, and the Central Government is short-staffed and busy. Meetings are held daily from 7 AM to plan the day's response measures. After the meetings, telegrams are issued. The gentlemen should be well aware of this situation. Documents have accumulated to over a thousand pages. Our daily prayer is for the Guangdong comrades to come quickly to take charge. We have recently received a letter from the three gentlemen to Mr. Cai Ziming and others, the main point of which is that our country's representatives should invoke the precedent of Heep in the League of Nations Administrative Council and ask Briand to handle the Sino-Japanese incident using the same methods and means, and that treaty issues should not be discussed during this critical period. This is completely in agreement with the measures we have taken this time. Since the incident occurred, our country has appealed to the League of Nations based on the covenant because the League of Nations had previously resolved similar international disputes. Now that the matter is the same, the precedent can be followed. Ambassador Shi invoked the precedent at the Administrative Council meeting, and the Heep case was among them. We are now continuing to work hard to achieve the goals of preserving our country's territorial sovereignty and safeguarding international justice. However, what the members of the Central Government have consistently hoped for is that the gentlemen must come to Beijing quickly to discuss and handle the matter together. If this can be done, then there will be infinite benefits both externally and internally. The severity of the situation far exceeds the gentlemen's concerns. For the sake of the country and the party, we earnestly request that Mr. Zhantang, Jingwei, Ti Yun, Haibin, Zhesheng and others immediately come to Beijing. After arriving in Shanghai, please visit the gentlemen, explain everything here in detail, and do your best to persuade the gentlemen to prioritize the overall situation and come regardless. Because this kind of serious, urgent and troublesome situation can only be resolved through direct discussion. Being hundreds of miles apart, indirect communication through letters and telegrams means that we are already using the same claims and methods as those employed here. As for other important issues that must be discussed, it is not possible to consult frequently, which is very uneconomical. Not to mention the reduction in the unified strength of external affairs. Our sincerity is evident. Please convey this well and accept our best wishes. Respectfully, the Central Special Foreign Affairs Committee, Dai Chuanxian signed, November 23rd.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Various Sectors Urge Chiang to Go North <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Minnan Association Telegram: The Minnan Sojourners Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang yesterday, which read: "Respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government: The invaders are wreaking havoc, destroying our three provinces with rampant looting, arson, and murder. The heavens are darkened. Looking around, the military forces within the country mostly appear cowardly and shrinking back. Upon the arrival of the enemy, they surrender their arms and cede territory. When the enemy retreats, they commit atrocities and claim honors. To execute a resister is an unprecedented disgrace in history. (To surrender a city deserves death.) It is the ultimate shame of humanity. If the Party and the nation have discipline, such people should have been brought to justice long ago. Temporarily setting military law aside, the government may have its difficulties. However, one can redeem oneself through meritorious service, and lost territory should be quickly recovered. Recently, we read in the newspapers that Your Excellency is determined to resist Japan and that Chiang will go north to annihilate the enemy. This is what the entire nation prays for and what all the people expect. The survival of China depends on this, and the rise or fall of the five ethnic groups is determined by this. From now on, let us unite against foreign aggression, and let all compatriots share the same hatred. If anyone appeases Japan or harms our own people, the national traitors will not escape the national law. We are cleansed and prepared, awaiting the departure of your banners. We offer food and drink, willing to be your rearguard. Respectfully, the Minnan Sojourners Association bows in reverence."</p>
<p>China Industrial Chemistry Research Institute Telegram: The China Industrial Chemistry Research Institute sent a telegram to Chiang, saying: "Respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang of the National Government: The Japanese invaders are behaving ferociously, occupying our eastern provinces. All Chinese people are filled with indignation. In the past two months, national rights have been lost one after another, while the great powers have indulged the aggressors. The League of Nations is indeed unreliable, as expected. The only plan now is to unite and resist. We would rather be shattered jade to maintain national integrity than remain whole and be ridiculed for ten thousand generations to come. The revival of the Three People's Principles depends on this war, whether we fight or not. We have recently heard that Your Excellency will soon depart north to recover lost territory. Any of our people with a shred of conscience will sincerely support you and rush to the forefront. Even if our bodies are wrapped in horse hides, our deaths will be honorable. Our institute is dedicated to saving the nation through industry. In this critical time of survival, we vow to be a strong rearguard, using military chemistry technology to fulfill our national duty. Looking eastward to Liaoning, our eyes are tearing apart. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully, all the staff of the China Industrial Chemistry Research Institute bow in reverence."</p>
<p>Huining Association Telegram: The Huining Sojourners Association in Shanghai yesterday telegraphed Chairman Chiang, stating: "Respectfully addressed to the Party branches and governments of all provinces, as well as all public organizations and compatriots across the country: We recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, which read: 'Respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government: The Japanese bandits are wreaking havoc, committing acts of aggression and occupation. Since the loss of Liaoning and Jilin, the enemy's flames have grown stronger. Recently, they have concentrated all their efforts on attacking Heilongjiang, relying on their strength to seize and occupy, acting unilaterally. Fortunately, Chairman Ma vowed to defend the country and bravely resisted the enemy. Knowing that an isolated army in a remote area is difficult to withstand a stubborn enemy, he has nevertheless assumed the responsibility of defending the territory and has engaged in fierce battles for several weeks, demonstrating unwavering loyalty. The Battle of Nenjiang sent chills down the enemy's spine. However, due to exhaustion of supplies and ammunition, he had no choice but to retreat. The news of this defeat brought tears of blood. At this critical moment, with the nation on the brink of collapse, relying on the League of Nations will lead nowhere. Our last hope lies in self-determination. We read in the newspapers that Your Excellency declared at the Fourth Plenary Session that you would go north to serve the Party and the nation, demonstrating a spirit of struggle and upholding the revolutionary history. We urge you to lead a large army and depart immediately to recover lost territory and eliminate the Japanese invaders. We have also read the telegram from General Zhang Fakui, requesting to join the fight, sharing the same determination as Your Excellency, demonstrating public spirit and loyalty to the country, which is deeply moving. We also request that you facilitate the mobilization of the Fourth Army to raid the Japanese lairs and flatten the three islands, bringing glory to the nation. With this one move, our association vows to wholeheartedly support you and share the national hatred. As for the senior officials of the northeastern provinces, who bear heavy responsibilities and command hundreds of thousands of troops, they have actually abandoned Liaoning and Jilin with the three words "no resistance" and now fail to support Heilongjiang, allowing it to fall. Based on the responsibility of defending the territory, we urge the government to issue a clear order to remove them from their posts to appease the people. We implore you with tears to consider this.' We hope that everyone will unite and cry out together to avert the crisis. Our thoughts are with you as we send this telegram, and we pray without end. Respectfully, the Huining Sojourners Association bows in reverence."</p>
<p>City Federation Branch Telegram: The telegram says: "Respectfully addressed to Commander-in-Chief Chiang of the Nanjing National Government's Army, Navy, and Air Force: The country has troops to defend the country. The people's hard-earned wealth is used to supply their needs. No matter the burden, the people do not care. Now the country is about to perish, not to Japan, but to ourselves. How can we sit idly by after losing three provinces? Our country has weapons and soldiers. When will we use them to resist the Japanese invaders? The citizens deeply feel the crisis of national affairs. Saving the country is saving ourselves. The only way is to resolve ourselves to request that weapons be distributed to the national salvation volunteer army, willing to be the vanguard to kill the enemy, and to implement the three points of the anti-Japanese associations of various universities. In addition, the citizens will make a final stand. We hope that the people of the whole country will unite and, with our last breath, fight against the Japanese invaders and fight to the death to determine our survival. Do not weaken ourselves further and sit idly by, waiting for death. In addition to telegraphing General Xiang Hua, requesting him to send troops to punish Japan and advance rapidly to fight for the survival of the country, we are deeply saddened and tearful at the prospect of national demise. We especially pour out our words, feeling extremely urgent and awaiting orders. The 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 22nd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, and 30th district branches of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation kowtow together."</p>
<h3 id="e150">Cantonese Representatives Understand Issuance of Financial Bonds <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Shouyong Says Total is 16 Million</p>
<p>75% Discount, Actually Receives 12 Million</p>
<p>According to a report from Huadong News Agency, concerning the Ministry of Finance's issuance of the 20th Year financial bonds, a senior official from the Ministry of Finance told a Huadong News Agency reporter yesterday that the Ministry of Finance, in light of the current national crisis, should drastically reduce all central military and administrative expenses. Therefore, all administrative expenses are issued at half the original amount, and military expenses have been reduced to 7.5 million per month. This, compared to the total national military expenses of 16 million per month for the central government, Northeast, and Shanxi, as determined in the previous Economic Conference, has already been reduced by more than half. However, even with various cuts, the annual budget still has a shortfall of more than 12 million. Hence, the proposal to issue financial bonds. The Cantonese representatives, due to a misunderstanding, sent a letter to the Shanghai banking community, urging them not to participate in the sale. However, after Minister Song met with Mr. Wang Jingwei a few days ago, they have already understood. In this critical time, the nation's finances should strive for stability. If an economic panic were to occur and lead to other changes, the consequences would be unimaginable. Both Nanjing and Guangzhou are eager for peaceful unification and are very sincere. They also express sympathy for stabilizing the nation's finances. Once explained, they all understood, so there is no problem with the issuance. At the same time, the people of the whole country should also understand that the Ministry of Finance repays approximately 15 million in principal and interest on foreign debt each month. Therefore, the issuance of this bond does not increase the original debt amount. As for the total amount of issuance, the banking community said it was 12 million. According to Vice Minister Zhang Shouyong of the Ministry of Finance, the total amount of issuance is 16 million. Because it is necessary to borrow from the banking community at a 75% discount, the actual amount received is 12 million. Hence, the misunderstanding of the total amount of issuance being 12 million. The original intention of the Ministry of Finance this time is completely in line with the unified financial committee plan produced during the peace conference.</p>

Resolution: Handed over to the Investigation Department for further investigation and verification. (2) A letter from Dingxin Company, which manages the Shanghai Hexing New Record Steel Factory, regarding the Japanese coking coal purchased on July 7.

How should this be handled? Resolution: Reply in a letter that it is difficult to accommodate at present. After the entire method is decided, a letter will be sent for notification. (3) A letter from Guangde Store, stating that since the Shenyang Incident occurred, they have returned goods to Kobe, but the Japanese merchant did not agree and insisted on fulfilling the contract and demanded payment for the unpaid goods.

Resolution: Reply in a letter, asking them to find a way to terminate the contract. (4) A letter from the Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association, requesting proof that the Huada Tobacco Company, a member of the association, produces cigarettes, and requesting to forward a letter to the Haikou City Chamber of Commerce for proof.

(9) Secretary Zhao Shusheng proposed that recently, the Public Concession police have arbitrarily detained staff members of this association, affecting the association's work. It should be requested that this association send separate letters to the Public Concession and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, explaining that the staff members of this association are ordered to perform their duties within the concession and are not disturbing public order. Please stop the above actions and provide assistance at any time. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision on the case.

If any inspectors of this association are arrested, the branch associations of each district will be responsible for providing proof and bail. (10) The Nanshi Inspection Office has detained 36 bags of salmon from Anli Foreign Firm. How should this be handled? Resolution: Handed over to the Investigation Department for investigation. If it is of Russian origin, release it.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese Association states that recently, when staff members perform their duties in the concession, the Public Concession Police Department often detains them. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, requesting them to send a special letter to the Public Concession to stop the interference, and separate letters were sent to Hua Chinese lawyer Ru Baoyi and others of the Police Department, requesting them to correct the interference of the various Police Departments at any time. The letter said, "Regarding the fact that recently, the Public Concession Police Department has often arbitrarily detained and sent to the court staff members of this association who are ordered to perform their duties within the concession, which has greatly affected the future of the association's work. It is important to know that since the establishment of this association, its purpose has been to resist Japan and save the country, entrusted by all the citizens of the city. This is a matter of the patriotic movement, and any Chinese person has a patriotic heart and should not be arbitrarily harmed. Moreover, the inspectors of this association perform their inspection duties in accordance with the regulations of this association, wearing badges and staff certificates with their own photos attached for identification. The inspection procedures are also carried out in accordance with the prescribed procedures and have been announced in the newspapers. Since its establishment, there have been no incidents of disturbing public order. The above actions of the Police Department are regrettable. We hereby request your association to uphold justice, forward a letter to the Public Concession, and instruct the various Police Departments to not allow the above incidents to occur again, in order to value diplomatic relations and maintain the association's work. To the level of public friendship, this is addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association announced in its 18th public notice yesterday that the Japanese goods sealing survey form has been printed. The notice stated that the 14th Executive Committee meeting of the association resolved that "the method for handling sealed Japanese goods should be drafted after investigation and statistics."

<p>Solemn Declaration by the Third District, Fourth Branch</p>
<p>The Third District, Fourth Branch declares: "Alas, the violent Japanese invasion of China has lasted more than two months. Relying on the League of Nations, it is difficult to uphold justice. Relying on military force, the time has not yet arrived. The only shield is our people's spirit as a permanent shield to save the dying national soul. To sever economic ties with Japan, even women and children know that it can control their fate. How should we encourage each other to obtain the final victory? Unexpectedly, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce's Committee for Implementing the Economic Severance of Ties with Japan has set up a method for unsealing Japanese goods for public sale, fundamentally forgetting its mission and completely corrupting its heart and liver. The committee members are either not Chinese citizens or not of the Chinese nation, otherwise how could they bear to issue this? The economic severance of ties with Japan has been carried out nine times in our country. Whenever it is initiated, the merchants with the hearts of wolves and lungs of dogs all try their best to smuggle in large quantities of enemy goods for profit. Unfortunately, if they are found during inspection, they only have to pay a certain percentage of donations. On the one hand, it helps merchants to accumulate wealth, and on the other hand, it announces the influx of enemy goods. This is most sufficient to reveal weakness in the national spirit, which is enough to make us all tear our hair out in anger. The committee of the association, whose duty is to implement the economic severance of ties with Japan, has now turned into an agency for selling enemy goods. At night, they should search their hearts and ask themselves how they can face the country, the people, their ancestors, and their descendants. If the set method is implemented, the import of Japanese goods will suddenly increase, and Chinese wealth will flow to Japan. Not only will the dying Japanese revive, but our people, known as 400 million, will no longer have any patriotic courage to show. Our party follows the teachings of the leader and is determined to save the country and the people. We cannot bear to let a few selfish villains take the opportunity to carry out actions to destroy the country. We dare to shout loudly to awaken our fellow compatriots with hot blood to rise up and urgently seek rectification, making a good plan to save the country and ensuring the long-term survival of the race. We vow to oppose the sale of Japanese goods and always implement the original intention of resisting Japan. This is a special declaration. November 24, 1931."</p>

<h3 id="e157">Youth Automatic Northeast Anti-Japanese Corps Held Two Member General Meetings Yesterday <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Sent Representatives to Meet Zhang Fakui</p>
<p>The Youth Automatic Northeast Anti-Japanese Corps has been holding registration for volunteers at the Sichuan Road YMCA for days. 250 people have officially decided to fill out the forms and register. A reporter from Guowen News Agency reviewed the registration forms yesterday, which included about one-third of university and middle school students and those who have received higher military education and have held military positions. People from all walks of life in industry and commerce have participated. The corps held its second member general meeting yesterday and elected representatives to meet with Zhang Fakui. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Member Meetings: At 1:00 PM yesterday, the corps held its second member general meeting in the meeting room on the second floor of the YMCA. 140 people attended. Zhang Shaojie chaired, and Zhu Dajun recorded. (1) Discuss the organization outline. Resolution: Establish four sections under the cadre meeting: general affairs, training, organization, and propaganda. The personnel for the positions will be decided at the next meeting. (2) Elect representatives to meet with Zhang Fakui. Resolution: Elect Zhang Shaojie as the corps representative to visit Mr. Zhang. (3) Funding issues. Currently, it is maintained by the responsible persons' advances, all out of patriotic enthusiasm, not to form a corps to seek fame and reputation. It is inevitable that more will be spent when departing in the future, so donations must be raised from all sectors. Resolution: Handle it appropriately when the time is right. At the same time, request the Life Weekly to assist in raising the costs of future departures.</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui's Conversation: The corps sent representatives Zhang Shaojie and others yesterday to discuss with Mr. Zhang Fakui at his residence in Shanghai. (Q) When will you send troops to the Northeast? (A) Now that General Ma is isolated and helpless, and in imminent danger, it is imperative to send troops, but the date has not yet been decided. (Q) If the government does not allow you to go, what are your plans? (A) I firmly believe that the government will not prevent it. I am patriotic, but the procedures must be approved by the government. If it is not allowed, I will hand over the weapons to him and go empty-handed. I will die in the Northeast. (Q) Our comrades have now decided to go, and no matter what, they must go to the Northeast to assist. We are determined to use our blood to assist General Ma. We do not know what your intentions are. (A) Our patriotism is all sincere. I deeply admire the determination and enthusiasm of your comrades. In the current bad environment, it is admirable that you are gathering pure youth to sacrifice themselves to save the country. I am very grateful to you all. As comrades, I am willing to help. (Q) Our comrades are all empty-handed. Can you help with weapons? (A) We are all patriotic and killing the enemy. If I have weapons, I will do my best to provide them. (Q) Your praise for our comrades' actions is deeply ashamed. We do not know what your guidance is. (A) Your enthusiastic youth are automatically going to the Northeast to assist Ma in resisting Japan. All Chinese people should sympathize. However, you must coordinate funding, organize strictly, and maintain a stable position, proceeding according to your corps' purpose and plan. There will certainly be no problems. Finally, Mr. Zhang explained that the members of the corps are very pure, and their position is entirely for patriotism. Therefore, with the iron blood and to seek national survival, they are willing to shed blood first to awaken the general public. Whoever declares war on Japan will be the vanguard, and they have decided on the plan and steps to die. Commander Zhang was very sympathetic and hoped to work hard to fight to the end and added encouragement.</p>

<p>Aid-Heilongjiang Rescue Team Passes Through Beijing and Arrives in Pingjin</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Schools Sent to Offer Condolences</p>
<p>Collecting Winter Clothing and Medicinal Materials for Departure</p>
<p>The Aid-Heilongjiang Rescue Team of the Zhenru Southeastern Medical College departed on the 19th of this month. They stopped in Nanjing to make contacts with various parties and stayed for a day. After arriving in Beijing, they immediately sent representatives to the Ministry of Railways to request free tickets, which was approved. The Sheng Sheng Pharmacy generously donated gas mask prevention medications. Representatives from various schools sent condolences and various kinds of food. The next morning (the 21st) at 10:00 AM, they crossed the river and boarded the Jin-Bei train northward. It is also reported that Shao Zhuoran, Mao Zhican, and Wu Shiying, three female students from Jiaotong University who accompanied the team, were dissuaded from going to Beijing and returned to Shanghai by representatives from the university. The female students, unable to accompany the team, were extremely saddened and donated their travel expenses of seventy-five yuan and a map to the Southeastern Rescue Team, demonstrating admirable generosity and enthusiasm. The following telegram from the rescue team is recorded for the Southeastern Medical College to pass on to various organizations: Our team arrived in Pingjin yesterday. Heavy snow is falling. We are staying at the Chamber of Commerce and are currently collecting winter clothing and medicinal materials. We pledge to do our utmost to rescue and protect the soldiers who are resisting the enemy and defending the country and will never return empty-handed. We urgently need assistance to enable us to proceed. The Rescue Team bows.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Zhang Fakui Corrects Lu Fengshi's Remarks <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Resisting Japan in the North is a Major National and Ethnic Affair</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Zhang Fakui said yesterday that Mr. Lu Fengshi came to discuss the matter of resisting Japan. I did meet with him, and we only talked about my determination to resist Japan and that the route I planned to take was through Hunan and Hubei to Beiping, and then, depending on the situation, to coordinate with General Ma Zhanshan. Nothing else was discussed. However, after reading the report in various newspapers on November 24th, Lu Fengshi's published remarks by Zhang Fakui about the route of departure were not entirely truthful. The statements such as "[I would rather follow Chairman Jiang to proceed]," "[I believe I will receive a satisfactory response from both governments]," and "[I am willing to starve to death in Hunan]" are particularly shocking. A country can only have one government; this is an unchangeable principle. The struggle of the entire Fourth Army in the past few years and Fakui's personal stance are universally known and cannot be arbitrarily erased. Now that we are under the leadership of the revolutionary government produced by the Extraordinary Conference, we only know to act according to the revolutionary government produced by the Extraordinary Conference. Why is it necessary to obtain the consent and response of any other party? As for saying that we are willing to starve to death in Hunan without the government's assistance, it is even more absurd. The intention of Mr. Lu in writing these words is unknown. Resisting Japan is a major national and ethnic affair. How can the government and the people remain indifferent? Since there is a government and people as the backing for the anti-Japanese action, how can the anti-Japanese army starve to death?</p>

<p>To Commander Zhang Fakui from the Executive Committee of the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Xin Shenghe Sports Association, Ju Zhao Xi Deng Shou and others: Commander Fakui, upon careful examination, since Jilin fell and Heilongjiang followed, anyone with a heart cannot help but feel pain. The Northeastern Army, once known for its雄霸, collapsed like a mountain at the first sign of foreign aggression. The blue sky and white sun are stained, and the reputation of the revolution is shamed. You, sir, are concerned about the peril of the country and have issued a telegram, causing both sadness and joy. With a call to arms, our rivers and mountains will shine. You are creating a precedent for national salvation among the military and inflicting pain on those who have lost our national territory. We dare to ask that you act on your words. Know that the invading Japanese have already occupied our territory for a long time, making the fortifications solid and difficult to recover. We humbly request that you quickly organize a strong army, depart early, drive the invaders out of the frontier, save our dying country, and rescue our people from under their iron hooves. Our association of more than eight hundred people is willing to be in the vanguard and swear to follow you to the death in the wilderness. We humbly ask for your consideration of our humble opinion and await your instructions. The entire eight hundred members of the Executive Committee of the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Xin Shenghe Sports Association bow.</p>

<p>To Commander Xianghua Zhang Fakui from the various district branches of the Municipal Federation: Commander, upon careful examination, reading your telegram, we are filled with excitement and admiration for your loyalty and dedication. You are fulfilling the duty of a soldier, willing to risk your life in the north and speak out for the country. The whole nation respects you.

We hope that you, Commander, will quickly mobilize, be resolute, and immediately rush to the front lines. Your elite troops will punish the enemy, be loyal to the country, and eliminate the violent invaders. Victory is within reach. We look forward to your efforts to achieve success and national independence. This is what we pray for.

<p>To all comrades of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of National Jinan University, upon careful reading of your telegram, I have learned everything. I am grateful and ashamed for your praise. The brutal Japanese are destroying world peace and invading our country's territory. As a soldier, Fakui has long been willing to lead my troops as the vanguard for the people and eliminate the brutal enemy. However, the great plan of national salvation depends on the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone. All of our compatriots should unite and fight together. I am writing this reply to you. I wish you peace and tranquility. Zhang Fakui bows in reply, November 23rd.</p>

<p>To the Central Committee in Nanjing from the various district branches of the Municipal People's Federation: Under the blue sky and white sun, the Party governs the country, with doctrine as the foundation and the Party as the leader. The foundation of the country lies in upholding the electoral system. Elections should focus on people and emphasize strict governance. Even a single mistake can greatly affect the country. It is the conscience of our party and country to carefully consider this matter. At this Fourth Plenary Session, as the highest organ of the Chinese Kuomintang representative meeting, the character of the elected committee members should be solemnly reviewed. People believe that there should be no omissions in the examination. However, after reading the newspapers, Zhang Xueliang was surprisingly elected as one of the Central Supervisory Committee members. The news has sparked national indignation. A solemn meeting has created a stain. Foreigners ridicule us, and the League of Nations will shame us. Anyone with a conscience cannot help but feel pain. The people across the country have long been aware of the imminent danger of national extinction. Even a three-year-old child knows that Zhang Xueliang is the culprit who has harmed the people and lost our territory. There is no room for favoritism. For the sake of maintaining the national order and prestige, how can we remain silent and become slaves to a fallen nation? Alas, with the country in such a state of ruin, tears are shed. Your department, as the highest organ of the Party, should uphold the blue sky and white sun and execute justice fairly. It should deny Zhang Xueliang's election as a committee member, and even consider punishing him according to national law to warn future generations and appease public anger. We send this telegram to you for your review and consideration. We eagerly await your reply. The third, fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-second, twenty-fourth ,twenty-fifth, twenty sixth, twentyseventh, twenty-eighth, and thirtieth district branches of the Shanghai People's United Association bow.</p>

<p>To the Central Committee from the Lǐjiào United Association: The Lǐjiào United Association sent a telegram to the Central Party Department yesterday, stating that Zhang Xueliang embraced a policy of non-resistance, was overly pro-Japanese, and allowed the three northeastern provinces to be lost. No one has harmed the people and humiliated the country more than him. Among the Lǐjiào public halls of our association, more than a thousand are located in the three northeastern provinces, with a total of more than 300,000 members. They are under iron hooves and live in dire straits. Heartbreaking appeals have been made repeatedly. Our association can only cry out with empty hands. The great disaster was caused by Zhang Xueliang's guilt. At this Fourth Plenary Session, justice should be upheld, and it should be proposed that Zhang Xueliang be punished for his humiliation and loss of national territory. How can we disregard character, disregard the national system, and avoid foreign ridicule and elect him as a supervisory committee member? Such an election is a stain on the history of our Party and country and opens up an unprecedented sense of pain. If the people remain silent, where is their blood? We should ask your department to have the determination of impartiality and resolutely deal with Zhang Xueliang, punish him according to national law, and deny his election as a supervisory committee member to appease the people's anger. We eagerly await your reply. The Lǐjiào United Association bows, November 24th.</p>

<p>Aid to the Striking Workers of Datong Bookstore</p>
<p>The Shanghai Press Workers' Union's declaration to aid the striking workers of Datong Bookstore: Compatriots, hardworking brothers, the suffering of our working class needs no detailed explanation; everyone already knows it. Therefore, it is only natural and right for us workers to make demands on capitalists to improve our treatment, no matter when. The lives of us printing workers have always been very difficult, especially the bookstore workers. Their daily treatment is even worse than that of cattle and horses. Datong Bookstore, although it has strong capital, tall distribution offices, and wide factories, and can earn a lot of money every year, the capitalists of Datong Bookstore will never give the workers any treatment that is beneficial to them. Therefore, the strike of the workers of Datong Bookstore this time to demand conditions is an inevitable result. Their spirit is brave, their emotions are passionate, and all their demands can arouse our infinite sympathy, and we are willing to provide them with strong assistance. There are many people who say that we workers should not strike at this time of national crisis. This statement seems very right on the surface, but in reality, it is completely wrong. We workers understand very well that we should defeat imperialism and fight to protect national interests. At the same time, we also understand that we should improve our treatment and fight against capitalists to make demands. You can't act if you don't have food to eat. How can you participate in the anti-Japanese movement if you don't act? Therefore, participating in the anti-Japanese movement and the movement to improve treatment should go hand in hand. Those who oppose our workers' improvement of treatment under the pretext of Japanese imperialism's invasion are tantamount to starving us workers to death. Therefore, at this time of unrelenting foreign invasion, we should use all our strength to aid the struggle of Datong workers and oppose the capitalists of Datong Bookstore who oppress workers, and all kinds of evil forces. Compatriots, workers, everyone rise up! (1) Aid the workers of Datong Bookstore. (2) Oppose oppression of workers and improve workers' treatment. (3) Oppose oppression of the workers' movement and overthrow the labor traitors and lackeys. (4) Expand our workers' economic struggle and turn it into a revolutionary struggle against Japanese imperialism and against all domestic evil forces. Of course, this union respectfully leads all workers and will also strive and fight under these slogans. Shanghai Press Workers' Union.</p>

<p>It Was Heard That Si Lie's Younger Brother Was Indeed Murdered</p>
<p>Seven corpses of family members of Gu Shunzhang, who were murdered by Communist Party members Zhou Enlai and others, were discovered in the underground of the front courtyard of the houses at numbers 33 and 37, Aiting Village, Yaozhujiao Road, in the French Concession. The corpses were four men and three women. They were temporarily coffined by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, marked with their names, and transported to the autopsy room of Tongren Fuyuan Branch for the autopsy. The details have already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that those exhumed from number 37 were Gu Weizhen, Gu Wu's wife, Zhang Atao, and Zhang Aibao, a father and daughter.

The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters sent Yang Fengqi, the chief of the investigation team, to the scene to await instructions. The forensic doctors ordered the laborers to open the coffin lids one by one, and a stench filled the air, almost making people vomit. This autopsy was the first time that the autopsy room of Tongren Fuyuan Branch had encountered such a case. For the sake of hygiene, special rue, camphor, Dahurian angelica, atractylodes, sandalwood, and other fragrant items were prepared to be burned at the scene to slightly relieve the odor. The two forensic doctors, Wei and Jiang, each wearing rubber gloves, conducted a detailed examination of the corpses in the coffins. However, the coffin marked with Wu Kechang was found to contain a female corpse. It was not possible to identify the name, and it was mistakenly identified at the time of exhumation. In total, there were three men and four women. The hemp ropes around the necks of each corpse were cut off. They were wrapped in three to four or five to six strands, wrapped in paper, and marked with their names. The flesh of the corpses had not yet rotted, but their faces were blurred and unrecognizable. It was determined that each corpse had been strangled to death. After the examination, the prosecutor took the seat and first received a report from Yang Fengqi of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters on the course of the case. Gu Jianzhong, a special commissioner of the Central Party Department, and Huang Kai, an employee of the Garrison Memorial Department, then arrived with Zhang Changgeng, a family member of the deceased. Zhang Changgeng testified that he was sixteen years old, a native of Shanghai, and that the deceased Zhang Atao and Zhang Aizi were his father and second sister. He identified them without error. The other corpses were all relatives of his brother-in-law, Gu Shunzhang, but he was not very familiar with them and it was now even more difficult to identify them. Gu Jianzhong, a special commissioner of the Central Party Department, stated that the names of the deceased were known based on the burial locations provided by the captured criminals. Prosecutor Zhang then recorded on the autopsy report that the deceased Zhang Atao, Zhang Aibao, Zhang Weizhen, and Gu Wu's wife had been identified by the family member Zhang Changgeng. Also, seven corpses, two female and one male, were all strangled to death. It was approved that Zhang Atao and the other four corpses could be claimed and buried by Zhang Changgeng. The three corpses whose names could not be identified would be taken into custody by Gu Jianzhong and Huang Kai, special commissioners of the Central Party Department, and the eight packages of hemp rope would be stored in the Local Court's stolen goods vault. After the autopsy, the prosecutor and others returned to the court to report the findings. The corpses were first prepared with clothing and bedding by the Garrison Headquarters, and then the laborers were ordered to re-coffin them and transport them to the Yanxu Villa (Tianxia Guild Hall) in Zhabei. It was also heard that there were originally rumors that nine corpses were buried in Aiting Village. Now that seven corpses have been exhumed, there may be omissions. Therefore, with the consent of the owner, Pan Zhaobang, numbers 34, 35, and 36 will continue to be excavated and inspected. In addition, four corpses were found yesterday morning in the small garden at number 6, Xiude Lane, Wuding Road, in the Public Concession, after the police sent people to excavate. The excavation time was around 9:30 in the morning. The district chief of the managing Gordon Road Police Station and Chief Inspector Krook also came to supervise the scene. At that time, there were many onlookers, no less than those on Yaozhujiao Road in the French Concession. About two hours after the excavation, a female corpse was discovered, and then more were discovered until a total of four corpses were unearthed. It was heard that the female corpse was the wife, mother-in-law, and female relative of something, and the male corpse was said to be the younger brother of Si Lie. Afterwards, they were all transported by car to the autopsy room to await today's autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e176">A Trainee Was Shot Dead By a Guard Who Mishandled a Gun <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>His Head Was Shattered in a Tragic State</p>
<p>The District Chief and Patrol Officer Requested Punishment</p>
<p>At 10:15 PM the night before last, Liu Hongsheng, a guard at the 15th watch post of the Third District on the main street near Sanwanchang (place name) at the northern end of Huayuan Stone Bridge in Pudong, heard a commotion behind Sanwanchang. Guard Liu was deeply afraid that there would be an unexpected incident during this period of martial law. As a precaution, he first lifted the rifle he was carrying on his shoulder into his hands, loaded it with live ammunition, bent his waist, and walked with the gun held horizontally in front of him, intending to investigate the matter himself. Unexpectedly, the safety catch on the gun was not closed. The trigger was accidentally pulled, and with a bang, the bullet shot out. In fact, Jiang Xiaosizi (15 years old, from Jiangdu), an apprentice at the Yehua Iron Shop, was defecating by the small creek in front. The bullet went straight into Xiaosizi's back of the head and exited from his forehead, and he fell to the ground, covered in blood, and died on the spot. When the guard saw the cause of the disaster, he immediately returned to the district to surrender. The district chief questioned the guard and ordered him to be detained for further investigation. He then sent a message to the local police chief, Xie Along, to report to the Local Court for an autopsy. Afterwards, Jiang Fei's mother of the deceased lodged a complaint with the district, stating that her home was in the factory house of the Rihua Yarn Factory, that her husband had passed away many years ago, leaving behind four sons, and that the deceased was the youngest. It was unexpected that he would be shot and killed by the police gun. The guard had no feud with her son, so it was known that he did not fire the gun intentionally. She did not want to get involved in litigation. However, the family was poor and unable to afford to prepare a coffin. She asked the district chief what to do. The district chief took pity on her and gave her two hundred yuan from his own pocket to first pay for the coffin and funeral expenses and to take care of the funeral. At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Local Court appointed Prosecutor Zhao, along with attendants, to conduct an autopsy at the scene. It was found that the bullet exit point on the deceased's forehead was the size of a teacup, the brains were splattered, and the skull was shattered, and it was indeed the tragic state of being killed by a gunshot. No family members of the deceased were found at the scene. The corpse was ordered to be received and coffined by the owner of Yehua Iron Shop, Ye Zaihua, who signed a written pledge. It was heard that since this case occurred, although the family of the deceased had not filed a lawsuit according to the law, the police chief of the shed had not supervised them strictly, which led to this disaster. It was planned to ask the headquarters to demote him to police officer. The district chief and the patrol officer were negligent in training at ordinary times, so it was difficult to shirk responsibility. Therefore, he prepared a document and asked the headquarters to punish him. The shooting guard, Liu Hongsheng, was ordered to be sent to the headquarters and transferred to the court for strict investigation in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e177">&lt;Correction of Candle Industry and Kerosene Wax Price P] In the recent city, a small number of candle industries only use kerosene to make candles, which is confusing with the price of tribute candles on the market. The Candle Industry Guild, in order to correct the price of the industry and to unify it, has separately discussed and decided to standardize and maintain business. The association specially notified all members yesterday, saying, "To whom it may concern, our association has recently had a small number of members who completely use kerosene wax to make candles, resulting in inconsistent prices, which is a hindrance to the business of most of the industry. At the general meeting on the 18th of this month, the candle was named kerosene wax, and from November 24th, each load will be sold at 30 yuan per load. The price of tribute candles and market candles will remain the same as before until new oil is seen, and there shall be no increase or decrease. In addition to sending letters to newspapers for announcements, we would like to solemnly inform you again, etc." Lihe Foreign Company Auctions Valuable Items.

The Great China Match Company replied to the Tobacco Exchange Guild yesterday, saying, "In short, the matches of various brands produced by our company are now being processed and produced urgently, especially the Golden Rooster, Baode Famous Wine (commonly known as Beauty) of Shanghai. Although the current output is still not suitable for supply and demand, the various materials are indeed fully prepared. In at most one month, it should be supplied as much as possible without worrying about shortage. As for ordinary matches (non-phosphorus matches), there is a relatively large stock. If your members purchase a reasonable amount within this month to replace them, it will be enough to cope with the market and resist enemy goods. As for the methods used by foreign merchants, it is nothing more than that your members are enthusiastic and patriotic, promote domestic goods, and hope to use temporary small profits as bait to carry out their permanent aggression. This kind of trick has long been seen through by your association and does not need to be repeated. However, I hope that patriotic gentlemen will encourage each other, do not be deceived by the scheme, and take more care of domestic matches to prevent the temptation of foreigners and adhere to the original intention of saving the country. This is not only the luck of our company, but the future of the country is really dependent on it. Special reply, I hope you will check and inform, I am very grateful, etc." News from Trade Associations. Pharmaceutical Industry.

It is very strange to read it. After investigation, Korea is completely a Japanese colony. For example, the inspection team of our association had four baskets of apples shipped from Qingdao by Quanji Fruit Stall on the 20th of last month. After the review by our team, it was confirmed that the goods were Japanese goods. The Inspection Department of your association was immediately informed to seal up the goods and confiscate them for public use. As a result, these goods have since disappeared. Now the Korean apples transported and sold by Yuanchang Company are completely Japanese goods. Not only does our industry know, but other industries also know. It is really difficult to hide people's eyes and ears. In view of our association's enthusiasm for the Anti-Japanese War, we are specially writing to inform you. We hope that your association will handle it seriously and must be familiar with the identification of the goods to avoid confusion in the future of the Anti-Japanese War. Whether or not, please reply. " Palm Fiber Industry. The Palm Fiber Industry Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday. A total of 28 members attended, with Zhang Baolin as the chairman.

The meeting was photographed and adjourned. Reader's Letter Inquiries from Mr. Wang Boming of Yixing (Ask about methods of resisting Japan and saving the country.) The cool moon shines on the ground, the sparse forest sways, and the north wind invades the bones, making people silent. Standing on the steps, I can't help but think of Jiangqiao in Heilongjiang Province, our loyal and brave soldiers, defending the country and resisting the enemy, and the bitter situation of melee and charge. The fallen soldiers and the soldiers who survived the war, facing this bright moonlight, were filled with grief and indignation, and wanted to eat the flesh of the Japanese. It can be imagined that at this critical moment of survival and death, who does not have the heart to destroy the Japanese and defend the country? However, everyone has their own responsibilities and cannot abandon their old business. They only hope that the Japanese invaders will realize their mistakes and withdraw their troops. However, thoughts are still thoughts, and facts are still facts. I am deeply concerned about the current situation, and my heart is increasingly pained. We were born as Chinese people, and we will die as Chinese ghosts. If the Japanese invaders destroy us, we will have no place to be buried. At this time, thinking about how to resist and how to fight is like whipping a dead horse. Therefore, I sincerely hope that before I die, I can do some practical things to save the country to repay my motherland. If I can fulfill my own ability and responsibility, I can leave a little regret in the world. However, Boming is a primary school teacher and cannot carry a gun to the front line to serve the country. As a man, I am ashamed and afraid. Every day, in addition to teaching children, I try my best to explain the atrocities of the Japanese army, instill common knowledge of resisting Japan and saving the country, and resolutely refrain from buying Japanese goods forever. I am deeply afraid that there are more important tasks of saving the country that can be done by millions of primary school teachers across the country, but we have not done them. How should we do them to be worthy of the armed patriotic men in the icy and snowy trenches? May I ask you, sir, what else do we need to do? (Reply) Primary school teachers, speaking from their own profession, are already extremely important. For example, General Ma Zhanshan, who is universally admired by the compatriots across the country, gentlemen in the education circle, should at least study the following two questions: (1) What kind of education did Ma Zhanshan receive to have this kind of thinking and action? (2) Is the current education sufficient to cultivate people like Ma Zhanshan? If the results of the research show that the current education is not enough to cultivate them, or even enough to cultivate non-resistant generals who are absolutely opposed to Ma Zhanshan, what is the benefit of this kind of education to the future of the country and the nation? This is one of the tasks that educators should have because of this national crisis. As for explaining the actions of the Japanese army, instilling common sense of saving the country, and always buying enemy goods, if the education circle issues a mobilization order, primary school teachers across the country will all vigorously implement these three tasks, and they will never be allowed to relax until a demobilization order is issued. How great, solid, and long-lasting will the future effect be? These are all things that the education circle should and can do. I would like to ask if there are other things to do. Ms. Huang Huibai of Suzhou sent six articles of the national salvation oath. We think they are very important and should be observed by all compatriots. All educators should universally teach young people and set an example themselves, which is their unshirkable responsibility. Ms. Huang Huibai's letter (I hope that the people of the country will practice the six articles of the national salvation oath.) The way to save the country lies in vigorous practice. I respectfully order six old agreements and hope that the people of the country will abide by them and persevere throughout their lives. (1) From today onwards, I vow to stop all entertainment banquets and miscellaneous consumption (such as drinking alcohol, sipping tea, and smoking cigarettes) and transfer the money saved to the national salvation fund. (2) From today onwards, I vow to practice frugality in clothing and food, and to fulfill the doctrine of thrift, and transfer the expenses saved to the national salvation fund. (3) From today onwards, I vow to practice physical education for one hour every day and read books that are beneficial to the body and mind for one hour. (4) From today onwards, I vow to work harder on my original work. (5) From today onwards, I vow not to use enemy goods and not to use foreign goods unless absolutely necessary. (6) From today onwards, I vow to persuade at least one person every day to implement the above oath. Correspondence Indication Postage stamps Postage stamp should be affixed when mailing and should be accompanied by an equivalent amount of postage stamps.

Letter Received To whom it may concern, the news about Jing'an Temple in the local news column of your newspaper on the 22nd is inconsistent with the facts. According to the lawsuit of Ze Min and others against Zhi Fa for obstructing freedom, Zhi Fa also filed a lawsuit against Zhi Wen and others for disrupting order. Therefore, the case was tried together on the 21st. The presiding judge, Xiao Xie Fen, reprimanded Zhi Fa in court, saying that Lawyer Chen is a well-known lawyer in Shanghai, and the others are also local people. You are a monk, and you should not rashly sue them. Now you should apologize to them, and at the same time advise Ze Min and others to withdraw the lawsuit, and then order Ze Min and others to stand at the first place and order Zhi Fa to apologize in court. Ze Min and others withdrew the lawsuit in order to settle the matter and respect the court's instructions. This is the real situation, and everyone in the court has heard it. The news about this case in your newspaper is obviously hearsay and untrue. I am specially writing to correct it and ask you to publish this letter. Sincerely, Shanghai Newspaper Office, Lawyer Chen Zemin, November 24. Reading Dr. Wang Yuanchen's Judgment Admonition (Liu Wushu) Yi Ruichang sought treatment at the Jiangsu Provincial Hospital due to the inability to move his C-joint joint. Dr. Wang Yuanchen, the director of the hospital, administered acupuncture and medicine, and the ulceration was greatly healed. The patient wanted to save and treat the joint adhesion of the femoral joint in the hope that the disabled limb could recover its movement. Dr. Wang told him that the syphilis was deep, the stiffness was long-lasting, and it was difficult to cure. If it must be cured, there are only two methods: surgery and shaking. He also stated the danger of fracture with shaking. In desperation, the patient wanted to seek a chance of hope and tried his best to save the surgery, and used [dead horse as a live horse doctor] as a metaphor. (The patient did not want surgery, so he took the shaking method.) Dr. Wang can be said to have avoided difficulties and enthusiastically performed his duties. Unexpectedly, shaking the right femur had already shown results, and then shaking the left femur, because the syphilis was deep and the bone quality was brittle, the bone was broken before the surgery was completed. Wang then transported it to the Hongren Hospital and joined it under the X-ray light. The surgery that could be applied had been used, and the doctor had done everything he could, and he could plead not guilty to the patient's family. Nai Yi Ruichang, after eight or nine months, was heavily indebted (owed more than 800 yuan in medical expenses) and his disability had not healed. He had a wonderful idea and accused Director Wang of negligence in business, resulting in serious injury, in the court. The Zhenjiang Local Court had a unique eye and charged Director Wang with negligence in business, resulting in serious injury. I read it with emotion. The guilt or innocence of Director Wang can be decided in one word, that is, whether Yi Zaichang's serious injury (referring to the inability to move the joint) was caused by Director Wang. If this doubt is cleared, the rest can be easily solved without the need for words. People with little common sense of medicine may suspect that the broken thigh bone is an incurable matter. I don't know that patients with tertiary syphilis have the possibility of fracture with this surgery. However, if it is unfortunately broken, it can also be connected. If the interface is not neat, it is just unsightly in appearance. At most, the action is weak. There is no reason why the joint cannot move due to the fracture at three inches below the great trochanter, nor is there any reason why the joint becomes stiff if the interface is not very neat. This can be known by those who have a little common sense of physiology, without the need for medical experts. Last year, there was someone who sought treatment from me for a feverish disease. The radius was fractured for a long time, and the shoulder joint and elbow joint moved freely. The broken limbs and tibias of disabled soldiers are everywhere, and the joints above the broken end are intact. Knowing this, Yi Ruichang's disability is due to many years of syphilis, which makes the joint adhere and unable to move. At first, it has nothing to do with whether the bone is broken or not, and it has nothing to do with the neatness of the bone connection. Since the serious injury was not caused by Director Wang, what is the negligence in business? The root of this charge cannot be established. First, this case has been handed over to experts for appraisal twice, and it is quite fair. Since the judgment is cited as the basis, it cannot harm the meaning with words and lose its original intention. Nai judge took the part of the appraisal report that was beneficial to the plaintiff out of context and adopted it into the judgment. Other fair and detailed parts that were beneficial to the defendant were not only implicitly ignored, but also did not hesitate to contradict them, and stubbornly pretended to know what he did not know, and concocted the crime, saying that [after the treatment, because the thigh bone was shaken and reconnected, after a long period of time, the poisonous bacteria gathered between the hip and knee joints, resulting in strong fixation and inability to move slightly. With the intervention of this natural cause, the defendant's criminal responsibility cannot be interrupted, and he must be held responsible for negligence in business, resulting in serious injury]. I don't know where this wonderful theory comes from. Why does the gathering of germs in the hip and knee joints result from the thigh bone being shaken and reconnected after a long period of time? If this is the case, is the inability to move the two hip joints before the surgery (Yi Ruichang's own complaint and statement to the appraiser) caused by shaking and reconnecting the thigh bone? Is the inability to move the right joint Director Wang's fault? It is far-fetched to impose a crime on others. Then, all surgeries with dangerousness, if the result is bad, can be concocted into a prison. Who dares to be a doctor? It is said that in case of doubt about a crime, be lenient; in case of doubt about merit, be generous. Why are the ancients and modern people so contradictory? Moreover, I have more questions that I don't understand. Director Wang's defense statement should not be lightly believed by the judge, which is appropriate. The points clearly proven in the plaintiff's own complaint and the appraisal report are also not paid attention to. This is what we, the common people, cannot understand after thinking about it a hundred times. I will enumerate a few items to prove it.

<p>Automotive News Special Article A General Overview of Next Year's New Cars. Song. Styles and Structures Have Improved. The year 1932 will soon be here. There will be a new atmosphere in the automotive market. This is the best time to introduce new cars at the end of the year. Therefore, a summary of the styles of next year's new cars and the differences from the current models is given below. Regarding the style and structure of the chassis, except for a few that have been reformed, most are the same as the 1931 models. All the places that need to be reformed are derived from experience. As for the size and style of the body, according to Mr. Gan Liss, current automotive operators, in view of the national and international situation, most car buyers tend to favor small cars because they are cheaper to buy and are extremely economical to use in peacetime. Therefore, there will be a large number of small cars on the market in the future. Therefore, manufacturers are now focusing on four-cylinder and twelve-horsepower small cars. This is also due to the fashion of buyers. The structure and style of the body have always been changing with each passing day. Therefore, it is expected that there will be many styles of new car bodies next year. Anyone who sees this kind of new car will initially think that it is roughly the same as the current style. However, after careful observation, it will be found that there are many reforms. Generally speaking, the excellent body of the new car is that it is spacious, wide and deep, and its front part is also more comfortable. This point may not be visible at first glance, but those who are in the car will definitely feel it. The body of the new car is lower than the old one. This is because the chassis is low, so the body is also low. In addition, or because the configuration of each part of the car is even, it also feels low and beautiful. Therefore, the car line is also mostly changed. Although it is not most of it, it is also very careful. Moreover, not only the majority of the body's panels are curved, but also the wings are all the same. This is because flat steel is used more and more in car manufacturing. Not only the all-steel body is like this, but the wooden frame of the assembled body is also inlaid with flat steel. The appearance style of the car is the most important issue in the current car manufacturing industry. The smooth or sluggish car sales mostly depend on the quality of its style. Therefore, next year's new car will spend a lot of research and effort on the style issue. However, this does not mean that the car's action shape can be ignored. Generally speaking, car drivers with special identification ability pay great attention to the car's action shape. However, this point is best if it can match the car's identity. However, car manufacturers must pay great attention to the style, appearance, and after-sales service of a well-made car, because this often attracts the choice of those who intend to buy a car. For this reason, the style of the new car is a major focus of car manufacturers. Not only is the side view emphasized, but also the front shape and the back view are taken into account. In terms of the above-mentioned scope, the radiator, high beam lamps, and horns on the car must be taken into account in all aspects. Their installation is often made to match the whole car. In the past, car manufacturers often had a style in mind for the construction of the radiator. They often did not consider whether it was in harmony with the whole car. When it was completed, the style was not unattractive, but often the driver's line of sight was obscured by this radiator. When manufacturing the rear part of the car, attention was also paid to its style. Generally speaking, the trend is to be a whole piece. The spring hook chain is of course made in an extended style. At present, the construction of various cars, spring hook chains, and metal rings are mostly lubricated in a centralized manner, so in fact, there is no need to expose the various parts to the outside. The brake adjuster and shock absorber devices are largely the same as before. An important feature of next year's new cars in terms of style is that the chassis and the body are properly configured, the size is uniform, and the form becomes a whole harmony, not a clear division into two sections. The sides of the body are very deep, so that the curtains can be avoided. This trend is very popular now. The new car will also adopt it. However, the running board, which was once wanted to be eliminated, is still retained, because this kind of equipment can help the wings to protect against mud. It is very necessary in rainy days. Even if the car uses tight wings, this kind of short running board must be adopted. The reason is as mentioned above. A style adopted by the famous lawyer Ma and the Rover cars is also worth noting, that is, the front part is flat or army style. This kind of style can only be seen in custom-made cars in the past, but recently it has been chosen by various standard cars, which is also worth mentioning. As for whether this kind of style is an improvement, this should be viewed from the whole car as a whole. However, it is a fact that it can make the inside of the car brighter. In fact, for this kind of car head, the driver often wants to install a wind screen to avoid the glare. If this kind of device is needed, it should not be an outer cover style, otherwise the style will be affected. The panel of the sunshade is attached to the top of the car when not in use. It is very convenient to use this simple method with just one hand. Although the windshield is a small matter, it is worth mentioning here. At present, the trend is to adopt a fixed windshield. Once installed, it cannot be opened arbitrarily. In fact, even in extremely hot weather, there is no need to open the windshield. However, there is one thing that is very inconvenient for fixed windshields, that is, foggy days and when the temperature drops. At that time, the fog is misty and adheres to the windshield and becomes moisture. Even if there is a water scraper, it is useless. Fortunately, this kind of weather is very rare. Buyers of cars with fixed windshields do not have to worry too much. Cars with four doors are very convenient for users, which is undoubtedly. In the new cars of next year, there will be many styles of two-door two-seater cars. This kind of vehicle is actually for two people, but there are also other devices that can seat four people. Most of the sedan cars that can carry four or five people are equipped with four doors for convenience. The new cars of 1932 will have great improvements in color, bright and pleasing to the eye. The range of all kinds of colors is very wide, which is very different from the past when there were only a few kinds of colors and black was preferred. The use of wood material with glossy paint is very popular. Car manufacturers have made great contributions to this point. Compared with one or two years ago, it is much more beautiful. Even in low-priced bodies, the glossy materials used in the color aspect can now be comparable to custom-made cars. If this kind of glossy paint is used properly, it is also very durable. Since the above-mentioned wood material with glossy paint is used, the color of the body is renewed and dazzling. The fabric material of the body is no longer liked by people. Today, although there are still many people who like the fabric material of the body, if you want it to be bright and durable, you must spend a lot of effort on protection, otherwise it will look old in two years. There is also an aspect of the body manufacturing in 1932 that is very important, that is, car merchants have opened up a new way in their business policies. That is, some chassis manufacturers will unite with manufacturers that specialize in making exquisite carriages, so that the cars produced under this kind of cooperation will become a kind of (standard special body). This name seems very special at first glance, but in fact, this kind of body is manufactured firmly and the materials are excellent, which is worth the price. The cars produced by the cooperation between manufacturers and body manufacturers will be welcomed by customers who generally like novelty and curiosity. If the body manufacturer does not cooperate with the manufacturer, then the manufacturer has no other way to think of except for manufacturing a standard car. This can also be said in reverse, that is, the demand for standard cars is high, and the demand for standard special cars is rare.

<p>Bao Lao Er Imprisoned for Seventeen Years</p>
<p>Qu Chengqing, residing at No. 1760 Haining Road, was kidnapped by bandits on January 11th of last year at 11 PM, just as he returned home and reached his doorstep. The two perpetrators, Shi Arong from Ningbo and Bao Lao Er (also known as Rongqing) from Taizhou, were apprehended by the combined efforts of the Huishan and Huisi police stations. They were handed over to the First Special Court. After repeated interrogations, the trial concluded yesterday at 2:30 PM. Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi announced the verdict in the Second Criminal Court. The main points were as follows: Shi Arong was sentenced to death for the crime of jointly kidnapping for ransom; Bao Lao Er was sentenced to seventeen years of imprisonment with hard labor for the crime of jointly kidnapping for ransom, with two days of pre-trial detention counting as one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Wei Tingrong Kidnapping Case: Zhao Weisheng's Identity Question <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Justice Certifies Zhao as a Military Man</p>
<p>Final Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>In the kidnapping case of Wei Tingrong, former Commander-in-Chief of the French Concession Chinese Volunteer Corps, which occurred in July of the eighteenth year of the Republic, the French police apprehended Zhu Jingcheng, Chen Zhongheng, and Tang Shiliang, who were then handed over to the French court. They were tried and sentenced, as recorded in the case files. Subsequently, the French police apprehended other involved parties, including Lü Ruowang, Cai Weicai, and Zhao Weisheng, who were handed over to the Second Special District Local Court and held in custody. Yesterday at 3 PM, Judge Xiong Huiben, along with court clerk Tao Zongkan and Prosecutor Lou Guanguang, convened in the First Court for the hearing. The defendants were represented by lawyers Zhu Dianqing, Gao Wenqi, Shan Yuhua, and Ge Zhaoji. First, Zhao Weisheng's defense lawyer, Mr. Shan, stated that the court had previously requested an interpretation from the Ministry of Justice regarding the defendant Zhao Weisheng's identity. It has now been verified that Zhao is indeed a military officer. Concerning the issue of jurisdiction, he requested that Article 318, Clause 6 of the Criminal Procedure Law be addressed first. The court instructed that the trial proceed, and Zhao was then questioned, stating that he was 31 years old, from Zhengzhou, Henan, and currently serving as the commander of the Sixth Independent Battalion of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Police. He was further questioned about the battalion's organization, jurisdiction, and duties. Lü Ruowang testified that he did not know about the kidnapping of Wei beforehand. He met Zhou Juying and Chen Chuheng at a fair in Hangzhou. Zhou gave him a letter and a form, instructing him to go to the Chengzhan Hotel to collect 1,000 yuan. Later, upon returning to Shanghai, he met Zhao Weisheng on the roof of the Wing On Department Store, who spoke about the kidnapping of Wei. Cai Weicai testified that Yang Ada, Fan Rengen, Xu Liyuan, and Zhang Agen went to carry out the kidnapping. He was instructed to watch the north side of Avenue Edward VII for foreigners. Initially, they said they were going to rob opium, but he later learned about the kidnapping of Wei. At this point, the court ordered Zhu Jingcheng, Chen Zhongheng, and Tang Shiliang, who had already been sentenced, to be brought in for cross-examination. Zhu and Tang both stated that they did not know about the kidnapping of Wei and that their previous confessions were coerced. Chen Zhongheng testified that Lü first introduced Zhou Juying, who borrowed 1,200 yuan from him, claiming it was to open a printing shop. Later, because the money was not repaid when due, Zhou arranged a meeting with Zhao Weisheng on the roof of the Wing On Department Store. Zhao told him that Wei was wealthy but unkind and had embezzled public funds from the Volunteer Corps. He wanted to kidnap him and said that the money Zhou borrowed was not for opening a printing shop but for the kidnapping. Later, he went to Hangzhou to see the fair and met Lü and Zhou on the road. The next afternoon, Lü Ruowang and Zhou Juying went to his house. Zhou said the 1,000 yuan was borrowed at the Chengzhan Hotel and instructed him and Lü to go collect the money. Zhou handed over a letter. He was anxious to get the money, so he went with Lü. Upon arriving at the Chengzhan Hotel, he overheard Lü negotiating with someone in the room and realized it was about the kidnapping of Wei. He panicked and fled, but Zhou Juying grabbed him, threatened him with a pistol, and dragged him back into the room. Zhao Weisheng firmly denied knowing Lü Ruowang and Chen Zhongheng and denied meeting and discussing the kidnapping of Wei on the roof of the Wing On Department Store. At this point, the court ordered the commencement of closing arguments. After the defendants' lawyers presented their defenses, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen gave a detailed argument on the defendants' criminal conduct. The court adjourned the arguments and scheduled sentencing for the morning of November 18th. The defendants were remanded into custody. During the hearing, Zhao's family and subordinate military officers were present in the audience. By the time the court adjourned, the clock had struck five.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Zhihe Qianzhuang Case Hearing Held Yesterday <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The case of accountant Tang Zaizhang, the court-appointed liquidator, suing the shareholders of Zhihe Yongji Qianzhuang was heard by Judge Li Mo in the Ninth Court yesterday morning at 9 AM. First, the plaintiff, accountant Tang Zaizhang, presented his audit findings, stating that he had submitted a detailed table of assets and liabilities to the court, showing what the company owed and what was owed to it. While the amounts owed to and by the company appeared to balance on the surface, in reality, there was no hope of recovering the 1.2 million taels owed by Shen Chengji alone, and there were many other bad debts. Since his appointment, he had only received 70,000 to 80,000 taels, which were temporarily deposited in a bank, awaiting distribution. Lawsuits were being pursued against the remaining debtors, but it was difficult to expect recovery in the short term. There were over 400 depositors, mostly small creditors. To protect these creditors, it was necessary for the shareholders to step forward and settle the matter. Furthermore, when the liquidator collected debts for the qianzhuang, debtors often requested reductions in the amount owed. Although this was clearly permitted by facts or reason, because the shareholders were avoiding involvement, the liquidator could not grant these requests, making the liquidation process increasingly difficult and causing even greater losses for the general creditors. Therefore, he urged the shareholders to come forward and settle the matter as soon as possible. He then listed the names of the shareholders, stating that the shareholder register and capital book contained detailed information and were sealed with a continuous stamp, providing solid evidence. Lawyers Wang Youling and Li Xinyang, representing the plaintiff, presented their legal arguments. The defendant Chen Yizhai retained lawyers Zhang Zhirang and Wang Fusheng, while the defendant Chen Rongrongchu retained lawyer Zhang Zhengxue. They took turns responding and requested further collection of evidence. Lawyer Xu Shihao, representing the creditors, requested that the shareholders' assets be provisionally seized. The judge summarized the facts and arguments and announced that the hearing would be adjourned and reconvened. All shareholder cases would be consolidated and heard together. Regarding the request for provisional seizure, he instructed that a formal application be submitted for further review.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Firecracker Explosions Cause Injuries <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Two Injured in Loud Blast</p>
<p>Shen Yugan, from Jiangbei, opened a firecracker (small firecrackers bought by children for playful throwing) workshop last year in a flat at No. 5, Lane 79, Yangjiazhai, Pudong. He employed over ten female workers, and production was quite fast. However, in addition to sand and gravel, these firecrackers required gunpowder. Yesterday at 9:15 AM, Shen was mixing the gunpowder when, due to carelessness, an explosion suddenly occurred. The loud blast shook the surrounding area. The loft of the workshop was blown apart, and the walls of two houses collapsed. Shen himself was directly hit by the blast, suffering severe facial injuries. His face was swollen and disfigured, resembling a drowned corpse. His clothes were torn to shreds, and he collapsed to the ground, unable to move. A young female worker, Yang Xiaoju, only twelve years old, had a large hole blown in her right eye, with blood gushing out. Residents nearby, hearing the loud explosion, were initially unsure of what had happened and were greatly alarmed. Nearby police officers sent men to transport the two injured individuals to the Third District, from where they were transferred to Pudong Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Shen's injuries are not life-threatening, but he may lose his sight. The Third District Chief, Zhang, ordered all unexploded gunpowder to be removed from the area after the incident. It was also discovered that there were five such firecracker workshops near Yangjiazhai. In addition to instructing them to cease operations, he also submitted a request to the General Bureau to prohibit all firecracker workshops in the city from operating to eliminate the danger.</p>

<p>The Chihchih Savings Society was founded in the city by postal workers in the 18th year of the Republic. Over the years, it has developed considerably. Previously, the society was instructed by the Bureau of Social Affairs to increase its capital to prevent abuses. The society has already raised funds to reach 10,000 yuan. It is reported that after the society distributes its second dividend next month, it will begin offering small credit loans on January 1st of next year to address the legitimate urgent needs of the public.</p>

<p>At around 9 AM yesterday morning, a man wearing a dark blue serge robe and a melon-shaped hat was walking in the Zhangjiazhai area of Carter Road when he was suddenly attacked by an assailant who opened fire. Three shots were fired, hitting the man in the back of the head and left waist. The man collapsed to the ground due to his severe injuries and died on the spot. A police vehicle took the body to the morgue for examination. The deceased was approximately thirty years old.</p>

Wu Ziqian chaired the meeting, and Xu Wancheng took minutes. After the formalities, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by an introduction of Professor Liu Suijiu of Northeastern University, who spoke on Japan's past conspiracies and current atrocities in the three northeastern provinces. Those who heard him were filled with righteous indignation. The following matters were discussed: (1) Establish a national general association first, and then set up branches in various provinces to facilitate operations. (2) Notify representatives from various locations to register promptly so that the general assembly can be held as scheduled. (3) Set up a reception center at No. 120, Dachongli, Tongfu Road. (4) Decide to hold the inaugural meeting at 2 PM on the 29th of this month in the auditorium of the YMCA. (5) Appoint Liu Suijiu as chairman of the general assembly, Ms. Zhou Wenji as master of ceremonies, Xu Wancheng as the recorder, and Miao Zhijie and Xia Chaofan to arrange the venue and reception for the general assembly. (6) Wu Ziqian, Cheng Zuxin, and Huang Jingwan were appointed to handle the reception of representatives from various provinces. (7) Review the applications of new members submitted on the spot. Over eighty qualified applicants were approved for registration. The matter of requesting the society's constitution from other cities was not resolved. Requests from outside the province should be directed to the reception center for representatives from other provinces, and requests within the city should be made to Mr. Miao Zhijie at the YMCA.</p>

<p>Amounts Reaching Over Six Million</p>
<p>From the middle of this month to the present, the market price of Dalian silver dollars has been unusually high, equivalent to 7 qian, 7 fen, and 6.7 li per Shanghai tael. According to market prices in both locations, a profit of over 500 taels can be made for every 10,000 yuan. Therefore, banks, qianzhuang, and merchant guilds have been actively shipping silver dollars, totaling over six million. The shipments are being handled by the Dongshunji and Nanrongji customs brokers. It is also reported that further shipments are expected in the next few days. However, with the current rampant violence of the Japanese, shipping large quantities of silver dollars to Dalian to support their aggression is a suicidal policy for Chinese merchants who are greedy for small profits and forget the greater harm.</p>

<p>Thirty-Two Ships to Arrive Within Three Months</p>
<p>Totaling Over 189,000 Tons</p>
<p>The relief wheat purchased from the United States has already been shipped to China in three vessels, heading to various ports along the Yangtze River, totaling over 26,000 tons. The Fook Lai Shipping Company, which is transporting the wheat, has received a telegram from the United States stating that the first phase of shipping relief wheat to China will run from October 9th (when the first batch of wheat was shipped from the United States and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of this month) to December 29th. A total of 32 ships will be used, with 22 ships scheduled to unload in Shanghai and the remaining 10 ships scheduled to unload in Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou. The wheat unloaded in Shanghai will be transferred to Changjiang Company ships and transported to Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. The Relief Disaster Relief Office has negotiated with various shipping companies for a freight rate of 4 taels and 2 qian per ton from Shanghai to Hankou. Of these 32 ships, the total amount of wheat designated for transport is 133,591 tons, and there are also 55,951 tons of flour, totaling 189,541 tons, approximately 3,184,308 dan, valued at approximately 16.7 million national currency. In addition to the four ships that have already arrived, there are also 6,720 tons of wheat and 1,298 tons of flour on the Vancouver City, which left the United States on October 27th and is expected to pass Wusong today. This cargo is destined for Hankou. Another vessel, the Victoria City, is carrying 6,650 tons of wheat and 1,505 tons of flour, which left the United States on the 6th of this month and is expected to arrive in Jiujiang on December 3rd for unloading.

<p>Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Japanese ships in China have had no business whatsoever. Chinese merchant ships have recently been very crowded on all routes along the rivers and seas, with a clear excess of cargo over available ships. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has already purchased two ocean-going vessels and ordered two 700-ton riverboats from the Dahua Shipyard to expand its shipping operations on the Southern and Upper Yangtze lines. The Sanbei Company has also purchased three ocean-going vessels from Hong Kong, the largest of which is 6,000 tons. It has already assigned employees to go to Hong Kong to take delivery of the ships and bring them to Shanghai. It is said that the remaining two ships are former ocean-going vessels of a British trading company in Shanghai, which Sanbei will repair and then schedule for routes.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun vessel, on its voyage from Hankou to Shanghai, carried 500 new recruits and a propaganda team of 50-60 members. At 6 AM on the 19th, while en route from Wuxue, and just as it was about to check passenger tickets in Jiujiang, a conflict arose between the new recruits and the propaganda team over hot water. Personnel in the refugee quarters witnessed the situation and attempted to mediate. However, the members of the propaganda team were impatient and aggressive. The ticket inspector Zhang Gensheng immediately notified the on-board military police to come and mediate, hoping to resolve the matter. Unexpectedly, the team members misunderstood, thinking that Zhang Gensheng was relying on the military police to suppress them. They then encircled Zhang and blew a whistle to call for help. Although the military police mediated, Zhang Gensheng was still seized by the team members, who accused him of insulting their team leader and demanded that he be severely punished as a warning.

<p>Over the past 28 years, the Gillette Company of the United States has sold countless Gillette safety razors. Based on years of experience, they have gradually improved and created the new and perfect Goodwill brand razors and blades. Shaving is smooth and close, providing an unprecedented experience. The company is currently operating day and night, producing 80,000 razors and 2.7 million blades per day to meet the demands of all parties. Vice President and General Manager Mr. Lu Hai plans to spend 2 million pounds next year on advertising in the world's most famous newspapers. The new Gillette razors and blades are priced low. The new blades can also be used on older razors. The new blades have four concave corners, so if they fall on the ground, the blades will remain straight, preventing cuts to the face during shaving. The new razor also does not need to be disassembled for cleaning. The blades will never rust. After shaving, loosen the frame, turn the four corners upright, rinse in water, and let it dry. The first batch of new goods has now arrived and is available at department stores and foreign goods stores.</p>
