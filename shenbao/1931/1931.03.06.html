<h3>歐甘恊定</h3>
<p>世界各國。無論對於友邦與屬地。其交涉之手段不外剛柔兩途能剛則以武力壓迫之。不能剛則惟有審時度勢。决心讓步以圖速了。雖被屈服之名而不恤。若旣不能强又不能弱。而徒以口舌支撑。遷延不决則非特於事無補而且枝節横生。益滋世人疑慮。更陷於無法收拾之境地。非善策也今日世界在此公私交困之情勢下。非有絶大野心者。决不敢輕言武力不用武力而徒事張皇洶洶然若有用武力之情勢。則謡言愈多。恐懼愈多恐懼愈甚亦非世界之福歐洲各大國之當局。今皆覺悟及此。故意法間相互讓步。成立海軍協定表示兩國間之諒解。而英印間之問題。其事雖似僅屬於内部。然其影響之大糾紛之鉅皆不下於意法間之國際交涉。今其政府與民黨。亦决然表示讓步成立歐甘協定以挽回英印間險惡之形勢。此兩事皆爲萬難解决之事而今竟解决於俄頃之間。成功於意料之外。此其國之輿論。所以不勝其欣幸也</p>
<p>竊謂各當局之所以覺悟及此。非無故也。蓋今日正當注全力以整理其商業之時。對内若何救濟失業。對外若何發展貿易。皆爲不可稍緩之事若有不和平之疑念。横梗於世人之心。則足以阻礙百事之進展而影響於商業前途尤大。故不得不先掃除之也。雖然。此二者之協定。僅可謂爲初步之成功所需於前途之努力多矣</p>

<h3>記朱慶瀾之出處</h3>
<p>— 珠</p>
<p>通國皆知之朱慶瀾先生。外交家兼政治家軍事家也。比來專爲振濟災民。不辭跋涉。不辭險阻。僕僕道途。奔波南北。世人祗知朱君爲浙江人而未知屬何縣何地也。今爲讀自由談者述之。</p>
<p>我紹縣城之南。有塔山。南山脚下有柴塲衖。衖内有大厦數百棵。係明末清初朱相國之故居。家祠内尚存相國塑身。當滿清入關。相國不惜犧牲一己。求全山隂會稽二縣生命。功在國家。地方奉旨。祠内得塑眞身。如近世之銅像。留傳不朽。朱君慶瀾。即相國之後裔也。自入民國以來。不願爲官。祇知救民。有時入浙募振。雖數過家門而不入。不啻夏禹第二。有姪女。即月波之女。（月波爲朱君第二兄）月波夫婦去世己十餘年。無子。祇此一女。遣嫁謝氏。或詢之曰。大姑。汝上有八十餘歲之老姑。下撫四孤兒女。苦度荒年。何不投奔普救災民之活菩薩汝之三叔乎。（月女稱慶瀾先生爲三叔）月女曰。願吾三叔多多度人。余雖餓死。亦願之也。月女之賢。先生之慈。皆不愧爲朱相國之裔。邇月女方避荒申江。度日維艱云。</p>
<h3>記賭徒念秧術</h3>
<p>— 覺迷</p>
<p>每届歲首。吾鄉習俗。於徴逐酒食之外。每作牧猪奴戲。以爲消遣。於是各地茶肆。可以從中漁利。輒有聚賭之舉。賭徒此時。乃施其種種念身之術。攫人錢財。嗜賭之人。則墮其術中而不自覺。至於傾家蕩産者比比也。前歲歲杪。吾鄉龔家路一茶肆中。來一茶客。客後隨一車夫。蓋自上海至者。其時尚無長途汽車。凡自上海至川沙北境。大都搭輪至東溝。再由東溝雇車轉至各地。至其車資。則五六銀角。以一至七八銀角。客旣坐定。出一銀幣。與其車夫。囑向店肆兌换銀角。俾給車資。店肆以其幣爲僞質。不予兌换。客有難色。謂其囊中。只此一幣。俄出竹牌一副。商於茶肆主人。質數銀角。以給車資。茶肆主人見客衣冠楚楚。不類下流。而其竹牌嶄新。值可數圓。遂爲質下。客約一二日後。即行來　。而客一去。竟不復來。及至新年聚賭牌九之時。有一客至。腰纒纍纍。茶肆主人邀客作莊。客即慨然承諾。惟以其牌己舊。叩主人有新牌否。主人則以己無新牌。而去年年底有客質下一牌。固屬嶄新。遂出其牌。初推數方。客竟連負。而容色自若。仍行推下。所有賭客。以客易與。且窺其多金。故初下注一二圓者。至此加注至五六圓。其五六圓者。加注至十數圓。其十數圓者。加注至數十圓。其數十圓者。加注至百圓以外。惟自加注之後。下家連負。莊家連勝。未及數方。所有賭客。無不金盡囊空。面面相覷。而客乃滿載以去。客旣去。賭客有疑及客施伎倆。墮其術中者。乃訽茶肆主人以牌之來歷。茶肆主人據實以告。益起疑竇。細察其牌。則悉有暗記。前後兩客。實爲同黨。而前此質牌之客。以欲栽其牌於茶肆之中。僞託無錢。質以給付車資。此次作莊之客。以欲引人入勝。故初數方。連連大負。而茶肆主人與賭客。則於前後兩客。未知其爲念秧之流。送墮其術中而不之覺也。至賭徒念秧。不一其術。此其一耳。記之於石。或足爲嗜賭者之一戒乎。</p>
<h3>廣州之中山紀念堂</h3>
<p>— 李慶多</p>
<p>▲建於總統府舊址</p>
<p>孫總理昔年在粤被推爲臨時大總統。在廣州就職。總統府設於省署之右。觀音山之下。未幾。陳炯明率軍叛變。遣葉舉等攻襲總統府。總理蒙難。出奔得免。遭此奇辱舉國不忘。尤以當地粤人目擊此變。同深義憤。粤省當局因在總統府舊址。建築中山紀念堂。藉爲總理之永久紀念。現己落成。即將竣工。莊嚴富麗。搆築精良。爲廣州市宏偉建築物中之不可多睹者。聞建築費達三百餘萬元。不日將舉行開幕典禮。余曾謁建築中山紀念堂籌備委員林直勉先生。蒙其介紹。前往觀光。鑒賞壯麗之紀念堂。回憶遭刧之總統府。殊令余追思總理不置也。</p>
<h3>春夜歌聲</h3>
<p>— 老拙</p>
<p>年來海上票社林立。嗜戲曲者日見其多。皮簧之聲。幾如家絃户誦。故票社亦應運而生。就中如中華公成立僅兩載。申商甫於去秋誕生。俱己聲聞遐邇。上星期五六及星期等日。爲中華公與申商春季彩排。並祝袁履登先生之太夫人六秩晋九壽兩社各演劇兩日。爰就所見。連綴述之。星期六晚觀中華公出演於寗波同鄉會。王得天君何五良君朱乃賡夫人合演二進宫。是劇唱工繁重。須三角工力相等。沆瀣一氣。庶無畸輕畸重之弊。是晚王之凈。何之生。朱之靑衣。三人歌來。如水平線。一線到底。朱聨馥君吳老圃君之盜御馬。朱君近日觀摩小樓。竭力追蹤。確有臨池見到之處。吳之竇二墩。則頗似當年李連仲。張慰如君鶯韻女士之販馬記。張君扮演小生。神情臺步。均極瀟灑自如。鶯韻女士扮演桂枝。乃係破題兒第一遭。而寫狀時與夫婿之調侃態度。遞狀後之驚喜交集。種種作工。面面俱到。或亦參觀踠華而有心得者。俞葉封君之取北原。唱調旣蒼老。復顯出式侯凛然不可犯之神情。袁履登君之金馬門。袁君學者。性嗜酒。·恰合靑蓮學士之身份。有不期然而合拍之趨勢。星期日晚觀劇於申商票社。李白水君之六部大審。大段念白。說來頭頭是道。聞係初次演此。終塲不露生硬。足徴能手。張中原君之打嚴嵩。酷肖麒麟童。蓋其嗓音及身材。天然相似。固無待研究而得。亦一異己。陳寳書夫人之賀后駡殿。腔調清新。直逼程玉霜。方岑一君郭　　君李傳能君蔣勃公君之黄鶴樓方之身材瘦長。舉動念唱亦甚活潑。的是小生才也。郭之劉備。微嫌矮小。却善做工。李之趙雲。儀表修整。工架穏練。蔣之諸葛亮。戲弄三將軍一塲。頗帶滑稽性質。仍未失其本來面目。緣蔣君素以擅長丑角聞也。陳景塘君之球簾寨。數大段唱工。俱能應付裕如。洵非一日之功。尚有王修伯君與曹亮節君之四郎探母。因時己晏。致未及觀。次日春夢一覺。歌聲猶覺繚繞於耳際。因泚筆記之如此。</p>
<h3>記雁蕩觀音洞之桂圓奇樹</h3>
<p>— 燮清</p>
<p>去秋客温。隨友人遊雁蕩。越三宿而至觀音洞。息焉。洞爲雁蕩名勝之一。絶巖裂石。直馳天道。北斗洞侍之於側。雙筍峯屹立於前。頗爲壯偉。洞口一蜿蜒小道學入門即聞水聲潺潺。蓋泉水流自懸崖之側也。拾級而登。有樓焉。初極狹。豁然開朗。可飲酒作畫。樓凡十三。依崖石自然之階段。層次建築。幽雅異常。登臨遠望。而半山雲霧。萬山翠拔。山川之奇氣。驚心摇魄。洵大觀也。寺僧酬酢久之。猛昻其首。遥指洞空中語余曰。此桂圓奇樹也。余儕爲之驚。共仰觀之。隠中果見一大樹。屹立於洞空之懸崖上。微微摇閃。自最高樓望之。僅小如一指。蓋下去洞底己不知幾千丈也。余爲驚嘆再三。僧又語曰。此樹之奇妙。不能言喻。每年節近中秋。桂圓即熟而落。其尤奇者。一年僅落一顆。大如梨。異香美味。戲以供神。逈非市間肆售之俗物所能比擬。僧又謂洞中相傳此樹。乃洞天之創始神所植。示聖地也。今己歷數千年矣。山中風霜雨雪。獨不能動其雄姿。殆亦挹天地精英山川秀氣之所成者歟。</p>
<h3>記河北淶邑之重嘴魚</h3>
<p>— 掊李</p>
<p>魚之名馳於天下者。如黄河之鯉。松江之鱸等。固爲吾人所共聞共見。獨少記載。尤有人未詳其經歷。爰濡筆記之。以供生物學者之研究。</p>
<p>淶邑位於西陵北隅。多産木炭。地方百里。有山前山後之分。山後荒僻多山。民風悍暴。山前地稍平坦。民智較開。與山後聲氣鮮通。諸多隔膜。感情上尤不融洽。距山前城西十里之遥。有一崖壑。忘其名。俗稱潤水壑。周圍方五六尺。深不盈丈。界於山水之間。風景秀麗。冠乎全邑。每逢冬至立春時令間。日必産魚十餘尾。形與尋常逈異。鱗甲細微。色白如銀。魚身肥而長。首尾較尖。嘴下重生一嘴。其狀相等烹飪後異香撲鼻。甘旨適口。堪稱爲無上佳餚。且其産數。日有定數。設釣者今晨盡索無餘。則竟日一無所獲。明日復往釣弋。得魚如昔。曩者邑人視爲珍罕之物。選作貢品。不輕欵客。市上絶無。更非人間所易偶嘗也。民國肇興。陋風剷除。遂有時爲饋贈禮物。流入人間。甲子冬。余服務平漢路站務稽核員時。適友人陳君杞憂長淶邑。曾荷邀入衙中度歲。是夕席半。得啖是魚。座中人無不羨贊不己。經由座上某紳士解釋經過後。余感此來口福實多。而比之黄鯉松鱸。實有天壤之别也。</p>
<h3>旅歐漫談（一）</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>爲研究古代與近代的美術。在意大利各地住了一月之久。當我們要離開羅馬前一天的黄昏。使館秘書瞿常同余蔭甫來替我們算清房金。房主是意大利人。有一女。善舞蹈。蔭甫初習舞。性又活潑。其滑稽如卓别靈。因爲我們明天要動身。所以做了許多餘興。表示臨别歡送的意思。舞蹈完了。就在庽所對面一家戲院觀電影。電影中雜以唱做各一節。這電影院。在羅馬雖是中等。惟建築極新頴。屋頂隨時可以移動。在休息時間。完全去其天井之蓋。直接流通空氣。好像坐在露天似的。這樣電影院的建築。我在英法德各國。都己見過。講到内部裝飾。簡而美觀。合現代流行之立方形圖案。使人觀感舒適。上海近年來電影事業非常發達。有幾個電影院的建築。其内部亦頗不弱於歐洲。如果有像羅馬電影院的建築發見。說不定會使觀客更爲滿意。</p>
<p>翌晨六時起身。我到街上先去購些車上用的食物。時候太早。有些商店還未啓門。只見水菓店將開。買了各種水菓。意大利的橘子。是有名的。味甜而水分多。價亦便宜。一基羅兩里拉。（合國幣三角）較德法便宜幾倍。據說意大利每天單是橘子一項。要裝四五列車出境哩。七時二十分上車。陳德義到車上來送行。德義天津人。三年前入羅馬皇家音樂學校肄業。專習音樂。國人在歐洲習音樂者。只會些技巧。不知深邃的學理。德義專考樂譜。己頗有深造。我到羅馬。得些說明羅馬古蹟歷史的帮助頗多。他到站臺。離開車的時間僅五分鐘。略爲談了些臨别的話。覺車輛己蠕蠕動了。</p>

<p>肺癆必死說與肺病新療法由　國肺結核雜誌抄醫</p>
<p>（一）肺癆必死說之由來</p>
<p>間流行之疾病雖多｀然醫療之難·瀰蔓之賡·未有如肺結核（即肺癆病）者·肺結核之侵害吾人·院時院地·無有間斷·爲害人最深殺人最多之傳染病·吾人所最恐怖者也·伊古以來</p>
<p>。斷定肺癆爲必死病。良以罹之之後·實難療治·故醫士遇之·束手无策·患者遇之·心驚贍落·日有短命之憂而己矣·及到近代·醫學　步·名醫輩出·精密研究·始知肺結核實韭必死之絶症·如療養得法·初期中治愈者·十之八九·即歷二三期者·亦有就痊之希望·惟罹病過久·旣　最後末期之患者·無療救之法·然罹病甚久·以致不能療治者·不獨肺結核爲然·願罹此病者·於其初中期·愼毋忘忽·療養可也。</p>
<p>「肺癆必死」之古說·深入世人之腦中·故凡患肺病者·一聞醫士之肺結核診斷。即如受死刑之宣判。心神沮喪。日事憂懼。一切療養。均置之不問。偶有知識階級。思慮及之。亦不知施何種之攝生法。行何種之療治術。家族對於患者。又不知爲何種之調理。設何種之保護。以致能治愈之疾病。不能治愈能免傳染之家人。不免傳染。肺病之害毒。日趨於盛。其瀰蔓之廣。小之一家一鄉。大之一國。豈非人生之一大慘事哉。</p>
<h3>（二）肺癆病原菌之發現</h3>
<p>自古以來。中西醫界。就肺癆之病原體。曾有許多種種之空論　說。均暗黑不明矣。最近有德國細菌學大家考克博士。發見結核菌爲肺癆病之原因。破此千萬古黑暗。而發一線之大光明。彼虎列拉菌爲虎列拉病之原因。白喉菌爲白喉病菌之原因·赤痢菌爲赤痢病之原因。其他若梅毒之發生。基於梅毒菌。癩病之發生。亦基於癩菌。諒爲舉世共知。肺結核亦然。其發生之原因。基於結核菌。此菌最喜侵龔人類。其棲息繁殖。大抵在吾人之肺　中。人類之被其害者。不可勝算。往時占世界人口七分之一。近代占六分之一。都市則　五分之一。　爲流行最廣之傳染病也。</p>
<h3>（三）肺病者之二大恩人</h3>
<p>（一）德國考克博士一八四三年。生於德國葛勞司城。家可小康。故幼年安心向學。中學卒業後。歷入國中諸大學。研究管　學。年未三十。即發明癰之細菌。國中名醫。爲之傾倒。越數載。於一八八二年三月二十四日。考克博士。乃以研究發明之肺結核菌。發表於德京柏林生理學大會席上。當時各國醫學界。爲之震動。德國政府。嘉其精學。任考克博士爲衞生院院長。各國帝王。又贈高等勲章。各國大學。爭以名譽學位寄贈。一九零五年。諾伯爾醫學巨獎。亦及考氏。可謂極學界之尊榮。今之醫治肺癆者。無不基於考氏之發明。其有功　救人濟世。誠世界人類之所當感謝者也。</p>
<p>（二）德國柏格爾博士自考克博士發見結核菌爲肺結核之病原體以來。東西結核學者。爭先研究。欲期得一殺滅此菌之妙方。但其結果。盡歸失敗。蓋歷來一般醫家。因未明瞭肺結核菌之别具一種特殊性搆造。自柏格爾博士。苦心研究後。始發見肺結核菌。有一種特殊之防禦力。能抵抗一切外來　力之攻擊。蓋結核菌體。係中性脂肪之内膜及抗酸性蠟質之外膜所搆成。若非設法破壞其蠟質之防線及解除其脂肪性之武裝。則無由浮擒結核菌。而置之死地。因此我普天下肺病者之大恩師柏格爾博士。搜集一切動植礦物性各種　物·而苦心研究。孜孜數十年。不知絞盡幾許腦汁。瀝盡幾許心血。最近終發明特殊物動之腸間膜腺壓縮汁中。有一特種　　成分。對於結核菌。有强力脫蠟之作用。此實前後千古醫學界一大疑問的肺結核根本療法之大成功也。</p>
<h3>德國納得博士製肺内動脈及氣管支分布圖</h3>
<p>（四肺結核之特効療法第八十一圖）</p>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌。而此菌一入體内。則於該處。便成結節。以斷血行之路。又結核菌能分泌一種　酸性蠟質。所圍其體。以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入。故雖用種種殺菌藥。内服或注射。終不能達其病菌之實體内。歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法。對症療法。理學的療法。血淸療注。藥劑療法。及其他一切治療法等。尙未完全成功。而肺病無藥之説。遍滿於一世者。因未知此深奥學理故耳。由此現代結核學者。根據上述之學理。繼續研究。不遺餘力。結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑。名曰三那星Ｓａｎｏｓｉｎ此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脱蠟衛發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者。據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告。此藥有滲透肺病　之結節及溶解蠟質之作用。兼具有殺菌力。能根治一二三期之肺癆·確有萬試萬靈之特效。在中國。業經國民政府中　衞生試驗所化驗。藥性和平無毒。絶無任何副作用。兹略舉醫治作用於下。</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中。實　（三那星）之藥力作用。則一分鐘後。結核菌皆消失其抗酸性。至三分鐘後。則此肺結核菌。完全殺盡。無一倖免。</p>
<p>（二）依動物試驗。則發見（三那星）能滲人結核病竈内。設檢查其病竈内潛伏之結核菌。則靈失其抗酸性。此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣。</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服（三那星）一星期左右。則立見咯痰稀釋。體熱下降等良好狀態。</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服（三那星）達三十天至六十天以上。則顯見體重增加。食慾激進。一切症狀。</p>
<p>逐漸緩和。終達其回天兩造之偉功。</p>
<p>▲奉送三那星實驗報告書及肺病療養指導書函索即寄</p>

<p>（二）美國物價之一斑</p>
<p>（三）美國米性和烹魚法</p>
<p>（四）他邦遇故知</p>
<p>（五）美國鄉村概况和中産農家生活的三日觀</p>
<p>松江陸爾昭寄自美國喬奇省</p>
<p>一九三○年十二月十九日起、至翌年一月五日止、爲本衛斯理wesleyan大學耶誕假期、爾昭自九月初旬到美、考入本校求學、忽忽己經半年、一學期學程、告一段落了、放假前一日、我們三個亞洲學生、（一爲回國同學謝君、一爲日本女子芝間田君、）開一緊急會議、如何度此假期内很經濟、有興趣的生活、蓋學校規程、「異國學生可以留校、但膳食須由各留校生自理、」我們會商之下、組織主席團、用分工合作方法、（一）交際、（教授及各同學等來往書札、贈送禮物、）（一）衞生、（轉運物品、調和鼎鼐、）（一）勞工、（整理各部、盪滌器物、）但三大部分中、職務雖分情感甚洽、憲法旣定、擇期施行、一俟假期、遵行唯謹、三人畫　後、一若受法律之拘束焉、</p>
<p>十九日晨、上課二小時、十一時起放假了、諸同學各换新衣、預備回家省親、有好幾位笑容可掬、誠意相親、與爾昭握手作暫時之話别、有幾位、未知心理作用的同學、向我說、回家後、如何與父母二親談話、如何探望親朋、如何晏客往還、絮絮不休、談到五六分鐘之久、我受了這環境、也不免有思家感想了、然爾時鼓着勇氣、力與周旋、絶對不敢露戀家怕遠的弱小女子態度、迨十一時一刻、鐘聲大作、諸同學各自飛奔、向行李室、取行李、乘車回家去了、一煞那間、數百畝寛大之校址、數千人熱鬧之塲所、祗賸兩個美籍女教授、三個亞洲的新學生（閽人警士除外）了、漢書翟公謂「門可羅雀」、差不多爲我校寫照也、晚間我們三個亞洲學生、各返臥室、整理新式布置而休息了、寒窗獨坐、作詩寄家、</p>
<p>暫别慈顔己半年、喬奇翹首望雲間、</p>
<p>家園梅嶺花開未、翠幄松圍小石山、</p>
<p>翌晨（二十日）我等三人和教授兩人、遷於一宅、藉破寂寥、凡臥室、餐室、會客室、以及電爐、煤氣灶、自來水、和種種雜用物件、應有盡有、於是衞生部長開始工作、爾昭謬膺是職、不得不首先出馬、乘車赴市購物、價格列左、</p>
<p>▲物品價格表</p>
<p>品類　數量　　價格</p>
<p>米　　五磅　　兩角五分</p>
<p>魚　　每磅　　一角</p>
<p>蛋　　每打　　四角五分</p>
<p>其他油鹽醬醋茶等、酌購若干、滿載而歸、噫、曩時教學琴歌地、今日汕鹽醬醋茶、可發一笑、但有一事不能不特别提出者、美國之米、韌而軟、如中國之糯米、某教授旨導造飯法、於是煮米至沸度後、將飯湯傾去、用冷水洗之、洗至渣滓盡凈、乃一釜煑成、始得噉良好之米飯、此一事也、又有一要難之點、烹魚無酒、美政府酒禁森嚴、無處可買、於是以糖作代用品、味尚可口、而美教授謂美國魚類、本無腥氣、昭等未敢盡以爲然也、一日三餐、飯後洗滌膳具、三人合作、實行美國家庭制、蓋目前美傭、月薪甚昻、社會上、都自行操作、昭等也暫掛神聖牌銜、充作勞　了、</p>
<p>二十二四、爲我國禹飛釜全節、我與謝君、芝間田君會商、買　菜、生電氣煖鍋、實行吃冬至年夜飯、正在籌備時期、而黄友葵女士、惠然肯來了、按黄女士、係蘇州束吳大學畢業生、今夏來美、在阿耳罷母（Alabama）女子大學（women、sCkllege）求學、他們的校中、僅有她一個人是中國人、數月以來、從未講中國語一句、心中異當納悶、所以不遠數百里而來、於假期内、與我兩人暢談國語、黄君降臨、非常愉快、古語云「他鄉遇故知」、而况異國、又云「聽得鄉音魂欲醉、雖非相識也相親」、而况相知有素的同志乎、那時好像開足了談話機器、無話不談、有談皆暢、暢所欲言、直到拂曉、東坡先生所謂「不知東方之旣白」、簡直有此景象咧、人皆說冬至夜長、我覺得此夕何其短呢、聨床其話、消遣良宵、至可樂也、</p>
<p>從二三日至二十九日、這幾天中、忙於酬應、某同學送橘子一函、某同學送Pecorns、與胡桃相仿的是美國特産、其餘食物、裝飾品等、絡繹不絶、於是交際部長忙得不了、爾昭也告奮勇、願作交際部的書記、信札往返、案無留牘、那時兩教授看見我們三人事務殷繁、笑語我等假日靜寂的空氣、被你們衝破、一變而爲熱鬧市塲了、相與大笑者久之、</p>
<p>十二月三十日、爾昭應同學Vienue女士的約、到彼家度歲、她家住在梅根地方、該地風景、宛然吾國本鄉附近的泗涇鎭一般、同學的父母俱存、她的母親、在一千九百零六年、畢業於衞斯理大學、與中國宋家大女兒同班、（據云即孔夫人）其父、爲一中産的田主、有田十餘頃、工人數輩、供其指揮、雇黑人廚司一名、但任烹調之職、家庭中房屋洒掃、賓客應對、亭園布置、悉由兒女分任、她有兩兄一妹、均在學校求學、平時朝出暮歸、一家之中、雍雍如也、爾昭在彼作客三日、欵待殷勤、宰豕作食、其一種誠懇意態、出於自於、初不令人有跼蹐不安之象、三日之中、絶無喧呼叱之聲、滿布和樂安舒之景、其八歲之妹、相助操作、一如成人、每晨七時後到爾昭客房中、伺應一切、處置合宜、令人心感、三日中美國鄉村生活、在該處附近、瀏覽一周、約略詢問、知農作半用科學方式、天災預籌抵禦方法、物産豐盈、家給人足、回憶幼時母親教論孟子、至「富之教之」句、及「申之以孝弟」句、比稍長、讀管子「衣食足而知樂辱、倉廪實而知禮節」句、初不覺其有味、今則恍然大悟、</p>
<p>一月三日晨、（一九三一年、）辭别返校、預備求學事宜、并收拾假期内之布置、取消各部長職務、還我學生的本來面目、假期生活、告一結束、學生工作、繼續進行了、一月六日晨照常受課、</p>
<p>中華民國二十年（一九三一）一月五日下午八時陸爾昭記於衞斯理大學宿舍内、</p>
<h3>訂婚前</h3>
<p>— 子秋</p>
<p>求智與求愛、是不能平行的、這句話、凡是與許君相過從的、大概都知道了、於是我們對於許君的擇偶問題、便有相當的認識、時間如白雲一般的推進、處全校小弟弟地位的十九年級、竟然變成老大哥了、在一個環列奉觴歡送畢業生的盛大離别筵上、我們恭賀許君戴方帽、同時預祝他求愛的成功、</p>
<p>在規謹的微笑中、許簡潔地作了聰頴的回答、他說、</p>
<p>「經過了大小百十餘考、我們的求智一方面、似乎己經告一段落了、今後我們所應努力的、便是人生最難解决兩大問題、｜服務與擇偶、」</p>
<p>消息從校刋傳來、許君己榮任某局的技士了、我們在欣幸之餘、同時又聨想到許的　二大問題、</p>
<p>「許、進行到如何程度了、」一天在日　樓無惹中遇到許、我便這樣地問、</p>
<p>「唉、磨折、竟有這許多磨折、不過……不過也可說在試騐中、」簡短的答語、尚未告終、許己怱怱地伸出手來表示告别、</p>
<p>從黑魆　光滑的頭髮、白皚皚的粉臉上、我得到了暗示、覺得許今天是異樣了、神情上多少總含有神秘的分子存在着、於是向背行了幾步、由好奇心的勃發、我便掉轉身來、追隨許、亦步亦趨進了永安公司、許到了文具櫃、便停止了、於是我便遠遠的站着、</p>
<p>終究這幕神秘的喜劇開演了、許的身旁多了一個明媚秀逸的少女、經過了雙方互視的過程、許的嘴唇微微地動了一會、對方似乎有了響應、他與她便並肩由邊門出去了、我因爲職務的關係、便上了五路電車、</p>
<p>荏苒地經過了兩月、我們便得到了許結婚的請帖、我好像新郎一般熱望着這一天的到臨、在想望一個可喜日期的人們、總覺得司時之神是頴慧的、因爲他在不知不覺中推進着、</p>
<p>在風光撩亂的、禮堂中、司儀員己唱到新人報告戀愛經過的一節、許在羣衆狂熱希冀中登台了、</p>
<p>「我倆經某先生某先生的介紹、認爲滿意、承諸位來賓前來觀禮、非常榮幸、……「許簡單地作聊以塞責的報告、</p>
<p>在追求戀愛的靑年聽了這種乏味的報告、當然不能滿意了、於是在鼓噪聲中、歐首先發難了、</p>
<p>「許君的學士帽、是一百八十個試騐報告所組成的、他是研究數理的人、無論什麽事實都要根據試騐、這次求愛的經過、至少有二十個報告可編、限即刻繳卷、」</p>
<p>「許、不必太諱飾、請先報告永安公司的試騐罷、否則我可要代拆代行了、「我因爲許的族侣、確是上次喜劇中的主角、所以很興奮地發言了、</p>
<p>許覺得我們或者有更進一步的認識、｜或者因爲他倆的婚姻確有報告的價值、所以乾脆流利的發言了、</p>
<p>「好友、這一次婚姻、並不是父母之命、媒灼之言、但也不是自由花所結成的果子、我認爲我倆走了婚姻道上一條新蹊徑、我自從畢業後、人人知道我要努力求愛了、所以家中的長老、更積極進行我的擇偶問題、不幸得很、處在今日畸形的社交生活、竟然使没有我覓到對手的可能、所以終究給長老們努力進行中、捷足先登了、當初、我總覺得有些進退失據、同意麽、前途幪幢、反對麽、環境上似乎很少可能性、瞻望前途的渺茫、這潮湧奔放的心靈、竟浮沉不定、最後因鑒於蒺藜當道裹足不前的可悲、不問不聞、反易惹起黑暗、於是我毅然决然在一個夜裏寫了一封短簡給茜、她便是我現在所認滿意的配偶、也便是長老議婚中的主角、這信是這樣寫了、」</p>
<p>「茜女士、冒　得很、我寫這信的動機、是求雙方將來的光明、因爲我倆現在正在被人支配着做締姻劇中的主角、我想這樣幪幢地受支配着、在雙方當事者的心靈中、終不免有糢糊失據的遺憾罷、所以我想我們不如直裁爽快的自己起來解决終身的幸福、這辦法、便是我要求你做個朋友、……」茜女士不愧爲一個有　識的女子、她十分贊同的允准了、第二封信、我便約她在永安文具　相會、當時因爲雙方都不知道誰是誰、所以我特别知照她我手中拿某月某日的舊申報、並囑她在襟上添挿一朶妃色的　花、以資識别、這便是李所見的第一幕試騐罷、以後一方面、我們進行着各個的認識、一方面敷衍着各個家中的長老們、使我們的婚姻、不即不離的懸着、經過了二月的交接、各方都有相互的認識了、雙方都感到相當的滿意了、所以這件懸案、終究是美滿地解决了、」</p>
<p>因爲許破格詳盡的報告、我們在來賓演說中、聽到了幾句很好的評語、是這樣的、</p>
<p>一父母親友所介紹的婚姻、子女們倘使能事先努力自己去認識、去鑒别、那便不是盲目了、子女們自己求愛的成功、做父母的更無須固執的反對、祇要能加以相當的考慮、嚴格的審察、因爲父母是富有經騐的過來人、子女是含有熱望的當事者、雙方能相輔而行、那便十有九成可收美滿的效果了、倘使誰要束縛着誰、那便要到黑暗和苦悶的境界了、」</p>
<p>在肴馨酒冽的喜筵席上、許來敬酒了、</p>
<p>「許眞是一個膽大心細的人、」歐由羨慕而欽佩了、</p>
<p>於是許的臉上、重現一陣規謹的微笑、</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Report on Hu Hanmin's Resignation</h3>
<p>Entirely due to personal political differences</p>
<p>A proper attitude of a statesman</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet for all members of the Legislative Yuan on the evening of the 4th. Regarding Hu's resignation, he reported on the process and the original words were as follows:</p>
<p>"Some comrades may not understand the truth of Comrade Hu Hanmin's resignation this time. Tonight, I have specially invited all comrades to a dinner to briefly explain the situation so that you can understand the process. Comrade Hu Hanmin has a long history in the party and a deep relationship with the party. Therefore, all comrades in the Central Committee respect his opinions very much, regardless of the matter. For example, when the war was about to end last year, Zhongzheng, deeply reflecting on the battlefield, wanted to permanently eliminate civil war in China and prevent compatriots from killing each other. He also wanted to obtain a truly reliable method to guarantee unification. After investigating the origins of the war and how to avoid civil war, he seriously considered and issued the Jiang telegram, advocating four points: (1) Advance the Fourth National Congress; (2) Quickly convene a National Assembly; (3) Agree on a Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage; (4) Pardon political and military prisoners. However, Comrade Hu has always opposed the early convening of the National Congress. Even today, when the statutory period has arrived, he is still unwilling to convene it. He also does not quite agree with the pardon of political and military prisoners. The amnesty decree issued on New Year's Day differs greatly from the original intention of my Jiang telegram. However, due to Comrade Hu's firm insistence, the Central Committee comrades also reluctantly complied. I am especially willing to sacrifice my own opinions and accommodate his views. However, the issue of the Provisional Constitution is the most important key to the life and death of our party and China. The Central Committee comrades and Zhongzheng have repeatedly stated that a Provisional Constitution is necessary during the period of political tutelage, and deeply hope to obtain Comrade Hu's understanding. Since there are still more than two months before the National Assembly is convened, we are extremely willing to discuss it at length to achieve a satisfactory result. However, Comrade Hu, regardless of everything, formally announced in the Propaganda Department in his name last week that the National Assembly should not discuss the issue of the Provisional Constitution. The Central Committee comrades were very dissatisfied with this. A member of the Control Yuan even wanted to file an impeachment case. I have political responsibility and had to mediate to avoid disputes. I also declared to the member that political issues would be resolved under my responsibility, and please do not file an impeachment. Therefore, last Saturday, I invited all Central Committee members to discuss the issue of the Provisional Constitution. Zhongzheng believes that the Central Committee comrades usually respect Comrade Hu and can compromise on everything. However, this concerns the great policy of China's fortune and survival, and we must strive for it with our resignation. Recalling that the Premier once told me in Japan that I can compromise on Comrade Hanmin's proposals in everything, but I will never compromise on matters related to the Three Principles of the People and major policies. The Premier has repeatedly told Zhongzheng and other comrades this. Zhongzheng regards the issue of the Provisional Constitution as the greatest key to the success or failure of the revolution, the major policy of our party and the government, and there must be a solution. Therefore, I declared at that time that if Comrade Hu believes that Zhongzheng's proposal on the Provisional Constitution is erroneous, then Zhongzheng can resign and retire. However, Comrade Hu himself believed that his proposal was inconsistent with the Central Committee comrades, and immediately resigned due to illness. The next morning, he went to Tangshan with Comrade Shao Yuanchong to recuperate. The Central Committee comrades also believe that Comrade Hu's responsible resignation is indeed the attitude that a politician should have. It is appropriate to deeply appreciate Comrade Hu's distress that his proposal will not be implemented during the National Assembly convocation period. Therefore, it was decided to approve it at the Central Temporary Standing Committee meeting on the 2nd. This matter is entirely due to Comrade Hu's personal political views and has nothing to do with the Legislative Yuan's various members. I hope that all comrades will understand the process so that our Chinese politics can enter the right track and not involve the entire political situation due to personal emotions."

<h3>Hu is Ill in Tangshan</h3>
<p>Dai Jitao and Sun Ke Visit</p>
<p>He Fainted Twice the Night Before</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Hu Hanmin resigned from his positions as State Councilor and President of the Legislative Yuan and went to Tangshan to recuperate, his illness has gradually worsened due to the unsuitable climate there. Deng Zhendi, the chief medical officer of the Ministry of Railways, was invited to treat him. When he arrived in Tangshan, Hu was still in the living room reading. Deng examined him at that time and found that his body temperature was 100 degrees, his pulse was 84 beats per minute, his tongue coating was very thick, he had a poor appetite, could not eat, had neck pain, his hemorrhoids had recurred, and he also had a severe cough due to a slight cold. He could only sleep for one or two hours each night. After Deng administered medication, his body temperature decreased slightly, but his neck still hurt and he was even more tired. At 4:30 p.m. on the 4th, Hu got up to urinate and suddenly fainted. Fortunately, Hu's daughter was nearby to support him, preventing him from falling to the ground. They urgently asked Deng to examine him, and his pulse became even weaker. They immediately used hot water to keep him warm and rescued him. After more than ten minutes, he regained consciousness. At 5:30 a.m., Hu got up to defecate and fainted again. Deng and his daughter helped him up and used hot water and other methods to rescue him, and he recovered. He could only drink a little milk and could not eat other food. Deng saw that Hu's illness was getting worse and that the medicines in Tangshan were incomplete, so he returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 5th to visit Chiang and Dai Jitao and report on Hu's condition. When Dr. Deng entered the city, Hu's daughter insisted on keeping him from leaving, but Deng told her that the medicines here were not complete and that staying here would be helpless, so she tearfully sent him out and instructed him to bring all the medicines and return to Tangshan as soon as possible. At 11:00 a.m., Deng visited Chiang and Dai and then returned to the Ministry of Railways. A phone call came from Tangshan saying that Hu was vomiting severely and asking him to go immediately. Deng immediately took the medicines and drove back to Tangshan. In the afternoon at 2:00 p.m., Dai Jitao and Sun Ke both went to Tangshan to visit Hu. According to Deng, the climate in Tangshan is not suitable for Hu's condition, and the medicines are inconvenient. If he does not move into the city for recuperation, he may not be able to recover in a short time. (Telegraph from the 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Jitao and Sun Ke, accompanied by Liu Ruiheng, went to Tangshan to visit Hu's illness at 2:00 p.m. on the 5th and returned to the city at 7:00 p.m. It is reported that Dai and others, considering that Tangshan is far from the city and for the convenience of medicine, have asked Hu to move to his residence in Nanjing for treatment and care, and he is expected to return to Nanjing within a few days. Also, Hu has written many poems since going to Tangshan. (Telegraph from the 5th)</p>

Because the communist bandits in Honghu are urgently to be suppressed, I temporarily remained in Hankou to supervise. Fortunately, the bandit lairs were gradually broken, so I immediately led my troops to Shashi some time ago to take up defense. I presented to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, who in turn ordered the Hankou Headquarters to send an oath supervisor to Shashi. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, I respectfully and diligently took the oath of office as the Pacification and Bandit Suppression Commissioner of the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan Border Area in the Commissioner's Office. I am humbled by my incompetence and mistakenly hold this important post. The times are difficult and the responsibility is heavy, and I am deeply fearful. However, because the central government relies on me and the people are waiting for relief, I cannot but exhaust my poor abilities and strive to be effective. I hope that the party and state elders and the virtuous and heroic from home and abroad will not spare their advice and show me the way so that everything can be followed. This is what I pray for."

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Anglo-Irish Agreement</h3>
<p>The methods of communication that countries around the world take, whether regarding allies or colonies, generally include two routes, those of force and those of leniency. If they can be forceful, then they oppress with military power. If they cannot be forceful, then they must assess the situation, resolve to concede, and attempt a quick resolution. They do not care if they are seen as being subdued. However, if they cannot be strong and they cannot be weak, and they simply support themselves with words, delaying the decision, then not only is it unhelpful, but it also creates additional problems and increases people's doubts. It also leads to a situation where it cannot be resolved. This is not a good policy. Today, in this situation where the world is troubled by both public and private difficulties, no one with great ambitions dares to speak lightly of using military force. If military force is not used, but instead, it is merely used to create an atmosphere of agitation and turmoil, then rumors will increase and fear will increase. Increased fear is not good for the world. The authorities of the major European powers are now aware of this. Therefore, France and Italy have made mutual concessions and established a naval agreement to express understanding between the two countries. Although the issue between England and India seems to only pertain to internal affairs, its impact and the severity of its dispute are no less than that of international communications between Italy and France. Now, the government and the civil parties there have also expressed a willingness to concede and establish an Anglo-Irish agreement to reverse the dangerous situation between England and India. Both of these events were extremely difficult to resolve, but they have now been resolved in an instant and successfully achieved beyond expectations. That is why the opinion of that country is unable to contain its joy.</p>
<p>I believe that the reason why the authorities have come to this awareness is not without cause. Today is the time to focus all efforts on reorganizing commerce. How to internally provide relief to the unemployed and how to externally develop trade are both matters that cannot be delayed even slightly. If there is a suspicion of non-peace, obstructing the hearts of the world, then this will be enough to hinder the progress of all things and especially impact the future of commerce. Therefore, it is necessary to first eliminate it. However, these two agreements can only be said to be preliminary successes. The efforts needed in the future are many.</p>

<h3>All-India Congress Abolishes Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>Content of Gandhi-Viceroy Agreement</p>
<p>Implementing Details Under Discussion</p>
<p>Silver Market Expected to Improve</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New Delhi, 5th Gandhi and the All-India Congress Executive Committee have abolished non-violent resistance, non-payment of taxes, and other similar movements.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New Delhi, 4th The terms of the important agreement established between India and Gandhi have now been released as follows: (1) Cease non-violent resistance; (2) Do not use boycotts of British goods as a political tool; (3) Those arrested for non-violent resistance, without violence, will be released; (4) People in salt-producing areas, especially the poor, are allowed to collect and produce salt for their own consumption or sale within the village; (5) Non-aggressive picketing may be permitted; (6) Orders issued during the non-violent resistance movement will be withdrawn; (7) Do not interfere with the buying and selling of British goods.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New Delhi, 4th Gandhi met with officials from the Home Department today to discuss the details of implementing the agreement, lasting seven hours. The talks mainly concerned the return of confiscated property and the release of political prisoners. Although all the terms have not yet been fully disclosed, leaders of the All-India Congress claim that they have promised not to use boycotts as a political tool and have restricted the activities of pickets, as they must abandon hostile tools when arranging a truce. It is said that only peaceful picketing can be used according to the agreement. However, according to a member of the All-India Congress, the external boycott remains unchanged. ▲Reuters, London, 4th The Secretary of State for India stated in the House of Commons today that the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, has reported to the department stating that the talks in New Delhi were successfully completed last night.

<h3>U.S. Congress Adjourns</h3>
<p>President Approves 180 New Cases</p>
<p>Senate Silver Loan Bill Still Unreported</p>
<p>▲United Press, Washington, 4th Although the 71st Congress had many unfinished matters, it had to adjourn today due to constitutional constraints. Many bills passed in recent days have been sent to the White House, so the President's desk is piled high with documents. No less than 180 cases were approved today, one of which is that the Star-Spangled Banner should be recognized as the US flag. This flag has been used for a century, but it has not been officially stipulated by Congress. There are also many cases that were passed by Congress but were shelved because the House of Representatives did not propose them. One of them is the bill prohibiting American ships from carrying non-American sailors into the country. There is another important bill that has not been reported after being reviewed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so it was dropped, which is the request of the Pittman Committee for various countries to pool silver to lend to China.</p>
<h3>Franco-Italian Naval Agreement Established</h3>
<p>Can Be Described as a Great Political Achievement</p>
<p>U.S. Authorities Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>Henderson Reports on Negotiations</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 4th Foreign Secretary Henderson, when speaking in the House of Commons today about the recent naval negotiations, said that the naval agreement must be agreed upon by all the signatory countries of the London Naval Treaty. Regardless of any restrictions on the construction of new ships, the highlight of this agreement is the political achievement, as it prevents the recurrence of naval competition. If the negotiations had broken down, the atmosphere of next year's disarmament conference would have deteriorated. He believes that when countries gather in Geneva in the future, there will be a better hope of proceeding along these lines to achieve ultimate success. In any case, this agreement can greatly increase the friendship and cooperation not only between the countries currently involved, but also between all signatory countries of the London Naval Treaty. The terms of the agreement are not yet convenient to announce and must be made public after the signatory countries of the London Treaty, including the British overseas autonomous territories, have considered them. He hopes that next week, the First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander will be able to report on the details of the agreement when debating the naval budget. Henderson also briefly described the origins of the negotiations, saying that after naval representatives from Britain, France, and Italy had negotiated for a long time, he, the Prime Minister, and the First Lord of the Admiralty, considering the possibility that naval power would continue to increase if a solution was not agreed upon immediately, were convinced that it would not succeed without important cabinet members from each country personally negotiating. Therefore, the First Lord of the Admiralty and he hastily left London on February 23rd. The reception in Paris was very friendly, as was the case in Rome. Furthermore, he saw the sincerity of both countries in establishing an agreement and was thus able to overcome the serious difficulties that had previously hindered the agreement.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 4th The First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander stated in the House of Commons today that the recent agreement between Britain, France, and Italy to replace warships is within the scope of the London Naval Treaty. The government hopes that this agreement will not hinder the goals of future world disarmament conferences. British naval policy is now based on this hope.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 4th President Hoover officially issued a statement today that the Franco-Italian naval agreement negotiated by Britain is a cause for celebration for the world. Secretary of State Stimson also anticipates that the agreement will be satisfactory to the United States.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Rome, 5th Although the full text of the new naval agreement has not yet been released, the Italian newspaper has freely commented on it. Many solemnly declare that the new treaty specifically regulates various aspects of naval forces and will not affect Italy's foreign policy or its attitude towards attending the International Disarmament Conference next year. It also states that Italy can build 130,000 tons of new ships to replace old ones until 1936, with France only being able to build 6,000 tons more than Italy. Therefore, when the London Treaty expires, Italy will have 540,000 tons of new warships. Although France may have 670,000 tons, 84,000 tons of which will be warships that are too old. As for submarines, it is agreed not to build new submarines before the end of this year. The total tonnage will be limited to 52,000 tons for Italy and 80,000 tons for France. Furthermore, aircraft carriers are limited to 46,000 tons for both countries. Other points are generally consistent with the news previously reported by newspapers in other countries.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Visits Austrian Capital</h3>
<p>Seeking Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Vienna, 4th After the German Foreign Minister Curtius, accompanied by several officials, paid an official visit to Austria, he issued an important declaration here today, stating that the main purpose of this trip is to discuss the possibility of joint economic action between the two countries in order to devise ways to remedy the economic decline that has arisen in both countries due to world trends. This kind of difficult situation can only be remedied through international cooperation. Although no one dares to say what the solution is today, it is inevitable that it must proceed along the paths of existing treaties and joint efforts. German policy is based on maintaining and safeguarding peace and will not slacken in its pursuit of this goal, but must proceed with peaceful methods. Austrian Prime Minister Schober has declared that although Germany and Austria are two countries, they are actually one nation. He expresses his deep agreement. Today, their work is to serve this nation, so the policies of the two countries will naturally tend to be consistent.</p>

<h3>Lady Mosley of Britain Announces Departure from Labour Party</h3>
<p>Labour Party Ideology Concedes and Degenerates</p>
<p>Insufficient to Resolve Economic Problems</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 4th The wife of Mosley, a former member of the Labour cabinet who has now formed a new party and a member of Parliament, has sent a letter to the Prime Minister announcing her departure from the Labour Party. The lady is the daughter of the Conservative Marquess Curzon. She married Mosley, a Conservative member of Parliament, in 1920. In 1926, the couple both switched to the Labour Party. The gist of the letter is that the current Labour government is no different from the previous Liberal and Conservative governments. The recent remarks of Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden especially show that the Labour government has completely succumbed to and degenerated into opposing ideas, so she has decided to leave the party. She believes that only socialist solutions are the ultimate solution to Britain's economic problems.</p>

<h3>The Current Situation in Guangxi Amidst Calls for Peace</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Jitang Returns to Guangdong via Hong Kong, Chen Mingshu Goes to Hong Kong</p>
<p>▲ Transportation on the Fu and Da Rivers in Guangxi Fully Restored</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Regarding the consultation on the aftermath of the Guangxi incident, since Huang Shaoxiong came to Guangdong and contacted the local authorities, considerable progress has been made. Mr. Huang then returned to Hong Kong the day before yesterday, stating that he would wait in Hong Kong to meet Chen Jitang for another round of consultations before returning to Guangxi. Currently, Mr. Lu Jingqiu has been sent back to Guangxi to prepare for the establishment of the Guangxi Post-War Public Office. Mr. Chen Jitang arrived in Hong Kong on the President Cleveland ship from Shanghai at noon on the 27th. The provincial authorities had pre-arranged the Zhongshan warship to welcome him in Hong Kong. After Chen and others arrived in Hong Kong, they immediately disembarked onto the Zhongshan warship. It is reported that Chen suffered a slight illness on the ship and therefore did not receive guests in Hong Kong, only allowing Lin Yizhong, who was traveling with him, to meet them on his behalf. The gist of Lin's conversation was that the peaceful resolution of the Guangxi situation was nearing completion. On the day Chen Jitang arrived in Hong Kong, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Chen Mingshu, together with the Vice Minister of Justice, Fu Bingchang, who had recently traveled south, and the Director of the Mint, Xu Xiqing, etc., took the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train to Hong Kong at 3:00 PM on the 27th. It is reported that they will be traveling to the capital and will take the opportunity to discuss the aftermath of the Guangxi situation with Chen Jitang and others in Hong Kong. As for the current situation in Guangxi, it is gradually becoming more relaxed. Since the 59th Division of Yu Hanmou withdrew from Binyang and Guixian on the front lines, the troops have been concentrated in Xunzhou and have not yet returned to Guangdong. Yu's division is currently deployed in various parts of the Da River area to maintain the defense of the Da River. As for transportation on the Fu and Da Rivers, it has been announced open by the Eighth Route Army Headquarters since the 23rd, and there is no longer the previous obstruction to transportation. The Eighth Route Army Headquarters' announcement stated that since the beginning of the military conflict, all navigation on the Fu and Da Rivers had been prohibited due to military reasons, which was a last resort. Previously, the Wuzhou Chamber of Commerce and the Nanning General Chamber of Commerce requested the resumption of commercial ship operations to maintain the shipping industry. Now that the military conflict has ceased, ships traveling to Wuzhou on the Fu and Da Rivers should be allowed to travel as usual to facilitate transportation and alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. According to returning guests from Nanning, the defensive works outside Nanning have also been gradually removed, but due to the impact of years of war, business in Nanning is in a state of depression, and the vitality of the business community will not easily recover in a few years. The opening of transportation on the Fu and Da Rivers has relieved a major pain for Nanning merchants. The Eighth Route Army will only move east from the Da River after the Guangxi leaders Li and Bai step down. The Teaching Brigade of Zhang Renhuan has also been deployed to Wuzhou and is temporarily stationed there awaiting orders. (February 28th)</p>
<h3>Jin Army Urgently Awaiting Funds for Disbandment</h3>
<p>▲ Another Dispatch of Jing Yaoyue to Shenyang for Instructions</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the provincial committee of Jin has taken office one after another and the army has been reorganized, on the surface, it seems to have entered a smooth path. However, based on actual observations, the future is still not easy to be optimistic about. The only condition for the reorganization is the reorganization fee. It is reported that the Northeast has recently formally stated to the Jin side that the Northeast's mediation in the aftermath of the Jin situation is purely a goodwill assistance. After the Tianjin negotiations, disputes arose, and the Northeast's sincerity was not understood by the people of Jin. Therefore, the Northeast feels that there is no way to be responsible for the aftermath of the Jin situation. Therefore, the Jin army's reorganization fees and military salaries have led the generals to dispatch a representative, Jing Yaoyue, to Shenyang to meet with Zhang for instructions. Generally speaking, whether the Jin army can be smoothly reorganized still depends on whether the reorganization fees and military salaries are in place.</p>
<p>During this reorganization process, military mutinies occurred one after another in the garrison areas of Mengcheng and other places in the counties of Qi and Quwo. In Yicheng, a large number of Red Spear Society bandits were also discovered. According to investigations, the mutineers in Qi'an were a certain regiment of the Second Division of the Jin Army. The cause of the mutiny and the details of the launch are currently not reported. The troops stationed in Mengcheng were a company of a certain unit of the Second Route Army. Due to the issue of salary distribution, on the evening of the 23rd, they suddenly shot and killed the company and platoon leaders, and all fled with their weapons. Yang Chengyuan, who was stationed in Linfen, has dispatched troops to suppress them. In addition to the disaster of war, there is also the scourge of bandits. In Yicheng, more than 300 Red Spear Society bandits have recently appeared. The bandit leader sneaked in from Henan, carrying guns and ammunition. The situation is fierce and spreading rapidly. The garrison and police are currently encircling and suppressing them. This is also a major hidden worry for the future of the Jin situation.</p>
<p>The personnel of the various departments of the Jin-Sui Garrison Headquarters have had their salaries suspended since February 28th. There is a saying that the Shanxi Military Termination Committee will be established immediately, and it is planned to set up several groups internally to handle all military termination matters, and the original departments of the headquarters will be changed to groups, but the scope will be reduced. (March 1st)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Provincial Government Telegraphs the Central Government for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>▲ And Requests to Restore the Original Plan for Financial Public Bonds Taiyuan Correspondence: The first meeting of the Shanxi Provincial Government Committee resolved to telegraph the Central Government to urgently provide disaster relief to Shanxi and to request the Central Government to restore the financial public bonds in order to reorganize Shanxi's finances. The telegram is recorded as follows: (1) To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government: Shanxi is suffering from the aftermath of war, people's livelihood is declining, paper money is plummeting, and people are in panic and can hardly live from day to day. Even in such a situation, they can still persevere in suffering and have not lost hope, looking forward to a recovery. The only thing is that the Central Government decided last year to organize a financial public bond of 24 million yuan in Shanxi. In recent months, public opinion has focused on this point, and local people have been running around and appealing, pleading for life with sincerity, saying that nothing can be done without it. It is found that this public bond was originally intended to offset the previous military losses and reorganize the chaotic finances. The intention was very good. The suspension of issuance was an unavoidable measure by the Central Government, which the people of Shanxi have long known deeply. However, there is someone responsible for the past, and the masses have nowhere to complain. The Central Government should also be aware of this. In this critical moment, the situation is a hundred times more urgent than before. The overall situation is initially stable, and various policies are waiting to be implemented. After silently observing the situation and thinking repeatedly, the members of the council believe that this public bond is related to the needs of the financial people's livelihood of the whole province, which is more urgent than before. Moreover, regaining what was lost will deepen the people of Shanxi's gratitude, and keeping a promise to the end will especially highlight the Central Government's magnanimity. Therefore, we specially report the facts, and we implore you to approve the restoration of the financial public bond of 24 million yuan that was decided last year. As for the original fund, which has been allocated for military expenses, we should ask the Ministry of Finance to review and implement how to designate another fund as a fund. We eagerly await orders. Members of the Shanxi Provincial Government Committee Shang Zhen, Zhang Jixin, Chang Bingyi, Feng Sizhi, Qiu Zengyi, Zhang Weiqing, Guo Baoqing, Li Shangren, and Hu Yiling kowtow. (2) To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government: Shanxi has suffered from famine for two consecutive years in the seventeenth and eighteenth years, and the people have little savings. Last year's harvest was slightly surplus, but they suffered from frequent wars and supplies. The suffering cannot be described. It is like a husband who has been ill and weak for a long time and is waiting for nutrition, but he encounters a storm. It is impossible to avoid it, and there is no strength to resist it. How can these people bear it? Until the post-war recovery, a large army gathered, and even if they strictly abide by discipline, they eventually burdened people with food and clothing, and the supply of grain and fodder was exhausted. With thin clothes and cold weather, there were deaths on the road. The severity of the disaster has never been heard of before. Every time the members of the council think about it, they don't know where the tears come from. The provinces of Shaanxi and Henan have repeatedly received disaster relief. Shanxi has no obvious natural disasters and is not a direct battlefield. Asking for assistance may be doubted. However, the disasters in Qin and Yu are like locusts, which are obvious to all. The disaster in Shanxi is like the armyworm, which is not easy to know. In fact, it has affected the people, and the matter is the same. If you remain silent, I am afraid that you will not be able to understand the intention of diligently caring for the people, and you will not be able to convey the feelings of the poor and helpless. We have always admired your attention to people's livelihood and concern for the people's suffering. Therefore, we have specially reported the facts, and we implore you to provide disaster relief so that there is hope for recovery and the people of Shanxi can regret their mistakes early. With widespread virtue and grace, we will always worship the gifts of the Central Government and colleagues. In this urgent telegram, we await orders. Members of the Shanxi Provincial Government Committee Shang Zhen, Zhang Jixin, Chang Bingyi, Feng Sizhi, Qiu Zengyi, Zhang Weiqing, Guo Baoqing, Li Shangren, and Hu Yiling kowtow.</p>

<h3>Important Communists Arrested in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Han Qingchang, the director of the Dingping Street Sub-Bureau of the Sixth Branch of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, led several police officers and soldiers on an inspection at the Liaoning General Station on Beining Road yesterday morning. They saw a young man, about twenty years old, dressed in plain clothes, circling back and forth in the south of the station, looking around suspiciously. They went up to question him. The young man answered fluently, but his language was unclear. Mr. Han, for the sake of prudence, brought the young man to the station for further investigation. The young man was very sharp-tongued, saying, "I am neither a bandit nor do I have any contraband. Why are you arresting me?" Mr. Han tested him with words, saying, "Someone from Harbin followed you here and reported that you are a communist." The young man's face changed suddenly, and after a long time, he said, "That's right, I am now returning to China from Soviet Russia, my name is Zhu Huairui." At that time, Mr. Han had already untied the young man's blue cloth cotton robe and checked it carefully. He found two pieces of white paper in the collar of his small jacket, and another piece of paper at the button of his small jacket, with a number of blue markings on it. When the young man saw that things were exposed, he admitted that he was a communist and was immediately handed over to the branch bureau. After being interrogated by the branch bureau chief, he confessed that he was 25 years old, his Russian name was Rubilin, he was from Tianjin, and he had studied at Tianjin Public Elementary School when he was young. At the age of sixteen, he entered the Tangshan Carriage Factory as a grinder. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, he and Luo Shou, Li Zhusheng, Cheng Jiaqing and other fourteen people were sent to Shanghai by Sun Guanbu, the leader of the Tangshan Youth League, and then took a boat from Shanghai to Vladivostok, and transferred to Russia. He studied at the Eastern University in Moscow, graduated in two and a half years, and then entered the military sergeant class and graduated in one and a half years. Recently, he was sent back to China to engage in activities in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when he arrived at Beiwu Station in Jilin, he was separated from his three companions. Because he lacked travel expenses, he could not go to Shanghai, which led to his arrest. The branch bureau transferred the young man to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau for investigation because the matter involved a common criminal. (March 2nd)</p>
<h3>Songhua River Shipping Expansion and Association</h3>
<p>▲ Expanded Joint Shipping Association Established</p>

<p>Harbin Correspondence: More than 100 key figures in the government and merchant shipping industry of the Songhua River held a general meeting of the Harbin Shipping Expansion and Association on February 26th at the Shipping Association. Shen Honglie, in his capacity as the chairman of the Northeast Associated Shipping Bureau, represented the Northeast Political Affairs Committee and attended the meeting. In addition to holding the inaugural meeting on that day, it was also decided to form the Harbin Government and Merchant Shipping Association Bureau. The Northeast Shipping Bureau represents the official side, and the Shipping Association represents the commercial side. They jointly unite, with a total of 121 steamships, 143 cargo ships, and 374 sailboats, with an estimated total value of 5 million yuan, which is the share capital of the official and commercial association bureau, equivalent to a joint investment of 5 million yuan.

<h3>Exacerbated Rice Passport Tax Uproar in Anhui</h3>
<p>▲Huaiyuan Shipping Merchants' Petition Leads to Bloodshed</p>
<p>▲Bengbu Merchants and Residents Petition in a Parade Demonstration</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Government's collection of passport fees for rice transported by both steamer and sailing vessel, as well as surcharges on salt, has been repeatedly ordered to be revoked by the Executive Yuan, but the orders have not been followed. Recently, in Huaibei's Huaiyuan County, shipping merchants, due to the detention of their ships by the county's Rice Passport Inspection Division, petitioned for their release. This led to a conflict with the guards at the division, resulting in a tragic incident of gunfire wounding people and causing bloodshed. The merchants, industrialists, and shipping merchants of Bengbu were also enraged and organized a parade to petition the authorities for assistance. The details of this incident are described as follows:</p>
<p>▲Initial Petition: Huaiyuan is a crucial hub where the turbid Huai River converges, and almost all rice-carrying vessels pass through it. It has been more than two months since the Sailing Vessel Rice Passport Inspection Division was established there. Grain ships passing through that do not declare and pay taxes are detained until the full amount is paid before they are released. Inspection posts and checkpoints are set up everywhere in Bengbu, Wuhe, and Gubei, all located downstream of the Huai River, causing obstructions at every turn. Some time ago, Huaiyuan shipping merchants, due to the division’s detention of a large number of ships and exaction of passport fees, obstructing traffic on the long Huai River and cutting off the livelihood of shipping merchants, gathered hundreds of boat owners one day and went to the Huaibei Garrison Headquarters in Bengbu to petition Commander Wei Lihuang to relieve their suffering. Wei sent Liu, the Chief of the Adjutant's Office, to meet with the representatives and promised to find a solution. After the shipping merchants returned to Huaiyuan, Wei sent personnel to Huaiyuan to investigate the actual situation in order to make a decision.</p>
<p>▲Circumstances of the Incident: On the afternoon of the second day, at four o'clock, more than a thousand Huaiyuan shipping merchants again gathered at the riverbank in Huaiyuan to petition the Rice Passport Inspection Division to release the detained ships. The division had pre-arranged six soldiers from the Maritime Public Security Bureau to guard the entrance. After the petitioning group arrived, they publicly nominated representatives to request a meeting with Zhan Xinpei, the director of the division. Zhan refused to meet them. The representatives insisted, and the guards intervened, leading to a dispute. The guards then stabbed the shipping merchants with bayonets and rifle butts. Personnel inside the division also used iron bars and wooden sticks to beat them randomly. Boat owner Wang Changfa suffered a shoulder injury, and Ge Lanjin suffered a head injury, both bleeding profusely. The crowd was outraged at the scene and risked capturing the guns, seizing five guards, a platoon leader, and the division's clerk Zhang Lianyu, along with the captured officers and soldiers, six quick-firing guns, and dozens of bullets. They were all taken to Bengbu and handed over to the joint military and police inspection office for detention and interrogation. The injured Wang and Ge have been sent to Wenfang Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>▲Telegram to the Central Government: The Bengbu General Chamber of Commerce and 38 trade associations telegraphed the National Government and the Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan last night, saying: "To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Chiang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance: We have found that the Anhui Rice Passport Tax is being levied against orders, and thousands of ships are being detained along the Huai River, causing severe oppression. Today, more than a thousand Huaiyuan shipping merchants went empty-handed to the Rice Passport Inspection Division to petition. Unexpectedly, Zhan Xinpei, the director of the division, dared to order the guards to fire more than a hundred shots, causing serious injuries to the shipping merchants Wang Changfa and Ge Lanjin, who are in critical condition. The entire city is in shock, and disaster is imminent. We hereby urgently telegram you, imploring you to quickly order the nearby stationed troops to forcibly revoke the tax, and to strictly arrest and bring to justice Zhan Xinpei, the principal offender who ordered the shooting and wounding of people, in accordance with the law, in order to maintain public order and quell public anger. We are awaiting your urgent orders." ▲Parade and Demonstration: Today (the 3rd), at 12:00 noon, the Bengbu General Chamber of Commerce convened representatives from various industries, as well as dockworkers and shipping merchants, at the Salt and Grain Guild Hall to discuss ways to oppose the Rice Passport Tax. More than a thousand people attended. Liu Huaxuan reported on the illegal and harmful actions of the Huaiyuan Rice Passport Inspection Division and the circumstances of the incident. It was resolved that industrialists, merchants, and shipping merchants would organize a petitioning group to parade and demonstrate. They then formed a procession from the Salt and Grain Guild Hall, shouting slogans along the way such as "Revoke the Rice Passport Tax!", "Revoke the Salt Surcharge!", and "Oppose disguised Likin (internal transit tax)!" It was raining at the time, and the roads were muddy, but the crowd marched in the rain, and the order was still good. When they arrived at the Rice Passport Inspection Post on Huachang Street, they intended to remove its wooden sign, but were prevented by the guards at the post. When they arrived at the Salt Surcharge Collection Bureau on Zhongxin Street, the bureau's gate was closed, and no one was there. Presumably, they had fled early. They then removed its wooden sign and went directly to the Huaibei Garrison Headquarters on Guoqing Street to petition.</p>
<p>▲Second Petition: When the crowd arrived at the entrance of the Garrison Headquarters, they shouted, "Please Commander Wei uphold justice!" They then nominated Liu Huaxuan, Peng Zhuoru, Xiao Dafu, and ten others as representatives to request a meeting with Commander Wei. Wei was busy with other matters and sent Chief of Staff Zhan Guojun to meet with them instead. Liu and others recounted the illegal and harmful actions of the Rice Passport Inspection Division and the meaning of the petition. Zhan said that he would report the representatives' intentions to Commander Wei and find a way to help, but the specific method still needed to be considered. The representatives were satisfied and then took their leave. The petitioning group then dispersed. According to current observations, the merchants and residents of Bengbu are determined to continue until the goal of revoking the Rice Passport Tax is achieved. If it cannot be resolved in the near future, it is feared that it will lead to a strike. (March 3rd)</p>
<h3>Banditry on the Jiangbei Canal Not Yet Suppressed</h3>
<p>▲Shao Bo's Pacification Brigade in Fierce Battle with Bandits</p>
<p>Banditry is rampant in Jiangbei, Jiangsu Province, and canal steamers have been robbed repeatedly. This has been the case for some time. Since the establishment of the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Yangzhou and the establishment of the General Headquarters in Qingjiang, with secret deployment of cadres along the way to specialize in suppression, major criminals have been captured in various cases, and banditry has subsided somewhat. However, for safety's sake, the steamers still stop at night and travel during the day. On the 3rd of this month, a company of infantry from the 94th Pacification Brigade hired the Zhejiang steamer, which was towing the Dada tugboat, and set off from Yangzhou to Qingjiang at 12:00 at night. At about 2:00 AM, they arrived at the Twenty-Five Mile Temple area above Shaobo. Suddenly, a band of bandits on the shore shouted for them to stop the boat. The captain knew something was wrong and replied that the boat was a government vessel. The bandits immediately fired a volley of shots, followed by firecrackers, which sounded like a string of pearls. Soon, more than a dozen fishing boats surrounded the steamer. The soldiers carried on the tugboat immediately jumped onto the opposite bank and engaged the bandits in a fierce battle across the river. After two hours, the sky gradually brightened, and the bandits retreated while fighting, fleeing in disarray. In this battle, four soldiers were wounded, and one bandit was captured alive, along with two monks from the Twenty-Five Mile Temple and dozens of bandits from the fishing boats. All were taken to Yangzhou. The captured bandit was originally intended to be executed on the spot, but because a confession was still needed in order to search for the remaining bandits, he was taken to Yangzhou for interrogation along with the others. At that time, the Zhaoshangju's civilian ship Junfa, downstream, with the Maoli tugboat, the Fuyun Company's Zhenbao ship, downstream, with the Fuan tugboat, and the Xiehe Wheel Bureau's Zhenqing ship, downstream, with the Henghua ship and the Yuanqing tugboat, all arrived here from Gaoyou. Also, the Fuyun Company's Zhenbao ship, upstream, the Jian ship and the Zhenan tugboat, and the Shenji Zhenqing ship, upstream, the Fengjin ship and the Tongrun tugboat, arrived here from Shaobo. Fortunately, the bandits had been repelled, allowing them to pass safely.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Tongshan to Establish a Higher Court's Third Branch - The Higher Court, upon the order of the Ministry of Justice, is to establish a Higher Court's Third Branch in Tongshan County. After receiving the order, President Lin immediately instructed the county's trial officer, Li Weiyuan, to find a suitable site for the branch court in the county. Trial Officer Li found the old Inspection Office on Datong Street in the county, which was suitable for use as the branch court's site. However, the site is currently occupied by the headquarters of the 19th Brigade of the 7th Army Division. It should be disposed of by the Higher Court. It was reported to the Higher Court the other day. After receiving the report, President Lin, believing that the old Inspection Office was suitable for establishing the court, ordered County Magistrate Yang Wei yesterday to find another suitable location for the troops stationed there, in order to actively proceed with the design and construction and establish the branch court as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Silk Factories Hold Important Meeting on Public Debt Issue - The silk factory operators of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, recently saw in the newspapers that the Legislative Yuan passed the Relief of the Silk Industry Public Debt Regulations, which were inconsistent with the original request, causing widespread panic. They met as scheduled to discuss relief measures and decided to hold a general meeting on the 5th. After receiving the notification from the Relief Special Committee, the Wuxi Silk Factory Trade Association specially convened an emergency meeting yesterday. More than 30 representatives from 32 factories attended, with Qian Fenghao presiding. It was resolved that the public debt regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan were vastly different from the intent of the silk industry's request. If implemented, the relief obtained by silk merchants would be minimal, while the burden of repaying the public debt fund would be enormous. The association should take the same position as the Zhejiang and Shanghai operators and strive together. Yang Yuchu, Miao Shaoqing, and Zhu Zhuxian were designated as representatives to attend the meeting in Shanghai, along with the representatives elected by Shanghai and Zhejiang, to petition in Beijing together.</p>

In less than a year, it was all spent. Mao later forced Hua to sell the child and ordered Hua to engage in prostitution. Hua firmly refused, so they returned to their hometown together. Zhao Wanshun already hated both of them deeply and refused to take them in. Hua had no choice but to live with Mao again. Then Mao became insane and colluded with local people, intending to sell Hua. Hua knew something was wrong and came to the city yesterday to sue the court.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Bandits Discovered on Zhapu Waters - At the end of last month, three bandit ships belonging to Liu Dexing's bandit gang in Dongxiang were discovered on the Zhapu waters. The bandits, numbering about 160 or 170, landed at Caiqi Port. However, because they left in a hurry, four bandits were left behind and took refuge in the Waipushan Temple. The monks of the temple, knowing that they were bandits, intended to report to Zhapu, but were threatened by the bandits and stopped. It was not until yesterday (the 3rd) that they crossed the sea, landed, and fled. When they left, the bandits gave the monks a package of banknotes as a reward.</p>
<p>Zhapu Arrests Bandit Leader - Xu Quan, son of Xu Huailin of Zhapu, has recently joined the Dongxiang bandit gang and has become a bandit leader. On the afternoon of the 3rd, he was privately smoking at Lu Xiaomei's opium den at Chalubridge when he was discovered by the water police, who led the police and arrested Xu on the spot. They also arrested one other person who was smoking with him and escorted them back. The next day, they were sent to the Pinghu County Government for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Loot Two Villages and Kidnap Four People - Near Yingfu Wu Zhengxiang's house, located about five li from Shuanglin Town in Huzhou County, three boats from Jiangbei suddenly arrived at about 8:00 PM on the 1st of this month. More than 20 bandits, each carrying guns and speaking in a Henan accent, surged ashore and broke into Wu's house, ransacking it and taking away all valuables. Before leaving, they kidnapped Wu's son, Cai Sheng. At that time, Wu's neighbor, Cao Qiaosheng, happened to be looking out the door and was shot twice by the bandits with wooden-cased guns. The bullets entered his chest and exited his back, killing him instantly. It was also heard that when the bandits set out, they split into two groups. One group robbed the village, and the other group went to Yu Helin's house in the nearby Danglang Jiayuan and kidnapped Yu's daughter-in-law, Xing Shi, eldest grandson, A Kui, and youngest grandson, A Kun, and robbed them of clothing and other items, amounting to a considerable sum. Afterwards, the Shuanglin Town Public Security Bureau, together with the water police and the guard corps, pursued the bandits in two directions, but there was no trace of them.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>County Election Preparatory Meeting - Gong Shinong, the magistrate of Jiaxing County, was appointed by order to concurrently serve as the county election supervisor for the National Representatives Conference. He has already been sworn into office and convened a preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 4th with representatives from various legal entities. The resolutions included: (1) Ordering the lists of electors of each organization to be sent to the county before the 10th so that a consolidated register can be created and submitted to the province for review.

<p>Exemption from Filling the Diaodiao Bridge River Denied for Jiaxing Phase II City Road Project - There was a proposal to fill the Diaodiao Bridge River in the northern part of the city as part of the Jiaxing Phase II City Road Project. The Wangwuli Neighborhood Committee there believes that this move will obstruct the flow of water and impede traffic. It has repeatedly petitioned the district office to forward the request to the county government to exempt them from filling it. It is now learned that the county government instructed the district yesterday, stating that although the filling of the Diaodiao Bridge River in the northern part of the city will inevitably slightly obstruct the flow of the canal, the opening of the Qingzhi River is being planned. After its implementation in the future, the canal will have an additional diversionary tributary, so there is no need to worry too much.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Prohibition of Yongan Steamer - The Zhejiang Construction Department, because the Yongan Wheel Bureau purchased a steamer to operate the Hangzhou-Zhuji route, and the circumstances surrounding it were complicated, and a major dispute arose with Fu Fucheng and others, residents of the northern district of Zhuji, sent personnel to investigate and report. After submitting it to the provincial government, it was resolved to send personnel to investigate, report, and review the case. Yesterday, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau was ordered to order the bureau to temporarily cease operations until a ship license is issued, to avoid causing trouble.</p>
<p>City Prepares to Establish Civilian Loan Office - The Hangzhou Municipal Government, upon the order of the province, in order to solve the problem of people's livelihood and relieve the poor, plans to establish loan offices for the poor in various places. Loans will be provided to the poor who are engaged in legitimate livelihoods at the lowest interest rates and with the most convenient procedures, in order to prevent the abuses of usury. The loan procedures will be simplified as much as possible. Any poor person can obtain the loan amount by providing proof from two neighbors and repay it in monthly installments. No other guarantees are required, so that the poor can truly benefit from it.</p>
<p>Police Station Seizes Large Quantity of Red Pills - Wang Ying, a patrol officer from the 2nd Precinct of the 4th District of the Jianggan Huaxian Bridge Police Station, encountered a worker-like figure carrying a leather suitcase in front of the Yuanshuai Temple yesterday. Suspecting his suspicious behavior, he stepped forward to question him. His answers were vague. Upon searching his person, he found two large packages of red pills. Inside the suitcase, he found fifty boxes of red pills, each box containing 1,000 pills, totaling more than 50,000 pills. Believing that the matter was serious, he took the person and items to the 2nd Precinct of the 4th District. After questioning by officer Lu Shixian, he confessed that he was Hu Along, a worker at an iron factory, and said that a friend had entrusted him to transport them from Hangzhou to Zhuji. He has now been sent to the Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>

<h3>Outline of Construction Projects in Shaanxi Province, Year 20 of the Republic of China (Continued 4)</h3>
<p>▲ Drafted by the Shaanxi Provincial Government</p>
<p>(B) Shenmu Government Inspection Bureau: This bureau is a joint government-business venture. Its annual profit is only around 20,000 yuan. It is planned to send experts to reorganize it and focus on expanding sales of refined products. For the above two mines, Yanchang Petroleum, it is necessary to rely on central government strength to expand significantly. The provincial government can only plan to continue opening new wells to increase production. If Shenmu Government Inspection Bureau is improved and refined, it can expand its sales. These two mines are businesses currently being developed in Shaanxi Province. As for mines that are closed or not yet opened, the following six locations are planned for restoration or investigation this year:</p>
<p>(C) Dingbian Salt Field: The salt field in Dingbian County is connected to the salt area of Yanchi County in Gansu. It covers an area of 56 square li, with white and pure quality and extremely rich reserves. After heavy rains, the ground is covered with salt deposits more than five inches thick. Establishing a factory to produce refined salt would be extremely profitable. This year, it is planned to conduct preliminary investigations and detailed planning in preparation for development.</p>
<p>(D) Yongshou Coal Mine: Yongshou is a necessary stop on the Longhai Railway, and it is actually the only coal storage location for the railway in Shaanxi. A factory was established and mining was undertaken in previous years, but work was suspended due to civil unrest and banditry. This year, it is planned to reopen the mine, requiring an estimated capital of 5,000 yuan. (E) Tongguan Coal Mine: Currently, only merchants are mining this mine, using only indigenous methods with very limited output. This year, it is planned to be managed by the government. In the future, with a light railway connecting to the Jiaokou motor road and the provincial capital, business will surely flourish. It is planned to use new machinery for mining, requiring an estimated capital of 150,000 yuan. Using indigenous methods would require an estimated capital of 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(F) Hancheng Coal Mine: It is planned to conduct a preliminary investigation of this mine before designing it. Once the Longhai Railway is built to Tongguan, this mine will flourish, as the coal produced can be transported to Tongguan via the Yellow River.</p>
<p>(G) Bin County Coal Mine: Once this mine and the Yongshou mine are opened, they can supply sales in the Qifeng area. It is planned to conduct a preliminary investigation before designing.</p>
<p>(H) Zhen'an Iron Mine: A factory was also established to mine this mine in previous years, but it has now been closed. However, merchants still engage in private mining. All smelting uses indigenous methods, with fuel solely consisting of charcoal. This year, it is planned to conduct a detailed investigation and design for mining.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province's mountains are longitudinal and transverse, with extremely rich reserves. The above mines are mostly located in the old Guanzhong Road area. In the north and south roads, the mountains overlap, and transportation is inconvenient, requiring time even for investigation. Coal in counties such as Yulin, Shenmu, Fugou, and Hengshan; iron in counties such as Luonan, Lueyang, Fengxian, and Zhenba; placer gold in counties such as Nanzheng and Ningqiang; and asbestos in counties such as Pingli and Zhenping are all highly exploitable and can be utilized. This year, it is planned to send commissioners to conduct on-site surveys and detailed designs, either to be operated independently by merchants raising shares, or to be managed by the government establishing factories, to ensure that the earth's reserves are fully exploited and the people's livelihood is enriched.</p>
<p>6. Regarding Agriculture, Forestry, and Reclamation: The following matters are planned for this year:</p>
<p>(A) Qinling Afforestation Nursery: It is planned to plant security forests in three locations: Huashan, Zhongnan Mountain, and Taishan Mountain. This year's plan is to first establish two nurseries. The Zhongnan Taishan Mountain afforestation nursery will be located near the provincial capital. The Huashan afforestation nursery will be established on 100 mu of land on the northern foothills of Huashan. The estimated cost of establishment and purchase is approximately 25,000 yuan. In the future, when the saplings have grown, they will be widely planted, and all mountain operators will be forced to implement this.</p>
<p>(B) Cotton Planting Experiment Field: In each of Weibei and Weinan, a 100-mu area will be selected to establish a cotton planting experiment field to improve Shaanxi's cotton production. The planned establishment and purchase cost is approximately 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(C) Sericulture Experiment Field: 100 mu of land will be purchased in Huaxian County to establish a large-scale sericulture experiment field to test and improve the sericulture industry. The planned establishment and purchase cost is approximately 30,000 yuan. After the establishment of the above fields and nurseries, if results are obtained, the government will actively disseminate them to the public to promote expansion.</p>
<p>(D) Weibin Security Forest: There are many滩地 on both sides of the Wei River. Planting is often affected by floods and droughts, while not planting is a regrettable waste. It is planned to afforest all灘地, supervised by the government and managed by the counties. This year, it is planned to start with surveying灘地 to facilitate implementation. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Important News: Chinese Painting Exhibition to be Held in Tokyo and Osaka</h3>
<p>(Osaka Dispatch) The Japanese, out of admiration for the culture and art of our country, are making every effort to collect famous paintings from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Recently, through the mediation of the Sino-Japanese Association and the Toyo Association, and with the support of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government and Hu Hanmin, Dai Tianchou, Wang Zhengting, Wang Boqun, and Ma Fuxiang, it was decided to hold a Chinese painting exhibition in Tokyo and Osaka. The exhibition will combine relics from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties with modern masterpieces from China and Japan. It will be held in Tokyo from April 26 to May 20, and then moved to Osaka. The exhibits are extremely valuable. It is estimated that collectors from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, such as Zhang Zaiyang, Gu Heyi, Zhang Zhongren, and Pan Shan, will bring their own exhibits to Japan. From the Tianjin and Beijing area, there will be exhibits from the deposed Emperor Xuantong, Xu Shichang, Gao Lingjue, Zhang Zhiyi, Jin Yunpeng, Pan Fu, Wang Yitang, Cao Rulin, Li Shizeng, Hu Weide, Xiong Xiling, Jiang Chaozong, etc. The exhibits are extremely rare and have never been published in the country before.

<h3>Three Major Plans of the Shanxi Education Department</h3>
<p>▲ Organize Out-of-Province Visitation Group</p>
<p>▲ Widely Establish Infant Kindergartens</p>
<p>▲ Improve Drama and Film</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Since taking office, Feng Sizhi, Director of the Shanxi Education Department, has been actively planning to rectify the education system. Regarding the various errors in the past education system, he has decided to formulate a new education policy based on the regulations formulated by the central government and with reference to the actual local situation, in order to promote education in Shanxi. He has decided to establish an Education Design Committee soon, inviting staff from various schools and famous figures from the education sector inside and outside the province to discuss ways to improve everything. Currently, there are approximately three items that are being planned:</p>
<p>(1) Organize an Out-of-Province Visitation Group: Shanxi education has not only stagnated in recent years but has also lagged behind. Although this is due to the influence of geography and the current situation, those responsible for education cannot shirk their responsibilities. It has been decided this spring to order teachers from all secondary schools and above in the province to organize an Out-of-Province Education Visitation Group, depart in groups, and take turns visiting places such as Beijing and Tianjin.</p>
<p>(2) Establish Kindergartens: Infants in this city have no education before entering elementary school. If more kindergartens are established, all infants in each household can be sent to the kindergarten, which can provide considerable education to the infants, relieve the burden on adults, and benefit everyone in society.</p>
<p>(3) Improve Drama and Film: Film and drama are natural and good materials for social education. In the future, it is decided to widely establish popular libraries and public schools, and establish a drama and film improvement committee to promote social education. (March 1)</p>
<h3>Tuition Fees for Female Students Studying Abroad After Marriage</h3>
<p>▲ Still Collected from the Original Province</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency): An order from the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Education stated that there are no clear provisions in the central government laws regarding the provincial affiliation of female students studying in Japan after marrying men from other provinces. Unless there are special regulations in each province, they will still collect from the province that originally paid the official fees or subsidies.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaoruo Expresses Opinion on Nanyang Hospital Students' Request to Transfer to Nantong Medical School</h3>
<p>After the Ministry ordered the private Nanyang Academy of Medicine in Shanghai to cease operations, male and female students wanted to transfer to the Nantong University Medical School. Yesterday, the school's president, Zhang Xiaoruo, told a visiting reporter that since January, dozens of Nanyang Medical College students have asked people to find ways to transfer, and more continue to do so daily. However, Nanyang Academy of Medicine has not been approved by the Ministry of Education, and now that a disturbance has occurred, it has been ordered to cease operations. Regarding the request to transfer to Nantong, I (Zhang) have decided on the following methods: (1) Comply with the Ministry's order and refuse to accept students from unapproved schools, rejecting them all; (2) Each person must pass the entrance examination, and they will be accepted or rejected based on their performance; (3) Anyone who obtains a transfer certificate from Nanyang will be allowed to transfer. Regarding the above three methods, I have asked the Ministry of Education and Chairmen Chu and He of the School Board for their opinions and decisions. Personally, I hope to achieve the second method. As for Nantong's academic atmosphere, it has been extremely pure for 30 years and also has industrial relations. At a time when the Ministry of Education is doing its utmost to rectify discipline and cultivate industry, it is even less willing for any bad elements to participate. Zhang also said that the director of Nantong Medical School has recently been taken over by Dr. Qu Liheng, a doctor of medicine from the University of Berlin in Germany and director of the Northeast Army Hospital. Qu was previously a graduate of Nantong Medical School.</p>
<h3>All Primary Schools in Hefei Suspended and Reorganized</h3>
<p>▲ Ordered by the Education Department</p>
<p>Based on accusations from Hefei residents that education in the county is exceptionally corrupt, the Anhui Education Department has decided on three methods to order the county to comply with: 1. In terms of funding, the amount is too small, and the Education Funding Clearing Committee will properly find a method. 2. In terms of schools, all of them will be closed and fundamentally reorganized. Two complete primary schools will be established in the urban area, one complete primary school for girls, and four complete primary schools in the rural areas. Several elementary schools will be established in urban and rural areas. The senior grade should be at a rate of 500 yuan per grade, and the elementary grade should be at a rate of 300 yuan per grade. Each grade should have 30 to 50 people, and each grade should contain at most two grades. Social education must also be uniformly managed by the Education Bureau. 3. Punish the school bullies. School bullies Gao Xuan, Cheng Jinbo, etc. will be strictly investigated according to law, and the embezzled education funds will be recovered.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Selects Photos of Chinese Children's Lives for the International League of Nations Welsh Conference</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously approved a letter from the Chinese Embassy in the UK requesting photos of the lives of children in schools in our country for publication in a special children's issue. After the Ministry of Education approved the letter, it yesterday selected one photo each of students from the Ciyouyuan School in Beiping, the Central Kindergarten, and the Central District Experimental School Kindergarten, and sent them to the Chinese Embassy in the UK for forwarding to the Welsh Branch of the International League of Nations. The original letter stated: "The case was approved by the Welsh Branch of the International League of Nations in a letter thanking our country's children for their answers to the Welsh Children's Global Pennant Sound. In addition to sending six copies of the Welsh Children's Telegraph and two copies of this year's broadcasting publications, we also noted the inspection of photos of children from our country's schools for printing in a special issue. We should check and reply accordingly," and attached the telegraph and broadcasting publications to the department. Accordingly, we have enclosed one photo of the life of students at the Beiping Xiangshan Ciyouyuan School, one photo of the life of kindergarten children at the Central University Experimental School, and one photo of the life of students at the Nanjing Municipal Central District Experimental School Kindergarten, and sent them to your embassy for forwarding to the Welsh Branch of the International League of Nations for selection for publication.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Approves the Appointment of Three Principals in Wu County</h3>
<p>Huang, the magistrate of Wu County, previously forwarded the Education Bureau's recommendation of Zhuang Wenlan as the principal of Muli Elementary School, Hua Dezheng as the principal of Shenjing Elementary School, and Qian Baiyin as the acting principal of Xiangcheng Elementary School to the Education Department. Yesterday, a directive was received stating: "Zhuang Wenlan and Hua Dezheng are qualified according to Article 3 of the Jiangsu Provincial Regulations on the Appointment and Dismissal and Temporary Treatment of County Elementary School Principals and are approved to be appointed separately." As for Qian Baiyin, his qualifications do not meet the requirements, but considering his long service as an elementary school teacher, he is approved to act temporarily.</p>
<h3>Wu County Municipal School Property Transferred to the Education Bureau</h3>
<p>When the municipality and county of Wu County merged, all municipal school property rental registers, and small savings were received by the Finance Bureau. However, the Education Bureau argued that the property was an education fund and had previously requested the county government to allocate it to its jurisdiction. Magistrate Huang, after investigating that the 19th year's land rent had already been collected by the Finance Bureau, deemed it inappropriate to change course midway, and ordered both parties to jointly dispatch personnel to handle the matter publicly. First, the land and house receipts were allocated to the Education Bureau for safekeeping. Now, the Director of the Education Bureau argued that the small collection had been completed and that the aforementioned books and records should be immediately transferred to this bureau for receipt. The Finance Bureau was informed by letter for review. Director Yuan approved the letter and immediately ordered the School Property Collection Office to hand over all books and records related to land and house rents, and savings of 6,869 yuan, three corners, two cents, and five mills, to the Committee Member Feng sent by the Education Bureau for item-by-item counting, and to report the transfer process to the county and forward it to the department for record.</p>

<h3>Japanese Track and Field Athletes' Ages</h3>
<p>▲ Younger than European and American Athletes</p>
<p>(Japan Correspondence) The Japan Association of Athletics Federations recently conducted a survey of the ages of track and field athletes throughout Japan and has the following interesting report:</p>
<p>A total of 3,373 male athletes and 528 female athletes are registered with the league in all competitions. Among the men, Chikahiko Chiba of Hokkaido is 44 years old at the time of competition, holding the record for the oldest athlete. The world-famous eccentric Kinu Hitomi is the top among the women, at 25 years old. Fifteen years old is the youngest age for an athlete, with three men and seven women. Among the male athletes, 21 years old is the most common, with a total of 454 people. Among the female athletes, 18 years old is the most popular, with a total of 135 people, followed by 17 years old, with 134 people. The ages of the top athletes who hold Japanese records are all between 21 and 27 years old. Among them, Mr. Nambu, the long jumper, is the oldest, a special case at 28 years old. Mr. Oda, the jumper, and Mr. Miki, the hurdler, are next, at 27 years old. Mr. Kimura, the high jumper, and Mr. Yoshioka, the sprinter, are 23 years old. Mr. Nishida, the pole vaulter, is only 24 years old. Mr. Nakajima, the sprinter, is the youngest, just 21 years old.</p>
<p>In summary, the most active period for Japanese male athletes is eight years, from 21 to 27 years old. For women, it is shorter, only five years, from 16 or 17 to 20 years old. Compared with European and American countries, the age at which Japanese athletes begin and end their active careers is earlier. This is also a characteristic of the early development and aging of the Japanese people. Relief for extending the prime of Japanese people is a major responsibility that medical and sports professionals should bear.</p>

<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Seafarer</p>
<p>In British families, because porcelain is fragile and easily broken, wooden bowls, plates, and cups are increasingly being used for daily use. This is gradually becoming fashionable. The wood is mostly walnut and mahogany, which are more expensive than porcelain and glass, but more durable.</p>
<p>▲ A large music store in New York sold 290 grand pianos in one day, all purchased on the spot by visitors. This shows how many rich people there are in America.</p>
<p>▲ British women are in fashion with wooden earrings, hand-carved and painted, suspended by thin metal chains. These have become fashionable accessories. A large department store in New York has a theater where customers can watch plays all day while shopping or browsing.</p>
<p>▲ A large tree has been newly discovered on New Zealand Island in the Pacific Ocean. The trunk is 22 feet in diameter and 66 feet in circumference, estimated to be 2,000 years old.</p>
<p>▲ A scientific experiment was held in London in which a chrysanthemum was immersed in liquid air and crushed into small pieces. When placed in normal air, it recombined and was the same as the original flower.</p>
<p>▲ There is a beetle in the New York Police Department that can absorb two grains of morphine daily. If humans were to ingest it, those two grains would be enough to kill two people.</p>
<p>▲ A 1,600-year-old wine cellar has been newly discovered underground in the Tivoli House in Buckinghamshire, England. The house was formerly the residence of the Duke of Tivoli.</p>
<h3>Remembering Zhu Qinglan's Background</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qinglan is known throughout the country as a diplomat, politician, and military strategist. Recently, he has been dedicated to helping disaster victims, not hesitating to travel and face dangers, constantly traveling north and south. People only know that Mr. Zhu is from Zhejiang, but not which county or place. Now, for the readers of Free Talk, I will describe it.</p>
<p>South of my Shaoxing county city, there is Tower Hill. At the foot of South Mountain is Chai Chang Alley. Inside the alley, there are hundreds of large houses, which are the former residence of the Prime Minister Zhu from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. The ancestor's shrine still has the Prime Minister's statue. When the Manchus entered the customs, the Prime Minister spared no effort to sacrifice himself to preserve the lives of the people of Shanyin and Kuaiji counties. His功績 was significant to the country. By imperial decree, the local authorities were allowed to sculpt his true form in the shrine, like the bronze statues of recent times, to pass down to posterity. Zhu Qinglan is a descendant of the Prime Minister. Since the founding of the Republic of China, he has been unwilling to become an official, only knowing to save the people. Sometimes he goes to Zhejiang to raise funds for disaster relief, even passing his home several times without entering, truly a second Xia Yu. He has a niece, the daughter of Yuebo (Yuebo is Mr. Zhu's second elder brother). Yuebo and his wife have passed away for more than ten years, without a son, only this one daughter. She was married to the Xie family. Someone asked her, "Elder Aunt, you have an eighty-year-old aunt above you and four orphans below you, struggling through the famine years. Why don't you go to your third uncle, the living Bodhisattva who universally saves disaster victims?" (The Yue daughter calls Mr. Qinglan her third uncle.) The Yue daughter said, "I hope my third uncle can save more people. Even if I starve to death, I am willing." The Yue daughter's virtue and the gentleman's kindness are both worthy of being descendants of Prime Minister Zhu. Recently, the Yue daughter is avoiding the famine in Shanghai, struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Gambler's Deception Techniques</h3>
<p>— Awakened</p>
<p>Every year at the beginning of the year, it is the custom in my hometown to engage in "herding pig slave games" in addition to soliciting food and drink, as a way to pass the time. Thus, tea houses in various places can profit from this, and there are often gambling gatherings. At this time, gamblers use their various deception techniques to seize other people's money. People who are addicted to gambling fall into their traps without realizing it, and many even go bankrupt. At the end of the year before last, a tea guest came to a tea house in Gongjia Road in my hometown. The guest was followed by a rickshaw puller, who came from Shanghai. At that time, there were no long-distance buses. People traveling from Shanghai to the northern part of Chuansha mostly took a boat to Donggou, and then hired a rickshaw to transfer to various places. The rickshaw fare was five or six silver corners, up to seven or eight silver corners. After the guest sat down, he took out a silver coin and asked the rickshaw puller to exchange it at the shop for silver corners to pay the rickshaw fare. The shop said that the coin was counterfeit and refused to exchange it. The guest looked embarrassed, saying that he only had this one coin in his pocket. Suddenly, he took out a set of bamboo tiles and asked the tea house owner to pawn them for some silver corners to pay the rickshaw fare. The tea house owner saw that the guest was well-dressed and didn't look like a lower-class person, and that the bamboo tiles were brand new, worth several yuan, so he pawned them. The guest said that he would come to redeem them in a day or two, but the guest left and never returned. When people gathered to gamble on Pai Gow during the New Year, a guest arrived, with money wrapped around his waist. The tea house owner invited the guest to be the banker, and the guest readily agreed. However, he said that his tiles were old and asked the owner if he had any new tiles. The owner said that he didn't have any new tiles, but a guest had pawned a set of tiles at the end of last year, which were brand new. So he took out the tiles. In the first few rounds, the guest lost continuously, but his expression was calm. He continued to bet. All the gamblers thought that the guest was easy to beat and saw that he had a lot of money, so those who initially bet one or two yuan now bet five or six yuan. Those who bet five or six yuan now bet ten or more yuan. Those who bet ten or more yuan now bet dozens of yuan. Those who bet dozens of yuan now bet over a hundred yuan. However, after they increased their bets, the players kept losing and the banker kept winning. Before they could finish a few rounds, all the gamblers were empty-handed and looked at each other in dismay. The guest then left fully loaded. After the guest left, some gamblers suspected that the guest had used tricks and that they had fallen into his trap. They asked the tea house owner about the origin of the tiles. The tea house owner told the truth, which made them even more suspicious. They examined the tiles carefully and found that they all had secret marks. The two guests, before and after, were actually accomplices. The previous guest, wanting to plant the tiles in the tea house, pretended to be penniless and pawned them to pay the rickshaw fare. The guest who was the banker this time, wanting to lure people to win, deliberately lost heavily in the first few rounds. The tea house owner and the gamblers did not know that the two guests were tricksters and unwittingly fell into their trap. There are many different tricks used by gamblers. This is just one of them. I record it here in the hope that it will serve as a warning to those who are addicted to gambling.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall</h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>▲ Built on the Site of the Former Presidential Palace</p>
<p>When President Sun was elected Provisional President in Guangdong, he took office in Guangzhou. The Presidential Palace was located to the right of the provincial government office, below Guanyin Mountain. Not long after, Chen Jiongming led a mutiny and sent Ye Ju and others to attack the Presidential Palace. President Sun narrowly escaped and was spared. The humiliation was unforgettable for the whole country. The local Cantonese people especially witnessed this change and deeply felt righteous indignation. The Guangdong provincial authorities therefore built the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall on the site of the former Presidential Palace as a permanent memorial to the President. It has now been completed and is about to be finished. It is solemn and magnificent, with excellent construction, making it one of the most magnificent buildings in Guangzhou. It is said that the construction cost reached more than three million yuan. The opening ceremony will be held soon. I once visited Mr. Lin Zhimian, a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Construction of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and he introduced me to visit and appreciate the magnificent Memorial Hall. Remembering the Presidential Palace that suffered劫, I can't help but recall President Sun.</p>
<h3>Spring Night Song</h3>
<p>— Lao Zhuo</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many amateur opera clubs in Shanghai. The number of people who love opera is increasing. The sound of Peking opera is almost like a household chant. Therefore, amateur opera clubs have emerged in response to the times. Among them, the Zhonghua Club, established only two years ago, and the Shenshang Club, which was just born last autumn, have become well-known. Last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday were the spring rehearsals of Zhonghua Club and Shenshang Club, and they also celebrated the 69th birthday of Mr. Yuan Ludeng's mother. Each club performed two plays each day. I will describe what I saw. On Saturday night, I watched Zhonghua Club perform "Entering the Palace Twice" at the Ningbo Association Hall. Wang Detian, He Wuliang, and Mrs. Zhu Naigeng jointly performed in the play. The singing in this play is heavy, requiring equal skill from all three roles. If they are in harmony, there will be no unevenness. That night, Wang's jing, He's sheng, and Zhu's qingyi sang like a horizontal line, consistent throughout. Zhu Lianfu and Mr. Wu Laopu's "Stealing the Imperial Horse." Mr. Zhu has been studying Xiaolou recently and is trying his best to follow him. He has indeed reached the point of seeing the pond and gaining understanding. Wu's Dou Erdun is quite like Li Lianzhong in those years. Mr. Zhang Weiru and Ms. Yingyun's "Selling Horses." Mr. Zhang played the xiaosheng, and his expression and stage presence were very elegant and natural. Ms. Yingyun played Guizhi, which was her first time playing the role. Her teasing attitude towards her husband when writing the petition and her surprise after handing it in were all well done. She may have also gained understanding from watching Wan Hua. Mr. Yu Yefeng's "Taking Beiyuan." His singing was both old and showed the dignified and inviolable spirit of Duke Shi. Mr. Yuan Ludeng's "Jinma Gate." Mr. Yuan is a scholar who loves wine, which fits the identity of the Qinglian scholar. There is a tendency for them to coincide unintentionally. On Sunday night, I watched the play at the Shenshang Opera Club. Mr. Li Baishui's "Six Departments Trial." His long recitation was coherent and logical. It is said that this was his first time performing this play, and he did not show any awkwardness throughout the show, indicating that he is a skilled performer. Mr. Zhang Zhongyuan's "Beating Yan Song" is very similar to Qilin Tong. His voice and figure are naturally similar, so he did not need to study it to achieve the effect. It is also a unique talent. Mrs. Chen Baoshu's "He Empress Scolding the Palace" has a fresh tone, approaching Cheng Yushuang. Mr. Fang Cenyi, Mr. Guo , Mr. Li Chuaneng, and Mr. Jiang Bogong's "Yellow Crane Tower." Fang's figure is tall and slender, and his movements and singing are very lively. He is truly a xiaosheng talent. Guo's Liu Bei is slightly short, but he is good at acting. Li's Zhao Yun has a neat appearance and steady structure. Jiang's Zhuge Liang's scene of playing with the three generals has a humorous quality, but he still retains his original face. The reason is that Mr. Jiang is known for his expertise in playing clown roles. Mr. Chen Jingtang's "Qiu Lian Zhai." He can handle several long sections of singing with ease. It is truly not the result of one day's work. There are also Mr. Wang Xiubo and Mr. Cao Liangjie's "Si Lang Visits His Mother." Because it was late, I did not have time to watch it. The next day, after waking up from a spring dream, I still felt the lingering singing in my ears. Therefore, I picked up my pen and recorded it like this.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Longan Tree of Guanyin Cave in Yandang Mountain</h3>
<p>— Xie Qing</p>
<p>Last autumn, I was a guest in Wenzhou and traveled with friends to Yandang Mountain. After three nights, we arrived at Guanyin Cave and rested there. The cave is one of the famous scenic spots in Yandang Mountain. The cliffs and rocks stretch straight to the sky. North Star Cave is located on the side, and Double Bamboo Shoot Peak stands in front, which is quite majestic. At the entrance of the cave, a winding path leads to the entrance, and the sound of gurgling water can be heard. It is said that the spring water flows from the side of the cliff. Climbing the steps, there is a building. At first, it is extremely narrow, but then it suddenly opens up, where you can drink and paint. There are thirteen buildings in total, built in natural stages according to the cliffs and rocks. It is extremely elegant. Climbing up and looking into the distance, the clouds and mists are halfway up the mountain, and ten thousand mountains are towering and green. The wonders of the mountains and rivers are breathtaking. It is truly a great spectacle. After the monks of the temple entertained us for a long time, they suddenly raised their heads and pointed to the sky in the cave, saying to me, "This is the wondrous longan tree." We were all surprised and looked up at it together. Hidden in the void, we indeed saw a large tree standing on the cliff in the cave, swaying slightly. Looking at it from the highest building, it was only as small as a finger. It is said that the bottom of the cave is thousands of feet below. I marveled at it again and again. The monk also said, "The wonders of this tree cannot be expressed in words. Every year near the Mid-Autumn Festival, the longan ripens and falls. The most wondrous thing is that only one falls per year. It is as big as a pear, with a strange fragrance and delicious taste. It is offered to the gods as a joke and cannot be compared with the vulgar goods sold in the market." The monk also said that according to legend in the cave, this tree was planted by the founding god of the cave, showing the sacred place. It has been thousands of years. The wind, frost, rain, and snow in the mountains cannot move its majestic posture. It is probably formed by absorbing the essence of heaven and earth and the aura of mountains and rivers.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Double-Mouthed Fish of Laiyi County, Hebei</h3>
<p>— Pou Li</p>
<p>Fish whose names are known throughout the world, such as the Yellow River carp and the Songjiang perch, are familiar to all of us. However, there are few records, and some people are not familiar with their experiences. Therefore, I will use my pen to record them for the research of biologists.</p>
<p>Laiyi County is located in the northern corner of the Western Mausoleum and produces a lot of charcoal. The area is hundreds of miles, divided into the front of the mountain and the back of the mountain. The back of the mountain is barren and mountainous, and the folk customs are fierce. The front of the mountain is slightly flatter, and the people are more intelligent. There is little communication with the back of the mountain, and there are many barriers. The feelings are especially discordant. Ten miles west of the city in front of the mountain, there is a ravine. I forgot its name, but it is commonly known as Runshui Ravine. It is about five or six feet in circumference and less than a zhang deep. It is located between the mountains and water, and the scenery is beautiful. It is the best in the county. Every year during the Winter Solstice and the beginning of Spring, more than a dozen fish are produced every day. Their shape is very different from ordinary ones. The scales are fine and the color is as white as silver. The body of the fish is fat and long, and the head and tail are relatively sharp. There is a second mouth growing under the mouth, and the shape is the same. After cooking, it has an unusual fragrance and a sweet and delicious taste. It can be called the best dish. Moreover, the number of fish produced each day is fixed. If the fisherman searches and finds nothing in the morning, he will not get anything all day. He will go fishing again the next day and get the fish as before. In the past, the people of the county regarded it as a rare and precious thing and selected it as a tribute. They did not treat guests lightly. It was never available in the market, and it was not something that could be easily tasted in the human world. After the founding of the Republic of China, the bad customs were eliminated, and it was sometimes given as a gift. In the winter of Jiazi, when I was working as an auditor at the Pinghan Railway Station, my friend Chen Jiyou happened to be the head of Laiyi County. He invited me to spend the year in his office. That night, in the middle of the banquet, I was able to taste this fish. Everyone at the table praised it endlessly. After a certain gentleman at the table explained the process, I felt that I had been blessed with good fortune this time, and compared to the Yellow Carp and Songjiang Perch, it was really a world of difference.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Traveling in Europe (1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>In order to study ancient and modern art, I lived in various parts of Italy for a month. On the evening of the day before we were about to leave Rome, the embassy secretary Qu Chang and Yu Yinpu came to help us settle the room fee. The landlord was Italian and had a daughter who was good at dancing. Yinpu was learning to dance and was lively. His humor was like Chaplin's. Because we were leaving tomorrow, we did many extracurricular activities to express our farewell. After the dance, we watched a movie in a theater opposite the residence. The movie was mixed with singing and acting. This movie theater, although only of medium quality in Rome, has extremely innovative architecture. The roof can be moved at any time. During breaks, the ceiling cover is completely removed, allowing direct airflow, as if sitting outdoors. I have seen such movie theater architecture in England, France, and Germany. Speaking of interior decoration, it is simple and beautiful, with modern popular cubist patterns, making people feel comfortable. The film industry in Shanghai has developed very rapidly in recent years. The architecture of several movie theaters is quite comparable to those in Europe. If there were buildings like the movie theaters in Rome, it might make the audience even more satisfied.</p>
<p>I got up at six o'clock the next morning. I went to the street to buy some food for the car. It was too early, and some shops were not yet open. I only saw a fruit shop about to open and bought all kinds of fruit. Italian oranges are famous for their sweetness and juiciness, and the price is cheap. One kilo is two lira (equivalent to three jiao in national currency), several times cheaper than in Germany and France. It is said that Italy ships four or five trains of oranges out of the country every day. I got on the train at 7:20. Chen Deyi came to the train to see me off. Deyi is from Tianjin and entered the Royal Conservatory of Music in Rome three years ago to study music. Chinese people who study music in Europe only know some techniques and do not understand the profound theory. Deyi specializes in studying musical scores and has made great progress. I received a lot of help in explaining the historical sites of Rome when I arrived in Rome. He only had five minutes to talk before the train left. I felt the train starting to move slowly.</p>

<h3>Financial Market Gold Bullion Strongly Rebounds</h3>
<p>▲Extremely Wide Range of Fluctuations</p>
<p>▲Soars More Than Sixteen Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, March 5th, gold bullion suddenly trended upwards, fluctuating unpredictably. However, the daily change was extremely violent and chaotic, varying by as much as twenty-four taels from morning to evening. The turbulence was intense and unstoppable, with the overall surge exceeding sixteen taels. As for exchange rates, they initially rose but later declined, ultimately ending slightly higher. The domestic market seemed slightly firmer, seemingly unaffected by the reported rise in overseas silver markets. This was likely because there were no changes in the European market due to peace. Consequently, the initial opening price of gold rose slightly. Major players like Hengxing aggressively countered short positions, while Zhifeng, Yongfuchang, and others also competed to buy. Sellers included Yuanmaoyong and those engaging in arbitrage. Subsequently, the situation became complex, with fluctuations of ten taels at a time. The price once fell to 742 or 743 taels in the morning, followed by a loosening of exchange rates. Around noon, Hengxing and others continued to buy tirelessly, pushing the price up by more than ten taels. In the afternoon, Hengxing continued to buy aggressively, purchasing over ten thousand bars in total, further increasing the price by another ten taels. Rumors circulated that cash would be allowed by mid-March, and it was also rumored that a certain bank was buying a large quantity of physical gold from various bullion dealers, totaling about three thousand bars. Upon hearing this, market sentiment immediately soared, breaking through the 760-tael mark. The situation was the opposite of the previous day. The foreign exchange trend was also favorable, suggesting that large bars would likely fall this morning.</p>
<p>▲Early Market Attitude Hesitant</p>
<p>The opening price for April futures was 751.5 taels, an increase of 2.3 taels. However, large bars had already increased by one-quarter, and the price of silver also increased by 0.85, as indicated by private telegrams. The overall price had been underestimated the day before yesterday. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of four to five taels. Yuanmaoyong and others sold, lowering the price to 47.2 taels. Zhifeng, Yongheng, and others bought, pushing it back up to 53 taels. Later, the market hovered around five taels. The initial announced price was 51 taels, a rise of 3.75 on the official exchange rate, $75 for US dollars, and a slight decrease of 0.45 for Japanese yen. Hongli, Qianchangxiang, and others sold, with British gold for April/May settling at 8125, Erjing absorbing 875, and banks doing interbank transactions at 30.0125, causing the overall price to plummet by eight or nine taels. At 9:45, the price was 42.3 taels. Hengxing, Yuanheng, and others then bought aggressively, soaring twelve taels after 10:00. However, there were occasional dips of two to three taels. At 10:30, the price was 55 taels. Suddenly, Dadecheng and arbitrageurs showed strong selling interest, causing a sharp drop of nine taels in one hour, reaching 46 taels at 11:30. Afterwards, Hengxing, Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, and others bought vigorously, pushing the price up eleven taels in just twenty minutes, reaching 57 taels. Some retailers then sold, and the market closed at 53.5 taels at noon, then rose again to 4.5 taels, before retreating to 3.5 to 4 taels. In general, the market was hesitant and lacked clear direction. The announced price was changed to 804.6 taels, a deduction of 54 to 62 or 63 taels, hovering around 50 taels at noon.</p>
<p>▲Afternoon Market Steadily Advances</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 54 taels, then 2.23 taels. Hengxing, Shengda, Chang Zhifengyong, and others tended to pursue gains. Rumors spread that cash might be allowed for export soon. The exchange market was also firm, and insiders began to buy. Indian exchange rates also slightly recovered by 0.25 annas. As a result, the gold market surged, resembling a rapidly rising sun, breaking through the 60-tael mark, reaching 66.5 taels at 3:15. At this time, the English bill settled for only 0.625. Before long, it returned to 63.5 taels. Suddenly, HSBC's official exchange rate was adjusted down by half a grade, decreasing 0.125 for English gold, 0.25 for US dollars, and increasing 0.015 for Japanese yen. It then rose to 65.5 taels. Later, due to banks selling English gold at 0.6875, the price was immediately suppressed, reaching 61.5 taels.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Domestic Market Tight</h3>
<p>▲Gold firms are buying and selling English and American exchange bills... to arbitrage the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, English, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported gains. However, the market remained stable. HSBC's official exchange rate was initially increased by one and a half grades in the morning and later reduced by half a grade in the afternoon. Overall, it increased by one grade (increasing 0.25 for English gold, $0.5 for US dollars, and decreasing 0.03 for Japanese yen).

It was not as dramatic as the gold market's surge. By the close of the market, compared to the previous day, English gold decreased by 0.0625, US dollars decreased by 0.125, and Japanese yen increased by 0.075.

Taiwan Wheat firms, Korean Mitsui, and others sold. There were also many interbank transactions. Over 200,000 yuan of US dollars were traded. Mitsui only slightly absorbed Japanese yen. Gold firms mainly bought and sold English and American exchange bills to arbitrage the market, because the high gold price allowed them to profit from arbitrage.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton Markets Surge</h3>
<p>▲Rumors Say Local Yarn Is Being Shipped to Japan</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, with a drastic upward momentum. The main reasons for this are the solid foundation of raw cotton prices and the unsteady upward trend of third-grade yarn prices, which are making major players more resolute and exerting stronger pulling force. Gold prices have also risen, and there are rumors that local yarn is being shipped to Japan. As a result, market sentiment is exceptionally tight, and short positions are showing signs of panic. Favorable political situations in India and the prospect of commercial recovery in Europe have prompted speculators to compete to buy, causing a sharp surge in the market. However, the sales of current yarn are still sluggish, with only some trading in the north. The future of the yarn market is still difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Experiences a Drastic Surge</h3>
<p>▲Gold Prices Soar... Optimism for Indian Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market is doing well, and the upward trend is sharp, thanks to rising gold prices and positive news from the Indian political situation, which has led to high expectations for Indian cotton.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Weak. White japonica rice continues to fall by approximately 0.10 yuan. Special grade rice opened at 13.20 yuan, and the market is very weak. However, if the sky turns cloudy, it may stabilize. Light indica rice sales are sluggish, and buying interest is very quiet, falling by 0.50 chi. Yang indica rice is also being reduced. Most shop customers are watching. Top grade opened at 12.30 yuan. Du Jian and Bu Jian are all stable. Although the Biantang market is weak, prices are unchanged. This is due to the limited selling and arrival of goods.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, more than 20 boats from Hunan arrived in Shanghai, and the sales market in the street was extremely stagnant. Common Su Chang, Changshu, Wuxi all showed weak sales. High-quality goods dropped by 0.20 yuan, and medium-quality goods had to decrease by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The decline was more severe than in the North market. The South gang early thin paddy had slight movement, and the incoming goods have accumulated. Prices vary by about 0.1-0.2 yuan. Market sales for both Yongdu and Jianjie are stable. The incoming of Bianyiyuan is rare, and market sales are mediocre. The general market declines by nearly 0.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer Rice Sales Increase and Prices Rise by About 0.10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer indica rice market was in a stalemate. Due to the depletion of stock among customers, they firmly refused to sell. And the customer had no counsel about the market, and the market seemed stale. However, the market was somewhat discussed by hoarding groups. But all customers for Customer rice are welcomed. The market gradually saw rising prices. Yesterday, Shantou gang, Beidu, and others sold 210 packages of Jiangxi machine rice at the price of 14.35 to 13 yuan. 340 packages of Hunan machine rice were sold at the price of 14.15 yuan.

<h3>Flour Market Improves in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>▲The Sky Turns Rainy... Gold Prices Rise Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market's prices were mostly stable because foreign wheat was quoted at only about 0.10 yuan higher, and the weather was still sunny. There was some revolving. However, the market improved in the afternoon when the sky turned rainy and gold prices also rose slightly. In the near term, because the spot price was still high, with a difference of 0.10 yuan from the standard, sentiment was quite good, and improvements were seen. There were few transactions for the long term, and the increase was small. As a result, this month increased by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. April increased by 0.0125 yuan. May increased by 0.005 yuan. June to August improved by 0.0025 yuan.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>▲Small and Medium Factories Replenish Slightly in the Near Term</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market presented an initially stable and then steady appearance for each month in the morning and afternoon. The prices showed that the foreign wheat offer saw only slight improvement in the morning, and the market seemed flat. In the afternoon, flour prices rose slightly, and small and medium factories slightly replenished in the near term, so each market saw slight improvements. Currently, foreign wheat from each factory is continuously imported. Yesterday, another boat from Qie Xin arrived, berthing at Pier 3, with an estimated amount of approximately 9,000 tons. In this case, it is too difficult to expect good results. It is difficult to have a good result. The spot wheat market has been quiet for a long time, but yesterday it was traded more smoothly. A thousand bags of Kai Xiang store wheat were priced at 3.77 yuan. 1,500 bags of Renqiao wheat were priced at 3.65 yuan. A thousand bags were handled by Hua Feng.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea New York Silk Changed from Weak to Strong</h3>
<p>The New York market previously declined because Japanese silk imports were becoming more and more prosperous, and supply exceeded demand. In addition, Japanese merchants were constantly selling at low prices. Since the beginning of the week, silk factories have been replenishing raw materials for the summer. The turnover has turned smoothly, and silk prices have tended to rise. The price of grade A is 3 US dollars per pound, the price of grade B is 2 yuan and 51 fen, and the price of grade O is 1 yuan and 98 fen. These prices have risen by more than 0.20 yuan from the prices last week.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port continued to be firm.</h3>
<p>Because each silk firm thinks that overseas silk sales are becoming more robust and strong and the silk electricity converts to Shanghai. In addition, the exchange rate is stable, they all start to throw and buy. Silk dealers, however, still think that silk itself is not slack, so they don't dare to sell more. Yesterday, 期丝、昨祗笔笃、等进沪白厂、经现货四十包、信孚、等进黄厂、经十五包、三星、等进黄粗丝十八包、价均坚涨云、</p>
<h3>Gongxi Green Tea Indian Sales Became Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port, namely the Congxi green tea from the coming stores, and Bai Tou Zhuangqian, Yifulin and other companies, and the Hua Tea Company, all started running. More than 240 boxes were traded in the entire market. The selling price ranged from 23 taels to 37.5 yuan. It was slightly firmer than before. Sales of the Needle type were also slightly active. The market situation for Jane and green tea was still desolate. The goods in the Wuyuan store were sluggish in the end.</p>
<h3>One Cash Increase in Figured Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>The market for cotton cloth from our mill saw a sudden surge yesterday, especially in figured cotton cloth, which uniformly rose by one cash. The reason is that Eastern cotton firms are vigorously buying in bulk. Agents from Hankou, Sichuan, and Niuzhuang are all active, so people are optimistic. Blue Flying Angle reached a high of eight taels and one cash, Super Double Fish seven taels and six and a half cash, Colored Ball Trumpet Boy Yang Crane six taels two and a half fen, Blue Chicken seven taels four cash. Group cloth with nine pounds of fabric is the firmest, Five Blessings five taels one and a half cash, Treasure Pot five taels and five fen. Coarse twill from Shaanxi agents saw slight movement, with 150 pieces sold yesterday. Eagle five taels one cash, Three Fish five taels three cash, Three Rabbit five taels two and a half cash. Dyed cloth from Sichuan, Qingdao and other agents all had large transactions yesterday, so figured cloth and fine twill are becoming increasingly scarce, and there is a great potential for continued growth and price increases.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Our Mill's Rock Sugar Falls Three Cash</h3>
<p>▲ Leased Sand White Market Quiet and Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from the production areas stating that Cuban raw sugar was unchanged. New York futures for March fell by just over two fen, also with each falling by one fen. Javanese raw and futures sugar showed no change. In the guild market, No. 24 sugar sand white trading was scarce, but due to the exchange rate falling and then rebounding, prices slightly recovered, with high-quality goods sought after at ten taels and five cash, or ten taels and nine and a half cash, but buyers were hesitant, leading to a stalemate, with no transactions throughout the city. The market seemed balanced. No. 20 medium sugar white at ten taels four cash was also quiet. No. 8 and 9 Ho Red at nine taels five to six cash had slight trading, and the market was relatively stable. Japanese sugar transactions were also scattered, with YRO mark at ten taels five cash, YT mark at ten taels eight cash, Minghua YT mark at ten taels seven and a half cash, TK mark at ten taels eight and a half cash, showing slight trading, while the rest were sluggish. The market was flat and weak. There were over one hundred packages of domestic Huanggang Qing Kai at a price of seven taels eight cash. Our mill's rock sugar market turned weak due to the drop in raw material leased sand white. Yesterday, the mill sold over three hundred packages of opening, with Central character priced at fourteen taels one cash and Hua character at fourteen taels, but demand was not strong, and the market appeared flat and unremarkable, falling by three cash compared to the previous trading day.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: White Lotus Ground Price Drops One Yuan</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Lanxi yesterday, the price of white lotus has eased. Top lotus was previously forty-nine yuan in the market, but now it has fallen to forty-eight yuan. The current price of barrel-packed face lotus is fifty yuan, which is not very cost-effective for Shanghai, so few are dealing in it. Yesterday, the Shanghai market sold barrel-packed high-quality white lotus for forty to thirty-nine taels, and bag-packed goods of lower quality for thirty-eight to thirty-seven taels. The trend is stable.</p>
<p>Hardware Jobbers' Sales Gradually Activate</p>
<p>The hardware trade has been quite quiet recently, but sales by jobbers are gradually becoming active. As a result, a considerable amount of goods has been offered, but the transaction volume is not as large as that of the manufacturers, so the appearance is even more bustling. More than 500 dan of new foreign silver dollars and new silver slabs were purchased by the Yantai and Tianjin agents at a price of six taels and six and a half cash. More than 300 dan of Nos. 16 to 20 new lead wire were also purchased, and the selling price was no different from before. Tinplate is distributed extensively to Qingdao, Fujian and this street. The price of 90-pound British goods is firmer, selling for sixteen taels, with no other differences. The price of Eastern white iron was cheaper yesterday due to the softer Eastern exchange rate, with six-foot iron at one tael and five fen, and seven-foot iron at one tael and two and a half cash. The largest number of buyers were on Changjiang Road, and many inland agents also inquired. Forty-eight sheets of American white iron were sold for twenty-one taels and seven and a half cash, down two and a half cash from before, and seventy or eighty bundles have been purchased by Hankou agents. Although there were transactions in other colors, there was no activity in the market. The market for company iron is trending flat due to the impact of the abundant supply of British goods, and the price trend shows a weak interior despite a strong exterior. There were few transactions in green lead and tin, and the market was stable. It is reported that Shaoxing agents are coming to Shanghai to procure tin, so the atmosphere is tense. There are still no arrivals of chess piece copper, and the market price is shouted up to two hundred and twenty taels. It is said that furnace workshops and Tianjin agents want to procure a lot, but there is a general lack of available stock. Four or five hundred bundles of black iron sheet were sold yesterday, reportedly mostly old stock, so the price is extremely cheap, calculated at nine taels eight and a half cash for three-by-six-foot sheets, and twelve taels for two-by-six-foot sheets, which is two or three taels lower than the current market price. Two-and-a-half to three-fen British steel plates are being offered, but there is no equivalent in the market.</p>

<h3>Japanese Fishing Boat Sinks Chinese Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>▲ The old hatred of "May 9th" has not been eliminated</p>
<p>▲ New disasters of rampant violence across the sea have begun again</p>
<p>Japanese people often cross the sea to fish in our country's waters, infringing on the fishing industry. Last month, a Japanese fishing boat even sank our country's fishing boat. Now negotiations have yielded no results. This matter concerns sovereignty, and the details are investigated as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Sinking of a Chinese fishing boat: Zhu A'gen, a fisherman from Dinghai County, had a fishing boat fishing in Dinghai waters. At that time, the Japanese fishing boat Himejima Maru also crossed the sea to Dinghai to fish. The Chinese fishing boat, believing that it had violated our territorial waters, stepped forward to negotiate. However, the Japanese fishing boat, relying on its larger size, violently rammed Zhu A'gen's boat, causing a hole and sinking the boat immediately. Fortunately, Zhu was rescued, but the entire boat was submerged in the sea, resulting in huge losses.</p>
<p>▲ The Ministry of Foreign Affairs approves prosecution: After this incident occurred, the fishing community submitted a public report to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Japanese side, requesting compensation for the sunken ship and other losses, and guaranteeing that Japanese fishing boats would not be allowed to enter our territorial waters to fish in the future. It was found that the ship belonged to the Nagasaki Kihei Joint Venture Company of Japan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believed that this matter involved private litigation and, as usual, should be sued directly by the victim in a Japanese court. After the approval order arrived, the Zhejiang fishermen were in an uproar.</p>
<p>▲ Fishermen tearfully plead for relief: The victimized fisherman Zhu A'gen continued to petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: The case of the sinking of the people's fishing boat by the Japanese fishing boat Himejima Maru has been submitted to your ministry for negotiation and is awaiting instructions in pain. However, an approval order has been received stating that the matter concerns private litigation and should be negotiated in a Japanese court, and must bear litigation costs of two to three thousand yuan. The people make a living by fishing and have no permanent property. Having suffered this great change, their livelihoods have been cut off. The fathers, elders, children, and young ones are starving and freezing. The miserable situation is understood. How can they raise such a huge amount? Moreover, Japanese ships crossing the sea to fish already violate international public law, and deliberately provoke trouble by sinking fishing boats, which is even more inhumane. Serious negotiations are needed to curb the ambitions of the predatory country and protect national rights. Our national government leads the people in a life-and-death struggle against imperialism. For this act of betraying power and humiliating the country, revolutionary diplomacy should be used to achieve the goal of compensation and self-defense. If individual litigation is recognized and a lawsuit is filed in a Japanese court, meeting the Japanese in a Japanese court, without waiting for the wise, one should know that there is no chance of winning the lawsuit. The people are just fishermen, how can they raise this huge amount? If justice is subject to power, the people's loss is a small matter, but what about national rights? "May 9th", the old hatred has not been eliminated, and rampant violence across the sea has started a new disaster. The people have suffered innocently, and feel it deeply. Being compelled, they again submit to your ministry, requesting serious negotiations with Nagasaki Kihei Company to achieve the goal of compensating for losses and prohibiting Japanese ships from coming again.

<h3>Japanese Fishing Vessels Employ All Kinds of Tricks</h3>
<p>▲ Hanging the Chinese flag has been automatically cancelled</p>
<p>▲ Fishing vessels also try to evade taxes when entering port</p>
<p>▲ Fisheries authorities are actively seeking to prevent it</p>
<p>Nichi Nichi Shimbun says: Thirty-two Japanese hand-drawn net fishing vessels invade the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in our country to catch pomfret, transport it to Shanghai to compete for sale, and seize the market. Various sectors in our country have seriously opposed this. Japanese fishing vessels have changed to flying the Chinese flag in an attempt to deceive people, and intend to go a step further and register with our country's government offices to protect their long-term interests in fishing in China. This was investigated and confirmed by Hou Zhaohai of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining, who reported it to the Provincial Department and then to the Ministry of Industry, which seriously negotiated. The Japanese knew that the matter had been exposed and it was difficult to succeed, so they recently automatically cancelled the Chinese flags hung by the fishing vessels to conceal the traces. However, when each fishing vessel sailed into the Wusongkou, they claimed to imitate the method of foreign vessels entering the port, directly arrived at Yangshupu, and then reported to the customs for inspectors to assess the tax. According to customs regulations, foreign fish entering the port must pay a fish tax of two yuan per hundred catties. However, it takes a little over an hour to sail directly from Wusongkou to Yangshupu. During this space, the Japanese have already transported the fish carried by the fishing vessels to other ships, and only a few fresh fish are left in the fishing vessels to report for taxation. Therefore, each fishing vessel carries about 1,000 dan of fresh fish when entering the port, but only a few dozen dan are inspected and taxed. Their tricks are endless, and are indeed beyond the imagination of the Chinese. However, after investigation, our country's fisheries authorities have confirmed that they are actively seeking ways to prevent it.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Industry Associations in the Three Regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai Discussed Silk Industry Bonds Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Representatives Elected to Go to Beijing</p>
<p>▲ Requesting Government Relief</p>
<p>Due to the silk industry bond case, silk factory industry associations in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai held an emergency meeting of all representatives from the three regions at the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 5th). Those who attended included Zhejiang representatives Chu Huiseng, Zhu Mou first, etc., Wuxi representatives Miao Shaoqing, Yang Yuchu, etc., Shanghai representatives Huang Jin Chen, Zhu Jing'an, Wang Xiaolai, etc., and all manufacturers, a total of more than 150 people. Shen was publicly elected as the chairman. After the opening ceremony, the chairman announced the purpose of the meeting and reported on the draft telegram to the National Government, which was approved by the committee meeting on the 3rd of this month. The Silk Industry Bond Case was discussed, and representatives Wang Xiaolai, Chu Huiseng, Zhu Mou first, and Huang Jin Fan rose to express their opinions one after another. In general, they all believed that the silk factories received too little practical benefit and bore too heavy a burden from the reported silk industry bond regulations. If the regulations amended by the Legislative Yuan are implemented, it will be contrary to the principle of relief. The amount of relief bonds requested by the silk factory industry was originally set at 10 million yuan. Later, Vice Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Finance came to Shanghai and convened representatives of the silk factory industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai on the Central Bank floor to hold a conversation. It was decided to reduce it to 7 million yuan, with 1 million yuan to improve sericulture and 6 million yuan to relieve the factory silk industry. Now the Legislative Yuan has reduced it to 6 million yuan, with one-third used to reward silk exports. That is, with this 2 million yuan, the silk factory industry in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai will be evenly distributed. Assuming that there are 25,000 packages of silk in stock, each package of silk can receive 80 yuan face value of bonds. According to a weekly interest rate of 6%, the market price can be sold at a discount of 70%, only 56 yuan in real currency can be obtained. At the same time, for each silk export, a fund of 22 yuan and 50 cents must be deducted. Only 33 yuan and 50 cents remain. The silk factory industry receives this small benefit, and from then on, a special tax of 22 yuan and 50 cents must be paid for each silk export, and the time is seven and a half years. Plus interest, the losses suffered by the industry are significant. The silk factory industry is now on the verge of bankruptcy due to business operations, requesting government relief. Now the government is nominally issuing 6 million yuan in relief bonds, but the silk factory industry actually only receives one-third, and the silk factory industry must bear the entire 6 million yuan in principal. This is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst. It is not the way for the government to relieve the silk industry. Moreover, according to this small amount, even if it is allocated to each manufacturer, it still cannot quench thirst even by drinking poison. A government that understands the difficulties of business should not do this. At this point in the discussion, the silk merchants were all indignant, and there was a lot of discussion. Everyone believed that the regulations amended by the Legislative Yuan were impossible to comply with and were willing to cancel the bond case to avoid being burdened with the good name of relief. For a time, the situation in the venue was tense. After Chairman Shen repeatedly comforted and deliberated, the representatives discussed repeatedly. Representative Chu proposed three measures, and representatives Wang Xiaolai and Hui Seng were immediately elected to take a car to Beijing overnight to visit Chairman Chiang and present the difficult situation to the Yuan and departments, requesting (1) Please maintain Vice Minister Zhang of Finance's original proposal to issue 7 million yuan in bonds, with 1 million yuan to improve sericulture and 6 million yuan to relieve the silk industry, as agreed with the representatives in Shanghai. (2) If this cannot be done, please allow the silk factory industry to allocate and relieve all of the 6 million yuan in bonds, and separately extract 2 million yuan from the future fund to improve sericulture. (3) If neither of the first two points can be done, please exempt all silk cocoon donations and taxes to reduce the burden on silk merchants. The entire audience stood up and voted to approve. Before the representatives drafted a brief telegram to Chairman Chiang, it was approved by the public, sent, and then the meeting was adjourned. It was already past 7 o'clock. The original telegram to Chairman Chiang is recorded below. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Nanjing National Government, "According to reports, the silk industry bond regulations are far from the purpose of requesting relief, and the public is alarmed. At today's meeting, it was publicly decided to elect Wang Xiaolai and Chu Huiseng as representatives to visit Beijing tonight to request instructions. We hereby telegraph our statement first." Shanghai Zhejiang Wuxi Silk Factory Industry Association jointly kowtows, Wei.</p>
<h3>Starting Today, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Resume Reporting for Transportation</h3>
<p>▲ Customs Brokerage Association Decided Yesterday</p>
<p>Shanghai forwarding customs brokerage industry, after cotton yarn and cotton cloth factories pay the unified tax, the black corner pass that should be copied by the customs is stopped from being copied, which makes the procedures for customs declaration more cumbersome and requires advance payment of customs duties. In order to protect its own industry, it was jointly decided to stop reporting for transportation of yarn and cloth from the first of this month. Although the Unified Tax Administration has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to order the Jianghai Customs to no longer re-levy the yarn and cloth tax, the customs inspection procedures have not been changed. Cotton cloth yarn factories and other industry associations feel that if they hold on for a long time, both parties will suffer unnecessary losses. Therefore, they sent a letter to the forwarding customs brokerage industry, requesting that they resume reporting for transportation immediately. After the association received the letter, it held a meeting yesterday afternoon at the Customs Brokerage Industry Association to discuss it. More than 40 people including Shi Zhikun, You Senting, and Tang Zhiqin attended. The following resolution was passed by the public: (1) Resolution: The tax advance payment resolved the other day has been permitted by the customs to be exempted from repayment. However, the difficulty of customs inspection and the danger of customs return, and the receipt of letters from the Cotton Yarn Cotton Cloth Association Yarn Factory Joint Association requesting the restoration of the original state of reporting for transportation, the public resolved that it should be reported for transportation as usual on March 6. As for the danger, it will be requested to the customs for a change in handling. (2) The wharf donation for the reporting of transportation of yarn and cloth shall be paid by the factory. Now that the unified tax has been established, the wharf shall be contacted by this association to the Yarn Factory Joint Association Cotton Cloth Association to forward to the factories. The factory that sells the goods shall be responsible for paying as before. (3) Resolution: Request the Unified Tax Administration that the factory-based staff of each yarn and cloth factory must extend their time and may leave the factory only after the factory has finished its work. The customs staff must leave the customs only after the customs procedures have been completed. (4) Resolution: From now on, for the yarn factory cloth that is reported for transportation on behalf of customers, a handling fee of two cents of silver will be charged to the customer for each piece. This association will notify the industry. (5) Resolution: Request the Unified Tax Administration that the number must be noted on the tax certificate of completion so that it can be checked and reissued if it is lost. (6) Resolution: According to the report of Yi Sheng Chang, a piece of silk cargo that was entrusted to Dalian Post Ship Company for transportation has now been lost, and the association should send a letter to Dalian Post Ship Company to compensate according to the cargo price. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>The Shanghai forwarding customs brokerage industry believes that after the unified tax is paid for reporting the transportation of yarn and cloth, the customs still needs to inspect the customs, and this matter is extremely dangerous. Customs inspection takes an indefinite amount of time, and the industry bears the responsibility of the Huangpu River and various other responsibilities. Therefore, it is requested that the association send a letter to the customs immediately. It is best if the inspection can be exempted. If it is impossible, please provide relief and give an appropriate time or inspect it as soon as it arrives to reduce the burden on the industry. It has been resolved to request the customs. It is reported that Shi Zhikun, the chairman of the Customs Brokerage Industry Association, has prepared a public letter and submitted it to the Jianghai Customs for review.</p>

<p>[P Major General Tan's Talk</p>
<p>▲ It is not difficult to quell the Jiangxi bandits</p>
<p>Tan Daoyuan, commander of the 50th Division and commander-in-chief, went to Beijing this time from Jiangxi to present a plan to suppress the bandits to Chairman Chiang, which was highly commended. Tan arrived in Shanghai the night before last. A reporter from the Xinmin News Agency specially visited him yesterday at Tao Jianhua's residence on Avenue Joffre. Tan's wife and son were also present. The following conversation took place: Reporter asked: "Where is your headquarters currently stationed?" Tan replied: "Our headquarters was originally stationed in Fuzhou, but it has now advanced past the Zhang River." (Q) "Which divisions of the Communist army are more numerous and what is their strength?" (A) "The bandit army has more of Zhu De's and Peng Dehuai's divisions, but most of them have guns but no bullets. Mao Zedong, He Long, and other divisions have less than 10,000 people." (Q) "What is the truth about the murder of Division Commander Zhang Huizan?" (A) "The details have been seen in various newspapers. Division Commander Zhang fought against the enemy with few troops, and was unfortunately murdered because reinforcements did not arrive. But his unyielding spirit is truly commendable." (Q) "Where are the Communist troops currently stationed?" (A) "The Communist troops were originally stationed in the mountains of Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and other provinces. Now, because of the painful suppression by the National Army, they have all fled to the border between Fujian and Jiangxi. Recently, the bandits in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have been wiped out. Upon receiving a telegram from Jiangxi, our headquarters will advance to Pingxiang within days. The transportation of the border between Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi is no longer a problem." (Q) "When will your army launch a general attack on the bandits?" (A) "We are waiting for Sun Zhonglian's army to gather in Jiangxi, so the Communist army can be quelled soon." (Q) "When will the Division Commander leave Shanghai to return to Jiangxi?" (A) "Tonight (the 4th), I will take the night train to Beijing and go to the front line immediately." At this point, the Tao residence had already set the table, so everyone took their seats and dispersed at 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Remains Unwavering in its Policy of Prohibiting Dog Racing</h3>
<p>▲ Changing to a Member-Only Racing Format Unlikely to Succeed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) has ordered the Shen Yuan and Ming Yuan to cease dog racing by the end of this month. The dog racing association, unwilling to accept this, has decided to switch to a member-only racing format, restricting entry to members only, effectively maintaining dog racing gambling in disguise as a club. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper specifically visited Fessenden, Director-General of the SMC, to inquire about the SMC's stance on this matter. Fessenden told the reporter that he had only seen such news in the newspapers and that it was natural for the dog racing association to contemplate other actions. However, there had been no formal contact between the association and the SMC. What remains certain is that the closure of the dog racing track on the 31st of this month has already been decided upon by the SMC Board of Directors. He can only execute the Board's ban as scheduled. He believes that the SMC will not change its policy of prohibiting dog racing, and that the idea of maintaining member-only dog racing by establishing an association is unlikely to succeed. In the past, there were those who used clubs as a guise to open roulette gambling establishments, which the SMC also cracked down on. Moreover, the British government and the British authorities here all oppose dog racing.</p>
<p>The Ming Yuan Dog Racing Association will hold a special shareholders' meeting at the Thomson &amp; Co. tomorrow afternoon to unanimously decide to change the dog racing to member-only racing. Only members will be allowed to enter the venue to bet, and non-members will not be allowed into the park, so as to avoid being subject to the SMC's ban. Dog racing will continue as usual after the end of this month. In addition, it was also decided to elect three shareholder representatives to facilitate communication with the Board of Directors whenever necessary to solicit shareholder opinions. According to General Manager McBain, most of the association's shareholders are Westerners.</p>

<h3>The Fur Industry Association Petitioned the Municipal Authorities Yesterday</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Fur Industry Association, regarding the request to reduce the business tax, specially dispatched representatives Jiang Zhigang, Mao Fengzhi, and others to petition the Municipal Government Finance Bureau. They first went to the Municipal Government, where Secretary Guo received them, saying that Mayor Yu and Secretary-General were in a meeting and could not receive them, for which he apologized. After the representatives stated their intentions, Secretary Guo replied that the business tax in the city was being carefully considered and that he would convey this to the Mayor. They then went to the Finance Bureau, where Secretary Hu of the bureau received them. The representatives said that the fur industry is an important item to resist foreign wool fabrics and is necessary for people in the north to keep warm in winter. They requested that the business tax rate be reduced. Secretary Hu replied that the business tax in the city was being carefully considered, and that merchants' opinions should be accepted as much as possible. Therefore, the Preparatory Office has invited representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to participate in the discussion, and it will never be as exploitative as in the warlord era. As for your association's submission, it will be forwarded to the director and the preparatory office, so you can rest assured. The result was very satisfactory. The main points of the petition are recorded as follows: Fur is a special product of our country and is made by our own people, and the investors are also our own people. According to the national goods standards stipulated by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, it belongs to the first-class national goods. In recent years, the mechanized wool fabrics and other items imported from foreign countries have increased year by year and flooded the market. In order to promote the development of national products, the association's members have not hesitated to sell at a loss to effectively resist them. Although they feel exhausted, they have not yet been able to completely eliminate the invasion. However, they have been able to recover a small amount of outflow. If the tax rate is heavily levied now, it will give foreign goods a chance to sell well, and it will turn around and make this only national product face the danger of decline. This is for the sake of cultivating production in the country, and the tax rate should be reduced as much as possible. Fur is made by hard labor. In the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang alone, the number of fur-making laborers is no less than hundreds of thousands. In the production areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Liaoning, Jilin, and Sichuan, every family raises livestock and everyone makes fur to make a living. The number of laborers is a hundred times that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. If the tax rate is slightly excessive, sales will inevitably stagnate. Directly, it will be enough to sicken merchants. Indirectly, it will put the fur industry into bankruptcy and lead the fur-making workers to death. This is for the sake of maintaining the livelihood of domestic civilians, and the tax rate should be reduced as much as possible. Of the four basic needs of people's livelihood, clothing is the most important. Fur is the main raw material for clothing and is by no means comparable to luxury goods. The north is bitterly cold, and whether rich or poor, old or young, everyone must have a fur coat. When our National Army launched the Northern Expedition last year, from the commander to the soldiers, everyone made fur clothing as a means of keeping warm. This is a clear example. Although the climate in the south is milder, the severe winter and cold also require fur to keep warm. This fur is a necessity for the general public and is related to the economy of the general public. Once the tax rate is heavily levied, it will inevitably increase the price of goods. The rich may be able to support themselves, but how can the poor bear it? According to the general practice of tax regulations, the tax rate should be reduced for goods that are necessary for the people in order to facilitate circulation. This should be reduced as much as possible.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Abolition of the Rice License Tax in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>▲ And Severely Punish the Illegal Conduct of the Collection Director</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that the Rice License Tax Bureau in Anhui Province defied the law and shot at petitioning representatives, resulting in a major turmoil. Yesterday, they telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to request that Anhui Province be ordered to abolish the rice license tax and severely punish the illegal conduct of the collection director. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on March 4th, the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce and 36 trade associations telegraphed that the Anhui rice license tax defies orders to collect taxes. Recently, thousands of ships have been detained in the Huai River area. More than a thousand merchants in Huaiyuan have been on the verge of starvation in winter. They went to the collection office to petition and were ordered by the director Zong Xiansan and Zhan Xinpei to be shot at by guards, seriously injuring two people. The public was indignant and the whole city was shocked. In addition to directly complaining, we hereby telegraph again to uphold justice and provide assistance." Upon approval, it was found that after the Anhui rice license tax was approved to abolish the likin tax, the Ministry repeatedly ordered its abolition. The province should obey the order to abolish it to relieve the people's difficulties. Now, the director of the rice license tax collection office disregards the government's orders and the people's difficulties and dares to order guards to shoot at petitioning merchants, resulting in traffic disruption and market turmoil. If it is not strictly prohibited and dealt with according to the law, where is the law of the country, and how can the suffering of the merchants be alleviated? It is reasonable to report the situation by telegram and request your review and prompt order to the Anhui Provincial Government to abolish the rice license tax and severely punish the director of the collection office who illegally shot at the petitioning merchants according to law, and not to delay any longer. We are deeply grateful. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows.</p>
<h3>The Tax Committee of Various Industries Assists the Bengbu Shooting Injury Petition Representatives</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Central Government to Severely Punish the Disturbers</p>
<p>▲ Condolences to the Injured Petition Representatives</p>
<p>The Tax Committee of Various Industries of this city, regarding the illegal collection of rice license tax in Bengbu and the shooting injury of petition representatives, telegraphed the National Government and chambers of commerce across the country yesterday to request that the rice license tax be abolished and the disturbers be severely punished. The original telegram is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲ To the National Government: National Government, upon your review, it is reported that Bengbu collected rice tax and merchants went to the collection office to petition and the director Zong Xiansan, etc., ordered guards to open fire and seriously injure several people, and countless were slightly injured, and traffic was interrupted, and the entire city went on strike, etc. Upon reading it, the public was indignant. Anhui Province's rice license tax is a harsh collection in defiance of orders, and it has been repeatedly ordered by the Central Government to be abolished. Not only did the province fail to comply, but it intensified and forced the collection, disregarding the law and severely disturbing the people, far more than the likin tax. The merchants thought that they were under this revolutionary government, and it was not as unreasonable as the warlord era. They could only bow their heads and obey and be slaughtered. Therefore, they gathered to the collection office to petition. If the directors of the office were slightly humane, they should have comforted and adopted them. Unexpectedly, they ordered guards to open fire on the unarmed petitioning merchants, making the old trick of warlords oppressing the people repeat under the clear sky. It is really infuriating to hear. The association's sixth committee meeting resolved to telegraph the Central Government to order Anhui Province to abolish the harsh rice license tax immediately and severely punish the disturbers at that time to maintain the law and quell the public's anger. The telegram is overwhelmed and awaits orders. The Tax Committee of Various Industries Associations in Shanghai kowtows.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Chambers of Commerce across the Country: To Chambers of Commerce in Various Provinces, Cities, and Towns, it is reported that Bengbu collected rice tax and merchants went to the collection office to petition. The director Zong Xiansan, etc., ordered guards to open fire and injure countless people. Hearing this, all the hearts were burning. After the Central Government ordered the abolition of the likin tax, various places complied one after another. However, Anhui Province acted on its own and resisted the order to collect the tax. The rice license tax was particularly harsh. Because of their livelihood, the merchants gathered to the collection office to petition. The directors of the office not only did not adopt them first but also shot at them later. How can this be tolerated? Where is justice? Therefore, the sixth committee meeting of our association resolved to submit to the Central Government and immediately order Anhui Province to abolish the rice tax and severely punish the disturbers, and to telegraph various places to provide unanimous assistance to maintain justice. Besides submitting separately, we telegraph to reach you and ask you to provide unanimous support to maintain justice. We cannot but pray for this. The Tax Research Committee of Various Industries Associations in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Injured Petition Representatives: To Bengbu Chamber of Commerce and the Injured Petition Representatives, Wang Changfa and other gentlemen, it is reported that you and others went to petition because Anhui Province's harsh rice tax was unbearable for merchants and were shot at, which is infuriating to hear. Heaven's law will not perish, and justice will exist in vain. The human heart has not died, and justice can be promoted. In addition to presenting it to the Central Government and ordering the Provincial Government to abolish the rice tax and severely punish the disturbers, and to telegraph various places to support it unanimously, we hereby send a telegram of condolences and pray for your speedy recovery. The Tax Research Committee of Various Industries Associations in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Record of Baoshan County Political Conference</h3>

The resolution was that the literacy movement events to be held by the government agencies will be held in April according to regulations. Because of the large-scale holding of the Public Education Hall and the opening of the public schools immediately after the holding, the government agencies should hold the literacy movement in advance to join the public Education Hall.

<h3>Take Measures to Relieve the Domestic Closed Factories</h3>
<p>▲ The Department Orders the County Government to Investigate and Report</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department yesterday, which read: "In order to comply with the order, the Ministry of Industry ordered that there are many state-owned and private factories in our country that have been closed for a long time and have not yet been restored, or have been temporarily suspended for some reason, or are about to be closed. The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce had formulated a factory bankruptcy investigation form and distributed it for investigation. However, most of the local government offices regarded it as a mere formality, and only a few reported it. If personnel were selected to conduct investigations in different ways, the cost would be too high. Therefore, the reasons for the closure of factories in various places, the past situation, and the current situation have not been investigated so far, so as to consider planning, re-negotiate recovery, or take measures to relieve them. Now the scope of the investigation is stipulated as the following ten items: (1) Factory name, (2) Place name, (3) Factory nature, (4) Production type and quantity, (5) Reason and year of bankruptcy or shutdown, (6) Past situation, (7) Current situation, (8) Original capital and amount of loss, (9) Existing capital and amount of output, (10) Recovery method and amount of funds needed. During the investigation, if the above scope is incomplete, it can be changed and added. Be sure to be thorough. In addition to separate orders, the department hereby orders the county magistrate to comply with the order and report it for transfer, and orders each county government and commercial group to conduct detailed investigations separately, summarize and submit them for review and processing. The decree is as follows.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Approves the Proposal to Increase the Cigarette Tax to Provide Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce had previously proposed to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to increase the cigarette tax rate to be used for disaster relief in various provinces, as the disaster situation was extremely serious. However, because more than two months had passed, no approval was received. On the horse day of last month, it continued to request review and processing. The Ministry of Industry has now issued an approval, stating, "I have read the telegram from Mr. Ma. This case was previously approved by the Disaster Relief Committee to jointly discuss the implementation measures with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance, and the opinions of the Ministry of Finance have already been consulted. Based on the previous situation, the Ministry of Finance has been consulted again for review and processing. Please be informed." This batch.</p>
<h3>Autopsy Case of Zhang Wenyi</h3>
<p>▲ The deceased's father weeps bitterly</p>
<p>▲ Demanding Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>Following the death of Zhang Wenyi, the garrison battalion commander of Wusong Fortress, and the unauthorized autopsy performed on his body by Baolong Hospital, Zhang's remains have been transported back to the fortress and placed in a coffin the day before yesterday. During the coffin placement, the deceased's father, Zhang Dagang, caressed the body and wept uncontrollably. Commander Deng offered extensive comfort before he calmed down. Zhang Dagang also requested Commander Deng's assistance in a serious negotiation with the hospital director, stating that his deceased son, Wenyi, was accompanied by his younger brother, Wenyu, and brother-in-law, Wang Wumu, from the time he entered the hospital until his death, without leaving his side. However, according to the written report of the hospital director, Dr. Bode (transliteration), Wenyu and Wumu were asked, as attendants, whether the patient's family had any similar illnesses, to which they replied that he had no parents, wife, or other family members. He claimed that he had repeatedly asked, and they had given the same answer each time. Based on these statements, the hospital's attempt to conceal the facts is self-defeating, as the deceased's parents are clearly alive, and he has four brothers. There is no reason for the younger brother to claim that there are no parents or family members. Furthermore, according to Dr. Bode's intentions, the autopsy was performed because there were no family members, but the consent of the family should have been sought before the autopsy. The reason for this is very clear. Realizing his mistake, he fabricated the fact that there were no family members, which is even more absurd. Even assuming that there were no relatives, the fortress battalion commander was escorted to the hospital when he was ill, and the fortress commander should have been consulted before performing an autopsy after his death. Moreover, Dr. Bode claims to be complying with Chinese law, but it is unknown under what Chinese law he can perform an autopsy without the permission of the family. In conclusion, it is difficult to endure such cruelty and inhumanity from the hospital, and he vowed to engage in serious negotiations with the hospital to comfort the deceased. He spoke with tears in his voice, and Commander Deng promised to find a way.</p>
<h3>Public Letter from the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for the Shaanxi Disaster yesterday sent letters to leaders from all walks of life in the city, inviting them to serve as executive committee members and fundraising committee members. The letter read: "Respected Sir/Madam, the disaster in Shaanxi is of great magnitude, unprecedented in ancient times.

<h3>Request for Relief from the Horrors of Banditry in Huoshan</h3>
<p>▲ Report Received by the Red Cross</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross received a letter from Sun Yuhang and fourteen other members of the Huoshan County Disaster Relief Committee in Anhui, stating that Huoshan County is located in the western border of Anhui Province, bordering Hubei and Henan, with barren land and impoverished people. In the past two years, the county has suffered from the ravages of bandits and communists, and the people are in dire straits. In the winter of the eighteenth year (of the Republic), communist bandits secretly spread throughout the villages and carried out assassinations. For seven months, they trampled on one to two hundred li in the southwest. In the nineteenth year, from spring to summer, they invaded the county seat twice, spreading red terror everywhere and causing unrest throughout the county. They committed adultery, arson, and murder, stopping at nothing. It is estimated that 15,000 homes were burned, 50,000 people were killed, and all 220,000 people in the county were looted, with no one spared. Industry and agriculture have ceased, production has been cut off, merchants have closed their shops, and the economy is in dire straits. The old and weak fill the ditches, dying without a place to be buried, while the able-bodied scatter in all directions, only to be killed upon their return. In this time of wind, snow, and bloodshed, the fierce and cruel communist bandits still stubbornly resist in the northwest, and the entire territory has not been cleared, leaving the people in dire straits. Alas, our disaster-stricken people suffer such torment that even exchanging children and eating their flesh is not enough to prolong their lives. The heartbreaking and tragic sight is unprecedented. All industries have ceased, and the spark of life has been extinguished. Without rescue, there will be no survivors. Therefore, we painstakingly recount the disaster situation and appeal to your esteemed association to consider our suffering, approve a large grant for relief, send personnel to distribute it, save the dying from disaster, and prolong life by a thread. The people of the entire county will be grateful beyond words.</p>

<h3>Shipping Companies Raise Freight Rates</h3>
<p>▲ Northern Shipping Companies Discuss Raising Freight Rates</p>
<p>With the thawing of the Baihe River, navigation is now possible along the northern route. Shanghai's Chinese shipping companies are resuming operations. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, China Merchants and other companies have decided that due to the recent surge in gold prices and the soaring prices of various supplies for ships, it is difficult to maintain operations without raising freight rates. As a result of the meeting, it was decided that starting from the 16th of this month, the shallow water fees added last winter would be cancelled, and from that day on, the freight rates for exported goods would be increased by 20% across the board. For example, flour will increase from 3 qian to 3.6 qian per bag, white rice will increase from 3.8 qian to 4.5 qian per package, paper will increase from 10.5 taels to 12.2 taels per ton, cotton cloth will increase from 14.37 taels to 17.24 taels per ton, and sundries will increase to 13.36 taels (originally set at 11.13 taels). The new freight rates are currently being drafted.</p>
<p>▲ Haizhou Discusses Increasing Transportation Rates</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Longhai Railway, the shipping industry on the Shanghai to Haizhou route has seen a slight improvement due to the transport of goods by land. Currently, there are six shipping companies operating on the Haizhou route in Shanghai, including Dazhen. Recently, due to the sharp rise in the price of metals, the price of steel plates has increased by 20 taels per ton since March 1st. Other employee salaries also need to be increased. Therefore, shipping companies on the Haizhou route are discussing increasing freight rates, generally increasing them by at least 10% according to the fixed rate. New prices are currently being drafted.</p>

<p>The "Complete Book on Local Self-Government" is the latest work by expert Wu Gengxin. Mr. Wu has guided the self-government of Huaiyang in Jiangsu, investigated self-government in Jiangsu Province, and inspected self-government in Shanxi. Last autumn, he was sent to Japan by the Ministry of Interior of the National Government to study municipal administration. He returned to China last spring and was hired by Hu Pu'an, Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, as a full-time professor of local self-government at the Jiangsu District Chiefs Training Class. The Shanghai Local Self-Government Training Institute also continued to hire him as a full-time professor of municipal administration. Recently, he compiled a comprehensive "Complete Book on Local Self-Government" based on his experience in handling self-government for more than ten years, as well as his recent inspections and teaching experiences. The content is divided into two major sections: the system of self-government and the implementation of the system of self-government. The system of self-government is further divided into three sections: (1) the current local system, (2) laws and regulations related to local self-government, and (3) an overview of local self-government systems in various countries. The current local self-government system includes the latest County Organization Law, County Organization Law Implementation Regulations, District Self-Government Implementation Regulations, Township Self-Government Implementation Regulations, Township and Neighborhood Self-Government Official Election and Recall Law, and Municipal Organization Law, with various interpretations.

Finally, it includes the "Record of Field Observation of Self-Government Administration in Shanxi Province" and the "Record of Municipal Administration Inspection in Kunming, Yunnan." All aspects related to local self-government laws, regulations, and theories are comprehensively collected. It can be described as a compilation of the great achievements of local self-government. The entire book contains more than 400,000 words and is truly an unprecedented masterpiece. The cover is inscribed by Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan. Many inscriptions and prefaces were written by Liu Shangqing and Zhang Wohua, Ministers of Interior, Niu Tingsheng, Minister of Personnel, Sun Zhesheng, a member of the Central Standing Committee, Ye Chucang, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, as well as domestic political and legal experts.

<h3>Coal Briquette Factory Workers Request Assistance</h3>
<p>▲ Social Affairs Bureau Orders Factory to Report Reasons for Suspension of Work</p>
<p>Ma Liansheng and other workers from the Sanyi Coal Briquette Factory on Bansongyuan Road submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance because the factory announced the suspension of work on February 15th, citing the end of the lunar year as the reason. It has been a long time since then, and there is still no date for the resumption of work. Furthermore, the factory stopped providing meals to the workers on the 22nd, leaving them with no choice. The Bureau sent personnel to investigate, but the factory manager, Zhang Xunzhi, evaded the issue by claiming to have gone to another port, providing no concrete response, making it impossible to conduct an investigation. Yesterday, the Bureau issued an order to the factory, stating: "In response to the petition from factory workers such as Ma Liansheng, stating that the factory has no fixed date for resuming work and that the workers' livelihoods have been cut off, requesting relief, we hereby order you to provide detailed reasons for the factory's delay in resuming work within three days of receiving this document, so that we may verify the situation.

<p>The Inevitable Death Theory of Tuberculosis and New Therapies for Lung Diseases, Copied from the National Tuberculosis Magazine</p>
<p>(1) The Origin of the Inevitable Death Theory of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Although there are many diseases that circulate, none are as difficult to treat or as widespread as tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis). Tuberculosis attacks us without interruption, regardless of time or place. It is the most harmful and deadly infectious disease. Since ancient times,</p>
<p>it has been determined that tuberculosis is an inevitably fatal disease. Indeed, it is difficult to cure once contracted. Therefore, doctors are helpless when they encounter it, and patients are alarmed and apprehensive, fearing for their lives. However, in modern times, medicine has advanced, and famous doctors have emerged. Through careful research, it has been discovered that tuberculosis is not necessarily a terminal illness. If treated properly, 80-90% of cases can be cured in the early stages, and even those in the second or third stages have a chance of recovery. However, there is no cure for patients who have been ill for too long and have reached the final stages. However, the inability to cure diseases that have been contracted for too long is not unique to tuberculosis. Those who contract this disease should not forget to seek treatment in the early and middle stages.</p>
<p>The ancient "Tuberculosis is Inevitably Fatal" theory is deeply ingrained in people's minds. Therefore, anyone suffering from lung disease who hears a doctor's diagnosis of tuberculosis feels as if they have been sentenced to death. They are demoralized and live in fear, ignoring all treatments. Even if knowledgeable people consider it, they do not know what kind of health regimen or treatment to pursue. Families do not know how to care for and protect patients, so diseases that could be cured cannot be cured, and family members who could avoid infection are infected. The poison of lung disease is becoming increasingly prevalent. Its widespread prevalence, from small families and villages to large countries, is a great tragedy of life.</p>
<h3>(2) The Discovery of the Tuberculosis Germ</h3>
<p>Since ancient times, Chinese and Western medical circles have had many empty and unclear theories about the causative agent of tuberculosis. Recently, the great German bacteriologist Dr. Koch discovered that the tubercle bacillus is the cause of tuberculosis, breaking through this ancient darkness and illuminating a great light. It is widely known that the Vibrio cholerae is the cause of cholera, the Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the cause of diphtheria, and the Shigella dysenteriae is the cause of dysentery. Similarly, syphilis is caused by the Treponema pallidum, and leprosy is caused by the Mycobacterium leprae. Likewise, tuberculosis is caused by the tubercle bacillus. This bacterium is most fond of attacking humans, and it mainly resides and reproduces in our lungs. The number of people harmed by it is countless. In the past, it accounted for one-seventh of the world's population, and in modern times, it accounts for one-sixth. In cities, it accounts for one-fifth. It is the most widespread infectious disease.</p>
<h3>(3) The Two Great Benefactors of Lung Disease Sufferers</h3>
<p>(1) Dr. Robert Koch of Germany was born in 1843 in the city of Claus, Germany. His family was well-off, so he was able to focus on his studies from a young age. After graduating from middle school, he attended various universities in the country, studying medicine. Before the age of thirty, he discovered the bacterium of anthrax, impressing the country's famous doctors. Several years later, on March 24, 1882, Dr. Koch presented his research and discovery of the tubercle bacillus at the Berlin Physiological Society in Germany. The medical community in various countries was shaken by this. The German government praised his scholarship and appointed Dr. Koch as the director of the Institute of Hygiene. Emperors of various countries also awarded him high honors, and universities around the world competed to offer him honorary degrees. In 1905, Koch also received the Nobel Prize in Medicine. He can be said to have achieved the highest honor in the academic world. Today, the treatment of tuberculosis is based on Koch's discovery. His contribution to saving lives and helping the world is truly something that the people of the world should be grateful for.</p>
<p>(2) Dr. Bergell of Germany Since Dr. Koch discovered that the tubercle bacillus is the causative agent of tuberculosis, scholars of tuberculosis from the East and West have competed to conduct research, hoping to find a wonderful way to kill this bacterium. However, their results have all ended in failure. This is because, in the past, doctors generally did not understand the unique structure of the tubercle bacillus. After Dr. Bergell's painstaking research, he discovered that the tubercle bacillus has a special defense that can resist all external attacks. The tubercle bacillus is composed of an inner membrane of neutral fat and an outer membrane of acid-fast wax. Unless a way is found to destroy its waxy defense line and disarm its fatty armament, there is no way to capture the tubercle bacillus and put it to death. Therefore, Dr. Bergell, the great teacher of all lung disease sufferers in the world, collected all kinds of substances of animal, vegetable, and mineral origin and conducted painstaking research for decades, exhausting his brainpower and shedding his heart's blood. Recently, he finally discovered that there is a special component in the compressed juice of the intestinal mesenteric glands of certain animals that has a strong dewaxing effect on the tubercle bacillus. This is truly a great success in the fundamental treatment of tuberculosis, a major question for the medical community throughout the ages.</p>
<h3>Lung Intravenous and Tracheobronchial Distribution Map Made by Dr. Natter of Germany</h3>
<p>(4) Special Efficacy Therapy for Tuberculosis Figure 81</p>
<p>The cause of tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis) is the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the body, it forms nodules at that location, blocking the flow of blood. The tubercle bacillus can also secrete an acid-fast waxy substance that surrounds its body to prevent the invasion of external medicinal forces. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they cannot reach the substance of the pathogenic bacteria. The natural therapies, symptomatic therapies, physical therapies, serum injection therapies, drug therapies, and all other treatments that doctors have traditionally used have not been completely successful, and the saying that there is no cure for lung disease has spread throughout the world because they did not know this profound theory. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the above-mentioned theory, continue to research with all their might. As a result, they have created a chemical miracle drug that kills all tuberculosis bacteria, called Sanosin. This drug was invented based on the latest medical theories of Dr. Robert Koch of Germany, the inventor of the tubercle bacillus, and Dr. Bergell of Germany, the inventor of tubercle bacillus dewaxing. According to the experimental reports of various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating tuberculosis nodules and dissolving wax, and also has bactericidal power. It can fundamentally cure tuberculosis in the first, second, and third stages and has a proven effect. In China, it has been tested by the Central Health Laboratory of the National Government, and its medicinal properties are mild and non-toxic, with no side effects. The medicinal effects are briefly listed below.</p>
<p>(1) When the medicinal power of (Sanosin) is applied in a test tube, the acid-fastness of all tubercle bacilli disappears after one minute. After three minutes, the tubercle bacilli are completely killed, with none spared.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments have found that (Sanosin) can penetrate into tuberculosis lesions. An examination of the tubercle bacilli lurking within the lesions reveals that they have lost their acid-fastness. This proves that their waxy substance has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If patients take (Sanosin) internally for about a week, they will immediately see a thinning of phlegm and a drop in body temperature, indicating a good condition.</p>
<p>(4) If they continue to take (Sanosin) internally for more than 30 to 60 days, they will see a significant increase in weight, increased appetite, and a gradual alleviation of all symptoms, eventually achieving the great effect of bringing them back to life.</p>

<h3>Bandit Discharges Electric Gun, Yellow Smoke Everywhere</h3>
<p>▲ Numerous Detectives Cover Mouths and Noses</p>
<p>▲ Seven Robbers Bravely Captured</p>
<p>Lu Ying, captain of the City Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, noting the recent string of robbery cases where most offenders wear Western suits and dress smartly to avoid detective scrutiny, specifically ordered the entire bureau to pay attention. Around 6 PM last night, squad leader Qiu Haitian, along with detectives Li Xiaobao, Zhou Peisan, Wang Yueling, Wu Kezhong, Chen Caifu, Miao Jinhai, Zhang Guangsen, Liu Yongfu, Zhang Xinlong, Ling Tianpeng, Zhang Guixin, Wang Zi'an, and others, were inspecting pedestrians near the intersection of Xiaobeimen and the French Concession. Suddenly, they noticed three individuals in Western suits and several youths in various long gowns standing at a street corner near the entrance of Yongqing Lane, whispering among themselves, their behavior highly suspicious. The detectives paid close attention. Before long, the youths indeed entered the lane and waited behind the back door on the left side of a certain house number. The squad leader then led the detectives in a rush. Just as they were about to step forward for inspection, one of the men in Western suits suddenly produced an electric gun and fired at the detectives, emitting yellow smoke that sounded like thunder. The detectives quickly covered their mouths and noses while drawing their guns to warn them, but fearing they might injure innocent bystanders, they refrained from firing back. However, the robbers were already panicked and unable to resist, and raised their hands in surrender, one by one. A total of seven people were captured, and a brand-new Mauser pistol with live ammunition was found on one of the robbers. Several dozen reactionary leaflets with slogans from the "February 25th" International Unemployed Workers Movement Day were found on another. They were immediately taken to the team, where Captain Lu personally interrogated them. The seven men, identified as Pu Maodong, Shi Yincai, Han Yafu, Lu Wenkui, Chen Huafu, You Wumei, and Wang Yaoting, confessed to intending to rob a certain resident in the area. The robbers also revealed the location where their accomplices were hiding. The officers then went to No. 24 Xujiazhai in the east of Hongzhen and arrested Qiu Caifu, and at No. 822 Yong'an Lane in the Hudong area, they arrested Xu Genfu. Subsequently, they coordinated with the French police to search Pu Maodong's home at No. 36 Xicheng Lane on Ximen Road, seizing various types of reactionary printed materials. After Captain Lu questioned them, he immediately reported to the bureau chief, awaiting further instructions.</p>
<h3>China Wata Tobacco Company's Boiler Room Steam Pot Explodes, Injuring People</h3>
<p>▲ Factory Building Slightly Damaged</p>
<p>▲ Work Continues as Usual Yesterday</p>
<p>In the boiler room of the China Wata Tobacco Company at No. 75 Jingzhou Road, a water tank exploded yesterday morning, injuring nine workers and one woman, who were all sent to the hospital for treatment. Except for two minor workers, the others were unharmed. Four others were slightly bandaged and discharged from the hospital. The walls and roof of the boiler room were damaged by the explosion, but work continued as usual in the factory yesterday, except for a small section.</p>
<p>▲ Water Tank Explosion The company's machinery and equipment are known to be sophisticated. The boiler room, built on the ground, has two boilers, large and small, dedicated to heating the water tank and used to bake tobacco leaves. The exploded boiler was a small one. It was around 6:30 AM, and because work had not yet started, only a few minor workers were affected. The cause of the explosion is unknown. It is said that the person who started the fire was a substitute worker. The boiler originally had a pressure of 75 pounds, but at the time of the explosion, it was said to be only 40 pounds. The loss was relatively small.</p>
<p>▲ Roof Flies Off Because the boiler room was located on the ground, after the steam pot exploded, the lead sheet on the roof, which was light in weight, was propelled into the air by the steam force and landed on the home of Feng Bai at No. 58 Chunping Lane, Daliangwan Road, Huade Road, several hundred yards away. Bai was injured and sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>▲ Workers Affected When the steam pot exploded, many minor workers in the boiler room were washing nearby, and they were unable to avoid it in time. Nine people were injured, the most seriously injured being Li Ayue, who started the fire and was a substitute worker, and He Yuanchang, a minor worker who was injured in the head and face. The others, such as Hu Laigui, Zheng Rongfu, Lin Awei, Wang Yixing, Fang Amao, Ren Alin, Shi Hesheng, and others, sustained varying degrees of injury but were mostly unharmed. The latter four, who were less severely injured, were slightly bandaged and discharged from the hospital. All the injured were sent to Tongren Hospital by the fire department's ambulance.</p>
<h3>Gaochang Temple Opera Troupe Conflict Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Shaokuan Says Further Investigation Needed</p>
<p>▲ Tram Workers Reiterate Conditions</p>
<p>A conflict between Huashang Tram Company workers and naval aircraft factory artisans, which affected workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard, led to a labor dispute at the shipyard. All parties injured have independently sought medical treatment at hospitals. There has been no change in the condition of those injured and hospitalized yesterday. As for the negotiations, Chen Shaokuan, the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning to discuss the matter. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Shipyard Perspective Since Chen Shaokuan's arrival in Shanghai yesterday morning, he stated to others, "We have received a letter from Huashang regarding the conflict. However, while the dispute occurred in the morning, the other party could have reported it. It was not until the evening, when a major incident occurred, that we learned it had escalated. The next day, a letter was sent requesting [something], and transportation was immediately shortened. This approach by the company is highly inappropriate. The insult and abuse of shipyard workers are especially unexpected. Imagine if shipyard workers retaliated in kind against tram workers; what would become of the situation? In short, the incident has already happened. We ultimately hope to resolve it from a major issue to a minor one, and from a minor one to nothing. As for where the fault lies and who started the trouble, I will have a say once I have investigated and understood the matter."</p>
<p>▲ Tram Company Perspective The Tram Company, after mediation by Mayor Zhang and Huang Boqiao of the Public Utilities Bureau the previous evening, intended to first order workers to resume transportation on the Gaochang Temple to South Railway Station section. After consultation, a written response was given to the four demands submitted by the union during the day, hoping that workers would resume work yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, after the reply was sent, the workers considered it unsatisfactory. Therefore, an emergency branch meeting was convened yesterday morning, resolving to continue pursuing three additional demands from the company. If a satisfactory response is not received within two days (i.e., yesterday and today), the dispute will be expanded. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Song Zengchou (Zi Shao Yi), the Tram Company's director of vehicle operations, personally visited Huang Boqiao at the Public Utilities Bureau to discuss everything. Returning at 4 PM, when asked about the results by reporters, he replied that the company would do its utmost to address what it could, but some of the workers' demands were difficult to meet. The discussion with Director Huang today still yielded no solution. Moreover, the company felt that what was acceptable to the union was unacceptable to the company. The company also advocated resuming service first.</p>
<p>▲ Tram Union Perspective After the tram workers sent a letter to the company demanding punishment of the perpetrators, an apology, guarantees, and compensation, the company replied that it would address the first three items as best as it could and seriously negotiate with the other party. Regarding compensation, it would be generous, even if no life-threatening danger had occurred, and would agree to compensate for losses. However, the union, upon receiving the letter, found the wording vague and unsatisfactory. Therefore, at 10 AM yesterday morning, an emergency meeting of the sixth, seventh, and eighth branches was convened, attended by over one hundred people. The meeting proceeded as planned, chaired by Zhu Hanhong, a standing committee member. As a result of the meeting, the previous letter was deemed unsatisfactory, and three preliminary conditions were added: (1) The company must order the other party to hand over Zhang Likang, the main culprit in the assault, to the local court for severe punishment. (2) The other party must formally issue a written apology and publish it in the newspaper. (3) Concrete guarantees must be provided to prevent similar incidents from happening again, and a full response must be provided within two days (the 5th and 6th). As for the resumption of service, it can only be implemented after the company has provided a satisfactory response. At 10 AM, a declaration was issued and posted on all vehicles.</p>
<p>▲ Jiangnan Shipyard Union Perspective Someone met with Zhu Xiangkui, a standing committee member of the Shipyard Union, in the afternoon. According to Zhu, he had visited Director Chen today to report everything. Chen agreed to seek a solution through negotiation, but requested that all workers abide by order and not engage in activities outside the norm, which would create difficulties. The expenses for Li Shuxing's injuries should be generously allocated to ensure his family's well-being. Therefore, the union is currently awaiting a resolution and has only issued a declaration, notifying all workers to wait quietly for a resolution.</p>
<h3>Arm of Child Chopped Off With Knife</h3>
<p>▲ Believed Would Not Be Reincarnated</p>
<p>▲ Cruel and Inhumane Act</p>
<p>Gao Xuejin, a man from Jiangbei who lives behind the Laobaidu police station in Pudong, married his wife and had five sons, all of whom died within a few months of birth. The day before yesterday, his last son died from a recent seasonal illness. Gao, swayed by superstition, believed that this son was still the same debt-collector from before, coming to collect debts. Therefore, he chopped off one of the child's arms with a knife, thinking that if the child suffered pain, he would not be reincarnated into his family in the future. A patrolling policeman happened to witness this and, considering it an act of destroying a corpse and being cruel and inhumane, immediately arrested Gao Xuejin and sent him to the First Precinct of the Third District to be forwarded to the Public Security Bureau and then to the local court for trial.</p>
<h3>Death Sentence for Two Main Culprits in Lu Shaotang Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>▲ Hu and Liu Receive Life Sentences</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang, a Suzhou native and compradore for the Pacific Trading Company, residing at No. 235 Jiujiang Road, was kidnapped on December 18th last year at 6 PM. Leaving a real estate company on Shanxi Road and riding home in his own car, he saw a slow-moving motorcycle blocking his way at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Jiujiang Road. Several kidnappers jumped out from the roadside and blocked the road, audaciously opening fire and killing the bodyguard, a Russian named Dadu. They then kidnapped Lu and hid him in a bandit den at No. 374 Hede Road, intending to extort a large sum of money. Subsequently, Chief Detective Lu Liankui, Detective Tang Jian, Liu Shaokui, and Detective Feng Zhiming of the General Police Station discovered the bandit den, rescued Lu, and successively arrested dozens of suspects, including Wang Sanhuai and Tian Changshan. The Special District Local Court repeatedly held trials and concluded the proceedings, awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, the time for sentencing arrived. The lawyers for the defendants Yang Haisong, Wu Linkun, Li Zhengtang, Zhan Jifeng, and Wang Zhilang, Fan Gang, all arrived in court to await the verdict. At 9:30 AM, Zhou Hanjun, the presiding judge of the criminal court, ascended the bench and announced the verdict: "The defendants Wang Sanhuai and Tian Changshan, guilty of the crime of jointly kidnapping for ransom, are each sentenced to death. They are also each sentenced to death for the crime of jointly premeditating murder. The death sentences are to be carried out. Hu Mingde and Liu Dianqing, guilty of the crime of jointly kidnapping for ransom, are each sentenced to life imprisonment. Zhang Yunkang, guilty of assisting robbers, is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and guilty of receiving stolen goods, is sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The total sentence to be served is eight years of imprisonment. The remaining charges against the defendants are dismissed. Feng Muqing and Zhang Xianting, guilty of possessing military firearms and ammunition for criminal purposes, are each sentenced to three years of imprisonment. The number of days Zhang Yunkang, Feng Muqing, and Zhang Xianting have spent in custody before the judgment is finalized shall be deducted from their sentences at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment. Qian Shanhai, Feng Wangshi, He Zhishan, Sun Fengzhu, Guan Jinchen, Shuai Wushi, Shuai Jinghua, Shuai Qianshi, Liu Qianshi, Shuai Lei, Wang Zhilang, Li Ligeng, Zhang Qingqi, Shao Erbao, Li Rulin, Zhang Shaonan, Li Sigong, Liu Dianqing, Li Zhengtang, Yang Haisong, Lu Fangting, and Peng Ze are all found not guilty. The automobile with the registration number 1036, the Victory brand motorcycle, one piece each of the false registration plates with numbers 10414 and 10381, five Mauser pistols of various sizes, 147 rounds of Mauser ammunition, another 42 rounds of ammunition, and the house and furnishings at No. 374 Hede Road are all confiscated." Hearing the verdict, the lawyer from the police station immediately stated that the police station would waive the right to appeal regarding all the acquitted defendants. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government wanted to transfer Yang Haisong for trial, and Li Zhengtang and Li Sigong were guilty of another kidnapping case. Feng Wangshi and Wang Zhilang had already been convicted in another case. It was requested that they continue to be detained. Judge Zhou then ruled that Feng Wangshi and Wang Zhilang would continue to be detained due to other pending cases. Yang Haisong would be detained pending the arrival of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to take him into custody for trial. Li Zhengtang and Li Sigong, as requested by the police station, would be prosecuted for another kidnapping case and would be kept in custody. The rest of the acquitted defendants were released.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Counterfeit Money Seized</h3>
<p>▲ Counterfeit 100 Yuan Bills Sold for 10 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Zhu Shaoji Remanded for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Gui Shou, a Chinese detective from the French Concession Police Station, received a tip-off on the evening of the day before yesterday around 9 PM, stating that Zhu Shaoji, a Shaoxing native residing in the rear building of No. 65 North Shanxi Road, was collecting various counterfeit currencies, intending to circulate them in the city. He then went with Western Detective No. 309 to discreetly apprehend Zhu at the address. Inside Zhu's wallet, they found twelve counterfeit ten-yuan bills, two counterfeit five-yuan bills, one genuine five-yuan bill, one torn five-yuan bill, fourteen silver-colored counterfeit dollars, and four copper-colored double-cent coins. These were all taken to the police station. During interrogation, Zhu confessed that Wang, who lived at No. 2 Yanzike, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, had given him the counterfeit money. Chinese and Western detectives then went with the French police to No. 2 Lafayette Road to arrest Wang, but were unsuccessful. However, they found thirty-three twelve-yuan counterfeit bills and forty-three counterfeit five-yuan bills in a box under the bed. These were all brought back to the police station. Zhu was ordered to be detained and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, presented the case and requested a postponement. Zhu Yunsheng, a representative from the bank, also filed a case. Judge Wu Tingqi handed over all the seized counterfeit bills to Zhu for inspection, asking if they were counterfeit. After carefully examining each bill, Zhu replied that they were all counterfeit. Defendant Zhu Shaoji confessed, "Wang gave me these counterfeit bills to sell on his behalf, at a price of ten yuan for every hundred yuan." Judge Wu, after verifying the confession, ordered Zhu to be remanded in custody for further interrogation on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnapped Victims Escape From Bandit Den</h3>
<p>▲ Hair Grown Over a Foot Long</p>
<p>Chen Xinshan and Wu Li, residents of Beikan Town, Juegang, outside Wusongkou, were kidnapped by bandits in July of last year, and their whereabouts were unknown. The two suddenly escaped the day before yesterday. They said that after being kidnapped, they were forced to work as shipmates for eight months. Their clothes were tattered and could not be replaced, and their hair could not be cut and had grown to over a foot long. Their faces were covered in dirt, resembling prisoners about to be executed. This time, we were ordered to deliver more than fifty pirates from the Pan Department from Sanjia Town to Beichaohe Port, and we took the opportunity to escape and ran back by land.</p>
<h3>Method of Registering Sand-Dredging Boats Changed to Cargo Ships</h3>
<p>▲ Municipal Authorities Announce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and Finance Bureau jointly issued a proclamation yesterday, which stated that, regarding the matter of proclamation, the name "sand-dredging boat" has been approved by the Municipal Government for cancellation. All registration, inspection, licensing, and tax payment methods will be handled the same as for cargo ships. It is now determined that the period from March 16th to May 15th will be the registration period for sand-dredging boats to change to cargo ships. The various methods are listed separately as follows: (1) All sand-dredging boats operating in this city should, within the above-mentioned period, go to the Wusong Shipping Office of this Public Utilities Bureau (No. 524 Wusong Wai Ma Road) or the South Shanghai Shipping Office (Dongjiadu Wharf), the Zhabei Shipping Office (under the New Zha Bridge) to re-register according to the cargo ship method, waiting for inspection and approval, paying a deposit fee of silver three yuan per boat, obtaining a license, determining the grade, and paying monthly taxes to the nearby ship tax offices of this Finance Bureau. (2) Those who have registered and paid a registration fee of two yuan at the former Port Authority, if the registration date has not yet reached one year by the time of re-registration at the various shipping offices, will be allowed to deduct the previously paid registration fee of two yuan from the deposit fee to be paid, and then pay an additional one yuan. However, this deposit fee will still be calculated as one yuan when the boat is issued. (3) After May 15th, those who still fail to comply with the above-mentioned methods will be dealt with according to the temporary penalty rules for dealing with cargo ships without leniency once discovered. (4) All cargo ship grades and tax rates have been revised as follows: First class, less than 10 square meters, monthly tax of silver 50 cents; second class, 10 square meters or more but less than 20 square meters, monthly tax of silver 75 cents; third class, 20 square meters or more but less than 30 square meters, monthly tax of silver 1.25 yuan; fourth class, 30 square meters or more but less than 40 square meters, monthly tax of silver 2 yuan; fifth class, 40 square meters or more but less than 50 square meters, monthly tax of silver 2.75 yuan; sixth class, 50 square meters or more but less than 60 square meters, monthly tax of silver 3.50 yuan; seventh class, 60 square meters or more but less than 70 square meters, monthly tax of silver 4.25 yuan; eighth class, 100 square meters or more but less than 200 square meters, monthly tax of silver 5 yuan; ninth class, 200 square meters or more but less than 300 square meters, monthly tax of silver 5.75 yuan; tenth class, 300 square meters or more but less than 400 square meters, monthly tax of silver 6.50 yuan; eleventh class, 400 square meters or more but less than 500 square meters, monthly tax of silver 7.25 yuan; twelfth class, 500 square meters or more, monthly tax of silver 8 yuan. It is hoped that all sand-dredging boat owners will be aware of this and comply accordingly. This is announced.</p>
<h3>Pudong Undergoing Construction of Light Railway</h3>
<p>▲ Bridge Piers at Zhangjia浜 Should Be Wider</p>
<p>For the convenience of transportation in the Pudong District, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Bureau of Public Works is constructing a light railway from Zhoujiahang to Donggou, running new-style small-sized trains. Construction has already begun. However, it has been found that a bridge must be built in the middle section of the route, within the Zhangjia浜 port. Since the area is a route commonly used by ships engaged in shipbuilding, low and small bridges in the future would inevitably obstruct business. It is requested that the Bureau of Public Works widen the bridge piers and build high bridges to ensure that ships of around 100 tons from various shipyards within the 浜 can enter and exit without obstruction. It is reported that the shipbuilding industry in the area has reported to the industry association, which has forwarded the report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be submitted to the Municipal Government's Bureau of Public Works for careful construction to avoid hindering business.</p>

<h3>Today is the Deadline for Exchanging Certificates for Borrowed Rent</h3>
<p>▲ However, Those With Calculation Errors</p>
<p>▲ Can Apply for Recalculation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating that, regarding the matter of the notice, the exchange of certificates for borrowed rent in this city will end on the 6th of this month (i.e., today). However, it has been found that there are tens of thousands of households involved in this borrowed rent, and the exchange period is extremely short. The households are competing with each other, causing extreme crowding. It is difficult to guarantee that there will be no errors in calculation. In view of this, the bureau has decided that from the 7th of this month to the 20th, households with genuine errors will still be allowed to apply for recalculation at the bureau's exchange office to ensure accuracy. This is specially announced.</p>
<h3>Post-Mortem Arrangement for Gongfa Company</h3>
<p>▲ Manager of Great World Submitted Document to the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the post-mortem affairs of Gongfa Company, all parties involved have yet to come up with concrete measures. Min Caizhang, the manager of Great World, once drafted a plan and sought consent from all parties. This matter was reported in this newspaper. It is now heard that the plan has been praised by various parties. Yesterday, Min submitted a document to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, as well as all relevant parties. According to Min, the land lease contract for Great World is indeed for thirty years. If this plan is implemented, Great World alone could earn three million yuan in thirty years. Min's document is recorded as follows: Respectfully submitted, the Gongfa Company in this city, since the passing of Mr. Huang Chu Jiu, the post-mortem affairs have been stalled due to differing opinions among creditors. Since the joint reorganization by your government and related parties, there has been a slightly more concrete direction. As Caizhang is situated within this situation, his knowledge is more accurate. Therefore, he has drafted opinions regarding the Great World aspect for selection and reference. Great World, Day &amp; Night Bank, and Qitian Stage are built and operated on leased land with a remaining term of approximately twenty years. In order to protect the interests of creditors, a phased repayment method can take into account both the creditors and the company, avoiding any losses. The method is to lease out the Great World section and the Day &amp; Night Bank, Qitian Stage, and other buildings. Assuming an annual income of 100,000 yuan, a term of five or ten years can be set initially as a trial period. After the contract is signed, the company can receive an annual rent of 100,000 yuan for Great World, etc. After receiving this amount, a portion of the debt can be paid off. Thus, within five or ten years, 500,000 yuan or 1,000,000 yuan can be repaid. Adding the remaining lease term, a total of 2,000,000 plus several 100,000 yuan can be obtained. Based on the total debt of Gongfa Company, this can cover three-quarters of the amount. The creditors can gradually recover their debts each year and suffer less losses, which is more complete than discounting and repaying after an outright sale. Furthermore, the land rent for the Great World section and the Day &amp; Night Bank, Qitian Stage, and other buildings is 3,350 taels of silver per month, totaling 40,200 taels per year. According to common lease rules, this should be paid by Gongfa Company. However, in order to reduce the burden on Gongfa Company for the sake of the creditors, it can be stipulated in the contract with the lessee that the land rent will be paid by the lessee. Therefore, the Great World section is projected to generate a net rent of 100,000 yuan per year. I respectfully express my views for consideration.</p>
<h3>Gold Bracelet Found in Mouth</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Yubao Arrested for Robbery</p>
<p>Around 5 PM the day before yesterday, a Baoshan woman named Xia Xushi, residing in Tanjiachiao, Zhabei, was returning from a funeral when she was suddenly grabbed around the waist by a man while walking along Zhongshan Road. He snatched a gold bracelet and ran away wildly. Ms. Xia was terrified and shouted, "Robber!" She was chased and caught by a patrolman from the Pengpu Township Security Corps, who found the stolen item in his mouth. He identified himself as Wang Yubao, a native of Huaicheng, 26 years old, residing at No. 784 Yinghua Lane. He used to sell perfume, but as his income could not sustain him, he resorted to robbing women of their gold bracelets to make a living. He was immediately escorted to the Fourth District Headquarters with a letter and transferred to the judicial section for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Bandits Drive Owner to Attic</h3>
<p>▲ Plundered Everything and Left Calmly</p>
<p>The residents of Nandesheng Lane on Guohuo Road, Nanshi, are generally not wealthy. Only one bean sprout workshop is relatively well-off. At 9 PM the day before yesterday, four or five bandits, each armed with a handgun, suddenly arrived at the workshop to rob it. They stole two gold rings and dozens of silver dollars. At the time, there were many people in the workshop, but they were all intimidated by the handguns and were driven to the attic, where the ladder was removed, causing them to witness the bandits' rampage helplessly. At the same time, there was a police officer stationed at the entrance of the lane by the South Railway Station Police Station, but he did not notice the entry and exit of these people. It was learned afterward that the bandits had disappeared like the Yellow Crane.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of Young Male Corpse</h3>
<p>A young male corpse with neat clothes but no hat and shoes was found on the Eastern Sports Association Road in Zhabei. The situation was reported in this newspaper yesterday. It is now learned that the local court has conducted an autopsy and determined that the corpse resembled a student. There were fist wounds on the head and other parts of the body, confirming that the death was caused by injuries. An order has been issued to take photographs and await the arrest and investigation of the culprit.</p>
<h3>Yao Fengcheng Killed by Car</h3>
<p>▲ Car Causes Accident and Flees</p>
<p>Yao Fengcheng, a Nanjing native residing at No. 26 Jing'an Temple Road, worked as a rickshaw puller. Yesterday morning around 2 a.m., he was returning home in a rickshaw, passing along Hart Road from east to west. Suddenly, a car came speeding from behind, violently撞击 the rickshaw he was riding in, causing him to fall. He suffered severe head injuries, and the rickshaw puller also sustained minor injuries. However, the car, realizing it had caused an accident, sped away. Chinese constables discovered this and reported it to the Jing'an Temple police station via telephone, which dispatched detectives to investigate. The two injured men were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, Yao Fengcheng succumbed to his critical injuries and died shortly after. His body was sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Follen Road. The rickshaw puller remained hospitalized. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo from the Special District Local Court visited the office and confirmed the death. Yao Fengcheng, indeed, died from injuries sustained after being hit by a car. His body was handed over to his wife, Yao Xu, for coffining. The relevant police station was instructed to rigorously investigate and bring the fleeing car to justice for questioning.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Sends Xu Shiqi to Germany for Internship</h3>
<p>Artist Xu Shiqi, in April of last year, accompanied Chinese committee member Chu Minyi to Europe for inspection and research into model making. His performance was excellent. As his term is nearing completion, he planned to return to China immediately. A telegram has now been received from the Health Section of the League of Nations in Geneva, specially assigning Mr. Xu to undergo a four-month internship at the Dresden Provincial Health Museum in Germany. It is said that after Mr. Xu returns to China, he will be involved in the establishment of a large-scale health museum in Nanjing under the auspices of the National Health Administration.</p>
<h3>Petition to Withdraw Order to Open Yishun Lane</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, for the purpose of expanding Zhaojiabang Road in the Nanshi district into Heping Road, had planned to open up Yishun Lane, located between Zhaojiabang Road and Route Lafayette, to form an east-west thoroughfare. However, property owners in Yishun Lane believe that since there is already a wide thoroughfare, Wansheng Road, exceeding sixty feet in width nearby, vehicles, although slightly detoured, can still pass through. The opening of Yishun Lane seems unnecessary. Recently, more than ten property owners, including Zhou Xinshan, jointly submitted a petition to the municipal government to withdraw the order.</p>
<h3>Complete Compilation of National Debt Plan Published</h3>
<p>China's historical internal and external debts have reached over ten billion yuan. If these are not reorganized, it would not only harm the nation's credit but also affect the social economy. Aware of this, the authorities are in the process of establishing a society for reorganization, but concrete measures have not yet been announced. Wu Jin's Fei Baoyan has been studying finance and has now completed a full compilation of the National Debt Reorganization Plan in one volume, which can serve as a reference. Prominent figures such as Xu Shiying, Ma Yinchu, Jia Shiyi, and Qin Moshai have contributed prefaces. The book is now published, priced at twenty cents per copy. It is available for sale in Nanjing at No. 3 Changzhi Lane, Longwang Temple, and in Shanghai at the Shanghai Pictorial Agency on Wangping Street.</p>

A date will then be set for instruction.</p>
<h3>"Slave Blood" Premieres in Paris Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Paris Grand Theater, on Avenue Joffre, will begin showing the passionate and tragic epic film "Slave Blood" starting today. The film is the latest production from the German Wei-Fa company, depicting the cruelty and inhumanity of the aristocracy and the suffering of ordinary people during the autocratic era in Russia, interwoven with a story of soul-stirring love between master and servant. It is both慷慨激昂 and纏綿悱惻. The final scene, with peasants shouldering their burdens facing off in a fierce battle against the Cossacks on horseback with their guns, a scene of flying flesh and blood, is especially shocking.</p>
<h3>Fruit and Produce Industry Building Clubhouse at Wharf</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fruit and Produce Industry Association has over fifty members, most of whom are concentrated in the area of the 16th Pier in the Nanshi district. Therefore, the transportation and unloading of goods are primarily carried out at the Bund. Currently, leaders of the association, including Xu Runsen, Xu Runsheng, Xu Lingxu, Zheng Feizhang, and Cheng Xueshi, representing all members, have leased a wharf on the Bund at the 16th Pier from the municipal government for use as a dedicated wharf for the fruit and produce industry. They have been working on filling and paving the area with soil, and the project is expected to be completed soon. The association plans to build a three-story Western-style building on the wharf to serve as the association's clubhouse, accommodating affiliated organizations such as the Friendship Society, all in one place for convenience. It is said that construction is currently underway and is expected to commence shortly.</p>
<h3>Da Chang Silk Store Clearing Inventory</h3>
<p>Da Chang Silk Store on Shilu Road has been in business for over twenty years, known for its reputation for gathering famous and valuable silks and satins and selling them at reasonable prices. Business has been excellent. However, the current building is scheduled for demolition and reconstruction. The owner of the store, due to the pressing timeframe, urgently needs to clear out the existing inventory. Therefore, starting yesterday, a grand sale of all silks and satins is being held. The goal is to clear out the inventory as quickly as possible so that the building can be demolished and reconstructed on schedule. The prices are said to be so low that they are unprecedented in Shanghai. It is also reported that all of the store's assets are available for negotiation at low prices.</p>

<h3>Ma Wenhuei Appointed Deputy Manager of Sincere Main Branch</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Huanbiao, Deputy Manager of the Hong Kong Sincere Company, requested leave last year due to illness. The board of directors, recognizing his contributions, granted him a long leave for recuperation. However, the position of Deputy Manager could not remain vacant for long. A selection was made yesterday, and it was heard that the person selected was Ma Wenhuei, the former Manager of the Sincere Store in London. While in England, he successively served as Chairman of the British Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chairman of the British Overseas Chinese Federation, Committee Member of the Sino-British Society, and Director of various prominent British societies. Years ago, his youngest son, Ma Jianyuan, was born in England and baptized at St. Paul's Cathedral. At that time, newspapers around the world published photos and detailed accounts of the event, which was widely praised. It is said that Ma was the first foreigner to be baptized in that church. He returned to China last month after completing his term, passing through the United States. Ma Wenhuei is the fourth son of Ma Yingbiao, the current Political Training Committee Member of the Zhongshan Model County and the founder and General Supervisor of Sincere Company. His selection as Deputy Manager is celebrated as a fortunate acquisition for the company.</p>

<h3>The Status of Asian Students at Wesleyan University in America</h3>
<p>(1) Conditions During School Holidays</p>
<p>(2) A Glimpse of American Prices</p>
<p>(3) American Rice Quality and Fish Cooking Methods</p>
<p>(4) Meeting Old Acquaintances in Another Country</p>
<p>(5) A Three-Day Observation of the American Countryside and the Life of Middle-Class Farmers</p>
<p>Contributed by Lu Erzhao from Songjiang, currently in Georgia, USA</p>
<p>The period from December 19, 1930, to January 5 of the following year was the Christmas holiday at Wesleyan University. Erzhao arrived in the United States in early September and was admitted to study at this school. It has already been half a year, and one semester's course has come to an end. The day before the holiday, we three Asian students (one being Mr. Xie, a classmate returning to China, and the other being Ms. Shibamata, a Japanese woman) held an emergency meeting to discuss how to spend this holiday economically and interestingly. The school regulations stated that "foreign students can stay on campus, but meals must be arranged by the students themselves." After consultation, we organized a presidium and adopted a division-of-labor approach, with one person responsible for: (1) Social activities (correspondence with professors and classmates, gift-giving); (2) Hygiene (transporting goods, preparing meals); (3) Labor (cleaning various areas, washing utensils). Although the duties were divided among these three main areas, the sentiment was harmonious. Once the constitution was established, we chose a date for implementation and adhered to it strictly during the holiday, as if bound by law.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, we attended classes for two hours, and the holiday began at 11:00 AM. The students changed into new clothes, preparing to return home to visit their families. Several, with beaming smiles and genuine warmth, shook Erzhao's hand to say goodbye. Some students, perhaps influenced by psychological factors, told me how they would talk to their parents, how they would visit relatives and friends, how they would entertain guests, going on and on for five or six minutes. Affected by this environment, I couldn't help but feel homesick. However, I mustered my courage and persevered, absolutely refusing to reveal the weakness of a small girl who was homesick and afraid of being far away. At 11:15 AM, the bell rang loudly, and the students rushed to the luggage room to collect their belongings and go home. In an instant, the vast campus of several hundred acres, the bustling place of thousands of people, was left with only two American female professors and three new Asian students (excluding doormen and guards). The Han Dynasty writer Zhai Gong's saying "the gate is deserted enough to catch sparrows" was almost a reflection of our school. In the evening, we three Asian students returned to our bedrooms, tidied up our new arrangements, and rested. Sitting alone by the cold window, I wrote a poem to send home:</p>
<p>Having parted from your kind faces for half a year,</p>
<p>I crane my neck to gaze at the clouds in Georgia.</p>
<p>Have the plum blossoms bloomed in my home garden?</p>
<p>Green screens of pines surround the small stone hill.</p>
<p>The next morning (the 20th), we three, along with the two professors, moved into one house to alleviate the loneliness. It had everything, including bedrooms, a dining room, a reception room, an electric stove, a gas stove, running water, and various miscellaneous items. So, the Minister of Hygiene began his work. Erzhao, wrongly appointed to this position, had to take the lead, taking a bus to the city to shop. Prices are listed below:</p>
<p>▲ Price List of Goods</p>
<p>Item Quantity Price</p>
<p>Rice 5 pounds 25 cents</p>
<p>Fish Per pound 10 cents</p>
<p>Eggs Per dozen 45 cents</p>
<p>Other items such as oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea were purchased as needed. We returned fully loaded. Alas, once a place for teaching qin songs, now a place for Shantou salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea. It's a good laugh! But one thing must be specially mentioned: American rice is chewy and soft, like Chinese glutinous rice. A certain professor gave instructions on how to cook rice. So, after boiling the rice, the rice water was poured out, and the rice was washed with cold water until all the residue was gone. Only then could a good pot of rice be cooked. That's one thing. Another difficult point was cooking fish without wine. The American government's alcohol prohibition was strict, and there was nowhere to buy it. So, sugar was used as a substitute, and the taste was still palatable. But the American professor said that American fish has no fishy smell. We were not entirely convinced. Three meals a day, washing the dishes after meals, were done by the three of us in cooperation, implementing the American household system. Because American servants are currently very expensive, people in society do everything themselves. We also temporarily donned a sacred title, working as laborers.</p>
<p>The 22nd and 24th were the Yufei and Quan Jie festivals in our country. I, along with Mr. Xie and Ms. Shibamata, discussed buying vegetables and using an electric hot pot to have a Winter Solstice and New Year's Eve dinner. We were in the midst of preparations when Ms. Huang Youkui kindly came to visit. Ms. Huang is a graduate of Soochow University in Suzhou and came to the United States this summer to study at Alabama Women's College. She is the only Chinese person in their school. For months, she had not spoken a single word of Chinese and felt particularly depressed. So, she came from hundreds of miles away to chat with us in Chinese during the holiday. Ms. Huang's arrival was extremely pleasant. The ancient saying goes, "Meeting an old acquaintance in another country," especially in a foreign land. Another saying goes, "Hearing a familiar accent intoxicates the soul, even if we are strangers, we feel close." How much more so with a comrade we have known for a long time! At that time, it was as if the talking machine had been turned on to full speed. We talked about everything, freely and unreservedly, until dawn. The Song Dynasty writer Su Dongpo's saying, "Not knowing that the east had already turned white," was truly the case. Chatting in bed and passing the good night was most enjoyable. People say the Winter Solstice night is long, but I felt that this evening was so short!</p>
<p>From the 23rd to the 29th, these few days were busy with socializing. One classmate sent a box of oranges, another sent Pecorns, which are similar to walnuts and are a specialty of America. Other foods and decorations arrived in an endless stream. So, the Minister of Social Affairs was extremely busy. Erzhao also volunteered to be the secretary of the Social Affairs Department, and letters were promptly answered without any backlog. At that time, the two professors, seeing how busy we were, laughed and said that the quiet holiday atmosphere had been broken by us and transformed into a bustling market. We all laughed together for a long time.</p>
<p>On December 30th, Erzhao, at the invitation of classmate Vienue, went to her home to spend the New Year. Her home is located in Macon, a place that resembles Sixian Town near my hometown in our country. The classmate's parents are both living. Her mother graduated from Wesleyan University in 1906, in the same class as the eldest daughter of the Song family in China (said to be Mrs. Kong). Her father is a middle-class landowner with over ten acres of land and several workers under his command. He hires a black cook, but only for cooking. Cleaning the house, greeting guests, and arranging the garden are all the responsibility of the children. She has two older brothers and one younger sister, all of whom are studying at school. They leave in the morning and return in the evening. The family is harmonious and orderly. Erzhao stayed at her house for three days and was treated with great hospitality. Killing a pig for food, the sincerity of their attitude was natural and did not make one feel uncomfortable. During those three days, there was no shouting or scolding, only a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere. Her eight-year-old sister helped with chores as if she were an adult, handling everything appropriately and making one feel grateful. The three days of American rural life involved browsing around the nearby area, asking about things, and learning that farming is done using scientific methods, disaster prevention methods are planned in advance, and the produce is abundant enough for each household to be self-sufficient. I recalled when my mother taught me Mencius as a child, up to the phrases "enrich them and then teach them" and "urge them with filial piety and fraternal duty." When I was a little older, I read Guanzi's phrase, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame; when granaries are full, people know etiquette and righteousness." At first, I didn't feel that it had any meaning, but now I suddenly understand.</p>
<p>On the morning of January 3rd (1931), I bid farewell and returned to school to prepare for studies and to clean up the holiday arrangements, canceling the duties of each department, and returning to my original identity as a student. The holiday life came to an end, and student work continued. On the morning of January 6th, classes resumed as usual.</p>

<h3>Before Engagement</h3>
<p>— Ziqiu</p>
<p>Seeking wisdom and seeking love cannot be parallel. Everyone who has associated with Xu Jun probably knows this. Thus, we have a considerable understanding of Xu Jun's choice of a partner. Time advances like white clouds. The 19th-grade student who used to be the youngest in the entire school has surprisingly become a senior. At a grand farewell banquet where cups were raised to bid farewell to the graduating students, we congratulated Xu Jun on receiving his mortarboard and wished him success in his pursuit of love.</p>
<p>With a cautious smile, Xu gave a concise and intelligent reply. He said,</p>
<p>"After hundreds of exams, large and small, our pursuit of knowledge seems to have come to an end. What we should strive for from now on are the two most difficult problems in life: service and finding a partner."</p>
<p>News came from the school bulletin that Xu Jun had been honorably appointed as a technician in a certain bureau. While we rejoiced, we also thought of Xu's two major problems.</p>
<p>"Xu, how far has it progressed?" One day, I ran into Xu at the Riri Building unexpectedly, and I asked him this.</p>
<p>"Alas, so many trials and tribulations! However...but one could say it's in the testing phase." The brief answer was not yet finished when Xu hurriedly extended his hand to bid farewell.</p>
<p>From his dark, smooth hair and snowy white face, I received a hint, feeling that Xu was different today. His expression contained a certain mysterious element. So, after walking a few steps away, driven by curiosity, I turned around and followed Xu, step by step, into the Wing On Company. Xu stopped at the stationery counter, so I stood far away.</p>
<p>Finally, this mysterious comedy began. Next to Xu was a bright and beautiful young woman. After a process of mutual gazing, Xu's lips moved slightly for a while. The other party seemed to respond, and he and she walked out side by side through the side door. Because of my duties, I took the No. 5 tram.</p>
<p>Two months passed quickly, and we received Xu's wedding invitation. I looked forward to this day as eagerly as a bridegroom. People who long for a happy date always feel that the god of time is intelligent because he advances it imperceptibly.</p>
<p>In the dazzling and chaotic auditorium, the master of ceremonies had already announced the part where the newlyweds reported on their love affair. Xu took the stage amidst the fervent hope of the crowd.</p>
<p>"We were introduced by Mr. So-and-so and Mr. So-and-so and found each other satisfactory. We are very honored that all of you guests have come to witness the ceremony..." Xu gave a simple and perfunctory report.</p>
<p>Young people who are pursuing love are certainly not satisfied with such a dull report. So, amidst the uproar, Ou took the lead in launching an attack.</p>
<p>"Xu Jun's academic cap is composed of one hundred and eighty test reports. He is a person who studies mathematics and physics, and everything must be based on experimentation. The process of this pursuit of love must have at least twenty reports that can be compiled. Submit the papers immediately!"</p>
<p>"Xu, don't be too evasive. Please report on the Wing On Company test first, or I will have to act on your behalf!" Because I was a relative of Xu, and indeed the protagonist in the last comedy, I spoke very excitedly.</p>
<p>Xu felt that we might have a more in-depth understanding, or perhaps because their marriage was indeed worth reporting, so he spoke frankly and fluently.</p>
<p>"Friends, this marriage is not at the command of parents or the words of a matchmaker, but it is also not a fruit formed by free love. I think we have taken a new path in marriage. Since I graduated, everyone knew that I was going to strive to find love. Therefore, the elders in my family were even more actively engaged in my partner selection. Unfortunately, being in today's distorted social life made it impossible for me to find a match on my own. Therefore, the elders eventually took the lead in their efforts. At first, I always felt somewhat at a loss. If I agreed, the future would be vague; if I opposed, there seemed to be little possibility in the environment. Looking forward to the vastness of the future, this surging heart was floating uncertainly. Finally, seeing the pity of stopping in the face of tribulation, I thought it was better not to ask or hear, as it would easily arouse darkness. So, I resolutely wrote a short note to Qian one night. She is the partner I am now satisfied with, and also the protagonist in the marriage discussion among the elders. The letter was written like this,"</p>
<p>"Ms. Qian, excuse my impudence. The motive for writing this letter is to seek the future brightness of both parties, because we are now being dominated to be the protagonists in a marriage drama. I think that being dominated in this vague way will inevitably leave a regret of ambiguity and uncertainty in the hearts of both parties. Therefore, I think it would be better for us to directly and frankly resolve the happiness of our lives ourselves. This method is that I ask you to be a friend..." Ms. Qian is worthy of being a discerning woman. She fully agreed. In the second letter, I arranged to meet her at the Wing On stationery counter. At that time, because neither party knew who the other was, I specifically informed her that I would be holding an old Shen Bao newspaper from a certain month and day, and instructed her to add a camellia-colored flower to her lapel for identification. This was the first scene of the test that Li saw. Afterwards, on the one hand, we proceeded with our individual understanding, and on the other hand, we perfunctorily dealt with the elders in our respective families, keeping our marriage suspended without being too close or too distant. After two months of contact, all parties had a mutual understanding. Both parties felt quite satisfied, so this pending case was finally resolved perfectly."</p>
<p>Because of Xu's exceptionally detailed report, we heard some very good comments in the guest speeches. They were like this:</p>
<p>"If the children can make an effort to understand and discern the marriages introduced by parents and relatives in advance, then it will not be blind. There is no need for parents to stubbornly oppose the success of their children's pursuit of love, as long as they can add considerable consideration and strict scrutiny, because parents are experienced people who have been through it, and children are enthusiastic parties involved. If both parties can assist each other, then ninety percent of the time, satisfactory results can be achieved. If anyone wants to bind anyone, then they will go to the realm of darkness and depression."</p>
<p>At the happy banquet filled with delicacies and fine wine, Xu came to propose a toast.</p>
<p>"Xu is truly a bold and meticulous person," Ou said with admiration.</p>
<p>Then, a cautious smile reappeared on Xu's face.</p>
