<h3 id="c23">今後災民之衣的問題 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>從水災發生到現在已經兩月多了。兩月多的光陰。在安居的人。自然只是白駒過隙的一瞬。然而浮沉水上忍死待命的災民。一分一秒的時光。都爲悠久不堪忍受的歲月。救災的呼聲。已經嚮澈雲霄了。我們自問。在兩月後的今日災情减輕了幾多呢。災民救援了幾多呢。</p>
<p>秋風起了。災黎的身上。又增加了一重冷的迫害。水浸着肚餓着。四週慘極人寰的景物圍繞着。更加上寒冷襲擊着。一萬萬災區同胞現在所處的人間地獄的慘境。我們眞不敢想。不忍想。然而這地獄確又呈現在我們眼簾的人間。</p>
<p>我們不要以爲近來水勢漸漸降退了。災情已經減輕救災的工作也可以隨便在我們的腦子裏冷淡過去其實水退以後的問題。比水漲時更爲嚴重。因爲水大時。大家都定心待（死。）現在水已爲大家讓出了一條生路。大家都重新想求（生。）定心待死的問題簡單。求生不得。則情形至慘而又至重。我們應該體念災區同胞挣扎求生之情加緊進行救災工作。</p>
<p>這次中國經濟學社開年會。曾討論救災的治標治本方法。提出的救災意見書上說。（至於本年吾國棉產短少若干。政府尙無報告。據專家最近估計。每年全國需用之棉花共爲一千一百萬担。除自能供給者外。尙短少四五百萬担。故除政府設法購借食糧之外。並應由棉業同人協謀購借外國棉花及粗布之辦法。以匡政府之不逮。如果政府能代爲担保。固屬甚佳。否則完全由實業界自動商借。亦於公私兩有裨益。）這種意見。在目前災民啼寒聲中。實在是惟一急切的方法。</p>
<p>我國雖以農立國。近十餘年來。不僅糧食仰給於外國抑且成爲一個缺衣的國家。據海關方面調查。從十八年到十九年三月。由外國輸入的衣料。棉織物值一七三·三五九·三二二海關兩。棉花六七·九八一·四一七。毛織物四八·三八○·七九九。絲織物二八·八二四·七七五。麻織物二二·九○二·一○一。棉紗一六·七○六·六一六。皮貨一二·五四五·七八九。鈕扣一·一七三·一二二。合計共爲三七一·八七三·九四一海關兩。約計我國每年共有七千萬人靠外國棉花或棉織物禦寒。講到我國植棉的區域。雖說北從奉天。熱河。蒙古。南到雲南。廣東。廣西。但是主要的產地。却在長江和黄河兩大流域。近年來植棉的面積。長江流域約占全國植棉畝數的六成半。黄河流域約占三成四分。其他各地的產額極微。無關重要。據華商紗廠聨合會調查。民國九年到十八年的十年中。棉田面積和產額平均數。江蘇爲九·一四四·五二○畝二·一六三·○二五擔。安徽爲八二七·七九三畝。一六一·四四四擔。江西爲五一三·○一八畝。二一·五六九擔。湖北爲六·七五二·六八○畝。一·四三○·二三擔。今年情形便大不同了。黄河流域受災雖說較輕。但是以上各省的棉田。都在沿長江一帶。受災以來。洪水到處。棉花無收。桑樹淹壞。絲棉產額。幾等零。而災區人民所有衣服。又多隨廬舍漂流以俱去現在已到秋凉嚴冬轉瞬即來。飢的問題。現在商借美麥已經成議。而且東北剩餘糧食。亦足以救濟一部分。還算有一綫希望。寒呢。如果我們只救災民的飢。而不救災民的寒。那末災民即使僥倖得免死於飢。亦必死於寒。這隨着秋凉以俱來的嚴重問題。我們應立即早爲籌謀啊。</p>
<p>救濟的方法。我們的意見如下。</p>
<p>（一）向美國購借棉花與粗布。</p>
<p>（二）提出全國各軍存餘的破敝軍衣。</p>
<p>（三）大規模的捐助破衣廠布。</p>
<p>總而言之。設身處地。災地同胞的飢與寒。和救濟的方法。任何人總都可以想像得到。想得到便要切實的做。災民所忍死以待的。是實在在的糧食和衣服。不是連篇累牘的方案。（坐而言不如立而行。）我們不救災民則已。要救便得劍及履及。切實的照方案做。把寫的方案一椿一椿用事實表現出來。國内要電二</p>

<p>英報認爲不當</p>
<p>嗾使韓人虐殺我僑胞</p>
<p>日本竟完全置諸腦後▲世界社譯神戶英文日本紀錄報社論云、日本之若干軍人、頗鮮紀律觀念、在他國、軍人不談政治、認爲出於軍事範圍之外、即在日本、於黨的政治、其軍人亦比較的不過問、而一有擂戰鼓之機會、被等即不肯放棄之、最近之中村事件、足證軍人在日本政治上乃一極危險分子、第一最不堪者爲南陸相、彼於民政當局禁止報紙揭載該案之期内、即對各師團長爲鼓煽的演說、而使報紙披露之、當然、彼之屬員皆迅速追隨其步伐、一時所謂强硬對華論轟然並起、甚至有倡於本案未解决之前、佔領滿蒙若干要地、以保解决之勝利者、又有主張用武力搜集證據者、夫旣須用武力搜集證據、是無異自認經此大吹大擂之後、而該案之充分證據尙未覓得矣、在大連方面、戰事熱度非常高漲、於某劇塲舉行盛大之集會、由軍人主持演說、將中村事件舖張揚厲、煽動聽衆要求報復、此輩軍人本以戰事爲業、天然思藉戰事發財、於是乘機搗亂、而竟無加以制裁者、何耶、</p>
<p>查中村與另一同行之軍人、當時均作常人裝朿、護照上亦不載明爲軍人、據云二人被華兵捕殺、日軍界遂指爲日本軍隊之恥、夫軍人而以常人裝束旅行、豈能期望其軍人資格之受人尊重、華兵殺之、固屬不當、然是否果係華兵、亦爲欵問、因又有被盜匪殺死之說也、就盜匪論、中政府固亦應負治盜之責、然盜殺或兵殺、中政府所負責任之輕重、即不能同日而語、况以軍人而衣常人服裝、頗有間課嫌疑、則比諸殺一携有正式旅行護照之軍官、其責任又須大爲减等矣、凡此種種考慮、在專以煽起戰事熱之一切集會中、完全置之不問、然在此等考慮未曾研究之先、日政府安能决定應付之手段耶、無論軍人或非軍人、又安能要求報復佔領及施用武力等等耶、</p>
<p>又有一事被完全置諸腦後者、即韓人對華暴動之、大國際交涉尙未解决是也、夫使一二軍人在人烟稀少之地被戕、認爲慘酷、則數十乃至數百之公民及老住戶皆從事正當營業者、竟遭襲擊而虐殺、並毁其一切財產、其慘酷豈不十百倍遠過之耶、日政府對此韓人暴行案、固已承認其錯、光爲賠償、而中政府則未滿意、故尙在交涉中、華方固曾提議派兵至韓保護華僑、然此乃日方屢屢高唱增兵滿蒙保護日僑之反響、又何足怪、總之、於此兩事件、果爲公平之判斷、則華方之激昻、實應遠過於日方、此在日外務省亦未嘗不知、若此事全由外務當局主政、未嘗不可得相當之解决、無如軍人强硬出頭、干涉外交、亂出主張、鼓起國民之激昻、此乃大爲危險者也、</p>

<p>申新紗廠業已轉　、且將停業、吾等慫恿該廠非黨員工人三名組織一赤色團體、該團體開始爭鬭、要求復業、一部份工人（該廠有四千工人）舉行一會議、舉出七人、組織一委員會、以進行爭鬭、該會提出下列四項要求、（一）該紗廠須復業、（二）如該廠復業時、停工期間所有工資應照付、（三）如該廠易主而重開、原有工人一概留職、（四）如該廠水閉而不復業、則生一工人應由舊廠主付以五年工資、該廠有一黄色聨合會、工人要求償還最近三年來付與該會之會費、昔時曾有一互助團體、工人亦要求償還付與該團體之欵項、我團體之領袖、已離廠他就、故如今該團體僅餘二人矣、該廠未閉時、吾等曾遣派同志一人前往工作、（未知何故、該同志竟不在三人之團體中）、彼現正領導此種爭鬭、昨日七人組織之委員會、已開會議、議决根據前項要求、繼續奮鬭、黄色聨合會領袖亦要求工人反對該廠停閉、但只以避免失業爲根據、吾等仍爲前項要求而奮鬭、以期反對彼等之宣傳、黄色聨合會過去並無生氣、祇有一委員會而已、廠内（右派）亦甚活動、告發我同志、言其甫由Ｗ處回來、且擁護四次全會、西區申新第一紗廠紡織部亦曾有一度罷工、（三十工人）彼等每日工作十二小時、僅得工資三角四分、故有增至四角二分之要求此項要求、竟得監督同意、於是工人又要求每日工資改爲五角二分、而監督又准許之、此次爭鬭、係由八人組織之委員會領導、而全係自動者、吾等進行宣傳、要求廠内工人一律增加工資百分之二十、吾等將壁報八份分貼於工廠墻上、吾等擬於該處組織一赤色團體、濟和（譯音）紗廠打包部有六十工人罷工、此輩打包工人原將二十小包紮成一大包、今迫其將數增至三十二包、彼等原以件數計算工資、工作能力較佳者、每日可得八角至一元、今該廠管理部實行以日計算、每日工作十二小時、工資五角、工人聞後、即有四人往管理部要求仍以件數計算、若以日計算、則須將工資增至五角五分、管理部人員竟出威脅之語、謂彼等若煽動工人、則將受革除之處罰、於是全體打包工人聲稱如要求不得准許、則非罷工不可、管理部終於准其所請、仍以件數計算工資、此次爭鬭發生後、吾等遂合三人而成一赤色團體、現正設法將上述工人四名拉入其中、</p>
<p>民興（譯音）絲織廠有八十工人、去歲每人每日可織綢二十尺、每尺得工資三分、每日則得六角、管理部决定將工資每尺改爲五文、因之工人遂罷工反抗、並自動組織一罷工委員會、吾等正擬聨絡此輩罷工者、加以組織與指導、</p>
<p>法租界有紗廠三、共有工人一千名、其一名鼎新（譯音）紗廠、廠中已由國民黨組織一黄色聨合會、該會工作努力之四人被革、工人遂派代表赴社會局請願、該局答謂須先行調查、方可處理、工人聞之甚怒、謂四人旣已被革、萬難靜待調查之結果、於是彼等集合工人數名、提議要求管理部收容被革之工人、此會議係於一婦人之屋内開會、而其夫乃一黨員也、該黨員聞言、即提議廠内工人應有組織、並要求將被革工人復職、若此而不准、則惟有罷工之一途矣、彼等接受此項提議、並謂將於歸後從事組織、結果如何、吾等尙未得知、</p>
<p>有一鋸木工廠、共有工人二百名、大都係短工、彼等每日工作十二小時、得工資五角至六角、彼等要求長期工作、並增加工資百分之二十、監督僅准許增加工資百分之二十、而不准許長期工作、</p>
<p>最近兩星期、吾等在西區組織工作之發展、申新第一紗廠已有由八人組成之赤色團體、逹豐紗廠已有工人四名與吾等聨絡、振泰紗廠已有由三人組成之赤色團體、某日本公司所開之第五紗廠、已有工人一名與吾等聨絡、宏宏生已有工人四名、與吾等聨絡、濟和紗廠已有工人三名與吾等聨絡、温莫肇（譯音）廠已有工人四名、與吾等聨絡、某麵粉廠已有由八人組成之赤色團體、浦海（譯音）第二紗廠已有一工人與吾等聨絡、而某繅絲廠亦已有一人、共計已有三十八工人、而其中黨員僅二人、（吾等曾問西區其餘勤奮之黨員、對於全體黨員擔此項重要工作之必要、是否注意及之、比奥尼謂將考慮此事、</p>
<p>電話工人之爭鬭、上星期吾等召集一羣衆大會、到會者共一百人、但留至會終始退者僅四十人、此四十人推舉七人、組織一爭鬭委員會指導此項爭鬭、我等同志不知如何利用該委員會、彼等反謂應組織一赤色職工會、而不討論應提出之要求、以及進行爭鬭之方法、工人以爲組織職工會尙非其時、故吾等迄今尙未將較活動之工人粗織爲赤色團體、反派有同志數人前往領導、工人但問彼等爲何人、而並無信任之表示、該委員會爲七人之中僅一人、吾黨同志、當吾等行再召集該委員會會議時有委員數人並未出席、吾等遂以工作方法必須改變之意、告我同志、吾等現已組織一赤色團體、其中共有七人、吾等亦賴此團體而進行工作、現已不再派同志前往指導矣、吾等現請該團體召集一代表會議、討論應提出之要求、以及進行爭鬭之方法、工人提議組織一俱樂部、而不欲組織赤色職工會、吾黨對此已表同意、由上所述、可知吾等同志尙不知工作之方法、（於是比奥尼提出數項問題、即關於海運工人組織及工作方法者、吾等遂根據原有之小册答之）、</p>
<p>（三五）致（阿克斯）之英文報告述及中國紡織工人之爭鬭關於上海繅絲工人之罷工者尤多</p>
<p>余等此信之本意、在於使君等略知吾等在此間紡織工業界之工作情形、紡織工業之客觀情形、對於吾等之作、甚爲適宜、但因吾等之組織、與紡織工人毫無聨絡、故在此有希望之範圍内尙無成積可言、現在吾等可以明白過去在立山領導之下、下級黨部在羣衆間之工作、向不注意凡事均係上級（領袖）所爲、而全不顧及職工會之工作、今吾黨雖已認識此項工作之重要、而已派遣較有能力之同志、領導職工會工作、然吾等尙有一種惡劣之趨勢、必須加以改良、吾人必須使全國勞工會與黨部覺察兩者間之隔閡、吾人當視黨部爲組織政治示威運動進行政治工作之機關、而將全國勞工會視爲進行日常經濟爭鬭之機關、試觀赤色職工會欲於罷工時進行某種工作、而罷工所在之工廠或製造廠内之黨員、大都並不設法援助、即可證實矣、例如本年三四月間上海絲織工人罷工時、黨部曾派同志九人前往工作、但數日後甚至此九人亦離職而去矣、吾人雖已再三說明黨部派遣黨員援助絲織工人罷工之必要、然能以其才力援助上海工人如此廣大之爭鬭者、僅九位同志耳、吾人屢欲打破黨部與全國勞工會間之分隔現象、現已得一部份之成功矣、</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>此間罷工之統計、甚不準確、是以吾等已將此項工作移歸自己担任、以求其日益精確、十星期以來、截至四月三十日止、據吾人所蒐集之消息、罷工已有一百四十九起之多、其中發生於紗廠者計三十起、發生於絲織廠者三十八起、此外尙有華北北製髮　女工三千人之大罷工、紙烟廠及火柴廠亦有罷工數起、又有一紗廠發生學徒之罷工、共計女工之罷工有七十起之多、單獨之罷工、其人數約在數百至二萬人之間、此類罷工自然係出於自動者、罷工總數、當然較吾等之記載爲多、蓋吾等消息之來源爲報紙、而報紙决不盡登罷工消息也、</p>
<p>上海共有一百以上之絲廠、其中工人（婦女與童工）人數在五萬以上、自十月至三月、絲廠並不開工、去年十月間、黄色聨合會以生絲批發價低落、强迫工人接受减少工資百分之十五之條件、今年三月、工人開始爭鬥、要求恢復原有工資、自三月九日以至四月三日、工人分别罷工、共計三十一起之多、四月四日三十二絲廠聨合總罷工、共計罷工人數有二萬人、四月十一日社會局禁止工人罷工、但十八日工人又舉行總罷工、參加者有三十三絲廠、社會局市黨部以及黄色職工會督促工人復工、並保證工資之恢復、社會局决定增加工資、自六月一日開始實行、但六月一日絲廠突告停閉、通知工人等待政府批准絲業公債後、領取增加之工資、於是東三省安東市遂以一萬五千工人罷工聞矣、</p>
<p>絲廠内旣無黨部、復無職工會之組織、上海絲廠工人未罷工以前、據說共黨青年聨盟、在上海絲廠内有集中之組織、但至罷工時、此種組織已不復可見矣、三月十五日余遇見全國勞工會婦女委員會之女同志、遂與彼等論及對付絲業界情形之方法、吾等决定利用三月八日所成立之關係、而在工人之間、開始工作、但此種工作、仍未實行、全國勞工會與ＳＬＣ以及地方黨務委員會、均迫於對付目前絲業界情形之工作、而無暇顧及、印行材料甚或印行一頁之大字、亦因此而轉交黨部辦理矣、此等團體已有多次開會、對於絲業界工作亦多良善之决議、黨部與ＳＬＣ特派一同志、領導絲業界工作、但繅絲工人間之工作、則無同志担任、吾等曾有繅絲工人將大舉罷工之推測、但上海團體中居於領導地位之數同志、雖每日均見繅絲工人之罷工消息、却仍持異議、總罷工進行時、吾等曾提議召集工人代表大會但亦受人反對、最後經吾等再三說服、此數同志自知見解已錯、允設法召集此次會議、並于次日（四月十八日）出版一特刊、勸工人將（組織權）一項改爲具體的要求、並公然提出、（反對仲哉裁）（擁護直接談判）以及（組織工人自己的委員會）之口號、但此種條件並未履行、余以爲此次繅絲工人之罷工、適足以使黨部及全國勞工會之同志覺悟、工人雖有爭鬥之决心、而吾黨之組織、與此種爭鬥毫無聨絡、實一大憾事也、現今之工作、方法、已在設法改善、可於吾等與分担現有職務之諸同志談話紀錄中見之、吾等不僅已向全國勞工會述及由繅絲工人罷工而得之敎訓、且已草擬一公文、呈送有關此項職務之黨部矣同郵附上致全國勞工會論棉業界情形之文書一份</p>
<p>關於上海以外之紡織工業情形、吾等所得之消息甚少、吾等已再三懇請全國勞工會設立一大規模的全國紡織工業臨時委員會、</p>
<p>此外尙有若干同志、亦已深信此等罷工、其次數旣日益頻繁、而其性質又日益普遍、决非工人之平常有季節性質的爭鬥、而爲工人生活所受壓迫之結果、此種壓迫、即與現今世界經濟危機有關者也、日帝國主義者係中國紗廠之最大廠主、今受此世界經濟濟危機之影響、欲以工人償其所失而英帝國主義者亦有相似之計畫、君等可於上述關於棉紗業之文書中見之、</p>
<p>紗廠之罷工、僅爲棉業界大罷工之先驅而已、他日之大罷工、决非單對中國紗廠主人之一種爭鬥、而亦爲對英日棉業雇主之大爭鬥、英國遠東經濟考察團對英國棉業大王之建議厥爲（使一切階級有所犧牲）、俾能適應市場之情形、而以更多之資本、投入中國紗廠、孟却斯脫黄色聨合會業已接受該團之建議並答允孟却斯脫染業工人工資减低、吾等曾勸全國勞工會刋一請願書、要求英國棉業工人認識利害關係、余意若ＭＭ能此同樣之請願書向中國棉業工人呼籲、則必有助于兩國之棉業工人運動、未知君等之意如何、若亦以爲然、則請ＭＭ務必將請願書寄至此處、</p>
<p>關於婦女工作、吾等曾發行一種十一頁之小册、由我等之職工會寄與各有關係之人、作爲婦女工作之指導、各國尙有一種問答表附入、以便得悉婦女生活、以及吾等在婦女間工作之概况、適合吾等需要之報告、甚難覔得除日本曾於某次罷工時舉行一婦女大會外、婦女間之工作、尙無成績可言、即在中國白色區域内必要之機關、亦未設立、在中國方面、吾等固曾於上級黨部設立一軟弱之機關、然因最近之逮捕、以及某一ＣＣ（共黨）黨員之煽動工作、已毁滅殆盡矣、吾等曾討論黨部與全國勞工會内如何確立此項工作、吾等所注重之主要工作、即黨内之婦女委員會應指導職工會在婦女間之工作、目前之主要工作、應爲設立赤色職工會、而求其得到切實之結果、因此黨内之ＷＤ（婦女部）亟應指導並援助全國紡織委員會並須助其草擬一工作計劃關于婦女委員會之重新設立、及其目前之工作、吾等亦正與全國勞工會共同進行、吾等已派婦女數人、往蘇帷埃區域、從事工作、但迄今尙未接得報告、</p>

<p>在運動未開以前、對於四百米冠軍無不以爲將屬之曁南曾榮忠、自前日四百米預賽以後、見關長發之步子、與關所跑時間、僅與曾榮忠相差五分之一、方以爲小曾有勁敵、更自曾榮忠以身體不舒、頭昏目眩、放棄二百米複賽後、識者以爲四百米錦標、小曾將發生危險、關長發有極大機會、因四百米跑跑長短俱有關係、苟身體不適女子標槍第一王慧貞之姿勢</p>
<p>（麗光攝）</p>
<p>萬難勝此劇烈競爭、昨日比賽結果、因不出所料、關君居然以五十三秒五分之三、名列第一、曾君經一番劇戰、雖幸得第二、但跑畢後、面孔失色、臥地不起者良久、經一番按摩、方能漸漸起立、後詢其故、知曾君數日來、消化不佳、腹部不適、據曁南體育指導言、曾君平時、對於食物一道、不甚注意、屢勸不聽常喜買零星小食、以故曾君之胃時感不適、實則飲食無節制之害也、日前曾君偕同江南田徑隊北征、在京亦曾以食物不愼而患腹瀉、故不能參加比賽、此事本報曾詳登其事、以後願曾君注意飮食之衛生、切勿任意亂吃、因運動員、在訓練時期、身體一有不適、非特不能進步、并亦不能保持現狀、且有退步、希曾君洋意之、</p>

<p>八百米决賽起跑者共十二人、第一圈時、周斌領導在前、約有五米之遥、直至第二圈轉灣、丘陵如方由後面趕上、至入看台前、丘君已在第一、陳行佩第二、周斌第三、夏憲誤第四、觀者無不以爲名次將定、不料夏君憲譔、後力甚佳、放大步子、直向前衝、趕過周斌、追上陳行佩、到逹終點時與丘君相距不遠、觀是組比賽、丘陵如常跑外圈、并在轉灣時、由外圈爭先、吃虧實爲不少、如丘君能注意此點、則成績當有進步、</p>

<p>張琥根、高麗產、身體結實、長短適合、爲練習運動最合適之體材、昨日參加千五百米决賽、自始至終爲馬首、緊緊追隨其後者爲朱少華君、兩人相去、不及數米、三圈跑下、前數人之位置、無大雙更、至第三圈轉灣後、在二百米直徑上、朱少華曾一度與張君之肩相接、但張君亦奮臂向上、并知此一段爲生死關頭、安肯一步放鬆、此時兩人之速度極大、將後面之人、抛去極遠、結果張君仍爲第一、朱君居第二、唐賢輈君居第三、陳行佩則屈居第四、有熟悉同濟大學内幕情形者言、唐君賢　、與張君琥根、同在同濟求學、張君日夕練習長跑、恒一人練習、後見唐君爲可操之才、乃時加鼓勵、並加以指敎、因此唐君之成績大進、如此則唐君爲張君之徒弟、無欵今日均名列前茅、可謂一門二傑、觀昨日唐君跑之姿勢、態度自然、步子輕鬆、實爲可之才、願唐君青出於藍、而勝於藍、將來能壓倒張君、此則記者所希望者也、</p>

<p>高欄人才、極難造就、數年來絕少新人才發現、上次萬國運動會時、新產生之陳國俊、此次又未曾加入、故是項决賽、絕少精彩、及格决賽之六人中、臨賽又少一個、故起步者僅五人、在未發脚前、曹裕君在跑道旁、用力做彎腰與伸腿動作、記者詢其何必如此用力、曹君云（腿部肌肉受傷、須多做是類動作、方能過欄不倒、）發脚後、祇見曹君速度極大、在四人以前頗遠、但連倒二欄、觀者無不爲之擔心、幸得天佑、難關重重過去、一過第一欄後、方爲之安心、到逹終線、爲時僅十七秒四、雖不能云佳、但在逆風與疏鬆之跑道上、已爲昨日各成績中優良之一項、回觀後面者、實相差頗遠、</p>
<h3 id="c102">男中欄 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>本市有中欄一項運動以來、爲時僅半年有餘、故練習是項運動者不甚普及、五人决賽中、除大毛（孫惠培）過終點前第二欄時、跌倒受傷外其餘均安得位置、陶英傑得第一、陳部章得第二、楊炳元得第三、張金鎔得第四、但成績不佳、較陶君於萬國運動會時所造之全國紀錄、實相差不少、并陶君跑時身體直立、頭向上、此係腹肌欠强、希陶君日後多練習腹部運動、及練習八百米跑冀於全運會時、與京市之陳陵一較上下、</p>

<p>鉛球</p>
<p>報名比賽者共十四人到者一半、缺席者亦是一半、眞是笑話、在七人之中、擲過九米者僅四人、大令人失望、陳寳球確係病傷元氣、僅擲十米零九、退居第三曹裕得第一、成績爲十米五十四與陳君在萬國運動會時之成績相差一米一奇、</p>

<p>近數年來、凡有大小運動會、三級跳一項、幾爲王季淮一人包辦、但昨日王君於第一試跳中、即跳傷足踝、從雖免强試跳、但終不能得相當成績、致脫位置、據王君云、如足踝因紐傷而發腫明日將不能參加五項或十項運動、如果成爲事實、則今日之全能運動中必因之而減少精彩、李琳君在暑期中、練習頗勤、故進步頗多、昨日以十三米零四、跳得第一、頗非易事、第二爲梁添成、第三爲劉夢齡、第四爲范家駒、成績均在十二米三十以上、</p>

<p>加入撑竿跳比賽之人數最少、足見此項運動之不易、昨日比賽、爭奪錦標者、咸知曹裕與李琳二人、跳至三米二十六時、餘子均淘汰、僅剩曹李二君、不意曹君於跳過三米二十六後、腿部舊傷之處、驟覺疼痛、因此中止競跳、李君乃不勞而獲第一、并亦由此一躍而與王季淮并列個人田賽第一、或曰李君吉心高照、</p>

<p>標槍一項、爲王季淮拿手好戲、但昨日王君以失敗聞、嘖嘖以爲怪事、後悉一如本報前日之預測中、王君因足疾缺少練習、致臂部肌肉退步、雖努力投擲、僅得四十三米有餘、爲劉家瑀君四十四米零七壓倒、退居第二、王君并以三級跳試跳在即、匆匆連擲數次、此亦爲失敗之小原因、但以記者眼光、此種情形實爲好現象、老將失敗、表明有後起之秀、</p>

<p>▲忙煞童子軍昨日在場服務之童子軍、人數較前日增加一倍有奇、除敎練外、約共一百十五人、然因場地廣闊、觀衆麕集、猶屬不敷分配、每當比賽之前、報告員必大呼（童子軍注意、）各隊員東奔西跑、其忙錄亦不亞於評判員及攝影者、更有若干觀衆、並不買票、擅自由籬笆隙間鑽入棒球場中、此進彼入、數實不少、致各童子軍維持秩序、每有顧此失彼之嘆、後經加添隊員、方始恢復原狀、</p>

<p>林邱未顯技能</p>
<p>特克較爲遜色</p>
<p>此次參加决賽之中英選手、均係網球界之巨擘、謂爲名家會串、洵不虚矣、德孚守門功夫、海上前所罕見、身高臂長、跳縱如飛、供球堅硬、不易抵擋、林書華對此失色、邱飛海尙能對付、羣雄之首、當之無愧、林寳華之拿手發球、失其勁力、而壓球與欄網、尙能稱心如意、邱飛海之得意抽擊、不恒多見、惟步法迅速、占位得當、總之、兩人生平絶技、在後之三盤内、方逐漸發現、但仍未至登蜂造極耳特克成績、較爲遜色、尤其在光線黑暗之際、目光純呆、大受應響、以致功虧一簣、</p>

<p>▲一綫生機林邱勝得一盤、生氣勃發、細雨打面、作戰依然、雙方形勢緊張、勝負互見、中華一綫生機之轉來、厥在三四局面之下、其中經過之曲折、奮鬥之努力、觀者心馳目眩、賽者心驚肉跳、而表演精彩、尤爲全局之冠、連打十五次平手、方被中華奪來、造成四四和數、後此林邱居上風、又以七比五勝第四盤、</p>

<p>紗市在上週問毫無榮辱可分、市勢極其散漫、以底盤關係、新抛者較缺少、然大勢狀况十分惡劣、時局流言孔繁、致人心未受若何影響、完全係底價太估所致也、且大戶抛賣做空心思未絕、某巨商復逢跌扒空、日商某洋行視中國水災嚴重、將後實銷恐受極大打擊、所以心思萬分看低、抛出之額頗巨、被其壓迫甚力、至於華商大數意態仍消極然猛力抛賣者較爲缺乏、故在此週中擯持甚堅、週末美棉情形甚軟、而三品紗趨漲、引起獲利者扒空、市盤遂漲、結果標紗各月比上週漲一兩外、客帮中現紗銷路益覺岑寂、各方全無大量生氣、期紗日商開出不少、價格較廉均係日商洋行接受、紗市前途、仍缺把握、不過世界棉業狀况、尙在悲境中去、</p>

<p>王延松昨日演講</p>
<p>本市第三區黨部、昨日上午十時、敦請市黨部監察委員·市商會常務委員·王延松君、在南京路大中華電器公司無線電播音臺演講黨義、王氏講題、爲發展工商業與勞資協調、演詞云、今天承本市第三區黨部、邀請鄙人到此、在大中華電器公司自裝的無線電播音臺面前、來和全市的父老兄弟諸姑姊妹、作一度間接的談話、什麽呌做間接的談話呢、因爲各位現在祇能聞其聲而不能見其貌、這與普通的直接聽講是不同的、不過鄙人覺得無論那一次偉大的市民大會中、那聽講的、决没有像今天聽講的這樣衆多、所以鄙人今天、雖然没有和諸位見面、但是心中是非常愉快、非常興奮的、今天鄙人所欲講的一個題目、是（發展工商業與勞資協調）、因爲這個問題、是非常重要、不但是關及工商業的本身、並且對於整個民族的生死存亡、也有很密切的關係、所以特地提出來、知大家商榷、現在講到這（發展工商業與勞資協調）一個題目、我們就應該拿他分爲二部份來看、一部份是（發展工商業）、一部份是勞資協調）、但是爲什麽要把這兩部份放在一起講呢、因爲一個是（因）、一個是（果）、換句話、就是（勞資協調）是（因）、發展工商業是（果）、我們現在假使不能先解决勞資協調這一個問題、而欲勉强來求工商業的發展、那末、不啻是緣木求魚、萬萬不可能的、現在我們中國、内憂外患、天災人禍、交互而來、弄得焦頭爛額、不堪言狀、至於講到國内的工商業、實在是没有生氣之可言、而勞資雙方、還是不能夠互相諒解、互相合作、大家看、那一天報上没有勞資糾紛的事件、那一天没有罷工歇業的事情、但是每一件不幸的勞資爭議事件發生、他的結果、總是兩敗俱傷、没有一方面能夠佔到便宜的、這種社會病、倘使不迅即醫治完善、那末、不但工商業没有發展的希望、恐怕固有的工商業、還要掃地無餘呢、不但列强的經濟侵略不能抵抗、恐后他的力量、還要一天加烈一天呢、所以鄙人敢大膽的肯定的說、現在中國的工商業、倘使再閙着勞資糾紛的事件、這就是自趨滅亡、自尋死路了、總理孫中山先生曾經說過、資本家改良工人的生活、增加工人的生產力、工人有了大生產力、便爲資本家多生產、在資本家一方面可以多得出產、在工人一方面也可以多得工錢、這是資本家和工人的利害相調和、不是相衝突、社會之所以有進化、是由於社會上大多數的經濟利益相調和、不是由於社會上大多數的經濟益有衝突、社會上大多數的經濟利益相調和、就是爲大多數謀利益、大多數有利益、社會才有進步、這一番話、總理不是已經指示了勞資應該協調、和如何協調的大道嗎、但是總理還繼續着說、（中國並没有資本家、祇有大貧小貧之分、中國勞資雙方、應該努力於同一目標之下、來對付列强的帝國主義）、我們由此可知、現在社會上所盛行的勞資糾紛、實在是不應該發現的、說得痛快一些、實在是還没有發生勞資糾紛的資格、鄙人講到這裡、不禁要奉勸勞資兩方幾句話、站在勞方地位的人、千萬不要一味的要求增加工資·減少工作時間·和改良待遇等等、應該要體念國内工商業衰敗零落的實情、切實與資方合作、努力共圖發展、一心一德的來抵禦列强的經濟侵略、倘使拿了很苛刻的條件來强迫資方答應、資方勉强答應後、如果不能維持他的事業、那末祇有倒閉一法、試問倒閉之後、許多工友、將何以爲生、聽說前數年、杭州的各絲廠織綢廠工人、因爲要求加工資、减時間、弄得各廠無法維持、先後倒閉數十家、後來有許多工人、無處謀生、祇可降身而爲各種苦力、比了工廠原有的報酬和生活、還要苦幾倍、這不是自取其咎嗎、所以古人有句話、（皮之不存、毛將焉附）、我親愛的工友們、不可不三味此言、再說站在資方地位的人、也應該體恤工友的地方、凡是做工友的人、他們的生活、大都是很困難的、資方應該隨時隨刻、極力設法、增進和改善工友的生活、切不可採用壓迫的手段、更不可存着剥削的念頭、凡有利益、就應該公開享受、假使能夠這樣開誠布公的對待工友、那末勞資雙方、没有不可合作的地方、總而言之、資方没有勞方、勞方没有資方、都是不能夠獨立存在的、兩者是相互而生、相依爲命、倘使我國現在的勞資兩方、能夠接納鄙人的勸告、共同努力於本身工商業的發展、那末、不但是固有的工商業、可以欣欣向榮、就是新興的事業、一定可以像春笱筍的暴發、那時、中國工商業前途、大放光彩、何難抵禦列强的經濟侵略於千里之外呢、完了、</p>

<p>晚近流行之名詞。多有從英字譯音而起者。而此項譯音之發源地。强半出自上海。蓋滬上開風氣之先。聞見較廣。獨有一物出現。一時無以名之。遂以諧聲便利。展轉稱呼。寢假成爲普通名詞矣。如電話又稱德律風。即係英字Telephone之譯音是也。惟有時滬音。與内地及遠省語音不同。而一般不識英文原字者。讀音每多歧誤。例如冬令取暖之水汀。即係Steam譯音。其意義爲水蒸氣。在滬上（水）讀（死）。與原音初無二致。但以江北音或官音讀之。則（水）不讀（死）。即與原字不脗合。且水汀往往易與水門汀相混。疑爲水門汀之簡寫。其誤更甚。殊不知水門汀爲水泥。係Cement之譯音。特以當初諧聲不甚準確。致與今日水汀同二字。實則應譯音爲（西門特）。迺無甚出入耳。又如（沙發）椅以滬音（沙）讀（梳）。與原字sofa發音本相符合。但江北及遠省人讀之。則又不同。西藥嗎啡（Morphine）。以滬音（嗎）讀（茂）。故相符。又派司（Pass）以滬音（派）讀（怕）。亦與原意相同。若易地讀之。均非本音矣。是不可不留意也。嗣後滬上對於名詞之發明。似以參用官音譯之爲宜。未可悉作蘇滬語音。以免他處發音不同。聲調互異。例如劇詞上之字音。非用平楚等地口音歌之。不可。如以滬音唱之。則不免有（小東人闖下了）唱爲（小東寗闖餓了）之弊。質之滬上士女。以爲何如。</p>
<p>其他流行名詞。如（邏輯）爲Logic之譯音。其意義爲文法上之論理。近有一般淺見之流。誤以邏輯爲人名。其誤孰甚。甚有内地小學校敎師。亦不知究竟。末由解釋。以訛傳訛。誤人子弟。尤宜注意。辭而闢之爲要。又如（迪克推多）爲Sictator之譯音。似爲有指揮能力的首領之意。又（杯葛）兩字爲Boycott之譯音。近世文字上常有（杯葛問題）等字。即係抵制外貨問題之意。但Ｂoycott譯音爲（杯葛）。殊嫌牽强。似出自北省人所譯。然吾人知其來源爲譯音。亦可不作過分之吹求。惟若鎭江人讀之。則（葛）字讀作（夾）字土音。直與原字大相逕庭。令人聞之。一時不解。研究方方者不可不加注意也。（移酬作賑）</p>

<p>戲劇學專家洪深氏。曾於今春渡美。他的任務。是爲明星影片公司購置新機·聘請演員·并考察美國電影事業。他在好萊塢Hollywood住了幾時。留心研究。心得頗多。說起這好萊塢三個字來。大家都知道它是美國電影藝術的發祥地。也是電影事業的特别區。許多著名的明星·導演家。都集中在一地。他們的生活很奢靡·浪漫·而且很神秘。因此好萊塢地方。也移風易俗。比别處就大不相同了。最近有許多電影業者。申請電影業領袖們。整理好萊塢裁减明星及導演駭人聽聞的薪水。而節省貽人笑柄的靡費。以爲這麽一來。可以促成一個比較平民化的好萊塢。但事實上能否做到。還是疑問。洪深氏現在已經歸國了。我便叩以好萊塢影業的現狀。據說美國近年因爲生產過剩。經濟衰落。失業者衆。影業也大受影鄕。頗爲一落千丈之勢。現在把他的話。介紹给讀者。</p>
<p>美國電影家近來頗注意於（聲音情感化）。意思就是有聲片中除歌唱·音樂以外。如對白·說話。不但要聲音清晣。而且要使說話的聲音。曲折婉轉。曲折婉轉。都能表示出情感來。這不是輕易成功的事。第一要訓練演員發音的聲調與正確。所以各大影片公司特聘發音學敎師。專司指導之責。舊日默片明星（默片即無聲片）現在都已没落。有人以胡蝶女士來比（畢克福）。Mary　Pickford聞者大爲詫異。（畢克福）雖曾紅過多時。到如今已向浸落隊伍中去了。（白萊蒙）Lionel　BarryMore以舊日舞台的經騐而大世功。新片（自由之靈）。Ａ　Ｆree　Sonl便是他的得意之作。電影演員爲了練習發音學。而預備的時間較久。故在佈景時間。即已在場上續戲。這是公司方面爲時間經濟的補救方法。</p>
<p>中國各大戲院的設備。簡直没有一家能與美國上等戲院相比較。常有在外國已經認爲陳舊的映戲機器。稍加修改。便運到中國來。裝置在最上等的戲院裏。所以講到發音方面。中國戲院比外國戲院差得很遠。其他更不必說了。</p>

<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>李夫人也明知常常受陳先生的金錢與東西，不是一件妥當的事。雖然陳先生是自願送伊而並不是伊所要求的。伊覺得萬一被丈夫知道了，那是一定會爆裂一個開花炮出來的，而旁人也一定不會諒解、自己將來一定做着一個全社會所吐棄的人了。但是伊的境况實在窘迫，並且眞不能把陳先生的美意拒絕，假使拒絕了、一定會使陳先生不快活，自己也不知道爲什麽對於丈夫越加冷淡，對於丈夫的一個朋友，反這樣密切而希望他愉快。伊不敢正式和先生提出離婚，因爲雖婚了以後，不一定能正式嫁给陳先生，陳先生是有妻子的人，他的妻子又是很兇惡的，假使我不離婚而秘密和陳先生變愛，那是不但對不起丈夫，實在也對不起自己的身份與名譽。照目有的情形，伊自己很知道，並且彼此都了解，眞的已走到了戀愛的梯階，他們居然能克制自己，不曾做過一回戀愛的表現，但是各人的心影裏，都已把愛苗栽植得很高很大了。他們都曾忖量過，這是偉大而忠實的？抑是一件罪惡？她們還在瞻顧，徘徊，蓄勢，不敢衝上前綫去；他們所覊絆的，還是社會上相沿用的一種舊道德。</p>
<p>李先生和陳夫人究竟是浪漫派，他們的見解，與陳先生及李夫人是相反的，伊覺得夫婦的關係，假使没有眞摰的戀愛而僅限於名義的束縛，那是不道德的；不妨在束縛的名義以外，再找一個適宜的對象、所以李先生吻伊手的時候，伊不拒絕，在電影院中黑暗着吻伊的額角，伊也很愉快的接受，在跳舞擁抱得很緊的時候，伊也向他甜笑，此外還有什麽的愛的表現、伊當然也不會使李先生感到什麽不愉快或懊喪的了。他們不曾想到一個是有夫之婦，一個是有婦之夫，在不曾離婚而私自地另外戀愛、爲法律人情所不許，他們只覺得任情所至，不加遏抑，但是他們都不敢在丈夫——或妻子面前透露消息，並且不敢被社會上任何人知道、究竟還受着一種覊絆，這是社會上沿用着舊道德的一種潛勢力。</p>

<p>Traces Seemingly Visible on the Riverbank</p>
<p>Drainage Project Still Difficult to Start</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water has receded about thirteen inches, and traces seem to be visible on the riverbank. Citizens are eagerly hoping for drainage. Bai Langdu, who is responsible for planning the drainage, arrived in Hankou on the 13th and stated that the river water is still higher than the bank, making drainage impossible to start. It must be implemented slightly later. In addition, the water inside the Dan Shui Pond embankment is seven inches higher than outside the embankment. After measurement by the Water Conservancy Bureau, it was agreed with the Pinghan Railway Bureau to excavate a section of the roadbed between Dazhimen and the riverbank on the 13th for discharge. The Pinghan trains will still use ferries from Hong'an Wharf to the riverbank. The Hongshan shelter has been completed, and all Wuhan disaster victims can be moved there on the 16th.

<p>Central Government Still Does Not Forget Peace</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: The Guangdong-Guangxi invasion of Hunan has become a reality. Tan Lianfang, Li Pinxian, and Liao Lei have advanced west from Guilin, and their vanguard has reached Quanzhou and other places. Chen Tiejian's Fifth Independent Brigade of the Guangdong Army has been transported to Yongxing, with the appearance of eyeing Leiyang. Tang Shengzhi arrived in Chenzhou on the 11th, and Li Yangjing's troops of the Guangdong Army arrived in Chenzhou.

He Jian will personally inspect the defenses in Hengbao in the coming days. (13th day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person said that the reason for the Guangdong-Guangxi invasion of Hunan was to take advantage of the central government's troops being engaged in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi to invade Hunan. The Guangdong-Guangxi troops in the Chen (zhou) area of southern Hunan are Tang Shengzhi's troops, but only several thousand, and their gun supply is difficult. Our Fourth Route Army has consolidated its defenses in Hengzhou and Baoqing. If necessary, troops engaged in suppressing bandits in Gan (Jiangxi) can also be transferred. There is no need to worry. (13th day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain source, the vanguard of the Guangdong-Guangxi troops eyeing Hunan has reached the line of Leiyang and Qiyang. Our defensive works between Heng and Bao (Qing) are extremely solid. The various armies on the front line are still guarding their respective defense areas. (13th day special dispatch)</p>

The Hunan border bandits Yan Renyi, Hu Fengzhang, and Chen Tiejian have all been appointed as newly编师 (newly organized division) or independent brigade commanders to invade Yi and Chen. However, the Eighth Route Army only has 40,000, and Zhang Gui's troops have just over 10,000. The new recruits after the rebellion have not been trained. The guns purchased in Shanghai were seized. They are powerless. The Hunan affairs will not greatly hinder the suppression of bandits. The various armies are still in their original defenses clearing bandits. Wuhan is extremely peaceful.

The banditry in Hunan Province has not been cleared, and natural disasters have followed. Saving the dying is not enough to focus on, and recovery is greatly needed. Guangdong and Guangxi are taking advantage of our disaster to raise troops and rebel. Although righteousness lies with us, rebellion will eventually be quickly destroyed.

<h3 id="e16">Truth About the Nakamura Incident <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Worthless Rouges are Responsible for Suicide</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Uses This Excuse to Carry Out Aggression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Japanese side's wording regarding the Nakamura Incident, someone witnessed Nakamura and his party of four arriving at Lord E's Mansion on June 24. Suddenly, at night, there was a burst of barking dogs, followed by a team of cavalry. All four were arrested at the same time. From the 25th to the 27th, they were under surveillance. At 6 PM on the 28th, Nakamura's group was escorted by thirteen soldiers to the depths of the mountains northeast of the Xing'an District. After four hours, around 10 PM, the escorting soldiers descended the mountain, and the four of Nakamura were nowhere to be seen. Afterwards, a Japanese woman married to a Chinese man first leaked the news. After an investigation by the Japanese side, it was learned that they had been victimized. Nakamura had 3,000 yuan in Heilongjiang banknotes, a Nambu pistol, and a gold watch with him. Later, the gold watch was taken by the soldiers, and the whereabouts of the pistol are unknown. According to the results of the first investigation by our country's Northeast authorities, Nakamura Reitaro was an army captain of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters. He traveled to the Xing'an District from Harbin in early June. Before departing from Harbin, the local Japanese consulate did not notify our country's officials. The entry procedures were extremely incomplete. Moreover, the Xing'an District of Liaoning Province has many bandits, and foreigners have disappeared. It has always been a forbidden area for foreigners to travel. Mr. Nakamura only obtained a transit pass from the former Liaoning Foreign Affairs Commissioner's Office. The transit pass stated that travel was not allowed outside the Xing'an District. Nakamura concealed his military status. When applying for the transit pass, he falsely claimed to be an educator researching history and geography. If he was researching history and geography, how could he carry firearms and not follow the route specified on the passport, venturing into bandit areas? Whether he was victimized has not been found out. According to news leaked by Nakamura's friend, Nakamura was a retired lower-ranking military officer, a worthless rogue. He escaped from Harbin after gambling heavily and incurring debts. To avoid being pursued by creditors, this trip to the Xing'an District may have been a suicide. The Japanese side has gone beyond the norms of international diplomacy, not speaking to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but lodging a protest with the Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government. This has been noted by diplomatic consuls of various countries. Moreover, they are openly calling for the destruction of the Northeast regime, taking advantage of this opportunity to permanently secure Japan's existing rights. Please take immediate action by the government to stop any country's military aggression in order to maintain peace in the East. (13th day special dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Question of Clothing for Disaster Victims in the Future <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>It has been more than two months since the water disaster occurred. More than two months of time. For those who live in peace, it is naturally just a fleeting moment. However, for the disaster victims floating in the water waiting to die, every minute and every second is a long and unbearable year. The call for disaster relief has already echoed through the clouds. We ask ourselves, how much has the disaster situation been reduced today, two months later? How many disaster victims have been rescued?</p>
<p>The autumn wind has risen. The disaster victims have added another layer of cold persecution to their bodies. Soaked in water and hungry, surrounded by extremely tragic scenes, and further attacked by the cold. We dare not think about the tragic situation of the hundreds of millions of compatriots in the disaster area who are now in the hell on earth. We cannot bear to think about it. However, this hell is indeed present in the human world before our eyes.</p>
<p>We must not think that because the water has gradually receded recently, the disaster situation has been alleviated, and the disaster relief work can be casually forgotten in our minds. In fact, the problems after the water recedes are more serious than when the water rises. Because when the water is high, everyone is determined to wait (for death). Now that the water has made way for everyone to have a chance to live, everyone is trying to seek (life) again. The problem of being determined to wait for death is simple. If one cannot seek life, then the situation is extremely tragic and serious. We should understand the disaster victims' struggle to survive and intensify disaster relief efforts.</p>
<p>This year's annual meeting of the China Economic Society discussed the palliative and radical methods of disaster relief. The disaster relief opinion submitted stated: "As for the shortage of cotton production in our country this year, the government has not yet reported. According to recent estimates by experts, the total cotton demand of the country each year is 11 million dan. In addition to what can be supplied domestically, there is still a shortage of four to five million dan. Therefore, in addition to the government finding ways to purchase and borrow food, cotton industry colleagues should also work together to purchase and borrow foreign cotton and coarse cloth to supplement the government's inadequacy. If the government can provide guarantees, it would be very good. Otherwise, it would also benefit both the public and private sectors if the industry automatically negotiated loans." This opinion is really the only urgent method in the current cries of coldness of disaster victims.</p>
<p>Although our country is based on agriculture, in the past ten years or so, not only has food relied on foreign countries, but it has also become a country lacking clothing. According to customs investigations, from 1929 to March 1930, the value of clothing and cotton fabrics imported from foreign countries was 173,359,322 customs taels. Cotton: 67,981,417. Woolen fabrics: 48,380,799. Silk fabrics: 28,824,775. Linen fabrics: 22,902,101. Cotton yarn: 16,706,616. Leather goods: 12,545,789. Buttons: 1,173,122. The total is 371,873,941 customs taels. It is estimated that 70 million people in our country rely on foreign cotton or cotton fabrics to keep warm every year. Speaking of the cotton planting areas in our country, although it is said that they range from Fengtian, Jehol, and Mongolia in the north to Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi in the south, the main producing areas are in the two major basins of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. In recent years, the cotton planting area in the Yangtze River basin has accounted for about 65% of the total cotton planting area in the country, and the Yellow River basin has accounted for about 34%. The production in other regions is minimal and unimportant. According to the investigation of the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation, the average cotton field area and output in the ten years from 1920 to 1929 were: Jiangsu: 9,144,520 mu, 2,163,025 dan. Anhui: 827,793 mu, 161,444 dan. Jiangxi: 513,018 mu, 21,569 dan. Hubei: 6,752,680 mu, 1,430,230 dan. The situation is very different this year. Although the disaster in the Yellow River basin is said to be lighter, the cotton fields in the above provinces are all along the Yangtze River. Since the disaster, floods have occurred everywhere, and there is no cotton harvest. Mulberry trees have been flooded and damaged. The silk and cotton production is almost zero. And most of the clothes of the disaster victims have been washed away with the houses. Now that autumn has arrived and severe winter is coming in an instant, the hunger problem has now been agreed to be solved by borrowing American wheat. And the surplus grain in the Northeast is also enough to help a part of them. There is still a glimmer of hope. What about the cold? If we only save the disaster victims from hunger, but not from the cold, then even if the disaster victims are lucky enough to avoid dying of hunger, they will surely die of cold. This serious problem that comes with the autumn cool should be planned for early.</p>
<p>Our opinions on the relief methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Purchase and borrow cotton and coarse cloth from the United States.</p>
<p>(2) Offer the remaining broken military uniforms from the entire country's armies.</p>
<p>(3) Donate broken clothing factory cloth on a large scale.</p>
<p>In short, putting ourselves in their shoes, the hunger and cold of the disaster victims, and the relief methods, anyone can imagine. If you can imagine it, you have to do it seriously. What the disaster victims are waiting to die for is real food and clothing, not lengthy proposals. (Sitting and talking is not as good as standing and acting.) If we don't save the disaster victims, then that's it. If we want to save them, we must be quick and do it in accordance with the plan. Turn the written plan into facts, one by one.

<p>British Newspapers Deem It Inappropriate</p>
<p>Instigating Koreans to Abuse and Kill Our Overseas Compatriots</p>
<p>Japan Completely Ignores This ▲ Translated by the World Society, the English-language Japan Chronicle of Kobe published an editorial stating that some Japanese military personnel lack a sense of discipline. In other countries, military personnel do not discuss politics, considering it outside their purview. Even in Japan, military personnel are relatively uninvolved in party politics. However, when there is an opportunity to beat the drums of war, they are unwilling to let it go. The recent Nakamura Incident proves that the military is an extremely dangerous element in Japanese politics. The most egregious example is Minister of the Army Minami, who, during the period when the civil authorities had banned newspapers from publishing the case, gave inflammatory speeches to the division commanders, which were then disclosed by the newspapers. Naturally, his subordinates quickly followed suit, and for a time, the so-called hard-line stance towards China rose up in a roar. Some even advocated occupying certain key areas in Manchuria and Mongolia before the case was resolved to ensure a victorious resolution. Others advocated using force to collect evidence. If force is needed to collect evidence, it is tantamount to admitting that after all the fanfare, sufficient evidence for the case has not yet been found. In Dalian, war fever is running high. A grand gathering was held in a certain theater, with military personnel giving speeches, exaggerating the Nakamura Incident and inciting the audience to demand revenge. These military personnel, whose profession is war, naturally think of getting rich through war. Therefore, they took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and no one restrained them. Why?</p>
<p>It has been found that Nakamura and another military man traveling with him were both dressed in civilian clothes and their passports did not state that they were military personnel. It is said that the two were captured and killed by Chinese soldiers, and the Japanese military circles considered it a disgrace to the Japanese army. How can military personnel traveling in civilian clothes expect their military status to be respected? It is certainly inappropriate for Chinese soldiers to kill them, but it is also questionable whether they were actually Chinese soldiers, as there is also a theory that they were killed by bandits. If they were killed by bandits, the Chinese government should be held responsible for managing bandits. However, the degree of responsibility borne by the Chinese government is different if they were killed by bandits versus soldiers. Moreover, military personnel wearing civilian clothes are quite suspicious, so the responsibility is greatly reduced compared to killing a military officer carrying a formal travel passport. All these considerations are completely ignored in all the gatherings dedicated to stirring up war fever. However, how can the Japanese government decide on a response before these considerations have been studied? How can military personnel or non-military personnel demand revenge, occupation, and the use of force?</p>
<p>Another matter that has been completely ignored is the Korean riots against the Chinese, for which a major international negotiation has not yet been resolved. If the killing of one or two military personnel in a sparsely populated area is considered cruel, then how much more cruel is the attack and abuse of dozens or even hundreds of citizens and long-term residents engaged in legitimate businesses, and the destruction of all their property? The Japanese government has already acknowledged its mistake in the Korean riots and is providing compensation, but the Chinese government is not satisfied, so negotiations are still ongoing. The Chinese side has proposed sending troops to Korea to protect overseas Chinese, which is merely a response to the Japanese side's repeated calls for increasing troops in Manchuria and Mongolia to protect Japanese residents. In short, if a fair judgment is made on these two incidents, the Chinese side should be far more agitated than the Japanese side. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also aware of this. If the matter were entirely under the control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a reasonable resolution could be reached. However, the military is forcefully taking the lead, interfering with diplomacy, making wild claims, and stirring up national agitation, which is very dangerous.</p>

<p>France Submits Detailed List of Armaments to the League of Nations</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 12th. Secretary of State Kellogg recently gave a speech at the League of Nations Assembly, advocating a suspension of naval construction to set a good example and create an atmosphere of trust. With the burden of armaments lightened, commercial impediments can also be reduced soon. After the proposal was made, the United States showed a friendly national sentiment. Today, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Borah requested the government to announce a five-year suspension of naval construction and advocated that Britain promote this movement so that the world's taxpayers can temporarily lighten their burden. Observers attach great importance to Borah's move because in 1921 Borah proposed convening an arms conference, and the White House eventually adopted his proposal, leading to the Washington Conference.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 13th. Today, the League of Nations Secretariat received a detailed list of armaments from France, stating that in 1931, the troops stationed in France totaled 286,342 officers and soldiers, compared to 513,643 in 1921. In 1931, the troops stationed in the colonies, including native soldiers, totaled 231,405 officers and soldiers, compared to 313,588 in 1921. The French Navy totaled 628,603 tons, and the Air Force totaled 32,110 personnel with 1,210 aircraft. The Air Force stationed abroad totaled 8,398 personnel with 395 aircraft.</p>

<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>Telegram from Nanchang to the Shen Bao Newspaper, the Government of Nanchang respectfully submits a telegram to the Central Government: Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, This water disaster in Jiangxi Province is extremely severe. Previously, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Duchang, Wuning, Yongxiu, Poyang, Hukou, Xinjian, Pengze, Yugan, De'an, Jinxian, Ruichang, Xingzi, and Anyi counties telegraphed to report on the disaster situation. We telegraphed on the eighth of August to request that the Central Government quickly issue relief funds and send personnel to the disaster areas to investigate the disaster, comfort the refugees, provide emergency relief, and pay attention to their welfare. This has all been recorded. Subsequently, Shanggao, Jing'an, Leping, and Wannian counties reported on the disaster situation. The personnel sent to the disaster areas also submitted reports on their investigations. The extent of the disaster area, the number of victims, and the severity of the disaster are unprecedented in history. The investigators traveled through all the areas and saw floods sweeping the land, huge waves raging, hundreds of miles of land submerged, and the dead floating in the water. The living were displaced and living in the open, exposed to the elements, resulting in countless deaths from starvation and disease. If emergency relief is not provided, they will die from water, starvation, or disease, without exception. Currently, the water level along the rivers and lakes is still rising. In addition, mountain floods are following from upstream, further exacerbating the situation. We cannot bear the suffering of our people. In addition to the relief plan that has been discussed and is being implemented, a disaster relief association will be organized by all sectors of the province to provide assistance. We have also sent telegrams requesting relief and will submit a detailed report on the investigation. We respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration.</p>
<p>Telegram from Zhenjiang to All Newspapers, We are all aware of the telegram reporting the disaster situation along the canal and calling for assistance. We invite you to carefully examine the situation. After inspecting the area downstream of the river, we found that the severity of the disaster is no less than that upstream, and the need for relief is even more urgent. In the counties of eastern Jiangsu, the terrain is low-lying, and all the fields and houses have been submerged. The dikes and river channels are unrecognizable, and boats are often obstructed, making it difficult for relief workers to reach all the victims. Many victims are unable to escape the suffering of hunger and cold, and their condition is pitiful. Taixian has suffered greatly, and many refugees from neighboring counties have gathered there. Both relief grain and funds are insufficient, and the hope for assistance is urgent. We respectfully submit this telegram for your attention. Gao Yihan and Hong Lanyou.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Jiangsu Province Requests an Allocation of 6 Million Yuan in Disaster Relief Bonds <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association believes that Jiangsu Province has suffered severely from the disaster and is short of funds. The association telegraphed the National Government Flood Relief Commission the other day, requesting a prior allocation of 6 million yuan from the disaster relief bonds issued to provide relief. The telegram is as follows: (To the Shanghai National Government Flood Relief Commission, Since the beginning of summer, Jiangsu Province has experienced continuous rainy seasons, with simultaneous floods from the Huai River and tides. Low-lying areas in counties along the Yangtze River and the Huai River have turned into swamps. Until the end of last month, the Gao Bao Canal embankment suddenly reported danger, with more than 20 breaches occurring one after another, creating a situation like a downpour, sweeping away thousands of miles in an instant. As a result, counties along the canal downstream were washed away within a few days, with people, livestock, fields, and houses being completely swept away. People were displaced and destitute, either clinging to trees and wailing or looking out at the ocean and begging for their lives. The situation is dire. This is not just the suffering experienced by the victims themselves, but also the descriptions of the situation in the disaster area from provincial committee members, who were actually hoarse with grief and tears. The tragedy of the disaster is unimaginable. Telegrams have been sent repeatedly calling for assistance, which we believe has been noted. We are now raising funds from various sources and have hired impartial people from the province to successively organize the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association and the Jiangbei Flood Temporary Relief Association to work together. At the same time, the various departments of the provincial government have jointly formed this association, which began operating on the first of this month in the provincial government building, hoping to connect with all parties and coordinate everything. In total, 50 counties in Jiangsu Province have been affected by the disaster this year. To date, the funds obtained from official and voluntary relief efforts are no more than hundreds of thousands of yuan, including the 130,000 yuan allocated by the central government. With such a small amount, it is impossible to meet the needs of the disaster area in dozens of counties and millions of victims. At present, only three emergency relief distributions have been made to the counties with the most severe disasters, and more than 400,000 yuan have already been spent. In addition, the cost of transporting ships, grain, flour, and receiving refugees is high. It is difficult to continue with such a small amount of funds. The disaster is severe and the funds are insufficient, causing great anxiety. Some say that Jiangsu Province has often been described as having average harvests in recent years, and that the people of Jiangbei may have savings. These are speculative words and are not worth refuting. However, this year's situation is different from the past. When the floodwaters were overflowing, it was a time of great human struggle. We endured the pain of opening the dams, but the water level remained high. We tried to protect the dikes, but dangerous areas still emerged. One side collapsed, and the people were swept away. The elderly, women, and children could not even protect themselves, let alone their other property. This is what we must cry out for the victims. Also, the flood in the tenth year of the Republic was also severe, but the dams leading to the sea were only opened after the autumn harvest, so early-maturing crops could still be harvested. At that time, each county in Xinghua and Taixian received hundreds of thousands of yuan in relief funds, but this was still not enough to completely alleviate the disaster. This year, the disaster situation in the counties along the canal is even more severe. There has been no harvest of grain. The frost season is approaching. The cries of hunger have not yet ceased, and soon there will be cries of cold. The old and weak will have the sorrow of ending up in ditches, and the young and strong will have the thought of becoming bandits. To rescue the disaster, settle the aftermath, prevent problems, and be prepared for the future, this is what we must plan for the sake of local security. The disaster is tragic and urgent relief is needed. In addition to the efforts of this association to raise funds and the continued efforts of the provincial government to discuss plans for industrial and winter relief efforts, and to handle matters such as lending seeds and protecting cattle, we respectfully request that you consider the difficult situation of disaster relief in Jiangsu Province this year and approve a prior allocation of 6 million yuan from the disaster relief funds issued this time to provide relief and assistance, and to spread the benefits widely. This is the hope that the Central Government will show generosity and that your association will provide generous assistance. We are deeply concerned about this matter and earnestly pray for your favorable response. We are Jiangsu Flood Relief Association sincerely request.)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Canal Shipping Has Been Temporarily Restored <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Shipping Association, entrusted by the Jiangbei Flood Temporary Relief Association, has, in accordance with the original Jiangsu Provincial Government-approved transportation plan, been operating one Zhen-You and one Zhen-Qing service daily since the 13th, and will add one Zhen-Tai service and two Zhen-Xi services daily starting from the 16th. In addition to transporting relief grain and ferrying victims, these transportation services will also sell tickets, with all proceeds going to disaster relief. The temporary measures stipulated by the Relief Association are as follows: (1) The transportation services will focus on transporting refugees and relief grain, and transmitting news from the disaster area. Passengers will be carried as an attachment, and a standard will be set for donations to aid disaster relief. (2) The transportation services will depart every morning at 8:00 AM for the Zhen-You and Zhen-Tai services, and at 12:00 PM for the Zhen-Qing service, with the downstream departure times being the same. (3) The fare for passenger tickets will be determined separately, and all proceeds will be donated to the relief fund of this association. Passenger tickets will be named "Donation Passports." Refugees will be given free passes to board the ships. (4) Ten tugboats and ten barges owned by various Zhenjiang shipping companies will be designated as transportation service vessels. (5) The Fuyun, Zhengtong, and Xiehe offices in Zhenjiang will be designated as ticket sales locations, named the Jiangbei Flood Temporary Relief Association Transportation Offices. (6) The income and expenses of the transportation offices will be reported to this association daily for review and published in the newspapers daily. (7) Any staff member on the ship who privately carries passengers or engages in corruption will be treated as embezzlement of disaster relief funds, and will be sent to the authorities for severe punishment. (8) These transportation measures are temporary in nature. Once the transportation of relief supplies in the disaster area gradually decreases, it will be handed over to the shipping association to be managed by the various shipping companies, and the transportation services will be revoked. (9) This method will be communicated by this association to the provincial government for transmission to the civil affairs department to order all counties to provide effective protection and to inform the public.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters Launches Clothing Donation Drive <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Sends Circular Telegram to All County Party Headquarters, Setting a Deadline for Implementation</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters sent a circular telegram to all county party headquarters, stating: "All county party headquarters are aware that the flood disaster in our province is exceptionally severe, with millions of victims suffering from hunger and cold, urgently awaiting rescue. The provision of food supplies has already been undertaken by various agencies and organizations. However, as the weather is gradually turning colder, the victims lack clothing to ward off the cold. Merely having food is still insufficient to prevent them from dying of exposure. Such a large-scale clothing donation effort cannot realistically rely on government provisions under these difficult circumstances. Therefore, this headquarters is launching a clothing donation drive in all counties of the province. Enclosed is a copy of the 'Measures for Jiangsu Province Counties to Donate Clothing to Aid Flood Victims.' All county party headquarters are instructed to comply with these measures and report back accordingly." Sincerely, Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee. The appended measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Before the donation drive, each county party headquarters should instruct its subordinates to hold a "Clothing Donation Drive to Aid Flood Victims Propaganda Week."</p>
<p>(2) Each county party headquarters should, upon receiving this order, immediately plan and instruct its subordinates to hold the aforementioned Propaganda Week, which should be completed no later than September 24th.</p>
<p>(3) After the Propaganda Week is held in each county, all county party members and mass organizations should be mobilized to solicit clothing donations.</p>
<p>(4) When soliciting clothing donations, each county party headquarters should prepare registration forms for donors to fill out for verification purposes. Each county party headquarters should prepare these registration forms immediately upon receiving this order.</p>
<p>(5) In soliciting clothing donations, the emphasis should be on quantity. All clothing, shoes, socks, hats, bedding, and other items, regardless of how old or worn, are welcome.</p>
<p>(6) All clothing and other items donated in each county should be listed in detail along with the registration forms by the respective county party headquarters, and forwarded to the Provincial Relief Association through the county government.</p>
<p>(7) Each county party headquarters should focus its efforts in September on soliciting these clothing donations and complete the process within the month.</p>
<p>(8) The "Clothing Donation Drive to Aid Flood Victims Propaganda Week" should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>1. The purpose of the propaganda is to make the entire county's population aware of the dire situation of the flood victims lacking clothing, and that having food without clothing will inevitably lead to death from the cold.</p>
<p>2. As the weather is getting colder, millions of victims are in urgent need of clothing. The government is realistically unable to provide such a large quantity of clothing and must rely on donations from the local population to achieve effective results.</p>
<p>3. Propaganda methods may include holding mass meetings, entertainment gatherings, lecture meetings, organizing propaganda teams, etc., which each county may consider and implement accordingly.</p>
<p>4. This propaganda should be spread throughout all townships, villages, and towns in the county to achieve maximum effect.</p>
<p>5. The propaganda should specifically emphasize that all old and worn clothing items, if left unused, will inevitably rot or fetch little if sold. Donating them to flood victims saves lives and generates immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>6. The propaganda should not be limited to any particular method, but should aim to be comprehensive and deeply rooted in the population, and completed within seven days in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>7. Propaganda expenses will be allocated by the county party headquarters. County party headquarters that have no funds available may raise funds from various agencies in their respective counties and must practice economy in expenditure, submitting the accounts to the province for verification and reimbursement.</p>
<p>(9) After the clothing donation drive is completed in each county, the county party headquarters should submit a report on the process to this headquarters for review.</p>

<p>He Yushu Replies to Yu Jingtang by Telegram</p>
<p>Regarding the protection of cattle in the disaster areas of Jiangsu Province, the Department of Agriculture previously drafted measures that were submitted to and approved by the Provincial Government Committee, which then sent telegrams to the county governments to implement them accordingly. It has now been learned that Yu Jingtang of the Central Political School yesterday sent a telegram to Provincial Governor Ye Chucang and concurrently Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, He Yushu, with his suggestions for protecting cattle in the disaster areas. Director He then replied to Mr. Yu by telegram, outlining the situation regarding the protection of cattle in the disaster areas of Jiangsu Province. The exchange of telegrams is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yu Jingtang's telegram: "To Governor Ye Chucang and Director He Menglin, Greetings. I hear that in the disaster areas such as Xinghua, farmers are dying or migrating, and more than half of the cattle have been slaughtered. Each head is worth only seven or eight yuan. Current relief efforts are certainly essential, but plans for next spring's plowing must also be made in advance. If the government were to buy up all the cattle at this time and then either lend them to farmers or sell them at a low price next spring, the government would only be providing a limited amount of cash, which would be of no loss to the government, but would greatly benefit our people. I humbly offer my opinion for your consideration." Yu Jingtang, with respect.</p>
<p>(2) He Yushu's reply: "To Mr. Yu Jingtang of the Central Political School in Nanjing, Greetings. Your telegram is acknowledged with respect. Regarding the protection of cattle in disaster areas, this department previously requested the Provincial Government Committee to allocate relief funds for the purchase of feed by the counties. We also telegraphed the counties instructing them to quickly organize Cattle Protection Committees and Cattle Substitute Rearing Centers. Reports have been received from the counties confirming their establishment, and relief funds have been allocated to instruct them to purchase feed and take in as many cattle as possible. The disaster situation in Xinghua County this year is particularly severe and pitiable. The aforementioned relief funds have been allocated to the county government to establish centers in higher ground to take in cattle, which will be returned to their original owners for use next spring. Furthermore, the directors of the agricultural farms in Huaiyin, Yancheng, Taixian, and Jiangdu counties have been instructed by telegram to come to the department to discuss detailed measures to ensure thoroughness. Knowing that you are concerned, I reply to you by telegram." He Yushu, sincerely.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Hunan Provincial Relief Fund Allocation Method <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Most Severely Affected Areas Receive 17,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The flood disaster in Hunan Province this year is severe. Of the 75 counties in the province, 66 have been affected. Recently, the Central Government specially allocated 170,000 yuan for relief and sent Li Huanying to Hunan to distribute the funds. At the same time, the Hunan Fellow-Provincials Association in Beijing sent Pan Zhongqing as their representative to accompany Commissioner Li to Hunan to inspect the situation. Li and Pan have arrived in the province for several days, and representatives of the disaster victims from various counties have been reporting the disaster situation and requesting urgent relief. In total, there are more than one thousand million disaster victims in Hunan Province, but the Central Government's relief funds are only 170,000 yuan. How to allocate this sum is a difficult problem. After repeated discussions between Commissioner Li and the provincial government authorities, some proposed that the relief funds should only be allocated to the most severely affected lakeside counties, while others advocated for a universal allocation across all 66 counties. Finally, He Jian proposed convening an enlarged meeting of all sectors at the provincial government on the afternoon of the 8th to resolve this matter. Dozens of people attended the meeting, and the result was a decision to adopt a universal allocation method: (A) Lakeside counties: Yuanjiang and Nanxian each receive 17,000 yuan; Hanshou, Changde, and Anxiang each receive 15,000 yuan; Lixian receives 12,000 yuan; Xiangyin receives 11,000 yuan; Huarong, Yueyang, Yiyang, and Linxiang each receive 7,000 yuan. In total, 11 counties receive 130,000 yuan. (B) Other counties: Huitong, Xiang</p>

In total, 55 counties receive 40,000 yuan. As for the disaster situation in Hunan Province, Representative Pan Zhongqing sent a detailed letter to the Hunan Fellow-Provincials Association in Beijing yesterday, excerpts of which are as follows, to give a glimpse of the situation: "The total area of flooded fields in the province is approximately six million mu. Assuming an average yield of four shi of grain per mu, the total loss is 24 million shi of grain. Valued at five yuan per shi, this amounts to 120 million yuan. Including other losses, the total is estimated at 170-180 million yuan. There are approximately 11 million disaster victims, most of whom are destitute and cannot be settled. Providing relief to these victims is an extremely difficult task. Without active preparation in advance, it will be difficult to manage effectively. From autumn to spring, it is almost a year, and the disaster victims have no grain left. How easy is it to provide them with such a long-term supply of food? Even if the water has receded in the disaster areas in higher ground, it may still be possible to cultivate in the autumn to make up for some losses. However, such disaster areas are few in number. The majority, such as the dozen or so lakeside counties and the areas downstream of the Xiang River, are still submerged in vast floods, and autumn cultivation is impossible, leaving no hope for recovery. In addition, clothing and other necessities have mostly been lost. In the blink of an eye, the weather will turn cold, and in addition to food, funds must be raised for warmth, which is also a huge amount. Moreover, epidemics are likely to occur after the disaster, and medical treatment cannot be delayed. If no work is done to repair the breached dikes after the water recedes, next year's cultivation will also be hopeless. Advance planning cannot be achieved with a small amount of money. Therefore, the things that should be seriously and urgently attended to today are food, clothing, medicine, and dike repair. There are a thousand and one things to do, and it is difficult to describe the situation in words. The relief authorities now regard the disaster situation in Hankou and other places as serious, but they may be neglecting the disaster in Hunan. It is difficult to explain this misunderstanding without seeing the actual disaster situation. I beg you to tell the relief authorities as much as possible." (September 9)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Record of the Opening of Three Congee Kitchens in Wuchang <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>▲ More Than 24,000 Disaster Victims Received Food on the First Day</p>
<p>The Provincial Office of the Hubei Flood Emergency Relief Association set up three congee kitchens, all of which were completed on the 9th. They officially opened today (the 10th) at 8:00 AM. That day, Mr. Xiang Yangzhi of the office, Liang Shichun, representative of the National Youth Association, and Di Ernai (an American), Zhang Yaobin, directors of the Wuchang YMCA, and Tang Yasheng, Yi Lansheng, Sun Echi, directors of the office, set out to investigate in order to improve and benefit the disaster victims. The conditions of each congee kitchen are recorded separately as follows: (1) First congee kitchen: Located at Meijiashan outside Tongxiang Gate, the person in charge is Xu Chengfa. The assisting directors are from the Sanshan, Peishan, Zhishan, and Chengshan halls. Local gentry started the fire to cook congee from 12:00 PM on the 9th, and the kitchen opened at 8:00 AM on the 10th, closing at 2:00 PM. According to Director Xiang, the kitchen will need to extend its hours by one or two hours in the future to allow disaster victims to enter and eat at their leisure. He also ordered a detailed report of the daily needs for rice, firewood, charcoal, and water for budgeting purposes. (2) Second congee kitchen: Located at Changchun Temple outside Binyang Gate. Upon investigation, more than a thousand disaster victims were seen sitting on the ground waiting for food. As the scheduled time had passed, the kitchen was rushing to cook more congee. The person in charge is Hou Shuide (a Taoist priest), the abbot of Changchun Temple. He has considerable experience in distributing congee, so the order and arrangement were even better than the first kitchen. It is said that a total of 23 dan of rice were cooked, and approximately 9,600-700 disaster victims received food. The kitchen closed at 4:00 PM. (3) Third congee kitchen: Located at Baotong Temple on Hongshan. The location is spacious, the layout is perfect, and the order is excellent. The abbot of the temple, Wenxian (a monk), is also very enthusiastic and has sent 52 monks to assist in the cooking and distribution of congee. When the kitchen opened at 8:00 AM, there was an endless stream of people. A total of 14 dan of rice were cooked, and 5,000-6,000 disaster victims received food. It is said that the mat sheds nearby have not yet been fully completed, and the number of disaster victims will inevitably increase daily. In total, the three kitchens cooked 55 dan of rice, and approximately 24,000 disaster victims received food.</p>

<p>Jinan Dispatch: Regarding the issue of purifying the countryside in Shandong and Henan, Han Fuju has already gone to Bian to negotiate with Liu Zhi and has reached a compromise. After Han returned to Jinan, he convened a meeting of Shandong generals to discuss suppressing bandits in order to launch a large-scale purification of the countryside throughout the province. Important generals currently in Jinan include Ma Hongkui, Commander of the 15th Route; Zhan Shutang, Commander of the 81st Division; Qiao Lizhi, Commander of the 74th Division; Ma Guanyi, Commander of the 221st Brigade; Li Yizhi, Commander of the 220th Brigade; Cao Fulin, Commander of the 29th Division; Li Hanzhang, Commander of the 85th Brigade; and Sun Tongxuan, Commander of the 22nd Division, who is in Zhoucun but is expected to arrive in Jinan today, so the meeting can be held tonight. According to Zhang Yue, Counselor of the Countryside Purification Supervision Office, the methods for purifying the countryside in Shandong and Henan provinces will be implemented in accordance with the previously announced detailed rules for purifying the countryside. Ordinary county purification will be carried out on a county basis. In areas with bandits, or where several counties are designated as special zones, purification will be carried out. In Henan Province, large groups of bandits will be eliminated by the military headquarters, while small groups of bandits will be dealt with by the purifying counties. Shandong has decided to start first. Tang Yaoxun's 65th Brigade has already taken two trains south to Tengxian today to suppress bandits in Mengshan (September 11).</p>
<h3 id="e59">Shanxi Rehabilitation Association Urges Yan to Leave Shanxi <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Urges Yan to Consider the Peace and Tranquility of Shanxi</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: It has been more than a month since Yan Xishan returned to Shanxi from Dalian. Letters and telegrams from all sides urging him to leave Shanxi are pouring in like snowflakes, but Yan has not been moved in the slightest. When Yan first returned to Shanxi, various parties here paid close attention, but recently, as Yan has been living in seclusion in his hometown without any news, they have become indifferent. However, the Shanxi Rehabilitation and Advancement Association still hopes that Yan will leave Shanxi as soon as possible, so yesterday they sent a letter urging him. The original letter is as follows: "Mr. Bochuan, Greetings. It is said that a defeated general is not worthy of discussing courage, and the husband of a vanquished nation cannot coexist with the nation. Therefore,侥倖 seeking credit is bound to be wrong, and retreating in the face of difficulty is better. You were reckless in waging war last year, and fled after defeat. Although it is said that the situation was dire and you had no choice, the fact is that once you left, the planes stopped coming and the pursuing troops stopped advancing. Your departure at that time saved many. It is a pity that when you left, you did not say a word to apologize to the world, nor did you say a word to comfort the people of Shanxi. Instead, you withdrew a huge amount of cash from the provincial treasury, causing the provincial currency to plummet and leaving everyone unable to make a living. You ruled Shanxi with the people of Shanxi for twenty years. How did the people of Shanxi let you down that you should be so unkind? One who has great ambitions for the world would not do such a thing. Moreover, although you left, the troops are stationed throughout our province, and the bandits are growing stronger by the day. The people are burdened by requisitions and threatened by looting, dying either from starvation or slaughter. Who is to blame for this calamity? It is hardly necessary to elaborate. This is just a brief account of man-made disasters. As for the natural disasters caused by misfortune, the prolonged and severe drought is unprecedented in recent decades. Alas, the people of Shanxi are suffering in this era, with many ways to die and no way to live. If they were not inherently gentle, they would have already rebelled, and the slightest provocation would have aroused a hundred responses, causing unrest. Is the current state of affairs not a miracle? Now, fortunately, after enduring pain for a long time, Heaven and man have shown compassion, and signs of life are beginning to emerge. But you suddenly flew back on an aircraft, announcing that you were waiting for your father's illness. Of the more than 17 million people in Shanxi, do you alone have parents? Last year's tragedy, from a national perspective, left countless people as fatherless, sonless, or wifeless. Xiang Yu lost eight thousand Jiangdong soldiers and said he had no face to see the elders of Jiangdong. How do you compare to Xiang Yu, having lost all the sons and daughters of Shanxi? Yet you insist on seeing your father? Although, we do not mean that children should not care for their parents, nor do we object to you reuniting with your father. You informed the General and Deputy Commander when you first returned, so the general public believes that the Central Government and you have resolved their differences and made peace. We believe that the national situation is so precarious that it is not appropriate to fight among ourselves. Like many, we do not wish to blame you personally. After much investigation, the facts are not so. According to reports, if you do not voluntarily leave Shanxi, Deputy Commander Zhang will persuade the Shanxi generals to advise you together. We believe that the Shanxi generals are all former subordinates who have recently returned to the Central Government. If this happens, they will be disobeying orders if they refuse, and will be hurting personal feelings if they comply. Leaving aside personal feelings, disobeying orders will likely result in punishment. In order to reduce the burden on the people, the fewer the troops, the better. But today's Shanxi is not the Shanxi of the past. Bandits are everywhere, and the four brigades of the past will be difficult to eliminate. If troops from outside Shanxi are deployed, Shanxi's mountains and ranges are difficult to navigate without knowing their intricacies. Thus, if you seek personal peace, the people of Shanxi may not be able to find peace. Is this not contrary to your original intention when you left last year? Moreover, the financial public debt has been suspended, and the Shanxi currency has plummeted to unprecedented levels in recent months. The Shanxi currency was created by you, so how can you bear to see it ruined by you? Other military and political affairs are also hindered and cannot be resolved, without us needing to spell it out in detail. Therefore, we advise you to think carefully, not to fight against fate, to exercise self-restraint, and to retreat far away, so as not to cause a great disaster for the 17 million people of Shanxi for your own peace. If so, the people of Shanxi will be fortunate, fortunate." (September 9)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Discovery of Nestorian Relics in Fangshan <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Professor Saeki Yoshiro of Meiji University in Japan, along with Japanese national Matsumura Yuzo and German Doctor of Law Matsubayashi, went to a site only 100 li southwest of Beijing (about 18 li from Fangxian city in the mountains) on September 6 to investigate Nestorian relics. In the courtyard of the Great Buddha Hall of the Cross Temple, they discovered the "Chongsheng Temple Stele on Three Pots Mountain" and the "Imperial Decree on the Stele of the Cross," both made of marble. Beside the stele, there are two ginkgo trees with a circumference of more than two zhang. Based on the age of these two trees, it is not difficult to know that this is an ancient temple dating back more than a thousand years. The temple was founded in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. It seems that Nestorian monks resided here during the Tang Dynasty. The stele is engraved with a cross measuring one chi four or five cun square, and also with Estrangelo Syriac characters, the meaning of which is "Why do you look and hope?", a sentence from Psalm 35 of the Old Testament. Another stele is engraved with a roughly similar cross, but there are no Syriac characters. However, judging from the patterns on both sides, it can still be known that it was built in the same era. It is regrettable that this type of relic is neglected in the remote mountains. Therefore, Dr. 米 intends to find a way to purchase and donate the stele to the Beijing Museum of Antiquities in order to preserve it. The group returned to Beijing on the 8th of this month. According to historical records, Nestorianism was introduced to Chang'an in the ninth year of Emperor Taizong's reign (635 AD) and flourished in China for 150 years. In the second year of Emperor Dezong's reign (781 AD), the "Stele of the Propagation of Nestorianism in China" was erected in Xi'an, Shaanxi. Currently, in addition to Xi'an and Fangshan County, there is another stone stele with a cross engraved on it in a mountain about seven days' journey from Zhangjiakou.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Tiantu Road Washed Away by Floods <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Many Bridges Were Destroyed</p>
<p>The Entire Road Is Impassable</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: There has been a lot of rain in northern Manchuria recently, and the water level of the rivers has suddenly increased by more than ten feet, overflowing their banks. Although the disaster is not as great as in Jiangnan, the damage to the fields is countless. Jidong has many mountains, and the mountain floods are rushing down with great force, so the disaster is also more serious than in other places. Near the Muleng Ma Bridge on the Hasui Line, the floodwaters are about to submerge the tracks of the East China Railway. The East China Railway Bureau is still sending workers day and night to prevent danger. However, the fields upstream of the Ma Bridge River are most severely flooded. The provincial government has ordered Dongning and Ning'an counties to carry out protective work. However, this has not yet affected transportation. Recently, the mountain floods on the Tiantu route washed away the old Tougou and Xilin River bridges completely on the 1st of this month. The Hailan River bridge was built more solidly, so it was fortunately not broken, but it was submerged by several feet of water. The Badahuazi bridge was also submerged and is in danger. The roadbeds of Shimenzi, Huaiqing, and Jiang'an road platforms have all collapsed for dozens of li due to the turbulent waters. Most of the tracks are submerged in the water. The losses are more than 100,000 yuan. From the 1st to the 4th, there was heavy rain for several days, and railway transportation was completely cut off. The goods accumulated at the stations were also submerged by the water entering the warehouses before they could be moved. It is not yet known when transportation can be restored. Due to the waterlogged railway line, the Longjingcun Wharf was also flooded, and the streets were several feet deep, disrupting traffic. The Longmen and Liu'an bridges on the Hailan River, which connect Longjingcun and Yanji, were hit and destroyed by the wood piled up on the river bank on the evening of the 3rd of this month due to the sudden rise of the river water. Transportation between Longjing and Yanji was also cut off. Fortunately, the water came slowly, and the residents along the river were able to evacuate, so the damage was light. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable. (September 8)</p>

<p>(Continued from Part Four)</p>
<p>(33) Record of Conversations between Gannady and Bioni on March 24, 1931 (Describing the Shanghai Labor Unrest and the Communist Party's Activities among Workers)</p>
<p>Regarding the recent week's strike and conflict, Bioni reported as follows:</p>
<p>The Shenxin Textile Factory has already been transferred and is about to shut down. We incited three non-Party workers in the factory to form a Red organization. This organization started a struggle, demanding resumption of operations. A portion of the workers (the factory has four thousand workers) held a meeting and elected seven people to form a committee to carry out the struggle. The committee put forward the following four demands: (1) The textile factory must resume operations. (2) If the factory resumes operations, all wages during the shutdown period should be paid as usual. (3) If the factory changes ownership and reopens, all original workers should retain their positions. (4) If the factory closes down permanently, each worker should be paid five years' wages by the old owner. There is a Yellow Union in the factory, and the workers demanded repayment of the membership fees paid to the union in the last three years. In the past, there was a mutual aid organization, and the workers also demanded repayment of the funds paid to the organization. The leader of our organization has left the factory to take up another job, so now there are only two people left in the organization. Before the factory closed, we sent a comrade to work there (for some reason, this comrade is not in the group of three). He is currently leading this struggle. Yesterday, the committee of seven held a meeting and decided to continue the struggle based on the aforementioned demands. The leaders of the Yellow Union also demanded that the workers oppose the factory's closure, but only based on avoiding unemployment. We are still fighting for the aforementioned demands in order to oppose their propaganda. The Yellow Union had no vitality in the past, only a committee. The (right-wing) within the factory is also very active, accusing our comrades, saying that they have just returned from W place and support the Fourth Plenary Session. There was also a brief strike in the weaving department of the Shenxin No. 1 Textile Factory in the West District (30 workers). They worked twelve hours a day and only received a wage of 34 cents, so they demanded an increase to 42 cents. This demand was agreed to by the supervisor. Then the workers demanded that the daily wage be changed to 52 cents, and the supervisor also agreed. This struggle was led by a committee of eight people, and they were all volunteers. We are carrying out propaganda, demanding that all workers in the factory have their wages increased by 20 percent. We posted eight wall posters on the factory walls. We plan to organize a Red organization there. Sixty workers in the packing department of the Jihe (transliteration) Textile Factory went on strike. These packers originally bundled twenty small packages into one large package, but now they are being forced to increase the number to thirty-two packages. They originally calculated wages by piece, and those with better work ability could earn 80 cents to one yuan per day. Now the factory management is implementing a daily calculation, working twelve hours a day for a wage of 50 cents. After hearing this, four workers went to the management to demand that wages still be calculated by piece, and if calculated by day, the wage must be increased to 55 cents. The management personnel threatened them, saying that if they incited the workers, they would be punished by dismissal. Therefore, all the packers declared that if their demands were not met, they would have to strike. The management finally granted their request and still calculated wages by piece. After this struggle occurred, we formed a Red organization composed of three people and are now trying to pull the aforementioned four workers into it.</p>
<p>The Minxing (transliteration) Silk Weaving Factory has eighty workers. Last year, each person could weave twenty feet of silk per day, earning three cents per foot, or sixty cents per day. The management decided to change the wage to five cash per foot, so the workers went on strike in protest and spontaneously organized a strike committee. We are planning to contact these strikers to organize and guide them.</p>
<p>There are three textile factories in the French Concession, with a total of one thousand workers. One of them is the Dingxin (transliteration) Textile Factory. The Kuomintang has organized a Yellow Union in the factory. Four people who worked hard for the union were dismissed, so the workers sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. The bureau replied that it needed to investigate first before it could handle the matter. The workers were very angry when they heard this, saying that since the four people had already been dismissed, it would be difficult to wait patiently for the results of the investigation. Therefore, they gathered several workers and proposed demanding that the management rehire the dismissed workers. This meeting was held in the house of a woman, and her husband is a Party member. When the Party member heard this, he proposed that the workers in the factory should have an organization and demand that the dismissed workers be reinstated. If this was not allowed, then the only option was to strike. They accepted this proposal and said that they would engage in organization after returning. We don't know what the result will be.</p>
<p>There is a sawmill with a total of two hundred workers, most of whom are short-term workers. They work twelve hours a day and earn 50 to 60 cents. They demanded long-term work and a 20 percent increase in wages. The supervisor only allowed a 20 percent increase in wages but did not allow long-term work.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks, our organizational work in the West District has developed. The Shenxin No. 1 Textile Factory already has a Red organization composed of eight people. Four workers from the Dafeng Textile Factory have contacted us. The Zhentai Textile Factory already has a Red organization composed of three people. One worker from the Fifth Textile Factory, opened by a Japanese company, has contacted us. Four workers from the Honghongsheng have contacted us. Three workers from the Jihe Textile Factory have contacted us. Four workers from the Wenmozhao (transliteration) Factory have contacted us. A flour mill already has a Red organization composed of eight people. One worker from the Puhai (transliteration) No. 2 Textile Factory has contacted us, and one person from a silk reeling factory has also contacted us. In total, there are already thirty-eight workers, and only two of them are Party members. (We asked the other diligent Party members in the West District whether they paid attention to the necessity of all Party members undertaking this important work. Bioni said he would consider this matter.)</p>
<p>Regarding the telephone workers' struggle, we convened a mass meeting last week, with a total of one hundred people attending, but only forty people remained until the end of the meeting. These forty people elected seven people to form a struggle committee to guide this struggle. Our comrades do not know how to utilize this committee. They instead said that a Red trade union should be organized, without discussing the demands that should be put forward or the methods of carrying out the struggle. The workers believe that it is not yet the time to organize a trade union, so we have not yet organized the more active workers into a Red organization, but instead sent several comrades to lead. The workers only asked who they were and showed no signs of trust. Only one of the seven members of the committee is a comrade of our Party. When we reconvened the committee meeting, several members did not attend. Therefore, we told our comrades that the working methods must be changed. We have now organized a Red organization, which has a total of seven people. We are also relying on this organization to carry out work and no longer sending comrades to guide. We are now asking this organization to convene a representative meeting to discuss the demands that should be put forward and the methods of carrying out the struggle. The workers proposed organizing a club instead of organizing a Red trade union. Our Party has expressed its agreement to this. From the above, it can be seen that our comrades still do not know the methods of work. (Then Bioni raised several questions, namely regarding the organization and working methods of maritime workers. We then answered them based on the existing pamphlets.)</p>
<p>(35) An English Report to (Akers) Describing the Struggles of Chinese Textile Workers, Especially the Strikes of Shanghai Silk Reeling Workers</p>
<p>The purpose of this letter is to let you know a little about our work in the textile industry here. The objective situation of the textile industry is very suitable for our work, but because our organization has no contact with textile workers, there are no achievements to speak of in this promising area. Now we can understand that in the past, under the leadership of Li Shan, the lower-level Party departments did not pay attention to the work among the masses, and everything was done by the upper-level (leaders), without considering the work of the trade union at all. Although our Party has now recognized the importance of this work and has sent more capable comrades to lead the work of the trade union, we still have a bad trend that must be improved. We must make the National Labor Union and the Party department realize the separation between the two. We should regard the Party department as an organization for organizing political demonstrations and carrying out political work, and regard the National Labor Union as an organization for carrying out daily economic struggles. Just look at the fact that when the Red trade union wants to carry out certain work during a strike, the Party members in the factory or manufacturing plant where the strike is located mostly do not try to help, and you can see the proof. For example, during the Shanghai silk weaving workers' strike in March and April of this year, the Party department sent nine comrades to work, but even these nine people left their jobs after a few days. Although we have repeatedly explained the necessity of the Party department sending Party members to help the silk weaving workers' strike, only nine comrades were able to use their talents to help such a large struggle of Shanghai workers. We have repeatedly tried to break the separation between the Party department and the National Labor Union and have now achieved some success.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The statistics of strikes here are very inaccurate, so we have transferred this work to ourselves in order to seek its increasing accuracy. In the ten weeks since April 30, according to the information we have collected, there have been as many as one hundred and forty-nine strikes. Among them, thirty occurred in textile factories, and thirty-eight occurred in silk weaving factories. In addition, there was also a large strike of three thousand female workers in hair braiding factories in North China. There were also several strikes in cigarette factories and match factories. There was also a strike of apprentices in a textile factory, with a total of seventy strikes by female workers. The number of people in a single strike ranges from several hundred to 20,000. These types of strikes are naturally spontaneous. The total number of strikes is naturally more than our records, because our source of information is newspapers, and newspapers definitely do not publish all strike news.</p>
<p>There are more than one hundred silk factories in Shanghai, with more than 50,000 workers (women and child laborers). From October to March, the silk factories do not operate. In October of last year, the Yellow Union forced the workers to accept a 15 percent reduction in wages due to the low wholesale price of raw silk. In March of this year, the workers began to struggle, demanding the restoration of their original wages. From March 9 to April 3, workers went on strike separately, totaling thirty-one strikes. On April 4, thirty-two silk factories jointly launched a general strike, with a total of 20,000 workers on strike. On April 11, the Social Affairs Bureau prohibited workers from striking, but on April 18, the workers held another general strike, with thirty-three silk factories participating. The Social Affairs Bureau, the City Party Department, and the Yellow Trade Union urged the workers to resume work and guaranteed the restoration of wages. The Social Affairs Bureau decided to increase wages, to be implemented from June 1. However, on June 1, the silk factories suddenly announced a shutdown, notifying the workers to wait for the government to approve the silk industry public bonds before receiving the increased wages. Therefore, the city of Andong in the three eastern provinces became known for the strike of 15,000 workers.</p>
<p>There is no Party department or trade union organization in the silk factories. Before the Shanghai silk factory workers went on strike, it was said that the Communist Youth League had a centralized organization in the Shanghai silk factories, but by the time of the strike, this organization was no longer visible. On March 15, I met female comrades from the Women's Committee of the National Labor Union and discussed with them the methods of dealing with the silk industry situation. We decided to use the relationship established on March 8 and start working among the workers, but this work has not yet been implemented. The National Labor Union, SLC, and the local Party affairs committee are all under pressure to deal with the current situation in the silk industry and have no time to take care of it. Even printing materials or even printing a page of large characters has therefore been transferred to the Party department for handling. These groups have held many meetings, and there have been many good resolutions regarding the work in the silk industry. The Party department and SLC specially sent a comrade to lead the work in the silk industry, but no comrade is responsible for the work among the silk reeling workers. We had a prediction that silk reeling workers would launch a large-scale strike, but several comrades in leading positions in the Shanghai group still disagreed, even though they saw news of silk reeling workers' strikes every day. When the general strike was in progress, we proposed convening a workers' representative congress but were also opposed. Finally, after our repeated persuasion, these comrades realized that their views were wrong and agreed to find a way to convene this meeting and publish a special issue the next day (April 18), advising the workers to change the item of (organizational rights) into a concrete demand and publicly put forward the slogans of (oppose arbitration) (support direct negotiations) and (organize the workers' own committee). However, these conditions were not fulfilled. I believe that this strike of silk reeling workers is enough to make the comrades of the Party department and the National Labor Union realize that although the workers have the determination to fight, the fact that our Party's organization has no contact with this struggle is a great regret. The current working methods are being improved, which can be seen in the records of our conversations with the comrades who share the existing duties. We have not only told the National Labor Union about the lessons learned from the silk reeling workers' strike, but have also drafted an official document and submitted it to the Party department in charge of this duty. Attached is a document to the National Labor Union on the situation of the cotton industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of the textile industry outside of Shanghai, we have obtained very little information. We have repeatedly requested the National Labor Union to establish a large-scale National Textile Industry Provisional Committee.</p>
<p>In addition, several comrades have also deeply believed that these strikes, the frequency of which is increasing and the nature of which is becoming more and more widespread, are definitely not the workers' usual seasonal struggles, but the result of the oppression of the workers' lives. This oppression is related to the current global economic crisis. Japanese imperialists are the largest owners of Chinese textile factories. Now, under the influence of this global economic crisis, they want to compensate for their losses with the workers, and British imperialists also have similar plans. You can see this in the aforementioned document on the cotton yarn industry.</p>
<p>The strikes in textile factories are only the prelude to a large-scale strike in the cotton industry. The large-scale strike in the future will definitely not be just a struggle against Chinese textile factory owners, but also a large-scale struggle against British and Japanese cotton employers. The British Far East Economic Survey Group's suggestion to the British cotton magnates was (to make sacrifices in all classes) to adapt to the market situation and invest more capital in Chinese textile factories. The Manchester Yellow Union has already accepted the group's suggestion and agreed to reduce the wages of Manchester dye industry workers. We have advised the National Labor Union to publish a petition, asking British cotton workers to recognize the stakes. I think that if MM could make the same petition to Chinese cotton workers, it would definitely help the cotton workers' movement in both countries. I don't know what you think. If you also think so, please be sure to send the petition from MM here.</p>
<p>Regarding women's work, we have issued an eleven-page pamphlet, which is sent by our trade union to everyone concerned, as a guide for women's work. There is also a questionnaire attached from various countries, in order to learn about women's lives and the general situation of our work among women. Reports that meet our needs are very difficult to find. Except for a women's conference held by Japan during a certain strike, there are no achievements to speak of in women's work. Even the necessary agencies in the white areas of China have not been established. In China, we did establish a weak agency in the upper-level Party department, but it has been almost completely destroyed due to recent arrests and the incitement work of a certain CC (Communist Party) member. We have discussed how to establish this work in the Party department and the National Labor Union. The main work we focus on is that the women's committee in the Party should guide the work of the trade union among women. The main work at present should be to establish a Red trade union and seek practical results. Therefore, the WD (Women's Department) in the Party should urgently guide and assist the National Textile Committee and help it draft a work plan regarding the re-establishment of the Women's Committee and its current work. We are also conducting this jointly with the National Labor Union. We have sent several women to the Soviet area to work, but have not yet received a report.</p>

<p>Villager Gu Ada Tragically Tortured to Death with Private Punishment. Gu Shenshi, a widow from Qinxixiang, Zhangyan Sixth District, is approaching fifty years of age. Her husband has been dead for many years, and she only has one son named Ada, who is now twenty-five years old. Last autumn, he married the daughter of Gan Abao from Jinweixiang as his wife. Ada is usually law-abiding and dedicated to agriculture. The other day (the 10th), Ada's uncle-in-law's family had a tangbing feast, and Ada went to the feast because he was a relative. That night, his father-in-law insisted on him staying overnight, so he did not go home. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night, Captain Tan of the Jinshan Water Patrol Team led more than ten patrol officers and, on the pretext of searching for bandits, arrested Ada without discrimination and escorted him to Langxia. The Water Patrol Team headquarters did not ask about the situation and immediately used extreme torture to force a confession. Ada was indeed a kind-hearted farmer and only cried out for injustice. Later, because he was subjected to extreme torture, he vomited blood from his mouth and his breath was as thin as a thread. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Captain Tan secretly sent patrol officers to carry him by boat to the wild Shantang area west of Kongjiaque and threw Ada into the water to try to cover up the traces. Unexpectedly, he was spotted by the local villagers there, who called for help and rescued Ada. However, he eventually died from his injuries. Afterwards, the corpse's mother, Gu Shenshi, together with the village head, Hu Dajun, reported the incident to the Zhangyan Sixth District Office and the First Public Security Bureau. Later, the district office and the public security bureau both used telephones to report to the county government, requesting that officials be sent to examine the corpse, punish the murderers, and vindicate the deceased. Captain Tan had already gone to the county government to fabricate a false confession and falsely claimed that Gu Ada was trying to escape, fell into the water, and drowned in order to shirk his responsibility. Local people were indignant when they heard this. Mo Jun Menghui, the standing committee member of the Fifth District Branch of the Party Department, has also begun to investigate in order to report the incident.</p>

<p>All Circles Petition to Handle Industrial Relief. The County Party Department's Supervisory Committee, the Silk Merchant Associations, the Commerce and Education Associations, and various District Offices jointly submitted separate petitions to the Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments, requesting that all construction funds be transferred to handle industrial relief, that the blocked river channels in the eastern townships be dredged one by one, and that embankments be built in the low-lying areas of the western townships to prevent future disasters and maintain the people's livelihood. The county government also has the same resolution and has recorded the case and submitted it to the provincial departments for approval. Gambling Leads to Murder. Lu Rutong, a teacher at Qibei Primary School in the city and a native of Chongming, twenty-six years old, was playing mahjong for fun at Zhou Ajin's house north of the school on the evening of the 10th when he was arrested by detectives Wang Qixiang and Hu Chasheng of the Public Security Bureau. He was chased and fell into the river. The detectives ignored him and only detained the remaining people and took them back to the bureau. It was not until the morning of the 11th that the school did not see Lu come to school to teach that neighbors revealed that he had fallen into the river because of gambling. In the afternoon, the Public Security Bureau ordered people to go to the original place to fish for him, and his body was recovered. The Education Bureau sent someone to Shanghai to report to his family. On the afternoon of the 12th, the corpse's father and wife came to Jiading. After the county government examined the body, his friends raised funds to collect it. That night, the county government summoned Zhou Ajin's wife and the corpse's father, wife, and his fellow villagers Qu Yongqing and Zhang Wenzao to the case and interrogated them about the situation at the time of the arrest. Zhou Ajin's wife was sent to prison for investigation. It is said that Lu has no children and his family is very poor. The corpse's relatives and fellow villagers will file a lawsuit.</p>

<p>A Word on Urging the Repair of the Seawall. After the Jinshanwei seawall was destroyed by strong winds, heavy rain, and huge waves on the 25th of last month, sections one and two of the Xitang section, another heavy rain on the 6th of this month put section three at risk. The people of Songjiang and Jinshan sent telegrams to appeal and rushed to report the danger, and the situation was very tense. Everyone thought that the August flood season was approaching, and if it was not blocked in advance, it would be difficult to avoid becoming a sequel to Gao Shao. Regarding the repair funds, 10,000 yuan has been borrowed from the county's road construction land donation item and handed over to the Seawall Works Office to receive it. However, because Director Xue has been late in arriving, work has not yet started, and the people are panicked and indescribable. Yesterday, Director Xue and technician Shen Baozhang came to Songjiang to discuss the situation of the seawall repair project with County Magistrate Shen and Construction Bureau Chief Sun. County Magistrate Shen, considering the importance of the matter, immediately invited the leaders of various Party, government, military, and academic institutions and local gentry to hold a discussion meeting. Director Xue reported on the spot that the Jinshanwei seawall project was in a very critical situation, and the estimated cost of the repair was about 35,000 yuan. Now there is a shortage of both people and money, and it is planned to submit a request to the provincial departments for funds. I have to return to Shanghai tomorrow morning due to a matter, he said. Everyone present expressed their dissatisfaction, saying that the exchange of official documents would take time, and the autumn flood season was approaching. Once the angry tide surged, the Songjiang and Jinshan areas would become a swamp, and millions of lives would suffer together. Moreover, whether the provincial departments can allocate funds is still a question. The funds have already been borrowed for 10,000 gold, and Commander Cao has agreed to allocate a team to help. If the funds are insufficient, the local area will also temporarily agree to raise funds, which will be returned by the Construction Department in the future, they said. After a detailed explanation from everyone, Xue finally relented. After discussion, they immediately rushed to prepare disaster relief materials that night, hired ships to transport them, and the issue of workers required about six or seven hundred workers a day. In addition to the two hundred existing workers from the Seawall Works Office and one hundred workers from the Construction Bureau, the conscription system was implemented, and if it was insufficient, a request was made to allocate troops to assist. It was decided that all those present would rush to Jinshanwei this morning to investigate. If the weather is clear during the day, then the great tide until the eighteenth day of the lunar calendar can be safely passed.</p>

<p>Water Thieves Rob Night Boats. The Jiangyin Zhouzhuang night boat, which travels between our county and Jiangyin, was suddenly encountered by a pirate ship at 0:30 AM yesterday, when it was passing through the Yangqihe ferry crossing in our county. More than ten bandits jumped out, armed with weapons such as handguns, Mauser pistols, chisels, and sharp knives, shouting to stop the boat. The thieves then boarded the boat one after another and looted wantonly. Forty silver dollars, dozens of silver coins, six cotton quilts, and foreign goods such as toothbrushes, face cloths, and foreign socks carried by the foreign goods store were robbed, worth more than 30 silver dollars. As for the passengers, they were robbed of about two or thirty silver dollars. After the thieves got their loot, they jumped back to their original boat and prepared to speed away. Suddenly, they saw another open boat coming nearby, and they boarded the boat again and robbed arbitrarily. After about half an hour, they were able to leave with their loot. After checking, it was estimated that clothing and other items worth more than one hundred silver dollars had been robbed.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Obtain Public Bonds but Do Not Start Work. The Silk Factory Industry and Trade Union in our county recently stated that the owners of Yongyu Silk Factory outside the South Gate, Zhu Zhuxian, etc., did not start work after obtaining silk industry public bonds, and they did not purchase raw materials, and the factory site was being returned. Measuring their private intentions, it was nothing more than cleverly seizing public funds to relieve people's livelihood in order to satisfy their desire to repay debts and enrich themselves, disregarding the laws of the national government and the lives of workers. There are also Yuanfeng, Xifeng, Yonghengfeng, Yishengyu, Daxin, and other factories that have also obtained public bonds, and their attitude is unusually silent, and to this day there has been no news of preparing to start machinery for business. What their intentions are can be imagined. Therefore, yesterday, they submitted a request to the county government for verification and quick transfer to the Ministry of Industry and the Silk Industry Public Bond Custody Committee for strict sanctions in accordance with laws and regulations to save unemployment and stabilize people's livelihoods. Wang Daoan's Family, the Notorious Thief, Executed by Firing Squad. Wang Daoan's family, a Jiangbei doctor in Dalou Lane, Qingshi Old Righteous Village, in our city, was robbed by thieves at 5:00 AM on July 9. Afterwards, Captain Xue Furui of the Public Security Bureau's detective team led detectives to Shanghai to arrest Zhou Xinshun, the main culprit in the case (i.e., Zhou Xiaoxiazi), and two suspects, coachmen Zhang Xiaosanzi, who were escorted back to the county. After County Magistrate Chen opened the court for interrogation, Zhou Xinshun confessed to robbing Wang Daoan's family. County Magistrate Chen specially approved the death penalty from the provincial government and executed the thief Zhou Xinshun by firing squad at the South School Field at 11:00 AM yesterday. The suspect Zhang Xiaosanzi was interrogated yesterday and was released on bail because there was no major suspicion.</p>

<p>Escape of a Local Prisoner: Wu Yi local prison's kitchen duties are assigned by selecting from among the prisoners. On the morning of the 12th, at 6:00 AM, guard Zhou Hanqing escorted convicted thief Chen Mazi to purchase vegetables outside. Due to the crowded marketplace, Chen seized the opportunity to escape. Zhou Hanqing noticed and pursued, but could not find him. Zhou had to return to the prison to report to warden Wu Guoguang. Wu immediately dispatched police to search in all directions, but without success. A request was then submitted to the County Court and County Government for consideration and action.</p>
<p>Soil Merchant Bribes Clerk: Wang Yin, wife of soil merchant Wang Chengji of Wu Yi's Xi Xiasu, was arrested by the County Court Procuratorate. Subsequently, Wang also surrendered himself and was detained. The previous night, Tan Zuoqing, accompanied by Ma Jin'an, went to the residence of Luo Zheng, the chief clerk of the Procuratorate, seeking an audience and offering a hundred yuan banknote as a gift, requesting Luo to arrange for the release of Wang Chengji and his wife. Luo refused, but Tan and Ma left the banknote on the table. The next day, Luo reported this to Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongyi, who immediately ordered the police to arrest Tan and Ma. On the 12th, the court opened an inquiry and found the facts to be true, ordering them to be detained pending prosecution.</p>

<p>Overflowing Number of Refugees, Difficult to Accommodate: Refugees from various counties north of the Yangtze River are transported to Nantong in batches. Eight reception centers have been set up for men and women, originally intended for two thousand people. However, over three thousand refugees have arrived in recent days, with more than two thousand still on the way. There is no way to accommodate them. On the 12th, the Relief Association requested the County Government to telegraph the Provincial Government for a large sum of relief funds to be allocated to Nantong to subsidize the effort, while urgently dispatching ships to disaster areas to resettle refugees in other counties.</p>
<p>Yao Port Suffers Flooding from Rising Tide: Around midnight on the 11th, the Jiangchao tide surged over ten feet in the Yao Port area of Nantong, breaching the embankment and causing flooding.

<p>The Saga of Destroying and Re-sculpting City God Statues: After the City God Temple idols were destroyed two years ago, the temple was sealed. Last year, Taoists raised funds and sculpted a gilded City God statue in the main hall, costing over four hundred yuan. Recently, the County Party Department moved into the City God Temple to use as an office. Committee member Xi Hanping, believing the imposing idols were an eyesore, initially wanted to demolish them. However, Section Chief Zhu Tianying ordered craftsmen to build a brick wall around it, temporarily preserving it. Unexpectedly, the Taoists, citing the National Government's regulations protecting temples, tore down the wall the day before yesterday, revealing the gilded City God. Upon seeing this, Committee member Xi became enraged. On the 11th, he notified the Taoists of the Dongyin Shanfang, ordering them to move the statue within a specified period, or it would be demolished to eliminate superstition.</p>
<p>County Executive Supervisory Committee Scheduled to Take Over: The executive supervisory committee members of the County Party Department have been identified by the Provincial Reorganization Committee.

Specifically, companies such as Fuyun are showing compassion for disaster victims by offering a public relief steamer for refugees. Those holding passes from various reception centers will be exempt from fares, and passengers will not be allowed on these relief boats. Passenger steamers will also not accommodate refugees to avoid overcrowding.</p>
<p>Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition to Aid Yangzhou: Yangzhou calligraphers and painters, such as Jin Jianwu, have initiated a calligraphy and painting exhibition to raise funds for disaster relief.

That evening, they fired shots as a show of force in Nankan Port, all the way to Niucheqiao, and kidnapped seven people, including residents Liu Wenxu, Wang Xuedao, Bao Wansheng, Ma San's father and son, and two daughters (approximately eighteen or nineteen years old). Upon hearing the news, the Dayu Town Security Corps immediately led a team to pursue them to the coast. Around 6:00 PM on the 8th, the bandits burned two fishing boats moored in the port. The director of the coastal defense corps, upon hearing the alarm, submitted a written report to the County Government on the 9th, requesting urgent assistance.

Prosecutor Chen was dispatched to the scene by the court. The murderer had already been apprehended by the factory guards and handed over to the court for prosecution.</p>

<p>Qiu Dongyan Shows His Skills</p>
<p>This group followed the same pattern: the weak could not overcome the strong. In the first half, Jinan was not particularly impressive, winning by only two goals, 2-0. Jinan then launched an all-out attack. Initially, they were repeatedly unable to score, but in the second half, Qinghua could no longer resist and Jinan scored five consecutive goals, making it 7-0. Then, Qinghua's Fu Guangbin desperately broke through Jinan's defense, making it 7-1, avoiding a complete shutout. The game ended with a score of 12-1. Jinan's famous player, Qiu Dongyan, showed off his skills, agile and powerful. Once he reached the goal, he dashed in all directions, facing no resistance.

<p>At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Fudan and Hujiang played in the rematch. Fudan won 3-1, securing a spot in the final. In the first game, Fudan quickly won the first half with a score of 11-5. Hujiang bravely advanced, tying the score at 18. Fudan eventually won the first game 21-18. In the second game, Fudan again won the first half with a score of 11-6. Hujiang tied the score at 13, with several ties thereafter. After each reaching 21, Hujiang won 23-21, tying the game at 1-1. In the third and fourth games, Hujiang's momentum declined sharply. It seemed that Hujiang did not play carefully at the start of each game, making it difficult to recover later, which may have been one of the reasons for their defeat. Fudan's spiking was strong on both wings. Cao Tingzan's performance was mixed.</p>

<p>General Comments on Yesterday's Men's and Women's Track and Field Finals (Liao)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Men's Finals <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>100 Meters</p>
<p>Amidst the spirited sounds of military music, the announcer, with the force of a general issuing commands, proclaimed the start of the men's 100-meter final. The eight men who had qualified were already waiting at the starting line. As they drew lots to determine their positions, those who drew the fifth and sixth lanes grumbled under their breath, for within ten meters of the starting point, these lanes were uneven and unusually soft. Gu Zaiping and Hao Chunde, upon seeing their numbers, simultaneously exclaimed ("Oh dear, unlucky!"). Once the positions were set, the starting gun fired. Gu Zaiping, eager to win, jumped the gun. A second shot was fired, and Hao Chunde was also found to have moved before the signal. Jiang Xiangqing, enforcing the rules rigorously, announced that both Gu and Hao had each committed a foul. A second foul would result in disqualification. At this point, the air was thick with tension, and each runner's breath came in short gasps. During the third start, everyone was cautious and careful, so the start was relatively even, except for Zhong Lianji, who lagged slightly behind. Up to the 50-meter mark, Zhong was still in the rear. At this point, Hao Chunde was in the lead, followed by Yang Kaizuo, then Gu Zaiping, Zhong Lianji, and Lin Guangxing, all very close. After 70 meters, Zhong emerged to the right of Hao, and by the finish line, he had passed everyone to take first place. Hao Chunde, Yang Kaizuo, and Gu Zaiping followed, in that order. Lin Guangxing, still weak from illness, was unable to compete with the other athletes and failed to place. The time was 11.8 seconds, a remarkable achievement considering the strong southerly wind blowing head-on. The reporter is confident that in the upcoming National Games, Zhong will compete with athletes from various provinces and cities to win the championship and bring glory to our city.</p>
<h3 id="e97">200 Meters <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>After Lin Guangxing and Zeng Rongzhong withdrew from the semi-finals, the competition for the 200-meter race was reduced. The final order of finish was identical to the 100-meter race. Yang Kaizuo had made progress, surpassing the veteran Gu Zaiping twice. It was said that Gu Zaiping had lacked practice during the summer vacation, so his performance had declined. The reporter recalls that Gu did not perform well in last year's city games. Superstitiously speaking, Gu seems to have no luck at city games, otherwise, in the Jiangnan University Games and in matches against the McLing and Bai Hong teams, Gu could often finish in the lead, and would not necessarily be defeated by Zhong and Hao.</p>
<h3 id="e98">400 Meters <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Before the games, everyone believed that the 400-meter championship would belong to Zeng Rongzhong of Jinan University. However, after seeing Guan Changfa's stride and time in the preliminary 400-meter race, which was only one-fifth of a second behind Zeng Rongzhong's, people realized that Zeng had a strong rival. Furthermore, after Zeng Rongzhong withdrew from the 200-meter semi-finals due to physical discomfort, dizziness, and blurred vision, informed observers thought that the 400-meter title was in danger for Zeng, and that Guan Changfa had a great opportunity. The 400-meter race involves both speed and endurance, and it is extremely difficult to win such a fierce competition if one is not feeling well. The results of yesterday's race were as expected: Guan won with a time of 53 and 3/5 seconds. Zeng, after a fierce battle, managed to secure second place, but after finishing, his face was pale, and he lay on the ground for a long time. After some massage, he gradually managed to stand up. When asked about the reason, it was learned that Zeng had been suffering from poor digestion and abdominal discomfort for several days. According to the sports instructor at Jinan University, Zeng usually doesn't pay much attention to his diet and often buys snacks, which has caused him stomach problems. This is the harm of an unrestrained diet. Zeng had previously traveled north with the Jiangnan track and field team and suffered from diarrhea due to improper food, which prevented him from participating in the competition. This newspaper reported on this matter in detail. It is hoped that Zeng will pay attention to food hygiene in the future and avoid eating randomly, because if an athlete's body is not feeling well during training, not only will they be unable to improve, but they will also be unable to maintain their current condition, and may even regress. It is hoped that Zeng will take this to heart.</p>
<h3 id="e99">800 Meters <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>There were twelve runners in the 800-meter final. Zhou Bin led during the first lap, with a lead of about five meters. Until the turn of the second lap, Qiu Lingru caught up from behind. As they entered the grandstand, Qiu was in first place, Chen Xingpei was second, Zhou Bin was third, and Xia Xianwu was fourth. The spectators all thought that the order of finish was set, but Xia Xianwu had excellent stamina and surged forward, passing Zhou Bin and catching up with Chen Xingpei. He finished not far behind Qiu. It was observed that Qiu Lingru consistently ran on the outside lane and tried to take the lead on the turns, which put him at a disadvantage. If Qiu can pay attention to this, his performance should improve.</p>
<h3 id="e100">1500 Meters <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Hugen, a native of Korea, had a strong and well-proportioned body, making him an ideal athlete for track and field events. He participated in yesterday's 1500-meter final and led from start to finish. Zhu Shaohua followed closely behind, less than a few meters behind. After three laps, the positions of the leading runners did not change much. After the turn on the third lap, Zhu Shaohua briefly ran shoulder-to-shoulder with Zhang. However, Zhang also exerted himself and realized that this was a critical moment, so he did not relax for a moment. At this point, both runners had great speed, leaving those behind far behind. In the end, Zhang finished first, Zhu finished second, Tang Xianzhou finished third, and Chen Xingpei finished fourth. Someone familiar with the inner workings of Tongji University said that Tang Xianzhou and Zhang Hugen are both students at Tongji. Zhang practices long-distance running every day, usually alone. Seeing that Tang had potential, he often encouraged him and provided guidance. As a result, Tang's performance improved significantly. In that case, Tang is Zhang's disciple, and it is no surprise that both finished in the lead today, making them two outstanding individuals from the same school. Observing Tang's posture and attitude yesterday, he appeared natural and relaxed, showing great potential. It is hoped that Tang will surpass Zhang in the future, which is what the reporter hopes for.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Men's High Hurdles <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>High hurdle talent is extremely difficult to cultivate. In recent years, few new talents have been discovered. Chen Guojun, who emerged at the last National Games, did not participate this time, so the final race lacked excitement. Of the six who qualified for the final, one dropped out before the race, so only five started. Before starting, Cao Yu stretched his legs vigorously on the side of the track. The reporter asked him why he was exerting himself so much. Cao replied, "My leg muscles are injured, and I need to do these exercises to avoid falling over the hurdles." After the start, Cao had great speed and was far ahead of the other four, but he knocked down two hurdles. Spectators were worried about him, but fortunately, he overcame the difficulties. After clearing the first hurdle, they felt relieved. He reached the finish line in just 17.4 seconds, which is not a great time, but it was one of the best performances of the day, considering the headwind and the soft track. The others were far behind.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Men's Medium Hurdles <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Medium hurdles have only been introduced to this city for about six months, so the event is not very popular. In the five-person final, everyone finished in their positions safely, except for Da Mao (Sun Huipei), who fell and injured himself at the second hurdle before the finish line. Tao Yingjie finished first, Chen Buzhang finished second, Yang Bingyuan finished third, and Zhang Jinrong finished fourth. The times were not good and were far from Tao's national record set at the National Games. Tao ran with his body upright and his head up, indicating a lack of strong abdominal muscles. It is hoped that Tao will practice abdominal exercises more in the future, as well as the 800-meter run, in order to compete with Chen Ling of Beijing at the National Games.</p>

<p>Shot Put</p>
<p>Fourteen people signed up for the competition, but only half showed up, which is a joke. Among the seven participants, only four threw over nine meters, which was very disappointing. Chen Baoqiu was indeed weakened by illness, throwing only 10.09 meters, finishing third. Cao Yu finished first, with a score of 10.54 meters, which was 1.1 meters less than Chen's score at the National Games.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Triple Jump <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, Wang Jihuai has dominated the triple jump in all major and minor sporting events. However, yesterday Wang injured his ankle on the first jump. Although he tried to continue jumping, he was unable to achieve a good score and was eliminated. Wang said that if his ankle swells due to the sprain, he would not be able to participate in the pentathlon or decathlon tomorrow. If this happens, today's all-around competition will be less exciting. Li Lin, who practiced diligently during the summer vacation, made a lot of progress. Yesterday, he jumped 13.04 meters to win first place, which was not easy. Second place went to Liang Tiancheng, third place went to Liu Mengling, and fourth place went to Fan Jiaju, all with scores above 12.3 meters.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Pole Vault <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The number of participants in the pole vault was the lowest, indicating the difficulty of this event. Yesterday's competition for the championship was expected to be between Cao Yu and Li Lin. When they reached 3.26 meters, all the other competitors were eliminated, leaving only Cao and Li. Unexpectedly, after jumping over 3.26 meters, Cao's old leg injury suddenly caused him pain, so he stopped competing. As a result, Li won first place without much effort, and with this jump, he tied with Wang Jihuai for first place in individual field events. Some say that Li was blessed with good luck.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Javelin Throw <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The javelin throw is Wang Jihuai's specialty, but yesterday Wang failed, which was considered strange. It was later learned that, as predicted in this newspaper's previous report, Wang lacked practice due to his foot injury, which weakened his arm muscles. Despite his efforts, he only threw over 43 meters, losing to Liu Jiayu, who threw 44.07 meters, and finishing second. Wang also had to prepare for the triple jump, so he quickly threw a few times, which was also a minor cause of his failure. However, in the reporter's view, this situation is a good sign. The veteran's failure shows that there are rising stars.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Women's Track and Field: 50 Meters and 100 Meters <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Zhang Ping could have been carefree in the 50-meter and 100-meter races, but since the arrival of Ms. Situ Wei, a famous athlete from Guangdong, she was filled with anxiety. On the one hand, she trained hard day and night, and on the other hand, she inquired about Situ's true strength. Only after the preliminary and semi-final races the other day did she finally feel relieved. However, as a result of this, her performance has improved slightly, which is truly the effect of mutual encouragement. In the competition, Situ finished second in both events.</p>
<h3 id="e108">200 Meters <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The women's 200-meter race has always been Liu Jingzhen's specialty, but since Ms. Qian Xingsu emerged, Ms. Liu could only retreat. There were seven runners in yesterday's women's 200-meter race. Unexpectedly, at the 100-meter mark, Ms. Li Jingwen suddenly fell, looking very pitiful. As a result, only six reached the finish line. Ms. Li was in a very forward position at the 100-meter mark. If she had not fallen, she might have had a chance of placing. Ms. Li was extremely unlucky.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Low Hurdles <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yang Ren is a pillar of the Liangjiang basketball team and is capable in all kinds of sports. She happened to participate in the low hurdles race yesterday and the day before, and unexpectedly won first place. The reporter met the track and field coach of Liangjiang yesterday, who said that Ms. Yang had never practiced low hurdles. Ms. Yang is truly a sports genius. However, if Ms. Qian Xingsu had not fallen in the preliminary race the other day, there would have been a competition between her and Ms. Yang in yesterday's women's low hurdles final.</p>

<p>The women's javelin is a newly created sport in Shanghai. Recalling the spring middle school games, there were very few women participating in the javelin, and among these few, their posture was incorrect. Although there was no surprising progress in yesterday's competition results, the posture, the way of holding the javelin and the turning movements were all satisfactory. This shows the effect of several months of instruction.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Shot Put Final <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Shot put is originally a competition of body weight. Now that it is applied to women, the effect should be the same. But today's women mostly have slender figures, how can they win this heavy skill competition and get good results. In yesterday's competition, Ms. Han Wanzhen won the first place with a score of 8.11 meters. Her posture was still good.</p>

<p>Flower News Retreats</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Municipal Games. Because it happened to be a weekday, and the track and field competition was also the final day, the audience was packed and the number of people increased, and the grand occasion surpassed the first day. At about 4 pm, there was a light rain, and the audience stood on their toes, their interest was very high, and it did not diminish due to the rain. Only the track and field finished all finals at about 5 pm, and the visitors left one after another. The baseball game closed later. Scattered short news, summarized as follows,</p>
<h3 id="e113">Women's Shot Put First Han Wanzhang <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>(Taken by the museum)</p>
<p>▲ The broadcasting machine was moved to the site and installed on the podium. The broadcasting machine, together with two loudspeakers, was moved to the field yesterday. After each competition, the numbers and performance records of all the winners were reported to the public one by one. The handling was quick and commendable. There are several kinds of track and field competitions in this year. The men's and women's groups have exceeded the last record. When the reporter loudly shouted that the record had been exceeded, the audience applauded and shouted "Good", and the cheers were thunderous.</p>
<p>▲ The Boy Scouts were busy yesterday. The number of Boy Scouts serving in the field was more than doubled compared to the previous day. In addition to the coaches, there were about 115 people in total. However, because the venue was large and the audience was packed, the distribution was still insufficient. Before each competition, the reporter must shout loudly (Boy Scouts, pay attention). The team members ran around, and their busyness was not inferior to that of the referees and photographers. Some spectators did not buy tickets and sneaked into the baseball field through the gaps in the fence. This happened a lot, so the Boy Scouts sighed that they could not take care of everything while maintaining order. After adding more team members, the situation returned to normal.</p>
<p>▲ 214 Dislocation. During the semi-final of the middle hurdles, contestant No. 114, Sun Huipei, suddenly dislocated his leg joint before reaching the finish line and fell to the ground in pain. The audience was discolored. Fortunately, the Boy Scouts were not far away and quickly used a stretcher to carry Sun to the rescue platform. The medical staff massaged him and poured medicine into him, and the pain began to subside. Sun had already touched the railing when he jumped over the first railing, but he still struggled forward to overtake the first place. Who knew that the old problem would recur when he reached the second railing. He finally fell to the ground after the third to fourth railing. The referees and others all lamented.</p>
<p>▲ A small statistic. There were more photographers in the field than the day before. According to someone who spoke to someone, he checked that there were 28 photographers in the field during the women's 200-meter final, excluding those who filmed moving films. At the same time, there were 14 female guests and 4 children sitting on the podium, and only one male guest, which shows that the women's world pays attention to sports.</p>
<p>▲ The smell of turpentine oil rushes to the nose. Yesterday was the day of the track and field finals. The athletes were all refreshed and determined to compete. Therefore, the sales of turpentine oil were greatly畅. In the shed-style lounge, the smell of oil was sometimes散扬 in the air. Walking past it, the fragrance rushed straight to the nose. People said that applying oil to slippery feet, and it is not诬也.</p>
<p>▲ The female volleyball players took a trip in vain. In the volleyball competition among the ball games, yesterday there was only Tianzi Group Shanghai against Jiaotong University, and Fudan against Jiaotong University or Shanghai. At about 3:30 pm, more than a dozen female volleyball players from Dongliang浩浩蕩蕩, came straight to the baseball ground. The clerk was asked where the competition was. Someone was very strange at the time and said (there is no women's volleyball match today). Ms. Qin of Southeast then showed a certain newspaper, saying that it clearly had the word "competition". After explaining it clearly, they realized that it was a misunderstanding and dispersed. However, the female volleyball players took a trip in vain, and they could not help but feel悻悻 in their hearts.</p>

<p>Football match held after the opening ceremony</p>
<p>Zhang Xinfu, deputy secretary of the National Games, came to Shanghai yesterday for official business. The details of the National Games are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ On schedule. The preparatory office sent someone to visit Chairman Jiang. Regarding whether the conference would be held on schedule, Chairman Jiang 面嘱, regardless of the rumors from the outside world, the preparations will be made to open the conference on time. Therefore, the postponement of the event is due to limited funds云,</p>
<p>▲ Unit registration. The number of units registered this year is no less than last year. Malaysia will arrive in Shanghai soon. Hubei Province, which was the most severely affected by the disaster, also sent a telegram saying that it has decided to participate. Other than Guangdong, there are no major problems. There should be more than 2,500 athletes. Malaysia电知 said that all except baseball will参、云加,</p>
<p>▲ Opening order. It is now scheduled to open at 1 pm on National Day. A football match will be held after the ceremony. The track and field will start the next day, counting four days云. Chairman Jiang must participate in the military parade on the morning of National Day, so it was changed to the afternoon to hold the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>▲ Venue construction. Everything has been completed and ready for acceptance. However, because of the heavy rain, the coal cinder placed on the banks of the Xiaguan River for the runway was washed away by the water and has been dug up from other places, so it has not yet been completed云.</p>

<p>In this year's Robber Cup International Tennis Tournament, our Chinese players Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai went to the front line and worked hard for the country. They defeated Portugal a few days ago and won the right to the final. Although it seems troublesome, there are still few risks. Yesterday they fought against England and retained the championship for another year. It was indeed obtained through fearless spirit and hard work. The skills of De Fu, a famous English player, are extraordinary after all. If his partner had been someone else, then the world would not know who the championship would have fallen into that day. Before the Central War, there was still a mixed doubles final. After an hour of competition, the team of Karna Follo and Kella 女 won the championship by defeating the team of Butt and Ms. Firth with a score of six to one six to three,</p>

<p>De Fu, the Head of the Heroes</p>
<p>Lin and Qiu Did Not Show Their Skills</p>
<p>Tek is Relatively Inferior</p>
<p>The Chinese and English players participating in this final are all giants in the tennis world, and it is indeed not an exaggeration to call it a meeting of famous players. De Fu's goalkeeping skills are rare in Shanghai before. He is tall and has long arms, and he jumps like flying. The ball is hard and difficult to resist. Lin Shuhua was eclipsed by this, but Qiu Feihai was still able to deal with it. He deserves to be the head of the heroes. Lin Baohua's signature serve lost its power, but his pressure ball and net still worked as expected. Qiu Feihai's successful smash was not often seen, but his footwork was fast and his position was correct. In short, the two people's stunt was gradually discovered in the last three sets, but it was still not to the peak耳特克's performance was relatively inferior, especially when the light was dark, his eyes were dull and he was greatly affected, which led to a fall from grace.</p>
<h3 id="e118">English People are Furious <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>

<p>(Taken by the museum)</p>
<p>▲ A Sudden Storm. Lin连连 won against the Englishman De Fu's砲彈 ball, and then served to夺得 a局. Lin Baohua's serve was disappointing, and he lost another局. De Fu and Tek guarded the net, and Lin and Qiu were helpless and waited for defeat. Before long, De Tek had taken a 5-0 lead. Qiu's lan ball was powerful, and Lin's split was effective,夺得 three局, and the vitality was gradually coming. However, De Fu did not show mercy and added four球 to win a局. As a result, he won the first set with a score of 6-3.</p>
<p>▲ A Thousand Miles. In the second set, De Fu used his invincible net skills, and he won every match. Lin and Qiu were birds startled by the bow, and they were at a loss. In addition, Tek尽厥职, so局又局, they all went into the hands of De Tek. When the situation was 0-4, Lin and Qiu finally发奋 and won one局 after a hard fight. The opponent continued to attack fiercely, and it became a 5-1 situation. China won two more局 and finally lost the second set with a score of 3-6.</p>

<p>Retain the Championship this Year</p>
<p>Worthy of the True Colors of Heroes</p>
<p>▲ After the hardship, De Fu lost his serve, which seemed to be a bad omen. Lin and Qiu's techniques gradually developed, and they changed endlessly. The ball that was hit was concentrated on Tek's side, and De Fu did not use his skills. Tek was flustered. After the hardship, he won four consecutive局. De Tek联合作战,奪去 two局. Lin and Qiu were determined to win and An肯 fell short. They worked hard and progressed to win the fourth盘 with a score of 6-3.</p>
<p>▲ A glimmer of hope. Lin and Qiu won a盘, and their vitality was勃发. The fine rain hit their faces, but the fighting continued. The situation on both sides was tense, and victory and defeat were seen each other. The轉來 of a glimmer of hope in China was under the situation of three and four局. The twists and turns and efforts of the struggle that passed through were dazzling to the viewers, and the contestants were frightened, and the performance was wonderful, especially the crown of the whole局. Fifteen 平手 hits were hit in a row before China夺来, creating a four-four和数. After this, Lin and Qiu prevailed and won the fourth盘 with a score of 7-5.</p>
<p>▲ Lin and Qiu have each won two盘, and the number of勝负 is系 in this last盘. Both sides have the opportunity to win, and Lin and Qiu转和 from defeat, and the聲勢转旺. In局又局, each other费尽心血, to分胜负平数累见, the tension can be known. After五五, 千钧一发, life and death系之. Lin and Qiu suddenly had a clear cooperative performance. Qiu's serve, all以软劲见长,以净四之数, creating a 6-5 advantage. In the last局, Qiu saved a球 in a desperate situation, and the achievement was made. Qiu's achievements are诚在林氏之上. The result of the fifth盘 was 7-5, and China won, so that it could retain the championship,</p>

<h3 id="e128">Gold Market Erratic Last Week <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Entirely Subject to Speculation</p>
<p>▲Swap spread speculators once pushed the price higher. Gold prices fluctuated dramatically last week, influenced by fleeting winds and rain. Daily fluctuations ranged from six, seven, to over ten taels. People were confused and found it difficult to predict the market, due to conflicting international news, particularly the influence of speculation. Starting from over 770 taels at the beginning of the week, the price reached a high of 75 taels and 2 mace on Wednesday, before suddenly plummeting to a low of 54 taels the following day, then hovering around 60 taels. Finally, it dropped another 7 taels and 1 mace, resulting in a total difference of 21 taels and 2 mace during the week. The silver market trended upward, and drafts also lengthened by one and a half notches, likely because the internal bank exchange rate for British gold had exceeded one shilling and three pence. Gold dealers continued to sell, shorting about 1 million pounds of British gold to date, with some hedging transactions. The initial premium was about 30 taels, peaking at over 40 taels, then returning to around 30 taels. Cash reserves were not very abundant, but a certain bank was buying, causing the current swap spread to tend toward an advance, pressuring short positions, hence the temporary rise in gold prices. Currently, the long position parties include Yongheng, Xinheng, a Mr. Luo, Bingxing drafts hedgers, and Mr. Lu. Guangbang Hengxing, Yifeng, etc., have also flipped to long positions. It is also rumored that speculator Mr. Wu, who originally held a short position, has been continuously covering. However, Dalianbang still holds 4,000 to 5,000 short positions, and Yuan Maoyong and Japanese merchants are also short. Merchandise hedgers such as Dadecheng have made some deliveries recently. Will there be a reversal in market prices during the swap spread period? Here is a summary of the week's events: ▲Fleeting winds and rain, daily fluctuations of over ten taels. From Monday (September 7th), the major bill rate rose by 0.0625 to 0.125. The silver price rose by 0.125, the shilling lengthened by half a notch, and the internal exchange rate seemed looser. Dealers sold off a significant amount, causing the gold price to open slightly lower by 1 tael and 2 mace, at 769 taels. The news of a bank failure in the United States had no major impact. Subsequently, selling pressure caused the price to fall to 65 taels and 1 mace, before rising to 69 taels and 3 mace due to hedging purchases. At noon, it fell again to 66 taels and 5, closing at 7 taels and 5. In the afternoon, those who had sold in the morning rushed to cover, causing the price to rise to 72 taels and 1 mace, closing at 71 taels and 6 mace, a gain of 1 tael and 4 mace from the previous Saturday. Mr. Wu, a speculator, bought in. Guangbang went short and then long. The next day, the major bill rate rose again by 0.0625. The silver price was unchanged, the shilling unchanged, and the internal exchange rate was flat. Dealers sold more than they bought.

The gold price opened higher by 1 tael and 2 mace, at 74 taels and 7 mace. US stocks saw a small decline, leading to 5 taels and 2 mace. Later, news broke that a silver price conference had been decided upon and a date for convening had been set. Consequently, long position holders such as Chen, Wu, Long, and Luo sold heavily, causing the market price to collapse precipitously, plummeting by over ten taels. The wave was turbulent. At 3:43 PM, it suddenly fell to 56 and a half taels. Guangbang came in to buy, recovering to 59 taels, closing at 7 taels and 8 mace. In the afternoon, buying pressure seemed stronger, showing signs of reversal. A certain bank also bought in, so the price was 61 taels and 4 mace around 3 PM. However, large Indian remittance reports pushed the price back down to 58 taels and 4 mace, closing at 60 taels and 2 mace, a sharp drop of 13 taels and 3 mace from the previous day, with a total difference of 18 taels and 7 mace throughout the day. The next day, the major bill rate rose by 0.0625 to 0.125, the silver price increased by 0.375, the shilling lengthened by one notch, but the internal exchange rate improved. It was truly a case of contrasting bright and dark prospects. The gold price initially opened at 61 and a half taels, then 63 taels. Due to the news that the silver conference had failed, sentiment improved. Suddenly, Mr. Lu sold, causing the price to plunge to 54 taels. Afterwards, large players rushed to buy, closing at 64 taels at noon. There was a difference of 10 taels in half a day. In the afternoon, Indian remittance reports were small and large players bought in. A certain bank also made purchases, so the price rose to 67 and a half taels, closing at 64 taels and 9 mace, a recovery of 4 taels and 7 mace from the previous day, with a total of 13 and a half taels fluctuating. Large players all bought in. On Friday, the major bill rate contracted by 0.0625, the silver price decreased by 0.125, the shilling remained the same, and the internal exchange rate seemed looser. The gold price opened lower by 1 tael and 1 mace, at 63 taels and 8 mace. Later, Wu and Lu rushed to buy in, already exceeding 70 taels, to 71 taels and 8 mace, closing at 70 taels and 2 mace at noon. In the afternoon, there were rumors that India would adopt silver coinage. The market was greatly shocked by this news, and selling pressure intensified, plunging over 7 taels, suddenly to 63 taels and 2 mace. Guangbang bought in again, rising to 66 taels and 8 mace.</p>
<p>By the close, it was 65 taels and 9 mace, still up 1 tael from the previous day. The front and back markets fluctuated a total of 8 taels and 6 mace. On Saturday, the major bill rate rebounded by 0.125, the silver price increased by 0.125, the shilling did not move, and the internal exchange rate seemed looser. The gold price opened at 58 taels and 5, a decrease of 7 taels and 4 mace, because the major bill was expected to contract on the 11th, but it did not, causing sentiment to weaken. It then rebounded from 9 taels and a half to 6 taels and 8 mace. Afterwards, Guangbang bought in again, gradually rising, but fluctuating. At noon, it was 64 taels, then 61 taels and 8 mace, closing at 63 taels and 1 mace, a further decrease of 2 taels and 8 mace from the previous day, with a total of 7 taels and 2 mace fluctuating in half a day.

The interbank lending rate in the market fell slightly by half a li, to 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 7 hao 5 si in the morning and 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 5 si in the afternoon. The situation was rather sluggish.

The amount of drafts made was 335,000 in the morning and 580,000 in the afternoon. There were no transactions in banknotes in either market.

<h3 id="e131">Bond Prices Fell Sharply Last Week <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Down by About 2-3 Yuan from the Previous Week</p>
<p>Transactions Exceeded 13.8 Million</p>
<p>Last week, the bond market situation at the Shanghai Securities Exchange saw continuous scarcity in spot transactions, with only 38,000 yuan traded throughout the week. The futures market was extremely lively, with each of Monday and Wednesday seeing 18-19 million traded, and Tuesday, Thursday, and the weekend seeing 23-24 million each. Friday saw the highest volume, with nearly 30 million yuan traded in a single day. Total transactions for the week reached 13,876,000 yuan. The most active trading was in the China Consolidated Tax 2.0 bonds. Consolidated tax bonds accounted for 27,495,000 yuan for September and 10,745,000 yuan for October. China Consolidated Tax 2.0 bonds accounted for 23,035,000 yuan for September and 6,780,000 yuan for October. The salt tax market was also very active, accounting for 24,470,000 yuan, with 18,895,000 yuan for September and 5,575,000 yuan for October. Other bonds also outperformed, such as China Consolidated 2.0 bonds, accounting for 10,795,000 yuan for September and 2,935,000 yuan for October. The demobilization bonds accounted for 6,595,000 yuan for September and 3,480,000 yuan for October. The 1.9 customs bonds totaled 7,860,000, the 1.9 reconstruction bonds totaled 6,295,000 yuan, the reorganization bonds totaled 6,035,000 yuan, the 9.6 public bonds totaled 1,045,000 yuan, and the fully consolidated customs tariffs totaled 580,000 yuan. There was also 10,000 yuan for 1918 bonds and 25,000 yuan for financial bonds. Total transaction volume exceeded the previous week by over 57.3 million yuan. Regarding the price movements of various bonds within the past week, due to the issuance of new bonds, supply exceeded demand in the market. Furthermore, with the vast national disaster areas this time, there were concerns that future tax revenues would decrease, and rumors of military actions frequently spread, causing unease in the market. Sellers were eager to sell, and speculative selling was also active. Selling pressure dominated the market, and bond prices uniformly fell sharply under this pressure, falling by 1-2 yuan on Monday. On Tuesday, they fell by a small 0.5-0.6 yuan to 1 yuan and several jiao. Wednesday and Thursday each fell by about 1 yuan, with a very strong continuous decline, causing considerable tension in the market. However, on Friday, there was a sudden and significant rebound, as short-sellers covered their profits and the market took advantage of the low prices to invest. The strength of the rebound far exceeded the previous decline. On this day, bonds such as the China Consolidated 2.0 and salt tax bonds jumped by over 3 yuan, and others also rose by about 2 yuan. However, sentiment turned negative again on the weekend, and prices weakened, resulting in a net decrease of 2-3 yuan compared to the previous week. Only the 9.6 1918 bonds had no major fluctuations. Looking at the bond market situation, it is expected to gradually return to stability in the short term. The following is a statistical table of the high and low price fluctuations of various bonds within the past week (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e132">Yarn and Cotton – Yarn Market Listless Last Week <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Actual Sales Extremely Sluggish</p>
<p>The yarn market last week showed no signs of glory or disgrace. The market situation was extremely listless. Due to the base price, there were fewer new sellers. However, the overall situation was very bad. There were many rumors about the current situation, which did not affect sentiment much, and it was entirely due to the overestimation of the base price. Furthermore, the large players had not given up the idea of selling short. A certain large merchant once again lost money by covering a short position. A certain Japanese trading firm viewed the severity of the Chinese floods and feared that actual sales would be greatly affected in the future. Therefore, they were extremely bearish and sold off a significant amount, putting a lot of pressure on the market. As for the large Chinese merchants, their attitude remained negative, but there were fewer vigorous sellers, so they maintained a firm stance this week. The US cotton situation was very soft on the weekend, but the price of third-grade yarn tended to rise, causing profit-takers to cover short positions, and the market rose. As a result, the price of benchmark yarn for each month rose by one or two taels compared to the previous week. The sales of spot yarn among customer firms became even more sluggish. There was no large-scale activity from any party. Japanese firms issued a significant amount of forward yarn, and the prices were relatively low, all of which were accepted by Japanese trading firms. The future of the yarn market is still uncertain. However, the world cotton industry situation is still in a state of despair.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Cotton Market Hovering Last Week <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>New Cotton Arriving in Abundance</p>
<p>The cotton market has been in a state of flux for a week, but the overall situation is very dangerous. The second estimate of the world surplus of American cotton showed an increase in production of over 100,000 bales. Fortunately, prices were temporarily maintained and did not fall. However, Japanese merchants purchased cheap Indian cotton and sold benchmark cotton, which slightly affected the market. Local cotton was damaged by floods from various routes, and the annual yield was greatly reduced. Therefore, most cotton merchants were in a long position, holding tight and not releasing. However, most people viewed the foreign surplus and vigorously sold short. Traders showed little interest in spot cotton transactions. However, the long and short sides held their positions more and more forcefully. The price of benchmark cotton for each month was similar to the previous week. New cotton was arriving in abundance. American cotton fell by 5 pounds compared to the previous week, according to reports.</p>
<h3 id="e134">American Cotton Falls, British and Indian Cotton Rise Slightly <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to a lack of major buyers, good weather, and Southern hedging sales. Futures fell by 7-11 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose 2-3 points, and spot prices rose 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged. Indian cotton short sellers covered their positions, and the market was firm. The price of Pingguoer rose by 1.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2 rupees, according to original telegrams (dated the 12th).</p>

<p>▲The market in the southern city yesterday saw stable openings for all goods except new japonica rice. Arrivals were still abundant, and sales were more active. Thick japonica rice was in high demand and expensive, while thin early rice was overstocked and sluggish. Appetite was dull. A few dozen shi were sold in the local street retail market, and the price fell by another 1 jiao. Although there were scattered shipments of refined Shanghai rice, appetite was also thin, and market prices followed suit. The volume of variable silver dollar goods was low and showed no gains or losses. Digestion of new japonica rice was acceptable, and the situation was stable.</p>
<p>▲The rice market at the New Gate was still active. Shops took advantage of the momentum to add to their inventories. However, the river foot rice market was more active than before. Coarse japonica rice from Su and Chang areas trended upward. Due to the influence of this in the local area, there were not many arriving shipments of customer refined rice, and factory prices remained firm. The opening price in the morning showed a slight improvement. New japonica rice, thin rice, and thick japonica rice all rose by 1 jiao. Refined Shanghai rice saw two flat arrivals and sales, and prices did not rise or fall. The river foot market saw 4,000 dan open.</p>

<p>Cocoon Shops Release Prices to Compete for Purchases…Cocoon Prices Rise to 100 Yuan</p>
<p>The autumn silkworm rearing in the four rural districts of Wuxi is quite active. Unfortunately, the most important period of dormancy was plagued by wind and rain, followed by major floods. Mulberry fields were submerged, resulting in a shortage of raw materials, and cocoon prices rose surprisingly. Each dan required about 4 yuan. The silkworms were damaged by cold rain, and diseases such as white spots were discovered. Early silkworm cocoons have already entered the market, and late silkworms have also been caged. It is estimated that cocoon production will be no more than 60%. Cocoon shops in various districts have been releasing prices to compete for purchases, and cocoon prices have been rising. The northeast district is the highest, with high-quality foreign variety cocoons already reaching 100 yuan. The southwest districts are also at 85-90 yuan. It is expected that prices will continue to rise in the future, it was said.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and metal transactions were even scarcer as a result. There were few general goods in the market, and no large-scale transactions could be said to have taken place. However, the price of new lead wire, which has long been in short supply, fell sharply yesterday as there were many sellers and few buyers. The standard price fell by 1 qian and a half, selling for 13 taels (Nos. 16-20). As for Nos. 21-25, each dan was only valued at 18 taels and 5 qian. According to yesterday's market opening, there were only 300-400 dan. In addition, various iron shops saw only minor amounts of incoming and outgoing goods, so there were no gains or losses, it was said.</p>

<p>Kong Xiangxi replied to Wu Tiecheng, saying: Urgent, Brother Wu Tiecheng, Committee Member, Beiping, respectful greetings. Secret. Yue Jun forwarded the grey telegram, which was received. The three gentlemen wept bitterly and presented their words, hoping to recover the nation's fortunes. These words of wisdom are widely beneficial. I deeply admire and comfort you. There should be no shortage of patriots in Guangdong. Reading it will surely cause them to awaken suddenly. If they can abandon their suspicions and resentments, and rein in their horses and turn their spears, the survival of the party and the nation depends on this. I am determined for peace, but I am ashamed of my weak power. I am delighted to hear of your esteemed telegram, which truly resonates with my heart. If there is a reply from the Guangdong side, I eagerly await to be informed. Please convey my humble sentiments to the two gentlemen, Shi and Pu. Respectfully, Kong Xiangxi bows. Text.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Song Ziwen Returned to Nanjing Last Night <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Before leaving, he convened Zhu Qinglan and others for discussions.</p>
<p>Public Announcement by the Disaster Relief Committee Regarding Funds Received Before and After</p>
<p>More than 2 million silver dollars, over 70,000 taels of silver.</p>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, after convening a plenary meeting of the Flood Relief Committee during his last visit to Shanghai, also convened a meeting of the Standing Committee the day before yesterday, deciding on methods for transporting American wheat and other items. It is now learned that Mr. Song, due to the importance of financial affairs, took the Shanghai night express train back to Nanjing at 11:45 last night to attend to his duties, and is expected to come to Shanghai again next Wednesday or Thursday to handle disaster relief matters. Mr. Song also convened Zhu Qinglan, a standing committee member of the association, and other committee members for discussions before leaving Shanghai at 10:00 yesterday morning. The discussions lasted for about an hour before they dispersed.</p>
<p>▲ Financial Group Announces Funds Received. The Financial Group of the Disaster Relief Committee issued another announcement yesterday, expressing gratitude for the second round of generous donations from all sectors at home and abroad, totaling 1,489,649.49 yuan, 2,891.00 small silver dollars. The total funds received before and after amounted to 2,534,224.55 silver dollars, 2,935.00 small silver dollars, and 3,318 copper coins. The second round also received 11,531.79 taels of silver, bringing the total amount of silver received before and after to 73,316.70 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Li and Bei, Two Committee Members, Travel to Hankou. Mr. Li Jin, a committee member of the Hankou Branch of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, returned to Hankou by China National Aviation Corporation plane yesterday morning at 7:00 after reporting in Shanghai on his last flight. Mr. Baker, a foreign committee member of the association, is scheduled to go to Hankou to work tomorrow (Tuesday).</p>
<h3 id="e151">Disaster Relief News from Various Provinces Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Starting to Centralize the Accommodation of Disaster Victims</p>
<p>▲ Disaster Victims Arrive Unceasingly. The number of disaster victims arriving from Jiangbei and Jiujiang has been increasing in recent days. The night before last, there were seven or eight hundred people by train, and yesterday there were two or three hundred people arriving from Jiujiang. Today, Taikoo's ship is also bringing more, arriving continuously. The city's disaster relief office had not received prior notice, and the sudden arrival of disaster victims, coupled with the scarcity of personnel, made the handling quite difficult. As of yesterday morning, the number of people accommodated had reached more than 1,700. After arriving in Shanghai, most of the Jiangbei disaster victims sought out relatives and friends and scattered in all directions. Even if they wanted to be accommodated, they were unwilling. However, those who could not find relatives and friends were left wandering on the streets, begging for food and money.</p>
<p>▲ Preparations Before Centralization. The disaster relief office invited the heads of various departments and groups yesterday to discuss distribution methods, deciding that at 5:30 today, each department and group would gather at the office, first transporting the disaster victims from the Chaozhou Wuyi Mountain Villa in batches to the first shelter on Liuying Road, then transporting the disaster victims from the Dawang Temple and Yongxi Hall Zhejiang Shaoxing Association, followed by the Qu Zhenren Temple, and then the Chaozhou Hui Mountain Villa disaster victims. This time, the disaster victims were all picked up and transported by China Moving and Transportation Automobile Company at any time, free of charge. As soon as the disaster victims arrived in Shanghai, they were spared the hardship of trekking. For the convenience of the office, Xiang Sheng Automobile Company dispatched a car every day for the office's use, and their enthusiasm was unparalleled.</p>
<p>▲ Facilities After Centralization. In addition to the office and other sheds, the first shelter on Liuying Road currently has 170 rooms available for accommodation, which can accommodate about 1,700 people. Another 230 rooms are under construction, and when fully completed, it can accommodate 4,000 people. Centralization has now begun, and the interior is being tidied and arranged, with much activity. It is planned to receive visitors from all walks of life after a bit of progress has been made. Since the disaster victims come from inland, in addition to Western medical treatment, traditional Chinese medicine treatment is added. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Association has sent personnel to take charge, and 50 beds have also been set up.</p>
<p>▲ Refusal of Alms and Money. The people of this city are happy to provide relief. Since the arrival of the disaster victims in Shanghai, in order to fulfill their purpose of direct giving, they have been giving money, bread, and biscuits to the temporary shelters. At most, each person could receive 1.45 yuan a day. Therefore, there were people who did not know how to be content and deliberately cried out in distress, hoping to enjoy the benefits of charity continuously, causing various difficulties in the management and disposal of the shelter, which was deeply troublesome. A notice was issued to all sectors a few days ago, stating: "Respectfully inform all benefactors that out of compassion for the disaster victims arriving in Shanghai, they have unanimously made the great wish to provide relief, and have directly given to various shelters without consulting this office. Their kindness and compassion are deeply admired. However, the disaster victims come from all directions, and their customs differ. Wandering people are inevitable. We are deeply concerned that the constant stream of charity may arouse the hearts of those who are greedy and opportunistic, or incite them to surround the donors, causing shouts, robberies, and dangers that are difficult to overcome. This office should do its best to protect the disaster victims, and any deficiencies are due to the limitations of the situation. In an instant, the sheds of the first shelter will be completed and centralized accommodation will be realized. We hereby publish this notice to inform all kind-hearted people that in the future, if there are any donations for the disaster victims arriving in Shanghai, whether they are clothes or money, we would be very grateful. However, we hope that the type and quantity of items can be informed to this office in advance, and after negotiating the distribution methods, this office will arrange to do it together on a regular basis to avoid accidents and effectively benefit the disaster victims. Regarding the flour, bread, biscuits, and other items donated by all sectors, since we have already prepared our own supplies, they have been set aside for a while and are easily moldy, and we are especially afraid of wasting them, which would defeat the intention of the gift. If you could give us clothing, blankets, or practical and durable items, the disaster victims would be even more grateful. We respectfully request your consideration, all gentlemen."</p>
<p>▲ Traditional Chinese Medicine Association Serves the Nation. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Association organized two medical teams for disaster victims to serve in the shelters. Later, the office of the shelter sent a letter stating that the disaster victims had gradually gathered in the shelter on Liuying Road, and a Chinese medicine department had been set up inside, requesting them to come to serve. The association reorganized the medical team, and the director of the secretariat, Jiang Wenfang, convened a meeting late into the night, deciding to hire Shi Xingliu and Shao Chunqiao as resident doctors, and Shu as a resident staff member, lodging in the shelter. The volunteer doctors were divided into six groups and dispatched to work in shifts. Various forms were prepared and printed for recording each patient, daily treatment, classification reports, doctor attendance reports, and weekly medical reports. This afternoon at 2:00, all the doctors will depart from the association.</p>
<p>▲ The Salvation Army Undertakes Relief Work in Xinghua. According to the Zi Lin Daily, after the National Government's Flood Relief Committee requested the Salvation Army to undertake relief work in the Xinghua area of Jiangbei, Major Shan Song, the general secretary of the army, and Captain Shi Delan, a staff member, came to Shanghai from Beiping to discuss everything with the Flood Relief Committee. Currently, the disaster situation in Xinghua is becoming more severe, and the water level is almost equal to the city wall. They will rush to the disaster area within a few days to carry out relief. Other staff members of the army have also departed from North China and are heading south. Currently, the relief expenses are borne by the army, and 12,000 yuan has been deposited in HSBC to open a disaster relief account. It is hoped that after soliciting relief from the British and American Salvation Army, a large amount of money can be raised to continuously supply the disaster area. In addition to providing emergency relief, the army will also conduct a detailed survey of the disaster situation in the four townships so that they can provide relief to the affected farmers in the villages as soon as they receive supplies. It is also hoped that a large amount of American wheat can be allocated to be distributed in the county. The salaries and expenses of the relief workers will be paid separately by the army and will not be used for relief funds.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Record of the Yangzhou Association Meeting <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Yangzhou Eight Counties Shanghai Fellow Association convened a meeting again yesterday afternoon at 2:00 to address the urgent relief of the Jiangbei flood. The committee members Shen Dingchen, Li Zhixi, Ruan Mubai, Jiao Dingkai, Xu Fuchen, Zhu Jiuqing, Zhou Yinting, Song Shi, Qian Shusheng, Shi Hanzhang, Chen Yangfu, Cheng Shuzhi, Zhou Yaoting, and over a hundred others attended. Shen Dingchen chaired the meeting, followed by Jiao Dingkai representing the chairman, reporting on the progress of the urgent relief. Then, Committee Member Ruan Mubai introduced Wang Jingting, the chairman of the Yangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, who reported on the disaster situation in Yangzhou. The association immediately pledged 2,000 yuan to be handed over to Chairman Wang to be distributed in Yangzhou, while continuing to raise funds. Committee Member Jiao Dingkai was appointed to attend the National Government's Flood Relief Committee in Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Report on the Work of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association's Various Offices <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mr. Zhu Qiliu from the Gaoyou office of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association reported: Upon my arrival in Gaoyou under orders, I organized an office to engage in temporary relief efforts. However, the Gaoyou dike had breached for over two "li" (approximately 0.6 miles), with surging waves and a sound like thunder. Except for the section at the Pipa Gate south of the city, the area was a vast expanse of water, a veritable swamp. Day after day, refugees flocked in, overwhelming our capacity to accommodate them. They ate in the wind and slept in the dew, a truly miserable sight. They wandered along the dike, everywhere. I was heartbroken and deeply anxious upon witnessing this. I respectfully submit this report detailing our adherence to the agreed-upon relief methods, the current state of our work, and our future plans, for your kind perusal.</p>
<p>A. Past Work Situation:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Rescue Operations: We have requested 40 civilian boats from the Gaoyou Flood Relief Society. When this number is insufficient, we will hire additional boats from this office to go to various villages to conduct rescue operations. Each boat rescues approximately one thousand refugees. After the rescue, they are temporarily sent to shelters. Those who volunteer to go south are sent off accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Accommodation:</p>
<p>a. Shelters: Gaoyou City is submerged in several feet of water, with no dry land to be found. Currently, only the Great King Temple can be used as a shelter. We have temporarily established the First Shelter there. The shelter accommodates over 4,000 refugees daily. Some stay for one night before being sent south, while others remain there permanently. They receive two meals a day, and the order is generally good. The Jieshou branch has established a shelter at Yongxing Temple, accommodating over 400 refugees daily. The situation is largely the same as in Gaoyou.</p>
<p>b. Sending Away: The local authorities are currently arranging for boat transportation. Sailing begins at 8:00 AM daily, with four tugboats transporting over 1,500 refugees each day. If local financial resources are insufficient in the future, this office will subsidize coal to assist with the relief efforts.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Soup Kitchens: The city is submerged in several feet of water, and the number of disaster victims is far greater than outside the city. This is because other charitable organizations are providing temporary relief outside the city, while traffic in the city is cut off, and there are fewer rescuers. Therefore, we first established a soup kitchen at Yongqing Temple in the city. We have already begun investigating, and it will be opened as soon as the investigation is completed. Most of the disaster victims outside the city have gathered at the Taishan Temple, Chengtian Temple, and Tianwang Temple, and the Gaoyou Flood Relief Society is responsible for providing food for them. Disaster victims who have not entered these three places are all registered and released by the First Soup Kitchen at Yongqing Temple in the city.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding Burial: After the river dike collapsed, floating corpses drift with the waves. We have hired staff and boats to search for them. However, they are scattered by the冲激 and even the corpses that have been found have no place to bury them. We are urgently seeking high ground and trying to bury them.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding Epidemic Prevention: We have hired local Chinese and Western doctors to set up an epidemic prevention hospital to carry out prevention.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding Livestock Protection: Disaster victims are everywhere and difficult to accommodate, so livestock protection can only be considered later.</p>
<p>B. Future Work Plan:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Rescue Operations: For disaster victims in remote and impoverished areas who stubbornly cling to their homeland and refuse to move elsewhere, the Jisheng Society is now providing relief in Gaoyou. We plan to consult with them and ask them to take on the relief efforts.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Accommodation:</p>
<p>a. Accommodation: The shelters here are already overcrowded. We do not know how many more people can be accommodated in the shelters in the provinces of Shanghai and Yangzhou. We plan to investigate in detail to allocate and send them.</p>
<p>b. Sending Away: Gaoyou City is entirely submerged in water, and the number of refugees rescued is very large and cannot be accommodated. We plan to set up a temporary transit camp elsewhere as a temporary shelter for refugees going south, providing two meals a day and sending them south the next day.</p>
<p>c. Regarding Soup Kitchens: After the Yongqing Temple soup kitchen is established, if refugees are crowded, we plan to add another one to spread.</p>
<p>d. Regarding Burial: We plan to hire staff and hire more boats to go to the surrounding villages to search for corpses and choose more high ground to bury them to avoid causing an epidemic.</p>
<p>e. Regarding Epidemic Prevention: Please note that all shelters should pay attention to the cleanliness of refugees and take preventive measures. However, it is in deep autumn, and the general disaster victims have not yet stopped crying from hunger, and they will be cold again. The days ahead are long, how can we continue? We urge you to quickly prepare clothing, various medicines for autumn epidemics, and a large amount of relief funds and food to ensure that the disaster victims who did not die in the water can preserve a line of life. I am eager to await orders.</p>
<p>▲ Baoying</p>
<p>(1) Rescue Team: This team hired relief friends to set off in different ways, rescue the disaster victims and went ashore. There have been seven times. The first time was by Zhu Zhongxiang, Zhang Cixu, Shi Yangli, and other gentlemen, each leading ships to Jushi Fan's house, Dongxi Louzitou, Bantudi, Wangjia Village, Xujiawei, Xiaoxingoukou, etc. The second time was by Tian Youzhi, Wu Chunqing, and other gentlemen, leading ships to the Shanbaodi area. The third time was by Fan Dihou, Cheng Aiquan, Lu Qibo, Guo Guizhi, Jia Zuoxian, and other gentlemen, each leading ships to the area along Taipingdi to Shanbaodi. The fourth time was by Tong Yishan, Hu Yangwu, Zhu Xue, and other gentlemen, each leading ships to Minbian Bridge, Sanligou, Kawan, Qiligou, Zhujia Grave, Shanbaodi, Tongledi, Bantudi, Daxiaolujia Village, Lijia Village, Linjia Village, and Hulubridge. The fifth time was by Zhu Haidong, Wang Yichang, Zou Linbo, Zhang Muxu, and other gentlemen, each leading ships to the Wangjia Village area of Shanbaodi. The sixth time was by Wang Runzhi, Zhu Liquan, and other gentlemen, each leading ships to the Dongxiang, Zhujia Village, Zhangjia Village, and other areas. The villages passed along the way were almost the same. The fields and rice paddies were completely submerged, and the houses collapsed, without a complete one. It is difficult to count the scattered farmers, and there are also many deaths. Some live in broken temples, or occupy the top of the roof. All relief friends advance bravely in the midst of狂風巨浪, rescuing disaster victims one after another. According to statistics, more than 3,000 disaster victims have been rescued. Now the seventh batch has set off in three ways. The first route, led by Wei Yuting and Cheng Aiquan, led ships to Baishenanfen, Wagou Qifen, and Jushi Tubi, etc., has not yet returned to the city. The second route, led by Sheng Yunwu and Liu Jinsheng, led ships to Yinhuang蜆松袁卡灣 and other places, and rescued dozens of disaster victims and accommodated them in the second place. The third route, led by Wang Yannong and Zou Linbo, led ships to Sheyang Caoji Tianping狮獍兰亭决溪 and other places, and did not return to the city. They also carried dry food, flour, self-ignition, and various kinds of potion, respectively, to rescue. They are still setting off one after another, and will report again.</p>
<p>(2) Accommodation Team: Before the establishment of this team at this office, they led ships to Gaoyou to rescue disaster victims. Later, the people of Gaoyou were sent to this county one after another. Because of the flood in the west and the rise in the tide, the embankments continued to collapse, and the disaster was severe. The name was changed to accommodate the disaster victims in this county. The first accommodation center was set up in the City God Temple, and the second accommodation center was set up in the Dongyue Temple. The director of supervisors and the cookery officer have been appointed to handle everything. The number of disaster victims who have been accommodated and sent away has reached more than 200. There are more than 100 disaster victims in the first accommodation center, and dozens of disaster victims in the second accommodation center, some of whom are old and weak, or extremely bitter.</p>
<p>(3) Current water situation: The county suffered a severe flood. The west embankment has been submerged for a long time, and the rivers and lakes are connected. Since the collapse of the dam water and the Gaoyou Shao dike, the embankments on the east bank have continued to collapse, the fields have been washed away, and the houses have collapsed. The water depth outside the front door is two or three feet, and boats can pass. The northeast gate surrounds the city, and the ocean is endless. Flood control dams are built outside the city, so the water in the city cannot be discharged. The city river occasionally overflows the shore, and residents and pedestrians feel inconvenient.</p>
<p>▲ Xinghua</p>
<p>Li Rongzhuang from the Xinghua Rescue Team reported: On the 29th of last month, I and my brother Yang Jingshan drove the Jiang Shun and Jiang Su gasoline engines with four tugboats and arrived in Yangzhou at 12:00 midnight. When entering the city, there was no ship available. After inquiring about the water situation up and down the river, I learned that the six-gate water hand gasoline engine could travel. So I hired two lead boatmen and left Yangzhou on the 30th morning. At dusk, I arrived at Fanchuan. There was no shore to moor the boat in the middle of the river. Passing through Qiaoshu, Yangjia Village, Zhenwu Temple, and other places, collapsed houses were everywhere. The low water level reached the eaves. The former streets were all connected to the big river. The broken tiles and ruins were submerged in the shocking waves. Only the branches or treetops of the trees could be seen, floating on the water. I have never seen the main stem. For example, in the old people's village of Taishu, there are still scattered fragments, and the disaster victims are gathered together, depending on each other like cattle and dogs, on a small piece of dry land. It is also miserable. Floating corpses and coffins are everywhere. If the wind and waves are strong, it is difficult to protect the safety of the people living on the embankment. On the 31st morning, I arrived at Laoge, 30 miles away from Xinghua City. I could not find this dangerous embankment. In the waves, I saw a piece of green willow and knew it was a village house. There were faint small boats. There were no houses left. Occasionally, the ones that could be seen had collapsed, or only the roof tiles remained. Arriving at the city, I saw that most of the people's houses in the southwest suburbs were facing the river. The remaining water passed through the windows and doors. The boat was docked in the river outside the South Gate. A small boat was used to cross to the city gate, and then a small boat in the city was used. Except for the county government office building in the city, which was not submerged in water, the water outside the two gates was ankle-deep. The disaster victims who had previously taken refuge in the water were submerged in the water again. Those in the city were shoulder-deep or submerged to the top of their heads, and the shallow ones were submerged to the heels. More than 30 places of the city walls collapsed. On the market, five yuan banknotes could not be exchanged for five yuan in cash. On September 1st, relief friend Mr. Song Zhifang, along with provincial committee members Zhang Baozhen and Li Yuting, scattered emergency relief in the north of the city. A locomotive dragged a Jianghua boat carrying dry food and released it. After traveling five miles to Wujindang, the wind was strong, the waves were surging, and the waves were several feet high. They called for help and floated to Yan's Village, three miles away from the city, and tied the boat to the treetops. At noon on the 2nd, the wind subsided a little before returning to the city. On the 3rd, the wind subsided, and on the 4th, it continued to be released. In this wind disaster, countless houses collapsed in the countryside and the city. All the refugees were loaded and gathered about 2,000 people. The first batch was towed by two gasoline boats and four tugboats, totaling 200 people. They left Xinghua on the morning of the 4th and picked up another 70 refugees in the Yangjia Village area. They arrived in Yangzhou in the evening and were sent to Changsheng Temple outside the Quekou City on the morning of the 5th. The roster was handled by provincial government members Li Yuting and Guo Jifen. Mr. Song Zhifang is still working in Xinghua to organize relief work. The lower river is the most bitter in Xinghua. Those who have not died are still begging for continuous relief.</p>
<p>▲ Regulations on refugee work</p>
<p>The association thought that the number of refugees in each shelter is increasing day by day. They are sitting and eating all day long and doing nothing. In the blink of an eye, the weather is getting cold and cotton clothes are urgently needed. We can't make them in time. Now we have telegraphed to each office to set up sewing work, purchase cloth and cotton nearby, and divide the refugees to sew cold clothes. This can save sewing costs and prevent the disaster victims from sitting idle.</p>
<p>▲ Telegraphing for rice clothes relief funds</p>
<p>The association received a telegram yesterday from the office in Yangzhou, saying that the number of refugees is increasing day by day, please transport hundreds of stones of rice and 3,000 bags of flour. Gaoyou asked for 150 people and 2,000 bags of flour, and 20,000 yuan. Xinghua Baoying also telegraphed to ask for additional funds and rice.</p>

In addition, the National Government Flood Relief Association can continue to allocate 300,000 yuan within days, and the Huayang Relief Association can also continue to allocate 28,000 yuan, so that the disaster areas can understand the actual situation of relief in all parties, and urged the counties to quickly fill in and report the disaster survey forms that were previously allocated.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Report on the Progress of Relief in Wuhan Received by the Jisheng Association <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association previously received a report from Zhu Jun, the director of the Wuhan Relief Office of the association in Hubei Province, summarizing the Wuhan Relief Minutes. The report was published in the previous newspaper. Now, a sequel report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Fourteen accommodation centers in Hankou are dispatching friends to take over. There are also more than 1,000 disaster victims on high ground near Guiyuan Temple in Hanyang, more than 200 disaster victims from the Wuyi Benevolent Society, and more than 900 disaster victims from Chaoyang Nunnery. The above places have been investigated by Sun Ma and two relief friends, and are preparing to make a register and distribute them. There are more than 7,000 disaster victims from door to door in Guishan, and about 3,600 disaster victims from Meizi Mountain. They should be rescued after the investigation by Cheng Xie and two relief friends.</p>
<p>(2) In the 18 villages in Guanli Tunli, there are about 600 disaster households and more than 3,200 disaster victims. In the more than 70 villages in Leili, about half of the houses were submerged and collapsed, with about 400 households and more than 4,000 disaster victims. They have been registered by household to distribute relief tickets and Jiang grain. After the collapse of the Wuqing, Wuhui, and Wufeng three sluices, the disaster victims were even more miserable. Because the area is remote, separated by岡水, and transportation is inconvenient, friends are now dispatched to investigate and find ways to remedy the situation. There are more than 10,000 disaster victims near Changchun Temple in Wuchang, and many people are sick. The association subsidizes relief funds, with Chinese medicine as the main body, and provides diagnosis for people. The temple will still be used as a business location for this time. After the flooding in Caidian, the disaster was severe. Now we plan to urgently save it, allocate relief noodles, and hand it over to the county chamber of commerce for collection and distribution. If it is not enough, we will subsidize it again. In addition, because the floating corpses are rotten, it is urgent to bury and prevent epidemics. We plan to purchase 1,000 coffins to remove the accumulation and protect people's livelihood.</p>
<p>(3) On September 1st, relief friends were sent to Wuchang to distribute relief tickets. Food will be given according to the tickets tomorrow. After the relief ticket procedures in Hanyang are completed, we will go to the relief immediately.</p>
<p>(4) Guanli Tun, near the South Lake Bank of Wuchang, has investigated and released 386 households, with a total of 1,850 disaster victims of all sizes. Each big mouth will distribute 5 catties of relief noodles, and a small mouth will distribute 3 catties, which is enough for five days of food. We will continue to distribute them later. Nine out of ten houses in the whole village of Wufengzha have collapsed. Now we select the most bitter disaster victims, and first distribute 1,000 catties of steamed buns. We will investigate the disaster households in need and then distribute relief noodles. After checking the households in Wuhui and Wuqing, we will release the relief.</p>
<p>(5) 67 households in the Wuyitang shelter in Hanyang, and more than 400 households in Shanlingpu, totaling 2,457 people of all sizes. On September 5th, relief tickets have been issued and noodles will be issued tomorrow. Yesterday, I went to Caidian to investigate the disaster with Cai Junfuqing and others. Such as Duoluokou, Sanyanqiao, Seduankou, Shihuidun, Hutai, Jiangjiatai, and other 30 villages, Caidian is 30 miles long, and nine out of ten houses have collapsed. There are even entire villages that have been completely destroyed. The disaster victims are sheltering on the railway embankment, or crossing the Hanyang to camp in the open on Muliang Mountain, etc. There are also many who are avoiding to the high slopes of Caiqing. The disaster area is a vast ocean, which has become a huge disaster. The disaster victims are miserable beyond words. Caidian is 60 miles away from Hanyang, and the disaster victims mostly avoid Heishan, Meizi Mountain, Guishan, and other places. The local good people are working hard to maintain it, and only one soup kitchen is set up, which is of no help. The association plans to subsidize Caidian and set up four accommodation centers. There are many people and few houses, which is not enough to accommodate them. The association plans to subsidize relief noodles to save the urgent situation. The above are the situations that the director and relief friends personally investigated and released. In addition to the relief funds, relief medicines, relief noodles, etc., they were continuously transported to the relief. Yesterday, Siming Bank donated 10,000 bags of relief flour, which has been loaded in Hankou for relief.</p>

I read the newspaper and learned that you are raising funds for flood relief, and I am very comforted. The disaster reports I have received recently are unbearable. In addition, the weather is getting colder, and I can't help but feel chills when I think of the disaster victims. The old military uniforms of the Northeast Army must have reserves. I would like to ask you to consult with my brother Hanqing and order them to be assigned. I heard that the harvest in Dong Province this year is very abundant. If you can transport the surplus grain to the south to help relief, it will be a great blessing to the disaster victims. How to deal with it, I hope to see you again. Sister Ailing.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Upstream Yangtze River Anti-Foreign Steamer Movement <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Organizing a Merchants' Shipping Joint Association</p>
<p>To serve as a backing for the recovery of navigation rights</p>
<p>For years, the Yichang-Chongqing route of the upper Yangtze River has been monopolized by foreign steamers, and Chinese merchant ships have been completely defeated. Now, various organizations in Yichang, seeing the gradual disappearance of Chinese ships and the potential unemployment of over ten thousand workers who rely on the port for their livelihoods, consider this a matter of utmost importance concerning national rights and people's livelihoods. Therefore, they have united labor and capital groups related to shipping to organize a Merchants' Shipping Joint Association, formulate plans, and actively proceed. The following is a record of their correspondence with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce:</p>
<p>▲Telegram from the Merchants' Shipping Joint Association to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Our country's shipping industry is bound by unequal treaties, having lost both exclusive benefits and the right to protection. Coastal and inland rivers are open to all, foreign ships roam freely, and inland waterways have become foreign ports. This is a rare occurrence in the international community, causing humiliation and loss of national rights like no other. As a result, our country's shipping industry suffers from the economic oppression of imperialists and the destructive force of their violence. Losses of life and property are unbearable, and even tragic incidents occur frequently, which are infuriating. Consequently, Chinese merchant ships are being boycotted by foreign imperialist steamers and are gradually disappearing. Over ten thousand workers who rely on Yichang port for their livelihoods are also facing the threat of unemployment. Although the government has repeatedly issued orders: (1) The Ministry of Industry instructs all provincial organizations to prioritize the use of domestic shipping companies for transporting domestic goods and materials. (2) The National Government instructs all administrative and educational institutions and all public organizations nationwide to use domestic shipping companies for transporting public goods and materials. (3) The Ministry of Finance instructs all customs offices to provide convenience to domestic goods transported by Chinese ships at all times and not to create difficulties. These three measures were circulated to all provinces, cities, and chambers of commerce by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Communications in March of this year. However, due to our country's habitual procrastination, government orders are often mere formalities. Unscrupulous merchants, ignorant of national shame, not only curry favor with foreigners but also obstruct matters from within. Even during this tense anti-Japanese period, they secretly purchase enemy goods and provide them to enemy ships for transportation. Speaking of this is heartbreaking. If this continues, the nation will cease to exist. Recognizing this, the members of this association, bearing the responsibility of every citizen, aim to support Chinese ships and maintain labor livelihoods. Therefore, in accordance with Article 39 of the Provisional Constitution, we have united labor and capital groups related to shipping in Yichang to form this association. We have submitted it to the Party, military, and political authorities for record-keeping. Following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, complying with government orders, and under the guidance of the Party headquarters, we are formulating plans to adapt to the times, take legal steps, achieve the goal of maintenance, implement our proposals, and strive hard. We are encouraging and formulating plans to adapt to the times, taking legal steps to fully load Chinese ships in order to regain rights and serve as a backing for the government to recover navigation rights, thereby maintaining the livelihoods of laborers. Work began on September 4th. However, at the beginning of this venture, we are facing many challenges. The members of this association have limited strength but heavy responsibilities, and we fear failure. We hope that all of you will show your patriotic enthusiasm and provide assistance to facilitate our progress. This urgent telegram is respectfully submitted for your consideration. Merchants' Shipping Joint Association, Yichang, respectfully. Jiang.</p>
<p>▲Reply telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to the Merchants' Shipping Joint Association in Yichang: Your telegram of the Jiang matter has been received. We are aware that the Yichang-Chongqing shipping route has been monopolized by foreign merchants for years, and the entire business community feels a sense of regret and despair. We are pleased to hear that your association has united to support Chinese ships, which provides an opportunity for Chinese ships to recover. We are delighted to hear this news. However, how can we resist the temptation of foreign ships' price-cutting competition? If Chinese ships are insufficient to load all goods, how can we properly allocate them? We rely on your insightful planning and are confident that you have good strategies. We hope you will provide detailed methods so that the whole country can follow suit. This is what we truly hope for. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Zhen, Seal.</p>

<h3 id="e162">British Public Bus Strike, Chinese Directors' Mediation Fails <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Workers' Congress Elects 15 Representatives</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Mediation for Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>After the British Public Bus workers resumed their strike, all workers went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for reinstatement. It is reported that the Bureau has scheduled to send representatives to the company for negotiations today and tomorrow to conduct mediation. The Municipal Government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to handle the matter. Some Chinese directors of the Municipal Council have attempted to mediate but were unsuccessful. The company's attitude is firm, and a resolution is difficult to reach at the moment. Yesterday, the company勉强 continued to operate lines 1, 2, 5, 9, and 10. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲After the internal division of the Chinese directors' strike mediation committee, all workers pleaded with the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council to uphold justice and mediate for the reinstatement of all striking workers to avoid unemployment. A few days ago, someone from the Chinese directors' side went to the Sassoon House China British Public Bus Company to negotiate with the director, Sanli Ke. The director insisted on upholding the company's board resolution, refusing reinstatement, and stated that the striking workers had been completely dismissed, making mediation impossible.</p>
<p>▲Petition to the Municipal Government All striking workers of the Public Bus, uniformly dressed in their uniforms, went to the Shanghai Municipal Government at Fenglin Bridge to petition, requesting the company to reinstate all workers. Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government instructed to select representatives for discussion. Qin Xinyao and ten others were selected. Secretary-General Yu promised to instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate as soon as possible and ordered them to strictly maintain order and wait patiently for a resolution.</p>
<p>▲Workers' General Meeting Due to the ineffectiveness of some members of the strike committee, resulting in the prolongation of the strike, all striking workers held a general meeting near the Grand Self-Ringing Bell in West Shanghai, with over two hundred people attending. The chairman first reported on the strike process, followed by a discussion of the way forward. It was decided to elect Qin Xinyao, Wu Weixin, Hong Mingdao, Xu Hongfei, and fifteen others as responsible representatives.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Developing Industry and Commerce and Labor-Capital Coordination <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yansong's Speech Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Third District Party Headquarters of this city invited Mr. Wang Yansong, Supervisory Committee Member of the City Party Headquarters and Standing Committee Member of the City Chamber of Commerce, to give a speech on Party principles at the wireless broadcasting station of the Da Zhonghua Electric Company on Nanjing Road. Mr. Wang's topic was "Developing Industry and Commerce and Labor-Capital Coordination." His speech was as follows: Today, I am honored to be invited by the Third District Party Headquarters of this city to come here and, in front of the self-installed wireless broadcasting station of the Da Zhonghua Electric Company, have an indirect conversation with the elders, brothers, sisters, and daughters of the entire city. What is called an indirect conversation? Because you can only hear the voice but cannot see the face, which is different from ordinary direct lectures. However, I feel that even in a great citizens' assembly, the audience has never been as large as it is today. Therefore, although I have not met you today, I am very happy and excited. The topic I want to talk about today is (Developing Industry and Commerce and Labor-Capital Coordination), because this issue is very important. It not only concerns industry and commerce themselves, but also has a close relationship with the survival of the entire nation. Therefore, I specifically raise it for everyone to discuss. Now, when it comes to this topic of (Developing Industry and Commerce and Labor-Capital Coordination), we should divide it into two parts. One part is (Developing Industry and Commerce), and the other part is (Labor-Capital Coordination). But why put these two parts together? Because one is the (cause) and the other is the (effect). In other words, (Labor-Capital Coordination) is the (cause), and (Developing Industry and Commerce) is the (effect). If we cannot first solve the problem of Labor-Capital Coordination and try to force the development of industry and commerce, then it is like climbing a tree to catch fish, which is absolutely impossible. Now, China is facing internal and external troubles, natural disasters, and man-made disasters, which are intertwined and make us feel overwhelmed. As for the domestic industry and commerce, there is really no vitality to speak of, and labor and capital still cannot understand and cooperate with each other. Everyone sees that there is no day in the newspaper without incidents of labor-capital disputes, and there is no day without strikes and shutdowns. But every unfortunate labor-capital dispute that occurs always results in both sides being hurt, and neither side can benefit. If this social disease is not treated immediately, then not only will industry and commerce have no hope of development, but even the existing industry and commerce will be swept away. Not only will the economic aggression of the great powers not be resisted, but their power will become more intense day by day. Therefore, I dare to boldly and definitively say that if China's industry and commerce continue to have labor-capital disputes, it is tantamount to self-destruction and self-seeking death. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that capitalists should improve the lives of workers and increase their productivity. With high productivity, workers can produce more for capitalists. On the capitalist side, they can produce more, and on the worker side, they can earn more wages. This is the harmonization of the interests of capitalists and workers, not a conflict. The reason why society evolves is because the majority of economic interests in society are harmonized, not because the majority of economic interests in society are in conflict. The harmonization of the majority of economic interests in society is to seek the interests of the majority. Only when the majority benefits can society progress. Hasn't Dr. Sun Yat-sen already indicated the great way for labor and capital to coordinate and how to coordinate? But Dr. Sun Yat-sen continued to say, (China does not have capitalists, only the distinction between large and small poverty. The labor and capital sides in China should strive under the same goal to deal with the imperialism of the great powers.) From this, we can know that the labor-capital disputes that are prevalent in society today should not have occurred. To put it bluntly, we are not even qualified to have labor-capital disputes. When I speak here, I cannot help but advise both labor and capital. Those who are in the position of labor should never simply demand increased wages, reduced working hours, and improved treatment. They should realize the reality of the decline of domestic industry and commerce, cooperate sincerely with capital, and strive together for development. They should be of one heart and one mind to resist the economic aggression of the great powers. If they force the capital side to agree to very harsh conditions, and the capital side barely agrees, if they cannot maintain their business, then there is only one way to go bankrupt. After bankruptcy, what will many workers live on? It is said that a few years ago, the workers in the silk factories and weaving factories in Hangzhou, because they demanded increased wages and reduced hours, made it impossible for the factories to maintain themselves, and dozens of factories closed down one after another. Later, many workers had nowhere to make a living and could only degrade themselves to various kinds of coolies, which was several times worse than the original wages and living conditions in the factory. Isn't this self-inflicted? Therefore, the ancients have a saying, (When the skin is gone, what will the fur be attached to?) My dear workers, you must carefully consider this saying. Furthermore, those who are in the position of capital should also be considerate of the workers. The lives of workers are mostly very difficult. The capital side should at all times try to improve the lives of the workers and never adopt oppressive measures or have the idea of exploitation. All benefits should be enjoyed openly. If we can treat the workers with such sincerity, then there is no place where labor and capital cannot cooperate. In short, capital cannot exist without labor, and labor cannot exist without capital. The two are interdependent. If the labor and capital sides in our country can accept my advice now and work together to develop their own industry and commerce, then not only will the existing industry and commerce be thriving, but new industries will surely erupt like spring bamboo shoots. At that time, the future of China's industry and commerce will be bright, and how difficult will it be to resist the economic aggression of the great powers from thousands of miles away? That's all.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Fisheries Bureau of the Ministry of Industry's Jiangsu-Zhejiang District in May of this year, Director Han Yougang has been keen on rectifying matters related to ocean protection, frequently personally leading his affiliated ships on patrols. Therefore, the bandit atmosphere along the coast has recently been slightly suppressed compared to before. However, the original firearms of the bureau's ships are insufficient for use, and repeated telegrams have been sent to the Ministry of Industry requesting replenishment. It is reported that yesterday, water machine guns, rifles, wooden-cased guns, and bullets were received in large numbers and will be distributed to the patrol ships for use immediately. It is also reported that steel cannons and handguns will also be received one after another soon. From now on, the fishermen of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, who have long suffered from banditry, will be protected.</p>

<p>Proclamation by the Two Roads Bureau Directors</p>
<p>Guo Chengen, Director of the Two Roads Bureau, issued a proclamation yesterday stating: For the matter of proclamation, it has been found that there are already regulations for renting land along this road. Any use of road land without a signed lease is considered a violation and encroachment, which cannot be tolerated. Furthermore, failure to pay rent on time after signing a lease, resulting in long-term accumulation, is also a violation of the regulations, causing inconvenience. Therefore, this notice is issued. From now on, whether they are workers on this road or local farmers, if they rent land along this road, they must strictly abide by the regulations, sign a lease, and pay rent on time. Those who refuse to comply and delay payment will have their rented land taken back by this bureau for the sake of maintaining property rights and public funds and will be rented out again. At the same time, they will be sent to the county for legal action to serve as a warning to others. Do not say that you were not warned. This proclamation is crucial.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Foreman Kidnapped <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Walking Down from Teahouse, Kidnapped by Bandits</p>
<p>Bandits Take Shen's Bookkeeper</p>
<p>Six People Driven Off Mid-Route, Bandits Escape</p>
<p>Threatening Letters Received Three Years Ago</p>
<p>Shen Shengda, a native of Pudong, is a pile-driving foreman for Shen Shengji, specializing in this industry for many years. Many major buildings in Shanghai have had their foundations driven by him. He lives at No. 140, New Kangli, Yangshupu Road, and owns a car for transportation, with license plate numbers 4741 in the concession and 1886 in the municipal government. Yesterday, around 6:00 PM, he and his son Shen Wenxin and four bookkeepers went to the Yiletian Teahouse on Hubei Road, driven by chauffeur Wu Linsheng. Upon arrival, Wu parked the car in front of the Xiqing Pool on Jiujiang Road, facing east. Shen and the others went upstairs to Yiletian for tea. Around 7:15 PM, Shen Shengda and the six others finished and went back downstairs, returning to the car. Just as the engine started, four bandits suddenly blocked the car. One, dressed in gray, occupied the driver's seat. Another, dressed in blue, held a box cannon, forbidding anyone in the car from making a sound, saying they were just borrowing the car to rob earth and had no other intention. The other two, dressed in black long gowns and armed with weapons, sat on top of Shen and the others, pinning them down. Then, the bandit driving stepped on the gas and drove straight ahead, south on Fujian Road, west on Avenue Edward VII, south on Danshui Road, to Avenue Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession, where the car stopped. The bandits first pushed one of the four bookkeepers, surnamed Zhang, off the car, then kept watch over the hostage Shen Shengda, drove off the remaining people, and sped away towards Avenue Dubail, quickly disappearing from sight. Shen's son Wenxin and the others rushed to report to the French Concession police and notified the Shanghai Municipal Police, ordering all police stations to be on alert. However, as of late at night, there were still no leads. Shen Shengda is forty-eight years old and has three sons, Wenxin being the eldest. The car is a Buick, purchased some years ago. The chauffeur was originally Pan Gengsheng, but he recently took sick leave and was temporarily replaced by Wu Linsheng for only about ten days. Three years ago, Shen had contracted to drive piles for the Customs House on the Bund of Hankou Road. At that time, someone coveted his wealth and sent a threatening letter demanding 50,000 yuan. After reporting to the police, four suspects were apprehended and convicted by the court.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Hou Guangdi and Wife's Second Divorce Lawsuit <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Hou Himself Files for Divorce</p>
<p>His Wife Requests Cohabitation and Support</p>
<p>Hou Guangdi, a Western doctor, was involved in a divorce lawsuit with his wife Hou Wu Hailun last year. The matter was resolved through reconciliation, and they remained on good terms. Now, just a year later, Hou has filed for a second divorce. Wu, upon learning of this, has also retained lawyer Hong Shihao to sue Hou in the First Special District Court for coercing her into signing documents and for abandonment and failure to provide support, requesting a ruling for cohabitation and support, and revocation of the illegal documents, among other things. The original pleadings, once filled with tender emotions, are now recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"I, the petitioner, worked as a teacher in Qingpu, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. On February 10th of the Republican year ten, I was engaged to Mr. Cai. However, before the marriage could take place, Mr. Cai passed away prematurely. At that time, the defendant was friendly with Mr. Cai, and seeing that I was young, he took the opportunity to use his seductive tricks, making countless vows and pledges. I initially paid no attention, but seeing his sincere attitude and extremely enthusiastic performance, I could not remain unmoved, especially as I was newly widowed and felt lost in the vast world. Moreover, I was convinced that he had ended his relationship with Miss Weng, his previous lover, and I was thus bewitched and associated with him, eventually becoming husband and wife. In the eleventh year, in September, I became pregnant and gave birth to our eldest daughter, Xi Rui. Over the past ten years, I have given birth to one son and two daughters. I married the defendant hoping to grow old together, and I always submitted and complied with his wishes. However, the defendant's love for me changed with the waxing and waning of my beauty. Having managed the household for years and undergone several childbirths, my beauty was naturally no longer comparable to when I first married. The defendant, growing tired of me, resumed his old habits of seeking pleasure, using the same tricks he had used to seduce me on others. Within months, he openly kept a mistress in a golden house at No. 277 Yanqingli, Xiamen Road. When I intervened slightly, he became enraged and his mask was torn off. He fabricated stories and filed for divorce in your honorable court. At that time, I had just given birth and was devastated by the sudden blow. The defendant, with a heart of a serpent, took advantage of my vulnerable state to coerce me into signing documents, threatening to harm me if I did not comply. Under such oppressive force, I had no choice but to obey his wishes, hoping that he would change his mind, considering our nine years of marriage. To this day, I am still unaware of the contents of the documents. Afterwards, we resumed our lives without incident, and he, knowing that his divorce lawsuit was untenable, withdrew it (Year 19, Personal Character No. 52). This spring, the defendant's lust knew no bounds, and he had an affair with our female servant. Considering the matter too outrageous and easily laughed at, I dismissed her. The defendant, unwilling to part with his new favorite, harbored malicious intentions and again forced me to sign a document, forcing me to live separately. As a woman, I was powerless to resist and had no choice but to leave in distress with my three children. It has been many days since then, and not only has he failed to provide support, he has treated me as a stranger. Just as I was about to file a lawsuit, the defendant preemptively filed a lawsuit, claiming I owed him money, hoping to easily erase our marital relationship. His actions are truly outrageous. When the defendant was destitute, I, compelled by marital duty, generously provided assistance. Now that I am older and my beauty has faded, he has become so heartless and extreme. This is intolerable in both emotion and law. Therefore, I recount the events and implore for relief, requesting that the defendant's lawsuit be rejected, that he be ordered to fulfill his obligation of cohabitation and support, and that the illegally written documents be revoked. If evidence of bigamy is discovered, I request that it be reported together to uphold ethics and maintain social order. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<p>Twenty-Eight Stores Guarantee Two Painters</p>
<p>The case of Ling Xiangxiang, a sedan carrier for famous doctor Xia Yingtang, who was hacked to death and his body burned to cover up the crime, was solved by the First Branch of the Second District. The suspect, Gao Asan, confessed to the involvement of painters Zhang Yongquan and Ye Xufu, who were arrested and presented to the Public Security Bureau. The Judicial Science Department interrogated them, and Gao Asan maintained his previous confession. However, Zhang Yongquan and Ye Xufu claimed that they were asleep on the night of the incident and did not go out. Zhang Yongquan claimed to be staying at the Ruixing Store, and Ye Xufu claimed to be staying at the Yuanshunxing Store, and that they did not leave after 10:00 PM that night, which could be verified. At the same time, twenty-eight stores, including Jinruixing, Yishunxing, Dexingxiang, Hanyongxing, Zheng Xiangji, La Dachang, and Huyuanxing on Fangbang Road, submitted a joint guarantee, proving that they did not go out and still went to the Xia family to work the next day, and there was no false information, and they could not enter the Xia family's gate at night. After reviewing the documents, the Judicial Science Department decided to submit the case to the court for verification and investigation by the District Court, pending a ruling.</p>

<p>Cao Ayuan, a resident of Caojiazhai near the Baoshan Fort north of Wusong, over fifty years old, who worked as a vegetable farmer, suddenly left home one week and did not return by nightfall. His family searched everywhere without success. Initially, they suspected that he had gone to visit relatives in Liuhang, so they did not pay much attention and waited for his return. The day before yesterday morning, a resident of the same village, Mr. Cao, was searching in a nearby vegetable field and found a corpse. The head was buried in the mud. Examining the clothes, he recognized it as Cao Ayuan, who had been missing for seven days. He immediately ran to inform his family, who came to identify the body without error. The body was then collected, but it was already badly decomposed. It is said that the deceased had no previous illness, and this time it may have been a sudden death due to an acute illness.</p>

<p>The woman Xue Shen Shi, hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, stating that her husband, Xue Huicheng, had jointly opened a medicinal materials business with Yan Ruishun when he was alive. Her husband had several thousand taels of cash that he had lent to Yan Ruishun, and several thousand pounds of medicinal bark stored in the business. Unfortunately, after her husband died of illness last year, all the goods and loans were embezzled by the defendant alone. All attempts to reason with him had failed. She relies entirely on this money to live, so how can she allow him to appropriate it? Therefore, she is unwilling to accept this and has filed a lawsuit requesting an investigation. Yan Ruishun claimed that all the goods in the business were recorded in the account books and that he would not dare to embezzle them. He requested a clear investigation. The judge instructed both parties to retain their positions and await further review at a later date.</p>

<p>Trial to be Held this Afternoon</p>
<p>Fan Qu Shi, a woman residing at No. 35 Zhen'anli, Guangzhao Road, Zhabei, and her younger sister-in-law Fan Xiaozhong, recently retained lawyer Shen Yong to file a lawsuit in the First District Court against Fan Lantian, residing at the Liangchen Haoyou Society on Beijing Road, for the crimes of bigamy and abandonment. The lawsuit stated that Fan Qu Shi is the defendant's legal wife, married to him in the eighth year of the Republic through matchmakers Lin Laiquan and Li Fukui. Although they were not very harmonious at first, they were still compatible. In the thirteenth year of the Republic, the defendant had an affair with a woman surnamed Zhang, and secretly married her in a hotel in Shanghai in April of the fourteenth year of the Republic. They have now had two sons and a daughter. Starting in October of that year, claiming that she could not bear children, he took the Zhang woman as a concubine and brought her to their old house in Pudong, forcing her to live with her and forcing her to give up the main room to live in a side room with her younger sister Xiaozhong. If she refused, he threatened to cut off her food and clothing and ordered her uncle Fan Xinfu to divorce her. Because she refused, the abuse increased. Initially, he gave her seven yuan per month for food and clothing, but later he made her share the seven yuan with her younger sister Xiaozhong, while he and his new wife lived in luxury, feasting and wearing fine clothes. She spent her days hungry and her years without fresh clothes, treated like a slave. In September of the sixteenth year of the Republic, her younger sister Xiaozhong, also unable to bear the lack of food and clothing, left to work as a laborer. Considering that in the winter of the fourteenth year of the Republic, her younger sister Xiaozhong was already twenty years old and there had been marriage proposals, the defendant declared that if Xiaozhong married, the monthly seven yuan would be stopped. Although she had asked people to intercede, the defendant said that the monthly seven yuan was for his sister, not for her. Xiaozhong thought that if she married, her sister-in-law would have no food or clothing, so it was better to live because of her than to die for her, so she refused to marry and shared the hardships with her sister-in-law. Therefore, in September of the sixteenth year of the Republic, she bid farewell to everyone in the house and went to Shanghai with her sister-in-law to work and support themselves. The defendant was happy with their departure and wanted to stop paying the monthly seven yuan. After the relatives protested against his actions, he gave them two rooms that collected eight yuan in rent each month in Shanghai Zhabei. However, the rent collection fee required one or two yuan per month, making it difficult to collect the rent and barely enough to support their food and clothing, which forced them to find a way to support themselves. After arriving in Shanghai, the defendant treated them as if they were strangers, not treating his younger sister as a sister and not fulfilling his obligation to find her a husband, and not treating his wife as a wife and showing no kindness. Forced into this situation, they could only rely on the monthly rent of eight yuan as a basis and supplement it with their labor income. However, they came from a well-off family and were not used to working and living, and their situation was extremely difficult. She had begged her husband's brothers for assistance, but they did not even give her a glance. Now, the Zhabei tenant has stopped paying the rent, making it difficult for them to support themselves and wanting to leave them to die. The court, based on the lawsuit, has scheduled a trial for this afternoon (the 14th) in the second criminal court by Judge Feng.</p>

<p>I have an unexpected matter to report to you, and I ask you to resolve it for me. I am a woman who grew up in Shanghai and received a secondary education. However, my fiancé is an uneducated country bumpkin who cannot support himself. Six years ago, my father's business failed. My fiancé's father not only voluntarily waived all of his creditor's rights but also provided a large sum of money for my father to start his business again, stating that it was in consideration of the engagement agreement. My father, of course, could not object. At that time, I was only fifteen years old and did not fully understand the world. Although I was somewhat dissatisfied, I did not express it formally. Now I am older, and the old saying "when a boy grows up, he should marry; when a girl grows up, she should be married" is about to become a reality through a series of rituals. I, the unfortunate sacrifice, am absolutely against it. My mother often tempts me with tales of his family's thousands of acres of land and numerous houses, saying that even if he does not work, we will not starve. My father, looking pitiful, says with tears in his eyes, "If I don't repay the debt, my conscience will be troubled. If I don't do this, I will have to experience the flavor of an iron window." My brother, on the other hand, is absolutely against it. He says that debts should be repaid with money, and I should not be used as collateral. Alas, kind sir, my wedding date is in December this winter. The short time of three months feels like a flash of lightning. From then on, I will not only have no happy days, but my life's happiness will be eliminated invisibly. Great editor, you will solve this problem because you are the messenger of happiness for people. There may be more than one woman in the world like me. Please save me and help me! I hope to receive a response in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) Let me first tell you the law. Article 975 of the Civil Code states that "an engagement cannot be forcibly enforced." If you do not want to, no one can force you. Moreover, Article 972 of the Civil Code states that "an engagement should be entered into voluntarily by the parties concerned." If you have not yet formally expressed your intention, this problem may still be resolved. However, you must find a way to make your father understand your difficulties. Most importantly, you must not be pessimistic. Your thoughts are of the highest and purest kind. You should use the utmost sincerity, courage, and determination to explain the advantages, disadvantages, blessings, and misfortunes of the future to your father with a thousand points of earnestness and a thousand points of clarity and firmness, repeatedly. There are no parents in the world who do not love their children. According to the law, the final decision rests with you. There is no need to be pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e194">News from Mr. Zeng Gui <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Being dominated by the family's economic situation has deprived me of the opportunity to further my education. Recalling the past, when I was in elementary school, I didn't pay attention to any of my subjects and found them boring. However, after entering middle school, two things prompted me to study hard. The first was the extreme shortage of family finances, and the second was the deep understanding that my studies were temporary and for technical needs. After fighting for a year, my interest in studying was aroused, and I became very interested in all kinds of books. Now it's time for me to graduate. Here, I want to ask, should I get a job or further my education? However, if I get a job, not only will my distant ambitions become a bubble, but it will also be difficult to find a job. Conversely, the tuition for further education is nowhere to be found, making it even harder for the family to support itself. In this situation, please help me resolve it.</p>
<p>(Reply) The statement that "distant ambitions become a bubble after getting a job" is wrong. The noblest thing in life is "earning one's own living." That is why it is called "the sacredness of occupation." Even if you graduate from university, you still have to get a job. Moreover, getting a job does not necessarily hinder further education. Not to mention that you can attend supplementary schools in your spare time while working, but even if you work for a year or two and then go back to school, you will benefit from both economically and practically. As the saying goes, "Those who excel in officialdom then learn," which is the same principle.</p>
<p>Since the tuition for further education cannot be found, employment is naturally the first priority. Finding a job is certainly not easy, but even university graduates have to go through this difficulty. Why not ask relatives and friends for help now and try to find a way?</p>
<p>Actually, you have already gone down the wrong path. If you cannot afford to go to university, you should have entered a vocational school when you entered high school. If you cannot afford to go to high school, you should have entered a vocational school when you entered junior high school. Unfortunately, there are too many people in society who go down the wrong path. After graduating from an ordinary junior high school or an ordinary high school, it is naturally very difficult to find a job because you have no skills.</p>

During this year's summer vacation, he asked a friend to introduce him to Mr. Wang Xishen, the principal of the Zhengfeng College of Literature, and he was granted permission to enroll in the school. However, his family forbade him from doing so. Since this disappointment, Changyu has been discouraged in everything. Now, after his family's consideration, they have advised him to study medicine (traditional Chinese medicine) or commerce. However, neither is close to his interests, and hope of studying has faded. Medicine and commerce are bound to neglect one or the other, making it a dilemma. Changyu is temporarily unclear about which path to take and has sent this letter specifically, hoping for a quick reply.</p>
<p>(Reply) Young people should choose a career or a major based on the following four criteria: (1) what is closest to their nature, (2) what they have a special talent for, (3) what the family has a particularly suitable environment for, and (4) what society needs. Young people should carefully examine and choose, obtain the consent of their parents, and then decide. Generally speaking, after the age of fifteen or sixteen, you should feel this yourself. You are already twenty-three years old and should have the ability to choose for yourself. Studying medicine and studying commerce are very different. Which one to choose, you should examine yourself according to the above four criteria and explain it to your family very sincerely. If you speak reasonably, kind parents will not refuse to follow. However, whether entering the College of Literature can be relied upon as a career in the future is also a question you should consider. Our position can only put forward some principles to remind you and cannot solve it for you specifically. You must forgive us.</p>

<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastal areas will be cloudy and rainy and cool. The wind in the Yellow Sea will be gentle and without direction. There will be an east wind in the East China Sea.

<p>Letters Received</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read an article in your newspaper's news column about a car crashing into a rickshaw on Zhongxing Road. It stated that "a China Merchant Public Bus Company bus with license plate number 4543 in the Chinese Concession and 17905 in the International Settlement was taking passengers to Zhenru when it crashed into rickshaw number 1922 at the southern entrance of Fan Li Kou on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei." I was very surprised. Our company's public buses only operate in the Chinese Concession and do not have license plates in the International Settlement. Moreover, the route does not pass through Zhongxing Road, nor do we take passengers like "chicken buses." The report seems to be very inaccurate. Because this concerns our company's reputation, we are writing to you specifically, requesting that you correct the report immediately to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e198">Mr. Banana Leaf Fan <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Banana Leaf Fan is named after fanning a banana leaf fan. Many people fan banana leaf fans. Who among the farmers cooling off shirtless in front of thatched huts doesn't fan a banana leaf fan? Why is it that only Mr. Banana Leaf Fan has a name and no one else? This is not accidental. Everyone else fans round fans and folding fans, but Mr. Banana Leaf Fan exclusively fans a banana leaf fan. People see Mr. Banana Leaf Fan and immediately see a banana leaf fan, and seeing a banana leaf fan immediately brings Mr. Banana Leaf Fan to mind. Involuntarily, they associate Mr. Banana Leaf Fan with the banana leaf fan. Over time, even Mr. Banana Leaf Fan's name is forgotten, but the banana leaf fan is not forgotten. Thinking of Mr. Banana Leaf Fan brings the banana leaf fan to mind, and thinking of the banana leaf fan brings Mr. Banana Leaf Fan to mind. Inevitably, naturally, everyone calls Mr. Banana Leaf Fan by this name. The reason why Mr. Banana Leaf Fan fans a banana leaf fan among a crowd of round fans is not to deliberately be different, but because the banana leaf fan has great uses and he doesn't want to see it buried. Someone may ask Mr. Banana Leaf Fan about the banana leaf fan, and Mr. Banana Leaf Fan will reply: "When I run on the road under the scorching sun, I don't need to wear a hat; when I encounter rain along the way, I don't need to open an umbrella; when I am tired, I can sit down anywhere and have a ready-made cushion; when it gets cool in the middle of the night, it is lighter and more convenient than a blanket when covering my stomach; when it is unbearably hot, one person can fan the fan and everyone can share the cool breeze: all of this depends on this banana leaf fan." Mr. Banana Leaf Fan has a friend who teaches children in the countryside. He usually doesn't like to meddle in other people's business, but when a country bumpkin is bullied, he asks his friend for advice, and his friend will do his best to come up with a plan for them. His friend often walks in the mountains and forests while waving a banana leaf fan. Therefore, the villagers often call him Banana Leaf Kongming to distinguish him from Kongming, who fans a goose feather fan. Banana Leaf Kongming was eventually imprisoned for repeatedly fighting for justice and offending the powerful. The prison guard asked for money. Having nothing left, he reluctantly gave the prison guard his banana leaf fan. This banana leaf fan was particularly large. Mr. Banana Leaf Fan passed by the prison guard's house and saw the prison guard fanning himself with the fan. Recognizing the fan as his friend's, he bought it from the prison guard at several times the price. The banana leaf fan that Mr. Banana Leaf Fan is now carrying around in the bustling city is this one.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Anecdotes of Famous Novelist Xu Fumin <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>I, a person from Foshan, and Nan Tingtingchang are both seniors in the world of storytelling. At the same time, there was also Mr. Xu Fumin of Qiantang, who enjoyed considerable fame for his book "Records of Officialdom." My lodging place here has a family friendship with Mr. Xu. Yesterday, while examining old bookshelves, I found a landscape fan painted by Mr. Xu, so I am recounting his anecdotes, which are also rare stories in the world of storytelling. Mr. Xu was tall and handsome, and he frequented brothels and gambling dens, occasionally indulging in his leisure pursuits. He had a boisterous spirit and excelled at eloquence, which flowed like a river bursting its banks. He traveled as a staff member to Jiangxi and later obtained an official position in Hubei Province's salt administration through grain donation. Because of his dissolute lifestyle, he inevitably tarnished his official reputation. At that time, the Manchu official Rui Zheng held a high position and wielded great power. Mr. Xu offended him. Rui Zheng sent out his secret police to arrest him and fabricate crimes against him. Mr. Xu learned of this early and hid in a certain prefect's office. The prefect was an old friend of Mr. Xu. Rui Zheng sent soldiers to search for him, and he was only able to avoid arrest by hiding in a secret room. Before long, he secretly fled to Shanghai and wrote "Records of Officialdom" to expose Rui Zheng's secrets. The book was thorough and welcomed by readers. When the Yellow Turban Army raised the flag of rebellion in Huangpi, Hubei Province was restored. Rui Zheng fled. Mr. Xu, together with the actor Pan Yueqiao and others, arranged a new play called "Yellow Crane Tower," which also depicted Rui Zheng's scandalous history. "Yellow Crane Tower" sold out every show. They then arranged another play called "Black List Wrongs," so that those who were sunk in the black list would be startled when they saw it. It had the same purpose as Wu Jianren's "Sea of Regret." Mr. Xu also organized the "Monthly Novel" magazine with Shen Jixuan, which was published monthly and was the oldest novel magazine. Famous writers such as I, a person from Foshan, Zhou Guisheng, Tianxiaosheng, Tianxu Wosheng, Sick Man of East Asia, and Tian Lusheng all contributed articles. It was discontinued after several dozen issues. Mr. Xu's name was Zhi, and his pseudonym was Fumin. He was skilled in calligraphy and painting landscapes. He was truly a man of many talents. He died of illness in a certain year of the Republic of China, and those who heard of it regretted it.</p>
<h3 id="e200">A Quick Sketch of the Improved Clothing Exhibition <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Six groups, including the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Home Daily Renewal Society, the Sanyou Industrial Society, the Chinese Women's Temperance Society, the Women's Department of the Puyi Society, and the Joint Association of Women's Vocational Schools, launched an improved clothing exhibition because clothing is related to the civilization of the nation and the rise and fall of the country. The opening ceremony was held yesterday morning at Yipinxiang. Many people from all walks of life attended. In addition to the public exhibition, there were also performances, which generated many interesting stories. Here are a few excerpts to share with readers.</p>
<p>The auditorium was in Yipinxiang's new hall. There were two male and two female greeters at the entrance, all wearing clothing made of 212 Free Cloth produced by the Sanyou Industrial Society. On the walkway, men's, women's, and children's clothing were placed on wooden racks and planted on both sides, totaling dozens of pieces, arranged in a single row, like subordinates standing in attendance when seeing their superiors in the officialdom of the former Qing Dynasty, which was quite amusing. On the left was the inscription area. Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan and his wife led their two children to the meeting. The administrator immediately handed them paper and pens and asked them to inscribe. Mr. Pan thought it over again and again and wrote "Hard work, improved clothing, promote domestic goods, exceptionally beautiful." On the right was the children's rest area. In addition to the sign "Please supervise and manage the teachers and guardians of each school," there were also three maids who specialized in taking care of the children's urination and defecation. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, 21 female employees of the Sanyou Society took the stage and sang the improved clothing song. The song said, "Improve, improve. The most important thing for China right now is clothing. Everyone loves the country. Use domestic goods. Wearing it gives you a dignified attitude. The first step in revolutionary work is to improve your appearance. Equality cloth, free dress, simple, elegant, brave, comfortable, and convenient, lively, and generous." Then, the little brothers and little sisters, all wearing clothes made by the Sanyou Society, totaling more than 300 people, paraded around the venue for a week. They were innocent, lively, and lovely. The clothing styles were different, and the colors were also different. Looking at it from a distance, it was like a group of butterflies flying in the air. When Yang Weiyu introduced the famous people to the stage, he reported the resume of each person. For example, Wu Zonglian was said to be an old senior in the diplomatic world and was already seventy-seven years old. Pan Gongzhan was said to be the current Director of the Social Affairs Bureau who promotes domestic goods most vigorously. Hu Shuhua was said to be an industrial expert, the President of Tongji University, and a representative to the National Assembly. After each person took the stage, they nodded to the guests as a courtesy. During the speech, Wang Xiaolai asked his ninth son, Daren, who was nine years old, to represent him. Lin Kanghou followed Wang's son and gave a speech, saying that he was following in the footsteps of his brother Wang and compared himself to an old female character in a play. His witty words made everyone laugh. The various performances were varied and unspeakably beautiful. By the time the meeting was adjourned, the clock struck one o'clock. After the meal, they visited the business place for a week. Those who purchased goods were very enthusiastic. I returned and wrote this record.</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Small Study of Ms. Chen Qianyi <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Many of the popular terms in recent times have originated from transliterations of English words. The origin of these transliterations mostly comes from Shanghai. Shanghai is the first to open up to new trends and has a wider range of knowledge. When a certain thing appears, there is no way to name it at first, so it is called by a convenient transliteration. Over time, it becomes a common term. For example, the telephone is also called "delüfeng," which is a transliteration of the English word "telephone." However, sometimes the Shanghai dialect is different from the dialects of the interior and distant provinces, and those who do not know the original English word often mispronounce it. For example, "shuiting," which is used for winter heating, is a transliteration of "steam." Its meaning is water vapor. In Shanghai, "shui" (water) is pronounced "si," which is close to the original sound. However, when it is pronounced in the Jiangbei dialect or the Mandarin dialect, "shui" is not pronounced "si," which does not match the original word. Moreover, "shuiting" is often confused with "shuimending," and it is suspected to be an abbreviation of "shuimending." This is even more of a mistake. Little do they know that "shuimending" is cement, which is a transliteration of "cement." It is only because the transliteration was not very accurate at the beginning that it shares two characters with "shuiting" today. In fact, it should be transliterated as "ximente," which is not very different from the original. Another example is the "shafa" chair. In the Shanghai dialect, "sha" is pronounced "shu," which is consistent with the pronunciation of the original word "sofa." However, it is pronounced differently by people in Jiangbei and distant provinces. The Western medicine morphine is pronounced "ma" as "mao" in the Shanghai dialect, so it matches. Another example is "paishi" (pass), where "pai" is pronounced "pa" in the Shanghai dialect, which is also the same as the original meaning. If you pronounce them in a different place, they are all not the original sounds. This is something to be aware of. In the future, the invention of nouns in Shanghai should preferably use Mandarin transliterations, and should not be entirely in the Suzhou-Shanghai dialect, so as to avoid different pronunciations and different tones in other places. For example, the word tones in a play must be sung in the dialects of Pingchu and other places. If it is sung in the Shanghai dialect, it will inevitably have the drawback of singing "xiaodongren chuangxiale" (the little Dongren broke into it) as "xiaodongning chuang'ele" (the little Dongning broke from hunger). What do the gentlemen and ladies of Shanghai think of this?</p>
<p>Other popular terms, such as "luoji," are a transliteration of "logic." Its meaning is the theory of reasoning in grammar. Recently, some people with shallow views mistakenly believe that logic is a person's name. How great is their mistake? Even some elementary school teachers in the interior do not know the truth and cannot explain it, leading to the spread of misinformation and misleading children. Special attention should be paid to this and it should be refuted. Another example is "dike tuituo," which is a transliteration of "dictator." It seems to mean a leader with the ability to command. Also, the two characters "beige" are a transliteration of "boycott." Modern writing often has words such as "beige wenti" (boycott issue), which means the issue of boycotting foreign goods. However, the transliteration of "boycott" as "beige" is rather far-fetched. It seems to be translated by people from the northern provinces. However, if we know that its source is a transliteration, we can avoid excessive criticism. However, if people in Zhenjiang read it, the character "ge" is read as the local sound of "jia," which is directly contrary to the original word, making it incomprehensible for a while. Those who study local dialects must pay attention to this. (Move funds from entertainment to disaster relief)</p>

<h3 id="e202">The American Film Industry (I) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Drama expert Hong Shen traveled to the United States this spring. His mission was to purchase new equipment, hire actors, and investigate the American film industry for the Star Film Company. He lived in Hollywood for some time, carefully studying it and gaining much insight. Speaking of the three words "Hollywood," everyone knows that it is the birthplace of American film art and a special area for the film industry. Many famous stars and directors are concentrated in one place. Their lives are very extravagant, romantic, and mysterious. Therefore, the place of Hollywood also changes customs and habits, which is very different from other places. Recently, many film practitioners have applied to the leaders of the film industry to reorganize Hollywood, reduce the shocking salaries of stars and directors, and save the wasteful expenses that are laughable. They believe that this can promote a more populist Hollywood. But whether this can be achieved in reality is still questionable. Mr. Hong Shen has now returned to China. I asked him about the current situation of the Hollywood film industry. He said that in recent years, due to overproduction and economic decline in the United States, many people have lost their jobs. The film industry has also been greatly affected and has declined sharply. Now, I will introduce his words to readers.</p>
<p>American filmmakers have recently paid much attention to "sound emotionalization." This means that in sound films, in addition to singing and music, the dialogue and speech must not only be clear but also have the sound of speech be circuitous and tactful, circuitous, and tactful, and can express emotions. This is not an easy thing to achieve. The first thing is to train the actors' pronunciation and intonation to be correct. Therefore, major film companies have hired pronunciation teachers to be responsible for guidance. The old silent film stars (silent films are silent films) have now declined. Some people compare Ms. Hu Die to Mary Pickford. Those who heard this were greatly surprised. Mary Pickford, although she was popular for a long time, has now joined the ranks of those who are immersed in decline. Lionel Barrymore has achieved great success with his old stage experience. His new film, "A Free Soul," is his proud work. Because film actors spend a longer time preparing to practice pronunciation, they continue to act on set during the set-up time. This is a remedy for the company's time economy.</p>
<p>The equipment in China's major theaters simply cannot compare with the top-class theaters in the United States. Often, old movie machines that are considered obsolete abroad are slightly modified and transported to China and installed in the best theaters. Therefore, when it comes to pronunciation, Chinese theaters are far behind foreign theaters. Other things need not be said.</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>Madam Li also knew clearly that constantly receiving Mr. Chen's money and things was not proper. Although Mr. Chen willingly gave them, and she did not ask for them. She felt that if her husband found out, there would definitely be an explosive scene, and others would not understand, and she would become someone rejected by all of society in the future. But her situation was really difficult, and she really couldn't refuse Mr. Chen's kindness. If she refused, it would definitely make Mr. Chen unhappy. She didn't know why she was becoming more and more indifferent to her husband, but so close to one of her husband's friends, hoping he would be happy. She didn't dare to formally propose a divorce to her husband, because even after divorcing, she might not be able to formally marry Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen has a wife, and his wife is very fierce. If I don't divorce and secretly have an affair with Mr. Chen, that would not only be unfair to my husband, but also to my own status and reputation. According to the current situation, she knew very well, and they both understood, that they had truly reached the stage of love. They were able to restrain themselves, and never made any displays of love, but in each other's hearts, they had already planted the seeds of love very high and large. They had both pondered, is this great and faithful? Or is it a sin? They were still hesitant, wavering, building up momentum, not daring to rush to the front lines; what bound them was still a kind of old morality commonly used in society.</p>
<p>Mr. Li and Madam Chen were ultimately romantics. Their views were the opposite of Mr. Chen's and Madam Li's. They felt that if the relationship between husband and wife was only limited to nominal constraints without true love, it was immoral; it was okay to find a suitable object outside the constraints of name. So when Mr. Li kissed her hand, she didn't refuse. In the darkness of the movie theater, when he kissed her forehead, she accepted it happily. When they hugged tightly while dancing, she smiled sweetly at him. Beyond that, whatever expressions of love there were, she certainly wouldn't make Mr. Li feel unhappy or frustrated. They never thought that one was a married woman and the other was a married man, and that privately falling in love without divorcing was not allowed by law or human sentiment. They only felt that they should follow their feelings without restraint, but they didn't dare reveal the news to their husband—or wife, and didn't dare let anyone in society know. Ultimately, they were still subject to a kind of constraint. This was a latent force of the old morality commonly used in society.</p>
<p>▲Correction　Yesterday in "The Husband's Wife," line 17 ("was also entirely managed by Madam Li") was mistakenly printed as ("was also entirely managed by Mr. Li"). This correction is hereby made.</p>

<p>— Lu Mengshu</p>
<p>(Besides those with lasting value, among Western films, I prefer the vulgar and evil ones to those that are not thorough. No matter how vulgar and absurd the "Story" is, once it is made into a movie, it gives people a wonderful Fantasy. You can treat the whole play as a beautiful dream. In a sense, movies are dreams that are slightly clearer than ordinary dreams. People not only dream when they are asleep, but also want to dream when they are awake. We go to the movie theater to have a (day dream) Day Dream, probably because of this. When I go to see movies, I always like to go during the day, and I like to go in spring and summer, especially when I have goosebumps in the spring and summer, which can best arouse various fantasies. After watching and coming back, when I sleep on the pillow at night, that kind of fantasy still comes and goes in my mind, communicating with sleep dreams. As a result, I don't know whether that is a dream or a movie. Only a beautiful phantom remains in my mind for a long time. Movies can really be called dreams made by humans using machines. The progress of science and the development of human intelligence have given us all kinds of crafts, and even dreams are made. Although wine and music are said to be the greatest masterpieces of human works, movies are indeed one of the greatest masterpieces...)</p>
<p>For more than ten years, I have been watching movies with a single-minded yearning, and I naturally express twelve points of sympathy for the above paragraph, and ("that kind of fantasy still comes and goes in my mind, communicating with sleep dreams") is nothing less than writing a confession for me. The above paragraph is a section from "The Artist's Home" by the modern Japanese writer Jun'ichirō Tanizaki. I transcribed it from Tian Han's ("Silver Dream"). ("Silver Dream") is a small book that I compiled from various issues of ("Silver Star") on a winter night in the 17th year of the Republic of China and handed it over to Liangyou Bookstore and Printing Company for publication. At that time, it was a severely cold night. There was neither a stove nor an electric light in the pavilion room. Only in the dim light of the flickering candlelight, in the shivering cold, I compiled it, drinking two pots of boiled water, smoking more than a dozen cigarettes, and burning two small holes in my cotton robe with the cigarettes. It is a kind of film essay, a masterpiece written in the era before the southern tour and Proletariat. The lightness and beauty of the writing, the elegance and smoothness of the writing, all demonstrate the author's cultivation in literature. In particular, the article ("Apricot Girl") can best reveal the author's charming style of writing. The author was originally a sketching master with a long-standing reputation, and also a writer in various fields in the Chinese literary world. He has always been enthusiastic about the drama movement, and the movie has also worked hard (to go to the people), but the music is too high and few harmonize, and because of the environment, he cannot reach the people. His ambition has not been fulfilled, but therefore, in his works, there is often his (unspeakable emotion) under the guise of a topic. I have always loved his works, and I have compared them to the sensual girl on Ten Family Street, and that sensual girl has almost become the idol I privately admire. However, this is only a thing of the past. Now the author has (woken up from the silver dream). Everyone is drunk and I am the only one awake(?). Perhaps he will laugh at me, who is still snoring in the (silver dream),</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>However, ("Silver Dream"), this small book, will be equal to the author's ("Traces of Spring Dreams"), and will soon (disperse like the wind and clouds).</p>
<p>Movies are charming goblins. She and I seem to have a predestined relationship, but also seem to have deeply rooted evil. Since making a covenant with it, I have been repeatedly devastated. Although it comes from the outside world, it cannot be said that it was not given by the movie. Its bewitching seduction makes me fascinated and intoxicated, and I suffer excessive pain without knowing it. Although I have now realized it, its passionate fire still makes me infinitely nostalgic.</p>
<p>Since I met the movie, I have automatically served it, doing publicity, running a monthly magazine, working hard with my hands and feet, and not stopping for several years. As a result, I won a pile of debts, and both my material and spiritual well-being suffered great damage. Unfortunately, I also had a major lawsuit because of it. That was last year. Because of the continuation of the ("Movie Monthly") contract, I had a disagreement with the publisher, and because of ("The Little History of the Star"), both sides broke down emotionally in a fit of anger, so they quarreled with each other and then resorted to the court. At that time, when they were suing each other, I was suffering from a very high fever, and my mind was confused. Everything was presided over by the proxy lawyer, and my buttocks were burned by fire. In this situation of suffering from famine and illness, in the lawsuit, it seemed that I was implicitly operating the inevitable victory of suffering losses and being deceived. Originally, I was blind to the law, let alone when I was sick and injured, how could I not suffer losses and be deceived? When a paper judgment was sent by the court clerk, the amount of compensation marked on it scared me. You can find someone with a sign to fully represent you in a lawsuit, but you have to take out the money yourself to pay for the compensation. So I gritted my teeth. Although I have only paid off a quarter of it so far, this debt must be cleared sooner or later. In this way, I have to desperately exchange my waste paper for money to make up the amount to pay off this lawsuit debt. My entire fortune is just a bald pen. The output of a bald pen is really limited for a person as stupid as me, so I am still (a grateful disciple, surrounded by debts). However, although these can be said to be self-inflicted, they cannot be regarded as the devastation I suffered because of the movie. (To be continued)</p>
