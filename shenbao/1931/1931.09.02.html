<p>與水災同時發生之民食問題記者前已爲評陳述其情勢之嚴重矣據邇日消息我政府向美商借小麥正在積極交涉中且有實現之可能吾人固深感政府之軫念民瘼及美國救災卹隣之盛意惟記者尙有一意足供政府當局參考</p>
<p>目前我國糧食收穫之情形關内關外恰相務盾即關内苦飢而關外苦飽關内苦不給而關外則苦剩餘過多不足固急迫眉睫而有鉅額之剩餘無銷售之市塲亦足爲農業經濟之致命打擊東北大陸萬里沃地農產豐裕而大豆之出產額尤爲世界冠各種農除自給外輸出海外者年佔全輸出額十分之九有奇據中東經濟月刋統計以十九年爲例東北大豆產額約五·二六九·二七○公噸其他豆類三六九·二七○公噸高梁四·七七九·六九○公噸小米三·二七六·四八○公噸小麥一·三五六·六六○公噸水稻一五四·三五○公噸陸稻一五七·八四○噸其他雜糧一·七一二七六○公噸各種食糧收穫總計共爲一八六七二·○○○公噸而東北全部人口之消費量則共爲一一·二八二·一二○公噸消費剩餘應爲七·五八九·八八○公噸此鉅大之剩餘食糧年爲我國出口之大宗關係東北經濟至鉅自近年世界經濟蕭寥歐美之銷路鈍滯東北即頓感生產過剩金融奇緊農產山積而農民無以爲生社會經濟全呈破產東北當局且限制種植大豆並組設購連東三省特產事務所收買米麥豆等農產以甦農困積儲過多之農戶甚且有付諸一炬者準此現象而言則東北糧食囤積數量之鉅及農業經濟之凋落蓋可想見故東北雖農產豐收而民生凋敝急待政府救濟實與中原之荒歉異趣而同歸同爲關係我國脈民生之嚴重問題</p>
<p>又據本報八月三十日哈爾濱通信蘇聨在哈爾濱設立糧食貿易所並設分所於富錦備價購買我内地大豆雜糧計劃收買一千萬甫（每甫三十斤）現第一批二百萬甫已實現東北各地存儲遂紛運富錦求售就此種現象言則吾人以爲與其向美商借小麥則孰若先向東北商購如果不足然後再謀及美蓋國内有鉅額之剩餘價值旣廉轉運又便似爲今日不易得之機會若我不自謀而坐視蘇聨之收買已屬失策且不惜舉債以遠求之美國爲美國剩餘糧食謀出路更非計之得者也</p>
<p>吾人今日借箸而商以爲政府應先設法籌措欵項或由政府發行公債或由國内銀行界墊欵公平估價儘量吸收東北過剩之食糧再由鐵道免費轉運南來分配災區是則一可以急救嗷嗷待哺之災黎二可以準備災後荒歉之民食三可以挽救東北經濟之危機四可以免舉借鉅大之外債有四利無一弊謹貢所見深願我政府一細籌思</p>

<h3 id="c97">今後職業敎育之焦點 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>楊衛玉</p>
<p>過去敎育之失敗、已成爲一般的公論自本年四月敎育部明令推廣職業敎育、而敎育界空氣爲之一振、自國民會議確定敎育實施方案盡量增設職業學校、而敎育界之中心、爲之大變、民國廿年度方始、全國學校之調查統計、尙不可得、但僅就江蘇一省、上海一市所知、新增之職業中學、共逹五十以上、而普通中學之增設職業科者、猶未計焉若以全國二十八省、各直轄市合計之其數必極可觀、職業敎育之發展、至今日可謂盛矣、雖然此特景的擴張耳、若究其質、恐未必有若是之易且速也、故今後職業敎育之焦點、决不在於如何可以推廣、如何可以發展、而在如何可以充實、如何可以適應、質言之、不在數量的擴充、而在質量的充實也、</p>
<p>今日敎育部方召集專家及各部有關係代表、集商職業敎育種種問題、爲整個的設計、此誠根本之圖、亦急不容緩之舉也、蓋我國之提倡職業敎育不自今日始職業學校於各行省、高中之設職業科者、亦隨處可見、然而大部分畢業學生、不適用於實際生活如故、畢業於學校、失業於社會者亦如故、此無他、蓋因設置不適當、目的不確定、設施無標凖、大率徒有其名、而無其實、故各省市縣之學校統計表有職業學校若干、高中職業科若干、而其結果與普通學校殊無異致、若即以此爲推廣職業敎育、實不啻斵喪職業敎育矣、今敎部旣有見於此、而有各種之設計、當然與以前之漫無標準者大不相同僕之所以再進一言者、有法固勝於無法、然法而不適應環境與時代者、亦等於無法耳、</p>
<p>最近幾月、時承各地同志之見告、謂欲辦中學請求立案、敎育廳局、勒令非辦職業不可、普通中學欲行職業化、概設會計或園藝選科、廳局又令非改組商科農科不可等……在廳局奉行政令、提倡職業敎育、其意誠可敬也、然在一般辦學者則苦矣、於是爲遵令計、只得紛紛改組改科、而將來之如何謀出路、現在之如何準備、無暇計及、如此情形、其能免於有名無實者、亦幾希矣、故僕以爲敎育部、對於規定設施職業敎育標準、至少還要注意到下面幾個問題、</p>
<p>一·適應地方環境多予人以試騐研究機會歐美各國敎育之法令固未嘗不有、然不至發現窒礙難行者、多留各省以適用之活動、學者以試騐之機會也、</p>
<p>一·分科宣細宜具體農之中有若干科、工之中分科更多、即商亦可分别爲若干科、許辦學者、在不妨害標準之下、自由設置、</p>
<p>一·嚴定設備之標準農工科之宜有相當設備、夫人而知矣、商科何獨不然、頗聞各省以急於辦理職業學校、不問環境需要之如何、皆辦商科、以爲易於設置、此實根本大誤、宣有標準以繩之、</p>
<p>一·指示出路之方針職業學校、最大之效用在能有出路、假使三年以後、今之紛紛辦職業學校者、仍紛紛求出路而不得、即爲職業敎育之失敗、如何去謀出路、如何可以廣出路、則須賴敎部設計諸公之指示矣、</p>
<p>一·規定設校必要之條件學校之良否不僅在遵崇法令、而在組織之是否健全、凡設職業學校宜調查其設科是否適宜、設備是否完全、經費是否充足、若徒以其表式之是否合格爲准許之標準、殊甚危險、</p>
<p>至於課程敎材之如何編訂、學校設施之標準如何、等等爲設計諸君子所早計及、恕不贅陳</p>
<p>要聞</p>

<p>好幾年前，我見着曾國藩寫的一副對聨，先看下聨，是：（愛養盆魚識化機），心裏很不以爲然。因爲魚的自由世界是江，河，湖，海；那一處不可以認識它們的化機，何必要把活潑的魚兒捉到盆裏來呢？盆是魚的監牢；盆魚是上了枷鐐鎖栲的囚犯。現在捨掉江，河，湖，海之大而要在監牢式的小盆裏追求造化之機不但是違反自然而且是表示度量之狹隘。我素來反對籠中養鳥，所以不知不覺的對於盆中養魚也發生一種深刻的不滿。我便帶着這種不滿意的態度去看上聨我見上聨寫的是：（不除庭草留生意），不禁連呌幾聲好，歡喜得把心裏的不滿都忘掉了從此我便想用這個意思來造一座齋舍，稱它爲不除庭草齋。但是吃着早餐愁着晚餐的人那有餘欵造房子？退一步想齋主雖做不成，何妨做個齋夫。好，就這麽說，這個不除庭草齋夫的頭銜，恕我自封了。需要齋夫的人們，請看清這個名字來我；否則你要除草，我不除草，弄殭起來，怎麽辦呢？</p>

<p>— 才良</p>
<p>金山僻處海隅。民風淳樸。其舊縣治地曰康城。即前南京市長何民魂氏之故里也。該地當明末嘉靖時。每值歲稔。倭人輙渡海而來。恣意騷擾。及官軍聞訊至則彼輩已飽掠而去。魚肉我民幾視爲常例。時有里人名方炳靈者。慨倭人之肆無忌憚。而頗思有以戢燄。於是盡斥其私資。獨建一城垣以爲屏障。並創辦團防及敷設弓矢等防禦工事。以爲不時之需未數月而倭人又至。仍剽掠如故。方公乃督率團丁。挺身與之戰。甫交鋒。而倭人即告敗衂俘獲幾占其半。因大恐。跪伏乞降。公不之允盡殲之。而倭禍乃息繼而事聞於朝。正議懋賞。詎榮命未頒。而公忽以暴疾歾。耗音旣播。上下震悼。邑之人更哭之哀。間或有爲之服孝者。蓋念地方無公。則必遭塗炭。而公於地方。卒以身殉。毁家紓難。大義凛然縱觀史乘。實罕其匹。旋衆議以公德之不可没。乃醵資立廟以享其靈。並勒石以疏其事。迄今三日餘載。廟貌常新。歲時祭祀。未嘗或闕。且每值廢歷之中元節。例必有香會之舉。屆時各方之來游者。固無間遐邇。而一般江湖賣解者流。亦復趨之若驚。如滬上星相家吳鑒光倪天鴻輩。類皆不辭跋涉。虔誠朝謁。說者以是謂方公亦彼黨中人。確否雖不可必。然以一匹夫而受後人尊敬若此。則良非易易。誠未知今日之踞高位而食厚禄者。睹此其亦有動於中乎。</p>

<p>丑爲戲劇脚色之名。俗稱小花面。飾之者以滑稽突梯。一舉一動。能逗人發笑者爲工至其名稱之由來。有謂宋徽宗時。舉國人來朝。帝使優人效之以爲戲。因有　角之名。　丑雙聲。故又省作丑。然余讀明史。明憲宗時太監汪直。與王越陳鉞結爲腹心。狼狽爲好。勢傾中外。人皆側目。有中官名阿丑者。善詼諧。恒於上前作院本。頗有譎諫風。一日。丑作醉者酗酒狀。前遣人佯曰。某官至。酗駡如故。又曰駕至。酗駡又如故。曰汪太監來。醉者始驚迫帖然。旁一人曰。駕至不懼。而懼汪太監。何也。曰。吾知有汪太監。而不知有天子。又一日。忽效直衣冠。持雙斧趨蹌而行。或問故。答曰。吾將兵。惟仗此兩鉞耳。問鉞何名。曰王越陳鉞也。上微晒。自是直寵漸衰。未幾罷斥。後人以丑能感主悟。頗有東方淳于之風。因效之爲戲。即以其名名角。而丑角之名以立。二說未知孰是以余觀之。前說未免穿鑿附會。不如後說之信而有徵也</p>

<p>昨天遇到了一位二十年來沈浸在戀愛的苦海中的朋友。不知他又受了甚麽剌激。對我說以下的幾句話。（我不願一箇人去自殺。這一死死得太懦怯了。我又不願硬拉着愛人去同死。這一死死得太卑劣了。安得三尺龍泉創。走遍天下。殺盡那可愛的女性。斬除戀愛的禍根。以免爲害青年。頽廢了他們的一生。然後横刀一笑。慷慨就死。但是。我又没有這能力。最後的一着。惟有瀝誠祈禱。願彗星碰着了地球。打它一箇虚空粉碎。使男的。女的。有情的。無情的。一切衆生。同歸於盡。豈不乾凈。豈不爽快。）</p>

<p>人見絹枝的情書</p>
<p>造成世界最高紀錄的日本女子田徑賽怪傑人見絹枝女士的逝世。本報已經登載過了。這樣一位年才花信活潑剛健的女郎的死耗。正不知賺得了多少同情者的熱涙。</p>
<p>在現代八千萬的日本男女中。能爲全世界人士所知名的。除了東鄕元帥之外。便是這位人見女士了。再不料老人矍鑠如常。而女士已香銷玉殞。這眞是日本體育界一個重大的損失。</p>
<p>女士夭折的消息。是傳遍了人間。女子國際競技聨盟。在巴黎爲女士開追悼會。英國各地方代表女子選手田徑賽運動會。在開幕之先。全體靜默一分鐘。爲女士默禱。德意志·美利堅·瑞士·荷蘭各國的婦女界運動界。都紛紛來電表示悲悼。我國愛好運動的青年將軍張學良副司令。亦有電到東致唁。各界贈送的花圈。多得不可勝數。岡山市敎育會已籌備爲女士建築銅像。紀念這巾幗英雄。本月十二日是女士舉殯的日子。前往執紼者萬餘人。女孩兒家這樣的哀榮。實以人見女士爲第一人。</p>
<p>人見女士還是一個米曾訂婚的姑娘。昭和三年女士由荷蘭麥加第九次萬國與林匹克大會歸來。社會上盛傳女士將與某少年結婚。但是結果並未實現。多少傾倒於女士的木屐兒郎。常常寫信給女士毛遂自荐。可是他們都碰壁了。當初就有人說女士已另有（點心）。（點心者甜心也）然而一般人以爲這是不得志的青年造謡。不能相信。不料女士死後。在病床的日記本内。發現一封未寫完的情書。纒綿悱惻。哀艶非常。料想那傷心人讀此書時。定已愁腸寸斷了。</p>
<p>（我懷念的Ｇ。我眞煩悶。要是我不能早日戰勝病魔。而跳出這樊籠似的醫院時。我不知要何時才能和你自由通信呢。丨那是火曜日的午後吧。也許是月曜日的午後。我正朦朧着的時候。我的看護婦花子拿了一封淺緑色的信壳。想跨進我的房門。但是伊立刻受着坐在我床邊的母親的暗示。而退出去了。</p>
<p>醫士拒絕了來訪問我的賓客。不令我讀一切友人們的信札。也禁止我寫信給任何友人。他們以爲這是使病人靜攝的唯一妙法。然而他們是永不會知道你的信是我更有效的藥劑。</p>
<p>我近來時常感到失眠。昨宵凄凉的月光。照在我的窓櫺上。使我回想到去年。回想到去年我們在一個月白風清把臂深深談的晚上。Ｇ那是一個多麽值得追憶的晚上啊。</p>
<p>前天我的姊姊從故鄕到大阪來看我。伊是一個賢妻良母。有着可愛的孩子和甜蜜的家庭。伊的談話中。似乎在替我感到身世的悲哀。似乎在以爲我的生活太無聊太孤獨了。但是Ｇ喲。我倒孤獨慣了呢。</p>
<p>以上是五月二十五寫的。一擱又是十天了。在這十天裏。我的病有了良好的經過。醫生說照現在的情形。如果没有變化。六月底我便可以退院。那末七月杪我們可以相見於東京了。七月。我期待的七月啊。</p>
<p>Ｇ。你可曾回家去過麽。我眞無限的歉仄。常常累得你爲我掛慮焦心。現在我快好了。我是一定會好的。Ｇ喲你自己珍重着罷。你要努力呀。）</p>
<p>自信功名關妾份。儘留顔色待君歡。不料好事多磨。於今竟成語　。這封未寄的遺書。實在是篇哀情小說的好材料。</p>

<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>在最近的時期中，這屋子裏的空氣，只呈着緊張，濛晦酸澀，和不可名狀的尖端而不協調。舊時的融和。快樂，</p>
<p>甜蜜，是一些也没有了。李夫人每夜不論是刮西北風，下雨雪，十分嚴寒而室中並没有生爐子的時光中，惫總是枯坐着等候丈夫的回家。伊明知道不妨找一些針綫做活計，可以解岑寂，但是事實往往與理想相反，伊因爲切盼着丈夫，拿了剪子裁衣，也許會裁了袴子，應當縫密針的，也許會縫得很稀疏，甚而至於針戮在自己的手指上，鮮血沾污了新衣還不覺得，所以只有不做，索性枯坐着，凝神，側耳，注意到門外有没有車輛和行路的聲息。丈夫走路的脚聲，伊是聽慣而很熟識的了，所以遠遠地的脚聲，常會使伊驚喜而走近了，終於使伊失望。時鐘的擺，是這樣的平衡均匀地摇蕩而推進時間，十分敎人聽着厭倦；庭中的風聲，是這樣獅吼般不息，打在樓窗上，震撼得屋子都有些摇動。伊除了惱怨丈夫辜負香衾而外，還給他憂急疑慮是否很平安的在外面。</p>
<p>近來李先生的心神，確是很不寗靜，幾乎有些坐立不安了，</p>
<p>夫人怎麽會瞧不出呢。他常常精神恍惚，氣度十分的沉默，笑容和言語都比往常稀少了幾倍，飲食也减退，决不是没有心事的人才這樣的。李夫人枯坐於寂寞的冷夜中，常猜想着丈夫這樣改變態度的原因，是甲麽？是乙麽？或者是丙……丁……戊……麽？一項一項都仔細地想到，都得不到一個確切的答案；於是又想到自己或者有過一件事，或者那一句話使他感到不愉快？却又找不到一小端的痕跡，足以使他對於家庭會這樣的發生厭倦。伊在許多猜想的懸題中，確定着比較的是戀愛事件的成因居多數，於是又擬想到丈夫另外戀愛了别一個女子以後的影響丨丨他的身體是衰弱了，他的經濟是窘迫了，他的家庭是破碎了，他一切進取的前途是受到阻礙而停滯了，這是多麽危險的現象啊！伊憂慮現在與將來他和伊的幸福，是這樣的摇摇欲墜，一顆微弱的心，震顫得幾乎碎了。</p>

<p>All Non-Essential Construction to be Suspended</p>
<p>Public Servants Should Donate Salaries to Aid Relief</p>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government has issued seven orders in response to the flood disaster as follows:</p>
<p>(1) An order directed to the directly subordinate agencies, stating: "The people in the flood-stricken provinces are suffering the most severely. The government should prioritize urgent needs and practice thrift. Hereafter, all agencies nationwide must suspend all non-essential construction. The funds saved should be used for disaster relief. The order is to be transmitted to subordinate agencies for compliance."</p>
<p>(2) An order directed to the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan, stating: "This major disaster is due to the lack of preparedness and the ineffectiveness of disaster prevention. Local officials cannot evade blame. The two Yuans should investigate and severely punish officials responsible for local and water conservancy matters who neglected the repair of dikes and the dredging of waterways."</p>
<p>(3) An order directed to all directly subordinate agencies that all banquets by agency personnel should be specially reduced.</p>
<p>(4) An order to the Executive Yuan to instruct local officials in all provinces to be responsible for relocating disaster victims and preventing them from becoming homeless.</p>
<p>(5) An order directed to all directly subordinate agencies that all officials nationwide, employees of state-owned enterprises, teachers and staff of public schools, staff of public educational institutions, and comrades working in party departments, with monthly salaries of 100 yuan or more, should donate 5%; those with salaries of 200 yuan or more should donate 10%;</p>

All matters related to the Committee and various provinces, cities, and organizations should be handled directly by the Committee through official documents and telegrams instead of being relayed through provincial departments. Matters requiring instructions or reports should still be submitted to the Executive Yuan for separate review and handling."</p>
<p>(7) An order to the Executive Yuan, stating: "In the future, when the floodwaters recede, there will be a shortage of working cattle. Local officials should prohibit the sale of working cattle and establish appropriate reception measures to benefit farmers." The order is to be transmitted for conscientious implementation.

Chiang Kai-shek, along with He Chengjun and Liu Zhenhua, emerged from the auditorium. Chairman He Chengjun said that Chiang Kai-shek came to Hankou specifically to inspect the flood disaster and requested instructions. Chiang Kai-shek then spoke, with the main points being: (1) The disaster in Hubei is extraordinarily severe, causing deep pain, but human determination can overcome nature. As long as everyone works together, the original state can be restored. (2) Disaster relief requires first ensuring social order and national unity. Only then can the disaster be eliminated. (3) Since history began, natural disasters have occurred in every era. Peace and prosperity after a major disaster are particularly precious. Therefore, everyone must work together to save the disaster to reach a happy future. He had seen that the government and all sectors were working hard on post-disaster relief. He hoped that all party members would assist government personnel and work together to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on the Principle of People's Livelihood based on economic principles to strive for disaster relief. After the ceremony, the meeting adjourned. Chiang Kai-shek, along with He Chengjun and Liu Zhenhua, went to inspect the disaster victim shelters in Wenhua Middle School and Second Middle School, comforting the disaster victims. He also ascended the small hill behind the school to inspect the flood situation, then returned to the ship. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e26">A Discussion on Purchasing Food from the Northeast <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The food problem, which occurred simultaneously with the flood disaster, was previously discussed by the reporter, who described the seriousness of the situation. According to recent news, our government is actively negotiating with American merchants to borrow wheat, and there is a possibility of this being realized. We deeply appreciate the government's concern for the people's suffering and America's kindness in providing disaster relief and assisting its neighbor. However, the reporter has one idea that can be used for the government authorities' reference.</p>
<p>Currently, the harvest situation in our country is such that the situation inside the borders is quite different from that outside the borders, that is, there is severe hunger inside the borders, and there is an overabundance of food outside the borders. It is urgent to alleviate the insufficient food supply inside the borders, while the huge surplus outside the borders and the lack of a market for sales is enough to be a fatal blow to the agricultural economy. The Northeast is a vast and fertile land with abundant agricultural production, and the production of soybeans is the world's highest. Each year, of various agricultural products other than those for self-sufficiency, those exported overseas account for more than nine-tenths of the total amount exported. According to the "East Asian Economic Monthly" statistics, taking 1930 as an example, the Northeast's soybean production was about 5,269,270 metric tons, other beans 369,270 metric tons, sorghum 4,779,690 metric tons, millet 3,276,480 metric tons, wheat 1,356,660 metric tons, rice 154,350 metric tons, dry rice 157,840 tons, and other grains 1,712,760 metric tons. The total harvest of various food grains was 18,672,000 metric tons, while the consumption of the entire population of the Northeast was 11,282,120 metric tons. The surplus consumption should be 7,589,880 metric tons. This huge surplus of food grains is a major component of our country's exports and is of great importance to the Northeast's economy. Since the world economy has been sluggish in recent years, and sales to Europe and the Americas have been slow, the Northeast has immediately felt an overproduction and tight financial situation. Agricultural products are piling up, and farmers have no way to make a living, presenting a complete breakdown of the social economy. The Northeast authorities are even restricting the planting of soybeans and have established a "Special Products Office of the Three Eastern Provinces" to purchase rice, wheat, beans, and other agricultural products to alleviate farmers' difficulties. Some farmers with excessive stockpiles have even burned them. Based on this phenomenon, the enormous quantity of food stored in the Northeast and the decline of the agricultural economy can be imagined. Therefore, although the Northeast has a bountiful harvest of agricultural products, the people's livelihood is declining, and they urgently need government relief. This is different from the famine in the Central Plains, but both lead to the same serious problems related to our national livelihood.</p>
<p>According to the Harbin correspondence of this newspaper on August 30, the Soviet Union has established a grain trading station in Harbin and set up branch stations in Fujin to purchase mainland soybeans and miscellaneous grains at reserve prices, with plans to purchase 10 million fu (each fu is 30 jin). The first batch of 2 million fu has already been realized. Grain merchants in the Northeast have been rushing to transport their stocks to Fujin to sell. Regarding this phenomenon, we believe that it would be better to purchase from the Northeast first rather than borrowing wheat from American merchants. If that is not enough, then consider the American option. If we do not plan for ourselves and instead watch the Soviet Union buy up the food, that would be a mistake. It is also unwise to borrow heavily from America to find a way out for America's surplus grain.</p>
<p>We offer our advice and believe that the government should first find ways to raise funds, either by issuing government bonds or by having domestic banks advance funds, fairly assess the value, and absorb the excess food grains from the Northeast as much as possible. Then, the railways should provide free transportation to the south to distribute to the disaster areas. This would: 1. Quickly relieve the starving disaster victims; 2. Prepare food for the people after the disaster; 3. Save the Northeast economy from crisis; 4. Avoid borrowing huge foreign debts. It has four advantages and no disadvantages. We respectfully offer our opinions and sincerely hope that our government will carefully consider them.</p>

Local officials and members of Congress are largely backing the committee. Overseas Chinese are forced to leave tonight. Customs officials here today declared they have agreed with the State Department and immigration authorities to allow the group of overseas Chinese to pass through the U.S. territory temporarily. A batch of Chinese have given a guarantee to U.S. immigration officials to go to San Francisco and return to their home country by ship and pass through the border. 4,000 Chinese in Sonora, USA, one-third have already left Mexican territory.

<p>German-Austrian Tax Treaty May be Difficult to Establish</p>
<p>▲A Nationalist dispatch from Geneva on the 1st: The League of Nations Council convened its 64th session today. This session will focus on concluding the League of Nations' work of the previous year and drafting the final report for submission to the 12th annual meeting of the League of Nations Assembly, to be convened on September 7. Before the Assembly accepts the Council's report, the New European Commission will meet on September 3 to adopt various proposals submitted by countries to the League of Nations in recent months on European recovery and economic integration, and then submit them to the Council for a decision on how to implement them. The Council convened today is actually the last session of the current organization, because when this session of the Assembly meets, three new council members will be elected to replace the outgoing council members from Spain, Persia, and Venezuela. It is expected that Spain will be elected as a semi-permanent council member, China will replace Persia, and Bolivia or Uruguay will replace Venezuela. After the three new council members are elected, the Council will convene its 65th session, which will be held until the close of the Assembly, so that it can implement the various proposals resolved by the Assembly at any time. An important event that will be resolved at this Council meeting is the German-Austrian Customs Agreement, and the recent resolution adopted at the London Conference to restore German financial stability. The next is the German complaint that Poland is abusing the German minority in Upper Silesia.</p>
<p>▲A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 31st: The German-Austrian customs union agreement, which shook Europe in May of this year, is now expected to be cancelled. Opponents of this agreement have arisen, especially France. As a result, the issue was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. Although the verdict has not yet been announced, it is widely believed that the court will declare that Germany has the inherent right to negotiate a customs union with Austria, but that Austria is bound by the 1922 Geneva Agreement and cannot conclude such a union. It is heard that Austria has abandoned the plan for the alliance. In this way, Austria will have more opportunities to discuss loans with France.</p>

<p>▲A Nationalist dispatch from Washington on the 31st: The conditions for deferred purchase of wheat recently proposed by China have been rejected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture today. The Department has now put forward another counter-proposal, but the content has not yet been announced and will probably remain confidential until China accepts it. In order to relieve flood victims, China is negotiating with the United States to purchase 15 million bushels of wheat. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to negotiate, advocating that the wheat price repayment period should be between two and a half and four and a half years with an interest rate of 4.5%, and that 5 million bushels should be shipped each month for three months. After considering this, China proposed that the repayment period should be at least ten years, and requested a reduction in interest, but this has been rejected by the Department of Agriculture today. It is now expected that China will still insist on extending the repayment period and reducing the interest.</p>

<p>British Newspaper Comments on Shanghai Concession, Deliberately Creating Alarmist Talk</p>
<p>▲A Nationalist dispatch from New York on the 31st: The New York Sun reported that Britain is willing to immediately give up consular jurisdiction in China, except for Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. As for the three ports of Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin, it proposed the organization of a Sino-foreign committee to study ways to abolish consular jurisdiction as soon as possible, but this has been rejected by the National Government, because China can only accept unconditional abandonment of consular jurisdiction.</p>
<p>▲A Reuters dispatch from London on the 31st: This morning's editorial in The Times expressed concern about the future of Shanghai, saying that negotiations between the central government on the abolition of consular jurisdiction had unfortunately resumed and been hastily completed in six months. It is rumored that what was agreed upon was not based on the Feetham Report. Fortunately, this agreement is only a test, and the British government can still carefully consider the Feetham recommendations. It also said that anyone who reads the Feetham Report knows that the abolition of consular jurisdiction will destroy the foundation of Shanghai's development system. The newspaper also cited the disappearance of Trautmann and other events as evidence that the Chinese government cannot punish illegal soldiers and political parties, and finally stated that the relationship between the concession and the Chinese government and the treaty countries can be decided by a conference with the equal participation of all parties, and this conference obviously cannot ignore the Feetham Report.</p>
<h3 id="e67">First Meeting of the New British Cabinet Discusses Economic Proposals <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Date of Parliament's Convening Undecided</p>
<p>Thomson Resigns from the Railway Workers' Union</p>
<p>▲A Reuters dispatch from London on the 31st: The new Cabinet held its first meeting this afternoon, lasting three hours and fifteen minutes. The economic proposals have been almost fully studied, and what still needs to be resolved is the issue of salary cuts for Cabinet ministers, members of Parliament, civil servants, judges, and teachers in national schools. The financial proposals have been left for continued discussion tomorrow. Reuters has learned that the Cabinet's aim is to formulate a reduction program that can win the support of a majority in the House of Commons, so that it can be passed quickly. However, the Prime Minister has now included proposals previously supported by Henderson and other Labour Cabinet ministers in order to win his personal final victory. It is expected that the Cabinet will still hold several meetings this week and continue to study the reports of the two committee groups: (1) proposals on economic and tax issues, (1) parliamentary procedures. The Cabinet has already considered this this afternoon and will discuss it again today to agree on a final plan to fulfill the government's responsibility to balance the budget. The content of this plan, according to the usual budget procedure, may not be made public until Parliament convenes. The date of a special meeting of the House of Commons will be announced soon. It is generally expected that the House of Commons can convene on Tuesday of next week, but some quarters say that it will have to be delayed for another week, that is, after September 15. The Labour members of the previous government have now almost all left, so the positions of junior ministers and other officials in the new Cabinet will be shared by the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. There is much speculation in political circles about how long the new government will need to fulfill its special responsibilities. Liberal Westerner Maclun, the current Secretary of Education, stated yesterday that no one can predict how long the government will be in office. We must first know that the new government's goal is the complete restoration of British debt trust. If this takes a little longer, then the people of the country will definitely give it enough time to complete its work. Once the goal is reached, the people of the country can freely choose the party they trust as the future leader. The Manchester Guardian reported that the government's work is unusual, so it will not be dispersed immediately due to failure in Parliament. It will only end its life when the government itself is willing to dissolve.</p>

<p>Retaliatory Action by Ukrainians</p>
<p>Army Officers Selling State Secrets One After Another</p>
<p>▲A Nationalist News Agency dispatch from Warsaw on the 31st: This morning, Lower House MP, Mr. Holoubek, was assassinated in a hotel in the scenic area of Truskavets in Eastern Galicia in a particularly cruel manner, shocking the entire country. A total of six shots were fired, followed by a sharp blade thrust into the chest of the deceased. By the time the people living with him were alerted, the assassins had already fled into the darkness. The police department has already offered a reward of about 5,000 gold pounds to capture the assassins, but so far there are no clues to be found. However, it is known that the assassins were Ukrainians. Their killing of Holoubek was a retaliatory action by Ukrainians, because although Holoubek was a Ukrainian, he has recently strongly supported Poland in the conflict between Poland and Ukraine and has been highly trusted by the Polish side. He was entrusted with the important task of negotiating with Ukraine, wanting to get Ukraine to withdraw its appeal to the League of Nations. That negotiation stopped about two weeks ago, and Polish newspapers threatened the Ukrainian people with dangerous words, which further angered the Ukrainians, so they decided to remove Holoubek. However, since Holoubek's assassination, the Polish newspapers have been very激昂 in their words, saying that such violence cannot be easily forgiven, and that the authorities in Ukraine should take harsh measures to deal with it. As a result, Polish cavalry and other forces have now set off to various provinces in Ukraine. Five leaders of the Ukrainian movement who were about to go to the League of Nations to appeal have also been suddenly arrested because of this incident.</p>
<p>▲A Nationalist News Agency dispatch from Warsaw on the 31st: Today, two officers of the General Staff, Captain Łuniewski and Lieutenant Goniński, were arrested for repeatedly providing important information on Polish national defense to Russia. Since so much of Poland's military equipment has been revealed, it has had to undergo a complete change, and the finances will inevitably suffer significant losses. The two officers have now confessed to all the crimes they committed, and the situation is extremely serious, and they will probably not be able to escape the death penalty in the future. This incident is a ripple effect of the previous case of Captain Dąbrowski selling state secrets. Dąbrowski received a salary from Soviet Russia and was responsible for spying on all Polish military plans and reporting them to the Soviet Russian military authorities. Later, the incident was revealed and he was arrested and executed.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance is Very Embarrassed</p>
<p>▲A Telegraph dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st: The Ministry of Finance, which is preparing the budget for 1932, is investigating this year's tax revenue, government-operated businesses, revenue from government-owned property, profits from monopolies, and other revenue, and knows that the trend of declining revenue is quite obvious. Among them, the decline in monopoly revenue, which has always been excellent, is even more severe. In April, it decreased by 2 million yuan, and in May, it decreased by 3.5 million yuan. After the abolition of the original sales system in July, sales decreased even more. From the beginning of the year to the end of July, the sales volume decreased by about 10 million yuan in four months. If this continues, the revenue reduction this year will reach 30 million to 40 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance is very embarrassed.</p>

<p>Impersonating a Representative of an Aircraft Factory</p>
<p>Swindling a Large Sum of Money from Guangdong Authorities</p>
<p>Arrested in San Francisco</p>
<p>▲ A dispatch from the Guomin News Agency, dated the 31st, from San Francisco: American aviators Hall and Xu Maiqian were quite well-known among foreign merchants in Shanghai. They recently went to Guangdong, claiming to be representatives of an American aircraft manufacturer. The Guangdong authorities ordered aircraft from them, and paid US$100,000. However, after the two men returned to the United States, they failed to deliver the goods. The Guangdong authorities then filed a civil lawsuit in the Los Angeles court to recover the original amount. Today, the two men secretly fled to this city but were arrested immediately upon arrival by the court, accused of attempting to evade civil litigation. It is now reported that $78,000 of the money is still in a bank in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>To all newspaper offices in Yangzhou, please note. The levee of the Grand Canal in Jiangdu's Shaobo Town and Gaoyou has successively collapsed. We have already telegraphed about the dispatch of personnel for disaster relief. Recently, according to relief workers returning to Yangzhou from the disaster area, the relief team, carrying relief supplies, set off from Yangzhou by boat towards the disaster area on the [blank]th of this month. Along the way, they distributed the supplies. However, due to the rapid currents at the Six Locks, small boats had difficulty proceeding. More than a dozen civilian boats were hired at the Xiannv Temple and towed by the ship to Kongjia Han and Maqiao villages. Residents, submerged in four to five feet of water, took refuge on high mounds, craning their necks and awaiting rescue, a truly heartbreaking sight. The disaster situation was even more severe at Gaofeng Bridge and Jijia [blank] Town. About two to three thousand disaster victims gathered on the high mounds. In areas such as Qiaoshu Town and Yangjia Zhuang, houses and fields were submerged in a vast expanse of water, with about five to six thousand disaster victims gathered on high ridges and embankments, or waiting for rescue on rooftops and tree branches. About four thousand disaster victims in the Black Peak Embankment had gone without food for two to three days. Floating corpses were seen everywhere along the way. After the relief supplies were exhausted, the original boat was used to transport disaster victims back to Yangzhou. The next day, small boats and civilian boats transported relief workers to Shaobo Town, passing through areas such as Xiukou Diaojiawan, where the floodwaters had receded and houses had been completely destroyed. Thousands of disaster victims were living in extremely miserable conditions, exposed to the elements. The eastern breach at the Six Locks was about fifteen to sixteen zhang in length, and the northern breach was about thirteen to fourteen zhang. Water from both breaches flowed downstream into the Grand Canal, turning counties such as Xinghua, Dongtai, and Taixian into a watery realm. The northern breaches at the Six Locks, Humaogun, and Dawang Temple were about four to five zhang in length. The Shaobo earth dam had four breaches, and the houses and fields below the dam were completely submerged. Several hundred disaster victims were transported to Yangzhou and placed in shelters. The next day, relief workers returning to Yangzhou reported that the Zhaoguan Dam on the Shaobo Canal had a breach of several tens of zhang. From the boat, disaster victims could be seen climbing onto tree branches, craning their necks and awaiting rescue. The food they carried was distributed during the rounds. The rooftops of houses in all the towns and villages were submerged, and countless people had drowned. After the food supplies were exhausted, they rushed back to transport food, coffins, and rescue personnel, both saving lives and laying the dead to rest. Respectfully submitted, Zhang Zhijiang bows in reverence.</p>
<p>To all newspaper offices in Ji Hongchang, please note. Since last winter, when Hongchang was ordered to be stationed in Huangchuan and lead his troops to suppress the communists, they have not been completely eradicated. Although this is due to the vastness of the communist areas, it is ultimately due to my incompetence in handling the situation, for which I am ashamed before the nation. I have always harbored this pain. Unfortunately, in May of this year, my father passed away suddenly in good health. Having lost his guidance, my grief has only increased. My nerves are weak, and I feel lost and confused. I often wake up in the middle of the night, get out of bed, and weep in my room. Although my desire to love the country and protect the people grows stronger day by day, my ability to defend against disasters and resist insults has become ineffective. Continuing in this way would be detrimental in many ways. Therefore, on the [blank]th day of the eighth month, I will hand over the positions of Commander-in-Chief of the Twenty-second Route Army and Commander of the Thirtieth Division to Supervisor Li. From then on, I will retire from the military, return to my fields, close my doors, and read books. It would be my wish to be a peaceful citizen. I respectfully submit my humble sentiments, hoping for your kind understanding. Ji Hongchang bows and affixes his seal.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Panic Arises Again Among Overseas Chinese in Korea <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Incite Turmoil</p>
<p>Consul General Zhang Negotiates with the Korean Governor-General</p>
<p>A dispatch from Incheon: During the Korean riots last month, there were rumors that our country's Consulate General in Korea had been destroyed. In reality, Koreans had discussed this but did not carry it out. Recently, since the incident of Japanese residents in Qingdao violently assaulting Chinese people, the rumors have worsened. Rumors of members of the Japanese National Essence Society attacking our country's Consulate General have resurfaced, causing great panic. According to a special edition of the Japanese-language Keijo Nippo published on the 19th, there were false claims that Chinese people in Qingdao attacked Japanese people, resulting in sixty deaths and twenty injuries among members of the National Essence Society. Consul General Zhang Weicheng, upon seeing the report, immediately requested that the Korean Governor-General's Office issue an order to take preventive measures and telegraphed our country's consuls in Korea to contact local officials to protect overseas Chinese. On the 20th, it was rumored that the Consulate General had received threatening letters from Japanese people, stating roughly: (1) A suicide squad would be formed to attack the Chinese Consulate General. (2) Overseas Chinese in Korea would be ordered to leave Korean territory. After receiving these letters, Zhang personally went to the Governor-General's Office to request an order for protection and to ban the newspapers. The Governor-General's Office agreed to comply immediately. However, the rumors remain strong, and plainclothes police are heavily deployed near the consulate every night, still fearing danger. The overseas Chinese here are like startled birds. Those with capital are returning to China in droves. Wu Xiaotang, the director of the Guang Gang, who possesses assets of hundreds of thousands of gold, also returned to Guangdong with his entire family last week. The situation for overseas Chinese is deteriorating daily, and it is feared that they will never recover. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Summary of the Gao-Shao Disaster Situation <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Breaches in Gaoyou Difficult to Block</p>
<p>Rescued Refugees Arrive in Yangzhou One After Another</p>
<p>A dispatch from Yangzhou: The flood disaster in Shaobo and Gaoyou urgently needs relief. A record of the situation is as follows.</p>
<p>▲ Three breaches in the Shaobo levee have been blocked. After breaches occurred in the levees of Shaobo and Gaoyou, a massive flood disaster occurred. According to Section Chief Cheng of the Jiangdu Public Works Office, there were a total of twenty-one breaches of various sizes between Zhaoguan and Six Locks in Shaobo (several of which dried up and stopped flowing). The danger in Gaoyou was caused by the initial collapse of the Dangjun Wharf, followed by Yumatou, Miaoxiangkou, Qigongdian, Ershilipu, and Sanshilipu, totaling six breaches. They were deep and wide, with the largest being several hundred zhang and the smallest being sixty to seventy zhang, surpassing the Jiangdu section. Currently, Shao Fuchen, Director of the Jiangdu Public Works Office, is supervising workers and security team soldiers, procuring materials, and transporting them to Shaobo to block the breaches. As of August 31st, the Yangmujiang Wharf, Wanshou Palace Datong Wharf, and three other places had been completely blocked. The Nanda Wang Temple breach could also be completed that evening. Due to the deep water and severe disaster at the Gaoyou breach, it was difficult to start blocking it. Chief Engineer Qiu Jihao of the [blank] Office arrived in Yangzhou on the 31st and boarded the Jiangdu Public Works material boat on the 1st to inspect the situation and plan the blocking project.</p>
<p>▲ Officials Inspect the Disaster, Various Circles Distribute Relief. Zhu Ziqiao, a standing committee member of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, arrived by plane on the 30th to inspect the disaster situation and then returned to Shanghai. On the morning of the 31st, Chairman Ye Chucang of Jiangsu Province also accompanied Cheng Jingsheng of the National Disaster Relief Committee on a small warship to inspect the disaster area in Shaobo and Gaoyou. Upon arriving in Shaobo, they met Security Director Li Mingyang, who had returned from Qingjiangnan, and also arrived in Shaobo Town. Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang, at 6:30 am on the 31st, led Secretary-General Sun Zhicheng, Deputy Chief of Staff Song Bangrong, Counselors Sun Yun and Chen Zemin, and several aides and guards, carrying dry rations and more than a thousand yuan in cash, on a boat from Xiannv Temple to the Shaobo and Gaoyou disaster areas to inspect the disaster and distribute relief along the way. It was reported that after inspecting Shaobo, they rested at the Xiaoguan Emperor Temple and then went north again. They carried many proclamations to prohibit lawless people from taking advantage of the disaster to loot and burn, in order to facilitate the relief of the disaster victims. In addition, the Red Swastika Society, in addition to transporting one hundred pieces of relief goods on the 30th and handing them over to Luo Zhizhi of the Chamber of Commerce to distribute them separately in Gaoyou, transported more than one hundred and thirty pieces of relief goods on the 31st, sending relief team members to join the Huaiyang Disaster Relief Association and transport them to the Qiaoshu Fan [blank] area in the Li River to help disaster victims. The County Chamber of Commerce also sent personnel to the disaster areas in Shaobo, Gaoyou, and the surrounding villages to distribute large amounts of relief supplies and engage in relief efforts. All the refugees, including more than one hundred and seventy men, women, and children, were transported by the Red Swastika Society, escorted across the river, and given money to go to their relatives and friends. On the morning of the 31st, forty-nine more people arrived, and in the evening, sixty-four more people arrived, who were distributed to various shelters for food and accommodation. Furthermore, the Jiangsu Flood Disaster Relief Association and the Jiangbei Flood Disaster Temporary Relief Association also sent personnel yesterday on four boats, Yuanli, Yongchang, Fengyu, and others, towing six barges, loaded with twenty dan of fried rice, twenty dan of white rice, thirty thousand Jingjiang chisels, and three thousand five hundred jin of sesame cakes, from the province to Fuyunmen in this city. They set sail at 4:00 am on the 31st to first go to Xinghua and then to Dongtai to distribute relief separately.</p>
<p>▲ The Water Level of the Canal Drops, Color Turns Green, and Smell is Fishy. The water level of the Yangzhou Canal has been falling for days. As of the 31st, the riverbank outside the city was one and a half feet or two feet higher than the water surface. However, the water color turned grayish-green and had a fishy smell. It was generally believed that this was caused by the flow of corpses from the disaster area. People were warned not to drink it.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Overview of the Flood Situation in Various Counties of Hubei (Continued 2) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Busan: Since the morning of July 4th, the Consulate in Busan, upon hearing of the riots in Incheon and Keijo, contacted the police station that day to take preventive measures. On the 5th and 6th, they requested the police station and the Tao Ting to telegraph the police stations in each county to make every effort to protect overseas Chinese. On the 7th, the Korean Director-General of Political Affairs passed through Busan on his way to Keijo. Consul Chen met with the Director-General to discuss severely cracking down on rioters. The Director-General replied that he would provide complete protection. By the 8th, the situation in Busan was also very tense. Although the shops were still operating as usual, Chinese women and children in various parts of the city took refuge in the consulate, numbering about sixty people. On this day, the glass windows of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce were smashed by rioters in two places. In the evening, small stones were thrown into the consulate garden. At 9:00 pm, Koreans gathered a crowd of about three hundred people in the open space on the left side of the consulate, threatening to attack the consulate. At this time, police had already been stationed at the street entrance outside the consulate, cutting off traffic. Despite the rain, the Koreans did not disperse. Later, the chief of police personally went to the consulate to direct the cavalry to drive away the crowd. However, the Koreans threw stones at the cavalry, causing them to retreat. In a critical situation, the military police were telegraphed. The Koreans dispersed only when the military police arrived on the scene, which was already late at night. At 3:00 am on the morning of the 9th, Liu Zhennian, an overseas Chinese merchant selling kimonos in Makinoshima, and Sun Zhenshu, a restaurant owner, were attacked by more than thirty rioters who smashed their doors and windows and threw all the goods in the store into the street. Overseas Chinese fled to Japanese residences. The police arrested eight rioters and detained them in the police station. Overseas Chinese were escorted to the consulate by the police to take refuge. On the evening of this day, about one hundred and sixty overseas Chinese merchants closed their businesses and took refuge in the consulate. On the evening of the 10th, Koreans gathered again in the street to the right of the consulate, numbering six to seven hundred people. They were dispersed by the military police. The situation was relatively stable on the 11th. After the consulate had earnest discussions with the Tao Ting on protection measures, it was decided to restore the business date of overseas Chinese. The Tao Fu and various halls replied that they had strictly ordered all places to make every effort to crack down on rioters and had summoned representatives from various civil groups to convey to the Koreans that they must be peaceful. The 12th was generally stable. The number of overseas Chinese taking refuge in the consulate, the Chamber of Commerce, and various firms was about three hundred and twenty men and about sixty women. As of the morning of the 15th, when Rong Bao arrived in Busan to inspect, a small number of people were still staying at the consulate. About four-tenths of those who opened stores and operated businesses had no accidents. They agreed that if there were no problems the next day, they would all open their stores and operate as usual. As for the various territories under the jurisdiction of Busan, according to reports from various parties, except for the destruction of goods at the Yuansheng Dongmen window shop of overseas Chinese merchants in Qingbe Dapu Village, only glass was broken in other places. As for the number of overseas Chinese injured in beatings, there were five people. Direct and significant losses are currently being investigated in detail.</p>
<p>Huangpi: The county was hit by continuous rainstorms, causing mountain floods. All thirteen embankments in the county successively collapsed. The eastern, western, and southern riverside areas, spanning more than sixty li, were completely submerged. (Relief measures) Telegraphed to the emergency relief association to find ways to provide relief. Xianning: Although the county is a mountainous area, continuous rainstorms and rising water in the outer rivers and lakes caused flooding of fields and crops. The disaster situation was most severe in the lakeside areas of the seventh and eighth districts, followed by the first, fourth, ninth, and tenth districts. The third and sixth districts were originally mountainous areas, but mountain floods caused the fields and houses to be washed away and damaged. (Relief measures) Temporarily allocated 300 dan of relief rice and telegraphed the emergency relief association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>Gongan: Since spring, there has been more rain than sunshine in the county. The fields in each embankment, especially those at lower elevations, have been submerged for a long time. Later, heavy rain caused the higher elevations to flood as well. Embankments such as Tianbao, Tonghe, Hao Zhangen, etc., successively collapsed. Soybeans, wheat, rice, and hemp were submerged at the bottom of the water. Cries of hunger were heard everywhere, and huts were turned into ruins.

Countless crops were submerged. (Relief measures) Telegraphed to the emergency relief association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>Yidu: The county experienced months of continuous rain, and the embankments successively collapsed in many places. Countless fields, crops, people, and livestock were submerged.

<h3 id="e78">Chairman Jiang Sends Troops to Suppress Bandits in Anhui <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu: Yue Shengxuan, Commander of the 46th Division and Commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone for Communist Suppression in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region, recently received orders to suppress the communist bandits in western Anhui. He ordered various armies to cooperate with the county defense regiments to launch a comprehensive offensive against the communist bandits entrenched in the area, starting from August 25th at their respective locations. It is reported that after the armies crossed the river, the communist bandits retreated step by step. Many were killed or captured along the way. They have now reached the vicinity of Qingliang Temple. The communist bandits have built fortifications, hoping to resist stubbornly. The government troops are currently attacking fiercely, with intense artillery fire. The 4th Brigade of the County Defense Regiment, led by Quan Liting, pursued and killed many bandits in Wangjiawan, Shijia Ferry, Xin'anji, and Lijia Ferry on the west bank of the river, and seized two red flags. They are still searching and suppressing. Commander-in-Chief Jiang, believing that the communist bandits in western Anhui were rampant and that additional forces should be added to eliminate the bandits as soon as possible, specially ordered a brigade to be drawn from the 34th Division and sent to Liu'an, and the Zhang Jingxi Brigade of the 53rd Division to be sent to Huoshan and Qianshan to assist in the suppression. According to a certain source, the communist bandit Xiao Fang's false 12th Division was defeated by the [blank] army in the Liu-Huo area and fled to Ying Shan's eastern and western boundaries. The authorities have ordered the deployment of capable troops to intercept them. (31st)</p>

<h3 id="e79">Zhang Zhijiang Appeals on Behalf of Disaster Victims <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang is deeply concerned about the disaster victims and is anxiously planning relief efforts day and night. His telegram to Chairman Jiang and various charitable organizations across the country, appealing on behalf of the disaster victims, and the dispatch of personnel to the disaster area for rescue, have been reported previously. Two more telegrams that were recently obtained are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to Chairman Ye, which reads: Urgent. To Chairman Ye Chucang of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, my esteemed brother, by honorific salutation, according to a report from Brigade Commander Shi, more than ten breaches have occurred in the Shaobo River embankment in Jingri, and Shaoxian Town has been completely submerged. Furthermore, Gaoyou North also collapsed at 2:00 pm on the same day, and the entire city was submerged. It is impossible to investigate in detail the population and property losses in the vast expanse of water. The counties bordering Gaoyou, such as Xinghua, which are located at the bottom of the cauldron, have also suffered the same disaster, with countless losses of life and property, an unprecedented catastrophe, and extreme pain. I imagine that you have also received the news and share the same feelings. Currently, the affected people are crying out on the treetops, and corpses and debris are floating downstream, while the rest are dying in droves. In addition to the office dispatching personnel and vessels carrying dry food at night to make every effort to provide relief, these efforts are like a drop in the bucket and can hardly provide universal assistance. Please let us know what you are doing in your area. If there is anything that this office can do to assist, we will obey your orders without fail. A special telegram is sent for your guidance. Your younger brother, Zhang Zhijiang, bows in reverence. (2) Telegram to Shanghai, which reads: Urgent. To the Emergency Flood Relief Committee of Renji Hall on Yunnan Road in Shanghai, the Nanjing Disaster Relief Committee, and the Flood Disaster Relief Committees of all provinces, by honorific salutation, I trust that you are aware of the Jiangbei flood disaster, as mentioned in the previous telegram. According to Councilor Zhang Ruitang, who was dispatched by this office to Shaobo and Gaoyou to protect and rescue disaster victims, the area is flooded with vast expanses of water, and the disaster victims are crying out for food, a sight that cannot be borne. All villages have been submerged, with only the treetops exposed. Refugees are crouching on the treetops, urgently awaiting rescue. However, due to the rapid currents at the breaches, ships cannot reach them, causing great anxiety. The tragic situation of this flood disaster is truly unspeakable and unbearable. After hearing this news, my heart is filled with worry. For the sake of current relief efforts, we must prepare more ships, more food, and find ways to accommodate the refugees. The number of people who have already died cannot be counted, and there are still hundreds of thousands who are on the verge of death. Only the city gate tower of Xinghua County is exposed, and the rest is submerged. The disaster situation is even more severe in the counties below Xinghua. In addition to this office and the provincial government working together with local officials and gentry to make every effort to rescue disaster victims in the surrounding villages, I dare to ask your association to show great compassion and assist in the rescue. I await your urgent orders with utmost sincerity. Zhang Zhijiang bows in reverence.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Liu Guitang Flees to Liangshan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Shandong Troops and Militia Are Conducting a Joint Suppression</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan: After Liu Guitang broke through from Daming, he led his remnants into Shandong Province, passing through Guancheng, Fanxian, Puxian, and Yuncheng. Recently, he has taken refuge in Liangshan. In addition to government troops pursuing him, the militia of various counties along the way are also taking advantage of the situation to launch a joint attack. Liu's troops are fighting and retreating. Because he is very familiar with the terrain of the counties in western Shandong, he was ultimately able to flee to Liangshan. The pursuing troops currently include the 87th Brigade of Rong Guangxing, the 86th Brigade of Chen Dexin, and the cavalry brigade of Li Xuande. Gu Liangyou, the commander of the Western Shandong Militia, has also led his troops to join, gathering between Juye and Yuncheng to set up an encirclement. Gu Liangmin, commander of the 22nd Division, also went to the border between Juye and Yuncheng on the 27th to make arrangements before returning to Yanzhou. This morning (30th), he returned to Jinan from Yanzhou to report on the situation of Liu Guitang's troops. According to Gu, Liu Guitang's troops are hiding in the area south of Liangshan, numbering no more than five or six hundred. Currently, the main forces have gathered to block and intercept them, preventing them from fleeing elsewhere. The problem should not be too difficult to solve. Notorious local bandits in southern Shandong, such as Guo Maifeng, died of illness in Baiyan Village, south of Sishui County, a month ago. The remaining four to five hundred people are now operating in the Tianma Court and Budaigou area near Mount Meng. The 22nd Division and various independent battalions are stationed in Yanzhou. The 1st Regiment of Ning Chunxiao's 64th Brigade is stationed in Qufu, the 2nd Regiment of Lin Binghai's unit is stationed in Sishui, and Xie Shuxian's unit of the Southern Shandong Militia is stationed in Xintai, jointly carrying out the suppression. The cavalry brigade of the 15th Route Army, led by Ma Tengjiao, is stationed in Linyi, assisting in the suppression.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Mountainous Western Fangshan County in Shanxi Province Ravaged by Bandits <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Every Business and Household in the Entire County Looted Without Exception</p>
<p>Total Losses Amounting to Approximately One Million Three Hundred to Forty Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>According to Reports from County Representatives Appealing to the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Bandits are rampant in Fangshan County, and the people are suffering greatly. Recently, representatives of the entire county's villagers, three in total, were publicly elected to come to the province to report on the bandit disaster to the authorities and various legal organizations, and to request relief. The following is a general account:</p>
<p>▲The Actual Situation of the Ravage: It is found that Fangshan County is located in a remote corner of the west, where bandits can easily hide. The mountains overlap, and it is difficult to eliminate their lairs. Of the 22 main villages in the county, the main and auxiliary villages that were ravaged by bandits this time reached as many as 25. All substantial businesses and larger villages were completely looted, and even the mules and horses of the farmers were taken away, and more than 30 people were kidnapped.</p>
<p>▲Fleeing to the Wilderness: Currently, the people of the villages are supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing to the wilderness, sleeping in the open day and night, unable to return home, and unable to cultivate the fields. The county government's public security bureau has also been looted clean, and other businesses have all suffered damage.</p>
<p>▲The Fall of the City: Before the city fell, the bandits first looted in the Zhoujiagou area, numbering about seventy or eighty people. The local village chief immediately sent a "feather letter" to the county government. The county magistrate ordered the chief of the public security bureau to lead police to attack, but the chief of the public security bureau said that the police had been fighting bandits in Yukou for days and were exhausted, and could not set off immediately. Unexpectedly, at three o'clock that night, the bandits broke into the city and seized all the firearms of the county government and the public security bureau, and destroyed the prison, releasing all the prisoners.</p>
<p>▲The County Magistrate is Kidnapped: After the bandits destroyed the prison, they kidnapped the county magistrate, Hui Youfu, as well as county government personnel and tax collection officials, totaling twenty-five people. The bandits entered the city at three o'clock in the morning and did not leave until four o'clock in the afternoon. Throughout the day, they robbed, raped, and looted everything. It is also reported that the bandits seem to be organized. After looting, they split into several groups and fled in all directions. Moreover, the county has many mountains. After the bandits flee into the mountains, their movements are unpredictable. In addition to requesting the provincial government to order the bandit suppression army to thoroughly eliminate them, and because the autumn harvest has been ravaged by bandits, a disaster has occurred, they request prompt relief. The villagers' losses this time are very large, and the public losses are also not small. The finance bureau lost more than three hundred silver dollars, more than one thousand provincial paper dollars, and more than eight hundred yuan in lottery tickets in the bureau. The interest-bearing money in outside businesses is estimated at more than 13,000 yuan. The loss of equipment is estimated at more than 1,500 yuan. The loss of clothing of public officials in the bureau is estimated at more than 400 yuan. The first high school lost books, instruments, and other equipment, estimated at more than 1,500 yuan. The public security bureau lost equipment worth more than 1,200 yuan. The county party headquarters lost books and equipment, estimated at more than 1,000 yuan. Working comrades lost an estimated 700 yuan, plus 201 provincial dollars. The total loss for both public and private sectors is more than 1.1 million yuan. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Various Places Raise Funds to Help with Relief <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>▲Weihaiwei: Weihaiwei Public Security Bureau Chief Huang, Salt Affairs Bureau Chief Fei, and Li Yunqian of the YMCA, considering the water disasters in various provinces awaiting relief, specially convened a meeting of all sectors of Weibu at the YMCA on August 23 to discuss methods for relief. Many people attended, and it was decided to organize the Weihaiwei Various Provinces Water Disaster Emergency Relief Association. The inaugural meeting was held on the 25th, with 15 committee members, in order to conduct a large-scale fundraising campaign. Xu Yanmou, the Weihaiwei Management Commissioner, was elected as the chairman of the committee. Regarding fundraising methods, it has been decided to ask all amateur performers to perform for two days on September 5th and 6th, and to hold a dance and entertainment event for two days on September 12th and 13th. Donation booklets will also be printed and distributed to the countryside to quickly raise large sums of money to save the people.</p>
<p>▲Nagasaki: The Nagasaki branch of the Kuomintang recently joined the Consulate in Nagasaki to invite representatives of various organizations in Nagasaki to hold a joint meeting on August 25 to discuss disaster relief methods. It was unanimously decided to organize the "Nagasaki Overseas Chinese Various Provinces Water Disaster Relief Fundraising Association". The organization method includes five sections: general affairs, accounting, fundraising, publicity, and documentation. The representative assembly elected five fundraisers, each serving concurrently as the director of each section. A fundraising notice was printed and distributed, and the fundraisers went door-to-door to solicit donations from the overseas Chinese. It is reported that overseas Chinese are very enthusiastic about donating money for disaster relief, and it is estimated that several thousand yuan can be collected, which is enough to show the overseas Chinese's concern for their motherland.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Quick News from Wuhu <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Hong Jiong, the special commissioner sent by the central government to Anhui to inspect the water disaster, and engineer Chen Zhiding and investigators, arrived in Anhui a few days ago and consulted with the provincial government to divide into five groups for investigation. The construction department also added one member to each group for joint investigation, as a standard for the central government and the provincial government to handle industrial reconstruction in the future. The committee members of each group have already departed from Anqing on the 27th. Central Committee member Qian Danwu and Provincial Committee member Wen Yi arrived in Wuhu today to first investigate the Wuhu disaster in detail, and then proceed to various counties in southern Anhui.</p>
<p>▲Since its establishment, the Wuhu Water Disaster Relief Association has raised more than 48,800 yuan for relief. The Wudangfan Five County Righteous Relief Association previously publicly elected Mr. Zhai Zhanzheng to go to Beijing and Shanghai to raise funds. He returned to Wuhu yesterday and raised 40,000 yuan from various charitable organizations in Beijing and Shanghai. However, since the wind disaster the day before yesterday, the deaths and losses of the villagers in the townships have been even greater. County Magistrate Yu personally went to the townships yesterday to investigate. Some disaster victims were perched on trees calling for help, and the situation was particularly tragic. Relief is urgently needed. ▲Since Anhui banned rice exports, one party immediately carried out rice registration in order to prepare for the people's food supply. Unexpectedly, some unscrupulous merchants still took advantage of the name of military rice to smuggle it out, in large quantities. As a result of the registration, there are only 60,000 shi of rice in Wuhu, and the people's food has become panic-stricken. Therefore, the rice registration office decided to set up a rice export inspection office to strictly prohibit exports. Those who conceal and fail to register will be confiscated immediately and used as relief rice.</p>
<p>▲Since the major floods in southern Anhui, bandits have risen up. Residents of Wuhu's opposite Jiang Wuwei and other counties have fled completely. Even on the Wuhu River, bandit ships often block and rob travelers. Yesterday morning, the 171st Brigade Command stationed in Wuhu reported that bandits were taking boats across the river to rob. Therefore, a platoon of soldiers was dispatched, led by Deputy Officer Liu, to go by boat. They encountered the bandits in the heart of the river, and both sides opened fire for an hour. One bandit was injured on the spot, and five bandits were captured alive, along with a bandit ship and box guns. They were all escorted ashore and executed by firing squad on the Jianggan River. The brigade headquarters issued a notice announcing the process of suppressing the bandits.</p>
<p>▲The Datong Chamber of Commerce went on strike due to a conflict with the police. Huang Deji, the former chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, is still in custody. Huang is a graduate of Jindai University. He runs Qinghehao in Datong. Recently, due to the flood, he took refuge in a Jiangnan hotel. He witnessed the Public Security Bureau forcing the collection of opium lamp donations at the hotel. Huang came forward to dissuade him, which led to his detention. In order to rescue Huang, the business community eventually went on strike. The Chamber of Commerce has now submitted a report to the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce, which will be forwarded to the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, requesting a thorough investigation to comfort public opinion.

They received 805 yuan. At around 8:00 pm the day before yesterday (31st), a sampan suddenly came, and two bandits jumped out, their faces smeared with black ash, holding flashlights and sharp knives. At that time, the boatmen Zhu Jinfu brothers had gone ashore to bathe. Only Zhu's wife, Wang, and their children were left on the boat.

<p>County Magistrate Peng Strictly Interrogates Impersonators of the Recruitment Committee: Li Lianhong and others reported on the 30th to the Changshou Protection Corps in District 9 that they opened a noodle shop and hired a boat to transport more than 100 shi of wheat to a flour factory in Wuxi to exchange for flour. When they traveled to Xumao, a small boat blocked them, and five people in uniform jumped out, claiming to be members of the sixth group of the recruitment committee of the Headquarters Military Police Department. They were pulled to Tongzhou and the boatman Li Xiji was searched and lost four yuan and 1,250 yuan. The passenger Chen Jiuji was searched and lost one yuan. Upon receiving the report, Coach Sun Jingkun led the team members and brought the seven people in uniform, one orderly, one plainclothes, three boatmen, and three passengers to the Corps headquarters. The armed men refused to reveal their real names. They were immediately escorted to the county in the afternoon and temporarily detained in the Public Security Bureau. The County Government telegraphed the headquarters to inquire. (31st) A reply telegram was received stating that there were no recruitment committee members with gold badges, etc., in this office. It was obvious that they were impersonators and should be interrogated strictly and dealt with according to the law. In the afternoon, County Magistrate Peng interrogated the suspects. Li Lianhong, Li Xiji, Chen Jiuji, and others testified about the suffering they had endured. The armed men, named Jin Biao (style name Changfu, Dantu native), were ordered by Wei Pei, the director of the sixth group of the Headquarters Military Police Department, to recruit soldiers in the Xicheng area. He, the director, did not admit to disturbing the people in the countryside. Lü Deshan, Kong Fanrong, Jiang Deyu, and Lu Yunzhang all claimed to be recruiting soldiers to Cheng. Wang Yipeng claimed to be a shoemaker living in Longchangli, East Gate, Wuxi. His brother, Jingwang, was pulled to be an orderly. Wan Ziwu claimed to be a tailor living in Ttongtongli, East Outer Wuxi, and was forced to become a soldier. Chen Tongbao claimed to be rowing a boat in Yanqiao and was forced to row to Changshou. After the interrogation, Li Xiji, Chen Tongbao, and the other four were ordered to return home and await summons. Jin Biao and others were separately detained. All weapons and symbols were filed in the case. During the interrogation, Cao Yuliang, the town chief of Yunting, reported that Yu Sating brought Lu Yunzhang's name card to the township on August 9, ate snacks at a dim sum shop, and refused to pay more than 3,000 yuan. He also forcibly pulled farmers Meng Ziquan and Li Minglang to become soldiers in Kongjia Village. After County Magistrate Peng strictly interrogated them, Yu and Lu both refused to confess. Li Xiji and others pointed out that Jiang Deyu and Lü Deshan searched their pockets and took away silver dollars. How to handle this case must be submitted to the headquarters for approval.</p>

<p>Refugees Harass Townships: Several hundred refugees from Shangjiang Ganxiang have arrived in Shanghe Shop in the third district of Xiaoshan in recent days. They have been extorting money from door to door, and if they are not satisfied, they smash tables and beat doors, behaving like bandits. The local gentry and people have lost more than 500 yuan. Fortunately, the local Public Security Bureau sent police to suppress them, and there was no major disaster. Unexpectedly, on the 29th, more than a hundred refugees from Hunan also arrived in Shexiao Town and forcibly demanded food and accommodation expenses from the village committee. Their actions were barbaric, and the residents also lost tens or hundreds of yuan. Fortunately, the local water police suppressed them and drove them out of the country.</p>
<p>Situation of Wind and Rain Disaster in Nanxiang: Among the water disasters in Nanxiang, Xiaoshan, Changshan Township was the most severe.

<p>Dear Editor: In the article on Susong County in your newspaper on the 22nd of this month, "The town of Xixi was submerged in more than 200 villages," it stated that "the cause was the Lieshan Coal Mine dam blocking the water, causing the rivers in Zhonggu Village, Beigu Village, and Nangu Village to flood and have nowhere to return." It has been verified that the Zhu Ji Dam of our mine has been opened and dismantled every year in the autumn when the water rises to prevent floods and facilitate transportation. At the beginning of July this year, it was dismantled due to a sharp rise in river water. As for the Wangjiazhai Dam, it was washed away by the water on the night of July 5, and the villagers demolished it on behalf of the company on the same day. Our mine did not prohibit it. The Xixi flood occurred in August. Our mine's wells and coal piles were submerged, and most of the factory was destroyed, resulting in heavy losses. It has been a full month since the opening of the dam. Moreover, the water volume in the Sui River was already several feet higher than the dam surface in July. Even if the dam was not dismantled, it would have been washed away long ago. The cause of the Xixi flood was attributed to our mine's river dam, which is obviously not consistent with the facts. Please correct it, we would be very grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Future Focus of Vocational Education <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yang Weiyu</p>
<p>The failure of past education has become a common consensus. Since the Ministry of Education explicitly ordered the promotion of vocational education in April of this year, the atmosphere in the education sector has been refreshed. Since the National Congress determined the educational implementation plan to increase vocational schools as much as possible, the center of the education sector has undergone a major change. As of 1931, national school surveys and statistics are still unavailable. However, based on what is known in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai alone, the number of newly added vocational middle schools has reached more than fifty, and the number of ordinary middle schools that have added vocational subjects is not yet counted. If all twenty-eight provinces and directly governed cities are combined, the number must be very considerable. The development of vocational education can be said to be flourishing today. However, this is only a special expansion in appearance. If we investigate its essence, I am afraid it may not be so easy and fast. Therefore, the future focus of vocational education is definitely not on how to promote it, how to develop it, but on how to enrich it and how to adapt it. In other words, it is not about expanding the quantity, but about enriching the quality.</p>
<p>Today, the Ministry of Education is gathering experts and relevant representatives from various departments to discuss various issues of vocational education and make a comprehensive design. This is truly a fundamental plan and a matter of urgency. The promotion of vocational education in our country did not start today. Vocational schools are visible in various provinces, and vocational subjects are offered in senior high schools everywhere. However, most of the graduates are still not suitable for practical life, and graduates from schools are still unemployed in society. There is no other reason for this than that the settings are inappropriate, the objectives are uncertain, and the facilities lack standards. For the most part, they exist in name only and lack substance. Therefore, the statistical tables of schools in various provinces, cities, and counties show the number of vocational schools and vocational subjects in senior high schools, but the results are no different from those of ordinary schools. If this is taken as promoting vocational education, it is tantamount to destroying vocational education. Now that the Ministry of Education has seen this and has various designs, it is certainly very different from the previous lack of standards. The reason why I would like to add a word is that having a law is better than having no law, but a law that does not adapt to the environment and the times is also equivalent to having no law.</p>
<p>In recent months, I have often received information from comrades in various places, saying that when they wanted to run a middle school and applied for registration, the education departments ordered them to run vocational programs. Ordinary middle schools wanted to become vocational schools and generally set up accounting or horticulture elective courses. The departments then ordered them to reorganize into commerce or agriculture programs... The departments are implementing administrative orders and promoting vocational education, and their intentions are commendable. However, it is miserable for most school operators. Therefore, in order to comply with the orders, they have to reorganize and change subjects one after another, without having time to consider how to find a way out in the future or how to prepare now. In this situation, it is unlikely that they can avoid being nominal. Therefore, I believe that the Ministry of Education should at least pay attention to the following issues when stipulating the standards for vocational education facilities:</p>
<p>1. Adapt to the local environment and provide more opportunities for experimentation and research. The laws and regulations of education in European and American countries are certainly not without them, but they do not find it difficult to implement. Scholars should leave room for activities in each province to apply and opportunities to experiment.</p>
<p>2. Subdivide subjects in detail and be specific. There are several subjects in agriculture, and even more subjects in industry. Even commerce can be divided into several subjects. Allow school operators to freely set up subjects without affecting the standards.</p>
<p>3. Strictly define the standards for equipment. It is known to everyone that agricultural and industrial subjects should have appropriate equipment. Why is it different for commerce subjects? I have often heard that various provinces are eager to run vocational schools and run commerce subjects regardless of environmental needs, thinking that they are easy to set up. This is a fundamental mistake and should be regulated with standards.</p>
<p>4. Indicate the direction of career prospects. The greatest benefit of vocational schools is that they can provide career prospects. If, three years later, those who are now running vocational schools are still seeking career prospects and cannot find them, it will be a failure of vocational education. How to seek career prospects and how to broaden career prospects depends on the instructions of the designers of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>5. Stipulate the necessary conditions for establishing a school. The quality of a school depends not only on compliance with laws and regulations, but also on whether the organization is sound. When establishing a vocational school, it is advisable to investigate whether the establishment of subjects is appropriate, whether the equipment is complete, and whether the funding is sufficient. It would be very dangerous to take the compliance of its format as the standard for approval.</p>
<p>As for how to compile the curriculum and teaching materials, what are the standards for school facilities, etc., the designers have already considered them, so I will not repeat them.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the Zhejiang Education Department that although Hangzhou Private Hangxing Girls' Junior Middle School was approved for filing, the board of directors should raise a reliable fund separately: All submissions are noted. The school's request for filing is temporarily approved. However, half of the school's funding is donated by the board of directors, which is difficult to sustain. Moreover, the principal personally bears a huge amount of more than 2,000 yuan in expenses each year, which is not a permanent solution. In order to consolidate the school's foundation, the school's board of directors should raise a reliable fund separately to facilitate the school's operation. In addition, the vocational subjects in the curriculum should be assigned the five credits exceeded by the Chinese language subject. Please transfer the above points to be followed and reported.</p>

<p>Schools to Reopen with Reluctance on September 1st</p>
<p>The budget for Songjiang County schools for the 20th year has long been explicitly approved. Since Commissioner Xu came to Songjiang for investigation, the Education Department suddenly made major cuts again. Teachers and staff of county middle and primary schools organized a joint association of middle and primary school teachers and staff to strive for it and decided to postpone the opening of school to wait for a solution. The details have been recorded in detail in this newspaper. It is now known that the County Education Bureau repeatedly telegraphed to the provincial government for requests and went to the province to present the difficulties. The Education Department has expressed its approval. After the Director returned to Songjiang, he sent two letters to the teachers and staff, advising them to open school. The County Education Association also sent a public letter to the Joint Association, asking them to prioritize the studies of more than 20,000 students and open school first. The funding problem will be fought for, etc. After the Joint Association approved the letter, it held a general meeting on the 30th, and the majority decided to open school with reluctance on September 1st. The declaration is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Since the education funds of this county have been cut twice in the 19th year, the schools have been stretched to the limit. Considering the importance entrusted by the Education Bureau, the eager expectations of the people of the country, and the precious time and studies of 20,000 students, we dare not slack off, and we strive to maintain it in order to plant the foundation of the country and fulfill the obligations of the people. Unexpectedly, since investigator Xu came to Songjiang to investigate, the Education Department has greatly cut the education funds of this county. It is difficult to maintain even the current level, let alone develop it. Although we want to support it, we are more than willing but lack the strength. Therefore, we organized this association to strive for it. We have called for help through official documents and sought assistance from all sides. We are still afraid that it will not be enough, so we have expressed our intention to postpone the opening of school. The people of the country know that this move of this association is not an option, and they do not criticize us, but instead provide assistance. This is not only the private feeling of the colleagues, but also the blessing of Songjiang education. Previously, the Education Bureau, considering our difficulties, repeatedly telegraphed to the provincial government on both days, and the Education Department has agreed to maintain the approved budget, except that the funds for the senior departments of primary schools still need to be reduced. The Director also went to the province on the day to present the difficulties and asked to maintain the approved budget and send letters to all schools to open school on time to await further instructions. The Education Association also sent a letter to advise opening school first, and the funding problem will be fought for. This association is afraid of wasting the time and studies of 20,000 students, undermining the foundation of the country, and failing the good intentions and high expectations of the Education Bureau, the Education Association, and the people of the country. Although the original intention has not been fully realized and the solution has not been satisfactory, we dare not delay opening school on September 1st in order to avoid great slander. The funds for the senior departments of primary schools still need to be fought for to be exempt from reduction. We still hope that people from all walks of life will continue to lend a hand to achieve success. Please understand our private intentions.</p>

<p>The resignation of the principal of Suzhou Middle School has been recorded in the previous newspaper. Since this news came out, the Jiangsu education community has paid great attention to it. The students of Suzhou Middle School were panicked as if they had lost their loving mother. Zhang Yilin and other gentry, students, and parents in Suzhou jointly discussed and persuaded him to stay. On the one hand, they sent a telegram to Chairman Ye and Director Chen, saying, "Chairman Ye of Zhenjiang and Director Chen of the Education Department: Since Wang Diancun became the principal of Suzhou Middle School, he has achieved remarkable results and is the leader of middle schools in Jiangsu Province. The content is perfect and the academic style is good, which is obvious to everyone. At the beginning of the government's political training, promoting education is a very important plan. We heard that Principal Wang is said to resign, and we are terrified. Yilin and others have long believed in Principal Wang's enthusiasm for service and his experience, and you also consider it to be correct and trust him deeply. We earnestly ask you to retain him. If this matter is realized, then our Suzhou will wrongly bear the name of literature and history, which is of great importance. We hope that you will carefully consider the candidates for the successor in order to benefit the people of Suzhou. Not only Yilin and others are privately fortunate. Zhang Yilin, Bei Lita, Xu Xueji, Wang Guoxiang, Yang Yongqing, Wang Jiyu, Wang Shen, You Dunxin kowtow."</p>
<p>In addition, Wu Dezhang and more than 300 members of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association sent a letter to Wang, saying, "We are shocked to hear that you are resigning in the newspaper. If what is recorded is true, then Jiangsu education will lose its leader and there is a risk of disintegration. Please cancel your resignation." In addition, more than 100 alumni of the school, including Sun Benwen, sent a letter to Wang, saying, "After you leave, Suzhou education will sigh with emptiness. We are very concerned about who will be the successor." It is said that Wang's determination to leave is very firm, and the Education Department has approved his resignation. The candidates for the successor are attracting attention from all parties.</p>

<p>The Taixian County Middle School recently planned to add a rural normal school in the 20th year. However, due to the difficulty of educational funding, it is necessary to transfer part of the primary school education funding. The education sector, in view of the fact that the education funding is already very tight due to the downward flow of western water, and it is difficult to maintain primary schools, telegraphed the Education Department and the Education Bureau to temporarily postpone the establishment. The telegram said, "Taixian County Middle School will transfer primary school education funding to add a rural normal school in the 20th year. Now that the western water is flowing downwards and agricultural products are submerged, the county's educational funding is already very difficult. The most urgent primary school education is difficult to maintain, how can we expand and endanger basic education? We earnestly ask you to order a temporary postponement in order to maintain primary school education. We are eager to await your orders."</p>

<h3 id="e103">Zheng Hongnian Talks about Overseas Chinese Education and Academic Style <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>For new students entering the National Jinan University, in addition to filling out a form expressing absolute belief in the Three People's Principles and obedience to all school rules, Zheng Hongnian, a director and president of the university, gave a detailed speech on "Overseas Chinese Education and Academic Style" during the weekly memorial service in the morning, so that new students would have a clear understanding and understanding. His words are roughly as follows: "Our school has always been known as the highest institution of overseas Chinese. The so-called overseas Chinese education is because there are more than 8 million compatriots overseas, scattered all over the world. Wherever the sun shines, there is almost no place without them. The Republic of China is whole, and we cannot allow these more than 8 million compatriots to be barbarians and assimilated by others. Overseas Chinese education takes the Premier's restoration of the national spirit as its position. In the past, the Premier advocated revolution, and overseas Chinese sponsored it with their blood and sweat. Overseas Chinese worked hardest to build the Republic of China in the party song. Overseas Chinese are all over the world and are close to various ethnic groups. If mankind wants to achieve true peace and great unity, overseas Chinese education will train the elite vanguard team and aim to build great unity in the party song. The Premier's revolutionary goal is to seek freedom and equality for China, not to hinder the freedom and equality of others like imperialism, and to help small and weak nations to achieve freedom and equality for all mankind. The mission of overseas Chinese education is very important, the purpose is bright, and the meaning is broad. All young people who come to Jinan to study should understand this purpose in order to cultivate talents and become the backbone of the Republic of China. Jinan's students are lively and have a frank temperament, which is their characteristic. In the future, they should pay more attention to academicization, be pure and clean, reject political atmosphere, cultivate a beautiful academic style, and create a social and ethical center. Political talents in European and American countries have profound academic training. Young people should strive for academic achievements. Mr. Cai Yuanpei said that studying should not forget patriotism. I say that studying is patriotism and academics are governance. In the past, scholars liked to buy the Three Dynasties because they thought it was not good after the Three Dynasties. The reason is that academics were governance and governance was based on academics in the Three Dynasties. At that time, there was only a lack of science. Now that science is developed, it has not yet reached scientific omnipotence. In this process, society presents a kind of economic depression, which is very difficult. Each college and middle school department of Jinan University has research rooms. I hope that teachers and students will devote themselves to research, and not only catch up with new knowledge and new knowledge in science, but also make inventions and creations."</p>

<p>The Department of Education Adds a Normal Specialization</p>
<p>Jiangwan Fudan University opened on September 1st. Registration will begin today and tomorrow, and classes will officially start on the 7th. About 1,500 new and old students have enrolled. More than 30 professors have been newly hired in each department this semester, such as Chen Junde, a graduate of the University of London and Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, who was hired by the Department of Municipal Administration to teach Municipal Finance, Zhuang Bingquan, an engineer of Shanghai Kaiyi Company and a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the United States, to teach Municipal Engineering, Dai Junliang was hired by the Department of Law to teach General Theory of Debt Compilation, Xu Dongfu, editor and interviewer of the English Shanghai Times, was hired by the Department of Journalism to teach English Composition, He Ziheng, editor of International News and Qingguang of Shishi News, was hired to teach International Issues, Sun Lianggong, Director of the Chinese Literature Department, went to Japan for a tour, and Xie Liuyi, Director of the Journalism Department, was hired to serve concurrently as the director. Li Quanshi, Dean of the School of Business, and Wu Songgao, Dean of the School of Law, have all returned to the school this semester as full-time professors. Most of the graduates of the Department of Civil Engineering of the school have served in important engineering positions in the country, and many have been registered as industrial technicians in the Ministry of Industry. The school previously thought that the department was located in the School of Science, which was not very appropriate in name. It applied to the Ministry of Education to change its name to the School of Science and Technology. Now it has received Instruction No. 3359 from the Ministry of Education, which states that the Department of Civil Engineering of the school should be located in the School of Science and there is no need to change the name of the School of Science to the School of Science and Technology. In addition, the school has added a normal specialization in the Department of Education, which has been approved by the same instruction.</p>

<p>Registration Starts Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commercial Night School has been established for ten years and has achieved remarkable results. Now the school, in view of the urgent need for Chinese typing talents in the society and the lack of typing schools that can truly serve the society, has decided to add a Chinese typing class from the beginning of this quarter. Its purpose is purely to adapt to the needs of the society and cultivate Chinese typing professionals to provide a place for young people in the vocational world or out-of-school children to study. The 20th Standing Committee of the Association has resolved to start registration from the previous day. Anyone with a complete elementary school degree or equivalent can enroll. The subjects are divided into Chinese Typing Rules and Official Documents. The class time is from 6:45 AM to 8:45 AM every morning. The graduation period is four months (the internship time will be determined separately). The number of students is temporarily set at 40, and both men and women are accepted. A brochure is available, and it will be sent with a one-cent stamp. The teachers and instructors of the class have now hired Mr. Lin Zhenming and Ms. Wang Boying, outstanding graduates of the China Vocational Education Society, to be in charge, respectively. Mr. Zhou Xiuquan has also been hired to preside over all the affairs of the class. As for the official document teacher, we are currently looking for one.</p>

<p>Both Sides are Evenly Matched</p>
<p>Ping Gao Huimin Wins the First Singles</p>
<p>Tianjin Wu Shaoxiang Wins</p>
<p>Tianjin Wins the First Doubles Two to One Over Beijing</p>
<p>The Second Doubles Was Suspended Due to Darkness and Will be Played Again the Next Day On August 30th, Chinese and foreign tennis players from Tianjin and Beijing gathered at the British tennis court yesterday for the intercity competition. Chinese and foreign ladies and gentlemen went to watch one after another. Before 4:00, the stands were full of young men in suits and modern girls, exuding fragrance. Beijing players Yokota, Shi Changli and Tianjin players Uchida and Kuwahara arrived at the court first to practice. The doubles match started at 4:00. The result of the three-game match was that Beijing lost two to one. The second was the singles match between Ping Gao Huimin and Tianjin Wu Shaoxiang. After a long battle, Wu Shaoxiang was defeated 2-0. The third match was another doubles match. The Tianjin representatives were the Long Qian brothers, and the Ping representatives were the Sa brothers. Both sides were evenly matched. After a great battle of two hundred rounds, no winner was determined, and it was already dark, so the cadre of the court announced the end of the game. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e110">First Doubles <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Uchida Kuwahara (Tianjin) 6|4 4|6 6|4 Shi Changli Yokota (Beijing)</p>
<p>Three-quarters of the strong players on both sides are Japanese, and the remaining one is the veteran Shi Changli, who dominated Pingjin a few years ago. Before Lin Baohua and Wu Shaoxiang came to Tianjin, Shi had long held the position of leader of the alliance, and although he is old this year, he is still strong. In yesterday's battle, his strength was no less. His assistant, Mr. Yanchu, is young and energetic, very similar to Qingying player Yamada, who came to Tianjin earlier. The Tianjin player Kuwahara is brave and steady, and has gained a concrete understanding of Murakami. Before the battle, both sides were evenly matched and gained something. When the score was three to three, Tianjin's momentum suddenly increased and won two consecutive games. Beijing tried to resist urgently, but the effect was poor, and they lost 6 to 4. In the second set, Ping's team was still sluggish at the beginning. After the third game, Shi Changli's spirit suddenly rose, and his offense and defense were as he wished. He won three consecutive games and then won two games again, so he reversed the defeat with 4 to 6. In the third set, the two sides fought in a mixed battle for a long time, and the winner was not determined. Ping won three games at the beginning, and Tianjin retaliated. Afterwards, they came and went. Finally, Kuwahara's pressing ball was successful, and they won again with 4 to 6. The results are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e111">First Singles <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Gao Huimin (Ping) 6|4 7|5 Wu Shaoxiang (Tianjin)</p>
<p>Wu Shaoxiang hits the ball with his left hand with strength and strength. Gao Huimin is the first master in Beijing. He is tall and jade-like, and it is most convenient to press the ball. Recently, he has learned a skill and is good at winning with spin balls. The ball is light and powerless when hit, and it will float slightly when it hits the opponent's position, making it impossible for the other side to return it. If it is too far away from the formation, it is not easy to catch. It was quite effective at first, but was later seen through by Wu and was controlled instead. In the first set, Gao sailed smoothly and won three consecutive games. Wu quickly counterattacked and also won two games, but Gao's morale was in full swing and he finally lost with 6 to 4. In the second set, the two sides engaged in a short-range attack. Gao won three games at the beginning, and Wu tried to save the situation and also won three games. Later, the record was actually created as five to four. Wu won a set. Afterwards, Wu had a chance to win another ball, that is, to win the whole set. Unfortunately, the time was not right, and it passed quickly. In the end, he lost badly with 7 to 5.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Second Doubles <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Each Wins a Set and Will Fight Again the Next Day</p>
<p>When the second doubles entered the court, the sun was setting. The Sa Bentong and Sa Bentie brothers were short and sturdy, and their serves and hits seemed to be from the same model. Da Longqian and Er Longqian had a fat body and a tall and jade-like body, and their serves were special and no different. Among them, Da Longqian was the most stable, and Sa Bentie hit the ball quite forcefully. Sa Bentong was in good spirits when he met a happy event and also gave a good performance. After each winning a set, the game was not continued due to the darkness. If you want to know who will win in the end, wait for the decomposition the next day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the white team basketball team went to the siblings team court on Xinzha Road and played a friendly match with the siblings team. The strength of both sides was very strong. The siblings team had famous graduates from John's University, and the white team players were mostly rising stars. At the beginning of the battle, the siblings team had the upper hand, taking the lead with 27 to 26 in the first half. In the second half, the white team made every effort to counterattack, and the atmosphere on the court was also very tense. In the end, they came from behind with 43 to 42, which was also a close call.</p>

<p>The Wu County Residents' Amateur Athletics Preliminary Meeting was held yesterday morning at the sports field. Excluding those who temporarily withdrew, there were only eleven participants, but their spirit was not diminished. Two outstanding athletes, already well-regarded in our Suzhou, participated. One was Zhuang Mingzhen from the women's sports world, and the other was Zou Yingxian, who won first place in the 3000-meter race in the Suzhou Games. Although Zhuang Mingzhen did not take the top spot, her performance was still remarkable. Zou Yingxian's prowess remained undiminished, still ranking among the top in the 10,000-meter race with a time of 36 minutes and 3.5 seconds. Unfortunately, he is a student, so his name was not listed, and his score was not recorded. The results of each event are listed below: 100 meters: Huang Enmu, Cao Zidong, 13 and 2/5 seconds; 200 meters: Huang Enmu, 19 and 1/5 seconds; 400 meters: Lü Quansheng, 1 minute and 14 and 1/5 seconds; 800 meters: Xu Sibao, Sun Juying, 2 minutes and 46 and 4/5 seconds; 1500 meters: Sun Juying, Chen Liufeng, 5 minutes and 52 and 4/5 seconds; 10,000 meters: Wu Shaotang, 57 minutes and 54 and 1/5 seconds; 100-meter hurdles: Xu Sibao, 23 and 4/5 seconds; High jump: Gu Xichen, Hua Youwen (should be first), Zhao Shanda, Cao Zidong, 1.40 meters; Long jump: Gu Xichen, Zhao Shanda, 4.77 meters; Shot put: Zheng Guodong, 6.20 meters; Javelin: Zheng Guodong, 24.20 meters; Triple jump: Zhao Shanda, 9.96 meters; Pole vault: Huang Enmu, Cao Zidong, 2.14 meters. Although the results of this session are not particularly stunning, they show significant improvement compared to the first session. For example, the 400-meter and 800-meter events both exceeded the previous record. As for the tennis matches, they were held at the Suzhou Sports Field, with Jiang Zhende as the referee. The following players qualified as representatives of Wu County: Singles: Qian Su, Dong Qizhi; Doubles: Dong Qizhi, Feng Zhenxiang. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Singles: Feng Zhenxiang vs. Qian Su, 1:1; Dong Qizhi vs. Chen Yusheng, 0:2; Doubles: Feng Zhenxiang vs. Dong Qizhi vs. Chen Yusheng, Qian Su, 2:0.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Japanese Navy Abduction Case <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>City Government Submits Second Protest</p>
<p>Regarding the abduction case by the Japanese Navy that occurred on August 12th, the City Government submitted its second protest yesterday. The original letter stated that it was deeply regrettable that the letter of August 20th deflected responsibility for the Mayor's protest against the Japanese Navy soldiers' abduction and detention of Chinese citizens. It was noted that regarding the goods of Japanese merchants mistakenly seized during the recent public movement, the Mayor, upon receiving reports, had already ordered investigations and returns. He had also responsibly stated that if the public acted carelessly and endangered the lives and property of foreigners, he would certainly take legal action. When your Consul-General visited previously, he was informed face-to-face. However, during the process of handling the case by both sides, your country's Navy disregarded our country's measures and rashly abducted and detained Chinese citizens within Chinese territory, acting in a tyrannical and arbitrary manner. This clearly shows disrespect for our country's sovereignty and violation of international conventions. As for the claim that the Japanese Navy's actions were intended to assist public security and maintain order, this government has the responsibility to protect the lives and property of foreigners within its jurisdiction according to law and treaty, and it does not allow others to overstep their boundaries and act on its behalf. In light of the previous circumstances, we reiterate the previous situation and protest again, requesting that you investigate the previous letter promptly and provide a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Li Dezhao's Remarks on Suppressing the Communists <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Future is Very Optimistic</p>
<p>Li Dezhao, former Chief of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, has now been transferred to the Party and Government Committee of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters. He returned to Shanghai from Nanchang yesterday. Reporters from various newspapers visited the garrison headquarters to inquire, meeting Li shortly after entering. They inquired about the situation on the front lines. His conversation with reporters is recorded as follows: (Reporter) How is the situation of suppressing the bandits in Jiangxi? (Li) Since the Commander-in-Chief arrived in Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, the spirit of the various armies has been greatly enhanced, and they are invincible. Important bandit strongholds such as Guangchang, Ningdu, Xiaobu, Wangpi, Longgang, and Donggu Xingguo have been recovered one after another. The strength of the Red bandits has long been reduced by more than half. The remaining bandits have scattered in all directions. Currently, there are no substantial bandit forces in eastern and western Jiangxi. Only a small number of remnants remain near Xingguo and Ningdu in southern Jiangxi. However, they are also lurking in the mountains, afraid to emerge. When the National Army goes to suppress them, they flee through small paths. Even if airplanes drop bombs into the forest, they are willing to endure the sacrifice rather than escape. The reason why they cannot be completely eliminated for the time being is because of this. But this is a matter of time. It is said that the National Army's suppression of bandits is like a lion hunting a rabbit. Although the rabbit is cunning, it is surrounded on all sides, and its range of escape is extremely small. Eventually, it will be caught one day. The reason why previous bandit suppression efforts were ineffective was that various parties excessively promoted the Communists, saying how formidable they were, causing the army to be apprehensive and easily taken advantage of. In fact, the bandit army lacks pay and ammunition, and it lacks training. In every aspect, it is inferior to the National Army. If they were to fight on a plain, they would have been wiped out long ago. However, they have one advantage that the National Army does not have, that is, they dare to kill people to intimidate the people. As for the inconvenience of transportation, the National Army certainly feels the difficulty, but they are no different. The current headquarters is rushing to repair roads, starting construction in sections, and setting a deadline for completion. It is estimated that there are three road construction agencies in Jiangxi Province, namely the Provincial Government's Highway Bureau, the Military Road Bureau directly under the headquarters (using soldiers to build roads), and the Labor Relief Road Construction Bureau of the Party and Government Committee (using disaster victims to build roads). In the future, when the roads are completed, transportation will be convenient. The remaining Red bandits will either be beaten to death or starve to death. Therefore, the future of bandit suppression is very optimistic. (Reporter) How is the work of post-disaster relief in the bandit areas? (Li) The headquarters has established a Party and Government Committee. Forty-three of the eighty-one counties in Jiangxi have been designated as bandit suppression areas and are under its jurisdiction. They are further divided into nine districts, each with a district branch of the Party and Government Committee. Each county also has a county branch to handle post-recovery affairs in the recovered areas. Party and government affairs are under its control. The work of the Party and Government Committee can be divided into three parts: (1) Regarding Party affairs, planning and guiding the organization and activities of Party and mass organizations in the bandit suppression areas, propaganda, training, and other methods. Regarding civil self-defense, guiding and urging the implementation of the Baojia system in the bandit suppression areas, household registration, the reorganization and expansion of self-defense teams, and the recruitment of refugees for training and self-government. (3) Regarding disaster relief, planning for the relief of disaster victims in the bandit areas (currently divided into emergency relief, work relief, and agricultural relief), the reorganization of land and land taxes, the determination of property rights, and the restoration of rural areas (currently planning to establish farmers' banks and cooperatives). The above items have all been formulated by the respective departments and design committees, and personnel have been assigned as district commissioners and county magistrates to start work. (Reporter) How is Commander-in-Chief Chiang's activity in Jiangxi? Are some of the external rumors true? What is the purpose of this trip to Wuhan? (Li) The Commander-in-Chief is extremely busy handling military and political affairs. In addition to inspecting the front lines from time to time, he is always in the headquarters day and night and rarely goes out. Only at dusk does he go to the Guanao Pavilion behind the headquarters to rest. The pavilion is in the lake, and the scenery is quite good. Nanchang is hot and humid, and the headquarters is even more so. The Commander-in-Chief braves the summer heat on his expedition. The only thing he relies on for comfort is this pavilion. There are many rumors outside, and I only learned about them after leaving Nanchang. All of them are unfounded and cannot be believed. As for this trip to Wuhan, it is to inspect the floods. (Reporter) Has Chief of Staff Xiong's health recovered? Is it true that he will be appointed as the chairman of Jiangxi or a certain province? (Li) Xiong's injury has fully recovered. His right foot limps, but not as much as before. His spirit is excellent. He eats three bowls of brown rice for each meal. Because the headquarters is small, he rents a civilian house nearby. He goes to the headquarters at six o'clock every morning and only returns at eight o'clock, reading telegrams and writing notes. He has almost no spare time. He and the Commander-in-Chief are both extremely busy people. Now that he is the Chief of Staff, I am afraid he will not have time to take on the chairmanship. There is also this rumor in Nanchang, but it is not as prevalent as in Nanjing and Shanghai. I do not know if it is true. At this point, the reporter, feeling that Li had just arrived at the department, did not want to talk for too long, so he bid farewell and left. It is said that Li will return to Nanchang within days.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Disaster Relief from All Sectors Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>City-Run Disaster Relief Shelter Established</p>
<p>In recent days, there has been a considerable number of disaster victims from various provinces arriving in Shanghai. Coincidentally, the city-run shelter was also established yesterday, providing a temporary place for the disaster victims who narrowly escaped death. However, as the weather gradually turns cold, the threat of epidemics is concerning. Those handling relief efforts should pay close attention to hygiene and cold-weather equipment. Here is a summary of what was heard yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e119">News from the National Government Flood Relief Committee <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲ Solicitation by the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group</p>
<p>The Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, in order to prepare for the selection of personnel to work in the disaster areas, is soliciting physicians and nurses to volunteer to go to the various disaster areas to assist in medical relief, injections, and hygiene and epidemic prevention, for a minimum of two months. During the work period, the committee will provide living expenses and travel expenses, and may also provide salaries as appropriate. Those who are willing should state (1) qualifications, (2) age, (3) gender, (4) experience, (5) current position, and detailed address in their letters and send them to the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the Flood Relief Committee at 1 Jiujiang Road, Shanghai C. The group will then send separate letters of invitation to determine the overall deployment of work.</p>
<p>▲ Plan of the Disaster Area Work Group</p>
<p>The Disaster Area Work Group of the National Government Flood Relief Committee has drafted a work plan for the disaster areas for the committee's adoption. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) The Disaster Area Work Group shall dispatch representatives to all densely populated areas within the disaster areas to supervise all relief matters. For the convenience of handling affairs and improving work efficiency, these supervisors should liaise with local people to achieve cooperation. (2) The expenses required for the office work of the local disaster relief committees and accommodation will be planned by the respective committees locally, and the Flood Relief Committee will provide subsidies as necessary. (3) The local disaster relief supervisors shall cooperate with the local people to accommodate the disaster victims in temples and sheds. For those disaster victims who lack clothing and food, the supervisors shall plan for food and assist the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group in implementing the disaster area health plan. Priority should be given to hiring local disaster victims for construction projects such as building dikes and cleaning streets in the disaster areas. (4) Divide the disaster victims into two categories within the shortest possible time: (A) those who can find work and support themselves, and (B) those who cannot support themselves and need help. The disaster victims in category B will be moved by the committee to the planned work locations. (5) Organize engineers to supervise all post-disaster work. (6) When the post-disaster plan is complete and work can begin, the disaster area workers will be handed over to the engineers for use. (7) Post-disaster of farmland: (A) Plan how to distribute seeds and how to implement it. (B) Establish rural cooperatives to prepare for local bankers to lend money to farmers for the purchase of cattle, livestock, and agricultural tools.</p>
<p>▲ Zhu Qinglan Plans to Depart with Staff</p>
<p>It is reported that Zhu Qinglan, Director of the Disaster Area Work Group, plans to depart for the disaster areas in the next few days, accompanied by several staff members who have experience in relief and have cooperated with Zhu in the past, to select sites to organize model work areas. Their scope of work is the same as that of the work areas already established in Hankou. It is believed that after these personnel have gained sufficient experience in the model work areas, they will be sent to designated areas to be responsible for supervising relief work. It is believed that, with this method, relief work can be expected to spread to the disaster areas throughout the country in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>▲ Emergency Relief Association Cables to Various Provinces to Distribute Relief Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces telegraphed the governors of the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi and the provincial relief associations, saying that the fourth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Association resolved to allocate 20,000 yuan each to Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangsu for emergency relief, 10,000 yuan each to Jiangxi and Zhejiang, and 30,000 yuan to Henan. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao was publicly recommended to distribute the funds and has handed them over to the Relief Committees of your provinces for distribution. We hereby inform you by telegram. The Shanghai Fundraising Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces kowtows. In addition, the Anhui Compatriots Emergency Relief Association in Tianjin has previously raised 10,000 yuan for relief funds and remitted them to Shanghai to be distributed by Xu Shiying for emergency relief in the four counties of WuShou, Fengtai, and YingShang in northern Anhui. Xu Shiying has dispatched relief committee member Xu Guoyuan, accompanied by relief friends Li Qinlian and Zhou Xue 税, to carry the funds to Bengbu, convene representatives from the four counties, and distribute them in separate ways on the same day, and has telegraphed Shanghai and Tianjin to report.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Establishment of the Disaster Victim Shelter Office <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the office by uniting various sectors in this city to accommodate disaster victims, preparations have been actively made, and it has officially been established and started working yesterday. The first shelter in Liuying Road will be completed on the 4th and can accommodate more than 4,000 people. The various situations are recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>▲ Official Establishment</p>
<p>The Disaster Victim Shelter Office in this city was officially established yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at 293 Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, Nanshi.

Land has been found to accommodate the disaster victims. In addition to reporting to the municipal government for record-keeping, notices have been sent to various agencies, organizations, and newspapers for reference. (Telephone Nanshi 126, Chinese and foreign registered). Furthermore, this office does not send people to solicit donations outside. However, the disaster victims arriving in Shanghai are incompletely clothed and look haggard. The autumn wind is harsh, and the cold dew is chilling. If people from all walks of life are willing to donate food, clothing, and daily necessities, regardless of size or newness, as long as they do not compromise hygiene, they will be benefiting the disaster victims, and we will gratefully receive and distribute them on their behalf. As for disaster relief agencies and organizations, if they are willing to allocate funds to subsidize the shelter's expenses, please send them directly to this office, and receipts will be issued. At the end of the operation, the income and expenditure will be published in the newspaper to show good faith. This announcement is made by Wang Zhen, Director of the Shanghai Disaster Victim Shelter Office, and Deputy Directors Ye Huijun, Chen Xizeng, Hu Hongji, and Pan Gongzhan.</p>
<p>▲ Service Meeting</p>

The disaster victims in Shanghai are issued 20 cents per day per person for large rations and 10 cents for small rations.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Another Batch of Refugees Arrived Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, many refugees from provinces such as Jiangxi and Hubei have been brought in by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghua, Jiangda, and Jianguo ships. At 2:30 PM yesterday, another approximately 500 to 600 refugees from the three provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Anhui were brought in by the company's Jiangxin ship. After the ship docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf, more than 200 people went to visit relatives on their own. Those who had no relatives to rely on, after disembarking, raised the refugee flag and were led by officials from the Disaster Victim Shelter Office to the guild halls in the Xieqiao and Rihui Port area for accommodation.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Xinghua Disaster Victims Describe the Tragedy <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After the breaches of the embankments in the Gaoyou and Shaobo areas, the water level of the canal dropped sharply by five or six feet, rushing straight down to the lower reaches like a collapsing building. Xinghua, which is located at the bottom, suffered the most. Yesterday, some disaster victims from the county escaped to Shanghai. According to them, the water volume in the county has increased by another four feet. Villages within hundreds of miles around have been completely submerged. The treetops and the roofs of houses that were slightly above the water surface a few days ago have also been almost completely submerged. Young and strong people climb trees to wait for rescue, and most of the women and children have drowned. The entire city is flooded, and the county government, which is the highest point, is also three feet deep in water. In other low-lying areas, the water is higher than the eaves. Houses collapsing are heard every day. Dozens of sections of the city walls have been destroyed by the water, and the water and sky are connected outside the city. Cooking smoke has long ceased. People are continuing their lives in boats, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. All the remaining food has also been washed away and cannot be eaten anymore. The entire area is experiencing dangerous winds and waves, and transportation is blocked. The northern area, such as Zhongbao Ganggu, is particularly low-lying, and the water depth is estimated to be two zhang. Hundreds of thousands of households in that area may have already been buried in the bellies of fish. It is said that if the breaches in the canal embankments are not blocked early, the disaster situation in the county will never be alleviated.</p>
<h3 id="e123">NingShao Emergency Relief Association Meeting Today <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The NingShao Emergency Relief Association for the Hankou Disaster delivered 60 boxes of biscuits that had been prepared yesterday, a large item of Thunderstrike Powder (donated by the Morality Association), and 500 bags of flour and 71 boxes of bread entrusted by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association to the Yihua Company's Longhe ship for shipment to Hankou for distribution. It was also reported that the association received a telegram from Yin Huichang, the representative stationed in Hankou to handle relief efforts, requesting assistance from Hankou compatriots in setting up an epidemic prevention hospital. The relief team previously sent to Hankou escorted the disaster-stricken compatriots to Ningbo on the Yongxing ship on the 31st. The magistrate of Yin County, Chen Baolin, telegraphed that they were expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning to report on the situation. It has been decided that a meeting of all committee members will be convened at 4:00 PM on the 2nd of this month to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association's Disaster Relief Work <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association is deeply concerned about the severe disaster situation in Jiangbei. As the west wind begins to blow, the suffering</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>increases. In recent days, they have been separately appealing for donations in order to accumulate a substantial amount to remit to the local branches for distribution. Yesterday, the following donations were received: (1) Gong Yuan, the ceremonial money is used for relief. Gong Mojun's seventh son, Yuan 　jun, unfortunately passed away. On August 30, the relatives and friends sent more than 1,000 yuan in ceremonial money at the Guoren Temple. Gong Jun handed over the entire amount to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association to be used for the relief of flood-stricken people. (1) Huisheng Society generously donated a large amount of money. Mr. Zhou Weishi delivered 5,000 yuan donated by Huisheng Society yesterday to be used for the relief of local disaster victims. (1) Jintan Welfare Agriculture and Forestry Company sent 1,000 yuan yesterday to the association to be used for the flood disasters in various provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Jisheng Association Handles Disaster Relief in Various Provinces <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association separately publicly recommended relief directors to go to Hubei, southern Anhui, northern Anhui, Jiangsu, Huaiyin, Huaian, Siyang, and other places to distribute emergency relief. Now, Zhang Xianqing has also been publicly recommended to go to Gaoyou and Shaobo, the areas most severely affected by the disaster, with relief friends, carrying medicines, flour, and other items to handle emergency relief. In Henan Province, in areas such as Nanyang and Tanghe, the director of the local branch, Yao Chongbang, will also select areas for relief. In the Taicang area of Jiangsu Province, the three townships in the northwest area have been flooded, and the chairman of the Taicang branch, Zheng Chuheng, has been invited by the association to preside over relief work, which will be carried out separately.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association Telegraphs National Government for Disaster Relief <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai yesterday submitted a report to the National Government detailing the severe flooding in Sichuan Province. The report requested a large sum of money be allocated swiftly for disaster relief and that the Sichuan military forces be ordered to abolish exorbitant taxes levied in advance to alleviate the people's suffering. According to telegrams from various Sichuan people's organizations and representatives of the Sichuan Flood Relief Association in Shanghai, torrential rains began in Sichuan Province between July and August, causing the Tuo River, Min River, and Bei River basins to flood simultaneously. Other counties also experienced sudden mountain floods. The northern Sichuan region was relatively lightly affected, with only Santai, Suining, Yingshan, and other counties suffering the drowning of livestock, farmland, and houses, resulting in losses of tens of thousands in each. While the counties along the Fu River also suffered damage, it was not as severe as the aforementioned. In southern Sichuan, counties such as Rongjing, Weiyuan, Leshan, Gulin, and Yunlian in Shangnan were inundated by mountain floods, with water levels so high that one could wash their feet on top of the city walls. Houses and farmland were largely swept away, and the number of disaster victims reached more than half of the population in each of these counties. Ziyang, Zizhong, Neijiang, Fushun, Luzhou, Hejiang, and Yibin in Xianan, especially the first four counties, were almost entirely submerged by the Tuo River. Along the river for hundreds of miles, the water was seven to eight zhang (approximately 21 to 24 meters) high above ground level, drowning more than 10,000 people and submerging more than ten towns. The farmland and houses destroyed were beyond counting. The latter three counties, located in critical areas of the Min River, had both their urban and rural areas turned into swamps where boats could travel. The situation in Luzhou and Hejiang was particularly dire. In eastern Sichuan, Rongchang, Chongqing, Jiangbei Hechuan, Jiangjin in Shangdong and Wanxian, Kaixian, Fuling, Xiushan, Pengshui in Xiadong suffered flooding. Rongchang, Xiushan, and Pengshui were submerged by mountain floods, while the others were affected by the Yangtze River. According to the customs waterway reports, the Yangtze River flood reached a height of twelve zhang and several chi (approximately 36 to 39 meters), so the damage to humans, livestock, and houses can be imagined. Many families were completely wiped out, and entire villages were in ruins. In western Sichuan, areas from Beichuan, Anxian, Mianyang, and Maogong in the north to Chengdu, Jintang, and Jianyang in the south were flooded by rivers or streams. The ferocity of the floods was unprecedented in the past century. After the disaster, the price of rice soared to sixty or seventy yuan per shi (approximately 50 kg). Starving people were everywhere, and instances of cannibalism among the old and young occurred, highlighting the tragedy of human existence. In total, more than ninety counties in Sichuan Province were affected by the floods, with more than thirty of them severely affected. It is estimated that there are over one million helpless disaster victims. Although Chengdu and Chongqing have taken measures to provide relief, it is merely a drop in the bucket and does little to address the situation. The report requests the Association to raise funds for relief efforts and appeal to the central government. Upon hearing this, the Association was heartbroken. In addition to gathering the Sichuanese in Shanghai to raise funds and appealing to various charitable organizations for joint rescue efforts as an urgent measure, the Association noted that since spring, Sichuan Province has been experiencing drought conditions, and calls for grain relief have been widespread throughout the region. Now, the province has been hit by severe flooding, which has not only destroyed existing properties but also swept away the crops that were about to be harvested and the farmlands that were relied upon for survival. As the saying goes, "a house as empty as a bell," but now even the house is gone. As the saying goes, "not sure of tomorrow," but now not even sure of the morning. Given this situation, it is impossible to survive the year, let alone the day. Although the government Relief Committee allocated 10,000 yuan for emergency relief, this only amounts to one fen (one-hundredth of a yuan) per person for the million disaster victims, which is hardly enough to solve the urgent problem. The local authorities in Sichuan have also proposed relief measures, but they are essentially taking from the left hand to heal the right, which the people dare not accept. After repeated consideration, the Association earnestly requests the government to promptly order the Relief Committee and the Flood Relief Committee to consider the severity of the disaster in Sichuan, allocate more relief funds to Sichuan, or directly send personnel to the affected areas to provide relief, in order to save millions of disaster victims from death. This is the first request. The military warlords in Sichuan are notorious for exploiting the people through various means. For example, if one army has a bullet fee, another army will have a uniform fee, and a third army will have a straw sandal fee. They invent various pretexts to demand money from the people without any regard. As for the Likin tax, which the central government has explicitly abolished, they not only refuse to abolish it but also set up checkpoints everywhere, appearing several times in one li (approximately 500 meters). As for the advance levies, which the central government has explicitly prohibited, some collect taxes in advance until the 40s of the Republic era, and some require people to pay grain taxes monthly. The Anti-Opium Investigation Bureaus, which the central government has abolished, have been operating for years with remarkable results. There are also compulsory seedling donations, lazy donations, and monopoly fees for scales, inspection fees, and lamp and license fees. Under these harsh levies, how can the people not be impoverished? Now that the impoverished are further impoverished by floods, they cannot bear any more levies. Therefore, the Association cannot help but earnestly request the government to strictly order the military forces in Sichuan not to levy any more exorbitant taxes in order to save the remaining lives of the people. If they dare to disobey, the people should be allowed to file charges. This is the second request. All of the above reasons are hereby submitted to the government for review, verification, and instruction. Respectfully submitted to the National Government.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Meeting Minutes of the Jiangxi Emergency Relief Association <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jiangxi Emergency Relief Association held its eighth regular committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 PM. The attendees included Zhang Yuejun, Wen Lanting, Wang Peiyuan, Yu Qiaqing, Xiong Shihui's representative, Tang Yi, and others. Wen Lanting was elected as the chairman. Tang Yi reported on the recent situation of banditry and flooding in Jiangxi, as well as the relief efforts. He also conveyed Commander Xiong's hope that Shanghai would send additional relief workers to assist in supervision and promotion. After discussion, it was resolved to issue the following announcement in the name of the Association's Presidium: Since its establishment, the Association has been operating within the Red Cross for several months. Thanks to the generous support of philanthropists from all walks of life, significant achievements have been made. Recently, due to the urgent need for relief in various provinces affected by flooding, the Association's fundraising efforts have been temporarily suspended, which is regrettable. It has been found that the destruction caused by banditry in 43 counties in Jiangxi is even worse than that caused by flooding. The plan for providing relief to the bandit-affected areas is currently being designed by the Party and Government Committee, and General Commander Chiang Kai-shek is also making great efforts to ensure its success. It is a matter of national livelihood and the safety of the nation. The Association, having already made meager contributions as a support, should continue to work hard to achieve its original goal. Therefore, the regular committee has unanimously resolved that, starting from September 1st, it will resume normal operations within the Red Cross. It is hoped that all colleagues in the Association and benefactors from all walks of life will work together to achieve this goal.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Wheat Seed Issues in the Floods <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Opinions of Dr. Love of the United States</p>
<p>American Wheat is Unsuitable for Chinese Soil</p>
<p>Mis-planting American Wheat will be Inconceivable</p>
<p>Should Collect Existing Wheat Seeds Quickly</p>
<p>This year's floods in various provinces not only mean that most of the autumn harvest is hopeless, but the problem of wheat seeds will also cause panic, especially in the areas most affected by the floods. Because disaster victims lack food, most of the wheat seeds left are used for food. Therefore, after the flood recedes, wheat seeds will inevitably be scarce. It is now heard that the plan to provide relief to the flood victims will involve shipping a large amount of American wheat to China for use as food in the disaster areas. This is very good, but it is also suggested that American wheat, in addition to being used for food, should also be used for planting. According to Dr. Love, an agricultural advisor to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Chief Technician for Crop Improvement in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, American wheat is definitely not suitable for Chinese soil, especially in the areas most affected by floods in the Yangtze River basin, where the climate and soil are even more unsuitable. If American wheat is mistakenly used for planting, the consequences will be inconceivable and will inevitably cause an even greater panic about food next year. It is hoped that the organizations or personnel responsible for distributing American wheat to farmers in the future must earnestly guide the farmers to use it only for food and not to keep it for planting. Regarding the method of remedying the wheat seed shortage this year, it is hoped that the flood relief committee can promptly collect the wheat that still exists in the Yangtze River basin and exchange it for other food or money. After the flood recedes, the collected wheat seeds will be distributed to farmers for planting. This is the most important thing at the moment. A slight delay will result in countless wheat seeds being used by farmers to satisfy their hunger.</p>

<p>The Continental Times reports that the Shanghai Real Estate Association recently sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting that a Chinese person be hired to assist Mr. Hill, an American expert, in investigating the technical and business situation of the Shanghai Water Company. The Municipal Council has replied to the association, accepting its request. However, the selection of the candidate has not yet been announced as of yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Progress of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Wusong Office <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Re-soliciting Members</p>
<p>Relocating Office Address</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Wusong Branch Office of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, it was felt that it was difficult to handle matters. Therefore, a design committee was organized to facilitate business operations. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to 25 commercial leaders in Wusong, including Zhang Yuchi, Dong Fei, Yang Yuankang, Guo Shun, and Miao Binfu, to serve as design committee members. Zhang Yuchi was elected as the director of the office. Zhang, Dong, and others were all members of the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce, so the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce selected them for their familiarity. A few days ago, four committee members, including Dong Fei, Yang Yuankang, Miao Binfu, and Zhuang Shunlin, urged Zhang to take office immediately and discussed the methods. It is learned that Zhang and Dong have some opinions on the organizational law of the branch office. It is said that Wusong is a prosperous commercial area with a vast territory and frequent disputes. There are many foreign affairs involved. It is feared that it would be difficult for the director alone to handle everything. Therefore, it is proposed to request the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to hire two deputy directors to handle matters together, which would greatly facilitate the progress of various affairs. However, this matter is related to the future of commerce and is very important. It must be submitted for discussion at the next design committee meeting to decide whether it is appropriate. As the membership fees of the former Chamber of Commerce are different from the current regulations of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, it is also necessary to ask the design committee members to be responsible for re-soliciting them to comply with the regulations. It is heard that the original address of the former Chamber of Commerce is now insufficient for office use. Yesterday, Zhang, together with the acting director Sun Mingqi, surveyed a house on Ligui Lane and designated it as the branch office. It will be moved in for office use soon. Once the organization is in order and the director and committee members officially take office, the liquidation procedures of the former Chamber of Commerce will be handled.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Case of the Unauthorized Broadcasting Station of Guohua <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Continued Hearing Postponed</p>
<p>Guohua Electric Company, located at 418 Gongguan Road in the French Concession, was reported to the Ministry of Transportation by the International Telecommunications Bureau for disrupting international telecommunications and violating the telecommunications regulations by installing a wireless broadcasting station. The Ministry of Transportation notified the Administrative Department of the French Police Department, which submitted a request to the Second Special District Court on the 21st of last month to issue a search warrant. Chinese and Western detectives, together with Xu Zhuoyun, an official from the International Telecommunications Bureau, went to Guohua Electric Company to search and seized the equipment used for the wireless broadcasting station. The defendant hired Yan Xuanzhendong as his lawyer to defend him. Because Zhao Xudong, the manager of Guohua, did not appear in court, the hearing was postponed. The details have been recorded in the previous report. According to the manager of Guohua Electric Company, Guohua installed the wireless broadcasting station to develop its business and entertain the audience, broadcasting records, storytelling, and other programs every day, without any inappropriate behavior. On the 14th of last month, the company received a notice from the French Police Department to stop broadcasting and immediately dismantled the station. On the 19th, the company received another letter from the French Municipal Council stating that Guohua's radio waves were disrupting the telecommunications of neighboring radio stations and that broadcasting should be stopped immediately, otherwise a public prosecution would be filed. At that time, the broadcasting equipment had already been dismantled and stored in the warehouse. Xu Zhuoyun, an official from the International Telecommunications Bureau, together with police detectives, came to search on the afternoon of the 21st. When asked by the shop assistants, they replied that it had already been dismantled. Because the visitors did not believe them, they searched the broadcasting room and later seized the equipment used for the broadcasting station in the warehouse and took it away. The original hearing of the case was scheduled for yesterday morning. Zhao Xudong, the manager of Guohua Electric Company, and his lawyer appeared in court to await instructions. Because the procedures for the case were not yet complete, the continued hearing was postponed.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Pig Boat Overturned by Wind <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Four Crew Members Drowned</p>
<p>The pig boat Chen Changxing from Jiangbei, this time loaded with 157 live pigs from Renjiagang, was sailing to Shanghai, intending to meet the market demand for the Ghost Festival in the seventh lunar month. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, while passing near Liuhe, it encountered a sudden gale that broke the mast and sails. The boat drifted to the front of the Wusong Lion Grove Fort, where it ran aground on a hidden sandbar and capsized. All eight crew members and pig merchants, along with the live pigs, fell into the water. Four crew members, including Xu Er, Lu Da, and Zhang Waizui, drowned. The remaining four, pig merchant Liu Tong and crew members Zhang Tai, Du Gehuan, and Bao Peipei, managed to climb onto the ship's planks and drifted with the waves. Soldiers on watch at the fort spotted them and immediately reported to Commander Shi Ze, who dispatched six soldiers in a boat to rescue them. They were fortunate to be saved. The pig merchant and crew members then devised a plan to use the anchor chains of the overturned boat to secure it to the seawall south of the fort. They immediately telegraphed the pig boat owner, Chen Hengde. However, it was discovered that the iron anchor chain of the boat had been stolen the night before. The boat then drifted with the tide to Songkou, where it was discovered by the Fourth Squad of the Water Police. Yesterday, boat owner Chen arrived in Song, learned of the situation, and immediately reported it to the Fourth Squad, requesting that the thief of the anchor be apprehended and prosecuted.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Cartridge Cases and Bullets Found During Search on Wanzhu Street <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Second District, First Precinct, searched the Yu Fengtai Copper and Tin Shop on Wanzhu Street, as well as the Yong Fengyu Sock Shop on Luxiangyuan Road, and discovered cartridge cases mixed with bullets. This case has been transferred to the General Bureau for review, as reported yesterday. According to Station Chief Xu yesterday, the report that the station had subsequently searched the Yong Fengyu Sock Shop and found several sacks of bullets was a misrepresentation. He stated that what the station found in the sock shop were all the same type of cartridge cases and bullet tips, without gunpowder, and therefore posed no danger.</p>

<p>Xu Mengxiang Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Xu Mengxiang, a 55-year-old villager from Daxujiajiao in the eastern part of Pengpu Township, Zhabei, has a 25-year-old son named Kang Kang and an 81-year-old mother. The family of several people lives by farming. On the afternoon of the 30th, at around 5:00 PM, several young women from Jiangbei suddenly arrived in the village, gathering firewood everywhere. Villager Xu Ahai tried to stop them, but to no avail, leading to a verbal dispute. Xu Mengxiang and others stepped in to mediate, and the matter was temporarily settled. After a while, the Jiangbei women, feeling resentful, gathered more than a dozen vagrants from a nearby Xin Husi Factory workshop and swarmed back. One of the women pointed out Xu Mengxiang, who was then grabbed and subjected to a barrage of fists and kicks, with iron objects used to break two of his ribs, leaving him barely breathing. His son, Kang Kang, and another Xu were also injured in the waist and head. As the assailants were attempting to flee, a security patrol arrived on the scene, immediately apprehending four individuals and taking them to the regimental headquarters before handing them over to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. After a preliminary hearing by the district chief, the case was deemed serious and transferred to the local court for review the following morning. The injured were taken by family members to Baolong Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Xu's injuries were too severe and his life was in danger, while the other two were not seriously injured.</p>

<p>Gao Wubao Devoid of Conscience</p>
<p>Gao Qi's Life Hanging by a Thread</p>
<p>Gao Qi, an elderly woman from Tongzhou, is 78 years old and lives at No. 4, Lane 74, Xiaoputuo Bridge Street, outside Xiaonanmen in the Nanshi district. She has two sons. The elder, Gao Wubao, is 40 years old and works as a peddler. However, Wubao is addicted to gambling and has squandered all his meager earnings on gambling, both day and night. Over time, all the family's belongings have been pawned or sold. He has repeatedly borrowed from relatives and friends to no end, and is too embarrassed to borrow again, leaving him nearly destitute. He has long neglected his mother's livelihood. Fortunately, her younger son is able to provide for her. However, Wubao still frequently asks his mother and brother for money. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Wubao came home again and asked his sister-in-law, Wang, for a loan. Wang refused politely, as she had no money. However, Wubao cursed her. He then begged his mother for money, but she also refused. At this point, Wubao became enraged and immediately rushed into the bedroom, destroying his mother's bed and cursing her loudly. Qi became extremely angry upon hearing this and scolded him slightly. Wubao immediately lunged at her, grabbed her, and savagely beat her. Qi was old and weak and unable to resist, resulting in injuries all over her body and causing her to collapse to the ground, barely breathing. Gong Rongsheng, the watchman of the Eleventh Post in the area, heard the commotion and rushed over, immediately arresting the unfilial son Gao Wubao and taking him and his mother to the First Precinct, First Station. After a preliminary hearing by the station chief, he was found to have abused his parent, displaying a beastly nature. He was ordered to prepare a document for submission to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

They threatened everyone to be silent and stole a safe containing 60 silver dollars and 160 small silver coins before fleeing. Afterward, the restaurant manager reported the incident to the Second Precinct of the First District, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Records of the Pilotage Rights Case <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Selection Set for October 1st</p>
<p>28 Qualified Chinese Candidates</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Navy, and the Ministry of Communications advocated the recovery of foreign pilotage rights, the establishment of a management committee, and the holding of examinations to implement the transfer of pilotage rights and gradually reduce the number of foreign pilots. This matter has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the pilotage examination for all seaports has been centrally decided to take place in Shanghai on October 1st, with the Ministry of Navy responsible for the administration. The Ministry of Navy submitted a report to the Executive Yuan regarding the recovery of pilotage, outlining the reasons for China's loss of rights. It stated that seaport pilotage is the guide to a nation's gateway. All countries in the East and West have exclusive pilotage services for their own people, emphasizing the sovereignty of territory and people. Since China opened its ports to trade, most of the pilots at various ports have been foreigners. During the Sino-French War of 1884, French warships suddenly penetrated deep into the Min River, guided by an American pilot. The Chinese navy was unable to respond to this extraordinary event, resulting in a loss of troops. It was a painful lesson. At the time, the Qing government questioned the US government and requested that the American pilot be punished. The US Secretary of State replied that if there were a war between the US and France, an American pilot guiding an enemy of the US into US territory would be punished by law. Since this case, China has allowed Americans to serve as pilots in the Min River. During the Sino-French War, an American guided French warships into Chinese territory, but even though the pilot was captured, the US side did not punish him because there was no legal basis. Therefore, the employment of foreigners as pilots in China's seaports not only hinders sovereignty but also makes it difficult to cope in wartime and during periods of martial law, according to Article 3 of the martial law regulations. A fundamental solution should be sought to abolish foreign pilots. However, seaport pilotage is related to the safety of foreign warships entering the ports, and pilots must be proficient in navigation technology. For the sake of overall planning and preventing foreign threats, in addition to establishing a pilot training institute to reserve talent, the Ministry also collaborated with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications to draft pilotage management and examination regulations, totaling nine chapters and fifty-one articles, which were submitted for promulgation. The regulations stipulate the establishment of a management committee to place pilotage entirely under government control, so that more Chinese people can serve as pilots, the number of foreign pilots can be reduced day by day, and the goal of having all domestic seaport pilotage affairs entirely under the control of the Chinese people can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This pilotage examination is scheduled for October 1st at the Ministry of Navy's Pilotage Training Institute. There are 28 qualified candidates in China, all maritime professionals from the Shanghai Drivers' Association who have served as ship owners. It is reported that the Ministry of Navy, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Communications have stipulated the following qualifications for pilotage examination: (1) Citizen of the Republic of China; (2) Possess a certificate from a specialized school of navigation; (3) Have a proven record of service in the designated pilotage area; (4) Possess good character, sound health, and no addictions. The examination emphasizes vision, requiring 6/6 and 9/9 acuity and the ability to distinguish colors without error. Hearing must be able to distinguish ordinary conversation at a distance of six meters and be able to use the compass to change direction and determine the direction of travel. Candidates must be familiar with all navigation facilities and other maritime skills in the pilotage area.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pilotage Association strongly advocates that foreigners no longer participate in pilotage. The Ministry of Navy has replied, stating that the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Communications stipulated in the "Provisional Measures for Pilotage in Various Chinese Ports" in March of this year that seaport pilotage should be managed by the Customs. The Ministry objected to this regulation based on the principle of pilotage sovereignty and submitted a report to the Executive Yuan. The pilotage examination regulations were promulgated and implemented on May 3 of this year, and the examination has been scheduled. Since there are established laws to follow, there is no need to worry. As it concerns maritime defense, it should be carried out properly to appease the public.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Complete Suspension of Chinese Merchant Steamships <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>British Merchants Thriving</p>
<p>▲ Sanbei Line Completely Suspended: The Yangtze River ships of the Sanbei Company in Shanghai had excellent business after the boycott of Japanese goods. They transferred ships from the upper reaches to operate on the Yangtze River routes. However, since sending ships to Hankou to transport refugees from Ning Shao, the company received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications ordering all ships, including the Fulong, Xingshi, Changan, Dexing, Xin Ningxing, and Fuyang, to be transferred to the Ningxun section for transportation. As a result, the Yangtze River routes in Shanghai have been completely suspended. However, to meet the needs of passengers, shallow-water ships from the upper Yangtze River will be transferred to maintain some traffic.</p>
<p>▲ China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Suspends Sailings: Due to the recent floods in Hankou, the wharves and warehouses of all companies were submerged, except for those of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which were protected by levees built by Li Yunliang. Not only were passengers and cargo preserved from major damage, but the company also gained the favor of customers and enjoyed thriving business. However, due to urgent transportation needs, the Jiang'an, Jianghua, Jianguo, Jiangda, Jiangtian, Jiangyu, Kuaili, and Emei were sent to Jiujiang after unloading disaster victims in Shanghai. After consultation with the headquarters, the company agreed to retain the Jiangxin, Jiangshun, and Jiangjing to maintain commercial traffic and transport relief supplies on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>▲ Situation of Various Bureaus: The Ningshao Company continues to lease the Yongxing to the Ministry of Communications, while the Zhaoxing Company has agreed with the Shipping Association to send the Lianxing, which arrived in Shanghai from Yingkou, to Nanjing after unloading its cargo, to transport military supplies to Jiangxi. The Xiaochangjiang ships of Dada and Datong have also each sent one or two ships to Xun for duty.</p>
<p>▲ Rise of British Merchant Ships: Since the boycott, Chinese goods have been diverted from Japanese ships. With the recent suspension of Chinese Yangtze River ships, the Yangtze River business of Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson has greatly increased. The business of Heba Company has also been incorporated into these two companies, naturally increasing the volume of imports and exports. Jardine Matheson will take the opportunity to launch a special Shanghai-Changsha-Yichang express service every Wednesday and Saturday, starting this Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Measures for the First Land Reclamation in the Central District <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Measures for Party and Government Agency Staff to Acquire Land Also Decided</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's 189th Municipal Conference resolved the measures for the second land reclamation in the central area of Shanghai. Excerpts are as follows: (1) The reclamation area is defined as the land north of Sanmin Road, southeast of Zhanyin Road, southwest of the planned trunk road, and northwest of the administrative district (map omitted). (2) Land prices are divided into two types: 2,000 yuan and 2,500 yuan per mu. (3) Each household is limited to reclaiming one to four mu of land. (4) The start date for registration will be announced by the Land Bureau. (5) One month before the start of registration, the original landowners have priority to apply for the return of their land. Within 15 days after the start of registration, those reclaiming one mu of land can apply for registration with the Land Bureau and pay a deposit of 500 yuan per mu. (6) After the registration deadline for those reclaiming one mu of land, the Land Bureau will set a date to notify them to draw lots. Those who draw a lot for a certain district and number will receive land in that district and number. (7) After the registration of those reclaiming one mu of land, the Land Bureau will continue to process the registration of those reclaiming two mu or more of land. The registration and lottery dates will be announced separately. The land reclamation method is the same as for those reclaiming one mu of land. (8) If the land reclaimed under this item is within the designated commercial or residential area, all buildings should be compatible with the regulations of each area. (9) The building area in the commercial area shall not be less than two-tenths of the total area of the reclaimed land, and the building area in the residential area shall not be less than one-tenth of the total area of the reclaimed land. (10) Houses built in this reclamation area, whether shops or residences, are exempt from house tax for three years, calculated from the date of the start of land reclamation. (11) When the land reclaimed under this item is resold to others, it is exempt from transfer tax for five years, calculated from the date of issuance of the land license.</p>
<p>In addition, the measures for staff of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the various bureaus affiliated with the Municipal Government to acquire land in the central area of the city have also been resolved as follows: (1) The area for acquisition is defined as the land north of Xiangyin Road, southeast of the administrative district, and south and west of the park area (map omitted). (2) Staff of the Municipal Party Committee and the various bureaus of the Municipal Government who enjoy the right to acquire land in the central area of the city are limited to those whose offices are located in the central administrative district and who must reside in the central area of the city. (3) Staff members shall not acquire land in the name of others. If it is found that there is such a substitution, in addition to canceling the land acquisition, the deposit and land price paid shall be confiscated.

The deposit is temporarily set at 500 yuan per mu. (7) One month before the start of registration is the priority period for the original landowners to apply for the return of their land.

<h3 id="e150">Silk Factories Gradually Recover <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Situation After the Issuance of Public Bonds</p>
<p>Of the 106 silk factories in Shanghai, this spring, due to the poor sales of foreign silk, they suffered a severe setback, and their funds were completely depleted. They reduced the number of machines and stopped work one after another. After the new cocoons were released on the market, there was still no improvement in European sales. Only 36 silk factories in the city were barely able to start work. Now, because 4 million of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds have been issued since the 31st, silk merchants in Zhejiang and Wuxi have each obtained certificates signed and sealed by Qian Fenghao and Chu Huiseng, the chairmen of the silk factory trade associations in their respective areas, to claim the bond coupons they are entitled to from the Trust Department of the Shanghai Guohuo Bank (the commissioned issuer of the silk public bond fund). About 50-60% of the local manufacturers in this city have gone to apply for the bonds. The factories that have stopped work are now preparing to start work. The 36 silk factories that have started work previously reduced their work to half-days during the summer vacation. Now that autumn has arrived, they have all resumed full-day work yesterday. By around the 15th of this month, it is expected that 60-70% of the silk factories in Shanghai will have resumed operations.</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Unified Tax Bureau Announces That Goods Must Have Stamps Affixed After Tax Payment <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Otherwise, the Tax Owed Will Be Collected</p>
<p>The Unified Tax Bureau announced: In order to announce matters, it is found that the unified tax on imported cigarettes, cotton yarn, wheat flour, matches, and cement has been collected by the Customs. After paying the tax, merchants should take the second copy of the unified tax receipt, together with the original yellow declaration form signed by the customs officer, to this bureau or the local unified tax bureau office to submit it for verification, request personnel to supervise the affixing of stamps or fill out a tax ticket transportation permit, so that the goods can be shipped out and sold. The first copy of the unified tax form will be sent by the Customs to this bureau or the local unified tax agency at any time, and the amount of tax collected will be entered into the account for verification. This is a prescribed procedure and has long been implemented and complied with. However, it has been found recently that when marketing goods in the Shanghai area, merchants often do not comply with the prescribed procedures after paying the unified tax to the Customs, and they do not submit the second copy of the unified tax form held to the bureau for verification, request stamps, or clear the tax permit procedures, making it extremely difficult to verify and clear accounts in this bureau's books. Since this situation exists in Shanghai, it is feared that the provinces will also be unavoidable. This kind of violation of the regulations, arbitrarily delayed for a long time, should be clearly announced regarding the original restrictions on the period for requesting tax permits set by the former resident customs office, in order to comply with it. It is found that imported tobacco items from foreign countries in the past, after merchants paid taxes, should apply for stamps on the same day according to regulations. If the time limit is exceeded and the stamps are not reported, the stamps for that time, together with the tax receipt, will be invalid. This case has been stipulated for a long time and should be repeatedly warned and continue to be followed. Hereafter, after merchants pay the unified tax on the aforementioned imported goods, they should bring the second copy of the tax form to this bureau or the local unified tax bureau office within two weeks to report and request to exchange it for a stamp permit. Those with special circumstances who are unable to apply within the time limit are allowed to report in advance from the date of payment, with a deadline of one month at the latest, and no further extension will be allowed for the convenience of merchants. If the time limit is exceeded and the flower license is still not exchanged in accordance with the regulations, the original unified tax form should be invalidated. In the future, when goods are shipped or sold, the tax owed must be paid separately before the flower license can be issued to warn against fatigue and delay, and to show the restrictions. In addition to general circulation, this notice is issued to urge all merchants to comply. All goods that have not been exchanged for flower licenses should quickly bring the second copy of the tax form to report and receive stamps, or request to fill in a tax permit. Hereafter, all must comply with the time limit and not exceed the deadline and delay themselves, leading to supplementary tax payment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Business Tax has now been instructed by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to be reorganized and the county director of finance has been appointed as the director of the business tax bureau to be thoroughly reorganized. After being appointed, the director of finance Wang Huazhao obeyed the order and took over, reorganized and established the bureau on September 1 (yesterday). The former business tax office was abolished on the same day, and Cao Guanlan and others were appointed as tax collectors.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Heavy Taxes Levied on Goods Transported to Guangdong <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Notifies That Those Who Have Paid the Unified Tax Will Be Refunded</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday: We have received your telegram regarding the case of goods transported to Guangdong being subject to duplicate taxation. According to the principles of the unified tax, after goods are taxed and leave the factory, they can be transported freely without being subject to any further taxes or levies. However, since the political change in Guangdong Province, all goods that have been taxed in Shanghai and other places are being subject to heavy taxation when they arrive in Guangdong. In order to maintain the spirit of the unified tax and avoid merchants bearing double taxation, the Ministry has approved that for goods that have been subject to heavy taxation in Guangdong Province, merchants can present evidence and request the Unified Tax Bureau to refund the original taxes paid in Shanghai and other places. Therefore, goods transported from Shanghai and other places to Guangdong have not been taxed by this Ministry. If they are transported back to Shanghai or other unified tax areas from Guangdong Province, the tax owed must be paid. This is the way it is done everywhere. How can Zhao'an's port be any different? As for the taxes paid by merchants at Zhao'an's port, they can still refer to the precedent of the Unified Tax Bureau for tax refunds, present evidence, and request a refund from the Guangdong Provincial Tax Bureau. There is no loss to the merchants. The Zhao'an Chamber of Commerce has already presented this matter directly, and a reply has been issued tomorrow. Please investigate and comply.</p>

<p>Management Refuses to Rehire Striking Workers</p>
<p>The strike by workers in the Shanghai Western cuisine industry has been joined by Western chef workers, and it has been 21 days without resolution. The Social Bureau convened an inquiry yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to conduct mediation. Wu Shenxiang and Zhao Jinghua of the Western Cuisine Workers' Union, Liu Qiusun and Jiang Chunsheng (represented by Zhang Youjin) and Chen Lianfu (represented by Lin Zhenchuan) of the Western Cuisine Industry Association were summoned by the Special District Local Court. Mao Yun of the Municipal Party Committee attended as an observer. Zhang Shuye, Director of the Social Bureau, presided, and Jiang Shifu recorded. The director first asked the management why they refused to resume work and resisted attending. Then, the discussion began, but the management insisted on not allowing the striking workers to resume work. After the director repeatedly enlightened them, the management's attitude was quite tough, making it impossible to resolve the issue. The director announced that the formal mediation would be postponed and ordered Liu Qiusun, the representative of the management, to provide bail and be available at any time. The entire workforce was very angry when they heard this.</p>

<p>Ms. Tang Guanyu, wife of Director Pan of the Municipal Social Bureau, has recently been advised by her doctor to rest and recuperate due to her weak physical condition and inability to handle strenuous work. In addition to the affairs of the National Products Promotion Association, which are well underway, and the women's group of the Emergency Relief Association, which are related to fundraising and disaster relief and cannot be resigned, it is difficult for her to take on other burdensome positions in other organizations to avoid delaying matters.

<p>The organization of fellow-native associations should be handled in accordance with the currently revised organizational plan for people's associations. The Executive Committee of this city previously sent lawyer Huang Boshang to inquire, and a reply has been received as follows: (Respectfully, Upon reviewing the files taken over, regarding your lawyer's letter of July 25th inquiring whether the organization of fellow-native associations should follow the organizational procedures for vocational associations and requesting instructions, etc., we hereby reply that when the Organizational Plan for People's Associations was originally promulgated by the central government, it focused on vocational associations and was brief on social associations. However, at the same time, organizational procedures for social associations were promulgated and implemented to supplement the inadequacies of the plan. Now, the aforementioned organizational plan has been carefully revised and re-promulgated by the central government, and its content is suitable for various vocational and social associations without discrimination. The previously promulgated organizational procedures for social associations have also been abolished simultaneously. Therefore, the organization of all fellow-native associations, etc., should be handled in accordance with the methods prescribed in the currently revised Organizational Plan for People's Associations.

<h3 id="e162">Theft of Silver Dollars, Thief and Goods Apprehended <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Luo Heshi, an accountant from Guangdong at the Dehua Biscuit Company, No. 245 Zhaozhou Road in the South City, received more than 1,000 yuan in relief money the day before yesterday and handed it over to the boss for safekeeping. However, yesterday morning, the silver box was found to have been opened, and the silver dollars and accounts were missing. Only a footprint was left on the window sill. The company reported the incident to the Second District Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation. After investigation, detectives found that Zhang Zihong, a shop assistant, had taken leave and was suspected. They went to his home at No. 9 Situ Jin Temple in Caojiadu and found part of the stolen silver dollars. He confessed to the theft. Zhang Zihong and his wife, Wu, were taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Two Female Workers Gone Without a Trace <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Two Taixing People Are Suspected</p>
<p>Li Wanxi, a native of Yancheng residing in the workshop of the Shanghai Third Cotton Mill on Pingliang Road, his wife Zhang, 19 years old, and Qian Xiaolan, 17 years old, a relative of his fellow villager Shi Zengshou, were both female workers in the mill. They went to work at the factory at 6:00 PM on the 29th of last month, but neither returned home the next morning. People were sent out to search for them in all directions, but no information was found. The day before yesterday, it was learned that Fei Changhe and Chen Changfu, two Taixing people residing in a bungalow at the corner of Linqing Road and Jingzhou Road with no number, were related to the disappearance of Li Zhang and Qian Xiaolan. Yangshupu Police Station dispatched detective Zhang Degong to secretly investigate and arrested Fei and Chen at the address. They were taken into custody at the police station and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin's accusation, Chen Changfu confessed at the police station that on the evening of the 29th of last month, he saw Fei Changhe escorting Li Zhang and Qian Xiaolan on a tram to a certain place. According to Fei, Li Zhang had been having an affair with Chen Changhe for many years and had a special relationship. They were mutually shirking responsibility. It is requested that the case be postponed. Then, according to the victims Li Wanxi and Shi Zengshou, they stated the circumstances, and Li Wanxi also stated that he had not witnessed whether his wife Zhang had illicit affairs with Chen Changfu, but he had heard people say that they had opened a room and slept together in a certain hotel, but there was no conclusive evidence. When questioned, the two defendants were evasive and claimed that they did not know who had abducted Li Zhang and Qian Xiaolan. Please investigate. After Judge Shen Bingrong verified the confession, he ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>

<p>Without the Ability to Hire a Rickshaw</p>
<p>And Without a Destination</p>
<p>At 5:40 PM the other day, Wang Chunjiang, a policeman at post No. 24 of the Second Precinct, found a rickshaw with a boy about five or six years old sitting on it at Xiaoximen. He immediately asked the rickshaw puller where he had picked up the boy and where he was pulling him. According to the rickshaw puller, Tang Changyuan, the child got on the rickshaw on Shigaota Road and told him to pull him to Yuqingli. Since the rickshaw puller should not have taken the young child alone and had no destination, it was suspected that he was abducting the child. They were immediately detained. According to Zhang, the director, the child confessed that his name was Wang Genfu and he did not know his age, origin, or address. He only said that he got on the rickshaw on Baoshan Road and had no ability to hire a rickshaw. He was suspected of abduction and was to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for review.</p>

The fellow villagers in Shanghai feared that the embers would reignite and secretly planned to take further action, advocating strict supervision to prevent them from being taken advantage of again. Therefore, the history of Jiufeng and the achievements of the local gentry in protecting the mountain this time must be publicized in a timely manner to commemorate it.

<p>Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu Tan Hui (Talks by the Studio Owner Who Doesn't Remove Garden Weeds)</p>
<h3 id="e181">Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu (The Studio Owner Who Doesn't Remove Garden Weeds) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Several years ago, I saw a couplet written by Zeng Guofan. First, I looked at the lower line, which was: (Love to raise fish in pots to understand the mechanism of transformation). I didn't think much of it. Because the free world of fish is the river, the lake, the sea; where can't you understand their mechanism of transformation, why do you have to catch the lively fish into the pot? The pot is the fish's prison; the potted fish is a prisoner who has been put on shackles and tortured. Now, abandoning the greatness of the river, the lake, and the sea, and pursuing the mechanism of creation in a small prison-style pot is not only against nature but also shows the narrowness of the measure. I have always been against raising birds in cages, so I unconsciously developed a deep dissatisfaction with raising fish in pots. I took this dissatisfied attitude to look at the upper line. I saw the upper line wrote: (Don't remove the garden grass to keep business alive), I couldn't help but exclaim a few times, happy to forget all the dissatisfaction in my heart. From then on, I wanted to use this meaning to build a studio, calling it Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai (The Studio That Doesn't Remove Garden Weeds). But how can people who are eating breakfast worrying about dinner have extra money to build a house? Taking a step back, if the owner of the studio can't be made, why not be a Zhaifu (studio owner)? Okay, let's put it this way, forgive me for self-appointing the title of Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhaifu. People who need a Zhaifu, please see this name clearly; otherwise, if you want to remove the grass and I don't remove the grass, what will happen if it gets stiff?</p>
<h3 id="e182">An Account of Fang Bingling's Meritorious Pacification of the Japanese Pirates <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Liang</p>
<p>Jinshan is located in a remote coastal area. The local customs are simple and honest. Its old county seat was called Kangcheng, which is also the hometown of the former Nanjing Mayor, He Minhun. During the Jiajing period of the late Ming Dynasty, whenever there was a good harvest, Japanese pirates would cross the sea to harass the area at will. By the time the government troops arrived after hearing the news, they would have already looted their fill and left, treating the massacre of our people as a common occurrence. At that time, there was a local named Fang Bingling who lamented the unbridled actions of the Japanese pirates and was eager to find a way to suppress their arrogance. Therefore, he spent all his personal wealth to build a city wall as a defense. He also established local militia and set up defensive works such as bows and arrows in preparation for emergencies. Before several months had passed, the Japanese pirates arrived again and looted as before. Fang Gong then led the militia and fought them bravely. As soon as they engaged, the Japanese pirates were defeated and nearly half of them were captured. They were greatly frightened, knelt down, and begged to surrender. Fang Gong refused and annihilated them all. Thus, the Japanese pirate threat subsided. Subsequently, the matter was reported to the imperial court, and there was talk of a significant reward. However, before the honorable decree could be issued, Fang Gong suddenly died of a sudden illness. Once the news spread, there was shock and grief both above and below. The people of the county mourned him deeply, and some even wore mourning clothes for him, as they believed that without him, the area would have been devastated. Fang Gong sacrificed himself for the area, spending his family fortune to alleviate the disaster, displaying a truly awe-inspiring sense of righteousness, rarely matched in historical records. Subsequently, it was unanimously agreed that his virtues should not be forgotten. Therefore, they raised funds to build a temple to honor his spirit and inscribed his deeds on a stone tablet. More than three hundred years have passed since then, but the temple remains new. Sacrifices are offered every year without fail. Moreover, during the Ghost Festival in the lunar calendar, there is always a grand incense gathering. At that time, visitors come from near and far. Even wandering performers seek it out as if they were in great fear of missing it. For example, fortune tellers from Shanghai, such as Wu Jianguang and Ni Tianhong, all travel there without fear of hardship to pay their respects sincerely. Some say that Fang Gong was also one of their kind. Although the truth of this is uncertain, it is truly extraordinary for an ordinary person to receive such respect from later generations. I wonder if those who hold high positions and receive generous salaries today will be moved by this?</p>
<h3 id="e183">Research on the Clown Character <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Shifang</p>
<p>"Clown" is the name of a theatrical role, commonly known as "painted face." The performer uses humor and exaggeration, with every movement and gesture designed to make people laugh. As for the origin of the name, some say that during the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, people from all over the country came to court. The emperor ordered actors to imitate them in a play, hence the name "Chou Jiao" (clown role). " 儔 " and " 丑 " are homophones, so it was abbreviated to "丑" (chou). However, when I read the History of Ming, during the reign of Emperor Xianzong of the Ming Dynasty, the eunuch Wang Zhi colluded with Wang Yue and Chen Yue, forming a close-knit group that held immense power and aroused widespread resentment. There was a eunuch named A Chou who was skilled at humor and often performed short plays before the emperor, which often contained veiled criticism. One day, A Chou pretended to be drunk and behaved drunkenly. He first sent someone to announce, "An official has arrived!" He continued to curse and scold as before. Then it was announced, "The emperor has arrived!" He continued to curse and scold as before. When it was announced, "Eunuch Wang has arrived!" the drunk was immediately startled and became submissive. Someone nearby asked, "You are not afraid of the emperor's arrival, but you are afraid of Eunuch Wang. Why?" He replied, "I only know there is Eunuch Wang, but I do not know there is an emperor." Another day, he suddenly imitated Wang Zhi's attire, holding two axes and walking quickly. When asked why, he replied, "I am leading troops, and I rely on these two axes." When asked what the axes were called, he said, "Wang Yue and Chen Yue." The emperor smiled slightly. From then on, Wang Zhi's favor gradually declined, and he was soon dismissed. Later generations thought that A Chou could move the emperor and make him realize the truth, like Dongfang Shuo and Chun Yuyi of the Han dynasty. Therefore, they imitated him in plays and named the role after him, and thus the name "clown" was established. I do not know which of these two explanations is correct. In my opinion, the former explanation is far-fetched and contrived, while the latter is more credible and has evidence.</p>

<p>— (Juan)</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met a friend who has been immersed in the sea of love for twenty years. I do not know what stimulated him, but he said the following words to me. (I do not want to commit suicide alone. That death is too cowardly. I do not want to force my lover to die with me. That death is too despicable. If only I had a three-foot-long sword to travel the world and kill all the lovely women, eradicating the root of love, to prevent harm to young people and the ruination of their lives. Then, I would laugh heartily and die generously. But I do not have that ability. The last resort is to pray sincerely that a comet will collide with the Earth, shattering it into nothingness, so that men, women, sentient beings, and insentient beings can all perish together. Would not that be clean? Would not that be refreshing?)</p>
<h3 id="e185">Zheng Wuchang's Return from Rambling <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Lin</p>
<p>Zheng Wuchang of Sheng County is known for his poetry and painting. He is skilled in landscapes, flowers, and female figures. His landscape paintings are majestic and lush, with the influence of the Song and Yuan dynasties. Song Bolu, a senior official in Guanzhong, praised his collection of paintings highly. In May, Zheng Wuchang, at the invitation of his friend Zhao Xuequan (Guantao), the military commander, traveled to the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. He visited historical sites and explored secluded spots wherever he went, touring all the famous places of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. He returned to Shanghai a few days ago. I made an appointment to chat with him over tea. When asked about the contents of his travel bag, he smiled and said, "I have something." He then opened his suitcase and showed me two paper scrolls. One was a collection of seventy-nine sketches, all composed on the spot. Among them, the scenes such as "Crossing the Lion River," "Riding a Donkey at the Ferry," "Mysterious Moon in Wusheng," "Buddha's Hand Embracing Clouds," "Discussing Military Affairs at the Yellow Temple," and "Rain Blocking the Green Clouds" were particularly unique in their perspectives. The other was a collection of one hundred and thirty-four poems, titled "Spicy Grass" (borrowing from Xinwei). Most of them were works that commemorated ancient times on the spot. I love his poem "Staying at the Yuan Family's Mansion": "The warm sun shines through half the window, people wake up early, gentle breeze rustles through the tall willows, and birds sing." Tengwang Pavilion: "Autumn waters and sunset clouds, the land of talented scholars, beam clouds and curtain rain, the beautiful residence of officials." (The pavilion is now a water police station.) Traveling: "The stream and mountains often allow for spiritual excursions, poetry and wine gradually become estranged from the taste of travel." The Tomb of Bada Shanren: "A generation of rivers and mountains leaves behind ink plays, carelessly remember the wind and rain remembering crazy poems." A heart for patriotism is as bright as the moon, but there is no place to stand, only the blue of the clouds. The language is leisurely, and the thoughts are clear, making them enjoyable to savor. Zheng Wuchang, upon returning to Shanghai, lives a secluded life. Except for seeing two or three close friends, he avoids social engagements. It seems that he is deeply in debt with his paintings since the past three months. He is buried in writing and painting every day, sweating and painting until midnight before going to bed. However, his style is now more profound and robust than before.</p>

<p>— Ming Long</p>
<p>Since the previous torrential rains caused disaster in the capital, and floods inundated the area, the area outside Yijiang Gate in Xiaguan was a vast expanse of water due to its proximity to the Yangtze River. Traffic was suspended. The area outside Xingzhong Gate and along Jiangbian Avenue was also ankle-deep in water. Autumn waters were connected to the sky. The Four Elephants Bridge in Confucius Temple in the south of the city, and the Hongwu Street and Chengxian Street in the Four Archways in the north of the city, have been flooded for more than a month, and the situation has not subsided slightly. On the night of the 25th, the rain was heavy, and the wind was strong. The rivers and lakes rose sharply, and the floodwaters increased further. The people suffered calamity. Many places on Zhongshan Avenue were also flooded. Therefore, the Municipal Works Bureau has recently been hiring workers day and night on the sidewalks along Section 2 of the road to dig trenches and install water pipes to facilitate drainage and maintain road administration. Yesterday, workers in front of the First Police Station of the Daxing Palace excavated a large, ancient, mottled stone lion from the soil. About 500 steps away to the east (in front of the Eastern District Experimental School), another similar stone lion was excavated. It is said that they are one male and one female, similar to the lions in front of the National Government (also very close). However, it is impossible to investigate when they were submerged in the soil. The most interesting thing is that they both emerged from the soil at the same time without any prior agreement. It is truly a strange event.</p>

<p>— Ai Ai, sent from Tokyo</p>
<p>Seeing Ms. Kinue Hitomi's Love Letter</p>
<p>The death of Ms. Kinue Hitomi, the Japanese track and field prodigy who set the world's highest record, has already been reported in this newspaper. The death of such a vibrant and vigorous young woman has undoubtedly earned the tears of many sympathizers.</p>
<p>Among the 80 million Japanese men and women today, the only people known to the world besides Marshal Togo are Ms. Hitomi. Unexpectedly, the old man remains energetic as ever, while Ms. Hitomi has already passed away. This is truly a great loss to the Japanese sports world.</p>
<p>The news of Ms. Hitomi's premature death has spread throughout the world. The Women's International Athletic Federation held a memorial service for her in Paris. At the opening of the British local representative women's track and field sports meeting, everyone remained silent for one minute to pray for her. Women's and sports circles in Germany, the United States, Switzerland, and the Netherlands have sent telegrams to express their condolences. Zhang Xueliang, the young general and deputy commander who loves sports in our country, also sent a telegram to express his condolences. The number of wreaths given by all walks of life is countless. The Okayama City Education Association has prepared to build a bronze statue for Ms. Hitomi to commemorate this female hero. The 12th of this month was the day of Ms. Hitomi's funeral. More than 10,000 people went to help carry the coffin. Ms. Hitomi is truly the first woman to receive such mourning and honor.</p>
<p>Ms. Hitomi was still an engaged woman. In 1928, when Ms. Hitomi returned from the Ninth International Olympics in The Hague, Netherlands, there were rumors in society that Ms. Hitomi would marry a certain young man. But the result did not materialize. Many lads who admired Ms. Hitomi often wrote letters to Ms. Hitomi recommending themselves. But they were all rejected. At first, some people said that Ms. Hitomi already had another (dessert). (Dessert means sweetheart) However, the general public thought that this was a rumor made by disgruntled young people and could not believe it. Unexpectedly, after Ms. Hitomi's death, in her diary on her sickbed, a unfinished love letter was found. It was full of tenderness and sorrow. One can imagine that the heartbroken person must have been devastated when reading this letter.</p>
<p>(My G that I miss. I'm really bored. If I can't overcome the disease early and jump out of this prison-like hospital, I don't know when I can communicate freely with you. Wasn't that on Tuesday afternoon? Maybe it was on Monday afternoon. When I was in a daze, my nurse, Hanako, took a light green letter shell, wanting to step into my room. But she immediately received an indication from my mother sitting by my bed and withdrew.</p>
<p>The doctor rejected the guests who came to visit me. He didn't let me read all my friends' letters. Also, I was forbidden to write to any friend. They thought this was the only magic method to make the patient quiet. But they will never know that your letter is my more effective medicine.</p>
<p>I have been suffering from insomnia lately. The desolate moonlight last night shone on my window bars, causing me to recall last year. Recalling last year, we were talking deeply in a moonlit night. G, what a memorable night.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my sister came to Osaka from my hometown to see me. She is a virtuous wife and mother, with cute children and a sweet family. In her conversation, she seemed to feel sad for my life. It seemed that my life was too boring and lonely. But G, I am used to being lonely.</p>
<p>The above was written on May 25. Another ten days have passed. In these ten days, my illness has made good progress. The doctor said that according to the current situation, if there is no change, I can be discharged from the hospital by the end of June. Then we can meet in Tokyo at the end of July. July. July that I look forward to.</p>
<p>G. Have you ever gone home? I am so sorry. I often trouble you to worry about me. Now I am getting better soon. I will definitely get better. G, take care of yourself. You have to work hard.)</p>
<p>Confident that fame and fortune are my duty as a concubine, I will leave all my beauty for you to enjoy. Unexpectedly, good things take time. Now, it has become a proverb. This unposted suicide note is really good material for a sad love story.</p>

<h3 id="e188">A Husband's Wife (2) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>In recent times, the atmosphere in this house has only been tense, hazy, acrid, and indescribably sharp and discordant. The old harmony, happiness,</p>
<p>Sweetness, all gone. Every night, regardless of whether the northwest wind was blowing, it was raining or snowing, or it was very cold and there was no stove in the room, Mrs. Li always sat dully waiting for her husband to come home. She knew that she might find some needlework to do to relieve the loneliness, but the reality was often the opposite of the ideal. Because she was eagerly awaiting her husband, she took the scissors and cut the clothes, and maybe she would cut her pants. She should sew tight stitches, but maybe she would sew them sparsely, and even the needle would pierce her fingers, and she would not even realize that the fresh blood had stained her new clothes, so she simply did not do it, and simply sat dully, concentrating, listening, and paying attention to whether there were any vehicles or pedestrians outside the door. She was used to hearing her husband's footsteps and was very familiar with them, so the distant footsteps would often make her surprised and approach, and finally disappoint her. The pendulum of the clock swings so balanced and evenly to advance the time, it is very boring to listen to; the sound of the wind in the courtyard is like a lion's roar, hitting the building windows, shaking the house a little. In addition to resenting her husband for betraying the fragrant quilt, she was also worried about whether he was very safe outside.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Li's mind has been very unsettled, almost restless.</p>
<p>How could his wife not see it. He was often absent-minded, very silent, his smiles and words were several times fewer than usual, and his appetite also decreased. He was definitely not someone without something on his mind. Mrs. Li sat dully in the lonely cold night, often guessing the reason for her husband's changed attitude. Is it A? Is it B? Or is it C…D…E…? She thought carefully about each item, but could not get a definite answer; then she thought about whether she had done something, or whether that sentence made him feel unhappy? But she could not find the slightest trace that would make him feel so tired of the family. Among the many hypothetical questions, she was more sure that the cause of the love incident was the majority. So she thought about the impact of her husband falling in love with another woman. His body was weakened, his economy was tight, his family was broken, and all his prospects for advancement were hindered and stagnated. This is such a dangerous phenomenon! She was worried about the happiness of him and her now and in the future, and it was so precarious that her weak heart trembled almost to pieces.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Financial Gold Standard Trends Soft <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The attitude is dazed. Yesterday, September 1st, the gold standard continued to fall, with slight fluctuations. The psychology of the industry was dazed and uncertain. Both the front and back markets had six liang of number money review. In the end, it was slightly inferior to one liang zero to the silver market. It opened at a slightly lower level. Later, due to the variety of sellers and the apparent easing of foreign exchange, it weakened again and fell within 775 liang. However, as the exchange rate stabilized, the bank's appetite was not small. It has now pulled up three liang. However, there are occasional ups and downs, so it hovers between 76 and 77 liang. The buying side of the futures market is agile and suddenly broke through the 80 liang mark. Unexpectedly, it was a flash in the pan and immediately went down, because the Guang gang and various firms suddenly sold off, causing waves and a sharp drop of five liang. The situation was confusing and difficult to handle. In the end, it was still flat, but there was still a period of hovering.</p>
<p>▲The morning market hovers. The opening price for October was reduced by 5 qian to 777 liang and 5 qian. The largest strip was 1/16 to 1/8 longer. The silver market increased by 1/8, and private telegrams also increased by 1/8. However, US stocks fell by 2 yuan and 7 jiao zero. It has since been increased to 78 liang and 4 qian. Zhifeng Yong and others bought in. Later, Fuyu, Fuchang, Yuancheng, Yongtian, Fengyong, Qianchang, Xiang, etc. sold off, and the British gold was difficult to sell at 875. Then Mitsui ate 875 to 9375, so it shed 3 liang. The British gold announcement was not moved, and it was 75 liang and 3 qian at the time. At times it was added by 89 qian, and then Hengxing Yuan and others sold it off. Moreover, the near-term British gold banks mutually made 875 to 9375. People's hearts were weak, and it fell from 76 liang and 12 qian to 74 liang and 3 qian. Until around 10 o'clock, Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yongbing, and Xing came in, and HSBC bought nearly November British gold 875 to 9375, and each bank mutually made 875, and immediately added three liang to 10:15 to 77 liang and 4 qian. After entering, Hengxing and others sold off, especially Macgalli sold December British gold 9375, and immediately fell by two liang, and at 10:30 it was 75 liang and 6 qian. Cuichang Yongheng Yu and others came to buy, and Taiwan bought October 875, so it went up by two liang, and at 11:20 it was 7 liang and 8 qian. Soon after, the Indian exchange reported that the large two annas fell to 7 liang and 1 qian, and then added 78 qian, and then it was 7 liang and 3 qian, only a few qian up and down. The counter transactions were also sparse, and the noon closing was 7 liang and 6 qian, and it was made to 8 liang again. The listed price was still calculated at 810 liang and 6 qian, and the count was 345 liang, and later 36 liang to 33 liang.</p>
<p>▲A short-lived rise. The after-market opened at 78 liang, and then from 8 liang and 8 qian to 7 liang and 2 qian, it was the Indian exchange report, large two annas, but the forward was slightly one anna. The various firms had few remittances. It was not until more than 2:20 that activities began, because Yuanmao, Yongqian, Changxiang, Bingxing, Yuanxing, Yong, etc. had a strong desire to buy. Almost as soon as the British gold looked good, the banks mutually traded 10-month 8125, so they cheered up three or four liang. At 3 o'clock, it reached 81 liang. Surprisingly, the sellers took the opportunity to launch, such as Cuichang Yongheng Xing Daxing Yong Hongli Hengyu and other products Zhifeng Yong Dadecheng, etc. joined forces to sell, but the exchange rate was not too strong, and the Indian exchange telegram did not move, but the gold price turned down sharply, depreciating by more than five liang, and after 4 o'clock it was 75 liang and 7 qian. It was an unexpected twist, and it was really a restless state of mind, with this wavering. Suddenly, HSBC ate up 875 British gold, and the gold recovered more than one liang, counting 7 liang, 23 qian. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 76 liang and 8 qian, which was 2 liang and 2 qian lower than the previous day. According to the largest of the whole day, 81 liang, and the smallest, 74 liang and 3 qian, there was a difference of 6 liang and 7 qian.</p>
<p>▲The spot red is mediocre. The goods opened at 7 liang and a half in the morning market, closed at 7 liang and 8 qian at noon, 8 liang and 1 qian in the afternoon, and closed at 7 liang. The listed price was counted at 323 liang, and the account was 75 liang to 78 liang, and the make-up water was 75 liang, and 74 liang in the afternoon. The spot red strip was mediocre. Only Yingfeng Heng and others bought several hundred liang, counting 7 liang. However, the September public orders have now been settled according to the schedule. It is heard that a certain bank has taken in some, and those who settled it are the empty party Wu and others.</p>
<p>▲Small transactions. Also, there were no large tickets in the counter transactions of each firm. According to statistics, Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Cuichang Yong, Futai Heng, Bingxing, Yuanmao Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, Yifeng Yong, etc. all bought in. Fuyu Yuancheng Yong, Fuchang, Tianfeng Yong, Qianchang Xiang, etc. first went out and then came in. Hengxing Yuan sold a lot. Yuantai, Yuanchun, Yuanda Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Daxing Yong, and Tong Taichang had remittances from time to time. In the afternoon, Qianchang Xiang, Yuanmao Yong, Cuichang Yong, and Bingxing entered and then exited. Yuanxing Yong, Futai Heng, Yuan Kangxiang, and Wanxing all entered. Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Hengxing, Daxing Yong, Hongli, Zhenchang Xiang, and Yifeng Yong all exited. Yuantai, Yuanmao, Shunli, etc. had irregular exits and entrances. The Dalian gang remitted two or three hundred in total, and received five or six hundred in total. Because Dalian was closed, there were not many remittances. The Guang gang remitted two or three hundred strips.</p>

<p>Bond Market's Trend Towards Lull Lingers</p>

<h3 id="e195">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Leans Heavily Towards Downstream <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending downstream again. The slump in the overseas cotton yarn situation is particularly severe, leading to nervousness and a market decline. However, new sellers are not seen as being particularly active. Nevertheless, major players are still not taking steps to hedge, so the market is still stable. The forces of both buyers and sellers are exerting considerable pressure, and actual demand in the market is still being maintained. The Yunnan and Sichuan factions have not given up on their intentions, it is said.</p>
<p>▲Human Standard Falls by One or Two Taels At the opening of the human standard market, the sharp fall in American cotton caused popular sentiment to dissipate and the market situation to be particularly weak. Each month fell by one or two taels to one tael and one qian. In the afternoon, the price of Grade 3 yarn fell sharply, but the local market was not affected, and each month rose slightly by one or two qian. Transaction statistics totaled 17,700 bales. Enquiries revealed that 950 bales were bought from Yiyu, 550 bales from Tongyu, and 400 bales from Gongtai. Yu Da bought 600 bales, Rongxing 1,000 bales, and Yichang 550 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>November 152.71 0106,550 March 153.0</p>
<p>▲Yarn Sales Are Still Good Current yarn sales are still good. Enquiries reveal that total purchases by various factions for the day are 1,800 bales, with 170 bales traded among peers. Prices are flat. Among customers, 400 bales were shipped to Tianjin, 300 bales to Changsha, 350 bales to Sichuan, 520 bales to Yunnan, and 200 bales to other places, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Cotton Market Plunge Begins Abruptly <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market has suddenly weakened, and the plunge is severe, due to a significant drop in American cotton, causing panic. Many are closing out positions, and the market is increasingly weak. However, most major bullish players have not yet taken action, because the flooding is severe, and Hankou has suffered considerable damage. Therefore, the Hankou faction is instead buying long positions in Shanghai, so the local market situation is still robust. However, the global situation is still weakening, it is said.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Standard Plunges by Half a Tael At the opening of the Exchange's Hankou Standard market, the trend of falling American cotton caused nervousness, and selling pressure was stronger. Each month fell by four or five qian. The afternoon was flat. Transactions totaled 100,560 dan. Enquiries revealed that 2,000 dan were sold by Meiji, 1,800 dan by Jifeng, 2,200 dan by Taixing, 3,100 dan by Changhe, and 1,500 dan by Yuande. 2,600 dan were bought by Xinheng, 1,400 dan by Tongyu, 1,500 dan by Yongchang, 1,700 dan by Yiyu, 2,100 dan by Shenchang, and 2,300 bales by Zhenda.

<p>▲Foreign Cotton Mills Have Strong Appetite Local cotton trading has not seen improvement, while various foreign cotton mills are buying actively, and the selling prices are very cheap, so the market sentiment is increasingly weak.</p>

<p>▲American Cotton Headwinds Compete to Dump Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to sales by speculators, but later, due to improving weather and free dumping by short sellers, the market situation softened further. Futures fell by 25 to 26 points, and spot prices fell by 25 points. British cotton futures fell by 9 points, and spot prices fell by 3 points. Indian cotton weakened due to the sluggish Liverpool market price. Pingguoer fell by 2.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 1.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.75 rupees. Original telegrams recorded on the left (dated August 31st).</p>

<h3 id="e198">River Down Rice Market in Short Supply, Sales Active <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>▲Nanshi rice conditions were not very active yesterday. The River Down barge rice completely stopped at 5:00 PM. Changshu, Xixi North Japonica, and Su Tong gangs only had 10 units, which were all sold off. Prices rose by about one jiao compared to before. There is a lack of thin rice as a topping, and selling is relatively stable. There are not many reed ocean sharp rice, and prices are firm. New japonica is scarce, and the market shows a stable state. Bian Yuan's intention to sell goods is weak, and there are few supplies to meet the market.</p>
<p>▲Xinzha yesterday's weather was clear and sunny. There were not many thick japonica rice from Su Chang, and there was some sporadic sales. High and medium grades did not improve. Due to limited market conditions, stores are gradually raising prices, but they do not dare to buy too much. Thin rice such as Chonggu and Sisong is in short supply, and prices are shouted up by two jiao. The source of reed ocean sharp rice is sparse, and River Down and rice mills have a little inventory, so prices are increased by one and a half jiao. White yuan arrives and sells for a living. There is no rise or fall in the market. Western sources include Changshu, Liyang, Jiangyin, Qingpu, Sijing, Wangting, Luxu, etc. seventeen or eighteen numbers.</p>

<p>Re-imported Foreign Rice Continues to Rise</p>
<p>There were still no transactions in spot foreign rice yesterday. Re-imported futures rose because the production area reported a rise, and even telegrams were not replied to. Sentiment is good. 400 tons of small twist were offered, and the price rose by another two cents. Foreign telegrams: Anli immediately loads small twist at 7 taels; Chen Jilong loads small twist in October at 6 taels 7 qian 6 cents; large twist in October at 6 taels 3 qian 7 cents; Tianxiang No. 1 Saigon immediately loads at 7 taels 3 qian 3 cents. This year's Taizhou early rice harvest is very good. Shanghai merchants have ordered 50,000 bags, and Ningbo merchants have also placed orders. Yesterday, the first batch of over 4,000 bags of white rice and brown rice, etc., were loaded. 1,800 bags of white rice were sold at a price of 12 yuan 45 jiao, and 1,000 bags of brown rice were sold at a price of 11 yuan 05 fen. It is said that it was handled by this street.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Flour Market Lackluster <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month generally showed a flat and weak trend. The price of foreign wheat continued to decline for two consecutive days, by four or five jiao. The near-term price in Chicago was as low as four and a half jiao, the lowest new record for foreign wheat. This situation seems to be an implication of oversupply, so sentiment is very lackluster. A few major manufacturers also reduced their holdings. The price ratio for each month fell by about one fen compared to the end of the previous month. Until the opening in the afternoon, because the factory selling had stopped and domestic merchants were slightly active, the momentum for the near and distant futures slightly stabilized. February was the first time it was opened for auction, with an opening price of 2 taels 1 qian 7 fen 7 li half, and a closing price of only 5 li. As a result, September was down by 7 li half, October was down by 1 fen, and November to January were down by 7 li half, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Wheat Futures in a Sluggish State <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month generally showed a sluggish trend, because the price of foreign wheat continued to decline for several days, by four or five jiao. Therefore, market sentiment was quite weak, because the large batch of American relief wheat had been finalized, but the prices were still not good. It can be seen that the oversupply of American wheat cannot be stabilized for a while. Furthermore, there are rumors that more than 100,000 tons of Russian wheat are also being sold off as much as possible. If this is true, the future will inevitably change. As a result, this month is down by 2 fen compared to the end of the previous month, October is down by 3 fen, November is down by 2 fen, December and January are down by 1 fen. February opened at 4 taels 2 qian 2 fen, and there was no change at the close. Spot wheat was very quiet because the factory's appetite was very quiet. There were few transactions, with Liuhe wheat opening at 3 taels 7 qian 2 fen, Yangzhou wheat at 3 taels 7 qian 3 fen, and Pinghu wheat at 3 taels 6 qian half. A total of over 900 bales were handled by Fuxin and Fufeng, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Sugar Market: Swire Sugar's Allocation Plate Slightly More Active <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram: the current price of Cuban spot sugar is still 1.40625, the price of New York sugar futures is 1.32 in September, 1.30 in February, 1.34 in March next year, 1.40 in May; the price of Java spot sugar is 7.75, and the price of futures sugar in each month is 7.625, with no rise or fall compared to the previous telegram. The association's market allocation plate and Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white had particularly quiet transactions, and the price was still 11 taels 7 qian half. High-quality goods are called for 11 taels 8 qian. No. 20 medium sand white is 11 taels 1 qian, and demand is also scarce. Swire car sugar has relatively active transactions, B mark is 12 taels, there are not many buyers, DY mark is 11 taels 8 qian half to 3 fen 7 li half, HX mark is 11 taels 7 qian 7 fen half, new arrivals that cannot be sold immediately are 11 taels 7 qian half, HM mark is 11 taels 4 qian half, transactions are quite active, the market is firm and lively, and the numbered plate transactions are also quiet. Zhenxianghao offered over 1,000 bags of old goods, washed white bags of coarse sand white, at a price of 11 taels 6 qian half, and the market atmosphere is also flat and not unusual, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Piece Goods Cloth Market Still Falling <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market is still sluggish, because the floods in various regions are becoming more serious, and it is difficult to expect future progress, so those who hold goods are eagerly seeking to sell them off, causing the market to continue to decline. Yesterday, fine cloth was the weakest among cotton cloths. Japanese factory goods fell again by about 1 qian. Brands such as Laba Tong Caiqiu have fallen to a price of 7 taels 3 qian half. Blue Flying Fish is 7 taels 7 qian half. Chinese goods are also weak, Qiqiu is 7 taels 8 qian, and Renzhong is 7 taels 6 qian half. The trend of fine twill is slightly better, because the shipping of dyed cloth is still relatively active, Songshu is 7 taels 05 fen, Blue Shuangyu is 7 taels 2 qian 7 fen half, and Yanghe is 7 taels 3 qian 7 fen half. Chinese goods, such as the Yingqiu Feixiong brands, are all around 7 taels 6 qian. Among coarse cloths, 14-pound feeding horse is the hardest, requiring 7 taels 2 qian, and there is not much spot stock. 13-pound, 11-pound, and 9-pound have all fallen. Since the anti-Japanese movement, the sales of Eastern goods have greatly decreased, coupled with the severe flooding, which has made the situation even more sluggish. Recently, there is a sense that there is no day without a fall. Yesterday, Zhigong neizi fell again by 2 li half, Sijunzi was 3 qian 05 li, Lieyan was 3 qian 5 fen 2 li half, Moganshan was 3 qian 5 fen half, fine bibiji and Huxinting were 3 qian 2 fen 7 li half, Huanle was 3 qian 2 fen half, and the rest fell uniformly. Sales were slightly active in the Sichuan gang yesterday, it is said.</p>

<p>▲Bottom Stock Is Thin, Supply Does Not Meet Demand: Cocoon Merchants Hoard, Prices Continue to Rise This year, the spring and summer cocoons in various regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have all reported poor harvests, which are not enough for reeling. The market is becoming more and more stable. Recently, because silk public bonds have been issued, various silk factories are preparing to start work and are starting to replenish raw materials. Dry cocoon factories are enjoying prosperous advances, but the bottom stock is thin, and supply does not meet demand. Cocoon merchants are hoarding, and asking prices are getting higher and higher. Currently, the market price of self-reeled cocoons must be 820 to 30 taels, which is a sharp increase of 40 to 50 taels compared to before, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Luzhuang Zhenmei Has Active Sales and Rising Prices <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the foreign tea market in Shanghai, the Zhenmei green teas from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other regions, and the large foreign firms such as Yingzhuang Xiehe, Jinlong, Tongfu, and Dute, seeing that the market inventory was drying up and overseas demand was extremely urgent, increased prices to seek goods, and the market was unusually lively. Selling prices rose again by four or five taels. The Gongxi item is in demand by various English and Russian firms, and the market has also loosened slightly. The green tea market is showing an extremely firm trend, it is said.</p>
