<p>世界每月世界第二次大戰之恐慌。余則以爲其言未必盡然。其最大原因。蓋以世界而果現第二次之大戰者。則資本主義之國家。必將大受打擊。或且至於消滅。今日尚爲資本主義國家。執掌世權之時代。故無論如何互相傾軋。决不肯趨此同入危險之途。苟有一息之可以彌縫者必盡其力以彌之。而使世界大戰不至復起。此我對於世界大戰不至復起之根本觀念也。</p>
<p>是以當倫敦會議縮减海軍之時。余料其决不能各國之間。誠心誠意而有澈底之解决。然必有多少成就以維持目前之暫局。其後因法意之互不相讓。致五强國之海軍會議。成爲英美日三國協定。今以英相赴法赴意之故。而法意之爭執。似有通融餘地。雖其事今尚未能揭曉。而各國之不願於此時期。致有戰事。則固一望而可知也。</p>

<p>啻焉。其象高不盈尺。而整襟危坐。須眉生動。宛聞　欬。洵非神手。不能有此妙造。而呈斯化工也。</p>

<p>余往歲應同邑吳氏之聘。往北平課其子女。吳君名敬慈。號恒蓀。乃翁曾任北平匯豐銀行行長。故久家於彼。吳君嘗留學英倫。肄習工程學。歸國後曾任京奉路工程師。後以丁父艱歸里。因乃翁已富有蓄積。故不復出。性極好古。凡古董書畫。爲所收藏者甚多。古書亦其一也。其收買古書時。皆經李穆堂等諸前輩爲之鑒定。故絶不受人欺蒙。余在平時。有人以宋刻唐文粹及明版樓攻媿先生集求售。索價一萬元。後經李鑒定。竟如數與之。吳君以二書見示。余見文粹紙張甚黯淡。其天地頭及書腰亦不甚闊。至樓集則後數本已殘缺。以鈔本補足之。竊訝其價之過昂。然據李言。此一萬元僅敷文粹一書之値。若樓集則僅可作爲贈品而已。後又有人以宋刻李善注文選求售。索値六千元。余見其紙張潔白如新。版刻亦精好。以爲文粹之紙與版。皆不及此。尚値萬金。則此索六千元。當不爲貴。迨經李鑒别。則謂此書雖佳。但海内藏之者尚多。若前所購之唐文粹。則據彼所知。恐國内已僅存此一部。卽海源閣藏書。號稱極博。然亦不見其有此書。余於是歎鑒别古書。亦非易易。苟非海内現存之書。確知其實數。卽不能斷定其價値。而此文粹一書之可寳貴。於此益見。余因感於楊氏之事。特著此篇。願吳君及其子孫善守護之。爲吾國保存國粹之一部分也。</p>

<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>葉桐侯把花元春拉到了後面的一個亭子間裏。說道老六。剛纔聽你說盤纒錢也要想法子的話。你此番的川資夠不夠呢。老六道。我正在想法子。大概小姊妹那裏總可以通融一些。葉桐侯道。你要多少呢。老六道。一到北京。就可以向大肚皮阿金拿。就不過路上的盤費。有兩三百塊錢是儘夠的了。葉桐侯道。那末我這裏拿好了。或者帶點南邊的吃食東西送送人。你先拿一百塊錢去。還有兩百塊錢。我明天晚上送來。老六道。不好的。三少。我怎麽可以無缘無故的拿你的錢呢。你到了北京多照應我一點就是咯。我已經和新嫂嫂說了。託伊借三百塊錢。利息不過是四分錢。好在我到了北京。就可以想法了寄還他們的。葉桐侯道。何必呢。我不久就到北京來了。你不能到北京還我嗎。要不然。就是你不願意用我的錢。你要知道。我是並没有一種别的心思呢。花老六道。三少。你這樣的待我好。我那能不感激你。旣然如此。省得我别處去想法子了。總怪我老六自己嘸淸頭。忒嫌胡調。我此番到北京去。倘然再弄不好。我就死在北京。不再回南邊來了。葉桐侯道。老六。你也何必說那樣斷頭話。人生遲早。終歸一死。死是人人所必經的一條路。死在北京。和死在上海。有什麽分别。一個人就同一隻鳥一般。飛到那裏。就　在那裏。忽然的死神來了。也只好跟了他走。你說死在北京。安知我葉三不死在北京。我們革命黨人。看得死是無足輕重。壽長的人。不過像任旅館一樣。多住幾天。還有那種庸庸碌碌的人。他好像在世界上。白白地來白相了一回。花元春道。我們做女人的。更要早一點死。我想做老太婆是。趣得很。說得葉桐侯笑起來了。到了明天晚上。葉桐侯又送了二百塊錢來。這是個雪中送炭的勾當。花元春當然十分感激葉三。省得再向别處想法了。其實老六剛纔說託了新嫂嫂的話。也是在自己懸想中。花老六是胡調健將。人家對於伊的借欵。總有一點懷疑。好像好班軍閥中的借外債一般。縱然說得好聽。什麽實業借欵。金融借欵。只要錢一到手。便送到不知那裏去了。所以非要切實擔保品不可。花老六的借欵。就同軍閥借欵一樣。而且人又不在上海。新嫂嫂那邊的話。也就有點兒靠不住。</p>

<p>▲吳佩孚近並無活動</p>
<p>▲選舉事務所卽辦公</p>
<p>張市長前日由京返滬、本報記者、昨在市政府謁晤、詢以川局内幕等各問題、據張氏云、川事已由中央確定辦法、分别任命省政府委員等、業詳報載、</p>
<p>▲駐軍陜南　至劉存厚及田頌堯部、始終未出川、田僅派員收編陜邊馮軍殘部而止、陜南防務、本極空虛、但余在京晤楊虎城代表、謂楊已派所部一師二旅、進駐陜南、吳佩孚在劉存厚勢力保護之下、無指揮能力、並無活動、前曾應有邀來京等說、未成事實</p>
<p>▲共發董事　關於日夜銀行事件、張氏謂、因債權人意見不一致、故市府進行頗感困難、最后始决定委托四律師義務爲債權人參加訴訟、維持其法益、兹後債權人方面、尚未與市政府有何接洽、記者旋詢報載虞洽卿談話、共發公司董事及股東名册已交市府保管、究竟如何、據答、余方由京返滬、諸事未接洽、但無論如何、共發董事、應負無限責任也、</p>

<p>昨天、我那恒妹堅要上學、母親竟再不能留她在家裏了、母親明知她可以上學了、而且明知她是誠心誠意地上學了、還要裝模做樣地阻攔她、我　得這是一種策略、怕的是她上學不到三天、又要百般地藉故不肯去了、所以一再地問着、</p>
<p>「你現在不去上學不好嗎、免得以後又要和我麻煩、惹我和你生氣、不去也好、去了是天天不能懶學的、」</p>
<p>「自然羅、媽、如果我懶學、請你打我駡我好了、我想、媽、我决不會勞你打駡的、」</p>
<p>終於母親答應了她、並又可嚀囑咐了一番、今天早晨便由我帶她到校報名、一路上她祗是高興、不住地跳、不住地笑、一隻手牽了我的手、另一隻挾緊了肩頭上掛着的空書包、這是我早兩年用的、母親昨晚給她找出來啦、母親說、</p>
<p>「沾你哥哥的光、趕明兒你也是聰聰明明地考甲等、」</p>
<p>我到了學校裏、纔知道今天起繳費、下星期一纔能正式上課、我看同學們擠滿了會計處的窗口、有的檢點着收據正走回去、</p>
<p>我便走到校務處先給恒妹辦入學的手續、我過見鄒校長和其他的先生們、我都恭敬地行了禮、</p>
<p>「張永這是你的妹妹嗎、可是帶來頑的、」程老師放下筆桿、生在座位上問我、　　「不、程老師、她是來報名的、預備進一年級、　」</p>
<p>「好極了、幾歲了、她、」鄒校長聽了問着、</p>
<p>「六歲、鄒老師、」</p>
<p>「帶她到秦老師那裏考考看、就給她進來罷、」</p>
<p>我便帶她到一年級級任秦老師跟前、她寫出幾個字來、是「我今天上學、覺得很快樂、」給恒妹認着、恒妹祗認不得一個「覺」字、我知道是不會被拒絶了、秦老師又在和她談着閒話、要試探她的品格和性情、又教她寫字、算簡單的算術、我站在旁邊等着、這時我留意聽鄒校長的說話、</p>
<p>他喝了半杯開水、抽着捲烟向許多老師們說、「現在我看見許多學生來此上學、我總是很快樂、能多給他們一個讀書的機會、便可以洗刷我多少的罪愆、</p>
<p>「有些老師們是知道的、我當聞他們談起、是在前年的暑假後開學的時候罷、有一位郵差帶着他的兒子來報名、他要求我們讓他的兒子能夠轉學、因爲他家已經搬到這邊來、離那原來的學校過遠、　　「我看那成績報告單、成績倒還不錯、我心裏自然是不會拒絶他們的、但是事實上不容許我、那時這裏祗有七班、教室都是擁擠不堪、堆山塞海、（說着他用手指着窗外）那時還没翻蓋這裏的樓房、我一查三年級裏已經有五十八個學生、無論如何不能再收他了、教室裏决也容納不下、我低聲下氣地回復他說、「學校是没有理由可以拒絶任何學生的入學的、</p>
<p>尤其是同在本市轉學的學生、不過由於市政府的教育經費的不甚充足、没有盡量地擴充各學校的班次、便將全市失學的兒童、有駭人的數目、請你看、這裏三年級的教室、是這樣擠滿了桌子板凳、而且祗有這單級、容納着可以分成兩班的兒童、我們敝校是極不願意拒絶這些失學的兒童的、但是事實上這幾天以來不能不拒絶了幾十個很好的兒童、我做校長的心裏眞是說不出地難受着呢、</p>
<p>「貴校的情形固然要原諒、」那郵差說、「舍間的困難也當能瞭解、舍間搬到這裏來住、爲的我可以接近上局裏做事、却離開他那原來的學校有五六里遠近、無論如何、他是不能再在那裏上學了、這邊又祗有這一個學校、其他的是同樣地遠、所以無論如何要請你先生設法、讓我家孩子轉學過來、」</p>
<p>「我聽他懇懇切切地說着、幾乎焦灼要哭了、說話也改變了聲音、我的心裏是針刺一般地難過、我親到三年級的教室裏去、我把課點椅排了又排、實際上是决不能再添一個座位、我便回來告訴他說、「照現在的光景、祗有這個辦法、如果願意退級便在二年級上課、不然等開學後看如有三年級的學生因事不來、再讓他轉學過來、你看怎樣、」</p>
<p>「他眞地流下眼涙來了、他是說不出地委屈着、或者悔恨不應該搬家、祗得帶着那徬徨的孩子去了、自然他是不願意讓他退級的、隨後他又來過一回、恰巧三年級的學生没有一個缺席、他終於失望而去、</p>
<p>「這件事是時常使我慚愧、懊惱而覺得痛心疾首的、照這樣下去、還能算得是堂堂中華民國的教育嗎、由此我便像受了刺激、時刻想着去和當局交涉以擴充我們的班次、多容納失學的兒童、這目的終算達到了、翻蓋了這些樓房、增加了六級的教室、</p>
<p>「所以現在每見新學生的到來、總是像能贖罪似地說不出地快慰、那個學生、現在不知怎樣了、如果當時留下他的姓名住址、我先要把他找來在這裏上學的、」</p>
<p>他說了這一大套、手裏的捲烟來不及抽、已經燒到末梢了、這時我的恒妹已經考畢、准她在一年級裏上學、我便把她帶回家、添取了兩人的學費、吃過午飯、再到會計處去繳納、</p>
<p>這空閒的幾天、正好再温習一遍我假前的功課、</p>
<h3 id="c177">總理紀念週　蔣山靑 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>今天是星期一、是開始正式上課的一天、八點半鐘同學們齊集在大會堂裏、利用朝會的時間、舉行　總理紀念週會的儀式、</p>
<p>我想　總理紀念週會是積極地訓導、不是偶像的崇拜、有異於基督教徒的祈禱、做　總理紀念週會時追懷往昔遠不如策勵將來或覺悔現在、總理的儀容高懸在國黨旗的覆蔭之下、使得你不覺得他己是離去人間、他的精神、他的事業、他的人格、整個地臨現在你的眼前、如果你曾細細地寗靜地體騐過來、你還可覺得那神聖的靈感、磅礴在你的週遭、他促起你的自覺、尤其是在舉行那儀式時、使你排除了驕傲、省識自我的渺小、使你檢點着功業、追悔努力的疏微、基督教徒的祈禱、不過是希冀與盲從、空虛和愚笨、所以兩者是不可相提並論的、</p>
<p>便是「總理紀念歌」詞、比較「我主神明」一類的諛媚、在感覺上、在欣賞上、在歌唱時、都是顯有分别的、</p>
<p>我們　總理、首倡革命、革命血如花　　推翻了專制、建設了共和、産出了我主中華、</p>
<p>民國新成、國事如麻、</p>
<p>總理詳加計劃、重新改革中華、</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>三民主義、五權憲法、眞理細推求、</p>
<p>一世的辛苦、平生的奔走、爲國家犧牲奮鬥、</p>
<p>總理精神、永垂不朽、</p>
<p>如同靑天白日、千秋萬歲長留、</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>民生凋疲、國步艱難、禍患猶未已、莫散了團體、休灰了志氣、大家要互相勉勵、</p>
<p>總理遺言　、不要忘記、</p>
<p>革命尚未成功、同志仍須努力、</p>
<p>這歌詞是由學校裏印發的、唯恐還有人不能唱得純熟、</p>
<p>在唱完黨歌和　總理紀念歌後由校長主席領導行禮、恭讀　總理遺囑和靜默、在循聲誦讀的時候、聲音極整齊而嚴肅、仍像全體覺醒的誓告、在靜默的時候、最頑皮的最喜歡逗笑或常做鬼臉的同學、也都虔誠而寗靜、四五百個人的意識和感情、都被打成一片了、今天這當兒、正是全國的學校和機關團體同做　總理紀念週會的時候在這晴明的早晨、約有幾千萬人的意識和感情也被打成一片了、幾千萬人的心目中都體念着總理的精神事業和人格、他們都能準備着、覺醒着、策勵着再現總理的精神、模擬　總理的人格、並努力奮鬥以成就總理未完的事業、</p>
<p>校長和訓　主任都有演說、校長並擇要報告最近的中國政治黨務情形和世界的大勢、因爲今天是開學後的第一次做　總理紀念週會、他更嚴肅的語句、是句句打着聽者的心坎、語語留着深刻的印象、他再說明　總理紀念週會的意義和我們應有的態度、</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>China's aviation industry has declined, indeed influenced by the oppression of foreign airlines. In the future, we should uphold the principle of international equality and recover aviation rights. The methods are: (1) The Chinese government will offer to buy out foreign companies operating airline services in China's territorial waters and rivers; (2) Or China will temporarily invest in joint ventures, but the name and sovereignty will be controlled by China, and foreign shares will be repaid on schedule. Haas expressed his willingness to promote this internationally. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

It was initially discussed that before the Northeast demobilization funds arrived, the Department of Finance should be ordered to raise funds first. However, due to the emptiness of the provincial treasury and the provincial bank's remaining seven or eight million in stored notes, it was practically impossible to transfer funds.

<p>(Nanjing) The Examination Yuan has scheduled the higher examination for July 15th. Initially, it was planned to hold it simultaneously in multiple regions across the country. After further study, due to the complexity of various examinations and the large number of test commissioners and assistant graders required, it was not easy to complete the examinations at once. Therefore, it has been temporarily postponed. The ordinary examination has also been decided to be held on September 15th, as the ordinary talents needed by various provinces are extremely important. It is planned to divide the country into nine examination zones, with each zone governing three provinces, using a circuit examination method to conduct examinations in sequence.

<p>(Beiping) The US Embassy Counselor said that the US Ambassador's visit to Beijing is for general negotiations on legal rights and other matters, and has absolutely nothing to do with silver loans. US officials still deny the authenticity of the US silver loan news, saying that it is not yet on the table. As for the issue of legal rights, the countries still base it on the report of the Chinese Legal Rights Investigation Commission, hoping to gradually abolish them. Even Japan, which is about to expire its treaty, has not yet expressed its abandonment. In the future, I am afraid that the popular method will be to abandon it at the same time after the Chinese Legal Rights Commission abandons it, because there are precedents to follow in the treaties between China and certain countries.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce ordered the construction departments of various provinces, saying that cattle can provide nutritious food and are indispensable for the daily use of the people. A uniform ban on slaughtering cattle will inevitably lead to difficulties in practice. The ban is only a temporary emergency measure, and it is not a long-term solution for the aftermath. Moreover, there is no clear distinction between draft cattle and vegetable cattle in our country. When farmers slaughter cattle, they often hold different views and argue with each other, submitting petitions and appeals. The root cause of this is the lack of cattle, and the supply cannot meet the demand. To seek a fundamental solution, the first step is to promote the cattle breeding industry among the people and increase the number of cattle in the country. You are required to investigate the supply and demand of cattle in your province clearly and propose measures to promote cattle breeding and implement them effectively. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">China International Famine Relief Commission's News on Gansu Disaster <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The China International Famine Relief Commission received news that the rumor that 4 million people died in the extraordinary disaster in Gansu is actually inaccurate, as the entire province has a population of only about 7 million. The entire Northwest of China has recently suffered from famine, with Shaanxi being the most severe, but after the rescue efforts of the China International Famine Relief Commission and other organizations, and after the rainfall last year, the situation has improved. Gansu province is now considered the most severely affected. It is heard that the situation northeast of Lanzhou is deteriorating daily due to the simultaneous invasion of hail, early frost, locusts, and the plague. Moreover, there has been no snowfall this winter, which has caused great panic among the people. In addition, Feng Yuxiang's army looted Gansu extensively. After Feng Yuxiang's army withdrew, the Hui army took over the entire southern part of the province, and the exploitation was even more severe. Therefore, it is difficult to find a wealthy household in southern Gansu today. Gansu province is located in a remote area, and transporting relief supplies requires passing through the disaster areas and bandit areas of Shaanxi and Suiyuan, so it is very difficult to provide relief. However, the China International Famine Relief Commission spent 500,000 yuan on relief last year and hopes to spend more this year in order to save tens of thousands of people.

<h3 id="e45">The Future of the Naval Reduction Treaty of the Five Nations <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The world fears a second World War every month. I believe that this is not necessarily true. The biggest reason is that if a second World War were to actually occur, the capitalist countries would inevitably suffer a major blow, or even be wiped out. Today is still the era when capitalist countries hold world power, so no matter how much they compete with each other, they will never be willing to embark on this path of shared danger. If there is even a glimmer of hope for reconciliation, they will do their best to achieve it, and prevent the recurrence of a world war. This is my fundamental view that a world war will not recur.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the London Conference was reducing naval forces, I expected that it would not be possible to achieve a sincere and thorough solution between the countries. However, there must be some achievements to maintain the current temporary situation. Later, due to the mutual unwillingness of France and Italy, the naval conference of the five major powers became an agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan. Now, due to the British Prime Minister's visit to France and Italy, the dispute between France and Italy seems to have room for compromise. Although the matter has not yet been revealed, it is obvious that the countries are unwilling to have war during this period.</p>

<p>Seemingly Approaching Compromise</p>
<p>Details Still to Be Planned</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Rome, 26th The diplomacy conducted by British Foreign Secretary Henderson through travel conferences is progressing quite rapidly. There is optimism here about it. The British Foreign Secretary and the First Lord of the Admiralty first went to Paris and then to Rome, wanting to make last year's London Naval Treaty a Five-Power Treaty. Italian newspapers mentioned this matter, calling it a travel conference. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Secretary and Navy Secretary met with Henderson and Alexander this afternoon for about an hour to discuss the draft treaty. The results have not yet been released, and there is no real news in newspaper criticism. However, it is heard that Henderson and Alexander had smiles on their faces when they left the Prime Minister's residence. Moreover, Foreign Secretary Mo and others are scheduled to visit various scenic spots tomorrow. From this, it seems that their work has now been completed, and the scene of political negotiations has also been satisfactorily decided. However, the details still need to be planned. Experts worked all day today and will continue to do so tomorrow morning. It is heard that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has assigned the initial negotiations to Foreign Secretary Grandi, and will only personally step in when the two sides are close to a compromise. The first day of activities of the British Foreign Secretary and others in Rome, visiting the Italian Prime Minister in the afternoon, shows that the preliminary negotiations with Grandi in the morning have been successful. Even if the views of the two sides are not completely the same, they must not be far apart. It is heard that the new proposal submitted to the Italian government is largely similar to what British Foreign Office's Craig had stated, that is, to reduce the shipbuilding program in the next five years and enlarge the replacement program. The replacement program stipulates the tonnage that can be moved from one type of warship to another for each type of warship. The new proposal differs slightly from Craig's original proposal for the tonnage of each type that France and Italy can build, but the final difference between the Italian and French navies in 1936 remains practically unchanged. According to this new proposal, Italy seems to abandon its principle of defending equality with France at the London session, but this is temporary in nature, and Italy may not be offended. Tonight, Foreign Secretary Grandi will host a banquet to entertain Foreign Secretary Mo and others.</p>

<p>Government Disadvantaged in Industrial Disputes Bill</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 26th Today, the House of Commons again asked Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden to pay attention to the decline in silver prices. Snowden replied that he was willing to give serious consideration to any proposals that were suitable for implementation to maintain silver prices. However, in his opinion, this matter must be regarded as part of the major issue of maintaining general prices, otherwise it would be difficult to achieve effective management.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 26th The House of Lords passed the second reading of the Chinese Indemnity Bill. This bill does not require review, so it can be implemented after the third reading is passed.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 26th The Industrial Disputes Bill, which the Conservative Party's Baldwin considers to endanger individual freedom and also endanger the country, now shows signs of being shelved. When the House of Commons held a review meeting today, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party passed the Liberal Party's amendment. The original bill considered sympathetic strikes to be legal, while the amendment considered general strikes to be illegal. The original bill, after this amendment, will have no value. Will the Labor government proceed with this amended form of industrial dispute, or will it abandon it? This is the question. However, the government will not resign hastily because of the failure of this bill, because Prime Minister MacDonald recently announced to the public that the government will only resign when a direct impeachment case fails. The Liberal Party's amendment stipulates that any strike involving the supply and distribution of food, water, fuel, medicine, and other necessities of life, causing the public to suffer health risks or endangering public safety, is illegal.</p>

Isolated and in dire straits, he upheld his integrity and sacrificed his life. With the tongue of Changshan, his great righteousness was indelible. Returning to the origin of Xianzhen, his heroic spirit is contagious. We have scheduled to hold a memorial service at the Capital Public Stadium on March 15 to show our admiration and honor his bravery. Alas, Chang Hong transformed into jade, inspiring the hearts of the righteous men of the declining Zhou dynasty. When Suiyang was besieged, it strengthened the spirit of the eight men of Nanyang.

Since the Ministry issued notes to six countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil, in December last year, all countries except France have responded. The Netherlands and Norway have also expressed their willingness to negotiate abolition measures, and Brazil is also willing to consider it. These three countries can be said to be no longer a problem. Currently, the countries under negotiation are only the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. These three countries also absolutely agree in principle with our position. What needs to be discussed is the method of withdrawal. The United Kingdom, the United States, and others advocate gradually abolishing it in stages, while we firmly advocate complete abolition. The focus of the current negotiations is on this. On the American side, Minister Wu is still actively negotiating with the U.S. State Department. On the British side, the British government has telegraphed British Ambassador Lampson to start negotiations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately. After receiving the telegram, the British ambassador has returned to Shanghai from Singapore and is scheduled to come to Nanjing within a day or two to continue the extraterritoriality negotiations. As for the French side, there is no definite news as to when French Ambassador Wilden will come to Nanjing. As for the Dutch Ambassador Oudendijk, there is also news that he will come south soon. It is found that there are a total of 25 countries that have treaty relations with our country. Among them, ten countries have abandoned extraterritoriality. The other six countries will also abandon it under certain circumstances. Three countries have old treaties that have already expired and are currently negotiating new treaties. Of course, they cannot be allowed to continue to enjoy it. As for the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil, whose old treaties have not yet expired, have expressed their intentions. Only the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are left to negotiate. Our country will not allow any further delays in this matter. If all countries can resolve it with our country through negotiation, there will of course be no problems. Otherwise, other methods can also be adopted to resolve it. The second most important diplomatic issue at present is the Sino-Russian negotiations. Regarding the Sino-Russian issue, since Representative Mo came to Nanjing, the central government has obtained a report from the British representative and has drafted a concrete plan for Russia. In principle, methods have been decided on issues such as the China Eastern Railway, trade, and resumption of diplomatic relations. The procedure for the Sino-Russian conference is still to treat the China Eastern Railway issue as a matter for formal discussion. As for matters such as trade and resumption of diplomatic relations, they will be decided based on the actual situation. In short, our country has decided to use the Sino-Russian Agreement of 1924 as the basis for negotiations. Representative Mo has already started his journey north and will stay in Harbin for a few days before going to Russia to continue consultations.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Ministry of Education Carefully Considers the Haiyuan Pavilion Collection <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲Wang Xiantang Submits a Reply on the Investigation</p>
<p>▲And Drafts an Outline of the Preservation Agreement</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yang family's collection of books in Haiyuan Pavilion, Liaocheng, has been sold by bandits and by the Yang family themselves. The Ministry of Education believes that the books in the pavilion are of great importance to Chinese literature and has repeatedly telegraphed the Shandong Education Department to investigate and try to preserve them. Recently, the Ministry of Education ordered the Education Department to submit a reply so that they could jointly find a way. The Education Department immediately ordered Wang Xiantang, the director of the Shandong Library, to submit a report on the negotiations with the Yang family so that it could be forwarded. Wang has now submitted to the Education Department the situation of the investigation of the Haiyuan Pavilion collection, the negotiations with the book owner on preservation, and a draft outline of the agreement on the Haiyuan Pavilion books. It is heard that on the book owner's side, the old Mrs. Yang once expressed to others that she could accept the method of donating the collection of books, with the National Government, the Provincial Government, and the Yang family jointly forming a preservation committee and establishing the Haiyuan Pavilion Library. This is because her family still has 50 acres of good land, which is enough to keep them warm and fed. However, her son, Yang Jingfu, lost money in business in Tianjin and is eager to sell them to make up for the losses. (The books sold in Tianjin were to make up for the losses. 23 kinds of fine Song and Yuan editions were sold, earning 85,000 yuan, including the Song Dynasty Caichang edition of Liu Ji, sold for 10,000 yuan, and the Song Dynasty edition of Chu Ci, sold for 7,500 yuan.) The submission from Wang Xiantang to the Education Department is attached below:</p>
<p>"I have investigated the case of the Hai Pavilion book of the Yang family in Liaocheng. Previously, your office issued order No. 379, ordering the civil affairs department to send members to report. While I was responding, I received order No. 573 from your office, ordering me to inquire about the report that the Yang family had transported the items. For this reason, the most refined Song and Yuan editions had already been transported to Tianjin earlier. In the winter of the 18th year, I was ordered to go and investigate. I saw that the remaining books were mostly ordinary editions. There were also good Song and Yuan editions and famous handwritten copies, but they were not the most refined items of the Yang family. After I returned to Jinan and reported, your office planned to take custody of the books and sent a member of the Civil Affairs Office to handle this case together. I was also among the members sent. I was about to set off for the alliance, but traffic had been cut off by bandits, and Liaocheng was occupied. Their pseudo-headquarters was set up in the Haiyuan Pavilion. Later, due to the sudden outbreak of war and changes in the political situation, I resigned from my post, and the pseudo-government of the Jin army did not know the importance of books and culture, and no one cared about it. However, when the bandits occupied Liaocheng, according to investigations, a part of the books was sold and taken away by them. The books that were sold were sold to the local ruffians at any time, and then transferred to Jinan merchants. The librarians tried their best to buy them back and have already purchased four kinds. Among them, two kinds were recorded in the Shushu Yulu. The cost of purchasing the seal was too high. Now, if the library has enough funds, it can find a way to buy them back. I dare to say that the books sold by the bandits in Liaocheng and returned to the local ruffians can be completely recovered. As for the part that they took away, they all flowed to the Baoding area and then returned to the Beijing merchants. Now it is heard that most of them have been sold secretly. This is the situation of the losses before and after that time. Later, I received a report from the director of the Liaocheng Library that the remaining books of the Yang family had all been transported to Jinan. I immediately reported to your office, and the provincial government sent members to investigate together. Following your order No. 379, the remaining books of the Yang family have indeed all been transported here, about fifty or sixty boxes, and are stored in the private residence of the Yang family on Weiyi Road, Shangbu. The head of the family, Yang Jingfu, is still in Tianjin, and only his old lady lives here. She also indirectly stated to me that when the books were transported to Jinan, they were in a mess, all packed in boxes, and had not been sorted out. Now that she is ill and no one is taking care of her, she plans to sort them out separately as soon as she recovers, and invites people from all walks of life to visit. The rumors of sale are all untrue, and she intends to try her best to recover them, etc. This is the situation of the Yang family's books before and after they were transported to Jinan. Now, all the books stored here by the Yang family are the books that I inspected at the Haiyuan Pavilion a few years ago. There are not many fine Song and Yuan editions. The most refined ones are all in Tianjin. Whether a part of them is currently being sold, what kind of books are being sold, how much is the price, who is handling it, and to whom are they being sold, I am investigating. I have already gained some clues. Before obtaining true and accurate evidence, it seems inappropriate to rush to submit a report to your office. I have asked me to write out the opinions of the library first, so that we can discuss and decide together. As this case is of great importance, the proposed method must first be approved by your office, and secondly, it must be agreed to by the Yang family. However, if I first submit it to your office for approval, and the Yang family refuses to agree, it seems to be related to prestige, and there are many inconveniences. Therefore, I have drafted a draft, divided into three methods, for the Yang family to choose one from. After they have chosen, I will further detail the rules and submit them to your office for approval, so that the library and the Yang family can have room for maneuver. Now this draft has been submitted to the Yang family. According to indirect statements, they have sent a letter to their head of household, Yang Jingfu, and important relatives to come to Jinan to discuss together. Once a decision is made, they will formally reply to the library. This is the current situation. As for the preservation that the library intends to undertake this time, it includes all the good editions stored in Tianjin, and is not limited to the ordinary books transported to Jinan. We have already made considerable arrangements in all aspects. According to current observations, the books stored here are unlikely to be transported out and sold privately. In response to the previous order, I have truthfully and in detail reported the whole situation. Please review it."</p>
<h3 id="e65">Jinan Chamber of Commerce Asks for Reduction of Business Tax <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong has lost 5 million yuan in provincial treasury revenue due to the impact of the abolition of likin. The provincial government is currently opening a business tax to make up for it. Regarding the business tax regulations and implementing rules, the business tax preparation committee has drafted a draft. The tax rate is divided into five categories, all collected according to the annual turnover. The first category is salt, grain, coal, bricks, tiles, lime, knives, scissors, sauce gardens, and firewood, collected at 1/1000. The second category is hemp textiles, cotton textiles, medicinal materials, pharmacies, cloth, bamboo and wood, rattan crafts, books and stationery, second-hand clothes, shoes and hats, southern paper, iron, yarn, coarse porcelain, clothing boxes, threads, towels, collected at 2/1000. The third category is tea, eggs, dyes, candles, soap, silk, cocoons, ham, matches, groceries, fine porcelain, glass, copper, tin, fish, fruit, fans, collected at 5/1000. The fourth category is embroidery, sugar, leather, hardware, lace industry, electrical appliances, electrical materials, copper beds, iron beds, foreign groceries, etc., collected at 10/1000. The fifth category is rubber, Western clothes, foreign paper, woollen cloth, Western medicine, antiques, jewelry, clocks, glasses, ivory, incense and paper foil, tea food, canned food, Western-style furniture, sea cucumber, bird's nest, cosmetics, art, soda, ice food, etc., collected at 15/1000. In addition, the four items of silver savings companies, insurance companies, and exchanges are taxed at 20/1000 of the capital. The Jinan City Chamber of Commerce believes that the tax rate set in the draft is too high. After a long period of devastation in Shandong, if the draft is implemented, merchants and people will not be able to afford it. It is now planned to send telegrams to chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities to solicit opinions, and to submit a report to the business tax preparation committee, requesting that it be collected according to the highest tax rate of 2/1000 promulgated by the central government, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The telegrams and reports will be sent out within a few days.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Ganzhou Province Plans to Complete Three Provincial Roads <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Three Roads of Ganzhou-Guangdong, Ganzhou-Zhejiang, and Ganzhou-Hunan</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Gong Xuesui, the Director of the Jiangxi Construction Bureau, believes that transportation in southern and western Jiangxi is extremely inconvenient, allowing the communists to exploit remote areas as hideouts. Furthermore, the province is vast, and military forces are insufficient to cover every county. When an alarm is raised, dispatching troops takes time, which the communists exploit by moving from one place to another. Moreover, the communists have ravaged almost all of the province's eighty-one counties, leaving countless millions as victims. Simply providing relief passively is difficult to achieve universally. It would be better to provide relief through work projects, which would be more effective. He has specifically proposed to the provincial government that the three lines of the six major provincial roads decided by the Highway Department—Ganzhou-Guangdong, Ganzhou-Zhejiang, and Ganzhou-Hunan—be completed in advance. These three roads all center on Nanchang. The Ganzhou-Guangdong road will run along the Gan River through Ji'an in western Jiangxi and Ganzhou in southern Jiangxi, cross Dayu to reach Nanxiong in Guangdong, and connect to the Yuehan Railway. The Ganzhou-Zhejiang road will pass through Dongxiang, Yujiang, Shangrao, and Yushan in eastern Jiangxi to Changshan in Zhejiang, where it will end. This road will directly connect to Hangzhou. The Ganzhou-Hunan road will run west from Nanchang, passing through Gao'an and Shanggao, along the Yuan River through Yuanzhou and Pingxiang, and connect to the Liling-Wuchang road (which is also the Gan-Xiang railway line). The total length of the three roads is over two thousand li. Except for the Ganzhou-Guangdong road, which already has more than eighty kilometers completed, and the Ganzhou-Zhejiang road, which has more than ten kilometers completed (and is already open to traffic), the estimated cost of construction is over 11 million yuan. It is proposed to request the central government to issue 10 million yuan in disaster relief bonds (with the southern Jiangxi mineral tax as a fund for phased repayment) as construction funds, providing relief through work projects, and completing the project within one year. This has already been approved by the 350th meeting of the provincial government and submitted to the central government for approval. Director Gong also plans to go to Beijing soon to personally explain everything to Chairman Jiang, Minister Song, and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting approval so that construction can begin.

<h3 id="e69">The Second Day of Discussions on Business Tax by Chambers of Commerce in Various Counties of Jiangsu <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 26th) at 4:00 p.m., representatives from chambers of commerce in various counties of Jiangsu Province held their second discussion on the business tax issue at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce. A total of forty-three representatives attended, with Yu Xiaochuan as chairman. The discussion items were: (1) Review of the review report of the committee reviewing all opinions, and a request for a public resolution. (Resolved) Approved with revisions according to the review report as follows: (1) Before the complete abolition of various miscellaneous taxes and levies similar to likin, as well as the coastal tax within fifty li of customs and the transportation surcharges on railways, the business tax shall not be levied in accordance with the clear orders of the National Government and the principles of the Business Tax Outline decided by the Likin Reduction Committee in 1928. (2) Since the business tax is based on business income, it should not be levied on goods. However, the Jiangsu Province tax rate table classifies goods for sales tax into as many as seventy-four categories, which is clearly a tax on goods, no different from likin. It should be clearly ordered to be abolished and only levied on the sale of goods, with a maximum rate of no more than two per mille. (3) Article 4 of the promulgated outline stipulates that the business tax rate should be calculated using the per mille method based on the tax standard, with a maximum rate of no more than two per mille. However, there is an added proviso that this does not apply to luxury businesses and other businesses that should be banned.</p>
<p>Merchants' buying and selling should not go beyond the scope of goods. Currently, luxury goods have already been subject to increased customs duties, consolidated taxes, and special taxes. The business tax is a tax on activities, and it is impossible to exceed two per mille. As for businesses that should be banned, the Fourth Plenary Session of the current Central Executive Committee resolved to reform politics, so there is no reason to tax them. All of this is different from the situation at the time of the Likin Reduction Conference in 1928. The standard should be strictly adhered to, with a maximum calculation of two per mille. (4) Article 8 of the supplementary measures stipulates that for those who use business turnover as the tax standard, the maximum should not exceed twenty per mille, which clearly conflicts with the original Article 4 of the outline, which stipulates that the maximum should not exceed two per mille. It should be corrected. (5) According to Article 1 of the outline, companies that have already paid income tax to the central government and those that have already been levied special taxes by the central government are not within the scope of business tax levied by the provinces. Therefore, business tax should not be levied on the sale of goods that have already been subject to consolidated taxes and special taxes, as well as their direct manufactured products. (6) Wholesale is a wholesale activity and not a direct activity. It is indeed different from ordinary commercial direct buying and selling. If business tax is also levied, then both retail and wholesale will be taxed, which is clearly a duplicate tax. It should be exempted. If there are both retail and wholesale operations, only the retail turnover should be taxed. (7) Daily necessities and goods that have always been tax-exempt should be uniformly tax-exempt. (2) A request to nominate representatives to petition in Beijing. (Resolved) Ten petition representatives were nominated, with each of the ten chambers of commerce from Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Wuxi, Wuxian, Danyang, Gaoyou, Dongtai, Tongshan, Wujiang, and Jurong counties nominating one representative. They will gather at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the capital on the afternoon of March 2nd and petition the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry on the 3rd. The petition will be jointly signed by all representatives from the province. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m. The representatives returned to their respective counties yesterday and this morning to report the results of the discussion.</p>

<p>The National Assembly Resolution Not to Postpone: The National Assembly is scheduled to convene on May 5th. Supervisors for the election of representatives in various regions have been appointed one after another. Magistrate Pan of this county has also been appointed as the supervisor for the election of representatives by Director Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs. After accepting the appointment, Magistrate Pan scheduled a meeting of various legal groups yesterday to discuss the matters at hand. Yesterday, Magistrate Pan also received a telegram from Director Hu, stating that the election matters must not be postponed in order to emphasize the election and suppress the new world's toleration of opium dens, gambling houses, and prostitution. Magistrate Pan of the county government, due to the letter from the County Cleanup Association, stated that the New World Hotel under the Gongyun Bridge outside the Guangfu Gate has been found to be harboring opium dens, gambling houses, and prostitution, leading to the attraction of wandering youths. Recently, Zhou Runshi, an investigator from the Department of Civil Affairs Police Affairs, and Wang Chongxi, the director of the Eighth Branch Bureau, were diligently entertained by the hotel for their pleasure trips and prostitution, which is extremely detrimental to good customs. Therefore, yesterday, he instructed Xu Jigui, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, to strictly suppress the hotel. The construction of an oil pool mediation failed. Ge Zicai, the manager of the Yuan Da Oil Company in this county, planned to build an oil pool on the east side of the Lvluo Nunnery outside the East Gate, near Yanglu Lane, to store oil. This was repeatedly and resolutely opposed by the citizens of the Eastern District and seven silk factories, resulting in administrative litigation. It is now known that the county government, due to receiving instructions from the Department of Construction, instructed both parties to be summoned immediately to engage in mediation. Therefore, the first mediation meeting was held in the Wenxi Hall of the county government at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than ten representatives from both parties, including Ge Zicai, Sheng Zhufu, and Chen Tongfu, attended. First, Wei Zhenzhai, the chief of the Second Section, presented the instructions from the Department of Construction, and then the mediation began. However, neither party made any concessions. Wei, the chief of the Section, then stated that since this case has been mediated by the government, the parties should not argue and wait for a decision. At this point, the mediation meeting ended.</p>
<p>A Major Fire Near Xiaohong Bridge: The area near the city wall inside the Guangfu Gate of Xiyi is mostly thatched huts from Jiangbei.

It spread to the neighbors on the left, resulting in the burning down of more than forty thatched houses belonging to twelve families, including Gu Baoshan, Ding Renbao, and Xi Genqing. Fortunately, the fire brigades from each section arrived to put out the fire, which was eventually extinguished. The estimated loss is more than three thousand yuan. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>

<p>Late at Night, a Strange Young Man Suddenly Appears at the County Girls' School: The County Middle School in this county is divided into two parts: a boys' section in the new school building in front of the Xicang and a girls' section in the Shimei Reading Platform at the foot of Yushan. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 p.m. on the 23rd, a student named Zhang Qinsheng in the girls' section of the school felt a slight cold and asked a doctor for medicine, ordering a school servant to boil the medicine in the kitchen. Suddenly, she heard footsteps outside and saw a man through the window. The school servant immediately reported to the dormitory supervisor and director of moral education, Ms. Yan Qin-yun, who ordered two male servants to arrest him in the kitchen. Ms. Yan questioned him in detail. The young man claimed to be Yuan Qixiang and said he had lost his way and asked to be excused. Yan saw that he was wearing a Mao Ge fur robe and was about twenty years old. Although he did not look like a thief, it was not appropriate to listen to his excuses for breaking into a girls' school late at night. Moreover, the front school gate was tightly closed, indicating that he had climbed over the wall from the mountain behind. Therefore, she immediately telegraphed the Public Security First Sub-Bureau to send police to take the young man to the bureau for questioning. He claimed to live with relatives named Li in Shuyuan Lane and continued to state the same as before. At this time, Yuan Yihuai, a reporter from the Xinsheng Daily, heard the news and went to verify that the person was indeed honest and had mistakenly entered the school after getting drunk while going to Miaojia Mountain. He then submitted a statement for bail. The next morning, the principal of the school, Xu Yunfu, went to the Education Bureau to report the matter and request strict punishment. The director of the bureau, Gao Zishan, telegraphed to request strict investigation, as it was late at night. Why did the young man climb into the girls' school? If he is not severely punished, it will not be enough to deter future incidents. The Public Security Bureau may conduct a strict investigation and handle the matter.</p>

<p>Director of Education Bureau Investigates New Account Books: In Yangzhong County, during the tenure of the former Director of Education, Wang Huankun, the income and expenditure of education funds were never made public. When the education surcharges and school rent were collected in January, the principals of the primary schools had not yet received their salaries. Therefore, on the day Wang left office, Liu Yulin and other primary school principals petitioned the county government to withhold the settlement. Fortunately, the county government only approved "to be reviewed after the new director investigates the account books."</p>
<p>Therefore, Wang was able to leave Yangzhong peacefully. In recent days, the new director, Fan Xuezhen, has been investigating Wang's previous account books. It is heard that one item of bureau expenses has exceeded the budget by more than one time. The director's travel expenses are always opened for thirty or forty yuan each time, and the office expenses paid monthly by Wang, who also served as the head of the social education section, were twenty-four yuan. There are many other irregularities in various other items as well. Yesterday, the principal of a certain fourth primary school came to the bureau to collect the expenses for December. According to the handover documents, it had already been paid and there were receipts. In fact, on the income side, 500 yuan had been received from the county government on February 8th. By the time of the handover on the 12th, no school had been paid, and the account books handed over showed that the former director still owed more than one hundred yuan. There are many doubts, which cannot be exhausted. It is now heard that Director Fan has reported the results of the investigation to the county government.</p>

<p>Overview of Yangzhou Money Shops Reopening: It is customary for the money industry in Yangzhou to reopen on the fifth day of the first lunar month after the lunar calendar. Due to the relocation of the Yunsup and the depletion of funds, after the overall settlement, the money shops were unable to recover the money released, amounting to a huge amount of 1.2 million yuan, which caused them all to wait and see.

<p>The bandit communists of Jade Mountain were repelled by the training corps. After the communist bandits under Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping were defeated in their lairs by the main forces, they took advantage of the situation to flee to Jade Mountain, first capturing Lingjiangpu, then Fangtou, endangering the county seat. Repeated requests for assistance were made, but due to the suddenness of the event, the provincial government had no troops to dispatch, so a special telegram was sent to Tang, the brigade commander stationed in Hekou, and Zhao, the regimental commander stationed in Shangrao, to devise a way to provide assistance. Regimental Commander Zhao, feeling that Raozhou was close to the bandit area and he could not divide his forces, personally led two companies to Yuzhen for support. At noon on the eighth, Zhou Jianping, the false army commander of the Red Army's Tenth Army, and Tu Zhennong, the false political commissar, led three regiments of infantry, one battalion each of machine guns, and teams of peasant Red Guards, women's Red Guards, and children's Red Guards, with over ten thousand bandits, to besiege Jade Mountain. Regimental Commander Zhao directed his troops to fight fiercely, holding out for five hours. Ultimately, outnumbered, they broke through the encirclement, sustaining minor injuries, and braved the rainy night to rush to Shangrao to gather his troops. He ordered Zhao, the regimental adjutant, to divide into two routes to encircle and suppress Jade Mountain, fighting fiercely all day, killing and wounding over a thousand communist bandits, and also killing the false regimental commander Mo Rongzheng and the false chief of staff Li Kedi. The bandit forces, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated in defeat towards the old base. The casualties of Regimental Commander Zhao's officers and soldiers were less than one hundred.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Ministry of Education Orders Notice of Relief Measures for Students in Unregistered Private Schools <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has stipulated provisional measures for students admitted to unregistered private schools in various universities for the 1930 academic year. In addition to notifying public universities, colleges, and private vocational schools, instructions have also been issued to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating that public and registered private vocational schools and higher institutions should not, starting from the 1930 academic year, admit students promoted from unregistered private senior high schools or transfer students from unregistered private vocational schools and higher institutions. The Ministry has previously issued orders to comply with this. Recently, schools such as Shanghai Private Datong University have requested permission for provisional measures. Upon review of the original request, the reasons presented are not without merit. The following measures are now stipulated: (1) First-year students admitted to various vocational schools and higher institutions in the 1930 academic year who graduated from unregistered private senior high schools will be temporarily allowed to attend classes as auditors. When the educational administrative organs of various provinces and cities hold pre-admission examinations for graduates of unregistered private senior high schools around July of this year, they will be allowed to take the examinations nearby. After passing the examinations, their admission qualifications will be retroactively verified. (2) Transfer students from unregistered private vocational schools and higher institutions admitted to various vocational schools and higher institutions in the 1930 academic year will be temporarily allowed to attend classes as auditors. The entrance examination papers of each student should be sent to the Ministry for review. If deemed qualified, their admission qualifications will be retroactively recognized. The above measures are limited to students already admitted by various schools in the 1930 academic year. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the said department for notification and compliance.</p>

<p>Cheng Tianfang, the Education Commissioner of Anhui Province, has been in office for two years, actively managing education. The academic atmosphere in Anhui has undergone a significant change. He recently resigned and arrived in Shanghai. A reporter inquired about the reasons for his resignation. Cheng stated, "I have been suffering from insomnia for the past two months, so I intend to relinquish everything and go to Lushan for recuperation. There is no other reason." Although he received earnest requests from within the province and from Anhui natives in Beijing and Shanghai to stay, he has firmly decided to resign and will not return. The original resignation letter from Cheng to the Executive Yuan is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the request for resignation: I, Tianfang, have been serving in the Anhui provincial government, responsible for educational administration, for over two years. Recognizing my heavy responsibilities and limited abilities, I have long considered retirement. Recently, my old insomnia has recurred. For two or three nights a week, I cannot sleep, and the next morning I experience dizziness and mental confusion, causing great suffering. Doctors advise that I am overthinking and need a long period of recuperation to restore my health. Therefore, my desire to leave is even stronger. If I continue to delay, it will be detrimental to both public and private interests. If illness prevents me from fulfilling my duties, it will affect the education of the entire province, for which I could not face the nation or Your Excellency. I believe Your Excellency originally entrusted me with the responsibility of rectifying the academic atmosphere. Over the past two years, I have devoted all my efforts to this, working day and night without relaxation. Although I have not achieved great success, the current situation is different from when I first arrived in Anhui. Students in various schools are now aware of their mistakes and are making learning their priority. The actions of occupying flags, distributing leaflets, assaulting teachers, and attacking government offices have ceased. Anhui is not a wealthy province, but over the past two years, provincial education funding has increased by nearly 600,000 yuan, and local education funding has increased by over 700,000 yuan annually. As a result, the number of schools and students has significantly expanded. These two achievements alone are enough to absolve me of blame. As for future efforts to improve student levels, enrich school content, and promote universal compulsory education and mass education, active measures are needed that require educational experts, which I, Tianfang, am not capable of. I should step aside. For these reasons, I respectfully submit my resignation, hoping for your prompt approval, so that I may be relieved of my duties as soon as possible. I await your command with utmost urgency and respect. Respectfully submitted to Jiang, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan."</p>

<p>Nanyang Middle School has organized a lecture series for this semester. The first lecture will be given by Chu Minyi on the topic of "The Responsibilities of Middle School Students in the Period of Political Tutelage." The meeting will be held at 3:45 PM on the first day of the month in the school's alumni hall. All students will attend. After a formal greeting, Gu Yinming will deliver a welcome address, followed by Mr. Chu's lecture. First, he explained the essence of the Three Principles of the People and political tutelage, so that students could understand the importance of studying party doctrine. He then addressed the points that middle school students should pay close attention to, stating that they must understand the world situation and recognize their own position. They should not only focus on acquiring knowledge but also cultivate the ability to put it into practice. He said that the students, during this period of political tutelage, should concentrate on their studies, so that when they enter society in the constitutional era, they will be able to contribute greatly to the country. Finally, Gu Yinming summarized the main points of the lecture and invited everyone to stand and express their gratitude before adjourning.</p>

<p>The Zhenru football team, having returned from the south, swept away Lax last week, and after a second battle, painfully defeated the Lehua team. The new lineup and new strategy have doubled their strength. Siegert, on the other hand, has never been defeated since arriving in Shanghai. Their record is the best in Group A. The two teams are scheduled to meet at Shenyuan at 3:00 PM today. When evenly matched opponents meet, it's hard to know who will win. Those who have long heard of the fame of these two teams should be quick to witness it.</p>

<p>▲ Early May</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The football and basketball teams of the Philippine Demas University are renowned throughout the Philippines. The school's football and basketball teams maintained the national championship last year. In recent years, Japanese football and basketball skills have also made considerable progress, so the school has long wanted to visit Japan for a test. The school's physical education coach, Mr. Villa, has now been sent to Japan to contact the Tokyo Christian YMCA. After consultation, it was decided that Mr. Villa will lead 30 football and basketball players to Japan for matches in early May this year. They will stay in Japan for about three weeks. The first week will be devoted to ample practice, the second week will be for matches in the Kanto area, and the third week will be for matches in the Kansai area. It is planned that the basketball team will play against six universities - Waseda, Keio, Meiji, Rikkyo, Teikyo, and Shodai - from May 15th to 20th, while the football team will play against Teikyo, Waseda, and Keio universities, as well as the all-Japan champions, on the 15th, 17th, 19th, and 20th. The matches in the Kansai area are scheduled from the 23rd to the 26th. The strength of the two teams is equal to that of Japan's top teams, and it is expected that this expedition to Japan will result in an even split of wins and losses.</p>

<p>丨One to Zero丨Zhou Xianyan's Contribution丨</p>
<p>▲ The Chinese United Team Loses in the Second Half</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) After arriving in Hong Kong, the Shanghai Interport football team made a stunning display, defeating the Hong Kong Interport team. Therefore, it was said that the match against the Chinese United team on the 21st would be difficult to win. In the end, Shanghai won 1-0. Success or failure is a matter of luck, not a failure in battle.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Team</p>

<p>▲ Iron Gate in Front... Chinese United Team Sighs</p>
<p>The game started at 2:00 PM, and the spectators were packed like mountains and seas. Naval Commander Chen Ce came to watch, but could not get in due to the crowding. The Shanghai team got the favorable end of the field, which was a help from heaven. Three minutes into the game, the Chinese United team's momentum was strong. Chen Guangyao got a corner kick, almost scoring. Feng Jingxiang and Li Huitang echoed each other, attacking fiercely forward. However, Zhou Xianyan was in front of the goal, and there was nothing they could do. Zhou repeatedly cleared the ball from danger, earning great applause. The Shanghai team's defenders, Martin and Munro, also performed well. The Shanghai team defended strictly, and at the first opportunity, launched a counterattack with all their strength. The Chinese United team became exhausted from running. However, Bao's iron gate was there, and the first half ended in a tie.</p>
<p>▲ Defender Injured... Shanghai Team Wins</p>
<p>The two teams were evenly matched in the first half. After changing ends, the Chinese United team's momentum was still strong. Unfortunately, defender Liu Mao was injured at this point. Although he defended against the enemy in pain, it had a significant impact. Eight minutes into the second half, the Shanghai team's left winger Graham scored a goal. The Chinese United team did not give up. Tan Jiangbai worked hard to defend against the enemy, and the forwards attacked with all their might. Feng and the other generals coordinated well, putting the Shanghai team in danger many times, but the goddess of fortune was not in Hong Kong. The iron gate was never broken, and the result was 1-0, Shanghai won.</p>
<p>▲ Rewarding Merit... Xianyan's First Contribution</p>
<p>In terms of skill, the Shanghai team's talent was average. The defenders and the goal were a natural match. Gush in the center was stationed in the central plains. The forward to be recommended is Sinclair. Although there were occasional mistakes, the merits outweighed the demerits. In terms of rewarding merit, the first contribution should be credited to the iron gate, Zhou Xianyan. For the Chinese United team, Bao's iron gate was also an excellent skill. Liu Mao was also good. Tan Jiangbai's skills seem to be able to improve further. Liang Xianzun was the best of the center defenders. The forwards to be recommended are Feng and Li. Li Huitang himself has already become a master. Sun Jin, Gu Chen Guangyao and Ye Beihua also did not lose their heroic character.</p>

<h3 id="e101">The Veritable Proof of Gold as Dung: Tao Zaidong <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>My friend, the boxing master Qian Yantang, is skilled in poetry. This past spring, after a heavy snowfall, he climbed to a high vantage point and gazed upon the snowscape of the Huangpu River. He penned the line: "No wonder the golden tide surges upward, before my eyes is a silver sea and a silver river." When he recounted this to me, I praised his wit. This led to a discussion about the value of gold versus silver, and touched upon the ancient saying that gold is like dung. Mr. Qian mentioned that during the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year of the late Qing dynasty, he sought refuge in Baiyang Village, Yizhou. The atmosphere there was simple and unsophisticated, practically a paradise. It was said that during the Ming Dynasty, loyalty to the nation was highly valued. When Li Chuang became emperor, and the Qing army entered the pass, with Shunzhi ascending the throne, the village remained utterly ignorant. The village performed theatrical plays as usual, only stopping when the official proclamations arrived. For over two hundred years, until the Gengzi year of the Qing dynasty, the village remained as secluded as ever. At that time, a Prince Mou Bela also came to this village to avoid disaster. One day, his wife brought out a gold ingot and ordered the eunuch to exchange it with the villagers for tens of thousands of copper coins for daily use. The ingot weighed slightly over one tael. After inquiring throughout the village, no one was willing to exchange it. The eunuch was greatly astonished and repeatedly lamented the "great change in the hearts of the people of Cuiping Mountain" before leaving. At that time, several manure collectors were seen carrying their baskets, slowly approaching. There was a rural market nearby, the simplest form of exchange.</p>
<p>At the market, peasant households negotiated prices with manure collectors, each obtaining a certain number of thousands of coins for their baskets of fertilizer. They used the money to buy wine and meat. Mr. Qian personally witnessed this scene. He then reflected that the world is nothing more than a matter of "need". If there is a need, then dung is like gold. If there is no need, then gold is like dung. How can the current "golden tide" be an exception to the rule of need?</p>

<p>My neighbor is a family named Xu, whose residence is called Huaizu Hall. To the west of their dwelling, the master of the house is named Xiaoxia. His family fortune has declined, and his descendants are dwindling. However, in their room, they still have a sculpted image of the master, as perfect as new, as if one were conversing with him in person.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Remodeling Doctor: ·Shadow·Fool <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>I recall one or two years ago, this newspaper published a daily, lengthy comic strip. In the beginning, there was a character called the Remodeling Doctor, a humorous figure that brought peals of laughter. Surprisingly, in America today, there actually exists a Remodeling Doctor. According to news from New York, at the Biology Research Institute of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, a group of biologists, all holding doctoral degrees, are engaged in research to remodel the human race. They hope that in the future, humanity will be more intelligent and physically stronger than it is today, and that lifespan will also be longer. Furthermore, this method has been proven through various experiments and is nearing the point of realization. When these doctors remodel humanity in the future, they will truly be worthy of the title "Remodeling Doctor."</p>
<p>The image is less than a foot tall, but it sits upright in proper attire, its whiskers and eyebrows lifelike, and one can almost hear it cough. Truly, only a divine hand could create such a wonderful creation, displaying the marvels of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>At the time this image was created, there was also Ge Shuliu of Nanli, whose image is still kept in a shrine. They open a room to change his clothes regularly, imagining his voice, laughter, and appearance, which leads to feelings of melancholy. Therefore, his image still exists today, even after more than thirty years, without the slightest bit of wear or damage. While it may be attributed to the embodiment of his spirit, it is also the ultimate expression of art.</p>
<p>I heard that the person who created these two images came from Wumen. He was heavily addicted to opium and slept soundly every day, not waking up until late at night. Therefore, his artistic endeavors were only carried out late at night in the quiet hours, accompanied by the flickering light of the opium lamp. It so happened that both the Xu and Ge families shared the same addiction, which made them even more congenial. Few others knew about this. Therefore, even today, no one knows the artist's name. I have repeatedly inquired among the elders, but no one can name him. It is truly regrettable that such a person's name has been lost.</p>
<p>However, it is said that when creating the images, he used a type of extremely pliable clay. He would sit opposite the person and, after gazing for a long time, his hands would begin to knead under the table while chatting and laughing normally, without revealing what he was creating. Initially, he would not show it to anyone. This went on for more than ten days before the image was completed. Those who saw it were greatly amazed, some suspecting that he possessed some secret knowledge. When I was young, I heard from my neighbor, Mr. Xu, that this person was fond of literature, especially skilled in calligraphy, adept at painting, and occasionally entertained himself with the qin. He was a nobleman's son. I wonder if anyone in Wuzhong can recognize him today. Someone with such accomplishments must have left his mark in more than just our county.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Mourning Dreams and Entrusting Sadness in Songnan: Zizai <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>"Feeling the past, I am now a person who mourns dreams. Do not let fleeting events be like the dust of the past. The heavenly realm of Tushita and the land of immortals, I fear Shuangcheng will be reborn as someone else." These are the verses inscribed by Zhuzhen Zhuang on the "Mourning Dreams in Songnan" painting. The "Mourning Dreams in Songnan" scroll was created by Zheng Wuchang after Wei Yibing passed away in Singapore, re-creating the nostalgic feelings of Hong Shusheng towards Qing Hu. The vastness of the sea and sky is exceptionally desolate and cold. Jin Xihou (Liang) wrote the title, and Yao Mangfu, Liu Yazi, Pan Lanshi, Zhang Daqian, Xie Yucen, and others wrote inscriptions. Mangfu used the "Narcissus" melody with the "Breaking Cassia Branch" Yuer music to write, "The spiritual rhinoceros always relies on the spring cuckoo. Butterflies gone, flowers fly, another year. Search everywhere in the painting. Facing the cold Song, count the fallen joys. The ripples are still rippling slowly. The alliance is empty. People are worthy of love. The soul is not far away. The wind is rotating. Vaguely under the moon, before the stars. Vaguely under the moon, before the stars. No more than the ethereal landscape painting of Yingqiu. Even if you understand the Zen of love, you still have not finished the mortal affairs. The depth of sorrow measured by the river and the sea. The river is like life before. The sea is separated from the sky. Sorrow gathers at the tip of the pen. How can it be like the river that can be overturned? The sea can also be filled." When the woman died in the southern border, Shi was in Hanyang doing politics. After hearing the news, she was dazed. She personally inscribed the stele and sent it to be planted on the grave. She also collected six chapters of Ding'an's poems to express her grief and hatred.</p>
<p>The poem says: "A short farewell to the lake and mountains outside the catastrophe. How many years will the seven stars repay me? Will the nine springs accept the praise of a madman? Daoyun's debating skills do not fall short of Quanquan. Slightly like riding a luan bird, drifting away. It is difficult to measure celestial beings with the naked eye. A hundred generations of ordinary people criticize me. Art is like a needle to the spirit, a face like Luoshen. Suddenly, I feel the years in the eastern mountains. I sealed my red tears and asked to return the car. Why use the heavenly flowers to protect the bell? It turns into spring mud to protect the flowers even more. I have failed both the flute and the sword. The wind, the luan, the crane, the mandarin ducks, three lifetimes. Only the Buddha understands the hard work. May the hatred of the sea be flattened one day. The fate of words is as deep as flesh and blood. The small screen, the red candle, talks about Dongxin. Writing books is not for cinnabar and lead. I have troubled you thousands of times to sing about Shanghai. The melody is touching and touching the spirits. After experiencing the catastrophe, the elixir is not completed. Gazing from afar, the night in the Central Plains. What other way to send this life." The mournful and bitter tune, as if hearing her voice.</p>
<p>The year before last, Shi was thirty years old. The woman sent a seven-character ancient poem, filled with blood and tears, which she could not bear to finish reading. However, the sincerity and inspiration of the two people are fully revealed in the words. The poem says: "Every year today is your birthday. I hate that I have no chance to sing the Nine Songs. What will I say when life reaches this point? After nine deaths, there is much regret. Counting the years, three years have become strangers. The southwest is blocked, how painful. Thinking of you a hundred times a day, my body is like a moth flying to the lamp. Sighing that fate is as thin as autumn leaves, lamenting the decline of the times, what can I change. From now on, I will understand the reason for karma. I will learn the ways of the monk from the plum blossoms on Mount Hua." It is heard that the woman left behind two volumes each of "Dream Non-Collection" poems and lyrics. Shi will collect and carve them, and distribute them to friends, hoping to repay the deceased in some small way.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Ancient Books and Fengmu of China That I Have Seen <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>I recently read in "Free Talk" that the Yang family of Liaocheng, who owned the Haiyuan Pavilion collection, are unable to preserve it, and some of it has already flowed overseas. I secretly lament the daily demise of ancient books in our country. I also saw that someone was trying to sell a copy of the Song Dynasty edition of Han Changli's collection for 100,000 yuan. The price can be said to be enormous. The books that I have seen, while not as expensive as this, are still considerable in number. We poor scholars are already speechless upon hearing of them.</p>
<p>Years ago, I accepted an invitation from Mr. Wu of the same town to teach his children in Beiping. Mr. Wu's name was Jingci, styled Hengsun. His father was the manager of the Beiping HSBC Bank, so he had lived there for a long time. Mr. Wu had studied engineering in England. After returning to China, he served as an engineer on the Jingfeng Railway. Later, he returned home due to his father's death. Because his father had already accumulated wealth, he did not go out again. He was extremely fond of antiquity. He collected many antiques, calligraphy, and paintings, and ancient books were also one of them. When he bought ancient books, he had experts such as Li Mutang to appraise them, so he was never deceived. When I was in Beiping, someone wanted to sell a Song Dynasty edition of "Tang Wencui" and a Ming Dynasty edition of "Lou Gongkui's Collection" for 10,000 yuan. After Li appraised it, he paid the full amount. Mr. Wu showed me the two books. I saw that the paper of "Wencui" was very dark, and the margins at the top, bottom, and sides were not very wide. The last few volumes of the "Lou Collection" were incomplete and were supplemented with manuscript copies. I secretly wondered if the price was too high. However, according to Li, this 10,000 yuan was only enough to pay for the "Wencui" alone. The "Lou Collection" could only be considered a gift. Later, someone wanted to sell a Song Dynasty edition of "Li Shan's Commentary on the Selections of Refined Literature" for 6,000 yuan. I saw that the paper was as white as new, and the printing was also excellent. I thought that the paper and printing of "Wencui" were not as good as this, yet it was worth 10,000 gold. Therefore, this one asking for 6,000 yuan should not be considered expensive. After Li's appraisal, he said that although this book was good, there were many copies of it in China. As for the "Tang Wencui" that was purchased earlier, as far as he knew, only this one copy remained in the country. Even the Haiyuan Pavilion collection, which was known for its vastness, did not have this book. I then sighed that appraising ancient books was not easy. If it is not a book that currently exists in the country, and the actual number is known for sure, then its value cannot be determined. This further shows how precious this "Wencui" book is. Because I am concerned about the Yang family's situation, I have written this article. I hope that Mr. Wu and his descendants will protect it well and preserve one of the quintessence of our country.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: The Art of Maintaining Youth: Emerald Blackened Eyebrows; The Desperate Search for Longevity: Golden Market for Horse Bones</p>
<p>Ye Tonghou pulled Hua Yuanchun to a pavilion in the back. He said, "Old Six, I just heard you say that you need to find a way to get money for travel expenses. Is the money you have enough for this trip?" Old Six said, "I'm trying to find a way. I think I can get some money from the little sisters." Ye Tonghou said, "How much do you need?" Old Six said, "Once I get to Beijing, I can get money from the big belly, Ah Jin. It's just the travel expenses on the way. Two or three hundred yuan should be enough." Ye Tonghou said, "Then I'll give it to you. Or, you can bring some food from the South as gifts for people. Take a hundred yuan first. I'll bring the other two hundred yuan tomorrow night." Old Six said, "No, Third Master, how can I take your money for no reason? Just take care of me a little when you get to Beijing. I've already talked to the new sister-in-law and asked her to borrow three hundred yuan. The interest is only four cents. Fortunately, once I get to Beijing, I can find a way to send it back." Ye Tonghou said, "Why bother? I'll be coming to Beijing soon. Can't you pay me back in Beijing? Or, you just don't want to use my money. You have to know that I don't have any other intentions." Hua Lao Liu said, "Third Master, you're so good to me, how can I not be grateful to you? Since that's the case, it saves me the trouble of finding a way elsewhere. It's all my fault for being so unclear-headed and so whimsical. If I don't do well in Beijing this time, I'll die in Beijing and never come back to the South." Ye Tonghou said, "Old Six, why do you have to say such final words? Sooner or later, everyone will die. Death is a road that everyone must go through. What's the difference between dying in Beijing and dying in Shanghai? A person is like a bird, flying to where it nests. When the sudden death comes, you just have to follow him. You say you'll die in Beijing, but who knows if I, Ye San, won't die in Beijing? We revolutionaries see death as insignificant. People who live long are just like living in a hotel, staying a few more days. There are also those mediocre people who seem to have come to the world for nothing, just for fun." Hua Yuanchun said, "We women should die even earlier. I think being an old woman is very boring." This made Ye Tonghou laugh. The next night, Ye Tonghou brought another two hundred yuan. This was an act of kindness in a time of need. Hua Yuanchun was naturally very grateful to Ye San, which saved him from having to find a way elsewhere. In fact, what Lao Liu had just said about entrusting the new sister-in-law was just a thought in his own mind. Hua Lao Liu was a master of wild talk. People always had some doubts about lending him money, just like the warlords borrowing foreign debt. Even if they said it nicely, what kind of industrial debt, financial debt, as soon as the money was in hand, it was sent to who knows where. Therefore, it was necessary to have solid collateral. Hua Lao Liu's borrowing was the same as the warlords' borrowing, and he was not in Shanghai. The words of the new sister-in-law were a bit unreliable.</p>

<h3 id="e107">The Financial Gold Market Rises and Falls Rapidly <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ Hovering Around Seventy Taels: Yesterday's gold market was complex, with erratic rises and falls. The morning and noon were firm, with a difference of fifteen taels. The afternoon fluctuations were also small, fluctuating between eight and nine taels. The overall market hovered around seven hundred and seventy taels. The psychology of the industry remains hesitant, with varying demands and supplies. Qian Changxiang, Yuan Maoyong, and Heng Xingyuan all bought in the early market. Zhifengshui, Hengxing, and Yuantai all sold out. The foreign exchange slightly weakened, with the listed price lengthening by half a notch, likely due to a rebound in overseas silver markets. The gold price opened lower, breaking seventy taels. Later, the market rose and fell rapidly. At noon, the exchange rate tightened, and major players like Qian Changxiang and Yuan Maoyong competed to buy, causing the price to soar to eighty taels. In an instant, it turned from strong to weak. News of a work stoppage at American silver mines quickly sent the price down, falling sharply by four to five taels. The market initially stabilized and then declined again, presenting a gentle trend. Trading was uneven within the market, with exchange rates fluctuating. In the end, the price was between seventy-six taels. The spot price required an additional six and a half taels.</p>
<p>▲ The Opening Price Dropped 7.5 Taels: The April opening price dropped by 7.5 taels to 768.5 taels, likely due to a sudden 1/16 rebound in the long position, 1/8 in the forward position, and 1/4 in the silver price. Citibank bought, and private buying also added 3/16. Then, with Tong Taichang, Qian Changxiang, and others buying, the price rose to 72.5 taels. Suddenly, Hongli, Zhifengyong, Yongfeng, and Chang sold off, causing a sharp drop of over six taels to 65.8 taels. Later, the buying side seemed diligent, and sellers decreased, so the price rose again by four to five taels, to about 70 taels. The initial announcement showed an increase of 125, US$25, US$25, and the Japanese gold fell by 1.5 points, but this was not affected, as the internal market was stable. Banks absorbed £123,75. At this time, the price rebounded to 74.7 taels. Not long after, Wanxing, Shunli, and Yuan came to sell, depreciating by more than five taels. After 10:00 AM, the price was 69.5 taels. Then, Qian Changxiang, Heng Xingyuan, Yuan Maoyong, and others bought in, suddenly presenting a peak, surging by eight taels. However, there were fluctuations of two taels up and down. At 10:40 AM, when the price was 77.5 taels, it then fell by more than three taels.</p>
<p>▲ Soaring Rapidly at Noon: After 11:00 AM, the price soared into the clouds due to large players like Qian Changxiang, Chang Shengyong, Yuan Maoyong, and certain speculators buying in, jumping by six to seven taels. At noon, the price was 81 taels. Almost at the close, the price was 79.5 taels. When goods were sold, the price briefly soared to over 81 taels, then softened again to 75-76 taels due to Zhifengyong and others selling out.</p>
<p>It was also heard that news of a work stoppage at silver mines abroad caused panic. The middle price was 833.4 taels, with a difference of 62-63 taels to 53-54 taels.</p>
<p>▲ The Closing Price was Moderate, the Same as Before: The afternoon opened at 76 taels. Continued at five taels, and because the Indian exchange rate reported a low of twelve annas, and there were many buyers, Yuan Maoyong, Heng, etc. bought in, so the price rose to 78.5 taels. Later, the exchange rate eased, and with Hongli, Juyu, and others selling out, and the rumor of a large return of the Indian exchange rate, the price gradually fell, by as much as seven or eight taels. At 3:15 PM, the price was only 69.5 taels. Chang still had a strong buying interest, and at 3:30 PM, the price was raised by four taels, to 70 taels and two or three cents. Then, it retreated by more than one tael. At 4:00 PM, the market suddenly showed an upward trend, as the demand on the floor exceeded the supply. However, the trend of British gold, etc. was stable. Until 4:20 PM, and others also entered, the price rose to 77.5 taels. Hengxing slightly sold out, suppressing a small amount, to 776 taels. The closing price was the same as the previous day. Later, the price was raised again, to about 75 taels. The daily high price was 81 taels, and the low price was 65.8 taels, a difference of 15.2 taels.

<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets suddenly reported an increase, likely due to buying in the evening market in America.

The trend in the gold market was chaotic, and people were confused. At the close, compared with the previous day, British gold lengthened by 0.0625, American gold lengthened by 0.125, and Japanese gold fell by 0.875. Chinese merchants still sold out, but the trading was not as prosperous as the previous day. The turnover of British gold was over 100,000 pounds. Banks such as Maihang, Xingye, and Yanjiang all bought in, and Zhengquan slightly sold out. American gold had a buying appetite from Datong and had a turnover of over 200,000 yuan. However, Guangdong merchants Shengda bought to hedge gold. Japanese gold was bought by Chinese merchants for several hundred thousand yuan, sold by Japanese and Korean merchants.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market price was still 7 cents, 2 points, 3 mils, and 2.5 haos. However, the transaction volume of checks and transfers was huge, mainly due to the large-scale settlement of securities for the month.

<h3 id="e112">Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn and Cotton Market Quiet on Settlement Day <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was slightly stable, with a firm trend.  Certain military merchants remained resolute, showing no intention of easing, and were supported by many others.  However, spot yarn sales became increasingly sluggish, with no activity from any of the trading houses.  As a result, the inventory remained large, leading some to short the market.  Nevertheless, exchange rates were difficult to shift, cotton prices could not be loosened, and the season was still at its peak, so there was no downward trend in the short term. Futures yarn trading was suspended for one day due to month-end settlement matters.  Spot yarn business remained stagnant, with total purchases by all trading houses estimated at only 200 bales for the day.  Dealers brought in 35 bales, and out-of-town traders brought in 65 bales from the interior, 45 bales from Guangdong, 15 bales from Tianjin, 20 bales from Xiamen, and 25 bales from Shantou.  The spot cotton market was slightly stable, but overseas cotton markets showed a downward trend, and gold prices remained firm.  It was reported that India was considering increasing taxes on cotton exports, which would greatly affect the Shanghai cotton market.  The sources included 600 bales of Yao cotton for the Kaitongzhou factory at a price of 14.5 taels, purchased by Yongyu Factory for immediate delivery.</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially fell due to selling pressure, then strengthened due to support from Wall Street, but ultimately weakened again due to selling in New Orleans. Overall, prices fell by 2 to 8 points. UK cotton futures fell 5-6 points, and spot prices fell 13 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 15 points. Indian cotton weakened due to poor opening prices in Liverpool, with Pingle short-term and long-term contracts falling 6 rupees, Oomra falling 5 rupees for near term and 6 rupees for deferred, and Broach falling 6 rupees for near term and 7 rupees for deferred.

<p>▲Settlement volume reached 13,250 bales</p>
<p>The February yarn settlement took place at the beginning of the month, coinciding with the end of the lunar year.  All the trading houses had completely ceased spot purchases as they closed their books, so the market was expected to decline. Prices hovered around 57 taels. Later, due to soaring gold prices, fluctuating exchange rates, and a turnaround in the Indian political situation, Indian cotton prices rose, and raw cotton prices steadily increased. As a result, the yarn market, being closely related, rose as well.  The market closed for six days for the Lunar New Year holiday at a price of 170 taels and 0.08 yuan. This spring, when the market reopened, prices jumped by over 5 taels due to rising foreign cotton prices. Yarn prices increased dramatically.  Buyers and sellers were deadlocked, and buying interest was extremely strong. To avoid risks, the exchange increased the special cash deposit for each newly purchased lot by 50 taels. At the same time, the exchange bought several thousand bales of 10-count coarse yarn from various factories and sold them short in near and distant months, which slightly reduced the heat. The 20th day passed relatively calmly, with the market closing at 8:30 PM. Only one round of cotton yarn trading occurred, but the situation remained tight. Due to reports that the United States would support silver prices, the gold market eased slightly.  In the afternoon, the market fell by 4-5 taels, but soon cotton prices rose again, and a certain industrialist showed great enthusiasm for higher prices, exclusively purchasing domestic yarn in the last few days in preparation for receiving the goods.  Although sellers had sufficient supply for delivery, they could not reduce the buying pressure, demonstrating the strong attitude of buyers. The last day of the month was the 26th, with prices soaring by 6.6 taels. The highest price was 178.4 taels, and the lowest was 155 taels.  The difference within this month was 23.4 taels, a significant fluctuation. Spot yarn sales in the market were quite sluggish, with no excitement from any of the trading houses, due to high prices and slow sales. However, as the season is still at its spring peak, there is still hope for future development. The settlement volume was very high, totaling 13,250 bales. Among these, 9,250 bales were transferred through self-settlement, and only 4,000 bales were actually delivered. These included 550 bales of 20-count Shepherd, 2,250 bales of Five Blessings, 50 bales of 16-count Globe, 200 bales of Red Dragon, 450 bales of 10-count Three Sheep, 200 bales of Double Sheep, and 300 bales of Globe. The three-day price difference was 173 taels. The names of the brokers and their company names for both delivery and receipt are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e115">Summary of This Month's Cotton Settlement <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>▲Quantity: 21,500 Dan (1 Dan equals 100 catties)</p>
<p>▲Shaanxi "Fire Machine" cotton was the most prevalent grade</p>
<p>February's settlement opened at 37 taels. The market was closed for six days due to the Lunar New Year holiday. During this period, the political situation in India improved, Gandhi was released, and European commerce showed some recovery. Therefore, Indian cotton prices rose sharply, gold prices soared, and exchange rates declined. Consequently, the silver-based calculation of foreign cotton became remarkably expensive. Speculators generally anticipated that the domestic cotton supply would be insufficient and foreign cotton imports would be unfeasible, which would inevitably drive up market prices. At the same time, buyers flocked to the market, and Japanese merchants aggressively purchased cotton, creating an extremely tight situation. On the 20th, both buyers and sellers were deadlocked. Sellers began to exhibit signs of panic. Later, the exchange authorities intervened to maintain stability, and Japanese merchants sold large quantities, which stabilized the market. The exchange increased the special cash deposit for each newly purchased load by 20 taels to reduce trading and avoid risks. Towards the end of the month, the dramatic rise in gold prices and the strength of Indian cotton led to prices reaching as high as 46 taels. The highest price for February was 45 taels. Total deliveries amounted to 21,500 dan. Shaanxi Fire Machine cotton was the most common grade delivered. The average price difference over the three delivery days was 44.5 taels. Self-deliveries accounted for a significant portion. The broker names and their respective company names for both receiving and delivering parties are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e116">Grains: Rice Market Gradually Declining <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲Northern粳rice Shows a Precipitous Fall</p>
<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday, sources from more than twenty locations arrived at the river, and the inventory in the river accumulated due to sluggish sales for several days, making shopkeepers hesitant to purchase. Northern white rice shows a precipitous fall, and the price has dropped another 10 cents. The price of 13 yuan per bag of rice may be considered the ceiling of the market. The supply of rice has slightly decreased and the interest in small amounts of rice is decreasing but buyers are pessimistic, leading to a sluggish appearance. Prices are similarly soft to Doo Tip rice. Small sales are sluggish and few small quantity transactions are occurring. The fixed-price contracts are weakened and the spot market is weak, with the most special grade barely opening at 12.20 yuan.</p>
<p>▲South Shanghai: Yesterday, about twenty boats were seen coming downriver. This area's sales are sluggish. The fundamentals of the market can be considered to have reached the low level because there is little interest in buying. The top grade of first-harvest short-grain rice has slightly increased, but everything else has decreased by 15 cents. The trend of Yangdu Tip is unfavorable, and retail sales have fallen by about 10 cents. Fixed-price contracts have weakened and the market has been shaded by lack of supply. The opening price of the special grade has been fixed at 10.50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Flour and Wheat Plunge in Unison <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>▲The Impact of Foreign Wheat… Selling Pressure Remains Fierce</p>
<p>▲Flour: Yesterday, the flour market plummeted in the morning and afternoon sessions. This was because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell sharply. At this point, the initial hopes of buyers vanished like smoke. The large factories continued their multiple sales, and the amateur investors, who initially thought that flour and wheat prices would rise because of tight foreign exchange, had a seemingly reasonable surface-level justification, but trading at the exchange has no fixed standard, and most trading relies purely on leverage. Now that the sellers are mainly factory owners, the power of outside forces is inevitably controlled. The market was exceptionally weak all day due to extensive short-selling by outsiders. As a result, this month's contracts fell 3.5 cents compared to the previous day, March contracts fell 2.75 cents, April-May contracts fell 2.25 cents, and June-July contracts fell 3 cents.</p>
<p>▲Wheat: Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, contracts for all months showed sharp declines. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell by a huge 50-70 cents, which greatly shocked people. Selling pressure was extremely strong for a while, and contracts for all months fell in unison again. The market's trend is that the sellers have foreign wheat prepared, and in fact they disregard whether prices rise or fall. Because when the delivery period arrives, inventory must be available, and one needs to buy in order to pass smoothly. This is the reality and cannot be ignored. If the price of foreign wheat continues to fall step by step, then future fluctuations may again see the low prices of the previous month. As to deferred contracts, the mood was very weak, and people's hearts were greatly softened. As a result, the March contract fell 5 cents from the previous day, the April contract fell 10 cents, the May contract fell 6 cents, the June contract fell 8 cents, and the July contract fell 6 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Silk and Tea: White Filature Silk Bought by British and American Firms to Cover Short Positions <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was difficult for the Shanghai foreign firm silk market to recover. Sales to France remained stagnant, and there were few telegrams to Shanghai from Lyon and other places. Although British and American firms bought white filature silk to cover their short positions, manufacturers were reluctant to sell due to losses, making it difficult for transactions to proceed smoothly. Yesterday, only Ganli and others purchased 60 bales of Shanghai white filature silk, and prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Brisk Trading in Fine Grade Green Tea Continues <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign firm tea market, British and American firms showed strong interest in Road Brand fine grade green tea. Over 500 chests were traded throughout the city at selling prices ranging from 48 to 53 taels. Market prices remained quite firm. Both Tianxiang and Fulin firms needed Tribute grade tea, but inventories were low and supply could not meet demand. There were still over 2,000 chests of Keemun black tea in stock, but due to their inferior quality, they were not suitable for sales, and the market was completely stagnant.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Piece Goods: Sales Turn Quiet After Sharp Price Increase <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲Native Cotton Cloth: Lately, the market price fluctuates. Fine cloth is slightly softer than before with prices down by about 5 cents, mainly due to overly high prices and also because it is the end of the month. Yesterday, Yanghe brand blue Shuangyu, Laba, and Tongyi were priced at 7.70 taels, Blue Flying Fish at 7.90 taels, and Blue Chicken at 7.50 taels. However, Jinshan Tower bleached cloth rose instead, selling yesterday at 9.60 taels. Both Ningbo and Tianjin merchant guilds have made sales. Eighty-four plain cloth is in great demand in this neighborhood with over 100 pieces sold. Blue Flying Fish small package is priced at 6.10 taels, and Tiaowu is priced at 6 taels. The price of Yihua coarse cloth has not yet been quoted. Sixteen thread cloth is slightly looser, with Green Letter priced at 7.90 taels, Five Crane at 7.85 taels, and San Yuanbao at 7.25 taels. Fifteen-pound Four Horses is priced at 7.15 taels. All these are small package prices. Prices will be additionally raised when it leaves the factory.</p>
<p>▲Eastern and Western Piece Goods: The market is softer, mainly because the opening prices are too high, causing buyers to hesitate. Moreover, there is still a large quantity of high-priced goods purchased in the previous year in hand, so the price is gradually falling. Yesterday, Zhigong flannel sold at 4.075 cents, Moganshan at 4.025 cents, Yipin Fugui at 3.825 cents, and Shuangtong at 3.60 cents. The price of fine Serge is falling even more rapidly. Huxinting has already fallen from 3.75 cents to 3.60 cents, Huanxi at 3.575 cents, and Sanyoutu at 3.55 cents. Zhigong satin has fallen the fastest for First Grade, selling yesterday at 3.725 cents. However, the quoted prices by traders have not yet fallen, as gold prices are still quite high, so they remain optimistic. Western goods have also been affected due to slight price drops.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Domestic Railways Affected by Rising Gold Prices <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲Financial Difficulties of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</p>
<p>The domestic railways have been greatly affected by the sharp rise in gold prices, which has led to a sudden increase in the cost of materials and the amount of principal and interest on foreign debts. Last year, gold prices rose by only one-third compared to the previous year, and the financial situation of the railways was already difficult to sustain. Now that gold prices have suddenly more than doubled, the financial difficulties have reached their peak. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway is close to the capital, and the situation is more certain and well-informed. Therefore, the details of the railway's financial situation this year are listed to inform those who are concerned about domestic railway administration.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway's operating conditions have always been stable. However, since last year, due to the sharp rise in gold prices, the operating income has been insufficient to offset the losses caused by gold prices, and the financial situation has deteriorated. In May of last year, the railway was due to repay 116,000 pounds of maturing foreign debt principal. Since it was impossible to pay, the Ministry of Railways had to find ways to raise funds to pay for the 69,000 pounds of interest due in the second half of the year. The difficulty of the situation can be imagined. This year, gold prices are even more expensive than last year, and overdue and maturing domestic and foreign debt principal and interest are again approaching. The financial situation is unsustainable. The estimated amount to be paid by the railway this year includes the following items: (1) Foreign debt principal of 116,000 pounds due in May 1930, equivalent to approximately 2,552,000 yuan; (2) Foreign debt principal of 116,000 pounds due in May 1931, equivalent to approximately 2,552,000 yuan; (3) Foreign debt interest of 69,774 pounds due in May 1931, equivalent to approximately 1,535,000 yuan; (4) Foreign debt interest of 69,774 pounds due in November 1931, equivalent to approximately 1,535,000 yuan; (5) Outstanding profit to the Sino-British Company of 398,839 silver yuan; (6) Silver yuan 1,200,000 for the Ministry of Railways to raise funds for the second half of 1930 foreign debt interest; (7) Outstanding payment for various materials, totaling 1,079,555 silver yuan; (8) Repayment of the price of newly purchased locomotives of 117,000 pounds, equivalent to approximately 2,574,000 yuan. The total payment for the above eight items is over 13 million yuan. In addition, operating expenses are approximately 800,000 yuan per month, totaling 10 million yuan for the whole year. Including the previous eight items, the total expenditure is no less than 23 million yuan. The railway's operating income is only 13 million yuan per year, with a shortfall of over 10 million yuan. If this 10 million yuan is only addressed by thriftiness and no other means are found to increase income, the railway's operation will inevitably face bankruptcy. It is also heard that the railway's recent deposits are very small, and daily expenses are often stretched thin. The above is the situation of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Other railways are roughly the same. It is heard that the Ministry of Railways' Business Operations Conference will open soon. It is hoped that the conference will not neglect this major issue and will quickly develop appropriate methods to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Important Talk by Zhang Qun <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲Wu Peifu Has No Recent Activities</p>
<p>▲Election Office Will Start Operations Immediately</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang returned to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper met with him at the Municipal Government and asked him about the inside story of the Sichuan situation and other questions. According to Zhang, the central government has finalized the measures for Sichuan and appointed the provincial government members, which has been reported in detail.</p>
<p>▲Troops Stationed in Southern Shaanxi: Liu Cunhou's and Tian Songyao's troops never left Sichuan. Tian only sent personnel to incorporate the remnants of Feng Jun's troops in Shaanxi. The defense of southern Shaanxi was extremely weak, but I met with Yang Hucheng's representatives in Beijing, who said that Yang had sent one division and two brigades to station in southern Shaanxi. Wu Peifu is under the protection of Liu Cunhou's forces, has no command ability, and has no activities. The previous rumors that he would be invited to Beijing were not true.</p>
<p>▲Gongfa Board of Directors: Regarding the Riyue Bank incident, Zhang said that the municipal government found it difficult to proceed because the opinions of the creditors were inconsistent. Finally, it was decided to entrust four lawyers to voluntarily participate in the litigation for the creditors to maintain their legal rights. Since then, the creditors have not had any contact with the municipal government. The reporter then asked about reports of Yu Qiaqing's remarks that the roster of directors and shareholders of Gongfa Company had been handed over to the municipal government for safekeeping. He replied, "I just returned to Shanghai from Beijing and have not contacted anything. But no matter what, the directors of Gongfa should bear unlimited liability."</p>
<p>▲Preparing for Elections: Zhang also said that the Shanghai Election Office for National Assembly Representatives has been established, and the General Affairs Section has already started working. All internal tasks will be started on March 2nd. Internally, it is divided into three sections: the director of the General Affairs Section is concurrently held by secretary Li Dachao, the director of the Review Section is Feng Liutang, and the director of the Registration Section is Chen Bai.</p>
<p>▲Rumors of Trip to Japan: Recently, the Japanese side has been spreading rumors that Zhang will be appointed as the ambassador to Japan. The reporter asked about this yesterday. Zhang said that this rumor has been circulating for a long time and is absolutely untrue. It is even more ridiculous that the former chief of public security, Yuan Liang, will go to Japan to take up a post. Yuan was sent to Japan by the municipal government to investigate police administration and has no other mission.</p>
<p>▲Long-Term Police Savings: When the former chief of public security, Yuan, was in office, he established the Long-Term Police Savings program, entrusted to Jincheng Bank for safekeeping. It has been in operation for a year, with a balance of tens of thousands of taels. Later, due to difficulties in managing it, the program was terminated after Yuan stepped down, but the funds have not yet been returned. Yesterday, Zhang said that the funds need to be settled by Jincheng Bank before they can be returned. Yuan repeatedly stated when handing over his duties that the funds can be returned recently.</p>

They are expected to arrive at 10 a.m. this morning. Lampson plans to stay in Beijing for a week and meet with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to continue discussions on the Sino-British extraterritoriality issue. At the same time, he plans to visit American Ambassador Johnson in Beijing to exchange views. After some progress is made, he will return to Peiping.</p>

<p>▲ Attending Representatives Travel to the Capital Together</p>

<h3 id="e126">Population Statistics for the Public Concession Last Year <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲ 113,920 People per Square Mile</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession recently released population density statistics for the Public Concession for the past year, showing 113,920 people per square mile. According to the Council's report, the current population of the Public Concession is approximately one million, and is expected to increase to 1.5 million in fifteen years. The statistical report stated that based on the area of the central and northern districts of the Public Concession, the population density is 325 and a half per acre, or 209,650 per square mile. This record exceeds the population density of the most populous district of London, England, namely, Bethnal Green. Among the various districts, the eastern district has the highest population density, with 1494 people per acre. According to the Council's report, the survey method used these statistics was using the location of 46 police stations within the Public Concession as the area for calculating population density, which is more precise than the previous method of using the larger four districts as the area for calculating population density. The following table shows population statistics for the central district of the Public Concession. A comparison of last year's statistics with those from five years ago shows little change, but the methods used in the past were not very accurate or reliable. The population statistics table for the central district of the Public Concession is as follows:</p>
<p>1915 1920 1925 1930</p>
<p>Foreigners 1,649 1,574 1,583 1,867</p>
<p>Chinese 138,854 156,254 130,477 130,388</p>

<p>▲ Regarding the Transmission of Telegraphs on the Shanghai-Fuzhou-Xiamen Submarine Cable</p>
<p>On the 22nd and 24th of this month, the North-China Daily News published two news reports regarding the Fuzhou and Xiamen telegrams, which were transmitted via land lines. The language was lengthy and the tone was biased, stating that business circles in Fuzhou and Xiamen felt extremely inconvenienced after the Ministry of Communications stopped the Great Northern and Great Eastern Telegraph Companies' rights to send and receive telegrams. The China Telegraph Administration's land lines are dilapidated, the transmission speed of the telegraph stations is slow, and there is no certainty. The telegram service is delayed and unable to handle the transshipment of submarine cable telegrams, and so on. The China Telegraph Administration believed that it fabricated facts, sensationalized the news, was unlike ordinary news reports, and seemed to incite public sentiment. It was suspected of falsely exaggerating the company's power and interfering with the government's administrative powers for the sake of the company. It sent a letter to the newspaper office for correction. However, the newspaper office replied that it only agreed to publish a brief summary. The director did not agree with this and argued reasonably, but the newspaper office ignored him. It is now reported that the director will report this matter to the Ministry of Communications for investigation.</p>

<p>▲ To Inspect Party Affairs in Different Areas Starting Today</p>
<p>Zhu Jiahua, the central government-appointed inspector of party affairs in this city, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. Upon hearing the news, the members of the Municipal Party Headquarters went to welcome him. It is reported that those who came with Zhu were his entourage, Yu Sen, Cong Xiaotian, and Xiong Dansun. Starting today, they will assist Zhu in carrying out inspections and investigating party affairs in different areas.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Zhu Qinglan Arrived in Shanghai from the South <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲ To Report on the Disaster Situation in Shaanxi That He Witnessed</p>
<p>The disaster in Shaanxi is severe and rare in modern times. Zhu Qinglan, a compassionate savior, entered Shaanxi three times within the past year, braving hardships and personally going to the disaster areas and bandit-infested areas to investigate the disaster and provide relief for several months. He united with various charitable organizations and worked together to carry out various disaster relief efforts, focusing on both the symptoms and the root causes, and providing both physical and mental relief. Disaster-stricken areas such as Fufeng, Wugong, Xingping, Xianyang, Liquan, Qianxian, Qishan, and Sanyuan have benefited immensely. Last month, he returned from eastern Shaanxi to Tianjin to negotiate the transportation of materials for the drought relief Jinghui Canal project. Without rest, he went to western Liaoning to inspect the flood situation and guide winter relief efforts. On the 22nd of this month, he came south from Ping to Haizhou to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony for the Jiangbei labor relief Qiangshu River project. He will arrive in Shanghai within a day or two, with the aim of reporting the disaster situation in Shaanxi to people from all walks of life, and hoping to inspire everyone to make great efforts to complete the relief work in Shaanxi.</p>
<p>▲ Establishment of the North China Charity Federation Last spring, Zhu Qinglan, together with colleagues from various domestic charities in the north and south, escorted more than 4,000 tons of relief grain into Shaanxi to be distributed in the disaster area. Later, seeing the vastness of the disaster, he united various charity groups to establish the North China Charity Federation to work together and returned to Pingjin and Liaodong to raise urgent relief funds. People from all walks of life who personally heard Zhu's report from the disaster area enthusiastically provided assistance. During this period, more than 660,000 yuan was raised and brought to the disaster area to carry out relief efforts.</p>
<p>▲ Various Disaster Relief Efforts (1) Emergency Relief Distribution: In conjunction with the Shanghai Jisheng Association, Wutaishan Puji Buddhist Association, Xiaohui Study Society, Passionate Fengjihei Four Provinces Charity Association, and other charitable organizations, emergency relief was distributed in Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, Qishan, Qianxian, Liquan, Hancheng, Sanyuan, Pucheng, Hanzhong, and other places. (2) Seed Distribution: Corn seeds were distributed in a total of 15 counties, and wheat seeds were distributed in a total of 7 counties. (3) Relief for Women, Children, and the Elderly: Temporary shelters were set up in the disaster areas. (4) Labor Relief: Disaster victims were employed to build roads and repair bridges. (5) Preservation of Farm Tools: Loans were provided to farmers in the disaster areas to prevent farm tools from being sold as fuel. (6) Promotion of Water Conservancy: The Jinghui Canal Water Conservancy Project was jointly organized with the China Foreign Famine Relief Association. (7) Education and Support: Disaster Children's Training Institutes, Women's Weaving and Dyeing Factories, and Textile Loan Offices were established. (8) Medicine and Clothing Distribution: Epidemic prevention and cold protection. (9) Burial of Starved Corpses: More than 6,000 starved corpses in the disaster area were buried in Mei County, and more than 3,000 in Qian County. (10) Winter Relief Soup Kitchens: The North China Charity Federation has established more than a dozen soup kitchens in the disaster areas of Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, and Mei County, where approximately 40,000 people are currently receiving food every day.</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Shaanxi is severe, and universal relief is not easy. If charitable people from all over can provide more assistance, the suffering of the refugees in the disaster area will be reduced by one point. The severe winter has passed, and it is reported that wheat seedlings are growing in the fields in the disaster area, and there is hope for the future. However, at this time of year when the old harvest is exhausted and the new harvest has not yet come in, the suffering is greatest. The people of Shanghai have Zhu coming from thousands of miles away to personally describe the disaster situation in the disaster area, and after hearing it, they will surely have a way to comfort their compatriots in the disaster area of Shaanxi who are crying for food.</p>

The six companies have planned to agree on and announce it before March 5, roughly according to the original amount of at least three-tenths of the increase.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Gonghe Wheel Dispute Heard Yesterday <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tendency to Expand</p>
<p>The dispute between the old and new stewards on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Gonghe Wheel has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now the situation is gradually expanding. The reporter went to various parties yesterday and recorded the following continued news.</p>
<p>▲ Jardine Takes on Mediation Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. sent a letter to the Seamen's General Union yesterday morning, requesting that representatives be sent to the company to discuss a solution to the matter. The General Union immediately sent Chinese and English secretaries Liu Yuzhou and Li Zuyao, and worker representative Zhou Xiaoting, etc., to the company at 4 pm to negotiate with Jardine's shipping department head Ark and chief inspector Mading, etc. Jardine only agreed to reorganize the steward section of the Gonghe Wheel, but there was no result regarding the issue of removing Shen after two hours. Before the representatives went to Jardine, they first determined four requirements at the meeting: (1) Remove the compradore Shen Huating. (2) The company is responsible for resolving non-seamen. (3) The company should be responsible for compensating the losses of this dispute (ie, medical expenses, etc.). (4) In the future, the shipowner must be responsible for protecting all seamen on the ship. Seeing that Jardine had no intention of removing Shen, it was temporarily not proposed, so it broke up without results.</p>
<p>▲ Arrested Stewards Return to Shanghai A total of 24 old stewards on the ship were dragged ashore by the new steward side when they were beaten in Wuhu. Yesterday, Yang A'er, You Zhen'gui, Zhu Jinsheng, Bao Falin, Mo A'gui, Chen A'san, Zhong Jia Zhao, Chen Shunfu, Xu Delong, Xu Rongsheng, Chen Wu, Song Dingyuan, Wang Si, Wang A'sheng, Lu Lianjin, Sun A'sheng, Xu Jinshan, Song Dingxun, Jiang Aliang, Yu Wenhai, Ni Jinan, etc. returned to Shanghai on the Huangpu Baohuo two wheels. After arriving, they went to the union to report. There are still two people who have not returned to Shanghai, and the injured Yang Guisheng, Lin Shouzhi, and Wu Zeli have been sent to Tongren Hospital. It is reported that the injuries are quite serious.</p>
<p>▲ The Workers' Committee Goes to Wuhu to Thoroughly Investigate The nine new stewards, etc., who committed the crime in Wuhu have been transferred to the Wuhu Court and detained for interrogation because the police chief searched out the weapons at the scene. The Shanghai branch of the Seamen's Union, in order to understand the truth of this case, specially sent committee members Cheng Yaxin, Wang Shenxiu, Ren Shaoqing, etc. to Wuhu to conduct an on-site investigation, so as to verify the matter. Committee member Cheng, etc., left Shanghai for Wuhu last night.</p>
<p>▲ Passengers Come to Shanghai to Testify Shen Huating, compradore of Gonghe, etc., were escorted to the local court at 3 pm the day before yesterday. Yesterday, after a preliminary trial by Prosecutor Wu, he ordered Shen Huating, Wang Jinquan, and Yu Dequan to be released on bail first, and Ge Baoshu was detained. In the afternoon, the water patrol room transferred the two steward leaders, Ding Yongchang and Hu Hanzhang, to the court, and Prosecutor Wu still ordered them to be detained for interrogation. Regarding this case, the passengers on the same ship all witnessed what happened. At the moment, the eldest son of Chairman Lu of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and Chen Liquan, former member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, etc., are all willing to come forward to testify. Both of them landed in Nanjing, saying that they can be responsible for reporting to the Central Government. Passenger Lan Junheng, especially for this case, is willing to be a notary public. After coming to Shanghai, he lived in Dayun Inn at Sanyangjing Bridge, in preparation for testifying in court.</p>
<p>▲ The Union Reports to the Central Government The Seamen's General Union has reported the course of this case to the Central Government to ask for instructions. Once the reply arrives, negotiations will be made with Jardine, etc. The Shanghai Seamen's Branch also sent a fast mail telegram yesterday, announcing the ins and outs of the case to all public organizations in the country, requesting unanimous assistance and upholding justice.</p>
<p>▲ Gonghe Has Already Sailed Yesterday The Gonghe Wheel loaded cargo and passengers yesterday and sailed to Hankou. All the old stewards are still serving on the ship.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Records of the General Meeting of Various Trade Guilds in the Customs Brokerage Industry <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲ Customs Clearance for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Factories Requires Permits</p>
<p>▲ Recommend Shi Zhikun and Others to Study Business Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Transshipment Customs Brokerage Industry Association convened a meeting of various trade guilds yesterday to discuss the impact of the collection of unified taxes on cotton yarn and cotton cloth on the industry, as well as the business tax issue, etc. More than 100 representatives from more than 100 companies attended. Chairman Shi Zhikun delivered the opening speech, stating that since the Ministry of Finance started collecting unified taxes on the first day of this month, various cotton yarn and cloth factories, based on the unified tax rate regulations, no longer need to pay customs duties, so they no longer go to the customs to copy and pay for the black corner permits that they have been using. However, the customs believe that yarn merchants do not pay customs duties and do not copy permits, so they must reopen the boxes for customs inspection. Thus, the first inspection procedure at the unified tax office has already been done, and the customs want to inspect the goods again, which is extremely troublesome. In addition, the tax money filled in by the industry is huge and poses various risks. After discussion, it was agreed that this type of business is extremely dangerous, and if strict measures are not taken, the industry will suffer greatly. It was decided on the spot: (1) All goods from cotton yarn and cloth factories without permits will not be cleared on their behalf. (2) Send the above-mentioned reasons and resolutions to the Yarn Factory Federation and the Cotton Cloth Association to inform the factories to quickly complete the permit procedures. (3) From March 1, if the factory does not copy the black corner permit, in order to avoid cumbersome procedures and risks, all customs clearance will be suspended on their behalf. (4) Those who violate the above-mentioned resolutions will be fined one tael of silver per package. (5) Recommend Shi Zhikun and You Senting to visit the tax commissioner together with representatives of the business guild to state the difficulties of inspecting goods without permits and whether the inspection can be exempted. (6) Request the Unified Tax Bureau to print the customs declaration forms according to the format in the bureau and not to allow the bureau to designate someone to sell them at a higher price, so that the industry suffers more losses. Next, the issue of business tax was discussed, and more than 30 people including Shi Zhikun were appointed as specialized committee members to conduct joint research and present the results of the research to the superiors for adoption. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Dockworkers Are Allowed to Be Exempt from Business Tax <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Ministry of Finance Approves the Various Industries Tax Rules Conference</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Various Industries Tax Rules Conference notified various trade guilds yesterday: "Dear Sirs, our association previously believed that dockworkers in various industries do not engage in buying and selling activities, and it seems appropriate to exempt them from business tax to avoid duplication. After we telegraphed to report the matter for verification and handling during the cold weather, we received a fast mail telegram from the Ministry of Finance of the National Government today, No. Bin 5754, which stated: 'The Various Industries Trade Guilds Tax Rules Research Committee of Shanghai City has been informed of the cold weather telegram. The Ministry is currently reviewing the draft business tax regulations for the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in detail. If there are any violations of the Ministry's established outline, they should be checked and corrected. As for dockworkers who only buy and do not sell, since they have no business income, they are not subject to collection, and the business tax regulations sent by the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang do not list this item. There is no need for disturbance. Based on the previous situation, in addition to ordering the Finance Departments of the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to be informed, we hereby inform you.' Due to the Ministry of Finance's seal, etc., we have sent a separate letter in addition to this notification, hoping that you will check it."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Pan Gongzhan Discusses the Prohibition of Stores Concurrently Operating Savings <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>▲ Please Return the Measures to Be Approved by the Bureau First</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News visited Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday regarding the prohibition of ordinary stores concurrently operating savings. According to him, the bureau was ordered to prohibit such activity, so it is difficult to be lenient. After receiving the order, the relevant stores should stop collecting savings deposits immediately, but they should not stop paying out. As for the application for reimbursement measures, the relevant companies and stores should follow the instructions and report to the bureau within ten days of receiving the document. They can only proceed after the bureau approves the application. They are not allowed to stop paying out or reduce payments without authorization, causing depositors to suffer losses. The reporter then asked how to handle the fixed-term deposits that have not yet matured. It is said that this can be handled according to the usual practice of current deposits. The reporter then asked why the Social Affairs Bureau did not prohibit the reading savings of the World Bookstore, as rumored. It was answered that the reading savings of the World Bookstore was reported to have been stopped in June last year. As for the savings department of the bookstore, it is related to the savings of the employees and shareholders of the bookstore, and most of the reading savings depositors have also withdrawn their principal and interest. Those who are unwilling to withdraw will be transferred to the World Commercial Savings Bank for deposit. As for the World Commercial Savings Bank, which is run by the bookstore separately, it is heard that the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to investigate and has received a license. However, since it has not yet opened for business, it should not absorb savings deposits first. Moreover, the savings deposits of reading savings depositors who have not withdrawn their savings deposits should be returned uniformly according to the law. Savings can only be handled according to the law after the bank is officially opened. The same applies to other stores that concurrently operate savings. In short, whether a company or store has credit is one thing, and ordinary companies and stores cannot concurrently operate savings is another. We cannot recognize that it has credit and allow it to operate savings under this name. Even for banks, it is not the case that all can operate savings. To operate a savings bank, it must be registered as a bank, set aside capital separately, and formulate separate articles of association, stating that all directors and co-managers are fully and infinitely liable, and its investment methods and balance sheets of assets and liabilities should be reported to the government on a regular basis and disclosed to the public before it can be approved to operate savings. Otherwise, a bank that operates savings in the name of a registered limited liability company absorbs savings deposits, and if an accident occurs, it will only bear limited liability, and depositors will suffer too much loss. As for companies registered in foreign countries, as long as they set up shops in China, they should re-register as branches with the competent Chinese government authorities, otherwise they cannot be recognized as limited liability companies.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Question of Whether to Temporarily Suspend the Shift Worker System in the National Pharmaceutical Industry <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Pharmaceutical Industry Association has repeatedly received petitions from its members, detailing the suffering of the industry from the shift worker system, and requesting the removal of the worker system to maintain business difficulties. Yesterday, it was forwarded to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to request a temporary suspension of the shift worker system. It is heard that the bureau has instructed the industry association to wait for the bureau to complete the reorganization of the city's trade unions, and then the bureau will jointly review the previously agreed conditions with the Municipal Party Headquarters before reviewing and handling the matter again. No unilateral changes are allowed during this period, which may cause disputes. Yesterday, the industry association again sent more than a dozen representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Pan also sent personnel to inform them that although trade unions need to be reorganized and reorganized, the existing contracts between trade unions and employers should be maintained as valid and effective until the party and government authorities have reviewed and revised them, and should not be arbitrarily abandoned or modified by one party.</p>

The chairman of the county, Yan Shenyu, discussed matters: (1) The County Reorganization Committee proposed how to dispose of all the instruments and documents of the old Education Association in this county. As a result, the County Reorganization Committee will first receive and keep them in custody, and then discuss the matter with the County Government and the County Education Bureau to transfer them to the new County Education Association for receipt. (2) The County Reorganization Committee discussed the establishment of a special zone education association. As a result, they reported to the department for instructions, and due to time constraints, they first started to organize it. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Shanghai County Local Pacification Meeting Resolutions <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Local Pacification Bureau convened a local pacification meeting the day before yesterday (a summary was reported yesterday). The complete resolutions of that day are now recorded below. The meeting began with a report from the chairman and bureau director, Yan Shenyu, who stated that the purpose of convening the meeting was to discuss the procedures for carrying out local pacification. He mentioned that some people believe that local pacification should be carried out in areas with banditry, which is a misconception. While local pacification should indeed be carried out in areas with banditry, with attention paid to suppression, attention should also be paid to prevention in areas without banditry. Therefore, the current effort is being carried out uniformly across all counties as decided by the provincial government. This county, having received the order to establish a Local Pacification Bureau within one week, has complied by establishing the bureau within the deadline and notifying all districts to establish sub-bureaus and commence operations. He then presented a summary of the planned outlines for local pacification procedures for detailed discussion and comments. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The bureau director proposed a plan for discussing the outlines of the local pacification procedures for each sub-bureau. The resolution was passed with modifications. (2) The bureau director submitted a proposal for discussion on propaganda plans for each sub-bureau and school. The resolution was passed with modifications. (3) Director Yao proposed that for the sake of lasting benefit from this local pacification effort, magnetic doorplates should be manufactured for discussion. The resolution was passed: (i) to manufacture magnetic doorplates; (ii) to implement this first in urban areas; (iii) for the county to determine the size and style of the doorplates, as well as the implementation timeline, and to inform each district to follow accordingly. (4) Director Yao raised the concern that due to the mobile nature of boats, it may be difficult to obtain guarantees for boat households during this effort. He proposed seeking guarantees from shops instead. The resolution was to submit this to the province for approval. (5) Director Fu proposed implementing mutual guarantee and joint liability, with each neighborhood unit consisting of five households. However, considering the existing neighborhood organization in each district, where some neighborhoods have more than seven households or fewer than five due to location, he asked how to remedy this. The resolution was to submit this to the province for instructions. (6) The first district head proposed that the water police should assist in the investigation of boats. The resolution was to send a letter to the water police district headquarters requesting assistance. (7) The county council deliberated on the matter of assistant staff for the Local Pacification Bureau, proposing that each district nominate candidates to the county for selection and appointment. The resolution was to have each district nominate one person by March 2nd for county review and appointment.

The resolution was for the county to issue an order to all security corps to earnestly comply.</p>

<h3 id="e143">The People's Livelihood Improvement Association's Fifth Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>▲Resolution to request the government to effectively implement the Factory Law</p>
<p>The People's Livelihood Research and Improvement Association continued its fifth discussion meeting yesterday, with over forty representatives from various parties in attendance. The chairman was Zhong Keto. The morning session discussed the relationship between labor welfare and government labor policy, while the afternoon session discussed the relationship between labor welfare and the organization of labor movements. The details of each session are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Morning Discussion A. Zhu Maocheng presented the content of the Factory Law and points to note: (1) Factory meetings are not intended for joint management by capital, but to resolve misunderstandings and disputes. (2) Reduce child labor and provide relief to unemployed adult workers. (3) Working hours should be based on the principle of eight hours. (4) Criticize the petition of the China Industrial Federation as non-compliant. (5) The Factory Law is the result of the efforts of all parties for labor over the past ten years, and efforts should continue in the future. B. Lin Donghai presented the key points for the implementation of labor laws in various countries: 1. Unified and stable government. 2. Social issues are compatible with economic conditions. 3. Both labor and management have knowledge. 4. Both labor and management have ethics. 5. There are effective inspection methods. He further pointed out the shortcomings of factories in China, due to the lack of definite standards for wages, working hours, bonuses, child labor, and pensions. C. Gu Bingyuan raised two difficulties in mediating labor-management disputes: 1. Factories run by foreign merchants are not subject to mediation. 2. There is no standard for wages. He also advocated for the recovery of concessions and the training of specialized inspection personnel after the implementation of the Factory Law. The main points of the discussion were: 1. Request the government to effectively implement the Factory Law and establish an agency to manage the Factory Law. 2. Request the government to train inspectors. 3. Request the government to recover concessions as soon as possible. 4. Request the Public Concession and the French Concession to cooperate with China in implementing the Factory Law.</p>
<p>▲Afternoon Discussion A. Dai Leren proposed discussions on: 1. Whether past labor movement organizations were due to workers lacking knowledge. 2. How those engaged in labor welfare work should guide workers in organizing trade unions. 3. What kind of organizations can assist the labor movement. B. Chen Qitian raised the question of why, in foreign factories, units are organized by factory or by region, while the Factory Law in China stipulates organization by district. C. Sun Miaoyun presented opinions on the current organization of trade unions. D. Deng Yuzhi proposed that the association should provide side-by-side assistance to the labor movement and include more materials on labor movements and organization in worker education programs. Finally, Chen Zongcheng proposed that the government's protection of workers should not only focus on factory workers and large industrialists, because in addition to factory workers and large industrialists, the lives of miners and rickshaw pullers are even more difficult, and the association should petition the government to provide legal protection for them. Regarding previous questions, four review committees were set up for review, including the first group for worker life and worker education, the second group for industrial issues and cooperative enterprises, the third group for the relationship between worker welfare and government labor policy, and the fourth group for Christianity and labor programs.</p>
<p>▲Today's Agenda Today's discussion topic is Christianity and people's livelihood issues, and the afternoon will be used to discuss and resolve the reports of each review committee.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Rice Industry Bushel Ticket Affixing Stamp <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association issued a notice yesterday to various bean and rice industry groups and trades, stating: "Regarding bushel tickets, delivery barcode slips, and other items that are not invoices, and should not be affixed with stamp tax, this association has previously sent a letter to the Jiangsu Shanghai Precious Stamp Tax Bureau, forwarding it to the Ministry of Finance for exemption. A reply has now been received stating that the three types of documents have been forwarded to higher authorities for review. Before a clear order is received, they will be temporarily exempted from inspection. As for formal bushel tickets, which contain the name of the goods, quantity, price, and amount of silver, it is undoubtedly necessary to affix stamps. However, if the stamp tax fee should be acknowledged by the seller, the responsibility for affixing stamps should still be borne by the buyer in their place, in order to assign responsibility. Regarding the procedures for both buyers and sellers, your association should notify the trades and rice merchants to follow these regulations." In accordance with this, the seventh executive committee of this association resolved that the responsibility for affixing stamps on formal bushel tickets should be borne by the buyer, but the stamp tax fee should be borne by the seller and deducted when settling accounts, starting from March 1st. It has been decided on file. In addition to sending notices to the rice industry associations to inform the merchants to comply, this notice is hereby issued to all our colleagues, hoping that all formal bushel tickets will be affixed with stamp tax, and the stamp tax fee will be deducted from the seller when settling accounts. This is specially notified.</p>

<p>▲Workers Resumed Work Yesterday</p>
<p>The labor dispute that occurred at the Japanese-owned China Metal Manufacturing Factory on Jixiang Road, Hongkou, in this city, has lasted for more than a month.

The signed agreement is recorded below. The dispute between the parties concerned is a dispute over factory closure and changes in the work system. The committee convened a mediation session, and the parties agreed to sign an agreement, which is recorded as follows: (1) The factory shall comply with the bureau's order to reinstate worker Lin Enkang.

<h3 id="e147">Famous Actress Qin Xuefang Dies of Illness <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>▲Passed Away the Day Before Yesterday, Full Funeral Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>▲Elderly Mother and Younger Sister Grief-Stricken</p>
<p>Qin Xuefang, a famous female performer from Beijing and Tianjin who specialized in qingyi roles, was known as one of the "Four Diamond Generals" along with Zhang Eyun, Ma Yanmei, and Jin Shamei, forming a counterpart to the "Four Great Dan" Mei, Shang, Xun, and Cheng. Since marrying her husband several years ago, Qin has resided in Shanghai. Her presence has been absent from the stage for a long time. She recently contracted a lung disease and died the day before yesterday (the 26th) at 10:00 AM at her residence on Route Massenet. She was only 27 years old. It is truly lamentable that such a beautiful woman died so young. Her elderly mother and younger sister, who lived with her, were overcome with grief. Qin was a Muslim and her funeral was held yesterday at 12:00 PM according to Islamic rites. The coffin was temporarily placed in the Qingzhen Temple in Rihui Port. Qin's original name was Ma Jinfeng, and she was originally from Shandong. Her father was a former Qing dynasty scholar who was honest and did not engage in production. After his death, the family was impoverished, and the mother and daughter had no way to make a living, so they learned opera from a teacher. She performed at the Great World and Qiankun Theatre, in the same troupe as Wang Biyun and others. Later, she went to Beijing and studied under Wang Yaoqing. Not long after, she joined a troupe in Tianjin, where she was greatly appreciated by Li Huangpi, and her reputation rose. She was ranked as one of the Four Diamond Generals.</p>
<h3 id="e148">New Record for Extortion: Extortion of 100,000 Yuan <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>▲Chuan Zhihong Initially Ignored</p>
<p>▲Later Received a Phone Call Inviting Him to Negotiate</p>
<p>▲Detective and Informant Disguised as Waiters</p>
<p>▲Six Extortionists Arrested Together</p>
<p>Fu Zhihong, a native of Ningbo who is engaged in construction in Shanghai, residing at No. 1334, East West Waide Road, has received three threatening letters by mail from January 30th to February 7th, demanding 100,000 yuan. This huge amount has broken the new record of extortionists. The third letter included two bullets and contained strong language, stating that if he did not comply, his son would be killed. Chuan initially ignored them, but at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, he suddenly received a phone call instructing him to negotiate in Room 411 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Fuzhou Road. The room was marked with a Wu surname plate. Chuan reported this to the Huishan Police Station, which sent Detective Zhang Zhiqin and informant Xu Yongyuan, disguised as waiters, to the hotel to act as tea waiters. Fu then ordered Chen Huatang to go as scheduled. Upon entering the room, he was greeted by Ningbo natives Wu Abao and Zhang Yiming. After inquiring that Chen was Chuan's representative, Zhang first said, "Mr. Wu has not arrived yet, please sit down for a while." Wu then said, "Mr. Fu is too arrogant to delay until now without replying." At this time, Ningbo natives Wu Wanggen, Ge Yongchang, Zhang Agen, and Chai Xingfu entered the room one after another. Ge spoke first, saying, "We have already decided to reduce the amount to 50,000 yuan, and now it has been reduced to 20,000 yuan, which cannot be less." Chen then explained that Fu was not wealthy and could find a way to raise 1,000 yuan, but it was impossible to bear a huge amount. Ge continued, "We have already spent 1,000 yuan on this matter. Since you are here, we will give you face and ask Fu to pay 15,000 yuan to settle the matter." Chen said that he could not make a decision and would go back to discuss it. He got up and left the room, and the detectives disguised as tea waiters rushed in and arrested Wu and the other six people together. Yesterday, they were taken to the Special District Local Court. Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. Fu and Chen appeared in court and recounted what happened, presenting the letters and bullets as evidence. Questioned Wu confessed that this matter was done by Zhang Agen, Chai Xingfu, and a runaway "long-legged A-San." Zhang and Ge Yongchang both confessed that they were invited to the hotel by Wu Deming. Wu Wanggen confessed that he was invited by Wu Agen. Zhang Yiming confessed that he went with Wu, but they all denied knowing who wrote the threatening letters. The judge ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Divorce Case Against the Wife of a Chef at the Da San Yuan Restaurant Dismissed <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲Plaintiff Admits to Adultery</p>
<p>▲Right to Divorce Belongs to Defendant</p>
<p>▲Did Not Want to Publicize Family Scandal</p>
<p>▲Tolerated Wife to Preserve Family Honor</p>
<p>Hu Guanfu, a chef at the Da San Yuan Restaurant, was sued for divorce by his wife, Hu Yang, in the Special District Local Court. She claimed that Hu had a hidden illness, making him incapable, and that he instigated his brother-in-law, Wang Xuetang, to commit adultery with her. Hu retained lawyer Hong Shihao to defend himself and offered to have a forensic doctor examine him. Judge Xu Wenrong ordered a forensic examination before making a decision, which was previously reported. During the continued interrogation, Judge Xu informed both parties that the Special Court did not have a forensic doctor of this kind at the moment and that the examination would be waived. According to the plaintiff, Hu Yang, her husband did have a hidden illness, and they only had intercourse for three days after the marriage, and she never took off her clothes. Moreover, the defendant's sister, Wang Hu, repeatedly encouraged her to sleep with her husband, Wang Xuetang, in order to continue the family line. The defendant's claim of a hidden illness was therefore well-founded. Therefore, she was unwilling to maintain the empty name of husband and wife and requested that the divorce be granted and that the dowry be returned. The defendant, Hu Guanfu, also continued to deny that he had a hidden illness, saying that he could be examined at any time. He had not heard of any ambiguity between the plaintiff and Wang Xuetang after she privately left home. The child she bore, whose seed it was, was even more difficult to determine. But he did not want a divorce and requested that they be ordered to live together. After the interrogation, the parties were instructed to begin their arguments. Lawyer Wang, representing the plaintiff, said that the plaintiff and the defendant had only lived together for three days and did not take off their clothes. Moreover, looking at the defendant's appearance, it was clear that he had a hidden illness. For three years, he not only failed to fulfill his duties as a husband but also encouraged adultery, instigating his brother-in-law to perform his husbandly duties. For such a nominal couple, the law, in order to protect women's rights, should grant a divorce. Defendant's lawyer Hong Shihao argued that the plaintiff's allegations were nothing short of a fantastic novel. They could be sensational if said in a tea shop, but they were too bizarre and unfounded when viewed with a legal eye in the dignified courtroom. The claim that she did not take off her clothes for three nights was entirely empty talk. Even if it could be proven, it could not be inferred that he had a hidden illness. It would be even more absurd to determine that he had a hidden illness based on his unattractive appearance. Since the plaintiff admitted to adultery with Wang Xuetang, the right to request a divorce naturally belonged to the defendant. Now, the defendant did not want to publicize the family scandal, and marriage was not easy, so he tolerated her to preserve family honor. How should the adulterous woman repent? She believed that since she had committed adultery, she could request a divorce from her husband, which was ridiculous. Therefore, he requested that the plaintiff's suit be dismissed and that she be ordered to live with the defendant. Xu Mu, the prosecutor, then came to court to state his opinion. Judge Xu opened the court yesterday and ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's suit. The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the litigation.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Unexplained Death of a Woman <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>▲Rumored to Have Died from Taking Medicine for Abortion</p>
<p>▲Truth Will Be Revealed After Examination This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, an unexplained death of a woman occurred at the home of Taoist Gao at No. 13, Ping An Lane, East End of Route Joffre, French Concession. At that time, there were rumors in the streets, and someone secretly reported to the police station. The police chief, upon hearing the news, immediately sent a detective to investigate and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall morgue for examination. This reporter, upon hearing the news, rushed to investigate. The exterior of the lane was quite neat, but the interior was full of bungalows. Moreover, there was a tiger stove at the entrance of the lane, and the inside was extremely dirty. After several twists and turns, the reporter inquired and found No. 13. The house was a three-room, two-wing bungalow, completely old-fashioned. The courtyard was very wide. After entering the room, there were Taoist scriptures and Zhu boxes, and the furnishings filled the hall, indicating that it was the residence of a Taoist. Inside the reception room, there were three or five young men wearing gabardine coats, who were sitting around the table having dinner. When they saw the reporter, they looked at each other in surprise. When the reporter inquired, one of the young men showed an unhappy expression and answered evasively, saying that the house was No. 3, the dead woman's name was Chen, from Liuhe, 30 years old, and she had been a widow for a long time. Ten years ago, she became acquainted with Gao Yunshan, who lived there. Gao was a local, 28 years old. The house was Gao's ancestral property. Since becoming acquainted with Chen, they had raised two daughters and one son together. Gao himself used to work in a printing shop, but he has been unemployed for six or seven years. He has never been a Taoist. Later, because he had spare rooms, he rented them to Taoist Gao Hongshou, so it was mistakenly rumored that Gao was also a Taoist. As for the cause of Chen's death, it was because she gave birth to a daughter on the 9th of this month and then fell ill. She died of postpartum hemorrhage at 5:00 PM yesterday (the day before yesterday). This morning (yesterday morning), because of dealing with funeral affairs, there were many idlers standing at the entrance of the lane, who were spotted by patrolling police officers. Moreover, because a passerby falsely reported that she was murdered, the police station, for the sake of caution, transported the body to the morgue to be examined. After the examination, they allowed the body to be coffined. The reporter found his words extremely contradictory, and because it was a matter of human life, it could not be ignored. He returned to the morgue to inquire, but the information on the corpse form was completely inconsistent with what the young man said. The form stated that the plaintiff was Yuan Yunlin, the father of the deceased, and the defendant was Gao Lansheng. The witnesses were Yuan Changde and Gao Yuezhen. Yuan was the deceased's younger brother, and Yuezhen was the deceased's daughter. The deceased's name was Yuan Xiaoding, 36 years old. The cause of death was from taking medicine for an abortion. However, the deceased's face was purplish-blue, which resembled poisoning. What is the truth will be known after the examination today.</p>

<p>▲Zhu Haisheng Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment</p>
<p>Ni Xiuzhen, a female teacher, was previously seduced and raped by Zhu Haisheng, a foreman at the Rui Rong Iron Factory, and then abandoned. Ni sued Zhu in the Special District Local Court, and the defendant was acquitted. Ni, dissatisfied, appealed to the Higher Branch Court, which concluded the trial after repeated court hearings. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Song and Judges Gao and Ye opened the court and announced the judgment, reversing the original judgment. Zhu Haisheng repeatedly seduced and raped a woman under the age of 20, causing her to leave those with parental authority. He shall be sentenced to one year imprisonment. After the verdict, Zhu's lawyer, Ye Munkang, representing the defendant, stated that he was not satisfied and intended to appeal to the Supreme Court, requesting that the defendant be allowed to post bail. Judge Song instructed him to file a separate written application. Zhu was then taken away by the police and temporarily detained.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Conviction of Kidnapping Gang <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>▲Once Kidnapped Flour Merchant Ding Ziren</p>
<p>▲Committed 15 Cases in the French Concession</p>
<p>▲Cases in the Public Concession Not Included</p>
<p>Chen Shuxing, Zhang Wu (also known as Yang Wu), Chen Kaiqiang, and other members of a kidnapping gang, armed with weapons, kidnapped Ding Ziren, the manager of the Fuxin Flour Mill, at 10:30 AM on December 19th in the Public Concession on Moganshan Road. They hid him in Fengxian, Pudong. The authorities were informed and rescued the hostage. Chen and other bandits opened fire to resist arrest and fled to Shanghai, where they committed robberies in the French Concession. Detectives and inspectors Jin Jiulin and Li Yaolong, deputy detectives Qian Yumin and Jin Gen, Zhang Ziying, and police officers Zhou Buguang and Xu Guilin of the French Police Department detected and arrested Chen and the other three bandits, as well as suspects Xu Xiaohuaizi and Zhang Jinlin. Two Mauser pistols and one handgun were found on Chen and the other bandits, and they were taken to the police station. After interrogation, Chen and the other bandits confessed that in addition to the kidnapping of Ding Ziren, they had committed 15 robberies in the French Concession from May of last year to January of this year, including: Du Xingqiu's cigarette and paper shop at No. 28 Xinglong Street, Xujiahui Road; Jiang Rongfu's cigarette and paper shop at No. 471 Xujiahui Road; Sun Shaofang's cigarette and paper shop at No. 245 Xujiahui Road; Qingfeng Sauce Garden at No. 616 Xujiahui Road; Pan Caibao's dried goods store at No. 864 Beile Road; Ruichangxiang's cigarette and paper shop at No. 143 Avenue Edward VII; Zhu Liangchao's cigarette and paper shop at Shenjia浜, Avenue Foch (two robberies); Chen Changming's sock factory at No. 104 Renshou Lane, Caishi Road; Zhu Funian's rickshaw company at No. 340 Caishi Road; Cao Ruzhen's cigarette and paper shop at No. 147 Xiancheng Lane, Rue Pere Robert; Mi Lisen's cigarette and paper shop at No. 150 Rue du Pere Froc; Xu Yanggui's restaurant at No. 871 Avenue Joffre; Zhu Quanfa's house at No. 34 Meimu Lane, Avenue Joffre; and Zhang Xindi's inn on Avenue Edward VII. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, they were sent to the French Court for investigation. Judge Zhu Qi, together with French Consul Duge, sat in the criminal court. The Western police chief first reported the situation and presented the Mauser pistols and handgun for inspection. Then, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Putuo Road Police Station requested to move the interrogation. The plaintiffs also testified about the robberies. Chen Shuxing, Zhang Wu, and Chen Kaiqiang confessed to the robberies and the kidnapping. Xu and Zhang confessed that they were implicated by the others and did not dare to commit robberies, asking for leniency. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Chen Shuxing, Zhang Wu, and Chen Kaiqiang to five years in the Western prison and deportation and sent them to the Mainland court for interrogation. They were first sent to the British Police Station for interrogation. The confiscated Mauser pistols were confiscated. Xu Xiaohuaizi and Zhang Jinlin were released without charge.</p>

<p>▲Chen Ziqing Becomes the Target of Public Criticism</p>
<p>Chen Ziqing, the revenue collector of the Caotang grain collection office in Shanghai County, was accused of embezzlement and using counterfeit currency. Citizens such as Yang Hou Sheng, Jin Jian Qiu, Ding Bo Chu, Xu Feng Yi, Wang Dao Sheng, and Wu Bu Yun jointly submitted a petition to the county government, requesting that the Finance Bureau be ordered to promptly dismiss and investigate Chen. Now, more than twenty township and village chiefs, including Ding Bo Xiong, the chief of Caohang Township, and Yang Dian Bang, the head of Wangqiao Township, jointly stated that Chen Ziqing indeed forced taxpayers to exchange genuine currency for counterfeit bills or deliberately dropped bills during the count, brazenly pocketing the difference. His fraudulent behavior is undeniable. If the authorities are not petitioned for a thorough investigation, the harassment of the villagers will become even more unrestrained. Therefore, they jointly signed and sealed a petition to the district office a few days ago, requesting that it be forwarded to the county government. They requested that the Finance Bureau be ordered to immediately dismiss and investigate the revenue collector Chen Ziqing to deter corruption and appease public opinion.</p>

<p>Wu Kezhong, a detective of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team, learned that the kidnappers who abducted a six-year-old boy surnamed Zhou in Qingpu County, more than ten miles from the city, were hiding at No. 73, Shunda Lane, Liyuan Road, Nanshi, Shanghai. He immediately reported to Captain Lu, who immediately dispatched Squad Leader Wu Xiufeng and detectives Wu Zuorong, Wang Zian, Han Jingxiang, Gao Zihua, and others to arrest them at the address. A female suspect named Ma Li was arrested, along with four suspects named Ma Hongyun, Wang Wanhe, and Wei Qiyi. According to Li's confession, in December of last year, Sun Yushan, whom she knew, gathered Jin and others, including herself (Li), a total of four people. They took the train to Kunshan with two pistols, which she hid on her person. After arriving in Kunshan, they took a boat to a village in the evening. Sun and others took the guns ashore and returned about half an hour later with a child, ordering her to watch over him. Sun and others then traveled to Shanghai by land, while she took the child by boat to Shanghai. After arriving at Beixinjing, Sun and others hid the child at the residence of a person surnamed Yuan at No. 3, Shengji Lane, South Railway Station. Her husband, Ma Hongyun, was ill at the time. Later, when she returned, her husband argued with her and questioned Sun, claiming that he was unaware of the matter. Based on the confession, Captain Lu ordered the original detectives to go to Shengji Lane and arrest Sun Yushan and Yuan Desheng, bringing them back to the team for strict interrogation. Sun and others were evasive in their answers. As for the two pistols, it is said that they belonged to a member of a certain association in the Public Concession.</p>

Suddenly, a bullet was discharged, accidentally hitting Lu Genbao, a crew member on the No. 4 rice boat moored next to the ferry, in the waist, causing his immediate death. The captain of the reconnaissance team rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and immediately took the soldier Peng Shaobao, who caused the accident, back for strict handling. He immediately notified the deceased's brother, Lu Genxiang, and repeatedly comforted him, offering generous compensation. The deceased's family believed that the incident was an accidental injury and were deeply grateful for the fair handling of the authorities.

According to the investigation, the Siming Guild Hall previously sent a letter to your police department certifying that all street vendors with legitimate businesses should be accommodated, and your chief inspector also replied to our association, which is on file. The stalls set up by our members are all legitimate businesses and comply with the regulations for setting up stalls. Therefore, they should be protected. However, the police department indiscriminately cracked down on them and took their goods and carts to the police station, resulting in losses, which is regrettable. In order to maintain the livelihood of the street vendors, our association is writing to your chief inspector, requesting that you consider the livelihood of the small vendors and instruct the relevant police department to accommodate legitimate street vendors in the future in order to maintain their livelihood. This would be a public service."</p>

<p>▲The Chicken and Duck Industry</p>
<p>The Chicken and Duck Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the business tax issue, stating in brief: "Regarding the brokerage industry of our association, the draft of the Shanghai Municipal Business Tax Collection Regulations and Detailed Rules did not propose any method for collecting taxes from the brokerage industry. However, Article 2, Item 2 of the General Outline of Business Tax Collection Methods in various provinces and Article 13 of the Business Regulations in Anhui Province proposed methods for taxing the brokerage industry, although there are two methods: (1) determining the amount of tax to be collected and collecting 2/1000 of the brokerage fee, and (2) as a temporary measure, collecting the original brokerage tax. Although Zhejiang and Shanghai have not proposed such methods, they can be followed as examples to show the fairness of the legislation. Therefore, the business tax rate collected in our industry should be based on business income and the collection should be based on the brokerage fee, and should not be based on the fixed price of goods, which is obvious. We are responding to this letter, hoping that you will forward it to the authorities, and that the brokerage industry will collect taxes based on the brokerage fee and not exceed 2/1000."</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>Respected Sir,</p>
<p>My neighbor, Jin Jun Shaohua, styled Baokang, childhood name Heshang, 26 years old, lives at No. 188, Qiaojia Road, inside the city of Nanshi. He works for the electricity bureau, earning a monthly salary of twenty or thirty yuan. He is usually honest and taciturn, going out early and returning late, walking instead of taking transportation, for several years. He has parents above him, and a wife, young son, and younger brother below him, who rely on him for their livelihood. Suddenly, on the 13th of this month (i.e., December 26th of the abandoned lunar calendar), he left for work in the morning and did not return at night. It has been half a month now, and there is no news of him. His family is extremely anxious, fearing that something bad has happened. They have reported to the Chinese Concession Police Bureau and the Life Saving Bureau, requesting them to pay attention and investigate. However, the six members of the Jin family will soon perish without his care. I intend to place a missing person ad in the newspaper, but I have no funds. Recognizing their suffering, I have taken the liberty of writing this letter, respectfully requesting that you publish this fact at the end of the newspaper. If kind-hearted gentlemen know of his whereabouts and are able to find him, not only will I be grateful beyond measure, but the Jin family will also be eternally grateful. Signed, Lu Jiayi.</p>
<p>P.S. Jin Jun is tall and thin, with a round, long, fair face. He wears a copper pot hat in snuff color, a tweed robe with a rabbit camel velvet lining, fingerless gloves in Shangqing color, old socks in snuff color, and black galoshes. He carries a black umbrella, one silver dollar, and more than ten copper coins.</p>
<p>We are writing to you regarding a case in which patrol officer Guo Wenjin brought three people, Tsukiji Jutarou and a young girl, and Sun Xiuting, to the Qiujiang Road, Alley 362 on the 22nd of this month due to a dispute. According to the investigation, the plaintiff stated that Tsukiji Jutarou, 50 years old, Japanese, a diver, had an argument with Sun Xiuting because Sun was playing with the young girl and spat on her face. Sun Xiuting, 34 years old, from Deng County, Shandong Province, a servant at No. 366, Qiujiang Road, stated that the Japanese girl knocked on my door, I opened the door and saw it was the young girl, we are familiar with each other, and I was playing with her and spat on her. Unexpectedly, she went home and told her parents that I hit her. So her parents and two others came to hit me. I didn't hit her. According to the investigation, Sun Xiuting, as a 34-year-old adult, should not be playing with a Japanese girl. Therefore, he was fined five yuan according to the police law. This is the course of the case. However, on February 24, the Shanghai Daily News reported that the wife of diver Tsukiji Jutarou was injured due to Sun Xiuting's violence and criticized our office for punishing the crime lightly. The director of our office was surprised when he read the report. Tsukiji Jutarou did not report that his wife was injured when he came to the office. If the injury was caused by violence and involved a criminal case, our office would have filed a lawsuit in court according to the law. If the injury required hospitalization, an injury certificate should have been presented when the case was filed, and our office would have handled it according to the law. Why didn't Tsukiji Jutarou report it at the time and only said that his daughter was bullied by Sun Xiuting and that he spat on her? On the 25th, the director of our office visited Japanese citizens Otsuki Shigeru and Kondo Hikaru because of the unresolved doubts. The two also mentioned the matter. They then went to Tsukiji Jutarou's residence to investigate. According to him, his wife's right ear was injured. When asked why he didn't report it that day, Tsukiji Jutarou said that he didn't understand the law of the Public Security Bureau at the time. It can be seen that our office punished the crime according to the situation and did not deal with it as a violation of police law because of the injury. Afterwards, our office summoned Sun Xiuting to the office again. Tsukiji Jutarou submitted a doctor's certificate from the hospital showing that his wife was injured. Our office immediately submitted it to the Public Security Bureau and sent a detailed letter to the Shanghai Daily News, but the newspaper has not corrected its mistakes or published the letter for three days. Therefore, we are sending this letter to the editor-in-chief, hoping that you will publish it in the news column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The First Division of the Fifth District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>

<p>Yesterday, my younger cousin, Heng, insisted on going to school. Mother couldn't keep her at home any longer. Although Mother knew she was ready for school, and that she genuinely wanted to go, she still pretended to object. I think this was a strategy, fearing that she would give up after only three days and find all sorts of excuses not to go. So she kept asking,</p>
<p>"Isn't it better if you don't go to school now? To avoid troubling me later and making me angry? It's fine if you don't go. If you do, you can't be lazy."</p>
<p>"Of course not, Mom. If I'm lazy, please hit me or scold me. I think, Mom, I definitely won't make you hit or scold me."</p>
<p>Finally, Mother agreed, giving her many more instructions. This morning, I took her to school to register. On the way, she was just happy, jumping and laughing constantly, one hand holding mine, the other clutching the empty schoolbag hanging on her shoulder. It was the one I used a couple of years ago, and Mother found it for her last night. Mother said,</p>
<p>"Taking advantage of your brother's success, you'll surely be smart enough to get top grades too."</p>
<p>When I arrived at school, I learned that fees were being collected today, and classes would start next Monday. I saw students crowding the accountant's window, some checking their receipts as they walked back.</p>
<p>I went to the school affairs office to complete Heng's enrollment procedures. I saw Principal Zou and other teachers, and I bowed to them respectfully.</p>
<p>"Zhang Yong, is this your sister? Did you bring her here to play?" Teacher Cheng put down his pen and asked me from his seat. "No, Teacher Cheng. She's here to register, preparing to enter the first grade."</p>
<p>"Excellent, how old is she?" Principal Zou asked.</p>
<p>"Six years old, Principal Zou."</p>
<p>"Take her to Teacher Qin to take a look, then let her in."</p>
<p>I took her to Teacher Qin, the first-grade teacher. She wrote a few words, "I am very happy to go to school today," and asked Heng to read them. Heng only recognized the word "feel." I knew she wouldn't be rejected. Teacher Qin was chatting with her to test her character and temperament, and also taught her to write and do simple arithmetic. I stood aside waiting. At this time, I listened to Principal Zou's words,</p>
<p>He drank half a glass of water, smoking a cigarette, and said to many teachers, "Now I am always very happy to see many students come here to study, and giving them more opportunity to study can wash away some of my sins."</p>
<p>"Some teachers know, I remember them talking about it, it was after the summer vacation two years ago when school started. A postman brought his son to register, requesting that we allow his son to transfer because his family had moved here, too far from the original school." "I looked at the report card, and the grades were not bad. Naturally, I wouldn't refuse them, but in fact, I couldn't. At that time, there were only seven classes here, and the classrooms were overcrowded. (Speaking, he pointed to the outside of the window) The buildings here hadn't been renovated yet. I checked, and there were already fifty-eight students in the third grade, and no matter what, I couldn't take him. The classroom definitely couldn't accommodate him. I said to him in a low voice, "The school has no reason to refuse any student's enrollment, especially students transferring within the city, but due to the city government's insufficient educational funding, the number of classes in each school has not been expanded as much as possible, which has resulted in an alarming number of out-of-school children throughout the city. Look, the third-grade classroom here is so crowded with desks and benches, and there's only one class, accommodating children who could be divided into two classes. Our school is extremely unwilling to refuse these out-of-school children, but in fact, we have had to refuse dozens of good children in the past few days. My heart as the principal is truly indescribably uncomfortable."</p>
<p>"Your school's situation is certainly understandable," the postman said, "My family's difficulties should also be understood. My family moved here to live so that I can work closer to the post office, but it is five or six li away from his original school. In any case, he can no longer go to school there. There is only this one school here, and the others are equally far away, so I ask you to find a way to let my child transfer here."</p>
<p>"I listened to him speaking earnestly, almost anxiously crying. His voice also changed. My heart was pricked like needles. I went to the third-grade classroom in person. I rearranged the desks and chairs, but in fact, I couldn't add another seat. I came back and told him, "According to the current situation, there is only this way. If you are willing to drop down a grade, he can attend the second grade, otherwise, wait until after the start of school to see if any third-grade students are absent due to circumstances, and then let him transfer here. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"He truly shed tears. He was indescribably aggrieved, perhaps regretting that he shouldn't have moved. He had to take the bewildered child away. Naturally, he was unwilling to let him drop down a grade. He came back once afterwards, and it happened that no third-grade students were absent. He finally left in disappointment."</p>
<p>"This matter often makes me ashamed, annoyed, and feel heartbroken. If this continues, can it still be considered the education of the glorious Republic of China? From this, I was like being stimulated, always thinking of negotiating with the authorities to expand our classes and accommodate more out-of-school children. This goal was finally achieved, with the renovation of these buildings and the addition of six grades of classrooms."</p>
<p>"So now, whenever I see new students arriving, I always feel indescribably happy, as if I can redeem my sins. I don't know how that student is now. If I had kept his name and address at the time, I would have found him first to study here."</p>
<p>He said a lot, and the cigarette in his hand burned to the end before he could smoke it. At this time, my cousin Heng had finished the test and was allowed to study in the first grade. I took her home, added the tuition for both of us, had lunch, and then went to the accountant's office to pay.</p>
<p>During these free days, it's good to review my vacation homework again.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Memorial Week for the Premier　Jiang Shanqing <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Today is Monday, the first day of formal classes. At 8:30, the students gathered in the auditorium to hold the ceremony of the Memorial Week for the Premier, taking advantage of the morning assembly time.</p>
<p>I think the Memorial Week for the Premier is an active form of instruction, not idol worship, different from the prayers of Christians. When holding the Memorial Week for the Premier, recalling the past is far less important than encouraging the future or repenting of the present. The Premier's portrait hangs high under the shadow of the National Party flag, making you feel that he has not left this world. His spirit, his career, his personality, are entirely present before your eyes. If you have carefully and quietly experienced it, you can also feel that sacred inspiration, surging around you. He awakens your self-awareness, especially during the ceremony, making you eliminate pride, recognize your own insignificance, making you examine your achievements, and regret the negligence of effort. The prayers of Christians are nothing more than hope and blind following, emptiness and foolishness, so the two cannot be compared.</p>
<p>Even the lyrics of the "Premier Memorial Song" are significantly different in feeling, appreciation, and singing compared to flattering songs like "My Lord God."</p>
<p>Our Premier, first advocated revolution, revolutionary blood like flowers, overthrew autocracy, built the republic, produced my lord China,</p>
<p>The Republic of China is newly established, and state affairs are in a mess,</p>
<p>The Premier detailed plans, reforming China again,</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People, the Five-Power Constitution, carefully pursuing the truth,</p>
<p>A lifetime of hardship, a lifetime of running around, struggling for national sacrifice,</p>
<p>The spirit of the Premier will last forever,</p>
<p>Like the Blue Sky with a White Sun, lasting for thousands of years,</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The people's livelihood is declining, the country's steps are difficult, and the troubles have not yet ended. Do not disperse the group, do not lose heart, and encourage each other,</p>
<p>The Premier's last words, do not forget,</p>
<p>The revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades still need to work hard,</p>
<p>These lyrics were distributed by the school, fearing that some people would not be able to sing them proficiently.</p>
<p>After singing the Party song and the Memorial Song for the Premier, the principal led the ceremony, respectfully reading the Premier's will and observing silence. When reciting the will, the voices were extremely neat and solemn, still like a collective awakened oath. During the silence, even the most mischievous students who liked to make funny faces were devout and quiet. The consciousness and emotions of four or five hundred people were all integrated. Today, at this moment, is when schools and organizations across the country are holding the Memorial Week for the Premier. On this clear morning, the consciousness and emotions of about tens of millions of people are also integrated. Tens of millions of people's minds are all remembering the Premier's spirit, career, and personality. They are all prepared, awakened, and encouraged to reproduce the Premier's spirit, emulate the Premier's personality, and strive to accomplish the Premier's unfinished career.</p>
<p>The principal and the dean of discipline both gave speeches. The principal also selectively reported on the recent Chinese political party affairs and the world situation. Because today is the first time to hold the Memorial Week for the Premier after the start of school, his more solemn words struck the listeners' hearts, leaving a deep impression. He further explained the significance of the Memorial Week for the Premier and the attitude we should have.</p>
<p>The Dean of Discipline followed with a fifteen-minute speech. He was the new Mr. Kong who was hired this semester. He also teaches us Party principles, history, and geography. He is very young, sincere, and stable. His speech is loud and clear, and his thinking is precise and correct. Everything about him can be my model. I think his teachings will leave me with a deep impression.</p>
<p>Today he explained the Premier's will, allowing me to begin to understand the essence it contains, and to pay attention to the three points of "must," "must," and "especially must."</p>
<p>It is necessary to awaken the masses, unite with the nations of the world that can treat me equally, and finally complete the Premier's forty-year purpose of seeking freedom and equality for China through revolution. Because if the masses cannot awaken, they cannot seek liberation themselves. If the nations that treat me equally cannot unite, they cannot defeat imperialism. Furthermore, without uniting with the weak and small nations of the world, the ideal of world harmony cannot be realized.</p>
<p>It is necessary to follow the Premier's theories and plans, strive to implement them, and finally have a correct direction and achieve the purpose of the revolution.</p>
<p>It is especially necessary to convene a national assembly in the shortest possible time, and finally build the foundation of constitutional government, abolish unequal treaties, and finally achieve the first step towards equality and freedom.</p>
<p>This will is indeed an instruction to the members of the Chinese Kuomintang, but since it is for the sake of the country's future, our people should have a clear understanding. Even at a young age, today's commemoration of the Premier is the first time in this semester, and because the students have gone through a long vacation, there is a warm emotion in the solemn gathering. This solemn warmth deeply moved me.</p>
