<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>▲實際上一個完美的愛人並不一定是一個理想的配偶然而在小説上以及女的的腦海中則二者常混爲一談</p>
<p>▲在戀愛的當兒女人們從玫瑰色的眼鏡裏來觀察對手方的男子然在結婚之後玫瑰色的眼鏡會很自然地解脱於是男女雙方的熱度不免要受一點影響</p>
<p>▲結婚是一面顯微鏡從道裏我們可以看到對手方一切的眞情</p>
<p>▲一雙適意的鞋子一個適意的心靈以及一個適意的戀愛可以使一個女人常保其青春的色澤而延長其享樂的壽命</p>
<p>▲要試騐摩登女性的眞心之愛不在示婚前伊之願否爲對手方的男子在上帝前爲之禱告懺悔而在婚後伊之願否與之同甘貧苦</p>
<p>▲一般摩登女子希望個個男子像煤油大王這樣富並且像好蘭塢的明星般的會化錢</p>
<p>▲在數百年後愛情將不復爲一種不確定的事結婚將不復爲一種偶合的事離婚也不復爲一種勢所必然的事</p>
<p>▲男子們的美質即在乎他之能注重於處置自己的事務而女人們的弱點即在乎伊之不能放手於别人的事務</p>

<p>Kong Xiangxi delivers the opening address, dignitaries wield hoes to plant pines.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th. At 2 PM, people from all walks of life held a tree-planting ceremony at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. Those present included Mr. and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Shao Yuanchong, Mr. and Mrs. Shao Lizi, Kong Xiangxi, Zhu Jiaju, Liu Luyin, Niu Yongjian, Ma Fuxiang, Ma Chaojun, Liu Shangqing, He Yaozu, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Wu Siyu, Wei Daoming, representatives from various party departments, administrative organs, students, civilians, and foreign guests, amounting to several thousand people. After Chairman Kong Xiangxi performed the salutation, Kong delivered the opening address, stating that holding the tree-planting ceremony on the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death held profound significance. The purpose of planting trees is to cultivate forests, and the use of forests is not only to provide timber but also to eliminate floods and droughts, harmonize the climate, improve the soil, benefit hygiene, and is of great importance to people's livelihoods. Since the significance is so important, the government and the people should encourage each other to work earnestly and pragmatically to strive for the success of forestry construction. In my opinion, the development of Chinese forestry should adopt the following principles: (1) It is necessary to vigorously implement forest protection; (2) Implement afforestation; (3) Popularize forestry knowledge; (4) Support the development of private forestry. As for the success of national forestry construction, it is necessary for the people of the whole country to make unremitting efforts. I hope that the forestry industry will earnestly implement it, and I also hope that non-forestry colleagues will assist it so that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's policy of building large-scale forests throughout the country can be realized in a short period of time. Next, Central Committee Member Shao Yuanchong gave a speech, saying that today's tree-planting ceremony is of great significance. Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to the revolutionary cause, aiming to seek the survival of China and the entire nation. Therefore, in his will, he paid special attention to various construction undertakings in politics, society, and economy to create a new life for China. The afforestation matters are one part of the construction plan and is extremely closely related to the people's living conditions. For thousands of years, China has relied on the continuous efforts of its ancestors to have today, and the industry left by our ancestors is also very rich. If we simply allow it to decline without seeking development, we cannot fulfill our responsibilities to our descendants. To develop the heritage, we must express it through afforestation. The ancients said, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." It can be seen that planting trees and cultivating people are equally important at the same time. Therefore, if we want to complete the work of social construction, we must start from planting trees and cultivating people. To commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great spirit, we must express it through the afforestation movement. Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech saying that after the military is over, completing the revolutionary work must start with construction. The most important things are first, education, and second, agriculture. If education cannot be developed and agriculture cannot progress, the foundation of the country cannot be consolidated and the revolution cannot succeed. There is an old saying, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people," which is the most important method of nation-building. It takes ten years for trees to become timber, and a hundred years to cultivate talents. It shows that the construction of the revolution cannot be achieved overnight. We must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and work hard for hundreds of years, and then China will not be difficult to become strong. Today, we should know that it will take ten years for the trees to become timber, and during these ten years, we must also cultivate them to succeed. Education is also the same. Educators should cultivate students and ensure that they strictly abide by discipline so that they can become national talents a hundred years later. Now, I propose that the government order all provinces and counties to open at least 20 mu of nurseries in each province and 2 mu in each county starting this year, and use this as an assessment. This matter is an important plan for nation-building. I hope everyone will work together to promote its implementation. If this can be implemented, China will be rich and strong, and the revolution can be successful. Finally, Zhuang Songfu gave a speech, hoping that the old and young people across the country would plant trees together. Then, they went to the mountain field in front of the mausoleum to plant trees. Mr. and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek and other dignitaries all wielded hoes to plant a pine tree each, and wrote the words "planted by so and so" next to the trees. It was not until about 3 PM that they dispersed. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

Commemoration is not only a formality, but its great significance lies in striving to continue the spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed for the country and the nation under Dr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine to fulfill their legacy. Now that the National Revolution has not been completed, unequal treaties have not been abolished, and the Three Principles of the People have not been implemented, the responsibility of those who die later is heavy and great. I hope everyone will jointly take responsibility, be the successors of the martyrs, and continue to fight for the party, the country, the nation, and the doctrine to the end in order to achieve thoroughness, so as not to be ashamed of being Dr. Sun Yat-sen's followers. Zhongzheng (Chiang Kai-shek) today expresses his sincere intention to pay tribute to the martyrs on behalf of all walks of life, and also expresses his gratitude to all walks of life on behalf of the relatives of the martyrs, etc. After the ceremony, slogans were shouted and dispersed.

<p>The Franco-Italian naval agreement has now been announced. According to a telegram from British Prime Minister MacDonald to Reuters, the great value of the Franco-Italian naval agreement lies in its political influence. Less than a day after the agreement was concluded, the whole of Europe felt that the agreement could bring stability. This is a good prelude to next year's disarmament conference. In addition, British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander stated when submitting the naval budget in the House of Commons that the United States and Japan generally agreed with the Franco-Italian naval agreement, and all parts of the British Empire that attended the London Naval Conference unanimously approved it.

<p>British and French Departments Announce on the Same Day</p>
<p>Significant Changes in Ship Construction and Exchange Procedures, Italy Abandons the Principle of Equality with France, Franco-Italian Loan Negotiations Underway, Reuters, 11th. London Telegram. Officials announced today that the terms of the Franco-Italian naval agreement stipulate that by the end of 1936, France and Italy can each complete two capital ships, each with a displacement of no more than 23,333 tons and a gun caliber of no more than 12 inches. After these capital ships are built, France must destroy one battleship and Italy must destroy the first-class old cruisers weighing about 16,820 tons, totaling 33,640 tons. According to this agreement, the total tonnage of capital ships obtained by France and Italy increased from 175,000 tons to 181,000 tons. Before the end of 1936, France and Italy can each complete aircraft carriers of 34,000 tons and may not build cruisers with 6-inch or larger caliber guns after the 1930 procedure is completed, except for completing the 1930 procedure and supplementing the tonnage that is too old after the end of 1931. Submarines may no longer be built. The number of French submarine tons shall not exceed 81,989 tons before the end of 1936. This number can be determined by the naval issue discussed at the 1932 Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>National, 11th. Paris Telegram. This afternoon, the French Foreign Office released the content of the Franco-Italian naval agreement, which is similar to what was reported by foreign media. The agreement stipulates that Italy will abandon its naval equality request before 1936 and allow the French navy to exceed 150,000 tons. This tonnage is distributed to small warships, so France has another 150,000 tons of destroyers and 81,000 tons of submarines (this is the largest tonnage of submarines in the world). As for capital ships, both sides are equal at 181,000 tons each and can build aircraft carriers of 34,000 tons. Before the end of December 1936, the two countries can build two battleships of no more than 23,333 tons each, equipped with 12-inch guns to replace the old ships. However, it is also agreed that the French submarine tonnage can be revised at next year's Disarmament Conference. Reuters, 11th. London Telegram. British Prime Minister MacDonald sent a letter to Reuters, stating that the great value of the Franco-Italian naval agreement lies in its political influence. This excellent expression of goodwill and mutual assistance will naturally have a good political impact. Within twenty-four hours after the agreement was concluded, the whole of Europe also felt the stabilizing force of this agreement. This is a good prelude to the 1932 Disarmament Conference. If the countries meeting in Geneva in the future take on their responsibilities with the courage that France and Italy have now expressed, then the Disarmament Conference will surely become one of the most significant events in world history.</p>
<p>National, Paris, 11th Telegram. Today's announcement of the Franco-Italian naval agreement is believed by political circles to be the prelude to continued consultations between the two countries to resolve other county cases. Moreover, French Ambassador to Rome, Mr. Bomarchet, happened to return to France at this time and held several meetings with Foreign Minister Briand. Newspapers reported that Mr. Bo had received detailed instructions to open new negotiations in Rome and would also discuss the matter of France lending a large sum of money to Italy, but officials had previously strongly denied this statement.</p>
<p>Associated Press, 11th. Washington Telegram. The power to ratify all treaties in the United States rests with the Senate. There is much debate in Washington today as to whether the Franco-Italian naval agreement must be submitted to the Senate before it can take effect. Many people believe that if the agreement is incorporated into the 1930 London Naval Treaty, it is necessary to submit it to the Senate. The White House did not comment on this issue today, and the State Department also declined to express its opinion. However, Americans welcomed this agreement very much, viewing it as a major step towards world disarmament and could eliminate the conflict between France and Italy.</p>

First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander submitted the naval budget to the House of Commons today, stating that the new ship construction procedure for 1931 stipulates that the new warships to be built include two Leander-class cruisers, one 5,000-ton cruiser, one destroyer flotilla command ship, eight destroyers, four small warships, and three submarines, as well as one shallow-water gunboat. These are only ordinary supplements and are within the scope of the London Naval Treaty. He hopes that the Geneva Disarmament Conference will continue to make progress in reduction. If so, the British government will cancel, postpone, or change the above procedures. If the 1931 procedure is fully implemented, its expenditures will be reduced by 500,000 pounds compared with the 1930 procedure. The British government is willing to issue a written statement to the French government because France has agreed to limit the caliber of capital ship guns to 12 inches, stating that the British government itself agrees to use 12 inches as the maximum caliber of capital ship guns and will greatly reduce the existing maximum displacement of 35,000 tons. As for the number of Italian submarine tons, it will not exceed 52,000 tons, including more than 5,000 tons of submarines that are already old and will not be supplemented. France and Italy have both agreed not to build submarines before 1933 to await the decision of the 1932 World Disarmament Conference. From the British standpoint, the number of submarines is the most unsatisfactory part of the agreement, but the original French procedure has been greatly reduced. The United States and Japan generally agree with the agreement, and all parts of the British Empire that attended the London Naval Conference also unanimously approved it. According to the London Naval Treaty, Britain will dismantle four battleships of 25,000 tons each and one battlecruiser of 28,500 tons. The total naval expenditure is 51,605,000 pounds, a decrease of 342,000 pounds compared with last year. The naval personnel will be reduced by 3,400 people to 93,650 people. The British Navy has reduced its personnel by 10,000 people in the four years from April 1928 to April 1931.</p>

<p>The ruling party is extremely uneasy, and the political situation is about to change. The young and strong faction advocates changing the party leader. The opposition party intends to impeach the Prime Minister's responsibility. Japan Joint News, 12th. Tokyo Telegram. Centering on Prime Minister Hamaguchi's health problem, the political situation has become extremely serious. The ruling party is also extremely uneasy, and all kinds of actions have arisen. Some want to do their best to support Prime Minister Hamaguchi to maintain the regime in its current state, and some want to quickly establish a successor president to organize an extension cabinet. The actions of the Adachi and Tsujitani factions are becoming more and more concrete. This situation is not only enough to affect the fate of the cabinet, but also enough to have a major impact on the fate of the party. The top leaders are very worried. Japan Joint News, 12th. Tokyo Telegram. The Seiyukai party had expressed sympathy for Prime Minister Hamaguchi's attendance and tried to avoid directly attacking the Prime Minister. Now that its period has passed, it has returned to its original position as an opposition party and intends to point out the government's malpractices and impeach the Prime Minister's responsibility. Its top leaders agreed on countermeasures last night. The consensus was that although the Prime Minister had attended the parliament, he was still unable to attend the committee to answer the opposition party's questions. It is appropriate to resign quickly, otherwise it can be said to be deceiving the people. In view of the reality of responsible politics, it was decided to thoroughly impeach his misconduct.</p>

They demanded a guarantee of immediate consideration of their grievances before allowing entry. Half an hour after the door was opened, these 200 people returned, throwing stones at the Congress building and injuring more than ten loyal volunteers with sticks. Police arrived on the scene upon hearing the alarm, but Congress President Nariman pacified the crowd and they dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Sixth Anniversary of the Premier's Death <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Today (March 12th) at 8:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial ceremony for the sixth anniversary of the Premier's death in the main auditorium. The auditorium was adorned with the six characters "The Premier's Spirit is Immortal" at the top, and banners on both sides read: "To commemorate the Premier, we must unanimously support the Central Government and consolidate the foundation of the Party" and "To commemorate the Premier, we must promote local self-government and stabilize social order." Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Fo, Wang Chonghui, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, Wang Boqun, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, Ding Weifen, Kong Xiangxi, Liu Luyin, Zhu Jiahua, Ma Chaojun, Zhou Qigang, Kexinge, and Yu Jingtang, as well as representatives from various departments of the National Government, totaling approximately 450 people, attended. Yu Youren presided over the ceremony. After the music was played and respects were paid, Wu Jingheng delivered an opening address, stating that it has been six years since the Party lost its guiding master. He recalled that six years ago, when the Premier was in Beiping, despite his serious illness, he still rallied his spirits to visit various places and deliver speeches, promoting the doctrine of national salvation. The comrades who accompanied the Premier northward were all worried about his deteriorating health. On February 24th and thereafter, his illness worsened, and he passed away on this day six years ago. On his deathbed, he left the seven words "Peace, Struggle, Save China" as his final exhortation, the meaning of which is far-reaching. The Premier devoted his life to the pursuit of freedom and equality for China, leading the revolution with tireless struggle. Destruction was an unavoidable act during the revolutionary process, but the construction after destruction must seek a path in peace. However, the degree of peace varies, with superficial peace and practical peace, temporary peace and permanent peace. Only by achieving practical and permanent peace can we truly save the country. The Premier, fearing that people would be complacent with superficial and temporary peace, leading to a relapse into danger, and knowing that peace is not just about eliminating war, but also about ensuring that all people in the country have genuine freedom and equality, with no one sighing in despair, emphasized the word "struggle" to encourage a firm spirit to achieve this goal. The Premier's lifelong desire was to create a harmonious world and advocate for world peace, originally with a 30-year timeframe. The past 20 years have not achieved this, and only 10 years remain. He hoped that all Party comrades would remember the Premier's dying words, and strive for peace with unwavering determination, bearing the worries of the world before enjoying its pleasures, and not merely engaging in the empty ritual of an annual memorial, forgetting the true meaning of the Premier's national salvation. After the address, the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>On the same morning at 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life in the capital held a memorial service for the sixth anniversary of the Premier's death in the auditorium of the Nanjing City Party Headquarters. City Committee members Shi Weihuan, Xiao Jishan, Lai Lianlou, Tongsun, and representatives from various departments, associations, and mass organizations, totaling more than 200 people, attended. Shi Weihuan presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, the chairman delivered an address, stating that today is the sixth anniversary of the Premier's death. In the winter of the 13th year of the Republic (1924), the Premier, at the invitation of Duan Qirui and others, went north to negotiate a peaceful resolution to national affairs. At that time, Duan advocated for convening a rehabilitation conference, while the Premier advocated for convening a national conference. Before long, the Premier succumbed to a lingering illness and passed away on this day six years ago, leaving his compatriots behind. The Premier's spirit of universal love and generosity, and his contributions to the founding of the nation, cannot be fully described in words. The Premier's dying words instructed us to abolish unequal treaties and convene a national conference in the shortest possible time, both of which are currently being actively pursued. Regarding the issue of tariff autonomy in the abolition of unequal treaties, the work has been completed. Next, the issue of recovering jurisdiction has been actively negotiated since the 19th year (1930), and although there is still no progress, if the people can unite in a fervent movement and make the nations aware of the inviolability of the Chinese people's spirit, it will not be difficult to achieve this goal. Regarding the issue of convening a national conference, the Central Government has decided on the date of the conference and has also formulated a provisional constitution for the Party and the people to jointly abide by during the period of political tutelage. A drafting committee has been formed and will submit it to the national conference for resolution in the future. All of the above are manifestations of comrades following the Premier's teachings. All citizens should recognize the mission and importance of the national conference and jointly promote it. In particular, the people of the capital should quickly form farmers' associations, educational associations, and other organizations in accordance with the law to serve as models for the whole country. Furthermore, given the current economic hardship, the Party and the government are doing their utmost to seek social stability and production recovery. The people should also strive for frugality so as not to become bandits due to unemployment, which would make the problem of people's livelihood easier to solve. Today, in commemorating the Premier, we should uphold the Premier's legacy, encourage ourselves to move towards the path of light, and achieve the goal of saving China through peace and struggle. Next, Lai Lianlou delivered a speech, stating that in commemorating the Premier today, we should inherit the Premier's legacy and continue to fight against imperialism until we achieve the goal of abolishing unequal treaties, and implement the Premier's teachings by taking the Premier's spirit as our spirit and the Premier's great personality as our model. Only in this way will the commemoration be meaningful. After the speech, music was played and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e41">He Jian Personally Attends the Station to Pay Respects <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the Hunan Provincial Government received news of the transport of Zhang Huizan's coffin to Hunan for burial, it immediately appointed Cao Bowen, Zhang Kailian, Huang Shiheng, Song Hegeng, and Cao Dianqiu as members of the public funeral preparation committee, and appointed Cao Mengqi as the director of the public funeral office, allocating 6,000 yuan for funeral expenses. The public funeral office was established in the fire brigade to handle all matters. Zhang's coffin arrived in Hunan on the 8th via a special train from Wuchang and was scheduled to arrive in the province at noon on the 9th. The public funeral office notified all institutions and organizations in advance to come and welcome it at that time. From 11:00 AM on the 9th, people from all walks of life went to the station outside Xiaowumen to welcome the coffin, creating a sea of people. The area in front of and behind the station and along the ring road was almost impassable. At 11:30 AM, He Jian, accompanied by all members of the provincial government and Division Commander Tao Guang, arrived at the station to welcome the coffin. At 12:00 noon, the special train arrived. Soldiers and police fired guns and played mournful music. Family members boarded the train, caressing the coffin and crying in grief. People from all walks of life who came to welcome the coffin also bowed their heads in silence. Huang Xingyi, the representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Government stationed in Hunan, helped Zhang's young son Yuanmou and young daughter Yuanyi off the train and kowtowed to He Jian and other party, government, and military officials. He Jian and others took off their hats in return, tears streaming down their faces. The staff of the public funeral office immediately dispatched employees to carry Zhang's coffin off the train and place it on the platform. He Jian then accompanied party, government, and military officials to set up a table in front of the coffin to pay respects. The eulogy read: "On the ninth day of March in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, together with people from all walks of life, respectfully offer incense, paper money, clear wine, and fruits to the spirit of the late Teacher Zhang Shihou. You were a man of both literary and martial talents, a pioneer of the revolution who endured hardship. Your military achievements in the southwest provinces are evident, and you led the troops in the west of Jiangxi to defend against the rampant communists. You were ordered to eliminate the bandits, sacrificing your life for the country, and your remains could not be found. Your spirit returns to its origin, and your loyalty and righteousness are praised throughout the ages. A public memorial service was held in Ganzhou, and you were laid to rest with due ceremony. Your coffin was transported from Xun to Han and returned to your hometown. The National Government issued an order for a public funeral on a famous mountain, and all sectors of Hunan respectfully welcome you along the way. Your coffin carries your spirit, and the red flag flutters in the wind. May you go with us and not be afraid. We respectfully announce." After the eulogy, at 1:00 PM, a Zhongshan double-pole was used, and 128 people carried the coffin into the city. People from all walks of life who came to welcome the coffin were divided into seven groups and proceeded slowly in order: Group 1: (1) Large mourning flag (2) Guide horse (3) Large horn (4) Gong carriers (5) Military band (6) Troops Group 2: (1) National Government order pavilion (2) Western music (3) Public Security Bureau pistol team (4) Student teams from various schools (5) Wreath team Group 3: (1) Western music (2) Portrait pavilion (3) Security team (4) All orphans from the orphanage (5) Poor children's home Group 4: (1) Provincial government military music transport (2) Relics pavilion (3) Troops (4) Gong carriers (5) National music (6) Lantern carriers Group 5: (1) Main sedan chair (2) Western music band from the orphanage (3) Public law organizations (4) Qingyin Group 6: (1) Officials from various agencies (2) Eighteen Return military music band (3) Troops from the 18th Division (4) Guests (5) Relatives Group 7: (1) Loyal coffin (2) Western music (3) Changsha County team (4) Water and land police (5) Gong and drum shed From 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, they walked the entire route from the station, through Zhongshan Road, Fuxing Street, Taiping Street, West Archway, Octagonal Pavilion, and Xinjiekou, to the office, a distance of four or five li. The first group had already arrived at the office, while the fifth group was still at the station, which shows the large number of people. After Zhang's coffin arrived at the office, it was welcomed into the mourning hall and placed there. People who came to welcome the coffin took off their hats and paid their respects before dispersing. (March 10th)</p>

<p>South Road Correspondence: After the communist bandit Li Mingrui's remnants were defeated by the Fourth Route Army in eastern Hunan, they fled to the Chongyi, Youyou, and Ruyuan areas on the border of Jiangxi and Guangdong, hoping to join forces with Zhu Mao, Peng Huang, and the remnants of bandits in southern and western Jiangxi. According to news from Ganzhou, Li Mingrui led 2,000 bandits to Ruyuan County in northern Guangdong on the 3rd of this month. After being surrounded by the Eighth Route Army's Minghui, Guo Runhua political group, and the Fourth Route Army's Tang Boyin group, Li's bandits desperately broke out. After more than ten hours of fierce fighting, the Deng, Tang, and Guo groups killed a fake division commander Gong Chu, a company commander, platoon leaders, and more. 700 bandits were killed and hundreds of guns were seized. Li only led the remnants and 400-500 guns and fled east towards the border of Hunan and Jiangxi. Another part of Li's forces, about several hundred guns, fled to Dayu on the Guangdong border, where they encountered Lai Tianqiu of the Guangdong Army. Lai led his troops and the Min Tuan to launch a fierce attack. Li's bandits were unable to succeed and detoured from Nandu in Nan'an to Chongyi, where they captured Chongyi County on the 12th of last month. However, Xin Feng Yudu had the Twelfth Division's Ma Brigade and the Nineteenth Route Army stationed there. The bandits then planned to flee west to Suichuan or re-enter eastern Hunan. Chairman He has ordered the Fourth Route Army to join forces with the Eighth and Nineteenth Route Armies to encircle the bandits from three sides on the border of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan, and to eliminate them.</p>
<p>The Nineteenth Route Army's suppression of the remnants of bandits in various counties in southern Jiangxi has reopened traffic between Xinfeng, Wan'an, and Ganzhou. Only traffic between Yudu and Ganzhou has not been restored. However, Yudu County Magistrate Wang Jingming led the West Township, Luojiadu, and He Feng militias on the 4th to recover the county seat and rescue hundreds of hostages. The county submitted a document to the Nineteenth Route Army Headquarters, stating: "On the dawn of the 4th of this month, I led the militias of West Township, Luojiadu, and He Feng in the southern township to recover Yudu City. In this battle, we killed a fake chairman Huang Fosheng, captured bandit captain Jiang Luo, and captured more than ten important leaders. We released more than three or four hundred good citizens who had been kidnapped by the bandits. The remaining bandits have fled to the Buxia, Wengang, and Sanmentan areas in western Yudu. We have now organized city districts and militias in the east, west, and three townships to defend the key points. The city wall has been demolished and leveled, and the slightly larger houses have been destroyed by fire. In the entire city, apart from those who fled and were killed by the bandits, there are only children under the age of ten and elderly women over the age of fifty. The stoves are cold and the houses are silent, a desolate sight that even the most iron-hearted person would shed tears. According to a letter from Ningdu (bordering Yudu), Zhu Mao originally used Ningdu as their base. Recently, because the government troops surrounded Ningdu on all sides, the bandits feared being completely eliminated and fled to Ruijin and Guangchang. The communist fake Twelfth and Twenty-second Armies stationed in Ningdu have moved to the Huangpi area. There are no bandits in Ningdu City, but the rural bandits in the four townships are still extremely rampant. The bandit areas have been repeatedly looted, and there is a severe shortage of grain. Although the bandits have searched everywhere for grain, there is nothing left. In recent days, the communists have only eaten one meal a day, are extremely panicked, and are fleeing in increasing numbers." According to refugees from Ningdu, the communists are currently distributed in the Huangpi and Xiaobu areas. Hundreds of refugees who sought refuge in the Jinjing Cave were brutally killed without exception. Women between the ages of sixteen and fifty were all forced to marry communists. All people in the bandit area were forced to have the characters "bandit transformation" and "red transformation" branded on their hands. (March 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e45">A Glimpse of the Run on the Guangdong Central Bank <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<h3 id="e46">Gradual Calming After Several Days <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to a rumor that circulated in the Guangdong province recently, people rushed to the Central Bank to exchange their Central Bank notes for cash, causing a run on the Central Bank starting on the 3rd of this month. However, this rumor was entirely fabricated by those with nervous dispositions. The rumor will soon die down, and the credibility of the Central Bank notes will naturally recover. The run on the Central Bank has been more pronounced at the Nandi headquarters, with people waiting in front of the Yonghan Road branch and the Xidi office. According to the staff of the bank, on the 4th, the Nandi headquarters and the Xidi and Yonghan branches exchanged approximately 110,000 yuan in cash. On the 5th, the headquarters exchanged approximately 300,000 yuan in cash, and the Xidi and Yonghan branches exchanged a total of 30,000 yuan. On the 6th, approximately 300,000 to 400,000 yuan were exchanged. In total, the Central Bank exchanged 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in cash over the three days. Because the Central Bank has sufficient cash, people can exchange it as soon as they arrive, so the number of people exchanging cash has gradually decreased since yesterday. Furthermore, to facilitate exchanges for women, the Central Bank plans to open a separate exchange area for women at the headquarters. To alleviate public concerns, the bank has been continuously transporting cash from the vault to the exchange area and has also opened four additional exchange windows at the headquarters. Still fearing crowds, the bank has requested the government to send military police and special agents to maintain order. Since the 6th, the number of people exchanging cash has gradually decreased. From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, only about 300 people exchanged cash, and only about 400 people exchanged cash in the afternoon. Moreover, those who exchanged cash were mostly exchanging 5, 10, and 50 yuan notes, with very few 1 yuan notes. This is because 1 yuan notes are still circulating in the market, and even if you exchange them for silver dollars at a money exchange shop, you only pay a 3 cent commission. As for the silver market, because the price of Central Bank notes has not fallen sharply, the exchange rate has not fluctuated dramatically. On the 5th, the discount on Hong Kong HSBC silver coins rose to 38, but on the 6th, it had already fallen back to 29. From this observation, it can be seen that the price of Central Bank notes is higher than on the 5th. The authorities have been very calm about this run on the Central Bank because they know that this trend is entirely caused by speculators in the silver industry who have misheard rumors. They are currently trying to investigate those who are engaged in speculation and punish them severely. Central Bank Governor Shen Zaiji returned to the province from Hong Kong on the 6th after the incident. According to Shen, he expects this trend to subside soon and believes that there is absolutely no problem. Furthermore, to ensure that tax revenue is received in Central Bank notes for regulation purposes, the Finance Department has also issued a notice to all its subordinate agencies that all tax revenue over one yuan should be received in Central Bank notes to comply with the regulations. Any forced receipt of silver dollars will be severely punished upon investigation. (March 7th)</p>

<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Now that the cold winter has passed, the Longhai Railway is actively carrying out accumulated railway affairs. The main points are as follows: (1) The Western Route has decided to complete the extension and repair of the Lingbao-Tongguan section first, and then extend it to Xi'an. The railway bureau has prepared special trains to transport materials and has issued a public notice of protection by the Luoyang military camp, which reads: "It is hereby announced that the construction of the Lingbao-Tongguan section of the Longhai Railway has commenced. The railway engineering bureau has prepared four special trains to transport materials in shifts to meet urgent needs. This special train is essential to the project, and no troops shall detain it for any reason when it passes through the stations, so as to ensure a steady supply of materials and complete the project as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. Anyone who dares to disobey will be charged with sabotaging transportation and will not be leniently treated. This order is hereby issued to all troops for compliance." (2) After cleaning up, the vehicles of the railway that flowed into other railways have been gradually returned. The Jinpu Railway has returned four large locomotives, and the Jinghu Railway has returned three locomotives. The railway has also purchased four new locomotives from abroad, which are expected to arrive in Pukou on the 13th. The railway bureau has allocated vehicles to transport them. The Jinghu Railway still owes the railway two locomotives, which will be compensated for. (3) The opening of Haizhou Port has also been implemented, and the dredging machine has been transported to Haizhou. The plan to dredge and open the port is to imitate the Qingdao model. The construction of a branch line from Bayiji to Taierzhuang has been surveyed and is waiting for approval to begin construction. This branch line is to facilitate the transportation of Zhongxing Coal Mine. (March 11th)</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Shandong Province suffered repeated wars last year, leaving the land scarred and filled with bandits. Although the authorities have sent troops to suppress the bandits, the people in various counties are struggling to survive in the aftermath. At this time of year, when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is yet to come, life is extremely difficult, and they have no choice but to go out to make a living. As a result, the trains coming from the east on the Jiaoji Railway are extremely crowded, mostly with emaciated disaster victims. These disaster victims mostly live in counties along the Jiaoji Railway. After disembarking in Qingdao, they take ships north to Dalian and then go to various places in the Northeast. According to investigations, on the 7th, the Gongtong Jiuzai steamship carried 1,000 men and women to the Northeast. The Dalian Jiuzai steamship carried 800 people. On the 8th, the Lianxing steamship carried 1,200 people. Another ship carried over 1,000 people. Other ships heading north also carried passengers, no fewer than 2,000 people per day. In total, over 10,000 people have left in recent days, and those taking trains to Qingdao and boarding ships northward are still coming in an endless stream. (March 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Shanxi Provincial Government Strictly Bans Drugs <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: At its third meeting the other day, the Shanxi Provincial Government Committee discussed the issue of drug eradication and decided to telegraph the Central Government to approve the formulation of separate regulations, allowing the death penalty for those who manufacture and sell gold pills, material powder, and other drugs. At the same time, it issued a notice to all agencies and schools to conduct strict investigations of their staff to dismiss those who are addicted. The telegram and notice were revised and passed at the fourth meeting yesterday and have been issued. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Central Government, National Government President Chiang, Nanjing: We respectfully report that Shanxi Province has been strictly enforcing the ban on opium for nearly 20 years, and the investigations and labeling of opium harm have been quite effective. However, since the military uprisings of the 15th year of the Republic (1926), the harm of opium has not yet been eradicated, and gold pills, material powder, and other drugs made from morphine, cocaine, heroin, and other toxic substances have taken advantage of the opportunity to come in large quantities. The import of these toxic substances not only affects the national economy but also concerns the survival of the race. The harm is even greater than that of opium, and the crime of those who traffic and manufacture them is even more serious than that of those who consume them. Following the provisions of Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law promulgated by the government, the maximum penalty for opium offenders shall not exceed five years and a fine limited to 5,000 yuan. Criminals have a way to survive, making it difficult to curb their desire to re-offend after serving their sentence. Moreover, with great profit involved, the stricter the ban, the more ingenious the methods of manufacturing and trafficking become. Cunning people take risks and hope for luck, while the government exhausts its wisdom and resources. Not only can the source not be cut off, but it is even more rampant than before. This phenomenon is due to the lightness of the punishment, which is not enough to deter their desire for profit. If the punishment is not increased, there is no way to remedy the situation. We propose to consider the particularly serious situation of narcotic drug poisoning in Shanxi Province and approve the formulation of separate regulations, allowing the death penalty for those who traffic and manufacture gold pills, material powder, and various drugs, with more serious circumstances, in order to quickly extinguish the drug flame and live up to the President's painstaking efforts to ban opium. As this matter concerns the law, we are issuing this telegram to request instructions for implementation.</p>
<p>Order to All Agencies: It has been found that cigarettes, pills, and drug powder are extremely harmful. Those poisoned by them not only harm their lives and ruin their families but also endanger the national economy. Since the implementation of the opium ban in this province, repeated regulations have been issued to investigate and ban officials and employees of various agencies and teachers and students of various schools from smoking drugs and opium. However, the heads of various agencies have been indulgent and concealed the truth, making few reports. This not only goes against the government's intention to strictly enforce the opium ban but also violates the gentleman's teaching of loving people with virtue. It must be known that the implementation of government orders relies entirely on outstanding members to lead. Public officials of various agencies and students of various schools are in outstanding positions. How can they serve the people if their addictions are not eliminated? Now that the government has been established, it is determined to eradicate drugs. Therefore, we reiterate the previous order and attach the previous regulations for investigating and banning personnel of various agencies from trafficking in and smoking opium, pills, and drugs. You are hereby ordered to comply and instruct your subordinates to strictly inspect their staff and students. Those who are addicted shall be immediately dismissed and sent to the appropriate court for punishment in accordance with the law. If those who do not seriously inspect and are reported with evidence, in addition to punishing the individual in accordance with the law, the head of the agency shall also be severely punished. This matter concerns the opium ban, an important political issue. All must strictly abide by it and not be negligent. Attached are the regulations for investigating and banning personnel of various agencies from smoking opium, pills, and drugs: (Article 1) The heads of various agencies and the principals of schools shall be responsible for regularly inspecting their staff, soldiers, and students. If anyone is suspected of smoking opium, pills, or drugs, they shall be suspended or dismissed. Those with evidence shall be sent to the appropriate judicial organ for punishment in accordance with the law. (Article 2) If the heads of various agencies and the principals of schools do not seriously inspect and are reported with evidence of their staff, soldiers, and students trafficking in or smoking opium, pills, or drugs, in addition to punishing the individual in accordance with the law, the head of the agency shall also be severely punished. (Article 3) The heads of various agencies and the principals of schools shall be inspected at any time by the highest head of their jurisdiction. Those who smoke opium, pills, or drugs or are reported with evidence shall be punished in accordance with the law. (Article 4) These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

<h3 id="e52">Chen Yantong's Trip to Discuss Matters with Pan, The Governor <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the various matters of reorganizing the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, a Tianjin dispatch states that Chen Yantong, the chairman of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Reorganization Committee, along with committee member Sun Mou and the chief of the traffic department, traveled to Tianjin on the 26th of last month to discuss cooperation matters with various railway lines in Liaoning. They also negotiated with the South Manchuria Railway regarding the purchase of new locomotives, the repair of old ones, and the rental of vehicles.  They completed their work a few days ago and returned south, passing through Tianjin en route to Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou Railway) to discuss methods for Shi Yousan to return the trains and settle accounts. After staying in Pinghan for one day, Chen arrived in Tianjin this morning. According to Chen's account in Tianjin, his trip to the Northeast was as follows: he first met with Deputy Commander Zhang, but due to Zhang's cold, the conversation was brief. In the second meeting, they talked for a long time. Zhang greatly approved of the plan for domestic railways to unite and develop together. Finally, he visited Director Gao of the Beining (Beijing-Shenyang) Railway regarding the request for the Tangshan Locomotive Factory to repair vehicles, but because the factory is currently very busy, it cannot undertake the task. The Pingpu (Beijing-Pukou) express train currently only runs five times a week and is very crowded. There are plans to increase the number of vehicles and change the schedule to daily departures. Director Gao also expressed willingness to help with the vehicle matter. In addition, they also discussed cooperation between railways, such as expanding locomotive factories to manufacture their own vehicle parts and locomotives. As for the negotiations with the South Manchuria Railway regarding the repair of vehicles and the purchase of locomotives, there were no significant results. The Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan) Railway had previously had the South Manchuria Railway manufacture four locomotives, each costing 30,000 Japanese yen, which was cheaper than Western products. Therefore, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway intended to continue the Jiaoji Railway's contract and have the South Manchuria Railway manufacture several locomotives. However, the South Manchuria Railway claimed that the locomotives manufactured for the Jiaoji Railway had already resulted in losses and they could no longer manufacture them at that price. If they were to manufacture them, the price per locomotive would have to be increased to 35,000 yen, which was too high, so no agreement was reached. In addition, they requested the South Manchuria Railway to repair vehicles, but the price set by the South Manchuria Railway was also very expensive. Even the Japanese said it was not cost-effective and advised against repairing them, so that was also abandoned. There are plans to have the South Manchuria Railway send people to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to inspect the vehicles that need to be repaired so that a long-term plan can be made. (March 10)</p>

<p>Ye Yixiong Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Ye Declares Dissatisfaction and Decides to Appeal. A dispatch from Shenyang reports that the case of Binjiang Court Judge Ye Yixiong shooting and killing Zhang Liqing, which shocked both China and foreign countries, has been under the jurisdiction of the Shenyang District Court after being transferred from the Binjiang Court. After the first public trial, the victim claimed to be ill and did not appear, so the court sent the presiding judge to Harbin for questioning. Upon returning to Shenyang, the second hearing was held, and the court declared the debate closed. Today (the 9th), the court announced the verdict: Ye Yixiong was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent deprivation of civil rights for attempted murder and embezzlement, and was also sentenced to one year of imprisonment for illegally carrying a handgun. If the defendant is not satisfied, he may file an appeal within ten days. Ye declared in court on this day that he was dissatisfied and decided to file an appeal within the next few days.

<h3 id="e54">Su Bingwen Visits Zhang to Report on Border Defense <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Border areas are secure; no Russian troops have invaded our territory. A dispatch from Shenyang reports that Su Bingwen, the commander of the Eastern Province Railway Protection Army, the commander of the Hulunbuir Garrison, and the commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Heilongjiang Army Infantry, along with Zhang Dianjiu, the commander of the 1st Brigade of Infantry and the deputy commander of the Railway Protection Army, passed through Harbin and Changchun and arrived in Shenyang at 2 p.m. on the 8th, staying at the Lingge Hotel. According to Su and Zhang, the border defense in the area is extremely solid, and the people are living peacefully. No Russian troops have entered our territory. Although Russian troops are stationed on the Russian border for their country's defense, the rumors of Russian troops entering our territory are exaggerated. The purpose of this trip to Shenyang is because they have not visited Deputy Commander Zhang for over a year. Zhang will be going to Beiping (Beijing) soon, so they came to report on the border defense situation. They have no other mission and will visit Chairman Wan tomorrow (the 9th) and then visit Deputy Commander Zhang. They will stay in Shenyang for about four or five days before returning to their posts. (March 8)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Panchen Lama Departs from Mongolia to Shenyang <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Border Affairs Office personnel go to the Bailing Wangfu (Prince Bailing's Residence) to welcome him. The Finance Department allocates 4,000 yuan for reception expenses. It is rumored that he will stay in Shenyang for an extended period. A dispatch from Shenyang reports that the Panchen Erdeni, who was originally scheduled to come to Shenyang from Mongolia before the Lunar New Year to spend the winter, had his reception arranged by the Border Affairs Office with personnel and carriages sent to welcome him. However, due to heavy snow in the Ujumqin Banner region of Mongolia, travel was disrupted, and he could not depart within the Lunar New Year. Therefore, he sent a telegram requesting that personnel not be sent to welcome him to avoid the hardship of the journey. The snow in the Ujumqin Banner has recently melted, and transportation has resumed.  The Panchen Lama departed from the Haotao Temple in the North Bailing Banner of Northern Mongolia yesterday (the 8th), accompanied by more than one hundred attendants. Personnel from the Border Affairs Office will soon take cars and horses from the Datong Branch Road to Tongliao and then to the Bailing Wangfu to welcome the Panchen Lama. Zhong Suming, the Panchen Lama's representative in Panjin (Shenyang), and Losang Nojie, the Panchen Lama's representative in Beiping, will also accompany them to welcome him. It is estimated that he will arrive in Shenyang at the end of the first lunar month, and the Huang Temple is still designated as the Panchen Lama's residence. The Panchen Lama's reception office has prepared everything and has received 4,000 yuan from the Finance Department for expenses. It is rumored that the Panchen Lama will stay in Shenyang for an extended period, and the trip to Qinghai may be cancelled due to inconvenient transportation. (March 8)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Brief News from Shenyang <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the two secretariats of the Political Committee and the Border Affairs Office have been extremely busy with the election of representatives for the National Assembly and the legality of the organizational regulations of various legal entities. After detailed review, it was found that many of the organizations of these legal entities did not comply with the regulations of the National Government, and the Party Committee made many criticisms and instructed them to make corrections. They replied that the time was too short and they couldn't make it in time. The quota of fifteen representatives has already been internally decided but not yet announced, with each person receiving 1,000 yuan for travel expenses.</p>
<p>The personnel for the reorganization of the Deputy Commander's Headquarters and the Border Defense Command have all been internally decided, starting from the rank of major and above. This matter is entirely controlled by Zhang himself, just like the previous appointment of personnel when entering the customs. They will be announced when the time is right. Zhang will take out his diary and speak out the names, and then the Secretariat will issue the orders. No one knows about it beforehand. Some officials in the provincial capital have already been slightly changed. Sun Xuchang, the head of the police department, has been transferred to be the supervisor of the Andong Customs due to his sloppy work. Bai Mingzhen, the head of the Public Security Bureau of Anmin (Shenyang), has been transferred to be the head of the Yingkou Public Security Bureau. The two vacancies left by Sun and Bai will be filled by Huang Jingzhong (Xiansheng), the commander of the 20th Brigade. Huang's vacancy will be temporarily filled by the chief of staff. It is said that Huang is only twenty-two or three years old and is a true military man who has served as Zhang's bodyguard regiment commander and brigade commander. He accompanied Zhang to Beijing last time as the head of the adjutant's office. There are also other personnel changes, such as Secretary-General Wang Shuhan. If Zhang orders him to go to Beijing to serve on the National Committee, then the position of Secretary-General will likely be taken by Wu Jiaxiang, the current member of the Provincial Government, concurrently the director of education, and the chief of the confidential office. The provincial secretary-general and director of education will be succeeded by Jin Yufulu. Yesterday, Secretary-General Wang told people that he will leave or not is up to Zhang's orders. Although there are many rumors outside, he still does not know the truth. (March 9)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Harbin Merchants Request Reduction of Freight Rates on the East Manchuria and South Manchuria Railways <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>While also requesting the speedy construction of the Harbin-Taonan Railway. A dispatch from Harbin reports that today, eight organizations, including the Harbin Municipal Chamber of Commerce, submitted a joint petition to the Special Region Administrative Chief's Office requesting a letter be forwarded to the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau and the Manchuria Railway Office to reduce freight rates. They also scheduled a meeting for representatives from various organizations to submit a petition to the Eastern Railway Bureau and the Manchuria Railway Office on the 9th of this month. If no results are achieved, they will proceed with issuing 10 million in public bonds to build a section of the railway between Harbin and Taonan in order to bypass the East Manchuria and South Manchuria Railways. The text of their petition to the Administrative Chief's Office is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Chinese Eastern and South Manchuria Railways are connected and run through the north and south of the three provinces. They are the only key transportation hubs for opening up trade between China and foreign countries and nurturing the local economy. The fact that Northeast China presents such a prosperous and growing scene today cannot be said to be unrelated to these two railways. However, since the sovereignty of the railways is not in our hands, their various policies and measures often do not fully conform to local conditions. Taking the freight rate as an example, its high level is often enough to put industry and commerce at a disadvantage. In the era of stable gold prices, our industrialists and merchants could still endure the pain. However, since the soaring gold prices last year, due to both railways using gold coins as their base currency, the rise in freight rates has further prompted local industry, commerce, and all trades to be on the verge of bankruptcy. All domestic specialties have been cut off from the opportunity to export, while other foreign goods have been cut off from the source of import. Finance has no source to be active, industry and commerce have no source to rely on for turnover, and labor has no source to rely on for livelihood. The so-called 'What can they achieve? They will all drown together' is the pressing phenomenon of today. It is recalled that during the European War, when gold prices plummeted, the two railways urgently maintained their own interests and once increased freight rates. Manchukuo currency increased from 1,498 to 2,202, and the Eastern Railway increased from one to two times. At that time, the market price of gold was only 140 taels of silver per ten taels, and gold tickets and gold rubles required 2.45 yuan to exchange for one Harbin dollar. Compared to today, when every ten taels of gold has been raised to over 780 taels and every gold ticket or gold ruble can be exchanged for around three Harbin dollars, the exchange rate of gold and silver is an inverse proportion. The difference between now and then is more than seven times. And the current freight rate, which is higher than in the past, is also equal to this number. In the past, freight rates were increased due to the drop in gold prices. Now, freight rates should be reduced due to the rise in gold prices. This is a matter of fairness. Therefore, in terms of today's gold prices, the freight rates of the two railways should be restored to the old regulations before the European War. Even if it is said that the current situation is different and it is difficult to reduce this amount of silver suddenly, at the very least, the standard for determining freight rates should also be determined according to the gold price of this time last year. Last year, the market price of gold on this day was 480 taels of silver per ten taels, which is more than 60% lower than the current market price of 780 taels. Large factories in the East and West, following the trend of gold and silver fluctuations, have all lowered the prices of their products compared to the past by 30-40%. For example, round and square iron imported from Europe used to be worth 9 gold pounds, but now it has fallen to 6 pounds. Cloth imported from Japan used to be worth 7 gold tickets per bolt, but now it has fallen to 5.1 yuan. Also, coal from Fushun used to be 13.1 gold tickets per ton, but now it has fallen to 9.3 yuan. They are private businesses purely for profit, and their factories and purchasers are able to make turnovers. If the railway, which is responsible for facilitating transportation and developing the economy, only considers its own interests and does not listen to the pain of the local people, it is not allowed by reason. Moreover, the interests of the local people and the railway are closely related. Since the soaring gold prices, freight rates have remained unchanged, causing the people to suffer economically and have to avoid using the railway. Passengers walk on the roads, and goods are entrusted to horses for transportation, severely restoring the old situation of traffic jams decades ago. If the two railways were to make a statistic, they would clearly understand this situation from their income in recent months. The high freight rate is not only unfavorable to the local people, but also unfavorable to the railway itself. For the sake of the two railways, they should also make changes and reduce freight rates to maintain the local economy, which is to maintain the railway itself. The Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, as the leaders of industry and commerce, see the urgency of the market and have to stand up and appeal. They plan to elect representatives to make vigorous protests to the authorities of the two railways in the coming days, and will only stop after achieving their goals. However, in terms of the current situation in Northeast China, demanding the two railways to lower freight rates is only a temporary solution. To plan for the long-term, there should be a more distant plan. The sovereignty of the two railways is not in our hands, as we have said before. If the matter is simply beneficial to the local people, they will naturally not be willing to provide full assistance where there is a conflict of interest with them. Therefore, if we want Northeast China to have a future of unprecedented development, we should urgently build the Harbin-Taonan Railway to relieve the pain of being bound by the two railways. It is said that the distance from Harbin to Taonan, passing through Jianzhou, Daqing and other places, is only a little over a thousand li (about 500 kilometers), and there are no high mountains in the middle, making it easier to lay the railway. It is estimated that 20 million yuan would be sufficient to cover the cost of building this road. This construction cost may be allocated from the treasuries of the three provinces or by raising railway public bonds, which is not a large amount and should not be difficult. Alternatively, we can imitate the story of the Feng-Hai Railway, with the people of the three provinces buying shares to build it. Once the project is completed, the three provinces will be connected, and we can directly regard the Chinese Eastern and South Manchuria Railways as nothing. The Northeast is vast, rich in resources, and has long been known to the world. Taking only special agricultural products as an example, they are often sufficient to supply the needs of countries around the world. With our unlimited special products, we can exchange them for unlimited money. The three provinces should be prosperous and wealthy, with every family well-fed and every person sufficient. But when we examine the reality, it is not so. This is because we cannot control the sovereignty of transportation, and all the benefits that we should have received are repeatedly seized by others. We can only bow our heads and pick up the scraps. For years, the people of the country have been saddened by the economic aggression of imperialism, and Northeast China is at the forefront of this. Our government and people should rise up together, with one heart and one mind, to complete the thousand-plus li railway between Harbin and Taonan as soon as possible. All the products of the three provinces can be transported directly to Huludao via our own route and then distributed to the East and West Oceans. At this time, whether it is our own route, we will consider everything that can develop the local economy and maintain the people's livelihood. Even if the stipulated freight rate is not much different from the Chinese Eastern and South Manchuria Railways, it is still better to supply the income of the people to the country for the sake of the country, rather than handing over the benefits to foreigners. Moreover, in the northern part of the three provinces, there are still 60-70% of the lands that have not been cultivated. In recent years, various public and private parties in the country have repeatedly organized immigration to open up land, but they have been hindered by the railways' unwillingness to provide assistance, and there has been little success to this day. If the Harbin-Taonan Railway is completed, immigration can be realized as soon as possible, not only can the wilderness be completely reclaimed and the resources of the country developed, but also the borders can be strengthened to prevent the covetousness of foreigners. The consolidation of the country's border defense is based on this road. Recently, the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have repeatedly gathered to discuss countermeasures to save the market. They all agreed that the former is to save the crisis for a while, and the latter is to seek benefits for a hundred years. It is necessary to do both at the same time to be effective. Therefore, we have prepared a document and respectfully request your office to review and forward it to the relevant departments for implementation."

<p>A Local Security Guard Robbed: Yao Xingsheng, a local security guard in Xiangsi Tu, Erqu near Desheng Port, was robbed. His daughter was about to get married, and the trousseau was mostly prepared. Unexpectedly, at about 1 a.m. on the 11th, eight robbers suddenly came, led by someone with a handgun, and broke into the house, taking away all the trousseau and other items, resulting in a loss of several hundred yuan. The victim has reported the incident to the nearby 4th District branch station for investigation. The Public Security Bureau has uncovered a large gambling den in Xinqiao. The County Public Security Bureau recently reported that gambling is rampant in Xinqiao, with various forms such as dice and pai gow. The bureau sent 12 police officers led by officials through a small road to raid the town the night before last. As expected, they found a crowd gambling wildly in a certain tea house, just as they were shouting numbers. Seeing that there were not many police officers, the gamblers closed the gate, intending to resist. Fortunately, the police officers all had box guns to show off, so no major disaster occurred. The owner, Zhou, and more than a dozen gamblers were arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau for punishment yesterday morning.</p>

His father had passed away early, and his mother, who was still alive, was over sixty years old. However, Kunquan was naturally arrogant and addicted to bad habits. He often demanded money from his mother. If she didn't comply, he would beat her. Because of this abuse, his mother went to the county to file a complaint a few years ago. After the county government investigated the case, the filial son, Kunquan, was sentenced to one year and three months in prison. Recently, he had been released from prison and still smoked opium and did not repent. However, he was unusually short of money. The day before yesterday, he first cut his throat with scissors and then stabbed his stomach with a sharp knife, immediately bleeding profusely and dying.</p>

<p>The Strange Disappearance of Three Elementary School Students: Wang Ayu, Jiang Liangda, and He Yuchang, three students from Class B of the first grade of the Wuyi Bureau Qianjie Elementary School, were all about seven or eight years old. They went to school on the morning of the 10th, and suddenly disappeared when the roll was called in the second class. The families went to the school to inquire in the afternoon and learned of their disappearance. The families immediately gathered to discuss and search in Suzhou, Wuxi, Shanghai, and various towns, but they did not return until the afternoon of the 11th without any news. They immediately reported to the Public Security First Branch together with the principal, Qian Ziwei, and asked the police to pay attention. In the evening, the family of Jiang Liangda and Wang Ayu suddenly received a letter from the Second District Police Station of Shanghai, stating that their sons Jiang Liangda and Wang Ayu were being held at the station and should be retrieved with a guarantor. The family of He Yuchang was suddenly sent back by railway police at about 8 p.m. When asked about the circumstances of the student's disappearance, the student said that after purchasing snacks at the school's sales point, he was patted on the head and lost consciousness. Then, on the train, he saw an old man accompanying him who looked quite fierce. Therefore, after this incident occurred, the people in the area paid close attention to it and considered it to be strange.</p>

<p>Bandits rampant between Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Yang Xieyue, a major bandit in eastern Henan, recently led more than 2,000 bandits to occupy the Yongcheng, Guoyang, and Xiaoxian counties at the junction of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The people there suffer unbearably from their ravages. Recently, they were severely suppressed by the Seventh Division in Xiaoxian territory and are likely to flee back to eastern Henan. It is reported that the bandits are organized like the military and still fly the flag of the Provisional Fourth Division. It was found that the division was originally Qin Jinlin's mixed army, which was surrounded and disarmed by the Henan National Army in the Luyi and Ningling areas last month. Now, the bandits are still using the name of the Fourth Division to loot everywhere. The bandit leader Yang Xieyue calls himself the commander of the First Brigade of the Provisional Fourth Division, and Zhang Keming is the deputy brigade commander. It is estimated that there are more than 2,000 people. Whenever they arrive at a place, the bandit leaders extort grain and fodder from the local area in the name of false positions, and then continue to loot. It is reported that the Jiangsu and Henan National Army are jointly encircling and suppressing them in order to eliminate them.</p>

The meeting was presided over by Chief of Staff Xu Jinyuan, who performed the ceremony. The chairman's report briefly stated the significance of the sixth anniversary, saying that the Premier had great ambitions, extensive reading, steadfast revolution, and the ability to succeed in a great career.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Government held the sixth anniversary commemorative meeting of the Premier's death at 9:00 AM. The Secretary-General, bureau chiefs, staff members, and trainees from the local autonomy training center, totaling more than 400 people, attended the meeting. The Mayor, as the chairman, delivered a speech, which is recorded as follows: Today is the sixth anniversary of the Premier's death. In this sorrowful and solemn day, everyone must have a feeling of grief for the Premier that deepens with each passing day. Brothers also feel the same way. Recalling last year today, when we held the fifth anniversary commemoration here, brothers said that the Premier's great personality and noble achievements, we should admire him, and also said that the Premier's birthday is the beginning of all revolutionary memorial days, and the Premier's death anniversary is an important part of the national revolutionary history, we should deeply commemorate it, and we must clearly understand the Premier's unfinished ambitions, unfulfilled wishes, and the responsibilities entrusted to the people of Jin, and how to strive to realize them. Director Pan's speech on that day put forward the Premier's proposition of peace and struggle to save China to awaken our attention. Now another year has passed, and we think about it with great shame, because since the fifth anniversary was held last year, our revolutionary soldiers have been engaged in the suppression of rebellion, sacrificing countless lives, and the national strength has been achieved. The purpose of national unity is the hope for a solid foundation for the party and the country. The efforts of armed comrades can be said to be worthy of the Premier's mission and can comfort the Premier's spirit in heaven. However, in the political aspect, due to related reasons, we have not been able to strive for construction according to the predetermined procedures. We have to say that this is the most regrettable thing for us. How to make amends and remedy the situation is what we should earnestly recognize and make up our minds to do today in front of the Premier. In terms of our own duties, how to consolidate the foundation of autonomy in this city and how to develop the establishment of Yin in the tutelage period is a matter of course. At the same time, we should also know that the most urgent national issues at present are two: First, the central government convenes the National Congress, and the central government stipulates that the National Congress will be held on May 5. This May 5 is the anniversary of the establishment of the revolutionary government and the inauguration of the Premier as President, and it is of course of great significance. The National Congress is convened based on the Premier's last instructions, as everyone knows. In his will, the Premier entrusted us to promote its realization in the shortest period of time, but the Premier has been dead for six weeks, and now it is only being convened. This is a very painful thing. The National Congress is to ensure peaceful unification and avoid all future wars. In other words, the National Congress is the hope of our Chinese nation's life, so we should pay close attention to it, gather our efforts to promote its realization. Secondly, we should pay attention to the abolition of unequal treaties. Now the reactionary forces are gradually weakened, but the imperialists continue to infringe on our independence and hinder our construction by political and economic means. If the unequal treaties cannot be abolished, then our country still cannot be free, and our nation still cannot develop. Therefore, the two major events in the Premier's will are the convening of the National Congress and the abolition of unequal treaties, which must be promoted for realization in the shortest period of time. Now that the National Congress is in progress, then we can say that one major event has already started, and of course we have to work hard on the remaining one. If we can work hard from today to achieve the goal, then when we come to commemorate the Premier again next year, we can comfort the Premier's spirit in heaven. I hope that my colleagues and comrades and compatriots across the country will work together and strive to do it.</p>

In addition to the usual formalities: (1) Tree planting song was sung; (2) Mayor Zhang delivered an opening speech; (3) Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan, President Hu Shuhua of Tongji University, Wang Yansong representing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Deputy Director Cai Wuji of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and President Liu Zhanen of Shanghai University successively gave speeches; (4) Parade and tree planting; (5) Photographing; (6) Adjournment. The speeches are recorded below.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Speech: Everyone, today is the Shanghai Municipal Government's fourth annual tree planting ceremony. The significance of the tree planting movement has been explained in detail in the speeches and reports at each tree planting ceremony. Simply put, promoting afforestation in the city (1) benefits hygiene; (2) enhances aesthetic sense. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that aesthetic sense is closely related to national civilization. Other disaster prevention is also closely related to afforestation. There is no need to elaborate further now. We remember that the first tree planting ceremony held by the Municipal Government was at Xiaomu Bridge, the second at Pudong, and the third at Damu Bridge. Each year, the location was different. This year, however, it was chosen here, which is even more important than in previous years because the facts tell us that the population of Shanghai is increasing year by year, and various events are also progressing year by year. The trend of development is moving northward. In consideration of the actual needs, we must follow this trend of development to formulate the plan for Greater Shanghai. Therefore, the Municipal Government has spent a lot of effort and energy to formulate the new Shanghai city center area. It has now been approved by the central government, and several main roads have already begun construction. The Sanmin-Wuquan Road that you are standing on is 60 meters wide and extends directly to the Huangpu River. This is one of the main roads. When the road is completed, construction of the Municipal Government buildings can begin. It is planned to hold the groundbreaking ceremony in July. The Municipal Government is the highest administrative organ in this city. In the future, all construction in the city center area where the new Municipal Government is located will depend on everyone's joint efforts. Therefore, the roadside trees that enhance the beauty of the city must also be created by everyone together. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Bureau Chief Pan's Speech: Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said, "Dr. Sun Yat-sen instructed us that all work during the period of political tutelage should rely on publicity. Both the Party Headquarters and the government should use publicity methods to make the people of the whole country aware of the importance of building a new China. Dr. Sun Yat-sen also instructed us that the method of publicity should be based on facts, not empty and superficial. Now, we are holding a tree planting ceremony here, and this place is also the city center area determined by the Municipal Government. Its significance is very important. The Municipal Government has, after a long period of consideration, decided to make this place the city center area for many reasons, as Mayor Zhang has just said. Now that various constructions have already begun, the Party Headquarters will, of course, based on the facts, assist the government in completing the construction of Greater Shanghai to meet the needs of all Shanghai citizens. The mayor just said that Sanmin-Wuquan Road is connected to the Huangpu River. If we can complete the construction of the Huangpu River bank, such as warehouses and wharves, on the one hand, and complete all the construction in the city center area on the other hand, within two or three years, we can conclude that the currently prosperous concessions will inevitably decline. At that time, we will not need to take back the concessions, and foreigners will naturally be willing to return them to us. We hope that everyone will work together. (Omitted below)"</p>
<p>Wang Yansong's Speech: Wang Yansong, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said briefly that in the past, we thought the Greater Shanghai plan was an ideal. Now, the city center roads have begun construction, and other projects are also in the planning stage, which shows that ideal is the mother of fact. We all know that the current concessions are full of dirt and filth, such as prostitution, gambling, and other things that all occur in the concessions, while the Chinese areas are not beneficial. It is even more important for us to work hard to build a new Shanghai.</p>
<p>Cai Wuji's Speech: Cai Wuji, Deputy Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, said that the expansion of the Northwest drought shows us the importance of afforestation. The government wants to hold a tree planting ceremony during the Qingming Festival. Its significance is not only to ask everyone to plant trees, but to know that planting trees is to cultivate them. It is especially important. President Liu Zhanen of Shanghai University and President Hu Shuhua of Tongji University successively gave speeches (details omitted).</p>
<p>Tree Planting Ceremony on Two Railways: The Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways jointly held the Sixth Anniversary Commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death and Tree Planting Ceremony at Xujiahui Station yesterday (the 12th) with more than 500 people from the Administration Bureau and affiliated district party headquarters, labor unions, and other groups.

<h3 id="e74">The Daji Steamer Caught Fire <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Disaster Occurred at Longjusha, with Many Passenger Casualties: Following the accident of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinchang Steamer, another accident occurred with the Dada Company's Daji Steamer. At 6:00 PM on the 11th, while traveling to Longjusha, Zhangheng Port, a sudden fire broke out. Many crew members and passengers died. A brief account was in yesterday's Jiangyin urgent telegram. Yesterday, a batch of rescued passengers were brought to Shanghai. The reporter went to the bureau to investigate and the information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai: The steamer was operating on the Tongyang route. It departed from Shanghai at 12:00 PM on the 10th, going upstream to Tongyang. The ship was loaded with more than 1,000 pieces of white sugar and groceries. There were more than 400 passengers on board. At 5:00 PM on the 11th, the ship passed Yaogang and Rengang and arrived at Tiansheng Port, where it docked to unload cargo. More than 200 Shanghai passengers disembarked, and another 60 newly recruited soldiers from the anti-smuggling camp disembarked to go to Yangzhou. After departing from Tiansheng Port, when the ship was on the Jiangmian of Longjusha, Zhangheng Port, it was about 6:00 PM. At that time, dinner was being served on the ship, and most of the passengers were eating in the main cabin. The ship was still moving when a very loud explosion suddenly occurred in the third-class cabin above the main cabin. The sound of the explosion shook several miles, and disaster struck.</p>
<p>Sulfur Caught Fire: According to the National News Agency, the cause of the accident was said by the personnel of the Customs survey ship "Zhuantiao" who went to the rescue at that time. When the Daji left Shanghai and sailed to Tongzhou, 40 new recruits recruited by a certain military agency disembarked to go to Yangzhou for training. At first, they were squatting in the cargo hold, joking and chatting. Soon, they took out cigarettes and smoked them, squatting on the left side of the stern cabin. The upper part of the cabin was covered with cloth, and the lower part was filled with 80 small boxes of sulfur and saltpeter. When the cigarettes were finished, the cigarette butts were dropped unconsciously. They smelled the sulfur smell and tried their best to save themselves, but it was impossible. Therefore, the fire started from there.</p>
<p>Passengers Jumping into the River: The National News Agency reported that 300-400 passengers on the same boat saw smoke sealing the ship and knew that disaster had occurred. They rushed to get out of the cabin, but the crew, fearing that it would be difficult to save the crowd, immediately drove the passengers to the deck. However, the passengers at the bottom of the cabin could not get out because the door was locked. In a short time, the smoke and flames were unbearable. The crew knew that it was difficult to put out the fire, so they opened the bottom cabin to help the passengers to the deck. However, most of the passengers were carrying their wives and children, and they were all ragged peddlers and farmers with no knowledge at all. Suddenly seeing the fire, they were at a loss and jumped into the river in a hurry. Some of them tried to use baskets to float on the water and avoid drowning, but there were too many people and the waves were too big. Those who jumped early were sunk by those who jumped later, and those who jumped later were dragged down by those who fell into the water earlier, so they all perished together. According to a refugee who was rescued, he did not jump into the water until the fire was close to him. At that time, he felt three or four people wriggling under his feet. I am afraid that none of these people have any hope of survival, it is really miserable.</p>
<p>Shipowner Asks for Help: After the tragedy, the shipowner was afraid</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>that the whole ship would sink, so he hurried to the river bank to carry out rescue work. Shipowner Wu Cailiang quickly launched rockets for help after the disaster occurred.</p>
<p>Rescue Situation: The National News Agency reported that when the Daji was on fire and the passengers gathered on the deck, the cries for help had reached the sky. The fishing boats did not dare to go to the rescue because it was getting dark and they were all collecting nets and arresting thieves, and they heard the cries for help. The special patrol boat dispatched by the Customs happened to be berthed near Xingang (about two Chinese miles from the scene of the accident). It heard the echoes of help and saw the smoke rising into the air. It immediately drummed its wheels and drove forward to the scene of the accident. Since it was difficult for the boat to get close, it changed to releasing four small boards to rescue people separately. As a result, about 200 people were rescued. Because most of the people were soaked in cold water, they were unconscious. They were immediately transferred to the special boat in turn and administered with stove fire and brandy, so that those who slowly recovered could be said to be completely alive. As for the seven people who were rescued but did not wake up, five men and two women, they also came to Shanghai on another boat yesterday, taking the Dahe and Longda boats. More than 70 people who returned to Shanghai were also rescued by special boats and transferred to Shanghai. Therefore, the special boat actually rescued about 200 people. Yesterday morning, the boat loaded with dead people and 123 living people arrived in Shanghai. The dead have been handed over to the rescue bureau for photography and coffin burial, and the living have been handed over to the company for aftermath.</p>
<p>Number of Deaths: The National News Agency reported that the number of passengers and crew members of the Daji who died in the fire and drowned in the water could not be confirmed. The Dada Company said that there were not many deaths, but according to the people who came from the special boat who carried out the rescue, the number of deaths was actually close to 100. Based on the number of people who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the shipowner Wu A'gen was missing and did not return. Only four of the 14 tea servants on the whole ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, which shows that there were not a few who suffered this catastrophe. A reporter from the National News Agency saw at the wharf that a Jiangbei passenger named Chen Minghai and his mother, wife, and two sisters, a total of five people, only Chen himself survived yesterday. The others were said to have jumped into the river and lost their whereabouts after being frozen. Later, according to the staff of the Dahe boat, the boat sailed to Zhanghuang Port and transferred the people rescued by the special boat to Shanghai. It was heard that ten corpses were salvaged on the shore.</p>
<p>Despicable Fishermen: The National News Agency reported that when the special boat arrived at the scene of the accident to carry out rescue, the fishing boats near the Daji did not save them when they saw them die, but instead grabbed the boxes and cages thrown into the water by the passengers to use as floating objects. The people on the special boat urged them to rescue them, but they did not move. As a result, they came out to force them and stated that anyone who grabbed property would be shot immediately. As a result, seven or eight fishing boats cooperated with two large fishing boats to rescue people separately, and dozens of people were rescued. It can be seen that the desire for profit makes people lose their minds, and they do not save people in danger. Despicable fishermen!</p>
<p>Company Aftermath: The National News Agency reported that the Dada Company received the alarm on the 11th night and immediately sent the Chuting boat from Shanghai to rush there. By noon yesterday, the families of the passengers who had not returned were almost looking forward to it. Therefore, the company again sent the Chuyuan boat with two towed boats, carrying coffins and cold-proof items to provide assistance and prepare to salvage the corpses. As for those who were rescued and arrived in Shanghai without relatives or relatives, the company prepared meals, accommodation, and tea yesterday and sent them to the company and the Chonghai Association to settle down. It is estimated that the Chuxiang and Chuyuan will return in the future to get a decisive solution. Those passengers who wanted to return to their hometown first were also given tickets by the company to take the boat first. The company's managers and others were discussing how to comfort the victims' families yesterday, and they could not make a decision for a while.</p>
<p>The Ship's Hull Was Not Damaged: The company received a follow-up telegram yesterday saying that the upper part of the Daji had been blown away, but the hull below the main cabin was still intact. Whether there was any loss of cargo in the cabins still needed to be investigated before it could be known. The ship is currently moored on the Jiangmian of Longjusha and Wu is assigned to guard it. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau also sent the Daqing boat and Zhang Shusheng to investigate. According to Zhang Junyu, the reporter said that according to the reports of the people who came, the engine in the Daji boat had not been destroyed. If the machinery was not damaged, it could still be towed to Shanghai for repair. How the internal parts were difficult to determine at the moment. It would have to wait until after the boat was inspected.</p>
<p>Shipowner Missing: After the accident, the shipowner Wu Caigen first sent a distress signal, but when the customs patrol ship arrived to rescue him, the crew members firmly asked the shipowner Wu to leave the ship and board the ship, but Wu absolutely refused to leave the ship, saying that it was the duty of the shipowner to be with the ship. At the moment, the shipowner Wu has been reported missing, and even the first and second mates are also missing.</p>
<p>Amount of Loss: The National News Agency reported that the loss of the whole Daji was said by the company yesterday that the cost of the ship was more than 200,000 taels, with a deadweight of more than 800 tons. It has been running on the Shanghai-Yangzhou route for nearly ten years. The sugar, cloth, and seafood carried this time were worth more than 100,000. It is not known whether the cargo and passengers were insured, but the company's Daji boat has not been insured for water and fire. Now the Daji is only left with the hull. Whether it will be repaired in the future will have to wait until people are sent to investigate. The total loss of personnel and property must be 500,000 or 600,000 in the future when everything is done.</p>
<p>History of the Ship: The National News Agency reported that the Daji boat was built by Ruirong Factory in 1925, with a weight of 800 tons and a value of more than 200,000 yuan. The loss of this accident is estimated to be more than 500,000 yuan, and the boat has not been insured. What is left now is only a hull, which is still moored in Longjusha near Zhanghuang Port. The company has sent important staff members Zhang Jun and Wang Jun to the scene of the accident on the Chuyuan towed boat last night to inspect and intends to tow the Daji boat back. As for the shipowner of the Daji boat, Wu Shicai (ie Wu A'gen), the cargo room Meng Dingyuan, and the comprador Xu Jingzhai have all fallen into the water and drowned.</p>
<p>Report to the Military Police: Yesterday, the company reported to the Shanghai Water and Land Public Security Bureau, saying that the company's Daji boat sailed upstream to Longjusha at 6:00 PM yesterday and suddenly had an accident. According to the crew members who escaped from the boat, they were having dinner at the time when they suddenly heard a noisy voice in the third-class cabin. They knew there was a fire and immediately stopped the boat to rescue it. Unfortunately, the fire was blazing in all directions, so the fire brigade tried their best to put out the fire but failed. Fortunately, a customs patrol boat happened to sail to the scene and heard the Daji's call for help and immediately tried to rescue it. It is estimated that 120 passengers and crew members were rescued, and then Dahe and first sailed to the scene and successively rescued 65 people. In addition, there were not a few who were rescued by sand boats and swam out. The number of casualties and the cause of the fire have not been found out. After receiving the letter, the company immediately sent the Chuyuan boat to the scene of the accident to carry out rescue matters. Details will be reported later. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Manager's Report: Yao Jinjian, the manager of the Yangzhou Dada Company who came to Shanghai on the boat, also jumped into the water when the Daji was completely burned, but was rescued by the lifeboat of the customs patrol boat. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday and made a written report to the Dada Company, saying that Yao Jinjian, 39 years old, from Yangzhou, contracted to handle the Yangzhou Dada Step Bureau's manager situation. Because he came to apply for a passenger, he took the Shanghai Daji boat from Dada Wharf at 2:00 AM on the 11th of this month, with about 200 passengers. At Tiansheng Port at 12:30, more than 100 passengers disembarked and more than 10 passengers embarked. There were 100 newly recruited soldiers. At 2:30, the boat sailed from Tiansheng Port to about ten miles from Xingang. At about 5:00, a fire broke out in the paper cargo under the front cabin. The cause was that the new soldiers who boarded at Tiansheng Port threw cigarette butts indiscriminately into the paper cargo cabin. Immediately, the siren sounded six times and the customs patrol boat rescued 119 people and drowned 7 people, 4 men and 1 woman, 1 boy and girl each. Then the Dahe boat came down to the water to rescue more than 100 people. At that time, they were brought back to Shanghai and completely loaded back to Jiangbei on the company's Daqing boat. It is true.</p>
<p>Sending a Boat to Replace: The company has agreed to temporarily send the Hanping boat to officially replace the Daji to operate the Tongchang route to avoid missing the schedule. Central Bank</p>

<h3 id="e76">Reasons for the Increase in Train Ticket Prices <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Effective on the 16th, Purely Affected by the Gold Standard: According to news from the Railway Bureau, one of the important issues discussed at the National Commercial Transportation Conference held by the Ministry of Railways was the freight rate. This issue was carefully studied and discussed by railway experts, commercial groups from various provinces and cities, and representatives from various institutions after collecting various materials. The final decision was that the railway should appropriately increase freight rates. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou letters will be implemented from the 16th of this month, and other routes will be handled successively. The increase in prices has been transferred by the Ministry of Railways to the Executive Yuan for approval. The content of the price increase is roughly a 20% increase in passenger ticket prices and a maximum 20% increase in freight rates, but there are some with lower percentage increases. The increase in railway prices this time is mainly due to the soaring gold prices and the high cost of materials. Even the freight rates of domestic and foreign shipping companies have recently increased by the same percentage. According to reports, the prices of various materials used by the railway have been increasing daily since last year. Among them, the increase of 30% to 50% is the most common, and the increase of rails and various steel products has even reached more than 60%. Therefore, it is estimated that even after the freight rate is increased by 20%, it will only slightly compensate for a portion of the operating costs. The various improvement expenses for the two routes still need to be planned separately. The freight rates of the two routes are still the lowest among the national routes, so the impact of cost losses is more significant than other routes. According to the basic number of ticket prices per kilometer for third-class passengers on various national routes, the Beijing-Hankou, Beijing-Suiyuan, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai routes are all 1.7 cents, Beijing-Ningbo is 1.5 cents, Jiaoji is 1.3 cents, and Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo are 1.2 cents. Compared with the Beijing-Hankou, Beijing-Suiyuan, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai routes, Beijing-Shanghai is 70% lower, 50% lower than Beijing-Ningbo, and 30% lower than Jiaoji. In terms of freight, taking the freight rate per ton per 50 kilometers of first-class goods in a whole train as an example, Tianjin-Pukou is 3.89 yuan, Jiaoji is 4.08 yuan, Beijing-Ningbo is 2.88 yuan, Beijing-Suiyuan is 3.9045 yuan, Beijing-Shanghai is 1.74 yuan, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo is 3.754 yuan. Comparing Beijing-Shanghai with various routes, Tianjin-Pukou is about 80% different, Jiaoji is 130%, Beijing-Ningbo is 60%, and Beijing-Suiyuan is 120%. Therefore, even after the increase of 20% in passenger and freight rates, it is still cheaper than other national routes. If the various routes increase their prices in the future, the difference will be even greater. The railway authorities believe that although the price increase this time is to compensate for a portion of the operating cost losses, the railway is a state-run enterprise and is different from ordinary commercial enterprises that purely aim to make profits. Therefore, for goods with already high daily freight rates or weak affordability, if the increase in freight rates is sufficient to hinder the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce and affect the people's living expenses, the percentage of the freight rate increase should still be appropriately reduced based on the actual situation in order to allow various freight rates to be adjusted fairly. In addition, the original transportation surcharge on the two routes is about 5% of the freight rate, which has recently been cancelled by the Ministry of Railways. Therefore, the price increase is 20% in name, but in reality, it is only about 15% higher than before, and the number of those whose increase is less than 20% is even smaller.

<h3 id="e77">To Rectify the Shanghai-Wusong Train <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Present it to the Municipal Government to request advice from the Railway Department to order the Railway Bureau to expedite the rectification of the Shanghai-Wusong Railway's steam-powered locomotives. In recent months, the train schedules have been frequently delayed, and passengers have complained. Tang Chengzong and Liu Ziwen, members of the Wusong District Municipal Committee, yesterday presented the facts to the Municipal Government, requesting that the Ministry of Railways be advised to order the Railway Bureau to expedite the rectification to maintain transportation. The petition is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Presenting to the Ministry of Railways to order the Railway Bureau to expedite the rectification of the Shanghai-Wusong Railway train service that does not follow the prescribed schedule, causing great suffering to the public. I humbly ask for your approval. I, the petitioner, investigated the Shanghai-Wusong Railway after the conversion to steam trains which was initially convenient, but gradually became lax, often failing to depart on time, and this has become increasingly serious recently, with delays of up to two or three hours at a time. The suffering of passengers waiting for the train and the crowding is difficult to describe. In addition, after 4:00 PM every day, when the railway factory is off work, there are often two or three hundred workers competing to get on the train, and passengers are left behind. This is usually tolerable, but for example, in mid-February, during the days of wind and snow, the strong and healthy pushed their way onto the train, while the elderly, weak, women, and children were unable to catch the train and suffered miserably, as the committee members witnessed personally. The railway is an unavoidable means of transportation for the people. If it is not rectified for a long time and the public is left to suffer, it will not only affect the reputation of the Railway Bureau but also greatly affect the development of various businesses of the citizens. Therefore, I am presenting the facts and humbly requesting that the Mayor advise the Ministry of Railways to order the Railway Bureau to expedite the rectification to relieve the unavoidable suffering of the public and to ensure the lasting reputation of the entire Railway Bureau.

<h3 id="e78">Preparatory Meeting to be Held Tonight <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The China Cotton Production Improvement Statistics Conference is scheduled to open at 2:00 PM on the 15th. Many proposals from various parties have been sent in succession, most of which belong to the overall plan for national cotton production improvement and are particularly detailed in their methods. The proposals from the initiators have not yet been fully prepared, as most are brought by representatives to the conference. In addition to the previously announced cotton fields, farms, and cotton industry institutions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Jiangxi, Anhui and Liaoning provinces have also joined the initiators. The annual increase in cotton production in Liaoning has attracted much attention from the Chinese people. Yesterday, Chen Jinghan, the representative sent by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines of Liaoning Province, also arrived in Shanghai. Representatives from Hunan, Hubei, and Zhejiang provinces will arrive in Shanghai today. Tonight, the preparatory committee consisting of Jiang Dixian, Yang Xiandong, Wu Weijing, and the representatives who have arrived will hold a preparatory meeting to discuss all the organization and preparations for the conference and to decide on the draft agenda of the conference. In addition, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines believes that this conference focuses on the discussion and lectures on improvement, which is enough to enhance the technology, and has ordered the cotton-growing counties in Jiangsu Province to send farm managers to Shanghai to attend the conference. The conference venue was originally planned to be in the small market of the Cloth Exchange at 80 Edward Road on the opening day, and the rest will be in the conference room of the Yarn Factory Association. Now, because the place is too narrow, it has been agreed with the Cloth Exchange that the small market will be used for the entire week. The conference venue is very spacious, and all circles in the cotton industry and related industries are welcome to attend. However, in order to maintain order at the conference, all those who wish to attend must arrive at the conference at 2:00 PM on the 15th for the opening ceremony, where badges will be issued. Afterwards, they must present the badges to enter the venue.</p>

<p>Time: 3 PM this afternoon</p>
<p>Location: Hongqiao Airport</p>
<p>The company has invited people from all walks of life to observe. The long-rumored test flight of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's two Junkers aircraft was officially confirmed only the day before yesterday. The company sent out special letters of invitation the night before last, saying roughly, "Our company's aircraft have arrived and been assembled.

<p>Workers at the Hengda Yarn Factory in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, went on strike in protest of the manager, Hu Shaoliang, beating a female worker. To prevent the strike from escalating, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs instructed the factory to suspend Hu Shaoliang's work until the strike was resolved. The Bureau convened a mediation meeting at 10 AM the day before yesterday (the 11th), and representatives from both labor and management arrived on time.

<h3 id="e83">Backlash Against Shanghai Public Security Team Arbitrary Detention for Cloth Clothing <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Requesting provincial and municipal authorities to investigate. Hengxing Cloth Factory in Yangjing Town, Pudong, recently sold 150 bales of cloth clothing to Yong'an Yarn Factory, which were loaded onto a boat around the 4th of this month at Wusong for delivery. On the afternoon of that day, Lu A'gen's boat, while sailing opposite the Meifu Oil Depot, was intercepted by detectives from the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Corps, who detained the people at Wusong and refused to release them. Hengxing, concerned about business, suffered considerable losses due to the arbitrary detention. It has reported to the Cotton Industry Association and telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Civil Affairs Director Hu Pu'an to release the people and goods, while Yong'an Factory, in urgent need of the goods, has reported to the Yarn Factory Association and telegraphed Mayor Zhang and Director Hu to release them. The text of the telegrams is recorded below: (1) To Director Hu Jun of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs: Presenting a case of detention of commercial goods with unclear circumstances, requesting investigation and resolution to reassure merchants and travelers. The association's motorized cotton ginning department member, Zhang Gusheng, manager of Hengxing Cloth Factory, reports selling 150 bales of machine-ginned cloth clothing to Yong'an Yarn Factory in Wusong. On the 4th of this month, Lu A'gen's boat was loaded for delivery to Yong'an Factory. After the boat departed, its whereabouts were unknown, and a search was conducted with no result. A report was made to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team for investigation, and the association was requested to provide assistance. After investigation by the association, it was learned that Lu A'gen's boat and goods had been seized by the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team but were actually detained by the Water Police Corps of the Fourth District of Jiangsu. It is unclear why the team arbitrarily detained commercial goods. The goods have been detained for many days, causing considerable losses. The factory has been operating for many years and has always been law-abiding. This forced detention appears to be an intentional attempt to extort money. If a thorough investigation is not conducted, how can the safety of commerce be ensured? In addition to reporting to the provincial government, the matter is urgent and requires clarification of the truth behind the detention. Therefore, we are sending a fast mail telegram requesting that you immediately order the Fourth District of Wusong to release Lu A'gen's boat and goods and investigate the matter thoroughly to reassure merchants and travelers. Respectfully, the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Industry Association. (2) To Shanghai Mayor Zhang and Jiangsu Civil Affairs Director Hu: Yong'an Yarn Factory, a member of the association, reports purchasing 150 bales of machine-ginned cloth clothing from Hengxing Cloth Factory in Yangjing Town, Pudong, which were arbitrarily detained on the 5th of this month by the Fourth District Detachment of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Corps at Zao浜. The reason is unknown. These goods are urgently needed, causing significant losses. The Detachment arbitrarily exceeded its authority in detaining commercial goods for a long time without announcing any reason or transferring them to judicial authorities for review. There is clearly something untrue about this. We respectfully request that you order the Detachment to release the detained cotton immediately and severely punish them to protect the people and uphold the law. Respectfully, the Chinese Yarn Factory Association.</p>

<p>Lawyer Wu Jingxiong generously appointed as representative of the bereaved families association. The case of the Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "New Kang" steamer, which sank on July 21, 1929, in the waters off Chengshanjiao, Shandong, after colliding with the Japanese Nissho Mail Steamship Company's "Ryuno Maru," has been repeatedly appealed by the bereaved families association to the National Government for negotiation. It has been nearly two years, and there is still no real solution. The families are crying out, running around, enduring hardship and suffering beyond description. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has already filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Special District Local Court. The court has summoned the Japanese shipping company once, but they have not complied. The outcome is still unpredictable. The Bereaved Families Association believes that the case's unresolved status is far from comforting the dead and appeasing the living. In addition to hiring Sheng Zhenwei as legal counsel, it has formally appointed Lawyer Wu Jingxiong as litigation agent yesterday. Lawyer Wu has profound legal knowledge and is respected both domestically and internationally. This case is expected to have new developments in the shortest possible time. The families are unanimously grateful for Lawyer Wu's generous appointment as legal counsel. Although the case is already in legal proceedings, the association believes that for the sake of an early resolution, it is still requesting the National Government to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government and demand compensation for the loss of life and property. At the same time, it is appealing to all national agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic groups to unite in resistance and assistance until the goal is achieved. It is said that the association will send representatives to Beijing within days for a third petition to the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Communications, and other agencies.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Residents of Tongxing Lane Oppose Demolition <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>It was heard yesterday that the representatives' assembly resolved on five measures. Requesting assistance from all sectors. The houses in the Tongxing Lane area on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession are being forced to relocate due to the landlord, the Deli 洋行, setting a deadline for reconstruction, causing fear among all the tenants. In addition to hiring lawyer Jin Yu to provide legal protection, the tenants held a general assembly of representatives at the Civil Branch Association on that road at 5 PM yesterday to seek the unity of all tenants. Those present included dozens of people from Jianzhihao, Yuantai Zhan, Guangchang Oil Shop, Zhenhe Hotel, Risheng Zhan, Yuanji Brick and Ash Shop, Anyu Zhan, Changfa Zhan, Shengyang Company, Tongxing Zhan, Yuantai Coal Shop, Tongfu Paper Shop, Gongli Thread Factory, Zhu Baoquan, and others. Wu Jinchang was elected chairman. After performing the ritual, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the houses in this lane were built only sixteen years ago, the structures are solid, and the style is new. There is no need for reconstruction. Since receiving the landlord's notice to move out by the end of January, the representatives have repeatedly consulted with the landlord without success. However, the neighboring Dehe Lane, which is also the same property of the 洋行 with the same method, has been preserved from demolition due to the tenants' request. Why are the tenants in this lane being treated differently? Now that the landlord does not allow the tenants' request, disputes are inevitable. The tenants must make adequate preparations to discuss fundamental remedies. Next, the following cases were discussed: (1) In order to consolidate unity, it was decided to organize a tenants' union. (2) The tenants will not move out under any pressure. (3) Fearing that the landlord will file a lawsuit, it was decided to hire the two great lawyers Jin Yu and Tao Yimin for protection. (4) The unreasonable treatment of the landlord will be reported to the Party and government agencies and social organizations for help. (5) Request the French Concession Real Estate Association to send personnel to instruct on all proceedings. All five of the above items were approved and adopted. Four representatives were appointed to request assistance from all parties, and Lu Dechang was added as a representative to handle all internal and external procedures. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Major Fire in Pudong <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>More than twenty houses burned to the ground. Ma A'hua suffered burns all over his body but survived. At 12:20 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at Tongsentai Tobacco and Paper Shop, No. 282, Middle Market, Lanmudu, Pudong. Flames soared into the sky, spreading to more than twenty shops on the left, right, and opposite sides of the street. It was not extinguished until about 3 PM. The following are the detailed findings of the investigation:</p>
<p>The fire started from a frying pan. Tongsentai Tobacco and Paper Shop faces east and has been in business for over thirty years. It is a well-funded, leading shop in Pudong. Last year, it rebuilt its premises and reopened in the new four-bay storefront at the original site on December 20 of the lunar calendar. The northernmost bay of the shop was dedicated to making candles, with several frying pans set up. Yesterday at noon, the shop's old steward and other staff were having lunch. Suddenly, the fire burning under the frying pan flared up because no one was watching it. The oil in the pan caught fire and quickly spread to the nearby oil candles. The shop's old candle-making steward, Ma A'hua, saw the fire in the candle room and immediately went inside, intending to put out the fire. However, it was too late, and he was burned all over his body. He was rescued on the spot and managed to save his life.</p>
<p>Water source cut off due to the filling of the canal. The shop's goods were mainly kerosene, soap, matches, paper, and firecrackers, which fueled the fire, causing it to burn more fiercely. In an instant, the fire burst through the roof. With the strong southwest wind, the fire spread to the northeast. When the Pudong Fire Brigade heard the alarm, they drove to the scene. However, because the nearby small canal had been filled in the previous year, the site was far from the Huangpu River, making it difficult to reach. The fire spread to the neighboring shops on the left and right and then to the opposite side of the street. Thick smoke and flames soared into the sky, making it impossible to control. Later, after learning of the fire, fire brigades from various districts in southern Shanghai also dispatched several fire engines and crossed the river by barge to the scene. They connected long hoses to the Huangpu River to pump water to extinguish the fire. At the same time, fire boats from the Customs and the Public Concession also sailed to the Bund and parked, using long hoses to spray water toward the fire. The fire gradually subsided until 3 PM. The inside of the fire was still smoldering, and it was not extinguished until the evening.</p>
<p>Fire burned left, right, and across the street. In addition to the total destruction of the shop, a total of more than twenty neighboring shops on the left, right, and opposite sides of the street were burned. They are listed below: two buildings of Changqing Sauce Garden, one building of Deyu Guan Dim Sum Shop, one building of Zhenchangxiang Shoe Shop, one building of Bantianlu Tea and Food Shop, two buildings of Yufengtai Foreign Goods Shop, one building of Bingxingyuan Water Heater Shop, one building of Deshunzhai Paper Shop, two buildings of Xin Jing Heping Meat Shop, one building of Gongxing Fried Goods Shop, one building of Xielongtai New Clothing Shop, one building of Shishunxing Tofu Shop, one building of Zhangdingtai Barrel Shop, one building of Hongxing Tea Garden, one building of a certain Bamboo Shop, one building of Beihua Shop, one building of Xushunxing Lead Shop, one building of Shunxing Mutton Shop, one building of Zhangshunxing Barrel Shop. Dafeng Clothing Store had its roof burned off, and all goods were water damaged. A total of more than twenty buildings were destroyed.</p>
<p>District Chief Zhang ordered the shop assistants to be detained. Few of the burned shops had fire insurance. Tongsentai, where the fire started, had insurance of over 6,500 taels, which was a relatively small amount. The total loss of buildings is estimated at over 100,000 yuan, and the loss of goods is also in this amount. Afterwards, the representatives were ordered to interrogate the shop assistants to investigate the cause of the fire. Ma A'hua, the old steward of the shop who was burned in the fire, was discharged from the hospital after treatment. It is said that his injuries were minor and he is not in life-threatening danger. Foreign candidate for the Public Concession Board of Directors.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Four People Express Their Political Views <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Britons Macnaghten and Hughes, Americans Raven and Carney. All generally advocate buying the Dahua. Yesterday, four foreign candidates for the Public Concession Board of Directors of the Shanghai Public Concession, Britons Macnaghten and Hughes, and Americans Raven and Carney, expressed their views to Western reporters. Their statements are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Macnaghten: Major General Macnaghten is the current General. His stated political views are roughly as follows: Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Public Concession Board has been eager to fully cooperate with it to develop this great commercial port in the East. However, I believe that the best cooperation is to allow the Concession authorities to exercise their functions as freely as possible within the scope of municipal administration. When the new Board takes office, Judge Feetham's investigation report should also be completed. Therefore, the next Board of Directors has a heavy responsibility and will cast the fate of the Concession's future based on its experience and judgment. As for the thorny issue of the extra-settlement roads, the Public Concession Board has done everything possible in the past year to seek its early resolution and maintain the status quo before it is resolved. It is hoped that both parties will dispel misunderstandings and reach a satisfactory solution as soon as possible. Last year, the Public Concession Board paid special attention to the development of the education system and the establishment of hospital committees and parks in densely populated areas. The Chinese government has now formulated a factory law and ordered the Public Concession Board to cooperate with the government to improve labor conditions in a feasible manner. However, this cooperation must be carefully considered to ensure its proper development. Therefore, the question for the next Board of Directors is to seek the progress of municipal administration and the prosperity of the local area in harmony and to maintain the inherent reputation and uphold the necessary municipal powers in the exercise of its functions in accordance with established principles.</p>
<p>Raven and Carney: Raven and Carney, both publicly recommended by the American community as candidates for the Board of Directors, do not support the sale of the Public Concession Board's existing sites. However, regarding the acquisition of the Dahua Hotel property, Raven argues that it is appropriate to seize the opportunity to buy it while the land price is increasing daily. The future use can be discussed at leisure after the acquisition. In addition, the population in the eastern and northern districts is tending to become more dense, and park sites should be acquired as soon as possible. Carney argues that the Dahua Hotel issue should be discussed jointly with the issue of increasing parks within the Concession. Taxpayers should first be asked whether they are willing to spend tens of millions of taels to increase parks. If they express their support, then the location issue should be discussed. Currently, the Chinese residents' side is about to express its views, so when it is submitted to the Western taxpayers' meeting in the future, opinions from all parties can be gathered. In addition, Carney also stated that there is an urgent need to facilitate transportation, expand education, and the old Board of Directors has already paid attention to this. It is expected that progress will be made in these two areas this year.</p>
<p>Hughes' Declaration: Mr. Hughes has drafted a long declaration and submitted it to the North China Daily News for publication. It roughly states that the number of directors limited by the Yangjingbang Regulations is too small, and the time available to each director is limited. They can only serve on one committee and should not hold multiple committee positions. The remedy is to hope that taxpayers will nominate more candidates for the Board of Directors and appoint the unsuccessful candidates, according to the number of votes, as members of various group committees to assist the directors' shortcomings. One is to develop the committee system and promote the principle of decentralized management, so that the Board of Directors only becomes a formal approval mechanism, and a monthly meeting is sufficient. If so, representatives of the press can also be allowed to attend and listen. Regarding the issue of municipal openness, it is advocated that a publication committee be formed by one person from the Board of Directors, one person from the General Office, and one or two press representatives, as proposed by the North China Daily News editorial. Currently, Chinese residents and Japanese residents each have a taxpayer association. Unfortunately, the Western community lacks a body to discuss municipal affairs. Before deciding on very important issues, the Public Concession Board may invite taxpayers and representatives of the Chinese taxpayer association to hold informal meetings to solicit opinions. In addition, he strongly supports the proposal to acquire the Dahua property. Hughes does not support the Public Concession Board's actions regarding the closure of the dog racing track. He says that gambling habits have existed for a long time, and it is especially difficult to ban gambling on various games and sports. If you want to ban it, you must use force, which is to forcibly deprive a large part of the people of their legitimate entertainment. I also know deeply the harm of gambling and am willing to eradicate it. The best way to do this is for the authorities to supervise and set rules to make them comply. It seems better to do so than to ban it completely. Hughes advocates less talk on the issue of road construction outside the settlement. The Chinese authorities have used their ingenuity to take advantage of the weak resistance of foreigners to achieve their goals. Now, it is hoped that both parties will reach an agreement to protect the interests of the Chinese and foreign districts and residents within the area concerned. If the Chinese side can guarantee the same conditions as the Concession in terms of land rental, public convenience, and donation of taxes, then it can also accept its superior governance.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Power and Water Cut Off in Zhabei <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Caused by damage to the central machine.</p>
<p>Lasted about two hours.</p>
<p>The lights and tap water in the Zhabei district suddenly went out around 6:15 PM last night, causing panic among general residents. Shops on important roads such as Baoshan Road, Datong Road, and Hengfeng Road closed early. The public security bureaus in the fourth and fifth districts were deeply concerned that petty thieves would take the opportunity to cause trouble and disturb public order. They dispatched armed police officers to strictly guard against this. According to the water and electricity company, the cause of the water and electricity outage was damage to the central machine at the Wusong factory. The factory engineer immediately repaired it, and it was successfully restored to light around 7:20 PM. However, it soon relapsed and returned to darkness until it was completely repaired and restored to normal water and electricity supply around 8:10 PM. When the lights went out, a robbery occurred at Yan Xie Feng Shop on Datong Road, and the shop owner was shot.</p>

<h3 id="e89">A Woman Strangled to Death <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>False report of suicide to request exemption from autopsy.</p>
<p>The inside story has not yet been clarified.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office received a report yesterday afternoon from Shao Meisheng, a land agent from the 20th map district, stating that a female resident, Xu Lu, had committed suicide in a flat at No. 841, opposite the Minli School on Zhonghua Road, and requesting an autopsy. Xu Shunlu, the deceased's nephew, also submitted a statement requesting exemption from the autopsy. Prosecutor Wu Shixin briefly questioned him, and finding the situation suspicious, ordered that the request not be granted. He ordered the land agent to wait at the scene of the body, awaiting the autopsy. At 3 PM, Prosecutor Wu, accompanied by examiner Shen Xiqing, went to the scene of the autopsy (the house where the deceased lived was only one room, with the front half as a living room and the back half as a bedroom). When the judge arrived at the scene of the body, which was still lying on the bed in the bedroom, Prosecutor Wu stepped forward to examine it. He saw that the deceased, Xu Lu, was lying supine on the bed covered with a cotton quilt. Examiner Shen lifted the cotton quilt and found that the deceased was wearing a striped velvet jacket and white flannel trousers, with black socks on her feet, and the trouser legs tucked into the socks. The trouser belt was still tightly fastened around her waist, and the buttons on her jacket were also quite neat. However, there was a white cotton rope around her neck. After untying and examining it, it was determined that it was not a suicide but that she had been strangled to death before her death. After personally inspecting the scene, Prosecutor Wu found the circumstances suspicious and examined the bedroom all around. He saw two glass windows behind the side of the bed (each window was three pieces of glass). The glass window on the west side was missing a piece of glass at the bottom, and a pile of broken glass was found outside the window. Upon picking it up, it was found that the broken glass was covered with white paper, but the paste was still unusually damp, and the window lock had also been damaged. The judge concluded that the murderer had entered through the back window. Fearing the sound when breaking the glass, he first pasted extremely thick paste on the window and then broke the glass. The judge then ordered the broken glass to be taken back to the court and questioned the deceased's daughter. The daughter, named A'da, ten years old, testified that "I and my younger brother (A'er, eight years old) went to sleep first last night. This morning, a neighbor woke me up, and my mother was already dead." Prosecutor Wu also found three leather suitcases in the living room (two red and one white) and questioned A'da, who said that the suitcases were all placed in the bedroom and did not know how they were moved outside. They were usually locked. The judge obtained a confession and ordered that they be opened one by one. The suitcases were all filled with old clothes, and the lock on one of the suitcases had been pried open. Prosecutor Wu then questioned the deceased's nephew, Xu Shunlu, and reprimanded him for falsely reporting a suicide case involving a major murder, and ordered the deceased's nephew and the land agent to come to the court tomorrow (today) for instructions. Prosecutor Wu also made a detour to the back to inspect the scene before returning to the court by car. The strangulation cord was taken back to the archives by examiner Shen for storage. It is reported that the deceased's husband, Xu Chunhua, ran Xu Chunji's woodworking business in the past, which was quite successful and had some savings. Xu was originally from Zhangjiang Peng, Pudong. He died of illness on September 16 of last year, leaving behind one wife and one concubine. His wife still lives in Zhangjiang Peng, with two daughters who are said to have married. The concubine, Xu Lu, the deceased, was thirty-five years old this year and had two children, a daughter named A'da, ten years old, and a son named A'er, eight years old. Xu Lu was the daughter of Lu Ruixian (Lu used to be a partner at Qiao Zhishan's land agency in the 16th pier and is now eighty years old). When the judge performed the autopsy yesterday, Lu Ruixian still said that my daughter died of a sudden illness. According to neighbors, this morning, because they saw that the deceased's door was wide open and her suitcases and clothes were scattered all over the floor, they suspected that there was a theft, but they did not expect such a tragedy to occur.</p>
<p>Taxpayer Association's Letter Requesting</p>
<h3 id="e90">Strict Closure of Dog Racing Track <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Members or Gamblers? The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Board yesterday, stating: "We, representing more than 95% of the Chinese taxpayers within the Concession, have actively opposed the dog gambling track since it appeared in the Concession. Fortunately, although Your Board has delayed for a long time, it has been able to remedy the situation and decided to close both major dog racing tracks on the 31st of this month to maintain the interests of the residents and to show Your Board's hatred of evil and to fulfill its duties. However, we have recently seen reports that the dog gambling track will continue to run dog races, but gamblers will be limited to members. This move is extremely dangerous, because the purpose of dog racing is only to profit from gambling. Therefore, any gambler who enters the track can simply register for free on the membership roster in the gambling track before or temporarily to act as a member, and the park can still hire touts outside to solicit members, which is actually attracting gamblers. The harm of this is too great to be described. We are sending this letter to request that Your Board pay special attention to strictly enforcing the closure order to cut off the source of the disaster and maintain its prestige and strict fulfillment of its duties. This is addressed to the Public Concession Board."</p>

<h3 id="e93">Settlement of Rental Dispute in Sanli <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Thanks to the mediation of Mr. Wang Yiting and Mr. Du Yuesheng, the property of the Shanghai Charity Group Tongren Fuyuan Hall, located in Sanli, along the Xixinqiao Street, Dongxi Zilaihuo Street, and Dexing Zhizhong Lixian Streets in the French Concession, was completed last winter. After the tenants moved in, they formed a joint association due to the high rent, and elected representatives to request rent reductions and refunds of charity donations from the landlord. They also submitted requests for relief to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau. Subsequently, the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to mediate, and the landlord convened a board meeting, resolving to uniformly reduce the original rent by 20%, collecting at 80% of the original amount, and notified the tenants. The tenants were still not satisfied, requesting a reduction to 70%. Both sides were in disagreement, and the matter remained unresolved. Mr. Wang Yiting, director of the Charity Group, and Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chinese director of the French Concession, stepped in to mediate, convening both parties to discuss a compromise. A compromise was reached to uniformly collect at 75% of the original amount, and other requests were waived. The tenants expressed satisfaction and agreed to abide by the mediators' intentions, immediately paying the rent. Those without leases also proceeded to enter into them. A rental reduction dispute was resolved with a single word from Mr. Wang and Mr. Du, and both parties expressed gratitude. However, the landlord side took out loans to build the houses, and the rent collected, after repaying the loans, was entirely allocated to charitable purposes, with a fixed budget. Now, with a 25% rent reduction, the estimated income for the year is reduced by approximately 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>In the French Concession, civil offenders in the Mixed Court have traditionally been detained in the detention center of the French General Police Department, and then transported to the court for trial.

<p>Separate filings in the Special District Court and the French Municipal Council. Shareholders and directors are all defendants. Since the death of Huang Chu Jiu, creditors have been filing claims for repayment, and no solution has been reached for two months. It is now known that the four Shanghai lawyers hired by the Municipal Government, Wu Jingxiong, Chen Tingrui, Qin Liankui, and Jiang Yiping, have transferred the registered creditor rights and the Labour Road creditor group committee to the creditor reorganization, and have formally represented these creditors in filing a lawsuit with the Special District Court, accusing all shareholders and directors of the Gongfa Company and Huang Chu Jiu's sons, Xianzhong and Xinyao, of bearing unlimited liability and clearing the debts in the shortest possible time. The complaint was submitted to the French Municipal Council the day before yesterday (the 11th). Some creditors have already filed lawsuits, so another complaint was filed separately, requesting to receive repayment along with general creditors. The original complaint is recorded as follows: For the matter of requesting a judgment for repayment: We, the complainants, are creditors of the defendants and are seeking to recover funds owed by the defendant's Riye Bank (head office and branches) and the Dashijie Amusement Savings Department, totaling 25,813 taels, 8 mace, 3 candareens, and 9 cash, and 1,103,119 yuan, 1 dime, 4 cents, and 7 li. The defendant's Riye Bank and Dashijie Amusement Savings Department have completely ceased payments. It has been found that Gongfa Company is not a limited liability company and has been managed by shareholder Huang Chu Jiu. Huang Chu Jiu has now died, and his heirs are naturally responsible. The plaintiffs do not know the list of directors and shareholders of the company, but it is heard that all these lists are currently held by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. It is requested that your court investigate and clarify the matter with the bureau, and then list each shareholder and director separately as defendants in this case, and then supplement and correct the complaint. We now file a lawsuit according to law, requesting that the defendants be held jointly and severally liable for clearing and repaying the amount pursued by the plaintiffs, totaling 25,813 taels, 8 mace, 3 candareens, and 9 cash, and 1,103,119 yuan, 1 dime, 4 cents, and 7 li, and be made to bear the litigation costs.</p>

<p>Representative Lin Wenyuan Company, Lao Jinlong Co., Ltd., on the evening of the 11th of this month, on behalf of Lin Wenyuan Company, hosted a banquet for the Western medicine community in this city at Hongyun Restaurant. No fewer than 150 guests were present and enjoyed themselves. Mr. Dice Peck, head of Western music and makeup, gave a speech, translated by Chinese manager Zhou Zhenfu. He briefly stated that the American Lin Wenyuan cologne, managed by the company, has been relying on the efforts of various pharmacies to promote it to customers for nearly 60 years, and customers have been happy to purchase it. To this day, it has become a popular product throughout the country. The price of quinine has risen three times compared to last year, but the price of Lin Wenyuan cologne has only increased by 20%. The reason for this is to make it easier for the Western medicine community to promote the product and at the same time to repay the patronage of customers over the years. For this reason, they do not hesitate to make great sacrifices. Then, Mr. Di and Mr. Zhou diligently toasted and presented the guests with Lin Wenyuan cologne and calendar posters, and everyone dispersed with joy.</p>

<p>Senior High Normal Department</p>
<p>Adding Scout Training Interest</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the Zhejiang Education Department's presentation of a letter from the Provincial Training Department, requesting to order all senior high normal departments to add scout training, etc., submitted the case for approval. The Ministry of Education instructed, "We have received the presentation. The organization of scouts is not limited to schools, and its curriculum and work are not school assignments. The age of entry is stipulated as twelve to eighteen years old, which is generally students below junior high school. Therefore, scout training is currently implemented in junior high schools, but no credits are given. It is said that due to the lack of scout training personnel, it is proposed to add scout courses and training methods in senior high normal departments. This is feasible. Senior high normal departments of each school should include scout training as an elective course for students who wish to study it. This elective course is to cultivate scout training personnel. Its nature is a vocational subject for normal school students and is different in purpose from the general training of junior high scouts. No credits should be given in junior high school. Here, it should be the same as general elective subjects and credits should be calculated accordingly. Please note."</p>

<p>Jinan University: National Jinan University held a memorial ceremony for the sixth anniversary of the Premier's death at 9:25 AM yesterday in the Zhiyuan Hall of the school. The flag was raised at 9:20 AM (because the Premier died at this moment, the school has always held the memorial ceremony for the Premier's death at 9:25 AM as a rule). The Western band played mourning music and entered the hall to perform the ceremony as required. Representatives of the female student association presented flowers. Principal Zheng chaired the meeting, and Yang Yufen and Li Bangdong recorded the proceedings, with Shen Yu as the master of ceremonies. Hundreds of teachers and students attended. Principal Zheng gave a speech on the significance of the commemoration and elaborated on the Premier's will and the efforts that overseas Chinese children should make in the revolutionary position. After the ceremony, trees were planted in different areas around the school. The school's public school also gathered for a photo.</p>
<p>Shanghai University: Shanghai University held a tree-planting ceremony at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Then, a general meeting of all teachers and students was convened in the auditorium to commemorate the anniversary of the Premier's death. The ceremony was performed as required, with Zhong Liangfang as the master of ceremonies. Next, Principal Liu explained the Premier's spirit of hard work and service and urged the students to take him as an example. Then, he introduced Mr. Pan Gongzhan, director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, who gave a speech, saying that the Premier's various excellent spirits of hard work, service, and dedication should be embraced and not forgotten by everyone. However, everyone must know how to learn the Premier's hard work, service, and dedication, which are entirely built on profound knowledge. With profound knowledge, one can work hard, serve, and dedicate oneself. Otherwise, without preparation, it is just empty words. Revolution means fulfilling one's duties, and its greatest purpose is to focus on construction. China today lacks talent and is not enough to meet the needs of construction. Everyone has this happiness and this opportunity, and the greatest responsibility is to seek profound knowledge to prepare for future service and dedication in society. The social world and knowledge are constantly changing and evolving with the times. Young people must know this during their studies. The Premier never left books at any time in his life. He worked so hard and was so studious. Therefore, we should supplement our knowledge and not forget to read during our work, and we should study hard to gain profound knowledge during our studies. This is everyone's greatest responsibility today, and one's career is based on this. His words were inspiring and thought-provoking. After he finished, the principal stood up to thank him and sang "Beautiful China" and dismissed the meeting.</p>
<p>Wusong Famous Schools: Yesterday was the Premier's sixth anniversary. All military and police agencies and schools and factories in Wusong suspended offices, classes, and work for the day to express their mourning. Banquets and entertainment were also suspended. Tree-planting ceremonies were held in various schools and agencies in the morning to commemorate the event. The entire executive committee of the Eighth District Party Department led the members to Tongji Road.

Wusong Elementary School held it on the school playground, and the Republic Women's School held it on Beishihe Road. The crowd of onlookers was crowded, and the teachers and students were also very enthusiastic due to the clear weather.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Manifestation of the Popularization of Sports in Japan <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Students Are the Center, Middle School Students Are the Most Numerous</p>
<p>Monks and Cooks Also Join</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: In recent years, the progress of sports in Japan has been rapid, achieving new records daily, sufficient to compete with various countries around the world. The popularization of sports is also far beyond what our country can hope for. According to a recent survey by the Japan Association of Athletics Federations on the occupations of athletes attending various national competitions over the years, the results are as follows:</p>
<p>Total of men and women: Students above middle school: 94,629,975; Middle school students: 102,049,215,12; Company employees: 3,531,354; Government officials: 4,140,414; Commerce: 2,100,210; Industry: 26026; Agriculture: 1,360,136; Reclamation workers: 10010; Teachers: 1761177; Land developers: 202; Pharmacists: 101; Soldiers: 303; Youth group members: 24024; Clubs: 31132; Fishing industry: 303; Sailors: 101; Cooks: 505; Miscellaneous workers: 606; Housewives: 303; Monks: 202; Doctors: 101; University graduates: 14,216; Unemployed: 42,143; Unknown: 44,145; Total: 237,352,839,01.  Looking at the table above, it can be seen that although sports are widespread in Japan, students still account for the majority. This is because the promotion of physical education initially focused on schools, and the ideal level of popularization has not yet been reached. Among them, athletes who are employed in industry and commerce are mostly marathon long-distance running athletes, as this type of sport does not require any equipment, and the time and costs are very economical, so it does not interfere with their occupation.</p>

The New School Building of Chih Tze College Holds Groundbreaking Ceremony. The result of the bidding for the construction of the new school building of Chih Tze College in this city was contracted by Wu Hai Kee. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on the 9th. At 10 a.m. that morning, the school president, Mr. He Shi-zhen, along with faculty and staff, went to the new school site on Shui Dian Road, Zhabei, to perform the ceremony. About 600 students went to participate. At that time, it was raining and snowing, and the roads were muddy, but those who went to observe the ceremony were still in high spirits. The groundbreaking ceremony was very grand. The sound of firecrackers was loud. Principal He held a hoe and broke the ground, digging a hole. When he put down the hoe, he was already sweating and panting. Amidst the applause, he announced the completion of the ceremony. Afterwards, Mr. He led those who participated in the ceremony to walk around the school site for a week before dispersing. It is said that the new building will be completed in May of this year, and all the students will be able to move in by the autumn semester.</p>

<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>▲ In reality, a perfect lover is not necessarily an ideal spouse. However, in novels and in women's minds, the two are often confused.</p>
<p>▲ When in love, women observe the men on the other side through rose-colored glasses. However, after marriage, the rose-colored glasses will naturally be removed, so the enthusiasm of both men and women will inevitably be affected a little.</p>
<p>▲ Marriage is a microscope. From it, we can see the true feelings of the other party.</p>
<p>▲ A pair of comfortable shoes, a comfortable soul, and a comfortable love can keep a woman young and extend her life of enjoyment.</p>
<p>▲ To test the true love of a modern woman is not whether she is willing to pray and repent before God for the man on the other side before marriage, but whether she is willing to share poverty with him after marriage.</p>
<p>▲ Generally, modern women hope that every man is as rich as the oil magnate and as good at spending money as the stars in Hollywood.</p>
<p>▲ In hundreds of years, love will no longer be an uncertain thing, marriage will no longer be a coincidence, and divorce will no longer be an inevitability.</p>
<p>▲ The beauty of men lies in their ability to focus on handling their own affairs, and the weakness of women lies in their inability to let go of other people's affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e125">An Explanation of "The Spirit Never Dies" <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the passing of the Premier, and all of our people commemorated it. The reason for expressing respect and not forgetting is to use the four characters "The Spirit Never Dies" as a slogan. It means that although the Premier's physical body has died, his revolutionary ideology and everything else have not died.</p>
<p>In this world, those who breathe, live, and rest, no matter what kind, their longest lifespan is only a few years. From the external point of view, it is called the physical body, and from the internal point of view, it is called the soul. Which is more important? Scholars value their soul and preserve it. This is what our country's historian Sima Qian called the word "death," which has a definition. One is heavier than Mount Tai, and the other is lighter than a feather. Differentiating it carefully and proving it with modern physicists' theory of the indestructibility of matter, it is said that "those who are born and gather here must gather there again after death, and the components and volume will not be reduced." According to this result, death only occupies a fraction of a second, and the reason for being born is an immortal thing that exists forever in the universe. For example, Confucius, Sakyamuni, and Jesus in the world, there is no one who cannot point out their names and admire their people. Their voices and appearances are as if they are living in the present psychology and leaving a deep image, which is a definite proof of immortality. Then there is Hidetsugu, who reverses Spencer and Darwin's theory and argues that "death is a state of human evolution." His claim is also optimistic about the future and regards the present as a fleeting shadow. From this, death is not sad, and why is life happy? And in life, there is a way to die, and in death, there is a good state of immortality. Alas, this can really break through the outlook on life. If the Japanese scholar Oshio Heihachiro scolds the heroic deeds of heroes and elites and calls them "meetings in a dream," then surpassing our country's Taoism and reaching the Western Buddhism cannot be taken as a model.</p>
<p>It has been six weeks since the Premier's death. His body is no longer visible, but his spirit is now as long as the heavens and the earth and shines as brightly as the sun and the moon. People only know that he used revolution as his career, but they do not know that he can put life and death aside. Therefore, even the day of his death is like the year of his birth. Therefore, I wrote this explanation.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The World's Oldest Man <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Zhai</p>
<p>The world's oldest man is Turkey's Luo Hai, who was born in Pittoresk City in 1774 and is now 156 years old. His skin is dark and his hair is bald, but he is as energetic as someone in their forties. He gets up at 5:30 every morning and practices gymnastics with spring machinery. Then he eats oatmeal porridge for breakfast. He himself said that he has not tasted meat for 50 years. For lunch, he only eats bread, milk, beans, and vegetables. When he was young, he served in the military and served as a cavalry officer. He once fought with Napoleon's invading army in 1810. From childhood to the present, he has witnessed his motherland changing its owner twelve times. He has collected the history of the Near East countries for 150 years in his chest. He has remarried eleven times in his life. He even had a son when he was one year old. Luo Hai's parents, children, and grandchildren are all long-lived. His eldest son died at the age of 101. According to research by physiologists, his innate inheritance is beyond the ordinary, and his lifestyle is well-regulated and his food is rich in nutrition. It is also possible for him to enjoy a long life.</p>
<h3 id="e127">International Women's Movement Commemoration <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Ji-Ping</p>
<p>On the International Women's Movement Memorial Day, the Shanghai Women's Association held a grand memorial meeting. The Women's Youth Ambition Society held a meeting at Fudan Zibin College and invited celebrities to give speeches. I went to listen to the speech with my classmates from Xiamen University, Cai Chun-Qiu and Mrs. Chen Xue-Yi. Ms. Cai is a talented student from the Yenching Research Institute and has in-depth research on the women's movement. She hopes to get a glimpse of the degree of self-consciousness and awareness of the women's circles in Shanghai, so she has high hopes for this trip. When the car arrived in front of the college, the meeting place was already crowded with men and women, with almost no space. The Jinnan Boy Scouts maintained order, and the Fudan female students were responsible for the reception. Although it was crowded, it was orderly. Nearly a thousand listeners, men also accounted for half of them. The walls of the college were full of beautiful pictures and slogans. The work of the students of the Meizhuan was very pleasing to the eye. After the ceremony was performed, the chairman, Ms. Luo Jun, announced the meaning of the commemoration, and then the speeches began.</p>
<p>There were as many as eight speakers in succession, lasting three hours. More than a thousand people craned their necks and listened, maintaining a quiet attitude from beginning to end, which can be said to be commendable. The speeches contained a lot of stimulating content, so-called "tracing the past and encouraging those who come after." Therefore, I recorded what I remembered to prepare for a case. Ms. Guo Zhen-Yi said that women should be free people with thoughts, ideas, rights, and abilities. If women want to obtain the freedom and equality that human beings should have, they can never get it by relying on empty fantasies, and they cannot achieve it by using emotions. They must use their own will and work together to achieve economic, educational, political, legal, and moral equality. Ms. Liu Wang Li-Ming spoke in extremely fluent Mandarin, with a calm attitude, clear and detailed analysis, and profound meaning. She is worthy of being a pioneer in the women's world. She said that today's commemoration is just a memorial service. She was talking about the disorganization and silence of the women's world in our country. There is no organizational ability and little self-awareness. She said that she was overwhelmed with sorrow. She also said that there are very few women who are self-aware in China. I don't know how many millions of women are living in a dark hell. Generally, women who claim to be liberated are drunk and dreaming of death. They only know how to enjoy themselves and ignore the interests of others. Therefore, the current women's world should have a whole organization to go to the people to work. Mr. Pan Gong-Zhan won the full seat with his solemn and serious tone. Mr. Pan advocated that women should do constructive work. The content of the women's movement is based on Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's The Doctrine of Nation-Building, which is divided into three parts, namely, the psychological construction of the women's movement, the material construction of the women's movement, and the social construction of the women's movement. The most touching thing is that women should first do the movement of people, enjoy the rights of people, and obtain the qualifications of the people, and then do the movement of Chinese female citizens. If modern women do not have a complete personality, how can they educate healthy citizens of the future? Secondly, the women's movement is valuable in its universality. Women who receive higher education are pioneers who know before and know before, and know later. Their responsibilities are even more important. If most women are struggling in the lives of prostitutes, and a few pioneers do not help them, then the women's movement will definitely fail. Thirdly, a husband and wife work together to form a prototype of society. Therefore, forming a good family is the foundation for transforming society, and educating children is the greatest contribution and most significant effect of women to the family, society, and country. When Ms. Chen Zhen-Quan gave her speech, her voice was like a loud bell, passionate and慷慨, and she had the spirit of a great man. She painfully stated that women in the past misunderstood freedom (which led to the sharp increase in today's tragic divorce cases and the habit of women tending to be luxurious, extravagant, and promiscuous. They turned a blind eye to the virtues of diligence and thrift). Women should quickly plan remedial measures for this kind of forgetful psychology. She also exposed the weaknesses and misconceptions of women and the failure of past women's movements, which is admirable. Secondly, Mr. Zhu Ying-Peng Zhang Yi's long speeches were also very moving. The meeting was adjourned at 5 o'clock, and the crowd shouted "tired" incessantly.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Wine Spring Brews Tears and Records Deep Sorrow <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Ting Bing Sheng</p>
<p>I met a guest in a wine shop, wearing military uniform, with the style of a knight from Yan and Zhao. I was secretly surprised. After consuming half a catty of Huadiao wine, about six jugs, he suddenly roared, scolded the seat, slammed the table, and scolded the so-called justice of the world. Then, he burst into tears, covered his face, and cried bitterly, sobbing incessantly. My heart was moved. Alas, is it also the way of those who are not met by the times and want to vent the repressed and unjust anger in their hearts with wine? So, I secretly asked the waiter if the guest's name was Jiang, a native of Taiping Township, Sheng County. Every time he gets drunk, he stares, grinds his teeth, roars madly, cries bitterly, and cannot control himself. Then, is he also a sad man? The next night, I met him again and gave him my name card. Although his appearance was haggard, he occasionally showed heroism. However, his words were calm, gentle, and approachable. At first, I did not expect that we would meet by chance and he would immediately allow me to express my deep feelings and heart. Mr. Jiang said, I have a younger cousin named Lin Biao. His family was poor and he could not study. When he grew up, he engaged in farming. His father ordered him to marry the second daughter of Zhou Gui-Ting, the head of Kaiyuan Town. After the wedding, the woman had immoral conduct and had an affair with a man named Qian next door. Qian was a bully in the countryside, and Biao did not dare to resist. He advised his wife to no avail. Qian's gang even tried to use axes to chop Biao. Fortunately, he escaped early and was spared. Biao's father, fearing that disaster would come, quickly sent Biao to flee. The family hugged each other and cried. A dog wagged its tail and bit its clothes, refusing to let go. Biao's wife was moved by her conscience and knelt down to pray to God, deeply repenting and willing to follow Biao. After a long time, they settled in Xidouwan Village, Wu Kang County. They met a fellow villager named Qian Xiang-Lin, who recruited workers on the spot. Biao joined his rule, and his wife worked as a maid. They rented a thatched hut to live in. They lived in peace for several days. Soon, Qian discovered their whereabouts. The secret agents traced their tracks as expected. He used a hundred gold to heavily entice Biao's wife. The woman was greedy and was deceived. She deceived Biao by serving Qian. She did not know the ways of the world. At first, she seemed happy, but in the end, she was sad. She bought poison and waited for Biao to return. She smiled and persuaded him to drink it. Biao did not notice and died. Qian had him buried. Biao's wife then carried the coffin back to Sheng and lived in her mother's house. After a year, she lived with Qian like husband and wife. In the middle of November last year, Qian was heavily in debt due to gambling and could not repay it. The creditors sold Biao's wife privately to the Guo family in Shangbai Village, Wu Kang. This matter was really a family scandal that could not be publicized. However, everyone far and near knew about it. I, a passerby, collected evidence and submitted it to the gentry of the county, asking them to redress the injustice. The gentry of the county took Qian's bribe and ignored it. If I wanted to submit it to the government, I would not have the funds and I would definitely lose the case. Alas, sir, is there any justice in the world? After saying this, hot tears splattered down and dripped into the wine glass. He picked up the glass and said to me, "Life is tears!" Recorded by Ting Bing Sheng on March 3, 1920.</p>
<p>Publishing News: The Dafenghao Three-Day Publication, which is mainly run by the Xu Muyun and Xiao Ting brothers, has been published on the anniversary of the Premier's death. The content includes two photos of the Premier's transfer from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital to the Biyun Temple in Xishan. The important figures of various factions in Ping at that time were all photographed, which is quite valuable. The contributors include Shu Sheyu, Zheng Guoyi, You Ban-Du, and Su Shao-Qing. The content is extremely rich. The second issue includes a photo of Mr. Wu Mingyi, the fiancé of Ms. Zhang Biyue, the female student who shot Huang Chang-Dian in the past and committed suicide in the dormitory of Datong University a month ago. Mr. Wu also wrote a self-report, publishing the causes and consequences of Biyue's suicide, which is of great value.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen:  Remaining Youthful With Skilled Makeup and Painted Eyebrows; Prolonging Life Without Method, Golden Market for Excellent Horses</p>
<p>Ye Tong-Hou sat on the edge of her bed. Hua Yuan-Chun poked her face out of the quilt, widened her eyes, and looked at Ye Tong-Hou before shaking her head, saying, "There's a sick person's breath in this room, Third Young Master, please stay away from me." She then closed her eyes again and sighed, saying, "My chest feels stuffy." Ye Tong-Hou leaned closer to look and saw that Lao Liu's face was flushed red, as if she had applied rouge. Even though she was sick, she looked even more charming, and her watery eyes looked even bigger. She pointed her slender finger at her mouth, and A-Jin-Jie said, "Sixth Miss wants to drink boiled water?" She closed her eyes and nodded. When the small teapot was brought to her mouth, she refused to drink, and her pale lips twitched, as if she were saying something. A-Jin-Jie then gave Ye San a look, meaning that she was talking nonsense again. She touched her forehead and said, "The fever is still scalding." A-Jin-Jie's hand touched her head, and she seemed startled, jumping up and staring straight at Ye Tong-Hou, saying, "He...he...who is he?" A-Jin-Jie said, "It's Third Young Master Ye, how can you not recognize him?" Hua Lao-Liu let out a shrill smile, saying, "Third Young Master is here? My loved one is here?" As she spoke, she pursed her lips. A-Jin-Jie brought the small teapot closer, and she took a sip of boiled water, sighing deeply, saying, "My mouth feels uncomfortable." Ye San asked, "Is there anything else that's uncomfortable?" She frowned and said, "My whole body is uncomfortable, and my throat is also choking." Ye Tong-Hou saw that something was wrong, and her illness seemed very serious. He asked A-Jin-Jie, "Have you called a doctor?" A-Jin-Jie said, "I called a doctor who is very familiar with them in the store. He seems to have a Beijing accent. He prescribed a dose of medicine, but she vomited it all out." Ye Tong-Hou was a modern person, so he naturally believed in Western medicine. He said, "That kind of doctor from Beijing won't do. I have an acquaintance who works as a Western doctor here. His surname is Pan. I don't know if he's home at this time. It's best if I go and accompany him here myself." A-Jin-Jie said, "I'm sorry to trouble you, Third Young Master, that would be great." Ye Tong-Hou then went to pull this Dr. Pan over. Fortunately, the road wasn't very far, and he was on Xijiaomin Lane. This Dr. Pan was from the same hometown as Ye Tong-Hou and was very sincere and amiable. When he arrived at Hua Yuan-Chun's bed, he asked about her illness. At this time, Hua Yuan-Chun was still awake and told Dr. Pan that her head was dizzy and her chest felt stuffy. Dr. Pan saw that her face was flushed and said, "Light two more Western candles, please. The electric lights in Beijing are really killing people." After the Western candles were lit, Dr. Pan first shone them on her face, then used his fingers to hold her cheeks and looked at her, asking about her throat and saying that he wanted to see her chest. Hua Yuan-Chun heard this and used her strength to unbutton her chest. When two buttons were undone, a pair of full breasts suddenly jumped out.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Gold Market Rebound Trend <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The situation is extremely complex. Yesterday, March 12th, the gold market rebounded after its previous sharp decline. However, the situation was abnormally chaotic and bizarre. At times, the price fluctuated by several taels, from two to ten taels. Overall, the market changes reached twenty-one or two taels. Looking back, the final rebound was fourteen or five taels. In terms of trading among firms, Zifeng Yongyuan, Qian Changxiang, and the Dalian gang, among others, had more demand than supply. Hengxing Yuanmao Yongrui Kang and others were sellers. The foreign exchange trend was good, and quotes were long and recurring. Overseas silver markets repeatedly reported gains, but American selling intentions were strong. Thus, sentiment rebounded upwards. It seemed that gold prices would soar by more than ten taels in the future, and exchange rates appeared to be easing. There was a retreat once within 695 taels. Afterwards, buyers became excited, and the situation was good, with a sudden sharp rise of more than ten taels. It is now known that a certain bank has already shipped a large quantity of spot goods to be sent overseas. This, combined with the tightening of the exchange ban, has further strengthened the bullish sentiment, causing prices to pierce through the clouds, reaching over 710 taels. Finally, sellers showed reluctance, and there was a slight pullback. This morning, the forecast for large bars is trending downward.</p>
<p>Opening jump of 11.5 taels. This morning, the April opening price was 705 taels, a jump of 11 taels and 5 mace. Although large bars rose by 16/3, and silver prices increased by 8/3, it was still insufficient, and the US was willing to sell at a depreciated price. Moreover, private telegrams reduced by 125, so sentiment was greatly boosted, and there were still many buyers. Subsequently, the price was raised from 703.5 taels to 709.5 taels. Afterwards, Yuanmao, Yongqian, Changxiang, and goods companies all sold, and the market suddenly softened, with a sharp drop of 13 taels, reaching only 695.8 mace. At that time, Qian Changxiang and others re-entered, so it doubled back to a high of seven or eight taels and was taken by Datong. When the June British gold opened at 13,875 shillings, it was 703.5 taels, and the quote was already 125 US dollars. The 25th gold fell by 1.5 points, only falling by 1.5 taels, to 702 taels. Then it was added to 704 taels. Later, because Mitsui issued British gold at 13,937.5, and the Dalian gang sold, it retreated to 696.5 taels. Hengxing Yuan and others bought in, and in just six or seven minutes, it rose to 701 taels. After that, the wind suddenly turned downward, and Yuanmao Yong Dadecheng Shunli Wanxing and others sold heavily. When British gold rebounded, banks were willing to pay a price of 4 pence. Immediately, the situation turned turbulent, falling by eight or nine taels. At 10:15, it suddenly became 693 taels. Soon, Chenfeng Yongtong Taichang Yuanheng and speculators all came to chase, and it had already pierced through 700 taels. After a while, the Dalian gang also bought, so after two hours, it soared by twelve or thirteen taels. However, there were occasional three or four-tael consolidations. At 11:15, it was 706.5 taels. Then it went down because Qian Changxiang and Ruikang sold. By 11:30, it had retreated to 698.5 taels, unexpectedly depreciating by more than eight taels. The situation was truly confusing and unpredictable. Then, Yuancheng Zhifeng Yongcheng Fengyong goods companies and others entered one after another, and at noon closing, it was raised to 705.5 taels, then made to 707.8 taels, with the posted price changed to 751.8 taels, with the "qin" small, 50 taels inside and outside.</p>
<p>The result rebounded by 14.5 taels. The after-market opened at 709.5 taels, which was the remaining momentum after the noon closing. Then it returned to 705.34 mace, and then increased to 708 taels. Hengxing Zhifeng Yong Fuchang and others sold, depreciating by 4 taels, a total of 704 taels. At 2:20, the top was seen because British gold was firm, and banks traded steadily at 13,687.5. Mitsui bought 6875. Yu Dabingxing Qian Changxiang and speculators all bought in, so it gradually rose by five or six taels. At 3:00, HSBC's posted price suddenly shrunk to 125 US dollars. The 25th gold increased by 1.5 points, and it was learned that a certain bank's cash had been packed out in a very large amount, totaling more than 28,000 bars. Sentiment rose sharply, and near-term and long-term British gold were eaten up by banks, reaching 714.5 taels at 3:20. Afterwards, sellers mobilized, and because 625 British gold was difficult to sell, it turned downwards, sharply falling by more than 7 taels. At 4:00, it was 707 taels. When British gold at 13,625 could be settled, Mai Jiali bought 1375. After entering, it was increased by 5 taels. At 4:20, it was 11 taels. At this time, there were slightly more buyers, and at the 4:30 closing, it was 708 taels, an increase of 14.5 taels compared to the previous day. It was again suppressed to 706 taels, and then to more than 707 taels, as Chenfeng Yong and others bought in. The highest price of the day was 714.5 taels, and the lowest price was 693 taels, a difference of 21.5 taels. The early market price for goods was 704 taels, the noon closing was 708 taels, the afternoon was 709 taels, and the closing price was 705.5 mace. The posted price "qin" was 423 taels to 48 taels, then changed to 759 taels, with the "qin" being 445 taels to 512 taels. Dengzhen was 699 taels and 706 taels, and Buyong was 659 taels and 701 taels.</p>
<p>Turnover among firms was very chaotic. In terms of trading among firms, Hengxing Yuan Zhifeng Shui Yuanheng Yu Dacheng Fengyong Hengyu, and others were all buyers. Wanxing Shunli Qian Changxiang demand exceeded supply. Yuantai Tong Taichang also bought in. Hengxing Yuanmao Yongda Kang Ruikang Dadecheng all sold. In the afternoon, Bingxing Yu Da Wanxing Shunli Qian Changxiang Yuantai all bought in. Hengxing Yongheng Yuanmao Yong then sold. Dadecheng Futai Hengyu Heyuan Maotai Fengcheng had different ins and outs. The Dalian gang bought in a total of 5,000 bars and sold 3,000 bars. The Guangdong gang sold more than 1,000 bars in total.</p>
