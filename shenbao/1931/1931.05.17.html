<p>時評</p>
<h3>銀會議之發起召集問題</h3>
<p>吾嘗言之。銀會議之重要。在能否誠意合作與能否眞心肯犧牲。而不在發起之屬於何人。地點之屬於何國。蓋此次之會議。爲全世界問題。而非某一國之問題。不過開會不可無地點。不可無發起召集之人耳。然而今觀各國之態度。皆表示極願贊成。而又皆不願發起召集。美英已有如此表示。而日本亦已非正式議定。不願發起此會。據路透電謂。日本之所以不願發起。因此會成功與否。尚屬可疑耳。美英日三國。爲與銀問題最有關係之國。而又皆不願發起。此已可異者也。除英美日之外。中國爲原提議之國。發起召集。亦無不可。然而據華盛頓電。美政府方面又謂中國召集此會。不能動人東京電謂日人方面。亦</p>
<p>以中國爲銀本位國。召集不甚相宜中國旣不宜召集。則此外更有可國相宜耶。夫銀會議問題。用銀國與用金國之利害旣殊。用金國之目的。皆在挽救其對華貿易之頽勢。而對華貿。易又各以勢力大小不同而異其觀念。故此問題之成功與否。誠爲疑問。惟因其有疑問而并不願發起。則心已不誠。所謂贊成亦多事矣。嗚呼。</p>

<h3>一個全國紀錄</h3>
<p>五個大會紀錄—</p>
<p>撑竿跳高—破全國紀錄</p>
<p>—中央陳陵—三米四九五—</p>
<p>撑竿跳高欄鐵餅標槍千五百</p>
<p>—均破大會紀錄—</p>
<p>二日大會、共造成新紀錄五種、第二日陳陵之撑竿跳、三米四九五、非特打破凃傳䈁三米四五之江大紀錄、且破全國紀錄夏翔之三米四七五、爲大會生色不少、造成之五種大會新紀錄、爲（一）中公馬逢瑞之千五百米、（二）中央陳陵之高欄、（三）光華王季淮之標槍、（四）中央高尚志之鐵餅、（五）中央陳陵之撑竿跳、又公開鉛球亦全國新紀錄、惜未正式比賽、</p>
<h3>中央田賽覊王</h3>
<p>—陳陵撑竿跳特出—</p>
<p>—光華屈居第二席—</p>
<p>男生田賽、中央大學以二十分獲得錦標、不堪田賽覊王、第一日中央以三分超出曁南、十與七之比、光華僅以跳遠五分居第三、昨日决賽四項、中央於撑竿跳高、驟加六分、而曁南未得分、於是此勝彼敗、且中央陳陵於此項亦造成三米四九五之全國新紀錄、尤爲可貴、標槍硏級跳遠、王季淮又得二第一、光華遂躍居第二、中央趙汝功雖未參加此項、而曁南僅得一分、希望遂絶矣、標槍温鼎新不能平等自己保持之江大紀錄、只得三分、使中央反得二分、此數端者、由勝負之由來也</p>

<h3>曁南徑賽冠軍</h3>
<p>較中央多一分</p>
<p>得力於二百米</p>
<p>曁南得徑賽冠軍、較中央僅多一分、此中大有僥幸、徑賽一門、原爲曁南中央所逐鹿、他人實無染指問鼎之機遇、曁南精於短距離、中央於高中二欄、確有把握、中距離之成績、中央較爲生色、如上述論、中央希望似大、且短距離中、尚有健將復旦顧再平在焉、然而曁南經艱難困苦之奮鬥、卒以一分之多、高占鰲頭、其故有二、二百米之競賽、顧再平呼聲極高曁南老將郝春德鍾連基難與爭雄、不料老將大顯威風、壓倒新進名手、郝首、鍾交、顧三、而曁南曾榮忠又奪得第四席、中央全軍失敗結果曁南得九分之多、於全局極有應嚮此其一、徑賽之末一幕、係中欄一項、其時曁南二十五分、中央十八分、相差七分、中央參加四人、曁南無人、中央四人中且有十分把握穩得第一之陳陵在内、其他三人、能得一第二位置或第三第四兩位置者、均將以二十六反居曁南之上即退一步論、如能奪得第三位置者、各二十五分、中央且以多一項第一（曁南二項中央三項）得錦標、換言之、斯時之暨南、束手無策、惟有聽天由命而已、然而事實上、竟生變化、陳陵第一、固無異疑、光華陶莫傑、交大張金鎔、覇占第二第三位置、中央雖努力、但實力不及、無可奈何、此其二、</p>

<p>女子田徑錦標、中央得來易如反掌、以四十九分列首、七項比賽中、除擲棒球推鉛球二項外、無一項非第一名、此次女生田徑除中央暨南二校踴躍參加外、若光華復旦、均畏縮不前、減去興味不少、幾成爲中央曁南復旦之對抗比賽希望下屆一致競爭也、</p>

<h3>美國酒禁中之奢聞</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>酒之爲物。舊說謂其亂性。新說謂其衰弱神經。蓋其麻醉力殊甚也。美國酒禁綦嚴。罰鍰之重。爲各國所未有。一般酒徒不得聚而酣飲。爲之悶損。無已乃於星期之暇。匿瓶酒於船底。駛至烟波浩森。杳無人蹤之處。然後狂歌縱飲。竟日爲懽。奈藏匿瓶酒。日久被警士所破獲。拘酒徒去而嘗鐵窗風味焉。膽怯者不敢弁髦法禁。乃購緬甸酒樹之果啖之。聊以慰情。酒樹之果。形似椰子。剖之汁塋白而甘。略帶酒味。多飲亦能醉人也。惟值昻不易購取耳。於是異想天開。製酒成乾粉。由婦女代爲運送。大都故作月信來潮乾酒巧藏諸於經帶中。以避警士之目。送至。和之以水。居然佳釀。禁酒之趣聞。較諸吾國禁烟聲中之私運烟土。尤爲詭奇異特也。聞紐約有富豪路立克許者。錢能通神。購酒萬罃。悉傾灌於池中。某日宴會賓客。使青春女子。裸而拍浮於酒池。玉體美漿。色香愈饒。客放浪形骸。酗醟無忌。樽空。裸女子勺酒而盈之。以池涸爲止。裸女子更起而爲舞。酒芬散溢。春色盎然。其奢侈淫荒。空前絶後。友人旅美有年。爲予述此。友人亦嗜飲者。謂在美得酒。幾視爲玉液瓊漿云。</p>
<h3>倡門節婦</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>倡門焉有節婦。節婦豈在倡門。然事竟有之。抑亦奇已。按不佞曩曾撰「可憐的新娘」一篇。刊於本談。記隣家陸氏女過門守節。與死人結婚事。今此篇中之主角。即陸氏女也。女自矢志柏舟後。度共凄凉之歳月。光陰荏苒。忽忽三載。顧女遭遇之奇詭。有非女所及料。亦非女所能堪者。初。女涕泣而適某氏也。本其一腔熱誠。置一切於不顧。亦非有所覬覦。其姑得此儻來之婦。平日待之頗優。凡飲食服御。所需靡弗應。且體貼周至。出則置車以代步。入則有話匣等以悦耳。詎姑之處心積慮。實大有望於女。蓋姑本爲七十鳥。設妓院於北里。女所居與院密邇近水樓台。無非欲其耳濡目染。庶可同流合汚。漸與俱化爲摇鐵樹一分子。乃女偶入紙醉金迷之塲。見諸姬之妖形媚態。輒掩面而走。羞與爲伍。女旣守身如玉。不爲環境所移。其姑獲此石田。則大恚。自是姑媳之間。勢如水火。客歲之冬。其姑計無所出。乃迫女遷居院中。謂自女來歸後。用度日繁。不得不行緊縮之策。以節開支。女聞言。啜泣終宵。謂寗死不願爲墮溷之花。翌日即告歸寗。旣行。姑厲色曰。汝歸亦良佳。此間豈少汝喫飯人耶。惟一切衣飾。本吾家所有物。不能任若取求也。女意雖弗忍。則亦無如之何。今女歸已數月。嘗見其截髮革履。作時世裝。而面現雙渦。丰韻依然。夫女固猶清白女兒身也。乃忽爲新娘。忽爲節婦。且幾險爲賣笑之妓。今又鍛羽而歸。（不能安居守節。）回復其閨女生活。其身世之變幻。極波譎雲詭之致。不知其芳心中作如何感想也。惟乃父憒憒。迄未斷然與某姓絶。俾另匹佳偶。而亦諱莫如深。尚無求凰之意云。</p>
<h3>火車等人</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>我們出去旅行。要搭火車。一定要照準車站上的行車時刻。否則遲了一分。甚或一秒。火車便不會爲你少留片刻。然而這裏也有火車等人的一回事。那不是很奇怪嗎。原來印度海達拉巴地方。有一個人呌尼賽姆Nizam。他是全世界最富的富翁。家裏的財産。共有二十萬萬美金。他的住宅後面。建有一個車站。有一輛專車停着。每天總是生着火像要開車的樣子。就是他不想出去。也是如此。有人問他。他就這樣說。「火車應當等人呢。還是人去等火車。這樣他隨便在什麽時候。想出去旅行。火車馬上就會發動。不必等候了。</p>
<h3>游金仙寺記</h3>
<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>金仙寺爲慈谿縣屬第一大蘭若。始建於明代。在鳴鶴塲之西。白洋湖之濱。風景頗爲優美。比者余訪友於慈谿。因往游焉。寺南向。負山而面湖。因山而建。氣象崢嶸。前爲山門。進爲天王殿。供四大天王。即所謂風調雨順者是也。像高二丈許。更進。則爲大雄寳殿。供如來。殿宇深邃。時方作佛事。僧衆可二三二人。鐘磬悠揚。香烟繚引。梵唄聲徐徐而發。聆之令人有超塵之想。殿背供觀音大士。趺而立。更進。則爲方丈之室。壁上懸白龍山人所作佛像。神采奕然。即啜茗於此焉。寺於光緒間重建。故棟字尚如新。殿旁别有客堂齋堂僧房數十間。雜植松柏之屬。禪誦之徒。凡數十人。初。居民於月夜。輒見山半有一金衣和尚。拄錫而立。有大膽者逼視則無有。乃知是我佛化身。旋鳩金創寺。其得名蓋以此焉。寺後之山。名北嶺峰。遍山皆種松。冢纍纍然。大有北邙之意。登其上。則白洋湖即在足下。羣山四圍抱之。若水盂然。湖中叢生蘆葦。水白蘆青。相映成殊麗。小舟容與。水鳥出没。足以入畫。蓋湖廣二百畝。聚溪澗之所出。故浩浩焉若不可極。覽之不知撲却俗塵幾斛矣。旣下。沿塘而歸。微風吹來。激水作澎湃聲。若相送然。吾人日處都市間。塵埃窒口鼻欲嗆。以視彼漁樵牧豎。狎山色而饜湖光。其得失果何如耶。其得失果何如耶。自金仙寺歸後書。</p>

<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>好潔。美德也。然過猶不及。不惟無人愛敬。反以之招怨。試述兩事。以供譚助。</p>
<p>閘北有某甲。生有潔癖。其所居爲單幢屋。室中整潔異常。窗明几掙。不見纖塵。即地板之上。亦日必一刷。恐日人之蓆座。猶不足與之媲美。登樓之梯。以其磴級之觸及衣也。更時時拂之刷之。僕之稍怠者。呵叱立至。偶見微穢。則被駡者。室人俱不免焉。室外亦實行其祗掃門前雪。囑僕將穢物分掃兩旁。又以潔水冲洗。日三四次。前後戶皆然。與隣較。一穢一潔。界劃天然。入其里有不識其居者。祇心誌一潔凈之門戶可得之矣。客皆視爲畏途。非不獲已者不往。往則及門必先視其履。拂其衣。旣入。勿動其物。愼其咳吐。香烟之灰。勿墮於地。否則縱不下逐客令。而已愠然於面矣。故與之交往者綦少。即其僕人。亦皆不能久留也。</p>
<p>昔在某校。有同事某君。亦愛潔異常。每日晨起。其被褥必挾至操塲。拍之拭之。始入而摺疊。並埀其帳。阻塵垢之飛入。椅桌之整理。不假手校工。盥漱旣畢。即以餘水。漬巾揩抹。由桌椅之面。以致四足。再三而止。飲料自置一壺。晨間亦必自行洗滌。旣拭其外。復潔其中。注以清泉。傾之復注。必十易而後可。其床其桌及一切所用之物。人咸不可近。近則必遭其怒。苟歸里。則一紙一筆。安置亦有標識。有動之者。至即知之。而惡語侵人矣。故同事皆遠之。余與相處一載。與語不及十次也。</p>
<h3>黄海環遊記（五）</h3>
<p>— 黄炎培</p>
<p>日本處處鬧的是不景氣。從大連市上就可見到。公共的電車。久久没有擦油了。街頭路牌。剥落得辨不清了。若在平時。在日本管理轄之下那會有此。一到瀋陽。便大不同。雖說市面不好。但在瀋陽城内。找一家比較過得去的旅館。容三四人住宿的。窮多人一日之力。竟找不到。大概旅館資格在水平綫以上的。全告客满了。但當地人告訴我。瀋陽城裏的旅客。還是帶政治意味居多數。</p>
<p>我有四年不到瀋陽了。這四年中。新市塲闢得很多。街道房屋。着實添得不少。據說。去年金價飛漲。大豆滯銷。誠哉感受了很不良的影響。但是前幾年光景很好。每新闢一條大道。不上一年。商店也佈满了。居民也伎满了。聽說瀋陽市政當局。很有才幹。有勇氣。</p>
<p>我所特别注意的兩點。（一）國際間未來的推測。（二）社會經濟現况。</p>
<p>北满之於蘇俄。南满之於日本。國際間種種糾紛。壹皆以鐵路爲中心。欲解除金箍咒的束縛。必須從交通上打開一條出路。這是當然的。東省政府在此數年間。居然把南满鐵道以東及以西兩路工程。從不動聲色中。完全告竣。有借欵的。也有用自己欵的。這怪不得日本人吃一大驚了。一田中奏禀說。「事前未甚注意。及後欲强阻之。其路綫已成」。—</p>

<h3>霍桑探案轉灣（一六）</h3>
<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>霍桑提議往高家方面去偵查。固然很近情的。不過他單呌我向佩芬去探聽。一時我還有些懷疑。他莫非疑心到這個人和佩芬有什麽關係。像佩芬這樣的年齡和天眞。料想不會和這種陰謀的人接近。霍桑的神經似乎未免過敏。可是他定下的方針。我除了遵從以外。實不敢擅自變更。第二天早晨。我佩芹的病略見起色。寒熱旣退。我也放懷了些。喫過早飯。便趕到高家裏去。這一回機會很好。我岳父母上夜裏因着應酬忙碌。身子覺得困乏。所以還没有起身。佩賢却一早到了衞戍司令部去了。當我進去的時候。那女僕小妹告訴我。佩芬小姐起身不久。正在樓上梳裝。我呌小妹到樓上去通報了一聲。便在樓下書室中等待。約模等了十分鐘光景。便聽得閣閣的皮鞋聲音。很急促的走進書室裏來。伊的身上穿着一件純黑的細卍紋的月華葛旗衫。長得齊了足脛。一雙活潑的眼睛。笑盈盈的走近來和我招呼。伊道。「姊丈。你好早啊。我哥哥說。昨夜裏你不别而行的逃席。今天要向你辦交涉呢。」我答道。「昨夜我因爲你姊姊有些寒熱。放心不下。我又恐被同席的纏住了灌酒。所以就悄悄回去。今天我本準備來請罪的。」佩芬臉上笑容頓時歛住。忙問道。「我姊姊怎樣。可還有寒熱。」我道。「今天早晨伊的寒熱已退盡了。大致可以無礙。」我說到這裏。言歸正傳。就打算開始我探聽的任務。可是一時不知道怎樣啓齒。佩芬似已瞧破了我的心事。伊忽先問道。「旣然如此。你臉上怎麽還擔足了心事似的。」我乘勢道。「昨夜裏我遇到一件奇怪的事情。有一個人似要向我暗算。」伊的目光轉動了一下。忽把纖掌拍了一下。說道。「咦。姊丈。你又帶了什麽奇怪的案子來麽。快說。快說。我已好久没有聽得奇怪的故事了。」我莊容道。「今天不是我來講給你聽。却是要你講給我聽的。」佩芬的目光在我臉上凝注了一下。似已覺得我的話不是笑話。便也抑住了笑容。伊問道。「什麽。我怎能講什麽故事。」我道。「不是故事。我要請你指出一個人來。」於是我就把上夜裏遇見的那人的面貌衣飾。向佩芬說明。問伊曾否認識。</p>

<p>英滙　内盤僅以零六二五升降、早市出價一先令三便士二五、買價三一二五、上海·三井·正金·和豐·滙豐·麥行·朝鮮·華比·台灣等售出、七月份二五、台灣出八月二五、三井出七八月二五至一八七五、正金買六月二五、至九點半後大英出八月二五、十點一刻台灣出七月二五、（大豐恒進）後盤根出六月二五、十一點廿分上海出二五、午收出價二五、進價三一二五、</p>

<h3>週末銀根奇鬆</h3>
<p>市塲概况　連日銀洋市况、作狂驟之漲落、人心捉摸不定、以致一般多空兩方、莫能有所準繩、轉將大批額子軋直者甚多、故近來洋戶頭襯、比較輒少、而銀欵拆票因亦寥落、至於輔幣市况中、惟銅元又放長甚多、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市爲七錢二分八厘六毫二忽半、午市爲七錢二分八厘半、結果較前日午市小去六毫二忽半、（銀拆）早午兩市仍復白借、劃頭亦無加水、始終白劃、頭襯異常充斥、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋、早市爲六錢五分一厘半、午市爲六錢五分三釐、做出交易、早市六千角、午市五千五百角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢四分五釐、午市爲六錢四分七釐半、做出交易、早市十三萬五千角、午市十二萬角、銅元突然又放長四千文、計有三百八十二千文、故兌換牌放長三十餘文、</p>
<p>銀洋進出（銀欵）銀行收解、昨因值星期六、比較清閑、華商收解票欵一百九十餘萬、外商收解票欵一百二十餘萬、各種貨匯税什諸欵收解八百六七十萬、出倉一百四十萬、日商銀行收解各欵四百二十餘萬、進倉三十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千五百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百六十餘萬、各路匯欵收解八十餘萬、收現數十萬、（洋欵）滙劃票欵早市做出一百五十七萬、午市做出六十八萬五千鈔票早市五千、午市二萬五千、塲外鈔票早市十六萬五千、午市十二萬二千、銀行買賣、早市互市六十萬、午市互市六十七萬、各銀行洋戶往來收解一百七十餘萬、鈔票進出一百四五十萬、錢莊洋公單收解五百四十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百四十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百五十餘萬、小錢莊買賣六十餘萬、</p>
<h3>證劵債價先跌後漲</h3>

<p>昨公債市况、現貨惟編遣於上午開出、期市則較前旺盛、上午兩盤、以市上人氣仍較虚弱、續跌甚勁、較前日復跌下一元左右、後市轉好結果較前日如二○捲一九善整六關税等、各續漲六七角左右、其他亦大致稍回堅、計期貨上午成交一千四百五十餘萬、後市亦有一千一百六十餘萬元、合計達二千六百十餘萬、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市在賣氣高壓之下</h3>
<p>紗市疲軟、因美棉連跌、人心軟化、賣方壓力愈烈、且時局謡諑紛紜、市氣尤疲、惟東洋大阪三品紗漲勢仍劇、因該處銷路起色底貨枯弱之故、市盤由此上漲、須合銀盤二百十餘兩、故本紗出口交易益覺發展、申新廠有三家日商洋行談判、約數有三四千包之巨、因期限問題、未能妥洽、廠中五月份早已售馨、祇有期貨可賣、日商欲現貨即刻裝出、上日購去十六支人鐘二百包、一百六十二兩外税、如匯兌堅硬不動、輸出前途、仍有極大希望、惟本埠市氣甚弱、散戶大數抛空以粗紗銷勢呆滯、時局混沌、故一致抛出、以後如遇反動、深恐劇烈也、</p>
<p>人標下跌　人標前市開盤、以美棉續跌、謡言孔多、賣氣尤烈、各跌一兩二五六八錢、午後開盤賣方仍壓迫、又跌五六錢、二三盤回漲、以三品趨漲、日紗有大量輸出消息、市氣驟緊、結果各月漲三四五錢、成交計三萬五千包、查賣出和愼二千零五十包、申新九百包、泰興一千八百五十包、天隆一千零五十包、生泰一千六百五十包、買進賡豐一千五百包、大昶一千七百五十包、泰興一千零五十包、榮興八百五十包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市跌勢較厲</h3>
<p>棉市甚疲、跌風較熾、因美棉一跌不回、致散戶人心恐慌、而紗市又不振趨跌、然匯兌尚緊、外棉合價仍貴、故有一部份多頭仍不放鬆、惟環境不良、壓力尤重、難以轉機耳、</p>
<p>漢標跌六七錢　漢標前午開盤、隨美棉大跌、人氣甚虚、各跌五六七錢、午後回漲五分至一錢、成交計八萬七千二百擔、查賣出長豐六千七百擔、愼昌三千一百擔、信誠五千五百擔、公泰四千二百擔、申新二千二百擔、買進大豐一千擔、怡隆一千擔、元德一千四百擔、益昶一千五百擔、新亨二千一百擔、源大二千四百擔、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>美棉發育延遲</h3>
<p>市况隨證劵而虚軟</p>
<p>紐約十五日來電報告一週中之原棉市况云、上週棉市仍以證劵市况虚軟、及棉區氣候良好而跌、棉作及棉子之發育、均形延遲、仍爲重要之一事、不過泥土之佈置妥當、則進行自可順利、據某專家言、棉田播種已畢者約及百分之六五、去年同時則爲百分之七五、至棉田减種、則在百分之八至百分之一二之間、最近之陰雨、雖使棉作開始延遲、但於泥土則頗有利、人心仍都看小、惟賣出者已少、蓋以價格太小、而新花前途亦未可逆覩之故也云、</p>

<h3>糧食客秈本銷仍佳</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况仍活潑、因本街消化極佳、人心均各看好、且河下杜米市價步漲、更促客秈之活動、昨日統市開出南京機米一百三十包、價九元八角、湖南機米二百十包、價十元零九角半、江西機晩米九百包、價十一元四角至十一元零四五分、盡係本街一帮辦去云、</p>
<h3>粉市熱騰</h3>
<p>傳政府將徵收出口税</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、又轉堅昻之勢、以前日洋粉麥發生之電訊、昨未得回電、致内地帮之人心又復大熾、對近遠各期、紛紛吸收、雖現粉銷場、未見暢盛、但因大廠家之態度、未若從前之一意狂抛、有時反見收進、因此嵺内地帮之買氣、反覺已有脚地、午後各盤、且一度傳政府方面、將徵收出口税、致買戶尤活、惟天津帮之需要、始終未暢、恐將來洋粉之訂購、决難避免也、結果本月份較前日漲一分半、六月份漲一分七厘半、七月份漲一分半、八月份漲一分、九十月份漲二分云、</p>
<h3>期麥買意濃密</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致又見良好之象、以内地帮之心思、因本年新麥脚地、終較往年爲遜、且以廠家之洋麥、因合划不通、已難續訂、此後之需要、勢必半持新麥、所以人心轉移、買意大暢、照此情形、前途或難過落也、結果本月份較前日好五分、六月份好五分、七月份好四分、八月份好五分、九月份好四分、十月份好三分云、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲市益清</h3>

<h3>杭屬繭市沈寂</h3>
<p>全邑繭行二百餘家…預備開秤者十之二</p>

<h3>Internal Affairs Review Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Internal Affairs Review Committee's review report stated that it was entrusted to review "Please unify disaster relief administration to benefit the poor." Convened a review meeting at 3 PM on the 15th of this month in the fourth conference room. Because only 20 committee members attended, which was less than the legal quorum, it was temporarily changed to a discussion meeting. The reasons and measures of the original proposal were carefully studied and discussed. Everyone agreed that the reasons for this case were extremely legitimate, but there were slight amendments to the first and fourth items of the measures. "The amended articles are attached separately" and it was decided to suggest that the presidium submit it to the National Government for consideration. Whether it is appropriate or not, it is still subject to approval. Respectfully reporting to the presidium, Niu Yongjian, convener of the Internal Affairs Review Committee, reported, and the attached amended articles are as follows:</p>
<p>Measures: (1) Establish provincial, municipal, and county relief centers in provinces, cities, and counties, directly under the provincial, municipal, and county governments, and establish a central relief center in the central government, directly under the National Government. (2) Local relief agencies, whether government-run or private, shall be under the guidance and supervision of local relief centers, and their assets shall be managed by the fund management committee organized by the local relief centers. (3) All matters related to individual relief and social relief shall be executed by the relief centers at all levels under the order of the competent authorities at all levels. (4) Specify funds under national and local revenue items, and devise methods to raise voluntary donations to carry out relief efforts, but the funds raised shall not be used for administrative expenses.</p>

Convened a meeting at 3 PM on the 15th of this month in the National Assembly Hall and submitted it for discussion. Regarding the first case, it was resolved that the current provisional regulations and measures for stamp tax inevitably disturb the people. It is requested that the general assembly submit it to the National Government to promptly order the Legislative Yuan to set a time limit to enact a stamp tax law and implement it throughout the country. Regarding the second case, it was resolved that it be submitted to the National Government for handling by the general assembly.

<h3>Education Review Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Education Review Committee's review report stated: Eleven education cases were submitted for review. A second review meeting was convened at 2 PM on the 15th of this month. Each case was submitted for discussion, and the results are listed and attached. Whether it is appropriate or not, please ask the presidium for approval. (1) Improve overseas Chinese education in Annam. The original proposal had three items. Except for the second item, as the Ministry of Education has already issued regulations, there is no need for discussion. The third item should be revised to: "Domestic schools should consider the situation and open remedial classes for overseas Chinese students returning to China," and the first item of the original measures should be submitted to the National Government for consideration. (2) Guarantee the independence of education funds and stipulate that local education expenses should account for 30% of the annual expenditure. The original proposal intends to amend Article 50 of the draft Provisional Constitution. Since the Provisional Constitution has already been passed by the general assembly, this case does not need to be discussed again. (3) Designate a portion of the Boxer Indemnity as funding for mass education. The original proposal had two items, focusing on stipulating the percentage of mass education funds in the total education expenditure. However, the Ministry of Education has previously stipulated that mass education funds should account for 10% to 20%. This case does not need to be discussed. (4) Raise the salaries of primary school teachers to improve education efficiency. The reasons are very sufficient. At this time when the government is paying attention to national education, it is appropriate to raise the salaries of primary school teachers. This case should be submitted to the general assembly for discussion. (5) Please determine concrete measures to guarantee the original education funds. Since the Provisional Constitution has already stipulated guarantee clauses, this case does not need to be discussed again. (6) All of the nation's livestock slaughter tooth tax inheritance tax, as well as Sha Tin official wasteland temple property, should be fully allocated to compulsory education funding to promote education. Items 1, 2, and 3 of the original proposal should be submitted to the National Government for consideration. (7) The time limit for implementing compulsory education must be adapted to the time limit for political tutelage. (8) Promote and improve vocational education to focus on people's livelihood. (9) Mobilize the entire country to universalize adult literacy education within a time limit to promote the exercise of the four powers. (10) Truly promote national physical education. The principles of the above four cases have either already been stipulated in the Provisional Constitution or have been suggested in the "Determine the Direction of Educational Facilities" proposed by the National Government. It is proposed to submit the original text of each case to the National Government for reference. (10) (1) Limit the time to popularize literacy education. It is proposed to send it to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government for reference. Cai Yuanpei, convener of the Education Review Committee.</p>
<h3>Finance and Economic Review Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Finance and Economic Review Committee's review report, entrusted by the presidium, and four proposals merged for review with the industry and construction program: (1) Xu Zhen and 97 others proposed to quickly allocate funds to repair the Tongzhang Road and Taolu Railway; (2) Zhang Ji and 97 others proposed to quickly allocate funds to repair the North China river courses and Huludao commercial port; (3) Chen Guoshi and 60 others proposed to complete the Jinchi Railway to benefit the people and defend the borders; (4) Wang Shufang and 60 others proposed to complete one line of the Premier's southwest railway system within the political tutelage period to benefit the national economy and people's livelihood. The above four cases were submitted to the second joint meeting on the 12th and merged for review with the industry and construction program. As a result, except for the above first and fourth cases, which have been generally covered in the second item of the industry and construction program, the remaining second and third cases were resolved as, "Proposed to submit to the National Government for consideration." Respectfully reported and awaiting approval, Kong Xiangxi, convener of the joint meeting of the Finance and Economic Review Committee.</p>
<h3>Military and Economic Review Committees</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Review Committee and the Economic Review Committee reported, respectfully reporting that these two committees were entrusted by the presidium with the proposal submitted by the Proposal Review Committee: (1) Representative Qiu Wenbo and others proposed to complete the construction of the southwest railway system within a time limit to develop the economy and strengthen national defense; (2) Representative Chen Shiquan and others proposed to develop the northwest as soon as possible to enrich people's livelihood and strengthen national defense. A review was convened at 4 PM on the 14th of this month in the hall on the second floor of this committee, with 26 members of the Military Review Committee and 49 members of the Economic Review Committee attending. As a result of the review, everyone believed that these two cases should be recommended to the presidium for submission to the National Government for reference. Zhu Peide, convener of the Military Review Committee, Jin Enqi, convener of the Economic Review Committee.</p>
<h3>Legal System Review Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legal System Review Committee's review report stated that it was entrusted to review: (1) Li Jingzhai and 54 others proposed "that all laws and regulations regarding county autonomy should be abolished"; (2) Li Zhishan and 54 others proposed, "Please resolve that those who take concubines should be regarded as bigamy, and those who become concubines should be regarded as harming the family." A meeting was convened at the gymnasium of Central University at 3 PM on the 14th of this month for review, with 38 members attending. The results of the review are reported as follows: (1) Li Jingzhai and 54 others proposed that all laws and regulations regarding county autonomy should be abolished. It is believed that the original proposal requires the abolition of the County Organization Law and all related laws and the formulation of simple clauses in the Provisional Constitution, which is practically impossible because the Provisional Constitution has already been passed and cannot be further regulated. As for the claim that the powers of the province are too great to infringe on local autonomy, the reasons are quite sufficient. All review committee members decided to recommend that the presidium submit it to the National Government for reference. (2) Li Zhishan and 54 others proposed to resolve that those who take concubines should be regarded as bigamy, and those who become concubines should be regarded as harming the family. It is believed that it can be submitted to the National Government for reference. Ding Weifen, convener.</p>

A review was convened at 3 PM on the 14th of this month in this committee on the second floor of this hall, with 26 members attending. As a result of the review, everyone believed that the content of this case was extremely important and that this case should be recommended to the presidium for submission to the National Government for reference. Zhu Peide, convener of the Military Review Committee.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Review Committee reported that it was entrusted by the presidium with the proposal submitted by the Proposal Review Committee: Representative Chang Haiqing and others proposed that military officers should be uniformly trained by the Ministry of Military Affairs and replenished according to law to standardize the direction and unify powers. This committee convened a review at 3 PM on May 15th in the first review room of this hall, with 16 members attending. As a result of the review, everyone believed that this case should be recommended to the presidium for submission to the National Government for reference. Respectfully reporting, Zhu Peide, convener of the Military Review Committee.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>Accept the Premier's Testamentary Instructions</p>
<p>Abolish Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>Support Peaceful Unification</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly passed the Declaration of the National Assembly at its eighth meeting on the 16th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>In May of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the National Assembly, in accordance with the will of the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, convened a meeting in the capital and issued a declaration to all compatriots across the country, saying: Our Chinese nation has stood in the world for more than four thousand years. Its early civilization, vast territory, and large population are unmatched by any other nation in the world. Our ancestors pioneered the way and created culture in ancient times. They inherited the legacy and carried it forward in the Han and Tang dynasties. Their great spirit continued through the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties without decline. Unfortunately, during the Qing dynasty, the monarch became accustomed to autocracy and gradually became昏庸 [muddleheaded]. Politics lost its way of cultivation, and the people suffered倒懸 [upside down]. As a result, national power declined, people's wisdom was blocked, the creative power of culture declined, and the phenomenon of national衰老 [senility] became increasingly prominent. At this time, the newly emerging nations of the West, using new inventions in science, and wielding their strong military power and abundant capital, invaded the East, and carried out their political and economic aggression on a large scale. Our Chinese nation was defeated again and again, unable to resist. Ceding territory and losing sovereignty happened repeatedly. The country fell into the position of a semi-colony, and national survival was as precarious as a pile of eggs. However, the whole country, from top to bottom, was still enjoying pleasure and indulging in rest. The decline of national ability and the decline of culture were not enough to grieve over. The fact that the nation did not realize its decline in ability and the decline in culture and urgently sought to revitalize itself was heartbreaking. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, was born at this time. With the wisdom of a 先知先覺 [one who knows and perceives before others] and with a compassionate spirit, he examined the national situation internally and observed the trends externally. He resolutely took national revolution as his own responsibility, and advanced bravely with indomitable spirit. Finally, he was able to overthrow the Manchu Qing dynasty and create the Republic of China. Both imperialism externally and warlords and bureaucrats internally were unfavorable to the success of the national revolution and the realization of the Three People's Principles. They colluded repeatedly and stubbornly resisted the national revolutionary movement. Mr. Sun Yat-sen led the people and continued to struggle for forty years. This great revolutionary leader ultimately gave his life for the revolution. After Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, the National Government, upholding his testamentary instructions, launched the Northern Expedition. After years of hard fighting, relying on the dedication of the officers and soldiers and the support of the people, the old and new warlords were all eliminated. The situation of unification was achieved. The National Assembly was able to convene in the capital to plan for the security of national unification and the promotion of construction, to establish a grand plan for long-term peace and stability, and to achieve the goal of freedom and equality. With the direction set and opinions sought and agreed upon, the necessary paths and necessary efforts that this meeting believes are necessary for the stability of the country and the nation are listed below to clearly inform the people of the country:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Sun Yat-sen took the Three People's Principles as the highest principle of the revolution. The Three People's Principles are not only sufficient to save China, but also sufficient to</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Initiation and Convening of the Silver Conference</h3>
<p>I have often said that the importance of the Silver Conference lies in whether there can be sincere cooperation and genuine willingness to sacrifice, not in who initiates it or which country the location belongs to. This conference is a global issue, not a problem of any one country. However, a conference cannot be held without a location and someone to initiate and convene it. However, looking at the attitudes of various countries now, they all express a strong desire to support it, but none are willing to initiate and convene it. The United States and Britain have already expressed this, and Japan has also unofficially decided not to initiate this conference. According to a Reuters report, Japan is unwilling to initiate because the success of the conference is still doubtful. The United States, Britain, and Japan are the countries most closely related to the silver issue, and yet none are willing to initiate it. This is already strange. Apart from the United States, Britain, and Japan, China is the country that originally proposed it, and it would be acceptable to initiate and convene it. However, according to a Washington report, the US government says that China's convening of this conference cannot move people, and a Tokyo report says that the Japanese side also</p>
<p>believes that it is not very appropriate for China, as a silver standard country, to convene it. If China is not suitable to convene it, then which other country is more suitable? The interests of silver-using countries and gold-using countries in the silver conference issue are very different. The purpose of gold-using countries is to save their declining trade with China, and trade with China differs in concept according to the size of power. Therefore, the success of this issue is truly in doubt. However, because it is doubtful and they are unwilling to initiate it, their hearts are already insincere. The so-called support is mostly a matter of form. Alas.</p>
<h3>Domestic Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>Saving the World: The sources of all disputes and chaos in the world, and the suffering of the people, are nothing more than three: first, ethnic disputes; second, political disputes; and third, economic disputes. If these three kinds of disputes do not cease, humanity will never enjoy the happiness of peace and harmony. The only way to eliminate these three kinds of disputes is through the Three Principles of the People. When nationalism is realized, all ethnic groups will be equal, and each will be able to pursue its legitimate progress and development, and ethnic disputes will cease. When democracy is realized, there will be a division of powers and functions, the government will be competent, and the people will have rights. There will never be concern about the government's autocracy and oppression, and political disputes will cease. When the people's livelihood is realized, men and women, young and old, will enjoy the happiness of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The classes of rich and poor will disappear, and economic disputes will have no use. Its profundity and breadth are beyond the reach of narrow-minded communism, nationalism, and the like. All ethnic groups need the Three Principles of the People, and the Chinese nation especially needs them at this critical juncture of survival. Moreover, Mr. Sun Yat-sen not only had profound and broad principles, but also clearly showed us practical and feasible methods and steps in his nation-building strategies and nation-building program. This conference hereby represents all the people in respectfully accepting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's entire legacy and doing our best to promote its realization. All of our fellow countrymen should know that the Three Principles of the People are the only compass for saving the country. All nationals have the responsibility to realize the Three Principles of the People and should sincerely and earnestly strive to implement them in order to create a solemn and splendid Republic of China. This is the first message from this conference to all of our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>(II) The Chinese people have been bound by a autocratic political system for thousands of years, without the opportunity to participate in politics, and their political capabilities are very weak. After the revolution, they cannot jump directly from military rule to constitutional government, and must go through a stage of political tutelage. During this period, the rule of law should be practiced, the people should be guided, and local self-government should be implemented so that the people can receive full political training in order to participate in national affairs. Mr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of this in detail in his legacy. Now that the National Government has put down the rebellion, the country has indeed moved away from military rule and entered the period of political tutelage. This conference hereby follows Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and formulates the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China for the Period of Political Tutelage, and submits it to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. This provisional constitution has eight chapters and eighty-nine articles, which contain essential regulations regarding the rights and obligations of the people, the people's livelihood, national education, the powers of the central and local governments, and the organization of the government. What is particularly important is the chapter on the Outline of Political Tutelage, which is used to determine the political program for the period of political tutelage, as well as the powers and responsibilities of the Chinese Kuomintang and the National Government during the period of political tutelage, so as to promote constitutional government. This is something that no national constitution has, and is unique to the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China for the Period of Political Tutelage. All of our fellow countrymen should know that the provisional constitution is the fundamental law during the period of political tutelage. Whether the country can enter constitutional government depends entirely on whether the provisional constitution during the period of political tutelage can be promoted without obstruction. Therefore, all of our fellow countrymen should believe in and abide by the provisional constitution, and swear to protect it with all our strength. Anyone who dares to destroy the provisional constitution will be regarded as a public enemy, so that the provisional constitution can maintain its dignity, political tutelage can be completed, and constitutional government can be realized. This is the second message from this conference to all of our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>(III) Unequal treaties are the most important tool for political and economic aggression against our country by various countries. Examining the circumstances under which these treaties were concluded at the time, there were only two types: either the defeated Qing Dynasty swallowed its anger and was willing to form an alliance under the city walls, and the other party, with the remaining power of victory, could take whatever it wanted, and any harsh conditions could be established; or the powers took advantage of the ignorance of the Qing government, its lack of understanding of the general trend of the world, and the principles of international diplomacy, and used diplomatic means to trick it into concluding treaties that harmed its independence without realizing it. At that time, most people's national consciousness had not yet awakened, and their national concept was very weak. They did not know how to resist these unequal treaties that bound our freedom and endangered our survival. The National Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen sought freedom and equality for China, and unequal treaties were the biggest obstacle to the success of the revolution. Therefore, he called on the people to abolish unequal treaties, which were both stipulated in the political program and repeatedly emphasized in his will. The people, after being awakened by the enlightened, also realized this. Since the Republic of China, the movement to abolish treaties has spread throughout the country. However, when the warlord government occupied Beiping, it considered it a good idea to attach itself to imperialism, and this movement never succeeded. Now, fortunately, the warlords have been eliminated and the country is unified. Under the National Government, the abolition of treaties is imminent. This conference represents the people and dares not shirk this responsibility. Therefore, it unanimously decided: 1. The Chinese people do not recognize any unequal treaties previously imposed on China by various countries. 2. The National Government should follow the Premier's legacy and realize the complete equality and freedom of the Republic of China in the international arena in the shortest possible time, and solemnly declare to the world that our people should know that these unequal treaties not only endanger the survival of our country and nation, but also violate justice and fairness and are a stain on human civilization. In the past, when people's intelligence was not developed, their existence could be tolerated. After the European War, new trends surged and the principle of national self-determination shone like the sun and stars. This kind of restraint imposed by one nation on another is difficult to tolerate again. Countries such as Turkey have already broken free from their shackles and restored their freedom. How can the Chinese nation be the only one to lag behind? All of our fellow countrymen should make their final determination and greatest efforts to support the National Government in completing this mission. This is the third message from this conference to all of our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>(IV) The obstacles to the National Revolution in the past were imperialism abroad and warlords who were attached to imperialism at home. Now that the warlords who were attached to imperialism have been gradually eliminated, the Red bandits who are nurtured by Red imperialism have risen up again. Their crimes are a hundred times worse than those of the warlords. Their ferocity and brutality are beyond description. For several years, various places have been ravaged by them, especially Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. Wherever they go, they kill and burn, and stop at nothing. Good people are massacred, and no one, male or female, young or old, is spared. They even make sons kill their fathers and brothers kill their brothers for pleasure. The cruelty of their torture makes the victims wish for a quick death but they cannot get it, those who see it are heartbroken, and those who hear about it are saddened. What Huang Chao and Li Chuang and others could not do, they do it without regret. In addition to the massacre, they also carry out destruction. Government offices and civilian houses are all burned to the ground. Food, livestock, clothing, utensils, and all means of subsistence are gone. The people in the bandit areas, even if they are lucky enough to escape, have no way to survive. Countless people wander, starve, and die. According to statistics, the area that has been afflicted by bandits has reached more than 300 counties, and the loss of life and property is incalculable. If they succeed, it will not only mean the destruction of the country, but also the extinction of the race. Thinking of this makes us shudder. The National Government has made the determination to fight against the Red bandits, and large armies are gathering in Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, striving to eradicate their roots and destroy their nests in the shortest possible time. However, the tangible Red bandits can be suppressed by military force, but the intangible Red bandits cannot be eliminated without the unanimous determination of the people of the whole country. All of our fellow countrymen must know that the scourge of the Red bandits is a hundred-generation disaster for our nation. Fathers should teach their sons, and brothers should encourage their brothers. Everyone should take it as their responsibility to eliminate the Red bandits and earnestly implement the resolutions of this conference on eliminating the Red bandits. Only then can the Red disaster be eliminated and the foundation of the country be consolidated. This is the fourth message from this conference to all of our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>(V) In the past few years, the central government has been forced to use force to fight against new and old warlords, and the people have been displaced and sacrificed greatly. Only today have we achieved peace and unity. While we celebrate the success of peace and unity, on the one hand, we should express our highest respect to the officers and soldiers who sacrificed their lives for their country, and on the other hand, we cannot but attribute it to the ability of the National Government to inherit the legacy and lead effectively, without avoiding difficulties and hardships, in order to achieve this result. Moreover, the National Government has not only had great success in military affairs, but also has made considerable achievements in politics, diplomacy, education, and construction. Although the extent of the achievements may not be as expected by everyone, the spirit of the leaders in charge, who are courageous, progressive, diligent, and tireless, has long been understood by the world. Moreover, the National Government has been based in Nanjing for only four years, and has unified the country for less than three years. In addition, it has been busy with military affairs and has not had a moment to rest. Yet it has still been able to achieve so much, which makes us deeply gratified. This conference hereby represents the people of the whole country in expressing its extreme trust in the National Government. Now that the military affairs have come to an end and political tutelage has just begun, this conference deeply hopes that the National Government will continue its spirit of sacrifice and struggle, lead the people, complete the work of political tutelage, and complete the great cause of nation-building. It is especially hoped that all of our fellow countrymen, having known the preciousness of peace and unity, will support peace and unity, and support the National Government that has created this situation of peace and unity. Those who dare to violate the orders of the National Government and destroy peace and unity should be eliminated by the power of the whole country, so that the work of political tutelage can be completed as soon as possible, constitutional government can be realized as soon as possible, the Chinese nation can stand independently in the world, and the people can enjoy true happiness. This is the fifth message from this conference to all of our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>(VI) Today, the livelihood of the Chinese people is extremely impoverished. To solve the problem of the people's livelihood, industrial construction is the first priority. Industrial construction has myriad aspects. This conference hereby formulates special provisions in the provisional constitution based on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, listing its important principles. It is hoped that the government and the people will have the same aspirations, and during the period of political tutelage, they will devote all their efforts to the people's construction cause, revitalize the rural areas, exploit mineral resources, dredge important rivers, and develop basic industries. All important matters such as navigation, aviation, port construction, road construction, immigration, and land reclamation should be pursued with practical and feasible plans to achieve success day by day and month by month. The government should support the development of the people's economic undertakings, and the people should assist in the success of the national economic construction, so that education and training can be combined, conservation can be properly carried out, people can be used to the best of their abilities, land can be used to the fullest extent, goods can be used to the fullest extent, and goods can flow smoothly, so as to reverse the past poverty and decline of our nation and open up a new path for the development and prosperity of the national economy. This is the sixth message from this conference to all of our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the past two hundred years, the speed of scientific progress of the Western nations has set a new record in history. This is indeed a major advance in human civilization. However, Western culture, with aggression as its center, has become a hegemonic culture. With the progress of science, it is like a tiger with wings, and the flames of aggression are becoming more and more intense. As a result, the crisis of war is becoming more and more urgent, and the techniques of human self-destruction are becoming more and more novel. Those who use force to oppress each other will inevitably perish together. This can be asserted. Although science is prosperous, mankind has not been able to fully benefit from it, but has become a tool for warmongers. This is not the fault of science itself, but the fault of hegemonic culture. To seek this remedy, we must follow the path shown by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, restore our country's inherent culture of benevolence, and supplement it with Western science to create a world of the Three Principles of the People. This will not only enable our weak nation to revive, but also prevent the crisis of human self-destruction. I deeply hope that all of our fellow countrymen, from now on, will be of one mind and one heart, follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, encourage ourselves with the heart of establishing ourselves and others, and take on the responsibility of saving the country and the world, so that the great harmony of the world will be transformed from an ideal into a reality. It is not difficult. All of my fellow countrymen, let us encourage each other. This is the declaration. (Sixteenth Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Accepting the Premier's Legacy Combined With the General Assembly Declaration</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Drafting Committee for the Declaration on Accepting the Premier's Entire Legacy reported that, having been assigned the task of drafting a declaration on accepting the Premier's legacy, it convened a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 15th of this month in the Second Review Room on the second floor of the assembly hall. The meeting was attended by Wang Shufang, Zhang Fengjiu, Hu Boyue, Ye Chucang, Di Ying, Wang Shijie, and Shao Lizi, seven people in total. All agreed that accepting the Premier's teachings was one of the important resolutions of the conference. This important expression of meaning must not be missing in the general declaration of the conference. In order to avoid duplication and to make the general declaration of the conference more substantial, and to make the expression of the general assembly's acceptance of the Premier's entire legacy particularly solemn, it is proposed to incorporate the section on the nation's respectful acceptance of the Premier's legacy into the general declaration of the assembly. Whether this is appropriate is respectfully requested for review. Respectfully submitted to the Presidium, convener Ye Chucang.</p>
<h3>Message to the Guangdong Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly's telegram to all the soldiers in Guangdong: To all the soldiers in Guangdong, after Chief Commander Chen's Jiang telegram was sent, this conference formally sent a telegram of warning with a unanimous resolution. Chief Commander Chen, as a member of the party and heavily entrusted with military affairs, rashly made inappropriate remarks, revealing signs of change. The right and wrong of obedience and disobedience have already been made clear, and the success or failure can be easily predicted. Even with the errors in Chief Commander Chen's words and actions, we still could not help but express our regret and hope that he would repent. How much more so should the officers and soldiers, who have always adhered to the Premier's principles and participated in revolutionary wars, encourage each other with a word at this critical juncture of fortune and misfortune, success and failure? Peace and unity are what the Premier taught throughout his life and have long been unanimously supported by this National Assembly. The unity of all the people is clear for all to see. Anyone who violates the trend and attempts to rebel will be destroyed immediately, without the need for divination. In the past, warlords who played with soldiers and harmed the country, when popular opinion was not fully expressed, still met their doom one after another. How much more so today, when the country has a central government, the people have a voice, and party discipline and national law are clear throughout the universe? How can dew exist under the scorching sun? Moreover, revolutionary force should be united with the people, and revolutionary force is the force of the people. This is what the Premier always expected of revolutionary soldiers. Revolutionary soldiers are only driven by principles and cannot be tools for individuals. Revolutionary soldiers are happy to die for the country and are unwilling to sacrifice themselves for individuals. Therefore, their careers and achievements spread throughout the universe and are passed down endlessly. Non-revolutionary soldiers can be lured with benefits and threatened with power. In the past, warlords harmed the country by using their personal desires to drive their officers and soldiers, and the officers and soldiers, because they had not been influenced by principles, blindly followed and willingly suffered from robbery, which was of no benefit to the country and ultimately harmed themselves. Nothing is more painful than this. The honor and disgrace of revolutionary soldiers and non-revolutionary soldiers are clearly distinguished. It can be seen that true revolutionary troops will never be driven by traitors. The officers and soldiers in Guangdong have long resided in the source of the revolution. They have been deeply influenced by the Premier's legacy and national discipline. They already understand this. Chief Commander Chen is a government official and should obey. Now he suddenly makes inappropriate remarks. If he does not realize his own errors, then he is not upright himself, how can he issue orders that can be carried out? This conference deeply knows that the soldiers stationed in Guangdong have a revolutionary history and have long made extraordinary achievements. At this time of obedience and disobedience, success and failure, they naturally have a way to be loyal to the party and the country. Looking forward to the future, we are filled with concern. We express these thoughts earnestly, and hope that you will consider them carefully. The National Assembly. (Sixteenth Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Letter to the People of Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly's letter to the people of Guangdong: To all the people of Guangdong, since the four supervisory committee members Deng, Lin, Xiao, and Gu released their 30th telegram, followed by Chief Commander Chen's Jiang telegram, picking up on superficial words and confusing the public, the whole country was shocked and public opinion was confused. In recent days, Japanese newspapers have reported that the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army is actively preparing for military action in order to threaten the central government. In the past, before warlords played with soldiers and started wars, scholars would flatter them and first use telegrams to support them, and the content was nothing more than the beginning of conflict. This time, the incident in Guangdong province unfortunately followed the same pattern as the military actions of previous warlords. The content of the telegram from the four supervisory committee members claimed to be an impeachment of the government. It is not our intention to interfere with the supervisory committee members exercising their supervisory powers over the party's government. However, since the Central Supervisory Committee has recognized the impeachment by the four supervisory committee members as untrue and refused to accept it, Deng, Lin, Xiao, and Gu, as supervisory committee members, should obey the decision of the Supervisory Committee, and people outside the Supervisory Committee should not have any opinions on this matter. The Central Supervisory Committee's reply to Deng, Lin, and others has just been disclosed, and Chief Commander Chen suddenly issued a Jiang telegram, picking up on the untrue impeachment of Deng, Lin, and others to endanger the world's view. On what basis and from what standpoint did Chief Commander Chen make these irresponsible remarks? We, representatives of the people of the whole country, attending the National Assembly, are accepting the Premier's legacy and discussing the provisional constitution for the period of political tutelage, and are working with the people of the whole country to promote the realization of the Three Principles of the People and to build a solid foundation for the nation for ten thousand years. After discussing the provisional constitution, we have also sent a telegram to the whole country to support peace and unity and to warn Chief Commander Chen. Guangdong is a part of the territory of the Republic of China and the interests of the Cantonese compatriots of the Republic of China are vested in it. It cannot be allowed to be occupied by a few soldiers, nor can a few soldiers be allowed to gamble with it. If, unfortunately, someone uses this as a basis to make trouble, not only will the peace of the whole country be destroyed, but the local security will also be shaken. Moreover, the Red atmosphere on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi has not subsided. If they come howling, they will immediately ravage the area. Those who are afflicted by the Red bandits will be able to profit from the situation. How can all of our Cantonese compatriots bear to be fish in the pond again? With this critical juncture of interests, we are already aware of the situation. Guangdong is the source of the revolution, and all the Cantonese compatriots are deeply immersed in the Premier's legacy. The great cause of loving peace and unity has long been known to every household. The superstition of regional prejudice must be clearly distinguished and carefully considered. The limbs of the body are originally one, and the country and the local are originally related to each other. At this time of peace and danger, governance and chaos, we all have the heart of Ning Ren to stop the matter. This conference hereby expresses its infinite hope to our beloved Cantonese compatriots. We deeply believe that our beloved Cantonese compatriots have a closer view and must be true to the truth. For the actions of a few unscrupulous soldiers in destroying peace and disrupting discipline, there is no need for this conference to urge them, and they will be able to rise up in justice, protect the central government, and use their steadfast spirit to quell the chaos with a wave of their hand. Looking at the sea and the sky from afar, we cannot express our concern. (Sixteenth Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang's Banquet for Representatives</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Speech at the Banquet</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang hosted a banquet for the representatives of the National Assembly at the Lichi Society at 6:00 PM on the 16th. Central Committee members Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, He Yingqin, Wang Zhengting, as well as Panchen Lama, Ma Fuxiang, and Chen Shaokuan, etc., entered the banquet at 6:30 PM. First, Li Songquan performed magic, and then Mrs. Diao Minqian sang a solo. Halfway through the banquet, Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech, saying that the National Assembly was the first in the history of the Republic of China. Now that the representatives have completed their responsibilities, they can not only comfort the people of the country, but also comfort the Premier's spirit in heaven. Before the meeting, the representatives had accepted the Premier's legacy and had also sworn an oath in front of the Premier's tomb. Although many of the representatives are not members of the party, they can be said to be followers of the Premier after these two expressions. It is hoped that you will still join our party so that we can work together. Furthermore, the Kuomintang is a combination of the people of the whole country, not a special political party. Now that the representatives elected by the people of the whole country have accepted the Premier's legacy, it can be said that the people of the whole country have joined. After you join the Kuomintang, you must know that it is not just about hanging a false name. It is about abiding by the party's discipline, following the Premier's legacy, realizing the Three Principles of the People, and completing the National Revolution. After the National Assembly closes tomorrow, if you can meet with us more before leaving Nanjing and tell us about the situation in various places, we will be very grateful. Now, with the utmost sincerity, I respectfully wish you good health with a glass of water. Then, Yang Daguang, a representative from Liaoning, gave a speech. Finally, the revolutionary epic film "The Revolution in Marseilles" was shown, and the banquet ended at 11:00 PM. (Sixteenth Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Contents of Important Proposals</h3>
<p>Proposal to Return National Private Enterprises</p>
<p>(Nanjing) National Assembly representatives Sun Shihua and 51 others proposed the proposal to return national private enterprises, with the following reasons: The property of the people shall not be sealed or confiscated unless in accordance with the law. This is the established practice of a country ruled by law, and it is also stated in the draft provisional constitution. Moreover, our country's industry and commerce are still in their infancy and should be protected and encouraged in order to develop the national economy. However, in recent years, the government has often confiscated private enterprises, such as Zhenhua Power Plant in Qishuyan, Jiangsu, Pulin Electric Light Company in Henan, and Dayou Electric Plant in Changxing Coal Mine, Zhejiang. People are anxious and industry and commerce are hesitant. The sixth item in the political renovation plan of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year states that enterprises with monopolistic characteristics and enterprises that cannot be operated by private individuals shall be operated by state capital. This is indeed clearly stipulated in our party's political program. However, today, when the economy has not yet developed and construction is just beginning, state-owned enterprises have no concrete scale, and private industries should be encouraged and given appropriate protection. However, the government often misunderstands the essence of the political program, does not distinguish between the importance of relationships, and disregards the feelings of the people, and often considers it a good idea to take back private enterprises. What is particularly criticized by the general public is the recovery of small private electrical businesses and the confiscation of private mines that have just begun to sprout. This has made the people fearful and suspicious that the government is using its power to compete with the people for profits. For industrial and commercial enterprises, they have all warned each other not to invest. This has driven capital out of the industry, made the national economy increasingly depressed, and helped international aggression. It is unclear about the essentials of politics and is almost cumbersome. The above proposal was passed by the Fifth General Assembly. The main text states that the scope of powers for the management and operation of state-owned enterprises should be clearly defined so that private enterprises can be protected. State-owned enterprises should be established and operated purely with state capital, and the boundaries should be clearly defined so that there is no room for misunderstanding. However, the central government's decision has been made for a long time, and the government has only returned the Pulin Electric Light Company in Henan, leaving the people still in a state of anxiety and shock, which is not the phenomenon that a country ruled by law should have. The method is to request the government to quickly return the confiscated national private enterprises, such as Zhenhua Power Plant in Qishuyan, Jiangsu, Changxing Coal Mine in Zhejiang, Dayou Electric Plant, etc., so that private property can be protected and people can be at ease. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision at the General Assembly. (Sixteenth Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Please Negotiate to Abolish Harsh American Regulations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) National Assembly overseas Chinese representatives Huang Boyao and Zheng Zhannan proposed that the National Assembly send a letter to the National Government to negotiate with the United States that when the children of Chinese merchants enter the country, they can enjoy the freedom of merchants entering and leaving the United States as stipulated in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty after reaching adulthood. In the past, the children of our country's merchants were allowed to enter the United States with passports and permanently enjoyed the freedom of merchants entering and leaving the United States as stipulated in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty. However, since July 1, 1924, when the US government promulgated and implemented the new immigration law, it stipulates that when they reach the age of 20, the freedom of merchants entering and leaving the United States as stipulated in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is not only completely deprived, but also after they reach adulthood, managing their father's business or operating their own business, they cannot obtain the qualifications of a merchant and enjoy the right to enter and leave the United States. The severity of the immigration law is to make our country's merchants disappear in the United States. There is nothing more unjust than this. Therefore, it is specially proposed to send a letter to the National Government to quickly negotiate with the US government to abolish this harsh regulation implemented on July 1, 1924, and restore the freedom of the children of our country's merchants to enter the country and still be able to enjoy the freedom of merchants entering and leaving the United States as stipulated in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty after reaching adulthood. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision. (Sixteenth Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Request to Enact a Stamp Tax Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Xiaochuan and others propose enacting a stamp tax law.  They state that stamp tax is considered a good tax in various countries, both East and West.  While its collection scope is broad, the levy is minimal, and its established regulations are clear and consistent, avoiding frequent changes.  Therefore, the tax law is implemented smoothly without obstruction, and the people live in peace without disturbance.  In our country, since August of the 16th year of the Republic [1927], the Central Political Council deliberated and approved the "Provisional Regulations for Stamp Tax," drafted by the Ministry of Finance.  In November of the same year, the Ministry of Finance announced its implementation.  However, a regulation labeled as "provisional" implies that it still requires formal provisions.  Yet, over three years have passed without any formal regulations drafted by the Ministry of Finance being submitted to the Central Political Council for decision on principles, or to the Legislative Yuan for content review, so that it can be formally established.  During these three years, the Ministry of Finance has frequently supplemented the regulations approved by the Central Political Council, implementing these supplements through ministerial orders.  It is no wonder that officials only focus on maximizing revenue, leaving merchants with nowhere to turn, and turning a good tax into a nearly evil one.  They propose suggesting that the government submit the "Provisional Regulations for Stamp Tax" drafted by the Ministry of Finance in the 16th year of the Republic to the Legislative Yuan for review and enactment of a stamp tax law.  Those aspects of the provisional regulations that are excessively detailed or repetitive should be deleted.  For example, invoices are merely a type of notification from merchants, yet they are hastily deemed receipts.  Recently, even shipping letters must be stamped, which is far-fetched and meaningless.  Also, for items like pawn tickets, due to the recent soaring prices of goods, the amount pawned for a padded coat or quilt by the poor often exceeds four yuan.  Since they are already pawning items due to poverty, why further burden them with stamp tax?  Repetitive taxes include various license fees for tobacco and alcohol and fees for brokerage.  Licenses and brokerage fees already serve as proof of tax payment.  Therefore, there is a certificate because taxes are paid, and then taxes are paid because there is a certificate.  As for the stipulated penalties, even minor oversights, such as a missing stamp or failure to fully stamp and seal, are punished with fines ranging from one hundred to ten yuan.  Insufficient stamping is also penalized with fifty to five yuan per item.  For example, a missing one-cent stamp on a shipping invoice is penalized with one hundred yuan, a tenfold increase.  Or a one-cent shortfall is penalized with fifty yuan, a fivefold increase.  Such penalties are rarely heard of, both domestically and internationally.  Those aspects not included in the provisional regulations but expanded and added over time should be exempted.  For example, tax tickets from old tax offices and customs checkpoints must all be stamped, with Jiangxi imposing the heaviest rate of three percent.  Jiangsu province also imposes varying rates of two, four, and one-tenth of a cent.  If the new tax is implemented in the future, there will inevitably be widespread imitation, which the people cannot bear.  When the people pay taxes to the government, the government provides a proof of remittance.  How can this be compared to a merchant's receipt of silver?  If this example is not eliminated, even grain merchants and tenant farmers will be required to stamp.  Furthermore, membership certificates for trade associations and guilds are currently being notified by various stamp tax bureaus to be stamped.  It is unclear whether the regulations stipulate that personnel credentials each have special ineffectiveness.  For example, a doctor's license proves medical competence, and a graduation certificate demonstrates academic progress.  Trade association and guild memberships merely serve as a sign of recognition for joining the association.  Forcing them to be stamped is completely unreasonable.  The above are just a few prominent examples.  The Ministry of Finance uses orders to supplement the law, and this is not limited to these instances.  What is particularly alarming is that while the country is now unified, stamp tax tickets alone cannot be used in different counties. The restrictions are extremely strict.  The tax system is flawed and urgently needs reform.  It is especially necessary to request the government to instruct the Ministry of Finance to order the stamp tax bureaus to assess the prosperity of local commerce in each county and adjust the tax quotas accordingly, without setting an increase as the precondition, lest street-level sales occur, which harms the government's image, and excessive demands and harsh punishments disturb the people.  Whether the implementation of a good tax stems from good legislation is appropriate for public decision.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Abolish Coastal Export Tax</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Xiaochuan and others propose that the coastal export tax should be abolished immediately. The export tax from one port to another is a type of domestic transit tax. In July of the 16th year of the Republic [1927], the National Government planned to eliminate it along with the likin tax.  It was stipulated within the regulations for abolishing domestic border taxes that it should be implemented on September 1st of the same year.  However, due to sudden military emergencies and financial difficulties, and to reclaim tariff rights, a gradual approach through negotiation was adopted, and it was not implemented as scheduled.  Now that tariff autonomy has been implemented and all likin and other transit taxes have been abolished, this coastal export tax should naturally be abolished immediately.  However, it has been delayed, causing deep regret among merchants and citizens.  This tax is entirely domestic in nature and unrelated to national border tariffs. However, in 1860, the Qing government's treaties with England and France regarding the Tianjin Agreement and trade regulations included provisions for inland transit duties and coastal taxes. This led to the loss of domestic taxation rights to foreigners and subjected us to unilateral agreements.  Foreigners wanted to protect their coastal trade and succeeded, while China believed that this would not affect regular customs revenue and could supplement financial income, but failed to recognize the loss of national sovereignty and the hindrance to industry. The imbalance and unfairness were greater than that of the likin tax. Now that the likin tax has been abolished, domestic products can flow freely, benefiting from mutual adjustment. However, goods transported from customs locations still bear this unfair transit tax. For example, silk sent from inland areas to Danyang via the post office is tax-free, but if sent to Zhenjiang, a 5% ad valorem tax is required. Silk and satin produced in Jiangsu are tax-free when sent to the inland areas via the post office, but Nanjing and Zhenjiang, being customs locations, must pay the coastal tax. Others who need to pass through customs locations due to inconvenient inland transportation do not need to pay this tax. For example, the native cloth of southern provinces in the current unified tax system must be taxed when transported to the Northeast and coarse grains transported to Fujian and Guangdong must also be taxed. Coal needed in Jiangsu is tax-free when transported by the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, but taxed if transported by ships. From a local perspective, the burden falls exclusively on places where customs are established, which seems unfair. From a broader perspective, inconvenient domestic transportation means that bulk commercial goods must be transported by ships through customs, and are all subject to this burden. This is out of step with global trends and hinders the development of national industry and business. In order to thoroughly abolish the likin tax, promote national economic development, it is appropriate to immediately abolish the coastal export tax. Whether this is appropriate is submitted for public decision.</p>
<h3>Resolution on Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>(Continued from Yesterday)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Fifth, the people in the bandit suppression areas must cooperate with the county government in implementing the Baojia system, clearing the countryside, and other auxiliary bandit suppression and post-disaster affairs. Suppressing the Red bandits requires not only the national army's advance but also the people's assistance. Whether or not the assistance is effective depends entirely on whether the people themselves have a strong organization. County autonomy is a necessary organization for local people. However, in the bandit-affected areas, before county autonomy can be prepared according to law, the government must give the people of each county the strength, guarantee, and assistance to carry out the Baojia system and organize self-defense. Only in this way can the people's own strength be established, and then they can use their own strength to assist the government in suppressing the bandits. Once the organization of the Baojia and self-defense strength is established, the people should cooperate with the national army. When the national army advances to suppress the Red bandits, they should secretly investigate the bandits, report on bandit traces, manage transportation, and engage in propaganda. When clearing the countryside in their respective counties, they should investigate bandit criminals and cut off their traces, leaving no one at large. After the bandits are cleared, they should cooperate with the government to handle the recruitment of refugees, relief to the injured, restoration of order, and other post-disaster matters. The government must promote, encourage, and protect the people in carrying out these tasks, and the people must, under the government's encouragement and protection, strive to fulfill their responsibilities. Then the suppression of the Red bandits will surely achieve rapid results. Therefore, in the future, cooperation between the people and the government to eliminate the bandit scourge must take the organization of the people's own strength as the primary task. The people across the country should provide cooperation and support to the government. As for the people's hopes for the government, they can be divided into two aspects: fundamental and superficial. The cause of the Red bandits arises externally from the incitement of Red imperialism and internally from the exhaustion of the people's livelihoods, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, in suppressing the Red bandits, in terms of fundamental solutions, the government must strive for material construction to open up avenues for national livelihood and prosperity. At the same time, it must consolidate national unity and peace, and rectify the official governance and administration of the provinces to eliminate opportunities for bandits to incite chaos. Once internal governance is on the right track, the national economy and political power can be used to strengthen national defense and foster good relations with foreign countries. Not only will the Red bandits inevitably disappear due to the severance of internal and external resources, but the country can also achieve long-term stability. This fundamental solution does not require further elaboration. As for what the current congress hopes from the government, in terms of superficial solutions, it hopes that the government will enforce strict rewards and punishments for the bandit suppression army, and replenish their supplies and equipment so that bandit suppression can be more effective. Secondly, it hopes that the government will provide as much relief as possible to the disaster-stricken people in the bandit areas so that they can be properly settled, resume cultivation, and eliminate the source of incitement. The various unified measures and regulations needed for the people across the country to assist the government in suppressing the Red bandits should also be promptly planned and formulated by the government. It is deeply hoped that the entire country, from top to bottom, will, in accordance with the resolution of this case, pool their wisdom and efforts to eliminate this major disaster for the future of the Chinese nation in the shortest possible time. Once this disaster is eliminated, the country's peace and unity will be more complete, and the order and tranquility of society will be more firmly established without fear of disruption. Only then will all the constructions of the Three People's Principles proceed smoothly.</p>

<h3>Yu Xuezhong and Others Telegraph Support for Peaceful Unification</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The generals of North China telegraphed on the 16th, "Having recently read Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs' sincere telegram and Chairman Long of Yunnan's sincere telegram, we are deeply moved by their patriotism and dedication to the Party, their thorough and earnest advice, and their public and private considerations. Their voices have reached far, and we admire them greatly. Since the founding of the Republic, numerous disasters and disturbances have plagued the nation, the lives of the people have become unbearable, livelihoods have been devastated and without remedy, and political reform has been difficult to achieve. In recent years, the entire nation, feeling the pressure of the environment, has awakened and realized that our country cannot achieve peace without unification, and cannot achieve construction without peace. Therefore, the people are united in their pursuit of unification and peace. Recently, in accordance with the will of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, the National Assembly was held. From preparation to opening, it took only a few months, yet it was able to gather the public opinion of the entire nation and establish the fundamental laws of the Party and the country, thereby realizing the Premier's lifelong aspirations. This alone proves the determination of our entire nation to demand unification, peace, and tutelage. Just as we were expecting the National Assembly to be completed and the fundamental laws to be established, to abolish unequal treaties externally, to establish the spirit of national independence, and to implement the Three People's Principles internally, to show the path of national construction, the shocking news of the Guangdong incident arrived less than ten days after the opening. Although it is a local issue and does not affect national security, the rampant rumors inevitably confuse people's perceptions. This is truly contrary to the expectations of our entire nation and cannot but be considered a regret for the future of the Party and the country. The difficulties facing our country today are far greater than in the past. Imperialism watches from outside, and communist insurgents plot from within. Even the slightest carelessness in prevention may lead to endless troubles. Now that national unification and peace have been achieved, and the country has entered the period of tutelage from the period of military and political rule, our entire nation should work together with a unified and solid spirit to build various undertakings, directly seeking the security of the Party and the country, and indirectly creating the welfare of the entire people. During this period, whoever maintains the unification and peace of our Party and country, whether domestic or foreign, is a friend, and whoever opposes it is an enemy. Indeed, our entire nation has suffered from disasters for too long, and has longed for peace for too long. We cannot tolerate the unification and peace that we have worked so hard to achieve being disrupted and causing disputes. If, unfortunately, a strong neighbor takes advantage of this and the communists take the opportunity to invite wolves into the house, the regrets will be too late. If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? This is something that no true patriot would allow to happen. The Guangdong incident is nothing more than an excuse based on the personal issue of Hu Hanmin. However, Hu Hanmin is a member of the Party, and the advancement or retreat of a Party member should be based on the consensus of the entire Party. The Party member should absolutely obey the consensus, which cannot be determined by any individual, let alone controlled by any individual. As Party members, how can we cling to our own opinions, indulge in personal feelings, disregard the interests of the Party and the country, and involve military actions? Xuezhong and others deeply cherish peace, it is in our nature, and we dare not lag behind in supporting the Party and the country. We earnestly express our sincere thoughts and offer our direct opinions, hoping that everyone will agree on the main points and jointly maintain the national affairs. Faced with this telegram, we cannot help but feel the utmost urgency to await orders. Yu Xuezhong, Wang Shuchang, Liu Yifei, Li Peiji, Shi Yousan, Song Zheyuan, Sun Kuiyuan, and Pang Bingxun respectfully kowtow."</p>
<h3>Shanxi Generals' Advice to Chen Jitang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shanxi generals Shang Zhen and others telegraphed regarding the current situation, "We recently sent a telegram to General Commander Chen of Guangdong, saying: 'General Commander Chen of Guangdong, Brother Bonan, unification has just been achieved, and the country is still facing many difficulties. We who have received the important responsibility of the Party and the country should cooperate with each other and work together to plan and assist, focusing on internal construction and striving to reclaim national rights. How can we allow personal grievances to shake the foundation of the country? However, after Comrade Deng and others sent a telegram, you suddenly responded with the Jiang telegram, which we were deeply surprised to read. Today, the implementation of tutelage is the unanimous desire of the people. Anyone who violates the right path is the public enemy of the country. Brother, as an advanced member of our Party, should protect the Party and the country no less than anyone else, and should especially distinguish between right and wrong and benefits and harms. To indulge in personal feelings and destroy one's past achievements is something that the wise would not do. Moreover, looking at the past, those warlords who resisted the central government all ended in ruin. Today, there is absolutely no room for those who hold onto their troops and resist. Since your Jiang telegram was published, the provinces of Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi have been sending messages of reproach in the name of justice. The direction of the people's hearts is already clear. Moreover, the Red bandits have not been eliminated, and the suppression is urgent. We soldiers should uphold the spirit of public loyalty and serving the country, support the central government, and eliminate the people's suffering together. If you stubbornly persist in your error and go your own way, as a revolutionary soldier, you will be betraying the revolution, obstructing peace, and creating opportunities for the communists. This is not only cutting yourself off from the Party and the country, but also causing the revolutionary base that has just been established to suffer devastation again, causing the millions of people who are just recovering to suffer from war again, and causing the Party and the country that have been painstakingly built over the years to face internal strife again. How will you console the souls of the late Premier and the martyrs in heaven, and how will you live up to the hopes of the 400 million compatriots for peace? Being a sinner of the Party and the country, a troublemaker who destroys unity, and a instigator of chaos, even death would not atone for your crimes. Brother, being wise and discerning, would you dare to do this? We urgently hope that you will abandon personal grievances, consider the overall situation, awaken as soon as possible, and not fall into the wrong path. We brothers, to support the Party and the country and to cherish our comrades, cannot help but speak our minds. Your good or bad fortune rests on a single thought. If you do not wake up quickly and recklessly commit such an unrighteous act, we comrades-in-arms will rise up together to fight the common enemy. Being targeted by everyone, there will be no hope of escaping. If it comes to this, even those who love you will be helpless. Where to go and what to do, we hope you will consider carefully.' Signed by Shang Zhen, Chairman of Shanxi Provincial Government and Commander of the 4th Army, Xu Yongchang, Commander of the 5th Army, Yang Aiyuan, Commander of the 6th Army, Fu Zuoyi, Commander of the 7th Army, Sun Chu, Commander of the Zhengtai Railway Protection, Rong Honglu, Commander of the Taiyuan Garrison, Zhou Dai, Artillery Supervisor of the Army, Zhao Chengzhou, Commander of the Yanbei Bandit Suppression, etc. We only hope that the people of the country will unanimously support the central government and uphold justice to quell the turmoil. It will be the blessing of the Party and the country." Signed by Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Fu Zuoyi, Sun Chu, Rong Honglu, Zhou Dai, and Zhao Chengzhou.

<h3>Pan-European Conference Opens</h3>
<p>Russian Delegation Arrives in Geneva</p>
<p>German-Polish Dispute: Germany Wins</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 15th – The Pan-European Conference opened today with an opening address by French Foreign Minister Briand. Briand appeared very dispirited due to the unfortunate blow of the presidential election and lacked his previous vigor. Even his opening address was unremarkable. Briand merely stated that a recent proposal to organize international agricultural loans would open a new outlet for economic pressure in Europe. However, the most important item on the agenda of this conference is Germany's proposal to examine the customs policies of various European countries in order to solve Europe's economic difficulties. At this point in Briand's speech, British Foreign Secretary Henderson suddenly stood up and said that he had a personal thought that he wished to share with the chairman. Henderson then said that he was very pleased to see Briand still in the position of chairman of the international conference today. Briand is not only the greatest politician in France, but also a great politician in the world. The representatives of all countries have always admired him and he is truly worthy of being an elder statesman in the League of Nations. Briand smiled and humbly thanked him at this point, which was Briand's first smile since arriving in Geneva. Briand concluded by saying that the work in Geneva should overshadow all minor irritations and difficulties, and that if the representatives of the countries could trust him as Mr. Henderson did, then he hoped that the representatives of the countries would cooperate with him sincerely.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 16th – This morning, German Foreign Minister Curtius told the committee discussing the issue of a European Federation that the division of Europe into many new countries is the main cause of economic misfortune. The way to remedy this is for the countries to conclude a customs union. French Foreign Minister Briand abruptly mentioned the German-Austrian customs union in his reply, saying, "We must avoid everything that could arouse European resistance, anxiety, and harm." Briand strongly disagreed with the view that economic misfortune was caused by customs barriers, saying that high tax rates were caused by economic misfortune, not causing economic misfortune. The committee was greatly shaken by the two foreign ministers' opinions being so strongly in conflict. Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov paid particular attention.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 15th – The Russian delegation arrived here this afternoon, led by Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov. The Russian delegation is currently staying at the Metropole Hotel, which was originally the residence of the German and Japanese delegations. The Russian delegation has now abandoned its former residence and moved into the Metropole Hotel, so there is much speculation outside.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 15th – The International Court of Justice today publicly ruled on the German-Polish case regarding German schools in Poland, completely following Germany's demands. Eleven people favored Germany, and only one person favored Poland, namely the Polish representative. This matter is very important and other nationalities in Poland and elsewhere will surely welcome it, as it proves that it is not only the League of Nations that protects the rights of minorities.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 15th – Today, the International Secretariat announced the exchange of documents between the British, French, and German governments regarding the case of Britain and Germany previously requesting countries to publish the actual state of their armaments before the disarmament conference. Among them, the British government, in response to the German government's request, asked whether it was a countermeasure to the British government's request. The German government's reply was that the principles of the British government's request and the one put forward by the German government were the same and the trends were consistent, but the German proposal was more in line with the resolutions of the League of Nations Council, and the British proposal was not as complete as the German proposal. On the other hand, the French government expressed doubts about whether it could obtain realistic reports on armaments from the countries concerned before the opening of the International Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 15th – Today, British Foreign Secretary Henderson invited the foreign ministers of Germany, France, and Italy to discuss the issues in the League of Nations Council meeting, and especially had in-depth discussions on the German-Austrian tax agreement and the preparations for next year's disarmament conference.</p>
<h3>International Silver Price Conference</h3>
<p>The United States is Prepared to Send Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>Japan Has No Intention of Initiating a Convocation</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th – Chinese Minister to the United States, Dr. Wu, has notified Deputy Secretary of State Castle that the Chinese government is now carefully considering issuing a request to convene an international silver conference soon. Castle today officially released the first statement by the US government regarding its attitude toward the silver conference, stating that the United States is prepared to participate in the international silver conference, but the US government does not have as direct a relationship to this issue as other countries, so it is best for this conference to be convened by another country.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th – The New York Times today carried a dispatch from Washington stating that the US government feels that the Chinese government's convocation of an international silver conference cannot move people. Although the US government is prepared to cooperate with China, it would rather have another government initiate this conference. If Japan is the initiator, the United States will surely give a sympathetic response. The Japanese Ambassador to the United States has notified the US government that the Japanese government is now considering the issue of issuing a request to open an international silver conference. It is reported that the government's consent to consider is the result of the investigation by the Japanese representatives of the International Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th – Personnel from the Ministry of Finance and important figures in business circles held a meeting today to continue discussing the issue of an international silver conference. It has been informally decided that Japan should not initiate this conference because the success or failure of this conference is extremely doubtful. The general opinion is that after the Japanese government considers this matter, it will notify the US government of its intention not to convene a silver conference.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – Japanese Minister of Finance Inoue discussed with important figures in the banking world today the proposal to convene an international silver conference in Tokyo. At present, the Japanese economic world believes that because the UK is selling silver from India, it does not want to convene this conference urgently. The United States is also worried that it will involve war debts and is unwilling to act as the initiator. China is a silver standard country and seems to be unsuitable in terms of location. Japan, on the other hand, is a gold standard country and does not produce silver, so it is more suitable for convening this kind of conference. Therefore, it is believed that Tokyo is a suitable location for the conference, but before convening, the procedures to be discussed in the conference should be prepared in advance, which cannot be completed in a short time. Therefore, it is advocated to first organize a committee to conduct research and then take formal action.</p>
<p>Reuters, Mexico City, 15th – In order to prevent fluctuations in silver coins, Mexico will import a large number of American gold coins and circulate them among the people. Today, bankers held a meeting here, and their opinions were all that the public needs gold coins, and they decided to organize a banking group to manage foreign exchange and prevent speculators from suppressing silver prices. The Ministry of Finance stated that the free exchange of cash between Mexico and other countries will be realized soon. Currently, merchants in several places are telegraphing the government to find ways to alleviate the crisis, because business has now almost completely stopped.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 15th – Darling, the manager of the British Midland Bank, today proposed to the Canadian House of Commons Banking and Commerce Committee to establish a supreme bank in the British Empire to consolidate the British Empire's bimetallic monetary system. Darling said that the British Empire should be at the forefront of the world movement in order to solve international monetary issues and stabilize the price of silver against gold. This kind of supreme bank will surely establish a permanent balance in the price of gold and silver. Canadian Prime Minister Bennett has met with Darling several times, and it is likely that the issue of stabilizing the bimetallic monetary system will be raised by Canada and become one of the most important items on the agenda of the British Empire Economic Conference in August.</p>
<h3>Irwin's Speech on India</h3>
<p>Said Indians Cannot Be Subdued by Force</p>
<p>Development of Commerce Requires Political Adjustment</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – Former Indian Governor Irwin said in a speech to the Anglo-Indian Association today that he knew that some people held the view that if the government were a strong government, the Indian turmoil would not occur and everything would pass peacefully. It should be known that this kind of view is completely wrong. Even if this kind of government can get the support of public opinion today and implement policies of a cruel nature forever, the apparent tranquility it obtains is the tranquility of tragic submission, not the peace of mutual consent. The imperial ideas of the Victorian era have now passed, and have been replaced by new ideas of harmonious imperial relations. The world has long been familiar with the new ideas in the relationship between the British Empire and overseas autonomous regions, so the development of Indian ideas is also natural and inevitable. As for the rejection of British goods, he had spoken to Gandhi about it when he left Bombay, and Gandhi had made a very real promise about this. There are three things that the British people cannot but know now: one is that the economic development of India will eventually strengthen its purchasing power in all aspects; two is that after the tense atmosphere in the political situation is cleared, the expansion of India's demand will last for a long time and cannot be supplied by India itself, and British manufacturing will have good opportunities here; and three is that commerce must be based on good intentions, and the British business community should pay attention to the political adjustment of Anglo-Indian relations, so that its commercial activities are not disturbed by political ups and downs. Irwin also said that he believed that if Gandhi came to London, he would do his best to seek a compromise.</p>
<h3>Roman Pope Denounces Capitalism</h3>
<p>Concentrates Economic Power</p>
<p>Brewing Despotic Behavior</p>
<p>The Only Remedy Lies in Believing in Religious Social Philosophy</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 15th – The Roman Pope's encyclical on social and labor issues has now been published, opposing selfish industrialism and communism, pointing out that these are harmful fallacies, saying that a system must be organized so that ordinary people gradually attain the appropriate comfort of the assets they are given, and various professions must cooperate faithfully to replace class struggle. It also said that the economic power of the whole world is concentrated in the hands of a few people, which brews tyrannical despotism. The only remedy is to restore the sound principles of the social philosophy of the Church and its application to labor and capital. Today, there are 80,000 men and women from 22 countries gathered in the courtyard of St. Thomas Aquinas to listen to the Pope's speech. The Pope's speech was clear and lasted for more than an hour, and he was not tired. He first spoke in Italian and then translated it into French and German.</p>
<h3>Spanish General Election</h3>
<p>Scheduled for Late June</p>
<p>More Than 100 Churches Destroyed</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Madrid, 15th – The Spanish government announced that the general election will be held on June 21 or 28, and the new parliament will be convened around July 1. There have been no more disturbances in various places today. As a result of the anti-Christian riots in recent days, a total of 105 churches and monasteries have been destroyed.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Changsha telegram - To all newspaper offices, Greetings. Having read the telegrams from Minister He, Director He, Commander-in-Chief Lu, and Zhen Rithong, loving the Party and protecting the country, suppressing bandits and saving the people, the language is strict, and the righteousness is correct. The Provincial Government has deleted a telegram sent by Hunan to Commander-in-Chief Chen in Guangzhou, which read: "I have read Jiang's telegram with understanding. The Republic of China has been established for twenty years. Times are difficult and banditry is rampant. Right and wrong are commonly seen, and the advantages and disadvantages should be weighed. Wise men cannot bear the devastation of the country, and benevolent men must punish the Communist bandits. If you are indifferent to power and the strife of emotions, you should also value the unification of the country, pity the suffering of the people, be careful of the opportunity for misfortune, be alarmed by the danger of the capsizing boat, and promote the atmosphere of great creation and harmony. The future of the Party and the country is deeply dependent. I hereby inform you, please consider it thoroughly." The Hunan Provincial Government respectfully deletes it.</p>

In the center of the field, three decorated platforms were erected, the central one being the main platform, with viewing platforms on either side. All platforms were covered with colorful cloth. On either side of the platforms were rest rooms. On the viewing platforms, seats were arranged in three tiers, with over four hundred seats for spectators. At the top of the main platform, a broadcasting system was installed for speeches.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Details of the Military Parade: The elite troops of the Guard Division, led by Commander Feng Yi-pei, riding a horse and carrying a saber, arrived in front of the reviewing stand and reported the number of troops and their readiness. The military parade then commenced. The Commander-in-Chief's Adjutant, Wang Shi-he, led the way with the command flag. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, riding a black horse, advanced at a measured pace, followed by Zhang Xueliang, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Chen Yi, Cao Haosen, He Yaozu, Zhang Zhijiang, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Diaoyuan, and others, each carrying a flag. They circled the field once for inspection and then returned to the platform, where the march-past began. The troops were divided into several columns, starting with the infantry, followed by hand-carried machine gun teams and ammunition pack horses, totaling four regiments. Next came the field artillery, mortar teams, and part of the transportation corps. This was followed by the 1st Cavalry Regiment, and finally, twenty-four tank platoons.</p>
<p>Speeches by Chiang and Zhang: Commander-in-Chief Chiang's speech briefly stated: "The late Premier's last will advocated convening a National Assembly and abolishing unequal treaties. It has now been seven years since the Premier passed away. Relying on the spirits of the Premier and the martyrs in heaven, as well as the efforts of all officers, soldiers, and the people of the entire nation, we have single-mindedly engaged in military revolution to establish a foundation for peaceful unification.

I hope that all our officers and soldiers will continue to work hard in accordance with the resolutions passed by the National Assembly to advance unification and construction and abolish the unequal treaties, to console the spirits of the Premier and the martyrs, and to live up to the expectations of the people of the entire nation." Then Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang spoke, briefly stating that the military force of the revolutionary army is the military force of the people. Today, the representatives of the entire people are here to observe, which means we are presenting our military force to the people, a truly gratifying moment. In China's current situation, without military force, there can be no peace, unification, or construction, and we cannot achieve the goal of abolishing unequal treaties.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Shanxi After Shang Zhen's Trip to Peiping</h3>
<p>All Parties Eagerly Await His Early Return</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: After Shang Zhen's trip to Peiping, he has not yet returned to Taiyuan, and the local military and political affairs have fallen into a state of virtual stagnation. Military salaries in various regions are still being levied locally by the counties. Although there were rumors that Song, Pang, Sun, and other units had received allocations from the Deputy Department, in reality, there has been no substantial assistance. The counties are finding it extremely difficult to raise funds, while the military levies are becoming more frequent and urgent. Representatives from various counties are currently gathered in Taiyuan, but without Shang's return, there is no solution. Regarding the provincial currency lottery, it is already overdue by several days. The provincial government has requested instructions from Shang twice, but there has been no response. As a result, the credit of the provincial currency has plummeted again. Recently, the exchange rate of the provincial currency had broken through the three-yuan mark and was showing a rising trend. However, due to the lottery not being held on schedule, rumors are rampant in society, and the value is declining daily, having fallen from two yuan eighty-nine fen. The stationed troops in various parts of southern Shanxi are currently calm, but incidents of robbery are increasing daily. All parties have high expectations for Shang's trip. The future of Shanxi's situation will depend on whether Shang can find a solution during this trip, and there is a strong hope for his early return to take charge. (12th)</p>
<p>The National Government Held a Grand Military Parade</p>
<p>The various officers and soldiers were well-trained and full of spirit, which was very gratifying to observe. It is hoped that they will continue their efforts to complete the National Revolution, uphold unification and construction, and abolish unequal treaties, to fulfill their duties as citizens." Next, Tian Yi'an, a representative from Shaanxi to the National Assembly, spoke. At 11:30 AM, the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>On the Parade Platform: (1) Chiang Kai-shek (2) Feng Yi-pei (3) Panchen Lama (4) Zhang Xueliang (5) Chen Diaoyuan (6) Qian Dajun</p>
<h3>He Jian Reorganizes Various Armies in Western Hunan</h3>
<p>Chen Quchan Sternly Admonished</p>
<p>Dai Huihuan Officially Dismissed</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Although the military forces in Hunan are nominally under the command and deployment of He Jian, in reality, the various units in western Hunan have not strictly followed provincial orders. During He Jian's recent visit to Beijing, he reported the situation in western Hunan to Commander-in-Chief Chiang in detail and strongly requested reorganization. Chen Quchan, stationed in western Hunan, has been in charge of military and political affairs and Miao defense affairs in western Hunan since succeeding Tian Yingzhao in 1920, for more than ten years. Chen has weathered many political storms and has held sway over ten counties including Yongshun, Baojing, Longshan, Sangzhi, Fenghuang, Qianyang, Sui Ning, Huangxian, Gumashan, etc. The provincial authorities, finding it beyond their reach, have had to tolerate him. In recent years, Chen's power has grown, and he was appointed by the central government as the commander of the newly organized 34th Division and concurrently as the commander of the 1st Hunan Garrison Army, under the command of the 4th Route Army. The provincial government then considered transferring him out for reorganization to unify western Hunan. Chen did not comply and instead set up numerous checkpoints within his defense zone, levying taxes on goods in transit, protection fees, and taxes on opium seedlings. In addition to the regular troops, he also recruited bandits from western Hunan and established various security corps and Miao defense teams, using various names. Military expenses were levied locally. During He Jian's recent visit to Beijing, he reported all of Chen Quchan's activities to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Subsequently, he received orders to reorganize Chen's forces. Yesterday, He Jian, in his capacity as the Commander-in-Chief of the 4th Route Army, sent a telegram to the province, issuing a notice stating: "Received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang stating that, after investigation, Chen Quchan, commander of the newly organized 34th Division, stationed in western Hunan, due to obstructed communication and misunderstanding of the overall situation, has sometimes misunderstood the deployments of the 4th Route Army. His units have many miscellaneous titles that do not conform to the organization. The numerous checkpoints within his defense zone are particularly inconsistent with the national goal of abolishing likin. He should be clearly admonished to rectify his conduct. In the future, the division commander must strictly follow the command and control of Commander-in-Chief He in military matters. All miscellaneous titles should be strictly abolished to unify the organization. Regarding civil administration and financial affairs within the defense zone, he must strictly follow the political orders of the Hunan Provincial Government. All illegal checkpoints must be abolished to alleviate the people's suffering. He must not be confined to a corner and develop his own style. This is of utmost importance. In addition to directly ordering Division Commander Chen, you are to comply accordingly. Respectfully, Commander-in-Chief He."</p>
<p>Dai Huihuan's unit was also stationed in western Hunan, serving as the Commander of Bandit Suppression in Western Hunan and concurrently as the commander of the Independent 10th Brigade, commanding two brigades and four regiments. In the winter of last year, He Jian abolished the title of the Independent 10th Brigade and transferred Dai to be a counselor of the General Headquarters. All units under his command were reorganized. Dai, however, refused to comply and incited the various units to oppose He Jian. Zhang Jinwu's regiment under Chen Quchan also rose up in response, gathering in the border areas of Yuanling, Taoyuan, and Xupu. He Jian immediately dispatched Luo Shujia of the 19th Division, leading two regiments, and also telegraphed Chen Quchan and Wang Jialie of the Guizhou Army to each send a regiment to encircle and suppress them. He also took advantage of this trip to Beijing to request Commander-in-Chief Chiang to deal with Dai. Subsequently, he received Commander-in-Chief Chiang's approval to remove Dai from his position as counselor. Therefore, He Jian also telegraphed all parties yesterday, notifying them in a document stating: "Received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang stating that, after investigation, Dai Huihuan, the former commander of the Independent 10th Brigade, has already been officially transferred to serve as a counselor of this headquarters, and his units have been separately reorganized. However, it has been repeatedly reported that Dai Huihuan dared to incite his units to rebel and falsely claim that he received orders from the Commander-in-Chief to return to his original position, etc. His disregard for law and discipline has reached an extreme. Dai Huihuan is hereby dismissed from his position as counselor and will be strictly investigated and dealt with to maintain discipline. A special telegram is sent to you, hoping that you will notify all your subordinates accordingly. Respectfully, He Jian." (May 14th)</p>
<h3>The Encirclement of He Long's Troops Has Been Completed</h3>
<p>Thorough Elimination is Limited to Before the 20th</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Long's remnant bandits, previously fleeing from the Xuejiaping and Guohaping areas, have moved to various places in the Qianxi and Jianchashi areas of Yuan'an County. After being encircled and suppressed by various armies, their strength has been reduced by two-thirds. When He first fled to that area, he originally planned to cross Nanzhang and Gucheng, pass through southern Henan, and flee into Anhui to join forces with the bandit Kuang Jixun. However, Fan Shisheng's division and Wang Guangzong's brigade were deployed tightly, making it impossible to succeed. He then turned south again, attempting to secretly cross the Yangtze River via Xingshan and enter the areas of Wuhe and Yangping via Zigui, but they were also occupied by Guo Xun's brigade, and the front line connected with Wang's brigade stationed in Malingping, making it even more difficult to break through. They are currently still maneuvering on the border between Yuan'an and Nanzhang, waiting for an opportunity to move. On the government side, they are advancing from four sides. The southeast is being handled by a part of Xu Yuanquan's division, which has advanced to Yanchi and Gaoqiao. The due north is being handled by Li Zhuzhong's brigade under Fan Shisheng, which has advanced to Xiaojiayan and Leijiapo. The northwest is being handled by Zhao Guanying's division and Wang Guangzong's brigade. Zhao's division has advanced to Baokang, and Wang's brigade has advanced to Malingping. On the southwest side, it is being handled by the three regiments of Guo Xun's brigade, which have also advanced to Shuiban, northeast of Yangping. The encirclement has been completed. After receiving reports from various parties, the Wuhan Headquarters specifically ordered Xu Yuanquan, Fan Shisheng, and Zhao Guanying's three divisions, and Guo Xun and Wang Guangzong's two brigades on the 15th to continue their efforts to suppress the bandits and to completely eliminate the remaining bandits before the 20th. After receiving the orders, Xu and others immediately moved towards the bandit lairs. Guo has already made contact with the bandit forces and is coordinating with friendly forces for a second general attack, which should not be difficult to annihilate within the deadline.

<h3>The Storm Over the Issuance of Treasury Bonds in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Merchant Guilds Failed to Comply with the Order to Pay the Full Amount</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Detained Representatives</p>
<p>Various Groups Telegraphed Rebuttals to Fang Shengtao</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Security Department, in order to incorporate local armies into the provincial defense army, the provincial police, and the security team, needed a large amount of funds. Therefore, the provincial government issued 500,000 yuan in treasury bonds to provide funding. Of this, 320,000 yuan was allocated to the Fuzhou merchant guilds and 180,000 yuan to the Xiamen merchant guilds. In Xiamen, the head of the Xiamen branch treasury, Zheng Yinglin, contacted the General Chamber of Commerce. In Fuzhou, the Director of the Department of Finance, He Gonggan, recently hosted a banquet to invite the leaders of various guilds to discuss the loan subscription method, but all the guilds declined for various reasons, resulting in no results. The provincial government then ordered the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Guo Yongrong, to send police on the 9th to summon representatives of various guilds to the General Chamber of Commerce to discuss the matter, setting a deadline for paying 200,000 yuan by the 10th and the remaining 200,000 yuan by the 15th. The representatives, finding the deadline too tight and the amount too large, were unable to comply. On the evening of the 9th, they held an emergency meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce. The Department of Finance specially dispatched Commissioner Wu Changcheng, leading a team of security police, to monitor the proceedings. After discussions until dawn, the guilds were only able to raise 50,000 yuan. They reported this to Guo Yongrong by telephone. Guo was extremely dissatisfied and sent a bus to the General Chamber of Commerce, detaining all twenty-four representatives and taking them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for custody. When the guilds heard that the representatives had been detained, they held an emergency meeting on the morning of the 10th to discuss countermeasures. Guo Yongrong, hearing the news, sent more police to order the selection of two responsible persons to go to the bureau for consultation. At that time, there were fifty-two directors of various guilds present, who were willing to go together, but the police officer, finding the number too large, was unable to accommodate them and left. On the afternoon of the same day, led by the silk and cloth guild, they telegraphed the central government, the National Government, the Fujian delegation to the National Assembly, and the Fujian associations in Beijing and Shanghai, complaining about the military and police authorities forcing loans and arbitrarily detaining merchants, requesting rescue and upholding justice. However, Fang Shengtao, the Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government and concurrently the Director of the Security Department, discovered that the telegram was drafted by Chen Guang, a lawyer and legal advisor to the silk and cloth guild. On the afternoon of the 11th, he sent special agents to Chen's residence in Huangxiang Alley and took Chen to the Security Department for detention. The Lawyers Association, hearing the news, was greatly angered. On the morning of the 12th, they held a general meeting and elected the President, Wei Yifeng, and Councillor Zheng Yikang, to go to the Security Department to express their concern for Chen Guang, but they were refused a meeting. Wei and others had no choice but to return to the association and report to the members. After a general discussion, they decided to resolve the matter through legal means. The methods were as follows: 1. File a lawsuit against Fang Shengtao with the local court prosecutor's office for illegal abuse of power. 2. File a complaint with the National Government's Control Yuan against Fang for dereliction of duty and request punishment. 3. Until the case is resolved, all lawyers will suspend court appearances. The situation is currently very tense, but the police officers from the Department of Finance and the Public Security Bureau are still waiting at the General Chamber of Commerce for the payment, while some wealthy merchants, such as Luo Mianhou, Zeng Shanke, Huang Zhanhong, and You Qingkui, fearing involvement, have separately subscribed and paid. Therefore, the various merchant guilds are very dissatisfied with this. (May 13th)</p>

<p>The Water and Land Police Arrested Important Bandits: After the bandits from Lake Taihu, including Taibao Ashu, were captured and executed, the authorities spared no effort in strictly arresting their followers. Today (16th), the County Public Security Bureau received a report from Pan Yongqiang, the head of the 1st Branch Bureau of Tinglin, that they had escorted a bandit, Xu Bolang, to Songjiang, along with a confession. According to the confession, he used to be a tailor and is now the boat rocker for Taibao Ashu's second boat. When Taibao Ashu was at the height of his power, he had a total of six boats. The bandit was arrested at the Bajingyuan Tea House in Tinglin. In addition, Fan Guozhong, the captain of the 1st Team of the 1st District of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security, secretly ordered his subordinates to detect and arrest Yao Mulin (aka Yao Helin), a notorious recidivist, in the Small North Gate of the French Concession in Shanghai. He confessed to robbing in Zhangze, Hougang, Tinglin, Caojing, and other places, as well as burning houses in 1929, and recently robbing the Shen Maolin family in Tinglin of silver and clothing. Captain Fan prepared a document and handed him over to the County Government of this county, requesting that he be dealt with according to the Regulations for Clearing Villages. After County Magistrate Jin interrogated him, he immediately instructed that the bandit and the original documents be sent to the County Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and legal action.</p>

<p>A Tragedy Occurred at a Rural Festival in Xiangcheng: In this county, every year on the 28th day of the third lunar month, the birthday of the Eastern Peak Emperor, villages and towns would hold festivals and plays. On the 15th, which happened to be the 28th day of the third lunar month, the Eastern Peak Temple in Xiangcheng Town outside Loumen held a religious festival. Villagers from Tangjiabang and Huangniliang, located one or two miles from the town, gathered to participate in the procession. Villagers from Huangniliang placed the statue of the deity on a boat and sailed to Tangjiabang, which was discovered by the villagers of Tangjiabang, who, fearing that Huangniliang would take the lead, gathered and intercepted the Huangniliang boat. At that time, the villagers of Huangniliang, outnumbered, abandoned the boat and returned to their village, where they gathered more people and returned to Tangjiabang to negotiate. The villagers of Tangjiabang, seeing the menacing approach, sent someone to the town to report to the security team and the merchant militia, saying that a large gang of bandits had arrived in the village, intending to rob them. Upon hearing the news, the security team and merchant militia members immediately rushed to Tangjiabang in different directions, preparing to arrest them. The villagers of Huangniliang explained the situation, but the villagers of Tangjiabang, seeing that the security team and militia members had arrived, beat the villagers of Huangniliang, and a large-scale armed fight broke out between the two sides. The security team and the merchant militia members opened fire to warn them and stepped forward to suppress the riot, but one bullet hit a Mr. Xi, piercing his chest. He fell to the ground and died on the spot. The shooter, realizing that he had caused trouble, threw a quick-firing pistol into the river and fled in panic. The villagers of Huangniliang chased down a suspect wearing a yellow uniform and reported to the 7th District Office. The assistant of the district, knowing that District Chief Zhou Zhaolin was in the city, hired a boat to come to the city and inform District Chief Zhou. District Chief Zhou went to the county and reported to County Magistrate Huang, requesting a review and handling of the matter. County Magistrate Huang, realizing that the incident involved a public official committing homicide, immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to send officers to thoroughly investigate the truth and requested the County Court Prosecutor's Office to send officers to examine the deceased to provide a basis for review.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Appeals Murder Case: Chao Zhangshi, the daughter-in-law of Chao Zhengshi, a villager in Wanxuizhen, Changzhou, had an affair with Yang Jinde, a neighboring villager. Chao Zhengshi found out and scolded his daughter-in-law. Yang Jinde harbored deep resentment. On the evening of January 14th of last year, taking advantage of Chao Zhengshi's absence, he murdered Chao Zhengshi on the way. Later, the Public Security Bureau detained Yang Jinde and Chao Zhangshi and handed them over to the Wujin County Court. On April 6th of this year, the court sentenced Yang Jinde to fifteen years of imprisonment and found Chao Zhangshi not guilty. Prosecutor Yang, dissatisfied, appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (16th), the Wujin County Court sent police to escort them to Suzhou and send them to the High Court to await trial.</p>

<p>Improved Seeds Promise a Bountiful Harvest: The County-run Sericulture Farm in this county has been promoting improved varieties for many years and has gained the trust of silkworm farmers. As a result, many silkworm farmers are using improved varieties. This year, the County-run Sericulture Farm introduced more than 30,000 sheets of improved varieties, mostly crossbred varieties, mostly produced by the United Sericulture Improvement Association. The farm has also set up more than a dozen guidance stations in the villages, dispatching instructors to provide practical guidance, implementing joint warming and joint rearing of young silkworms. The silkworm rearing process has been quite good during the silkworm season. Currently, the early ones have already been moved to the cocooning frames, and the late ones have also completed their major sleep and are feeding. It is predicted that there will be a complete harvest.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Medical Negligence Case Spreads: Wang Yiren, an employee of the World Book Bureau in this county, because his wife Qi was pregnant and ill, hired the traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Wang Borong from the Chinese and Western Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, Wang misdiagnosed her with blood bloating and, after prescribing medication, caused her to miscarry twins. Qi's illness became more severe. Wang then hired a lawyer to write a complaint, accusing Wang Borong of medical negligence and causing death due to negligence, and filed a criminal lawsuit with the Prosecutor's Office, requesting that the Chinese and Western Hospital be sealed. The Prosecutor's Office, according to the complaint, yesterday summoned both parties to the case for interrogation. The plaintiff, Wang Yiren, arrived in court as summoned, but the defendant, Wang Borong, fearing punishment, did not appear. His wife, Wang Shen, appeared on his behalf. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhou opened the court for questioning. As a result, he ordered the plaintiff and defendant to be sent back and wait for Wang Borong to be summoned before further interrogation and review. After this case occurred, Mao Nansong, Wu Shangyi, and others published a statement in the newspaper, stating that the advertisement contained words such as "holding grudges and seeking disputes, attempting extortion." Wang Yiren believed that Mao and others published defamation in the newspaper and filed a self-accusation with the Criminal Court, accusing Mao and others of damaging his reputation and requesting punishment in accordance with Article 324 of the Criminal Law. It is not known how the court will handle it.</p>
<p>Chunhua Pawnshop Suffers Another Theft: Recently, many pawnshops in the county have been stolen from. For example, the Tongji Pawnshop in Yanqiao and the Baohe Pawnshop in Nanqiaozhen have suffered heavy losses. Yesterday, the jewelry room of the Chunhua Pawnshop on Huangnifeng outside the South Gate was also stolen. An apprentice, Liu, left without notifying anyone after closing the shop and did not return all night. When the staff in charge of the jewelry room checked the gold and silver jewelry, it was discovered that the jewelry with the number 29 was missing, worth more than 1,000 yuan, with a pawn value of several hundred yuan. The manager of the pawnshop, Wang Xiaofeng, sent a letter to Liu's guarantor, inviting him to the shop to discuss ways to maintain credit. The guarantor, realizing that the responsibility was significant, was unable to decline and agreed to compensate at the price. A Mr. Yan, who wanted to redeem a jade inlaid gold ring, was also unable to do so and finally agreed to compensate him with 86 silver dollars and stopped. It is reported that now the various sellers have all learned about the news of the theft of the jewelry room, and most of them are flocking to redeem their items, causing frequent disputes.</p>
<p>Military Police Intercept Suspicious Officer: Yesterday, when the express train on the Jinghu Railway arrived at the Wuxi Station, the military police stationed at the station boarded the train to inspect the passengers. Suddenly, they saw an officer leading three soldiers, who looked suspicious. They immediately went forward to check and found five pistols, one hundred bullets, and one thousand silver dollars. The passport had been altered. After the military police questioned him, his answers were vague. They were taken to the company headquarters and sent to the 4th Regiment's gate to prepare a document and escorted them to the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Headquarters for review.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Bandit Yang Zongda Executed by Firing Squad: Zhang Pengzhu, the County Magistrate and concurrently the Director of the Qingxiang Bureau of Wu County, previously received a person who had been reported for extortion, Yang Zongda. After interrogation, the confession was true. He was sentenced to death. The Provincial Government approved the deletion by telegram. Director Zhang signed the order on the morning of the 16th at 7 a.m. to bring the prisoner to the case, verified the correct identity, sent the police to bind him to the Fengweidun execution ground to carry out the execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>Three Shops in Diaozhuang Robbed: At Diaozhuang, about five miles from Baijiaqiao outside the East Gate of Wu County, at about 1:00 AM on the 15th, more than a dozen armed bandits suddenly arrived. They first fired shots to warn them, and then wantonly searched and robbed. Later, the villagers sounded the gong, and the thieves left with their loot, howling. After the investigation, it was found that Zhang Jinfu's rice shop, He Hongtai's tea shop, and Zhang Linhai's Jinghuo shop were robbed, causing significant losses.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>A Robbery Occurred at the Huan Family Residence: At the Huan Zhaozong residence in the Huan Family Compound in the northern township, at 9:00 PM on the 12th of this month, more than twenty bandits suddenly rushed into the house and searched it extensively. By the time the Jiashan police team stationed there heard the alarm and went to arrest them, the bandits had already fled without a trace. Afterwards, the owner checked the losses and found that gold and silver jewelry worth about 300 silver dollars had been stolen.</p>
<p>Patrol Officer Arrested for Bribery and Protecting Local Merchants: Ma Jisheng, a patrol officer from the Second Public Security Substation in the South Gate, was suspected of bribery and protecting local merchants. The county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to first dismiss the patrol officer and hand him over to the court for trial. Yesterday, after He Chengshen interrogated him, he sent Ma Jisheng to prison to await trial.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Huaian pig levy cannot be revoked: Zhou Junsheng and Li Zhensan, representatives of pig merchants from Huaian County, previously petitioned for the revocation of the pig levy in the county, arguing that it was similar in nature to the likin tax. However, the county's Public Security Bureau secretly requested the Finance Department to collect the levy to subsidize police expenses, which has a significant impact on the pig business. They came to the province to petition both the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments for its revocation and submitted a written petition in person. Yesterday, the Civil Affairs Department issued a response, stating that although the pig levy within the county's police levy had previously been approved by the department and forwarded to the Finance Department for review and ordered to be revoked, the county magistrate subsequently submitted a report detailing the situation. The Finance Department then determined that the levy was collected by the pig trade when merchants invested in the trade, and it was a voluntary contribution from pig merchants to subsidize police expenses for protection, which differed from the nature of likin tax. Therefore, it could be approved, but no bureau should be established to collect it. The pig trade should be ordered to pay the designated amount of the levy to the county on a monthly basis according to the recognized amount, obtain stamped receipts, and follow the instructions. The submitted petition still used the argument of being ordered to abolish the levy and refused to pay, which was a misunderstanding. As for the claim that the head of the county Public Security Bureau fabricated facts, it was a question of whether the Finance Department's handling was appropriate. Since the merchants did not file an administrative appeal according to the law, the county followed the original plan and executed it, which was not inappropriate. The request should not be considered, etc.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Two habitual thieves executed by firing squad: Zheng Desheng and Chen A’san, two habitual thieves from Yancheng who had previously organized crowds to rob Chen Shaoan's rice shop in Toudaoqiao, the Zhaoguan Dam tax office, the Huojiaqiao defense corps, the Datong Transportation Company, and other families, were apprehended by the county detective team and handed over to the county court. The court has now investigated the case, sentenced them to death, and submitted the sentence to the High Court for approval. The provincial government deliberated and approved the sentence. This morning (the 15th) at 10:00 AM, the county court bound them and took them to Kangshan for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Students of Nantong University Affiliated High School Arrested and Sent to the Provincial Capital: On the night of the 14th, the Nantong County government received a secret telegram from the provincial government and dispatched a special police team to search the Nantong University Affiliated High School. They arrested Mao Shilong, a student of the school, and escorted him to Zhenjiang on the 15th to be interrogated by the provincial government.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Strike: This afternoon (the 15th), all rickshaw pullers in the city went on strike, demanding road repairs and reduced levies. The county government ordered Zhang Zunshi, the head of the Public Security Bureau, to persuade the representatives of the rickshaw pullers and dispatched a police team to protect the Construction Bureau. The issue has not been resolved as of tonight.</p>
<p>Various Circles Telegraph to Request the Relocation of the Wounded Soldiers' Factory: On the 15th, various circles in Nantong telegraphed Chen Cheng, commander of the 18th Army, and Luo Zhuoying, commander of the 11th Division, requesting the relocation of the wounded soldiers' vocational training factory. The telegram stated, "Recently, Zhuang Mingyuan came to Nantong with incomplete procedures from the 11th Division, claiming to be approved by the headquarters to forcibly seize the poverty alleviation factory in Nantong, which was created with private funds, and convert it into a vocational training factory for wounded soldiers stationed in Wuhan. The citizens are indignant. We telegraphed Your Excellency Chen on the 10th, stating that the Nantong poverty alleviation factory was created with private funds and was previously used by the local government to establish a vagrant vocational training center to eliminate the source of bandits, with the consent of the factory owner and approval from the province. From a legal perspective, it seems impossible for the state to take over and designate private property. From a practical perspective, the central government should have a comprehensive plan for supporting wounded soldiers, and there is no reason to target Nantong alone. We hereby request the army commander and division commander to adopt the people's opinions and find other solutions, etc."</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Levying of Acreage Tax Leads to Prison Sentences: Chen Fuqing, Wang Meiyu, Wang Jinxiu, Ding Ruiyan, Kong Xiangui, and others from the Dayi area in the eastern countryside, previously used the name of the township office to forcibly collect acreage tax in the form of rice and grain from various places. After being reported, they were detained by the court. The case was publicly tried by Judge Fu yesterday. Chen Fuqing was sentenced to three months of imprisonment and fined 200 yuan for the crime of continuous fraud under the guise of official duties. Wang Meiyu was sentenced to three months of imprisonment and fined 50 yuan. Wang Jinxiu, Ding Ruiyan, Kong Xiangui, and the other three, whose circumstances were relatively minor, were given reduced sentences of 30 days of detention and fined 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Swallowing Opium in Despair After Being Reprimanded by Mother: Han Kangzhen from Shuiqu Alley, Yiqiao, Xiaoshan, who is already over twenty years old, had been studying outside. He returned home on the 12th after his studies were suspended. He spent silver dollars on travel in Hangzhou and was severely reprimanded by his stepmother, Jin. He was then severely scolded by his father. Kangzhen, feeling overwhelmed, swallowed opium the next morning to end his life. Neighbors noticed and provided various forms of rescue, and he was slightly restored. However, whether he can avoid unexpected consequences is still difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Mingguang</h3>
<p>The Case of the District Chief Forcibly Collecting Levies Escalates: Regarding the incident of the 10th District Chief Kan Kaijiu causing a disturbance due to forcibly collecting levies and detaining students such as Li Renkui, the school and local authorities believe that Li and others are innocent and have repeatedly negotiated with Kan for their release without success. Today (the 15th), more than 300 students from Mingguang Public School petitioned the garrison and the Public Security Bureau one after another, demanding justice and rescuing the arrested students, and held a demonstration, filled with sorrow and indignation. Various organizations believe that Kan is incorrigible and have filed charges with the provincial and county governments. There are also rumors of a strike to support them.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan University Games Conclude Successfully</h3>
<p>Central University — Wins Track and Field Championship</p>
<p>Jinan University — Wins Track Championship</p>
<p>Central Women — Wins Women's Championship</p>
<p>National New Record in Pole Vault Also Creates Five New Meet Records</p>
<p>The fifth Jiangnan University Games concluded yesterday. Central University won the track and field championship, Jinan University won the track championship, and Central Women won the women's track and field championship. A total of five new Jiangnan University records and one new national record were created at the meet. Yesterday was sunny and warm, the order was excellent, and the spectators were enthusiastic. The awards ceremony and closing ceremony were held at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>One National Record</h3>
<p>Five Meet Records—</p>
<p>Pole Vault — Breaks National Record</p>
<p>—Chen Ling of Central University — 3.495 Meters—</p>
<p>Pole Vault, High Hurdles, Discus, Javelin, 1500 Meters</p>
<p>—All Break Meet Records—</p>
<p>A total of five new records were created during the two-day meet. On the second day, Chen Ling's pole vault of 3.495 meters not only broke Tu Chuanzhen's Jiangnan University record of 3.45 meters, but also broke Xia Xiang's national record of 3.475 meters, adding much color to the meet. The five new meet records created were: (1) Ma Fengrui of China Public School in the 1500 meters, (2) Chen Ling of Central University in the high hurdles, (3) Wang Jihuai of Guanghua University in the javelin, (4) Gao Shangzhi of Central University in the discus, and (5) Chen Ling of Central University in the pole vault. Also, the open shot put was a national new record, but it was not officially contested.</p>
<h3>Central University Track and Field King</h3>
<p>—Chen Ling's Pole Vault Stands Out—</p>
<p>—Guanghua Takes Second Place—</p>
<p>In the men's track and field events, Central University won the championship with 20 points, becoming the track and field king. On the first day, Central University surpassed Jinan University by three points, with a score of ten to seven. Guanghua was only in third place with five points in the long jump. Yesterday, in the finals of the four events, Central University suddenly added six points in the pole vault, while Jinan University did not score. Thus, victory and defeat were decided. Furthermore, it is commendable that Chen Ling of Central University also set a new national record of 3.495 meters in this event. In the javelin and long jump, Wang Jihuai won two first places, and Guanghua jumped to second place. Although Zhao Rugong of Central University did not participate in this event, Jinan University only scored one point, and their hopes were dashed. Wen Dingxin could not equal his own Jiangnan University record in the javelin, only getting three points, allowing Central University to gain two points. These are the reasons for the victory and defeat.</p>
<h3>Track and Field Scores for Each School</h3>
<p>1st Central University 20 Points</p>
<p>2nd Guanghua University 16 Points</p>
<p>3rd Jinan University 14 Points</p>
<p>4th Jiaotong University 13 Points</p>
<p>5th Fudan University 8 Points</p>
<p>6th Daxia University 6 Points</p>
<p>7th China Public School 0 Points</p>
<h3>Jinan University Track Champion</h3>
<p>One Point More Than Central University</p>
<p>Thanks to the 200 Meters</p>
<p>Jinan University won the track championship, only one point more than Central University. There was a great deal of luck involved in this. The track events were originally a battle between Jinan and Central, and others had no chance to compete. Jinan excelled in short distances, while Central was strong in the high and intermediate hurdles. Central's performance in the middle distances was more impressive. Based on the above, Central seemed to have a greater chance of winning. Moreover, there was also the strong Fudan athlete Gu Zaiping in the short distances. However, Jinan, through arduous struggles, managed to win by a margin of one point. There were two reasons for this. In the 200-meter race, Gu Zaiping was highly favored, and it was difficult for Jinan's veterans Hao Chunde and Zhong Lianji to compete. Unexpectedly, the veterans showed their power, overwhelming the rising stars. Hao was first, Zhong was second, and Gu was third, while Jinan's Zeng Rongzhong also won fourth place. Central's entire team failed, resulting in Jinan scoring nine points, which was extremely influential in the overall situation. This was one reason. The last event of the track competition was the intermediate hurdles. At that time, Jinan had 25 points and Central had 18 points, a difference of seven points. Central had four participants, while Jinan had none. Among the four participants from Central, Chen Ling was almost certain to win first place. If the other three could secure a second-place finish, or two third and fourth place finishes, Central would surpass Jinan with 26 points. Even if they only managed to win a third-place finish, the scores would be tied at 25 points each, and Central would still win the championship due to having one more first-place finish (Jinan had two, Central had three). In other words, at that time, Jinan was helpless and could only wait for fate to decide. However, in reality, things changed. Chen Ling's first place was beyond doubt, but Guanghua's Tao Mojie and Jiaotong University's Zhang Jinrong occupied the second and third positions. Although Central tried hard, their strength was insufficient, and they were helpless. This was the second reason.</p>
<p>—Track Scores for Each School—</p>
<p>1st Jinan University 25 Points</p>
<p>2nd Central University 24 Points</p>
<p>3rd Fudan University 13 Points</p>
<p>4th China Public School 10 Points</p>
<p>2nd Guanghua University 9 Points</p>
<p>6th Jiaotong University 5 Points</p>
<p>7th Daxia University 2 Points</p>
<h3>Central University Dominates Women’s Track and Field</h3>
<p>—Except for Javelin and Shot Put—</p>
<p>—Every Other Event Had a First Place—</p>
<p>Central University won the women's track and field championship with ease, scoring 49 points to rank first. In the seven events, except for the javelin and shot put, every other event had a first place. Besides Central and Jinan universities, which enthusiastically participated in this year's women's track and field events, Guanghua and Fudan universities were hesitant and did not participate, which reduced the interest considerably, making it almost a contest between Central, Jinan, and Fudan universities. It is hoped that there will be uniform competition in the next meet.</p>
<p>—Track and Field Scores for Each School—</p>
<p>1st Central University 46 Points</p>
<p>2nd Jinan University 27 Points</p>
<p>3rd Daxia University 3 Points</p>

<h3>Zhang Naiyan and Others' Educational Proposals for the National Assembly</h3>
<p>Zhang Naiyan, a Zhejiang representative to the National Assembly, proposed a resolution to ensure the duties of those engaged in education in order to foster professionalism. The original text is as follows: Rationale: Education is a fundamental national plan, and the duties of those engaged in education are extremely important. However, there have been no regulations to truly protect them. Administrative offices often easily replace principals, and with each principal change, teachers and staff are also replaced, viewing the school as an official bureau, and teachers as hired hands. As a result, those who consider themselves noble often remain hidden, and those with talent often abandon their posts. On the one hand, there is a shortage of talent, and on the other hand, there is a struggle for position. The failure to see clear and significant results after running a school for more than a decade is not unrelated to this. Now, if we want to concentrate talent in education, effective protection is essential. Based on the above reasons, I propose the following measures: Measures: The Legislative Yuan should enact specific regulations to protect teachers and staff at all levels of schools. Those engaged in educational duties should, as a matter of principle, remain in their positions for a long time. Administrative offices and school principals should not advance or dismiss people based on personal preferences.</p>
<p>Another proposal states: Implement a direct minor tax dedicated to educational funding to provide universal education, assist poor and outstanding students to advance in their studies, and improve the salaries of primary school and vocational teachers.</p>

<h3>St. John's University Alumni Garden Party</h3>
<p>President Bu is on Leave to Return Home</p>
<p>Shen Siliang is Acting President</p>
<p>The St. John's University Alumni Association held a garden party yesterday afternoon at 1 o'clock. The garden is located in Fanwangdu, with towering ancient trees and beautiful scenery. In addition to the clear weather after a long rain, the attendees were especially numerous. At 2:30, various games were played first on the lawn south of the garden, followed by a meeting in the social room. The chairman, Yu Hongjun, the president of the association, delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "We revisit our alma mater as if returning home after marriage, filled with joy and emotion," and so on. Next, President Bu gave a speech, saying in essence, "Today, everyone in the world is worried about the economic downturn, but this garden party at our school shows no signs of a downturn, which is very gratifying. I believe that university education is about quality, not quantity. Higher education in China has developed very rapidly in recent years, but our school has a long history and has cultivated an excellent spirit, making a significant contribution to Chinese education. I am old and will be on leave to return home this summer, and Vice President Shen will act as president. I hope the alumni will do their best to assist. Know that the difficult times for our school are far behind us, and the future should be very optimistic," and so on. Next, Mr. Wang Yunwang gave a speech, detailing his feelings about traveling to Japan, the United States, Britain, Switzerland, Belgium, and Italy. He then said that St. John's University in China, both in its history and spirit, is worthy of admiration. Today, in the diplomatic, educational, and business sectors, there are alumni of St. John's, and its influence has reached the whole country. He hoped that it would make even greater contributions in the future. Other programs included ancient music, Chinese music, Western music, and martial arts, etc. Then photos were taken and refreshments were served, and awards were given by Mrs. Yu Hongjun. The party ended in joy.</p>

<h3>Circular Telegram from the Municipal Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Responding to He Yingqin's Genuine Telegram</p>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee, deeply indignant at the fictitious facts and slanderous accusations against comrades in the telegram of the 30th by Deng Zeru, Gu Yingfen, and others, recently received a genuine telegram from four comrades including He Yingqin, and immediately sent a telegram in response. The original text is excerpted as follows: "To Minister He, Chairman He, Chairman Lu, and Chairman He in Nanjing: We have read your genuine telegram. Unfortunately, the Party and the nation have suffered from years of war. The melons of the Yellow Terrace are plucked again and again. Fortunately, our revolutionary soldiers, under the leadership of Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, have worked together with one heart and one mind, advancing bravely, fighting for the cause, and sacrificing for the people, enabling us to eliminate warlords and unify China. Since the military settlement last year, the central government has adhered to the teachings of the Premier, devoted itself to political tutelage and construction, working hard and tirelessly. Recently, it convened the National Assembly to formulate a provisional constitution and start anew with the people. All those with blood and breath should set aside petty grievances and work together for the greater good, sacrificing private interests for public benefit, in order to deliver our compatriots from fire and water and secure the national foundation. Unexpectedly, comrades Deng Zeru, Gu Yingfen, and others, with ulterior motives, dared to issue a telegram at the beginning of the National Assembly, inciting the people's hearts, and Chen Jitang and others again took the opportunity to deploy troops, destroying peace. The news has deeply alarmed the people of Shanghai. Your telegram is full of righteousness, and your loyalty is evident. Your words are earnest and your righteousness is strict. There is no shortage of enlightened people in Guangdong and Guangxi, who will surely rise up at the sound of the wind and curb the chaos together. If Chen Jitang and others continue to be stubborn and want to lightly move troops and cause more suffering to our people, our association can only appeal to the central government to issue a clear order for suppression. The people of Shanghai are willing to be the rearguard," and so on.</p>

<h3>The Slaughter Tax Uproar Escalates</h3>
<p>Butchers to Suspend Business Today</p>
<p>The municipal slaughter tax, since the Finance Bureau took over, has been implemented by collecting fees per head of livestock, which has aroused opposition from meat merchants, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that meat merchants, unable to bear the burden and with the authorities detaining pigs, have had no choice but to suspend business, and have submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for relief. The situation yesterday is described below.</p>
<p>Butchers Stop Slaughtering The slaughter tax was previously contracted by meat merchants such as Fan Chunqiu to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funding Management Office. This time, after the municipal government took over, it implemented collection per head of livestock, which aroused opposition from meat merchants, who demanded the abolition of the slaughter tax and its replacement with a business tax, but were unsuccessful. The municipal government set the implementation date for the 16th (originally scheduled for May 1, but later extended to the 15th at the request of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Finance Bureau). After a meeting of the Fresh Meat Industry Association members, it was decided to stop slaughtering from the 15th. Starting today, meat merchants throughout the city will have no meat to sell and will suspend business. Pig merchants have been greatly affected, and the people also feel quite inconvenienced, it is said.</p>
<p>Shop Investigation The number of fresh meat businesses that have suspended operations due to the slaughter tax issue is as follows: more than 420 in Zhabei District, 13 in Jiangwan District, 17 in Wusong District, 6 in Zhenru District, 4 in Yinxiang District, 4 in Yinhang District, 7 in Beixinjing, 20 in Xinlaolonghua, 24 in Xujiahui District, 42 in Caojiadu, 13 in Gaoqiao District, 45 in Lannidu, 12 in Yangjiadu and Lujiadu, 27 in Dongjiadu, 11 in Bailianjing, 5 in Yangsi Township, 15 in Tangqiao, more than 400 in Hunan, and 120 in Tangjiawan, totaling more than 1,200. Among the fresh meat businesses in the concessions, there are more than 300 in the British Concession, such as Lu Gaojian, more than 800 in the American Concession, such as Wang Jiren, and more than 200 in the French Concession, such as Yongda. According to news from the trade association, they will rise up to help and take united action in the coming days, given their shared interests and the need to stand together, it is said.</p>
<p>Instructions from the Authorities The Municipal Public Security, Finance, and Health Bureaus jointly issued instructions, which stated, "In order to comply with orders, in view of the many memorial holidays in May, to prevent unscrupulous elements from inciting incidents, the Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters have issued announcements prohibiting strikes and market closures. It is now found that the city's fresh meat merchants are on strike to coerce the cancellation of the slaughter tax. However, the slaughter tax is a common local tax that has been in place for more than ten years. Our city has taken over in accordance with the law, and there is no reason to unreasonably obstruct it. In addition to ordering the investigation and punishment of those who obstruct and incite, we hereby order your association to earnestly inform the trade to continue business as usual, and not to be fooled by others, so as not to violate the ban. You are ordered to comply and report back for future reference."</p>
<p>Assistance from Various Industries More than 100 trade associations in the city, including floral, department store, seafood, grocery, refining, lace, and pawnshop industries, are indignant at the financial authorities' coercion of the meat industry to pay taxes and the detention of pigs, which has led to the suspension of business in the meat industry. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a request to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government to immediately find a way to stop it in order to stabilize commerce. (The full text is omitted)</p>
<p>Yu's Intervention Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leader in Shanghai's business community, is always very enthusiastic about protecting businessmen. In view of the fact that the meat industry consists of small businesses, he telegraphed Mayor Zhang yesterday, asking him to be considerate of the difficulties of the merchants and approve the meat industry's request, it is said.</p>
<p>The Meat Industry Petitions The Fresh Meat Industry Association, considering the Social Bureau to be an organization for protecting industry and commerce, sent representatives Rong Qianchu, Wang Jinwen, and others to the Social Bureau yesterday to petition. They were received by Chen Zeyi of the bureau. The representatives explained their plight and asked for help. Mr. Chen replied that it was the bureau's duty to protect industry and commerce, and that he would forward the request to the municipal government for consideration and modification. The representatives were satisfied with the result and left. The Fresh Meat Association also sent representatives Rong Qianchu, Jin Guifu, Wang Jinwen, and Huang Jikang to Nanjing to petition. They were received by Luo Jieren, a staff member of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funding Management Office. Regarding their request, he promised to forward it to Director Niu. The representatives considered this satisfactory and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. They then received a batch numbered 379, which read, "We have received the presentation. The Shanghai municipal slaughter tax has been handled by the office in a letter to the municipal government. You should submit it directly for approval." This batch.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Submits a Document The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government, the Municipal Government, and Wang Yansong, a representative to the National Assembly, stating, "On the 14th of this month, we received a letter from the City Fresh Meat Industry Association, stating that the association is now caused the city government to order the industry to buy tickets for each pig slaughtered, which has aroused unanimous opposition from the industry. The association is requested to forward this to the higher authorities and, in accordance with the one-item-one-tax system promulgated by the Central Government, cancel the slaughter tax. The association has considered this in detail. If a good solution is not actively devised, the trend among the industry will inevitably expand. Therefore, yesterday, we specially convened a general meeting of all members at the hall of your association, with more than 1,000 members attending. We have presented a request to the Municipal Training Association and the Municipal Social Bureau, as well as your association, to send representatives to attend and guide the discussion. It was unanimously decided that in addition to requesting the municipal government to change the city's pig slaughter tax to a business tax, the Municipal Health Bureau should also cancel the pre-slaughter fees charged to the industry in the concessions, as well as the post-slaughter fees charged to the industry in the interior, and the inspection fees charged by technicians dispatched from the four rural districts. Furthermore, because the municipal government recently forced the industry to buy tickets for each pig slaughtered, which caused a disturbance for a time, fortunately, Comrade Zheng Chengqing of your association and representatives of the Municipal Finance Bureau negotiated and temporarily limited this to the 15th of this month. Although peace was temporarily restored, the fundamental problem was not resolved. In the future, after the deadline, the municipal government will still want to force the industry to buy tickets and pay taxes. The general meeting also unanimously decided to request the municipal government not to force the purchase of tickets after the 15th, otherwise, it will inevitably cause a unanimous shutdown of the industry throughout the city. In addition, the municipal government's new plan is to build a new slaughterhouse near Song Park Road in Zhabei and to stop all existing commercially operated slaughterhouses. If this is implemented, the industry throughout the city will feel inconvenienced. In addition, the distance to the four rural districts is far, making travel even more inconvenient. It was also unanimously decided to request the municipal government to withdraw the order and return the operation to the industry's own regional management, improving the new slaughterhouse. The above situation has been unanimously decided at the meeting. For the sake of national taxes and the industry's future, the association should present the facts of the meeting to your association, uphold the difficulties of the industry, and request the municipal government to quickly change the city's pig slaughter tax to a business national tax. In addition, issues such as pre-slaughter and post-slaughter fees, the inspection fees of technicians from the four rural districts, and the plan for a new slaughterhouse should be canceled. The association also has a statement that the municipal government had previously limited the purchase of tickets and the collection of taxes to the 15th of this month. However, after the 15th, we still ask the municipal government not to force the collection of taxes. Before the slaughter tax is changed to a business tax, the industry will still pay according to the original tax amount to show consideration. This matter concerns national taxes and the industry's future, and is extremely urgent, awaiting your orders." It has been found that this slaughter tax has been changed from being contracted by contractors to being collected by the Municipal Finance Bureau on a per-head basis. In fact, the taxes paid are higher than before. This matter concerns the burden of the entire meat industry and is by no means a dispute over the interests of a few contractors. As for the abolition of the contractor system, in terms of tax principles, it is naturally proper. However, the situation in this city is complex. Just in terms of fresh meat, there is the provincial slaughter tax and the municipal inspection fee. Those transported to the concessions must be collected by the Public Works Department. The division of political power has caused the meat merchants to bear triple taxes, which is a unique phenomenon in Shanghai. Since the government officials, due to the situation, have been unable to unify the taxes, the meat merchants, in order to avoid excessive burdens, request to maintain the original contract. It is inevitable. The unification of the tax system and the abolition of contractors are mutually related. It is not permissible to only consider the abolition of contractors as a proper move to reorganize the tax system, and to dismiss the meat merchants' position with one-sided beneficial matters. Taking the inspection fee of this city as an example, the annual income, based on the agreed contract amount of the previous year alone, is already more than 22,000 yuan. The municipal treasury relies on this as a tax source, which has exceeded the actual inspection cost. In the past, when municipal taxes were not abundant, although meat merchants had overlapping burdens, the power was in the hands of the officials, or it was unavoidable. Now, the business tax for various industries is about to be implemented, and the Pudong wharf donation has also been recovered for some time. The increase in the city's treasury should be more than one million. On the one hand, there are new taxes to increase revenue, and on the other hand, there should be a reorganization of the tax system, so that the people can be taxed without excessive burdens. Before the meat merchants' overlapping burdens are eliminated and the business tax is not changed, they request that the slaughter tax still be paid according to the original tax amount. According to the above situation, there is indeed reason. It is appropriate to telegraph your office to review and approve, and to order the municipal government to approve as requested, which is in the public interest.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the 7th Shanghai Municipal Health Week. The details of various activities are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Vaccination Situation After 8:00 AM yesterday, the Municipal Health Bureau sent doctors and nurses to the cholera prevention vaccination station at the North Railway Station. All travelers and pedestrians were advised to get vaccinated until 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, doctors and nurses from the Health Department of the Two-Road Administration Bureau continued to advise travelers and civilians to get vaccinated until 6:00 PM. Another team of doctors and nurses went to the municipal elementary schools in the North and South City early yesterday morning (the names of the schools were listed in yesterday's newspaper) to administer vaccinations. In the afternoon, key members of the bureau's prevention section, accompanied by six doctors and nurses and more than ten sanitary police officers, first stationed themselves near the Guanqiao Bridge in the South City. The officers held up the large yellow umbrellas they were carrying, and four small tables were set up under the umbrellas, displaying various medical instruments. In a short while, citizens came to watch the umbrellas in an endless stream. The doctors and nurses immediately went forward to explain the dangers of cholera to the citizens, stating that getting vaccinated could avoid the risk of infection. The doctors then instructed the onlookers to get vaccinated one by one. After about an hour, three or four hundred people had been vaccinated. They then went to the bridge pier on Hengfeng Road to advise pedestrians to get vaccinated, it is said.</p>
<p>Slogans Everywhere The bureau has been posting wall slogans in the city's major transportation hubs for several days. As of yesterday afternoon, the bureau still sent staff to the north and south transportation routes to inspect and paste wall slogans, which were mostly completed. Health slogans on the walls of various tram stops and thoroughfares were visible everywhere. Yesterday, slogans were also found on various trams, buses, and long-distance buses of the China Merchants Tram Company. In order to achieve widespread coverage, the bureau will order staff to inspect and add more slogans on various vehicles starting tomorrow. The number of slogans on rickshaws increased yesterday.</p>
<p>Vaccination Suspension Today The bureau has decided to suspend vaccination for one day today, as it is Sunday. Staff members and doctors in various departments have been very busy preparing for publicity and implementation in recent days, and need to rest.</p>
<h3>British Minister Left for Nanjing Yesterday by Ship</h3>
<p>New Methods to be Proposed for Legal Rights Negotiations</p>
<p>British Minister to China Sir Miles Lampson, who intends to reopen negotiations with our country for the Sino-British legal rights negotiations, left Shanghai for Nanjing yesterday at 12:00 AM, accompanied by Secretary Smith, Counselor Price, Chinese Secretary Qin Jiman, and a total of eight male and female staff members, aboard the Taikoo Shipping Company's Wusong ship. It is scheduled to leave Wusong at 1:30 AM this morning and head west along the Yangtze River, arriving in Nanjing at around 7:00 or 8:00 AM on Monday. He will then visit Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to conduct negotiations. It is heard that the British minister has drafted new methods for resolving the legal rights negotiations and will present them to the Foreign Minister for discussion, it is said.</p>
<h3>French and Japanese Ministers Arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing</h3>
<p>French Minister Wilden arrived in Shanghai at 11:11 PM yesterday, taking the express train from Nanjing at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Mamoru and former Ambassador to Russia Tanaka Tokichi took the night train from Nanjing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Departed from Shanghai Only Yesterday</h3>
<p>Taking the Ryota Maru to Japan</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, kept his whereabouts very secret. This newspaper previously reported, based on the words of his Secretary-General Sun Xiwwen to reporters from various newspapers, that Chen had left for Japan on the morning of the 13th aboard the British mail ship Cachemaille. On the same day, various newspapers also carried similar reports. According to reliable sources, Chen had not left Shanghai at that time because he still needed to contact the central government about the Guangdong affairs. After Chen met with Liu Wendao, a representative of the central government, the issue came to a conclusion. Liu returned to Nanjing the night before yesterday, and Chen Mingshu, accompanied by Secretary Yang Jianping and one staff member, left Shanghai for Japan at 8:00 AM yesterday aboard the Japanese mail ship Ryota Maru. His ticket was purchased to Kobe, and from Kobe, he would take a train to Tokyo. He is scheduled to stay for more than a month before deciding on his next move.</p>
<h3>The Buddhist Association Presents Memoranda on Tibetan Affairs</h3>
<p>Document Presented to the National Government</p>
<p>Regarding the discord between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama in Tibet, the Chinese Buddhist Association presented a document to the National Government, requesting the selection and dispatch of Han and Mongolian Buddhist leaders to Tibet to explain that the Dalai Lama welcomes the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet, so as to strengthen the border and prevent foreign covetousness. The document states, "Tibet has a vast territory and is adjacent to British India. It is rich in resources and has long been eyed by the British. This time, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama are at odds, and the Panchen Lama has left. The Dalai Lama is also repeatedly waging war on the Sichuan border. It is difficult to guarantee that he has not been fooled by foreigners. Tibet is our country's territory, and if we let him do as he pleases, it is feared that the imperialists will wantonly invade, and the western border will be breached. Taixu and others are deeply worried about this. Yesterday, Taixu specially visited the Panchen Lama and his entourage, advising him to cease strife with the Dalai Lama, which was greatly appreciated. However, the Dalai Lama's side has not yet agreed. It is proposed to ask the Chairman to follow his belief in Buddhism and quickly select and dispatch one Han and one Mongolian Buddhist leader, setting a deadline for them to enter Tibet. Using the great meaning of Buddhism's selfless non-contention, they should explain to the Dalai Lama and his entourage, and make them understand the profound interests. They should make them convinced so that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama will first automatically send a joint telegram, releasing suspicion and returning to harmony. Then, the Dalai Lama and his entourage will welcome the Panchen Lama and his entourage back to Tibet, so that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama can be in their respective positions, strengthening the Tibetan people's inward orientation, thereby strengthening the border and preventing foreign covetousness. Is this appropriate? We hereby present this with respect, and respectfully request your approval and implementation. It is truly both public and virtuous," and so on.</p>
<h3>Bids for the New Municipal Government Building Opened Yesterday</h3>

<h3>All Circles Support the People's Convention's Declaration on Abolishing Treaties</h3>
<p>Third District Party Department The Third District Party Department issued a declaration, the gist of which is as follows: (Omitted titles) Our country has been bound by unequal treaties for eighty years, leading to the bankruptcy of industry and the weakness of national strength. Thinking of this, we feel deeply pained. Now, the National Convention, based on the teachings of the Premier and in accordance with the demands of the people, has resolutely and voluntarily declared their abolition. All Chinese people are celebrating this in unison. However, at the beginning of this treaty abolition, all compatriots across the country should be diligent, persevering, courageous, and progressive, so that the happiness of freedom and equality may shine without bounds. On the government's side, efforts should be made to improve domestic politics and promote proposed projects. Those engaged in agriculture, industry, and commerce should strive to improve production technology and enrich the national economy. Those involved in education should study practical sciences to avoid borrowing talent from foreign countries. Only then can the realization of the Three Principles of the People and the era of global harmony be within reach. This declaration is hereby made, hoping to be remembered. The Executive Committee of the Third District of the Shanghai Special City of the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>National Products Maintenance Association The China National Products Maintenance Association telegraphed the National Convention yesterday, stating, "To the esteemed representatives of the National Convention in the capital: Our country has been bound by unequal treaties for decades, hindering our development, undermining our construction, and even leading to the invasion of our territory and the usurpation of our national rights. Laws, customs duties, and everything else have been trampled upon. As a result, the national economy and the people's livelihood have suffered greatly. Internal strife has arisen repeatedly, and the country is on the verge of ruin. If we do not take practical measures to cure this, how can we survive? We have found that our friendly nations are not lacking in enlightened individuals and countries upholding justice, and they have already abolished these treaties one after another. Only a few countries remain, still insatiable in their ambitions, intending to delay and preserve their tools of aggression. Fortunately, your convention, adhering to the last wishes of the late Premier, has issued a declaration voluntarily abolishing unequal treaties and proclaiming this to the world. The words are righteous and the arguments are sound. Our association, as a group representing the entire national products industry, has long suffered from the pain of unequal treaties and has been deeply harmed. Therefore, we especially support the declaration of abolition and vow to support it with the utmost sincerity, striving for its thorough realization, regardless of any difficulties or sacrifices. We hereby telegraph our support, hoping you will take it into consideration." Standing Committee Members of the China National Products Maintenance Association, Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, respectfully bow.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Received Two Telegrams Yesterday</h3>
<p>Supporting the Declaration on the Voluntary Abolition of Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China received telegrams yesterday from the Federations of Chambers of Commerce of Henan and Hunan provinces. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Please Voluntarily Abolish Consular Jurisdiction "Our country has been bound by unequal treaties for decades, and the consular jurisdiction is the most painful for our business community. Whenever there are commercial lawsuits involving Chinese and foreigners, foreign consuls invariably favor their own merchants. Even if we win the lawsuit, there are many difficulties in execution, and there are rarely satisfactory results. The late Premier taught that the abolition of unequal treaties was of utmost importance, and the current government also has plans to reclaim legal rights. However, since foreigners rely on this as a tool of aggression, they will inevitably obstruct it in various ways to pursue their own interests. We implore the central government to resolutely take action and immediately announce the abolition of consular jurisdiction to maintain the judicial system and the sovereignty of the entire territory. This office, on behalf of the entire business community of the province, stands as your support. We send this telegram with indignation, hoping you will take it into consideration." Prepared by the Preparatory Office of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Hunan Province.</p>
<p>Please Resolutely Abolish Unequal Treaties "(Titles Omitted) Since the Manchus entered and ruled our country, public opinion has completely disappeared, and sovereignty has been controlled by the monarch, who rashly represented the entire people with his personal will. Since the Opium War in 1840, the true image of corruption has been completely exposed, leading to imperialists with aggressive policies swarming in. Taking advantage of our nation's lack of awareness, they used cannons and warships to intimidate the weak and incompetent Qing government, forcing it to sign various unequal treaties that did not represent the will of the people, placing the entire country in a semi-colonial position for ninety years. It was the ultimate humiliation of losing national rights and sovereignty. Our late Premier, worried about the government's ignorance and hating the bullying of various countries, initiated the revolution, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and revealed the true meaning of national self-determination as a warning to prevent the aggression of the great powers. Therefore, the early years of the Republic had a completely new outlook. Unfortunately, the nation's fortunes declined, and warlords rose up one after another, fabricating falsehoods and slandering without restraint, violating public opinion and losing rights and interests, and flattering the great powers to consolidate their political power. The decline of our international status became even more irreversible. Under these critical circumstances, we must strive to fight for the liberation of our nation, and we must automatically abolish unequal treaties that do not represent the will of the people to consolidate our national foundation. Moreover, imperialists have always regarded the subjugation of weak nations as their duty, and wherever there is profit, they flock to it like ducks. To expect them to abolish the old treaties is like seeking skins from a tiger. Even in the current negotiations for the abolition of consular jurisdiction, our government has long declared its intention to abolish it on a set date, but the various imperialists are ambivalent, delaying and procrastinating, and their intentions are to use cunning means to seek a final reservation. National sovereignty resides in the people, and unequal treaties concluded in violation of public opinion are not only absolutely unacceptable to our citizens, but also fundamentally cannot have legal effect. Yet, imperialists disregard human rights, ignore justice, and do not hesitate to use base means to seek their own interests, infringing upon our sovereignty and suppressing our public opinion. If we continue to delay and make mistakes, and do not resolutely abolish these treaties, the future of our country will be truly unimaginable. We hope that our people will awaken deeply, strive to invigorate themselves, unite the will of the people, and, with a spirit of great fearlessness, deal with the imperialists, act as a support for the central government, and not stop until the goal of abolition is achieved. On this day when the National Convention begins, we announce the abolition of unequal treaties. The late Premier's words are still ringing in our ears. We wish our people to quickly plan for this together. We send this urgent telegram, with the utmost anticipation." Sent by the Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce in Henan Province.</p>
<h3>The Consolidated Tax Bureau Abolishes Resident Postal Offices</h3>
<p>Replaced by Customs Resident Postal Offices for Collection</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance had previously ordered the Consolidated Tax Bureau of this port to abolish all Customs offices nationwide. This measure was implemented yesterday. The Ministry of Finance also stated that since the Shanghai Postal Administration also has offices set up by the Consolidated Tax Bureau, and their nature is the same as that of the resident Customs offices, they should also be abolished in a uniform manner. Therefore, the Consolidated Tax Bureau was ordered to comply uniformly some days ago. The Consolidated Tax Bureau, after receiving the order, also abolished them yesterday. All procedures for collecting consolidated taxes at post offices have been transferred to the Customs resident postal offices.</p>
<h3>Draft Special Trade Union Law</h3>
<p>National Convention Submits to the National Government for Reference</p>
<p>The Draft Special Trade Union Law, drafted by the Postal Workers' Union and submitted by more than one hundred representatives of the labor circle, including Hou Dachun, to the National Convention, has been learned to have been submitted by the Presidium of the Convention on the 13th to the Proposal Review Committee for review. The Committee deemed that it had sufficient reasons. However, due to the large number of proposals before the Convention, except for a small number of important proposals concerning the entire situation, which should be submitted to the Convention for discussion, most of the other proposals involved individual scopes or had already established principles and only required expediting, and it was not necessary to present them for discussion one by one during the Convention's brief period. The Special Trade Union Law and the Trade Union Law are to be implemented in parallel, and their promulgation should not be a problem. The 54 articles of the draft proposed by the Postal Workers' Union have pure aims and advocate for mixed employee organizations, breaking down the bad phenomenon of separation between superiors and subordinates. It proposes a general organization so that national actions can all be brought onto the right track. Overall, it is generally applicable. Therefore, the Proposal Review Committee has submitted the draft, etc., to the National Government for reference when formally enacting the law. Such an expedient arrangement, taking into account all parties, is greatly admired for the spirit of the Convention. It is expected that after the National Convention closes, the future of the labor movement will have new developments.</p>
<h3>Appeal to Ban the Cutting of Paulownia and Pine Trees in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>The National Products Factory Association Telegraphed the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation telegraphed the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating, "Member Heji Umbrella Hook Factory, for the convenience of procuring raw materials, has set up a branch in the Jin Clan Ancestral Hall north of Ninghai County, Zhejiang Province, where Zheng Jijian and Dai Minggao purchase paulownia and pine trees from various places to manufacture umbrella hooks to resist imported goods. These raw materials are collected sporadically from nearby villagers on the mountains and are small paulownia and pine trees that have been growing for years, usually only used as firewood. The factory values their ease of bending, so they paint them with black lacquer to use as umbrella handles, turning useless materials into useful ones. In terms of promoting industry, it is necessary to maintain this small craft. However, the local Public Security Bureau, listening to biased opinions, claimed that it was harming the forest and prohibited procurement and sent police to order a shutdown, a measure that is particularly inappropriate. Therefore, we hereby telegraph and request your ministry to consider that the factory was established to resist foreign goods, and dozens of workers rely on it for a living. Once it is closed, it not only goes against the intention of promoting national products, but also causes dozens of workers to lose their jobs. We urge you to transfer this to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and instruct the county government to quickly lift the ban."</p>
<h3>Preliminary Announcement of the Unveiling Ceremony of the Tongji University Monument</h3>
<p>May 20th</p>
<p>The Alumni Association of Tongji University decided in a meeting last year to erect a monument in the school for Dr. Paulun, the founder of the medical department of the university, Dr. Püllen, the former director of the engineering department, and Mr. Yuan Guanlan, the late director of the school, to commemorate them. Several months have passed since then. It is heard that since the decision was made, graduates and alumni who have left the school have separately made donations. Now, the memorial monument has been installed and completed and will be unveiled at the same time on the 24th anniversary of the school, that is, on the morning of May 20th at 9:00 AM at Tongji University in Wusong. The inscription on the monument for Mr. Yuan Guanlan is said to be from the hand of Mr. Huang Renzhi. An excerpt is as follows: "Oh, my fellow students, those who remember our alma mater should never forget the resurrection of our alma mater in the sixth year of the Republic of China, which is a great and indelible commemoration in the entire history of the school. After the outbreak of the European War, our school, due to its German founding relationship, was in a precarious situation. When the school buildings were closed by force, the students suddenly lost their home. They had no choice but to send representatives to the capital to appeal to the Ministry of Education. Those in society who sympathized with our school also actively urged the government to maintain the school. At that time, the government was struggling to respond to the issue of participating in the war, and the noise was endless. Only towards our school did it send a special envoy to discuss strategies. When the proposal to take over the school for self-management was decided, it appointed a president, rectified the school name, and allocated funds, directing everything with composure, so that the teaching has not ceased to this day. Whose power is this? We must be grateful to Mr. Yuan Guanlan. Mr. Yuan, named Xitao, was from Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province. At that time, he was the Vice Minister of Education acting as the head of the ministry and was also a member of the Wartime International Affairs Committee. He was able to maintain our school with his utmost sincerity and great power, preventing it from falling. After leaving the government, he devoted himself to local education and used his remaining energy to oversee our school. Throughout his life, Mr. Yuan made many contributions to education, and his great virtues and great achievements are beyond words. But his contribution to our school is especially great. After his death, we write this article in the public interest to inform future generations. Mr. Yuan Guanlan died on August 29th, the 19th year of the Republic of China, at the age of sixty-five." Alumni Association of the National Tongji University.</p>
<h3>Ban on the Manufacture of Old-Style Scales</h3>
<p>Unification of Weights and Measures</p>
<p>Since the Social Bureau stipulated the standard of weights and measures, it has notified the scale shops in the city to manufacture according to the regulations on record. However, recently, it has been found that while there are many people in this industry who manufacture according to the regulations, there are also not a few who adhere to the old-style models. Therefore, in recent days, personnel have been sent to each of these industries to conduct thorough investigations and inspections. If any illegal old-style scales or similar items are found, they will be immediately abolished and ordered to manufacture according to the stipulated standard scale model in the future. If they resist or disobey, they will be immediately taken to the police stations in each district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>
<h3>Cosmetics Association Seeks National Cosmetics Samples</h3>
<p>To Transport Freshly and Display Widely for Promotion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cosmetics Trade Association issued a notice to all factory members yesterday regarding the transportation of fresh national cosmetics samples for display, stating, "Dear Sirs, On the 11th of this month, a letter was approved from the Secretariat of the China National Products Maintenance Association, stating, 'It has been found that our country's goods sold to Korea used to reach tens of millions of yuan in the past. However, since Japan implemented harsh taxation on Chinese goods, taxing them at a rate of 100%, except for a small number of goods that can be sold, most goods, such as silk, have not been able to be shipped for years. The number of people in our country's industrial and commercial circles who have been devastated is no less than several million. Although the government has made efforts to negotiate and revise the tax rate to 70%, it is still too far apart compared to the 8% tax rate levied on Japanese goods. Fortunately, the term of this agreement is three years, and excluding the past year, it is only effective for two years. Our association plans to take advantage of this period to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convene relevant industrial and commercial groups to conduct detailed research on the points that should be revised in this Sino-Japanese commercial treaty so that it can be submitted at the time and negotiated with Japan for proper handling. On the other hand, with the consent of Mr. Zhang Weicheng, the Consul General stationed in Korea, we are collecting samples of our country's exquisite national products and transporting them to the Consulate General stationed in Korea to select a site to establish a China National Products Exhibition Hall so that we can invite overseas Chinese and local people from all walks of life to visit the hall from time to time to make them understand and recognize and develop their faith and desire to purchase. This is the first step in preparing for the restoration of trade with Korea and is an essential task. Moreover, Consul General Zhang has returned to Shanghai on official business and will be staying for a few more days. Therefore, we are sending you this special letter to request that you quickly compile and number the samples of exquisite new and old goods, clearly state the factory name, location, trademark, value, etc., on a separate sheet of paper, and properly package them and send them to our association at Gaodun Street, Nine Acres, this port by the 25th of this month for inspection and collection so that they can be transferred to Consul General Zhang to be displayed fresh and restore their inherent glory and re-display the glory of the country. The time is short, and opportunity waits for no one. We hope that you will handle this as soon as possible and do not delay. We are deeply looking forward to it.' In view of this, our country's domestic cosmetic products are still in their infancy, and overseas trade has not been fully developed. We can take this opportunity to transport them freshly and promote them widely in order to arouse the patriotic sentiments of overseas Chinese and to recover the outflow of rights and interests, which will have considerable effect. Therefore, we are sending you this letter to request that your company quickly compile and number the samples of exquisite goods, clearly state the factory name, location, trademark, value, etc., on a separate sheet of paper, and properly package them and send them to our association for inspection and collection by the 24th of this month so that they can be compiled and transported fresh. We are eagerly awaiting your prompt action."</p>

<h3>Jing'an Temple Fair on Buddha's Birthday</h3>
<p>The Stall Setting Incident Resolved Satisfactorily</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Allowed to Follow Past Practice</p>
<p>The ancient Jing'an Temple is a famous scenic spot in western Shanghai with many historical sites. During the Buddha's Birthday temple fair (Bathing the Buddha Festival) each year, the temple is crowded with people burning incense and sightseeing. Thousands of farmers and workers from the interior gather to set up stalls to sell their self-made local products to earn a living, resembling an exhibition of national products and local specialties. This year, the Municipal Council issued a notice restricting stall settings, causing panic among the stall vendors. They specially organized a stall vendors' association and petitioned for assistance from various parties. The abbot of Jing'an Temple, Zhifa, has repeatedly negotiated, and Shanghai gentry Du Yuesheng and Gu Jiatang, as well as local gentry Wang Hancheng, Gong Yifei, Xu Wenyuan, and the Citizens' Federation, have warmly assisted. The temple received a reply from the Municipal Council yesterday, agreeing to consider the livelihoods of the common people and allowing stall settings according to past practice. The reply from the Municipal Council and the announcement from Jing'an Temple are recorded below.</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple Announcement Regarding the Announcement: This temple will hold a grand event on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month to commemorate the birthday of our Buddha Sakyamuni. The setting up of stalls by various vendors has been a long-standing practice. This year, the Municipal Council suddenly issued a notice restricting it. After repeated efforts to argue and negotiate with the Municipal Council by this temple, and with the assistance of various circles, the Municipal Council finally understood and agreed to allow stall settings according to past practice, from the third day to the ninth day of the fourth lunar month. We hope that all stall vendors will set up stalls and conduct business as usual. In addition to thanking all those who have assisted us, we are afraid that we have not informed everyone. This announcement is hereby made. Abbot Zhifa</p>
<p>Municipal Council Reply Dear Sirs, Your letter of May 7th regarding the issue of restricting stall settings has been received. The Municipal Council's order was to remedy the obstruction of traffic and public inconvenience at the temple fair in recent years. Now, because of the expression to the representatives of the vendors that it would disrupt their livelihoods, the Municipal Council has decided to extend the implementation of this order.</p>
<h3>Sand and Mud Donation Collection Shipmates Gathered and Created a Disturbance</h3>
<p>More Than Two Hundred People Surrounded the Inspection Office</p>
<p>The Office Staff Fled at the News</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department authorized an office to issue sand mining and transportation permits. Recently, an inspection office was set up on Wusong Wai Malu to collect sand and stone donations, with each ton costing seven jiao. A few days ago, dozens of sand and mud boats arrived at Wusongkou one after another. The director of the inspection office, Wang Bingheng, immediately sent personnel to board the boats on patrol ships to inspect them and order them to pay the donation according to the regulations. However, the sand and mud boats believed that this fee was similar to likin and refused to pay during the anti-likin period, causing an argument. The shipmates Dan Wencheng, Ying Agui, and seven others were detained ashore and held at the Seventh District Public Security Bureau. After hearing the news, the sand and mud boats were greatly indignant and gathered more than two hundred shipmates to rush to the inspection office at about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. With great momentum, they immediately tore down the sign in front of the office and threw it away, declaring that they wanted to retrieve the detained shipmates. The office staff had already fled in advance at the news, so they were not beaten. Officer Li of the Seventh District Public Security Bureau led police to the scene to dissuade them, but because there were so many of them, there was no way to stop them for a while. Then, Shen Risheng, a standing committee member of the Eighth District Party Department, dissuaded them and notified the office to immediately release the seven shipmates held at the Public Security Bureau to avoid causing trouble. The shipmates then left in disappointment, and the storm subsided. The sand and mud boats have successively sailed into Shanghai yesterday to unload and sell their goods.</p>
<h3>Policeman Shot and Injured a Woman on the Street While Chasing a Bicycle</h3>
<p>The Policeman Claimed It Was an Accidental Injury</p>
<p>The Woman Suffered a Baseless Disaster</p>
<p>At 1:30 PM yesterday, a gunshot was heard near the intersection of Gonghe Road and Meiyuan Road in Zhabei. Police Officer Lü Rongxiang of the Sixth Precinct of the Second Section of the Fourth District thought it was a robbery and went towards the sound. He saw a woman lying on the ground with a gunshot wound, blood gushing from her right leg. At that time, there were two suspicious-looking people in front of him, running away frantically. The policeman desperately chased after them. Patrol Officers Gao Zhilin and Cao Jingui, who were in charge of the area and were distributing household registration forms, helped to apprehend the two people. They found a pistol on the spot, containing five bullets, and detained them together. The injured woman was sent to the hospital for treatment. Chief He interrogated the person in possession of the gun, who confessed that his name was Liu Yongxiang, from Baoshan, 30 years old, residing at No. 331 Datong Road. He was formerly a patrol officer of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau and had recently been supplemented to the detective team. The pistol belonged to Han Maosheng, a police officer in the Fourth District. Today, Han asked him to hide it for him because he had something to do. While passing by Meiyuan Road, a friend, Chen Amao (the other person arrested), was chasing after someone stealing a bicycle. He was helping him chase after the thief when the gun hidden in his waist suddenly fell to the ground, causing him to accidentally injure a pedestrian. He asked for leniency. He also presented his detective license from the Municipal Public Security Bureau for inspection. Chen's confession was similar to Liu's. Chief He then ordered the police to investigate the condition of the injured person in the hospital. It was found that the injured person was Zhang Jishi, from Yangzhou, 36 years old, residing at No. 2 Minli Road. She had a wound on her leg but was not in serious condition. She was bandaged and discharged from the hospital. Because the case involved a gunshot injury to a pedestrian, a report was prepared and submitted to the Judicial Section for review.</p>
<h3>Fire in Wuzhou Road, a Baby Burned to Death</h3>
<p>Everyone Was Busy Escaping</p>
<p>And Unable to Care for the Child</p>
<p>At 10:20 AM yesterday, a single-building house at No. 464 Hexingli, Wuzhou Road, suddenly caught fire, burning one room on the upper floor. When the fire broke out, the residents of the house were too eager to escape and were unable to carry out a swaddled baby, causing it to be buried in the flames. After the Fire Brigade rushed to extinguish the fire, they found the body of the dead child. The head, neck, arms, and other parts were charred beyond recognition, which was heartbreaking. The body was taken to Tongren Hospital for examination.</p>
<h3>A Confusing and Perplexing Marital Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Huan Longbao Accused of Abduction</p>
<p>His Father Invites a Matchmaker to Shanghai as Witness</p>
<p>Claiming It Was a Formal Wedding</p>
<p>Xu Binglong Firmly Denies It</p>
<p>Huan Longbao, son of a farmer from Meijiazhuang Village, Xinghua County, Jiangbei, and Zhao Di, the seventeen-year-old daughter of Xu Binglong, a farmer from Xiejiazhuang Village, Gaoyou County, a neighboring county, came to Shanghai last winter and resided at the home of their relative Sun Fulan at 235 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, claiming to be husband and wife. Until last month, Xu Binglong suddenly reported to the local police that Huan and Sun had conspired to abduct his daughter and forcibly rape her. Zhao Di also denied having a marital relationship with Huan. The police then arrested Huan and Sun and brought them to the Special District Local Court. During the interrogation, Huan stated that Zhao Di was indeed his formally wedded wife, having married her in their hometown in August of last year, and that they subsequently came to Shanghai together. The judge ordered Huan and Sun to be detained pending the dispatch of letters to Xinghua and Gaoyou counties to investigate the matter. At this time, Xu Binglong received a letter from his elderly mother urging him to return home, so he took advantage of the official investigation period and hastily returned to his hometown. However, after arriving home, he learned the reason for his mother's summons: his wife had also been abducted by Huan Longbao's elder brother, known as "Little Hu," and had disappeared without a trace despite repeated searches. Unable to remain away from his duties in Shanghai for long, he had to leave his elderly mother alone at home. When he recently returned to Shanghai, the court had already received replies from Xinghua and Gaoyou counties. However, the information differed significantly. The Xinghua reply stated that Huan Longbao and Zhao Di were indeed formally husband and wife and included a marriage certificate. The Gaoyou reply stated that Xu Binglong's address could not be verified, and it was even more difficult to ascertain whether his daughter had been married to Huan. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao opened the court for a continued hearing. Huan Longbao's father, Huan Zhuping, specially invited the original matchmaker, Wang Yuzhang, to the court to testify. The judge first informed the plaintiff, Xu Binglong, of the contents of the Xinghua letter and presented the marriage certificate for his review. However, Xu still firmly denied ever agreeing to give his daughter in marriage to Huan's son. Zhao Di also echoed her father's statement. Subsequently, Huan Zhuping testified that he was seventy-five years old and had two sons, Little Hu and Longbao, both of whom had married. Longbao married Xu's daughter on August 16th of last year in their hometown. The matchmakers were Wang Yuzhang, Gao Yuemei, and Yao Sifa, and the total bride price was eighty yuan, paid in two installments. Later, on October 10th, his second son brought his daughter-in-law to Shanghai. This time, he had intended to invite all the matchmakers to court, but Gao and Yao were busy with farming and unable to leave. Only Wang Yuzhang was brought to testify. Wang stated that the two families lived only five or six miles apart and were well-acquainted. Therefore, they acted as matchmakers for the two families at that time, and everyone in the two villages knew about the wedding. How could it be a fabrication? The judge then inquired about the recent abduction of Xu Binglong's wife by Little Hu. Wang replied that he did not know about this. Thereupon, Xu testified that he had never met Wang Yuzhang and that his words were hardly believable. The marriage certificate attached by Xinghua County was also insufficient evidence, as it was obtained by county officials investigating the defendant's home and could have been copied from another marriage certificate by the defendant's family. He also retained lawyer Yuan Yang'an to state the reasons, saying that if Huan had married Xu's daughter as his wife, then it would be impossible for the legal wife to accuse her own husband of seduction and rape. Based on this point alone, it could be known that there was no marriage. The court believed that further investigation was necessary in this case and ordered the two defendants, Huan and Sun, to be remanded in custody, and the rest were dismissed to await investigation and further hearing.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Bans Zangqiao Road Xiangyuan Lane Artesian Well</h3>
<p>Supplying Residents Beyond Property Owners</p>
<p>And Urges Switching to Tap Water</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities previously discovered that the artesian well set up by the owner, Taichang Company, in Xiangyuan Lane, 96 Zangqiao Road, Yinxiang District, also supplied residents of Hengxingfang and Dechang Lane on Zhangjiaxiang Road, violating the regulations of the city's Detailed Rules for Registration of Water Supply Equipment Self-Installed by Property Owners. The bureau ordered the owner to remove the well pipes on Zhangjiaxiang Lane and Zhangjiaxiang Road and switch to Zhabei tap water to comply with the regulations. However, the owner delayed in complying, so the bureau decided to stop the use of the well, and all residents of Xiangyuan Lane were also required to use tap water. It is heard that, considering the daily needs of the residents, the bureau ordered Xianghua Electric Company to stop supplying electricity to the well's motor from May 23rd, so that the owner could switch over at their leisure without causing panic among the residents due to water outages.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing in the Huang Xianzhong Forged Check Case</h3>
<p>Chen Zaifeng and Wang Zhiyuan Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Chen Ziquan and Huang Xianzhong Released on Bail</p>
<p>The case of the Riye Bank was continued yesterday morning at the French Concession Court. Chen Zaifeng and Wang Zhiyuan of the Wanchun Silver Syndicate were present. Lawyer Peng Qi represented them, arguing that Huang Xianzhong had signed the checks on his own and that Chen Zaifeng and others had not induced him. The transfer of funds in Riye Bank did not harm the rights of Riye Bank, but it did cause losses to the Wanchun Silver Syndicate. Huang Xianzhong's defense lawyer, Tan Yigong, stated that the truth of Huang Xianzhong signing the checks was that Chen Ziquan came on January 18th to request Huang Chu-jiu to countersign the checks to complete the transfer procedure, which Huang Chu-jiu agreed to. On the 19th, Chen came again to request the countersigning. Huang Chu-jiu, being seriously ill and unable to hold a pen, ordered Huang Xianzhong to sign on his behalf and handed it to Chen Ziquan to take away. Chen Zaifeng, Wang Zhiyuan, and others were all present at the scene. Huang Xianzhong signed on behalf of his father at the request of Chen Ziquan, the manager of Riye Bank, with his father's consent, merely to complete the transfer procedure. He did not withdraw any cash and did not gain any benefit from it. It did not cause any damage to Riye Bank. The funds transferred to Wanchun were still designated for payment to Riye Bank and were not used for his own purposes. Therefore, this act of signing on behalf of his father with the consent of all parties should not be considered a crime. He requested that the case be dismissed. The accountant requested a strict investigation of Chen Ziquan's alteration and destruction of accounting books. Judge Zhu adjourned the hearing due to the lateness of the hour and ordered a rescheduling. Chen Zaifeng and Wang Zhiyuan were found not guilty. Chen Ziquan, Huang Xianzhong, and others remained released on bail. The defense statement of Huang Xianzhong is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Shanghai Riye Bank's fraudulent transfer of funds, I hereby submit a defense and request that it be verified and pronounced innocent. The financial dealings between Shanghai Riye Bank and my family were always managed by my late father, Huang Chu-jiu. I never handled them personally. Regarding the five checks issued on January 19th of this year, totaling over one million yuan, it is true that I signed those checks when my late father was terminally ill, on the day of his death. Chen Ziquan, the manager of Riye Bank, and others brought a new checkbook to my home and requested my late father to consent to sign the above checks to complete the transfer procedure. At that time, my late father was severely ill and unable to sign personally. He ordered me to sign on his behalf. Chen Ziquan and others declared to me that this was to complete the already transferred procedure and did not involve withdrawing cash, and that there were no conflicts of interest. They urged me to sign and hand it over to Chen Ziquan for safekeeping. When my father was on the verge of death, I was overwhelmed with grief and pain. I could not choose between the existence of the transfer of interests, and the appropriateness of signing on behalf of the check, especially by the order of my father, what choice can I make in a hurry? And many of the people at the scene were my father's friends, and they all said it was a legitimate procedure. Therefore, I followed the consensus and signed the checks on behalf of my father, purely out of passivity, and not autonomously. At the time of signing on behalf of my father, I had no intention of greedily obtaining improper benefits, nor did I have the intention of harming the interests of others. Now, I would like to separately clarify the important points of the trial regarding my part, namely (1) the act of signing on behalf of my father, and (2) the transfer caused the debt with mortgage rights of Riye Bank to become a debt without mortgage rights, as follows: (1) The checks signed by me on behalf of my father were because the manager Chen Ziquan, after the transfer, requested my late father to agree and issue checks to complete the transfer procedure, and it was not that I used the checks to withdraw cash from the bank. This has been recognized as a fact in this case. What should be studied is whether my act of following my father's order to sign these checks on his behalf constitutes a crime. The act of payment stated on the check was originally the right and obligation of my late father. I was originally the heir to that right and obligation. A son signing on behalf of his father is different from the act of signing a check on behalf of others. Moreover, at the time of signing on behalf of my father, Chen Ziquan, the manager of Riye Bank, and others requested my late father to agree and ordered me to sign on his behalf, which is even less comparable to a private forgery. There is no formal provision in criminal law that recognizes it as constituting a crime. Even if the issuance of this check hinders the rights and obligations of others, it is, at most, an invalid act in civil law, and cannot involve the scope of criminal detention, let alone be compared with the act of forging, altering, or destroying accounting books. The matter is very clear. (2) The transfer of funds in Riye Bank had already been transferred by Manager Chen Ziquan with my late father's consent before I signed the checks on his behalf. The propriety of the transfer does not involve me, so there is no need to argue about it. However, the accountant's accusation is that the transfer caused the debt with mortgage rights of Riye Bank to become a debt without mortgage rights, which damaged the interests of Riye Bank and its creditors. The mortgaged goods (i.e., property deeds, etc.) were originally owned by my late father and were handed over to Riye Bank for mortgage to Siming and China Industrial Bank to obtain banknotes of 800,000 yuan. Later, due to the financial difficulties of Riye Bank, my late father, during his lifetime, transferred the aforementioned mortgaged goods, together with additional mortgaged goods, to Wanchun Silver Syndicate for a loan of 300,000 yuan, all of which was agreed to be fully allocated to Riye Bank to repay the debt. It is different from the situation of transferring the cash for personal use or for other purposes. Therefore, this kind of behavior does not actually harm the interests of Riye Bank itself and its creditors at all. As for the account allocation and payment of the mortgage amount by Wanchun Silver Syndicate, it is a breach of contract by Wanchun Silver Syndicate. My late father and I should not bear any responsibility. Moreover, all the inheritance of my late father has been handed over to repay the debt in full. There is no intention of benefiting myself and harming others. There is no such thing as making a debt with mortgage rights into a debt without mortgage rights. Furthermore, considering that the accountant who exercised the right to accuse in this case did not consider the act of me signing on behalf of my father to be a crime or add an accusation, it is sufficient to show that the behavior related to me does not constitute a crime and is not doubtful. Based on the above reasons, I humbly request that the court carefully examine the part of this case where I signed the check on behalf of my father, and pronounce me innocent. This would be fair and convenient. Submitted to the Shanghai French Concession Court for public inspection on May 14th, 20th year of the Republic of China. Petitioner Huang Xianzhong, Defense Lawyer Tan Yigong.</p>

<h3>A Car违章 Speeds and Breaks Chief of Staff's Right Leg</h3>
<p>Huang Quanshan, Chief of Staff of the 26th Division of the Army, a native of Sichuan, 42 years old, was getting off a tram in front of the New World in the Public Concession yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM. Suddenly, a business car No. 12127 of the National Automobile Company, driven by Lu Jisheng (45 years old, Ningbo native), drove from south to north. The driver sped across the road without waiting for the street police to turn on the green light, causing Huang to be unable to avoid it. The wheels ran over and broke his right leg, causing him to bleed profusely and collapse. The police officer No. 1225 from the Old Gate Police Station arrived and sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Huang's right leg may be permanently disabled.</p>
<h3>French Concession Tram Ticket Seller Beats Passenger</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, Xu Yaolin, a escort guard from the China Merchants Bureau South Pier Inspection Office, was riding the French Concession Route 2 tram to the 16th Pier station. The tram had not yet stopped, but the ticket seller No. 36 drove Xu off the tram. Xu replied that he could get off after the tram stopped. The ticket seller uttered rude words and cursed Xu as a pig, and pushed Xu hard from behind, causing Xu to fall from the tram onto the road, injuring both his hands and head, causing him to bleed profusely. Xu grabbed the ticket seller No. 36 and wanted to go to the Xiaodongmen Police Station together. However, there were more than ten people gathered at the tram station where the ticket sellers gathered, and they all beat Xu together, injuring his whole body. Xu suffered a great loss and returned to his team to summon his police team to seek revenge. The matter was known to Deputy Director Qiao Songren, who, fearing a major disaster because the escort guards were all equipped with guns, immediately went and confiscated all the defensive guns of the escort guards. Then, he accompanied the injured Xu Yaolin to report to the police station, stating that he was innocently beaten by the tram ticket seller. After the police chief observed that Xu Yaolin did have injuries, he ordered him to go to the hospital for treatment and reported to the head office to negotiate with the French Tram Company, requesting that the ticket sellers who committed the assault be severely punished as a warning.</p>
<h3>Russian Pushes Over Chinese, Causing Injury</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Ten Days of Detention</p>
<p>Shi Wenkai, a Shanghai native who works as an English secretary at the Salt Affairs Audit Office, went to the Public Concession Public Bus Company to purchase a monthly ticket on May 1st. While waiting to buy the ticket, a Russian named Pi Pei'er Gaosiji also went to buy the ticket at the same time. Because the ticket buyers were quite crowded, the Russian wanted to be the first to buy the ticket, so he used his hands to forcefully separate the people standing in front of him. The first person to bear the brunt was Shi Wenkai. Shi reasoned with him, and he pushed Shi to the ground, injuring his right knee. He went to Dr. Diao Xinde for treatment. Shi believed that foreigners bullying Chinese people had become a habit, and if there was no serious negotiation, it would be unimaginable in the future. Therefore, he sued in the Special District Court, requesting that he be punished for the crime of obstructing freedom and causing injury. Judge Xiao opened the court for trial yesterday. After the plaintiff stated the case, Liu Xisan, an advisor at the China Merchants Bureau Sorting Office, testified as a witness. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff rushed ahead from behind at the time and first bumped with his shoulder, so he pushed back and knocked him down. When asked if he had any witnesses, he replied that there was only one Westerner at the time, and he did not know his address. The rest were all Chinese, who would certainly not be willing to testify for him. As for the doctor's injury certificate, he also did not believe that there was a criminal act, and the fall was only a minor injury. Maybe the doctor wrote it more severely. Judge Xiao verified the confession and believed that there was evidence of a crime. He sentenced him to ten days of detention in court, otherwise, a fine of twenty yuan as a warning.</p>

<h3>Ye Chen Case Attempts Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Instructions from the French Concession Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Ye Zhongfang and his mother, Ye Pengshi, and his wife, Ye Lushi, etc., previously retained lawyers Dong Yu, Zhu Qinqing, Jiang Yiping, etc., to file a criminal complaint in the French Concession Court against the dancer Chen Xiuzhen for injury and fraud. Chen Xiuzhen also retained lawyer Yao Zhaodi to countersue for abandonment and false accusations. Yesterday, they were summoned again. First, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, Ye Zhongfang, stated that this case was initially filed because Ye Zhongfang was beaten and injured by Chen Xiuzhen and went missing. Therefore, the plaintiff Zhongfang's biological mother and legal wife asked our lawyers to file a lawsuit. Later, Pengshi and her daughter-in-law received a letter from Zhongfang and an injury certificate proving the defendant's injury behavior. The defendant filed a complaint in the Special District Court of the Public Concession. After Ye Zhongfang came to Shanghai for questioning, the two parties' relationship was not bad. Therefore, they requested that the lawsuit</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>be withdrawn so that the two parties could reconcile. Chen Xiuzhen's lawyer Yao stated that this case was entirely due to Ye Zhongfang's desire to abandon the old and take the new, which led to this lawsuit. As for the plaintiff's accusation that Ye Zhongfang was injured by the defendant, Ye and Chen had a very good relationship, and the defendant is a woman. How could she have beaten him? The accusation has no basis. Please investigate. Judge Zhu instructed both parties to try to reconcile.</p>
<h3>Electric Military Line Interrupted</h3>
<p>A Young Man in a Suit Almost Electrocuted</p>
<p>Trams on All Routes Turn Back Halfway</p>
<p>The tram main line at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road in the Public Concession suddenly broke yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM. When the line fell, a young man in a suit was passing by and it fell on his shoulder. Fortunately, he was not electrocuted, but he was greatly frightened. The direct trams on routes 5, 6, and 7 to the North Railway Station and the trolleybuses to Hongkou were temporarily suspended. They had to turn around south of the Special District Local Court on North Zhejiang Road. The passengers got off the bus one after another, abandoning the fare for one stop. Some hired rickshaws, some walked, and they went to the station one after another, sighing in vain. The tram company was informed and immediately ordered workers to rush to the scene to repair the connection. It took several hours to restore traffic.</p>
<h3>Summary of Housing Disputes</h3>
<p>Guangxing Lane: The tenant association of the Wulifang building on Peng Road held an emergency joint meeting of all executive supervisors at the association at 2:00 PM yesterday because the landlord had not withdrawn the order to increase the rent after two letters of request. More than 50 people attended, chaired by Tang Huilian. After the formalities were completed, the chairman announced the landlord's second reply and then discussed the following: (1) The plan to actively prepare for countermeasures was divided into four methods: (A) Ask legal counsel to be responsible for negotiations. (B) Ask the Shanghai Special District Citizens Association and the Hongkou Tenant General Association to provide impartial assistance. (C) During the unresolved time, all rents will be paid according to the original amount. If the landlord does not accept it, it will be properly deposited in Wing On Bank, and the association will issue a notice to all tenants. (D) According to the order issued by the Nanjing National Government, Shanghai Municipal Government, and Shanghai Municipal Council on June 27, 1927, landlords must not increase rents without reason, and tenants must not reduce rents on the pretext. Should we submit a request to ban the landlord's disregard for the authorities' orders this time? It was decided to submit a jointly signed request to achieve the goal. (2) The economic issue was decided to be discussed next time, but all current miscellaneous expenses should be temporarily advanced by the economic section. (3) Should we publish a statement denying the case? It was decided to have a legal advisor represent the denial. (4) Other proposals. The meeting did not end until after 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tongxing Lane: The housing dispute in Tongxing Lane on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession has lasted for many days. The landlord sent dozens of Russians to demolish the house the day before yesterday. The tenants came forward to stop them, but due to language barriers, a misunderstanding arose and a conflict occurred. The Russian leader directed all the Russians to use force. The tenants, unable to resist, immediately called the police for help. One Russian leader, in his haste to chase the tenants, tripped and fell on the side of the street, hitting his head and bleeding. Those who were watching on the road laughed at him. The Russian became even more ashamed and angry, and grabbed someone walking on the road, pointing to him as the one who beat him. The police arrived and took the man and the Russian to the Big Ben Police Station together. Then, the police sent someone to summon the tenants to the writing room to inquire about the truth. After the tenant representatives explained the situation, the police rebuked the Russians and ordered them not to do such things again in the future. However, the man on the road was designated by the Russian as the one who caused him to fall, and was detained by the police for several hours.</p>
<p>Baoan Lane: Regarding the rent dispute in Baoan Lane on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, here is the company's reply to the tenants: We are replying to your letter. We have learned everything. Since our company purchased the houses in Baoan Lane, the relationship with the tenants has been extremely harmonious. However, since last year, the tenants have repeatedly requested repairs, and some have said that the company should be responsible for any dangers. Some have also proposed to deduct the repair costs from the rent. Our company has repeatedly sent people to estimate the cost of repairs, which is about 200 taels of land for each building. If calculated based on rent, the loss will be as much as one year. Our company, in order to respect the tenants, cannot but agree to repair, but the loss is too great, and there is hesitation in proceeding. Therefore, although the notice was limited to May 5th, work has not yet started. Now that the executive directors have formally requested a postponement of repairs on behalf of the tenants, our company may not disagree, but it is hoped that the following two conditions can be implemented before we can proceed: (1) All rent arrears must be paid in full, with written proof that no claims will be made against our company for disrepair in the future. This most legitimate and minimum requirement, I believe your representatives must have the right to handle. Your representatives must know that the property belongs to the landlord, and all dispositions have special privileges, which cannot be demanded by the tenants. This time, for the sake of harmonious relations, we are making a special step. I hope you will understand. If the above two conditions cannot be fulfilled, then our company will have to take appropriate actions based on the law of ownership. Is it feasible? Please reply.</p>
<h3>Tram Company Mechanics Demand Bail for Fellow Workers</h3>
<p>The mechanics of the Public Concession Tram Company's factory went on strike on the morning of the 14th to demand the release of arrested workers. The mechanics from the factories on Bubbling Well Road, Hart Road, and Yangtzepoo Road, totaling about 500 people, joined the strike, demanding the release of Qiao Shengfa, a worker who was arrested by the police station on May 11th. However, the workers still went to work as usual the day before yesterday. It was not until around 3:00 PM that the mechanics in the factories on Bubbling Well Road and other roads announced a slowdown. The company immediately reported to the police station and ordered detectives to be stationed at the entrances of the copper shops on Bubbling Well Road and Hart Road as a precaution. The workers then sent representatives to contact the company, still using the bail of Qiao Shengfa as a condition for resuming work. The company replied that the company and the Concession Police Station are both foreign and have a good relationship, and have nothing to do with the Public Security Bureau. If Qiao is detained at the police station, we can try to help, but it is really difficult to approve of the fact that he is now detained at the Public Security Bureau. It is not intentionally making things difficult, but it is a factual impossibility. The coppersmiths once wanted to contact the ticket sellers and drivers to go on strike together, but they did not achieve their goal. Now, some workers understand the company's difficulties and are quite hopeful of returning to their old ways, so the labor tide will not expand and there may be hope for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Training Management Talent</h3>
<p>Xu Peihuang's Speech at the Industrial and Commercial Management Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its eighth luncheon discussion meeting yesterday afternoon at the United Chinese Association. They invited Mr. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, to give a speech entitled "The Problem of Training Management Talent." Those present included Xu Peihuang, Guo Bingwen, Fang Jiaobo, Li Zhaoshuai, Shou Jingwei, Wu Qingtai, Chen Da, Wu Yun Chu, Li Zufan, He Qingru, Tao Leqin, Cao Yunxiang, Pan Wenan, Gu Xun, Wu Kejia, Ji Jiannan, Zhu Yinjiang, Chen En'yi, Chen Wan Yun, Zhao Shutong, Kong Shi'e, Shi Jiuyun, Liu Musu, Zhang Ziyuan, Li Yunliang, Shen Junsheng, Le Yuanzhang, Huang Zhongming, Chang Bicheng, Xu Chao, etc. Dr. Kong Yongzhi, the chairman, was absent due to official business. Member Shou Jingwei was temporarily elected as chairman. After the meal, the chairman delivered the opening remarks, followed by Mr. Xu Peihuang's speech, which mainly emphasized that during training, attention should be paid to aspects such as thought, initiative, morality, responsibility, duty, etiquette, obedience, and punctuality. Although China has many talented individuals, their sense of responsibility seems somewhat weak. If everyone is willing to take responsibility, there will be significant benefits to both the economy and time, and so on. Subsequently, Mr. Pan Wenan proposed that the training of management talent is indeed very important, and suggested whether the Industrial and Commercial Management Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Bankers' Association could jointly organize a training institute for management personnel. After discussion, Pan Wenan, He Qingru, and Cao Yunxiang were publicly elected to draft the organizational outline and solicit opinions from all parties. If there is unanimous agreement, they will then discuss joint measures with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association. The meeting adjourned at 2:15 PM.</p>
<h3>Dismissal of Navigation Staff of the Inland Rivers Merchant Bureau</h3>
<p>The Inland Rivers Merchant Bureau was leased by the Zhejiang Provincial Government in June of last year to revitalize inland river navigation. Chen Shuntong, Zhang Yangsheng, and Sheng Qunian were appointed to be in charge, under the jurisdiction of the Department of Construction. After painstaking management, some success was achieved. However, with the reorganization of the provincial government and Shi Ying succeeding as the Director of the Zhejiang Department of Construction, due to financial constraints in Zhejiang Province, austerity measures were implemented, reducing the operating expenses for construction projects by more than eight million yuan annually. The Inland Rivers Merchant Bureau also dispatched Shi Zhaoji to Shanghai to reorganize. After taking office, Shi began to wind down operations, gradually leasing out all shipping routes. The main routes of the Shanghai Bureau, such as the Shenhu Line, the Shensu Line, and the Shenhang Line, were also leased out by Shi Zhaoji after meetings with various shipping merchants. After many days of negotiations, these three routes have now been completely leased to merchants. The Shenhu Line was leased to the Lixing Company, the Shensu Line was leased by no one, and the Shenhang Line was leased to Dai Shengchang. As of yesterday, the three main routes were completely handed over to the leaseholders. The Inland Rivers Bureau has leased out all twenty-one routes and no longer operates any ships itself. At the same time, the business office of the Shanghai Inland Rivers Steamboat Company was also closed, and all navigation department staff, totaling more than twenty people, were dismissed yesterday. Their salaries for this month were paid, and they were immediately ordered to leave the bureau. A management office was established in Shanghai, its business limited to collecting rent. Other staff, such as customs brokers and warehouse staff, were also dismissed. The office now has only six people. It has been exactly one year since Zhang Jingjiang leased the bureau last year, and the grand plan to revitalize inland navigation has now been fundamentally abandoned.</p>
<h3>Steamboat Smuggling Cases</h3>
<p>Military Supplies: The French cargo ship "Yulu," which arrived in Shanghai from Marseille, Europe, entered the port at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Customs officers boarded the ship for inspection and found twenty-three smuggled handguns, each with one hundred rounds of ammunition, totaling 2,300 rounds, in the ship's coal bunker. The customs officers seized the guns and ammunition and confiscated them, while investigating the smugglers for prosecution.</p>
<p>Grain: The Chinese steamship "Daxing" left Shanghai for Vladivostok yesterday. Upon leaving Shanghai, eighty-five bags of smuggled white rice were discovered. The customs authorities, noting that it had not been reported, considered it to be smuggled for export and immediately seized it. A barge was dispatched to seize the rice and unload it into the customs warehouse, pending discussion of penalties.</p>
<h3>Concrete Measures to Ban Japanese Fishing Vessels</h3>

<p>The Chinese Seamen's Industrial Federation sent a notice yesterday to its various branches stating that the Central Training Department of the Chinese Nationalist Party issued Order No. 15136, stating: "Previously, this association reported that Japanese fishing vessels were using Chinese traitors to hoist our national flag and plunder marine products, requesting review and instructions for prompt handling. This matter was reported to the National Government Secretariat and submitted for review. Now, a reply has been received stating: 'Greetings, Your Department's letter No. 14842 regarding the Chinese Seamen's Union Federation Organizing Committee's report that Japanese fishing vessels are using Chinese traitors to hoist our national flag and plunder marine products, requesting transfer for prompt handling, has been received and acknowledged. This matter was submitted to the National Government for approval, stating the investigation and reply. Regarding the protection of fisheries, the Executive Yuan previously submitted a proposal from the Ministry of Industry, which was reviewed by the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Navy, and then reported back. This was then submitted to the 17th State Council meeting for resolution, instructing the relevant ministries to properly plan for protection and requesting the National Government to exempt fishing taxes and fishery taxes, which the government has already ordered to be uniformly exempted. Subsequently, Shi Renhang, Zhuang Songfu, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government telegraphed that Japanese fishing vessels were invading our territorial waters, requesting the dispatch of warships for protection. These matters were all submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved for reply, and were also submitted to the 21st State Council meeting for resolution, in accordance with the review opinions of the Ministries of Industry, Finance, and Navy at the 17th State Council meeting. However, the leasing of vessels should be changed to having the Navy dispatch two warships to patrol and protect, and the Ministries of Industry, Finance, and Navy should still promptly formulate an overall plan to effectively handle the matter. Now, approval has been granted based on the previous reasons, and the related investigation report is enclosed for reference.' The original investigation report is enclosed. This is to inform the association, and a copy of the original investigation report is enclosed with this order for the association's information. This order is issued to all departments, and a copy of the attachment is sent with this document for the association's information. This order is issued on the fifth month of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, by Chairman Zhao Zhizhi, Committee Members Lin Yinsheng, Liang Degong, Huang Yushu, and Miao Shuizhang."</p>
<h3>Wang Yinfu Implicated in the Ningbo Opium Case</h3>
<p>Wang Yinfu, an accountant from Cixi at the Yuanyu Silver Shop in Pentang Lane, secretly purchased opium from Shanghai, mixed it with other goods, and shipped it to Ningbo for sale by steamboat. He also contacted the local opium dealer Mao Aru in Ningbo. When the opium arrived, he would retrieve it. Recently, the matter was exposed, and Mao was arrested by the Yinxian police. During interrogation by the local court, Mao confessed that Wang was the mastermind. Because Wang was practicing in Shanghai and had repeatedly failed to appear when summoned, the court prepared an official letter and sent judicial police to Shanghai to request the assistance of the Shanghai Special District Court's police to arrest and bring him to court for trial. Yesterday, the police arrested Wang and sent him to the Special Court, while Wang hired lawyer Wu Linkun to defend him, stating that the defendant was a respectable merchant and that this matter was likely a false accusation. He requested permission for the defendant to be released on bail and go to the Ningbo court to confront the accusers in person, to avoid immediate deportation. Judge Zhou immediately granted the request, ordering Wang Yinfu to post a bond of one thousand yuan and go to the Qin County Court within one week to await interrogation.</p>

<h3>Extravagant Tales from American Prohibition</h3>
<p>—Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>It is said that alcohol makes one immoral and weakens the nerves, because its numbing effect is very strong. The American ban on alcohol is very strict, and the fines are heavier than in other countries. Ordinary drinkers are not allowed to gather and drink heartily, which makes them very depressed. They hide a bottle of wine in the bottom of a boat during their weekends and sail to a place where the waves are vast and there are no traces of people. Then they sing wildly and drink freely, enjoying themselves all day long. But the hidden bottle of wine is discovered by the police after a long time, and the drinkers are arrested and get to experience the taste of jail. The timid dare not defy the law and buy Burmese wine tree fruit to eat, just to comfort themselves. The fruit of the wine tree is shaped like a coconut. When it is opened, the juice is white and sweet, with a slight taste of wine. Drinking too much can also make people drunk. However, it is expensive and difficult to buy. Then, they come up with a strange idea and make wine into dry powder, which is transported by women. They pretend to have their monthly period and cleverly hide the dry wine in their menstrual belts to avoid the eyes of the police. When it arrives, they mix it with water and it becomes fine wine. The anecdotes of banning alcohol are even more bizarre than the smuggling of opium in our country during the ban on opium. It is said that a rich man in New York, Lu Lixu, is so rich that he can do anything. He bought 10,000 jars of wine and poured them all into the pool. One day, he hosted a banquet for guests and had young women swim naked in the wine pool. The jade bodies were beautiful, and the wine was even more fragrant. The guests indulged themselves without restraint. When the wine was empty, the naked women scooped wine from the pool and filled it until the pool was dry. The naked women then got up and danced, the wine fragrance spreading and the spring scenery was full of vitality. His extravagance was unprecedented and outrageous. A friend who has lived in America for many years told me about this. He is also a drinker and said that getting wine in America is almost like getting jade nectar.</p>
<h3>Chaste Woman from a Brothel</h3>
<p>—Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>How can there be a chaste woman from a brothel? How can a chaste woman be in a brothel? But such a thing actually happened, which is also strange. According to the author, I once wrote an article entitled "The Poor Bride," which was published in this column. It recorded that Miss Lu from the neighbor's family guarded her chastity and married a dead person. The protagonist in this article is Miss Lu. After the woman swore to guard her chastity, she spent her lonely years. Time passed quickly, and three years passed in a flash. The woman's strange encounters were beyond her expectations and beyond her ability to bear. At first, the woman wept and married Mr. So-and-so. It was out of a sincere enthusiasm that she put everything aside, not to gain anything. The woman's mother-in-law got this unexpected woman and treated her very well on weekdays. All the food, clothing, and utensils were provided. And she was considerate and thoughtful. When she went out, she provided a car to travel, and when she entered, she had a record player to please her ears. But the mother-in-law's plan was actually very hopeful for the woman. The mother-in-law was a procuress and ran a brothel in Beili. The woman's residence was close to the brothel, so she could be influenced by what she saw and heard and gradually become a member of the brothel. But the woman accidentally entered the drunken and dreamy place and saw the charming and enchanting gestures of the women. She covered her face and ran away, ashamed to be with them. The woman guarded her body like jade and was not moved by the environment. Her mother-in-law was very angry when she got this stubborn woman. From then on, the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was like fire and water. In the winter of last year, the mother-in-law had no choice but to force the woman to move into the brothel, saying that since the woman came, the expenses had increased day by day and she had to take austerity measures to reduce expenses. The woman heard this and sobbed all night, saying that she would rather die than be a flower in a dirty place. The next day, she told her mother-in-law that she was going back to her hometown. When she left, the mother-in-law said sternly, "It's good that you're going back. Are there few people here who can eat your rice? But all the clothes and jewelry are owned by our family and you can't take them." Although the woman was reluctant, she had no choice. Now the woman has been back for several months. I have seen her cut her hair short and wear leather shoes, dressed in the latest fashion, but her face shows dimples and her charm is still there. The woman is still a pure and innocent girl. But she suddenly became a bride, suddenly became a chaste woman, and almost became a prostitute who sold her smiles. Now she has returned with broken wings. (She cannot live in peace and guard her chastity.) She has returned to her girlhood life. Her life has been extremely volatile and unpredictable. I don't know what her heart feels. But her father is confused and has not completely broken off with Mr. So-and-so. He has not sought a marriage partner for her, and he is also tight-lipped about it. There is no intention to seek a phoenix.</p>
<h3>The Train Waits for People</h3>
<p>—Ying Dai</p>
<p>When we go out traveling, we have to catch the train. We must follow the train schedule at the station, otherwise, if we are late by one minute, or even one second, the train will not wait for you for a moment. However, there is also a case where the train waits for people. Isn't that strange? It turns out that in Hyderabad, India, there is a man named Nizam. He is the richest man in the world. His family's property totals 200 billion US dollars. Behind his residence, there is a station with a private train parked there. Every day, it is always on fire as if it is about to leave. That is the case even if he does not want to go out. Someone asked him, and he said, "Should the train wait for people? Or should people wait for the train?" This way, whenever he wants to go out traveling, the train will start immediately and he doesn't have to wait.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Visit to Jin Xian Temple</h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Jin Xian Temple is the largest Buddhist temple in the Cixi County area. It was first built in the Ming Dynasty, to the west of Minghe field, on the shores of Baiyang Lake. The scenery is quite beautiful. Recently, I visited a friend in Cixi and took the opportunity to visit it. The temple faces south, backed by mountains and facing the lake. Built along the mountain, its atmosphere is imposing. In front is the mountain gate, leading to the Hall of the Heavenly Kings, where the Four Heavenly Kings are enshrined, representing favorable wind, seasonable weather, peace and abundant harvest. The statues are about twenty feet tall. Further in is the Grand Hall of the Great Hero, enshrining the Tathagata. The hall is deep and profound. A Buddhist ceremony was being performed at the time, with about twenty or thirty monks. The sounds of bells and chimes were melodious, and the smoke of incense swirled around. The sound of the chanting rose slowly, giving one the desire to transcend the world. Behind the hall stands the Great Merciful Guanyin Bodhisattva, standing upright. Further in is the Abbot's room, on the wall of which hangs a Buddhist painting by Bailongshan Ren, with a vivid spirit. I sipped tea here. The temple was rebuilt during the Guangxu era, so the beams and pillars still look new. Beside the hall are dozens of guest rooms, dining halls, and monks' quarters, interspersed with pines and cypresses. There are several dozen monks who chant sutras. Initially, residents often saw a golden-robed monk with a staff standing halfway up the mountain on moonlit nights. The bolder ones approached to look closely, but there was nothing there. They then knew it was a manifestation of the Buddha, and they raised money to build the temple. That is how it got its name. The mountain behind the temple is called Beiling Peak. The whole mountain is planted with pines, and the tombs are piled up, giving a sense of Beimang. Climbing to the top, Baiyang Lake is right at your feet, surrounded by mountains like a water basin. Reeds grow densely in the lake. The white water and green reeds reflect each other in exceptional beauty. Small boats drift leisurely, and water birds emerge and disappear, enough to be in a painting. The lake covers two hundred acres, fed by streams and valleys, so it is vast and seems boundless. Gazing at it, I don't know how many bushels of worldly dust were swept away. After descending, I returned along the embankment. A gentle breeze blew, stirring the water into roaring sounds, as if seeing me off. We live in the city every day, and the dust clogs our mouths and noses, making us want to choke. Compared to the fishermen, woodcutters, and shepherds who enjoy the mountain scenery and feast on the lake's beauty, what are their gains and losses? What are their gains and losses? Written after returning from Jin Xian Temple.</p>
<h3>A Clean Freak</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>Cleanliness is a virtue. However, too much of a good thing is as bad as too little. Not only will one not be loved and respected, but one will also incur resentment. Let me describe two cases to aid in conversation.</p>
<p>In Zhabei, there is a certain Mr. A who is a clean freak. He lives in a standalone house, and the rooms are exceptionally clean. The windows are bright and the tables are spotless, not a speck of dust to be seen. Even the floor is scrubbed daily, surpassing even the cleanliness of the Japanese tatami mats. The stairs leading to the upper floor, because the steps touch his clothes, are constantly swept and brushed. Servants who are even slightly negligent are immediately scolded. Even the slightest speck of dirt will result in scolding, and no one in the household is spared. He also practices sweeping only the snow in front of his own door outside, instructing the servants to sweep the dirt to both sides and wash it with clean water three or four times a day. Both the front and back doors are the same. Compared to the neighbors, one is dirty and one is clean, a natural divide. Anyone entering the neighborhood who does not know his residence can identify it by the cleanliness of its doorway. Guests all regard him as a source of fear, and only visit when absolutely necessary. When they do visit, they must first check their shoes and brush their clothes before entering. Once inside, they must not touch anything and must be careful not to cough or spit. The ashes from their cigarettes must not fall to the ground. Otherwise, even if he does not explicitly order them to leave, his face will show his displeasure. Therefore, he has very little interaction with others, and even his servants cannot stay with him for long.</p>
<p>Formerly, in a certain school, there was a colleague, a certain Mr. B, who was also exceptionally fond of cleanliness. Every morning, he would take his bedding to the sports ground, pat it, and wipe it before folding it up and hanging his mosquito net to prevent dust from entering. He would not rely on the school workers to clean his chairs and tables. After washing up, he would use the remaining water to wet a towel and wipe them, from the surface of the desks and chairs to all four legs, repeatedly. He kept a kettle for his drinks and would wash it himself every morning. After wiping the outside, he would also clean the inside, filling it with clear spring water, pouring it out and refilling it, at least ten times. No one was allowed to touch his bed, desk, or any of his belongings. Anyone who did would incur his anger. If he went home, every piece of paper and every pen would be placed in a specific location. If anyone moved them, he would immediately know and would verbally abuse them. Therefore, his colleagues all kept their distance from him. I was with him for a year and spoke to him less than ten times.</p>
<h3>Travelogue Around the Yellow Sea (5)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Japan is beset everywhere by economic recession. This can be seen from the city of Dalian. The public trams have not been oiled for a long time. The street signs are peeling and difficult to read. Under Japanese administration in normal times, this would not happen. Once you get to Shenyang, it is very different. Although the economy is said to be bad, in Shenyang city, it is hard to find a decent hotel to accommodate three or four people, even with the efforts of many people for a whole day. It seems that the qualified hotels are all fully booked. But locals tell me that the majority of travelers in Shenyang city are there for political reasons.</p>
<p>I haven't been to Shenyang for four years. In these four years, many new markets have been opened, and many new streets and houses have indeed been added. It is said that last year, gold prices soared and soybeans were difficult to sell, which indeed had a very negative impact. But the previous few years were very good. Every time a new avenue was built, it would be filled with shops and residents in less than a year. I heard that the Shenyang municipal authorities are very talented and courageous.</p>
<p>The two points I pay special attention to are: (1) Future international predictions. (2) The current social and economic situation.</p>
<p>North Manchuria and Soviet Russia, South Manchuria and Japan, all kinds of international disputes are centered on the railway. To remove the shackles, it is necessary to open up an outlet from the transportation. This is only natural. In these few years, the government of Dong Province has actually completed the construction of the railways east and west of the South Manchurian Railway in complete silence. Some were borrowed money, and some used their own money. No wonder the Japanese were shocked. The Tanaka Memorial said, "Little attention was paid beforehand. Afterwards, when we tried to forcibly stop it, the railway line had already been completed." —</p>

<h3>The Hawthorne Detective Agency Turns a Corner (16)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Hawthorne's suggestion to investigate in the Gao family’s direction was certainly considerate. However, he only told me to go to Pei Fen to inquire. For a moment, I was somewhat suspicious. Could he be suspecting that this person had some relationship with Pei Fen? Someone as young and innocent as Pei Fen would hardly be associated with such a conspirator. Hawthorne's nerves seemed rather sensitive. But since he had decided on a course of action, I did not dare change it without authorization. The next morning, Pei Qin's condition showed slight improvement. Her fever had subsided, which relieved me somewhat. After breakfast, I hurried to the Gao residence. The opportunity was good this time. My parents-in-law had been busy with social engagements the previous night and felt tired, so they had not yet gotten up. Pei Xian, however, had gone to the Garrison Headquarters early in the morning. When I entered, the maid, Xiao Mei, told me that Miss Pei Fen had gotten up not long ago and was getting dressed upstairs. I asked Xiao Mei to go upstairs and announce me and waited in the study downstairs. After waiting for about ten minutes, I heard the sound of leather shoes clicking as she walked quickly into the study. She was wearing a pure black, fine swastika-patterned moonflower gauze qipao, which reached her ankles. Her lively eyes smiled as she approached me to greet me. She said, "Brother-in-law, you're here so early. My brother said that you escaped from the banquet last night without saying goodbye. He's going to talk to you about it today." I replied, "Last night, I was worried about your sister, who had a bit of a fever, and I was afraid of being trapped by the other guests and forced to drink, so I quietly went home. Today, I was planning to come and apologize." The smile on Pei Fen's face immediately disappeared. She quickly asked, "How is my sister? Does she still have a fever?" I said, "Her fever has subsided this morning, so she should be fine." As I said this, I got to the point and planned to start my mission of inquiry. However, I didn't know how to bring it up. Pei Fen seemed to have seen through my intentions. She suddenly asked, "Since that's the case, why does your face still look so worried?" I took the opportunity to say, "Last night, I encountered a strange thing. Someone seemed to want to harm me." Her eyes flickered for a moment. She suddenly clapped her slender hands and said, "Oh, brother-in-law, have you brought another strange case? Tell me, tell me. I haven't heard a strange story for a long time." I said seriously, "Today, I'm not here to tell you a story, but to have you tell me one." Pei Fen's gaze rested on my face for a moment. She seemed to realize that I was not joking, so she suppressed her smile. She asked, "What? How can I tell a story?" I said, "Not a story. I want you to identify someone." So I described the appearance and clothing of the person I met last night to Pei Fen, asking if she recognized him.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Under Strong Selling Pressure</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak due to the continuous decline in American cotton, softening market sentiment, and increasing selling pressure. Furthermore, there are various rumors about the current situation, making the market even weaker. However, the price of Dongyang Osaka three-brand yarn is still rising sharply due to the improvement in sales and the depletion of inventory there. As a result, the market price has risen, requiring a silver price of over 210 taels. Therefore, the export trade of this yarn is developing even more. The Shenxin Factory has been negotiating with three Japanese trading companies for about 3,000 to 4,000 bales. Due to the issue of the delivery date, an agreement has not been reached. The factory's May production has already been sold out, and only futures can be sold. The Japanese traders want immediate delivery of spot goods. The previous day, 200 bales of 16-count Ren Zhong yarn were purchased at 162 taels plus tax. If the exchange rate remains strong, the future of exports still has great hope. However, the market sentiment in this port is very weak, with retail investors dumping large quantities of coarse yarn due to sluggish sales and the chaotic situation. If there is a rebound later, there is concern that it will be drastic.</p>
<p>Ren Biao Falls</p>
<p>The Ren Biao market opened with a previous drop in American cotton and many rumors, making the selling pressure even stronger. It fell by 1.2568 qian across the board. The selling pressure continued after the afternoon opening, falling another 5-6 qian. The second and third sessions rebounded as the three brands trended higher and there was news of large-scale exports of Japanese yarn, tightening market sentiment. As a result, each month rose by 345 qian, with a total transaction volume of 35,000 bales. It was found that He Shen sold 2,050 bales, Shenxin 900 bales, Taixing 1,850 bales, Tianlong 1,050 bales, and Shengteng 1,650 bales. Gengfeng bought 1,500 bales, Dachang 1,750 bales, Taixing 1,050 bales, and Rongxing 850 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ren Biao Closing Price Rise and Fall Account Balance Closing Price Rise and Fall Account Balance</p>

<p>July 1590 1.0 76,550 October 1553 1.2 34,850</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Relatively Active</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are relatively active. It was found that all traders bought a total of 2,000 bales throughout the day, with transactions between traders totaling 1,300 bales. Market conditions were slightly weak. Among the guest traders, Hong Kong bought 360 bales, the mainland 120 bales, Sichuan 1,100 bales, Hankou 345 bales, Wuhu 25 bales, Tianjin 25 bales, Shantou 30 bales, the Northern traders 25 bales, the Miscellaneous traders 200 bales, and Japan took 200 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Declines More Sharply</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, with a more intense downward trend, because American cotton has fallen continuously, causing panic among retail investors, and the yarn market is also sluggish and trending downward. However, the exchange rate is still tight, and the combined price of foreign cotton is still high, so some bulls are still not letting go. However, the environment is unfavorable, and the pressure is particularly heavy, making it difficult to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>Han Biao Falls 6-7 Qian</p>
<p>The Han Biao market opened before noon, following the sharp drop in American cotton, with very weak market sentiment. It fell by 5-6-7 qian across the board. After noon, it rebounded by 0.5-1 qian, with a total transaction volume of 87,200 dan. It was found that Changfeng sold 6,700 dan, Shenchang 3,100 dan, Xincheng 5,500 dan, Gongtai 4,200 dan, and Shenxin 2,200 dan. Dafeng bought 1,000 dan, Yilong 1,000 dan, Yuande 1,400 dan, Yichang 1,500 dan, Xinheng 2,100 dan, and Yuanda 2,400 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Delayed Development of American Cotton</h3>
<p>Market Conditions Softened Due to Securities</p>
<p>New York, 15th: A report on the raw cotton market conditions during the week stated that the cotton market fell due to soft securities market conditions and favorable weather in the cotton-growing areas. The delayed development of cotton crops and seeds remains an important issue. However, with proper soil preparation, progress can proceed smoothly. According to an expert, approximately 65% of the cotton fields have been sown, compared to 75% at the same time last year. The reduction in cotton field planting is between 8% and 12%. Recent rains have delayed the start of cotton cultivation, but they have been beneficial to the soil. Sentiment remains bearish, but sellers have decreased because prices are too low and the future of the new crop is still uncertain.</p>

<h3>Demand for Grain and Local Hsien Rice Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for local hsien rice remained active due to excellent local consumption. Sentiment is generally optimistic, and rising prices in the downstream Dumi market further boosted activity in the local hsien rice market. Yesterday, the general market saw 130 bags of Nanjing machine-milled rice sold at 9.8 yuan, 210 bags of Hunan machine-milled rice at 10.095 yuan, and 900 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at 11.4 to 11.045 yuan, all purchased by a local comprador.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Booming</h3>
<p>Rumors of Government Imposing Export Tax</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of all months rebounded strongly. The telegrams about the Yangfen wheat incident the day before had not been answered as of yesterday, causing the sentiment of inland merchants to reignite. They eagerly absorbed positions in both near and distant months. Although the current flour sales market did not appear particularly robust, the attitude of major factories was not as inclined to dump inventory as before. Sometimes they were even seen buying, which made inland merchants feel more secure. In the afternoon trading sessions, there were even rumors that the government would impose an export tax, further stimulating buying activity. However, demand from Tianjin merchants remained weak, suggesting that ordering foreign flour may be unavoidable in the future. As a result, the current month rose by 1.5 points compared to the previous day, June rose by 1.75 points, July rose by 1.5 points, August rose by 1 point, and September and October rose by 2 points.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Interest in Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of all months generally showed a positive trend. The sentiment of inland merchants shifted because the new wheat crop this year was generally inferior to previous years, and because it was difficult to continue ordering foreign wheat due to unfavorable cost. Future demand will inevitably rely more on new wheat, so sentiment shifted, and buying interest increased significantly. Given this situation, it may be difficult to see prices fall in the future. As a result, the current month was up 5 points compared to the previous day, June was up 5 points, July was up 4 points, August was up 5 points, September was up 4 points, and October was up 3 points.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms: The Silk Market Is Becoming Clearer</h3>
<p>Overseas silk sales are weak, and telegrams are still scarce. Chinese silk merchants, aware of the general failure of silkworm cocoons in the interior, have become more resolute in their attitude towards holding onto existing silk stocks, resulting in limited transactions. Yesterday, only Anli and others brought in 20 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and Taihe and others brought in 15 bales of white dried silk. Prices were firm.</p>
<h3>The Cocoon Market in Hangzhou and Surrounding Areas Is Quiet</h3>
<p>Only 20% of the More Than 200 Cocoon Merchants in the County Are Preparing to Open for Business</p>
<p>In Linping and other areas of Hangzhou, the early silkworms this year completely failed due to the cold weather during the first molt. During the late silkworms' major molt, the weather was extremely cold, with heavy rainfalls causing the silkworms to eat wet leaves, resulting in diarrhea, blackening, red stiffness, and white stiffness, leading to death for about 70% of them. The remaining silkworms are limited in number and are now spinning cocoons. However, the weather remains cold and erratic, with strong winds and heavy rain, creating a poor situation.

<h3>News from Qimen Tea After Its Market Launch Yesterday</h3>
<p>The once-renowned Qimen black tea was still being actively sourced by British firms such as Jardine Matheson and Tianyu Dude yesterday. The market momentum was very strong. The entire market traded 2,081 cases of high-grade Qimen tea from the southwest and northern routes, with prices ranging from 240 to 360 taels. Jiande tea prices ranged from 175 to 220 taels. Statistics show that 80% of the tea released the day before had already been sold, indicating strong sales. However, over 7,000 cases arrived in Shanghai by the Yangtze River yesterday, and due to the late arrival, they have not yet been released to the market. Another 7,000 cases are scheduled to arrive, and samples will be released next week, making the market even more lively.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Green Tea Has Opened</h3>

Local Zhuangzhenmei green tea from firms like Jinlong and Jardine Matheson saw some interest yesterday, but bidding became more stringent, and selling prices have already fallen by more than 10 taels. The green tea market does not appear to be optimistic.</p>

Forty to fifty barrels of No. 2 white tinplate were purchased by tea merchants yesterday at a price of 33.5 taels.
