<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界近事</h3>
<p>於此苟安之世界中。最近有較爲重要之三事。其一爲日本濱口首相。因傷病復作之故。辭去民政黨總裁。及首相之職。日本政黨與政局之間。自有若干之變化。其二葡國叛變之勢。日益嚴重。西班牙之政局尙未安定。而葡復有革命之發生。南歐民氣之不靖。於此可見。其三法國因德奥稅約之進行。而對德之感情日壞。且因英有右德之徵象。對英亦復不滿。自歐戰議和以後。德法之間舊恨雖不能忘。而新生之惡感。初未嘗發現。今以德奥稅約之故。兩國均有不能退讓之勢。則今後聯盟會議。與縮减軍備等會議。能否一如往日之敷衍進行甚屬疑問。故今後國際之情勢。亦不免有若干變化也。</p>
<p>由此三事以觀。可知今之世界。各國之政局多不安靖。各國國内之人心。多不安靖。國際之間。舊恨新讐。時常流露。亦多不安靖。誠非可以樂觀之世界也。</p>

<h3>昨日大雨淋漓中</h3>
<p>華東十比零大勝華中</p>
<p>——上半時八球下半時二球——</p>
<p>——華中始終奮鬥精神頗佳——</p>
<p>—分區足球賽第二幕………華中一部分球員今晚返漢—</p>
<p>明日下午三時華北華東决錦標</p>
<p>全國分區足球大比賽、昨日爲第二幕、下午四時、於大雨淋漓中、華東以十比零之數、　破華中隊於中華棒球場、比賽向一面而倒、觀者亦寥寥僅數百人、然兩隊健兒、精神百倍、尤以華中爲甚、雖一敗塗地、仍奮鬥到底、華東隊最後以勝負已定、實行倒串、周賢言馮運佑江着敬李寗、俱出任前鋒、而戴麟經奚巧生羅海光陳鎭和則退居守衛、極滑稽捧腹之至、爲華東足球界、别開生面、值得欣賞者也、</p>
<p>兩軍陣綫</p>
<p>▲華東隊</p>
<p>周賢言　馮運佑江善敬　李樹棠李寗陳璞　陳鎭和羅海光戴麟經陳洪光奚巧生</p>
<p>▲華中隊</p>
<p>唐舜華　程國印趙蘭泉　盧學海虞克定蔡以典　李丕祖周蕃蔚王以德吳詩榮楊恩賜</p>
<p>競爭情形</p>
<p>倒向一面抵抗盡失</p>
<p>以煊赫一時之華東軍、敵進後之華中隊、自如以石擊卵、必碎無疑、故昨日自始至終、華中處於重重壓迫之下、毫無伸張餘地、華東則一意進攻、暢所欲爲、球時時在華東脚上、比賽完全向一面而倒、九十分鐘比賽、球在華十門前、總有六七十分鐘、難得越中線而至華東陣地、守門周賢言共計只踼四五脚耳、全局形勢、可見一斑、</p>
<p>虎入羊羣華東克敵</p>
<p>雨中列陣旣畢、裁判員何春輝、下令動員、一塲雨戰、於日開始、華中隊得先攻之利、然球自右去、陳樸一截即得、前傳與陳洪光、戴麟經下令進攻、全軍齊進、陳鎭和在左攻門、未曾中的、排山倒海、華中隊已受驚不小矣、繼而蔡以典踼任意球、李寗居中奪得、由戴到黑炭、沿邊直、羅海光助之攻門、撲出至左、奚巧生勾起一脚、適落門前、戴中鋒提足攻去、適擦門上之木、强回網内、無可救治矣、</p>
<p>一二三四五六七八</p>
<p>紀錄一開、華東之球、源源不絶、如潮擁起、滾滾向華中衝去、上半時一二三四五六七八、竟造成八比○之數、羅海克攻門、球門救成球角、黑炭主踼、球至陳洪光、又至奚巧生、又成球角、梁樹棠趕上、在三十碼遠射攻門、球竟飛去、此成二比○、二十分鐘時、羅海光射擊、守門者雖撲得而未捉住、强回門内成三比○、陳洪光遠射、球門漏去、華東凈勝四球、然仍再接再厲攻打無已、黑炭踼角球、陳洪光趕上、又告中的、可稱五子登科、陳洪光戴麟經互相策應、盤旋而上、戴至門前、徐徐又爲打中、羅海光射門、守門者拍出、陳洪光又建第七功、陳洪光再盤入、程國印奔前抵禦、陳一踏定、程向前衝去、陳洪光又打入、成上半時八比之紀錄、</p>
<p>結局完滿凑成十數</p>
<p>稍事休息、又動干戈、華東隊依然猛烈壓迫、五分鐘中、戴中鋒、攻入二球、惜裁判員以越位、均宣告無效、亦不以爲意、十分鐘許、繼見陳洪光、匹馬又進、守門倒地上、滑球滾滾進去、成九比○、時陳璞與江著敬調、梁樹棠與馮運佑互易、以取全攻形勢、羅海光最後加上一球、十與零成、完全美滿之數焉、</p>
<p>全班倒串生面别開</p>
<p>華東見大勢一定、華中决無進攻機會、乃開始實行大倒串、攻者退守、守者出攻、於是列成下列之陣勢、</p>
<p>周賢言　陳鎭和陳樸　羅海光戴麟經奚巧生　馮運佑梁樹棠李寗陳洪光江善敬</p>
<p>三位後衛大將、竟出任中鋒及兩翼、借未建樹、否則更形可觀、繼而周賢言以門庭冷落、不甘妻立雨下、亦躍躍欲試、乃亦調出攻門、一塲大趣劇、遂爾開始、觀者捧腹、以爲奇觀、惟陣線時時變動不可捉摸、約立之如后、以覘一斑、大戰亦隨即告終、</p>
<p>梁樹棠　戴麟經陳樸　羅海光陳洪生奚巧生　馮運佑陳鎭和李寗周賢言江善敬</p>
<p>表演精神</p>
<p>始終奮鬥華中精神</p>
<p>此次比賽、最值得欽佩者、莫如華中之精神、處必敗地位、仍遠來作戰、備取人之長、以補己之短、將歸作提倡之預備、此其一、比賽重精神、不計勝負、視華中二次作戰、奮鬥到底、始終不懈、此其二、昨日大雨、不避艱辛、要求照秩序進行、此其三、於此知華中體育之必飛黄騰達於最後之將來也、</p>
<p>重擊之下安有完卵</p>
<p>至於昨日兩隊表演之優劣、殊難伸述、華東實力、自屬不凡、毋庸多贅、惟不得不紀者、則新進陳洪光之表演、昨日大佳、舉動敏速、射球準確大有可取、昨獨五球、華中軍中、得球旣極少、盡爲守門後衛之事、大雨地滑、跑跳困難、球重濕溜、守門者接之不易、是以亦不可過責、總之重擊之下、欲得完卵、不亦難乎、茲列昨日華東得球之次序如左、</p>
<p>（一）戴麟經（二）梁樹棠（三）羅海光（四五）皆陳洪（六）戴麟經（七八九）陳洪光（十）羅海光、統計之下陳洪光五球、戴麟經二球、羅海光二球、梁樹棠一球、</p>

<h3>記袁寒雲先生</h3>
<p>— 郁彝齋</p>
<p>寒雲先生以貴介公子客滬上。冠蓋交游。傾絶一時。噩耗傳來。識與不識。均爲扼腕。亦盛名之使然也。大小報均有紀述其事迹者。顧多耳食。予與先生交甚久。諗知其爲人。走筆錄數行。或爲欲知其人者所樂聞歟。先生譜名克文。字孝質。各報所紀豹岑。抱存等。均其别字也。爲人聰頴。才思敏捷。與易實甫。樊樊山諸先輩游。能作小詩詞。靈機敏達。一呑吐間。能立就二絶。（君初嗜阿芙蓉。每作詩。字。多於榻上爲之。性疏懶。非高臥即呑雲吐霧。非不得已不輕離步也。）作書時。亦多臥而揮毫。一人執其一端。君倚枕振筆書之。不加繩墨而無欹斜。人以其工詩能書。聲譽鵲起。又以乃翁曾踐九五公子之名。乃被遐邇。有目之爲陳思王者。雖擬之或過當。若項城可比孟德。則君固不讓子建也。予則尤佩其以貴公子。而不染紈袴氣。且待人接物。至和藹。即遇臧獲。亦不見疾言厲色。而急人之急。豪俠好義。尤足多者。客滬上時。華燈初上。偶過先生廬。輒順道往訪。或高臥未起。則排闥直入。促之起。犢袴曳屐。即作長夜談。呼茶奉烟。或婢僕不在。即親爲之。不加指使也。或滌唾盂。或整烟具。得暇即自理。奴輩不在旁。亦不苛責。甚且曰旣自爲之。不更煩爾輩也。曩年余叔岩南來。開罪於人。洶洶將與爲難。走告先生。得一言而立解。又一日先生與友人及予同飲酒樓。座間一人縱談國事。激烈陳言。適邏者過其處。欲得以邀功。糾衆候其出。其人固未覺也。時項城當國。禁中稽察綦嚴。偶語即遭禍。友人目止之。渠猶茫茫。先生恐其及禍。下酒樓即挾之共登車。邏者投鼠忌器。竟無奈何。其任俠。即朱郭不多讓也。斯二事皆不佞目覩者。或可較信於所云宮禁深闈之軍國大事也。然亦足見其生平矣。天南地北。不克束芻一弔。書數行。以代哀思。並以告世之欲知先生者云。</p>
<h3>斐洲獸語</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>斐洲地屬熱帶。熇赫炎烈。草木蓊薈。獸羣集焉。獮猴攀援巨木。騰躍似飛。喜啖果。士人剖椰子。設機捩以伺之。獮猴正快朶頣。機捩一動。兩手被縛矣。馴養之。可供人驅使。并誘其同類而來。最蠻悍者。厥爲猩猩。土人畏敬之。視以爲神焉。每夏必舉行祭禮。以士婦一。赤裸其體。使坐於林木間。旣而猩猩至。猩猩固好淫者。見裸婦。作媟態以汚之。一而再三。婦輒不堪蹂躪而死。即倖而逃生。亦癱癃終身。失其行動。土人則以旣行祭禮。可免災變。方引爲忻幸也。虎有時泅水以渡。土人見之。輒没水。人拕一虎足。力以下潛。虎被掩。猛健無所施。擒之如縛犬。每殺一虎。土人相率歡踊。作嗚嗚之歌。似亦有步位節奏者。肉以下酒皮以被體。骨以製器皿及玩好之需。無棄材。斑馬馳行絶迅。非常馬所能及。古人之所謂騏驥駃騠。庶幾近之。長頸鹿。或云即我國圖籍所載之麒麟聖獸。未知是否。力弱非他獸敵。然其聽覺。靈敏異常。一二里外。有巨獸行走。長頸鹿能聞聲匿跡。故鮮有被害者。鱷魚徧湖澤皆是。産卵作長圓形。夏秋之交。小鱷魚破卵而出。蠕行澤畔。厥數累千。雖昌黎再世。不能文以盡徙之也。鱷魚喜啖蟻。其捕蟻也。法殊巧妙。蓋鱗甲綦腥。鱷魚伏岸不動。蟻聞腥。附趨而至。羣聚其鱗甲中。聚旣多。鱷魚縱體没於綠波。蟻咸浮於波面。然後張吻呑之。不費力也。多虺蛇。盤曲相糾於橋。土人擲利鈎以中斷其體。蛇血涔涔下滴。盎以承之。視爲無上美味。瓊漿玉液不啻云。</p>

<p>▲胡蝶即紅牡丹化身　胡蝶色藝歌喉。前於扮演大葡萄仙子幕中。早經心折。今觀此片。慘切處甚多。如許婚陳二爺時之勉爲母屈。及反目後之奪女尋女。探獄贈金諸幕。怨而不怒。聲淚俱下。而代紅牡丹演探母時。痛哭暈絶。吐血不止。胡蝶此時。肝液潛潛。悲從中來。幾不知身爲莊生夢中之仙。抑明空詔謫之花王也。是固胡蝶激剌太深。亦導演編攝之皆爲名流乃臻此。然胡蝶爲紅牡丹化身。無可疑也。</p>
<p>▲全部皆銀幕上翹楚　本劇共分十八本。胡蝶之外。各逞雄奇。皆非凡品。王獻齋君描摩陳二爺之無賴。及其末路之悲悔。神情言動。刻劃之妙。眞能入木三分。朱女員秀英與其女哭呌急尋香姐一幕。驚心動魄。賺人痛淚不少。而姜禹丞之始終失望。馬吉慶之俠義可風。香姐初出之嬌小玲瓏。甚至賭徒穆瓜大茶壺。均能各極其妙。誠不負主角之慘淡經營。與導演編攝諸君之精神貫注。歎觀止矣。</p>
<p>▲前途之希望與參觀後之感想　强富貴人描寫寒酸之態。或返其道而行。皆不能入彀。縱導演之有法。天資之敏妙。均不免滔滔汩汩。如理舊書而巳。胡蝶女士身世之眞相。雖不敢知。而在女士之我見。於紅牡丹不能無多情之感。故有此空前之鉅觀。一偉業之成。天或不惜摧挫以成之。而全國人之耳目。從此知中國電影事業。不讓歐西專美。則又感想外之希望。</p>
<h3>雅歌集載譽而歸</h3>
<p>— 芙蓉軒主</p>
<p>海上票房林立。其資望最深者。首推雅歌集。去年自勞苦功高之維持會員朱聯馥君。發起旅行部。推李麗明君主任。林植齋君爲文書主任。各會員無不踴躍加入。此次旅行常熟。事聞於當地大醫院院長。再三電商爲籌備基本金唱義務獻二天。朱李諸二君鑒於事屬善舉。應其所請。各帶行頭。於上星期五首途。一行約六十餘人。當晚下榻於虞山旅社。星期六日二晚出演於虞山大劇塲。前數日定座一空。後來者實無隙地可容。當地人士之未飽眼福者。再三商懇大醫院長。挽留一天。顧以諸名票急於返申辦公。未能允可。據云此次之大會串。爲虞山數年來未有之盛舉云。（却酬）</p>
<p>▲出版界消息　周世勳君主編文華書局出版之電影月刊第七期。己於今日出版。内容較前益見精善。並附刊有名作四篇「卓别麟之戀愛觀」「追隨嘉寳一日記」等。均極饒趣味。該刊每册三角。全年三元云。</p>
<h3>節物偶談（四）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>柳花未放時。其枝葉間有淡黄色蕊。謂之柳椹。若遇晴日烘之。即即開綻。風吹成絮。不能留在枝頭。予嘗有句云。柳絮飛三日。桃花落一春。或誤三日爲三月。非也。因其花期極短。自開至落。至多不過三日耳。本草拾遺。謂柳椹入藥。若俟花出。則無用矣。峋嶁神書。有柳椹牢牙法。以柳椹揩牙。去其宣露。諸風不生。明目駐顔。黑髮聰耳。筋力。益壽輕身。急救方以柳椹陰乾爲末。日用拂牙。去風明目。烏髮固齒。久用不輟。可咀金石。予嘗試以柳花用酒精浸漬。細考所含有交成分。實與柳酸無異。惟市集柳酸。多由人造。以石炭酸與苛性納製成。並非由天然植物中提出。故予用此。寗取自製爲可恃耳。</p>
<p>柳花中有細黑小點。即其子也。含有水分甚多。故着皮毛衣物。則受熱蒸發。而變爲蟲。此與腐草爲瑩之理同。落於水面。則化爲萍。仍爲植物。浮萍陰乾後。燒之能使蚊蟲化水。但如直曝酸中。則萍易爛。無復收成。且失其效。蓋其效用。亦在所含之有機酸耳。浮萍所含之酸。仍爲柳日。殆與石炭酸所製者同。故用石炭酸以薰蚊蟲。亦能殺蚊。其效力不亞於除蟲菊。方書謂宜五月五日。采集陰乾。亦不關於迷信。因如節令一過端午。則日炙力强。所含有機酸。即多揮發。陰乾之法。宜用長繩繫之成串。懸於有風無日處。三四日即乾。可研成粉。若久懸風中。則又不免揮發有效成分。正與除蟲菊之處理法同。惟除蟲菊爲植物鹻類。非酸類耳。其性相反。足使中和。故二物不可並用。或用鱔魚骨薰蚊。則取所含燐酸。與蟹殻之熏壁虱。作用相同。羊脛骨髓。亦含燐酸份甚富。故於壁虱之驅除。亦甚效。世俗每於初次開窗。拍床擊枕。謂能驅虱。是蓋驚蟄之誤。大抵蟄蟲陰伏。畏寒不出。雷動則陽氣盛行。蟄蟲乃驚而出。故在此際薰烟。以除壁虱。誠足殲其種也。（待續）</p>
<h3>印度遊記（二○）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>印度女界著作家往往而有。據Mrs·Carsing書云。印俗重節操。好早婚。以至幼女不滿十歲有即成寡婦者。今全印凡有三十歲以上之幼年寡婦。而西書統計有數百萬。故有人力倡破除寡婦之習。但以余論之。歐戰以後。統計各國寡婦一二千萬計。印度不算多也。歐人好戰。爲産生寡婦之根本。今西人著作。又將學東方之多妻制者不少也。其原理謂多妻制。或謂爲不合道理。然千萬寡婦遍地。豈合人道乎。凡道理在時勢之要求。空談無補耳。以余所聞於西婦嫁華人者。其主張華人取西婦。於人種上有利益。但余知事實上歐男性好鬥之結果。雄性自相淘汰。所餘雌性。向東方求平均出路。乃數學上公例耳。</p>
<p>至印人之俗多忌諱。異敎間不能同飲。某君語我云。我自己爲印度敎人。本可以飲回敎人之茶。但家族他人聞知。必大反對也。高等法庭有印人取西婦。其家不與往來。蓋印人娶西婦者。往往而有。印女嫁西人者頗少云。</p>
<p>在此頗見回敎阿富汗人裝束與印人異。印人幾無衣服可言。回人有衣服而整齊。蓋天寒也。見尼泊爾人。尼泊爾爲甚小之國。然今尙稱獨立。道階師曾遊之。高山險峻。守兵甚嚴。英人未能平之。然借債派顧問。派人爲練兵。結最惠條約耳。印度人尙甚羨慕尼泊爾人。謂勝於吾之爲奴隷也。尼泊爾人帶刀布紮頭。吾不解何以來加市尙帶刀公行也。見西藏人來請佛像者。一華女爲之翻譯。西藏人高大粗黑。如印人。而悍氣陵人。足踏厚皮鞋。舉動轟野。一望而知爲山野之民。此等猛悍之族。無佛敎以化之。眞難馴也。</p>
<p>此間與西藏交通便利。往來用馬。若入藏可借乘。但英國不許通過耳。即僧人亦不易過。有南洋人號稱征夫和尙者。曾往遊。願入藏。英人總不許。結果不知如何。聞征夫和尙在新加坡轉道方丈所辦之佛敎學校任敎長。特不知該校是否成立耳。征夫和尙乃一新思想之靑年。著有新村一書。爲入藏事大費經營。</p>

<p>金融　標金徘徊不定</p>
<p>重出二十兩關外　昨十日標金狀况平和、趨勢稍漲、復逾出七百二十兩關外、惟略有藴伏、終日共有十六兩之參差、各號及投機大戶等出納頗爲紛異、然意向穩固、殆外滙雖巳掛長二檔、但内盤似佳、正謂明鬆暗堅也、海外銀市報升、不爲所動、實緣歐市並無特殊變化、故金價初開略挫、當即上騰、誠相背而馳、蓋以買方敏活、旋後頻漲十餘兩、祇有三四兩起仆、曾漲爲七百廿七兩有零、午刻忽聞花旗某銀鑛發生停工消息、肢是急流愈下、破進二十兩以内、後市信亨·源成等傾售、繼續暴落十兩之譜、復以買者不懈、並傳日木新内閣仍爲民政黨、故金解禁絶無景響、迨結果仍在二十兩之間、</p>
<p>大條長晨開略降　自早市五月份開盤略降一兩半、爲七百十五兩、大條雖升十六分之五、遠期四分之一、銀價漲八分之五、且私電只加二分之一、故人心尙平、繼則續遜一兩、倐忽間乾昌祥·志豐永·元茂永·元興永等皆有落手購進、遂即上漲五兩餘、計爲十九兩八錢、而英金結者不少、近遠期均爲三七五、入後元亨·順利·萬興等稍售、略遜二兩餘、計十七兩、</p>

<p>美銀鑛停工又挫　頃刻間傳聞美國銀鑛停工之說、人心似挫、銳落七八兩之多、恒興·叙昌及套頭等均有脫售、故午收爲十九兩、續再抑小三兩、僅爲十六兩之間、物品做小二兩、揭價改爲七百七十七兩、計撳六十兩至五十兩、午刻六十兩、後市開出即降四兩半、計十四兩半、次爲十四兩、乃物品早開小盤矣、俄頃印匯報小四安那、當即遞高七兩餘、且買者猶衆、至二點一刻爲二十一兩半、無如大戶信亨·源成·恒興元·餘大等奮勇賣出、故急轉疲萎、狂跌十兩、直至三點時猝爲七百十一兩、殆英金隨硬、銀行互做四三七五、三井等買去半便士、往後曾吸四三七五、、並由恒興來進、遂已上乘、三點半後爲十六兩半、旋因印匯回大二安那、即遜二兩零、四點時爲十四兩二三錢、</p>
<p>晚收前又轉上峯　復聞日本内閣仍屬於民政派、故人心稍定、已濳上峯、益以福昌等套頭買進、最後計漲爲二十兩零五錢、將屆閉戶、零戶等出售、壓小兩許、迨四點三十分收盤爲二十兩、比較前日計漲三兩五錢、入後又抬上一兩餘、故物品做高一兩、前後兩市最大價七百二十七兩二錢、最小價七百十一兩、計有十六兩二錢差額、物品早市五兩半、午收七兩、下午五兩二錢、收市二十一兩、揭價計抑小六十兩内外、登賬十九兩、補水十五兩、下午十六兩、</p>
<p>投機者出納紛歧　各號買賣尙稱興盛、計志豐永·萃昌永·恒興元·福昌大·大興永·元興永等均有買進、乾昌祥·元茂永·餘大·同太昌等初進後昌、大德成·福太亨·恒興·元大永·丙興等乍出乍進、爲數不少、信亨·福興永·源泰·順利·萬興等都有出售、恒興售出一千餘條、下午志豐永·乾昌祥·萬興·福昌等忽進忽出、順利·同太昌·源泰均進、恒興進多出少、信亨·源成賣出多頭、爲數尙多、恒興元及陸某亦售、大致空頭地位、其餘各號出入紛歧、而套頭號家改變方針、以賣匯票而進條子也、廣帮前出後進、共計二千餘條、似同搶帽子交易、大連帮共進三千條、則出二千數百條、仍占多頭也、</p>

<h3>銀洋市淸寂如故</h3>
<p>市塲槪况　往年在現下時際、洋欵有繭用、抛做期洋、銀欵有長期、交易紛繁、而今年以種種關係、類率固步自封、期洋幾告絶跡、長期亦鮮聽聞、當此時期、以素稱旺象之大好機會、反成淸寂之狀態、良用喟然、幸目前堪以自慰者、現洋稍有去胃耳、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市爲七錢二分六厘一毫二五、午市同價、做出交易、早市滙劃票欵一百三十三萬、午市八十八萬、鈔票早市二萬、午市一萬五千、塲外鈔票早市十二萬五千、午市八萬五千、現洋兩市五十餘萬、小錢莊交易七十餘萬、客帮去胃七十餘萬、（銀拆）早午市一槪白借、劃頭亦無加水、銀根頭襯殊鬆、拆票交易六百餘萬、（輔幣）江南小洋、早市爲六錢四分三厘、午市爲六錢四分五厘、做出交易、早市二千角、午市四千五百角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢四分○二毫半、午市爲六錢四分一厘二毫半、做出交易、早市十一萬五千萬、午市十萬角、銅元長一千文、爲三百七十一千文、</p>

<h3>繭汛期洋昨訊</h3>
<p>昨聞洋行方面及繭商等巳有分頭接洽抛做期洋等事、銀錢業方面因旣不做期洋、類率不願投機預抛、是以此項消息、比較上年岑寂、但欲做者依然不在少數、據云昨已訂定交易約有一百餘萬、厘價有七錢三分五厘餘云、</p>

<p>糧食　米市步軟</p>
<p>閘北　昨日各帮到源三十餘號、去化仍呆、但市塲傳言有某帮將落手購買之消息、然不能證實、緣河下存到之貨均屬身分平常、不易久擱、故買戶統不歡迎、白粳米因此又軟近角至角外、人心依然看短、薄稻去化續呆、盤面小去尺許、羊杜秈埠秈等則到稀銷可、行情一律平定、白元客銷活動、到源見接、價格告穩、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日裏路來船十餘號、本街銷塲極懈、各帮機白粳因零拆店胃均淡、價小角半之譜腩帮薄早稻到頭陸續、買氣沉寂、續疲角餘、羊杜尖貨少市定、變陰元走銷尙可、大盤平定、</p>
<h3>客秈有漢口去化</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、因廣帮停手、市面略轉軟勢、但有漢口帮與本街等相繼趁小購買、市形疲後復活、祇行情仍難起色、統市由漢口帮及本街等辦去江西機晚八百包、價十一元三角半至十一元二角二分、厦門帮辦去江西機元三百○八包、價十一元半、均係中關之貨、高上者存底早稀、價亦不肯十分低落云、</p>
<h3>粉市午後銳跌</h3>
<p>春雨内地多頭紛紛回出</p>
<p>昨日麫粉上午開盤後、各月份市面、因洋麥報價、徵好一二角不等、業内外人心、暫趨觀望、故上落甚少、迨至下午開盤、因傳日本政局將有變動、金價當有劇烈之變動、兼之月餘未雨、午後陰雲四佈、雨意甚濃、致内地帮之多頭、紛紛回出、本月份亦以客銷轉寂、廠家雖未出檔、人心則依然不佳、故均一致銳落、觀察後步、或者遠期九錢半之低價、尙須重見也、結果本月份較前日暴落三分半、五月份跌三分七厘半、六月份跌二分、七月份跌二分二厘半、八月份跌一分半、九月份跌二分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥多頭回出</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、呈疲滯之勢、雖洋麥報價微小、曾一度呈穩定之局、惟人後各盤、以大戶心思、未有續進、内地多頭鑒於環境依然不佳、廠行兩方所定洋麥、靑黄時節、儘足敷用、若粉銷一寂、市面又難復擯、故順勢回出者頗巨、觀此後或因粉市之銳落、當須帶動也、結果四五月份較前日跌二分、六七月份跌三分、八九月份跌二分云、</p>
<h3>期豆午後轉堅</h3>
<p>昨日標準大連期豆始定終堅、上午開盤後因客帮進胃淸淡、連帮售意亦靜、致市中交易轉稀、近遠期價均平定、迨至下午開盤後、據大連電報到申告漲、人心因此趨佳、而公會現銷亦告活動、但近期多頭頗有脫出、致市仍定、遠期則一致轉堅、結果四月期四兩六錢二分市平、五月四兩六錢一分、大二分、六月四兩六錢三、大一分、</p>
<p>糖市　本廠冰走銷頗暢</p>
<p>粗砂白布跌一錢</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價跌○六二五、紐約期糖各月份均跌一分、獨明年度三月份不動、爪哇現期糖亦均無升降、公會市塲劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白以外匯增長、市氣更弱、受手毫無、而出戶殊繁、甚肯遷就、市乃陡落、成交價至十兩○三錢半、比前日步跌一錢、而市形且屬萎靡不振、中砂白喊九兩九錢、毫無問津、日糖交易殊寥、市則頗爲堅穩、上檔貨缺、乃見微升、Ｊ嘜十兩○七錢半ＹＰ嘜十兩○六錢半、ＹＴ嘜十兩○二錢半、Ｎ嘜十兩○三錢二分半、ＹＲＯ嘜九兩八錢、ＳＨ嘜九兩九錢半、趨勢尙挺、本廠冰走銷尙暢、國華廠昨開出數百包、一號貨價十三兩三錢、二號十三兩二錢、三號大袋冰十二兩五錢、市形尙覺俏俐云、</p>
<p>南北貨　泉泡圓不肯賤卸</p>
<p>泉州泡圓去冬一再加漲、預料今春必有更佳之市面、詎入春來銷路呆滯、市勢適得其反、兼之各行售盤異常遷就、價遂步鬆、較之高價時竟降落二三兩、惟地價迄未隨鬆、昨日泉輪人口、况無續到、據貨主函訊、地價挺立、存貨不肯賤卸、故頭檔貨各號久擯未兌、如銷胃轉暢、或有回升希望云、</p>
<p>絲茶　華絲歐銷復呆</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市又趨呆滯、緣歐美市塲、生絲廠進仍懈、去電不轉、華絲商亦以價小本重、虧折難售、昨祗時泰進滬白廠經二十包、中和進白乾經十包、價尙平定云、</p>
<h3>魯挽手七十件運滬</h3>
<p>山東大二挽手、邇來英法需要未衰、而滬存不充、分電産地催貨、昨日烟靑班定生輪又由烟台裝到絲廠挽手七十件、已由益豐長等上棧待解云、</p>
<h3>紅綠茶歐銷不振</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、近來益形疲靜、歐美各莊行家鑒於滙率之漲落不定、均持觀望態度、加之非洲摩洛哥各路銷茶區域、來電均告存底充塞、銷路呆滯、人心益趨軟弱、日來婺源珍眉、無人問及、屯溪珍眉、同孚錦隆等行、雖有少數進胃、但市盤較前又低二三兩、市勢異常悲觀云、</p>
<p>雜訊　麥子一萬一千包美國運來、</p>

<p>用公平之眼光觀之、尙未能完全作肯定之語、蓋閙市白畫架入、似已成爲見慣、然而因爲高級警務職員、都係外籍、以言語之隔膜、與心理之各别、雖經費年有增加、而其案件之增加、與之適成正比例、據本年度工部局所提出之豫算、警費又比去年增加銀一百三十餘萬兩、但案件是否减少、恐在高級警務職員、未儘量雇用合格華人之前、效能上未必能有顯著之進步也、市政之消極設置、爲程序之確立、巳如上述、而積極之設施、乃係敎育之普及、試問界内外籍之學齡兒童、有未得享權利敎育者乎、有如我國學齡兒童未得權利敎育者數目之多乎、工部局迄於今日、猶未執行上述本會中關於敎育問題之内容、遷延已三年有餘、增設小學僅有三所、而其校舍、尙有二處、須在明年秋季方得使用、其忽視華人敎育可以想見、近雖有八年計劃小學十六所之分期添設、二女中學之預定開辦、然而一言經費、計劃預算、則大而無當、籌措的欵、則示意加捐、正不知納稅華人所納之捐稅、是否供外員匯兌損失、可一擲至百萬之多、而用諸我人根本敎育、郤　銖必較、此我人尤應注意者也、近來工部局於未經納稅華人認可出售電氣處之所得盈餘、業將耗盡、於是對於地價、以新估比較舊估、有增加倍半以上、以爲增收地捐之地、又復破壞市財政原則、與歷來慣例、對於實在房租之總捐、將依估計房租收取、核其捐率、有多至百分二十六以上、雖不欲謂其將盡掊克之能事、亦所不能、而於本年預算報告中、且有明年將增捐二厘之擬議、納稅人豈能容忍者乎、此外工部局對於雇用華人充高級職員一案、就我人所知、可稱謂絶無誠意、本來在總辦出缺之初、即應雇用華人充任、方見合作之精神、乃經我出席華董事提出之後、移花接木、推三阻四、非云經騐不足、即云成例難破、有人謂中有某人把持、以期壟斷操縱局政、我人以公道正義待人、認爲必無此事、然僅聞其聲、而不見其人之現象觸於我人心目、或有可信之處、雖然、本會仍當用堂堂正正之辦法、有以督促實行前述本會函中第三項之規定、惟工部局近有一事、足稱爲改過不吝者、即對於跑狗大賭場之决絶禁閉是、查跑狗大賭塲、於開始之時、本會即積極反對、認係罪人刑案之製造廠、乃當時之董事長、不知以何緣故、見解與本會相左、本來工部局之行動、應受納稅人意思之拘束、乃不此之圖、卒至焦頭爛額、方盡執行納稅人之意思、幸現任董事長·及諸董事、深明大義、禁閉之主張决絶、方未至將工部局之信譽掃地、誠爲幸事也、以上僅就其重要者約略言之、茲請出席工部局之董事與委員報告一年來之經辦事件、</p>

<h3>北行散紀</h3>
<p>— 安平</p>
<p>七　津浦道上</p>
<p>因爲離開車時間還早、無聊、一個人上鎭上的小館用點心去、點心用完了出來、再買這麽一塊錢水菓上車、剛好、下關過江的客人、絡絡續續的上了車、車子上照例是一陣喧嘈、直到七點鐘、車開了、這才慢慢地有秩序起來、</p>
<p>津浦車就没有京滬或滬杭車來得快、單就聽着車輪前進的節頓聲、心上就生厭、像一匹老牛般、祇喘氣、跑不上、浦口到徐州的路程、和上海到南京不相差多少、上海到南京、特快車、七個半鐘頭就興、但津浦車不行、并不多得走上十一個鐘頭、不過車箱裏還算舒適、記得在北平時、曾看見上海的一張小報上、說鐡道部省錢、二等車裏不用水汀用火爐、而津浦車上便没有那一回事、房間裏、走廊裏、都有水管、不要說大衣用不着、彷彿就祇穿了一件絨襯衫、也夠敷衍了似的、</p>
<p>不過津浦車最可引爲缺憾、人民最感苦痛的、就是三等車没臥舖賣、單說從浦口到天津、得化上兩夜一天多、要是没有睡、怎吃得消、有一次、車子停在一個站上、我走下車上月台散步、看見三等車裏那樣的凌亂和苦楚、眞不安心、要顧全身體的健康非得坐二等、然而二等從上海到北平、連路上小用、單一趟、得化上八十塊錢、中國不究竟還是窮人多嗎、</p>
<p>剛一覺醒來、徐州已過去了多路、在十一點鐘的時候、車到了兗州、車到這兒、所見所聞、和江南完全成了兩個局面了、江南的鈔票、江南的角子、江南的銅元、再向北、就完不通用、在兗州、似乎還行、有一些人、就專門做這生意、看見你從南面來的車、於是將北邊通用的銀票、角票、錢票、大銅子、兌換給你、看見你從北面來的車、於是將南邊通用的鈔票、角子、小銅子兌換給你、同是在一國、南北有名的商埠與都市、南面的如上海南京、北面的如天津北平、單單鈔票、銀角、銅子都不通用、你想多麻煩、上海、任你上海的那家銀行的鈔票、中國也好、交通也好、中南也好、一槪不很流通、除非每五元得當兩三角損失、才用得過、北地用的鈔票、大部是中國交通中南等銀行的天津分行發出來的鈔票、票子上有天津兩字註明的、或者河北農工銀行、或者東三省官銀號發出來的票子、北地不很用銀角子、北平則絶對的没有、北平祇用角票、一塊錢十角、（一角十張、兩角的五張、）所以北平買什麽東西、出進一律是大洋、南邊的小銅子他們也不用、北地另外用一種大銅子、小銅子兩個換大銅子一個、北平的錢價比上海更低、一塊錢可以換三千八百文、一角錢可以換三百八十文、但這兒的「文」、是以小銅子做單位的、所以一角錢換三百八十文、那就是十九個大銅子、北平無論什麽交易出進、說到銅子、是没有單數的、譬如、說二十六個子、就是十三個大子、說二十五個子、那末你不是要付十二個大子和一個小子了嗎、要是你說了單數、不消說、你做了十足道地的「生客」、我還記得在北平的時候、還黄包車的價、常常會說二十五個子、以爲二十五是一個整數、有時連忙想到、於是又說「二十六」吧、</p>
<p>津浦路中像兗州滄州德州一帶、有一種燒鷄是很出名的、並且便宜得驚人、一隻燒鷄、祇賣你三角錢、或者四角錢、我很奇怪怎麽會這樣便宜、答語是、因爲北地的人、生活太苦、鷄和肉、這一類的東西、由他怎樣便宜、這裏的人是没有什麽人吃的、</p>
<p>北地的車站上、不像南邊一樣乾凈有秩序、月台上有許多攤頭排着、大部分是做着三等搭客的生意、在兗州、我曾經在月台上徘徊了長久、天氣還不怎樣十分冷、披了大衣剛好、所有的一些攤頭、大部分是賣的油條大餅香烟燒鷄之類、並且還有一種以玉蜀黍做的粥、像我們用沸水和洋乾麵冲成的稀薄的漿糊一樣、我覺得好奇、要了一碗、那知淡而無味、不能下咽、祇喝了兩口便算了、</p>
<p>其後車到了泰安、泰安過去、一直到濟南、山脈纒綿、都是泰安支脈、不知在那一段路上、在萬山之中、透出好幾個峯、碧靑一個曾去遊泰山的同車的旅客告訴我、那就是泰山的正峰、有幾個山峰上還隱約有一兩點紅點、大槪是廟、山峰眞是那樣的高、一直揷到雲霄裏、一層層的白雲遮没了許多山峰、所以有的祇看見下面的一部分、上面的便糢糊了、</p>
<p>北邊的人的生活眞苦、說江南是天堂、是仙國、要不是你到過北邊一次、你眞不覺得江南的舒服和有福氣、沿途、我便不曾看見有一個人脚上穿一雙洋襪過、是一列的老籃布衣裳褲子、和白大布襪、黑布鞋、車經過每一個站、有許多大人、小孩、站在月台附近看、看那條的活蛇、我曾看見有兩個小孩、一面笑着看火車、一面嘴裏嚼着手裏的一塊不知什麽粗粉做成的餅、他們吃得有滋味、就像使人看了不知要以爲那塊餅怎樣好吃一樣、我看江南的那些最可憐的黄包車夫吃的大餅還要比那兩個小孩吃的細膩些、油水多一些、然而茶房說、吃這餅的兩個小孩、大槪巳經要算是這兒附近的大戶人家的子弟了、</p>
<p>還有許多小孩子、老女人、專門到車來了、在地上磕頭要銅錢的、像在禹城、便是一個例、你看見這車、自然你會說這些小孩子没敎養、但是、他們的生活都不能維持、怎談得上敎養呢、我眼看有一個窗口擲下了一塊不要吃的大餅屑、像一羣野狗、許多小孩子便哄了來、終於那塊大餅屑爲一個勝利者搶到了、放在嘴裏驕傲地大嚼着、没有搶到的小孩、眼睛都望着那個搶到的小孩的嘴巴、再或者便無聊地望望車子上、有没有再擲出來的、</p>
<p>在山東段、津浦路上有着許多大鐡橋、自然、黃河鐡橋誰也知道、其實、就像大汶河鐡橋、在京滬滬杭兩條綫上也找不出、不過雖然是大橋、其實橋下面當眞有水的流通、又狹得可憐、比如說黃河、黄河鐡橋下的河面、恐怕還没有外灘的黄浦江面一半闊、說大汶河、大汶河橋下在的水道没有兩丈寬、許多大橋下面的河儘跨得過、北方的土地、總是那底一列的多河、乾的時候、人、畜牲、或者車子、在河裏過、足印子、車輪跡、很淸楚地印在河泥裏、北方的河道、乾的時候就是那底乾、水漲的時候、則泛瀾無巳、</p>
<p>因爲橋長、所以車子駛過、像一個胆小的人般會發抖、車子在橋上走得特别的慢、祇要車頭一過橋、便格外開得快、我記着、單黄河鐡橋要走五分鐘、雖然橋長、但車的走得慢、也可見一斑了、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Recent World Events</h3>
<p>In this world of temporary peace, there are three relatively important recent events. One is that Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi resigned from his positions as President of the Minseito Party and Prime Minister due to a recurrence of his injuries. There will be some changes between Japanese political parties and the political situation. The second is that the rebellion in Portugal is becoming increasingly serious. The political situation in Spain has not yet stabilized, and a revolution has occurred in Portugal again. The unrest of the people in Southern Europe is evident from this. The third is that France's feelings towards Germany are deteriorating due to the implementation of the German-Austrian customs union, and it is also dissatisfied with Britain because Britain shows signs of supporting Germany. Since the peace negotiations after the European War, the old hatred between Germany and France has not been forgotten, but new animosity has not yet been discovered. Now, because of the German-Austrian customs union, both countries have no room for concession, so it is doubtful whether future League meetings and disarmament conferences can continue as in the past. Therefore, the future international situation will inevitably have some changes.</p>
<p>From these three events, it can be seen that in today's world, the political situation in various countries is mostly unstable.

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>Detailed Report on Extraterritoriality Negotiations</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting hosted reporters from various newspapers in the auditorium of the Ministry at 11:00 AM on the 10th, reporting on the recent diplomatic situation, roughly stating: (1) The Sino-Russian Conference held its third meeting on the 9th. Around twenty Chinese experts will go to Moscow, and various issues between China and Russia will be discussed in order; (2) The Sino-Turkish Treaty, after consultation between Vice Minister Li and the Turkish Chargé d'affaires, has been fully agreed upon. The Turkish Chargé d'affaires is now requesting instructions from his home government, and it can be signed by the end of this month after receiving a reply; (3) The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees has been established. The selection of purchasing committee members has also been agreed upon by the Board. The accumulated amount of British Boxer Indemnity funds is approximately £3.7 million, which can be withdrawn after the purchasing committee is established. In the future, those who lack vehicle materials can be supplemented in order.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Wang issued a written report on extraterritoriality negotiations, stating: "On February 12th, before February, I hosted Chinese and foreign journalists in Shanghai, reporting in detail China's hopes for the abolition of consular jurisdiction. On that day, I said that the abolition of consular jurisdiction has been implemented since January 1st of the 19th year, but for the past thirteen months, the remaining related countries have not achieved concrete results. On that day, I also said that thirty years ago, several countries had declared, 'Once China's legal situation and its judicial methods are perfect, they will agree to give up consular jurisdiction.' Regarding this point, I have said that human nature has no absolute right or wrong, so whether China's judicial system and judicial administration have reached the standard ideal for various countries is entirely a subjective view. Various countries can discuss it from their different perspectives and reach different conclusions. Therefore, this matter should not be biased towards one party but should be discussed fairly from both sides' positions, just as the plaintiff cannot be the judge at the same time. On that day, I also mentioned that in modern times, China is the only one remaining bound by the old system of extraterritoriality. If the Chinese government and people do not swear to fight to the death to abolish extraterritoriality as soon as possible, they will not be able to face the country or themselves. The clauses said by various countries thirty years ago (that is, once China's legal situation and its judicial methods are perfect, they will agree to give up consular jurisdiction) are now cited as an explanation for extending extraterritoriality. I expressed my hope that the current negotiations can determine the date of officially abolishing consular jurisdiction in the shortest possible time. In the shortest time, I declared, 'Now the Chinese government and people have decided to make the greatest efforts to achieve this abolition goal. If it continues to be delayed and unresolved, it will not only be of no help but will also increase China's determination to abolish legal rights. Therefore, I firmly believe that China will not be oppressed and adopt methods other than friendly negotiations to achieve this goal,' etc. It has been exactly two months since I made this statement. Today, I am happy to report to you that after consultation with the representatives appointed by a few relevant countries, the goal hoped for by the Chinese people is now not far away. The attitudes of the United Kingdom and the United States are particularly good, and the other four countries have also expressed the same. However, there are only one or two of the most important points that the countries have not yet completely satisfied with the legitimate expectations of the Chinese government and people, so I have to make an unfortunate report to you, that is, the failure to approach the opinions on these one or two most important points may promote the inability to carry out negotiations. For ninety years, the Chinese people and government have been bound by consular jurisdiction every day. Although various countries showed goodwill to us thirty years ago and signed clauses abolishing extraterritoriality, various countries have used them as an explanation for extending extraterritoriality. Regarding this matter, various countries seem to have overlooked a most important point, that is, the patience of the Chinese people and government also has an end. The patience of human beings has a considerable limit. Would the countries wish to drive the Chinese people to a state where they can no longer continue to endure? When the Premier was dying, he indicated to us in his will on the following points, that is, 'Recently, the advocacy of opening a national assembly and abolishing unequal treaties must be realized in the shortest possible time. This is my earnest request.' Now the National Assembly has been set to open on May 5th, so today the most reasonable question of the Chinese government and people is, can the most disappearance of unequal treaties be completed when the National Assembly opens? Today, the people of the whole country recite the Premier's will at least once a week, so the implementation of a part of the will is enough to arouse the people's excitement about the unequal treaties that cannot be abolished immediately and increase their determination to abolish extraterritoriality in the shortest possible time. Since the current facts are so, for the sake of the existing international friendship and the permanent and immortal interests of each other's countries, in my position as Minister of Foreign Affairs, I have to make the most sincere hope on behalf of the Chinese government and people, that is, I hope that the United Kingdom, the United States, and other relevant countries, since they have accepted the legitimate expectations of our people and have today's achievements, will no longer hesitate and make the success that is about to be lost, and resolutely use the perspective of true statesmen to take advantage of this fleeting opportunity and cooperate with the National Government to seek the abolition of the largest obstacle of unequal treaties, consular jurisdiction. If the goals of the Chinese people and government cannot be fully achieved in the near future, then I will have to consult the agreement of the National Government authorities and declare the suspension of current negotiations."</p>
<p>Finally, a reporter asked what were the one or two most important points, and Wang replied that he could not tell them at this time. These one or two points are what the people and the government hope to achieve completely. Otherwise, the abolition of consular jurisdiction would be nominal and not real, which he himself is unwilling to do.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Arrives in Hangzhou from Ningbo</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived in Hangzhou at around 3:00 PM today (the 10th). Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Preparations in Advance The Zhejiang Provincial Government received a telegram from Xikou, Fenghua on the afternoon of the 9th, stating that Chairman Chiang had decided to go to Hangzhou from Ningbo tomorrow morning (the 10th) and could arrive at noon. It immediately convened a reception meeting overnight, designated the Provincial Government to be responsible for reception and general affairs, the Highway Bureau to be responsible for transportation, and the Security Office and the Fourth Division to be jointly responsible for security.</p>
<p>Arranging the Provisional Residence Still located at Chiang Villa in West Lake, the provincial government sent servants to clean up and arrange everything. At the same time, the Electricity Bureau was ordered to add electric lights.</p>
<p>Overview of the Welcome Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, officials from various Party, government, military, and police agencies each sent staff wearing red flower and yellow ribbon symbols to the First Pier of Sanlang Temple in Jianggan to welcome the team, totaling about three to four thousand people. Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Nanxian, along with Provincial Committee members Wang Chengying, Shi Ying, Zhang Daofan, Zhang Naiyan, etc., all crossed the river ahead of time to meet him on the riverbank. It was heard that Chairman Chiang and his wife set off from Xikou, Fenghua at 9:00 AM in the morning, arrived in Ningbo at 10:00 AM, arrived in Shaoxing at noon, and drove to Hangzhou by car at around 1:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Arrival in Hangzhou Chairman Chiang arrived at the First Pier of Jianggan at 3:20 PM in the afternoon. Military music was played at once, and the welcomers all took off their hats to pay their respects. After Chairman Chiang disembarked, he and his wife, Song Meiling, and Mrs. Kung boarded the Provincial Government's No. 1 car, and took off his hat in the car to return the salute. After the car left the pier, it drove straight to the provisional residence, Chiang Villa. Chairman Zhang and all provincial committee members took cars to follow to the provisional residence, and a banquet was held that evening to wash away the dust.</p>
<p>Consultation on Zhejiang Politics This time, Chairman Chiang returned to his hometown to sweep the tombs. Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Nanxian, accompanied by Finance Director Wang Chengying and Construction Director Shi Ying, went to Xikou to pay their respects and reported on Zhejiang's politics. When they arrived, Chiang and his wife were touring scenic spots and returning to their residence, so Zhang reported on the recent administrative situation in Zhejiang Province. Because Chairman Chiang had a word about coming to Hangzhou for a trip, the various issues were not discussed in detail and returned. It is heard that there will be a long-term discussion and decision tonight (the 10th), and all sectors of the provincial capital have a grand welcome.</p>
<p>Review of the Fourth Division Chairman Chiang is scheduled to go to the large camps of Nanxing Bridge and Meidenggao Bridge on the 11th to review the 11th Brigade of the Fourth Division of the stationed Zhejiang Army, Xu Tingyao's unit.

<h3>Hunan Representatives Request Allocation of Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Hunan Province has suffered from repeated water, drought, wind, and locust disasters for years, followed by the devastation of the communist bandits, the people are displaced, and public and private sectors are in decline. The disaster situation is extremely serious, and the relief is very urgent. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Relief Representatives Ma Linyi and Shu Guangbao requested the National Government and the Executive Yuan to urge the allocation of 100,000 silver dollars for Changsha emergency relief issued last year, and to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds to provide relief and facilitate the transfer of disaster victims to the Northeast for reclamation. The submission is recorded as follows: "I, the province, has suffered from repeated water, drought, wind, and locust disasters for years, and it is already a life-threatening situation. The communist bandits have been acting evilly, burning, killing, and looting, and they are still a hindrance to this day. The refugees are all over the road, and the corpses are piled up like mountains, spreading across dozens of counties in the province. The loss of life and property is incalculable. Natural and man-made disasters are unprecedented. Although decrees have been issued repeatedly and funds have been allocated for relief, the disaster area is too wide, and universal relief is difficult. Previously, the Executive Yuan of the Ministry issued 100,000 silver dollars for Changsha emergency relief, but it has not been allocated to this day. The wailing of the disaster victims is particularly urgent. I pray that you will order the allocation immediately to alleviate the suffering. In addition to distributing emergency relief, the fundamental solution to relief in disaster areas is relocation and reclamation. The Northeast of our country has vast territory, fertile soil, and easy reproduction. In October last year, the Hunan Provincial Government commissioned Cao Jihui to go to Heilongjiang, Harbin, and other places in the Northeast to investigate relocation matters. According to his report, the local soil is fertile and the climate is warm and suitable for disaster victims to cultivate the land. There are also many nearby gold and coal mines with rich quality that have not been developed. The forests are all over the field, and there are many local products. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, Hunan Province has successively immigrated to reclaim wasteland and has been able to develop sources of profit and live and work in peace and contentment. However, due to the remote location and the scarcity of people, the government cannot reach it, so the Japanese, Russians, and Koreans have taken the opportunity to invade, and all treasures and forests have been stolen. If relocation is not a method, the natural wealth may be lost to foreigners. The Provincial Relief Association has a rough idea of relocation, but there is no money to pay for the spring relief is extremely urgent, and the county points of work relief need to be maintained. In this decline, it is not enough to say that immigrants will be resettled without additional huge sums of money. I think that your majesty has benevolence in his heart and cares about the suffering of the people. I hope that you will pity the disaster victims and issue Hunan Provincial Disaster Relief Public Bonds of 10 million yuan, so that the province can move the disaster victims to the Northeast to reclaim the land on the one hand, and handle spring relief on the other hand, and use it for the needs of work relief afterwards, then the root and the branch will be treated together, the people's livelihood will always depend on it, and the border defense will be consolidated. All the reasons for requesting relief and resettlement should be submitted for review and approval, which is really a blessing."</p>
<h3>Shanxi Provincial Government Borrows Funds from British-American Tobacco Company</h3>
<p>Debt amount of 24 million, monthly payment of 60,000</p>
<p>Pledging the cigarette public sales tax from the entire province</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence, the price of Shanxi banknotes has been declining more and more in recent days. The third lottery redemption, although it was still held at the General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, the price still fell wildly from morning to evening. In the morning, each silver dollar could only be exchanged for 3 yuan and 12 jiao in banknotes, but in the afternoon, it soared to 3 yuan and 45 jiao. If you use provincial banknotes to buy silver dollars, it is 3 yuan, 7 jiao, 8 jiao, and it is still not easy to buy. In order to urgently raise funds for relief, the provincial government has negotiated with the Tianjin British-American Tobacco Company for a large loan, hoping to alleviate the urgent situation. Although the official has not yet announced this loan, the society is rumored to have been concluded. It is heard that the debt amount is 24 million yuan, with a monthly payment of 600,000, and the cigarette public sales tax from the entire province of Shanxi is pledged. Although it is a loan in name, there are actually no conditions. Only the Shanxi Provincial Government recognizes that the British-American Tobacco Company can sell and distribute freely in Shanxi Province without affixing tax stamps. The company pays 600,000 yuan in tobacco taxes per month. If the Shanxi Bureau does not change, this treaty will continue to be valid, with the payment of 24 million yuan as the deadline, otherwise it will be terminated. It is said that the cancellation of the old cigarette public sales bureau was discussed and decided at the provincial government meeting a few days ago. Now the various cigarettes of the British-American Tobacco Company have been openly sold in the market without tax stamps. It is heard that the representatives of both parties have formally signed the contract yesterday, and the first batch of 600,000 yuan to be paid has been extracted from Tianjin by the provincial bank.

<h3>Yu-Wan-E Border Command Moved from Wuhan to Henan</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Yu-Wan-E Border Pacification Commissioner's Office moved from Xinyang to Hankou. It has been two months now and it is quite inconvenient to command. Commissioner Li Mingzhong had previously gone to Beijing in person to ask Commander-in-Chief Chiang for strategies. After being told in person, he moved the office to Huangchuan. After Li was ordered, he returned to Hankou by plane to prepare for the move. Just when the southern section of the Pinghan Road had just been repaired, the troops were mobilized, the passengers and goods were crowded, and the vehicles were not enough to distribute. Li then sent a part of the personnel to Huangchuan first to deploy everything, and asked the headquarters to transfer the road bureau to prepare vehicles. On the morning of the 8th, Li led the staff of various offices and took a special train north to Xinyang, and then took a car to Huangchuan. In Hankou, only a communication office was set up in the old command, and Lu Jinhou, director of the Wuhan office of the 22nd Route Army Headquarters, was concurrently appointed as the director to handle logistics matters and cut off contact with the Wuhan Headquarters. As for the bandits in the three provinces, their main force seemed to be on the border between Yu and Wan. After several encirclements and suppressions, most of them have been broken. The deployment of the bandit suppression army is extremely strict. As soon as the Commissioner's Office moves to Huang, a general attack order will be issued, with a view to thoroughly suppress it before May 5th. (April 8)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Finance Department Investigates the Silver Industry Association</h3>
<p>Because the association issues and circulates receipts</p>
<p>The authorities believe it is destroying finance</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the Guangzhou Silver Industry Association issued a type of circulating receipt for the convenience of settlement (equivalent to a foreign check). The method is that when a silver shop that accepts the receipt takes the receipt to the silver shop that issued the receipt to receive the silver, the silver shop that issued the receipt must pay the silver in cash and must not transfer it to another silver shop to receive the money. If the acceptance of the receipt to the issuing silver shop to receive the silver, if you are unwilling to receive Yuehao, but entrust the purchase of Hong Kong banknotes, the entrustment time is before 11:00 am, the mid-market will be calculated at a price of 2 jiao per thousand Hong Kong dollars, and after 11:00 am and before 3:00 pm, the early market of the next day will also be calculated at a price of 2 jiao per thousand Hong Kong dollars, and both parties must write a certificate and hand it to each other as proof. All receipts have been written by the issuing number with the date, month, and year, and the store seal is affixed to the back of the receipt, then the receipt is used as storage and no interest is calculated. If there is a dispute between the exchange parties on the silver color, they should notify the Use Hao Paper Association to notify both parties to the meeting for use, and should not violate it. If the issuing number violates the above method, the acceptance number should immediately report to the Silver Industry Association for mediation. If the issuing silver shop does not report to the Association for mediation, a fine of 30 yuan will be imposed. If it does not pay, the entire industry will be notified to cut off economic ties with the shop until the shop pays the fine and handles the payment of the money in accordance with the method, and then the entire industry will be notified to restore the shop's exchange. However, when this circulating receipt was issued (issued from April 1), it was not filed with the official office in advance. Later, the Finance Department reported that the receipts issued by the association had a great impact on the financial sector, and the receipts were based on Hong Kong banknotes in an invisible form, which may discriminate against the national currency. Then, at 4:00 pm on the 2nd, a secret order was issued, ordering Xu, the first section chief of the department, to investigate. After receiving the order, Xu immediately led six special agents from the Finance Department to the Silver Industry Association in Xirong Lane. One side informed the police and entered the association together to search. At that time, a cadre of the association was in the seat. Knowing that he was here to handle the case according to the order of the Finance Department, he listened to his search. After checking and moving the time, he found many documents and the resolutions of repeated meetings, and investigated the method and attempt of the association to issue circulating receipts clearly before returning to the department to report. However, the person in charge was not detained at that time. It is heard that the president of the association has been interrogated by the Finance Department and went to the Finance Department in person to explain. This matter may not be difficult to solve.

<p>Important News 2</p>
<h3>Bombing Incident in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Robbing Ship Pirates Place Bombs Due to Unsuccessful Extortion</p>
<p>One Dead and One Injured in Renhe Company's Old and Young Shop Owners</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province's pirates have become rampant again recently. The Ji Hong Dang bandits, who are famous for robbing ships, have been sending letters to various ferries for days to extort money. The letter was mailed to the Inland Navigation Association, stating that this hall has organized an escort team. Due to financial difficulties, please inform all ferries that each ship must help protect 1,000 yuan. Now this hall has sent people to ambush bombs to bomb the Dutongxing Company in Zhaoqing Province, etc. After receiving the letter, the association thought that the bandit was trying to intimidate and did not pay attention to it. I didn’t want the bandit party to be so fearless of the law. Yesterday (the 2nd) morning, someone was sent to carry a bomb and secretly placed it at the gate of Renhe Shipping Company in Renji Street, Xihoukou (the company is an agent for the ferry business in Ducheng, Zhaoqing). That morning, Huang Xihong, the son of Huang Jingong, the owner of the company (that is, the young owner), returned to the company from his private residence for dinner. Just as he walked to the front steps of the gate, he saw a package, which was bound with light grass. He suspected and opened it. Before it was unsealed, the internal mechanism suddenly vibrated, and there was a loud noise, which shook the roof. Huang Xihong's limbs were blown off by the bullet, his abdomen was broken, and his intestines flowed out. In the bloody state, he could only be recognized. When the explosion occurred, the owner Huang Jingong ran downstairs to inspect and was also hit by shrapnel and seriously injured. At the same time, a maid of a doctor across the street was chopping wood outside the door and was also slightly injured. Xu Fuying and Yao Ying were injured who were passing by. After the incident, the police sub-bureau immediately sent a large team of armed police to suppress and searched for suspects at the scene of the incident. Traffic was blocked. After moving the time, he detained Zeng, a partner of No. 20 neighbor, Huang, a partner of Renhe Company, and Liao, a partner of No. 15, to the bureau for questioning. They all said that they did not know anything about it, so they were released separately. According to Huang Li, the mistress of Renhe Company, who lives at No. 16, Fengyuan West 1st Lane, Xiguan, and is from Xinhui, Huang Jingong, who was injured, is her husband, and Huang Xihong, who was bombed to death, is her son, 18 years old. She said that she returned to the store this morning and suffered this tragedy. Now Huang Jingong has been admitted to the municipal hospital for treatment, and Huang Xihong's body has also been sent by the court to the regional hospital for burial. The authorities have secretly arrested the bandits in this case. (April 3)</p>
<h3>Shantou Anti-Foreign Ship Tide to be Resolved</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Last month, the four shipping companies of Swire, Nanji, Daxin, Hetong, and Boning in Shantou jointly increased the prices of passenger tickets to Singapore, Penang, and Rangoon, which caused opposition from all walks of life and the travel industry association. The boycott of foreign ships was implemented from March 1st. Later, Mayor Zhang Lun convened representatives from both sides to the municipal government for mediation. Recently, the opinions of both sides have gradually become closer. However, the relationship between shipping companies and the travel industry has always been very deep. Since the outbreak of this tide, countless branch problems have suddenly emerged. The municipal government entrusted You Jianchi, the comprador of Jardine Matheson, to take on the responsibility of mediation. On the 1st of this month, You had obtained the consent of the four companies. Starting in April, the tickets to Singapore were restored to the original price of 36 yuan, and the Lian'an Yixue funds of the Travel Industry Association were subsidized as before. As for the travel industry association's previous deduction of 5 jiao and 3 fen per ticket as membership fees, it is still the same as before. You summoned representatives from various associations in the travel industry on the 2nd to discuss for a long time, and they were generally satisfied. On the evening of the 2nd, the Committee against Foreign Shipping Companies' Price Increase held an emergency meeting on this matter and discussed it all night without any results. Another meeting was held on the morning of the 3rd. Currently, the ships of the four companies going to Siam have been approved to carry passengers, and those going to Singapore and Penang still do not drop off passengers. The Antung ship of Swire and the Wansfells ship of Daxin are currently berthed in Shantou Port, waiting for a solution, in the hope of dropping off passengers immediately and going to Singapore to Penang.

After Yao stole the paintings, he handed them over to the Wu brothers to sell in Shanghai. After the incident, the three hid in Shanghai. The county government sent detectives to Shanghai several times to cooperate with the police detectives to investigate and arrest them, but they have not been arrested. Yesterday, Yao suddenly sneaked back home and was detected by the owner. He immediately reported to the detective team, which sent detectives to arrest Yao and send him to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the county government for strict investigation.

<p>Wife Commits Suicide by Poison After Being Abused by Husband: Gu Cai Tao Wang Zhou Ding from Dongxiang married a Ms. Lu from Xuhang, and they had children. Two years ago, he married a concubine, a woman from Taicang, and showed her excessive favor. Soon, the concubine absconded with money, and he blamed Ms. Lu, abusing her in every way and repeatedly beating her. Ms. Lu repeatedly sought refuge at her mother's home, but relatives persuaded her to return each time. On the 4th of this month, Wang's mother went to Xuhang to personally welcome her back, and Ms. Lu's mother also accompanied her home. After Ms. Lu's mother left, Wang beat Ms. Lu three times on the evening of the 8th, prompting her to consider suicide. The next morning, she secretly ingested a large amount of opium. People noticed and called for a doctor, but it was too late to save her. In the afternoon, the Xuhang Public Security Substation detained Wang and brought him to the county. During interrogation, he confessed that his wife, Ms. Lu, had indeed committed suicide by ingesting raw opium, but denied any prior abuse. On the 10th, Judge Zhang went to the countryside to conduct an inspection.</p>

<p>Major Fire at Hejiagang, Zhujie Pavilion: A fire suddenly broke out at the home of Ren A'mei in Lane 17 of Hejiagang, Zhujie Pavilion in this county, at around 3 PM the day before yesterday. At the time, the wind was quite strong, and flames quickly shot through the roof. By the time fire brigades from various districts arrived to help, the fire had already spread to five or six houses. A four-year-old child from the Ren family, who was sleeping upstairs, could not be rescued and perished in the flames. The fire was extinguished after burning for more than two hours, causing immense losses. The home of local head Jin Qiuquan suffered the most damage. On that day, the entire Jin family had gone to a relative's house in the city, so the doors were tightly locked. During the fire, none of the goods inside were salvaged, and all the silver and grain notes were burned. When Jin Qiuquan returned home and learned of this, he was overwhelmed with grief and died of a sudden fit of anger. It was a truly tragic event.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver Industry in Suzhou Discusses Business Tax: The gold and silver industry in Jiangsu province, in order to discuss the business tax issue, held a meeting in Shanghai on March 31st, convened by the Shanghai Gold Shop Association. However, because the number of participating counties was small, it was changed to yesterday (the 10th) at the Lizhe Public Office in Liujia Bang, Suzhou, for a meeting of representatives from various counties. The result was a decision to send representatives to Nanjing to petition. The reason is roughly that the Ministry of Finance's revised business tax rate lists the industry's jewelry with consumer and entertainment items, levying a tax of ten per thousand. The outline of the business tax is based on the industry, clearly knowing that it is completely different from the customs tax, which focuses on items. If detailed classification is done by item, the original purpose of reducing taxes to help merchants would instead increase the burden and harm the people. Furthermore, this time the tax reduction, as far as the industry is concerned, the government has not felt a loss. Gold and silver are tangible, and like bank and money house deposits and loans, they are a circulation of currency and belong to the activities of subsidizing the market's finance. They are not like antiques, jade, which only supply individual preferences, nor are they like cosmetics, which imply a consumption nature. As for the labor costs, they are only enough to cover the workers' lives, and the shop has no profit to make. It should be exempt from taxation, and so on.</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice Orders Retrieval of Case Files for Liyang Canal Scandal: In the Liyang field tax embezzlement case, all eleven people involved, including Pan Bin, appealed to the High Court because they disagreed with the Zhenjiang Local Court's sentence of imprisonment.

<p>Guerrilla Force Transferred to Songhu to Suppress Bandits: Zhang Han, the district chief of the 4th District of the Wusong Water Police, because of rampant sea bandits, had planned to transfer the water guerrilla force stationed in Suzhou to be stationed in Wusong.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Reasons for the Destruction of the Sixth District Office: After the Zhenhu Motor Road, the Changtai section of which this county should be responsible for building, began construction on the 6th of this month, workers from the Sixth District had a conflict with the district office over the tea and snack fees for subsidies (yesterday's error was about the collection of fields). The workers then destroyed the district office. It is now heard that after the incident on the 8th, the district chief reported to the county government, and Chen Qiwei, the director of the Construction Bureau, after hearing the report, due to the importance of the matter, took a gasoline boat to the countryside overnight to investigate and learn the reasons for the destruction of the district office. The wages for recruiting workers to build the road, according to the regulations promulgated by the Ministry, are all the obligations of the residents of the area. However, each square foot is provided with a certain amount of tea money. This county originally set it at 1.2 cents per square foot, but was rejected by the Construction Department, which only allowed 1 cent per square foot, totaling 7,000 yuan. However, the Construction Department has not yet approved the appropriation of the funds. In order to appease the road construction workers, the Construction Bureau first allocated 2,000 yuan to the Sixth District Office to distribute to Baimao and Zhitang for application. Each place only has 1,000 yuan, which is really insufficient to manage, and the villagers who build the road think they have been deceived and are unwilling to work. This is the biggest reason for the incident. Later, when the workers were about to start work, suddenly more than a dozen women lay in the fields, blocking the Liu wasteland. The reason was that the wheat in the fields would soon be ripe. If it were removed now, it would damage the agricultural products, so they were obstructing. The workers, seeing this situation, reported to the road construction office and the district office. District Chief Gu Renmin, fearing that it would cause trouble, ordered employees to go to mediate, but did not know how a conflict occurred. Soon, dozens of villagers rushed into the district office, destroying doors, windows, and other items, and part of the district's household registration and road construction population registration were torn up by the villagers. Now that the time for clearing the countryside is about to end, it is feared that it will be difficult to copy and replenish them in time. After Chen, the director of the Construction Bureau, investigated, he telegraphed the department to report the Zhitang incident and requested that the funds be used quickly. Soon, he received a provincial telegram approving payment by the Bank of China. Director Chen went to the countryside on the 10th to distribute it, and it is expected that there will be no problem.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Property of Lingguan Temple: Lingguan Temple in Dongda Street in the city of this county, after being approved by the first district's fifth and sixth town offices to be used as the town office, Zhou Linchu and others, using private property as a name, came out to obstruct and seize it, causing lawsuits for many months. Later, Shao Xuansun, the town chief, and Wang Zhiming, together with the evidence, considered it public property, and repeatedly argued according to reason, and submitted it to the county government for public decision, which has been decided on file. It is now learned that Qian Zhongliang, the district chief of the first district, yesterday received instructions from the Civil Affairs Department, approving the temporary use of the temple by the fifth and sixth town offices. If the Zhou family can provide solid evidence, they will submit it for review and decision. After receiving the order, District Chief Qian has already forwarded a letter to the town chiefs of the fifth and sixth towns in the central district to inform them.</p>
<p>Yu of Tianxia Market Robbed: Yu Liangsan's family in the northeast of Tianxia Market in the sixth district of this county was robbed at about 11 pm the day before yesterday. More than a dozen bandits armed with pistols and flashlights broke into the house. One of the bandits fired a shot to show force, and the rest entered the house, overturning boxes and cabinets, and arbitrarily searching. After about three hours, they left with a shout. During the robbery, Yu Qiaoquan, a neighbor who relied on his strength, resisted the bandits and was shot. The bullet grazed his body and luckily did not injure him. After the incident, it was found that 342 yuan in cash, five gold rings, one gold button, one gold bracelet, 350 new and old beads, and leather clothing were stolen, totaling more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Hunan Refugees Passing Through Cause Disturbances: In the second district of Xishu (Jingyun City), at Ren Village Temple Longzhu Nunnery, east of Zhoujing Lane, suddenly there were four to five hundred Hunan refugees, men, women, old and young, with an aggressive attitude. The refugee leaders, Zeng and He, invited the village chief and tuchen of the village. Unexpectedly, some refugees scouted around, going to nearby villages, and removed the wood stacks without permission. At night, they set fire to the Wu family's wood stack. At the time, the fire was so bright that it could not be approached. Wu Hongfang, the owner of the wood, was terrified at the sight and collapsed to the ground. He soon died of asphyxiation. The next day, the village chiefs, Zhou and Yan, gathered several stones of rice and gave them to the refugee leaders, who then led the refugees away.</p>

<p>Conference to Rectify Local Finances: The county's finances have recently been affected by a shortage of field tax revenue and the impoverishment of the people, and are becoming increasingly tight.

<p>Levying of Surcharges on Yellow Croaker: Because the expenses of the poor children's home of the relief agency were stretched, it requested the county's permission to collect one cent per shipment from the yellow croaker shipments of the fish markets. The markets would collect the money and settle accounts daily. The fish markets opposed this greatly, claiming that small and miscellaneous taxes had already been cancelled. Yesterday (the 9th), the county government convened a meeting of fish markets to implement a temporary trial. From one shipment to one hundred, the fee is one cent per shipment; one hundred to five hundred, the fee is eight li per shipment; five hundred to one thousand, the fee is seven li per shipment; one thousand to five thousand, the fee is six li per shipment; five thousand to ten thousand, the fee is five li per shipment.</p>

She has been married to Jiang for eleven years and has two daughters, the elder seven years old and the younger two years old. When she first entered the family, the couple was harmonious, but later, because Jiang's sister had an affair with her brother, she incited him, causing the relationship between Jiang and his wife to deteriorate. At first, they quarreled, and then they fought. Whenever the couple quarreled, the mother-in-law and the younger sister-in-law would always help and insult her in every way. It is now known that yesterday (the 8th) evening, for some unknown reason, the couple quarreled again.

<h3>Amid Yesterday's Torrential Rain</h3>
<p>East China Scores a Decisive 10-0 Victory Over Central China</p>
<p>——Eight Goals in the First Half, Two in the Second——</p>
<p>——Central China's Fighting Spirit Praiseworthy Throughout——</p>
<p>—Divisional Football Tournament, Act Two………Some Central China Players to Return to Wuhan Tonight—</p>
<p>North China vs. East China Championship Decider Tomorrow at 3 PM</p>
<p>The national divisional football tournament, Act Two, took place yesterday. At 4 PM, amid torrential rain, East China decisively defeated Central China with a score of 10-0 at the China Baseball Field. The match was one-sided, with only a few hundred spectators present. However, both teams exhibited remarkable spirit, especially Central China, who, despite a crushing defeat, fought to the very end. With victory secured, East China playfully shuffled their lineup, with Zhou Xianyan, Feng Yunyou, Jiang Shanqing, and Li Ning all playing as forwards, while Dai Linjing, Xi Qiaosheng, Luo Haiguang, Chen Zhenhe, and Chen Hongguang took up defensive positions. This humorous and amusing change was a novel move for East China's football scene and worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Team Lineups</p>
<p>▲East China Team</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Feng Yunyou, Jiang Shanqing, Li Shutang, Li Ning, Chen Pu, Chen Zhenhe, Luo Haiguang, Dai Linjing, Chen Hongguang, Xi Qiaosheng</p>
<p>▲Central China Team</p>
<p>Tang Shunhua, Cheng Guoyin, Zhao Lanquan, Lu Xuehai, Yu Keding, Cai Yidian, Li Pizu, Zhou Fanwei, Wang Yide, Wu Shirong, Yang Enci</p>
<p>Match Summary</p>
<p>A One-Sided Affair, Resistance Futile</p>
<p>Given the once-renowned East China team facing the underdog Central China team, the situation was akin to throwing a stone at an egg—inevitably crushing it. Thus, throughout yesterday's match, Central China was under immense pressure, with no room to maneuver. East China relentlessly attacked at will, maintaining possession of the ball. The game was entirely one-sided. During the ninety-minute match, the ball was in front of Central China's goal for approximately sixty to seventy minutes, rarely crossing the midline into East China's territory. Goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan only kicked the ball four or five times in total, illustrating the overall game's dynamics.</p>
<p>East China Dominates</p>
<p>With both teams lined up in the rain, referee He Chunhui signaled the start, and the rain-soaked battle began. Central China had the initial advantage of attacking first, but Chen Pu intercepted the ball and passed it forward to Chen Hongguang. Under Dai Linjing's command to attack, the entire team advanced. Chen Zhenhe attacked on the left, narrowly missing the goal, which already put Central China on edge. Subsequently, Cai Yidian kicked a free kick, but Li Ning intercepted it in the center, passing it to Dai, then to Hei Tan, along the side. Luo Haiguang assisted with an attack on the goal, which was deflected to the left. Xi Qiaosheng hooked a shot that landed in front of the goal, and Dai, as the center forward, struck it with his foot, barely grazing the top of the goalpost before bouncing into the net, unstoppable.</p>
<p>One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight</p>
<p>Once the scoring began, East China's goals came incessantly, like a surging tide crashing towards Central China. By the end of the first half, they had racked up an impressive 8-0 lead. Luo Haiguang's shot on goal was saved into a corner kick. Hei Tan took the corner, the ball went to Chen Hongguang, then to Xi Qiaosheng, resulting in another corner kick. Liang Shutang caught up and scored from thirty yards away, making it 2-0. Twenty minutes in, Luo Haiguang shot, and the goalkeeper, despite diving, couldn't hold onto the ball, which rolled into the goal, making it 3-0. Chen Hongguang's long shot slipped past the goalkeeper, giving East China a four-goal lead. Still, they continued their relentless assault. Hei Tan kicked a corner kick, and Chen Hongguang again scored, making it "five sons scoring high" [a phrase for achieving great success]. Chen Hongguang and Dai Linjing coordinated, dribbling upwards, until Dai scored another goal in front of the net, slowly making it 6-0. Luo Haiguang shot, the goalkeeper punched it out, and Chen Hongguang scored his seventh goal. Chen Hongguang dribbled in again, and Cheng Guoyin rushed forward to defend. Chen paused, and Cheng charged forward, allowing Chen Hongguang to score again, making the halftime score 8-0.</p>
<p>A Perfect Ending, Completing the Ten</p>
<p>After a short rest, the fighting resumed. East China continued their relentless pressure. Within five minutes, Dai, the center forward, scored two goals, but the referee disallowed them both for offside, but he didn't take it to heart. After about ten minutes, Chen Hongguang, all alone, advanced again, the goalkeeper fell to the ground, and the ball rolled into the goal, making it 9-0. Then, Chen Pu and Jiang Shanqing switched positions, as did Liang Shutang and Feng Yunyou, to achieve a completely offensive formation. Finally, Luo Haiguang added one more goal, completing the perfect score of ten to zero.</p>
<p>Full Lineup Switch, A Unique Spectacle</p>
<p>Seeing that the outcome was certain and Central China had no chance to attack, East China began a complete lineup switch, with attackers playing defense and defenders playing offense. This resulted in the following formation:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Chen Zhenhe, Chen Pu, Luo Haiguang, Dai Linjing, Xi Qiaosheng, Feng Yunyou, Liang Shutang, Li Ning, Chen Hongguang, Jiang Shanqing</p>
<p>The three major defenders suddenly became the center forward and wingers. It's a shame they didn't score, or it would have been even more spectacular. Then, Zhou Xianyan, feeling neglected at the goal, and not wanting his wife to stand in the rain, eagerly wanted to try attacking, so he also switched to an attacking position. A great farce began, and the spectators burst into laughter at the spectacle. However, the lineup changed so frequently that it was hard to keep track. The following is an approximation, just to get a glimpse. The battle soon came to an end.</p>
<p>Liang Shutang, Dai Linjing, Chen Pu, Luo Haiguang, Chen Hongsheng, Xi Qiaosheng, Feng Yunyou, Chen Zhenhe, Li Ning, Zhou Xianyan, Jiang Shanqing</p>
<p>Displaying Spirit</p>
<p>Central China's Unwavering Fighting Spirit</p>
<p>The most admirable aspect of this match was undoubtedly the spirit of Central China. Facing inevitable defeat, they still traveled far to compete, learning from others' strengths to compensate for their weaknesses, preparing to promote the sport upon their return. This is one aspect. The match emphasized spirit over victory or defeat. Central China fought to the end in both matches, never giving up. This is another aspect. Despite the heavy rain, they did not shy away from hardship and requested that the game proceed as scheduled. This is yet another aspect. From this, we know that Central China's sports will undoubtedly flourish in the future.</p>
<p>No Intact Eggs Under Heavy Blows</p>
<p>As for assessing the performance of the two teams yesterday, it is difficult to elaborate. East China's strength is undoubtedly extraordinary, requiring no further embellishment. However, it must be noted that the performance of the newcomer, Chen Hongguang, was excellent yesterday. His movements were swift, and his shots were accurate, making him very promising. He scored five goals alone. Central China rarely got the ball, mostly involving the goalkeeper and defenders. The heavy rain made the ground slippery, making running and jumping difficult. The ball was heavy and wet, making it hard for the goalkeeper to catch. Therefore, they cannot be overly criticized. In short, it is difficult to expect intact eggs under heavy blows. The order of East China's goals yesterday is listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Dai Linjing, (2) Liang Shutang, (3) Luo Haiguang, (4, 5) both Chen Hong, (6) Dai Linjing, (7, 8, 9) Chen Hongguang, (10) Luo Haiguang. In total, Chen Hongguang scored five goals, Dai Linjing two goals, Luo Haiguang two goals, and Liang Shutang one goal.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Final</p>
<p>—East China vs. North China Championship—</p>
<p>The tournament will conclude tomorrow with East China and North China facing off for the championship. The match will start at 3 PM, again at the China Baseball Field.</p>

<p>Song Ruhai Requests Next Divisional Football Tournament to Be Held in Wuhan. Song Ruhai, the leader of the Central China team, will fly back to Wuhan tomorrow morning. Yesterday, he requested that the next divisional football tournament be held in Wuhan. He also wants to apply for the next National Games to be held in Wuhan. Since Mr. Song began promoting football in Wuhan, the number of football teams has increased to over ten. Mayor Liu Wendao is enthusiastic about sports and spares no effort. Recently, the municipal government meeting approved a plan to allocate over 800,000 yuan to build the Zhongshan Sports Hall, which can be used for future divisional football tournaments and the National Games. A portion of the Central China team will return to Wuhan by boat tomorrow night.

<h3>Shanghai Education Bureau Hosted Banquet Last Night</h3>
<p>To Entertain the Sports Community</p>
<p>Shanghai's sports development is almost the best in the country. In the past, various sports were mostly under the control of foreigners, with Chinese people subject to their whims. This situation of guests taking over the host's role and servants acting as masters was a disgrace to the sovereignty of sports. Since the establishment of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation, the Shanghai sports community, under its guidance and promotion, has been actively developing on the basis of its own sovereignty. As a result, Shanghai's sports sovereignty has gradually returned to us. Now, the Shanghai Education Bureau, following the National Government's promotion of sports, plans to expand the city's sports activities. The first step in the plan to cultivate sports in Shanghai is the first Shanghai Mayor's Long-Distance Race on the 19th of this month and the first Shanghai Secondary School Joint Sports Meet from the 24th to the 26th of this month. To coordinate the cooperation between the sports and news communities, the education authorities hosted a banquet at the Tongxinglou last night, inviting over forty people from the city's sports community, including Shen Siliang, Rong Qizhao, Ling Xitao, Jiang Xiangqing, Xu Zhendong, Wang Fudan, Zhou Jiaqi, Qian Yiqin, Wu Yanzhang, Shen Binan, Wang Zhensheng, Chen Bingde, Jia Zizheng, Huang Wenjian, Li Jiyuan, and Gu Zhengla, as well as reporters from various newspapers. The secretariat director and supervisor of the Education Bureau hosted the event. Halfway through the banquet, Bureau Chief Xu Peihuang stood up and delivered a speech, saying that he was honored to have the sports and news communities present tonight. With the support of all parties, the bureau's planned long-distance race and secondary school joint sports meet are progressing smoothly. There has been an enthusiastic response to the long-distance race, with over 230 participants. This activity, held on public roads, can greatly arouse the interest of the general public who have not yet visited sports venues and the athletic meet has been approved by the Federation to be held at their athletic field and with the agreement of the gentlemen present, they have generously accepted the various roles and he is extremely grateful.</p>

<p>The Min Li Girls' High School volleyball team, taking advantage of the holiday to visit Suzhou, won their first match against Zhenhua and their second match against the Dongwu Girls' School with a score of 3-0. This top team from Shanghai is truly extraordinary. Jing Haihui and Ling, due to the end of their holiday and the resumption of classes, even though they had planned a practice match, could not do so. Min Li was originally scheduled to leave Suzhou on the afternoon of the 10th. On the morning of that day, they arranged a match with the Suzhou Girls' High School. The Suzhou Girls' High School has been the champion of the Jiangsu Province volleyball tournament for two years. The Shanghai and Suzhou teams met on the morning of at 10am. The Min Li girls in shorts and bare legs, were very impressive. After the start of the game, the Suzhou Girls' High School's original players had not all arrived, causing them to be frightened and lose ground rapidly. In three sets, they suffered a crushing defeat. In this visit to Suzhou, Min Li played three matches and won all three. The women overpowered the Wunong.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Further Clarifies Education Association Issues</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has repeatedly received requests from the Shanghai Education Bureau and the Jiangsu Education Department for clarification regarding education association issues. Here is a summary: (1) Members of the district education association who meet the qualifications in items 1 and 2 of Article 16 of the Education Association Law should join the district education association according to their place of service. Those who meet the qualifications in other items of the same article should join the district education association in their place of residence. (2) According to the Education Association Law, the county education association and its affiliated district education associations should be supervised by the county government. However, the county education bureau, as a part of the county government's organization, may, when necessary, supervise the county and district education associations under the order of the county government. As for financial subsidies, the county government should plan comprehensively for the entire county's finances and allocate funds directly, or the education bureau may forward the funds, both of which are feasible. (3) Education seals should be issued by the respective supervisory authorities. The seals should be square wooden blocks, 5.5 centimeters on each side. The seal of the provincial education association should read "Seal of the [Province Name] Education Association." The seal of the county or city education association should read "Seal of the [County/City Name] Education Association." The seal of the district education association should read "Seal of the [County/City Name] [Number] District Education Association." (4) Item 4 of Article 16 of the Education Association Law refers to schools equivalent to old-system middle schools as those with a study period at least the same as old-system middle schools, such as old-system normal undergraduate programs and various type-A vocational schools. The study period of normal training courses and simple normal courses is shorter than that of old-system middle schools, so they cannot be considered equivalent to old-system middle schools. Their graduates cannot, of course, invoke the provisions of Item 4 of Article 10 of the Education Association Law to obtain education association membership.</p>

<h3>Remembering Mr. Yuan Hanyun</h3>
<p>— Yuyizhai</p>
<p>Mr. Hanyun, as a noble young master, visited Shanghai. His interactions with dignitaries were the talk of the town. The news of his death has brought grief to those who know him and those who don't. Such is the nature of fame. Major and minor newspapers have reported on his life and deeds, but much of it is hearsay. I have known Mr. Hanyun for a long time and understand his character. I am writing a few lines, perhaps to be of interest to those who wish to know him. Mr. Hanyun's given name was Ke Wen, courtesy name Xiaozhi. The names Leopard Cen and Bao Cun mentioned in the newspapers are also his pseudonyms. He was intelligent and quick-witted. He associated with seniors such as Yi Shifu and Fan Fanshan, and was able to compose short poems. He could instantly compose two jueju in one breath. (When he first became addicted to opium, he mostly wrote poems and calligraphy in bed. He was lazy and would lie down or indulge in opium unless absolutely necessary.) When writing calligraphy, he also often lay down and wielded the brush, with one person holding one end of the paper. He leaned on a pillow and wrote without the use of guidelines, yet the writing was not skewed. People praised him for his poetry and calligraphy, and his reputation spread. Furthermore, because his father had once ascended the throne, he became widely known. Some compared him to Cao Zhi, but this may be an overstatement. If Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai) can be compared to Cao Cao, then he was certainly no less talented than Cao Zhi. I especially admire him for not being tainted by the extravagance of noble youths and for treating people with utmost kindness. Even to servants, he never raised his voice. He was quick to help others and generous, which is commendable. When he was in Shanghai, I would often visit him in the evening. If he was still in bed, I would barge in and urge him to get up. He would then put on his clogs and we would talk late into the night. He would call for tea and cigarettes, and if the servants were not around, he would do it himself, without ordering others. He would wash the spittoon or tidy the smoking set, and if he had time, he would do it himself. If the servants were not around, he would not scold them, but would even say, "Since I can do it myself, there's no need to bother you." Years ago, Yu Shuyan came south and offended someone, and there was talk of trouble. He went to Mr. Yuan, who resolved the situation with a single word. Another day, Mr. Yuan was drinking with friends and me in a restaurant. One of them was passionately discussing national affairs. Just as he was speaking, a police officer passed by and wanted to arrest him for the sake of promotion. He gathered a crowd to wait for him to come out. The man was unaware. At that time, Yuan Shikai was in power and strictly controlled speech. A casual remark could lead to disaster. His friend tried to stop him with his eyes, but he was oblivious. Mr. Yuan, fearing that he would be harmed, took him by the arm and boarded a car. The police officer feared the consequences and could only stand by helplessly. His chivalry was no less than that of Zhu Hai or Guo Jie. These two incidents were witnessed by me and may be more credible than the rumors of military and national affairs in the palace. However, they are sufficient to show his life and character. Unable to attend the funeral due to being far away, I write these few lines in place of mourning, and to tell those who wish to know Mr. Yuan.</p>
<h3>Animal Languages of Africa</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Africa is located in the tropics. The weather is hot and blazing, and the vegetation is lush. Many animals gather there. Monkeys climb giant trees, leaping and flying. They love to eat fruit. Gentlemen cut open coconuts and set up traps to catch them. When the monkeys are enjoying the fruit, the trap is triggered, and their hands are bound. Once tamed, they can be used by humans. They can also lure their own kind. The fiercest of these animals is the gorilla. The natives fear and respect them, viewing them as gods. Every summer, they hold a sacrificial ceremony. A native woman is chosen, stripped naked, and made to sit among the trees. Then the gorilla arrives. Gorillas are naturally lecherous. Seeing the naked woman, they make obscene gestures and defile her. After this happens two or three times, the woman is unable to endure the abuse and dies. Even if she manages to escape, she becomes paralyzed for life, losing her ability to move. The natives believe that by performing the sacrificial ceremony, they can avoid disasters. They consider this a cause for joy and celebration. Sometimes tigers swim across rivers. When the natives see them, they submerge in the water. One person grabs a tiger's leg and pulls it down. The tiger, submerged, cannot use its strength. It is captured as easily as a tied dog. Every time a tiger is killed, the natives celebrate and dance, singing songs with rhythmic steps. The meat is used with wine, the skin is used for clothing, and the bones are used to make utensils and toys. Nothing is wasted. Zebras run with incredible speed, far beyond what ordinary horses can achieve. They are perhaps similar to the legendary steeds of ancient times, such as the Qiji and Jueqi. The giraffe is said to be the same as the Qilin, a sacred beast recorded in our ancient books. It is unknown whether this is true. They are weak and cannot fight other animals. However, their hearing is exceptionally keen. They can hear the movement of large animals from a mile or two away and hide themselves, so they are rarely harmed. Crocodiles are found everywhere in the lakes and swamps. They lay long, oval eggs. During late summer and early autumn, small crocodiles hatch from the eggs, crawling along the banks of the swamps. Their numbers are countless. Even if Chang Li were reborn, he could not describe them all in writing. Crocodiles love to eat ants. Their method of catching ants is particularly clever. Their scales are very smelly. The crocodile lies still on the bank. The ants, smelling the odor, are drawn to it and gather on its scales. Once many have gathered, the crocodile submerges into the green water. The ants all float to the surface. Then, it opens its mouth and swallows them without effort. There are many snakes, coiled and intertwined on bridges. The natives throw sharp hooks to sever their bodies. Snake blood drips down, collected in jars. It is considered a supreme delicacy, no less than fine wine or jade nectar.</p>
<h3>Butterfly Shadow, Cuckoo Song</h3>
<p>— Wang Meiju</p>
<p>The singing girl Red Peony is China's first all-sound dialogue singing blockbuster. Under the direction and script writing of Mr. Zhang Shichuan and Zheng Zhengqiu of the Star Film Company, the splendor of Ms. Hu Die and the entire cast is made even more vivid and moving. The completeness of this drama opens the pre-era of Chinese sound films. It is already widely known for its beauty, its sound has shaken people, and everyone praises it. There is no need for an untalented person like me to make a crowing sound at dawn. Due to professional constraints, I was unable to attend the test screening. Only yesterday did I receive a special viewing ticket from my student Wu Ziji of the New Central Company. During the viewing, I shed tears several times. After returning home, my dreams were still troubled. I will briefly express my feelings below.</p>
<p>▲ Hu Die is the embodiment of Red Peony Hu Die's beauty, talent, and singing voice had already captivated me when she played the Great Grape Fairy. Now, watching this film, I was deeply moved by many scenes, such as her reluctantly submitting to her mother's wish to marry Chen Er Ye, and her subsequent efforts to reclaim her daughter after their falling out, and the scene of visiting the prison and giving money. She was resentful but not angry, with tears in her eyes. When she acted as Red Peony visiting her mother, she cried bitterly and fainted, vomiting blood. At this moment, Hu Die's inner emotions were deeply stirred. She was overwhelmed with sadness, almost unaware whether she was a fairy in Zhuang Sheng's dream or a flower queen banished from Ming Kong. It is because Hu Die was too deeply stimulated, and also because the directors and screenwriters are all famous figures, that this was achieved. There is no doubt that Hu Die is the embodiment of Red Peony.</p>
<p>▲ All are outstanding on the silver screen Apart from Hu Die, who played the leading role, the entire cast displayed their unique talents, and they were not ordinary. Mr. Wang Xianzai's portrayal of Chen Er Ye's rascality and his remorse in his final days was so wonderfully depicted in his expressions, words, and actions that it was truly penetrating. The scene of Ms. Zhu Xiuying and her daughter crying and urgently searching for Xiang Jie was heartbreaking and brought many tears. Jiang Yucheng's constant disappointment, Ma Jiqing's chivalrous spirit, Xiang Jie's initial petite and charming appearance, and even the gambler Mu Gua and the big teapot character, all played their roles perfectly. They truly lived up to the protagonist's hard work and the dedication of the directors and screenwriters. It is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>▲ Hopes for the future and reflections after the viewing The description of the poor state of a wealthy man, or the act of going against the grain, cannot be effective. Even with the skill of the director and the sensitivity of innate talent, it is inevitable that it will be滔滔汩汩滔滔汩汩, like sorting out old books. Although I dare not know the truth of Ms. Hu Die's life, in Ms. Hu Die's own view, she cannot help but feel deeply for Red Peony. Therefore, there is this unprecedented grand viewing. The completion of a great undertaking, Heaven may not hesitate to inflict setbacks to accomplish it. From then on, the ears and eyes of the people of the whole country will know that China's film industry is not inferior to Europe and the West. This is a hope beyond reflection.</p>
<h3>The Yage Collection Returns with Honors</h3>
<p>— Furong Xuanzhu</p>
<p>There are many theaters in Shanghai, but the most prestigious is the Yage Collection. Last year, under the initiative of Zhu Lianfu, a hard-working member, a travel department was established, with Li Liming appointed as the director and Lin Zhizhai as the documentation director. All members enthusiastically joined. This trip to Changshu was reported to the president of the local hospital, who repeatedly requested that they perform two days of charity performances to raise basic funds. Zhu and Li, considering it a good cause, agreed to his request and brought their equipment, setting off last Friday. The group consisted of about sixty people. They stayed at the Yushan Hotel that night. They performed at the Yushan Grand Theater on Saturday and Sunday evenings. The seats were completely sold out days in advance. There was no space for those who came later. Locals who hadn't had their fill repeatedly begged the hospital president to extend their stay for another day. However, the famous performers were eager to return to Shanghai for work, so they could not agree. It is said that this grand performance was an unprecedented event in Yushan for many years.

<p>▲ Publishing News The seventh issue of Movie Monthly, edited by Zhou Shixun and published by Wenhua Bookstore, was published today. The content is more refined than before, and it includes four famous articles, "Chaplin's View on Love" and "Following Garbo for a Day," which are all very interesting. The magazine costs three jiao per issue and three yuan per year.</p>
<h3>Occasional Talk About Seasonal Items (4)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Before the willow catkins bloom, there are pale yellow buds among the branches and leaves, called willow catkins. If they are dried in the sun, they will bloom immediately. The wind blows them into絮絮catkins, unable to stay on the branches. I once had a line that said, "Willow catkins fly for three days, peach blossoms fall for a spring." Some mistakenly think that "three days" means "three months," but it is not so. Because their flowering period is extremely short, from blooming to falling, it is at most only three days. Bencao Shiyi says that willow catkins can be used as medicine, but once the flowers come out, they are useless. Xunlou Shenshu has a method for strengthening teeth with willow catkins. Rubbing the teeth with willow catkins removes any decay, prevents all diseases, brightens the eyes, preserves youth, blackens the hair, sharpens hearing, strengthens muscles, benefits longevity, and lightens the body. Jijiufang uses dried willow catkins ground into powder and uses it to brush teeth every day to remove wind, brighten the eyes, blacken the hair, and strengthen the teeth. Long-term use allows one to chew metal and stone. I tried soaking willow flowers in alcohol to examine the ingredients. It is actually no different from salicylic acid. However, most commercially available salicylic acid is artificially made from carbolic acid and caustic soda. It is not extracted from natural plants. Therefore, I prefer to make it myself, which is more reliable.</p>
<p>There are small black dots in willow flowers, which are their seeds. They contain a lot of moisture. Therefore, if they stick to fur clothing, they will evaporate when heated and turn into insects. This is the same principle as rotten grass turning into fireflies. If they fall on the water surface, they will turn into duckweed, still a plant. After the duckweed is dried in the shade, burning it can turn mosquitoes into water. But if it is directly exposed to acid, the duckweed will easily rot and lose its effectiveness. Its effectiveness also lies in the organic acid it contains. The acid contained in duckweed is still柳日, probably the same as that made from carbolic acid. Therefore, using carbolic acid to fumigate mosquitoes can also kill mosquitoes. Its effectiveness is not inferior to pyrethrum. The formula book says it is best to collect it on the fifth day of the fifth month and dry it in the shade, which is not related to superstition. Because after the Dragon Boat Festival, the sun is strong, and the organic acids it contains will mostly evaporate. The method of drying in the shade is to tie them into strings with long ropes and hang them in a windy, sunless place. They will dry in three or four days. They can be ground into powder. If they are hung in the wind for a long time, the effective components will inevitably evaporate. This is the same as the treatment of pyrethrum. However, pyrethrum is a plant alkali, not an acid. Their properties are opposite, which can neutralize each other. Therefore, the two should not be used together. Or use eel bones to fumigate mosquitoes, which takes advantage of the phosphoric acid it contains, which is the same as using crab shells to fumigate bedbugs. Sheep shin bone marrow is also rich in phosphoric acid, so it is also very effective in repelling bedbugs. It is common practice to拍床击枕拍床击枕 when opening windows for the first time, saying that it can drive away lice. This is a mistake of驚蟄amazing. Generally, hibernating insects hide in the shade and are afraid of the cold and do not come out. When thunder rumbles, the Yang energy is abundant, and the hibernating insects are startled and come out. Therefore, fumigating at this time to remove bedbugs can indeed exterminate their species.

<h3>Travel Notes of India (20)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>There are many female writers in India. According to Mrs. Carsing's book, Indian customs emphasize chastity and early marriage. Some young girls become widows before the age of ten. There are millions of young widows over the age of thirty in India. Therefore, some people strongly advocate abolishing the custom of widowhood. But in my opinion, after the European War, there are tens of millions of widows in various countries. India is not that many. Europeans love war, which is the root cause of producing widows. Now, many Western authors are also learning from the East's polygamy system. The principle is that although polygamy may be considered unreasonable, are millions of widows everywhere more humane? The truth lies in the demands of the times. Empty talk is useless. According to what I heard from Western women marrying Chinese men, they argue that Chinese men marrying Western women is beneficial to the human race. But I know that in fact, the result of the European male's love of fighting is that males eliminate each other. The remaining females are seeking an average way out to the East. This is a common law in mathematics.</p>
<p>Indians have many taboos. People of different religions cannot drink together. A friend told me, "I am a Hindu, and I can drink tea with Muslims. But if my family finds out, they will definitely object." There are Indians in the High Court who marry Western women, and their families do not associate with them. Many Indian men marry Western women, but very few Indian women marry Westerners.</p>
<p>Here, one can see that the attire of Muslims and Afghans is different from that of Indians. Indians have almost no clothes to speak of, while Muslims have clothes and are neatly dressed, which is because of the cold weather. I saw people from Nepal. Nepal is a very small country, but it is still independent today. Tao Jie Shi has traveled there. The mountains are steep and dangerous, and the guards are strict. The British were unable to conquer it. However, they lend money, send advisors, send people to train troops, and sign most-favored-nation treaties. Indians still admire the Nepalese, saying that it is better than being slaves. The Nepalese carry knives and wear布紮headwraps. I don't understand why they can carry knives in public. I saw Tibetans coming to ask for Buddha statues. A Chinese woman was translating for them. Tibetans are tall, rough, and black, like Indians, and they have an overbearing demeanor. They wear thick leather shoes and behave wildly. One can tell at a glance that they are mountain people. These fierce tribes are difficult to tame without Buddhism to civilize them.</p>
<p>Transportation to Tibet is convenient here. People travel back and forth by horse. If you want to go to Tibet, you can rent a horse, but the British do not allow passage. Even monks cannot easily pass. There is a Nanyang person calling himself Zhengfu Monk, who once traveled there. He wanted to enter Tibet, but the British never allowed it. I don't know what happened in the end. I heard that Zhengfu Monk went to the Buddhist school in Singapore, which was run by Fang Zhang, and became the head teacher. But I don't know if that school was ever established. Zhengfu Monk is a young man with new ideas. He wrote a book called "New Village" and spent a lot of effort to enter Tibet.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<p>Finance: Speculative Gold Fluctuates</p>
<p>Re-emerging outside the 720 Tael Mark: Yesterday, the gold market on the 10th was stable, with a slightly upward trend, surpassing the 720 tael mark. However, there was some underlying volatility. The difference throughout the day totaled 16 taels. Various firms and large speculators had differing inflows and outflows, but the underlying intention remained firm. Although foreign exchange rates had risen by two levels, the domestic market seemed better, suggesting a "loose on the surface, but firm underneath" situation. Rising overseas silver prices did not cause any reaction, as there were no special changes in the European market. Therefore, the opening gold price slightly declined but immediately rose, moving in the opposite direction. The buying side was agile, with frequent increases of more than ten taels, only fluctuating by three or four taels. It had risen to 727 taels. At noon, news of a work stoppage at a Citibank silver mine caused a sharp decline, breaking through the 720 tael mark. In the afternoon, Shin Hing and Yuan Cheng dumped their holdings, causing a further drop of ten taels. However, persistent buyers and rumors that the new Japanese cabinet was still part of the Minseito party meant that there was no prospect of gold deregulation. As a result, the final price remained between the 720 tael mark.</p>
<p>Large Contracts Open Slightly Lower: The May contract opened slightly lower by 1.5 taels at 715 taels. Spot silver rose by 5/16, forward silver by 1/4, silver prices rose by 5/8, and private telegrams only added 1/2, so sentiment remained stable. Subsequently, prices continued to decline by one tael. Suddenly, Qian Changxiang, Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Maoyong, and Yuan Xingyong all stepped in to buy, immediately raising the price by more than five taels, reaching 719 taels and 8 qian.

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Without Great Gains or Losses</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm and the trend is stable. The sale of spot yarn in the market is still considered good, so people's hearts are stable. However, most retail investors are unanimously selling short, while major players' desire to go long has not diminished. If there are no special changes, it is feared that there will be a period of consolidation around seventy taels.</p>
<p>People's Index Trend Consolidation: The Exchange's People's Index opened higher in the morning session due to the rebound in American cotton, leading to stronger sentiment.

As a result, each month's price rose by one, two, three, or four qian. The afternoon session opened weakly and when the market closed, due to news that the matter of the customs reporting firm had been resolved, the market suddenly surged, with each month's price rising by one, two, or five qian. The total trading volume for the day was 11,400 bales. It was found that Yi Yu sold 1,250 bales, Shen Ji 350 bales, Yuan Feng 600 bales, and Tong Yu 300 bales.

<p>The cotton market has slightly stabilized. With the rebound of American cotton, people's sentiment is slightly better.

Therefore, there is still no shortage of sellers. Spot cotton sales are average. It was found that the major bulls have not yet let go. What the future holds depends on the exchange rate and American cotton.</p>

<p>Grains: Rice Market Weakening</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, more than thirty merchants arrived, but sales were still sluggish. However, there were rumors in the market that a certain merchant was about to start buying, but this could not be confirmed. Because the goods arriving from the river were all of ordinary quality and could not be stored for long, buyers generally did not welcome them. As a result, white japonica rice softened again by nearly one jiao. People's hearts were still bearish. Sales of thin early rice continued to be sluggish, with the price dipping by about a foot. Yangdu indica and port indica rice were rare and sold well, and prices were generally stable. White yuan rice sales were active, and the source was being received, with prices stabilizing.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived from the countryside. Sales in this street were extremely slow. Various merchants' machine-milled white japonica rice sales were weak due to low demand from retailers. Prices fell by a small fraction of a jiao. Batches of thin early rice continued to arrive. Buying interest was sluggish, and prices continued to weaken by more than a jiao. There was a shortage of high-quality Yangdu pointed rice, and the market was stable. Sales of altered silver yuan were still acceptable. The overall market was stable.</p>
<h3>Customer Indica Rice Sold in Hankou</h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer indica rice market slightly weakened due to the cessation of purchases by Guangdong merchants. However, merchants from Hankou and this street successively took advantage of the small purchases, and the market revived after being weak. However, prices were still difficult to rise. The Hankou merchants and this street purchased 800 bags of late machine-milled rice from Jiangxi at a price of 11.35 to 11.22 yuan. The Xiamen merchants purchased 308 bags of machine-milled yuan rice from Jiangxi at a price of 11.5 yuan, all of which were goods from the central area. The high-end goods stored at the bottom were already rare, and prices were not willing to fall too much.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Sharp Fall in Afternoon</h3>
<p>Inland Bulls Return En Masse due to Spring Rain</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the prices of various months were temporarily in a wait-and-see state due to the favorable quotes for foreign wheat. Therefore, there was little movement. However, when the afternoon session opened, there were rumors that the political situation in Japan was about to change, and the price of gold would fluctuate drastically. In addition, there had been no rain for more than a month, and dark clouds were spreading in the afternoon, indicating a strong possibility of rain. As a result, the bulls from the inland returned en masse. Sales of this month's flour also became sluggish. Although the factories did not lower their prices, people's hearts were still unfavorable, so prices fell sharply across the board. Observing the subsequent steps, it is possible that the low price of 9.5 qian in the distant months will have to be seen again. As a result, this month's price fell sharply by 3.5 fen compared to the previous day, May fell by 3.75 fen, June fell by 2 fen, July fell by 2.25 fen, August fell by 1.5 fen, and September fell by 2.75 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Bulls Return</h3>
<p>The wheat futures market presented a sluggish trend yesterday. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly lower, there was a period of stabilization. However, in the subsequent sessions, the major players did not continue to advance. The inland bulls, seeing that the environment was still unfavorable, and that the foreign wheat fixed by the factory and merchants was sufficient for use during the grain harvesting season, and that the market would be difficult to recover if flour sales were sluggish, returned in large numbers. Observing this later, or because of the sharp fall in the flour market, it should also drive the market. As a result, April and May fell by 2 fen compared to the previous day, June and July fell by 3 fen, and August and September fell by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Soybean Futures Firm Up in Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard Dalian soybean futures started stable and ended firm. After the morning session opened, trading in the market turned sparse because the buyers were not clear and the Dalian merchants' intention to sell was also quiet. As a result, trading in the market turned sparse, and near- and far-term prices were stable. However, after the afternoon session opened, according to the Dalian telegram, prices rose, and people's hearts improved as a result. And the association's spot sales also became active. However, many of the near-term bulls were withdrawing, so the market remained stable. The distant months turned firm across the board. As a result, the April futures were 4 taels 6 qian 2 fen, the market was flat, May was 4 taels 6 qian 1 fen, up 2 fen, and June was 4 taels 6 qian 3 fen, up 1 fen.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: This Factory's Rock Candy Sales Quite Smooth</p>
<p>Coarse Sand White Cloth Falls by One Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams: Cuban spot sugar prices fell by 0.0625, New York sugar futures for all months fell by 1 point, only the next year's March was unchanged, and Java spot and futures sugar also had no rises or falls. The association's market was divided. Due to the increase in foreign exchange, the market sentiment for Dutch sugar 24 coarse sand white was weaker. There were no recipients, but there were many sellers, who were willing to compromise. The market then fell sharply, with the transaction price reaching 10 taels 03 qian 5 fen, a drop of 1 qian compared to the previous day, and the market was also sluggish. Medium sand white was called 9 taels 9 qian, with no inquiries. Japanese sugar trading was sparse, and the market was quite firm. There was a shortage of top-grade goods, and there was a slight increase. J mark 10 taels 07 qian 5 fen, YP mark 10 taels 06 qian 5 fen, YT mark 10 taels 02 qian 5 fen, N mark 10 taels 03 qian 2 fen, YRO mark 9 taels 8 qian, SH mark 9 taels 9 qian 5 fen, the trend is still firm. This factory's rock candy sales are still smooth. The Guohua factory opened several hundred bags yesterday, the price of No. 1 goods was 13 taels 3 qian, No. 2 was 13 taels 2 qian, and large bags of No. 3 rock candy were 12 taels 5 qian. The market situation is still quite brisk.</p>
<p>Dried Goods: Spring Bubble Rounds Unwilling to Sell Cheaply</p>
<p>Quanzhou bubble rounds rose again and again last winter, and it was expected that there would be an even better market this spring. But since entering the spring, sales have been sluggish, and the market situation has been the opposite. In addition, the sales of each merchant are unusually accommodating, and prices have gradually loosened, falling by two or three taels compared to the high prices. However, land prices have not loosened accordingly. Yesterday, Quanzhou wheelers came, but there were no more arrivals. According to the cargo owner's letter, land prices are firm, and stocks are unwilling to sell cheaply. Therefore, the top-grade goods of each merchant have been rejected and not redeemed for a long time. If sales improve, there may be hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Chinese Silk European Sales Return to Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market became sluggish again. Because the European and American markets, the raw silk factory advance is still slow, the telegram does not turn, Chinese silk merchants also sell at a loss due to the small price and heavy capital. Yesterday, only Shintai entered 20 packages of Shanghai white factory, and Zhonghe entered 10 packages of white dry, the price is still stable.</p>
<h3>Lu Arm Hands Seventy Pieces Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shandong big two arm hands, in recent years, British and French needs have not declined, and Shanghai has insufficient storage, so a telegram was sent to the production area to urge delivery. Yesterday, the Yantai Qing Ban Ding Sheng Wheel also loaded 70 pieces of silk factory arm hands from Yantai, which have been unloaded by Yifengchang and other piers.</p>
<h3>Red and Green Tea European Sales Weak</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign firm tea market has become increasingly sluggish in recent years. European and American merchants and firms are taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the fluctuating exchange rate. In addition, the telegrams from the tea sales areas in Morocco and other regions of Africa have all reported that the bottom storage is full and sales are sluggish. People's hearts are becoming increasingly weak. In recent days, no one has asked about Wuyuan Zhenmei. Although Tongfu Jinlong and other firms have a small number of advances, the market has fallen by another two or three taels compared to the previous market. The market situation is extremely pessimistic.</p>

<h3>Chinese Ratepayers Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Delegate Assembly</p>
<p>Chinese Members of the Municipal Council Elected to Continue Serving</p>
<p>Xu Jiqing and Twenty-Seven Others Elected as Executive Committee Members</p>
<p>Seven Important Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Settlement Chinese Ratepayers Association held its first meeting of the 20th Annual Delegate Assembly at 2:00 PM yesterday to elect the 20th Annual Chinese Members of the Municipal Council and the Executive Committee of the Association, and to discuss important resolutions. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: There were eighty-one delegates to the Association. At 2:30 PM, the number of delegates present was sufficient to meet the legal quorum, and the meeting was declared open. Wang Xiaolai was publicly elected as the Chairman of the Assembly, and Tao Leqin recorded the minutes and served as the master of ceremonies. After the formalities were performed, the Chairman read the opening remarks, followed by Yuan Lvdeng, the representative of the Chinese Members of the Municipal Council and the Chinese Committee, who reported on the events handled during the year. The Association also distributed a booklet of important Association affairs documents for the year, including: (1) a proposal to increase the number of Chinese Members of the Municipal Council; (2) a proposal to increase the surcharges of the British Shanghai Waterworks Company (with a report by the Association's representatives reviewing the company's accounts); (3) concerning I</p>

<p>the case of banning dog racing gambling within the Settlement; (4) concerning the case of kidnapping within the Settlement; (5) the case of the Municipal Council infringing on the police power of the extraterritorial roads in West Shanghai; (6) the case of the Shanghai Sino-Foreign Telephone Company's bidding sale. Next, the Chairman appointed Chen Liangyu, Hu Fengxiang, Yu Hualong, Liu Hongyuan, Li Bohan, Zhang Yichen, Zhu Wenqi, Pei Yunqing, and eight others as vote counters and announcers. Voting was then immediately commenced to elect the Chinese Members of the Municipal Council and the Executive Committee of the Association. After the election, the following resolutions were discussed: (A) The Association should immediately urge the Public Settlement Municipal Council to expand elementary education so that all school-age children within the Settlement can enjoy the right to education. It was resolved that the Municipal Council should be urged to actively expand Chinese elementary education. (B) The Association should order the Public Settlement Municipal Council not to use the estimated rent as the standard for collecting general taxes, except for self-produced and self-used houses. It was resolved to hand it over to the Executive Committee for handling. (C) The Association should urge the Public Settlement Municipal Council to actively improve defense, eliminate kidnapping and gambling, and strictly prohibit public officials from soliciting gratuities. It was resolved to pass it through. I</p>

After the discussion, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: The opening speech of the first meeting of the 20th Annual Delegate Assembly of the Republic of China stated: Representatives of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and delegates of the Association, today's first meeting of the 20th Annual Delegate Assembly of the Association, recalling the past and looking to the future, makes us feel that this year's delegates have an even greater responsibility than the delegates of previous sessions. Because the government's suggestions are tireless, and the movement to recover national rights is even more relentless, the goal of tariff autonomy has been achieved, and the abolition of foreign consular jurisdiction is expected to be completed before the opening of the National Assembly on May 5, and the issue of recovering the concessions has also been settled. Then, the people of this era should be the government's backing, in order to carry out various positive struggles. The task of this Association, under this current situation, on the one hand, to carry out the Prime Minister's legacy, to seek China's freedom and equality, and on the other hand, without prejudice to our country's sovereignty, to cooperate sincerely with foreign taxpayers, to exercise the rights that taxpayers should enjoy, and to fulfill the obligations that taxpayers should fulfill, in order to make the municipal administration within the Settlement a reasonable, fair, and scientific development. The representatives of the Delegate Assembly of previous sessions have struggled in the past, established a foundation for progress, and we will work hard in the future to carry it forward and accomplish the ultimate goal in everyone's mind. The important events of the previous session are in the booklet that the delegates placed in front of them, which can be used as a basis for reference. The first item on the first page is the issue of increasing the number of seats for our country to attend the Public Settlement Assembly. The number of seats should be proportional to the population, which is the fairest principle under the current situation. The population within the Settlement, our country accounts for more than 95%, and the number of seats should also be more than 95%. Even if we take a step back, it should be proportional to the amount of taxes paid. According to the Municipal Council's memorandum in 1927, the amount of taxes paid by the Chinese people accounts for more than 55% of the Municipal Council's total revenue. Then the number of seats that should be out of the twenty must be eleven to be called reasonable, but now there are only five seats, which is a far cry from this ratio. This Association should work hard to achieve the first item mentioned in the letter to the Municipal Council on March 26, 1928, and strive to achieve it immediately. The most important thing in municipal administration is order, because when order is stable, all facilities can be carried out in order. But in fact, can the order within the Settlement be said to be stable? To our I</p>
<h3>Mr. Xu Xinliu of the Chinese Directors</h3>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Observing with an impartial eye, it is still not possible to fully affirm. The installation of such things in broad daylight in bustling areas seems to have become commonplace. However, because the senior police officers are all foreigners, with linguistic and psychological differences, even though expenses increase annually, the increase in cases is directly proportional. According to the budget proposed by the Municipal Council this year, police expenses have increased by more than 1.3 million taels of silver compared to last year. However, whether the number of cases will decrease is doubtful. Before senior police officers employ qualified Chinese personnel to the greatest extent possible, it is unlikely that there will be significant progress in efficiency. The passive installations of the municipal government, such as the establishment of procedures, are as described above, while the active facilities involve the popularization of education. I ask, among the school-age children within and outside the concession, are there any who have not enjoyed the right to education? Are there as many school-age children in our country who have not enjoyed the right to education? To this day, the Municipal Council has not yet implemented the content of the aforementioned resolutions of the association regarding educational matters. It has been delayed for more than three years. Only three primary schools have been added, and two of the school buildings will not be available until the autumn of next year. One can imagine their neglect of Chinese education. Recently, although there is a phased addition of sixteen primary schools under an eight-year plan and a planned establishment of two girls' middle schools, when it comes to expenses, the planned budget is large and impractical. When raising funds, they indicate additional levies. It is not known whether the taxes paid by Chinese taxpayers are used to cover the exchange losses of foreign employees, which can amount to millions, while when it comes to our fundamental education, every penny is scrutinized. This is what we should pay particular attention to. Recently, the Municipal Council has almost exhausted the surplus income from the sale of the electricity department without the approval of Chinese taxpayers. Therefore, regarding land prices, the new valuation is more than one and a half times higher than the old valuation, in order to increase land taxes. This also violates the principles of municipal finance and long-standing practices. Regarding the gross tax on actual rent, it will be collected based on estimated rent, and the tax rate is as high as 26% or more. Even if we do not want to say that they will exhaust their ability to exploit, we cannot. Moreover, in this year's budget report, there is even a proposal to increase the tax by two li next year. How can taxpayers tolerate this? In addition, the Municipal Council has absolutely no sincerity in employing Chinese personnel as senior officials, as far as we know. Originally, when the position of Director-General became vacant, Chinese personnel should have been employed to demonstrate the spirit of cooperation. However, after our Chinese directors raised the issue, they used diversionary tactics, procrastinating and making excuses, claiming that there was insufficient experience or that precedents were difficult to break. Some people say that a certain person is manipulating things in order to monopolize and control the municipal government. We treat people with fairness and justice, believing that this is definitely not the case. However, the phenomenon of only hearing the sound and not seeing the person touches our hearts, and there may be some truth to it. However, the association should still use fair and upright methods to supervise the implementation of the third item in the aforementioned letter from the association. However, there is one thing that the Municipal Council has done recently that is worthy of praise for readily correcting mistakes, namely the resolute closure of the dog racing casinos. When the dog racing casinos started, the association actively opposed them, believing them to be factories for manufacturing criminals and criminal cases. However, the chairman at the time had a different view from the association for some reason. Originally, the actions of the Municipal Council should be bound by the will of the taxpayers, but they did not do this, and ended up in a mess before finally executing the will of the taxpayers. Fortunately, the current chairman and directors have a deep understanding of righteousness, and the proposal to close the casinos was resolute, which prevented the reputation of the Municipal Council from being completely ruined. This is truly fortunate. The above is just a brief account of the important points. Now, please ask the directors and committee members attending the Municipal Council to report on the matters handled in the past year.</p>
<p>Report by Chinese Committee Members: The full text of the report by the Chinese directors and committee members of the Municipal Council is as follows. We were elected by the previous General Assembly on April 16 of last year as directors of the board and members of various committees of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Now that a year has passed and our term is complete, we are pleased to attend the first meeting of the 20th Annual General Assembly. We hereby report on the major municipal affairs we have participated in and carried out over the past year, as follows: (A) Increase in the Number of Chinese Directors and Allocation of Committees. The increase in the number of Chinese directors from three to five was originally a tacit agreement between Chinese and foreign individuals within the concession. During the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers last year, there was an unexpected twist, and public opinion was in an uproar. It was not until the special meeting of foreign taxpayers on May 2 that the issue was resolved, and we Chinese were able to implement the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors. This is something worth commemorating. Director Bei Songsheng resigned after serving for half a year due to his trip to Europe to investigate banking affairs. Meng Jia was re-elected by the General Assembly to succeed him. Meng Jia also filled Bei's position on the Public Utilities Committee. There are twelve committee members in this session. The distribution and number of Chinese and foreign committee members are as follows: (1) Finance Committee: Seven members, two of whom are Chinese, namely Director Xu Xinliu and Committee Member Qin Runqing. (2) Security Committee: Five members, two of whom are Chinese, namely Director Yu Qiaqing and Committee Member Chen Tingrui. (3) Public Works Committee: Six members, two of whom are Chinese, namely Director Yuan Ludeng and Committee Member Lin Kanghou. (4) Staff Committee: Six members, two of whom are Chinese, namely Director Liu Hongsheng and Committee Member Li Fuxun. (5) Public Utilities Committee: Six members, two of whom are Chinese, namely Director Hu Mengjia and Committee Member Wu Yunzhai. (6) Health Committee: Six members, two of whom are Chinese, namely Director Liu Hongsheng and Committee Member Qian Longzhang. (7) Traffic Committee: Six members, one of whom is Chinese, namely Committee Member Chen Tingrui. (8) Sino-Foreign Education Committee: Eight members, three of whom are Chinese, namely Director Yuan Ludeng, and additionally, Mr. Liu Zhan'en, President of Shanghai University, and Mr. Ou Yuanhuai, Vice President of Great China University. (9) Chinese Primary School Committee: Four members, two of whom are Chinese, namely Director Yuan Ludeng and Committee Member Lin Kanghou. (10) Music Committee: Two members, all of whom are foreign. (11) Library Committee: Three members, all of whom are foreign. (12) Public Sports Field Committee: Five members, all of whom are foreign. In addition, the Municipal Council has established the following committees as necessary for administration: (13) Salary Committee: Six members, one of whom is Chinese, namely Director Xu Xinliu. (14) Waterworks Case Committee: Eight members, three of whom are Chinese. In addition to the original Public Utilities Committee members Hu Mengjia and Wu Yunzhai, the Municipal Council has also invited Mr. Guo Chengen, Director of the Shanghai Arsenal, to collaborate with an American expert and four other foreign members. (15) Hospital Committee: Thirteen members, two of whom are Chinese, namely Dr. Niu Huisheng and Dr. Yan Fuqing, who were hired by the Municipal Council. (16) Film Inspection Committee: Eight members, two of whom are Chinese, namely Ms. Xia Niuhuizhen and Mr. He Dekui, who were hired by the Municipal Council. (17) House Rent Arbitration Committee: Five members, one of whom is Chinese, namely Mr. Huang Yanfang, who was recommended by the Shanghai Real Estate Association and hired by the Municipal Council. (18) Physician Registration Committee: Eight members, one of whom is Chinese, namely Dr. Niu Huisheng, who was invited by the Municipal Council. (B) The Process of Regulating the Shanghai Rice Market. Last summer, the Shanghai rice market experienced a shortage of supply and a sharp increase in prices, with each dan (unit of weight) rising to more than twenty yuan. The public suddenly felt panicked about food, and an emergency price stabilization effort needed to be organized. Qiaqing advocated for raising funds to purchase rice and sell it at a lower price as a means of regulation. With the suggestion of the colleagues to the Municipal Council, 100,000 yuan was allocated, and the National Government's Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Government were each asked to allocate 80,000 yuan. Representatives from the three organizations and merchant groups formed the Shanghai Rice Market Regulation Committee, which was responsible for handling the price stabilization efforts. During the months of panic in the rice market, market prices were curbed and food supplies were abundant, which was a clear demonstration of the effective cooperation between Chinese and foreign officials and businessmen. The foreign directors of the Municipal Council also</p>

<p>happily supported it, which is also commendable. (C) The Current Situation of the Water Price Increase Case. Last September, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, due to the sharp depreciation of exchange rates and the insufficient payment of British gold dividends, increased water fees by 25% with the approval of the Municipal Council. At that time, colleagues immediately expressed their opposition, but because they were in the minority on the board of directors, they were unable to achieve their wishes. Afterwards, opposition from Chinese and foreign groups became increasingly fierce, and the situation became more tense. Considering that such a dispute was not beneficial to the area, colleagues suggested to the Municipal Council that a special board meeting be convened as soon as possible to revoke the original price increase plan. As a result of the meeting, it was decided that the price increase would be temporarily permitted for collection, and the Municipal Council would organize a waterworks case committee, hiring one foreign and one Chinese expert to inspect the entire management situation of the waterworks company to see if there was any possibility of reducing the current water fees, and then make a final decision. This inspection report is expected to be completed by the end of September this year, or at the latest by the end of this year. (D) Population Survey of the Concession. The population survey of the concession is conducted every five years. According to the survey in October 1930, there were a total of 1,007,868 Chinese and foreign residents, an increase of 167,642 people compared to five years ago. Among them, Chinese residents accounted for 971,397, an increase of 161,118 people compared to five years ago. There were a total of 36,471 foreigners, an increase of 6,524 people compared to five years ago. Due to the sharp increase in population, the improvement of municipal administration in the concession is even more important. (E) Publication of Chinese Gazette. The Municipal Council's gazette has always been published in English, which is very inconvenient for Chinese people in the concession. Therefore, there was a proposal to translate and compile a Chinese gazette. In October of last year, it was put into practice. The Municipal Council hired additional Chinese staff to specialize in translation and compilation, and entrusted the secretariat of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to distribute it on behalf of the taxpayers according to the taxpayer roster. Since its publication, it has been convenient for Chinese people. The annual report of last year will also be selected and translated into Chinese, and the date of publication should not be far off. Chinese people in the concession can learn about municipal facilities through the newspapers, so as to avoid misunderstandings. (F) Appointment of Senior Chinese Staff and Increase in the Treatment of Chinese Staff. The Municipal Council's senior staff has always been foreign. Colleagues have repeatedly proposed hiring Chinese people to fill positions and urged its realization. Last year, the report of the Municipal Council's Salary Committee proposed to establish a Chinese secretary in the Director-General's office to assist in the bureau's affairs. The board of directors has already agreed, and has appointed Chairman Macnaghten, Director-General Fessenden, Director Okamoto, and Qiaqing, Xinliu, etc., a total of five people, to form a special committee to discuss titles, powers, and candidates. After repeated meetings, a resolution should be submitted to the board of directors for approval and implementation soon. As for the middle-level important staff in various administrative departments, they all need specialized knowledge. There are two proposals for the method of employing Chinese people: (1) The existing Chinese staff in various administrative departments who have served for many years and have the ability to handle affairs should be promoted as appropriate. The health department, finance department, and public works department have all implemented this. (2) Various administrative departments should recruit Chinese students, and after passing the examination, they will be trained for a certain period of time, and then assigned to middle-level positions. The police department has already recruited, and the health department's fire brigade has also announced recruitment. As for the increase in the treatment of existing Chinese staff in the Municipal Council, there are two things worth mentioning: (1) In the future, new Chinese staff with a monthly salary of more than 50 yuan will be required to make compulsory savings. The method is to deduct 5% of the monthly salary, and the Municipal Council will add twice the amount, making a total of 15% as the employee's savings, which is the same as the current treatment for foreign staff. It will be implemented from July 1 this year. As for existing Chinese staff who are willing to save, they can also follow this method. (2) Chinese staff and foreign staff in the same positions receive the same salary. However, foreign staff receive an additional subsidy, which is one-half of the salary. (G) Expansion of Chinese Education. The Municipal Council originally had two committees, the Chinese Education Committee and the Western Education Committee. Since last year, it has been reorganized into the Sino-Foreign Education Council, with seven members, as mentioned above. The Chinese committee members believe that the Chinese education facilities in the concession have many shortcomings. Although three Chinese primary schools have been added in recent years, it is still not enough. Therefore, they have prepared a plan for expanding Chinese education in the concession, which has been approved by the Sino-Foreign Education Council, and the principles have been approved by the board of directors. The content of the plan is that the Municipal Council will raise a large amount of money to add two primary schools each year for eight years from the Republic of China year 20 to the Republic of China year 27, each school accommodating 600 boys and girls. In addition, two girls' middle schools will be established, which must be established before August of the Republic of China year 23. The existing four Chinese public schools must be gradually transformed into pure middle schools, and operated according to the Chinese school system. Except for foreign language teachers, the principal and faculty must be gradually replaced by qualified Chinese personnel. It is also proposed that the Municipal Council allocate annual funds to subsidize private Chinese schools in the concession that are particularly good. In short, the number of school-age children in the concession is more than 150,000, and the Chinese educational institutions urgently need to be expanded. (H) Closure of Dog Racing Casinos. The closure of dog racing casinos has been the unanimous demand of us taxpayers for two years. The Municipal Council has now resolved that the Mingyuan and Shenyuan dog racing casinos in the concession will be closed on March 31. Even if the dog racing general association advocates that only members be allowed to participate, it will not be allowed because it is prone to abuses. This is to implement the Municipal Council's policy of strictly prohibiting gambling businesses, and is worthy of your comfort. The above eight matters are the noteworthy aspects of the Municipal Council's administration during the colleagues' term of office. We hereby briefly report the ins and outs, as right. In addition, there are many routine matters, which will not be listed in detail. The colleagues have been entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the taxpayers, and they have been working hard on matters related to local welfare and the rights of the people, and they are still ashamed of not meeting the high expectations of society and the keen encouragement of the gentlemen. We hope that you will understand. Reporters: Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Mengjia, Lin Kanghou, Qin Runqing, Chen Tingrui, Li Fuxun, Qian Longzhang, Wu Yunzhai.</p>

<h3>Resolution of the Sanxin Factory Case</h3>
<p>Employees Agreed on the Distribution of Subsidies</p>
<p>New and Old Factory Owners Completed the Handover and Will Open the Factory</p>
<p>After the Sanxin Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road was announced for sale, the new buyer, Rong Zongjing, failed to take over several times. The China Merchants Bureau had asked the Chairman of the Municipal Government to stop the transfer due to capital issues. Now that the distribution of subsidies for staff and workers has been resolved, the formal handover took place the other day. The details of each item are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Takeover Announcement: Rong Zongjing, General Manager of Shenxin Textile Company, the new buyer of Sanxin Yarn Factory, issued an announcement and posted it on the factory gate, saying, "Shanghai Shenxin Textile Company is taking over Sanxin Yarn Factory today. As soon as the goods are handed over clearly, work will begin immediately. This announcement."</p>
<p>Formal Handover: The factory was first taken over on the 7th. The old factory directors Chen Shuyun and Zhuang Fengying, two Westerners from the China Business Company, and the new buyer Rong Zongjing were present. The formal handover took place on the 8th. Middleman Zhu Guangcheng, two Westerners from the Business Company, and Chen Shuyun, the old factory owner's representative, were present. Rong Zongjing also appointed Wu Kunsheng as factory director, Hu Shihwai as chief technician, and Wang Shizhang as deputy technician, who went to take over. They are currently starting to organize, and it will take about a week to complete and open the factory. Workers will still be employed.</p>
<p>Distribution Resolved: The subsidies for staff and workers of the Sanxin Yarn Factory had been resolved through independent negotiations between labor and capital. The capital side provided 85,000 yuan, and the distribution method was 60,000 yuan for staff and 25,000 yuan for workers. Later, the workers in each department opposed the uneven distribution and protested. Zhu Guangcheng is now responsible for communicating with the capital side and adding 14,703 yuan in subsidies for the workers, which has been resolved. All the workers expressed satisfaction. From yesterday onwards, workers' subsidies have been issued separately according to the work booklets. Small foremen and female foremen, machine operators, etc., whose daily wages are more than 8 jiao, receive 60 yuan in subsidies; those whose daily wages are less than 8 jiao receive 50 yuan; those whose daily wages are less than 7 jiao receive 30 yuan; ordinary male workers receive 8 yuan in subsidies per person; and ordinary female workers receive 6 yuan in subsidies per person.</p>
<p>Correction by the Authorities: The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday approved the Third Special District Cotton Textile Industry Association, saying, "Received and approved for filing. However, today's newspaper reported that there was an advertisement of thanks from all the workers in the factory, stating that 'Section Chief Xu of this bureau distributed a certain amount of money, but the opinions of the capital side could not be reached, and there were no results,' which is inconsistent with the facts. The labor dispute at this factory, regarding the amount of severance pay, was completely agreed upon by both parties independently, and how to distribute it was also determined by the labor side independently. You must immediately order compliance with the correction to avoid misunderstandings. Also, the person dispatched by this bureau to handle this case was Xu Zhi, a staff member of the Third Section, not the section chief. Please note this."</p>
<h3>Law Enforcement Arrests Western Police Officer for Unprovoked Shooting</h3>
<p>Innocent Chinese Citizen Injured</p>
<p>Ningbo Native Association Provides Assistance</p>
<p>Mr. Xin Haishan, a native of Ningbo working for Changhe Seafood Store on Yangxing Street, was heading out on business around 9 p.m. on the 7th of this month. As he passed the intersection of Yong'an Street and Pu'an Lane in the French Concession, a Western police officer, No. 158, suddenly opened fire. The bullet pierced Xin's neck, causing him to fall to the ground bleeding. Realizing his blunder, the officer and a colleague attempted to move Xin's body to a nearby alley to cover up the crime. However, their actions were witnessed by Mr. Li Dexuan from Tianjin, who happened to be passing by. Li reported the incident to the Chinese police officer in charge of the lane, who then telegraphed the French Concession police station. Xin was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. Reports indicate that Xin's condition is critical and his life hangs in the balance. Upon hearing the news, Changhe Store reported the incident to its trade association, requesting that the Ningbo Native Association intervene. The association was outraged and immediately drafted letters to the Municipal Government, the French Concession's Board of Directors, and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, urging them to engage in strict negotiations. The letter stated: "To esteemed sirs, we received a letter from Mr. Shao Baoxing, Chairman of the Shanghai Seafood and Grocery Trade Association, which states that our member Changhe Store reported that their employee Xin Haishan (details as mentioned above). Police are stationed in the concessions to protect the region and safeguard merchants. However, this Western police officer, with an imperialistic attitude, trampled upon Chinese citizens and harmed the innocent. Such reckless disregard for human life is utterly lawless. We have always admired your association's tireless efforts in safeguarding the interests of our fellow countrymen. Therefore, we are reporting the situation and seeking your support in seeking justice and compensation, as well as ensuring that such incidents do not occur again in the future, so as to reassure merchants." It is a fact that imperialists, relying on unequal treaties as their shield, have over the years revealed their hideous nature, massacring our compatriots. Tragic incidents have occurred repeatedly, and reports have never ceased. The grievances of Xin Dingxiang have barely faded, and now Xin Haishan has been victimized again. Our association bears the heavy responsibility entrusted by our fellow countrymen, and we cannot remain silent regarding the inhumane actions of this Western police officer. Based on the aforementioned letter, we respectfully request that your Mayor examine the matter and promptly engage in serious negotiations with the French Consul in Shanghai to achieve justice and compensation, and to ensure that such incidents do not occur again in the future, in order to protect the lives of our people. (Remainder of the letter omitted).</p>

<h3>Telegram Urges to Prevent Foreign Merchants from Establishing Factories in China</h3>
<p>Important Telegram from the National Products Factory Federation</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation telegraphed the Ministries of Industry and Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "Since China achieved tariff autonomy, foreign merchants, fearing that imported goods would not sell well in China due to increased import taxes, have sought new avenues and devised plans for further economic aggression. They are shifting from exporting goods to exporting capital, establishing factories in China one after another, taking advantage of low Chinese labor costs and reducing tax rates, engaging in cutthroat competition with national product factories. Such insidious methods are chilling. If no measures are taken to stop this, the harm will be unimaginable. At a meeting held by the Federation on the 4th of this month, it was unanimously agreed that the backwardness of China's industry and commerce is undeniable. The current period of tariff autonomy and low silver prices is a good opportunity to promote national products. If restrictions are not imposed and foreign merchants are allowed to establish factories in China to circumvent our country's protective tariff policies, it will be even more dangerous than before tariff autonomy. On the one hand, imports from abroad can be monitored by customs, and the people are generally aware of foreign goods. Those who know to love their country will reject them, so the harm is relatively shallow. On the other hand, foreign factories enter our homes, change their appearance, sell at low prices, and seize the market for national products in every possible way. Therefore, we have decided to telegraph your ministries, requesting that you uphold the late Premier's legacy of industrializing the country and consider the infancy of our country's industries. Please take swift measures to prevent foreign merchants from establishing factories in China, so as to maintain a glimmer of hope for national products. We respectfully report this situation and urge your honorable ministers to examine and implement it."</p>

<h3>Extortion of Construction Company Owner</h3>
<p>Demands of 1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Ni Zhenxiang Receives Multiple Threatening Letters</p>
<p>Ten Letters in Three Months</p>
<p>Defendant Chen Yi Was Once a Military Officer</p>
<p>Denies Extortion, Detained for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Ni Zhenxiang (also known as Yan Songtao), owner of the Xin Jin Ji Construction Company and a native of Nanhui, has recently received threatening letters demanding a large sum of money. He reported this to the police, who arrested a man named Chen Yi from Hangzhou and handed him over to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This morning, the interrogation continued. Police lawyer Zhang Dayin presented three handwritten confessions by the defendant, stating that the handwriting differed in each and the instigator, Wang Kai, refused to say where he was hiding. Therefore, he requested an extension to continue the investigation. The plaintiff stated that his surname was never Ni, and although Songtao was his nickname, it was only used by his parents in his hometown and he had abandoned it after coming to Shanghai. Now, the letter addressed him as Songtao, so he asked to interrogate the defendant to find out how he knew this. Furthermore, why did he change Ni to Yan? From January to the 28th of last month, he had received ten threatening letters, the first one demanding as much as one million yuan, which was alarming. The letter also said that more was better and threatened bloodshed if he did not comply. The meeting place was at the Shenzhou Hotel, and he was to carry a calendar as a marker. He immediately reported this to the police. All subsequent contact with the extortionists was conducted by detectives; he knew nothing about it. Chen Yi stated that when Sun Chuanfang was Governor of Zhejiang, he served as an adjutant in the 3rd Battalion of the 89th Regiment of Sun's army. The regimental commander was Wang Kai. When Sun failed in 1927, he joined the National Revolutionary Army as an adjutant in the 41st Detachment of the 17th Army. When the detachment went to Nanjing, he resigned and returned to Hangzhou. He only brought his family to Shanghai on the 5th of last month and stayed in the attic of a relative's house at No. 20, Mailgaobao Road, French Concession. He knew nothing about the threatening letters. Before his arrest, he met Wang Kai one day, who said he had been newly appointed to handle fish and mineral tax affairs for the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and promised to find work for him. When they parted, they agreed to meet again at the Shenpinglou Teahouse on Simalu on the 29th of last month. When he met Wang, he also saw three men with the surname Sun. After a brief conversation, they went downstairs and walked near Baker Road. Wang told him that the man standing by the roadside across the street was Mr. Yan, and asked him to convey his regards. He had no idea why, so he asked Yan, who turned out to be a detective and arrested him. As for who wrote the threatening letters and how they knew the plaintiff's name, he had no idea. The police lawyer then presented a fingerprint report, stating that the defendant had been arrested in 1925 for kidnapping, extortion, and murder, and had been punished twice by the French Concession authorities. He was not a good person. Judge Ge ruled that the case required further investigation and ordered the defendant to be returned to the police station for detention pending investigation and hearing.</p>
<h3>Doctor Cai Yousheng Accused of Negligence</h3>
<p>Three Doses of Medicine Cause Major Fetal Movement</p>
<p>Fetus Miscarried, Pregnant Woman Dies</p>
<p>Zhang Tinggui, a native of Changzhou residing at No. 31, Huiyuan Lane, at the intersection of Huade Road and Dalianwan Road, engaged lawyer Liu Hui鎜 to file a complaint in the Special District Court against Dr. Cai Yousheng, located at No. 1, Jishen Lane, at the intersection of Xihuade Road and Huaji Road, accusing him of negligence and causing injury, etc. The reason was: professional negligence, resulting in one death and one injury. He requested that the case be investigated. Zhang's wife, Sun, became pregnant in August of last year. More than two months later, due to discomfort in her pregnancy, she went to the defendant for diagnosis and treatment on October 23rd, accompanied by the complainant. She explained that her period had not come for more than two months since August, and she suspected she was pregnant. However, the defendant, acting in the manner of doctors at that time, made a brief diagnosis and hastily wrote a prescription, prescribing medicine to promote Qi and break up blood stasis, which caused fetal movement. The defendant's three medical records all mentioned "chest tightness and vomiting," and anyone with a little common sense would know that these were signs of pregnancy. However, the defendant repeatedly diagnosed the patient and blindly copied the previous prescriptions, failing to pay attention to what he should have. The complainant's wife took three doses of the medicine, which was contraindicated for pregnancy, and became bedridden, bleeding vaginally, and experiencing significant fetal movement. The complainant, a worker, pawned his belongings to pay for the consultation fees and medicine. After his wife suffered this serious injury, the complainant had to stop working to take care of her, and had no source of income. He could only watch his wife's illness worsen and had no money to seek another doctor or buy medicine to prevent miscarriage, eventually leading to a miscarriage in March of this year. The dead fetus was only seven months old, but its limbs were fully formed and could be examined. If not for the defendant's negligence, it would not have been a stillbirth. Article 7 of the Civil Code states that a fetus is considered to have been born if it is not stillborn and is entitled to protection as an individual. Therefore, the defendant is responsible for causing the death of the miscarried fetus through professional negligence. The complainant's wife is on the verge of death as a result, and the defendant should be held responsible for causing injury through professional negligence. A quack doctor who kills people cannot be tolerated by law or morality. The complainant is deeply saddened and heartbroken by the negligence. Therefore, in accordance with Article 338 of the Criminal Procedure Law, he filed a private prosecution, requesting that the defendant be summoned to court and punished separately in accordance with Article 291, Paragraph 2 and Article 301, Paragraph 3, first part of the Criminal Code. The court accepted the complaint and summoned Cai Yousheng for a hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court by Judge Feng Shide yesterday afternoon. Cai Yousheng failed to appear in court and instructed his lawyer to appear on his behalf, stating that Cai had gone to Suzhou a few days ago on business, and the summons was only received at 11 a.m. yesterday, so he could not return in time. He requested a postponement. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that a warrant be issued for his arrest according to Article 40 of the Criminal Procedure Law, as the defendant had failed to appear without a valid reason. The plaintiff, Zhang Tinggui, also recounted the previous situation, stating that he used to work as a tea boy at the World Book Company. His wife, Sun, became seriously ill after a miscarriage on March 18th and died on March 29th. When she was seriously ill, he begged the defendant to come to his home for treatment, but the defendant stubbornly refused, claiming that his family had been doctors for seven generations and he was well-versed in medical knowledge and knew how to diagnose pregnancy. Now, because of the defendant's incorrect medication, both his wife and unborn child have died, and he demands a thorough investigation. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Feng adjourned the case for seven days and stated that a warrant would be issued for the defendant's arrest if he failed to appear again.</p>
<h3>Court Summons Zhang Han</h3>
<p>Why Has the Confiscated Boat Not Been Returned?</p>
<p>Disrespect of the Law Should Be Dealt With</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate has accepted a case in which Zhang Zhaoxiang, captain of the 4th Detachment of the Jiangsu Water Police, is accused of beating a boatman, Lu A’gen, to death, and illegally detaining and extorting the merchant Guo Shixin’s boat. After confirming the facts of the case, Prosecutor Yang Qi issued an official letter to the District Chief of the Detachment, Zhang Han, ordering the return of Guo Shixin’s boat. However, the district refused to comply. Prosecutor Yang was furious and, to uphold the dignity of the judicial system, dispatched police officer Xue Bingzhang with a summons to bring Zhang Han to court for questioning. However, the officer returned and reported that Zhang Han was out suppressing bandits. The supervisor, Hou Fei, opened and acted on the summons on Zhang's behalf. Upon receiving this report, Prosecutor Yang immediately issued a warrant for the supervisor, Hou Fei, to be brought in for questioning. The police went again, and Inspector Yu came out, saying that the supervisor had also gone to suppress bandits and accepted the summons on his behalf. He also ordered the immediate return of Guo Shixin's boat to the owner. The police officer truthfully reported these events.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Bans the Bailianjing Port Ferry in Pudong</h3>
<p>Orders Construction of New-Style Ferry Boats</p>
<p>Operating Permit Will Be Revoked if Deadline Is Missed</p>
<p>There is a privately-operated ferry at Bailianjing Port in Pudong, this city. A drifter named Jiang, et al., daily uses a manual paddle boat to transport workers from the Louchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory and the American company Dalei Trading Company. At noon on the 17th of last month, during quitting time, workers crowded and jostled to board the boat. The boat was small and the crowd was large, leading to a capsize that drowned one passenger. Upon receiving the report, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities sent personnel to investigate. They discovered that the ferry operator’s boats were not suitable for ferrying and that the accident was caused by workers crowding onto the boat. To ensure the safety of travelers, the Bureau issued a strict order for the ferry operator to construct three new boats within three months according to the Bureau's standard ferry boat design. If the deadline is missed, the ferry operator's operating permit will be revoked. Before the new boats are constructed, the existing boats are limited to ten passengers per trip. The Bureau also sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, instructing the water patrol team to pay attention to inspections.</p>

<h3>Car Hits Bicycle</h3>
<p>Car Damaged, Person Slightly Injured</p>
<p>At the intersection of Mintiniyin Road and Kaizier Road in the French Concession yesterday at 7:30 a.m., a No. 12259 business car driven by a Westerner sped north, colliding with bicycle No. 11,146, registration No. 11146, belonging to the Great Northern Telegraph Company passing through. Unable to avoid the collision, the bicycle was struck by the car, damaging the wheels and frame. The cyclist was thrown more than ten feet, covered in mud and slightly injured. The patrolling police saw the incident and took the damaged vehicles and the offending car to the Songshan Road Police Station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Massive Theft Case at Fousheng Trading Company Solved</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Thieves Apprehended</p>
<p>Stolen Goods Recovered and Stored at the Police Station</p>
<p>The Fousheng, a North China shipping vessel belonging to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., departed from Shanghai for Yantai and Tianjin the other day. A massive theft occurred on board, with 67 pieces of artificial silk from the insurance cabin stolen without a trace. The company reported the theft to the police and offered a reward for information. This matter has been reported in detail in this newspaper. The items were stolen from the Huashun Wharf. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. received a notice from the Huishan Police Station that the stolen items from the Fousheng wheel on the 7th had been recovered. On the night of the 9th, the police arrested a thief in the case, who revealed the location of the stolen goods and the whereabouts of the remaining accomplices. Yesterday, the police continued to arrest eleven more thieves and recovered the stolen goods, including summer cloth. However, the thieves had already repackaged the stolen goods to conceal their origins and deceive people. After solving the case, the police notified Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. to send people to the police station to examine the stolen goods, confirming that they were the original stolen items. However, a number of items were still missing. The police have begun investigating and are continuing to search for the mastermind of the crime and the missing summer cloth. It is reported that the thieves stole the large quantity of goods from the Fousheng cabin on the night of the 7th and unloaded them into a barge before escaping. Therefore, there must have been many people involved in the theft. The police are still investigating the details. More details will be reported later.</p>
<h3>Sunken Boat Off Yizhou Pond in Wusong</h3>
<p>Navigation Must Be Cautious</p>
<p>Caused by a Large Sandboat</p>
<p>Off the coast of Yizhou Pond in Wusong, a large sand boat named Zhu Futai sank many years ago due to a storm. The former Tanggong Bureau of Baoshan County considered that the sunken boat could withstand the tide and protect the pond bank, so it has not been destroyed to this day. However, passing ships are in great danger. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., a cargo barge, Jin Jialong, loaded with soybean cakes and white coal from Shanghai, intending to unload at Dachang Town in Baoshan, ran aground on the sunken boat when turning into Yizhou Pond, preparing to enter the Yunzaobang. The bottom of the boat was pierced and seawater rushed in, threatening to sink the ship. The shipowner and crew of five cried for help. The Wusong Rescue Bureau patrol boat, which was patrolling the area, rushed to the scene and rescued the crew members. The ship was dragged to a shallow beach, but the cargo loss was quite substantial. After the accident, the Wusong Rescue Bureau, concerned that such accidents might occur again in the future due to the location being a major shipping lane, has erected a marker at the site of the sunken boat to warn ships.</p>
<h3>Man and Woman Traffickers Sentenced to One Year Each</h3>
<p>Yan A’gen, Chen Zijin, Wang Yanshi</p>
<p>The Anti-Poverty Society investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang previously uncovered a trafficking case on the Taiyuan steamer, arresting the traffickers Yan A’gen and Chen Zijin, the female accomplice Wang Yanshi, and rescuing the trafficked boy Jinxi. They were handed over to the local court for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, the criminal court tried the case. Yan A’gen and Chen Zijin were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Wang Yanshi was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for the crime of abduction. The court also found that she was addicted to opium, so she was sentenced to an additional month of imprisonment and fined 30 yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3>Widow Asks to Dissolve Relationship with Father-in-Law</h3>
<p>I, the widow Zhang Cai, am 33 years old and live at No. 5, Xinqiao Road, west of Xieqiao outside the West Gate. It has been nine years since my husband passed away. At that time, he left behind a daughter. Unexpectedly, that girl died prematurely two years ago. I recently hired lawyer Gong Tongyuan to file a petition with the Mediation Office of the Local Court, requesting to dissolve my relationship with my father-in-law, Zhang Atang. The petition stated that in 1918, I married Zhang JinKui, the son of the defendant Zhang Atang. In 1921, I gave birth to a daughter named Meimei. In the following year, JinKui died. At that time, Meimei was only one year old. Unfortunately, two years ago, when Meimei was eight years old, she also died of illness. Because I had no means of support, I asked the defendant to divide the property that my late husband was entitled to, but the defendant ignored me. I have temporarily returned to my mother's home. But the future is long, and I am alone and helpless. The only thing I can do is dissolve my relationship with him so that I can be free. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Bingxin convened a court hearing. The defendant Zhang Atang did not appear, and lawyer Lu Ruizheng appeared on his behalf. First, Zhang Cai述 recounted the previous situation, stating that she wanted her freedom. Then, the defendant's lawyer stated the defendant's age and background, saying that the defendant Zhang Atang was 61 years old, a native of Shanghai, who lived at No. 5 behind the Siming Guild Hall and made a living farming. The plaintiff was already pregnant (Zhang Cai was heavily pregnant and about to give birth), which may be inappropriate, so she asked the court to mediate and dissolve the relationship. However, the defendant also agreed to dissolve the relationship. Therefore, a mediation agreement was reached. The judge drew up the mediation record and ordered the plaintiff and the defendant's lawyer to sign it separately before adjourning the court.</p>
<h3>Special Telegrams from the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>European Lines Experience Pricing Conflicts: The Sino-European route, one of Shanghai's long-distance shipping lines, has a "Water Freight Association." All shipping companies sailing to countries such as England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, etc., join the association as members. Freight rate increases and decreases are drafted by the association. Member companies are bound by these rules and are not allowed to independently lower prices. This maintains a balance and prevents mutual disruption. The affairs of the association are led by the British company. When there are changes in freight rates, the British company convenes all members for discussion. However, recently, there have been more new and faster ships on the European route. The business of slower ships has inevitably declined. The freight rate for general cargo from Shanghai to Europe is about 76 shillings per ton, equivalent to about 80 yuan in national currency. The Dutch shipping company, a member of the association, in order to develop its Shanghai export business, is unwilling to be bound by the association any longer. It is advocating for a reduction in freight rates and has announced its withdrawal from the association. From now on, it can freely advocate for increases or decreases in freight rates without being interfered with by others. After this news was released, it attracted the attention of various member companies. They have discussed it many times and decided not to be affected by the Dutch company's price cuts. If the Dutch company reduces its freight rates, other shipping companies have also planned to follow suit. A pricing conflict in European shipping is brewing and could erupt at any moment.</p>
<p>Implementation of Armed Escorts: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in compliance with orders from headquarters, has instructed its eight Yangtze River vessels to request the deployment of special military police on each ship when passing Nanjing, from the ship owners to the Capital Garrison Headquarters. Five fully armed military police officers will be deployed on large ships and four on small ships to protect the ships. In recent days, ships such as the Jiang'an, Jiangshun, Jianguo, Jiangyu, Jiangxin, Jianghua, etc., have all followed suit in requesting military escorts. Within these ten days, military protection can be fully deployed. Also, the establishment of a baggage claim area at the dock has also been approved. From now on, passengers traveling on China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships will no longer be harassed by gamblers and hoodlums, no matter which ports they call at along the way.</p>
<p>Yibin Steamer Attacked: The "Da Mei Wan Bao" (Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury) reported that the Jiejiang Company's office in this city received a telegram from Yichang yesterday stating that the company's Yibin steamer was fired upon by the garrison five miles upstream of Yichang on Wednesday. It arrived safely in Yichang that afternoon. The shooting was entirely due to a misunderstanding, but the result was quite serious. The helmsman, Bai Latelai, was seriously injured in three places. The local authorities had ordered all ships to stop five miles upstream of Yichang to be inspected for communists. Apparently, the Yibin steamer was unaware of this order and did not stop for inspection, resulting in the shooting by the garrison. Upon hearing the news, the company immediately suspended all of its upper Yangtze steamers. After the matter was clarified, the steamers resumed their regular voyages. At present, bandits have been eliminated from the upper Yangtze area. He Long has retreated from Badong and fled into the mountains. Therefore, the section from Yichang to Chongqing is now entirely under the jurisdiction of Liu Xiang.</p>
<h3>Assassination Case on East Xuhang Street</h3>
<p>The Assassins Fled East and West</p>
<p>The Deceased's Name is Unknown</p>
<p>At around 9 o'clock last night, five men went to the fourth alley of Ruifu Lane on East Xuhang Street in the French Concession. After entering the alley, at the entrance of No. 52, one of them suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired four shots at a certain person. The victim immediately fell to the ground and died. The other four men, seeing that their objective had been achieved, fled in both directions of the alley. By the time the police arrived after hearing the gunshots, the assailants had already escaped without a trace. They only found the deceased lying in a pool of blood. He was about thirty years old, with a short, connected beard. He was wearing a blue silk gabardine robe, a beige silk gabardine vest with a curved front, a blue silk gabardine lined jacket and pants, black velvet shoes, and white silk socks. The deceased had two gunshot wounds, one to the nose and one to the cheek. The police transported the body to the coroner's office, and an examination will be conducted this morning.</p>
<h3>Robbery at a Westerner's Home on Rue Massenet</h3>
<p>Two Robbers Arrested</p>
<p>At around 5:30 this morning, three robbers suddenly arrived at the home of a certain Westerner at No. 6 Rue Massenet in the French Concession. They entered through the back door and broke into the bedroom of the head servant, Xiong Jinbang, stealing 140 silver dollars, a platinum watch, and a coat before fleeing with their loot. Xiong shouted loudly for help, and after hearing this, Chinese detectives No. 328, No. 223 and No. 653 went to the scene and arrested two of the robbers, recovering 100 silver dollars. Later, a pistol was also found on the grass.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of the Robbery of Customs Silver</h3>
<p>Bao Binghua is Not Guilty</p>
<p>Last November 8, a Ningbo woman, Wang Zhou, was robbed of more than 60 customs silver dollars by bandits at the entrance of Pu'ai Lane on Route des Soeurs. The woman reported this to the police, stating that Bao Binghua, a neighbor from the same hometown, had conspired with others to commit the robbery. The police arrested Bao and brought him to the Special District Local Court for questioning. Bao hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Feng held a trial yesterday morning and declared Bao Binghua not guilty. However, the police lawyer requested that the defendant be remanded in custody pending the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Zhou Gengsheng Dies After Being Shot by Robbers</h3>
<p>Zhou Gengsheng, a resident of Mojiaqiao Village near Xinchang Town in Nanhui County, was robbed by armed men at his home at 3 p.m. on the 6th of this month. As they fled, the robbers fired a warning shot, which struck Zhou in the waist. Afterwards, his mother accompanied him to Shanghai to seek treatment at Baolong Hospital. However, his injuries were severe, and he died at dusk the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police, who dispatched detectives to transport the body to the coroner's office on Avenue Foch. Yesterday morning, Inspector Ji Guo of the Special District Local Court arrived at the office to conduct an examination. Zhou's mother had sent her son to the hospital, believing that his condition was not hopeless, so she returned home. When Gengsheng passed away, none of his relatives were present, and no one came forward to claim the body. Guo ordered the Pushen Shanzhuang to provide a coffin and wait for relatives to claim it.</p>
<h3>Laborer Dies After Jumping from a Moving Vehicle</h3>
<p>A truck, license plate number 16844, was traveling from east to west on Connaught Road at 8:30 last night when it approached the Gordon Road intersection. The truck was moving slowly when a laborer named Li Chengshan jumped from the vehicle, lost his footing, and injured his head. The guard on duty urgently used the fire brigade ambulance to take him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he died from his injuries before arriving at the hospital. The deceased, Li Chengshan, was 26 years old, from Jiangbei, and lived in Caojiadu.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Male Corpse Found Dead</h3>
<p>Yesterday, an unidentified man was found dead in front of the Tongyishanhui Hall at the intersection of Mingguo Road and Luxiangyuan Road. He was about thirty years old, wearing a black cloth cotton-padded jacket and pants, and barefoot. He appeared to be a laborer. Jiang Pingyang, the head of the Ninth Ward, reported the matter to the local court. Inspector Yang and others conducted an examination and instructed the hall to provide a coffin.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Post Office to Move Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The local Postal Administration, recognizing that the Nanjing Road branch office is too small and inadequate for its operations, and because the lease contract is about to expire, has decided to move to new premises at Nos. 304, 306, and 308 at the corner of Fujian Road and Tianjin Road on the 12th of this month. The new location is spacious, and the public will likely not be crowded when mailing items.</p>
<h3>Pudong Bank</h3>
<p>Branch to be Established at Laiyidu</p>
<p>Grand Opening Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Pudong Commercial Savings Bank was organized by gentlemen and merchants in Pudong and financial magnates in Shanghai. Since its opening in 1928, its business has grown year by year. Now, due to the prosperity of commerce at Laiyidu in Pudong and the lack of financial institutions, transactions and payments have been inconvenient for various industries. Recognizing this, the bank has established a branch at Laiyidu. Henceforth, financial convenience in the area will be the same as in Puxi, and the savings in time, safety of travel, and security are indeed beneficial. The branch is located at No. 403 Laiyidu Road, across from the post office. Preparations have been completed, and the grand opening is scheduled for the 12th of this month. The bank has invited guests from all walks of life to attend the ceremony. During the opening period, the bank will provide a beautiful commemorative booklet that everyone needs and an exquisite leather wallet as gifts for customers.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Bookstore</h3>
<p>Invites Representatives to the National Buddhist Conference</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association recently convened the National Buddhist Conference in Shanghai. Representatives included Norlha Rinpoche from Xikang (whose position among lamas is slightly inferior to the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama), Kang Jiyao from Shaanxi Province, Zhong Kanghou from Hangzhou, and over a hundred representatives from famous mountains and temples across the country, such as Taixu and Yuanying. The conference has concluded. The Buddhist Bookstore believes that its Buddhist books, which are widely sold throughout the country, are due to the promotion of Buddhist fellows in various provinces. Therefore, the board chairman of the bookstore, Wang Xiaoting, and others will host a banquet for the representatives at the World Buddhist Laymen's Forest at noon today to strengthen connections.</p>
<h3>Request to Negotiate the Paper Mark Case</h3>
<p>Letter from the National Federation of Commerce to the International Chamber of Commerce Branch</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Chinese branch of the International Chamber of Commerce: "Esteemed Sirs, Recently, we received a letter from Wang Shaohao and others stating that, according to a report in the Shen Bao, the International Chamber of Commerce is holding a conference in Europe. Among the proposals of the Chinese representatives and experts are one regarding European debts and one regarding German reparations. Can Chinese holders of German paper marks be included in the reparations, following the precedents of countries such as Belgium and England? International economic organizations and the International Chamber of Commerce have already handled similar cases. However, our country is weak and our people are poor, and we lag behind in everything. Fortunately, we are now building the Republic of China and striving for diplomatic success. We believe that you gentlemen are enthusiastic about public welfare and saving the country and its people, which is in your minds. We earnestly request that you follow the precedents of countries such as Belgium and England and propose negotiations with Germany regarding the reparations for paper marks." We agree with the letter, and the above is respectfully conveyed. China has suffered a great loss from German marks. The proposals for this International Chamber of Commerce conference include issues related to European debts and German reparations. It seems that our Chinese representatives can propose the settlement of German marks issued in China. The above letter is approved, and we respectfully request that you investigate and relay it to the attending representatives for discussion at the sixth International Chamber of Commerce meeting.</p>
<h3>Fellow Ningbo Townsmen in Shanghai Telegraph Chiang Kai-shek Requesting Construction Bonds</h3>
<p>To Handle Water Conservancy Projects in Yin County and Fenghua</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, the Fenghua Fellow Townsmen Association, and the Yin County-Fenghua Water Conservancy Association, in order to handle water conservancy matters in Yin County and Fenghua, jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of Fenghua Xikou, In order to handle water conservancy in Yin County and Fenghua, we previously requested the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allocate 2 million in construction bonds. This request was approved, and Songfu and Zhihao met with Chairman Zhang and the heads of the Finance and Construction Departments, who agreed to find a way to do so. The East Qian Lake in Yin County is related to seven townships in the three counties of Yin, Fenghua, and Zhenhai. Over 300,000 mu of farmland are irrigated. If it is not treated, it will become silted. Floods have repeatedly occurred in Fenghua over the years, and fertile fields have turned into gravel. If repairs are not expedited, in a few decades, there will be no arable land near the mountains. We believe that disaster prevention is better than disaster relief, and water management and afforestation are both urgent matters. We have now formed the Yin County-Fenghua Water Conservancy Association, and on one hand, we will raise funds locally, and on the other hand, we will request government subsidies. We implore you to consider the long-term plan for our homeland and promptly telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allocate the previously requested 2 million in construction bonds in full, so that construction can begin as soon as possible. We are deeply grateful and await your reply. Yu Qiaqing and others of the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, Wu Zhihao and others of the Fenghua Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, Zhuang Songfu and Zhang Shenzhi and others of the Yin County-Fenghua Water Conservancy Association, bow and wish you well."</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants Request Ban on Import of Foreign Rice, Wheat, and Flour</h3>
<p>Pouring Out the Sufferings of Farmers</p>
<p>Fan Hesheng, chairman of the Shanghai Rice and Grain Merchants Association, submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "It is requested that foreign rice, foreign wheat, and foreign flour, which continue to be imported in a determined manner, be banned to relieve grain merchants and farmers, who are suffering economic invasion and finding it difficult to survive, and this will affect social unrest throughout the country. It is requested that measures be taken to prohibit imports or temporarily increase import taxes to provide relief. During the spring and summer of last year, due to the famine of the previous year, grain prices were high, and it was unavoidable to purchase grain from overseas. However, the amount of foreign rice imported into various ports in China reached a massive 200 million yuan in national currency. At that time, it was effective in supplying food to the people and suppressing rice prices. However, because the volume of imports greatly increased, the exchange rate of the Chinese currency sharply depreciated, increasing the prices of other imported goods by 20-30%. The advantages and disadvantages were about even. Last autumn, there was a bumper harvest everywhere, and rice prices fell sharply. There was more than enough rice for domestic supply. Domestic production of wheat was also considered a moderate harvest. Flour mills sold their products domestically with little surplus. However, North and South America, initially in order to support cotton farmers, abandoned wheat farmers and began to dump flour and wheat in China. Subsequently, due to successive bank failures, financial crises arose, and they focused all their efforts on selling surplus flour and wheat to China. Later, Australia, affected by Western Europe, also exported as much flour and wheat as possible to the Chinese market, leading to a never-before-seen price of gold at 800 taels. The prices of other essential imported goods were almost double what they had been before. Huge amounts of cash flowed overseas, and the weak economy of China suffered even more than the countries in the East and West. The impact on the cities is as described above, and the current market price of rice has fallen to half of what it was last summer. Flour and wheat have also fallen to the lowest prices in recent years. Foreign wheat and flour continue to be imported. We have heard that foreign rice is also being imported. At present, the weather is suitable for wheat seedlings to grow vigorously, and a bumper harvest is expected. Surplus grain is abundant everywhere. Even at the current market prices, rice merchants and domestic rice dealers are already in dire straits. If the dike is not plugged to stop the continuous leak of imports, we don't know what will happen in the future. Regarding the rural economy, although the harvest last year was 40% larger than the previous year, the actual income was less than the previous year. Expenses were higher than the previous year. In 1929, each mu of land produced 1.5 dan of rough rice, and the initial selling price of rough rice was 12 yuan per dan, which later rose to 17 yuan. The average price was 14.7 yuan. Calculating with 1.5 dan, each mu earned 21.75 yuan. In 1930, each mu produced 2.2 dan of rough rice, and the initial selling price was 8.2 yuan per dan, but now it is selling at 7.8 yuan. The average price is 8 yuan. Calculating with 2.2 dan, each mu only earns 17.6 yuan. Although the harvest was 0.7 dan more per mu, the actual income was 4.11 yuan less. In terms of expenses, everything has risen once with the high price of rice. Even small items like matches, which used to sell for 10 cash per box, have now risen to 30 cash. Each small household used to burn 30-40 cash of kerosene per night, but now they need to burn 70-80 cash. Rural labor, which used to cost 40-50 cents per day, now costs 60-70 cents. Other items and industrial products have also risen in price after the increase in wages due to the high price of rice. Large pancakes and fried dough sticks, which used to sell for 20 cash each, now sell for 30 cash. The food in restaurants and noodle shops, as well as daily necessities, have all risen in price with the high price of rice, and they have not fallen in price with the falling price of rice, wheat, and flour. Therefore, the surplus income of farmers has decreased. The situation is even worse for poor farmers who borrow money to rent land. I heard that last year in Liyang, a farmer planted three mu of land, yielding a total of 86 jin of fine rice, or 21 dan. When rice prices were lowest, rice was worth 2.85 yuan per dan. During the lean season, he bought three shi of rice on credit from a rice shop at 20 yuan per shi, totaling 60 yuan. Using the price of 21 dan of rice to pay for the three shi of rice, he was still short 0.15 yuan. One example can illustrate the hardships of rural farmers. Farmers toil hard all year round, and what they earn is only the value of rice, wheat, cocoons, beans, tea, and other products. The price of rice has fallen to the lowest level in recent years, as described above. The price of wheat is two months away from harvest, and the price has already fallen as much as possible. When the new harvest comes out, we don't know what the bottom price will be. The silk market has plummeted, and the price of cocoons can be imagined. The export trade of beans and tea has not improved either. The market prices of agricultural products are so weak that it is impossible to struggle in this ever-increasing standard of living. Robberies occur frequently in the countryside, and people cannot sleep peacefully at night. Bandits and communists are lurking everywhere, and danger is ever-present. In recent months, those who have been able to maintain their livelihoods have been doing so by converting jewelry into cash, because the current price of gold is unusually high, making it profitable to convert jewelry into cash. Moreover, after converting jewelry into cash, there is no fear of theft, and it can be used to maintain livelihoods. The rural resources are being depleted day by day, and the lives of rural farmers are becoming increasingly difficult. Those with a little remaining strength are moving to cities. This dangerous trend of people flocking to cities should be taken seriously. As for advocating for domestic goods and boycotting foreign goods, what China lacks can be recovered by imitating them. Moreover, China claims to be an agricultural country, and if rice and wheat can be self-sufficient, but foreign rice, foreign wheat, and foreign flour are allowed to be imported, it is tantamount to a suicidal policy. Now, if we want to solve the national economic problem, the first step is to solve the rural economic problem. This is an immutable principle. Therefore, we have made a special report, hoping that your bureau will review it and forward it to the municipal government, and then forward it to the central government, to take measures to prohibit the import of foreign rice, wheat, and flour, or temporarily increase import taxes to provide relief, so that the rural economy will not go bankrupt, so as to maintain the national economy and prevent the loss of wealth. We are deeply concerned, and we respectfully submit this to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau."</p>
<h3>Stevedores' Strike Continues Today</h3>
<p>Five Workers Arrested Yesterday Released</p>
<p>Cotton Mills Request Extension to Sell Existing Yarn</p>
<p>The stevedores of this city are on strike because the Cotton Fabric Trade Association cancelled the cotton fabric cartage fees and Customs inspection fees. Efforts to get these reinstated have failed after many days. Yarn and fabric dealers, as well as various brokers, are becoming panicked. The Social Affairs Bureau brokered a settlement yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Settlement Talks: The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting yesterday at 2 p.m. to seek a settlement. Attending were Chen Songyuan, Shi Zhong'an, Deng Zhonghe, and four others representing the Cotton Fabric Trade Association; and Su Houxin, Ren Xixiang, Li Houfu, He Yumin, and eight others representing the stevedores. Guo Yongxi chaired the meeting, with Wang Zhiqin recording the proceedings. The chairman opened the meeting. Representatives of both sides presented their arguments. As of 6 p.m., no settlement had been reached. The chairman announced that the meeting would continue at 10 a.m. tomorrow (today).</p>
<p>Workers Released: Five members of the stevedores' union inspection team from the previous night shift – Wang Ahe, Cheng Pinshun, and three others – detained 15 bales of Tiansheng cotton yarn from Xiexing Public House for smuggling at the Taikoo Dock. A conflict ensued, and the French police, in order to maintain public order, detained both the smugglers and the five inspectors at the 16th Concession Police Station. Yesterday morning, the Western Police Captain questioned them. Because the matter concerned a labor dispute and did not involve disturbing the peace, all were released at 9 a.m.</p>
<p>Mills Request: The Chinese Cotton Mill Association telegraphed yesterday that the stevedores' strike has lasted five days. As a result, it was unable to sell all the cotton yarn that existed before Feb. 1 within the extended deadline of April 15 set by the Consolidated Tax Bureau. Therefore, yesterday, the Association wrote to the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance requesting that the Bureau make up for the days they lost in shipping due to the strike.</p>
<p>Yarn Trade Responds: The stevedores' union responded to the Cotton Yarn Trade yesterday: "Dear Executive Members of the Cotton Yarn Market, Further to your last letter stating that our union's dispute with the Cotton Fabric Trade Association should not involve your business, and your criticism that we lack fairness, we accept your criticism. In your letter, you earnestly told us of the benefits and detriments, urging our workers to end the strike and not to insist on hindering commercial transportation, etc. We cannot help but explain in detail again. Our union and your Association have a long history. The Cotton Fabric Trade Association also has the same origin. This time, the Cotton Fabric Trade Association used the government's cancellation of the consolidated tax license as an excuse to shirk responsibility for the cartage fees that our workers earned with sweat and blood. Beforehand, they did not respond at all, and instead published articles in the newspapers accusing our union of coercion and calling our earnings unofficial fees. This kind of rhetoric is clearly intended to undermine our union's efforts to make a living. Our workers were forced to resort to this strike, and we did not intend to involve your business. However, the workers' work relations led to this situation. We only sacrificed a part of your business's rights. In short, the blame lies elsewhere. Please uphold justice and be fair."</p>
<h3>Xu Zhi, Director of the Northern District Taxation Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Removed From Office Due to Case</h3>
<p>Vacancy Filled by Liang Sicheng</p>
<p>During the period when the Municipal Finance Bureau was collecting housing rent, Wang Haiqing, a tax collector from the Bureau's Northern District Taxation Office, absconded with a huge sum of more than 17,000 yuan of public funds. The Bureau placed a reward ad in the newspaper, and repeatedly ordered Xu Zhi, the director of the office, to expedite the investigation. Three months have passed, and the runaway official has flown away without a trace. In addition to telegraphing the government of Chaoxian County in Anhui Province, the runaway official's hometown, to seal his family property, the Bureau also recovered the guarantor's bond to cover the public funds. It is said that the funds are still insufficient. The new Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Cai Zengji, believes that Xu Zhi, the director of the office, was completely unaware of the situation beforehand and neglected his duties. In order to rectify official conduct, he issued an order the day before yesterday to remove the director from office and hold him responsible for pursuing the recovery of the funds in order to protect public funds and as a warning to those who neglect their duties. It is said that the vacancy has been filled by Liang Sicheng, the former director of the Suzhou Creek Ship Donation Office.</p>

<h3>Association for the Protection of Children Investigates the Tragic Case of a Student Named Xiao in Nantong</h3>
<p>According to reports from sympathetic individuals in Nantong, the China Association for the Protection of Children learned that a truck driver from the Yongda Pig Company in that area negligently ran over and killed a student named Xiao. The driver fled the scene, and the company allegedly bribed the family with 200 yuan in an attempt to escape legal consequences. Upon hearing this, the association believed that this matter involved obstructing justice and murdering a child. However, as the truth was unclear, they did not immediately lodge a complaint. Therefore, a few days ago, they specially sent Wang Guanyi, a staff member from the protection department, to Tongzhou to conduct an on-the-ground investigation of this case. He was also tasked with contacting local party and government agencies and community organizations to urge them to pay attention to child protection. According to Wang's report after returning to Shanghai, the involved party had requested the county Public Security Bureau to appeal to the court for withdrawal of the case. However, the court rejected this request, firmly insisting on arresting and prosecuting the person responsible according to the law. Furthermore, when Wang met with Zhu Ronggui, the chief prosecutor of the court, Mr. Zhu immediately presented the case file of the Public Security Bureau's rejection and the arrest warrant. Therefore, this case will definitely be resolved satisfactorily according to the law. It is said that after Mr. Wang returned to the association and reported, the association immediately formally filed a complaint to achieve justice. In addition to investigating this case, he also had substantial discussions with the county party headquarters, county government, Public Security Bureau, county Chamber of Commerce, and Yiqun Society regarding child protection, which yielded satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>Fire at Taoyuan Residence in Pudong Last Night</h3>
<p>At 7:30 last night, a fire suddenly broke out at the home of Shi Xuelang, a Chongming native, residing in a bungalow at No. 170 Taoyuan Residence in Pudong. The patrolling police frantically blew their whistles, and the Pudong Fire Brigade and the Swire Company's fire engines rushed to the scene to draw water and extinguish the fire. The police stations of the three districts and the Fourth Police Squadron, along with the defense team, also dispatched police officers to maintain order. The fire was extinguished at 10:15 PM, destroying more than ten bungalows belonging to six families, including the landlords Tang Ximei and Tang Adong, and tenants Yu Guangshi, Yu Guisheng, and Gui Chenglin, resulting in an estimated loss of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. After the fire was extinguished, District Chief Zhang of the Third District ordered the police to bring Shi Xuelang, where the fire started, to the district office for investigation. According to Shi, the fire was caused by embers not completely extinguished in the kitchen, leading to the disaster. The district chief, upon discovering that Shi did not have fire insurance, temporarily released him on bail.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>After reading the news "Old Groom Yearning for the Bride" in your newspaper yesterday, I was shocked. Because the facts stated are untrue and related to my reputation, I must correct them according to the facts to clarify the matter and avoid misunderstandings. After my wife passed away in April of last year according to the old calendar, I was left with ten children. The eldest was already married, the middle ones were studying, and the youngest was still in infancy. In addition, my factory affairs were complicated, and I often had to travel, making it impossible to take care of family matters. I was repeatedly advised by relatives and friends to remarry a middle-aged woman to help manage the household. I originally did not want to remarry, but after repeated persuasion from relatives and friends, my old friend Mr. Wu introduced me to Ms. Wang Zhaowen from Wuxi. Because she was nearly forty years old and had not yet found a suitable spouse, she intended to choose someone older. Therefore, through the matchmaker's introduction, Xu Jun was invited to act as the intermediary. I was originally unwilling, but after learning that Ms. Wang came from an academic background, I immediately agreed. The arrangement was made in early November last year. Both parties met and agreed, and a betrothal was arranged, with the wedding date set for the eighth of this month. Unexpectedly, Ms. Wang was affected by the collapse of the Great World Day and Night Bank, and became distracted. As the wedding date approached, she suddenly developed symptoms of mental disorder. Although renowned Chinese and Western doctors were immediately consulted for treatment, it was of no avail. However, I had already spent a lot of money preparing the banquet. Since Ms. Wang had symptoms of mental disorder, the marriage could not proceed. The matchmaker expressed her apologies and, along with relatives and the original matchmaker, negotiated at the original site of Yipinxian. The matchmaker voluntarily compensated for all banquet losses. All betrothal gifts were returned, and the marriage contract was terminated. A written agreement was made as evidence of a peaceful resolution. Now, your newspaper stated that I was unaccustomed to being a widower, filled with elderly vigor, and that Ms. Wang was just of marriageable age, etc. These are all groundless rumors and related to my reputation. In addition to publishing an advertisement to clarify the facts, I am writing to your newspaper to correct the record, clarify the truth, and avoid misunderstandings. I eagerly await your response.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Xu Xiuting</p>

<h3>Random Notes from a Northern Journey</h3>
<p>— An Ping</p>
<p>7.  On the Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>Because there was still time before the train's departure, and being bored, I went to a small restaurant in the town for a snack. After finishing the snack, I bought a dollar's worth of fruit to take on the train. Just then, passengers crossing the river from Xiaguan boarded the train in a continuous stream. As usual, the train was noisy for a while until 7:00 AM, when the train departed, and things gradually became orderly.</p>
<p>The Jinpu train is not as fast as the Jinghu or Huhu trains. Just listening to the rhythm of the wheels, I felt annoyed, like an old ox, just panting but not running. The journey from Pukou to Xuzhou is not much different from Shanghai to Nanjing. The express train from Shanghai to Nanjing takes only seven and a half hours, but the Jinpu train doesn't work that way, taking more than eleven hours. However, the train carriage is still quite comfortable. I remember seeing a small newspaper in Shanghai saying that the railway department was saving money, and second-class carriages were using stoves instead of water radiators, but that was not the case on the Jinpu train. There were water pipes in the rooms and corridors. One didn't even need a coat; it seemed that just wearing a flannel shirt was enough.</p>
<p>However, the most regrettable thing about the Jinpu train, and what the people feel most苦痛 about, is that there are no sleeping berths in the third-class carriages. Just from Pukou to Tianjin, it takes two nights and more than a day. How can one endure it without sleep? Once, when the train stopped at a station, I got off to take a walk on the platform. Seeing the chaos and suffering in the third-class carriages, I felt uneasy. To take care of one's health, one had to sit in second class. However, second class from Shanghai to Beijing, including expenses on the road, costs eighty yuan for just one trip. Isn't China still mostly made up of poor people?</p>
<p>Just after waking up, Xuzhou was far behind. At 11:00 AM, the train arrived in Yanzhou. Upon arriving here, what I saw and heard became completely different from Jiangnan. The banknotes, jiao coins, and copper coins of Jiangnan are no longer usable to the north. In Yanzhou, it seems to be still okay. There are some people who specialize in this business, seeing you coming from the south, they will exchange silver notes, jiao notes, money notes, and large copper coins commonly used in the north for you. Seeing you coming from the north, they will exchange banknotes, jiao coins, and small copper coins commonly used in the south for you. Although it is the same country, the famous commercial ports and cities in the north and south, such as Shanghai and Nanjing in the south, and Tianjin and Beijing in the north, do not even use the same banknotes, silver coins, and copper coins. Imagine how troublesome that is. In Shanghai, no matter which bank's banknotes you have, whether it's the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, or the Central Bank of China, they are not very circulated unless you lose two or three jiao for every five yuan. The banknotes used in the north are mostly banknotes issued by the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank of China, with "Tianjin" marked on the notes, or notes issued by the Hebei Agricultural and Industrial Bank or the Dongbei Official Bank. The north does not use silver coins much, and Beijing has absolutely none. Beijing only uses jiao notes, ten jiao for one yuan (ten one-jiao notes, five two-jiao notes). Therefore, when buying anything in Beijing, the entry and exit are all in silver dollars. They also do not use the small copper coins of the south. The north uses a different kind of large copper coin, with two small copper coins exchanged for one large copper coin. The price of money in Beijing is even lower than in Shanghai, with one yuan exchangeable for 3,800 wen, and one jiao exchangeable for 380 wen. But the "wen" here is based on small copper coins, so one jiao for 380 wen is nineteen large copper coins. In Beijing, whether in any transaction, when it comes to copper coins, there are no odd numbers. For example, if you say twenty-six zi, it means thirteen large zi. If you say twenty-five zi, then aren't you going to pay twelve large zi and one small zi? If you say an odd number, needless to say, you are a complete "foreigner." I still remember when I was in Beijing, when paying for a rickshaw, I would often say twenty-five zi, thinking that twenty-five was an integer. Sometimes I would quickly remember and then say "twenty-six."</p>
<p>Along the Jinpu Railway, in areas like Yanzhou, Cangzhou, and Dezhou, there is a kind of roasted chicken that is very famous and surprisingly cheap. One roasted chicken only sells for thirty or forty jiao. I was very surprised at how it could be so cheap. The answer was that because the people in the north have such a hard life, no matter how cheap things like chicken and meat are, few people here eat them.</p>
<p>The train stations in the north are not as clean and orderly as in the south. There are many stalls lined up on the platforms, mostly doing business with third-class passengers. In Yanzhou, I lingered on the platform for a long time. The weather was not yet very cold; wearing a coat was just right. Most of the stalls were selling youtiao, pancakes, cigarettes, roasted chicken, and so on. There was also a kind of porridge made from corn, like a thin paste that we make with boiling water and instant noodles. I was curious and ordered a bowl, but it turned out to be bland and tasteless, and I couldn't swallow it. I only took two sips and gave up.</p>
<p>After that, the train arrived in Tai'an. After passing Tai'an, all the way to Jinan, the mountains were winding, all branches of the Tai'an Mountains. I don't know on which section of the road, among the mountains, several peaks stood out. A fellow passenger who had been to Mount Tai told me that those were the main peaks of Mount Tai. There were still some vaguely visible red spots on several peaks, probably temples. The mountain peaks were so high that they pierced into the clouds. Layers of white clouds obscured many peaks, so some only had the bottom part visible, and the top was blurry.</p>
<p>Life is truly hard for the people in the north. If you haven't been to the north, you wouldn't really feel how comfortable and fortunate Jiangnan is. Along the way, I didn't see anyone wearing foreign socks. Everyone was in old blue cloth clothes and trousers, with white cloth socks and black cloth shoes. As the train passed each station, many adults and children stood near the platform to watch the "living snake." I saw two children laughing as they watched the train, chewing on a piece of coarse flour cake in their hands. They ate with relish, making you think that the cake was so delicious. I think the pancakes eaten by the most pitiful rickshaw pullers in Jiangnan are more delicate and oily than the ones eaten by those two children. However, the porter said that the two children eating the cake were probably already considered children of wealthy families in this area.</p>
<p>There are also many small children and old women who specialize in coming to the train to kowtow on the ground and beg for copper coins. Yucheng is one example. When you see this train, you will naturally say that these children have no upbringing. However, they cannot even maintain their livelihood, how can they talk about upbringing? I saw a piece of uneaten cake crust thrown out of a window. Like a pack of wild dogs, many children rushed over, and finally the piece of cake crust was snatched by a winner, who proudly chewed on it in their mouth. The children who didn't get it all stared at the mouth of the child who did, or they would look aimlessly at the train, wondering if anything else would be thrown out.</p>
<p>On the Jinpu Railway in the Shandong section, there are many large iron bridges. Of course, everyone knows about the Yellow River Iron Bridge. In fact, there isn't even one like the Dawen River Iron Bridge on the Jinghu and Huhu lines. However, although they are large bridges, there is actually very little water flowing under them. For example, the Yellow River, the river surface under the Yellow River Iron Bridge, is probably not even half as wide as the Huangpu River at the Bund. As for the Dawen River, the waterway under the Dawen River Bridge is not even two zhang wide. Many of the rivers under the large bridges can be crossed on foot. The land in the north always has many rivers like that. When it's dry, people, animals, or carts cross in the river, and their footprints and wheel tracks are clearly imprinted in the river mud. The riverbeds in the north are that dry when dry, and when the water rises, it floods endlessly.</p>
<p>Because the bridges are long, the train shudders like a timid person when it drives over them. The train travels particularly slowly on the bridges. As soon as the train head passes the bridge, it runs especially fast. I remember that the Yellow River Iron Bridge alone took five minutes to cross. Although the bridge is long, the train runs slowly, which is also evident.</p>
