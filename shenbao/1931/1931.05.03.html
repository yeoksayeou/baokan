<h3>霍桑探案轉灣（二）</h3>
<p>— 程小靑</p>
<p>伊旣是衆賓們的視線的鵠的却偏偏厮纏我一會兒强我作舞一會兒又摭拾了幾句沙士比亞戲曲裹的難句呶呶的呌我解釋在伊原是天眞爛漫毫無顧忌但在我的地位説來爲避免一般人的誤解起見却不能不矜持些兒可是到時也没法脱身因此我反覺得有些窘促不安後來直到坐席的當兒我方才自由了些我本想略坐一坐就吿辭回去因爲佩芹的𤍠度怎樣着實使我焦心不料我加入的一席都是些酒國的健將我雖抱着堅守不戰主義可是我的陳線不堅终於被他們攻破於是經過了幾個通關我的酒量已過了限度我因着歷次的經騐再不願踏進醉鄉裹去便想到力敵不如智勝就一溜烟的悄悄逃席而出</p>
<p>這天晚上月明星稀温暖的南風吹在臉上很有些蘇散的作用當我出門的時候旣然出於逃席自然不曾正式告别佩賢也不曾送出門來那時女席已散但大廳上的十餘桌男賓却大半還在興高采烈的猜拳行令我也曾向我的鄰席上瞧過一瞧我的老友霍桑也早已不見我知道他對於尋常的應酬往往規避不到這一次却因着我的關係居然親自臨祝但他旣已不待終席而先行可見他也和我同樣的感着不耐呢</p>
<p>我出了大門沿黃河路的人行道上緩緩進行經了那一陣陣的夜風臉上的𤍠炙果然略略减些但腦室中還覺得昏沉沉的所以我决定步行回去借此運動一下使腦海中的血液得以流動下降我走到了黃河路轉角左手轉灣便走進了靑海路那裹排列的車馬旣已完盡行人也絶迹不見一轉灣間一鬧一靜便换了一個境界我不禁動了遐想到人生的命運和人情的冷暖也祇有一轉灣的差别假使佩賢的軍職一朝降落那麽第二次再有什麽慶典門前車馬諒來也不會再有這樣子擁擠熱鬧了罷</p>

<h3>繪畫與現代精神</h3>
<p>— 康</p>
<p>藝術的表現有樅的同横的兩面縱的是從古代的歷史傳説下來横的是展延在我們周遭的實生活在目前中國的藝術界裹要發現一種富有現代精神而同時又不遺棄古代優美的傳説底良好作品其不易於發現的困難是有如沙漠中發見一窪泉水般許多人因以爲藝術爲逃避人世間的象牙之塔在作品裹面不肯以自己内的有實感的心去滲合大衆的𤍠情藝術界的氣候自然也就益見低壓悶人了近年更因國内的天災人禍戎馬倉皇的戰爭自救之不暇焉有人來向這飢不能食寒不能衣的藝術問津是故在這靑黄不接的期間感到中國藝術界的貧乏得可憐却也有一般人稍加顧慮的然一部分人却在唱「爲藝術而藝術」的高調甚囂　上對於民間的隠情與疾苦好象毫不相關客觀的環境在他們的當前是熟視無覩的一部分的藝人産生在這種境界中更不容易産生着把握着時代的东西</p>
<p>這一次晨光藝術會以開拓荒漠的氣概盡了一點些微的力量這力量的給予就是爲我們所不能泯滅的一個印象即就是從縱的方面是能注意自己民族的傳説横的方面是忠誠地以𤍠烈的勇敢的慘痛的情緒灌輸到作品裏大概是大家公認的罷</p>
<p>我們知道時代的浪潮已洶湧到一個最高的頂點五卅的流血在民族革命史上作成了發動的急先鋒從前徬徨於十字街頭的人們這時因了民族的生存與競爭也不得不　然地覺醒他們的「爲藝術而藝術」的誕夢於是一部分認淸了時代的眞面便加入了戎行作實際的鬭爭民族革命到這時已漸漸漸的逹到最後的階段大時代的推移已劃淸了新舊的界綠以往視爲高雅的藝人所謂恬適無爲的生活早爲洪水般的浪潮中洗盡了横在眼前世界是全民族起來鬭爭的世界表現時代的藝術自然也不出乎例外一方面在凋零的園地看見了木葉盡脫一方面又可以望到綠滿枝頭當新陳代謝的交暫中表現民族意識的藝術作品益形成了時代的尖端晨光第五屆展覽會便在這樣的要求下開始與社會的人士相見了現在基於時代的分析以及我們隨着時代的步調轉换漸漸地在這兒也看出這意識方面與别的展覽會的出品有所不同處</p>
<p>關於縱的方面有民間的傳説傳説上經騐的産物因爲環境不同的關係所以每個民族必有他們相異的傳説在中國以最優秀最古老的民族著稱先民的傳説自然也是不少到現在而且還能遺留到民間我們的出品關於這一類的有「日車」「后羿射日」「女媧」「牛女」「涿鹿之野」等都盡量的採擇成作品的題材在「日車」這張畫上我們又可以看出民族間的神話的共通處我們古代曾有「帝御義和」的傳説然而這照遍大千世界的太陽從希臘的神話也能够拔得出法頓駕日車的故事據説日車落在非洲的地方把他們的　舍都燒光了他們的身體也因此灼成焦黑所以永遠都是這麽和炭渣一様的顔色至於關乎兩性的傳説在神話裹面也很不少「射日」是我們古代的民族一種徵服自然的意象后羿相傳是一个勇悍絶倫的男子他的妻子嫦娥也生得很美麗那時有九個太陽永遠羅列在天體上后羿便以驚人的膂力拔動着弓矢射成一個照耀現在的太陽其次是女媧氏鍊石補天這是因爲女媧看到「天空之氣有不足故鍊立色石以補其缺……」至於牛女的描寫則純粹是古代農村中男女相愛悦的象徵同時也含有鼓勵耕織的意義戰爭的傳說是黃帝與　才作戰的故事那時漢族移入中原在涿鹿之野和那苗族的首領蚩尤鏖戰這蚩尤除了强悍之外還能作霧迷住黃帝的軍旅黃帝於是有了指南車的發明把蚩尤克服了這兒更能充分的表現我們古代民族前進與勇敢的精神</p>
<p>關於横的方面有民族的恥辱和民族奮鬥的事實我們現在試掙開眼睛來看考當前的事實是不是足够使我們駭</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>目而驚心的國内因爲連年來軍閥混戰的結果差不多成了满目瘡痍而又重以國際帝國資本主義的侵襲一个偌大的中國幾乎淪於次殖民地的地位還不如於是民衆在迭接的慘案之下復加上年歲的飢　　臻不死於流血飲彈便餓斃於溝壑壯者却挺而走險去爲盜爲匪在都市上復有恥辱的慘案發生只要稍具感覺的人對於一切的呈現都能使内心劇裂尤其是外人勢力伸張的海上他們因爲找尋商塲的緣故就不惜派遣許多軍艦運送雄厚的兵力作保護在租借地上恣意横行就是這領土的主人公也只有在外人的勢力之下任他人蹂躪了試問那一次的慘案發生的地點不是在租界上那一租界不是充满了外國的軍隊我們在出品裏面這種印象却能把捉到的這在「靶子塲」中他們每天在那裏習射預備向我們進攻這情形是灼然地可以見到此外「虹口所見」是露骨地把日帝國主義者和用心烘托出來他們在那兒陳着堅鋭的鐵甲車倭兵的虎視永遠是那麼樣的在國民革命軍到上海時法帝國主者在華法交界的地方築了許多鐡門這題名「鐡門」的作品使我們想起帝國主義者對中華民族的很心此種種恥辱的作品給與我們一個鋭利的刺激</p>
<p>現在我們且來視察國内民衆的苦難他們在軍閥的鐡蹄之下求生不得求死不能的苦痛也有很長久的期間這是應該値得三爲嘆息的但在革命的勢力淹有大江南北以後時代的輪軸已漸漸的把他們推動他覺醒了在這一個大變革的時期中當然有許多的創痛戰爭之後仍不能免於凍餒甚至流離失所無家可歸這情形在中國的北部是極容易找到我們看了「流離」和「災民」這兩種作品那前人所咏的「田園寥落干戈後骨肉流離道路中」以及「朱門粱肉臭路有凍死骨」的詩句也愈覺得凄然而酸鼻了</p>
<p>中國民族的苦難依現在的情勢論眞是亘古所未聞在歷史上號稱洪楊之亂部没有現在的赤禍那樣慘酷這是屬於中國南部的事件如「長沙的印象」「赤色的恐怖」在這幾種作品上我們可以覺到一種逼人的氣氛許多人的生命許多輝煌的建築在火與血的暴發下燬滅了恐怖動亂的情狀到現在想起來也覺得不寒而慄其他關於民族奮鬥的描寫有「野玫瑰」「女宣傳传員」「黃河曉渡」會師鄭州」等類作品以爲代表在民國十五年的時候軍閥的鐡騎恣縱江南各省民衆處於水深火𤍠之中反抗的情緒已是逹到沸點尤以浙江諸暨縣的民衆爲最激昂「野玫瑰」就是作者攝取當時民衆準備響應革命軍的一幕情景在那時的婦女全是用𤍠烈的情緒去鼓勵男子鬥爭我們所看到的剛遒强健的「野玫瑰」即是該地婦女的典型「女宣傳員」也是女同胞們感到當前民族的苦難不僅是倚靠男子的力量可以完完全全獲得解除的勝利所以她們去參加實際工作的英勇是不减於當年的花木蘭至於革命軍出征的情况　鬥的事實這在溟的霧色的「黃河曉渡」以及「會師鄭州」的幾　作品中我們可以意識到戰地軍事的緊張民衆歡迎之𤍠烈在現在若稍𢌞想全身的血輪便也當沸騰的</p>
<p>所以這些出品不但是有把捉時代的尖端的描寫與乎獨創的風格和特質而且是給與了藝術的新生命</p>

<h3>Within a Six-Year Period</h3>
<h3>Program for Industrial Construction</h3>
<p>One of the Central Government's Proposals for the National Assembly</p>
<p>Nanjing, the Central Provisional Conference passed the proposal for a construction program on the second. During the initial period of political tutelage, the nation's talents and economy should be concentrated, and they should cooperate to jointly promote material construction to establish a new country and benefit the people's livelihood. However, material construction involves numerous details, and consulting everyone leads to disputes. If the program is not established and priorities are not balanced, progress will inevitably be slow and abandoned. Considering the overall plan, it is imperative to follow the regulations set by Sun Yat-sen and establish a century-long plan for national construction. Currently, due to limited financial resources and public support, major plans cannot be implemented simultaneously. Therefore, we select those that are within the realm of possibility and urgently needed for the national economy and the people's livelihood, and must be constructed and completed within a limited time frame. We set a minimum plan, and the government and the people work together to achieve it. If it is not completed by the deadline, the responsible parties will be severely punished. All things start simple and end complex, and progress will inevitably face difficulties. Even considering the economic aspect, in addition to gathering national capital and the national economy, we must also use foreign capital under truly favorable conditions to engage in construction. In short, whether or not the construction project can be completed depends entirely on whether the government and the people have the determination. Now that the National Government has this determination, it is hoped that the people of the whole country will regard it as a major plan for their own lives and do their best to assist. The proposal for the minimum industrial construction program within a six-year period is hereby determined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Determine the industrial plan in Sun Yat-sen's National Reconstruction Program as the highest principle for the material construction of the Republic of China. The National Government shall specify a phased implementation plan and follow it accordingly. (2) According to the current urgent needs of the national economy and people's livelihood, complete the following railways within a limited time frame: A. Yuehan Railway, from Zhuzhou to Shaoguan, to be completed by the end of 1933. B. Longhai Railway: 1. From Tongguan to Xi'an, to be completed by the end of 1932; 2. From Xi'an to Lanzhou, to be completed by the end of 1936; 3. Yunhezhan to Taierzhuang branch line, to be completed by June 1932. C. New Long-Sui Railway, from Baotou to Ningxia, to be completed by June 1934. D. Jing-Xiang Railway, from Nanjing to Zhuzhou, to be completed by the end of 1934. E. Cangshi Railway, from Cangzhou to Shijiazhuang, to be completed by the end of June 1932. (3) The entire Huai River harnessing project shall be completed by the end of 1935. The Yellow River harnessing project shall be handled by the National Government as a priority and completed within a limited time frame. (4) By the end of 1935, the first phase of construction of the two major ports in the South and East, as well as the Huludao and Haizhou ports, must be completed. (5) By the end of 1935, the country must add and complete 200,000 kilometers of highways. The distribution of routes shall be determined by the National Government according to traffic needs. (6) By the end of 1935, the country must add more than 50,000 kilometers of air routes and 1,000 commercial aircraft. The National Government shall actively plan and encourage this. (7) By the end of 1935, state-owned shipping should increase from 200,000 to 300,000 tons. In addition to inland and coastal shipping, shipping lines to Southeast Asia and overseas should be established. The government should encourage and assist people engaged in shipping. (8) Basic industries such as water conservancy, electricity, steel, alkali, coal, sugar, kerosene, and automobiles should be actively developed by the National Government.

Increase the number of vocational schools and various vocational supplementary schools as much as possible.

<h3>Negotiations on the Recovery of Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Both British and Brazilian Envoys Await Reply</p>
<p>Nanjing, there was originally no problem with Brazil's jurisdiction. The Brazilian envoy came to Nanjing and contacted Xu Mo twice, but the government's reply had not arrived and could not be resolved immediately. Foreign Minister Wang hosted a banquet for the Brazilian envoy and the heads of various departments on the evening of the second to express friendship. If the British envoy understands and makes concessions on the one point on which China and the UK have not agreed, it will not be difficult to resolve. However, the UK's reply has not arrived, creating a depressing situation. According to diplomatic circles, there are still two days until May 5. It may be resolved within two days. The twelve articles of the regulations on the implementation of measures for administering lawsuits involving foreigners in China have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and will be implemented depending on the outcome of the negotiations (Second Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing, the French envoy told people that France is still willing to negotiate the issue of jurisdiction. The reason why the progress is not as smooth as that of other countries is that the interpretation of the articles in the old Sino-French treaty is different from the wording of the old Sino-British treaty, so the progress is slightly slower. However, the French side will continue to discuss it in the future and hopes to achieve results soon (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, tonight, Foreign Minister Wang will host a banquet for Brazilian Minister Wei Losuo. Regarding Sino-Brazilian jurisdiction, it has been generally agreed before the banquet that it will be the same as Norway. The Brazilian envoy requested that China should abandon the covenant countries at the same time and receive the most-favored-nation treatment. Our side seems to have accepted this and the signing is not far off. Regarding one point that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have not resolved, our side has firmly stated that there is no room for further discussion. Whether it can be resolved smoothly before the National Assembly depends on whether the United Kingdom and the United States can make concessions (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>An Overview of International Labor Day</h3>
<p>The commemoration of International Labor Day commemorates the progress of the labor movement from darkness to light. Since it was designated as a day of remembrance in 1886, it has been 46 years. Labor workers in various countries have strived for this path of light, so each commemoration has demonstrations and marches. Clashes and disturbances with local military police and even major tragedies have often occurred as a result of demonstrations and marches. This year's commemorations in countries around the world have generally been peaceful. Although there have been some minor disturbances, they have not been as serious as in previous years. For example, Shanghai in China was safe and sound, and Japan only had minor conflicts between certain union groups and the police when the march ended. New York in the United States was also peaceful. Due to strict precautions, the marches and speeches in major cities did not cause any incidents. As for European countries such as Portugal, Spain, Poland, and the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, although there have been incidents of bloodshed, injuries, and arrests, they have not resulted in major disasters, which all countries are fortunate to have avoided. However, we should keep in mind the reason why the labor movement commemorates this day, on the one hand to commemorate the past and on the other hand to strive for the future. The first thing we should strive for in the future is the upcoming International Labor Conference. The Labor Conference is an important mechanism for seeking the happiness of the labor movement and achieving the path of light. Now, representatives from various countries have set off one after another. If the results are more progressive, it will be the good fortune of the labor movement.</p>

<h3>Catalonia Province of Spain Organizes Independent Cabinet</h3>
<p>Macià Disregards His Previous Words</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 30th - Although the dispute between mainland Spain and Catalonia Province had been eased as a result of personal mediation by the Provisional Government's Prime Minister Zamora, Catalonia Province today organized a cabinet, with Macià himself serving as Prime Minister. This move has now aroused a complete backlash in Madrid's public opinion because Macià had previously promised not to take any actions that would harm the credibility of the Madrid Provisional Government.

<h3>Torrential Floods in the Three Rivers of Guangdong</h3>
<p>▲The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Line Flooded</p>
<p>▲Huizhou and Shaozhou City Become a Land of Lakes</p>
<p>▲Qingyuan and Shixing Send Telegrams Requesting Relief</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Due to continuous spring rains over the past month in Guangdong Province, the eastern, western, and northern rivers have simultaneously experienced torrential floods. On the East River, the Guangzhou-Kowloon railway line has already been submerged in several places. On the 24th, the first express train from Guangzhou to Shenzhen, traveling to the Gaomenlou Bridge No. 95 in Shilong, found that the bridge was submerged. The train was forced to return to Shilong, and traffic from the province to Shenzhen was disrupted again for several days. It is reported that the floodwaters continue to rise in the submerged areas. The East River flows through the lower reaches, but the flooding in the upper reaches is even more severe. The towns and cities along the banks of the upper East River have become a land of lakes, with many houses collapsing. Hengli and Tonghu in Huiyang, Paiwei, Qinü Lake, Sucun, and Shiwan in Boluo, and Qiaotou, Tiejang, Dongan, and Xianan in Dongguan are all submerged. Many houses in mountain villages near Henghe were destroyed by the floods from Mount Luofu, and many people drowned. A telegram from Shilong, Dongguan, reported yesterday that Shilong City and nearby areas are suffering from flooding. Low-lying areas are submerged up to the chest, and high-lying areas are submerged up to the knees. The water on the roads is more than three feet deep. Dikes in nearby villages have collapsed. Urgent relief is requested. At present, various charitable halls and business associations have discussed relief measures and will send personnel carrying over 16,000 catties of rice, over 20 loads of cakes and snacks, and medicine by train to the Shilong area for relief. The river near Huizhou has also become a vast expanse of water. The city and its suburbs are completely submerged. People travel on the streets by small boats. From the Clock Tower in the city to Datie Lane, the water is six feet eight inches deep. The streets along the upper and lower West Lake are about eight feet to one zhang deep. From Henglang Lane to Daxi Gate, the depth is over seven feet. From Daxi Gate to Fuxiang in the west of the city, the depth is over five feet. The water in the Xiami Street area near the Great East Gate is over one zhang deep, and the water in the upper and lower Tang areas is four to six feet deep. All schools have been completely suspended, shops have closed, and the poor are struggling to make a living. Charitable organizations have been organizing road repairs for days, providing work as a form of relief. On the West River, the originally constructed sluice gate in San Shui Luba, which cost over 100,000 yuan, was recently overwhelmed by the floodwaters. The floodwaters rushed back and flooded the villages on the opposite bank, turning them into a land of lakes. No less than dozens of houses have collapsed, and many residents have fled, resulting in numerous deaths. The ferry fare, which is normally only ten cents, has increased to two yuan. Since the 25th, the water level has risen further, making it impossible to cross the river. The villages along the Jiang'an coast have become a vast expanse of water. On the North River, mountain torrents are also raging. A section of the Ma-Ba railway track above Yingde was damaged by the flood, and Guangzhou-Shaozhou trains were suspended for several days before resuming operations yesterday. However, the water level in the Xiangjiang River in Qingyuan is still high. Dozens of boats have capsized in recent days. Because Qingyuan is located in the Xiangjiang River basin, when the North River rises, the Xiangjiang River also floods. Qingyuan County is the first to be affected. The disastrous situation is evident. Houses are collapsing and dikes are breached every day. Yesterday, the county reported that the water level in the county is rising rapidly, and all foundations are in danger. Efforts are being made to rescue the area, as the disaster is reminiscent of the Yimao year. The county is allocating funds to provide relief, but the disaster area is vast, and the resources are insufficient. Urgent relief funds are requested and await orders. In Shaozhou City, the water level was most turbulent on the morning of the 22nd. The streets in the city have become a land of lakes, with water depths exceeding four feet in higher areas and seven feet in lower areas. Many refugees have climbed onto rooftops to avoid the floodwaters. Police officers are using boats to rescue them. Those who have no homes are being provided with porridge by charitable organizations. The disaster situation in Shixing is also extremely serious. The county has also sent a telegram requesting relief. (28th)</p>

<h3>Preliminary Rounds of Ball Games</h3>
<h3>Men's Soccer</h3>
<h3>Provincial Beijing Middle School Wins Against Private Yangzhou Middle School | Three to Zero</h3>
<p>At around 9 a.m. on the 2nd, Provincial Nanjing Middle School competed against Provincial Yangzhou Middle School in soccer. Referee was Tang Zhongguang. Beijing Middle School's soccer skills were indeed stronger than Yangzhou Middle School's. Therefore, even though Beijing Middle School was in a downwind position in the first half, they were still able to kick in one goal. The ball was kicked in by Chen Hong. Although the Yangzhou Middle School goalkeeper caught the ball, it had already crossed the line. The referee thus ruled that Yangzhou Middle School lost one goal. In the second half, the sides were switched, and with the benefit of the tailwind, Beijing Middle School's ball control became even more intense. Yangzhou Middle School's area was filled with Beijing Middle School athletes, and they were penalized for corner kicks more than ten times, creating a one-sided situation. During this time, both corner kicks were kicked by Chen Hong and Tang. One landed in the right corner of the Yangzhou goal and was headed in by Yu Ren; the other was kicked in by Chen alone, which was extremely skillful. In conclusion, with a score of three to zero, Beijing Middle School won.</p>

The representative of Suzhou Girls' High School suggested that, according to the precedent of last year's National Games, when the scores are the same, the number of shots made and the number of free throws should be used to determine the winner. The referees decided that a rematch was necessary. So, the two sides fought bravely, and the students on the field all</p>
<p>cheered wildly to support them. In the end, Suzhou Girls' High School won the right to the semi-finals with a score of twenty-one to twenty.

<p>Participants included more than 200 athletes from twelve schools, including Jinling, Soochow, Cuiying, Yancheng, Taowu, Shanghai University, St. John's, Minqiang, Qingxin, Xiuzhou, Zhijiang, and Huilan. Soochow University won the championship with thirty-nine points (a total of five first places, three second places, two third places, and one fourth place). Shanghai University was second with twenty-five and a half points, Jinling was third with twenty-two points, Taowu was fourth with sixteen points, St. John's was fifth with fifteen points, Yancheng was sixth with nine points, Zhijiang was seventh with eight points, Minqiang was eighth with six points, Qingxin was ninth with five points, Cuiying was tenth with four and a half points, Huilan was eleventh with three points, and Xiuzhou was twelfth with one point.</p>
<h3>Overview of Results</h3>
<p>Liu Jiayu of Shanghai University threw the javelin 41.42 meters, breaking the first record of 40.16.5 meters set by Wen Dingxin of Shanghai University. Also, Wang Yongmin of Taowu jumped 12.54 meters in the triple jump, breaking his own third record of 12.28 meters. These were the new records of this conference. Cheng Jinguang, a short-distance runner from Yancheng, did not participate in the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter finals due to a leg injury yesterday, so it was a pity that he could not compare with his own conference record created in the third conference. The remaining results were relatively faded, even compared with the first Shanghai Secondary School Joint Sports Meeting held recently by the Shanghai Education Bureau.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Due to Lack of Funds, Schools in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Starting June 1st</p>
<h3>Decide to Start Vacation Early</h3>
<p>The principals of Jiangsu Provincial Middle Schools held a general meeting at Zhenjiang Middle School yesterday (30th) at 9:00 AM. Attendees included Ren Zhongmin (Zhenjiang Middle School), Wang Xiacai (Huaiyin Middle School), Chen Shi (Huai'an Middle School), Chen Shu (Suzhou Women's Middle School, Yang Jingqing representing), Wang Diancun (Suzhou Middle School), Xue Qiaodong (Xuzhou Middle School, Yu Yu representing), Zheng Tonghe (Shanghai Middle School), Gu Zhongchao (Tai Middle School, Zheng representing), Zhou Xingbei (Yangzhou Middle School), Chen Jingzhi (Songjiang Middle School), Feng Limin (Fisheries), Zhang Xiaoru (Nanjing Middle School), Chen Gucen (Wuxi Middle School), Sun Jie (Huanghai Middle School), Fei Dasheng (Suzhou Women's Middle School, Zhou representing), and Liao Jianan (Wang representing). Wang Diancun was unanimously elected chairman. After the formalities, Ren Zhongmin first reported on the arrears of funds and the urgent need for funds in various schools. The following major issues were then discussed and resolved: 1. Proposal on how to seek relief if schools cannot be maintained due to three months of arrears in funding. It was decided to elect representatives to petition the provincial government and the administrative office to clear the arrears before the fourth month by May 25th, otherwise the principals would not be able to bear the responsibility and would have to start the vacation early from June 1st. 2. According to the letter from the Ministry of Finance on March 14th, the amount of land tax levied over three years averaged more than 320 yuan per year, while the educational funding budget for the 19th year only listed 2.78 million yuan, a difference of more than 400,000 yuan, etc. (The original letter can be found in the Provincial Government Gazette No. 703.) What is the truth and should an inquiry be made? It was decided to inquire during the petition for the above case and bring it to the attention of the Education Funding Committee to pursue the arrears. 3. Educational staff serving in the three provinces should have the opportunity to go abroad for study in order to learn from experience and seek progress, and the funding should be included in the Education Department's budget. It was decided to submit a request to the Education Department to add an item for study expenses, following the regulations for educational staff studying local education. 4. For each subject in schools with different natures, the funding for each grade level should be calculated on a single-track basis. For schools with school buildings divided into three courtyards, the funding should be increased in proportion to the two courtyards. It was decided to submit a request to the Education Department again to allow the inclusion in the preparation of the next year's budget. 5. Should the number of research meetings for each subject be stipulated? It was decided that the proposed resolutions should be reviewed by the association. (1) The regulations for each subject research association should be submitted to the association for verification. If there are any improprieties, the association may express its opinions. (2) Regarding the resolutions passed by each association, those that do not involve school administration should be reported to the principal by the teachers of the relevant subject for implementation. Matters related to publication should be encouraged by each school. (3) Resolutions related to the administrative issues of one school should be decided by the principal of that school. (4) Matters involving the administrative issues of all schools must be sent to the association for review and approval before implementation. (5) The subject research meetings should be divided into (A) Party Ideology and Society, (B) Chinese, (C) English, and (D) Natural Sciences. Each type should hold one meeting per year, and two subject research meetings should be held each semester. 6. Can the summer conference be initiated by the association? It was decided that the association should initiate the drafting of the summer conference regulations by Suzhou Middle School and the preparation of the venue by Shanghai Middle School, tentatively scheduled for Putuo. 7. The letter from the Joint Association of English Subject Conferences of Provincial Middle Schools requesting discussion of the regulations was decided to be (1) The Joint Association of English Subject Conferences should be changed to the English Subject Research Association. (2) Article 4, "annual term" should be changed to "per academic year." (3) One full-time director should be appointed for a term of one year. (4) The chairman of the standing committee in Article 4 should be changed to the full-time director, and the rest should be approved. 8. Proposal for the Chinese subject examination: (1) Suzhou Middle School should be responsible for setting the questions and drafting the test paper format, which will be sent to each school for self-administration. Two students from each school should be selected for both senior and junior high levels. (2) Suzhou Middle School should set a deadline for collecting the test papers selected by each school and invite three experts from outside the school to evaluate them by a certain date. (3) The scores graded by the three experts should be averaged, and five students should be selected for both senior and junior high levels. 9. Should a Party Ideology speech competition be held? It was decided to hold it in the fall. 10. It was decided that (1) Each school should report independently, but the Chinese and English subject research associations have already been established, and mathematics will also be established soon. These three are basic subjects with a lot of research material and should be responsible for collecting and compiling them separately. (2) Yangzhou Middle School should be responsible for collecting Chinese research materials, Suzhou Middle School should be responsible for collecting English research results, and Shanghai Middle School should be responsible for collecting mathematics research materials. All should be submitted to the department before May 20th.</p>
<p>After the above ten proposals were discussed, they went to the Education Department to meet with the director to report everything. In the afternoon of the 1st, they continued to discuss issues such as the organization of student self-government associations and will make some suggestions.</p>

<h3>Talk by Jiang Zuobin</h3>
<p>Requesting Leave to Return Home to Report on Diplomacy</p>
<p>Sino-Russian Conference is Considered Smooth</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's Efforts are Extremely Admirable</p>
<p>European Economic Panic is Extreme</p>
<p>Jiang Zuobin, the Minister to Germany, requested leave to return home some time ago and stopped briefly in Moscow on his way. On April 29th, he arrived in Dalian and took the Changchun Maru southward. The day before yesterday (1st), he arrived in port at 3:00 PM. Tang Liu, the director of the Foreign Affairs Office, and Minister Jiang's wife and daughter all went to the Huangpu Wharf to greet him. After landing, Jiang took a car to his private residence on Lafayette Road to rest. Our reporter interviewed him at his residence. The following is a record of his talk.</p>
<h3>Observation of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Jiang said that he left Berlin on March 15th and arrived in Moscow on the 17th. He was ordered to inspect the Soviet Russian Five-Year Economic Plan. The highest design committee of the Five-Year Economic Implementation Plan led him to visit and inspect. As a result, the Soviet Union's economic plan was truly amazing. The spirit of unity and struggle from top to bottom was especially commendable. The outline of the plan is that the people of the whole country save on food and clothing, sell the goods they produce abroad at extremely low prices, and then use the money they earn to purchase various machines to improve domestic production. It is expected that the results will be considerable in a few years.</p>
<p>Minister Jiang Zuobin and his wife (photographed by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Sino-Russian Conference</h3>
<p>Jiang also said that he met with Representative Mo Dehui repeatedly in Russia. The Sino-Russian conference is progressing smoothly. Three meetings have been held, and the Eastern Railway issue is still being discussed. The restoration of diplomatic relations and commerce have not been mentioned. It is rumored that the central government ordered him to assist Mr. Mo in handling the negotiations, but this is not true. The responsibility for diplomatic negotiations lies with the specialist. Representative Mo is knowledgeable, hardworking, and meticulous, and is worthy of important responsibility.</p>
<h3>European Situation</h3>
<p>When the reporter asked about the recent situation in Europe, Jiang replied that the panic in the European economic world has reached its peak. Unemployment is increasing day by day. Although all parties are trying their best to seek remedies, there is no thorough solution plan. As for the talk that the Second World War is about to break out, it is actually just nervous talk. European society mostly regards our country as a country that is determined to reform and is emerging. However, the governments of various countries still adhere to their self-interest and maintain their consistent policies.</p>
<h3>Returning Home to Report</h3>
<p>This time, I returned home to ask the government for leave, on the one hand to report the situation abroad to the central government. At the same time, because I have been away from the country for a long time, I can also take this opportunity to understand the progress of various matters in the country. As for the affairs of the embassy, they are currently being handled by Liang Long, the secretary of the embassy. I will go to Beijing within a few days. As for when I will return to my post, it will all depend on the will of the central government.</p>
<h3>Shigemitsu Aoi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<h3>The Future of Sino-Japanese Jurisdictional Negotiations</h3>
<h3>Developing Based on the Principle of Reconciliation</h3>

Those who greeted him at the Huishan Wharf included the Japanese Consul General Murai and others. After landing, Shigemitsu went to the Japanese Consulate General to rest and then returned to his private residence at 79 Qiqi Road. After arriving in Shanghai, Shigemitsu spoke to Chinese and foreign reporters, saying that he arrived in Tokyo on the 24th of last month and contacted the Japanese government's foreign affairs officials. The Sino-Japanese jurisdictional negotiations were very busy. Finally, a basic plan was decided in a short period of time. New developments are expected in the jurisdictional negotiations. Sino-Japanese relations are close, and reconciliation is necessary. Future negotiations should be conducted based on this principle. Shigemitsu did not give a specific indication of when he would go to Beijing to renegotiate with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting yesterday. According to Japanese sources, the basic conditions for the Tokyo government's decision to abolish jurisdictional negotiations are: (1) Establishing special courts in special areas such as Shanghai; (2) Excluding Manchuria and Mongolia; (3) Opening up the Chinese interior; (4) Effectively protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents in China.</p>

<h3>Request to Negotiate with Soviet Russia for the Release of Captured Chinese Soldiers</h3>
<p>Song Diankui's Remarks in This Newspaper</p>
<p>Negotiations between China and Russia on the Middle East Railway issue are currently underway in Moscow. Yesterday, a man named Song Diankui came to our office claiming that over a thousand soldiers of the Northeast Border Defense Army are still being held captive in Russian territory. They escaped to Vladivostok with the assistance of Consul Xu and were able to return to China. He, representing the thousand-plus soldiers who have not been released, is requesting the government to negotiate for their release and is asking the press for support. According to his report on the situation of the captured Chinese soldiers in Russia, 61 soldiers were sent from Vladivostok to Gerashevka on January 8th this year, 370 were sent to Moblato, and another 500 to various other places. They are forced to perform grueling logging labor every day, and their living conditions are unbearable. The names of the soldiers known are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Huichun, Zhu Xuehai, Zhang Zhizhong, Jiang Liangchen, Jiang Chuanfa, Wang Fengjin, Sheng Baichuan, Liu Fengshan, Wang Xueshan, Fu Hai, Zhao Jixiang, Shang Lianke, Li Zhendong, Bi Zhendong, Li Dianjia, Liu Dongguo, Yu Xuelong, Wang Shicheng, Xiao Tianjing, Yang Yushun, Huang Fu, Li Haishan, Wen Qinghe, Xu Wenxuan, Wang Zongjiang, Liu You, Xing Fangyun, Ma Yutang, Zhao Dehai, Wang Zhongjie, Tan Peizhi, Feng Hai, Jiang Lide, Chen Zhong, Hu Jinzhong, Run Jixiang, Guo Chengren, Yao Longxi, Xu Wenxian, Ma Xisheng, Pan Haishan, Bai Shengchuan, Zheng Maotong, Song Rulan, Wang Fenghui, Zhang Fengshan, Guo Tongyou, Li Zhenyou, Lü Ping, Liu Shaoting, Liu Wencheng, Chen Futing, Sun Xiude, Hu Yongchang, Bian Qingxiang, Bai Fulian, Yang Shuzi, Chen Kuiwu, Chen Xiuhai, Mao Jinbiao, Liu Yaqi, and others.</p>

<h3>The Post Office Seeks Accurate and Swift Mail Delivery</h3>
<p>Relying on the Full Cooperation of the Public Concerned</p>
<p>It is heard from the Shanghai Post Office that Shanghai's population is increasing daily, and many new buildings are being constructed (especially apartments). Therefore, accurate and swift mail delivery has become a real problem. The Post Office is committed to providing the public with excellent service to the best of its ability. However, to facilitate this important work, it is necessary to rely on the full cooperation of the public concerned. It is extremely difficult to process mail with incomplete or inaccurate addresses. Therefore, in addition to clearly writing the recipient's full name, all house numbers, street names, and building</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>names, etc., and in the case of apartments, the room number or residence number, and the floor number, must be specified in detail. If it is a foreign language letter, adding the Chinese address can further guarantee accurate and swift delivery. Also, for private residences, it is best to install a mailbox on the front door or in the hallway, or to make a slit in the door, and it should be installed in an easily accessible location for the postman to facilitate delivery. Furthermore, commercial organizations or apartments should install mailboxes in a conspicuous location in the lobby or entrance, or provide one for each residence or room, or establish a dedicated mail collection point to be fully responsible for receiving all mail for the building. The postal authorities are very willing to offer their advice on which system and which style of mailbox are most suitable.</p>
<h3>Joint Investigation of Factory Information</h3>
<p>Three Government Agencies</p>
<p>Two Academic Organizations</p>
<p>Starting from the 6th</p>
<p>The Accounting Department, Statistics Bureau, and Ministry of Industry of the National Government, in order to understand the state of domestic industry so as to compile statistics and promote domestic goods, will first investigate the mechanical industry in Shanghai and then other provinces. The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau also wants to investigate the factories in this city to compare with the survey of 1928, and the Institute of Transportation of Jiaotong University wants to study the transportation of industrial products. The China Economic Society wants to study the rise and fall of domestic and foreign goods. Therefore, the three government agencies and two academic organizations have jointly established a Shanghai Industrial Survey Joint Office on the third floor of 50 Beijing Road, using the same form for a widespread investigation. Each agency has assigned more than ten staff members to share the investigation duties, which can avoid the trouble of repeated investigations in the factories, and the government agencies can also achieve twice the results with half the effort. It is truly a win-win situation.

It is now heard that they will begin their investigation on May 6th.</p>

<h3>Sequel to the Nanning and Hubei Collision</h3>
<p>Sailing to Tortoise Mountain, a Thick Fog Suddenly Arises</p>
<p>Ordered to Throw Soybean Cakes, the Bow of the Ship Floats</p>
<p>The Nanning vessel of the British Swire Company collided with the Hubei vessel of our company near Xiamen. Both vessels were severely damaged, with the Nanning suffering even greater losses. A brief account has been published in the previous newspaper. Last night, the Hubei vessel arrived in Shanghai. The reporter went to various parties to investigate the circumstances of the accident, as follows:</p>
<h3>Collision in the Fog</h3>
<p>The Nanning vessel of the Swire Company operates on the Niuzhuang, Dalian, Shantou, and Xiamen route. This time, the vessel was specially dispatched to transport a large batch of soybean cakes from Yingkou to South China. On April 30th, around 9:00 AM, when the ship was nearly one hundred nautical miles from Xiamen, at a place called Tortoise Mountain, a thick fog suddenly arose on the sea, making it impossible to see even a short distance away. The Nanning vessel continued to sail in the fog. At this time, the Hubei vessel was also sailing from Hong Kong to Shanghai with goods. It was also sailing to Tortoise Mountain. In the fog, the Nanning and Hubei were on a straight line and were obscured by the fog. Neither vessel saw each other until they were close. The Nanning and Hubei tried to avoid each other, but it was too late, and the two vessels collided.</p>
<h3>Both Ships Damaged</h3>
<p>The Hubei and Nanning vessels were each sailing. The Nanning vessel was faster and crashed into the Hubei vessel first. The Hubei vessel was unable to avoid it, and the bow was severely damaged. The steel plates around the anchor hole were broken, and the bow was collapsed. Fortunately, the damage was above the waterline, so the rupture was not too severe, and there was no water ingress. The Nanning vessel was hit behind the bow, and the outer hull of the first hold was struck by the Hubei, creating a large hole between the waterlines. The Nanning vessel then heavily　took on seawater, causing a great danger.</p>
<h3>Abandoning Huge Cargo</h3>
<p>After the Nanning ship's hull was damaged, seeing that seawater had entered the forward hold and the hull was gradually sinking, the situation was extremely critical. In order to remedy the situation, the captain immediately ordered the soybean cakes loaded in the forward hold to be quickly thrown into the sea in order to reduce the load. Eight out of ten of the several hundred tons of soybean cakes in the forward hold were thrown into the sea. The forward hold gradually rose, and the sailors were ordered to pump the water out of the hold, so that the hull could be preserved and not sink. It was truly a great stroke of luck amidst misfortune.</p>
<h3>Nanchang Towing and Rescue</h3>
<p>When the Nanning was in danger, fortunately the Nanchang vessel of the same company sailed past the Tortoise Mountain sea area. The Nanning flew a　flag for help, and the Nanchang vessel immediately sailed to rescue it. The Nanning vessel was towed to Xiamen. It was originally going to Shantou, but changed course to Xiamen due to the accident. The cargo was first unloaded, and then it will go to Hong Kong for repairs.</p>
<h3>Hubei Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Hubei vessel set off first to Shanghai after the fog cleared. Yesterday, it had already entered port. The bow was broken. Yesterday, it was unloading cargo in Pudong, and then it will go to the factory for repairs. The Nanning vessel suffered huge losses this time. The hull and cargo were worth at least 30,000 yuan. The Hubei's losses were also six or seven thousand taels. Fortunately, the accident occurred during the daytime, so no one was injured.</p>
<h3>Sequel to the Ship Accident</h3>
<h3>Waking Lion Enters Dock</h3>
<p>The Waking Lion vessel of the Sanbei Company collided with the French postal ship Sphinx on the Lujiazui river surface of the Huangpu River on its way from Shanghai to Haizhou, as reported in this newspaper. The damage to the Waking Lion was at the bow, while the damage to the French vessel was at the stern. After the Waking Lion returned to the Nidu Wharf, the Sanbei Company immediately invited surveyor Mr. Engels to the ship to survey the damage. It was estimated that repairs would cost at least 7,000 taels. Yesterday, the cargo on the ship was transferred to the Fulong vessel to be transported to Haizhou. The Waking Lion was originally going to undergo major repairs. Yesterday, it was towed into the Sanbei Main Factory to begin repairs. It is estimated that it will take one month before it can leave the factory. As for the five sugar barges that were sunk by the Waking Lion, with the loss of more than 300 bags of sugar, the owners of the lost cargo negotiated with Sanbei yesterday for compensation. The Sanbei Company must send a surveyor to investigate before determining the method. As for the damage to the stern of the French postal ship, it was also verified by Engels to be about 3,000 taels in repair costs. However, due to the schedule, it could not stay in Shanghai for long and has already sailed to Japan. As for the question of responsibility for the accident, according to the Waking Lion captain of Sanbei, Weng Jiqing, the collision was unavoidable. According to the French shipowner's report, when turning the ship, the vessel had already hoisted the stop-ship-passing warning ball, but the Waking Lion still moved forward, so the responsibility lies with the Waking Lion.</p>
<h3>Minghe Towing and Rescue</h3>
<p>After the Minghe vessel ran aground north of Vladivostok, the crew escaped to the summit of Shipai Nuofu Reef to take shelter. Yesterday, the Sanbei Company received a telegram from Vladivostok stating that the Minghe was still aground and had not sunk. The crew and sailors on the mountain had returned to the ship and are waiting for Shanghai to send a vessel to rescue them. The company is waiting for the new Nining Xing to return from Hankou today. After dismantling the radio equipment and installing it on the Fengpu vessel, it will set off to the scene of the accident to rescue the crew and inspect the situation in order to tow the vessel. The Fengpu is scheduled to go to Vladivostok tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Daji Repair</h3>
<p>The shell of the Daji vessel of the Dada Company, which was bombed, has been towed back to Shanghai. Because the machinery and engine are incomplete, it has been decided to carry out major repairs, which will be undertaken by the Ruian factory. The entire superstructure above the main deck must be rebuilt, which will take three months to complete. The repair cost will be 160,000 taels of silver, and the repair contract has been signed. It is expected to be able to leave the factory and operate within September of this year.</p>
<h3>Yangtze Steamer Agrees to Compensate for Some Crew Losses</h3>
<p>For the deceased: Compensation of 350 yuan per person</p>
<p>For the living: Compensation of 80 yuan per person for each loss</p>
<p>Ling Hong, the representative of the crew of the Laicheng Company's Yangtze steamer, and Li Zuyao, the English secretary of the Seamen's Union, went to the company at 35 Renji Road the day before yesterday afternoon to negotiate. Cai Jingbo, the company's representative, met with them, and after discussion, the following three points were agreed upon: 1. Compensation for the deceased tallyman Liang Yuchen, steward Chen Fa, and deputy fireman Shen Ruiying will be 350 yuan each. The money will be given to their families when they come to Shanghai to collect it. 2. The nineteen Cantonese crew members Ling Hong, Lin Xiong, Lu Tiao, Ling Ji, Luo Jiewen, Hua Liangyuan, Lin Bing, Tan Yufen, Chen Yu, Liang Bingrong, Lin Jia, Ling Liang, Li Min, Lin Chang, Zhu He, Lin Jing, Xu Jiu, Cai Cheng, etc., will be given 80 yuan each as compensation, in addition to the temporary relief money of 15 yuan each that was previously issued by the French Concession police. 3. All expenses incurred by those remaining in Shanghai and residing in the Tallymen's Club in Hongkou, starting from the time the French Concession police stopped providing food, will be borne by the company, totaling 200 yuan. However, the above only applies to Cantonese crew members. The compensation for the deceased and losses for the living for crew members from Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces has not yet been fully resolved.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Organization Smashed on Avenue du Bagne</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command learned that 93 Avenue du Bagne was a Communist Party organization, so it dispatched detectives to cooperate with the Jingansi Road Patrol Station to arrest several people and seize two Communist books at 7:00 AM one day. They were taken to the Jingansi Patrol Station. After a brief interrogation by the head of the patrol, they were handed over to detectives from the Garrison Command and taken to Longhua.</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Nature of the Qualifying Examination</h3>
<p>Designed for Outstanding Young People Who Cannot Afford to Study</p>
<p>The Municipal Qualifying Examination Committee yesterday received instructions from the Examination Yuan, according to the Hunan Qualifying Examination Committee's explanation of the nature of the examination, stating that Article 4 of the Examination Law stipulates that graduates of registered public or private secondary schools or above, or those with equivalent academic qualifications to graduates of secondary schools or above, who have passed the qualifying examination, may take the general examination. Article 5 stipulates that graduates of national or registered public or private colleges or above, or graduates of foreign colleges or above recognized by the Ministry of Education, or those with equivalent academic qualifications to graduates of universities or colleges, who have passed the qualifying examination, may take the higher examination. The higher and general qualifying examinations are purely designed to select outstanding young people who cannot afford to study. All those who have equivalent academic qualifications to higher and general examinations without graduating from a school or graduating from a school not approved by the Ministry of Education may take the qualifying examination. Upon passing the qualifying examination, a certificate will be issued, and they will be qualified to take the higher or general examination.</p>
<h3>Crisis in the Foreign Trade of Raw Silk</h3>
<p>Lyon Silk Trade Association's Letter of Advice</p>
<p>Hoping for Improvements in Manufacturing Methods</p>
<p>The Lyon Silk Trade Association of France has recently sent letters and telegrams to the Shanghai Raw Silk Exporters Association, stating that "The poor quality of Chinese filature silk has caused great difficulties and dangers in the French market. Silk merchants here will soon seek other sources. It is hoped that there will be improvements in manufacturing methods and strict inspections." It also said, "In this period of economic panic, commodity trade is already extremely difficult. Lax inspections will only create negative results. The quality of raw silk produced in your region is deteriorating.　At a time when various countries are demanding increasingly stricter management methods for raw silk and other silk-producing countries such as Japan and Italy are making great progress, the decline in the quality of Chinese raw silk will have a huge impact, and both your region and our region will suffer. Special attention must be paid to make silk factories aware of the dangers ahead and to make improvements." After receiving the information, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, believing that the matter concerned the future of the silk industry in various countries, invited sericulture experts to a meeting on the 27th of last month for an informal discussion. They all believed that the poor quality of cocoons was due to poor　manufacturing, and the sericulturalists' greed for profit was also an important reason. In addition,　manufacturers failed to reduce the price of inferior cocoons to make them aware, and poor management and labor disputes in silk factories led to affecting raw silk production. It was decided　that all parties should work together to save the situation. On one hand, the bureau will report the dangerous situation of raw silk foreign trade and the decided improvement methods to the Ministry of Industry for reference in improving the national silk industry. It is also heard that the Shanghai Raw Silk Exporters Association also plans to submit a list of all the issues to the Ministry of Industry and request their adoption and implementation.</p>
<h3>Appointment of Silk Cocoon Insurance Adjusters</h3>
<p>Every time silk factories in this city send staff with funds to the interior to make cocoons, they must insure against fire, water, theft, and other risks with Chinese and foreign insurance companies before. If an accident occurs, the insurance company must appoint a surveyor to assess the value of the damaged goods before compensating according to the discount. This surveyor is only selected unilaterally by the insurance company without seeking the consent of the insured party, which is unfair. Letters have been sent to trade associations requesting collective discussion and relief. Now, the silk factory associations of the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have sent a joint letter to the insurance association requesting that in the future, if an accident occurs, the selected surveyor must obtain the consent of the insured party before being appointed, so as to be fair.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Assigns Trainees from the Self-Government Training Institute for Internship</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government is very cautious in opening the Local Self-Government Training Institute for all facilities. The trainees in the first ordinary class, in addition to receiving direct training for three months to increase their knowledge, must also intern for three months to increase their experience. Now that the trainees have completed their studies, they have been assigned to different internships and have formulated provisional regulations for trainees' internships. The institute is scheduled to convene all trainees for a speech on the afternoon of the 4th of this month.</p>
<h3>Cai Zhengya Speaks on Recent Labor Issues in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its seventh luncheon discussion meeting at the Lianhua General Association yesterday afternoon. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Bureau, was invited to speak on the various aspects of labor-management cooperation. However, Mr. Pan went to Beijing for the National Assembly and entrusted Mr. Cai Zhengya to attend and deliver a speech on "Recent Labor Issues in Shanghai." Dr. Kong Yongzhi, Chairman of the Board, sent a telegram to the meeting because he could not come to Shanghai on official business. Therefore, the members present elected Mr. Pan Wenan as the chairman. After the meal, the chairman delivered an opening speech, and then Mr. Cai Zhengya stood up to speak. He divided the recent three-year labor situation in Shanghai into labor-management disputes, wages and working hours, and living expenses, and listed statistical figures for comparison and explanation. He said that the labor movement in Shanghai has gradually entered the right track after several years of turmoil and disputes. It is hoped that labor and management will be deeply aware and work together to increase the total amount of the national economy. Then, Honorary Secretary-General Cao Yunxiang spoke on the relationship between scientific management and labor-management issues, and the meeting adjourned at 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Two Women's Groups Jointly Hold a Labor Issues Research Conference</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA and the Shanghai Women's Association believe that female and child labor in modern industry has become a serious issue that should attract the attention of the community. Therefore, they held a labor issues research conference at the YWCA on Nanjing Road for the past three days. Mrs. Chang Ma served as chairman by rotation, and Ms. Deng Yuzhi, secretary of the Labor Department of the National Association of YWCAs, led the discussion. Various charts and graphs were displayed in the meeting place to show the situation of female and child labor in various places. Attendees included people from academic, commercial, medical, and family backgrounds, which was very grand at the time. The main points of the discussion over the past few days are briefly described below. Regarding the comparison of the number of male and female child laborers in Shanghai, working hours, and working conditions, Ms. Deng put forward the following points: 1. Number of workers: According to the Shanghai Municipal Social</p>
<p>Bureau's survey, there are 125,785 female workers (with textile workers accounting for the majority), accounting for 57% of all factory workers in Shanghai, 76,248 male workers, accounting for 34% of the total, and 20,637 child laborers, accounting for 9% of the total. 2. Working hours: According to the survey conducted by the Labor Department of the Shanghai YWCA, more than 22,000 of the more than 30,000 female workers work 11 to 12 hours a day. Most female workers only have two days off per month. Cotton mills work in two shifts, day and night, changing shifts every week. The day shift is from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and the night shift is from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM. 3. Wages: The average worker earns 6 jiao per day. According to the survey by the Ministry of Industry, workers in the 30 largest cities allocate 82.59% of their wages to food, clothing, and housing, and only 17.41% to education, entertainment, social relations, and illness. 4. The excessive working hours and poor working conditions have many harmful effects on female workers. A. Cutting off fingers, hair, and arms being caught in belts, resulting in permanent disability or immediate death. B. Due to poor air circulation, excessive humidity, and excessive dust, female workers in silk and cotton mills often suffer from lung and throat problems. 5. Affects the health of female workers and hinders the nurturing of strong children and healthy citizens. 6. Child labor under the age of 14 working in factories has the following results: A. They are not educated and grow up to be ignorant citizens. B. Without exercise and rest, they grow up to be unhealthy citizens. C. Child labor wages are too low, affecting adult workers' unemployment. Three major methods are proposed for solving the problem of female and child labor: 1. Employers voluntarily improve working hours and working conditions and run welfare programs. For example, Tiancheng Cotton Mill in Tianjin, the Shanghai Commercial Press, and Yongtai Mingfeng Silk Mill in Wuxi are all pioneers in voluntarily improving the working system, and the results are very good. 2. Workers organize and take collective action to put forward conditions for improvement to employers, but it is believed that effective worker movements must focus on worker education. 3. The government uses legislation to urge factories to improve working conditions, but whether the Factory Law can be implemented depends on the power of public opinion. Attendees all believed that women have a responsibility to promote public opinion on banning child labor and protecting female workers. They also believed that women, standing in the position of consumers, have the ability to improve the lives of female and child workers, but various social forces must be concentrated and unified to produce results. Therefore, it was decided to convene a joint meeting of representatives of women's groups in Shanghai at noon next Monday, May 4, to come up with concrete measures.</p>

<h3>The Story of China Donating a Pair of Stone Lions to an American University</h3>
<p>Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi, on behalf of the government, donated two stone lions to the University of Missouri. It has been reported in various newspapers that the university will hold a 20th anniversary celebration of the establishment of the School of Journalism this year, and various countries, including the United Kingdom and Japan, have donated valuable gifts. A year ago, the university specially sent Mr. Powell, the chief writer of the China Weekly Review, as a representative to the Chinese media and government to request a corresponding commemorative item, hoping to be given old stone objects. The Chinese government agreed to the request because the university people have given much support to the Chinese revolution and has trained many talents for the Chinese press. The government immediately sent people to Beijing and Shanghai to purchase and search for a satisfactory object, but it was difficult to find one for a long time. At the time, a pair of stone lions at Bao'en Temple in Beijing were being repaired. The Beijing Municipal Government stated that since the government needed to find stone objects to donate to the university, it could donate them. The National Government reported this to the National Government, which ordered Mr. Kong to transport the stone lions to the university on behalf of the government to promote China's inherent art. This is the story of what happened.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Provoke Chinese Police</h3>
<p>A Scene of Conflict on a Road Built Across the Border</p>
<p>Around 3:10 PM yesterday afternoon, police officer Zhang Gongwu of the Jingyi Lane Police Station of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau on Qiujiang Road was directing traffic at the guard post at 22 Xingjiazhaikou, Des Voeux Road. At the time, Japanese police officer No. 158 from the Harbin Road Police Station was also standing at the intersection, obstructing Zhang's duty. The police officer immediately politely asked the Japanese police officer to move away. Unexpectedly, due to a disagreement in words, the Japanese police officer suddenly used force and struck the Chinese police officer's head with a wooden stick, causing injury and bleeding, and then drew a gun to threaten him. Zhang knew that it was difficult to reason with the Japanese police officer, so he returned to the station to report to the police chief, who then reported to Director Tao. The director reported the facts to Director Chen, requesting him to negotiate with the police station to maintain police power.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Trial of Wang Zhenshi's Kidnappers</h3>
<p>▲Wang Spends 20,000 Yuan to Redeem Himself</p>
<p>▲Several Kidnappers Have Been Detained One After Another</p>
<p>▲The Bandits Used the Money to Enjoy Themselves</p>
<p>Wang Zhenshi, the owner of Wang Yutai Tea House, is a Western-style doctor with a clinic located at 411 Jing'an Temple Road, No. 2. On March 27th of this year, at 11:00 AM, several kidnappers, pretending to be sick and seeking treatment, broke into the clinic and kidnapped Wang, demanding a huge ransom. Eventually, his family</p>
<h3>Paid 20,000 Yuan to Redeem Him</h3>
<p>By the 16th of last month, the bandits were captured by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, Inspector Liu Shaokui, and Detective Tang Jian, detective Zhou Honglin, at Wang Gu's house at 222 Firewheel Mill Street and at the Crystal Palace on Zilaihuo Street. Three locals, Zhu Xiangsheng (also known as Amao), Xu Hongyi, and Gu Zhongfang, were arrested, along with Wang Gu. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the Special District Court for a brief interrogation the next morning to await investigation. Because the police station was</p>
<h3>Engaged in Strictly Hunting Down Fugitives</h3>
<p>Therefore, the details of the case were not published in the newspapers. The day before yesterday afternoon, the case was continued by the judge of the special court, Ge Tuishe. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, described the kidnapping of Wang Zhenshi in detail. He said that on that day, a kidnapper using the pseudonym Zhang Ya pretended to be ill and went to Wang's clinic. Before long, another bandit also came to the clinic seeking treatment. Then, the two bandits each took out</p>
<h3>Handgun to Wang's Chest</h3>
<p>Forcing [Wang] to come out and as he stepped out of the door, the bandits forcefully dragged Wang into a car parked at the entrance of the alley. This car was rented by the bandit gang from the Wah Sun Motor Company on Broadway. The company's driver, Tang Heshang, was driving. After the bandits forced Wang into the car, they drove Tang away and another bandit took over as the driver, speeding away. Later, Wang's family prepared 20,000 gold [dollars] to ransom him. On the day Wang was kidnapped, his younger brother Zhenhuan was also</p>
<h3>Kidnapped in the French Concession</h3>
<p>in the French Concession at nine o'clock in the morning. However, Zhenhuan managed to break free and avoid the disaster. It is still unclear whether the bandits who kidnapped Zhenhuan were the same as those in this case. The defendant Zhu Xiangsheng has already confessed to the police that there were four people who went to kidnap Zhenshi that day. The other three were Chen Silang, Yan Bingqing (also known as Bingwen), and the driver Zhou, all carrying handguns. The handguns were borrowed by Gu from someone surnamed Xu. Afterwards, Zhu received 1,200 yuan and Gu received 1,000 yuan. However, Xu Hongyi and Wang Gu's wife both denied being involved in the kidnapping. Then, Wang Zhenshi described the process of being kidnapped and ransomed.</p>
<h3>And Identified Zhu Xiangsheng</h3>
<p>as being present at the scene at the time. When [they] reached the bandits' den, Zhu was in charge of guarding the ticket. Furthermore, Wang's servant Chen Jilin testified that Zhu Xiangsheng came to the clinic that day dressed as a worker, with a sash tied around his waist like a skirt, holding a handgun and threatening me not to make a sound. Then, one of the bandits who had come to the clinic earlier dragged Doctor Wang out. At that time, there was still a bandit guarding the entrance. When questioned, Zhu Xiangsheng confessed that he went with Yan, Chen, and Zhou to kidnap [Wang]. Yan entered the house first, followed by me. However, this matter was initiated by Yan. Two months ago, it was decided in the Tangjiawan area of the French Concession and upstairs at Tai Zhou Restaurant. On that morning, [they] gathered at the Maison West Restaurant across from the New World.</p>
<h3>The Car was Rented by Yan</h3>
<p>and when they arrived at Wang's house, Yan and I went in one after the other. Chen was at the entrance of the alley and Zhou was in the car. After Wang was kidnapped, [they] drove to the intersection of Avenue Petain and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession and then took Wang out of the car into a nearby house. The house was also rented by Yan for 50 taels per month. [They] hid Wang on the upper floor in the front building. The four of us took turns guarding [him]. The writing of the ransom letters and other matters were all handled by Yan. After hiding [him] for about half a month, he was released after [we] received the ransom of 20,000 yuan. I received 1,200 yuan, but all of it was</p>
<h3>Spent on Merrymaking</h3>
<p>Leaving only a little over 100 yuan. At that time, there were four handguns in total, two of which belonged to Yan, one was provided by Zhou himself, and the remaining one was borrowed from Xu Hongyi. Wang Gu's wife only admitted to privately setting up a brothel. Xu Hongyi only said that he used to work with Gu at the French Concession Electricity Company and that is how they knew each other. This time, Gu and someone surnamed Chen came to borrow a handgun, so I introduced them to Xu Amei, the director of the former Water and Electricity Association, to borrow one. At that time, I only knew that they were borrowing the handgun to protect the transporters, not for kidnapping. Gu Zhongfang confessed that he and someone surnamed Chen borrowed the handgun from Xu Hongyi without denying anything else, generally claiming not to know anything. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Ge ordered the defendants to be returned to custody separately for a further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Dong Yu Accused by His Wife</h3>
<p>▲Requesting Confirmation of Identity and Payment of Alimony</p>
<p>▲The Judge Attempted Reconciliation but Failed</p>
<p>Lawyer Dong Yu was recently sued in the District Court by his wife, Jiang, for abandonment, requesting confirmation of identity and payment of 10,000 yuan in alimony. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shenglie, accompanied by Clerk Huang Jiyuan, took the bench in the Second Tribunal to hear the case. Both parties were present in court as summoned. First, the plaintiff, Jiang, testified that she was 33 years old, from Anhui, and resided at 705 Jinwenfang, Seymour Road. (Question) What is the object of the request? (Answer) Confirmation of identity and request for 10,000 yuan in alimony. (Question) How to confirm? (Answer) After the death of [his first wife] Lu, the defendant said that Lu was his first wife. If so, then what am I to him? Before, in the tenth year of the Republic [1921], after the engagement but before the marriage, I knew that Lu had written a letter questioning [our relationship]. The letter was mediated by the defendant's cousin, Dong Banggan, who produced a letter proving my identity. The defendant also wrote a letter recognizing me as his legal wife, so he married me. On September 23rd of last year, my mother's family had a happy event, so I returned to Ning [Ningbo]. When I returned that night, I was suddenly rejected by the defendant. Shortly after, I returned to Ning again. When I returned to my husband's house, the defendant did not allow me to return home, so I lived in the house of the defendant's uncle, Dong Kang. (Question) At that time, was Lu already dead? (Answer) Yes, she was dead. (Question) Do you want to go back now? (Answer) He mistreats me, gives me a small room to live in, and does not allow servants to give me food. (Question) Do you want 10,000 yuan for living expenses? (Answer) Yes, calculated for 20 years. (Question) Do you know how much property he has? (Answer) He has property, such as deposits in the bank, because he said that I caused Lu's death and refused to live with me. Next, the defendant, Dong Yu, testified that he was 38 years old, from Wujin, and resided at Xiafei Square, Avenue Joffre. In February of the tenth year of the Republic [1921], he married Lu, and in October of the same year, he married Jiang. As for the question of Jiang's identity, now that Lu is dead, Jiang has been promoted to the position of legal wife. The plaintiff's purpose is nothing more than money. (Question) Does he agree to cohabitation? (Answer) A few days ago, her maternal grandfather had come to talk about it, [and we] are still cohabitating, but he walked out eighteen years ago. (Question) Was it to marry off his younger brother? (Answer) No, he lived with another person near the Baiyun Temple outside the West Gate. At that time, someone tried to persuade him to come back, but he said that he would rather die than go back. Afterwards, he wrote a letter asking for 6,000 yuan for support. I did not agree to it, but the reason he went out was that he was unwilling to work at home. After Lu died, I very much hoped that he would take charge of the inner quarters and manage the household, but he went out every day, so quarrels inevitably occurred. The official said that people who both have identities should not be involved in litigation. It is better to reconcile and cohabitate in court. At this point in the questioning, Jiang said, "The defendant said that after Lu died, he promoted me to the position of legal wife, then I am clearly a concubine. He also said that I went out with someone, who exactly should be pointed out." The official said, "Husbands and wives have a duty to cohabitate. I advise you to still share a room." She answered, "If we cohabitate, my life will be in danger." The official said, "What danger is there?" Thereupon, the questioner repeatedly tried to enlighten the plaintiff, who steadfastly refused to comply. Reconciliation failed, so the debate began. The lawyer hired by the plaintiff began to state the case. The questioner considered it to be concluded and set the verdict for the afternoon of the fourth of this month.</p>
<h3>Fire in Houjiabang Kills a Woman</h3>
<p>Burning Down a Three-Story Building</p>
<p>Staircase Burned Through, Woman Dies Tragically</p>
<p>A three-story building at 74 Wujia Lane, Houjiabang, inside the Xiaodongmen, was rented by Sun Hesheng. Sun opened the Meili Sock Factory downstairs and sublet the second floor to Gu Haifan (36 years old) from Ningbo to open the Delong Ribbon Factory. The top floor was occupied by a policeman Zhou from the First Precinct of the Second District Public Security Bureau. Suddenly, at 3 a.m. on May 1, a fire broke out on the second floor and spread upwards and downwards. It was late at night when [people] noticed, and there was no way to put it out. The fire burst through the roof, and the flames were like a dragon. The North District Fire Brigade was the first to arrive by car, but the fire had already spread. Fire trucks from various districts arrived one after another and tried their best to extinguish the fire, which was finally extinguished at 4 a.m. A three-story building was burned down. When the fire was raging, the staircase connecting to the third floor was burned through. Zhou Yinshi (24 years old, from Shandong), who lived on the third floor, was unable to escape and burned to death. Yesterday, the body was retrieved and examined for cremation. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. However, the Delong Ribbon Factory had fire insurance of 8,000 taels, and the Meili Sock Factory had 500 taels.</p>
<h3>Second District Headquarters Arrests a Large Number of Bandits</h3>
<p>After the robbery of the Gongxing Meat Shop in Tangjiawan, Ximen, on the 17th of last month, Wang Zhijing, the district chief of the Second District Headquarters of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, paid close attention to this. He secretly ordered Cao Junda, the leader of the district's detective division, to solve the case within a time limit. Therefore, Leader Cao led the detectives to investigate and collect information. It is now learned that the district has arrested a large number of bandits. The investigation of the broken case is recorded as follows: At 4 p.m. on the 28th of last month, Detective Wang Tinggen of the district received a secret report from an informant that bandits would be coming from the concession in the evening to gather at Shangwen Road in Xiaoximen to commit robbery. He immediately reported to Leader Cao, who reported to District Chief Wang. District Chief Wang immediately ordered all detectives to go to the address to wait. After a while, a man was seen in a panic and went to a small teahouse there. He was immediately approached and arrested and taken back to the headquarters. According to the interrogation, his name was Sun Genrong and he had accomplices hiding in the Chunjiang Hotel. Leader Cao immediately led all the detectives to the French Concession to meet with the Chinese and foreign detectives of the French Concession Police and rushed to the hotel to arrest the main bandit Ma Pi A'gen (also known as Chen A'gen) and Fan Heshang. They were immediately taken back to the headquarters. At the same time, the detectives were left at the hotel to wait. Before long, they arrested the suspects Peng Quanfu and a woman, Wang Caidi, and took them to the headquarters together. After District Chief Wang interrogated them separately, Chen A'gen, also known as Ma Pi A'gen, confessed that he was 32 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at 34 Dongxinqiao Street. Each time he committed robbery with accomplices, all two handguns belonged to Wu Yi. The handguns were transported by Du Fuzhang. He also admitted that he had committed robbery with accomplices at the residence of a certain resident near the Commercial Press on Mount Lu, stealing more than 3,000 yuan, and at Zhang Heting's house at 54 Dongma Bridge on April 2, and at a certain surname's house in Fengyuli, Xinglu, and at the Xu surname's house in the factory lane on Xietu Road, Ximen, in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar last year, and at Gu Linsheng's house on Danfeng Road the year before last, five properties in total. After District Chief Wang obtained the confession, the next day he sent Leader Cao Junda, Wang Yangen, Wang Shuangxi, Chen Chunsheng, Zhu Songqing, Jin Yangsheng, and other detectives, together with the police officers sent from the Fifth District, to arrest Du Fuzhang at 1184 North Sichuan Road and Wu Yi at the South Railway Station and bring them to the headquarters together. After District Chief Wang interrogated them separately, Du Fuzhang confessed that he was 27 years old, from Xiashi, and lived at 62 Zhen'an Lane, Gonghe Road. He also had accomplices hiding in the Huashang Hotel at 24 in the Public Concession. I met Ma Pi A'gen when I was smoking in Shunyuli, French Concession, so I handed over the handgun to me for transportation. Wu Yi also confessed (also known as Fan Shi) (alias Zhu Lao Huizi), 33 years old, from Suzhou, and lived at 218 Avenue Dubail. He confessed that three people went to Tangjiawan, and all the other robberies admitted to being accomplices. All the handguns used were prepared and distributed by me for use. District Chief Wang then sent Leader Cao and others, together with the detectives sent by the Zhabei Police, to Huashang Hotel 24 to arrest the bandits Lu Xiuchang (also known as Lao Yangpan) and Jiang Quangen and bring them to the district for interrogation. Lu Xiuchang confessed that he was 37 years old, from Wuxi, and lived in Anfang 12, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession.</p>
<p>The handgun used was hidden upstairs in his house. He admitted to committing robbery with Ma Pi Chen A'gen and others. District Chief Wang then sent detectives, together with Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Police, to search the upstairs of Bao'anfang 12 and found a live bullet Branglin handgun, a Pom-style five-round handgun, and thirteen bullets. District Chief Wang believed that the case was serious and was still conducting a thorough investigation and planned to submit a document for explanation today.</p>

<h3>Housing Rent Dispute in Lizhongli</h3>
<p>▲Reasons for the Landlord's Rent Increase</p>
<p>▲The Presiding Judge Still Advised Reconciliation</p>
<p>The case of rent increase in Lizhongli houses on Feihong Road, Hongzhen, this city, has been mediated twice by the Rent Dispute Arbitration Committee organized by the Shanghai Municipal Government, which considered the landlord's rent increase of 30% to be very reasonable and ordered the tenants to cancel the illegal Tenants' Self-Government Association. The tenants, fearing rejection, suddenly withdrew the mediation. Recently, the tenant representatives of the neighborhood suddenly sued the landlord Chen Changkun in the Shanghai District Court, requesting confirmation of the validity of the contract. Presiding Judge Guo Shouyi of the Civil Tribunal summoned [both parties] once on the 28th of this month and ordered them to go out for reconciliation. The afternoon before yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. After Judge Guo took the bench, he ordered both parties to present evidence. The landlord Chen Changkun presented a list of tenants in arrears of rent, the amount, and a cost budget table, as well as a list of tenants who had already increased the rent by 30%. The plaintiff's lawyer Chen Honglai stated that the former landlord, Jukang Qianzhuang, allowed a temporary postponement of the rent increase, and the current landlord should not increase the rent because the previous contract continued to be valid. Then, the defendant's lawyer Zhou Xiaoan argued that the letter from Jukangzhuang only contained the phrase "it seems possible to postpone temporarily," and anyone with a little knowledge of the text knows that it is an empty and uncertain term. Since it was not determined, this contract cannot be valid, and the rent in Lizhongli was originally 20 yuan per building for shikumen and 16 yuan per building for Guangshi. After Shanghai was affiliated with the National Government, shikumen was reduced to 15 yuan and Guangshi was reduced to 12 yuan. Last year, the former landlord increased shikumen by one yuan per building, only 16 yuan, and Guangshi by 5 jiao, only 12 and a half yuan. This rent is lower than the nearby Yuezhoufang and Dongjun'anli. Now that gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and everything is expensive, and land prices are soaring, the defendant paid nearly 180,000 taels when purchasing this neighborhood's land last year. With the current low rent, it is not enough to cover the interest. Therefore, in addition to requesting the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit, [we] are also filing a counterclaim and requesting Lizhongli to increase the rent by 30%. After the rent increase, each shikumen building will only be 20 yuan and 4 jiao, which is still low compared to the rent in this city. [We] also request a judgment ordering the tenants to pay the arrears of rent and ordering [them] to vacate the house. Afterwards, Judge Guo advised both parties to reconcile: 1. From July 1, the rent will be increased by 2 yuan per building. 2. Sign a shorter contract. 3. Arrears of rent must be paid. Both parties complied with the instructions and went out to try to reconcile, and then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Xue's Son-in-Law Withdraws the Property Dispute Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Hua Lihou, the son-in-law of the deceased paint merchant Xue Yinrun, brought his two sons, Yiweng and Yigu, and daughter Manyun, hiring three lawyers, Zhang Jiahui, Ye Shaoying, and Yang Linzhi, to represent him in suing his mother-in-law Xue Sun, his brothers-in-law Xue Jing sheng, Yansheng, Jiasheng, Gensheng, etc., in the French Concession Civil Court for the occupation of the estate and failure to divide it. The previous reports have already noted that the defendants were ordered to personally surrender to the court for questioning. Yesterday, the defendants were again summoned and each complied with the order to appear in court. The plaintiff's lawyer suddenly submitted a petition requesting the withdrawal of the case. The defendants' representatives, lawyers Lin Yingqing and Wang Yintai, both stated that the plaintiff's side suddenly filed a lawsuit and suddenly requested a withdrawal. [We] should request the court to reject it and approve the counterclaim for the plaintiff's debt. Judge Gong ruled that since the case had not yet begun to be argued, the plaintiff's request for withdrawal was considered appropriate. [He] ruled that the plaintiff's request for withdrawal should be approved and that the defendant's request for a counterclaim should be filed separately.</p>
<h3>Two Counterfeit Money Organizations Cracked Down in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Zhang Xingwu from Shandong recently privately set up an organization for selling counterfeit money in Room 53, Oriental Apartments, Avenue Baille, French Concession. The French Concession Police Detective Bao found out about it and arrested Zhang at the place the day before yesterday, seizing 4,000 yuan of five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes and taking [him] into custody. Then, [they] found out that there was also a selling organization at 73 Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, and went to arrest Han Ronghua, seizing 20 counterfeit banknotes and more than 70 yuan in cash from [his] person. Afterwards, [they] successively apprehended suspects Liu Jizhang, Chen Qingchang, Liu Jianfeng, etc. and took them into custody. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Concession Court for questioning. First, the police chief reported the previous situation and presented the counterfeit banknotes for inspection. Zhang Xingwu confessed that the banknotes were entrusted to the people by someone surnamed Zhang who lived in the Nanjing Hotel to sell on his behalf, but the whereabouts of Zhang are unknown. Han Ronghua confessed that the people and Zhang Xingwu were friends and that Zhang Xingwu entrusted me to sell these counterfeit banknotes on his behalf. The rest of the confession was vague. When questioned, Liu Jizhang and others confessed that the people did not know about the private sale of banknotes. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Zhang Xingwu to three years in the Western Jail and Han Ronghua to two years. Liu Jizhang and the other three were released without charge. The counterfeit banknotes in the seized case were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Ye Chen Lawsuit Postponed for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>The case of Ye Zhongfang and dancer Chen Xiuzhen mutually suing each other in the French Concession Court was again summoned yesterday. Ye Zhongfang, Ye Peng, Ye Lu, etc. still did not appear in court. The acting lawyer Dong Yu stated that the plaintiff Ye Peng was visiting Ningbo with her daughter-in-law Lu because her aunt was ill, causing Zhongfang to experience mental stimulation and is now being treated in the hospital, so none of them could attend this time and requested a postponement for further examination. Chen Xiuzhen's representative, lawyer Yao Zhaodi, stated that the statements of the opposing counsel were probably untrue and that someone had recently seen Ye Zhongfang still going in and out of dance halls. The truth is that he intentionally evaded attendance. Judge Zhu ruled that Ye Zhongfang, Ye Peng, and Ye Lu should not have been summoned twice without attendance. Each should be fined 2 yuan and the hearing postponed for seven days for another summons.</p>
<h3>Due to Communist Suspicions, Cheng Yongxi Was Finally Transferred</h3>
<p>Cheng Yongxi from Anhui practiced medicine and hung his pot at 535 Baek Road. Last winter, the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned that he had previously served in Zhang Fakui's Communist army as a military doctor. In the winter of the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927], Zhang's army burned and killed the Cantonese city, and Cheng also worked in Guangzhou, so he was suspected of being a Communist. [The Bureau] jointly apprehended and sent [him] to the Special District Local Court, which ordered that he be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Because the police were dissatisfied, they filed an appeal and the extradition was not actually carried out. Recently, the Higher Branch Court revoked the preliminary hearing decision and returned it to the Special District Court for re-examination. On the 28th of last month, Judge Wu Tingqi re-examined the result and still ruled that [Cheng] should be taken by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. The police lawyer again requested that the execution be suspended during the appeal period, so although Cheng had been decided to be extradited twice, he was not finally extradited. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin specially declared to the original judge that the Public Works Bureau had decided to abandon the appeal in this case and that the inland officials could take [him] away. Judge Wu learned that Director Chen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau had sent Section Chief Ding Jun of the Third Section to the court to receive [him]. [He] then handed over Cheng [Yongxi] to Section Chief Ding in court and turned [him] over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. This case has been delayed for more than half a year and can be considered over.</p>
<h3>Handgun and Bullets Searched</h3>

According to Jiang, one handgun was bought in the fourteenth year of the Republic [1925] when he was a member of the Sixth Tunnel Security Corps for self-defense, and the other was found. Director You ruled that the case was related to the private possession of firearms and ordered [him] to be sent to the Bureau for interrogation and examination.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Orders the Hengda Yarn Factory to Resume Work Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲Awaiting the Authorities to Investigate and Verify</p>
<p>After the workers of the Hengda Yarn Factory in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, opposed the factory's transfer of workers and went on strike, the factory announced a temporary shutdown. The Municipal Social Bureau ordered the factory to resume work tomorrow and await verification. The various circumstances are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mediation Meeting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau convened a labor-capital question-and-answer session at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 1st) to conduct mediation. The representatives present were Zhang Sheng from the Municipal Citizen Training Association, Chen Zixing and Zhu Yufang from the capital side, and Zhang Qingyun and Qin A'fa from the labor side. The meeting was chaired by Zhu Guilin from the Social Bureau. The labor's demands were: 1. Resume work as soon as possible. 2. Punish the staff who abuse workers. 3. Release the innocent arrested workers. 4. Wages should be paid as usual during the shutdown period. The capital's demand was to dismiss the troublemaking workers. The chairman advised to resume work first and the rest to await investigation and verification. The capital representatives insisted on the order of General Manager Rong Zongjing to wait for the workers to fill in the guarantee before resuming work, so the problem was not solved.</p>
<h3>Order to Resume Work</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau ordered the Hengda Yarn Factory yesterday, saying that it had received the report. It was found that the factory should give priority to supplementing workers and that the factory should be responsible for the disturbance caused by the unwarranted placement of new workers. In addition to approving the workers to resume work and investigating and verifying the workers' insurance policy and other labor-capital disputes separately, you must comply with the order to resume work as usual on the 4th of this month without delay. This batch also orders the trade union to resume work uniformly.</p>
<h3>Changes After Arbitration of the Jinxin Factory Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>▲The Labor Side Petitions the Municipal Government to Submit It to the Court for Execution</p>
<p>The Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory on Avenue Saussier in the French Concession has been on strike for more than a month. After six mediations by the Social Bureau failed, it was submitted to arbitration for resolution and the resumption of work was scheduled for April 27. Unexpectedly, there were twists and turns on that day, extending to the resumption of work on May 1. Unexpectedly, another change occurred on the due date. The First Special District Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union Preparatory Committee's document to the Municipal Government is recorded as follows: The strike at Jinxin has been submitted to the court for execution after the arbitration decision by your government. The factory side has no sincerity at all and has been using excuses to delay and refuse to resume work. The loss fee was changed to the voluntary dissolution fee when a strike occurs in the future without authorization, and the workers are forced to sign, hoping to destroy the labor movement invisibly. However, the workers, most of whom are illiterate, almost fell into their trap. However, after going back and forth several times, not only was the fee not issued, but it was even claimed that the arbitration was overturned. Then, lawyer Lu Qi was entrusted to announce the calling of the board. Therefore, this is a special presentation. Please approve the submission to the court for prompt execution and warn the lawyer to benefit the labor movement (omitted below).</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "The Ministry of Industry has issued Instruction No. 829, stating that the Ministry is conducting a survey on the general conditions of commercial firms in various counties and cities domestically. Survey forms for the general conditions of commercial firms have been prepared and should be issued to the relevant departments in each province and city for distribution to the county governments or chambers of commerce. They should be filled out in detail with reference to the attached Provisional Classification Standards for Commercial Firms by Industry and submitted to the bureaus by the end of August this year, to be presented to the Ministry for statistical compilation.

The attached survey form specifies the following items: (A) Organization: (1) Sole proprietorship, (2) Partnership, (3) Unlimited liability company, (4) Limited partnership, (5) Limited liability company, (6) Joint-stock limited partnership, (7) Remarks. (B) Item: (1) Number of firms, (2) Total capital amount, (3) Number of employees, (4) Total business turnover last year. (C) Industry.

(2) The type of business should be filled in for each industry, and the names of each business can be adopted according to the Provisional Classification Standards for Commercial Firms by Industry. (3) Capital must be calculated in Chinese silver dollars; those calculated in non-Chinese silver dollars should be converted into Chinese silver dollars. (4) If there are several foreign firms within the number of firms in a certain industry, in addition to filling in the number of firms in the "Number of Firms in a Certain Industry" column, the number of foreign firms must also be noted in the "Remarks" column. For example, if there are ten partnerships in the art and craft sales industry in Shanghai, and two of them are operated by British and three by Germans, when filling out the form, not only should "10" be filled in the "Partnership" column of the art and craft sales industry, but also "Partnership: British 2, German 3" should be filled in the "Remarks" column.

<h3>Gao Linsheng Robbed and Extorted, Imprisoned for Eight Years</h3>
<p>▲The Murder Portion is Transferred to the Inland Court for Trial</p>
<p>Gao Linsheng, also known as Zhou Mulin, from Pudong, committed crimes in Shanghai. On March 16th of this year, he and his accomplices held weapons and robbed Wu Zicheng's house at No. 423, Ma Le Li, Chongqing Road, of property worth more than 790 yuan. Later, he sent a letter to Shen Liusheng, the owner of the Shen Tai Construction Factory on Ningbo Road, extorting 30,000 yuan. At that time, Shen urgently needed to go to Tianjin because he had contracted a project there, so he did not report the case to the police. Gao was arrested by the Yangshupu Police Station before he could continue to extort money. It was also found that Gao, in addition to robbery and extortion, was also involved in the assassination of water police officer Pang Gongyi. Yesterday afternoon, the police escorted the bandit to the Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Feng Shide interrogated him. According to the police lawyer Li Zhishan, the robbery case had been investigated with the victim present, and although the victim in the extortion case had gone to Tianjin, a representative was present to explain the process. It was heard that the accomplice Gu A'er had been captured in the Nanhui County assassination case and could be brought by the Public Security Bureau because the case occurred inland. Therefore, Tang Renqi, an employee of Shen Liusheng, testified that Shen received a threatening letter by post last month asking him to negotiate at the Oriental Hotel. Shen suspected that it was jealousy from his peers, but he did not receive a second letter and did not report the case to the police. The defendant fully admitted to the robbery and blamed his friend for dictating the threatening letter. He hesitated and stammered in his confession of the assassination. After investigation and trial, Magistrate Feng immediately sentenced Gao Linsheng to seven years in prison for carrying a weapon and committing armed robbery, and two years for attempted extortion, to be served concurrently for a total of eight years. The murder portion will be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for submission to the inland court for trial.</p>

<h3>Xinhua Launches Life Savings Deposit</h3>
<p>After the reorganization and opening of the Xinhua Trust and Savings Bank, it has been actively engaged in various trust and savings businesses. Recently, it launched a five-year life savings deposit, which started accepting deposits yesterday. The method is very novel. Five years is set as one term. People aged 16 to 60 with legitimate occupations can recognize deposits of three yuan per month. After five years, they can recover a principal and interest of 200 yuan. If an accident occurs in the middle, they can also receive a savings compensation of 200 yuan. The idea of combining insurance with savings is intended to benefit store employees, factory workers, and the general self-employed. In order to protect the safety of life savings depositors, the bank has specially allocated 100,000 yuan as a reserve fund to organize an inspection committee with transparent and independent accounting.</p>

<h3>German Military Officer Ink Sold at Original Price</h3>
<p>Since the wave of gold being expensive and silver being cheap has shaken the world, countries with silver standards have rarely escaped its severe impact. Not only has the price of various commodities been directly affected and soared, but also the spiritual and cultural development has been indirectly affected and become stagnant. The German Military Officer Brand Ink Store on Fifth Road West, Shanghai, has a long-standing reputation for selling German Military Officer Brand Ink in Shanghai and abroad. This is because this kind of military officer brand ink has bright colors and pure materials, which are completely different from the sticky, oily, and dull inferior goods. In recent months, the prices of all European, American, and Japanese inks have risen sharply. Only this store has not raised the price of military officer ink in order to compensate for the obstacles to printing and cultural development. The most commonly used ordinary red, blue, yellow, and white inks are now reduced in price again, with red and blue selling for only 8.5 jiao per pound and yellow and white for only 4.5 jiao per pound.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I read in your newspaper on the 25th of this month that the Jiangsu Higher Court sent personnel to tour and try cases of Red Bandits and bandits in various counties. After investigation, this court has legally designated the local court to send magistrates to participate in the temporary tribunals organized by the county governments to try these cases after the implementation of the Emergency Crime Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China. There is no such thing as sending personnel to tour and try cases of Red Bandits and bandits in various counties. The report in your newspaper is a rumor. I hereby inform you and hope you will check and publish this letter in the letter column to correct it.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Jiangsu Higher Court</p>
<p>April 28</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Chief Editor of Shenbao:</p>
<p>I recently read in the news column of your newspaper on April 28th that a retired soldier from Hunan, Hu Bin, ran out of money and was rescued after throwing himself into the Huangpu River. He has been sent to the local court for relief. I feel deeply saddened.</p>
<p>I have fought on the battlefield for many years and have experienced many hardships. I cannot help but shed tears of sympathy for the soldiers at the end of their road. Although I have a humble position and limited ability, I am still willing to sacrifice my salary to help the destitute. I believe that the compassionate chief editor also has a heart of compassion. Please forward this letter to the court or charitable organization to provide travel expenses so that he can quickly come to the Investigation Team of the Jinpu Railway Garrison Headquarters on Sanma Road, Xuzhou. I will arrange for him to fill a military position so that he can continue to serve the army and avoid the recurrence of world-weariness. This act of kindness will be bestowed by the chief editor.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Tong Chuanduo</p>
<p>April 29</p>

<h3>In Support of Good Wives and Wise Mothers</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Since the rise of non-filial piety arguments and the slogan to overthrow "good wives and wise mothers," informed individuals are worried. I believe that good wives and wise mothers are treasures of the nation. Not only should they not be overthrown, but there is a real need to support them. Moved by the conduct of my own two mothers throughout my life, I describe it to inform my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>One is Mother Zhang, the wife of Zhang Ziyun of Kunming in the same year. Ziyun was appointed magistrate through the imperial examinations, serving in Yongfeng, Jiangxi, and later transferred to Leping and Qingjiang. He was known for his integrity as an official. He passed away at the end of the Guangxu era, leaving behind a desolate family with many children. Mother Zhang supported the family and completed her husband's official duties. Later, when Jiangxi was restored and banditry arose, she could not return to her hometown tens of thousands of miles away. She led her children to the sea, enduring extreme hardship for thirty years. Her moral integrity was unwavering, and her actions were commonplace. I feel that while her ordinary conduct may not be suitable for grand praise, her hardship and integrity should not be forgotten. Recently, her two sons have completed their studies and are serving society. Mother Zhang wisely helped them choose good sons-in-law. One of them is the famous doctor Cai Jiping. Now, her eldest grandson, Naiyang, has graduated from Guanghua University and works in a bank. The family is happy and prosperous. My friend, if he knew in the afterlife, would not have lamented the impossibility of being an honest official. By this time, Mother Zhang had passed her sixtieth year and suffered from wind-dampness due to accumulated fatigue for five or six years. In the chaos of Hunan and Jiangxi, many families of gentry and officials were ruined, but the Zhang family prospered. Whose strength was this due to? The nation is an accumulation of families. If every family has a good wife and wise mother, then the nation will have nurtured men and educated women. Isn't this the most hard-working, most compassionate, formless yet spiritual public nursery?</p>
<p>The other is Mother Qian, the mother of my friend Qian Wenxuan of Guangde. In his early years, Qian Wenxuan was recommended by the Ministry of Education to study in England as a supervisor for overseas students. Later, he served as a consul in the United States, traveled around the globe, and attended international cultural and racial conferences, becoming well-known in diplomatic circles. After returning to China, he served as an official for a long time with a reputation for integrity and competence. In the eighth year of the Republic, he strenuously persuaded Tang Jiyao to abandon the Yunnan Doctrine and implement armed participation in the war. He traveled between Feng and Duan, seeking the unification of China, which nearly succeeded but ultimately failed. The telegrams are still preserved, excellent historical materials. He is considered a talented individual, and it is not just flattery. Qian Wenxuan's life story is particularly unique. His ancestors moved from Liyang to Guangde, where the clan numbered five hundred people, gradually dwindling. By the time Wenxuan was born, his father had died at the age of four, and the entire clan depended on him alone. This was indeed precarious. His mother, Dai Lizhi, upheld her integrity, raised her orphaned son, and endured all kinds of hardships to achieve what he is today. Now Wenxuan has four sons and one grandson. The middle son, Ruoyang and Ruojin, is especially lovable and capable of writing. Is the continuation of the Qian clan not due to Dai's efforts? It is regrettable that Mother Qian passed away before Wenxuan became famous. Official honors and posthumous recognition are all things that can only be done after death. For the son, there is the profound grief of sacrificing an ox to enjoy at her tomb. But for the mother, she would be content to have fulfilled her filial duty. Examining the laws of various countries regarding relatives, only Chinese parents bear absolute obligations without rights, yet stories of wise mothers are constantly written. Is this due to the effectiveness of laws or the merit of moral education? How can one deny and overthrow them?</p>
<h3>Puree Talk</h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Among the vegetables used to enrich meals in a timely manner, water shield (蓴菜) is now highly regarded. Water shield can be used to make soup, generally with tender bamboo shoots, shredded ham, and shredded fragrant mushrooms. It can also be cooked in chicken soup, which makes it especially delicious. Although water shield borrows the flavors of other ingredients, its smooth and slippery texture is unmatched by other dishes, so it has a unique flavor. Water shield grows in the lakes of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces; it is not produced elsewhere. Its leaves are green and oval-shaped, with long stalks and a sticky liquid on the back of the leaves. This is what makes it smooth and slippery when eaten. It is tenderest in the spring, blossoms in the summer (when it is not suitable for eating), and becomes tough in the autumn. During the Jin dynasty, Zhang Jiaying was an aide to the Prince of Qi. One day, seeing the autumn wind rise, he thought of the wild rice stems and water shield soup and bass he had back in his hometown of Wu, and he immediately ordered his carriage to return. Such a small matter of diet was enough to overcome his official aspirations. Also, Lu Ji visited Wang Ji, who pointed to sheep cheese and asked Lu, "What in Wu can match this?" Lu replied, "A thousand-mile water shield soup has not yet been served." At that time, it was considered a famous reply and an anecdote. The character "莼" is sometimes written as "蒓".</p>
<h3>The Blind Person with Unusual Sense of Smell</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Ears can hear sounds, eyes can distinguish colors, and the nose manages breathing and differentiates fragrances and odors. I have never heard of using the nose to replace the eyes. Looking at the blind in the past, those who use their ears to replace their eyes still cannot avoid the criticism of groping and probing. The nose is merely a breathing tube. Now, it can actually recognize objects and distinguish colors with infallible accuracy. This is truly an extraordinary and strange matter.</p>
<p>Wang Runian, a blind person in the city, was born blind. He has never personally seen the myriad things in society, but his sense of smell is extremely acute. He can identify any object he touches with his nose. The most unusual thing is that if there are several people present, he can identify each of them by smelling them, even if they remain silent. He has been tested repeatedly and the results are always accurate. Wang's sense of smell is truly extraordinary and beyond the reach of ordinary people. When people ask him what method he uses to distinguish between them, Wang says, "The skin and sweat glands of people have different smells. In the cold weather of winter, everyone produces little sweat, and I can only tell them apart by touching their skin. But in the summer, as soon as someone is ten steps away, I can tell who it is." My (the reporter's) friend Qian Xueming, who lives in Yancheng, once tried to make it difficult for him, so he took more than a dozen sheets of red and white paper, mixed them up on a table, and asked if he could distinguish the colors of the paper. Wang agreed readily, without any difficulty. He touched and smelled the paper and, within a few minutes, had separated the red paper from the white. At this time, Qian was extremely surprised and asked how he distinguished them. Wang said, "Colored paper has a different smell than colorless paper. It is not at all unusual for me to identify objects and colors by smell." When Mr. Qian told me about this, I was very surprised and said to Qian, "Although this blind man is blind in his eyes, he is not blind in his heart. His sense of smell is truly extraordinary and beyond the reach of ordinary people. But it is very strange to rely on smell to identify things and even to distinguish the colors of objects. The mystery within this is truly difficult for us to understand at this time."</p>
<h3>A Record of the Peonies in Ye Garden</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Those who have visited the Ye Garden in Jiangwan praise its pavilions, gardens, flowers, and trees as the best in the southeast. I have already written an article to record it. Recently, I heard that the peonies are in full bloom. I imagined that there were only three or four plants in the Agarwood Pavilion of the Immortal Spring Hall, because plants in the South are rare and not as easy to see as in the North, so I went to see them. When I entered the garden, I saw the mountain peaks, the water's edge, the rocks, and the roots of the trees arranged almost everywhere, probably numbering several thousand. The Yao Yellow, Wei Purple, brocade robes, and sandalwood hearts shone like a row of clouds, beautiful as displayed brocades. Some were deep red, some were pink clouds, some swayed in the wind, some drooped with dew, some curled up like phoenix tails, some were like orangutan lips, some were like a beauty's fresh makeup, and some were like Yang Guifei slightly drunk. Their red light, purple brilliance, rosy clusters, and cloud masses, with their unique postures and extraordinary appearances, truly deserve to overwhelm all the flowers and lead the way of the fragrant blossoms without shame. Therefore, I sighed in admiration. Peonies originally came from Luoyang, spread to Caozhou, and flourished in Yanjing. Now, times and situations have changed, and peonies will also move to better places. It is a pity that time was short and I did not have time to photograph the flowers. I returned and wrote this to tell people who are addicted to flowers to hurry up and take a look before the spring rain ruins them, the setting sun fades, and their dreams are scattered, and they are left facing the east wind with a broken heart.</p>
<h3>A Record of Reading Paintings at the Guanhai Art Society</h3>
<p>— Dan Shiyi</p>
<p>In early April, my friend Mr. Wu Lisheng came from the countryside to enjoy the fragrant flowers with me. Lisheng is also skilled in the arts and loves to explore calligraphy and painting. I had previously become acquainted with Mr. Zhao Anzhi of the Guanhai Society. Anzhi is skilled in the six principles of painting, learning from the Song and Yuan dynasty styles, with lofty ideas and magnificent colors. He has long enjoyed a great reputation, so we went together to visit him. The society's address is in Taoyuan Village. In the afternoon, we took a trip to the western suburbs. The green shade was like embroidery, and our hearts and minds were opened up. By the time we arrived at the gate, we saw the plaque written by Chu Minyi hanging there. We knocked on the door and Anzhi greeted us. We first admired the famous works hanging on the walls, many of which were ethereal works by people from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. We also examined the album leaves, with Zhao Zigu's paintings of peach blossoms being the most exquisite. Mr. Wu, who had long studied Anzhi's painting fame, requested to see his works, so he first showed us twelve album leaves imitating Song dynasty flower and bird paintings. The colors used were mostly made by the imperial palace and were not available to ordinary people. The workmanship was exquisite, lifelike and dazzling. We also saw four screen paintings imitating the works of Zhou Shaogu and Zhao Zigu, which had recently been brought back from overseas and were specially commissioned for the country's exposition, where they received excellent awards. Foreigners have always admired Chinese art, but they have always thought that Song and Yuan meticulous brushwork might not be known to outsiders. It is evident that the spread of national quintessence abroad depends on Anzhi. Gradually, we also reviewed Lin Baoshanzi's hand scrolls, etc. Chu Minyi, Wang Yiting, and other gentlemen all provided inscriptions. Mr. Wu then inquired about the source of his strength. Anzhi modestly said that he worked hard to learn and did not dare to take credit. We then inquired about his contact address. Anzhi said that he was not often in Shanghai. If there were any commissions, they could be forwarded through Mr. Wang Yunyi of the Banque de l'Indochine in the Bund, Shanghai. Mr. Wu thanked him for his hospitality and discussed issues such as the imitation of pigments. It was dusk when we left. I was very happy to have had the opportunity to see so many famous works, so I especially wrote this record.</p>
<p>Correction: In the title "Brief History of Zheng Zheneng, Inventor of Consecutive Rings," the character "發" (fā, invent) was mistakenly printed as "達" (dá, reach). This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of India (42)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>It was already late in the day when we returned to the rest room. Along the way, we bought various photos and there were many beggars, so we did not have time to give to everyone. We took a car back and the moon hung in the treetops, the lamplight reflecting off the water. The bright moon could be seen in the water. My jacket was quite cold. We returned to the rest area in Gaya Town. It was already eleven o'clock. I picked up some stones by the Mu Nu River. My companions and I drank its water, which was very sweet. The Buddha used to drink this water and became a Buddha. We also drank it. On this trip, I gained a lot of insights, so I wrote a poem to commemorate it. However, one thing is worth pondering: The Buddha traveled to the high peaks of the Himalayas and the boundless sea, but attained enlightenment in this small village. Is this accidental? Also, the Buddha sat facing east, gazing at the morning star, and attained perfect enlightenment. Is this the morning star in the East, or is it the star of his enlightened nature? I once fasted for seven days and suddenly one day, a fight broke out. I also saw a very bright starlight in my head, but this was not perfect enlightenment, which can be taken as a joke. The poem is as follows: Not dwelling by high mountains or the sea, a hill and a valley bring forth a heavenly man. The Saha world is full of Avatamsaka realms, realizing no birth is being an immortal. The traces of the shepherdess remain on the small slope, in those days, milk was offered to the Buddha. What need is there to speak of a ten-thousand-gold meal? Chickens and dogs all ascend to immortality and enter the Great Luo. The waters of the Bakusha River are clear and blue, small fish wag their tails and swim freely. When will sentient beings have the chance to be saved? Vainly in the Buddha's house, not yet free from birth. The ancient Bodhi tree is still swaying, how many times has it seen people become Buddhas? A pair of footprints can still be distinguished, here the Great Hero abandoned his charming lady. The Buddha faces west, facing east, the morning star shines on the true void above. The great and vast one can be a teacher, several courtyard flowers reflect the sun. I returned on a cold night after two hours, the slanting moon shining dimly through the forest. The Dharma assembly along the way is still flourishing, crowned with flower wreaths, transformed into affectionate beings. The Taoists here are half like opera singers, smearing their foreheads and wearing flower wreaths, and the singers listen quietly. In Buddha's time, it was also singing.</p>
<p>On the 24th, I got up early at 6 o'clock and took a car to Benares. We passed the river bridge to Benares. This river is the upper reaches of the Ganges River. The water is clear and pleasant. At the second station, Lawyer Mukherji and several others welcomed us to a Western woman's house. After resting and eating, the monks went to Sarnath. I stayed with Lawyer Mukherji at the home of Mr. Sen, an Indian. Mr. Sen is a wealthy merchant, 30 years old and single. He said that he wanted to go to the Himalayan mountains in the future. This is the Indian view of life. The room was decorated like a Japanese one, taking off one's shoes to enter. Short tables were used for writing. In winter, thick straw mats were laid. Many guests came. A secretary of a small king came to ask about the situation in China. Everyone was very happy because India very much hopes that China will be strong. A friend said, "I very much want to wear Chinese boots. If you wear British shoes or British goods, you will be torn apart." A certain lawyer wanted to marry a Chinese woman or said that Chinese was difficult to learn. I said it was not difficult. Being able to recognize three thousand characters allows you to read any book. The grammar is simple and not as clumsy as Western languages. The topics of speeches by scholars from various places were mostly about the revival of Eastern culture, recognizing the close relationship between Chinese and Indian cultures.</p>

<h3>Hawthorne's Detective Case: The Turn (2)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>He, who was the focus of the guests' attention, insisted on pestering me for a while, forcing me to dance, and then picking up a few difficult sentences from Shakespeare's plays and nagging me to explain them. For him, it was innocent and carefree, but in my position, to avoid misunderstandings among the general public, I had to be reserved. But there was no way to escape, so I felt a little embarrassed. Later, I was only a little freer when it came time to sit down. I originally wanted to sit for a while and then say goodbye and go back, because I was really worried about Peixin's condition. Unexpectedly, the table I joined was full of heavy drinkers. Although I held on to the principle of not fighting, my defense line was not strong and was finally breached by them. After several rounds of toasts, my alcohol tolerance had reached its limit. Because of past experiences, I did not want to step into drunkenness again, so I thought that outsmarting was better than fighting hard, so I slipped away quietly.</p>
<p>That night, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse. The warm southern wind blowing on my face was quite soothing. When I left, since I was sneaking away, I did not formally say goodbye, and Peixian did not see me off. At that time, the women's table had dispersed, but most of the dozen or so tables of male guests in the hall were still happily playing finger-guessing games. I also glanced at my neighboring table. My old friend Hawthorne was also nowhere to be seen. I knew that he often avoided ordinary social engagements. But this time, he actually came to celebrate in person because of my relationship with me. But since he had left before the end of the banquet, it could be seen that he also felt as impatient as I did.</p>
<p>I left the gate and walked slowly along the sidewalk on Huanghe Road. After those bursts of night wind, the heat on my face was indeed slightly reduced, but I still felt dizzy in my head, so I decided to walk back to exercise and allow the blood in my brain to circulate and descend. I walked to the corner of Huanghe Road and turned left into Qinghai Road. The carriages and horses that had been lined up there had all left, and there were no pedestrians to be seen. With one turn, one went from noise to quiet, and the scene changed. I couldn't help but think about the fate of life and the warmth and coldness of human relationships. There is only a difference of one turn. If Peixian's military position were to fall one day, then at the second celebration, the carriages and horses in front of the door would probably no longer be so crowded and lively.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Gold Market in the Past Two Days</h3>
<p>▲ The price fluctuated greatly on the 1st, ending with a continued rise. The day before yesterday, May 1st, was the World Labor Day commemoration, so the Japanese newspapers were closed. The gold market was quite good, but it fluctuated from time to time, hovering around 750 taels. In the end, it continued to rise by 5 taels and 1 mace, because Hengxing Sheng actively bought in. In addition to covering their shorts, they have turned long. Therefore, the market opened with a rise of 749 taels and 5 mace. The overseas silver market also fell, and foreign exchange was reduced by half a level, and the internal market was also tight. Later, it rose to 52 taels. Afterwards, due to large investors tending to sell, it turned sharply downward, and the atmosphere deteriorated sharply, falling 7 taels. In the afternoon, it fell to 42 taels, but speculators chased and bought, and it continued to peak, reaching 53 taels and 5 mace, closing at 52 taels and 3 mace, but the difference between the pre and post market was 11 taels and 5 mace.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday's reaction found a small drop of 7 taels. Yesterday, the 2nd, the price of gold weakened again, retreating into the 750 tael range, but there were no major changes, only fluctuating by a little over 5 taels. In the end, it fell back by more than 7 taels. Rumors continued to circulate, which was actually a reversal after several days of successive rises. There was not much trading in the market. As for overseas silver, there was a different trend: British fell and American rose, so the price of gold opened low. Later, there were slight twists and turns. Due to the shortage of remittance bills, at noon it was between 45 taels. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday, the market closed. Examining the state of the week, it was confusing and uncertain. The maximum price was 53 taels and 5 mace, and the minimum price was 28 taels and 9 mace, a swing of 24 taels and 6 mace. Counting all six days, it only rose by 4 taels, and large investors such as Hengxing had turned long. Specialized spot firms are short, and those hedging remittance bills are about to break even. Therefore, short orders are also gradually selling, and the amount of cash orders is not large. It is said that the opening price in early June fell by 3 taels and 8 mace, totaling 748 taels and 5 mace. Large silver bars have fallen by 3/16, forward 1/8, the price of silver has risen by 1/4, and private telegrams have also increased by 1/8, so the sentiment is downward. Then, Da Xing, Yongfeng, etc. all sold, and it fell from 49 taels to 6 taels, and HSBC sold British gold in June at 1325. Then it went back up by more than 2 taels due to Wanjing Shunli and short covering.

At 9:45, it was 4 taels and 5 mace. Afterwards, Fuyu, Dadecheng, etc. bought in and increased by 3 taels. Around 10 o'clock, it was 7 taels and 7 mace. Yu Da, Zhifeng Yong, etc. sold out, and it immediately fell back to 5 taels and 6-7 mace. Suddenly, Tian Yu, Yong Qian Changxiang, Zhifeng Yong, etc. bought in, and British gold seemed strong, so it was difficult to close at 1325, so at 10:20, it was 49 taels. By the time of the later Fuxing Yong, Tianfeng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Hengxing Yuan, etc., all had sold out. Also, recently, British gold banks have been mutually doing 25, and Datong and Zhengjin are doing current US dollars at 30.0...75. The price of gold is sluggish and tired, and it has fallen by more than 5 taels. There was a slight rebound of a little over 1 tael in between. At 11 o'clock, it was 43 taels and 5 mace. Afterwards, Hengxing Shunli Yuancheng Wanxing came in, and it only rose by 3 taels in 5-6 minutes, totaling 6 taels and 5 mace. Retailers sold out, and it fell back to 4 taels and 6-7 mace. Hengxing went back on the field and bought in. At 11:45, it was 7 taels and 2 mace. Yongfeng and Taichang sold out, and it fell again by more than 2 taels. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 44 taels and 7 mace. Compared to the previous day, it had fallen by 7 taels and 6 mace.

Among the fellow traders, Hengxing, Tian Yu Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, etc. were all buyers. Xinxing, Zhifeng Yong, Yongxing, Qian Changxiang, Yu Da, Fuxing Yong, Tong Taichang, Xi Changyong, Chengfeng Yong, etc. were all net sellers. Yu Mao Yong, Yuan Tai, Yuan Cheng, Fu Tai Heng, Fu Chang, Da De Cheng, etc. were in and out. Remittance bill hedging was only a small amount in and out. The Guangdong gang bought 4-500 orders, and the Dalian gang bought 14-500 orders, selling 4-500 orders.</p>
<p>The horse racing period is usually a half market for three days. Next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, due to the Spring Horse Racing season, domestic and foreign banks will follow the usual practice of closing for half a day. Therefore, the Gold Exchange will only be open for half a day in the morning for those three days, and the market will be closed in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>The Flourishing State of the Bond Market in the Last Two Days</h3>
<p>▲Fluctuations Unpredictable, Extreme Ups and Downs</p>
<p>▲Turnover of 50 Million in Two Days</p>
<p>Day One: May 1st. At the local Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the spot trading volume of various government bonds was only several thousand yuan. For forward trading, such as the 20-year Customs bonds, although bidding had started, no transactions occurred. Other bonds, such as Disbandment Bonds, 1929 Customs Bonds, 1929 Philanthropic Bonds, and 20-year Cigarette Bonds, etc., saw their markets become more prosperous than before, with bustling buying and selling. It is estimated that the total turnover in the morning and afternoon exceeded 26 million yuan, breaking the new record set on one day at the end of last month. As for the price trends of various bonds on this day, rumors frequently circulated in the South, causing anxiety in the market. Large amounts of buying and selling occurred among various trading groups, leading to dramatic price fluctuations. For example, in the morning session, due to strong buying, prices soared. 20-year Cigarette Bonds rose by about three and a half yuan, and others rose by two or three yuan. However, the situation in the afternoon session differed significantly, with selling pressure exceeding buying. Various bonds then plummeted, with the downward momentum no less intense than the morning's rise. As a result of the day's rise and fall, prices slightly decreased compared to the end of last month.</p>
<p>Day Two: On this day, although 20-year Customs forward trading had started, it was temporarily suspended due to excessive price fluctuations. The tense situation of other bonds remained unchanged from the previous day. Internal Disbandment Bonds experienced the largest fluctuations, resulting in the highest trading volume. Other bonds such as 20-year Cigarette Bonds, 1929 Customs Bonds, 1929 Philanthropic Bonds, and Disbandment Bonds remained bustling. In the first session alone, trading reached over 8.6 million yuan, and the second session saw over 7.7 million yuan. The afternoon situation showed no signs of diminishing, and the intensity of bond price fluctuations remained as high as in the morning session. Market sentiment became increasingly weak, with selling becoming more prevalent. Prices of various bonds plummeted, making the market even more tense than in the past few days, with fluctuations of two or three yuan. In the afternoon, the selling pressure intensified, and the supply-demand imbalance widened. 1929 Customs Bonds, 1929 Philanthropic Bonds for the next month, 20-year Cigarette Bonds, and Whole Six Bonds for May delivery all experienced sharp declines and trading halts. Other bonds also fell by more than three yuan, but trading was halted as it approached 6 PM. It is estimated that the total forward trading volume for the day still reached 23 to 24 million, while spot trading was only ten thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market is Declining Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yarn Market: The sharp decline in Shanghai caused rumors to spread in the market, weakening confidence. Buyers were panicked, and some bulls turned bearish. As a result, the market became increasingly weak. Sellers seized the opportunity to pressure the market, causing it to decline rapidly, resembling a river flowing downhill. However, one manufacturer vigorously purchased this month's yarn. Nevertheless, the prevailing trend was strong, and it was difficult to maintain independently. Spot yarn trading was reportedly sluggish, with various trading groups hesitant to act due to the adverse environment. In summary, the weakness in the global cotton market exerted pressure on the local market. Coupled with unsettling rumors, it was difficult to stabilize confidence. Therefore, large speculators shifted from bullish to bearish positions. The focus should be on the 152-153 tael range.</p>
<p>▲Man Biao Down Three to Four Taels: Man Biao opened in the morning session with a sharp drop in US cotton, causing panic. Bulls turned bearish, and prices for all months fell by two taels three qian to three taels. One manufacturer purchased this month's yarn, which fell by one tael one qian. The market sentiment remained weak in the afternoon, with many rumors circulating. Prices for all months fell by another one tael two qian six qian. The total trading volume for the day was 78,650 bales. The selling was led by Tianlong (5,700 bales), Rongxing (2,150 bales), Yufeng (2,150 bales), Yuda (1,350 bales), Yicheng (1,850 bales), and Dachang (1,900 bales). The buying was led by Heshen (1,050 bales), Hengde (1,200 bales), Shunda (1,850 bales), Changfeng (3,450 bales), and Yiyu (2,200 bales). The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Terrifying Downturn in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is in a disastrous state, with the sharp decline showing no signs of stopping. The continuous decline in US cotton has caused widespread panic. One major player has shifted from a bullish to a bearish position, and the market is showing signs of spiraling out of control. Spot cotton trading is sluggish, and Indian cotton is gradually entering Shanghai. Therefore, the majority are inclined to sell. The future hinges on the 55 tael mark and depends on the movements of US cotton.</p>
<p>▲Han Biao Plummets by More Than One Tael: Han Biao opened in the morning session with another 30-point drop in US cotton, leading to widespread fatigue. Prices fell by 7-8 qian to 1.1 taels. Prices fell by another 3-5 qian in the afternoon. The total trading volume was 136,200 dan. The selling was led by Tianlong (15,100 dan), Zhenda (2,500 dan), Yuda (4,000 dan), Yichang (4,100 dan), and Yiyu (2,500 dan). The buying was led by Yuda (4,200 dan), Gongtai (2,000 dan), Tongxing (4,100 dan), Changfeng (5,000 dan), Xinheng (3,900 dan), and Shenchang (3,500 dan).

<p>Grains</p>
<h3>Passenger Xian Rice Sales Slow in the Local Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the passenger Xian rice market saw a weakening trend due to the suspension of operations in the local market. Guangdong merchants also adopted a wait-and-see approach, so the total market only traded 123 packages, which were handled by the local market. There was no other buying or selling. Due to certain relationships, Guangdong merchants were even less interested. Northern merchants felt the market price was too high and did not inquire. However, various trading groups had an appetite for passenger glutinous rice, but due to a shortage of goods on the market, no transactions occurred.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Declines Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced a uniform decline in all forward months after opening in both the upper and lower markets. The trend was very unfavorable, and the market showed further signs of weakening. This was because there were many rumors in the market yesterday. The securities exchange was the first to be affected, and many external speculators sold off their positions. Additionally, Northern merchants and the local market made new large purchases of foreign flour. Although factories did not dump large quantities of foreign wheat, many floating sellers competed to sell, causing the market price to suffer a complete collapse. Closing prices were down 1.75 for this month, down 2 points for June and July, down 1.75 for August, and down 2 points for September and October.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Hit by Rumors</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was affected by floating short positions after opening. Japanese merchants actively sought spot wheat for purchase, and this month's price rose first, with forward months following suit. However, due to many rumors and wavering confidence among external players, and the continuous arrival of foreign wheat, brokers quietly profited, and the market quickly reversed. Closing prices were down 3 points for June and August, and down 2 points for other months.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Silk Market Sluggish for Two Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign firm silk market continued its sluggish trend in the past two days. Due to economic instability in overseas markets, silk factories were focusing on artificial silk to reduce costs, and natural silk factories were unable to sell their products. Silk telegrams did not arrive. In the past two days, only Jardine Matheson and others purchased 20 bales of Shanghai white silk, Nadier and others purchased 35 bales of Sichuan yellow silk, and New Cheong Shing and others purchased 15 bales of white silk. Prices were generally weak.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Spring Silkworms Damaged by Cold Rain</h3>
<p>▲The First Brood Completely Abandoned... The Condition of the Second Brood is Also Not Good</p>
<p>Farmers in various cities and villages in Shaoxing started to incubate silkworm eggs around the 10th of this month. Silkworms began to hatch successively after the 16th. However, the weather was extremely cold, and thunderstorms occurred during the first molt, causing silkworm diseases that resulted in the complete abandonment of the first brood. Silkworm farmers re-incubated a second batch of silkworm eggs, but the climate remained cold and rainy. Although the early silkworms have now entered the second molt, their development is unfavorable, and some have died. The condition is not good, and silkworm farmers are generally pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea Plummets Again and Again</h3>
<p>The local foreign firm tea market has been trending sparse lately, due to dwindling tea stocks. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson, Fu, and other firms purchased over 200 boxes of Zhenmei from Yong Gao. The selling price has fallen to 63-64 taels, which is another 7-8 taels lower than before. Tunxi and Ying County teas have also fallen by 2-3 taels. The market situation is quite pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Britain Levies Additional Import Tax on Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>A telegram from London states that the British government, in order to increase foreign tax revenue, intends to levy an additional penny on the import tax of Chinese tea. It is understood that the British practice has been to levy a tax rate of six pennies per dan of Chinese tea. Now, it is proposed to change the levy to seven and a half pennies. The British government has formally submitted this proposal to the upper and lower houses for review and approval, and it will be implemented soon. According to current calculations, this will increase the cost by an additional twenty-five taels of Chinese silver per dan of tea, which will significantly affect the trade between Chinese tea and Britain.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Green Tea Has Already Emerged</h3>
<p>Wenzhou new green tea has emerged on various mountain peaks in recent days. Tea farmers, persuaded by tea merchants, have started picking early. The tea leaves that have emerged are quite tender. However, tea factories in the region have suffered significant losses in recent years, with six or seven fewer factories compared to the past. Due to tight credit conditions, most are adopting a passive approach. Although countryside traders had initially agreed to a starting price of 30 yuan per dan for new teas, this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Qimen Tea Market Opens at the Highest Record Price</h3>
<p>Qimen black tea is generally considered to be best from the Western region, with the Southern region being slightly inferior. Last year, foreign merchants suddenly shifted their strategy, placing more emphasis on the Southern region. As a result, businesses in the Southern region gained more profits, while those in the Western region gained less. It is estimated that Qimen had the most successful black tea trade last year, while most other areas incurred losses. Therefore, this year, pawnshops are paying close attention to the Qimen tea market. Shanghai tea merchants and Qimen branches are also expanding the scope of their invitations and loans to Qimen tea merchants. The total amount loaned to Qimen businesses by various merchants is approximately one million yuan. Due to intense competition among tea merchants, tea farmers are raising mountain prices. Yesterday, the first batch released by tea farmers was priced from 100 yuan to 80 yuan per shipment. The cost of green tea leaves is over 200 yuan per dan, which is 30-40 yuan higher than before, representing the highest new record price for the Qimen tea market. Tea merchants are hesitant to purchase at these mountain prices and hope for lower prices to reduce costs. However, with market trends favoring higher prices, it is uncertain whether they will get their wish.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Planned Sugar Trading Quiet, Market Firm</h3>
<p>Taikoo Sugar Continues to Open Over 10,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market news from the production areas indicated that the current price of Cuban sugar had slightly increased by 3.125 compared to previous telegrams. New York sugar futures for September and December were down one point. The prices of current and futures Java sugar remained unchanged, with only May delivery down 1.35. The public exchange market was quiet due to the weekend, with little trading activity. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white was still priced at 10.05 taels. The buying and selling were slow and the trend was generally firm. The available supply of No. 20 medium white sugar was low. Sellers raised their asking prices, but buyers hesitated. Trading was generally quiet. The daily trading volume was also sparse. Sellers were mostly raising prices, but actual sales were slow, and buyers were even more hesitant, leading to a stalemate. N Mark was priced at 10.06 taels, SH Mark at 10.015 taels, YRO Mark at 9.95 taels, and YP Mark at 10.09 taels, with slight transactions. The market trend was generally firm. After opening 5,000 bags of Taikoo car sugar for May and June delivery the previous day, the company continued to sell the remaining stock and opened over 10,000 additional bags, but the market was unenthusiastic. The trading of brand name sugar was quiet. The available stock of domestic Huanggang Qing high-grade sugar was extremely scarce. Yesterday, Tong'an Company shipped 200 bags and asked for 8 taels. Most brokers were hesitant, resulting in no transactions.</p>
<p>Northern Goods</p>
<h3>A Batch of New Longkou Vermicelli Has Arrived</h3>
<p>▲Shortage of Goods Leads to Price Increase</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli: Spot market stocks have long been exhausted, and sales are active everywhere, leading to frequent inquiries. Recently, it was reported that the Yihe and Yusheng ships had transported a batch of new vermicelli from Yantai, totaling only 80 bags. The quality of the goods is excellent, and being the first arrival, they were immediately cleared through customs at a price of 21.5 taels. It is said that soybean prices are high in the production area this year, resulting in a reduction in output. Furthermore, the next batch of goods is not expected to arrive until the end of the month. Given the current active market conditions, a price increase is expected in the near future.</p>

<p>The Art World</p>
<h3>Painting and the Modern Spirit</h3>
<p>— Kang</p>
<p>The expression of art has two aspects: the vertical and the horizontal. The vertical descends from ancient history and legends, while the horizontal extends into the real life around us. In the current Chinese art scene, to discover a good work that possesses a modern spirit while not abandoning the beautiful legends of the past is as difficult as finding a spring in the desert. Many people therefore regard art as an ivory tower to escape the world, and in their works, they refuse to imbue them with their own real feelings towards the masses. The climate of the art world naturally becomes even more depressing and stifling. In recent years, due to domestic natural disasters and man-made calamities, as well as the chaos of war, people are too busy saving themselves to even inquire about art, which cannot satisfy hunger or provide warmth. Therefore, during this transitional period, the poverty of the Chinese art world is felt to be pitiful. However, there are also some who show some concern, while others are singing the high tune of "art for art's sake," seemingly completely unrelated to the hidden feelings and suffering of the people. The objective environment is ignored in their presence, making it even more difficult for artists in this situation to produce something that grasps the essence of the times.</p>
<p>This time, the Morning Light Art Society, with the spirit of opening up a barren land, has contributed a little bit of strength. The impact of this strength is an impression that we cannot erase: that is, from the vertical aspect, they can pay attention to the legends of their own nation, and from the horizontal aspect, they faithfully infuse their works with intense, brave, and tragic emotions. This is probably generally recognized.</p>
<p>We know that the tide of the times has surged to its highest point. The bloodshed of the May Thirtieth Movement created a vanguard for the national revolutionary history. People who were once wandering at the crossroads are now, due to the survival and competition of the nation, inevitably awakened. Their dreams of "art for art's sake" are shattered. Consequently, some who have recognized the true face of the times have joined the military to engage in actual struggle. The national revolution has gradually reached its final stage. The progress of the great era has clearly demarcated the boundary between the old and the new. The so-called tranquil and inactive life that artists once regarded as elegant has long been washed away by the flood-like tide. The world before us is a world where the entire nation rises up to struggle. The art that expresses the times is naturally no exception. On the one hand, in the withering garden, we see the leaves falling completely; on the other hand, we can see green filling the branches. In the temporary intersection of metabolism, artistic works that express national consciousness increasingly form the cutting edge of the times. The Morning Light Fifth Exhibition began to meet with people in society under such demands. Now, based on the analysis of the times and the transformation of our pace with the times, we are gradually seeing here that the output of this consciousness differs from that of other exhibitions.</p>
<p>Regarding the vertical aspect, there are folk legends. Legends are the product of experiential products. Due to different environmental relationships, each nation must have their different legends. China, known as the most outstanding and oldest nation, naturally has no shortage of legends from its ancestors, and they have been passed down to the people to this day. Our products related to this category include "The Sun Chariot," "Hou Yi Shooting the Sun," "Nüwa," "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," and "The Battle of Zhuolu," all of which are used as themes for the works as much as possible. In the painting "The Sun Chariot," we can also see the commonality of myths among nations. In ancient times, we had the legend of "Di Yu Yi He." However, this sun, which shines all over the world, can also be extracted from the Greek myth of Phaeton driving the sun chariot. It is said that the sun chariot fell in Africa and burned all their houses, and their bodies were scorched black, so they are always the color of charcoal ash. As for the legends about the relationship between the two sexes, there are also many in mythology. "Shooting the Sun" is an image of our ancient nation conquering nature. Hou Yi is said to be a brave and unparalleled man, and his wife Chang'e is also very beautiful. At that time, there were nine suns always arranged in the celestial bodies. Hou Yi used amazing strength to draw the bow and arrow and shoot one to illuminate the present sun. Second, Nüwa refined stones to mend the sky. This is because Nüwa saw that "the air in the sky was insufficient, so she refined colorful stones to fill the gaps..." As for the description of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, it is purely a symbol of the love between men and women in ancient rural areas, and it also contains the meaning of encouraging cultivation and weaving. The legend of war is the story of the Yellow Emperor fighting against Chi You. At that time, the Han people moved into the Central Plains and fought fiercely with Chi You, the leader of the Miao people, in the wilderness of Zhuolu. In addition to being strong and fierce, Chi You could also make fog to confuse the Yellow Emperor's army. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor invented the compass chariot and overcame Chi You. This can more fully express the progressive and courageous spirit of our ancient nation.</p>
<p>Regarding the horizontal aspect, there are national humiliation and the facts of national struggle. Let us now try to open our eyes and see if the facts before us are enough to make us</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>shocked and alarmed. The country is almost full of devastation as a result of years of warlord infighting, and it is again weighed down by the invasion of international imperial capitalism. A large China has almost been reduced to a semi-colonial status, which is even worse than that. The people, under successive tragedies, are also subjected to years of starvation. Those who do not die from bloodshed and bullets starve to death in ditches. The strong, however, take risks and become thieves and bandits. In the cities, there are also tragic incidents of humiliation. Anyone with a little feeling can make their heart ache for everything that is presented, especially in the seas where foreign forces are expanding. Because they are looking for a trading place, they do not hesitate to send many warships to transport strong military forces for protection. They run rampant at will in the concessions. Even the masters of this territory can only be trampled by others under the power of foreigners. May I ask, where did the tragedies occur? Isn't it in the concessions? Isn't every concession filled with foreign troops? In our products, this impression can be captured. In the "Shooting Range," they practice shooting there every day to prepare to attack us. This situation can be clearly seen. In addition, "What I Saw in Hongkou" blatantly highlights the Japanese imperialists. They display sharp armored vehicles there. The fierce gaze of the Japanese soldiers is always the same. When the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, the French imperialists built many iron gates at the junction of the French Concession. The work titled "Iron Gate" reminds us of the imperialists' hatred of the Chinese nation. These humiliating works give us a sharp stimulus.</p>
<p>Now let us inspect the suffering of the people in the country. They have been suffering for a long time under the iron hooves of the warlords, unable to live and unable to die. This is worth sighing for. However, after the revolutionary forces flooded the north and south of the Yangtze River, the wheels of the times have gradually pushed them to awaken. In this great period of change, there are of course many traumas. After the war, they are still unavoidable from freezing and starvation, and even displaced and homeless. This situation is very easy to find in northern China. When we look at the two works "Displacement" and "Disaster Victims," the poems chanted by the ancients, "The fields are desolate after the war, and family members are displaced on the roads" and "The vermilion gates reek of meat and wine, but the roads have frozen corpses," become more sad and poignant.</p>
<p>The suffering of the Chinese nation, according to the current situation, is truly unprecedented. Historically, even the Hong Yang Rebellion was not as tragic as the current Red Disaster. This belongs to the events in southern China. In the works such as "Impression of Changsha" and "Red Terror," we can feel a pressing atmosphere. Many people's lives and many magnificent buildings were destroyed in the outbreak of fire and blood. The state of terror and turmoil still makes people shudder when they think about it. Other depictions of national struggle include works such as "Wild Rose," "Female Propagandist," and "Crossing the Yellow River at Dawn," "Meeting in Zhengzhou," and other works as representatives. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the iron cavalry of the warlords wantonly roamed the provinces south of the Yangtze River, and the people were in deep water and scorching heat. The emotions of resistance had reached boiling point, especially the people of Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province. "Wild Rose" is the scene of the author capturing the people preparing to respond to the revolutionary army at that time. At that time, all the women used fierce emotions to encourage men to fight. The strong and healthy "Wild Rose" we saw is the typical of the women in that area. "Female Propagandist" is also a feeling of the female compatriots that the current national suffering is not only relying on the strength of men to completely achieve the victory of liberation. Therefore, their courage to participate in actual work is no less than that of Mulan in those years. As for the situation of the revolutionary army going out on expeditions, and the facts of the battles, we can realize the tension of military affairs in the war zone and the enthusiasm of the people's welcome in the misty "Crossing the Yellow River at Dawn" and the several works of "Meeting in Zhengzhou." Now, if you think about it a little bit, the blood wheels all over your body should also be boiling.</p>
<p>Therefore, these products not only have the description of grasping the cutting edge of the times, and the unique style and characteristics, but also give new life to art.</p>
<p>The Morning Light Art Exhibition was originally scheduled to close tomorrow. It is reported that the exhibition will be extended for three days until the 7th of this month. The venue is still at the Shanghai Art School at the intersection of Jiangwan Road and Tongji Road (Reporter's Note)</p>
