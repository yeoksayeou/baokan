<p>李仲公接任招商局以來對於江海營業上感有積極進行之計劃雖經軍運阻滯而於籌備擴充依然進行不輟對於長江一路更力圖發展近日以中央租用之船盡行放回各江輪可以先後復班於揚子江航業統盤籌計以上游缺乏之輪甚多脈絡不能貫通在業務上非第不能收聯絡指臂之效而且坐視大好航運爲外輪所得良覺可惜今則决定施行其大長江之計劃而促之實現亟將其擴充航路增添輪舶等種種設施分誌如後</p>
<p>增開溆瀘船　近年英日美各航商對川河航輪競爭至烈除重慶班輪之外咸增川河上流之宜賓綫係直赴瀘州溆</p>

<p>增添漢宜船　漢宜一路該局祗一快利輸行駛殊有貨多船少之感本年三北尚增兩船李總辦徇該路貨客之要求已經議定將温州班輪廣濟號從本月中旬起派赴漢口專行宜昌班而滬温綫内則將嘉禾輪補代並調南華班船廣利輪接替嘉禾之福州航路</p>
<p>擴充湘河綫　湖南已無匪踪米棉礦砂桐油等業在大批運出外輪紛紛增班而該局之湘潭長沙一路内自去年經李雲良租用利源一船後始有兩輪行駛今猶覺不敷支配茲擬再添一船業今李雲良在漢租輪擴充又湘西之常德一路因匪久停今則匪已肅淸可以通航該局亦議定在湘西添闢一新航綫已令營業科擬具辦法</p>
<p>剏行直航班　現在太古怡和日淸捷江各洋商輪均有上海赴宜昌之直航船招商局在上年即提議開航滬宜直行班旋以軍運船缺未能實現今則各船已經放行該局已在計議將江大江靖兩輪開行上海漢口至宜昌直放班次不久可以施行另擬一路長江直放南北洋船即係上海赴漢再自漢返滬後逕開烟津及汕厦粤之兩路此項特殊班現時各公司尚無行駛一經開航可免轉口之勞該局初擬以新豐公平二船行駛此江海直放綫嗣因海船太缺不敷分布須俟所購之各海輪到來方可開行</p>

<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>愛國女學創辦已三十年資格最老自去年遷居江灣路新校舍後更積極擴充努力改進現正添築風雨操塲辦公室敎室宿舍並於校園内疊石爲山闕地爲池花木繁榮桃李成陰將來發達未可限量近又請得褚民誼先生爲校董特於上月之二十八日過午三點在校開歡迎會並請褚先生講演演辭甚長不及備錄特將其中饒有趣味之點摘出以實本談</p>
<p>▲聽講與回家　是日適爲星期六過午無課學生或回家或訪友或購物行裝備矣校中特下臨時戒嚴除有特别事故者不得出校於是没奈何只得在校聽講</p>
<p>▲唐僧與喇嘛　三時半矣褚先生始來精神奕奕首御扁而中凹之黑帽或曰似唐僧或曰似西藏之喇嘛</p>
<p>▲玫瑰與亂草　褚先生講中國雖有四百兆人民而不識字者太多其原因由於女學不發達子女在家庭中無識字之機會且人之優劣由於先天者半由於後天者半適檯上置有玫瑰紙花乃取以爲喻先天佳者猶種子良後天佳者猶植地肥二者俱佳始有美花若父母無知識無敎育已是種子不良旣生子女又不敎育直成一把亂草而已四萬萬同胞有三萬萬是亂草中國如何不糟</p>
<p>▲父過與母過　敎養子女爲國民應盡之職優良子女俱應由父母親自敎養不</p>
<p>可託諸傭媪之手設無力養無力敎最好是不生三字經有言養不敎父之過今可增加一句曰生不養母之過</p>
<p>▲筷子與洗手　欲求優良子弟非注意家庭敎育養成良好習慣不可對於兒童一舉一動俱須注意加以校正否則習慣旣成終身難改即如持筷小時不注意竟有成人後亦不得法者中國用筷可謂最便且以用故則吃飯時可以不洗手以手與所食之物不發生直接關係也（按南方食米則可北方食饅首則非直接</p>
<p>用手不可）西洋原來用手後乃用叉且食麫包非直接用手不可故必須養成飯前洗手之習慣</p>
<p>▲早安與晚安　禮節問題亦極重要無論同學師生見面必須招呼西洋在家庭間早安晚安在兒童時代即行學起與感情方面大有關係</p>
<p>▲王道與霸道　現在學校之運動多係舶來品如田徑賽足球籃球非失之激烈即失之消費且非有廣塲多人不可非盡人可能至於國技温柔儉省任人可習且少流弊西法多爲霸道國技多爲王道</p>
<p>▲運動與定義　運之定義暢行血脈動之定義爲活動筋骨</p>
<p>▲太極拳與太極操　太極拳爲拳家内功極有益於人之健康惟太複雜一般人多不耐習因取其意爲太極操簡單明瞭可以用書本說明且動作不繁易於記憶無論老幼均可練習</p>
<p>▲學生與先生　講畢同赴操塲先由體育科學生表演國技次由褚先生表演太極操及太極拳表演旣畢褚先生於鼓掌聲中頷首微笑而去</p>
<h3 id="c198">愛的方式 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 苗子</p>
<p>在中國的舊小說裏所寫的愛情男子是賈寳玉式女子便是林黛玉式或者男子是方卿式女子便是陳翠娥式總而言之男子要女性化才能博得女子的傾愛女子自然更要弱不禁風才格外使人憐愛</p>
<p>但是沈醉在西方美人的心目中的男子像漫郎攝實戈一小說中的葛理煜騎士一樣是雄武的英爽的表演得出男性的特有的偉大的從中世紀一直到現在那種峨冠佩劍的武士雖然已成爲歷史上的人物而餘風未替一般運動明星以至於奮鬥的戰士依然留得他們無上的光榮而常給幽默的愛情以熱烈的燃料</p>
<p>再從電影上看在西方不論是范倫鐵諾是柯爾門是雷門諾伐羅是却爾斯福雷是却爾斯羅傑有百分之九十的愛情片中的男方角是一個英雄或者他們都以爲這樣才表現得出「愛的生命之力」來</p>
<p>在中國却不然了雖然中國電影片的作風不同但我看過許多愛情片裏面的男主角竟常是一個富家公子或是一個文學家藝術家所以有人說中國的卡門是决不會愛上鬥牛的力士的這句話很有幾分可信</p>
<p>但是時代的輪是在滾向力之高峯那種柔弱的愛的描寫顯然已失去了他的生命的剌激了從電影來說幾許蕪雜不堪的武俠影片雖然也很有剌激的力量而可惜已失去了時代的精神現在我們所期望的祗是那種跳出矯揉造作的圈子之外的有精神有力量的撞擊愛和力的撞擊</p>
<p>在這裏我不能不喜歡看最近一張國產影片「三箭之愛」的成功那是明星影片公司的出品裏面雖不是把現代做背景雖富有超乎現代的精神而片中的男女兩主角又全是我們理想中的典型的英雄這是一定能夠給與我們以新的剌激的在我們看了這一張新片裏所描寫的愛的方式以後</p>

<h3 id="e22">The Earthquake in Nicaragua <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Among the world's major earthquakes in recent years, apart from Japan, the most serious tragedy is the devastation of the entire city of Nicaragua in Central America. The U.S. Navy has done its best to provide relief, and the U.S. President and Secretary of State are extremely concerned about all relief and emergency methods, which stem from both benevolence and a sense of obligation. Nicaragua is a relatively large country among the small countries of Central America, located between Honduras and Costa Rica, and is also a country that the United States has been actively managing. After Nicaragua and the United States signed a loan treaty in 1916, Nicaragua ceded its customs duties, banks, and railway rights to the United States, and allowed the United States to build a canal across the Nicaraguan Strait. The Gulf of Fonseca was made a U.S. naval port, effectively placing Nicaragua under its protection. Therefore, it naturally pays special attention to Nicaragua's natural disasters and personnel changes. In 1926, the Nicaraguan Liberal Party incident occurred, and a revolution once took place. The United States helped the Nicaraguan government to quell it. The following year, the United States sent troops to Nicaragua to help maintain security, with a maximum of 5,000 troops stationed there for two years. It was only after the internal rebellion was quelled last year that it agreed to gradually withdraw the Marine Corps responsible for patrolling, leaving a portion of troops to protect American expatriates. Therefore, the U.S. Navy was able to quickly provide relief due to the sudden earthquake in Nicaragua today. According to a Washington report, after the Nicaraguan earthquake, various parties again began to argue about the issue of continuing to dig the canal. This canal runs parallel to the Panama Canal, and the commercial traffic between the United States and the countries of Central America and all the changes in the situation are very significant. After the United States obtained the right to build the canal, it had already sent personnel to survey and prepare for construction, which shows the urgency and effort of its management of Central America, and its relief and assistance for the Nicaraguan disaster will naturally not be slightly delayed.</p>

<p>American Troops Assist in Rescuing Victims</p>
<p>Capital City Now a Large Rubble Field</p>
<p>Flames Still Burning Everywhere</p>
<p>Casualty Numbers Impossible to Ascertain</p>
<p>Reuters, Managua, 1st Day: Food and medical supplies are lacking, and the suffering of the victims is increasing. Many victims are sifting through the ashes to find their belongings or relatives. American sailors and Nicaraguan troops are working diligently to put out the fires, but the lack of water is a major obstacle. The United States has dispatched twenty army aircraft from Panama and several more from Miami to rescue the 175 American women and children currently gathered in Managua. The aircraft carrier USS Lexington has dispatched three large aircraft carrying naval medical officers and medicine, which are expected to arrive in Managua tonight.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st Day: Foreign Secretary Henderson stated in the House of Commons today that the British Embassy in Managua is in danger of being destroyed by fire, but there have been no reports of British casualties. The Nicaraguan envoy to Britain told reporters that there are approximately one hundred British residents in Managua, but most live outside the city in houses built of wood and mud, which are less likely to be severely damaged by earthquakes.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 1st Day: Since suffering a major earthquake, the President of Nicaragua, Hindenburg, has sent a telegram of condolence. According to recent reports, no Germans have died in the disaster, but the German consulate building has been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Nicaraguan Capital, 1st Day: Weak earthquakes continue to occur here from time to time, increasing public panic. At present, the entire city is like a large rubble field, with no buildings undamaged. Flames are still burning everywhere. The number of casualties is impossible to ascertain due to the extreme chaos throughout the city. Some estimate over six hundred, while others claim up to one thousand. There are thousands of injured. Nicaraguan military police, American Marines, and volunteers from various countries are currently working separately to put out fires, provide food, and care for the injured, and are also trying to restore order. The first American officer to arrive has telegraphed his government that all American women and children in distress must leave immediately to avoid the spread of epidemics. Personnel from the American Red Cross are currently setting up food distribution centers and temporary hospitals with the army and navy to provide relief.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Nicaraguan Capital, 1st Day: The fire continues to burn tonight. The flames have reached the Congress building. Rescue workers are busy burying bodies outside the city because of the risk of epidemics, and they must bury them quickly, so they cannot identify the names of the deceased. The train to Corinto has already departed, transporting food to the capital on one hand and refugees on the other. However, food is still scarce and must be transported multiple times to ensure that everyone gets fed. Four American naval aircraft arrived this afternoon, carrying four doctors, three nurses, four hundred pounds of medicine, and twelve hundred pounds of beans. Eight more aircraft will arrive tomorrow morning with supplies. This has slightly calmed the people. Refugees are leaving the capital on foot or by oxcart in an endless stream.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Washington, 1st Day: President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson sent a telegram to the Nicaraguan government today to express condolences for the earthquake. American officials advocate for the rapid departure of American citizens from the disaster area to prevent the spread of epidemics, and will use American warships to transport American citizens and citizens of other countries. The American Red Cross has already launched a large-scale fundraising effort. Furthermore, the issue of whether the United States should continue to fund the construction of a canal in Nicaragua has been revived today due to the earthquake, sparking heated debates.</p>

<p>Reuters, Paris, 1st Day: The debate over the French budget for 1931-1932 lasted almost three days and was finally passed by both houses this afternoon. Since Sunday, the bill has shuttled between the two houses, and finally agreed upon clauses that both houses could accept. The members of the Chamber of Deputies did not return home for two nights. The Prime Minister had no choice but to repeatedly declare that this was a matter of confidence in order to promote the passage of the bill. The bill contains revenue of 50,643,485,395 francs and expenditure of 50,640,509,352 francs, with an estimated surplus of three million francs.</p>

<p>French Ship's Bow Pierced</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st Day: The British aircraft carrier HMS Courageous (22,500 tons) collided with the French merchant ship Florida (1,900 tons) in the fog outside Gibraltar at 8 PM tonight.

The French ship is now being towed by the British warship to the Spanish port of Málaga, sixty-five miles northeast of Gibraltar. The British warship had seventeen aircraft, which were soaring in the sky when the two ships collided and were unable to return to the warship. It then went directly to the Málaga airfield. Spanish authorities allowed them to land. It has been found that four cases of British warship collisions have occurred in the past month. This is the fifth time.</p>
<h3 id="e73">German National Socialist Party Suffers a Blow <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Frick Resigns as Interior Minister of Thuringia</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 1st Day: Frick, the Interior Minister of Thuringia, Germany, has made Thuringia a stronghold of the National Socialist Party during his one year in office and has issued orders in favor of the National Socialist Party to oppose the central government. Today, the state parliament's coalition of the Nationalist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party voted to pass a motion of no confidence in the Interior Minister. Frick immediately resigned. The prestige of the National Socialist Party has now suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 1st Day: A major change has occurred in German domestic politics, namely the sudden loss of power of the National Socialist Party in Thuringia. The reason is that the German Nationalist Party suddenly broke away from the National Socialist Party and joined the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, and the Democratic Party to unanimously pass the impeachment of Interior Minister Frick and Minister Söchler. Both are members of the National Socialist Party, and Frick occupies an important position in the party. The National Socialist Party's control of power in Thuringia almost led to a major conflict. This time it has collapsed. According to the Nationalist Party leader's announcement, the reason for breaking away from the National Socialist Party is due to the party's noisy political demonstrations on the Sabbath and the agitation of schools with party politics.</p>

However, the cabinet feels that the government's current position and its ability to maintain security are extremely stable, so it wants to take a short rest during Easter. All miscellaneous matters will be temporarily handled by Defense Minister Gröner.</p>

This measure will not greatly affect the number of immigrants to the United States and can make Asians feel good.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 1st Day: London rubber prices fell to three and three-quarters pence per pound today, the lowest record in recent times. The average price last year was five and fifteen-sixteenths pence, and the average price the year before was five and one-quarter pence. The main reason for the continued decline in rubber prices is excessive reserves, weak demand, and a renewed economic downturn in New York City.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st Day: Labor MP Wyatt asked the Minister of Transport in the House of Commons today to take advantage of the low rubber prices to propose that streets near urban hospitals be paved with rubber. The Minister of Transport replied that rubber paving prices are still relatively high. It is best for local officials to decide on this matter.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 1st Day: The Ministry of Finance recently released foreign trade figures for the first three months of this year, showing that Japan is still in an economic downturn. Exports totaled 293,000,000 yuan, compared to 400,000,000 yuan in the same period last year. Imports totaled 330,000,000 yuan, compared to 525,000,000 yuan in the same period last year.

<p>Guomin News Agency, Vienna, 1st Day: The Austrian government announced today that the trade agreements previously concluded with Hungary and Yugoslavia will be abolished on July 1st. Commentators say that this is actually a precursor to Austria concluding a treaty with these two countries similar to the German-Austrian tax treaty. The unofficial exchange of views between Austria and these two countries regarding the tax treaty has long been openly disclosed by various newspapers, so Austria's current actions are not surprising to Hungary and Yugoslavia. Furthermore, the Austrian government's move precisely proves that the conclusion of the customs agreement between Germany and Austria does not restrict the benefits of the two countries directly involved, but rather seeks to implement the plans of the Geneva and Paris conferences in order to realize the ideal of a pan-European alliance.</p>

Huang's representative, Xia Wei, has arrived in Nanning for two weeks. Recently, Li Zongren and others have sent representative Huang Yansheng to Hong Kong to meet with Huang Shaoxiong to discuss the Guangxi peace situation, which has shown signs of dawn again. Chief of Staff Chen Shiye of the General Headquarters has traveled from Hong Kong to Shanghai and arrived in Nanjing to report to Commander-in-Chief Jiang on the opinions of both sides and the peaceful resolution of the Guangxi situation. Recently, in order to promote peace, Huang Shaoxiong has sent his confidants Gong Jieyuan and Huang Weifang and others to return to Wuzhou to prepare for the establishment of the Guangxi Post-War Supervisory Office. If the office is formally established, there will be no problems with the Li, Zhang, and Bai sides. As for the Nanning situation, since Huang's representative Xia Wei arrived, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have also been dealing with him. Li Zongren and others still need to discuss the peace issue with the officers in Liuzhou. Therefore, Li, Bai, and Xia traveled to Liuzhou on the 18th to discuss the matter with Yang Tenghui and Huang Xuchu and others. When Li, Xia, and others passed through Binyang, they held a review of the troops and the local militia. The current Guangxi army has limited strength, but the militia is actively training. Bai Chongxi is personally serving as the commander-in-chief, with Liang Hansong as the second. There are currently over 12,000 militiamen in Guangxi. The organization is based on counties, with each county forming three teams of 150 men each. Each county has a militia commander, totaling 28 commanders.

<h3 id="e90">He Yingqin Reports on the Military Progress in Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Telegram: Minister He Yingqin reported on the key points of the military progress in suppressing bandits at the weekly memorial service at the Office of the Generalissimo yesterday: (1) The military progress in suppressing bandits has been very rapid this past week. In eastern Jiangxi, our Ruan division had a fierce battle with the Red bandits' Fang and Shao factions near Geyuan and Luoyang Pass in Yihuang on the 27th. The officers and soldiers fought bravely and defeated a larger force with a smaller one, killing 500-600 bandits and seizing many guns. The main force of the bandits has been almost completely annihilated and will not be difficult to destroy. In southern Jiangxi, Mao Zedong and Zhu De had disagreements due to unequal distribution of spoils. Recently, Huang Gonglue and Peng Dehuai sent people to Changsha to surrender to Chairman He, offering their elderly mothers and wives as hostages. He immediately sent Huang's uncle, Huang Hanxiang, to Jiangxi to handle all matters of pacification. (2) Recently, many documents of the communist bandits' puppet government have been seized, including those concerning extortion: (A) Raising funds: In addition to each unit of Red bandits being able to raise funds freely at any time and place, the Jiangxi Soviet must raise at least 1.2 million yuan, the western Jiangxi area must raise another 600,000 yuan, the southern Jiangxi area 400,000 yuan, and the eastern Jiangxi area 200,000 yuan. The method of raising funds is to confiscate all public property and implement progressive taxation from top to bottom, with economic centralization. (B) Confiscation of land: All land is confiscated by the Soviets and distributed as follows: 1. Political instructors; 2. Those who have served as Red Army officers for more than three years. (C) Collection of military supplies: 1. Each village shall fully prepare matchlocks, homemade cannons, muskets, gunpowder, sulfur, and iron bars; 2. Each village shall distribute and deliver Red Army uniforms by a deadline, otherwise they will be shot; 3. Each village Soviet must pay 130 dan of rice, 250 jin of oil, and 700 jin of salt to the Red Army supply station every month, in two and three installments, respectively; 4. According to the previous principle, another progressive tax will be levied. Those who have not been taxed must send two sheng of rice per person; 5. All grains from farmers, except for self-consumption, must be handed over. Those who hide them will have their entire family killed. (D) Collection of paulownia wood, tea oil, and coal. (E) The county Soviets shall notify all districts to send all cash books, receipts, etc., to the county Soviet. Those who do not comply will be severely punished. This shows one aspect of how the communist bandits exert all their efforts to extort and commit all kinds of evil deeds. (March 30)</p>

<p>Jinan Telegram: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, pays great attention to the rebuilding of the Confucius Forest and Temple in Qufu. He has sent people to survey and estimate that it will cost more than 1.1 million yuan. During his recent inspection of southern Shandong, Han resided in the Confucius residence and visited the forest and temple in person. He sent a telegram to the provincial government the other day, urging the initiation of fundraising. The telegram, signed by all members of the Shandong Provincial Government, Han Fuqu, etc., was sent out immediately, inviting Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Vice Commander-in-Chief Zhang, Cai Yuanpei, Shao Lizi, Li Shizeng, Zhang Fang, Liu Zhenhua, Li Jinglin, He Chunjiang, Wang Yiting, Jiang Bocheng, etc., to be listed as fundraising initiators. The text of the telegram is as follows: "The Confucius Forest and Temple in Qufu are related to the national outlook, and for more than two thousand years, the country has tried to protect them and allocated funds for construction, so they have valued culture and lasted for a long time. However, in last year's war, Qufu was in the line of fire, and the Confucius Forest and Temple were damaged by artillery fire. Those who pass through that area cannot help but feel sad when they see the ritual vessels and sigh at the palace walls. It is urgently necessary to find ways to repair them to restore their original appearance. However, the project is huge, and the provincial treasury is empty. It is really impossible to rebuild it alone. It is planned to use the power of the masses to raise funds for construction, purchase materials, and repair them as soon as possible to comfort the thoughts of looking up to the high mountains and to conform to the purpose of preserving ancient sites. This matter concerns the cultural relics of China, and it is hoped that you will agree. In addition to telegraphing Commander-in-Chief Jiang and Deputy Director Zhang to take the lead in initiating fundraising, it is planned to list your titles in the circular telegram. This telegram is specifically for your attention."</p>

The funds for repayment of principal and interest will come from the two-tenths surtax on land taxes, road fees, and road business surplus. The issuance period is set from July 1 to September 30 of this year, with a real interest rate of six percent per annum, and the denominations are divided into five types: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. The principal repayment period is set to start in the sixth year after the fundraising, and the principal will be repaid in two lottery drawings each year for ten years. The provincial government will establish a fund management committee, with one representative each from the provincial government, the Civil Affairs Department, the Finance Department, the Education Department, the Construction Department, the Fuzhou Bank Group, the Xiamen Bank Group, the Fuzhou General Chamber of Commerce, and the Xiamen General Chamber of Commerce as members. The land tax surcharge and road business surplus designated as funds for repayment of principal and interest will be allocated to the committee monthly for safekeeping to ensure timely payment of principal and interest. However, the 3 million yuan of local post-war bonds issued by the provincial government in the 17th year were only drawn once, and no subsequent meetings were held. The fund management committee also dissolved itself because the funds designated by the authorities for repayment of principal and interest were diverted to other uses, making it impossible to manage and take responsibility. This has greatly damaged social credibility, so it is difficult to predict whether the issuance of road bonds this time will be smooth. (March 30)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Anhui Province Abolishes Salt and Rice Surtaxes <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Telegram: Anhui Province has always had extremely difficult finances. Finance directors who also served as finance commissioners were able to transfer national taxes to balance the budget, but the rest were stretched thin and unable to cope. Government expenses were in arrears. Last year, when Chen Diaoyuan resumed his administration of Anhui, he specially ordered the Finance Department to establish a budget compilation and review committee to compile the budget for the 19th year. It was established after repeated reductions. The total revenue and expenditure were both insufficient by more than 4.7 million yuan. In addition, the actual tax revenue was only 80% due to the impact of bandit disasters, and the actual shortfall was about 6 million yuan. It was proposed to levy surtaxes on salt and rice to make up for the shortfall. The salt surtax in Anhui Province began during the time of Ni Sichong's administration of Anhui. At that time, it was only levied in the counties in central Anhui. This time, the Huai salt and Lu salt in northern Anhui and the Zhejiang salt in southern Anhui were all levied. The bureau in northern Anhui was located in Bengbu, and the bureau in southern Anhui was located in Tunxi. It was estimated that the annual revenue would be more than 2 million yuan. Recently, the central government has repeatedly ordered the abolition of the surtax, and the bureau in northern Anhui has begun to close down. Duan Shizhang, the director of the collection bureau in northern Anhui, did not collect a single cent due to opposition from merchants. Shen Mingxin, the director of the collection bureau in southern Anhui, was good at dealing with people, and the amount collected was only 10,000 yuan. The rice surtax of six cents per stone has been strongly opposed by the people of Anhui since its implementation. The Bengbu and Huaiyuan rice surtax inspection offices have been repeatedly destroyed. Bengbu has even evolved into a strike. Wuhu also followed suit. After mediation by the Bengbu and Wuhu Public Security Bureaus, business resumed. The provincial government's 138th meeting has decided to abolish the surtax and establish a grain management bureau after the abolition of the rice surtax inspection office to regulate surpluses and deficits. The provincial treasury will inevitably be greatly affected after these two sources of income are stopped. The new finance director, Liu Pengyi, is deeply concerned about the financial difficulties and has been struggling. The period from March to September every year is the most difficult time. He asked Chen Diaoyuan to go to Nanjing to ask the central government to allocate 400,000 yuan from the national tax revenue every month. The central government only agreed to 100,000 yuan. After Chen repeatedly pleaded, Chairman Jiang agreed to subsidize military expenses by 100,000 yuan per month from the Generalissimo's headquarters. However, the provincial treasury is still short. Liu Pengyi has gone to Nanjing to complain to the Ministry of Finance. (April 2)</p>

<p>Shenyang Telegram: The Northeast Five Provinces District Party Steering Committee and Party Affairs Commissioners were sworn into office on the 26th. At the same time, the Liaoning Provincial Party Headquarters was also announced. Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhang Jinghui, Wan Fulin, and others attended the joint meeting of the party committee on the afternoon of the inauguration. Due to time constraints, only the inauguration telegram and declaration were issued. The plan for the party's work and the organization of the party headquarters were not discussed. However, the most important task at present is to make the people's organizations sound so that the National Assembly representatives can be elected on schedule. The National Assembly is not far away. Wu Tiecheng must return to the capital before the deadline, so he is scheduled to leave Shenyang on April 1 or 2 with his entourage to guide the organization of the party headquarters in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Hebei provinces. He plans to stay in each of the three provinces for a few days and return to Shenyang before April 15. After a short stay, he will go to Beiping and then to Rehe for inspection. Finally, he will go to Chahar to represent the Central Government and supervise Liu Yifei's supplementary oath of office. After the event, he will return to the capital to report. Wu has sent his secretary Zhang Zhenxi to stay in Shenyang to handle correspondence and instructed him to report the work in Shenyang to the Central Government. It is reported that Wu's trip has not only completed the party's mission but has also achieved satisfactory results in other incidental tasks. (March 29)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Chambers of Commerce of Various Counties in Jiangsu Province Hold Second Discussion on Business Tax <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, based on the opinions of the provincial government, plans to imitate the Zhejiang Province's contract system for business tax. It will call representatives from various county chambers of commerce to the province to discuss the issue. The first joint meeting was held at 3 p.m. one day. Eighty-nine representatives from 52 chambers of commerce, including Wuxi, attended. Yu Xiaochuan of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce was elected as the temporary chairman. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the provincial treasury in Jiangsu Province is extremely tight after the abolition of likin and urgently needs to be replenished. Therefore, the levying of business tax is an urgent matter. However, the provincial government plans to have various county chambers of commerce contract to handle the tax. This can save the provincial government all expenses of setting up collection bureaus, and the chambers of commerce can avoid all disturbances. The provincial government drafted several contract conditions and submitted them for agreement. The conditions are divided into seven points: (1) The business tax in Jiangsu Province shall be contracted by the chambers of commerce. The total tax amount shall be allocated to each county chamber of commerce according to the amount of business in each county. The county chambers of commerce shall then allocate the tax to each industry association and non-member businesses according to the two standards of business volume and capital amount. The total amount shall be collected and paid to each county chamber of commerce, but it shall not be contracted in the name of a private individual. (2) After the establishment of the business tax contracted by the county chambers of commerce, all business tax collection agencies in each county shall be abolished to avoid disturbances. (3) The total amount of business tax in the province shall be 4 million yuan as stipulated in the budget, with 10% or 400,000 yuan set aside as collection expenses for each chamber of commerce, and the actual amount paid shall be 3.6 million yuan per year. (4) After the contract is signed, a three-month tax payment of 900,000 yuan shall be paid in advance as a deposit. Subsequent monthly payments shall be 300,000 yuan. The payment for the previous month shall not exceed the 5th of the next month. (5) When the chambers of commerce collect payments from various industries, if there are arrears or non-payments, the county government may assist in collection. (6) The starting month for the contract shall be discussed by both parties, or the advance deposit of 900,000 yuan shall be used as the tax payment for January, February, and March, and shall not be returned thereafter. (7) The broker's tax and slaughter tax are designated for education and shall be handled according to the original plan and shall not be included in the contracted scope. After discussion by the representatives, it was decided that levying the tax before the tax rate is fundamentally resolved is not the right time. This plan should be temporarily reserved and studied after the tax rate is determined. It was also resolved to continue to petition the central and provincial governments based on the principles decided at the previous meeting in order to achieve the goal of revising the tax rate.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 11 a.m. on the second day and resolved: (1) The business certificate is a certificate issued by the state to the people for paying taxes and there is no reason to order the people to purchase and affix stamp duties. (2) The collection period shall be four times a year, once every three months. (3) Request to amend Article 10 of the provincial regulations: "If a businessman fails to pay the tax amount for more than one month, a late payment penalty of 20% shall be charged. If the payment is overdue for more than two months, a penalty of 10% shall be charged. If the payment is overdue for more than three months, a penalty of 30% shall be charged. If the payment is still not paid, it shall be submitted to the review committee for resolution and punishment." (4) All goods that have already been taxed at special rates shall be exempt from business tax. (5) Fang Weiyi, Dai Boqiu, Jiang Kesheng, and 13 others were elected as petition representatives and scheduled to petition in Nanjing on the third day. (6) The central government has repeatedly ordered that all taxes paid by the people must be approved by the Central Political Committee and the final review of the Legislative Yuan before they can be established. Although the Jiangsu Province's business tax regulations have been revised by the Ministry of Finance, they have not yet gone through the legal procedures, but the provincial government is preparing to collect them. It should be submitted to the Yuan and Ministry to stop it, and the provincial government should be requested to postpone the collection until the tax rate is determined. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce was instructed to draft a document and submit it to the Yuan and Ministry, and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Bribery Case of Public Security Bureau Staff: The County Public Security Bureau previously received a letter from the County Court reporting a letter of Zhu Jiaxing, a soil peddler, requesting the arrest of Director Shen. Director Shen sent a staff member of the Supervision Department to lead a team to search. A large amount of opium was found at Gu Qingsheng's home. A certain Jia from the local area approached and offered more than 400 yuan, so the wife of the non-smoker, Gu Chen, was arrested and sent to Songjiang, and the amount of opium was reduced. The case was transferred to the County Court for investigation. Now that this bribery case has been reported, Director Shen has begun to investigate how to punish the offenders, but no decision has been made yet.</p>
<p>Cooperative Guidance Center Begins Operation: The county's cooperative instructors were previously appointed by the Agricultural and Mining Department to organize the guidance center and issued a memorandum to the county for distribution.

The total amount of donations received was 7,735 yuan, and the expenses were 9,146 yuan, which was insufficient by 1,411 yuan. It was resolved that County Chief Tian Jin would donate 120 yuan, and the district chiefs, the property department, the charity board, the first district office, the finance bureau, and the east and west grain counters would all separately increase their contributions to make up for the deficit. The county government will compile a clear record of income and expenditure and distribute it to each donor for verification.</p>

<p>Water Conservancy Association Assists in Building a Long Dyke in the Lake: The east and west mountains in Taihu Lake in the county stand opposite each other, and transportation is impossible without boats. Therefore, lake bandits have occupied Mingwan and other places, harassing travelers. When the troops rush to suppress the bandits, they flee and it is impossible to catch them. During the county-wide administrative meeting last winter, Zhu Liang, the district chief of the 19th district in the West Mountain, proposed to build a long dike to connect the two mountains so that travelers would not be in danger and the police team could easily capture the bandits. The plan was passed and a plan was prepared, passing through the West Mountain, the Big and Small Turtle Mountains, and reaching the Lutang Town on the East Back Mountain, which is more than ten miles long. County Chief Huang sent a letter to the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Committee for verification. The Water Conservancy Committee replied that the construction of a long dike may hinder water conservancy and did not express approval. Subsequently, District Chief Zhu of the 19th District submitted a supplementary plan, considering both water conservancy and transportation. County Chief Huang sent a letter to the Water Conservancy Committee. The committee replied yesterday that the plan was still feasible and agreed to assist. After County Chief Huang approved the letter, he ordered the Construction Bureau to be responsible for actively designing it so that it could be built as soon as possible to benefit the people of the east and west mountains.</p>
<p>Mediation of Labor-Capital Disputes in the Incense Industry: Labor-capital disputes in the Wu County incense industry have been unresolved for several years. Since the capital side was ordered to reorganize the trade association last year, it has issued notices, but the labor side's trade union has not been able to integrate with the capital side. At the end of last month, the trade union requested the capital side to improve treatment and submitted a request to the county government for assistance, expressing laziness. County Chief Huang submitted the request to the Construction Department for verification. Yesterday (the 2nd), the Construction Department issued instructions to organize a mediation committee immediately. After receiving the order, County Chief Huang appointed Qian Tianpeng, the director of the Construction Bureau, Xu Woyun, a member of the county government, and Shi Junqing, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, as members of the mediation committee to carry out mediation.</p>
<p>Blood Case Caused by Love Affair Between Nun and Butcher: The Yuantong Nunnery near the Shanren Bridge in Mudu, a county town, adopted Yun Sheng, the three-year-old daughter of Chen Jinfu, a farmer in the village, as a young nun in 1915. She is now 19 years old and is quite beautiful. In the winter of the year before last, she was seduced by Xu Er, a sheep butcher from the same village, and Yun Sheng planned to grow her hair and make a lifelong agreement with Xu. Last year, Yun Sheng suddenly abandoned Xu Er and had an affair with the monks Xin Bao and Yun Kui of the nearby Sudun Temple. Xu Er found out about the affair and went to the Yuantong Nunnery with a sheep-slaughtering knife hidden in his home on the night before last. He went straight into the inner room and saw the two monks Xin Bao and Yun Kui inside, and a conflict broke out. The monks escaped. At that time, Xu Er was furious and stabbed Yun Sheng's legs twice before escaping. Afterwards, Yun Sheng's father reported the incident to the Mudu Public Security Fifth Branch Bureau. Director Zhang ordered the police to arrest Xu Er. Yesterday, he, Yun Sheng, Chen Jinfu, and others were sent to the city and transferred to the Public Security Bureau. Zhang asked Xu Er for questioning. According to Xu Er, he had been having an affair with Yun Sheng for as many as 150 times and pointed out the secret marks on Yun Sheng's private parts. After receiving the confession, Zhang transferred the case to the local court for verification.</p>

<p>Actively Expanding Long-Distance Telephone Service in Nine Counties</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Electricity Management Office connected long-distance telephone service in nine counties in January of this year, business has been very slow, with monthly revenue of only about 60 yuan. The reason is the inconvenience of making calls, as the service only allows exchanges to communicate with each other. If the exchange is far away, the multiple transfers lead to many errors. Affected by this, the long-distance telephone service in the nine counties has not been able to develop. Recently, Deng Zaichen, the director of the Electricity Management Office, recognizing this, advocated connecting the telephone exchange in the exchange to the trunk lines of the Wuxi Telephone Company, so that callers can directly communicate with the destination, and the business scope can be expanded. He came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to discuss with Mao Feng, the director of the Construction Bureau, and the telephone company. The result was a decision to connect the poles and wires of the Wuxi four-township telephone east line to the Su-Chang line of the nine-county long-distance telephone service of the Electricity Management Office, and to connect the exchange telephone of the Su-Chang line to the telephone company. The Electricity Management Office also ordered a 30-line exchange from a Shanghai foreign firm. It has already been shipped from Shanghai to Wuxi, and the electrical materials have also been prepared, ready for immediate installation, and additional operators will be assigned to expand the business after connecting with the telephone company. Director Deng also sent Ruan Fengxiang, a staff member of the First Section, to Wuxi to investigate and negotiate the wiring issues with all parties. In order to universally install telephones in the four townships, the local Construction Bureau specially appointed Mr. Qian as the director of telephone engineering to be actively responsible for the project.</p>
<p>Bloody Tragedy at Lequan Bathhouse</p>
<p>The Lequan Bathhouse on Wanqian Road in this town has been very successful since its opening and has been quite profitable. Hui A’da paid 150 yuan to the manager, Xie Shaojing, to lease the special room in the bathhouse. Recently, Xie recommended his friend Xue Rongrui to work in the special room, in order to replace Hui A’da. After Rongrui entered the bathhouse, he relied on the power of Manager Xie and used various improper means to force Hui A’da to hand over all the items in the room one by one. Hui refused, and Xue harbored resentment. Yesterday (the 2nd) at 1:00 PM, Xue Rongrui went to the bathhouse to argue with Hui A’da. During the argument, they got into a fight. Xue Rongrui became angry and took a sharp knife and stabbed Hui A’da in the forehead three times in a row. Hui immediately fell to the ground unconscious in a pool of blood. The police at the scene sent the injured Hui A’da to the Rendeq Hospital on Jiaoji Road for treatment. At the same time, the assailant Xue Rongrui was arrested and sent to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau to be transferred to the General Bureau for delivery to the County Court to await legal questioning.</p>

<p>Night Boat Robbed En Route</p>
<p>A night boat from Dangkou Town in Nanyan City travels between the city and the countryside every day. The day before yesterday at about 7:00 PM, the boat owner Yang Jinhai directed the boatman to set sail from the countryside to the city. While passing through Sushe Dang, they suddenly encountered a boat. Seven bandits jumped out of the boat with wooden sticks and iron bars, ordering them to stop the boat. They then jumped onto the boat one after another, threatening them into silence and looting at will for about two hours. They then jumped back to their original boat with their loot and sped away. The boat owner and passengers, seeing that the bandits had gone far away, checked their losses. Passengers had been robbed of more than 120 yuan, more than 80 yuan in entrusted goods, and clothing, for a total loss of more than 300 yuan. The boatmen then reported to the Seventh Branch of the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the police be sent to pursue the stolen goods.

<p>Firefighting Conflict on Tonghui Road</p>
<p>More than 20 thatched sheds behind the first platform on Tonghui Road outside Guangfu Gate in this town suddenly caught fire the day before yesterday. When the fire was raging, members of the Eleventh Section of the Northern Road Security Fire Brigade rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. However, when they arrived at the Gongyun Bridge, they were beaten indiscriminately by members of the Twelfth Section of the Northern Road Fire Brigade with weapons.

<p>Strike at Wansheng Iron Factory</p>
<p>The Wuyi Wansheng and Housheng Iron Factories have a total of more than 100 workers. Yesterday (April 1st) happened to be the time when the factory implemented a 10-hour workday. Workers Liu Xingsheng of the Wansheng Factory and Worker Wang of the Housheng Factory came out to oppose it. The day before, they had secretly met with workers from both factories at the City God Temple, intending to incite a strike. The factory learned of this and, fearing that it would cause a storm, summoned all the workers to the factory to persuade them to work as usual when work began on the morning of the 1st. At the same time, they asked the Public Security Bureau to send a pistol team to the factory to maintain order. However, five workers, including Liu Xingsheng and apprentice Wang Kunsheng of the Wansheng Factory, were still inciting a strike in the factory and, in the meantime, contacted the Housheng Factory to take united action. The manager of the factory, Wan Guoping, seeing the tense situation, discussed the matter with Team Leader Xu of the pistol team and others and took the workers Liu Xingsheng, apprentice Wang Kunsheng, and others to the bureau for temporary custody. However, three other apprentices, including Ding Yongzhao, escaped over the wall and secretly conspired with more than 100 workers and apprentices from the Housheng Factory on how to deal with the situation, so it has not been completely resolved.</p>

<p>Business Tax Bureau Urgently Requests Registration of All Businesses</p>
<p>Wang Peishan, the director of the Zhenjiang Business Tax Collection Bureau, previously received an urgent telegram from the Provincial Department urging all businesses to register as soon as possible within a limited time. The director sent separate letters urging them.

After approving the letter, the bureau sent another letter to the Chamber of Commerce stating that registration and taxation are two different issues, and the wholesale industry cannot be excluded. On the one hand, he asked them to urge them to register as soon as possible, and on the other hand, he planned to send staff to visit each household to urge them to register. The director specially telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce yesterday to inform them that he would send staff to the shops soon to handle the registration in order to speed up the process.</p>

The night before last (the 29th), more than ten bandits came to the area again, holding box cannons and speaking with local accents. They robbed the three families of Li Rongzhong, Li Rongxun, and Li Rongjin of their silver, jewelry, and soft goods. They also ordered them to hand over Liu Shunhua and set fire to more than a dozen houses in the village. Before leaving, they fired dozens of shots into the east. The house of Zhu Zhaoyu in Sun Jia Zhuang was also robbed on the same night by five bandits who jumped down from the roof, overturning boxes and cabinets to search for valuables. Before leaving, they kidnapped Zhu’s nine-year-old daughter, named Su Lan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments of all provinces and cities, stating: "According to the report from Zhang Daofan, the director of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province, stating that 'According to the report from the United Association of Elementary Schools Attached to Zhejiang Provincial Middle Schools, stating that "Music is an important subject for cultivating emotions and promoting national spirit. The music textbooks currently used in general elementary schools are all gentle songs, which have a significant impact on children's temperament and the future of the nation. The third standing committee meeting of the association decided to request the Ministry of Education to compile elementary school music textbooks for use in all elementary schools. It is requested that the matter be reviewed and implemented." According to this, the music textbooks currently popular in general elementary schools and in the market are mostly unsuitable for children's temperament, and the tunes are weak, which does indeed have an impact on the future of the nation. It is requested that the Ministry compile elementary school music textbooks for use in all elementary schools. It is requested that the matter be reviewed and instructed for compliance.' Therefore, the contents of elementary school music books issued by various publishers are mostly unsuitable. This Ministry has already ordered all bookstores to submit these books for review. Many bookstores have complied with the order, but some have not submitted them for review and have issued them without authorization. You should immediately order all bookstores to submit all elementary school music books that have not yet been submitted to the Ministry for review to avoid omissions. It is also found that many elementary schools in various places have compiled their own music textbooks, which may be used for selection. You should immediately order that these self-compiled textbooks be submitted to the local education administrative organs, which will then be submitted to the Ministry for compilation and reference." In addition to the reply and separate orders, the above order is hereby issued for compliance."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments of all provinces and cities, stating: "Now, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has issued document No. 646, stating that 'The proposal of the National Industrial and Commercial Conference last year to select specialized personnel to go to factories in various countries for internship is intended to use the help of others to increase knowledge and skills and promote the development of our country's industry. In addition to the Ministry trying to contact foreign factories and selecting specialized graduates to go for internship, it is also hoped that the current students studying abroad or students selected to study abroad in the future will, after graduation, ask the ambassadors of the country to introduce them to famous factories in the country to study one or two or three years of subjects currently needed, such as mechanical, electrical, chemical, metallurgical, textile, etc., and then return to the country for use. Now that construction is in full swing and talent is needed, it would be of great benefit to the future to broadly value talent and devote efforts to industry. However, the matter falls under the scope of your Ministry's management, and you are requested to review and handle it to create talent and promote the revitalization of industry.' It is hereby noted that students studying science and engineering abroad should pay special attention to internships so that theory can be confirmed. The Ministry of Industry's proposal that students be introduced to famous factories in foreign countries for internships after graduation by the embassies in order to become familiar with technical methods is very appropriate. In addition to the reply and a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the embassies to comply, the Ministry has also issued instructions to the Student Supervision Office in Japan. It is hereby ordered that the department consider the funding and number of students studying in Europe and America in the province and draft internship regulations for graduates studying in Europe and America to be submitted to the Ministry for review."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Ministry of Education Issues Order Restricting the Establishment of Ordinary Middle Schools <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Adding Vocational Schools With High and Junior-Level Agriculture and Industry Courses</p>
<p>Ordinary Middle Schools Should Add Vocational Courses or Vocational Subjects</p>
<p>County Middle Schools Should Be Affiliated or Converted to Rural Teachers' Schools and Vocational Courses</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments of all provinces and cities restricting the establishment of ordinary middle schools and increasing the number of vocational schools. The order calls for adding vocational courses or vocational subjects in ordinary middle schools and for county junior high schools to be affiliated with or converted to rural normal schools and vocational courses.</p>
<p>It is noted that China has been running schools for thirty years, but social production is backward, and people's livelihoods are increasingly difficult. The reason is that ordinary schools have never paid attention to vocational education. For example, the former Class A and B vocational schools and today's vocational schools are often limited to economic talents, relying only on book teaching and rarely engaging in practical work. Therefore, after graduation, students still lack the practical skills to engage in various production activities. Although there are also subjects such as handicrafts, agriculture, and industry in the curricula of ordinary primary and secondary schools, in reality, they are mostly superficial and empty, and the teaching efficiency is naturally poor. This is a common problem of primary and secondary schools, both past and present, but its harm is particularly evident in today's middle schools. Originally, middle school education was preparation for further education and employment. Given the current economic difficulties of the Chinese people, middle-class families find it difficult to provide their children with a university education. Therefore, most middle school graduates cannot continue their studies. Because there are few vocational schools or their performance is not yet remarkable, most primary school graduates flock to ordinary middle schools. School organizers do not observe and mistakenly believe that education has developed in recent years and that many primary school graduates are promoted to higher education. Therefore, they think that it is not enough to increase the number of middle schools. As a result, provinces and cities compete to run high schools, and counties and cities compete to run junior high schools. Even districts below the county level have established middle schools, and private school organizers seem to have no schools to run other than middle schools. The proliferation of public and private middle schools in various places today and the low standards are all due to this one-sided observation. Therefore, after students graduate, they have no vocational training and cannot engage in various occupations. They also overestimate themselves and cannot choose a job like primary school graduates. They are at a loss and do not know what to do. Ordinary middle schools are therefore criticized by the world. If this situation does not change, we will see the exhaustion of people's livelihoods and the stagnation of society, with no end in sight. Foreseeing the future fills us with worry. Since unification, the central government has deeply considered the plan for a century and promulgated the educational purpose of the Republic of China, which is "to enrich the people's lives, support social survival, develop the people's livelihood, and continue the life of the nation based on the Three People's Principles..." It is further stipulated in the implementation guidelines that ordinary education must "cultivate the people's living skills and increase the people's productive capacity..." Reviving the decline and saving the ills are almost impossible. In order to correct the current malpractice and implement the educational purpose and its implementation guidelines, the following guidelines are specifically formulated for the establishment of middle school education in each province and city:</p>
<p>1.  Starting from the 20th year, provinces and cities directly under the Executive Yuan that have too many ordinary middle schools and too few vocational schools should temporarily not add ordinary high school courses and junior high schools. If the enrollment situation of ordinary high school courses in each province and city in the last two or three years shows that the number of applicants exceeds the number of those admitted by several times, the number of classes in each ordinary high school course may be appropriately increased.</p>
<p>2.  Starting from the 20th year, provinces should add vocational schools with high and junior-level agriculture and industry courses according to the circumstances.</p>
<p>3.  Starting from the 20th year, county middle schools should be gradually reorganized into vocational schools or rural normal schools. The method is to stop recruiting ordinary middle school students and recruit vocational or normal school students starting from the 20th year. Subsequent recruitment will be gradually changed. When all the original ordinary middle school students have graduated, they will be pure vocational schools or rural normal schools. If the counties really need to establish ordinary middle schools, those that are not reorganized should be ordered by the Education Department to attach vocational courses and rural normal school courses to the ordinary middle schools.</p>
<p>4.  Starting from the 20th year, ordinary middle schools should uniformly add vocational subjects or attach vocational courses.</p>
<p>5.  Vocational schools or middle schools with attached vocational courses should raise funds to enrich equipment and earnestly cultivate students' labor habits and production skills. The existing vocational schools at all levels should be increased with funding to expand them.</p>
<p>6.  Starting from the 20th year, the counties and cities and private applicants who apply to establish ordinary middle schools should be supervised or persuaded to change to vocational schools such as agriculture and industry. However, if the location of the county and city is too far from the provincial middle school and it is verified that it is necessary, the establishment may be approved.</p>
<p>The education departments of each province and city (directly under the central government) should comply with the above guidelines and formulate implementation measures with reference to local conditions and report them to the Ministry before the end of the 19th year for review. This is very important.</p>

<p>Yesterday Evening, They Unexpectedly Lost to Chi Chih</p>
<p>｜The Tournament is About to Close｜</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association is about to close. The three games last night were all exciting. The American School team, which had won every game, seized the championship. Last night was the team's final game, but they unexpectedly lost to Chi Chih with a score of 29 to 23. Zhen Ru defeated Hua Dong 61 to 58, and the Artillery Team defeated Qing Guang 49 to 35.</p>
<p>The Situation of Chi Chih Defeating the American School: The American School's strength was greatly affected by the absence of their defender, Pi Lai. In addition, neither Shi Guiya nor Bai Naide performed well, so they lost to Chi Chih with a score of 23 to 29. The interest was only generated by the change in scores. In terms of artistry, it was not wonderful. After the start of the game, Kai Luofu of the American School scored, and the two sides advanced shoulder to shoulder. Chi Chih relied on Kong Guangyi and Yang Linyu to forge ahead and took the lead with 14 to 9. But not long after the stalemate, Shi Guiya and Bai Naide of the American School scored successively. The first half ended with the American School winning 17 to 14. At the beginning of the second half, Chi Chih's momentum suddenly increased. The American School had many opportunities to shoot, but unfortunately, they did not score. After Chi Chih made it 20 to 20, they jumped to the lead and went straight to the top, winning the final victory with 29 to 23, breaking the American School's winning streak. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>The Scores of Each Team: The Basketball Association started on January 3rd. It was repeatedly postponed due to events. Now there are still two games left. The American School team has finished all their games. The team only failed once. The rest all failed twice.</p>
<p>Therefore, the championship has been won by the American School. The scores of each team are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e124">Sa Fuchou and Others Have Been Escorted to Beijing <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Sa Fuchou, the former commander of the Fuzhou Fortress in the Fujian Provincial Coup Case, Lin Zhong, the Brigade Commander of the Marine Corps and Commander of the Fuzhou Provincial Defense, and Qiu Zhenwu, the Deputy Brigade Commander, were arrested after arriving in Shanghai from Fujian. The commanders of various naval vessels had previously telegraphed Navy Minister Yang Shuzhuang, requesting that they be returned to the Navy Headquarters for handling in accordance with military law. It is now learned that this time, Sa and others came to Shanghai on the Changsha ship. The Municipal Government's actions were based on the central government's wanted order. They have now received orders and yesterday dispatched personnel to escort them to Beijing for investigation.</p>
<p>The commanders of the naval vessels stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and the Yangtze River telegraphed Yang Shuzhuang again yesterday, requesting the release of Sa, Lin, and Qiu. The Fujian Provincial Government, Minister Yang of the Navy, I address you secretly. My esteemed colleague Chen telegraphed inviting you to investigate. Now Sa Fuchou, Lin Zhong, and Qiu Zhenwu have been escorted to Beijing in the east. I have heard that your Excellency stated that these three are not without suspicion in the case of the January 6th coup. The Central Government has already punished Sa Fuchou and others with a major demerit and a three-month salary deduction. Your Ministry subsequently dismissed them from their posts. Later, the Central Government issued an amnesty order for those accused of political crimes. In this case, Sa Fuchou and others have been arrested again. This not only conflicts with the previous Central Government punishment and the Ministry's dismissal, but it also contradicts the Central Government's intention of leniency. I am deeply afraid and dare to implore your Excellency to quickly telegraph the Central Government to explain the details and request that Sa Fuchou and the other three be released.</p>

<h3 id="e126">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Implements the Grand Yangtze River Shipping Plan <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since Li Zhonggong took over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has felt the need for an active plan in terms of river and sea operations. Although it has been hindered by military transportation, preparations for expansion have continued unabated. He has been working hard to develop the Yangtze River route. Recently, the ships rented by the central government have been returned, and the riverboats can resume their routes on the Yangtze River one after another. The lack of ships upstream has made it impossible to connect the network. In terms of business, it is not only impossible to achieve the effect of unified command, but it is also regrettable to watch the good shipping business being taken by foreign ships. Now he has decided to implement his grand Yangtze River plan and promote its realization, and various facilities such as expanding shipping routes and adding ships are recorded below:</p>
<p>Increasing the Number of Ships to Xulu: In recent years, British, Japanese, and American shipping companies have been fiercely competing for river shipping in Sichuan. In addition to the Chongqing liners, they have also added the Yibin line upstream of the Sichuan River, which goes directly to Luzhou and Xufu ports. This route has the most freight, but the river is shallow and large ships cannot travel. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and Jiejiang all have special shallow-water ships on this line. Now, in order to connect Southwest transportation and compete with foreign ships, China Merchants has decided to open this new Yibin shipping route, temporarily using two ships. The Shanghai office has purchased two shallow-water riverboats in the local area specifically for the new Xulu route. It is said that the purchase has been finalized, and as soon as the new ships are received, they will be sent to start service.</p>
<p>Adding Ships to the Hanyi Route: The company only has one fast ship, the Kuai Li, running on the Hanyi route, which gives the impression that there is too much cargo and too few ships. This year, Sanbei also added two ships. President Li, responding to the cargo and passenger demands of this route, has already agreed to send the Wenzhou liner Guangji from mid-month to Hankou specifically for the Yichang route. The Jiaohe ship will replace the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, and the Guangli ship, which runs the Nanhua line, will take over Jiaohe's Fuzhou route.</p>
<p>Expanding the Xiang River Line: There are no longer any bandits in Hunan, and industries such as rice, cotton, mineral sands, and tung oil are being shipped out in large quantities. Foreign ships are adding more ships, and since Li Yunliang rented the Liyuan ship on the Xiangtan-Changsha route last year, there have been two ships operating on this route. Now it still feels insufficient. It is planned to add another ship. Now Li Yunliang is renting a ship in Hankou to expand. In addition, the Changde route in Western Hunan has been suspended for a long time due to bandits. Now that the bandits have been suppressed, it can be opened. The company has also agreed to open a new shipping route in Western Hunan and has ordered the business department to prepare a plan.</p>
<p>Starting a Direct Shipping Route: Now, all the ocean merchants' ships of Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and Jiejiang have direct ships from Shanghai to Yichang. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company proposed opening the Shanghai-Yichang direct route last year, but it could not be realized due to the lack of ships for military transportation. Now that all the ships have been released, the company is considering running the Jiangda and Jiangjing ships on the Shanghai-Hankou to Yichang direct route. It will be implemented soon. Another Yangtze River direct route is planned for the North and South Ocean ships, which is from Shanghai to Hankou and then back to Shanghai before directly opening the routes to Yantai, Tianjin, Shantou, and Xiamen. This special route is not currently operated by any company. Once it is opened, it can avoid the trouble of transshipment. The company initially planned to run the Xinfeng and Gongping ships on this river-sea direct route. Later, due to the shortage of ocean ships, it was not enough to distribute. It will be possible to open the route after the ocean ships that have been purchased arrive.</p>
<p>Purchasing Ten Ocean Ships: President Li, in order to replenish the Xinkang, Xinji, Xinhua, and Xinchang ships that were lost and to expand the coastal routes, decided to purchase ten ocean ships. It is said that he plans to purchase part of them and build part of them. Therefore, he has already sent a letter to the Jiangnan Factory asking them to send the cheapest shipbuilding price and drawings of various classes of ocean ships so that they can contact and order the construction.</p>

<p>French Giant Ship Arrives in Shanghai: The largest new mail ship, the Rosso, built by the French Postal Ship Company, has a deadweight of 24,000 tons. The layout of various classes of passenger seats is excellent. It is the first giant ship in the Sino-French navigation administration. It arrived in China for its first maiden voyage yesterday. Its ticket price is higher than other ships. It is now scheduled to return to France on the 25th.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Cargo Ship Collision: The pottery cargo ship of the Zhensufactory, carrying 32,000 pieces of cargo, was sunk in front of the Taikoo Beijing Wharf in the Huangpu River. Shi Guicai was commissioned to salvage the ship. When it was being towed up, it was hit by Xin Jiangtian, the tow rope was broken, and it sank again. The salvage ship was also damaged, with a total loss of 2,300 yuan. He contacted the shipping department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, and they were thoroughly investigating the driving and collision of Xin Jiangtian at that time.</p>
<p>New Price for Piece Goods and Water Freight: The water freight for goods on the Yangtze River Shanghai-Hankou route increased by 30% starting from March 1st. It has been implemented for a long time. It is now heard that the customs brokers sent a letter to the shipping companies for piece goods, requesting the abolition of the measuring procedure. The Jardine Matheson Company sent a letter to Taikoo, Sanbei, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Ning Shao, Nissin, and other companies yesterday, requesting each to send representatives to Jardine Matheson to discuss the abolition of measuring. However, piece goods must be divided into cotton fabrics and woolen fabrics to set new prices separately. The water freight for flour has been slightly reduced. The new price list is as follows:</p>
<p>Shipped from Shanghai to:　Cotton Fabric per Piece　Woolen Fabric per Piece　Flour per Dan</p>
<p>Zhenjiang　Two Coins and Ten Cents　Two Coins and Twenty Cents　Two Coins and Twenty Cents</p>
<p>Nanjing　Two Coins and Twenty-Five Cents　Three Coins and Five Cents　Zero Coins and Twenty-Four Cents</p>
<p>Wuhu　Two Coins and Sixty-Five Cents　Three Coins and Sixty Cents　Zero Coins and Twenty-Six Cents</p>
<p>Jiujiang　Three Coins and Twenty-Five Cents　Four Coins and Forty-Five Cents　Zero Coins and Twenty-Seven Cents</p>
<p>Hankou　Three Coins and Sixty-Five Cents　Five Coins　Zero Coins and Twenty-Eight Cents</p>
<p>The above new prices have been announced to all customs brokers for implementation yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Sino-Dutch Foreign Affairs Support Association Pleads for Negotiations on the Dutch Tax Increase Case for the Third Time <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Dutch Foreign Affairs Support Association of the Republic of China, believing that the Dutch are despising the Chinese people and there are rumors that they have implemented an increase in entry tax, once again appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue negotiations. The text of the telegram is recorded below: Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nanjing. In the previous telegram from Malaysia, the ministry continued to protest the Dutch tax increase case, but the Dutch claimed that it was a common law for treating expatriates from various countries and have not yet expressed acceptance. After reading it, I can see that the Dutch are completely unreasonable to me. First, the employment value of my country's expatriates is only one-tenth of that of Europeans and Americans, but the entry tax is levied equally, which is nominally equal but actually unequal. Second, my country's expatriates are the most numerous, exceeding those of other countries by hundreds of times. The increase in entry tax will harm my overseas Chinese the most, which is nominally equal but actually unequal. Third, the Dutch claim that this entry tax is a common law for treating expatriates from various countries. Why do they specifically designate the Chinese and indigenous people as a class in their regulations, which cannot be equal to Europeans, Americans, and Japanese? Their so-called laws are elastic like rubber, not firm and consistent like steel. When there are obligations, they are responsible for the Chinese to increase the burden. When there are rights, they specifically exclude the Chinese. This is not only the shame of the overseas Chinese but also the shame of the party and the country. Anyone with blood and courage will not be indignant. The association is based on supporting diplomacy and has the responsibility to contribute humble opinions. Together, we urgently telegram to plead with the ministry to continue to protest. On the one hand, we will inform the Dutch ambassador to China, and on the other hand, we will telegram the ambassador to the Netherlands to seriously negotiate. If they brazenly increase it, my country should immediately collect the same entry tax from the Dutch. The association should also unite with all sectors to boycott Dutch ships and Dutch products as a support for diplomacy and to avenge the shame of the people. I hope the ministry will educate them. The Sino-Dutch Foreign Affairs Support Association bows in winter.</p>
<h3 id="e129">News of the Silk Factory Strike in North Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Complete Resumption of Work is Expected Today</p>
<p>More than 16,000 male and female workers from more than 20 silk factories in North Shanghai, such as Fengtai and Qingfeng, went on strike unanimously the afternoon before yesterday because their request to restore the original wages was not fulfilled. After the persuasion of the trade union and the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, 22 silk factories, including Fuchangrun, resumed work yesterday. Workers from six silk factories, including Fumin, are still insisting on the strike. Two female workers were arrested yesterday. The details are recorded separately on the left.</p>
<p>Situation Yesterday Morning: At 4 AM yesterday morning, the various silk factories where the labor unrest occurred as usual urged the workers to go to work. The entire board of directors and staff of the North District Silk Spinning Industry Trade Union, Yuan Yunlong, Zhou Buyun, Li Tonghai, Wu Suzhen, Chen Qiaozhen, and others, more than ten people, set off before 4 AM to persuade the workers in the area of Chang'an Road, Guangfu Road, and Meiyuan Road to resume work first to avoid accidents. The restoration of the original wages is waiting for a legal solution. Therefore, around 6 AM, workers from 22 silk factories, including Fuchangrun, Yong'an, Xie'an, Baisi I, Baisi II, Baokang, Xie Feng, Longji, Qichang, Tailai, Dingkang, Shunfengyong, Xiechang, Xiexing, Yongtaixing, Yongyuan, Chunmei, Yuanyuan, Fengtai, Qingfeng Jin Yuan, and Shengyuan, resumed work one after another. The workers from six silk factories, including Fuchangtai at No. 695 Chang'an Road, Dingchangshun at No. 246 Hengfeng Road, Hengchangxin, Fumin at No. 238 Hengfengfeng Road, Baolun at No. 46 Yutong Road, and Dingyuan, are still insisting on the strike.</p>
<p>Female Workers Arrested: The Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District of Zhabei received information the day before yesterday</p>
<p>Afternoon, after learning about the silk factory workers' strike, they immediately dispatched more police officers near the silk factories to maintain law and order. At around 4 AM yesterday morning, two female workers who were suspected of inciting workers were suddenly seen at the corner of Chang'an Road and Meiyuan Road. They were arrested by the police officers of the Second Precinct of the Fourth District and taken to the district for questioning. They were then transferred to the Fourth District Headquarters for transfer to the Public Security Bureau for verification. According to the investigation, one of the arrested female workers, Wang Zhang, is 28 years old, from Yancheng, and is a female worker at the Fuchangtai Silk Factory. The other, Weng Lu, is 28 years old, from Taizhou, and is a female worker at the Jinyuan Silk Factory.</p>
<p>Dispatch Personnel for Investigation: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau specifically dispatched Zhu Guilin, an employee of the Third Section, to the office of the North District Silk Spinning Industry Trade Union at No. 22 Quanlefang, Hengtong Road, and to the silk factories on Hengfeng Road, Chang'an Road, Guangfu Road, Meiyuan Road, and other places at 1 PM yesterday to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the strike in order to report to the director and conduct mediation. Chen Xizeng, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, also dispatched personnel to Zhabei yesterday morning to investigate the detailed situation and advised the workers to resume work first and not to make mistakes. It is heard that as a result of the investigation and persuasion by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau, a complete resumption of work is likely today.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Real Estate Association Protests the Municipal Council's Valuation and Collection of Donations <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, saying, "It has been reported that your Council's collection of municipal general donations is based on estimated house rents, which destroys the long-standing conventions and municipal financial principles. Our Association believes that this is inappropriate. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Special District Citizens' United Association Preparatory Committee have all sent letters to your Council to criticize this. Now we ask your Council to immediately cancel this method. It should be known that the massive turmoil caused by the additional donations in 1927 was almost unmanageable. Fortunately, Mr. Yu Qiaqing mediated and resolved it peacefully. This method of collecting municipal general donations based on estimated house rents, calculated at a donation rate, is almost 1.4% higher than 1.2%. Avoiding the name of additional donations and making a huge additional donation is considered to be likely to cause major disputes, and the severity may be even greater than the 1927 additional donation.</p>
<p>In addition, your Council's land donations this year have been arbitrarily estimated higher, even by one and a half times. The annual income has increased a lot. However, the price of land is only expressed once during the transaction. It is not seen at ordinary times. It is reasonable to estimate the donation. A sudden increase will affect the burden of the owners and tenants, which is already very large. Our Association has previously expressed its opinion that it needs to be revised. Now your Council wants to increase the estimated rent higher than the actual rent in addition to the house rent with rental receipts, so as to increase the income. Or it is believed that it is quite beneficial to the landlords and can be used as an excuse to increase the rent. However, the landlords' costs have increased recently due to the increase in land donations, and the rental income is not as high as those who buy public bonds and deposit in banks. However, the tenants have been deterred. Therefore, many new buildings are empty. The income of municipal general donations has actually been affected. If your Council recalculates the municipal general donation based on the estimated rent higher than the actual rent, it will inevitably further reduce the tenants' rental ability, directly reduce the rental of real estate, and indirectly reduce your Council's tax loss. Killing the goose or chicken to get the golden eggs is a good analogy. Not only that, but the estimated rent of the rented house is higher than the actual one, then the estimated number of houses used for self-employment, such as residences and companies, which have no rent, will definitely increase accordingly. Those who are affected, such as major banks, major factories, and major department stores, will directly suffer the difficulties of increased burden, and indirectly will affect the industry and commerce. By then, all industries will decline, and transactions will be sharply reduced. Even if your Council wants to plunder and gather taxes, I am afraid that there will be no way to measure it. It is related to the social economy and the municipal prosperity and decline. We should do our best to give advice. We hope that we will still follow the old rules. In addition to the appropriate estimated rent for self-produced and self-used items, all municipal general donations will be calculated based on the actual rent. In addition, the Shanghai News reported a review on March 31, which I hope you will also review and pay attention to.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reported that the plane of the China National Aviation Corporation, which departed from Yichang East, did not arrive in Shanghai until 8 AM today (2nd), 12 hours later than the scheduled time.

It has now been decided to officially start flying on the 15th of this month and there should be no further changes. It is heard that the reason for the postponement is that the radio stations along the line have not been completely installed. Now the Xuzhou station has been installed. The Jinan station radio will be shipped out of Shanghai within days, and its installation personnel will order engineer Wang Zhenxiang and radio operator Luo Zhaoming, who have completed the installation in Xuzhou, to rush to Jinan to install it. The Beijing radio has been transported to its installation personnel.

<p>Confiscation within ten days of the order's arrival</p>
<p>The full text of the order from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to the Industrial and Commercial Savings Association is copied below: In order to comply with the order, the Municipal Government's orders No. 7479 and No. 7709 were repeatedly received, and the letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang forwarded the report from the Third District Party Department that the Educational Savings Certificates issued by the Industrial and Commercial Savings Association are still being drawn as usual, please seal them up. The reason for this order is that the association's handling of savings related to the prize-winning part had previously been approved by the municipal government to be deleted. If the association is still issuing it, it is obviously violating the approved regulations. Therefore, the association should be ordered to quickly end the prize-winning savings, stop collecting money, and return the savings of each account one by one, and report the compliance situation within ten days of the arrival of the order for review and transfer. The matter is related to the confiscation order and must not be regarded as a mere formality to interfere with the law. This order is cut and cut.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a proclamation yesterday stating that the county's personal registration has been underway for several months, but many procedures are incomplete and omissions are numerous. This is partly due to ineffective handling and also due to the people's negligence. Now, under orders to carry out rural cleansing and census taking, if personal registration is not handled diligently, the effectiveness of the census will be lost in an instant, and household registration statistics will not be accurate, greatly affecting all matters related to local autonomy. Eight provisional measures are proposed, ordering each district chief to instruct township heads and neighborhood chiefs, and ordering the Public Security Bureau to instruct each sub-bureau to instruct police chiefs to comply diligently. The measures are also attached for public knowledge. Births, deaths, marriages, inheritances, separations, relocations, and disappearances must be reported to the district township offices for registration in a timely manner without delay, lest penalties be incurred. This proclamation is hereby issued.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Banking Law Does Not Apply to Qian Industry <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Sugar Industry Association States Reasons</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "We respectfully inform you that we recently read in the newspaper that the Banking Law passed by the Legislative Yuan seems to include money shops (錢莊) within its scope. After translating the articles, we felt a great deal of concern. The money shop industry in our country has a long history. Such establishments exist in major cities and towns, as well as remote villages. Their business is mainly lending credit, and their organization is of unlimited liability, with shareholders bearing significant responsibility. China's industry and commerce are backward, capital is weak, and businesses of all sizes rely on credit loans for operating funds. Therefore, money shops rely on investing in various industries, and various industries depend on money shop loans for their survival. The two complement each other like lips and teeth, and their close relationship is self-evident. If the Banking Law were applied to money shops, their unlimited liability organization would change to limited liability, eliminating a good custom that has been followed for thousands of years. Those who have trusted and believed in them will become panicked. Furthermore, requiring shareholders to submit proof of property to the government will make potential entrepreneurs hesitant and make them give up. The money shop industry, which has been responsible for financing various industries, will inevitably be diminished, and those who have adjusted surpluses and deficits will also be hindered. Industries will lose their turnover, with no chance for development. The demise of industry and commerce can be expected imminently. Our association, as one of the various industries, feels it is our duty to speak out in the face of danger. Your esteemed Chamber leads all merchants, and we all share the same goal. We beg you to present the situation to the National Government, appealing for the formulation of separate money shop regulations based on the established customs of the money shop industry, so as to stabilize the money shop industry and indirectly maintain various industries. This urgent plea is submitted in the hope of your consideration and approval."</p>

<p>Discussion of Labor Representative to International Meeting</p>
<p>The Chinese National Federation of Industries and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce</p>
<p>Yesterday, in order to nominate representatives to attend the International Labor Conference, a notice was sent to all members inviting them to attend a joint meeting to discuss the matter together. The original letter stated: "We respectfully inform you that we have received an order from the Ministry of Industry stating that this year's Labor Conference will be held in Geneva. According to the International Labor Organization, representatives and advisors should be sent on the employer's side, and this association has been ordered to submit a list of candidates for appointment. Upon receiving this order, we have found that the International Labor Organization is part of the League of Nations organization, and since our country is a member of the League of Nations, it seems that we should both support the government externally and consider the interests of employers. Moreover, this year is the time for the election of directors of the International Labor Bureau, which makes it even more difficult to ignore. However, this matter is of great importance, so we must gather important members of the two associations to consult on a method to show prudence. It is scheduled for 4:00 PM on April 7th at the Bank Association Club on Hong Kong Road to hold a joint meeting to exchange opinions. We hope that you will be able to attend at that time."</p>

<p>The Public Works Department Gazette published the minutes of a meeting of the Public Utilities Committee held on the 17th of last month, regarding the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company's request to increase fares to make up for the reduction in exchange rates and the increase in expenses. One committee member said that increasing fares would cause hardship for the poor and that the company should be instructed to reduce the proposed increase in third-class fares. The chairman said that the company's proposed method was only to increase each mile by one copper coin, which would be difficult to reduce. There was a proposal to instruct the company to only increase first-class fares and not third-class fares. Finally, it was decided that according to the contract, the Public Works Department could not but approve it. Now, it is first consulting with the company to see if there is another way to only increase first-class fares.</p>

<p>Please Reduce the Business Tax Rate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western Paint Industry Association, for the sake of its business tax problem, specially requested that the district business tax be submitted to the Ministry for review. The association, for the sake of its own interests, yesterday pushed Zhang Jinshou, Li Shuyan, Zhou Zongliang, and Zhang Lanping, four committee members, to be representatives of the petition and submitted it to the Municipal Government and the Finance Bureau for petition.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Foil Industry Asks to Reduce Business Tax <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Foil Industry Association fast-mailed a telegram: "Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing, please acknowledge receipt. On the day of the 8th, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter saying that the Ministry of Finance had approved a reply to the telegram, saying that the points raised should be handled, and we will wait for instructions from the Zhejiang Finance Department for review and reply before further review, etc., and so on, to the association. We should prepare a letter in reply and hope for your review, etc., and so on. We have been waiting quietly until now, and the tax rate has not been reduced, and the micro-collection method has not been corrected. Previously, tin foil completed a special tax of 12.5% in Zhejiang, and then it could circulate throughout the country without being re-collected. Since the government implemented the abolition of likin on New Year's Day this year, so as to relieve the suffering of merchants and people, the Zhejiang Provincial Government hastily announced and implemented a draft business tax on foil of 15% of the self-determined value, without the approval of your department. It violates the department's established outline, and the tax rate exceeds the department's promulgated outline by 65 times. On February 1st, merchants were recruited to handle it and renamed it the Jiangzhe Foil Special Business Tax. Its collection method is still based on the tax per cargo and sets up bureaus by district, which is no different from the previous likin card. Recently, the Shaoxing Tax Bureau has arbitrarily added a tax of nine cents of silver per piece of Shuangjiu tin foil, and customs everywhere often do not allow taxed goods to travel, which hinders sales and greatly affects business. Foil merchants are extremely distressed. This has been submitted to the general meeting for resolution and has been telegraphed to the Ministry for your consideration. We ask that the department consider the difficulties of merchants and approve the strict order of the Zhejiang Finance Department to reduce the business tax rate on foil and must comply with the departmental regulations. If one item and one tax can be implemented, circulating throughout the country without being re-collected, foil merchants will be grateful. Chen Yongnian, Xu Songjia, and Lu Bingyou, Chairman of the Delegates' Assembly of the Shanghai Foil Industry Association, bow."</p>

<h3 id="e151">Huang Bai Went to Taiwan to Investigate Tobacco and Returned to Shanghai <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Jiahu and his wife, Bai Zhiying, returned to Shanghai yesterday from a trip to Taiwan. According to Mr. Huang, this trip was to inspect the tobacco ban situation in Taiwan. Unexpectedly, during the period of leaving Shanghai, they were falsely accused of Bai Zhiying selling morphine, which is very hateful. However, because the police in Taiwan often pay attention to outsiders, and many friends report that someone wants to harm Mr. Huang, they had to take a little secrecy when leaving Shanghai. Someone visited Mr. Huang before departure, and his family said that Mr. Huang had gone to Hong Kong. There was originally a female anti-drug comrade from the United States who was supposed to go together, so Mrs. Huang was invited to go with her. Later, the American could not make the appointment due to the ship schedule, so Mr. and Mrs. Huang went alone, taking the route of Xiamen. On March 10th, they boarded the Fengshan Maru ship and arrived in Keelung the next day. They stayed in Taiwan for about a week. On March 19th, they boarded the Zhishalu ship of the Zhaohua Company and left Taiwan for Xiamen. They originally planned to transfer to the Zhijianpeng ship of the same company to Shanghai on the same day. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Xiamen, they learned that someone had falsely reported to the central government that Mrs. Huang was selling morphine. At the same time, a local merchant in Xiamen colluded with a gang and boarded the ship with great momentum, intending to kidnap Mr. Huang and secretly harm him by extraordinary means, making it impossible for Mr. Huang to declare his innocence. Fortunately, Mr. Huang negotiated with the captain of the Zhishalu ship and a certain gentleman from the company's Xiamen agent, who assisted righteously and sent an electric ship to escort him to a friend's place in the Gulangyu Public Concession for temporary shelter. The leaders of the local Public Works Department, who knew Mr. Huang's character, protected him. Mr. and Mrs. Huang stayed in that place for several months and originally planned to leave after receiving a telegram from Shanghai. They waited until the Taigu Company's Taiyuan ship sailed on the 29th and attached a ride to Shanghai. Before leaving, they were escorted to the ship by many anti-drug comrades in Xiamen, and strict precautions were taken before they could escape danger and arrive safely in Shanghai yesterday. This time, Mr. Huang received assistance from all parties in Xiamen and obtained evidence that a local merchant named Zhang colluded with certain people to falsely accuse Bai Zhiying. He plans to publish it one after another.</p>

<h3 id="e152">The Three-Year-Old Murder Case Was Adjudicated Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Zhenqing Was Beaten to Death</p>
<p>Shen Yuezao Sentenced to One and a Half Years in Prison</p>
<p>The Defendant Still Applies for Appeal</p>
<p>In July of the 17th year of the Republic of China, Shen Yuezao, a patrolman No. 1244 of the Huizi Patrol Room, was searching pedestrians at the intersection of Elgin Road North and Zhejiang Road when Zhu Zhenqing, a tax collector from the Zhenjiang Municipal Finance Bureau, passed by. Shen insisted on checking him as usual, but Zhu, believing himself to be a civil servant, did not want to be searched by him, so a conflict ensued. They argued and then wrestled. Zhu suddenly fell to the ground, his face pale and appearing to be in a coma. He was sent to the hospital but died before treatment could be given. At that time, Zhu's wife, believing that her husband was beaten to death by Shen, hired a lawyer to sue the former Provisional Court, asking that he be punished according to the law. She also claimed that her husband had served in the Finance Bureau with a considerable monthly salary, and his family relied on it for support. Now that he had died in a non-fatal accident, she attached a private suit demanding that Shen compensate for the loss of more than 20,000 yuan in order to support his wife and children in the future. After several sessions of the former Provisional Court's trial, no judgment was made. The jurisdiction of the Concession was taken back by our country and the Special District Local Court was reorganized. Although this case was also included in the handover, it was delayed and no one had the time to deal with it. For three years, no one had paid attention to it. Recently, the Criminal Court President Zhou Han of the Special Court summoned both parties and inquired several times. Yesterday morning was the date for public debate on the case. The lawyers for both sides appeared in court and debated each other. At the end, Judge Zhou recognized that the defendant was guilty and sentenced Shen Yuezao to one year and six months in prison. The part of the private suit was ordered to be transferred to the civil court for handling. However, the defendant heard the verdict and refused to accept it. His lawyer declared an appeal, requesting that the defendant be allowed to pay the original guarantee for bail during the appeal period. Therefore, this case, which has been delayed for three years, still needs time to end.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Ma Songting Described the Whole Story of Strangling His Paramour <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>First Saw Another Man in the Room</p>
<p>Suddenly Fled Through the Roof</p>
<p>Killed Because of Jealousy and Hatred</p>
<p>Ma Songting, a native of Suqian, strangled his paramour, Song Qiaobao, a native of Suzhou, in a house at No. 373 Hejian Road on the morning of February 13th of last year. He then stole her jewelry and cash and fled to Nanjing. He was recently arrested by the Capital Police Department and sent to Shanghai by the Patrol Room to be investigated and detained by the Special District Local Court, etc., which has been recorded in this newspaper. It is learned that Ma Songting was united with Song Qiaobao in Wumen. Qiaobao had already been married by her mother, Song Gao, and had two children. Later, after her husband died of illness, she originally wanted to remain a widow, raise her orphans, and learn machine work to make a living. However, since meeting Tingsong, the ancient well was rippled again. Seeing Tingsong in a Western suit, she thought he was a wealthy man at sea, but she did not know that he was only superficial. Hearing that wages in Shanghai were better than in Suzhou, she followed him to Shanghai. Song Gao relied on her daughter for a living, so Qiaobao took her two children and lived with her brother, Ma Tingshou, on Hejian Road. Qiaobao had a lot of private savings, and Songting was addicted to gambling and owed debts, so Qiaobao helped him with money, and their relationship became more affectionate. On the day that Tingsong strangled Qiaobao, according to him, it was because Qiaobao had a lover in the room who was discovered by him. Out of jealousy, he resorted to this means. When the judge asked who the lover was, he said that he had escaped from the roof. However, during the continued trial yesterday, according to Song Gao, her daughter had no other lover, and at that time, she went out to buy noodles, so she did not know the cause of the conflict. But when she left home, her daughter and the defendant were still sitting in the living room, and when she returned, she could not see them. She went upstairs to inspect, but there was no trace. A large leather suitcase was opened, and more than 100 yuan in cash and two gold rings were missing. Her daughter also had 140 yuan and two gold rings and a hollow gold bracelet, all of which were missing. She was still worried that her daughter might have had a quarrel with Songting and went out to commit suicide by jumping into the river, so she went to nearby riverbanks to search and notified her brother, Shoutong, to help search. In the evening, her nephew Erguan wanted to take the package placed under the bed, so she entered the pavilion and saw a foot sticking out. Upon inspection, it was Qiaobao, who had already died. She hurriedly reported to the Patrol Room, who sent detectives to come and carefully inspect the scene under the light. They saw a rope around her neck, which must have been strangled to death, and the defendant has not returned since then. He must have done it, she said. The defendant still confessed that at that time, he came home from outside and was about to go upstairs when he saw a man holding a knife in the pavilion, seeming to want to kill him. Qiaobao frequently shook her head to signal him not to go upstairs. In a moment, the man fled through the roof. He then went upstairs and strangled Qiaobao and immediately ran out, without hiding the body under the bed or stealing gold jewelry and cash. Judge Feng concluded the interrogation and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Bandit Who Kidnapped Wang Yunwu Was Executed Yesterday <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The kidnapper, Fei Zhuyu, a native of Shengxian, Shaoxing, was 38 years old. In November of the 15th year of the Republic of China, he colluded with accomplices to kidnap Wang Yunwu, manager of the Commercial Press, on Doule'an Road and Yokohama Road, and hid him in a house at No. 74 Baoyuan Road in Zhabei, demanding a huge ransom. The case was discovered and Fei was apprehended by Shangwu, a Chinese detective of the Huizi Patrol Room. The Special District Court interrogated him and sentenced him to death, and reported it to the Provincial Government for approval and execution. Yesterday afternoon, the due date was reached. Judge Cheng Shangfeng came to the Fifth Criminal Court and ordered Fei Zhuyu to be brought to the case. Judge Cheng announced to Fei that he had received official documents from his superiors today and must execute the death penalty. Did he have any last words? Fei replied that when he was arrested, he had 195 yuan in cash, which was confiscated by the Patrol Room. The money was brought to Shanghai from his hometown to prepare to open a small cigarette paper shop. He was arrested only three days after arriving in Shanghai. Now that he is about to be shot, please take out two yuan to buy food for me, three yuan to buy long ingots, and send the remaining 190 yuan to my brother-in-law Qiu Liansheng at Chongren Town, 30 miles outside the west gate of Shengxian, Shaoxing, to be handed over to my uncle Fei Kaizhi. He has nothing else to say. Then the Patrol Room lawyer said that the cash had been found by the Patrol Room to be the ransom for kidnapping two children in Shaoxing, and Fei had also confessed to it during the trial on December 29th of last year, so it should be confiscated according to law. Judge Cheng then ordered that two yuan be taken out of the court's account box and ordered the officers to buy wine and food for Fei to eat his fill. Then, the detectives, along with the photo files, escorted him to the execution ground in Caohejing in the prisoner's car. He called the Shanghai Local Court to send a prosecutor to the scene and ordered the bailiffs to bring Fei to the case to verify his identity and bind him according to the law for execution by shooting.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Case of Flower Jiqiu's Concubine Filing Charges of Fraudulent Marriage and Abuse <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Beaten Several Times a Day, Forced to Swallow Opium</p>
<p>Unable to Endure the Suffering, Difficult to Live Together</p>
<p>Demanding Alimony of Five Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Flower Jiqiu from Jiangxi, currently thirty-six years old and residing at 1625 Jing'an Temple Road, has recently been sued in the Special District Court by his concubine, Flower Zhou, for abandonment and abuse. The indictment states that Flower Jiqiu deceived her into marriage, and after entering his household, she discovered that the defendant already had one wife and one concubine. Since what was done could not be undone, she retreated to the status of a maid. However, she was frequently abused, beaten several times a day, and forced to swallow opium, repeatedly nearing death. She was then driven out and forbidden to live with him, and she is now requesting compensation of five thousand yuan, among other claims. Yesterday, Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the court to hear the case. Flower Jiqiu testified that he was formerly in the academic world and is now in business. He married the plaintiff as a concubine on July 28th of the eighteenth year [of the Republic], with a contract signed by her birth mother, brother, and matchmaker. They were always harmonious. However, since last year, his birth mother frequently came to stir up trouble, wanting to take his mother back, which he did not allow, leading to disagreements. As for forcing her to swallow gold and opium, it is entirely fabricated. Since she entered the household, he often taught her to read and write, hoping she would improve herself. On November 27th last year, the family was busy entertaining guests, but she was nowhere to be seen. The next day, he found her in her room having taken something with tea. Upon questioning, he learned that she had swallowed [gold] and immediately called a doctor for treatment. After taking medicine for three days without any improvement, he wrote to her mother's house in Suzhou, asking her daughter to come to Shanghai to persuade and advise her. Therefore, he mentioned the matter of swallowing gold in the letter. However, she returned to Suzhou with her mother and never came back. He repeatedly wrote letters urging her, but to no avail. He then went to Suzhou in person, where her family had him arrested by the detective team on false charges of being a bandit. After being proven innocent, he was released. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff still did not let him off and actually used the law to ask him for money to fulfill her other plans, among other things. Flower Zhou stated that she is a Suzhou native, nineteen years old this year, born on September 21st. She married at the age of seventeen, receiving a bride price of five hundred yuan. A birth chart was sent, but she did not know who signed the Flower imprint on the contract. At the time, no wedding ceremony was held. It was said that he had no wife, but after entering the household, she learned that he already had one wife and one concubine. She was usually abused. Now that she has encountered a violent husband, it is difficult to live with him. She has no choice but to return to her mother's house. However, since the plaintiff is still young, she has no means of support for the rest of her life, and since she has already married, it is difficult to marry again. She is requesting a ruling for alimony of thirty yuan per month for fifteen years, totaling five thousand yuan, among other claims. Judge Cheng then instructed the lawyers for the plaintiff and defendant to argue their cases, and a ruling was set for next Thursday. The defendant was ordered to be available for questioning at any time while awaiting the verdict.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Lost Son and Mistress Share a Sweet Dream <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, Police Arrive Out of Nowhere</p>
<p>Result: He is Willing to Return Home with His Father</p>
<p>Xu Senbao from Yin County, fifty years old, had a son named Duofang who was enticed by a woman from Changzhou named Weng Gendi, and they planned to marry and live together. His father learned that Gendi was a waitress in a brothel, of low social status, and did not allow it. His son then left Yin County in the first month [of the lunar year] and never returned, even sending a letter threatening suicide. His father then came to Shanghai to search for him and accused Gendi of disrupting his family in the Special District Court. The defendant did not appear at the court hearing, so an arrest warrant was issued, and officers No. 61 from the Western Precinct and No. 1689 from the Chinese Precinct, along with translator Zhu Mengwei and Xu Senbao, arrested them at No. 36 Pushi Road the day before yesterday. At that time, the two were sleeping intertwined, their sweet dream in full swing. Upon seeing the police officers, they were greatly alarmed. Duofang knelt on the ground, repented to his father, and vowed to break off with Gendi and return home with him. Xu Senbao, determined to have his son returned, did not want to make trouble, so he voluntarily withdrew the charges.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Tea Boy Attempts Suicide by Taking Poison <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Works as a Tea Boy in Sanbei Company</p>
<p>Sent Out to Deliver Four Hundred Yuan, Never Returned</p>
<p>Attempts Suicide in Jue Lu Hotel</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5 p.m., a man claiming to be Wang Deqing, about thirty years old and in business, arrived at the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Road. The tea boy led him to room 95 to rest. In the evening, an old woman, a woman, and a child went to visit him, talked with the guest for a long time, and then left. Yesterday afternoon around 1 p.m., the tea boy routinely asked the guest if he wanted to continue staying, but the door was locked from the inside. After knocking many times without a response, he reported it to the accounting office. The door was broken open, and upon looking inside, everything in the room was as usual. The so-called Wang Deqing was lying stiffly on the bed, barely breathing. Upon inspection, a small can of raw opium was found on the bed, with the paste smeared everywhere, indicating that the guest had taken poison. It was then known that the guest had committed suicide by taking poison. The matter was immediately reported to the Zhabei police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. Wang Deqing was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he was unable to be saved due to the overdose. Afterwards, a "Shen Shun" receipt book was found in the room, with the words "Sanbei Shipping Company" on it. Upon inquiry by the hotel, it was learned that the person who committed suicide was actually a tea boy from the Sanbei Shipping Company named Yao Shunjin, a native of Ningbo. The name Wang Deqing was an alias. It is said that Yao went out to deliver four hundred yuan one afternoon and never returned that night. Last year, he also attempted suicide with tranquilizer water.</p>

<p>Cao Fengzhang's house in Hukou Youche Town, outside Wusongkou, was suddenly raided by more than twenty bandits on the night of March 22nd. They broke down the door and ransacked the place at will. Before leaving, they kidnapped the owner, Cao Fengzhang, and his whereabouts were unknown. The family was extremely anxious and was trying to find out information when they suddenly received a letter delivered by the post office the day before yesterday. Upon opening it, it was from the bandits in Shanghai, demanding a ticket price of 100,000 yuan. In addition, they also needed a handgun, silk stockings, and cigarettes, which must be prepared immediately. They would arrange a location for contact a week later.</p>

It is said that the soldier wanted to ask for leave, but his superiors did not approve, leading to the suicide due to irritation. It is also said that the soldier accidentally pulled the trigger while unloading the bullet, resulting in the death. The commander of the team reported to his superiors and prepared a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Youth Association's 31st Fundraising Campaign, with a goal of 50,000 points (one yuan per point), was conducted by ten teams. Since its opening on March 11th, the total captain Zhang Yuejun and the team captains have worked hard to solicit donations.

The evening of the day before yesterday was the closing date of the fundraising campaign. The total announced score was actually 65,189 points, exceeding the goal by 15,189 points, and there were still many scores that had not been submitted. The Academic Team alone obtained 12,268 points, setting a new record in the association's fundraising campaign.

<p>The Shanghai County Government believes that it is imperative to conduct smallpox vaccinations as soon as possible during the spring season to prevent the spread of smallpox. County Magistrate Yan has sent a letter to the Shanghai Hospital requesting assistance with supplies. The hospital has approved and sent sixty doses of smallpox vaccine, twelve bales of cotton, twelve bales of gauze, six bottles of alcohol, and six tubes of elephant skin ointment. Yesterday, the county government distributed them to the six districts and ordered them to conduct vaccinations as soon as possible, notifying the public to go to the districts for vaccination.</p>

<p>Two Drivers Argue Endlessly</p>
<p>The Tram Service is Interrupted</p>
<p>At 7:35 last night, Public Bus No. 4090 on the Hua Merchants' Second Route, traveling from Longhua to Laoximen, was turning south near the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower in Ximen when it accidentally collided with Tram No. 40 on the Hua Merchants' Third Route, traveling from Yuan Route from north to south. Fortunately, the impact was not severe, only damaging the copper stem on the right side of the tram's head. None of the passengers on either vehicle were injured. However, because the two drivers each insisted on their own version of events and argued for a long time, the tram service was completely blocked. About thirty trams were stopped from Laoximen to Xiaobeimen Fahua, with the electric lights flashing like a fire dragon. The street was crowded with onlookers. The officers from the Second District Headquarters and the First Branch of the Second District ordered patrol officers to investigate. They first used planks and iron rods to switch the cars one by one near Fangbang Bridge, and then recorded the driver numbers of both drivers (Public Bus driver No. 5, Hua Merchants' Tram No. 98) and sent them to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Lawsuit Involving Construction Over Boundary <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Feng Chunsheng hired a lawyer to represent him in the Civil Division of the French Concession Court, stating that the plaintiff has a property in the Baille Road area under the jurisdiction. However, recently, a neighboring owner, Wang Zhenxiang, hired workers to build a house on the empty land, and the construction actually crossed the boundary, encroaching on the eastern section by seven feet and the western section by four feet, obstructing the road and removing the boundary stone, requesting investigation and verification. The defendant's lawyer argued that the details of the case had not yet been studied and requested a postponement. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that they did not object to the defendant's lawyer's request for a postponement, but requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction ordering the defendant to remove the bamboo fence and the workshop. The landlord, Zhu Guisheng, was also involved in collusion and requested that he be investigated together. The defendant's lawyer argued that the truth of the matter, whether or not the land was encroached upon, had not yet been proven, so there was no reason to request a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant's bamboo fence was obstructing the plaintiff's windows, so a preliminary injunction was necessary. The landlord, Zhu Guisheng, was also represented by a lawyer. Judge Gong ruled that the hearing would be postponed and ordered the clerk, Wu Chongguang, to conduct an on-site inspection with both parties to report back for verification.</p>

<p>Wang Lianfang, Tu Kaizheng, Situ Shangyue, and others in the Nanjing Road area of this port initiated the establishment of the First District Branch of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Association. The inaugural meeting was held at the Dadong Restaurant at 3:00 PM on April 1st. One hundred and eight members attended, exceeding two-thirds of the total number. Xu Yefu, a commissioner from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Sun Yongyi, a commissioner from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Hu Fengxiang and Yu Zhongxian, commissioners from the Citizens' Association, attended the meeting to guide and supervise the election. Symbol Co Kaming, of the cosmetics association, and representatives from the various district branches were also present. At the beginning of the meeting, the formalities were performed as usual. Zhang Yichen was elected chairman and Ni Gulian as secretary. As a result of the election, Zhang Zilian, Xi Guansheng, Wang Lianfang, Liu Xiji, Tu Kaizheng, He Guangsheng, Li Jianliang, Wang Caiyun, Sun Xueni, Huang Hongjun, Zhang Yichen, Fei Xingzhuang, Ji Jiannan, Lin Weinan, Shi Zongtang, Le Zhenbao, Sun Wenyi, Zhou Juren, Yu Yanting, Zhuang Zhihe, Xu Meiqing, Le Fucheng, Hu Lifu, and twenty-two others were elected as executive committee members and alternate members.

They were approved on the spot and handed over to the new committee for handling. Finally, tea and snacks were served, and a photo was taken before dispersing at nightfall.</p>
<h3 id="e169">American Ship Houston to Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Great American Evening Post said that the flagship of the United States Asiatic Fleet, the Houston, will arrive in Shanghai around the 15th of this month. The ship was originally scheduled to come directly to Shanghai from Xiamen, but the plan has been changed to arrive at Songkou on April 5th to load mail and then sail up the river to Beijing. It is expected to arrive there on the morning of the 7th. Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Mikeville will visit government officials in Beijing. If he can complete his official business in time, he plans to set sail for Shanghai on the morning of the 15th. Because the American naval buoy in the Huangpu River cannot moor a ship as large as the Houston (600 feet long and 66 feet wide, the current naval treaty stipulates that warships are limited to this size, so the ship can be called the largest in the navy), it will be anchored near the 10th and 23rd buoys of the Ruirong Shipyard. The American naval authorities have asked the Customs to expand the warship berthing area in the Huangpu River, but have not been granted permission, because the Customs is currently trying to order all warships to leave the buoys in the Huangpu River to avoid hindering commercial navigation.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Difficulties After the Reform of the Songhu Railway <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Frequent Delays</p>
<p>Crowded Passengers</p>
<p>After the Songhu Railway switched to steam engines, the number of daily round trips increased to seventy-four. Since the 15th of last month, the number of daily trips has been changed to forty, but the number of trips between Jiangwan and Shanghai has been increased to eighty-two. The steam locomotives that have been freed up are used as reserves to avoid delays caused by damaged vehicles. The Railway Bureau also declared that if there are crowded passengers on the entire line, the Railway Bureau can still specially open locomotives and attach vehicles to accommodate the passengers. However, it has been more than half a month since the implementation of the reform. The Shanghai-Jiangwan section is indeed convenient, but the passengers on each round trip between Songhu are extremely crowded. In the afternoon, many passengers who have purchased tickets are unable to board the train. The Railway Bureau should take measures to rectify this.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Coal Industry Association Temporary Meeting <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Kailuan's Failure to Deliver Coal as Agreed</p>
<p>The Coal Industry Association is discussing a solution because the Kailuan Sales Office has failed to deliver coal as agreed, causing a dispute. Therefore, a discussion meeting was held at 2:30 yesterday, chaired by Mao Chunpu. Lu Qisheng, Pan Yisan, Yan Yangshan, and others expressed their opinions, all of whom believed that the claim by the Kailuan Sales Office that transportation on the Beining Road was difficult was inconsistent with the evidence obtained by the association from various sources. It was confirmed that the Sales Office had other intentions and deliberately breached its contract, resulting in industrial manufacturers feeling the fear of coal shortages and causing social disputes. The association previously sent a letter to the Sales Office for inquiries, but the Sales Office did not respond with the facts. Therefore, the Sales Office should be responsible for everything. Zhang Zhangkui of Yuantai Company said that the Sales Office has not been able to announce the truth about the difficult transportation on the Beining Road, so their four companies have not received any news and cannot answer the questions of their fellow traders. Luo Deyou, Bao Zhexiong, and others said that recently, fellow traders have been forced to buy other types of expensive coal to compensate their customers due to the Kailuan coal shortage, incurring a subsidy of about 23.4 taels per ton. This is a last resort for fellow traders to maintain their reputation with customers. After several discussions, it was decided to convene a mediation meeting between the two parties on April 9th in accordance with the association's constitution, in order to quickly and peacefully resolve the dispute and avoid further conflicts.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jishi Society recently appointed Qiu Yunmen, Ma Jintao, and Chen Bingsheng to go to Shaanxi to inspect and supervise the release of disaster relief funds. A telegram was received stating that Li and others had arrived in Shaanxi on a certain day and immediately went to Wugong, Fufeng, and Qishan counties to inspect the disaster situation. A telegram was also received from Qiu Yunmen and others stating that the Wugong Burial Team has been established. The county is short of seeds and it is difficult to hope for an autumn harvest. It has been decided to release seeds quickly and has been discussed with comrades Lu and Dai of the Shaanxi Branch to invite several comrades to go to Wugong together to bury and release the seeds tomorrow. The first batch of disaster relief funds of 20,000 yuan has been sent by the Shaanqian Hehao and has been asked to be exchanged by the Shanghai Qianhe Indigo Shop for disaster relief. The association exchanged the funds and handed them over to the Shanghai Qianhe Indigo Shop for disaster relief on the 30th. As soon as the disaster relief funds were allocated, a telegram was received from She Guisheng, the director of the Tianjin Disaster Relief Office, stating that the disaster situation in Qian County, Shaanxi is extremely serious. There is a lack of both seeds and food, and there are no strong laborers. Disaster relief is essential for survival. Please send someone to provide disaster relief as soon as possible. A reply is urgently requested. The association believes that the disaster area is large and the disaster relief funds are difficult to spread. Although public planning has been carried out, there are still no concrete measures.</p>

<p>Dr. Kong Yongzhi, president of the China Child Welfare Association, is extremely enthusiastic about child welfare. Since the association was established three years ago, the child welfare work has been remarkable. The association has recently been limited by economic problems, so its work has not been expanded. Therefore, it has launched a fundraising and membership drive, but the results at the beginning were not good. President Kong was worried about this and generously donated 4,200 yuan to subsidize the association's funds and jointly promote progress. President Kong can be described as someone who feels the pain of others and is generous and caring.</p>
<h3 id="e175">River and Sea Navigators Must Pass Exams <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>To Prepare for the Dismissal of Foreign Sailors</p>
<p>During the current period of recovering navigation rights, various Chinese shipping companies are actively seeking to expand. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new Northeast route has already dispatched the Tunam, and the surface rights on the Yangtze River occupied by foreign ships are also being gradually recovered. With time, this goal will be gradually achieved. However, there is a lack of navigation specialists. Most of the Chinese merchant ships hire foreign sailors. This year, a batch of students from the navigation department of the China Merchants School have been sent to ships for practical training. The Zhengji Company has dismissed about 124 senior Japanese sailors, retaining only 81 and gradually replacing them with Chinese personnel. The Central Legislative Yuan has specially formulated the Regulations on Examination of River and Sea Navigators to promote domestic navigators, allowing qualified Chinese to apply and take the examination to ensure that no talent is wasted. Foreign navigators can also be gradually dismissed. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan ordered the shipping bureaus in Shanghai to announce these regulations and notify their subordinates so that they can prepare for the examination. The main points are recorded below:</p>
<p>Instruction: Executive Yuan Instruction No. 27: Approved the Legislative Yuan's communication stating that the Regulations on Examination of River and Sea Navigators have been formulated, promulgated, and implemented by this Yuan. In addition to distributing them to the administrative organs of the provinces and cities directly under the jurisdiction, they should be announced and the shipping companies should be ordered to notify their subordinate navigators to apply for the examination in accordance with the regulations. (Omitted below) Yesterday, the shipping bureaus in Shanghai received this order and distributed it to their navigators for reference and preparation for the examination in accordance with these regulations.</p>
<p>Regulations: A total of twelve articles. The main points are extracted below: (1) The Regulations on Examination of River and Sea Navigators shall be implemented on the date of promulgation; (2) Those who have not passed the examination shall not be Chinese River and Sea Navigators; (3) The provisions of the preceding article shall apply to all official and commercial ships other than naval warships officers; (3) Any Chinese person with two years or more of river and sea navigation experience and sound physical and eyesight may take the examination; (4) River and Sea Navigators are divided into five grades: special grade captain, captain, first mate, second mate, and third mate; (5) The examination subjects are divided into three categories according to their business: foreign ocean-going, domestic coastal, and river; (6) The examination is divided into oral and written tests, and the subjects include magnetism, hydrostatics, statics, principles of navigation instruments, logarithmic plane, trigonometry, driving method, Ziqian line, International Navigation Collision Regulations, Maritime Law, McQuyck driving, nautical charts, measuring water depth, International flag signals, solar and lunar star altitude, marine rescue, lifeboat work cabin machine overview, and many other items that can be listed. Yesterday, the shipping bureaus distributed them to the navigators of each ship to prepare for the examination in accordance with these regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Discussion on Dong Dingsan's House Tax Standard <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Municipal expert Dong Xiujia previously served as a consultant to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, Secretary-General of the Hankou Municipal Government, and Director of the Public Works Bureau and Director of the Engineering Bureau. He is currently a member of the Shanghai Municipal Construction Discussion Committee and has a great understanding of Chinese and foreign municipal administration research. A reporter from the National News Agency interviewed Mr. Dong on the matter of the Municipal Council's valuation and collection of house tax and asked for his opinion. According to Mr. Dong, house tax is an important municipal tax in British cities. When collecting house tax in British cities, the standard for taxation is generally based on the actual rental price of the houses. The municipal governments of various cities never arbitrarily estimate the rental price of houses and force citizens to pay taxes according to the price. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Council suspects that the actual rental prices of houses are inaccurate and incomplete and plans to estimate them itself and use its estimated rental price as the standard for collecting total taxes. Citizens are afraid that the Council's appraisers will deliberately overestimate the rent, so the amount of total tax paid in the future will exceed the actual rent. The two sides hold different opinions and have not yet resolved the issue. In fact, the collection of house tax (ie, total tax) has precedents in British cities and has also been adopted as an important municipal tax in Chinese cities for a long time. Generally, it is based on the actual rent, and there is no need for a separate estimate. This can eliminate all the expenses of the appraisers and prevent them from cheating when estimating the rent. In my opinion, the Municipal Council can adopt the following methods to solve this problem: (1) The house tax (ie, total tax) should still be based on the rent reported by the landlords. However, the rent on the property tax bill must be clearly indicated as the basis for the rent. (2) Investigate whether the rent on the property tax bills of each household is accurate. If any false reporting of rent is found, the tax should be collected based on the actual rent, so that the total tax revenue will not be reduced. (3) For self-occupied properties, an estimate must be added, but the rent of nearby properties should be used as a reference during the estimate and should be appropriately reduced, because self-occupied properties are not for profit, so less house tax should be collected to show the Municipal Council's intention to encourage self-owned housing.</p>

<p>The Jixi Native Place Association in Shanghai convened its seventh joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday.

<p>The Shaoxing Native Place Association's association affairs improvement movement appointed Hu Fo and Zhang Ziying as representatives. The day before yesterday, at 1:00 PM, they visited Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and Wang Yansong, vice-chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and presented the various opinions on improving association affairs that had been resolved at the recent general meeting, requesting the chairman and vice-chairman to adopt them within their authority. They also stated the members' request to convene a temporary general meeting. Both chairmen agreed to consider it. Vice-Chairman Wang expressed his opinion on the fundamental organizational issue of the association, believing that it would be more appropriate to use a committee system. However, he said that reform would require some time for preparation, and it was too early to convene a general meeting at present. The two representatives continued to talk for a while and then left.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Setting Up an Altar for Sutra Chanting and Buddhist Worship at the June 3rd Garden <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Japan has been using the new calendar for decades, but farmers in the countryside still follow the old customs for farming. The birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha was originally on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month in the old calendar. Now, in order to follow the trend, it has also been changed to the national calendar. The Japanese Buddhist Association in Shanghai has decided to advance the event to April 5th (Sunday) in the new calendar and set up a temporary Buddhist altar at the June 3rd Garden to collectively chant sutras and worship the Buddha. Admission tickets have been distributed to invite Buddhist men and women to participate. Those who have not obtained this ticket only need to purchase artificial flowers at the entrance and hang them on their chests to enter. Each ticket costs a small amount of two dimes, just to cover the expenses. At that time, several cherry blossom trees in the garden will be in full bloom, adding to the visual enjoyment with the help of the Buddha's power. It will definitely be a lively event.</p>

<p>The Tongren Pharmaceutical Institute in Wei'an Lane, Haining Road, specializes in secretly manufacturing miraculous medicines such as Hemorrhoid Relieving Pills, Hemorrhoid Root-Cutting Powder, and Liver and Stomach Pain Relieving Pills. Founded in the first year of Xuantong, it has been deeply trusted by patients since its inception. It has been reported that the manager of the institute has had to increase the price of the above-mentioned medicine by two yuan and four dimes per double-dose box, starting from April 1st, due to the rising cost of raw materials in recent years, while the price of single-dose boxes remains the same. The retail and wholesale trade is still very crowded, and the supply is far from meeting the demand. They are currently working day and night to meet the needs of patients.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Respected Editor of the Great Newspaper: I am writing to inform you that the news column of your newspaper today contains a report stating that all twenty-odd silk factories in Northern Shanghai have gone on strike to demand the restoration of the original fixed wages. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. On the afternoon of March 31, a female worker at the Qingfeng Silk Factory had a quarrel with an employee, which almost led to an incident. The dispute was quickly resolved, and work resumed as usual the next morning. This involved only one person and one factory and did not involve outsiders. The labor unrest that occurred yesterday afternoon was a completely separate matter. No demands were made beforehand, and no one came forward to take responsibility afterward. Although the female workers were blindly following, they all resented the instigators. At that time, Zhou, the director of the Fourth District Bureau of Public Safety, and Wu, the director of the Second Branch of the Fourth District Bureau, personally went to the scene to mediate and separately advise the female workers and inquire about the reasons for the strike. They were all unable to answer. Then, Shen Huaichen, the chairman of our association, and Huang Jinfan, a standing committee member, separately convened representatives of the female workers, including Wu Suzhen, to inquire about the situation in detail. They also claimed that no one had mentioned it beforehand and did not ask for any demands afterward. Although the Women Workers' Association tried its best to investigate, it was all passive. Until after 10:00 PM, the truth could not be ascertained. Therefore, the female workers were advised to return to work as usual tomorrow (i.e., today). As a result, more than a dozen factories have already resumed work this morning. However, timid female workers did not dare to go to the factory, and it was learned that several people were inciting the strike. The police officers have arrested them (the following is omitted). I hereby request that you write a reply. Shanghai Silk Industry Guild Committee.</p>
<p>The China Seafarers' Industrial Federation yesterday issued a document to its branches stating: For order.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter, our association's secretary, Liu Yuzhou, reported that he had read an article in the Shen Bao on the 27th of this month entitled "Shanghai Shipping Companies Discuss Teahouse Attendant Issues." The article stated that Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. said, "The labor union does not allow teahouse attendants to be directly employed by the company," and the shipping association said, "The teahouse attendant system of the seafarers' union is not good, and the seafarers' union is using its union power to encroach on the sovereignty of public affairs." Both of these matters are false and concerning the labor dispute with the teahouse attendants, the main reason is that the company side and the comprador level collect security deposits and other malpractices and do not pay wages. This is the poor system and exercise of sovereignty of the capitalist side, which has been exposed by our association in official documents and publications. Shipping companies do not self-reflect but blame the workers. For the present plan, our association should publish corrections on the one hand, and send letters to question the capitalists on the other hand, and order the Shanghai, Ningbo, Hankou, Jiujiang, and Wenzhou branches to investigate and report on the treatment of teahouse attendants to our association for submission to the central government for verification, so as to avoid confusion and damage to the reputation of our association. The contents of the newspaper and the report form were filed with the court. In accordance with the decision of the 23rd Standing Committee meeting of our association, the report form and the survey form are hereby sent to the association and forwarded to you for immediate compliance with the order to send personnel to investigate the treatment of the workers in the middle class on the ship and fill in the form for submission. The matter concerns the capitalist's slander of the sailors' suffering and the credibility of the union's branches at all levels, so do not neglect it.</p>
<p>Sir/Madam, I recently saw a news item in the newspapers of April 2 concerning the meeting of the municipal industry tax regulations association. The two items discussed concerned the municipal business tax. It was generally stated in the report that the tax rate had been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and that the consent of the Chamber of Commerce representatives had not been obtained beforehand and should be denied and rejected for investigation. The draft municipal business tax rate was discussed at a temporary office meeting convened by former Director Tang on March 26, during which the advisors, specialized committee members, and preparation members of the office were convened for a discussion. The attendees expressed their opinions and made slight changes in preparation for another scheduled meeting to invite representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to participate in the opinions and make revisions before submitting them to the Municipal Government for consultation with the Ministry of Finance. This was stated publicly by the chairman at the meeting at that time. Later, because former Director Tang resigned due to illness, there was a scheduled handover that was not completed. Now that the newly appointed Director Cai has taken over, a meeting will be scheduled to notify the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to discuss matters. The investigation and filing of reports are separate matters that have not yet been implemented. The fact that the previously reported tax rate has been sent to the ministry is not true and is a rumor that should be corrected to avoid misunderstandings. In addition to sending a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, I hope that you will investigate and make corrections quickly. This letter is addressed to the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao and the Preparatory Office of the Business Tax of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. April 2.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Japanese Female Teacher Commits Suicide Under Train Wheels <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yuanliang</p>
<p>The cause of suicide is nothing more than weakness of will or temporary indignation. However, the methods of death are different. Some use medicine to reduce the physical pain, while others use drastic methods that make people exclaim in horror. The recent tragic suicide of a female teacher in Nishikyo, Japan, is one example. According to reports, there is a girls' school in the area. Ms. Nakkamura, a teacher at the school, is young, well-educated, and graceful with a silver tongue. However, she was born at the wrong time. Her parents passed away, leaving behind two sisters who were both of school age. She relied solely on her older sister. Ms. Nakkamura had an open mind and could not bear to see them lose their opportunity to study. However, her career as a teacher was also quite difficult. Where could she find extra money to subsidize her sisters' education? A certain coffee shop was recruiting waitresses. Ms. Nakkamura heard the news and resolutely applied. From then on, after finishing her classes, she would apply makeup and put on silks and brocades again before rushing to the shop to spend her life serving customers. She would not return home until two o'clock the next morning, which was also said to be difficult. At that time, there were many coffee shops in the city, and they competed fiercely for business, showing off their strange and ingenious ways of attracting customers. They recruited waitresses to attract customers, but most of the employees were mediocre, and few were as beautiful and intelligent as Ms. Nakkamura. Customers who talked to her found her talk eloquent and were happy and forgot their fatigue. As a result, they all flocked to the shop, and the shop's business flourished. At that time, a certain journalist secretly learned the inside story and quickly drafted an article and submitted it to a major newspaper. The next morning, the newspaper was published and spread throughout the city. The matter was heard by the person in charge of the school, who thought it was related to the school's reputation and immediately summoned her to show her the news. Ms. Nakkamura admitted it directly and stated that she would rather sacrifice her appearance than sit idly by and watch her sisters lose their opportunity to study. The person in charge of the school said that the school was a place for chanting and learning and bore the responsibility of enlightening culture. How could it tolerate this mixing of the tracks, a place of drunken gold and paper fans, and harm young people? He decided to dismiss her. Ms. Nakkamura's heart was broken by this blow. The next day, she went out and lay down on the railroad tracks. Suddenly, a fast train sped straight down. By the time the people on the train noticed, her limbs were separated, and her flesh and blood were blurred. The loss of such a beauty is truly shocking and heartbreaking.</p>
<h3 id="e197">A Record of the Patriotic Girls' School Welcoming New School Directors <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>The Patriotic Girls' School was founded thirty years ago and is the oldest. Since moving to the new school building on Jiangwan Road last year, it has been actively expanding and striving to improve. It is currently adding a sheltered playground, offices, classrooms, and dormitories, and is building mountains with stones and ponds on the campus, with prosperous flowers and trees and abundant peach and plum trees. The future development is immeasurable. Recently, Mr. Chu Minyi was invited to be a school director. A welcome meeting was held at the school at 3:00 PM on the 28th of last month, and Mr. Chu was invited to give a speech. The speech was very long and cannot be fully recorded. I will extract some of the interesting points to fill this talk.</p>
<p>▲ Listening to Lectures and Going Home: The day was a Saturday, and there were no classes after noon. Students were either going home, visiting friends, or shopping, and their luggage was ready. The school issued a temporary curfew, and no one was allowed to leave the school except for special circumstances. So, there was no choice but to listen to the lectures at school.</p>
<p>▲ Tang Monk and Lama: Mr. Chu arrived at 3:30 PM, full of energy. He first wore a black hat that was flat in the middle. Some said he looked like Tang Monk, and others said he looked like a Tibetan Lama.</p>
<p>▲ Roses and Weeds: Mr. Chu said that although China has four hundred million people, too many are illiterate. The reason is that girls' schools are not developed, and children have no opportunity to learn to read in the home. The quality of a person is half due to innate factors and half due to acquired factors. He took the roses made of paper that were placed on the table as a metaphor. Those who are good innately are like good seeds, and those who are good acquired are like fertile planting ground. Only when both are good can there be beautiful flowers. If parents are ignorant and uneducated, it is already a bad seed. If children are born and not educated, they will become a bunch of weeds. How can China not be in a mess if three hundred million of the four hundred million compatriots are weeds?</p>
<p>▲ Father's Fault and Mother's Fault: Educating children is the duty of citizens. Excellent children should be educated by their parents personally and should not be entrusted to nurses. If they have no power to raise or teach, it is best not to have children. The Three Character Classic says, "It is the father's fault not to educate." Now we can add a sentence: "It is the mother's fault not to raise."</p>
<p>▲ Chopsticks and Hand Washing: If you want excellent children, you must pay attention to family education and cultivate good habits. You must pay attention to and correct children's every move. Otherwise, habits will be difficult to change for life. For example, if you don't pay attention to holding chopsticks when you are young, you may not be able to do it properly even after you grow up. The use of chopsticks in China can be said to be the most convenient. By using them, you don't have to wash your hands when you eat because your hands do not come into direct contact with the food (note: this is true for eating rice in the south, but not for eating steamed buns in the north, which requires direct use of hands). Westerners originally used their hands, but then they used forks, and eating bread requires direct use of hands, so they must develop the habit of washing their hands before meals.</p>
<p>▲ Good Morning and Good Night: Etiquette is also very important. Whether classmates or teachers, they must greet each other when they meet. Westerners say good morning and good night at home, which is learned from childhood and has a great relationship with emotions.</p>
<p>▲ Royal Way and Hegemonic Way: The sports in schools now are mostly imported, such as track and field, soccer, and basketball, which are either too intense or too expensive, and require a large number of people and a large venue. They are not possible for everyone. National skills are gentle, frugal, and can be practiced by anyone, with few drawbacks. Western methods are mostly hegemonic, while national skills are mostly royal.</p>
<p>▲ Exercise and Definition: The definition of movement is to unblock the blood, and the definition of exercise is to move the muscles and bones.</p>
<p>▲ Tai Chi Quan and Tai Chi Exercises: Tai Chi Quan is an internal skill for boxers and is very beneficial to people's health, but it is too complicated, and most people are not patient enough to learn it. Therefore, we take its meaning to create Tai Chi exercises, which are simple and clear and can be explained with books. The movements are not complicated and easy to remember, and both old and young can practice them.</p>
<p>▲ Students and Teachers: After the lecture, we went to the playground together. First, the physical education students performed national skills, and then Mr. Chu performed Tai Chi exercises and Tai Chi Quan. After the performance, Mr. Chu nodded and smiled amid applause.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Ways of Loving <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Zi</p>
<p>In old Chinese novels, the men depicted in love stories are like Jia Baoyu, and the women are like Lin Daiyu. Or the men are like Fang Qing, and the women are like Chen Cuie. In short, the men must be effeminate to win the women's affection, and the women must naturally be frail to be even more endearing.</p>
<p>However, the men who are infatuated with Western beauties are like those in the novels of Hall Caine, such as the knight, Greeg, who are heroic, valiant and show the unique greatness of men. From the Middle Ages until now, although those knights in crested helmets and with swords have become historical figures, their influence has not faded away. Ordinary sports stars and even striving warriors still retain their supreme glory and often provide passionate fuel for humorous love stories.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the perspective of films, in the West, whether it's Valentino, Colman, Ramon Novarro, Charles Farrell, or Charles Rogers, in 90% of the love films, the male protagonist is a hero, or they all believe that this is the way to express the "life force of love."</p>
<p>In China, however, it is not the same. Although the style of Chinese films is different, I have seen that the male protagonists in many love films are often a rich young master or a writer or artist. Therefore, some people say that the Chinese Carmen would never fall in love with a bullfighting strongman, and this statement seems quite believable.</p>
<p>However, the wheel of time is rolling toward the peak of strength. That kind of weak love depiction has obviously lost its life stimulus. From the perspective of films, some chaotic and unbearable martial arts films, although also very stimulating, have unfortunately lost the spirit of the times. What we expect now is that kind of spiritual and powerful impact that jumps out of the circle of affectation and artificiality—the impact of love and strength.</p>
<p>Here, I cannot help but like the success of the recent domestic film "Three Arrows of Love," which was produced by the Star Film Company. Although it does not have a modern setting, it is rich in a spirit that surpasses modernity, and the male and female protagonists in the film are all typical heroes in our ideal. This is bound to give us new stimuli after we watch the way of love depicted in this new film.</p>

<p>▲Gandhi's Triumphant Song: Without fists or courage, unadorned and barefoot (Gandhi, bare-chested, only draped in a homespun cloth), a dwarfed and hunched old man of a subjugated nation actually defeated the world's first-class British Empire with its naval, land, and air forces. This is an unprecedented spectacle in the history of all mankind. Since Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of the Indian National Congress and a sage, announced a policy of passive resistance against the British government last year, he has been imprisoned again, causing shock at home and abroad. The British government specially convened the London Round Table Conference, allowing Indian delegates to attend to discuss federal autonomy. Participants included hundreds of representatives from various Indian princes, sectors, and levels. However, the final resolution still required the approval of this uncrowned king, the highest authority who had just emerged from prison. Gandhi, from being a prisoner, suddenly became a guest of honor, engaging in equal talks with the British Empire's representative, the Governor-General of India. On February 4th of this year, the two sides signed a treaty. The British Empire recognized the abandonment of its right to rule over India's internal affairs and abolished centuries-old traditional policies such as the salt monopoly. Most party members were returned their confiscated property, and freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and all political criticism were restored. The right to peacefully boycott British goods was recognized as a legitimate act. Thus, Gandhi declared a temporary cessation of the non-cooperation movement but continued to demand complete independence from Britain and petitioned the native princes to open up their political power and implement democracy. This was Gandhi's first great triumph in his life and a major symbol of the resurgence of Eastern national culture. According to reports, on the day of the signing of the treaty, Gandhi rose before dawn and led his disciples in raising their hands to the sky in prayer as usual, remaining silent for half an hour. As the morning light dawned, suddenly a loud roar resounded like the collapse of the sky and the stampede of ten thousand horses. Tens of thousands of adoring elderly, young, men, and women outside the group eagerly cheered, vying to catch a glimpse of his moral character and listen to his legal pronouncements. Gandhi is truly a remarkable and outstanding figure!</p>
<p>▲Einstein's Farewell Dinner: Since the great German scientist Einstein came to America last winter, he has been deeply researching the principles of the universe and revising and re-publishing the theory of relativity. On the other hand, he has also been wandering in the mountains and rivers, indulging in literature and wine, spending about a hundred days living and playing on the Pacific coast. Now, on March 4th, he is taking advantage of a German ship to return to his country from New York. Various circles and groups held a grand farewell ceremony as if for a king. Einstein himself said, "No one dares to accept such kindness." This is not just a humble remark. Einstein, being Jewish, the New York tycoons, three-tenths of whom belong to the Jewish community, specially initiated a farewell banquet before his departure, with each person's seat fee being one hundred US dollars. After deducting expenses, all the proceeds were donated to the new Jewish colony in Palestine. That evening, more than a thousand people attended, raising 100,000 US dollars in cash in one fell swoop. Einstein gave a speech using a radio broadcast, praising the achievements of the Palestinian colony over the past ten years, and said that the conflict between Jews and Arabs should be resolved through joint negotiation by the two ethnic groups and should not rely solely on the British government's guarantees and mediation. His words indirectly expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's current policy towards Palestine. It is recalled that when Einstein first arrived and gave speeches advocating peace movements and urging citizens to reject military service, he was fiercely opposed by the American warlords, leading to proposals to deport him. Einstein is indeed rich in human sympathy and is not only a cold-headed astronomical expert. Very few people can understand the theories he has published, and when asked why, Einstein smiled and said, "I am not a psychologist and am ashamed that I cannot provide an answer for others."</p>
<p>▲Mussolini's Demonstration: Italian Prime Minister, Fascist Party dictator Mussolini, with his fierce and decisive style, is unparalleled for a time. Although his personality differs from that of the Soviet Union's Stalin, who is deep, formidable and ruthless, their capabilities are evenly matched, and their spheres of influence are almost evenly divided in the world. Last month, an American admiral gave a speech at a tea party in Philadelphia, saying that Mussolini had once run over a girl with his own car. A wealthy American in the car asked to stop to check on her, but Mussolini laughed and said, "When we deal with the world, we only move forward and do not look back. Moreover, what is the life of one person worth?" When this statement was spread, the Italian ambassador to the United States received a telegram from Mussolini instructing him to demand concrete evidence from the US government. The US Secretary of State was immediately alarmed and at a loss and telegraphed an apology to Mussolini and ordered a military court to try the admiral for making the remarks. The American public was in an uproar, and members of Congress also raised questions, ridiculing it as a humiliation to the nation. The US Secretary of State, based on the admiral's self-defense, stated that it was hearsay and only said at a tea party, not daring to openly insult an important figure from a friendly country. The military trial was changed to a reprimand, but a formal apology was made to Italy. Mussolini was also complacent. Afterwards, the US Assistant Attorney General made a speech, saying, "Recently, the cost of living has been increasing, and the official salary is not enough to cover expenses. Fortunately, I was not born in Italy, otherwise, one word from the Prime Minister would not only not increase my salary but also reduce it, and my family's livelihood would be even more difficult." Mussolini again telegraphed the Italian ambassador to interrogate the Assistant Attorney General, who then published an explanation in the newspaper the next day, expressing that there was no criticism. Mussolini then chose not to pursue the matter. It is said that one sees the rabbit in three days, and it transforms into a lion or an elephant. It is also said that a fierce tiger in the mountains does not gather wild herbs. Mussolini's external arrogance is so strange!</p>

<h3 id="e200">Numerous Fluctuations in Gold Market <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Complex and unpredictable situation. Yesterday, April 2nd, the gold market saw broad fluctuations and a complex situation. In the early morning session, it hovered around 720 taels. Later, it briefly rose above 730 taels before falling in the afternoon. There was a total fluctuation of 15 taels for the day. In the end, it slightly rose, and the unpredictable situation was uncontrollable. People were anxious, and the foreign exchange market was both tight and unclear. The listed price was already reduced by one level, but the market demand from major players was very different. Despite a slight drop in the overseas silver market, the gold price was unaffected and instead went in the opposite direction, opening lower and then being heavily short-covered by Yuansheng and others, causing it to reach a peak, soaring by more than 10 taels. Later, due to selling activity, it retreated to the 30-tael mark. The after-market seemed to be in a stable state with no special good or bad news, with only a difference of two or three taels between various firms. The cashiers of various firms were not affected. It seems that the exchange rate was also stable. The final calculation was between 26 taels. Today (3rd) is the start of a four-day holiday, so there will not be much trading volume. It is said that large bars may still see a decline.</p>
<p>Trend Shifts from Low to High. The market opened down 5.8 qian in the early morning session for May delivery, calculated at 719 taels. Although large bars fell by a quarter and silver prices fell by 0.85 qian, the market was sluggish, and private telegrams also decreased by 0.86 qian. Therefore, people's confidence was down. Subsequently, the fluctuations were confusing, with a fluctuation of about 5 taels. It fluctuated from 24 taels back to 19 taels. Various firms, Yuansheng, Hengxing, Yuanfu, and Chang all entered, while Tongtaichang exited. After 9:15, buying was strong, and it immediately rose. At 9:30, when the British gold price was announced at 27.5 taels, the listed price had already been reduced by 1.25 US dollars by 0.25 qian, and the daily gold price increased by 1.5 fen. Not long after, it retreated to 25 taels. As another firm sold, the internal British gold price was flat. Mitsui once sold 1.3375 million, then turned to increase, and Mitsui and others absorbed spot. Dalian absorbed 1.5 qian and 9.25 fen per tael, and also absorbed June British gold at 1.875 million. Yuancheng, Xinheng, Qianchang, Xiangyuan, Maoyong, and Fuchang all rushed to buy, so the price actually broke through the 30-tael mark and opened up to 33.8 qian. Anda and others ate up 1.25 million June British gold before suddenly turning soft. Because Shunli, Hengxing, Yuanwanxing, Qianchang, Xiang, and others came to the market to sell, it immediately dropped to 30 taels and 5 qian. Around 10:20, the British gold price was reduced by 1.25 US dollars by 0.24 qian, and the daily gold price increased by another 1.25 fen. However, the market was flat at this time, with the gold price only calculated at 32 taels. Later, because Yuanxing, Yongcuichang, Yongyongfeng, and hedging and others sold, it fell by more than 5 taels. It was also difficult to sell British gold with an increase of 1.25 qian. Huabi, Mitsui, and Makali bought 1.875 million. Near 11 o'clock, it dropped to 26 taels and 5 qian. Later, because Yuancheng and others continued to short-cover, it rose to 30 taels and 78 qian at 11:30. At this time, Wanxing and others sold, immediately reducing it by 3 taels, calculated at 28 taels. At noon, it closed at 29 taels. The initial quotation was pressed down by about 50 taels, then changed to 784.22 qian, calculated to be down 556 qian.</p>
<p>Afternoon: Mediocre and sluggish trading. The afternoon opened with a small calculation of 27 taels, followed by 25.8 qian. As the Indian exchange rate was reported to be large, 1.2 ana ore, and buyers seemed to be more numerous, it rose to 28.5 taels. After 2:15, Zhifeng, Yongqianchang, and foreign speculators sold like clouds, losing more than 3 taels. At 2:45, it was 25 taels. After that, there was a hidden fluctuation of more than 1 tael until 3:20, when it began to improve. Yuanmaoyong, Fuyu, and others chased after the purchase. However, foreign exchange transactions were quiet, and near and far-term British gold traded at 1.33125 million, which could be concluded. At 3:30, it was 27 taels. After entering, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Shunli, and others sold, so it suppressed a small 2 taels. At 4:20, it was 24.7 qian. By 4:30, the market closed at more than 25 taels. There were many purchases, and it rose again to more than 26 taels. Compared to the previous day, it increased by 2 qian (according to the listed price). The highest price for the whole day was 33.8 taels, and the lowest price was 19 taels, a difference of 14.8 taels. For spot goods, the morning was 21.5 taels, the noon closing was 28.5 taels, and the afternoon closing was 25 taels. The quotation was calculated to be down 589 qian, which was 10 taels more than the previous day. The booked May was 29 taels.</p>
<p>Highly Inconsistent Trading in the Industry. The current month has ended. After clearing up the Pudong market at 25 taels in the afternoon and 21 taels, the transactions in various circles were calculated. Yuancheng and Xinheng covered short positions for about 3,400 contracts. Yuanheng, Fuchang, Qianchang, and Yuda all made deliveries. Hengxingyuan and Futaiheng initially entered and then exited. Shunli, Tongtaichang, Wanxingyongfeng, Yuanchengyong, Yuanxingyong, Changshengyong, Hengxing, and Zhifengshui largely sold. Fuyu, Yuantai, Yuanmaoyong, and Dadecheng had considerable delivery. It was heard that Wu was selling more long positions. In the afternoon, Chenfengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Fuyu, and Yuda all entered, while Wanxing, Daxingyong, Shunli, and Qianchang all exited. There were slight differences in the spot slips, and the transactions in various circles were not as large as the previous market. Dalian Gang sold a total of about 2,800 short positions, while entering 1,000 contracts. Guang Gang only sold 2300 contracts.</p>

Huabi, Mitsubishi, Huayi, Anda, Makali, and Mitsui all bought in, while Shanghai and Mitsui slightly bought in. Various banks also traded slightly with each other. There were few transactions in the afternoon because the bank was closed for four days from today. Therefore, the Chinese merchants were all holding a wait-and-see attitude. Also, US dollars were also rarely delivered, and daily gold was sold by Dalian Gang for several hundred thousand yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Fractional Currency Exceeds 5 Fen <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, the trend of fractional currency was very strong on the surface, but the content was still stable. The reason for this good upward trend was mainly due to the strong demand from outside. However, yesterday it felt tired and probably could not rise again. However, it was also impossible to fall.</p>

(Silver Exchange): In the early morning and noon markets, it fell again to 2 fen. The market was suddenly 3 fen smaller than the previous day.

The Guangdong small foreign currency was 6 qian, 3 fen, and 3 li and a half in the early morning market, and the same price in the noon market, with transactions made. 120,000 jiao were traded in the early morning market, and 90,000 jiao were traded in the noon market. Copper coins rose again, with 2,500 wen, calculated at 371,000 wen. The new long price from before has now appeared.</p>

Chinese merchants collected and released 2.3 million in ticket funds, foreign merchants collected and released 1.5 million in ticket funds, and various freight, tax, and other funds were collected and released for 9.67 million, with 800,000 being released from the warehouse.

<p>Slight Increase in Securities and Bond Prices, Continued Quiet Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai securities market and various bond market conditions saw only transactions of 8,000 yuan for the entire Sixth Compilation and Demobilization bonds. There were still no other transactions. There were continued fewer forward market transactions, and the market lacked vitality. The total turnover was calculated at 4.3 million in the morning and afternoon. The environmental conditions of the bond market remained unchanged. Bond prices were even more stable and close to the Qingming Festival. Securities must be closed for several days, so large investors were waiting and watching without moving. The fluctuations in the front and back markets of various bonds were very small. As a result, the 96 slightly fell, and others rose slightly by a few corners.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Yarn Market Difficult to Turn Strong <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with a very tired trend. Because overseas cotton yarn conditions were consistently trending downward, people's confidence was not high, and the selling pressure was particularly heavy. However, the exchange rate was greatly reduced, so some thoughts were still firm. The current yarn sales were still good, but there was a lack of large transactions. Therefore, most retail investors were consistently setting their positions. The current environment was bad, and the situation was declining. Some large merchants and those with real strength were not relaxing. Some foreign merchants were also buying. In short, the actual demand was not smooth, and it was difficult to stimulate people's hearts. It was feared that there would be a period of hovering.</p>
<p>The Man-Made Standard Rose in the Morning and Fell in the Afternoon: Although the overseas cotton fell and the gold price rose in the early morning opening of the man-made standard market, causing people's hearts to tighten again, each rose by 6, 8, and 9 qian. In the afternoon, upon hearing that the price of three-grade yarn was trending down and the actual sales were not smooth, people's hearts suddenly became empty, and each fell by 8 and 9 qian to 1 tael and 12 qian. The total turnover for the day was calculated at 17,850 bales. Shenchang sold 1,050 bales, Tianlong sold 500 bales, and Jifeng sold 900 bales. Meiji bought 950 bales, Yichang bought 800 bales, and Shengtail bought 600 bales. Tongyu bought 550 bales. The closing price is recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Cotton Market Trend Still Stable <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, but the trend was relatively firm. Because the base goods in various places were scarce, the source of supply was declining, and inventory was lacking. However, the overseas cotton market was very weak, and the market plate was trending down. People's hearts were slightly tired. However, the exchange rate was greatly reduced, and foreign cotton calculations were difficult to be cheap. Because of this, the Japanese merchants' thoughts were firm again. Dongmian foreign firms were re-purchasing, and the market atmosphere was relatively firm.</p>
<p>The Chinese Standard Was Smart But Then Tired: The Chinese standard market opened in the morning, and although the American cotton was tired, the exchange rate tended to shrink, and the market plate was relatively tight, with each month rising by 23 qian. In the afternoon, the market was not good due to the yarn market, and it fell by 23 qian again. The total turnover for the day was calculated at 35,000 dan. Taixing sold 2,200 dan, Xincheng sold 5,100 dan, and Tongxing sold 1,400 dan. Gongtai bought 5,800 dan, Jifeng bought 1,800 dan, Yichang bought 3,000 dan, Heshen bought 1,200 dan, and Tianlong bought 1,800 dan. The closing price is listed below.</p>

<p>Grains: Ke Xian and Ke Hua Stagnant</p>
<p>Newly Arrived Foreign Rice Directly Transshipped</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market was sluggish because local merchants had not inquired for many days, and the market appeared even more stagnant. The Jiangxi rice purchased by Pu Hu a few days ago was being offered for sale at a discounted price because there was no further development in the market, but the local market had no intention of inquiring, and the Ke Bang had no appetite. Although they wanted to sell, there was no buyer, so the market price continued to fall. Yesterday, the local market responded to Jiangxi Ji with 300 packages at a price of only 10 yuan and 6 jiao and 4 fen to 06 jiao. The price was also slightly lower than the price sold the day before yesterday, with a difference of only a few jiao and more than 2 jiao. Furthermore, two small batches of foreign rice transported by Japanese merchants the day before yesterday and yesterday were directly shipped to various provinces in the north and south and along the Yangtze River because they were difficult to sell in Shanghai, so they have not yet been sold in the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Flour Market Fluctuates Greatly <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Soaring in the Morning...Plunging in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The Closing Still Looks Good...Turnover of 1.8 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw huge ups and downs in the morning and afternoon sessions, showing the full extent of the competition between the two sides. When the market first opened in the morning, foreign wheat was quoted at a small increase of two or three jiao, and outside long positions were still hidden. By the second session, the situation had become urgent. It was rumored that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in view of the smooth sales of factories, believed that foreign wheat had a great impact on Chinese farmers. With the new wheat about to enter the market, if continuous ordering was allowed, it would not be a good sign. Therefore, those who ordered in the future had to register in advance or be subject to prohibition. Once this was spread, the hearts of people inside and outside the industry (a small factory also rushed to replenish more than 100,000) suddenly became tense, and those who rushed to buy were extremely enthusiastic. The market also rose sharply, nearly four fen higher for near-term contracts and five or six fen higher for far-term contracts compared to the opening. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, people's hearts changed suddenly. The prohibition was not yet timely. The far-term contracts were related to a part of the market, and the near-term chips had been determined, so it was still necessary to see how the actual sales were. Therefore, floating shorts became very active again, and factories such as Fufeng and Xinda took the opportunity to sell in large quantities, causing the market to plunge again. The total transaction volume for the day reached more than 1.8 million, which shows how lively it was at the time. However, the closing result still looked good, with April up 2.5 fen, May up 2 fen, June and July up 1.75 fen, August up 1.5 fen, and September up 2.25 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Speculation Heat in the Wheat Futures Market <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Several Ups and Downs...The Result Still Rose</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market for each month was stable because foreign wheat was quoted at a small increase of two or three jiao, and although people's hearts were good, they were still calm. Compared with the previous day's closing price, there was a difference of one or two fen. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, people's hearts became very tense. Taking advantage of the sharp rise in the flour market in the morning, those who went long and those who were eager to close out short positions flocked in, making the market extremely enthusiastic. Therefore, the highest opening price for this month was 3 taels 8 qian 9 fen, 3 taels 9 qian 2 fen for April, 3 taels 9 qian for June and July, 3 taels 9 qian 3 fen for August, and 3 taels 9 qian and a half for September. The excitement of the market can be imagined. Unexpectedly, the opening price of the second session was like fleeting clouds, leaving no trace. As the flour market had slightly turned down, the short positions of large traders also sold out, so the prices for each month immediately plummeted. The difference between the highest and lowest prices in the two sessions was as much as one qian, and as little as seven or eight fen. The intensity of speculative heat was rarely seen in recent times. Afterwards, each session generally revolved without any breakthrough. As a result, this month was up 4 fen compared to the previous day, May was up 5 fen, June was up 4 fen, July was up 3 fen, August was up 4 fen, and September was up in fen.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Steadily Rise</p>
<p>Japanese Sugar Initially Rises, Then Weakens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received a telegram from the producing area that the current price of Cuban raw sugar had rebounded by 1.5625 compared to the previous telegram. The prices of New York sugar futures for each month remained unchanged. The new price for March of the next year was 1.64. The current price of Javanese raw sugar remained unchanged. The buying price for April futures was down 1.25, May was down 2.5, and the new price for June was 8.125. The market in the association was even stronger because the foreign exchange rate suddenly rose and demand was slightly higher. The price of Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white sugar was 10 taels and 3 qian, with more than a thousand bags traded. The trend was still stable. Transactions of Japanese sugar were also still active, but there were quite a few shipments, and the market later declined. Z Mark 10 taels 1 qian and 5 fen, YT Mark 10 taels 1 qian 1 fen and 2 li and a half to 10 taels 1 qian, YRO Mark 9 taels 7 qian to 6 qian and a half, YP Mark initially 10 taels 3 qian and a half, but later also fell to 10 taels 3 qian, J Mark 10 taels 4 qian. The market gradually became stable.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Wufu White Ice Will Arrive Today <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the small amount of Wufu White Ice arriving and the Xiamen factory being out of production, there is not much stock in Shanghai. The stock had already run out the day before yesterday. After the agent telegraphed to urge shipment, it was reported yesterday that a batch had been shipped from the factory and would arrive in Shanghai soon to meet the sales needs of various gangs. If necessary, the factory will be restarted to avoid stockouts.</p>
<p>Silk, Tea, Sichuan and Han Cloth Prices Remain Firm</p>
<p>Recently, due to political disputes in Sichuan Province, the source of yellow and white silk head has been interrupted, and the French merchants' ventures have not changed. The stock in Shanghai is scarce, and the market is becoming stronger. Yesterday, Bailly Anqi and others imported 180 dan of Sichuan and Han cloth, with a price of 47 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Shanghai Factory Completely Shut Down <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port became even more silent because the overseas silk market did not rise. The telegraph price was slightly lower, and a labor strike broke out in a part of the silk factory in Zhabei. The factory owners were discouraged and the market was stagnant. Yesterday, only Xinfu imported 10 packages of white Da Jing silk, and Kechang and others imported 13 packages of yellow crude silk. The price was still flat and weak.</p>
