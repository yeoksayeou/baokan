<p>破殘宿貨出淸　自反日會成立提議對日經濟絕交後大會有十四日起不許日貨進口之傳布詎自此訊傳出後外埠各地深慮日貨不能來華乃乘此存貨尙未售淸之時紛紛來滬採辦大宗日貨運往各地備售日來滬地日商鑒於購買者衆一方將貨價抬高一方更將存積滬棧宿貨售與華人且須現欵購買即素有交易者亦須十日期支票方允售給購者但求有貨不計優劣遂使滬上劣貨竟能一掃而空故邇日日商咸喜形於色認為因禍得福云</p>
<p>長江輸出更多　昨日本埠公司之長江船出口所載貨物其中十分之六為日本貨而均係日糖紗布海帶等項甚至各華商江輪亦裝去不少滬上原存日糖九萬餘包今已全數運出此外南北洋輪之出口貨中日本貨亦占十分之四以上其擁裝原因緣各地商帮聞得上海於本月二十七日將開各業反日會自動抵制故乘此未開會之先提先趕運云</p>
<p>進口日貨續到　連日由東洋運來劣貨由摩耶丸·六甲丸·等輪裝到者已經卸在上海又有兩批由生駒丸·天城丸·及泰安丸·等裝載已在途中即日亦可進口長江方面則由近海社派十輪趕運直放九江漢口各埠此外三井川崎亦派輪載運至滬雖有十四日起禁止日貨之議而事實上仍源源運來也</p>

<h3>廢止浙江路塚地合同</h3>
<p>工部局不表同意</p>
<p>北浙江路阿剌伯斯脫路距特區地方法院不遠有同仁輔元保安兩堂義塜地一文門額書（保安堂名）至今短牆圍繞荒塜壘壘蔓草荒烟棄置無用市民經過者靡不同聲嘆息不知此中尙有一段歷史在焉</p>
<h3>工部局訂約經過</h3>
<p>按該地係二十五保二圖過字圩咸豐九年由輔元堂等向馬金海等價買計共二十九畝五分七厘四毫現丈見三十三畝一分三厘五毫緒十九年工部局曾思築路佔用旋由該堂立約不得在該地上再放棺材及暫放厝樞並由主持人打掃淸凈而罷至光光緒廿八年工部局又擬將該地建築華童公學並經串同一部分董事訂立售賣塜地合約經當時市民熱烈反對幾釀風潮乃由董事代購克能海路基地一方以為調換一面另訂合同其原文云上海輔元堂及保安堂各董事為將來保守輔元堂及保安堂之義塜地事今與工部局訂立合同現將議定各欵列左（一）今工部局旣允塗銷新近所訂之售賣輔元堂及保安堂之義塜地之合同嗣後輔元堂保安堂等董事永遠不得將該義塜地售賣或租與他人或將該地另作別用（二）此合同內彼此議定各欵業已登諸西報列入工部局西董會議各事內並登本埠各報俾衆咸知此事之實在情形又經立案以備查考再此番所訂之合同即作為以後永遠不准將該輔元堂及保安堂之義塜地作為別用之證據（三）輔元堂保安堂等董事現將該合同繕就兩份簽字以昭信實並蓋上海道臺及英總領事官之印以示此合同由地方官允准而後訂立者也西暦一千九百零二年一月初五日光緒二十八年十月初六日同仁輔元堂董事曹基善等</p>
<p>收回使用之動機　近年以來北浙江路地面日漸興盛該地估價當在銀一百萬元以上本市慈善團體財產整理委員會以為應改善使用而便增加收益發展慈善事業故由該會設計股詳細規劃提會議决呈局轉府向工部局交涉轍銷舊約再將該產用公開投標方法出租至塜骨仍當遷葬於鄕地</p>

<p>工部局意見　不允廢棄該合同而曾提議將該地闢為公園或一永久空地以免該處人滿之患蓋該處居民現已慮過多若復建商店及住宅則將來人數必增加萬數可意料也其意如在工部局收買該地作公園或草地之用以供市民游憩但尙無確實辦法聞社會局已將市政府令文轉行上海慈善團矣</p>

<h3>市教育局呈報教育局</h3>
<p>中學課程暫行標準試騐結果（一）</p>
<p>中小學課程暫行標準　自經教部頒布飭屬試騐以來已經年餘上海市教育局曾有中小學課程標準研究委員會之組織現奉部令催報試騐結果當復開會討論集本市各中小學試騐結果彙編報告除將小學部分已登前報外茲將中學部分全文錄後</p>
<h3>上海市試騐［中學課程暫行標準］</h3>
<p>結果報告</p>
<p>國文</p>
<p>第二　時間支配</p>
<p>（一）初中國文精讀指導時間應增至四小時［理由］據實騐結果精讀造文之形式較長內容較繁者每不能於三小時內完成一單元較短者則三小時又嫌稍長如是每週教材常相分裂若能增一小時則較長較繁者於本週內可完成一單元較短較簡者取兩篇連接之亦可於每週內告一段落况坊間規定每學期適用之教本大都有四五十篇之多平均每週當有兩篇之精讀指導其時間已屬不敷支配况再加以文法與修辭諸指示復請示題測騐默寫報告討論及檢閱筆記等成績之考查需要時間更不在少精此略彼實難兼顧故精讀指導似應每週有四小時之規定</p>
<p>（二）初中書法似應於國文課內另增一小時［理由］書法在課外練習因無臨場指導之機會學生殊不易進步似應在每週精讀略讀指導及作文練習等每週六小時以外另增一小時之書法時間</p>
<p>（三）高中國文作文應每週作文一次於課內課外間一週行之［理由］按高中普通科課程標準第十四頁（三）作文練習（一）命題作文課堂內作文可養成學生作文敏捷的習慣和能力課堂外作文可養成學生作文詳密的習慣和儘量發抒的能力因此似應每週作文一次於課內課外間一週行之</p>
<p>第四　教材大綱</p>
<p>（一）初中國文教材各學年應稍增文言分量［理由］據學生學習狀態對文言選文觀感似較深切背誦方面文言文內尤易收效而初中為培植學生文言技術之基礎時代文言教材茍能不過分减少則受訓練之機會亦較易得也</p>
<p>英語</p>
<p>第二　作業要項</p>
<p>高中英語作業要項欄內關於耳口眼手訓練之程序配合尙佳但高中英語似宜特別注重眼手之練習［理由］高中英語科關於閱讀及寫作之能力宜多加訓練故眼手之練習較耳口之訓練尤屬重要</p>
<p>第三　時間支配</p>
<p>初中英語文法與讀本似應分別教學［理由］文法與讀本混合教學本合學習原理但試行以來其結果反不如分別教學得互相印證而有系統應將五小時英文規定為三小時讀本兩小時文法</p>
<p>第四　教材大綱</p>
<p>（一）高中英語教材大綱內容尙豐富但高一二普通科英語文法似宜列入［理由］高中三年級有修辭要則若一二年級不將文法單獨講授則造句與作文基礎不鞏固三年級之修詞要則即難學習矣</p>
<p>歷史</p>
<p>第二　教材大綱</p>
<p>（一）政治史料太多［理由］歷史功用重察往明今以過去人類生活學術思想之所得為改進今日人類生活社會事業之法本但按課程標準似偏重歷代政治史料故宜將該項史料力求緊縮增加民生史料學術思想史料　　（二）教材大綱應依目標所列以三民主義為中心思想［理由］歷史課程雖因有時代性難免不出於事實之平敘但宜有一中心思想以聯貫一切材料譬如我國現以三民主義為純一人民思想之標準而課程標準之目標項亦說以闡發三民主義之歷史的根源為宗旨故教材大綱不妨即以三民主義之由來或演進作一中心思想庶學者學有目的而史料亦不致散漫無所歸束</p>
<p>（三）太重編年系統［理由］高初中本國史及外國史課程標準均係依照時代先後順序敘述因此綜合分析兩法不便使用且古史大部分材料又不便與時事聯絡似宜打破編年體的編制而以人類生活上各種重要活動作為學習單元</p>
<p>（四）中外歷史應互相聯絡［理由］中國歷史與外國歷史固宜分別教學但於教學時不妨聯絡庶可使學者察知各國歷史之特色為比較的觀察分析綜合兩法並用養成有世界的眼光教材大</p>
<p>綱中似未顧到</p>
<p>（五）初中本國史向自上古講到現代但從教學上所得到之結果似有顚倒之必要假使自現代講到上古則非特收效較大且可避免教學上的困難不少［理由］一凡研究歷史者無不承認古代比較現代難離我們愈遠之歷史則愈難研究因為古史中應辨別其眞偽者甚多不得不帶一點考證而對於歷史無甚研究之人對考證最感困難此即上古史比現代史所以難讀之理由現在使對於歷史較少研究之初一學生反讀最難之上古史而使對於歷史較有學習之初二學生又讀最易的現代史如此難易倒置則教學上必感困難二凡研究歷史者都感覺愈古愈乏味因古代邈遠不易喚起想像且與我們現在生活相隔已久不易明瞭其中之關係而現代史則一如昨日之事容易喚起想像且感覺事關切身現在把乏味的上古史使初一學生讀則無異使正想登歷史堂奧者受到當頭一棒以後要使他們再發生研究歷史之興趣恐怕為難若把現代史做起點則旣可使學生對於歷史發生濃厚興趣努力向前探索又可使學生開始注意時事養成閱報習慣更可使學生由現代而近世由近世而中古由中古而上古層層向上研究以探求現狀的由來和當今各大問題的淵源三支配教材和預計時間固為教師最當注意之事但常以特別假期和別種原因打破支配和預計以致遺棄最後部份教授歷史亦不能外此常以時間不及而遺棄最重要之現代史若把現代史為起點則不至有此顧慮</p>

<p>華僑在朝鮮旣然處於優越的地位國內赴韓謀生者日見其多日本人見此情形就想出種種方法來限制華僑入口已入口的加以排斥或者指使一般日韓浪民欺侮華僑據說這班浪民常常在繁華之街當衆侮辱無端挑釁人非木石誰肯吃眼前虧又誰肯喪失國家的體面稍示抵抗馬上給他們罵一番打一頓你喊警察他袖手旁觀不來理會你只好揑起一把眼淚一把汗忍氣吞聲逃出他們的圈子就算了還到那裏去呌冤只為了祖國不振作有誰來保護你所以華僑在海外不能依賴家庭不能依賴國家只是「靠天吃飯」</p>
<p>朝鮮失業的人近年愈見增加總督府名義上為救濟失業的朝鲜窮民實際上是積極排斥我無辜華僑自本年四月一日開始提出經費總額日金六千五百萬元限三年完成計劃如在各道·郡·府·治水·修路·築港·等工程使朝鮮失業者·有工作做免得流為匪類擾亂地方且為鮮工設立互助機關制定限制使用華工的密令查此種密令不惟施行於各種官辦工程即個人包工事業也受同樣限制凡在通商大埠只許工廠使用華工五分之一以下而各道·府郡·鄕間地方警察當局以國內法為根據及自治團體的議案為口實濫發警察命令强制華工須領勞工許可證書纔能在其嚴格限制下作苦工·而領取許可證的條件又非常嚴酷例如（一）呈請許可書須用日文　寫（二）須先領得日醫健康診斷書（三）只許工作一年期滿須從新履行以上一切條件呈請許可證因此一般工頭及地主雖欲僱用價廉勤勞的華工被官署嚴酷條件所限制有愛莫能助的苦衷自此項密令頒佈之後華工紛紛失業流落異邦非常可憐吾國政府從未聞有何救濟之策不為華僑的生命計也不曾為國家體面計眞是極痛心的事實</p>
<p>日本人對我華僑旣如此苛刻我們當然把這種對等的條件還諸於彼在情在理並不為過據最近的調查華僑在日韓與日韓僑在華的比數如下</p>
<p>旅日華僑　　　二五、九六三人　　旅華日僑　　一五八、八六七人　　旅韓華僑　　　九一、四六六人　　旅華韓僑　　五九九、八九○人　（其中三之二為延吉·和龍·汪淸·琿春·撫松·安圖·等縣之韓僑人數即所謂間島地方為日人先鋒之韓僑餘三之一為間島以外散居於遼·吉·黑三省及各省之韓僑）</p>
<p>旅日韓華僑總數　一一七、四二九人　　旅華日韓僑總數　七五八、七五七人　　比較差數　　　六四一、二九七人</p>
<p>觀上數可知在中國謀生活的日韓僑民比我華僑在日韓謀生的人多六十四萬一千二百九十七人幾乎多出六倍以上此後除非雙方尊重平等互惠的通商條約否則我們决不能任彼虐待如牛馬而我則待之如上賓這種不平等的待遇我們决不能再容忍下去在中日新商約未訂以前希望吾外交當局對於此點及韓人入籍問題愼重考慮以謀一勞永逸的成效</p>

<h3>？？？（二六）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良暗想：誰要喝什麼茶？早知是我自己喝我也不必去倒了</p>
<p>「我不要喝！」</p>
<p>「一定要你喝！」</p>
<p>子良怕與伊爭就把茶一飲而盡</p>
<p>「開電燈！」</p>
<p>內務部的命令又下來了子良見確是天色暗了便走到門口把電燈一開。</p>
<p>「你去關照娘姨：我夜飯吃不下要稀飯」</p>
<p>子良好像是一個夫人的下僕儘伊差來差去他往樓下去對娘姨一說便回將上來到房中看看夫人神氣不像有病了他也放心便輕輕地到亭子間裏去開了電燈做他的公事今天一天工夫一共改了八九篇文章即使夜裏開夜車那一百六十多本一定難以趕完了至多可以去掉二分之一他也只得做多少算多少了子良把第一篇改到一半忽聽得房裏在怪聲呌喊：</p>
<p>「不好了！」</p>
<p>這是夫人的驚呌聲子良投筆而起趕到房裏見夫人已坐在床心用手指着衣架那邊：</p>
<p>「有鬼有鬼！」</p>
<p>伊的目光中現出恐怖之色似乎鬼就站住房裏</p>
<p>「別嚇別嚇！沒有什麼我在這裏」</p>
<p>子良雖安慰着伊依然驚呌：</p>
<p>「你看！那邊一個白鬼！」</p>
<p>「沒有！在那裏？」</p>
<p>「就在這裏！」</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Discussion of the Korean Incident</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting Reports on Negotiation Progress</p>
<p>Nanjing: At the 151st meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 18th, after discussions of various proposals, Committee Member Huang Youchang made a temporary motion, stating that the Wanbaoshan Incident and the anti-Chinese incidents in Korea were clearly organized riots, and Japan should bear full responsibility under international law. Japan has always adopted high-handed measures towards the Korean people, and accidents, once stopped, can be eliminated. The riots this time occurred simultaneously in Incheon, Pyongyang, Sinuiju and other places. If Japan could have stopped them, there would not have been such huge losses. Therefore, the background of this riot is very obvious. I would like to propose four points for the general assembly to discuss regarding this matter: (1) Translate the truth of the Wanbaoshan and Korean incidents into various languages ​​and announce it to the international community. On the one hand, request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to submit the Wanbaoshan documents to this Yuan, and the Yuan will appoint several members of the Foreign Affairs Committee to study them in detail. (2) Request the government to provide relief to the affected overseas Chinese and conduct serious negotiations with Japan until the goals of apology, punishment of the murderers, compensation, and guarantees that similar incidents will not occur in the future are achieved. (3) Request the government to clearly order the punishment of the instigators of the Wanbaoshan Incident. (4) Request the Control Yuan to impeach the Director of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office and the Chief of the Public Security Bureau. After Huang finished his proposal, Wang Yongbin spoke, saying that Committee Member Huang's proposal was generally agreeable, but before discussing this matter, we should clarify the truth and the progress of the negotiations by the diplomatic authorities in the past two weeks. Although we have recently seen news reports that the diplomatic authorities have lodged another protest with Japan, I believe that the results of the protest will not be very effective. Chinese diplomacy has always lacked a policy, and diplomatic personnel are often perfunctory, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. They usually do not pay attention to hygiene and do not take precautions beforehand, resulting in irreparable events after they occur. Therefore, I believe that what China lacks now is a diplomatic policy that includes hygiene administration. As for the initiation of the Wanbaoshan Incident, it was not accidental. Japan has long had a consistent policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia, provoking the relationship between China and Korea, making the Korean people recognize friends as enemies and thieves as fathers. Regarding Japan's aggressive behavior in this incident, did our diplomatic authorities foresee and prevent it? We should immediately request the diplomatic authorities to come to the Yuan to explain their policy for dealing with this case. Lu Zhiyi spoke, saying that Japan's despicable means in this Korean incident are undeniable. I propose that in addition to announcing the truth to the international community, the Wanbaoshan and Korean incidents should be handled as two separate cases to avoid falling into Japan's trap. Zhou Wei spoke, saying that Committee Member Huang's proposal is supported by all citizens, but at a time when the government is conducting negotiations, should this Yuan, as a legislative body, express something? Please consider this carefully. Also, please note whether it is within the authority of this Yuan to request the Control Yuan to impeach the Changchun officials. Next, Peng Guang spoke, elaborating on this case. Finally, Wang Yongbin rose and asked the chairman to inquire whether the committees agreed with the request for the diplomatic authorities to come to the Yuan to explain the negotiation progress. The chairman then inquired about the opinions of the committees, and all committees unanimously agreed. Thereupon, Secretary General Li Xiaosheng immediately sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to attend the meeting to explain. At the same time, the chairman announced a recess of twenty minutes. At 11:10, Minister Wang arrived by car and the meeting continued. Since it involved diplomatic secrets, all listeners were asked to leave. After the chairman announced the resumption of the meeting, Minister Wang reported on the situation of the Wanbaoshan and Korean incidents, as well as the progress of the negotiations. After Wang's report, the committees questioned Wang extensively on the points he reported and the contents of the exchanges between China and Japan. Wang answered them one by one. Later, the committees believed that this case still needed detailed study and mostly advocated submitting it for review. Therefore, the chairman appointed Wang Yongbin, Huang Youchang, Shi Shangkuan, Shi Weihuan, Lu Zhiyi, Feng Yici. Peng Guang spoke, elaborating on this case. Finally, Wang Yongbin rose and asked the chairman to inquire whether the committees agreed with the request for the diplomatic authorities to come to the Yuan to explain the negotiation progress. The chairman then inquired about the opinions of the committees, and all committees unanimously agreed. Thereupon, Secretary General Li Xiaosheng immediately sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to attend the meeting to explain.

<h3>Wanbaoshan Case Begins Negotiations</h3>

<p>Nanjing: Zhong Yu arrived in Shenyang and began negotiations with the Japanese side on the Wanbaoshan case. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 18th reporting everything. Because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received a reply from the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, the protest against the Wanbaoshan case prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not been sent out on the evening of the 18th. Foreign Minister Wang had originally scheduled to go to Qingdao on the 18th, but now it has been cancelled due to the Wanbaoshan case.

The bodies of Chinese people were chopped into several sections and tied to poles in the streets. Furthermore, according to Mr. Li, a translator at the Chinese Consulate in Seoul, seventy-two Chinese people hid in a Chinese bathhouse, but the Koreans rushed in and killed seventy-one of them. The local officials here have now settled the refugees, providing temporary accommodation, food, and medicine, and providing funds for their return home. (Reuters Dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Shenyang Diplomatic Association</h3>
<p>Reply to the Korean United Association</p>
<p>Shenyang: The Diplomatic Association replied to the Korean United Association on the 17th, stating in essence that the Chinese and Korean nations not only have various close relationships, but also share the same environment of being oppressed and exploited. This unfortunate incident was entirely instigated and incited by a third party. The Chinese people have a very clear understanding and harbor no animosity towards the Korean people. The actions of the Japanese military and police will be negotiated by the government and seek a global verdict. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3>Korean Incident</h3>
<p>Japan's Responsibility</p>
<p>European and American Comments in General</p>
<p>Nanjing: European and Americans commented on the Korean case, saying that Japan must at least acknowledge its responsibility for inadequate protection, and the circumstances go beyond that. Today, Japan is still trying to shirk its responsibility for inadequate protection, which is not a good neighborly diplomatic attitude.

(3) Since our army launched the general offensive, it has fought fiercely with the Red Bandits for ten days. The bandits are elusive and use divisive tactics to exhaust our troops. Our army, on the one hand, responded calmly without pursuing them to the end, and on the other hand, completed the plan for a large encirclement with close coordination. When the Communist bandits realized that they were in our net, they had no way to escape. In recent days, all the armies have won great victories.

(Special Dispatch on the 18th) Nanchang: The military learned that after our army occupied Guangchang, they attacked forward. The area is very close to Shicheng, and the Mao bandits stubbornly resisted by taking advantage of the terrain. The Suo bandits shouted and helped.

On the afternoon of the same day, our army occupied Shicheng, cutting off the connection between the Communist bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi. Zhang Zhen and Liu Heding telegraphed that no more than 10,000 bandits entered Fujian. When Guangchang was captured, they tried to break through and escape, but were severely attacked by our army and more than a thousand bandits were killed. The left wing of our army entered Fujian and captured Jianning on the 16th. Sun's troops in the right wing also advanced to Dongshaogangyuan yesterday, encircling Ningdu on all sides.

Occasionally, there are special reduced freight rates for Chinese goods as part of our country's policy to encourage domestic production. Your country also often has this kind of practice, so it cannot be said to be unfair treatment. I am sorry that your request cannot be granted. Furthermore, Sangnam, an employee of the Japanese Railway Department's office in Beijing, visited Lian yesterday and today, hoping that various bureaus would consider employing Japanese engineers and consultants.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Researching Japan (I)</h3>
<p>The importance of researching the Northeast problem has already been stated by reporters in three articles. Now, let me raise another issue: researching Japan. Some might suspect my words, thinking that with national crises imminent, I am not proposing urgent countermeasures but rather focusing on discussing the Northeast and research on Japan, which is akin to drawing water from afar to put out a fire nearby—utter foolishness. It is indeed true that empty talk cannot resolve urgent difficulties when foreign threats are pressing. However, I believe that the reason why foreign threats are intensifying today is precisely due to our usual empty talk of saving the nation without seeking knowledge. Today, talking about researching Japan is the proper countermeasure, by no means unrealistic empty talk. Why do I say this? Please hear me out. Today, the Japanese problem of invading us does not lie in their invasion or our being invaded, but in how they are able to invade us and why we are being invaded. The former is the result; the latter is the cause. Understanding the cause is necessary to propose countermeasures. This is what Sun Tzu meant by "know yourself and know your enemy." Sixty years ago, Japan's territory was extremely narrow, and its national strength was particularly precarious, suspended in the Pacific Ocean, with internal strife constantly arising and foreign troubles intensifying daily. Its perilous state was like a lone boat in a stormy sea in the Pacific, perhaps even more so than our country's situation today. However, once they awakened and people from all levels of society united and vigorously sought reform, in sixty years, they leaped to become one of the world's five great powers, and then further leaped to become one of the world's three great powers, dominating East Asia and eyeing the globe. The world pays attention to them. How can we neglect such a newly rising nation with such vigor and ambition? China and Japan are separated by only a strip of water. Their invasion of us has been consistent for decades. The cession of Taiwan, Ryukyu, and Korea, the great humiliation of the Sino-Japanese War, the threat of the Twenty-One Demands, the devastation of the May 3rd Jinan Incident, and the recent occurrence of numerous cases—old pains and fresh wounds, countless scars. How can we, fearing our neighbor, allow ourselves to neglect them? The Japanese, in order to plot against us, first devoted themselves to knowing us, conducting extremely detailed research and investigation. Our geographical advantages, our national strength, our popular sentiments, our customs—everything about our secrets, even things we ourselves are unaware of, they know. Knowing us clearly, plotting against us becomes as easy as reaching into a pocket. The more they know us, the more precarious we become. However, our countrymen have remained indifferent to Japan for decades, never paying attention to them. They do not know their national power, do not know their geographical conditions, do not know their economic situation, do not know their popular sentiments. Therefore, every time the Japanese invade, with guns pointed at our heads and cannons pressed against our chests, our countrymen are like loaches thrown into boiling water, at a loss for what to do. Once like this, and then again like this. If our countrymen had earlier conducted in-depth research on Japan, understanding their secrets and knowing their national power, then we could have exploited their weaknesses and avoided their strengths. How could our country have repeatedly relied only on composure and self-restraint without appropriate countermeasures? How could we have watched their invasions, once, twice, and continuously, without being able to resist? Therefore, the reason why we cannot resist Japan today is because we do not know Japan, and the reason why we do not know Japan is because we did not study them earlier. How apt are Mr. Cai Yuanpei's words: "[Japan is our neighbor, of the same race and culture. If there is no emptiness in the house, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will quarrel. The thicker the neighbor's foundation, the thinner ours becomes. This is the reason for mutual jealousy between China and Japan. Brothers may quarrel at home, but they unite to resist external insults. This is the reason for mutual amity between China and Japan. Sun Tzu said, 'Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle.' Those who are jealous of Japan cannot be ignorant of Japanese history and records. Those who seek amity with Japan cannot be ignorant of Japan. If you want to know, you must study. Therefore, studying Japan is our urgent task today."] Are there any countrymen who doubt the importance of studying the Japanese problem? Ponder carefully the words of Mr. Cai.</p>

<p>Newspapers Must Not Arbitrarily Criticize the Government</p>
<p>Bank Depositors' Withdrawals Subject to Restrictions</p>

<p>Iron-Fisted Prime Minister Resolutely Supports the Precarious Situation</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, July 17th: Around 10 PM tonight, Prime Minister Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius left Germany for France. Thousands of people gathered spontaneously at the Berlin train station. Members of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party were keen to incite unrest, so the police had to work hard to maintain order. Brüning and others safely departed amidst cheers and curses. Before leaving the capital, Brüning convened an emergency cabinet meeting, attended by numerous cabinet members and the president of the National Bank, Luther, to determine Germany's approach in the Paris and London meetings. This is the first time a German prime minister has visited France since Bismarck. Before his departure, three government parties and two opposition parties jointly issued a final warning, urging him to firmly reject French political demands. They vowed to jointly overthrow any German cabinet that accepted such humiliating demands. Brüning and Curtius boarded the train in this tense atmosphere, looking exhausted from sleepless nights. They are expected to arrive in the French capital tomorrow morning. Regarding their attitude towards French political demands in Paris and London, the warnings from German political parties provide a good indication.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, July 17th: German Prime Minister Brüning today issued a statement to the people, stating that he and Foreign Minister Curtius are now going to Paris with a firm determination to exchange views so as to prepare for cooperation and create a clear tool for international unity. Semi-official circles believe that the German authorities' visit to Paris is a new step towards closer Franco-German relations. If the first contact merely clarifies the atmosphere to facilitate better mutual understanding, it will be satisfactory. Brüning will clearly state the nature and scope of the aid Germany hopes to receive from France. Tomorrow, French and German negotiators will meet alone, and British and American representatives will join them on Sunday. (Received National News Agency Telegram) It is unexpected that Foreign Minister Briand will also be invited to participate, as he will be passing through Paris on his way to London. The timing of the departure of the dignitaries from France to England has not yet been decided, as the French authorities insist on not rushing to England until the Franco-German meeting has made some progress. Reuters, Berlin, July 17th: The German government issued emergency decrees today: (1) All government announcements must be published free of charge by newspapers. Newspapers that attack the government are not allowed to publish critical comments in the same issue in which they publish rebuttals. (2) From next Sunday to Thursday, savings banks can pay out 20 marks per person per day to depositors. Account holders can withdraw 100 marks per day, with a transfer limit of 15,000 marks. (3) All those who have deposits abroad must report the actual amount, and those who violate this will be imprisoned and deprived of their civil rights. Those who voluntarily report their overseas deposits can enjoy relief from overdue debts. (Received National News Agency Telegram) Furthermore, according to Dr. Treviranus's radio broadcast, the government is now planning to issue another emergency decree limiting German citizens leaving the country to paying a tax of 100 marks per person. The intention is to limit Germans from traveling to foreign tourist destinations, which causes capital outflow. In fact, the current German cabinet has become a dictatorship, using the president's emergency decrees to obtain unlimited power to deal with the current crisis. The orders can manage banks, newspapers, securities, commodity markets, and even the lives of the people. (Translator's Note: French newspapers have called Brüning an iron-fisted prime minister, comparing him to the iron-fisted Chancellor Bismarck, showing his firm and decisive ability to support the precarious situation.)</p>
<h3>Three Countries Lend to Germany</h3>
<p>Reduced from 100 Million to 80 Million Pounds</p>
<p>Germany Determined Not to Accept Tariffs as Collateral</p>
<p>European and American Securities Markets Improve</p>
<p>National News, Paris, July 17th: French, British, and American leaders continued to meet this morning at 11:00 to discuss the issue of lending to Germany. The amount has been reduced from 100 million pounds to 80 million pounds, with an interest rate of 3% and repayment in 10 years. However, they still want to use tariff revenue as collateral and establish an international committee to supervise its use, which is expected to be rejected by the Germans. After the meeting, the French Prime Minister issued a statement summarizing the discussion of Germany's financial situation, stating that further progress will depend on further negotiations after the German authorities arrive in France tomorrow. National News, Berlin, July 17th: Yesterday's slight optimism among Germans regarding the international meetings in Paris and London has turned into doubt today. This is because France is demanding that any loan to Germany must be secured by tariffs to the international community, and they want to establish a committee to manage it. The German government has indicated that it will definitely not accept this condition. It should be remembered that the cancellation of the Young Plan last year and the removal of the tariff collateral in the Dawes Plan were considered one of the greatest successes by the Germans. How can they be willing to be restrained again at this time? However, it is now reported that due to German opposition to this move, alternative collateral is being discussed. Some have suggested that Germany establish a tobacco monopoly and use its revenue as collateral, which is one of the strategies. It is now believed that the greatest concession Germany can make to French political demands is to postpone the Austrian customs union for one year and suspend the construction of the third pocket battleship. The first of these cruisers has already been launched, the second is still in the preparation stage, and the third has been designed but not yet budgeted. Reuters, London, July 17th: The British government has not yet received an official letter regarding the French claim of lending 500 million yuan in international loans to Germany with tariffs as collateral. This proposal requires careful study in all aspects and will likely be discussed at the meeting on Sunday. National News, London, July 18th: The American government's rejection of the original conditions proposed by France for assisting Germany has now become a major topic in political and press circles. The Daily News expects that the British authorities will also take the same approach because the British people, regardless of political affiliation, unanimously oppose forcing Germany to become an economic slave. The Daily Telegraph's political correspondent claims that powerful figures in London have expressed disapproval of France's plan to have the Bank of France contribute the most to the loan to Germany, believing that it is inappropriate to allow one country to dominate everything due to its larger contribution. Reuters, London, July 17th: The financial outlook is more optimistic today, as can be seen in the markets. The London stock market opened with good sentiment, which did not weaken by closing. British securities were particularly firm, and German securities also rose. The atmosphere improved due to the hope for the international meeting in London on Sunday and the continuation of informal talks in Paris. National News, Paris, July 17th: The Paris Stock Exchange closed with high spirits, and prices rose across the board.

<h3>Japanese Goods Rushed to China</h3>
<p>Attention Should Be Paid Amid Economic Boycott</p>
<p>National News, Tokyo, July 18th: Japanese merchants are now planning to take advantage of the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods not being fully implemented to ship as much cargo as possible to China. Therefore, Nippon Yusen Kaisha has decided today to reroute several ships that were sailing to other ports to the Sino-Japanese route. In the coming weeks, Japanese merchants will import large quantities of cotton, wool, and sugar to China. It is now believed that the expected long-term increase in silver prices is also one of the reasons why Japanese merchants are increasing exports to China.</p>

<h3>The Red Peril and China's Survival</h3>
<p>— (Yang Xingfo)</p>
<p>Since the Xinhai Revolution, although the Qing Dynasty was quickly overthrown, the ideals of the revolution have yet to be realized. In the past twenty years, there have been countless internal wars between warlords, and between warlords and revolutionary forces. Now, before the task of unification is completed, the unprecedented Red Peril in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan has become a prairie fire. People are accustomed to hearing about internal wars. Those who reside in bandit areas and suffer firsthand pain cry out in agony, while those who are fortunate enough to live in Jiangsu and Zhejiang or reside in concessions mostly view it with indifference, as if they were Yue people viewing Qin people. They do not realize that today's Red Army, backed by the Third International and Soviet Russia, has a strict party-government-military organization. Killing and arson are planned, and rape and plunder have become doctrines. They are by no means comparable to the bandits of past dynasties or the warlords of recent times. Can a moribund and collapsing patriarchal society possibly escape this cruel and rigorous Red influence? Therefore, although today's Red Peril is concentrated in Jiangxi and spreading to neighboring provinces such as Hubei and Hunan, the hidden danger is actually pervasive throughout the country. At a time when foreign aggression is rampant, there is also the danger of Red infiltration at the core. The survival of the nation hangs by a thread. I hope that my compatriots who live in peace and prosperity will spare some time from their leisurely pursuits to deeply contemplate this situation.</p>
<p>In the past, the people's ignorance of the Red Peril cannot be solely blamed on their slowness to react. The government and the military also cannot shirk their responsibility for inaccurate reports that concealed the truth and glossed over the situation. This kind of dishonest propaganda not only gave the people a false impression but also often became the main reason for the military's failure to suppress the Red bandits. When Liu Jianxu, the commander of the Hunan division, was in charge of pacifying the Red bandits in Pingxiang and Liuyang, he issued nine points of instruction to all anti-bandit troops in the province, the first of which was: [False military intelligence is a bad habit of the military. Recent investigations have found that all the reports of victory in engagements between the army and the bandits are often fabricated and exaggerated. They either claim to have seized a certain number of guns or to have annihilated countless bandits. However, when verified against the facts, they are often inconsistent. The military must rely on intelligence to plan its operations. False intelligence will inevitably lead to misjudgment and hinder military progress. This should be emphasized and heeded.] The news reported on June 20 of this year [Commander-in-Chief Chiang ordered that the military dispatches from various anti-bandit units mostly report victories and no defeats, and that the higher-level officials are separated from the actual situation of the bandits due to false reports of military intelligence, which makes it difficult to make decisive plans. On the 28th, he strictly ordered all troops to earnestly correct this.] All of these are sufficient proof of the failure of anti-bandit propaganda in the past. The spread of the Red Peril is more than enough to bring about the downfall of China. Although the superficial suppression depends on the military's force, the fundamental clarification will not succeed without enlightened politics and a sound society. Moreover, it is even more essential to awaken the masses to face the great crisis together and achieve the effect of nationwide fortification and resurrection.</p>
<p>A brief history: The rampant rise of bandits and rebels is a natural product of political changes and social chaos in past dynasties. In the Han Dynasty, there were the Green Forest and Red Eyebrow rebellions and the Yellow Turban Rebellion. In the Tang Dynasty, there were the rebellions of Wang Xianzhi and Huang Chao. In the Song Dynasty, there were the exploits of Song Jiang and his thirty-six followers. In the Yuan Dynasty, there were the Red Turban rebels. In the Ming Dynasty, there were the roving bandits of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong. In the Qing Dynasty, there were the White Lotus rebels in Sichuan and Hubei and the Nian rebels. The smaller ones caused temporary disasters and devastated the people, while the larger ones led to the downfall of dynasties and the change of dynasties, becoming the main cause of the rise and fall of generations. However, at that time, Chinese culture was superior to neighboring ethnic groups. The outbreak of banditry was mostly due to overpopulation, agricultural disasters, or government mismanagement. No matter how the social order was destroyed, there was no conflict or change of thought and system. Therefore, the so-called downfall of a dynasty was actually the rise and fall of a royal family. Occasionally, foreign ethnic groups relied on force to enter and rule China, but they were eventually assimilated by Chinese culture. Once their military power declined, they collapsed and were overthrown. To seek a background that is complex, an organization that is strict, a foreign power like Soviet Russia as its external force, and the communism of Stalin as its ideal, and to destroy the military, political, and social organization of China in one fell swoop, like today's Red Peril, is truly unprecedented. This is especially something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution advanced from a racial revolution to a political revolution, aiming to eliminate the deeply rooted patriarchal society and the thoughts and institutions of feudal forces that had existed for thousands of years. This could not be accomplished overnight. The republican system under the rule of the Northern Warlords was still doubted by scholars and celebrities, let alone a higher political ideal. The Three Principles of the People began to be noticed by the Chinese people after the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in the fifteenth year of the Republic, but it still needs to be realized in the future to be deeply rooted among the people and manifested in facts. A nation must have a basis for its existence. Since the establishment of the Republic of China more than ten years ago, there has been no definitive highest political principle. The people have no firm political beliefs, and the result is today's anomalous society that is neither ancient nor modern, neither monarchical nor democratic. All economic organizations, moral concepts, and educational systems have followed it into a state of disintegration and collapse. In reality, today's China only has two paths: either to enter the Stalinist communism of plunder and slaughter, or to strive for the peaceful construction of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The development of the Red Peril can be divided into three stages. The first stage, from 1920 to 1923, can be said to be the period of utilizing the New Culture Movement. Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, and others received the mission and funding from the Third International and progressed from editing and publishing the "New Youth" magazine to running the "Guide Weekly," using the New Culture Movement to instill Soviet Russian communist ideas. Their achievements were more focused on society and neglected politics. The Third International嫌其迂緩 (was unsatisfied with their slow progress). At that time, the Chinese Kuomintang actually held the leadership of China's political revolution. The Third International then ordered Chinese Communist Party members to join the Kuomintang, which led to Joffe's visit to China and the reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang. The second stage, from the Kuomintang's reorganization and acceptance of the Communists in 1924 to the Kuomintang's anti-communism in 1927, can be said to be the period of stealing the Kuomintang's party power. Borodin secretly held great power as a guest minister. The Kuomintang party departments at all levels, the political departments of various armies, and local mass organizations gradually came under the control of the Communists. At the same time, they carried out their so-called policy of dividing the Kuomintang by sowing discord and alienating people. The Kuomintang, unable to tolerate it any longer, subsequently saw the Nanjing-Hankou government turn against communism in 1927. The third stage, from the Kuomintang's anti-communism to the present, can be said to be the period of armed rebellion. In July 1927, He Long and Ye Ting rebelled in Nanchang. In December 1927, the Guangzhou communist riots. In July 1930, the Changsha communist riots were the most brutal and conspicuous of the major uprisings. From 1927 to 1931, the small-scale uprisings suffered by the cities and villages of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces were too numerous to count. In Jiangxi, a total of 81 counties were affected. At the height of the Red Peril (according to a report at the end of 1930), 32 counties and one city were completely under communist control, 22 counties and one city were partially under communist control, and there were 20 counties where the bandits had not been cleared. In Hubei, more than 50 of the 69 counties had been harassed by bandits. In southern Hunan, about ten counties had been harassed by bandits. Anhui, Sichuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Henan, and Shandong also occasionally discovered traces of bandits. As for the results of their killing and burning, in Jiangxi province alone, more than 200,000 people were killed, more than 100,000 houses were burned, and the property loss was about 650 million yuan. In Hunan province alone, more than 70,000 people were killed, about 50,000 houses were burned, and the property loss was more than 15 million yuan. The number of people who died due to war and displacement and the loss of property are not included. The achievements of their uprisings and the speed of their spread are also alarming. As for the development of their forces, it is almost always related to internal wars. The Zhang-Huang War of 1927 was followed by the Guangzhou communist riots. The Zhang-Gui War of 1930 was followed by the Changsha communist riots. Last year, because the central military forces were concentrated in the north to suppress Yan and Feng, the Red bandits were able to calmly trample on the provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, expand their military strength, and occupy local areas. Therefore, to thoroughly suppress the Red bandits, efforts should be made to avoid internal wars.</p>
<p>The Party-Government-Military Organization of the Communist Party: After the Kuomintang's anti-communism in 1927, the Chinese Communist Party split into two major factions: the Stalinist faction and the Trotskyist faction. The Stalinist faction absolutely obeys the orders of the Soviet Russian Communist Central Committee and is a loyal believer in Stalin. It advocates (1) armed rebellion to establish a Soviet regime; (2) uniting with intellectuals, middle peasants, and small merchants (i.e., the petty bourgeoisie) to overthrow imperialism; and (3) transitioning from a worker-peasant dictatorship to a proletarian dictatorship. Its central figures are Qu Qiubai, Zhang Guotao, and Red Army leaders such as Zhu De and Mao Zedong. The uprisings in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan are all under the guidance of this faction. The Trotskyist faction supports Trotsky and the central cadres of Soviet Russia. It advocates (1) convening a national assembly to unite the masses and seize power; (2) seizing power with the proletariat to lead all classes and overthrow imperialism; and (3) the proletariat guiding and supervising the peasants to directly build a proletarian dictatorship. Its central figures are Chen Duxiu and others. The Stalinist faction calls this faction the liquidationist faction, saying that its advocacy of convening a national assembly is to eliminate class struggle. The Chinese Communist Party, which now holds real power, of course belongs to the Stalinist faction. Its party organization has established a central bureau in the Soviet Central District (this central district is currently in Jiangxi) to directly guide the special committees of the party in various Soviet areas. The special committees that have been established are the Xiang-E-Gan, Gan-Southwest (within the Central District), E-North, E-Yu-Wan, Gan-Northeast, Min-Yue-Gan, Guangxi Youjiang, and E-Xiang Border. Under the special committees are the district committees, which govern the county committees. Under the county committees are the city-district-township committees.</p>
<p>The Governmental Organization of the Communist Party: The highest organ is the Central Executive Committee of the Provisional Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic. Under it are the Xiang-E-Gan, Gan-Southwest (jointly called the Central District), Gan-Northeast, Yue-Gan, E-Yu-Wan, Xiang-E Border, Guangxi Youjiang, and Nanhai Island. The Soviet governments of the eight special districts. The special districts are equivalent to provinces and regions. Under the special districts are temporarily established county or independent city Soviet governments, which are directly managed by the special district Soviet governments. Under the county Soviet governments are the Soviet governments of various cities and townships. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Informal Contact Regarding the Wanbaoshan Incident</p>
<p>Japanese Consul-General Agrees to Telegraphically Withdraw Japanese Police and Summon Zhong Yushi to Shenyang to Discuss</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: After returning from Tokyo to take office, the Consul-General of Japan stationed in Shenyang, Hisajiro Hayashi, visited Zhang Zuoxiang's private residence at 10:00 a.m. on the 15th to express his condolences for the passing of Zhang's father. He then conveyed the wishes of Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara to China, saying that although the cabinet had changed, Japan's foreign policy towards China would not change. As for the Korean incident, it was a misunderstanding, and he hoped that it would not be amplified. He then clarified that he was informally discussing the Wanbaoshan case. Zhang Zuoxiang replied that because the Wan case had caused a major anti-Chinese incident in Korea, the Wan case could not be resolved locally at this time, but it would not be impossible if the Japanese side was willing to conduct preliminary negotiations locally. After obtaining the results, he would definitely ask for instructions from the Central Government. The first step should be for the Japanese side to telegraphically withdraw the Japanese police. Consul-General Hayashi accepted and immediately telegraphed to withdraw. It was then agreed that Zhong Yu, the special commissioner of Jilin, and Ishisha, the Japanese consul in Changchun, would come to Shenyang immediately to discuss a solution. Zhang Zuoxiang immediately sent an urgent telegram to the Jilin Provincial Government, ordering Special Commissioner Zhong to come to Shenyang as soon as possible. Japanese Consul-General Hayashi also telegraphed Ishisha to come immediately so that they could meet for discussions. (July 15)</p>
<h3>Citizens of Harbin</h3>
<p>Assist in the Wanbaoshan Case</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Issues a Circular Telegram</p>
<p>Various Organizations Hold a Joint Meeting</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Japanese police who invaded Majiashaokou are still entrenched there and have forced the Koreans to restore the waterways in the three districts since the 12th, which has greatly angered our farmers. When Zhou Yubing, the director of the municipal preparatory office, heard about this, he sent personnel to persuade them to wait for official negotiations. Thus, the second conflict was prevented from occurring. The Kwantung Governor of Japan awarded 300 yuan to the Japanese police stationed in Majiashaokou for their hard work and sent a telegram to commend them, so the Japanese police became even more arrogant. On the 11th of this month, the Japanese consulate transported three large carts of luggage and bullets for full equipment, so under this kind of situation, local negotiations have become impossible. The Changchun Civic Diplomacy Association believes that the case could have been resolved at the beginning, but Lu Qi, the director of the county public security bureau, was timid and procrastinated, which led to such a serious situation, so it telegraphed the provincial government to dismiss and investigate him. Regarding the negotiations on this case, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that the diplomatic commissioner Zhong Yu, specially appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Harbin, would negotiate. When inquiring at the office of the diplomatic commissioner, it was said that no formal order had been received. Even if an order was received, negotiations in Jilin and Harbin were still uncertain, because the location of the incident was in Changchun. Since Changchun could not negotiate, negotiations would have to be held in Jilin. It is not yet certain whether the Japanese side will send Jilin Consul Ishisha to be responsible. Zhong Yu has not yet obtained the details of the cause of the case and the previous negotiations and has already telegraphed the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office yesterday to transfer the entire case file to Harbin for preliminary reference and preparation. All circles in Harbin are extremely angry about the Wanbaoshan case and the massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea. The City Chamber of Commerce first issued a telegram to the central and northeastern authorities yesterday, requesting serious negotiations and expressing its willingness to be a supporter. The citizens have established the Harbin National Diplomacy Support Association for the Wanbaoshan Case and issued two declarations. The texts of the telegrams are recorded below: (A) To all compatriots in agriculture, industry, commerce, education, military, and police: Our country is in the position of a semi-colony, living under the iron hooves of various imperialists, and almost every day we are suffering from their trampling. The Northeast, because of its geographical location, has long been coveted by the insidious and vicious Japanese. In recent decades, because our country has swallowed its anger, the aggression of Japanese imperialism has become increasingly urgent, creating countless tragic events. At the same time, the Japanese forces in our Northeast are forming deep-rooted shapes, using resources to realize their so-called Manchurian centralism. In recent years, they have intensified their efforts and become more aggressive. The four railway proposals are enough to put us to death, and the occurrence of the Wanbaoshan Incident and the killing of overseas Chinese in Korea are the starting points for their pretext to seek opportunities to realize Manchurian centralism. It should not be regarded as a trivial matter. It is foreseeable that the great mountains and rivers will fall into the hands of foreigners, and our people will be destroyed and our families will be destroyed in an instant. The compatriots in important cities such as Changchun, Shanghai, Beiping, Liaoning, Tianjin, and other important cities have successively risen up to support and act as the backing of our country's diplomacy. Our Harbin City, as the key hub of the Northeast, is so silent and sits idly by while compatriots are brutally murdered, and willingly accepts the cold-blooded sarcasm of foreign countries, which is really heartbreaking. The colleagues of our association, as Chinese citizens of Harbin, have not yet cooled their blood and still have breath. We respectfully open our hearts and call out first. We think that all compatriots will be able to rise up and respond. If you do not forget the motherland and regard yourself as Chinese, please quickly unite with various circles to organize a support association for railway, Wanbaoshan, and Korean atrocities, etc., to fulfill the duties of citizens and benefit our country's diplomacy. At that time, our association will wholeheartedly help. Please unite together to do what we should do. The people unite together to implement national revolutionary diplomacy against Japan. Weak and small nations unite to overthrow imperialism and vow not to stop until the goal is achieved. (B) To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Liaoning Northeast Political Affairs Committee: In Changchun Wanbaoshan, unscrupulous Koreans destroyed our farmland. The truth is that there is nothing to be heard. Even if the Koreans are foolish and stubborn, how can they not know the truth? Why do they stir up trouble and overflow at once? Cities in that country have successively evolved into the massacre of overseas Chinese. The reed houses are in ashes, and the corpses are littered everywhere. The tragic situation makes those who hear about it weep. If there is no one behind them instigating them, the Koreans would never be so unscrupulous. They are using the opportunity to test and seek to achieve great desires in our country. The instigators have other intentions. If we still adhere to the ancient訓 (teaching) of forbearance for the sake of the country, will there be any end to the trampling of imperialists' iron hooves? At the time of composing the owl, one cannot help but shudder. We humbly ask you to be mindful of the survival of the nation. This is the key. Quickly make serious protests, punish the brutal, and comfort the injured, and ensure that no such unfortunate events will occur in the future. Otherwise, how can our divine Chinese descendants be willing to become slaves? Work together and vow to avenge this humiliation. If the government promotes it from above, the people will naturally respond from below. Even though merchants are weak, they should also rise up and fight together. Urgent petitions are made to express the feelings of the subject. Harbin City Chamber of Commerce 元(Respectfully) (July 14)</p>
<h3>Japanese Immigration Plan</h3>
<p>Before the Wanbaoshan Incident Occurred</p>
<p>Using Agricultural Development as a Starting Point</p>
<p>Over 2,250,000 Mu Have Been Acquired</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The fact that the Wanbaoshan incident, a minor matter in a corner, has brewed into a fierce anti-Chinese movement among the entire Korean people is not without reason. Japan's policy of aggression against Manchuria has always been supported by political and economic policies. In the late Qing Dynasty, its economic policy was limited to commerce. After the early Republic, it increased its use of industry, and after the European War, it paid more attention to agriculture. It felt pressured by the excessive population in its country and feared the lack of food, so it thought of Manchuria's vast area and fertile land, which were suitable for large-scale agriculture, and thus actively engaged in operations. However, because the right of inland business lease in Manchuria had not been recognized by the Northeast authorities, it was an obstacle to its immigration policy. Therefore, it first transferred the surplus population in its country to the leased territories of Lushun and Dalian and the areas attached to the South Manchuria Railway, making them pioneers in agricultural development. Years ago, the Dalian Agricultural Association was first established, funded by the South Manchuria Railway Company with 5 million yuan. It first purchased land owned by the people in places such as Pi Zi Wo and Pu Lan Dian by means of high-pressure coercion, and also set up agricultural training institutes in Changchun, Gongzhuling, and Xiong Yuecheng to train specialized talents in farming and cultivation for the purpose of nearby materials. Subsequently, the East Asia Encouragement Company was established in Shenyang with a registered capital of 20 million yuan and a paid-up capital of 5 million yuan. It purchased approximately 124,672 町步 (cho) of land in the three northeastern provinces, with 1,297 町步 (cho) of paddy fields and 6,440 町步 (cho) of dry land under actual cultivation. The number of lands purchased in the three northeastern provinces in the name of Japanese private individuals or organizations is also more than 2,259,000 mu. As for the land occupied in the name of Chinese or in the name of Sino-Japanese joint ventures, or in the name of mortgage leases, it is even more numerous. The following is a list of land purchased by Japan in the eastern provinces (excluding the leased territory of Guandong 表州 and the land occupied by the South Manchuria Railway):</p>
<p>Purchaser Acres Location</p>
<p>Nangong Fangjiro 1111 Yingkou Tutaizi, Gaiping Sankuaishi, Tieling Fanjiatun, Shenyang Wujiahuang, etc.</p>

<p>Mongolian Industrial Company 20013 Linxi area</p>
<p>Other 675000 (mu) Dagushan, Faku and other places</p>
<p>A total of 140,000 町, equivalent to our country's 2,259,000 mu. Last year, Japan established the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. After Minister of Colonial Affairs Genji Matsuda inspected Manchuria and Korea, he convened a meeting on colonial affairs to unify the policies of Manchuria and Mongolia, especially focusing on Manchuria's agriculture. In his speech, he said that he would use the full power of colonial affairs to increase immigration and that Manchuria was waiting to be developed. He encouraged everyone to work hard to develop Manchuria's natural resources. From this, he proceeded with his plan to immigrate one million people to the Northeast in 20 years, so as to make Manchuria and Korea one and incorporate our Northeast into its territory. According to a survey at the end of last year, the number of Japanese residing in the hinterland of the Northeast (Lushun) 10470 (Shenyang) 19103 (Kaiyuan) 2790 (Gongzhuling) 2032 (Fushun) 15317 (Andong) 2376 (Gaiping) 52 (Fengcheng) 16 (Hailong) 54 (Longjing Village) 961 (Kaiyuan City) 28 (Jilin) 930 (Taonan) 39 (Jinzhou) 103 (Harbin) 3366 (Dalian) 82682 (Pulandian) 936 (Dashiqiao) 2914 (Anshan) 594 (Liaoyang) 5028 (Tieling) 2780 (Sipingjie) 3326 (Changchun) 9440 (Benxi) 2538 (Fuxing) 3038 (Haicheng) 33 (Xingjing) 14 (Xinbin) 14 (Liuhe) 17 (Changtu) 37 (Zhengjiatun) 70 (Tongliao) 30 (Xinmin) 57 (Faku) 13 (Manzhouli) 176 (Jinzhou) 1312 (Piziwo) 954 (Yingkou) 2274. Statistics show that the above number is more than 181,200 people. However, this is only the number that is known. The number of Japanese and Koreans scattered in other places is estimated to be more than 2 million, with about 1.5 to 1.6 million engaged in agriculture. Because Korea has been our country's dependency for thousands of years and we sympathize with its tragic state of national subjugation, our country has allowed those who come to Manchuria to live in the hinterland as equals. This is enough to show the magnitude of our country's generosity. Who knew that it was falling into the trap of the Japanese? Because Japan has not obtained the rights of business lease in Manchuria, it is using Koreans to spread them throughout Manchuria and using a small number of Japanese to supervise and direct them to invade our agriculture and steal our land rights in preparation for negotiating inland residence and business lease rights. In recent years, there have been many tragic cases of Chinese farmers losing their lives and property, and although our authorities have negotiated with reason, the Japanese have ignored them. It is not difficult to prove the Japanese people's careful plans. Years ago, there were disputes over Japanese people invading and occupying the land of eastern provinces: (1) The East Asia Encouragement Co., Ltd. directed Japanese police to shoot and kill Chinese farmers in Xinmin County because of the purchase of land; (2) Japanese Feilong Tianqiang seized 7 Gongtai paddy fields and led police to shoot and kill the leader Han Xigui; (3) Japanese Sakakibara invaded the land outside the Beiling leased farm, first invading official land and then invading private land. In addition to these three cases, others are difficult to enumerate. On the one hand, 72 fortresses were built along the line of northern Manchuria last year, and this year, barracks are being built in Tieling, and the division stationed in Manchuria has been increased to two divisions. The defense police have also suddenly increased in number. Trenches have also been dug in Dalian and Lushun in mid-May, as if facing a great enemy. We did not know their intentions at first, but before we could turn around, the Wanbaoshan case arose. The clues cannot but make people deeply fearful.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Sends Fan Pujiang to Jinan</h3>
<p>Important Talks on the Current Situation</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Fan Pujiang, a consultant from the Beiping Deputy Commander's Headquarters,</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>arrived in Jinan this morning by the Pingpu train from Beiping, representing Deputy Commander Zhang to visit Chairman Han. When reporters heard the news, they immediately visited to inquire about the mission of his visit. According to him, Chairman Han (Fuju) has repeatedly sent people to Beiping to inquire about his illness, and he is representing the Deputy Commander to express his gratitude for this. The Deputy Commander has recovered from his illness and is as normal as anyone else and can receive guests, but the doctor still advises him to rest and avoid overwork. The Deputy Commander has a personal letter for him to deliver to Chairman Han, the gist of which is mutual support for the overall situation, and that the spirit of unity should be maintained. As for the Shanxi situation, the Jin army and the forces of Zhu Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, Gao Guizi, etc., still uniformly obey the General and Deputy Commanders, and their monthly salaries are paid in full, so there is absolutely no problem in Shanxi, and the area is extremely peaceful. The rumors circulating outside are absolutely not credible. As for Henan, Chief Commander Liu’s representative, Liu Yaoyang, also went to Beiping to inquire about the Deputy Commander’s illness, and the relationship was also extremely harmonious. He will probably stay in Jinan for a few more days, he said. At noon, Mr. Fan visited Chairman Han. Jiang Bocheng, the Chief Staff Officer of the Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, also came to the Provincial Government to meet with him. Then Jiang invited Han and Fan to his private residence for a rest. At six o'clock in the evening, Li Shuchun, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Wu Zhenzuan, the President of the High Court, hosted a banquet for Fan at the Youth Association. Except for Han, who did not attend due to business, all other military and political figures attended. After the banquet, reporters visited Fan again to inquire about the details of his meeting with Han. According to him, Chairman Han expressed that he was extremely clear-minded and consistently obeyed the General and Deputy Commanders’ advocacy of peace, and that there was absolutely no discrepancy.

<h3>The Fierce Battle to Suppress the Red Army and Capture Guangchang</h3>
<p>Nancheng Headquarters Announces Victory by Telegram</p>
<p>The Remnants of the Red Bandits Plan to Flee to Fujian and Guangdong</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The recovery of Guangchang by the Suppressing Red Army was already reported in yesterday's news. Yesterday, the Headquarters received another victory telegram from the Nancheng General Commander's Headquarters, which is excerpted as follows: (1) According to a telegram from Chief Commander Zhu Shaoliang, our troops engaged in fierce battles with the Huang Gonglue and other units of the Red Bandits in the Ganzhuxu and Xiangjiacun areas for two days and nights. Our army occupied Guangchang city at noon, and the bandit forces, unable to withstand the attack, fled in the direction of Ningdu, etc. (2) Army Commander Chen's telegram at noon stated that our army engaged in a day and night of fierce battle with the main forces of Zhu De's bandit troops, Luo Binghui and Lin Biao, near Wenhui in eastern Guangchang. More than 4,000 rifles were seized, and the bandits collapsed in the direction of Baisha. We are currently pursuing them, etc. (3) According to a telegram from Army Commander Wei Hai, the entire Peng Dehuai bandit force, which had originally been in the Kangdu area and had sneaked from Jianning to harass our rear, engaged in fierce battles from dawn on the 11th until the evening of the 12th, stubbornly resisting in an attempt to make a final stand. However, our troops at Shizui, who had come from afar, encircled and suppressed them, completely annihilating the Peng bandit force, capturing countless prisoners, disbanding more than 10,000 coerced followers, and rescuing more than 600 men, women, and children who had been held for ransom. Among the bandits, Peng's forces were the largest among Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang. Now that Peng's bandit force has been completely annihilated by our army, it will not be difficult to pacify the remaining small bands in the near future, etc. After the recovery of Guangchang, there were intense battles near Donggu and its surrounding areas, such as Tantou, Langkeng, Shima, Shaxi, and Daijiafang. According to an airplane report yesterday, the area more than ten miles west of Longgang was ablaze with fire on the 13th of this month. It was said that the retreating Red bandits were burning their nests. According to another airplane report, Red bandits carrying stretchers were discovered in the area south of Ningdu, stretching for several miles. It is said that the Red bandits have indeed abandoned their old nests and retreated into Fujian and Guangdong. (July 17th)</p>
<h3>He Jian Telephones Nanjing Urging for Funds</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province's military expenses are severely short and heavily in arrears. In addition, in the past two or three months, salt tax revenues have been low, and special taxes have been weak. The 200,000 yuan per month allocated by the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters for bandit suppression and miscellaneous expenses, and the 100,000 yuan per month approved by the Headquarters for Division Commander Wu's request, have not been remitted for two months, resulting in a severe shortage of supplies. Yesterday, in addition to telephoning General Commander Chiang and Minister Song to request 600,000 yuan to alleviate the urgent need, He Jian also specifically telegraphed Minister Song on the 7th, requesting that all the funds approved by General Commander Chiang be promptly allocated. The original telegram reads: [Strictly urgent, limited to two hours to Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance, Nanjing: I have received your secret telegram. After investigation, the military expenses of our army are severely short and heavily in arrears, and the situation is precarious. I have already exhausted all my words in Nanjing, and I hope for your understanding. Subsequently, I received the General's allocation of 500,000 yuan, which was only enough to clear one month's arrears. Not only is the situation as dire as before, but also because the current salt tax revenues are low and special taxes are weak, the income for May, June, and July is less than 400,000 yuan, resulting in a severe shortage of supplies and extreme hunger and fatigue. Previously, I received the General's telegram ordering Minister He to transfer 200,000 yuan per month from the special tax item for bandit suppression and miscellaneous expenses, and I received the General's reply to Division Commander Wu's telegram approving the monthly allocation of 100,000 yuan. Both cases were forwarded immediately after receiving the telegrams and have been urged repeatedly, with frequent urgent requests. Yet you, my brother, remain indifferent, not only not issuing a single penny, but not even replying with a single word. How can my efforts to reach the capital be successful? This is truly what I am deeply perplexed and cannot understand. Previously, I repeatedly received the General's order to open up岳郴寶 airport. At this time, the coffers of the tax collection agencies in Hunan Province are empty, with nothing to allocate. Only customs duties can be used. Therefore, I respectfully telegraphed to consult you. You rejected it on the grounds of not undermining financial unity. However, the customs duties are remitted to your department for redistribution. The use of funds is the same, whether before or after remittance, it is still under the allocation and order of your department, only the degree of urgency is different. It cannot be regarded as a defiance and resistance to financial unity. This is also what I cannot refrain from saying. At this time of intense suppression and military deployment on all sides, the perilous situation of having no pay and no provisions can be imagined. Yesterday, I specially telegraphed the General and you, my brother, requesting that 600,000 yuan be issued to alleviate the urgent need. I look forward to your consideration of our common plight and promptly allocate the previous funds to resolve the crisis and benefit the military situation. I eagerly hope and await your reply. Your brother, He Jian, bows. (Seal) (July 11th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Complete Crackdown on Kidnapping in Xiaokunshan: A series of kidnapping cases occurred in Xiaokunshan Township, the ninth district under the jurisdiction of the county, last month, causing extreme panic among the villagers. The police force in the district was also very weak. The district chief reported this and requested that a police team be sent to the township to investigate and make arrests. The Public Security Bureau dispatched inspector Yang Shijie to lead the police to the township for investigation. After nearly ten days, the criminals involved in the cases, Ruan Hucun (also known as Big-Foot Ah San), Zhou Xiaozhou, Xu Maonv, Wang Youyu, Yang Zixiang, and others, were apprehended and brought to the bureau yesterday. Director Shen, together with police chief Chen, interrogated them. According to the criminals, on the night of June 17, they kidnapped Gu Genbo and three others from Caobin, obtaining 500 yuan. Someone was in contact about the remaining 1,800 yuan to be paid in Xujiahui, Shanghai. They also kidnapped Pan Fengde's family in Xijinggang on the night of May 25. Seven accomplices went to kidnap them, and through someone's contact, they received 600 yuan. On the night of June 24, they went to kidnap Yu Hanzhang's family in Wangjiachang, Jin Hu, and later obtained a ransom of 700 yuan. They also kidnapped a family in Majiacun, whose name they did not know, and obtained a ransom of 400 yuan. They also obtained 400 yuan from Tao Songquan's family in Shijia Village. The victim in a certain family in Dapugang was injured and only 100 yuan was paid in Xujiahui. On the night of the 23rd of last month, they negotiated a ransom of 1,600 yuan for the kidnapping of Cao Wengao and Wu Yunqing's families in Tangcun Temple. About 25 ransom notes were delivered, and someone was sent to pick up the payment, but the victims were not at home. Only seven yuan was sent for travel expenses. After being treated to a meal, they returned to Shanghai and were arrested separately. Big-Foot Ah San has committed many crimes in Qingpu County. The decision to demolish the Dagang Pavilion: The Dagang Pavilion in front of the county government was designed by the former Director of the Construction Bureau, Xu, and its construction was approved by the county government meeting. After its completion, it occupied the streets and obstructed traffic. Merchants repeatedly petitioned for its demolition, but this was not allowed. The case was mentioned at the party and government talks the other day, and it was decided to demolish it. The news spread and the people were happy. It is now known that County Magistrate Shen has ordered the Construction Bureau to demolish it immediately based on the decision of the talks, and will also report it to the Department of Civil Affairs for record.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Three Soldiers Executed by Firing Squad: Regarding the Pingwang mutiny case, the Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters, in addition to transferring the two companies, the Second and Third Companies, of the First Battalion of the original garrisoned Xinzhen Fourth Regiment to the Suzhou North Hao Guild Hall for resettlement, and storing the 79 confiscated firearms in the headquarters, also dispatched the First Company of the First Battalion of the First Regiment, led by Battalion Commander Gao, to Pingwang for reinforcement. The seven principal culprits who were apprehended were interrogated thoroughly. According to their confession, they admitted that they had listened to the bandit line Lao Wei while stationed in Pingwang, and had made an appointment at the Pingwang Civilization Tea House to incite soldiers to go to Taihu to become bandits. Zhang Qindian (28 years old, from Shandong), Yan Caiming (19 years old, from Hunan), and Yin Ziqing (24 years old, from Hunan) were serving as squad leaders and were incited by bandits to incite soldiers. According to Articles 21 and 79 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, they were sentenced to death. Zhou Jinbiao (24 years old, from Xuzhou) and Liu Fengming (26 years old, from Fujian) were deemed to be blindly following and were sentenced to eight years of imprisonment each. Zeng Qingbang (28 years old, from Hubei) and Shen Tinghua (29 years old, from Hunan) had not been in the army for long and their circumstances were lighter, so they were sentenced to five years of imprisonment each and sent to a military prison to serve their sentences. After serving their sentences, they will be sent back to their hometowns. Lao Wei and the soldiers who escaped are being wanted. Yesterday (the 18th) at 11:00 a.m., Li Mingyang, the Director of the Provincial Security Department, first gathered the stationed Suzhou companies near the ice factory outside Xumen for a speech, and then bound Zhang Qindian and the other two to Wangxiedun for execution by firing squad. Afterwards, Director Li sent 100 yuan each to the families of the three executed soldiers. Four More Lake Bandits Captured: Wang Wusheng, the captain of the eighth team of the Second District of the Dongshan Water Public Security Bureau, recently captured Zhang Zishui, a bandit involved in the consecutive kidnapping cases of Dongcuntou, Wuxiang, and Jianqiaotou. After questioning him thoroughly, yesterday (the 18th) he went to Zhang Zishui's home in Xiaodou, Ducun, and captured four more lake bandits and three fast rifles, and brought them to the Wuxi District Department for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Court Begins Investigation into Murder Case: A male corpse with injuries was discovered in the Yangmuqiao River in the Second District (Jingyun City) last month. The county court sent personnel to examine the corpse and determined that the body had six stab wounds and had been murdered before being dumped into the river. The family of the deceased, Lu Zhang, identified the deceased as his son, Lu Rongquan, who was a plasterer by trade. Later, the mother learned that Lu Rongquan's death was due to a conspiracy by his mistress, Lu Yang, and her husband, Lu Asan, to kill him. She immediately filed a lawsuit with the county court, requesting the arrest of the murderers. After receiving the lawsuit, the prosecutor's office summoned the plaintiff to court yesterday to question her, ordered her to return home and await the arrest of the defendants for further investigation.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Appeals Lu Shiqiao Case: The prosecutor in charge of this case at the High Court, Jin Henian, believed that the judgment was inappropriate and submitted a written statement of reasons to the Supreme Court for appeal. The reasons he cited were: (1) The Criminal Procedure Law adopts the principle of direct trial as a fixed and unchanging principle. The fact that the defendant, Lu Shiqiao, participated in the conspiracy and incited Bao Dayuan and others to kill Tan Qixuan was unanimously confessed by the co-defendants Bao Dayuan, Lu Genhu, Guo Asi, and Zhu Ada in the Wuxi County Government, which also handled judicial matters. (2) According to the confession of the defendant Qian Fuyuan in another case (theft case): [I saw Bao Dayuan, Zeng Axing, Lu Shiqiao, and Lu Duanyi together in the Southeast Hotel on Xizang Road in Shanghai. I didn't know Lu Shiqiao, but Zeng Axing introduced us. I heard Bao Dayuan talking about how Lu Shiqiao and Tan Qixuan had a relationship due to their positions, and Lu Shiqiao used Bao Dayuan, Zeng Axing, Xu Bingsheng, and Lu Duanyi to shoot Tan Qixuan]. The above two points of directly obtained confessions were all discarded by the original judgment. Instead, the confessions of Guo Asi and Zhu Ada in the county government's records were adopted, which is inconsistent with the principles of criminal procedure. Furthermore, Qian Fuyuan is an important witness in this case. He was not confronted with Bao Dayuan, and it was not determined whether Lu Shiqiao and others were in the Southeast Hotel. The investigation of the duties was not exhausted, and therefore an appeal is filed for relief. Director of Finance Bureau Approved to Resign: Shen Ruji, the Director of the Finance Bureau of the county, has only been in office for one and a half months. Due to the county's depleted finances, the expected wheat harvest failed due to locusts, and the number of land tax collections was greatly reduced, making it difficult to cope. He repeatedly submitted his resignation to the Department of Finance, which was approved by the provincial government, and Wang Jingzhi, the Director of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau, was transferred to replace him.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Party Committee Member Discovered Embezzling Funds: Shi Minbei, the current Supervisory Committee member of the County Party Headquarters in this county, is from Shazhou City in this county. He once served as a representative of the National Assembly in Jiangsu Province. It is said that Shi has been discovered to be embezzling funds in the name of the party, and the Haiyu Daily and Yuyang Daily have reported this in detail. The matter is roughly as follows: In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Sangan River in Shazhou City was heavily silted, which was quite inconvenient for farmland irrigation. The gentry, Liu Bingshu, initiated the dredging of the river. The funds were collected from a special donation of two dimes per mu from the surrounding farmland, amounting to more than 2,000 yuan. After the river was dredged, villagers discovered that only half of the funds had been used, and Liu Bingshu was suspected of embezzlement. They went to the city to report to Shi Minbei. At the time, Shi was a member of the Party Committee, and he sent a letter to investigate and also sent a letter to Liu Jianbai, the head of the township administration (Jianbai was Liu Bingshu's nephew). The letter stated, [I have read the account and it has never been approved by the county government. It is completely privately collected national tax. I don't care if he subsidizes or compensates. I only know the compromise method. He (referring to Bingshu) takes out 500 yuan, or reduces it to 300 yuan, otherwise I will do what I can]. This was on July 12 of the 17th year. After Shi investigated, according to Liu Bingshu, the river funds were not enough and he had subsidized a lot himself, hence the statement. On July 17, Shi sent another letter to Liu Jianbai, saying, "The matter about your uncle has reached a stalemate. For the sake of brotherhood, I have offended your uncle, and I have approved the filing of a lawsuit with the judiciary." Then he said, "Please take care of your uncle's matter. If he is sensible, he will take out 500 yuan to settle the matter, or reduce it to 300 yuan for your sake, otherwise I will do what I can." Later, Jianbai sent a letter to his old friend Jianxin, saying that when his younger brother was in charge of local administration, he had used the black forces to extort 300 yuan from his uncle. The Haiyu Daily heard about this and published the whole story and the correspondence, and also took a film of the original letter. After Shi Minbei saw the newspaper, he issued a statement. A party member, Tong Shizhong, has filed a complaint with the county. Society is paying close attention to this matter. Bandits Plan to Rob the Suzhou-Changzhou Express Boat: After the river water rose sharply, all the boats at each port stopped sailing, so the Suzhou-Changzhou traffic was extremely isolated. Only a temporary number of fast private boats were used as an alternative for traffic. On the afternoon of the 15th, many fishing boats suddenly came to the Shenbang area of Guanghetang (ie the Suzhou-Changzhou route). They were very suspicious. The villagers questioned the men and women, but they were very evasive, and immediately got off the boat. The suspicion was even worse. The farmers rang the gongs and gathered the crowd to surround and detain three fishing boats. More than 200 chickens were found on the boats, and six bandits, men and women, were captured. After interrogation by the villagers, it was said that they planned to wait for the fast boat to pass by and rob it. The villagers tied the six bandits, men and women, to the trees on the river bank and announced to any ships passing by that they intended to rob the fast boat. Afterwards, the Public Security Bureau of the district heard the news and went to the spot to take the bandits to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Also, it was said that there were guns on the fishing boats, but when the villagers went to check, they were all sunk to the bottom of the river. It was also said that they had robbed a certain surname in Hengjing, etc. The Ransom for the Kidnapped Person in Nianbu Bridge is Paid: A kidnapping case occurred in Nianbu Bridge, Lao Wushi Township, Dongwu District, last year. When Lu Xincheng's grandson and four others were kidnapped, except for one person who was released to negotiate the ransom, the rest were still in the bandits' den. Lu Sunnian, 22 years old, received a letter from the bandits after his family was kidnapped, demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Lu sold his family property and obtained 8,000 yuan, and then asked someone to contact the bandits in Chongming. After much begging, the bandits agreed to release the kidnapped person within three days. Lu Sun returned home the other day. He said that after paying the money, they tied his eyes and sent him to the seaside, forcing him to get on a fishing boat to Changjie. The fisherman asked Lu about the details and learned that he was a kidnapped person, so he sent him directly back home.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Yangtze River Surveying Office Moves to Cheng: Jiangsu National Assembly representatives, in order to maintain the permanent prosperity of Shanghai, must first dredge the Yangtze River waterway. They have petitioned the National Government to send a team to conduct surveying in advance to serve as a basis for construction. It is now known that the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Yangtze River Surveying Team, which was originally located in the Hankou, Jiujiang, and Anqing areas, to move downstream for surveying starting in July. After receiving the order, Wang Yanfang, the captain of the team, sent Lin Youlong, the captain of the triangular team, to Jiangyin to start work at the old site of the North Outer Jiang Customs.

Members of the Chamber of Commerce Collude with Bandits and are Arrested: Hou Youwang's family in Qiangjiaotou, east of Housheng Town, Second District, received 146 silver dollars the other day. They were robbed by six or seven bandits during the heavy rain. Afterwards, Youwang's son met a member of the Big Knife Society in Hejiazhuang (it is said that the Big Knife Society is very prosperous in Jiangyin, and many villagers have joined the society in the name of protecting their families). He told them that a bandit knew Hou. The Big Knife Society detained his cousin Hou Youzhang and Li Quanlin. They confessed that Yuan had initiated the plan and that Cao Weixin, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, had borrowed a box gun. After being taken to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Cao Weixin (ie Cao Weixin) was arrested in Yangku. On the 16th, he was taken to the county government.

(2) A letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce reads: “To the esteemed members: It has been found that the Japanese, taking advantage of the Wanbaoshan Incident, instigated Koreans to violently expel the Chinese, and overseas Chinese compatriots are now in dire straits. Remaining is not enough to maintain a livelihood, and returning lacks the funds to sustain them. It is insufficient to simply gather donations to provide assistance and meet urgent needs. Therefore, the first committee meeting of this association resolved to send a circular telegram to domestic and international organizations to donate to the relief effort and designated the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Central Bank, and the four savings societies of the four banks, and the Fuyuan Money Shop as collection agencies.

We await your contributions respectfully.

Members of the Economic Management Committee: Qin Runqing, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Gongquan, Xu Jiqing, Qian Xinzhi, Xi Yushu."</p>

Hou Dachun and two others were designated to be responsible for convening the first meeting, all of which is on record.

The Minhang Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai County, respectfully, [seal]’ We hope that you will unite and rise up to be the government's rearguard. Respectfully transmitted, the Minhang Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai County, respectfully, [seal].” (2) The Shanghai Silk Thread Trade Association held its third executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Zhang Qixiong proposed that since the Wanbaoshan tragedy, all industries have risen up to boycott Japanese goods to support the government. The association should discuss how to respond. It was unanimously resolved that the association would automatically stop ordering Japanese goods. The names of purchased goods and the quantities in stock should be registered with the association within one week. Those who violate the above resolution and selfishly import goods will be severely punished in accordance with the disciplinary regulations prescribed by the Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Compatriots Association, etc. (3) The Woolen Fabric Trade Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating (above omitted). “The association has a patriotic heart to save the nation by destroying homes, starting with economic severance as a tool of passive resistance. This telegram is sent with trepidation and urgency. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Woolen Fabric Trade Association, respectfully, [sound of whistling]” (4) The Second District Branch of the Citizens' Federation issued a declaration, stating (above omitted). “All our compatriots must unite and resolutely sever economic ties with Japan. At the same time, we urge the government to seriously negotiate with the Japanese government. All members of our association pledge to first boycott Japanese goods as a diplomatic rearguard.

<h3>Amidst the Boycott Movement</h3>
<p>Japanese Goods Imports Surge Instead</p>
<p>Old and Damaged Stock Sold Out: Since the establishment of the Anti-Japanese Association and the proposal for economic severance with Japan, there have been rumors that the Association would prohibit the import of Japanese goods starting on the 14th. Since the news spread, various places outside Shanghai, deeply concerned that Japanese goods would not be able to enter China, took advantage of the remaining stock to rush to Shanghai to purchase large quantities of Japanese goods for resale elsewhere. Japanese merchants in Shanghai, seeing the large number of buyers, not only raised prices but also sold old stock accumulated in Shanghai warehouses to the Chinese, and required cash payment. Even those with prior transactions were required to pay with ten-day checks. Buyers, only seeking to obtain goods, did not care about quality, resulting in the inferior goods in Shanghai being swept clean. Therefore, Japanese merchants have been happily showing their faces, considering this a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Increased Exports on the Yangtze River: Yesterday, of the goods loaded on ships from Shanghai companies bound for the Yangtze River, 60% were Japanese goods, including Japanese sugar, cloth, and kelp. Even the Chinese merchant ships loaded a considerable amount. Over 90,000 bags of Japanese sugar originally stored in Shanghai have now been completely shipped out. In addition, Japanese goods accounted for over 40% of the exports on ships to the northern and southern oceans. The reason for the rush to load is that merchants in various places heard that Shanghai would hold an all-industry anti-Japanese association to automatically boycott Japanese goods on the 27th of this month. They took advantage of the time before the meeting to rush to ship the goods first.</p>
<p>Continuous Arrival of Imported Japanese Goods: Inferior goods transported from Japan by ships such as the Maya Maru and the Rokko Maru have been unloaded in Shanghai in recent days. There are also two batches of goods loaded on the Ikoma Maru, the Amagi Maru, and the Taian Maru that are already on their way and will arrive soon. On the Yangtze River, the Kinkai Yusen Kaisha has dispatched ten ships to rush the goods directly to Jiujiang and Hankou. In addition, Mitsui and Kawasaki have also dispatched ships to transport goods to Shanghai. Despite the proposal to ban Japanese goods starting on the 14th, they are still being transported here in a continuous stream.</p>
<p>Customs Leadership Orders Pilots</p>
<p>To Resume Work Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>However, Whether the Guild Accepts This Must Be Decided at Tomorrow Morning’s Meeting: The Shanghai Pilots' Guild has been on strike since the afternoon of the 16th, for three and a half days. Not a single foreign ship entering or leaving Shanghai has had an official pilot. The Port Director of the Jianghai Customs, along with the Shanghai Consular Corps and the Joint Association of British and American Chambers of Commerce, convened a meeting yesterday morning at the Jianghai Customs Building on the Bund. It was decided that the Jianghai Customs would reissue pilot licenses and that the Port Director of the Jianghai Customs would send a letter to all members of the Shanghai Pilots' Guild at 3 PM yesterday, ordering them to resume work unconditionally tomorrow morning (Monday). The Shanghai Pilots' Guild, upon receiving the letter from the Jianghai Customs, convened a meeting at 4 PM yesterday to discuss the matter. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting of the Three Organizations: At 10:30 AM yesterday, the Port Director of the Jianghai Customs, Mr. Green, convened a joint meeting in the conference hall on the third floor of the Customs Building with the Shanghai Consular Corps, representatives from the Joint Association of British and American Chambers of Commerce. Present were Mr. Green, Port Director of the Jianghai Customs, Mr. Hellman, Chief Inspector, Mr. Cunningham, US Consul General, Mr. Scottie, British Vice Consul, and representatives from the Joint Association of British and American Chambers of Commerce, including Mr. McTaggart (General Manager of Dodwell &amp; Co.) and Mr. Frantel (Manager of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.), totaling seventeen people. The meeting lasted for approximately two hours and adjourned at 12:30 PM. After the meeting, Mr. Green, Port Director of the Jianghai Customs, told a New Life News reporter that the meeting resulted in a decision to first order the Pilots' Guild to unconditionally resume work on Monday and issue pilot licenses at the same time. If members of the guild are unwilling to resume work by the deadline, a second meeting will be convened on Tuesday to discuss further measures.</p>
<p>Meeting of the Pilots: The Pilots' Guild at No. 26 The Bund convened a meeting of all members at the guild yesterday afternoon upon receiving the letter from the Customs. Thirty-eight people were present, chaired by Mr. Philip. The meeting lasted for approximately one hour and adjourned at 5 PM. After the meeting, members and Chairman Philip stated that the meeting only reported the contents of the letter received from the Customs. There was no definite expression on whether to accept the unconditional resumption of work. A meeting will be held again on Monday morning to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Temporary Pilotage Law: Regarding the entry and exit of foreign ships, the Customs has established a temporary measure, temporarily assigning several anchoring instructors under the Customs to guide the ships. Therefore, there should not be any major difficulties for ships entering and exiting. The rumor of a complete standstill is not accurate.</p>
<p>Ships Entering and Exiting Yesterday: Although the entry and exit of ships have experienced difficulties due to the lack of pilots, the Customs has assigned anchoring instructors to temporarily act as pilots, so the entry and exit of ships is barely normal. The ships that entered yesterday included the 比里敦 at 7:25 AM from Hong Kong and the 威爾福來德 at 4:40 PM from Qinhuangdao. The ships that exited included the 奔奈爾號, 馬牙丸, 達特南號, 錫爾威堡號, 萬考威爾城, 凡彫木得號, 威爾特號, and many others, all bound for foreign waters.</p>
<p>Losses of the Pilots' Guild: The losses of the Pilots' Guild and all its members in recent days have been considerable. It is estimated that the guild's daily expenses and the daily income of its members average a loss of over two thousand taels per day, totaling nearly ten thousand taels.</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan Resigns from Party Committee Position</h3>
<p>The seventh executive and supervisory committee members of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters have been designated by the central government. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, was again designated as an executive committee member this time. It is reported that Mr. Pan resigned his position to the central government in Beijing yesterday because he is also busy with municipal affairs and cannot take care of party affairs.</p>
<h3>District Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Retains the New Municipal Committee Member Zhu Yingpeng</p>
<p>Comrade Zhu Yingpeng, a member of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Committee, has served on the Municipal Committee for two consecutive terms and has worked hard for party affairs. In this election of the Municipal Party Committee, Zhu was still elected as a candidate to be selected. The central government has now selected Zhu as a member of the Municipal Committee, but Zhu serves in the newspaper industry and also serves as the Secretary-General and Chief of General Affairs of China Public School. He is too busy to take care of party affairs and has previously gone to Beijing to personally state to the central government that he should not be selected. The central government believes that Zhu has worked hard for party affairs and is quite virtuous, so it did not comply with his request and still selected him. Zhu then submitted another document to the central government to request his resignation again, which was recorded in yesterday’s newspaper. It is now known that the Third District Party Headquarters of this city heard the news and immediately decided at yesterday's regular meeting to send a letter to retain him and request the central government not to approve the resignation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhijiang and Niu Yongjian</h3>
<p>Yesterday Hosted the Press Corps for Martial Arts</p>
<p>Lectures on the Necessity of Promoting Martial Arts</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang, President of the Central National Martial Arts Academy, and Niu Yongjian, Vice President, spare no effort in promoting martial arts. In order to promote the nationwide effort, they hosted the press corps at the Dongya Restaurant yesterday evening. Zhang and Niu gave earnest speeches on the necessity of paying attention to martial arts. Zhang Zhijiang’s speech stated that the Central National Martial Arts Academy has been established for several years, and the number of letters from all over the country requesting martial arts teachers is overwhelming. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the Central National Martial Arts Academy. There are many Chinese who are skilled in martial arts, but those in the past only had skills and no knowledge, so it is planned to first collect these talents, train them, and then gradually promote them to the people of the country. Chinese people have always been called the "sick men of East Asia". If we want to wash away this shame, we can only create martial arts to train our bodies. Only with strong bodies can we have new ideas and achieve great careers. Niu Yongjian’s speech stated that the key to the disparity between the strength of China and Japan is that Japan has a national army, while we do not. Only when the whole country is a military can the whole country be mobilized, and the people of the whole country can be well trained. Military training is secondary. It is not difficult to train soldiers. They can fight in two or three months and be trainers in five or six months. Martial arts is our country's original military science. In the event of melee combat, it can make up for the lack of modern military science. However, its training is not refined in two or three years. The Chinese people should catch up as soon as possible and prepare early. I am not preparing for militarism and aggression, but with this preparation, we can use it or not, we can be fearless, and without this preparation, we cannot use it and can only be slaughtered. Therefore, the Chinese people should wake up and prepare early. Then, Shen Zhuowu and Qu Shaoyi gave reply speeches on behalf of the press corps.</p>
<h3>County Police Refresher School</h3>
<p>Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau was reorganized, the County Government has earnestly reorganized and prepared to establish a long-term police refresher school in accordance with provincial orders, and entered the school in stages for training. The opening ceremony was held at 10 AM yesterday. The heads of various bureaus, district chiefs, heads of various public security sub-bureaus, officials of the Public Security Section of the County Government, and guests, as well as various long-term police officers, totaling more than 200 people, were present. County Chief Yan presided over the meeting. After the meeting, everyone stood at attention, sang the party song, and paid the highest respect to the party's national flag and the portrait of the Premier. The chairman respectfully read the will and observed silence. Then, the chairman reported (the speech is recorded separately below). Next, Peng Liren, standing committee member of the county party headquarters, Shi She, head of the county education bureau, Ye Dezhen, secretary of the county, Bi Huan, chief of the fourth district, and Zhao Lian, head of the second public security sub-bureau, gave speeches in succession. After the speeches, photos were taken and the meeting was adjourned. The following is County Chief Yan's report:</p>
<p>Today is the opening day of the County Police Refresher School. We should first explain the reason for holding this refresher school. This time, the school is being held on the one hand to comply with the orders of the Ministry, and on the other hand, to address the factual needs of public security in the county. The responsibility of the police is very important, especially at the time when self-government is being promoted. It is not enough to only passively resist bandits and suppress opium and gambling. We must actively help the implementation of governance. During the period of political tutelage, the county is a self-governing unit. However, the county is still too large and complicated, and the relationship with the people is not the most direct and intimate. The organs at the lower level and the people have the most direct and intimate relationship, such as the district office and the various district public security bureaus. The promotion of self-government cannot but rely on these two organs. Therefore, household registration and health are all the responsibilities of the police. However, the actual situation is far from satisfactory. The basic responsibility of the police is to maintain local security. Without local security, there is no way to talk about self-government. However, some of the police officers do not even understand the exercises and how to use guns in terms of skill. As for those who are illiterate, there are still many. Without basic knowledge, all matters of self-government cannot be understood. How can they be responsible for promoting it? In the past, the county could not pay attention to training because the police salary was too difficult. As a result, whether in terms of skill or in terms of academics, the foundation was too shallow and could not be restudied. This time, in accordance with the orders of the Ministry, we prepare to train all the police officers in the county in rotation within one year, with two months as one term. However, the period of two months is too short. It is impossible to learn everything in this short period. These two months of refresher courses are like giving you a key to unlock the door of the school. Everything in the school requires you to explore and examine after you return to work. For example, in academic subjects, there is party ideology and criminal law. How can we teach you anything in just a few hours? The refresher school teaches you an outline, and in the future you can follow this path to study. With such a difficult public economy, the police affairs are very busy. These two months of refresher courses are very valuable. You should pay close attention to the instructions of the officials and do not neglect them in the slightest. You should especially cherish and preserve the handouts you receive. If you do not understand, you can ask the officials and do not waste time. Furthermore, a person's knowledge is certainly important, but morality is especially important. The first thing the police must do is to respect discipline and govern themselves before they can govern others. In the future, you will have to maintain social customs and hygiene. Therefore, your discipline and hygiene must be given special attention. After you return, you will still have to serve. The school will determine the promotion and demotion of your positions based on your performance in the refresher school, and will not make any false assumptions. Furthermore, the heads of the various sub-bureaus are all here today. The refresher course for two months is very short. In the future, you must stipulate methods to increase training at any time and in any place, whether in terms of skill or academics. This is the responsibility of the heads of the various sub-bureaus.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing</h3>

Wei Bozheng reported the proposed plans, which roughly included the establishment of three faculties: Engineering, Commerce, and Law. Subsequently, Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Shouyong, Wu Zhihao, and Wu Jingxiong all expressed their opinions in succession. The results were as follows: (1) Raise three million yuan in funds. (2) Nominate Yu Qiaqing, Sun Hengfu, Zhang Shouyong, Qin Runqing, Hu Mengjia, Liu Hongsheng, and Zhou Junyan as initiators.

<h3>Two Reactionaries Arrested</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters recently received a secret report stating that several reactionaries were hiding at No. 15 Meihuali, Jupulaisi Road, in the French Concession, and requested that officers be dispatched to arrest them as soon as possible. Detective Yang Fengqi of the Investigation Department took the warrant directly to the Special Organ of the French Police Department, who, together with Chinese and Western detectives, arrested He Wenlin and Ye Lanshan at the address. They also seized various reactionary documents and took them to the police station for transfer to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>

It is officially opened for commercial reporting from today onwards.</p>
<h3>Gu and Dai Memorial Service Scheduled</h3>
<p>Morning of the 25th</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-American Soldiers' Atrocity Association has scheduled a memorial service for the tragic deaths of Mr. Gu Jingen and Mr. Dai Tingzu, who were killed by American soldiers, to be held at 9:00 AM on the 25th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Party Headquarters. The association sent a letter yesterday inviting all circles to attend at that time. The original letter is as follows: To whom it may concern, Mr. Gu Jingen, a carpenter in the Construction Department of the Taichang Company of this port, was tragically shot and killed by American soldier Fuhufusi (transliteration) at No. 15, Gongping Road, Broadway, on the evening of April 22, 1931. Furthermore, Mr. Dai Tingzu, a dock vendor, was tragically pushed into the Huangpu River and drowned by American soldiers Pai Lan'erru (transliteration) and Shi Jilitar (transliteration) in front of Cargo Depot No. 8, Jinliyuan Wharf, Zhaoshang Bureau, in this port at 3:00 PM on May 23 of the same year. The news of these tragedies has deeply pained us all. These men were no less than national heroes who sacrificed themselves for the country due to the illegal privileges of American soldiers who massacred citizens of the great Republic of China like Gu and Dai. Recalling the past and present, our sorrow is immeasurable.

<h3>Anti-American Soldiers' Atrocity Association</h3>
<p>Letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association</p>
<p>Request to Send a Letter to Correct the Letter from the American Consul General</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-American Soldiers' Atrocity Committee yesterday sent a letter to the Taxpayers' Association requesting them to write again to the American Consul General. The letter states: "We have read the letter from the American Consul General to your association, which vaguely states that the Chinese judge in the case of the shooting of Gu Jingen recognized it as an act of self-defense by the American soldier, and that Dai Tingzu accidentally drowned and the cause of his falling into the water could not be ascertained. However, the American soldiers, in order to comfort the father of the vendor, gave him a pension of 250 yuan to settle the case. As for the case of the stabbing of four people at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong, they claimed to be unaware of it because it was not reported to the consulate, and that our public announcements in the newspapers were harsh and the wording was false, which must be refuted. After investigation, Gu Jingen, a docile carpenter with bare hands, was shot and killed by an American soldier in an interior room, with the bullet entering from the door, and after examination by Judge Guo of the Special District Local Court, it was confirmed that he was shot and killed by the murderer. He was sued to the competent yamen. How can this be reversed and considered an act of self-defense? This is the first point. Dai Tingzu, upholding righteousness and aiding others, was confronted by an American soldier in the water, who pushed him into the Huangpu River and drowned him out of resentment. According to the original letter from the Consul General, the American soldier had already given a pension to the family of the deceased. If he was not the person who harmed Dai, why would he do this? This is the second point. As for the case of four people being stabbed by American sailors at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong, there is a file at the Public Security Bureau that can be verified. There is no room for argument. This is the third point. The Consul General is best at resorting to the organs established by the two governments to resolve disputes according to law. We believe that the establishment of this organ is still impossible, which is tantamount to deceiving people with empty talk. In fact, the relatives, such as Gu Jingen's younger brother, have repeatedly complained to the Consul General's office, and our appeals from all walks of life have piled up like mountains, but the American consulate has turned a deaf ear. However, the only reply in the past few months has been this, which is very disappointing. As for our proper announcement of the news about this case, it is out of justice and righteousness. We sincerely hope that the American consulate will automatically seek a satisfactory solution to the above cases with the same spirit of peace and law-abiding, and not deceive people with empty words and suffer harsh criticism. This would be fortunate indeed. Therefore, we specially request your association to write again to the American Consul General to pay attention to correcting the facts to conform to the truth. July 18th."</p>
<h3>Problem of Salvaging Sunken Ships</h3>
<p>The Shipping Association Proposes Opposition</p>
<p>The Maritime Law stipulates that the responsibility for salvaging sunken ships belongs to the shipowners, which is unanimously opposed by the shipping companies in Shanghai, and they have already submitted a request to the Legislative Yuan for amendment. Now, because the Jianghai Customs intends to deduct the cost of salvaging sunken ships from the insurance compensation of the sunken ships, the shipping companies of this port have specially proposed opposition to the Shipping Association. The resolutions passed by the representatives of each company are as follows: (A) The shipping companies cannot recognize that the Maritime Law stipulates that the removal of sunken ships is the responsibility of the shipowners and are petitioning for amendment. Even in terms of Article 23 of the Maritime Law, it can only be limited to the value of the ship's voyage, movements, and other incidental expenses, which do not include insurance compensation. It is obvious that it is difficult to illegally mix them together. Moreover, the withholding of funds must go through judicial procedures and cannot be illegally disposed of. The Supervisory Office's approval of this move is not in accordance with legal precedents, and the shipping companies cannot recognize it. Insurance companies should reply and deny it. If the insurance company complies, it should be responsible for it and should not resist the shipping companies that should receive insurance compensation in the future. The Hu'an Company will be notified by the association for investigation, and if necessary, a petition will be submitted in accordance with administrative appeals procedures. (B) The shipping companies find it difficult to reluctantly comply with the Maritime Law's stipulation that the responsibility for removing sunken ships should be borne by them. The association will list the reasons in detail and submit them to the National Government Chairman Chiang, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Finance, appealing for amendment.</p>
<h3>Banking Association to be Reorganized Soon</h3>
<p>The Municipal Civic Training Association Issues a Permit</p>
<p>Since the Central Government promulgated the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Commercial Association Law, all industries in the city, except for the Yinqian and the Money Shop Associations, have reorganized their trade associations one after another. It is learned that the Banking Association, in order to abide by laws and regulations, has specially applied to the Municipal Civic Training Association for a permit. It is now reported that the application has been approved and the permit will be issued. The Banking Association will immediately form a preparatory committee to organize the association.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Issue of Business Tax Distribution</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently submitted a request to the Executive Yuan regarding the issue of business tax distribution, proposing to follow the example of the Hubei Province and distribute the total amount of business tax revenue from the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, with 70% going to the provincial government and 30% to the municipal government. After consideration by the Executive Yuan, it was considered that this matter must be negotiated with the municipal governments of Nanjing and Shanghai before a decision could be made, and the Executive Yuan immediately issued an order to the municipal governments of Nanjing and Shanghai to investigate. It is learned that the municipal government considers the impact of this issue on the future administration of the municipal government to be extremely significant and is expected to hold an important meeting to discuss it in detail.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms</p>
<h3>Purchase Orders Should be Changed to Use Chinese</h3>
<p>The Timber Industry Association Advocates</p>
<p>Representatives Have Been Dispatched to Negotiate Sincerely</p>
<p>The Timber Industry Association of this city, in view of the fact that the order forms used by foreign merchants have always been in foreign languages, and the conditions therein are often one-sided, which not only affects the national dignity but also has a great impact on the interests of the industry, decided at the executive committee meeting on the afternoon of the 16th to elect representatives to negotiate with various foreign merchants. In the future, all documents should be translated into both Chinese and English, and in case of any ambiguity, Chinese should prevail to respect national dignity and balance rights and obligations. Wei Shanfu, the manager of Dao'er Foreign Firm (who is a chairman of the association's committee), immediately acknowledged that he would be responsible for contacting the foreign firms for compliance.</p>

<h3>Robbers Rent a Car to Commit Robbery</h3>
<p>Renting a Car for Convenience</p>
<p>Car Rental Companies Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>A robbery occurred at Changyun Lane, Xindagulu Road, at 5:30 PM yesterday. The robbers first rented a car from a car rental company, drove to commit the robbery, and then loaded the stolen goods and fled. When they arrived at Lafayede Road in the French Concession, the robbers abandoned the car and fled without a trace. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening the Door to Robbers: Wu Bingrong, a Ningbo native, runs an electrical appliance store in Hangzhou and also manufactures clothing in Shanghai. He lives at No. 417, Lane 2, Changyun Lane, Xindagulu Road, in the Public Concession. At 5:30 PM yesterday, a beggar came to the door to ask for money. The child in the house opened the door and gave him a copper coin to send him away. Unexpectedly, in a flash, a strange man sneaked into the gate and walked into the courtyard, shouting, "Is there a Mr. Li here?" As Wu's family was about to answer, three more men followed in. Two were wearing Chinese clothes and one was wearing a Western suit, all of them young. They said to the people in the room, "Don't panic," and then took out guns. The women knew they had encountered robbers and remained silent. Two robbers then went upstairs and broke into the bedroom, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, and robbed over eighty yuan in cash. Before leaving, they also took several agate ornaments from the table, totaling about one hundred and several tens of yuan, and fled with the loot.</p>
<p>Car as Transportation: The robbers rented a car from the Guomin Car Company below the Caso Novo Dance Hall on Aiduya Road. The number of the car was 12595. There were three people in the car at the time, one wearing a Western suit and two wearing Chinese clothes. After driving for only a few tens of yards, two more people were waiting on the road. The people in the car asked the driver to stop and wait, and one of them jumped into the car. Then, they drove west and north to Changyun Lane near the Jesus Church on Xindagulu Road and stopped. Three people got out first, and the one wearing a Western suit left the car last, putting three yuan on the seat as fare. The driver did not know that the passengers were robbers using the car for transportation.</p>
<p>Abandoning the Car and Fleeing: When the robbers left Changyun Lane, they heard a police siren and became very flustered. One robber did not have time to get into the car and fled first. The remaining robbers got into the car and pretended to be calm, telling the driver to drive west, turn south onto Tongfu Road, and then pass through Sacred Heart Road in the French Concession to Lafayede Road before stopping. The robbers then calmly abandoned the car and fled. After the English and French Concession police stations received the news, they immediately sent detectives to search for the robbers everywhere.</p>
<h3>Huang Chu Jiu's Assets</h3>
<p>Two Bids Cancelled</p>
<p>Ge Jiren Expels Ma Zhaoji</p>
<p>Creditors Suffer Great Losses</p>
<p>In the case of the bankruptcy of the Shanghai Riyue Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department, the French Concession Court yesterday summoned the accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng to open the bidding for Huang Chu Jiu's assets and to explain the various disputes that arose during the bidding process. Then, the creditor's representative, lawyer Dong Yu, stated that when the Huang's assets were bid on the other day, the lawyer and Chen Zhigao went to the site to supervise. The bidder, Ge Jiren, illegally expelled the bidder Ma Zhaoji, etc., and the highest bid by Ma Zhaoji was more than 50,000 taels higher. It was obvious that Ge Jiren intended to sell Huang's assets at a low price. Such illegal actions caused great losses to the creditors, and the lawyer was very dissatisfied. The two accountants, Pan and Wu, did not stop this situation when they saw it on the spot. Now, for the benefit of the creditors, the lawyers requested that the court order the accountants to sell at the highest price, or allow the security deposit under Ge Jiren's name to be retained. Furthermore, lawyer Jiang Yiping stated that various disputes arose due to the bidding. The bidding method was very poor. In order to protect the interests of the creditors, the lawyer requested that the bidding method be cancelled to avoid losses to the creditors. At this point, the creditor representatives' lawyers, Bian Jialu, etc., all agreed. In addition, lawyer Yan Luqing stated that he requested the court to order the liquidator to estimate the total assets of the Gongfa Company and compare the shortage to the total debt, and to collect the amount from each shareholder in proportion first. After the lawyers argued for a long time, Judge Gong ruled that the bidding and sale were difficult, and the two bids were cancelled. It was also heard that creditor representative lawyer Yan Luqing was dissatisfied with the court's judgment on the responsibility of directors and shareholders and planned to invite all creditor representatives to hold a meeting at the Zhongshe Western Restaurant today to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Continued Trial</h3>
<p>Case of Privately Purchasing Military Supplies</p>
<p>Both Contracts Have Been Investigated</p>
<p>Both Were Typed on the Same Typewriter</p>
<p>Defendant Added the Word "Guarantee"</p>
<p>Beeck Reported the Matter to the National Government</p>
<p>World-renowned military detective Beeck and Leveresque were previously prosecuted by the Concession Court for posing as military advisors to the National Government and ordering 1.8 million yuan of military supplies from the Lefa Foreign Firm opened by Englishman Lefa at No. 2 Guangdong Road, and forging Lefa's seal. The case has been tried twice, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Court Judge Xu Jiashi opened the court to continue the trial. The police station was still represented by lawyer Ru Baoyi. First, Judge Xu questioned Leveresque about how many times he had contacted Lefa about military supplies. Leveresque replied in English, which was translated by translator Jiang Baoliang, saying, "I went to Lefa's office on May 15 to ask if there was any evidence to prove that I was introduced to Lefa Foreign Firm by Carlo. I have known Carlo for three years, but there are no documents to prove it." When asked if Carlo said he was introducing him to military supplies and not to Lefa's office, he replied, "He was indeed introducing me to manage the shipping." Judge Xu then asked Carlo about this matter, but Carlo firmly denied it. The defendant's lawyer immediately stood up and asked Beeck if he knew Lefa. Beeck replied, "I only know that Lefa has formed a party and is close to the Soviet Union, but I don't know him." Judge Xu then questioned Leveresque about how many people were present when he signed the contract. He replied, "Zhang Faying, Zhang's adjutant Mr. Li, Lefa, and Carlo. This was on the 10th. On the 9th, Lefa ordered me to send a letter to Zhang Faying on Tang'en Road. Zhang said that he would not sign without two guarantors." When asked if Zhang Faying had stamped both contracts, he replied, "Both were stamped." When asked where the contract he presented came from since one contract had been handed over to Zhang Faying, he replied, "It was taken from Lefa's office." The police station lawyer Ru immediately asked to question Leveresque, and the court allowed it. Lawyer Ru then asked, "Did you go to Lefa's office on June 10?" He replied, "I went around 10:00 AM." When asked how many people went with him, he replied, "Only me." When asked how many people were there, he replied, "Carlo, Lefa, Zhang Faying, and Zhang's secretary arrived successively after a few minutes, and then they signed the contract. After signing, a place was set aside and sent to witness Zhu Ziyao to sign." When asked if he was told that the contract seen on the 9th was different from the contract on the 10th because the one on the 10th had not been changed, he replied, "I can't be sure." When asked if he had seen the contract before they signed it on the 10th, he replied, "The contract on the 10th was placed on the table. I didn't look at it because I had nothing to do with it." When asked if Zhang Faying had seen it, he replied, "He had seen it." When asked if Zhang knew English, he replied, "I don't know." Lawyer Ru then stated to the court that in addition to accusing Beeck and Leveresque of violating Article 161 of the Criminal Law for disrupting order and forging seals, they were now adding a charge of violating Article 204 of the Criminal Law for altering documents because the contract submitted by the police station as evidence did not have the word "guarantee" after the witness, while the contract submitted by the defendant had the word "guarantee" after the witness. This kind of behavior was enough to damage the witness Carlo Zhu Ziyao, so it was specially charged. Now, the police station has invited experts to the court to prove that the word "guarantee" on the contract submitted by the defendant was added later. Then, Li Mo, the Western deputy head of the fingerprint department of the police station, testified that the contracts submitted by both parties were typed on a typewriter at the same time, and the word "guarantee" was added to the defendant's contract later. Then, Beeck testified that the witness Zhu Ziyao had received 200 yuan from Lefa to help Guangdong, and that he was helping Lefa because he was afraid that the National Government would find out and confiscate all his property. Judge Xu then asked about the report to the National Government. He replied, "I knew that Lefa was selling military supplies to Guangdong, so I obtained the contract and reported it to Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance of the National Government. Minister Song learned about it and asked me to temporarily keep the contract and hand it over to Tang Hai'an, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs when he came to Shanghai. Tang came to Shanghai a few days later, and I went to Tang's residence at No. 97 Fukaissen Road to see Tang, and Leveresque told me that Zhu Ziyao was initially unwilling to sign as a witness, but signed after receiving 20,000 yuan." Then, Zhu Ziyao was brought to the case and asked about the 20,000 yuan, but Zhu firmly denied it and said that on Saturday, the 13th of last month, at 5:00 or 6:00 PM, two lawyers, Xuekesi and Shizhuoren, came to my house and represented Leveresque to ask me for a commission, saying that Lefa was unwilling to pay the commission and that I, as the guarantor, should be responsible for it. The price they asked for was 9 yuan per gun, and I forgot the total amount. Because I was only a witness and did not bear the responsibility of a guarantor, I replied that I needed to consider it carefully before they left." The court then summoned lawyer Shi to give evidence. Shi said that Zhu was asking for a new factory owner. On the 13th of last month, he was commissioned by Le to ask Zhu for a commission, so he went to Zhu and urged him to pay Lefa. At that time, I said, "You are a guarantor and should be responsible for urging the payment," and said nothing else. Judge Xu then summoned lawyer Xuekesi for questioning. As it was past noon, he decided to postpone the questioning to another date.</p>
<h3>Cheng Xun Sneaks Back to Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Yesterday He Was Forced to Leave the Country Again</p>
<p>The Jiangwan shaman Cheng Xun was previously ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to have the municipal committee members of the Jiangwan district and the five districts and five offices jointly carry out the expulsion order, and this was reported in various newspapers. It is learned that Cheng Xun did not repent and dared to sneak back to Jiangwan late at night a few days after being expelled, hiding in his former residence in the hope of staging a comeback and resuming his bizarre state. This was reported to the Public Security Bureau by someone. The fifth section of the fifth district immediately sent police officers to search and found him hiding upstairs. They immediately forced him to leave the country. The section chief, for the sake of prudence, also sent additional sentries to guard and monitor him. If he returns to Jiangwan again, he will be arrested and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Two People Missing</h3>
<p>One Due to Poverty and Illness</p>
<p>One Due to Family Matters</p>
<p>Bian Haicheng: Bian Haicheng, a native of Funing, is 54 years old. He joined the party from the Tongmenghui and is now a member of the twelfth branch of the sixth district in this city. He served as a member of the former Zhabei Municipal Assembly and has run the Tianlingtang Pharmacy on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, for nearly 20 years. Unfortunately, he contracted phlegm madness last year and had difficulty moving. He would sometimes have mental disorders and unclear speech. After medical treatment, he is now able to walk slightly, but due to prolonged illness, he had to close the pharmacy and exhaust all his possessions. He had no choice but to move to the Laodexiutang Nursing Home at No. 72 Kaifeng Road. Because he has a wife, a son, and a daughter, and life is unsustainable, he struggled to ask old friends for loans, but few responded. Mr. Bian was originally suffering from phlegm madness and is in a very poor and sick state. He lacks the interest in life even more. Occasionally, when he is sober, his words contain world-weariness. He suddenly went out at around 11:00 AM on the 17th of this month. His wife immediately followed him when she heard the news, but did not know where he had gone. She has been searching everywhere for two days, and his life and death are unknown. Yesterday, his wife, Bian Liu, led her nine-year-old daughter and cried and inquired along the way. The situation was extremely miserable. It is said that Mr. Bian was wearing a white bamboo cloth short shirt, white striped gauze pants, black socks, and black shoes when he went out. His left knee was injured and broken, and he had a short beard. If anyone knows of his whereabouts, please notify his family, and it would be a great merit.</p>
<p>Chen Yinsheng: Chen Yinsheng, the nephew of Mr. Chen, a staff member of the press who lives at No. 33 Ximenli, Ximen Road, in the French Concession, ran away from home yesterday morning due to a minor family matter. He is 17 years old, from Chaoyang, Guangdong, and speaks the Jiangbei dialect. He left a letter to his grandmother, uncle, and aunt, claiming that he was getting older and could not support himself, so he was going to Hunan alone in the hope of finding a suitable job and returning home in three or five years. He also took dozens of records with him to pawn to cover his travel expenses. If any kind person finds him, please send him to No. 33 Ximenli, Ximen Road, French Concession, Shanghai, or notify his family, and they will be rewarded generously and will not break their promise.</p>

<h3>Regulations of the Public Works Department for Removing Shanties</h3>
<p>Reply to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association</p>
<p>Zhu Xueli, Cao Xukun, Xu Naikui, Liu Jinzhu, and other representatives of the shanty towns in the Yangshupu area previously protested against the Public Works Department's deadline for demolishing shanties and sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association for assistance. The association immediately forwarded the letter to the Public Works Department. Yesterday, the Public Works Department replied to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, stating: "With reference to the letter of June 29 protesting the demolition of shanties in the Eastern District, the Bureau has considered moving a small number of shanties for the convenience of filling in low-lying areas, but there is no intention to demolish all shanties immediately. The Bureau has considered this issue and decided to register and stipulate that no new shanties may be built in order to prevent the gradual increase of such unauthorized buildings. It is proposed that the number of existing shanties be reduced year by year by mutual agreement. This is a corresponding reply for your information."</p>
<h3>Passenger Baggage Inspection Notice</h3>
<p>The Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs has found that passengers arriving in Shanghai by ship do not store their baggage on board in accordance with the regulations, which is in conflict with the regulations of the Customs. The regulations for the inspection of passenger baggage arriving in Shanghai are as follows: (1) (A) When the ship arrives at the Shanghai wharf, all passengers are not allowed to leave the ship until the baggage has been unloaded and transported to the Customs Inspection Warehouse. (B) All passengers disembarking at the Customs wharf must have their baggage arrive at the wharf before the first passenger ferry or at the same time as the passenger. (2) Each piece of baggage must have a label with the owner's signature or the number assigned by the shipping company. (3) Relatives and friends of passengers and receptionists of transport companies are not allowed to board the ship or passenger ferry without the special permission of the Customs. Only the passenger himself and the agent authorized to transport the baggage are allowed to enter the fence of the inspection warehouse when the baggage is unloaded for inspection. Other persons are not allowed to enter. (4) All baggage must be unloaded as soon as the ship has docked. If baggage is found remaining on board after it has been announced that the unloading has been completed, the shipowner and the ship's agent will be punished. Passengers who do not unload their baggage immediately after arriving at the port shall pay ten taels of customs duty as a special fee. The Customs will facilitate the implementation of this inspection.</p>
<h3>Repealing the Zhejiang Road Cemetery Contract</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Disagrees</p>
<p>Not far from the Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road and Alabastos Road, there are the Yi Cemetery lands of Tongren Fuyuan and Bao'an Two Halls. A plaque reading "(Bao'an Hall Name)" still remains. Short walls surround it, with desolate graves and overgrown weeds. It is abandoned and useless. Citizens passing by all sigh, unaware of the history within.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council's Contract Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>According to records, the land is located in the "Guo Zi Wei" area of the 25th Bao, 2nd Tu, purchased by Fuyuan Hall and others from Ma Jinhai and others during the Xianfeng 9th year, totaling 29 mu, 5 fen, 7 li, and 4 hao. Current measurements show 33 mu, 1 fen, 3 li, and 5 hao. In the Guangxu 19th year, the Municipal Council considered building a road and occupying the land. The hall established a contract stating that no more coffins should be placed on the land, nor should temporary storage of coffins be allowed. The person in charge was to keep the area clean. In the Guangxu 28th year, the Municipal Council again planned to build a Chinese Children's Public School on the land and colluded with some directors to establish a contract to sell the cemetery land. This was met with heated opposition from citizens, almost leading to turmoil. The directors then purchased a plot of land on Kenenghai Road as a replacement and separately established a contract. The original text reads: "The directors of Shanghai Fuyuan Hall and Bao'an Hall, for the sake of preserving the Yi Cemetery land of Fuyuan Hall and Bao'an Hall in the future, now enter into a contract with the Municipal Council. The agreed-upon clauses are listed below: (1) The Municipal Council has agreed to cancel the recently signed contract for the sale of the Yi Cemetery land of Fuyuan Hall and Bao'an Hall. Hereafter, the directors of Fuyuan Hall, Bao'an Hall, etc., shall never sell or lease the Yi Cemetery land to others, nor shall they use the land for other purposes. (2) All the clauses agreed upon in this contract have been published in Western newspapers and included in the minutes of the Municipal Council Western Directors' meetings, and have also been published in local newspapers so that everyone may know the actual situation. It has also been registered for future reference. Furthermore, this contract shall serve as permanent evidence that the Yi Cemetery land of Fuyuan Hall and Bao'an Hall shall not be used for other purposes in the future. (3) The directors of Fuyuan Hall, Bao'an Hall, etc., have prepared two copies of this contract, signed to show good faith, and affixed the seals of the Shanghai Daotai and the British Consul General to indicate that this contract was approved by the local officials before being established. January 5th, 1902, Guangxu 28th year, October 6th, Tongren Fuyuan Hall Director Cao Jishan, et al."</p>
<p>Motive for Repossession and Use: In recent years, the North Zhejiang Road area has become increasingly prosperous, and the estimated value of the land is over one million silver dollars. The Shanghai Charity Organizations Property Management Committee believes that it should be improved for use to increase revenue and develop charitable undertakings. Therefore, the committee's design division planned in detail, submitted a resolution to the meeting, and requested the Bureau to forward it to the government to negotiate the cancellation of the old contract and then lease the property through public bidding, with the remains to be relocated to rural areas.</p>
<p>Reasons for Repealing the Contract: It is found that the Shanghai Charity Organization has an Yi Cemetery land located near the Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession, totaling 23 mu, 1 fen, 3 li, and 5 hao. It was formerly the property of Tongren Bao'an Hall and Tongren Fuyuan Hall and is now under the management of the organization. The area is surrounded by dense markets and convenient transportation and has become a prosperous commercial area. It is a great pity to leave it unused. According to the organization's directors, the Public Concession Municipal Council planned to establish a Chinese Children's Public School during the Guangxu 28th year of the late Qing Dynasty and bought the entire cemetery land from the directors of the former Tongren Lai'an Hall and Tongren Fuyuan Hall for the purpose of building school buildings. A contract was signed and completed. However, due to opposition from citizens (against the relocation of graves), the directors Cao Jishan and others were instructed to negotiate the cancellation of the contract. The Municipal Council then purchased another piece of land as a school site and took back the cemetery. When the contract was cancelled, the directors of the two halls entered into a contract with the Municipal Council containing three clauses. The first clause stated that the Municipal Council had agreed to cancel the recently signed contract for the sale of the Yi Cemetery land of Fuyuan Hall and Bao'an Hall, and that hereafter, the directors of Fuyuan Hall, Bao'an Hall, etc., should never sell or lease the Yi Cemetery land to others, nor use the land for other purposes, thus preventing any change in its use. We believe that the entire cemetery land is now estimated to be worth over one million taels, and it is unwise to abandon it for profit. Furthermore, the maximum responsibility for the cancellation of the contract is to compensate for the losses of the cancelled party. Since the land has already been purchased and compensated, the Municipal Council has no losses to speak of. The contract not only restricts the sale but also the use of the owner. This kind of arbitrarily restrictive measure is not permissible according to legal principles. Now, if the graves are relocated and houses are rebuilt for rent, the Shanghai Charity Organization will also be able to obtain a large income for charitable undertakings, and the Municipal Council's property tax can also be increased significantly. After discussion, it was resolved that the contract should be negotiated and cancelled, and it was assumed that the future income from the use of the land would be used to support vagrants or reformatory expenses. The matter was then submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. This is because there are many vagrants in the city and the special district, and some minor criminals do not necessarily need to be imprisoned. The lack of reformatories and shelters only leads to them acquiring bad habits in prison that cannot be redeemed. If a reformatory is established, and criminals are given the opportunity for reform after their release, reducing crime will be equivalent to securing society. If the contract can be cancelled and methods can be found to reorganize the area, using the income to run the above-mentioned undertaking, it will be mutually beneficial. After the Social Affairs Bureau reviewed it and forwarded it to the Municipal Government, an order from the Municipal Government was recently received.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Opinion: They do not agree to the cancellation of the contract and have proposed that the land be turned into a park or a permanent open space to avoid overcrowding. The residents there are already considered too numerous, and if shops and residences are rebuilt, the number of people will inevitably increase by tens of thousands. Their intention seems to be for the Municipal Council to buy the land for use as a park or green space for citizens to relax, but there are no definite plans yet. It is said that the Social Affairs Bureau has already forwarded the Municipal Government's order to the Shanghai Charity Organization.</p>
<h3>Further News on the Smuggling of a Huge Quantity of Opium</h3>
<p>Yesterday's report on the smuggling of a huge quantity of opium stated that it was transported from the "Guangyao" ship to the shore. However, the Ruifeng Foreign Firm, which manages the "Guangyao" ship, stated that the opium was not transported by the "Guangyao" ship. Inquiries with the Customs also revealed that they had not received any such news.</p>

(Answer) During the New Year, friends opened a room on the sixth floor to play cards. The alleged room 204 can be investigated. The judge said that this would definitely be investigated.

(Answer) Zhuang Jihuai is his relative, and he was the one who introduced Fei Xizhen. He certainly doesn't sympathize with me. And if the settlement fee was collected, was there a receipt? (Question) No receipt was issued for the settlement fee? (Answer) If there was a settlement fee, both parties should have gathered together to pay it in person. It couldn't be paid in installments so casually. The judge concluded that the witnesses in this case were not all present and that further investigation was needed, and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Beggars Riding in Cars</h3>
<p>Deportation</p>
<p>The French General Police Station found that in recent days, there were many beggars lying across the roads in areas such as East and West Zilaihuo Streets, daring to litter the roads with filthy waste, greatly hindering hygiene and transportation.

<h3>Fire in Qibao Town, Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Qibao Town in western Shanghai, located on the border of Shangsong and Qing, is a prosperous market town. The streets north and south of Tang Bridge are the most bustling. Since the town was built, the streets have been narrow, and the buildings on both sides have been built over the allowed height. Once a fire breaks out, it is inevitable that it will spread like wildfire. Around 7 PM the day before yesterday, a fire broke out in a certain family, immediately bursting through the roof, with flames that were too bright to approach. Coupled with the urgent north wind, the fire spread even more rapidly. The town has no firefighting equipment, so once the fire started, they were at a loss and could not control it. The fire spread from Tang Bridge to the pawnshop street, burning down over twenty houses, destroying the essence of the entire town, until halfway through.</p>

<h3>Coast Patrol Office</h3>
<p>Sends Warships to Strictly Investigate Japanese Fishermen Smuggling</p>
<p>Japanese Fishing Vessels Have Disappeared from this Port</p>
<p>Japanese fishing vessels have been encroaching on the coastal waters of China. Customs offices across the country have been ordered to prohibit foreign vessels under 100 tons from entering Chinese ports and to clearly stipulate that Japanese fishing vessels entering China to smuggle goods should pay import duties of 2.20 Japanese yen per 100 catties, equivalent to 4.50 Chinese yuan. More than 60 Japanese hand-operated net fishing vessels, such as "Man Qian Maru," "Ping Yu Maru," and "Zhao Sheng Maru," which were fishing in Shanghai, have gradually stopped coming to Shanghai due to the tariff issue and have now disappeared, instead going to Qingdao. The Shanghai Fisheries Guidance Institute recently dispatched technician Wang Defa to consult with Yan Qiwu, secretary of the Coast Patrol Office of the Naval Department, to discuss measures to crack down on unscrupulous merchants transporting Japanese fishing vessels to Shanghai. As a result, the Coast Patrol Office will send two patrol ships to conduct strict patrols day and night along the coast from the mouth of the Huangpu River to the mouth of the Yangtze River. If Japanese fishing vessels are found docked along the coast, they will be driven away. If unscrupulous merchants are found smuggling Japanese fishing vessels, they will be severely punished according to the law.</p>

<h3>Marrying a Wife Only to Have Her Abducted with a Sister-in-Law</h3>
<p>The Concubine Claims it is Her Younger Sister</p>
<p>Three Times Colluding to Release Doves</p>
<p>Wang Xiuhua, a farmer residing at 28 Baotou Tu, Nanshou, Hongqiao Town, Western Shanghai, is 55 years old and has five sons, all of whom are married except for the youngest. In August of last year, his second daughter-in-law died. On the 29th of last month, Wang Atian, in collusion with Zhang Guanfu, Yu Amao, Ding Quansheng, Gu Jixiang, and others, acted as matchmakers and remarried Gu Xiaomei (24 years old, from Wuxi, the wife of Gu Ada's younger brother, who was raised as a child bride since she was young), renaming her Jin Xiaomei, to Wang Xiuhua's second son, Fuyuan, as his wife. The tea ceremony cost 180 yuan, which was provided by Jin Zhangxing, a tailor from the Dai family residence north of Hongqiao Town, who is the concubine's partner. A marriage certificate was issued as proof, stating that Jin Xiaomei, the younger sister, was introduced to Wang Fuyuan as his wife by Wang Adi and others. The silver was delivered that day, and the marriage was hastily completed. Around 2 PM on the afternoon of the 1st of this month, Gu Xiaomei deceived Wang Xiuhua's fourth daughter-in-law, Yu Jinying (also known as Wang Yu), to go to the field to weed on the pretext of going to weed outside. Unexpectedly, she left and never returned. By evening, she had not returned home, so people were asked to search for her everywhere, but no trace was found. Only then did Xiuhua realize that Wang Atian and others had colluded to release the doves and abduct the fourth daughter-in-law, Wang Yu, resulting in the loss of both person and property. He was dejected and depressed. Although he repeatedly asked for the person, those people delayed and procrastinated, and even gathered a crowd to tie up and brutally beat Yu Jinying's father and brother, Yu Quangen and Yu Baisheng, forcing them to hand over Wang Yu. They were insane and acted perversely. It is said that Gu Xiaomei has been sold twice by Jin Zhangxing and has now been sold three times. Xiuhua could no longer bear it and entrusted lawyer Shen Xingxia to write a complaint to the court for criminal prosecution yesterday.</p>

<h3>Xu Qiuyue Accuses</h3>
<p>Chen Jiongwen of Deceit and Abandonment</p>
<p>Demanding a One-Time Alimony of 120,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The woman Xu Qiuyue hired lawyers Dong Yu and Chen Zhigao to represent her in filing a criminal complaint in the French Concession court against her husband, Chen Jiongwen, for deceit and abandonment. The original complaint is recorded as follows: "For deceit, abandonment, and opium addiction, please prosecute according to the law and additionally file a civil suit requesting a judgment for alimony. The facts and reasons are stated separately as follows: (Facts) The plaintiff married the defendant as a concubine in May of the old calendar in the 12th year of the Republic of China. In the 13th year, the defendant's wife, Huang, passed away. He became addicted to opium and was confused all day long. The plaintiff advised him to no avail, and quarrels arose frequently. In April of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the defendant remarried Zhu as his successor. Zhu's nature was fierce, and she often gave the plaintiff the cold shoulder. The defendant also listened to Zhu's slander, and his treatment of the plaintiff gradually became alienated. There was constant scolding within the family. At that time, the defendant stated to the plaintiff that quarrels were inevitable between wives and concubines, and it would be better to live separately. In July of the same year, he accompanied the plaintiff to Shanghai, using the difficulty of finding a suitable house as an excuse to stay in a hotel temporarily. Little did she know that the defendant harbored malicious intentions to abandon her and secretly returned to his hometown residence without telling her. He never came back, and despite repeated letters urging him to come to Shanghai, he ignored her. The plaintiff's funds dwindled, and she had no choice but to move back to her mother's house. From then on, the defendant stopped caring about the plaintiff's life and no longer visited the plaintiff's mother's house. The plaintiff repeatedly sent letters but received no reply. She personally went to visit him several times, but he refused to let her in and then moved without a trace. The plaintiff has repeatedly suffered and is filled with remorse. The defendant used insidious tricks to deceive a weak woman, leaving the plaintiff with no means of support and no way to advance or retreat. (Reasons) The plaintiff and the defendant are husband and concubine, and in law, they are family members. The defendant has a duty to provide alimony. The plaintiff is now 24 years old and requires 200 yuan per month for living expenses. Calculating for 50 years, the defendant should pay the plaintiff 120,000 yuan in one lump sum. The defendant owns millions of dollars in property. The plaintiff's request is reasonable in law and in sentiment. Based on the above facts and reasons, the court is requested to consider that the plaintiff met the wrong person and is adrift without support. In addition to prosecuting the defendant according to the law, it is also requested that the court order the defendant to pay the plaintiff 120,000 yuan in alimony in one lump sum and bear the costs of this case." The defendant failed to appear after being summoned yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer stated the circumstances. Judge Zhu ordered that the defendant be summoned again for questioning.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Middle School Requests Budget Increase</p>
<p>Call for Education Fee Committee Meeting If No Results</p>
<p>Schools province-wide will postpone reopening after the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Communication On the morning of the 16th of this month, principals of provincial middle schools gathered at the Provincial Middle School. Principals and representatives from schools including Shangzhong, Yangzhong, Tongzhong, Zhenzhong, Taizhong, Huaianzhong, Songzhong, Aquatic Products School, Song Girls' Middle School, and Xu Girls' Middle School discussed and resolved six items: (1) What to do about the cancellation of the remaining funds for the 18th year's temporary expenses as decided by the Education Fee Committee? The resolution was to strongly oppose this decision. Two measures were adopted: (a) Send a representative to meet with Chairman Ye to request the immediate disbursement of the subsidy fees owed by the provincial government for both the 18th and 19th years in order to clear the temporary expenses for that year. (b) Submit a request to the Education Department to convene an Education Fee Committee meeting before August 5th to reconsider this matter, and at the same time send a direct letter to the Education Fee Committee detailing the reasons and requesting reconsideration to allow for the restoration of funds. (2) The amount of temporary fees for the 19th year allocated to each school by the Education Department is far from meeting the actual needs of the schools. What should be done? The resolution was to adopt two measures: (a) Explain to the Education Department that the distribution and announcement of the temporary fees for the 19th year was delayed until the end of the year, while schools had to make expenditures during the year to meet practical needs, resulting in significant discrepancies. Efforts must be made to provide relief. (b) Before mid-August, each school should submit to the Education Department the amount of temporary fees actually spent in the 19th year, along with receipts, for review and verification, and funds should be allocated accordingly. (3) How should the temporary fees for the 20th year be determined? The resolution was to request the Education Department to verify and announce the fees within two months after the start of the year to avoid repeating the difficulties encountered in the 19th year, where the amount was determined after the fact. (4) The budget for regular expenses for the 20th year also does not meet actual needs. What should be done? The resolution was to request the Education Department to resubmit the previous request to expand the regular expenses for the 20th year and to submit the proposal to the Education Fee Committee for review and approval at the Education Fee Committee meeting convened before August 5th, and to make every effort to increase the budget. (5) If the convening of the Education Fee Committee cannot be realized or if the meeting results still adhere to the original stance, what should be done? The resolution was to adopt four measures: (a) Beforehand, each principal should explain the actual difficulties faced by the schools to Director Chen, Chairman Ye, and Director Niu. (b) When necessary, make a public announcement detailing the aforementioned difficulties to society. (c) When necessary, publish a notice in the newspapers informing students that the start of the 20th year will be temporarily postponed. (d) Principals should resign immediately if the various funding shortages prevent the schools from being maintained or continued. (6) The phrase "examination results are satisfactory" on graduation certificates is too general and lacks effectiveness. How should it be improved? The resolution was to submit a request to the Education Department for approval to include the students' academic, conduct, and physical education grades for each semester on the back of the graduation certificate to acknowledge and encourage achievement.</p>

<h3>Breathing a Sigh of Relief</h3>
<p>The Eagle Team Forcefully Defeats Shangda</p>
<p>Thirty-Four to Twenty-Five</p>
<p>Referee Stands Up for the Country</p>
<p>Cannon Team Sends Out a Mighty Force Tonight</p>
<p>Last night was the second match for the Japanese Shangda Basketball Team in Shanghai. As a result, they lost to the Eagle Team by a score of 25 to 34. The Cannon Team will be in action tonight at 8:00 PM against the Japanese army, still in the basketball room.</p>
<p>Eagles Display Their Might The Eagle Team was superior in both form and technique last night. The Japanese army relied only on their strong physical strength. However, the Eagle Team also fought to the death to resist. Initially, the Eagle Team had an overwhelming advantage of nine to two. Shangda chased the score to ten to seven. The Eagle Team then won by a large margin of fifteen to seven. The first half ended with fifteen to thirteen in favor of the Eagles. In the second half, Shangda once chased the score to twenty-two to nineteen. Seeing this difficult situation, the Eagle Team unleashed their full power and launched a counterattack, finally winning by a large margin of thirty-four to twenty-five. The spectators were delighted.</p>
<p>Coach Participates Shangda's coach, Ueda, was a player from Liaodong, Japan. Seeing that Shangda had already lost, he joined the battle, trying to turn the tide. At one point, the score was twenty-nine to twenty-five with five minutes remaining. But in the end, nothing was gained, and his technique was mediocre. The Japanese army had no confidence in throwing the ball.</p>
<p>Using Chinese Shao Ji, the referee last night, used Chinese. Shangda protested and asked to use English, but he remained unmoved. In a competition in China, Chinese should be used. The Japanese had no choice but to accept it, which was quite a victory for the Chinese people.</p>

<p>Paris, 17th (electric dispatch) English and American players are today competing for the Davis Cup tennis championship here, with each winning one singles match, resulting in a draw. The doubles match will be held tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Global Attention After Ten Years</h3>
<p>It has been eleven years since England and America last competed in the Davis Cup, and it has been far away in 1920 when the United States eliminated England in the second week of the competition. This reunion has attracted global attention. The British believe that this year is the period of British revival with the strongest strength and the greatest hope. The American team's players are the youngest this year, and everyone is worried that they will not be able to win the competition.</p>
<h3>Wimbledon Champion Loses</h3>
<p>In today's first singles match, the American Wood, the Wimbledon champion, lost to the Englishman Austin. Wood's serve was very strong, but he lost three sets in a row. However, the competition was fierce, with the third set having a total of fourteen games and the fourth set twelve games. Austin's pressure balls were fierce and corner shots were accurate. Wood was busy coping with Austin's ever-changing strategy. In the second singles match, Shields defeated Baly easily without much effort.</p>
<h3>America May Win the Doubles Match</h3>
<p>With each side winning one singles match, the doubles match has not yet been decided, and two singles matches on the third day will be necessary. The American team, Van Lingle and Lord, are likely to win the doubles match.</p>
<h3>French Spectators Greatly Worried</h3>
<p>The French are paying close attention to the battle between England and America, but they are greatly worried that they may not be able to keep the Davis Cup this year. This is because the two teams in the Interzone Final are both very strong, and France may not be able to win. The finals will be held next week.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Games</h3>
<p>Scheduled for September 12-14</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, in order to participate in the National Games, has scheduled the Provincial Games to be held from September 12th to 14th.

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Reports to the Education Department</h3>
<p>Interim Standards for Secondary School Curriculum Experiment Results (I)</p>
<p>The Interim Standards for Primary and Secondary School Curriculum have been promulgated and implemented for experimentation by the Ministry of Education for over a year. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has established a Research Committee on Curriculum Standards for Primary and Secondary Schools. Now, following the Ministry's order to report the results of the experiment, the Bureau will reconvene to discuss and compile a report based on the results of the experiments conducted by various primary and secondary schools in the city. In addition to the primary school section already published in the previous report, the full text of the secondary school section is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Experiment [Interim Standards for Secondary School Curriculum]</h3>
<p>Result Report</p>
<p>Chinese Language</p>
<p>Second, Time Allocation</p>
<p>(I) The time allocated for intensive reading instruction in junior high school Chinese should be increased to four hours [Reason] According to the experimental results, the form of intensive reading and composition is relatively long and the content is relatively complex, so each unit cannot be completed within three hours. If it is shorter, three hours is a bit too long. Thus, each week's teaching materials are often divided. If one hour can be added, the longer and more complex ones can be completed within the week, and the shorter and simpler ones can be connected to two articles, which can also be completed within each week. Moreover, most of the textbooks applicable to each semester prescribed in the market have forty to fifty articles. On average, there should be intensive reading guidance for two articles per week, and the time is already insufficient. In addition, grammar and rhetoric instructions, questions, tests, dictation reports, discussions, and review of notes require even more time for grade assessment. It is difficult to take care of everything. Therefore, it seems that intensive reading guidance should be scheduled for four hours per week.</p>
<p>(II) It seems that one hour should be added to the junior high school calligraphy class within the Chinese language class [Reason] Practicing calligraphy outside of class provides no opportunity for on-site guidance, making it difficult for students to improve. It seems that one hour of calligraphy time should be added to the six hours per week for intensive reading, extensive reading guidance, and composition practice.</p>
<p>(III) High school Chinese composition should be assigned once a week, alternating between in-class and out-of-class assignments each week [Reason] According to page 14 (3) of the High School General Course Curriculum Standard, composition practice (1) assigned composition in the classroom can cultivate students' habits and abilities of quick writing. Out-of-class composition can cultivate students' habits of detailed writing and expressing their abilities as much as possible. Therefore, it seems that composition should be assigned once a week, alternating between in-class and out-of-class assignments each week.</p>
<p>Fourth, Teaching Material Outline</p>
<p>(I) The proportion of classical Chinese materials in each grade of junior high school Chinese teaching materials should be slightly increased [Reason] According to students' learning status, they seem to have a deeper impression of classical Chinese selections. In terms of recitation, classical Chinese is especially effective. Junior high school is the foundation for cultivating students' classical Chinese skills. If the amount of classical Chinese teaching materials is not reduced excessively, it is easier to get training opportunities.</p>
<p>English</p>
<p>Second, Homework Requirements</p>
<p>The procedure for ear, mouth, eye, and hand training in the high school English homework requirements column is well coordinated, but high school English should especially focus on eye and hand practice [Reason] High school English courses should focus on training reading and writing skills, so eye and hand practice is more important than ear and mouth training.</p>
<p>Third, Time Allocation</p>
<p>Junior high school English grammar and reading books should be taught separately [Reason] Mixed teaching of grammar and reading books is in line with learning principles, but the results of the trial implementation are not as good as separate teaching, which can be mutually confirmed and systematic. The five hours of English should be stipulated as three hours for reading books and two hours for grammar.</p>
<p>Fourth, Teaching Material Outline</p>
<p>(I) The content of the high school English teaching material outline is still rich, but English grammar for the first and second grades of the general high school should be included [Reason] If the first and second grades do not teach grammar separately, the foundation of sentence construction and composition will not be solid, and the rhetoric essentials of the third grade will be difficult to learn.</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>Second, Teaching Material Outline</p>
<p>(I) There are too many political historical materials [Reason] The function of history is to examine the past and understand the present, and to use the gains of past human life, academic thoughts, and ideas as a way to improve today's human life and social undertakings. However, according to the curriculum standards, it seems to focus too much on political historical materials of past dynasties, so it is appropriate to compress that historical material as much as possible and increase the historical material of people's livelihood and the historical material of academic thought. (II) The teaching material outline should be based on the objectives listed and take the Three Principles of the People as the central ideology [Reason] Although the history curriculum is inevitably based on a flat narrative of facts due to its timeliness, there should be a central ideology to connect all materials. For example, our country now uses the Three Principles of the People as the standard for pure people's thought, and the objective item of the curriculum standard also says that it aims to expound the historical origin of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the teaching material outline may as well use the origin or evolution of the Three Principles of the People as a central ideology, so that scholars have a purpose in learning, and historical materials will not be scattered and have nothing to return to.</p>
<p>(III) Too much emphasis is placed on the chronological system [Reason] The curriculum standards for national history and foreign history in high and junior high schools are all narrated in chronological order, so the comprehensive analysis method is not convenient to use, and most of the materials in ancient history are not convenient to connect with current affairs. It seems that the compilation of the chronological system should be broken, and various important activities in human life should be used as learning units.</p>
<p>(IV) Chinese and foreign history should be linked to each other [Reason] Chinese history and foreign history should be taught separately, but it is appropriate to link them when teaching, so that scholars can understand the characteristics of the history of various countries, use the comparative observation, analysis, and synthesis methods, and cultivate a world view. The teaching material outline seems to have not taken into account this aspect.</p>
<p>(V) Junior high school national history has always been taught from ancient times to modern times, but the results obtained from teaching seem to require reversal. If it is taught from modern times to ancient times, it will not only be more effective, but also avoid many difficulties in teaching [Reason] 1. Anyone who studies history admits that ancient times are more difficult than modern times. The further away from us the history is, the more difficult it is to study, because there are many things in ancient history that need to be distinguished between true and false, and we have to bring a little textual research. People who don't have much research on history feel the most difficult about textual research. This is the reason why ancient history is more difficult to read than modern history. Now, let the first-year students who have less research on history read the most difficult ancient history, and let the second-year students who have more learning on history read the easiest modern history. Such a reversal of difficulty will inevitably cause difficulties in teaching. 2. Anyone who studies history feels that the more ancient, the more boring it is, because ancient times are far away and it is not easy to evoke imagination, and it is difficult to understand the relationship with our current life. Modern history is like something that happened yesterday, and it is easy to evoke imagination and feel that it is related to ourselves. Now, putting boring ancient history to first-year students is like giving a head start to those who want to enter the hall of history. It will be difficult for them to develop an interest in studying history again. If modern history is used as the starting point, it can not only make students have a strong interest in history and work hard to explore, but also make students start to pay attention to current affairs, develop the habit of reading newspapers, and make students research layer by layer from modern to modern times, from modern times to the Middle Ages, from the Middle Ages to ancient times to explore the origin of the current situation and the source of today's major problems. 3. Distributing teaching materials and estimating time are the things that teachers should pay most attention to, but special holidays and other reasons often break the distribution and estimation, so that the last part is abandoned. Teaching history cannot be outside of this. It is often because there is not enough time that the most important modern history is abandoned. If modern history is used as the starting point, there will be no such concerns.</p>

<p>British Club Movement</p>
<p>There are two famous British doctors, one of whom is a woman, who are planning a great thing to organize a health club throughout the country so that the working class of the whole country can get proper entertainment and benefit their physical and mental health. The club has facilities such as swimming pools, dance halls, card rooms, and other kinds of entertainment, as well as dining rooms and wine stalls to supply members with food and drink, but the wine is limited to beer because it is not easy to get drunk and is relatively beneficial. Each headquarters has 2,000 members, each family paying one shilling and a few pence per week to cover the cost of various physical exercises. The babies of each family can roam around in the club all day, and the children can go there after school. In the afternoon, it is specially for mothers to gather, and in the evening, parents can go together to seek a night of joy. They also have an advisory department for all kinds of trivial matters of the members to provide consultation. Whether old or young, married or unmarried, if they have any difficult problems to solve, they can go to discuss them. This is truly one of the most beneficial clubs in the world.</p>
<p>Children in the American Film Industry</p>
<p>Parents in the United States, seeing that children can earn a lot of money in the film industry, send their children to make movies. As a result, the number of child actors is increasing day by day. The local authorities, in order to ensure their safety, have strict restrictions on film companies. Each child must not work more than two hours a day, and must not be under strong lights for more than thirty seconds at a time.</p>
<h3>Blind Donkey</h3>
<p>—You Cen</p>
<p>The Blind Donkey is a heroic man in Baodu Mountain, Shandong Province, named Zhang Baishun. He is blind in one eye and has a very strong personality. Whenever there is a bandit alert, he immediately steps forward, carrying two guns to meet him, and carrying a food bag as a farmer trading to avoid bandit suspicion. He travels quickly over mountains and ridges. The name Blind Donkey comes from this.</p>
<p>Every time he fights with bandits, he often leads several people to attack their vitals or directly explore the bandit dens, so the bandits are in chaos without fighting. He then exerts his strength to capture and kill them. Those who stand in his way are overwhelmed. At night, his single eye is bright and his vision can reach several miles away. The bandits all warn each other not to offend him. There is also a saying that if you do evil at home, you will meet the Blind Donkey when you go out. The hundreds of villages in the south of the mountain rely on him for a peaceful life. His heroic spirit is like this.</p>
<p>What is most admirable is that after the bandits do not offend him, he actually sends a letter challenging them, agreeing on the date and place of the battle. Whether the bandits honor the agreement or not, he then deliberately sets up suspicious soldiers and robs the bandits' wives and children as conditions for ceding land and paying compensation, and all the proceeds are used to purchase guns and equipment for the militia, without taking a penny for himself.</p>
<p>This spring, the army jointly suppressed the Baodu Mountain bandits. The Blind Donkey was recruited by Guo, the commander of the 347th regiment of the 58th division of the army, and ordered to be a guide to explore caves and find nests. He was very helpful. I came to the mountains with the army and heard the name of the Blind Donkey several times. I am afraid that he will be buried and unknown, so I recorded his outline here to serve as a lesson for those who are willing to suffer from bandits and are timid and dare not resist.

<h3>Clever Response to Thank You Wine</h3>
<p>—Jian Fan</p>
<p>Someone used Three-Star Brandy to thank Mr. Li Jinglan of Linchuan for his painting. It happened to be the season of Huangmei, and Mr. Li took the wine and listened to the rain, and his elegant interest was greatly developed. He came up with a clever idea and replied with a couplet "Three-Star Brandy" and "April Huangmei Day" to inscribe a long postscript to report it. It is exquisitely neat and seamless.

<h3>Bee Matchmaker Flower</h3>
<p>—Chi Fo</p>
<p>Recently, stories of free love and amorous affairs have been heard from time to time. Those who are dissolute should be criticized by the world. As for what I heard about Ms. K, her talent is like Xie Daoyun and her encounter is like Zhuo Wenjun, which should be discussed separately. Ms. K is from eastern Zhejiang. She is beautiful and intelligent, and has a innocent nature. At the age of nineteen, she graduated from a girls' middle school in Shanghai and married Mr. D from the same town. Mr. D is upright and ambitious. He first entered a certain higher school in Japan to study engineering, and then he thought that his hometown had many great Party-State figures, so he changed to a military academy. He got up at dawn to exercise his body and burned the midnight oil to study hard. He was overworked and suffered from stomach problems. After getting married, he went to the East again. Unfortunately, he died suddenly after less than a month. Ms. K cried bitterly when she heard the news. From then on, she lived a lonely life and spent her time teaching. There is a women's school in the town that specializes in accepting women who have dropped out of school and teaching them ordinary knowledge. The results are excellent and it is famous. Ms. K entered the women's school as a teacher, and the teachers and students have a very close relationship. It is probably because the women's world is dark and they deeply feel the same disease and pity each other. Once, Mr. S, a primary school teacher who studied beekeeping, was young, handsome, and romantic. He heard that Ms. K's hometown was a land of industry before it produced great people. Agriculture, mulberry, and animal husbandry have always been requested. The water honey peaches and big taro have long been famous and called specialties. In recent years, there have been many beekeeping and sericulture families. Mr. S heard that the women's school had a lot of Italian bees, so he came to visit. He suddenly saw Ms. K. During the conversation, the affection was lingering. A bee flew on Mr. S's lapel. Ms. K waved it away and it plunged into Ms. K's arms, buzzing and flapping its wings. Ms. K smiled at it. After that, the two often visited each other. Mr. S often revealed his intention to propose. Ms. K only laughed foolishly. Her heart was uneasy and she could not make up her mind, so she visited her friend and discussed it. The friend said to Ms. K: Women are not forbidden to remarry by law. Such a beautiful face is like flowing water, how can they waste it idly? Moreover, the ancients used red leaves as matchmakers and it has been passed down as a good story. Bees and butterflies are originally matchmakers for hundreds of flowers. Now they wave them away but they come again. Isn't it a match made in heaven? What's the suspicion? Ms. K's intention was decided. Now, a pair of Bi people plant flowers in several fields and raise bees in several rooms, wandering among the misty light and stream sounds to spend their honey-like time. I named this article "Bee Matchmaker Flower."</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Reading Paintings</h3>
<p>—Jiang Taihua</p>
<p>Since the Qing Dynasty, the painters of Yangzhou have first counted Wang Su Xiaomou, and the two families who competed with him are Shi Lianxi and Ye Hang. The two families both took the law from Xinluo. Xiaomou's brushwork is better than unrestrained, and the coloring is better than elegant. Ye Hang Nai avoids his strengths and specializes in being profound to seek vividness. Gu Zhangjilan is an indoor disciple of Ye Hang, and also takes the best of Xiaomou. Therefore, he was already famous at the age of thirty. In his middle age, he reached a more exquisite state. Zhang still thought it was not enough, and devoted himself to hard work. Now, even though he is over seventy years old, he still paints every day as a routine, so every time he puts down his pen, the later sages all respectfully praise him and feel that he cannot reach it. I have been friends with the scholar Tianzan, the son of a philosopher, for a long time. I have obtained three paintings by Zhang. One is a poem about writing cranes and Qin books on the same boat. The spring water is rising and the wave marks are alive. The plum blossoms are blooming on both sides. A small boat is leisurely between them. A guest is sitting in the middle, twisting his beard and looking up to the sky, smiling, with the fun of being outside the world, and the cranes and the children on the boat are all looking back with affection, unlike those who do not belong to each other. One is a mountain temple bell sound, with pine waves and cloud shadows. A monk is carrying a bamboo hat and returning halfway up the mountain. Above the halfway point, it is sealed by clouds. Only the corner of the Vatican palace is revealed on the pine peak outside the ridge. The sound of the bell cannot be painted, but there is a returning monk to show the time when the bell is ringing, and the Vatican palace to show the place where the bell is ringing, and the sound of the bell is faintly audible in the ear unintentionally. One writes about peach blossoms and pheasants. A white peach blossom is graceful and precious like a Han palace person. Two pheasants are facing each other on the branches, wanting to sing. The spring air is full of paper, and the color is bright and extremely fresh, which is very different from the old man's pen. Although the paintings by Zhang that I have collected are only a few, they do not fully capture Zhang's abilities. However, the characters, landscapes, flowers, and birds are all prepared, and the creation of the environment, sketching, and setting of colors are all excellent. How can those who imitate them hope to reach his back? In the summer of Xinwei, Zhang will hold a hundred recent works at the same time as Huang Jun Hanhou's bamboo carving exhibition in Shanghai, which can add a lot of color to the art world. In the past, Gu Changkang was called the three absolutes for his talent, painting, and madness. Zhang has no madness like Changkang, but his painting name has been promoted from one county to the whole country. Not only can he follow the ancestral martial arts, but also surpass his predecessors.</p>
<h3>Rambling Talks on Traveling in Korea (9)</h3>
<p>—Ji Ping</p>
<p>Since the overseas Chinese in Korea are in a superior position, the number of people from China who go to Korea to make a living is increasing day by day. The Japanese, seeing this situation, have come up with various methods to restrict the entry of overseas Chinese, repel those who have already entered, or instruct a group of Japanese and Korean vagrants to bully overseas Chinese. It is said that this group of vagrants often publicly insults them on the prosperous streets and provokes them for no reason. People are not made of wood or stone, who would be willing to suffer losses in front of their eyes? Who would be willing to lose the face of the country? If they show a little resistance, they will be scolded and beaten. If you call the police, he will stand by and ignore you. You have no choice but to hold back your tears and swallow your anger and escape from their circle. Where can you go to complain? It is only because the motherland is not prosperous that no one will protect you. Therefore, overseas Chinese cannot rely on their families or the country, but only "rely on God for food."</p>
<p>The number of unemployed people in Korea has been increasing in recent years. The Governor-General's Office nominally provides relief to the poor Korean people who are unemployed, but it is actually actively repelling our innocent overseas Chinese. Since April 1 of this year, it has proposed a total budget of 65 million Japanese yen to complete the plan in three years, such as water management, road repairs, and port construction in various provinces, counties, and prefectures, so that unemployed Koreans can have work to do and avoid becoming bandits and disturbing the local area. It also established a mutual aid organization for Korean workers and formulated a secret order to restrict the use of Chinese workers. It was found that this kind of secret order is not only implemented in various government-run projects, but also in individual contracting businesses. In the treaty ports, only one-fifth or less of the workers used in factories are allowed to be Chinese workers, and the local police authorities in various provinces, prefectures, counties, and townships issue police orders based on domestic law and the proposals of autonomous organizations to force Chinese workers to obtain labor permits before they can work hard under their strict restrictions. The conditions for obtaining a permit are very harsh, such as (1) the application for a permit must be written in Japanese, (2) a health certificate from a Japanese doctor must be obtained first, and (3) only one year of work is allowed. After the expiration, all the above conditions must be fulfilled again to apply for a permit. Therefore, although the general foremen and landlords want to hire cheap and hardworking Chinese workers, they are restricted by the harsh conditions of the officialdom and have the suffering of being unable to help. Since the promulgation of this secret order, Chinese workers have been unemployed and wandering in foreign countries, which is very pitiful. Our country's government has never heard of any relief measures, and it does not care about the lives of overseas Chinese or the face of the country, which is really a very painful fact.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese are so harsh on our overseas Chinese, we should naturally return this kind of equivalent condition to them. It is not too much in reason and emotion. According to the latest survey, the ratio of overseas Chinese in Japan and Korea to Japanese and Korean overseas Chinese in China is as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Japan 25,963 people Japanese overseas Chinese in China 158,867 people Overseas Chinese in Korea 91,466 people Korean overseas Chinese in China 599,890 people (Among them, two-thirds are Korean overseas Chinese in Yanji, Helong, Wangqing, Hunchun, Fusong, Antu, and other counties, that is, the so-called Jian Island area, which are Korean overseas Chinese who are the vanguard of the Japanese. The remaining one-third are Korean overseas Chinese scattered in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and other provinces.)</p>
<p>Total number of Japanese and Korean overseas Chinese 117,429 people Total number of Japanese and Korean overseas Chinese in China 758,757 people Comparative difference 641,297 people</p>
<p>From the above figures, it can be seen that the number of Japanese and Korean expatriates living in China is 641,297 more than the number of Chinese expatriates living in Japan and Korea, almost six times more. In the future, unless both parties respect the equal and mutually beneficial commercial treaty, we will never allow them to abuse us like cattle and horses, while we treat them like honored guests. We will never tolerate this unequal treatment again. Before the new Sino-Japanese commercial treaty is signed, it is hoped that our diplomatic authorities will carefully consider this point and the issue of Korean naturalization in order to achieve a permanent effect.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Novel</p>
<h3>??? (26)</h3>
<p>—Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Ziliang thought to himself: Who wants to drink tea? If I had known it was for myself, I wouldn't have bothered to pour it.</p>
<p>"I don't want to drink!"</p>
<p>"You must drink!"</p>
<p>Ziliang was afraid of arguing with her, so he drank the tea in one gulp.</p>
<p>"Turn on the light!"</p>
<p>The order from the Internal Affairs Department came down again. Ziliang saw that it was indeed getting dark, so he went to the door and turned on the light.</p>
<p>"Go tell the nanny: I can't eat dinner, I want porridge."</p>
<p>Ziliang seemed to be a servant of the lady, being sent around by her. He went downstairs and told the nanny, then went back upstairs to the room to see that the lady didn't look sick, so he felt relieved and quietly went to the pavilion to turn on the light and do his official business. Today, he has revised a total of eight or nine articles. Even if he works late into the night, it will be difficult to finish the more than one hundred and sixty books. At most, he can get rid of half of them, so he has to do as much as he can. Ziliang was revising the first article when he suddenly heard a strange cry in the room:</p>
<p>"Not good!"</p>
<p>This was the lady's cry of surprise. Ziliang threw down his pen and rushed to the room and saw the lady sitting in the middle of the bed, pointing to the coat rack:</p>
<p>"There's a ghost! There's a ghost!"</p>
<p>Her eyes showed horror, as if the ghost was standing in the room.</p>
<p>"Don't be scared! Don't be scared! There's nothing, I'm here."</p>
<p>Although Ziliang was comforting her, she still cried out in surprise:</p>
<p>"Look! There's a white ghost over there!"</p>
<p>"No! Where?"</p>
<p>"Right here!"</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Gold Price Initially Rises, Then Declines</p>
<p>Optimism Regarding German Debt</p>
<p>Market Sentiment Suddenly Turns Negative</p>
<p>Fluctuations Extremely Strong: Yesterday, the 18th, the benchmark gold price rose and then fell, with considerable volatility. Between the morning and noon, there were over eight taels of discrepancies, creating a confusing situation. Ultimately, it fell slightly by one and a half taels. The silver market fell back, and while US stocks showed a slight increase, they did not cause much influence. Therefore, the gold price, which had initially risen, pushed past the 750-tael mark but was then met with strong selling pressure. Speculators and Dalian banks frequently sold off. As the foreign exchange rate strengthened and then weakened, with covert stability, the gold price turned downward, sharply reducing by seven or eight taels, retreating within 50 taels, with only three or four taels of fluctuation. Finally, it closed at 47 taels and zero. The afternoon was closed due to Saturday. Recalling the market conditions this week, it has become a winding situation, coinciding with the German loan news being divergent, and since the September term entered the market, the trend has been upward. In the last three days, the difference between the high and low prices has been 22 taels and 4 qian. Compared to the initial opening price on the morning of the 16th, it has increased by 7 taels and 5 qian. The market situation yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Opening Price Pushes Through the 50-Tael Mark: The September opening price started by adding three taels, reaching 751 taels and a half. Large bars fell back by a quarter. Public and private telegrams both showed a decrease of 3/8 in the silver price. However, the market was stable. Subsequently, due to selling activity, it immediately dropped to 48 taels. Then, a sharp rise began as HSBC bought English gold at 1875, Mitsubishi sold 125, and Fuchang and others purchased from Zhengjin and Shanghai at prices ranging from .0625 to .125. With the efforts of Qianchangxiang and Dadecheng, it jumped by six or seven taels, reaching 54 taels and 9 qian. After that, Fuyu and Yuanmaoyong began selling, suppressing the price to 51 taels and a half. When the English gold announcement was released, it had shrunk by 125, US dollars by 375, and Japanese gold added 1.75 fen, causing the price to rise to 52 taels and 8 qian. However, Mitsui and others sold English gold at 125, and Zhifeng, Yongqianchangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, and other major players sold off, causing the price to plummet by more than five taels, breaking the 50-tael mark. Wanxing and others also sold, reaching 10.0 at 47 taels. Around 10:30, the price on the board was 50 taels. Because retail investors were buying and Sumitomo bought spot Dalian at 1 tael, 6 qian, and 1 fen, it dropped to 47 taels, 7 or 8 qian around 10:50. Suddenly, the banks bought English gold at 125 to 1875, causing it to jump up by 4 taels again, and hedging came in, reaching 52 taels at 11:10. Unexpectedly, the banks were willing to sell English gold again, totaling 125 to 1875. Around 11:30, it was 48 taels, 6 or 7 qian, immediately rising to 50 taels, 6 or 7 qian, with the state being unstable.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline Approaching Closing: Later, the Dalian banks, Yuanmao, Tianxiang, Yuanchun, and others all sold off. It was also rumored that German debt matters might be optimistic, and the market sentiment suddenly turned negative. In just seven or eight minutes, it dropped by four taels, ending at 46 taels and 5 qian. In an instant, it pulled up to 2 taels, reaching 8 taels and 3 qian. When the noon closing came, it was 47 taels, then suppressed again to 6 taels and a half, then raised again to outside of 7 taels. Compared to the previous day (according to the listed price), it fell by 1 tael and a half. According to the half-day, the maximum price was 54 taels and 9 qian, and the minimum price was 46 taels and 5 qian, with an increase or decrease of 8 taels and 4 qian.</p>
<p>Spot Bullion Not Expected to Be Lacking: The morning price for goods was 51 taels, and the noon closing was 47 taels. The listed price was changed to 792 taels and 6 qian, a reduction of 40 taels to 45 or 46 taels. Registration was 45 taels for July and August, 47 taels for September, and 45 taels for replenishment. Also, there were not many customer sales of spot bullion, and the public orders that the industry had previously taken in are now willing to sell off. Therefore, there is no shortage of spot goods on the market. It is heard that Yingfeng once bought more than 2,000 bars at a price of 11 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen. Observing the current situation, it is feared that the price cannot rise.</p>
<p>Japanese Major Players Frequently Sell Off: The transaction statistics of each firm on the board seem to be complex. Dadecheng, Yuantai, Fuxingyong, and others all bought, while Zhifengyong, Yuda, Futaiheng, Bingxing, Yuanheng, Tianxiang, Shunli, and Wanxing all sold. Daxingyong, Yuanxingyong, Yuancheng, Yuanmao, and Qianchangxiang had many ins and outs. Yuanmaoyong had more sales than purchases. It is heard that Japanese merchants and Wu Mou had sold off. Other firms had irregular ins and outs. Dalian banks sold more than 3,000 bars and bought more than 1,000 bars. Guangdong banks bought a small number.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Tightens and Then Loosens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, English, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported shrinkage, but the market was stable and firm, while English-American exchange rates fell slightly, and English-American exchange rates rose to the Shanghai market. Various exchanges tightened and then loosened. HSBC's listed price had shrunk by half a grade. English gold at 125 is now 1 shilling, 2 pence, 875. American dollars reduced by 375 is 30 yuan. Japanese gold added 1.75 fen is 1 tael, 6 qian, 4 fen and a half. The rest were all listed low. The bank's internal market was initially firm but then weakened. The gold market turned from good to bad, with the 50-tael mark being broken and then re-entered. When noon closed, compared to the day before, there was not much difference. Chinese merchants such as Fuchang and Yuanheng bought English gold, and other firms also sold a little, totaling about 200,000 pounds. American dollars still had little in and out. Dalian banks sold tens of thousands of Japanese dollars in the afternoon because it was Saturday.</p>
<p>English Exchange Rate: The internal market fluctuated by 125 in half a day. The morning bid price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, .0625, the buying price was 125. HSBC absorbed September 1875. Mitsubishi sold 125, and also sold August and September .0625 to 125. Zhengjin and Shanghai also sold at the same price. Huabi and Mitsubishi sold September .0625. Pangen sold .0625 to 125.

Zhizhi bought October 1875, and Youli sold. Zhejiang bought August 1875. The noon closing bid price was 125 to 1875, and the buying price was 1875 to 25.</p>

<h3>Silver Bars Break the 13-Pence Mark Again</h3>
<p>According to a London telegram yesterday, the decline in silver bar prices has begun again. Forward prices have fallen below the 13-pence mark, reversing the slight increase of the past few days. The near-term price has fallen by .25 to 13 pence, and the forward price has also shrunk by .25 to 12 pence .9375. China has sold slightly, and buyers are hesitant. The market was stable at closing. After closing, the market turned firm, and the United States is inclined to maintain the market. A New York telegram stated that the American silver price has also shrunk by .375, with spot prices at 27 and 7/8 cents. English to American dollars has decreased by .0625 to 4 dollars, 84 and 7/8 cents. American to English dollars has also fallen by 9/32 to 4 dollars, 85 and 1/16 cents.

<h3>The Atmosphere of the Financial Market is Desolate</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the weekend, and banks closed in the afternoon as usual, so the financial market was unremarkable. The settlement aspects were also quite simple. In short, the current stagnation of the silver and money business is the most severe period of the year, so the atmosphere is desolate and people are lax.</p>
<p>Clearing Prices: (Foreign Li) The morning market was 7 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, and a half. The noon market was the same as the morning market due to sparse transactions and no competition. (Silver Clearing) Both the morning and noon markets were 6 fen, slightly better by 2 fen compared to the previous day. Headings were never added with water, but were white.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small foreign coins were also the same in the morning and noon markets, at 6 qian, 5 fen, 1 li, slightly smaller by 1 li, 7 hao, and a half compared to the previous noon. Transactions were made in the morning market for 3,500 jiao, and no transactions in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 qian, 4 fen, 2 li and a half in the morning market, and 6 qian, 4 fen, 2 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu and a half in the noon market. Transactions were made in the morning market for 75,000 jiao, and 30,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were shortened by 1,000 wen to 379,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Inflow and Outflow: (Silver Funds) Bank settlements are mostly done on Saturdays, and procedures are not as streamlined, so inflows and outflows are few. Chinese merchants settled 1.6 to 1.7 million, foreign merchants settled more than 1.2 million, and various goods, foreign exchange, taxes, and other items settled 6.7 to 6.8 million. Out of the warehouse, 800,000. Japanese banks settled more than 3.1 million in various items and took out 200,000 from the warehouse. Money shops and silver public orders settled more than 41 million. Headings settled more than 2.4 million.</p>
<p>Various Route Remittances: Remittances settled more than 500,000, cash received more than 1 million. (Foreign Exchange Remittance Bills) In the morning market, 1.875 million were made, and 785,000 were made in the noon market. Banknotes were only 9,000 in the noon market. Off-market banknotes were 150,000 in the morning market and 120,000 in the noon market. Bank trading was 700,000 in the morning market and 450,000 in the noon market. The bank's foreign accounts settled more than 1.2 million. Banknotes in and out more than 1 million. Money shops and foreign public orders settled more than 4.7 million. Foreign headings settled more than 1.1 million. Foreign exchange borrowing was more than 1.2 million. Small money shops traded 300,000 to 400,000.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Fall More Than Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds did not open in the spot market in the morning, and only the 7-year 20 series had some transactions in the afternoon. The futures market was still active, and sentiment was quite good, but the bond market environment had turned gloomy. Bond prices change with the market, depending on the supply and demand. The trend is confusing, and the price changes are also uncertain. As a result, the 20 series fell back by 1 yuan, and the 19 series fell by 9 jiao in August. The 20 series spot market rose by 2 yuan. The other major series were slightly weak, only by 2 or 3 jiao. The total transaction volume for spot goods for the whole day was only 5,000 yuan, and futures were more than 17.5 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Presents a Mediocre State</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly flat, and major players continue to sell, putting pressure on the market. It is difficult to stimulate the market. On the multi-head side, the situation of the anti-Japanese issue is becoming increasingly tense, and absorbing without releasing it is not an option. The content of the yarn market is extremely complicated.</p>
<p>The Human Bid Rises and Falls Very Slightly: The Exchange's human bid opened in the morning market with gold prices rising and the anti-cargo movement still strong. Each month rose by 8 or 9 qian. In the second round, major players came out and fell. As a result, it rose by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 qian. In the afternoon, each fell by 1, 2, 3, and 4 qian. The turnover was 27,850 bales.

<h3>The Trend of Spot Yarn is Slightly Relaxed</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. Check the statistics of various gangs buying throughout the day for a total of 1,200 bales. Peers entered 350 bales. The market is flat. Various gangs entered 320 bales from Guangdong, 425 bales from the mainland, 65 bales from Jiangxi, 85 bales from Sichuan, 50 bales from Hankou, 50 bales from Qingdao, and 250 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Flat and Unremarkable</h3>
<p>The cotton market has no glory or shame. The overseas cotton market is also flat, the weather is good, and people's hearts are flat. However, the exchange rate is strong, and the calculation of Indian cotton prices is still expensive, so few are imported. As a result, most are watching and not moving forward, and transactions are very clear, so there is no development and it is still in a mediocre situation.</p>
<p>The Hankou Bid Has Little Glory or Shame: The Exchange's Hankou bid opened in the morning market with American cotton showing mixed ups and downs. This month fell by 5 fen, and other months did not move. In the afternoon, it rose slightly by 5 fen. The turnover was 24,800 dan.

<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Show Another Downturn</h3>
<p>American Cotton Varies: Yesterday, American cotton was affected by political news that was favorable to the multi-head side. The weather was good, and the market varied. Futures rose or fell by 1 to 6 points, and spot goods did not move. English cotton futures rose by 8 points, and spot goods rose by 25 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 15 points. Indian cotton was firm due to Liverpool news being good and empty accounts being covered. Pingguoer rose by 2.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 6.25 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 7.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (17th telegram).</p>

<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Rice Market in Hexia Unanimously Declines</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, because the weather was sunny, transactions in Zhengben Street were sluggish. The number of people at the market in the morning was small, and appetites were thin. Su and Chang's thick rice did not change. The higher prices of each were lower by 2 or 3 jiao. The thin rice customer gangs did not move and were also lower by nearly 1 jiao. Luxupu and Yangjian two kinds arrived in a surge and were slow to sell. No glory or shame. Waxy rice was slightly bought by the Yinhua restaurant and tea shops. The opening price was reduced by a foot. Early rice was not available in the market. Sources from the inland: Changshu, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Yixing, Suzhou, Wangting, Qingpu, Sijing, Chonggu, Fengjing, etc., Nos. 11 and 12.</p>
<p>Nanshi: Although the sources of each gang are not many, the weather is clearing and people's hearts are turning weak. City and rural store sales are even more stagnant. Although there are occasional bursts of goods, they are also sporadic. The firm also eats finely. The medium and old customers' deposits are not weak, so even if they make concessions, it is still difficult to sell them. Therefore, the thick japonica rice has fallen by 2 or 3 chi. The thin rice's Ningwei and street sales are slightly fine. The opening price has been reduced by 2 chi. The Luxu Yangjian and Yinhua goods are scarce and the stomach is flat. The situation is returning to a winding pattern. The stock of foreign rice is gradually thinning, and the customer gangs and the local streets' appetite are also light. The price has also shortened by a jiao.</p>
<h3>Futures Flour is Nearly Stable</h3>
<p>Flour Exchange Will Change to Six-Disk Auction Starting Next Week</p>
<p>No Afternoon Trading for Three Weeks</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign wheat quotations fluctuated. Canada was good for 3 jiao, and Chicago was slightly less for 1 jiao. The flour market had no major relationship. This month, the Tianjin gang initially returned some, but then slightly entered again in the afternoon, so the market was very flat. Due to the factories' waiting and seeing and the gold market, the combined price of foreign flour and wheat has not been determined. The inland water has not completely receded, and people's hearts cannot help but be firm. However, in terms of the overall situation, the follow-up is still watching the winding situation. As a result, this month has not moved. August is good for 5 li, September and October are good for 7 and a half li, November is good for 5 li, and December is good for 1 fen.</p>
<p>The flour market is difficult to trade due to the arrival of the Fu Er period. It is scheduled to change the opening time to 9:30 am starting on the 20th and increase the multi-disk auction to 6 disks. No trading will be held for three weeks in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>More Than 3,000 Bags of Spot Wheat Entered the Factory</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was stable this month because of the accumulation of goods and the factories also had a large amount of wheat in stock. There is no possibility of receiving standard goods this month, and people's hearts are still stable. In the long term, due to the low exchange rate, foreign wheat is difficult to trade for a while, and mainland buyers are still quite eager. As a result, this month has not moved. August is better by 1 fen than the previous day, September is better by 3 fen, October and November are better by 2 fen, and December is better by 3 fen. Spot wheat is still stable. The factory's stomach is also neither close nor distant, and there is no intention to promote. A total of more than 3,000 bags of wheat from Nanjing, Chuzhou, Anting, Huangdu, Jiangwan, Penglai, Pudong, Shuangfeng, Zhitang, and Lujiabang were bought by Fuxin, Huafeng, and Xinda.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Doubles Silk Exports are Subject to Special Tax</p>
<p>Same Treatment as Jiangsu and Zhejiang Factories... Taxed 30 Yuan Per Package Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds are Issued with Terms Doubles Silk Factories Have Been Approved to Enjoy the Right to Dispose of Public Bonds, Receiving the Same Treatment as Jiangsu and Zhejiang Singles Silk Factories. The Local Jianghai Customs Has Been Ordered to Collect Special Taxes on All Double Silk Exports at 30 Yuan Per Package from the Date of Promulgation of the Silk Industry Public Bond Regulations to be Used to Allocate Public Bond Funds. The Goods Inspection Bureau Will Determine the Export Quantity of Doubles Silk that was Previously Not Subject to Special Tax and Instruct Each Factory to Supplement it. Therefore, Doubles Silk Exports are Subject to Special Taxes.</p>
<h3>European and American Silk Sales are in a Slump</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market was almost in a slump. The overseas raw silk market was affected by the German economic panic. The silk factories' sales were stagnant and the market was even more sluggish. Yesterday, only Xinfu entered 5 packages of Shanghai white factory Jing, Xinshichang entered 5 packages of Qian Jing, and Meida entered 3 packages of yellow coarse silk. Prices were all flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Needle and Show Eyebrow Trading is Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the needle and show eyebrow green teas from the incoming roads were of great interest to English and French merchants, and trading was booming. The Zhenmei market also showed slight activity, but because the merchants' silver disks were tight, not many transactions were made. Gongxi Zhucha and the Pingshui major gangs on the road to the United States all had sporadic transactions, and the market was quite lively.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Piece Goods Industry in the Anti-Japanese Atmosphere</p>
<p>Customer Gangs are Rushing to Purchase... Prices are Soaring</p>
<p>Local Cotton Cloth: Due to the anti-Japanese incident in recent days, the actual sales gangs are agitated and purchasing. Once implemented, Japanese factory goods cannot be transported. Customer gangs are preparing for a rainy day and are rushing to purchase. Among them, fine cloth sells the most smoothly. The spot goods on the market yesterday have disappeared. Each brand has risen in unison by about 1 qian. Fine twill has also risen accordingly. Yanghe has reached 7 taels and 7 qian, and blue double fish is 7 taels and 6 qian and a half. Because Chinese factory goods account for a large proportion of coarse cloth, it is not as smooth as fine cloth and fine twill. However, affected by the firm cotton yarn, the trend is also strong. 84 raw cloth and 10-pound city cloth are all active. East-West Piece Goods: East goods sell the smoothest and are about to reach their peak. Consistent customer searches have caused prices to soar. Merchants have emptied their spot goods. More than 2,000 pieces of Zhongbing Yuehua thread have been packed out in recent days, so it has reached 2 qian, 4 fen, 2 li and a half yesterday from 2 qian, 3 fen and a half. Big flower is 2 qian and 5 fen, black flower is 2 qian, 4 fen and a half. Zhigong ne has risen by 1 fen or so. Four gentlemen sell for 3 qian, 3 fen. Black Huase Ting has risen from 2 qian, 5 fen and a half to 2 qian, 7 fen. In short, everything is rising, and spot goods are extremely scarce. The Chuanchuan, Han, and Gan gangs are all smooth among the customer gangs, and the inland gangs are also moving. Therefore, sales are so busy that there is no time to handle them.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Rough Sugar White Opens 5,000 Bags: Taikoo Sugar's Listed Price Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegram: Cuban spot sugar prices rose slightly by 3125. New York sugar futures rose by more than 2 points in September and 3 points in the other months. Java sugar futures and spot prices were neither rising nor falling. The association's listed price is based on the fact that the economic severance with Japan will be implemented, and the appetite in various places is very strong, and people's hearts are even better. Dutch sugar and Taikoo sugar's rising trend is even stronger. Rough sugar white price is 11 taels, 3 qian to 3 qian and a half. No. 20 medium sugar white is 10 taels and 9 qian, shouting 11 taels. No. 8 Dutch red is 9 taels and 2 qian, and No. 10 is 9 taels and 6 qian. Taikoo B Mark opened at 11 taels, 8 qian and a half, then rose by 9 qian to 9 qian and a half. The latter market shouted 12 taels. DY Mark price is 11 taels, 5 qian and a half to 6 qian. The market is very smart. The stock of Japanese sugar is also slightly rising. N Mark is 11 taels and 3 qian. J Mark is 11 taels and 7 qian. YT Mark is 11 taels, 2 qian and a half to 3 qian. YRO Mark is 11 taels, 1 qian to 1 qian and a half. YP Mark is 11 taels and 6 qian. TX Mark is 11 taels and 6 qian. AE Mark is 11 taels and 7 qian. The market is very thin. The stock list has Qianxinghao selling more than 1,000 bags of open rough sugar white at a price of 11 taels, 2 qian and 7 and a half fen. Jinfatong also opened more than 1,000 bags at the same price. Hong Kong goods were also sold for the same price. The merchants' willingness to enter is very strong, so the market is smart and has a great rising trend.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>New Arrival of Black Iron Sheet</p>
<p>Black iron sheets, which have been lacking for many days, were said to have arrived in 700 or 800 dan yesterday according to foreign firm news. Therefore, the enamel factories and customer gangs were all happy to hear this news. It was said that 600 or 700 dan had been opened yesterday at a price of 11 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>White Tung Oil Appears to Have Stabilized</p>
<p>Since the sudden rise in Hankou white tung oil the previous week, foreign firms have sold at a maximum of 24 taels and 7 mace per unit. Upon investigation, the reason is that the supply is scarce and domestic sales are appropriate. As such, foreign firms have also slightly increased their outlets at this time, and transactions are slightly brisk. Due to cost considerations, customers have all reacted quickly. In three to four days, the price has risen by as much as two taels. However, foreign firms do not have large stocks, and seeing the market price rise, they have hesitated. Therefore, it soon fell back. According to recent reports from Hankou, it has relaxed to 23 taels and 4 mace. In recent years, local firms have mainly focused on Zhejiang tung oil, and Hankou oil is rare. However, the market still looks to Hankou as its leader. Therefore, Hangzhou also echoed the increase in Hankou tung oil, increasing from 31 yuan per dan to 35 yuan repeatedly, all delivered to Shanghai. However, buyers still find the price too expensive, so transactions are very few. Recently, due to the decline in the Hankou market, Zhejiang tung oil has also followed suit, relaxing to 33 yuan and 45 cents. The market seems to have stabilized at this point, and buyers also do not want the price to be too low. It is heard that upland customers seem to have a slight intention to buy at this price. If it is cheaper, they would rather store it than sell it. Based on this, the current market can be temporarily stabilized and there should be no further changes. However, the time is approaching the hot season, which is the peak sales season. If sales in various places start, then it will be another matter. Local firms' inventories are neither too thick nor too thin, but sales during the peak season will inevitably be slightly more than usual.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>

<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>The Daxin Silk and Satin Store at the corner of Third Ma Road and Stone Road proclaims that since the beginning of summer, its goods have been selling well and business has been exceptionally prosperous. To establish itself as a unique presence in the silk and satin industry, the store has specially woven a type of printed Parisian gauze never before seen in Shanghai. In recent days, the store has received the goods, featuring no fewer than dozens of novel patterns. This fabric is light, brightly colored, inexpensive, and of high quality, unmatched by any other fashionable fabric in Shanghai. It truly deserves to be called a modern masterpiece. Socialites have been rushing to purchase this fabric in recent days, considering it an essential garment for summer social events.</p>
<p>The Dachang Silk and Satin Store at the intersection of Third Ma Road and Stone Road announces that the store has been in business for over ten years, with a well-deserved reputation for authentic goods at fair prices. This year, due to the need to rebuild the store's premises, all goods are being sold at discounted prices. With the demolition date drawing near, and a large quantity of inventory remaining unsold, the store is further reducing prices by 70% to expedite clearance. This major price reduction, disregarding all costs, is a rare opportunity to purchase affordable silk and satin. It is hoped that all sectors will not miss out on this opportunity.</p>
<p>The Jinlong Vegetable Company at the corner of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road proclaims that the jade dew peaches produced by the Zhejiang Changxing Senshen Afforestation Farm, which are managed and sold by the company, have been met with extremely enthusiastic purchases and thriving sales since being transported to Shanghai from their place of origin and advertised in the newspapers. This has created an unprecedented sales record for fruit. This is because the peaches are large, juicy, and extremely sweet, surpassing all other types of flat peaches on the market.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Mingxing Film Company announces that since the release of its first sound film, "Songstress Red Peony," the results have been excellent and universally praised. Recently, director Zhang Shichuan has continued directing a second sound film, "Such Is Paradise," which has been in production for some time. Most of the filming is already complete, and the company is currently focusing on sound recording. The film is expected to be completed within the month. The film is even more spectacular than "Red Peony." When it is released on the silver screen, it will surely create a sensation.</p>
<p>The Hua Ju Film Company announces that its production, "Nine Deaths and One Life," directed by villainous star Sheng Xiaotian, has finally been completed after several months of exhaustive effort. The plot of the film is bizarre and shocking, full of unresolved mysteries. It is deeply embedded with detective elements and contains various aspects of tragedy, comedy, horror, and wonder. The film has now been completed and will be released soon. Manager Zhang Huimin believes that film art can be used to promote culture and assist education. In addition to careful research, he has specially hired theater and film artist Wan Laitian to create a film with a noble plot and profound meaning, tasked with promoting women's education and promoting national spirit. The lead role is played by Ding Yuming, a tragic star admired by millions, and is assisted by martial arts star Zhang Huimin and over a hundred female students from various schools, further enhancing the film's quality and appeal. The company is working diligently to complete the production, which is expected to be finished soon.</p>
