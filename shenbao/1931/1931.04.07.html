<h3 id="c22">印度運動中之印回兩教 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>凡一民族。欲抉破外來勢力之束縛。必須消除内部之分歧。蓋外來勢力。未有不因内部分歧而後得以運用其勢力也。故凡有侵略鄰國之野心者。其惟秘計。惟在挑換鄰國之種種内亂。一有機會可乘即盡其全力。爲之推波而助瀾視其本國之存亡。尤爲重要。即無機會可乘。亦必求其疑似之事。附會影射。散布種種謠諑以謀機會之來凡此舉動。我人於此近數年間。幾於無一端一節。不可據以作證。此無他不過欲削其民族者。不得不使此民族之内部。永久分歧爭鬥。而後外力乃侵入之耳。反之如欲抵抗外力。使不侵入。則唯一條件。亦爲内部不使分歧爭鬥耳。</p>
<p>此次印度民族欲脱英國束縛。不惜舉全印之力。以與英奮鬥。其結果未始不有若干之成功。然而至今印度教徒與回教徒。仍復互相交閧不已。致全印民族不能一致。是與對英運動。大有妨碍。非印度民族前途之福也。試觀今日全印回教大會之所言。可以窺其一二矣。</p>

<p>報載立法院第一三六次會議、通過鹽法七章計三十九條、愚深知鹽法關於國計民生者太鉅、不敢緘默自安、坐貽國家不可收拾之奇禍、故不願從理論上爲空疏之辨論、謹就事實上舉窒碍之窽竅、聊備　蕘、用供當道之採擇、倘能先事救濟、曉達我國鹽務行政鹽塲製造銷巿運儲之眞情、審愼將事、不致以圓枘之學理、授於方　之鹽務、庶行政院將來、不損尊嚴、國與民免陷危境也、此事爲中華民國治亂所關、非爲一二鹽商作掩護游説、區區愚忱、尤懇諸君子亮察、剖陳各條、序列如左、（一）鹽應就塲征税、聽人民自由買賣、此種主張、最力者近世有南通張季直所著有改革全國鹽法意見書、及衛國卹民、化梟弭盜、均宜變鹽法議、諸　、其對於採用劉晏就塲征税之法甚詳、其所期爲樂成者、有昔之商固商也、昔之梟亦商也等語、當其身居局外、淸緊握管時、未當不以爲俯仰古今、貫串始末、探𩧘得珠、�</p>
<p>法無善此、及其身任閣員、職掌鹽政、反未建議實行者何也、以近按事實、始知理想之非也、各種法典、更一時代、必有一步改進、就塲征税、劉晏已行之矣、法果善矣、則宜守而勿替、何李唐未終面王仙芝黃巢均以販私鹽聚衆爲亂、（見唐紀喜宗乾符二年、按劉晏行精密鹽法、始於代宗大歷十四年、至僖宗乾符二年、祇九十五年也、）傾覆唐世、易代之後、變更其法、行之一千二百餘年、（見張季直宜變鹽議）雖曰無百年不弊之法、此中因時損益、抉弊補救、自經無限過程、然未聞將根本法變更者、非屢代無理財邮民之人、見不及此、誠以中國鹽法、重在征税、且取重税制度、值百抽千、或抽二千者有之、如取不税制度、任何變更可也、否則國計所關、產銷運均𨽻定法、鹽民鹽商、各有其歷史與貲力、一經破壞、綜攬失網、國與民交受其害、是誠不可不愼者矣、今將此種新法實行、必演成困難之點、約揭其目略述之、</p>
<p>（甲）關於就塲征税之點　按現行鹽法、無論在塲在圩在坨之鹽、莫不先行徴税、而後發給准單運票、塲有負責之商、岸有負責之店、運有註册之船、起心地點、塡名單票、絲毫不能超越、越、稽查　核、綱目井然、機關不多、税法周密、若就塲征税、如新法第三章第十四條政府應於鹽塲適宜地點、建設倉坨、爲儲鹽之用、其注意以爲製鹽者所產之鹽、均必依照條文、存儲政府指定倉坨矣、於此先有所質問者、（一）製鹽區域、除川滇外、大都濱海、其鹽塲廣　、動數千方里、倉坨應有若干所、是否能於最短期間、可以完全設備、且水陸交通、頭頭是道、有何善法、盡塞走私之路、（二）　入倉埦、而後賣者税之、其未入倉埦者、如第六章第三十四條、所設之水陸塲警、是否能如塲商各管其灶、訪查私售之有關係、而精密淸白、（三）灘户灶户板户、均係窮民、有鹽即思得價、如照新法第四章第二十三條之規定、製鹽人之存鹽總數、應按其年產比例分攤、是製鹽人必須待至一年之後、方能得價而歸、否則即無從得其年產之比例、以家無宿糧之　民、豈能楊腹以待、且以五公噸爲標準、凡不滿五公噸者、皆得有優先售出之權、則賴惰產少者、皆有優先之權利、勤苦產多者、反居落後之地位、恐非増加生產之道、尤有奬勵惰民及怠之嫌、不但此也、每塲灘户灶户板户、動千百户、各户之鹽、分堆乎、抑聚堆乎、分堆能否有如許地方、聚堆將來賣時、如何按户區分、又如何别其爲一二等鹽、且灘户灶户板户、一經過秤交倉、如遇天災人禍、是否税員保險、售鹽日期、旣遲速不一、滷耗多寡、又如何辦法、爲鹽民設想、以鹽入倉坨、周轉麻煩、不得現欵濟窮、自不如坐而售私、簡便捷當、銀貨兩交、孰爲所願、</p>
<p>（乙）關於人民自由買賣之點　現行鹽法　人民固不自由、商人亦豈有絲毫自由、依現行之鹽法、塲商有出欵收儲之責、灶產有歸宿之商、食户有儲供之店、收價售價、悉由官定、故產雖旺、而製鹽者不覺其所產滯銷、產雖絀、而食户不　其所食特貴、雖窮鄕僻壤以及運道極艱之地、食户亦無淡食之處、若依新法、當然無商、人民二字、包括極廣、聽其自由、當發生疑問者、灘户灶户板户是否人民、是否可以自由買賣、在塲征税後、旣許自由買賣、是否即無區域之限制、一税之後、凡出塲之鹽、是否尚有取締再加取締、是否尚爲自由、且旣無一定之商、即無負責之人、又有何法、可以取締、自由買賣、是否仍以税票限定區域、限定時日、如其限定、即不成爲自由、如不限定、必至敝端百出、旣係自由買賣、獲利者固不待奬、而繼續營運、折耗者是否聽其歇業、甲地短鹽時、是否聽售者増價、乙地鹽多時、是否聽售者减價、交通便利之區、投機趕军者多、是否有雍塞折閲之患、運道艱難之地、運者裹足、食户是否有淡食之患、糧食斷尚可羅雀掘鼠、草根樹皮以充之、鹽斷尚有何物可代乎、劉晏之法、江嶺間去鹽　遠者、縛官鹽於彼貯之、或商絶鹽貴、則减價　之、謂爲常平、政府現在能否於各地遍設常平乎、</p>
<p>（丙）關於减税每百公斤一律征税五元之點　折合司碼秤百斤爲三元一角七分五釐有奇、查食鹽爲人民日用必需之品、當與米梁同一不税、昔人以國家不能無政費、而不能不税、又以人民担負宜普、而惟鹽之一物、究比食梁爲少、產地又比產梁爲狹、利其狹而能管理、普而不重困人民、故舍税糧而税鹽、亦不得已之法、今之鹽正税附税、重且極矣、能得减少、人孰不願但以國家度支情勢計、方行一裁釐之善政、中央與地方財政土之困難、與抵補之糾紛、天下方洶洶矣、試問再行驟减鹽税之後、并如新法第一章第六第七各條之規定、工業農業用鹽之種種免税、影射走漏、流弊百出、則中央年短數千萬元之收入、實爲意中之事、且各種附加、每年亦有一萬餘元之收入、合併此而全免之、食計當不下一萬數千萬元、何以支持、何法抵補、何人負責、此亦當國者不能忽視之事也、</p>
<p>（丁）關於食鹽不合標準不許售賣及施行變色變性之點　製鹽之宜改進、乃進化及衛生當然之事理、此於促進改良上、施以循序漸進之法、則可矣、若如新法第一章第四條之規定、食鹽以含有百分之九十以上氣化鈉者爲一等鹽、含有百分之八十五以上氣化鈉者爲二等鹽、一等食鹽所含水分不得超過百分之五、二等食鹽所含水分、不得超過百分之八、此項規定、未免有躐等之譏、夫以科學日進之日本、其鹽法規定、所含氣化鈉之成分尚分五等、最低者爲百分之七十以上、最髙者爲百分之九十以上、而科學落後之中國、其等級其成分、反欲凌駕日本而上之、理論未嘗不髙、其如事實窒碍難行何、再以衛生而論、不潔雜質、或有碍於衛生、至若水分、則與衛生何關、否則調摩作　、亦將爲水分之規定矣、且鹽含鎂質最易吸收水分、節氣固有不同、陰晴亦有不同、此爲自然化學之作用、非鹽民與商人之罪也、果其照此執行、則各省已製未製之鹽、多不合格、非盡作漁業工業農業用鹽不可、而漁業工業農業用鹽、又無此多量之需要、鹽民復待此以生、政府將如何處置、又如新法第三章第十八條、不合食鹽標準之鹽、應另行存儲、作漁業工業農業用鹽、或令原製人改製之規定、竊恐鹽民必先自承爲不合標準、不送倉坨、不待禁其不許售、而盡數售私矣、法不加衆、政府又如何處置、食鹽人非盡精於衛生者、但求其味鹹、但求其價廉耳、倘如新法第五章第二十九條鹽副產物、如苦滷滷塊滷　硝晶　巴鹺餅等、一律免税之規定、則任何一種副產物、皆可化以水分重製成鹽、即任何人皆可取巧、購此副產物、以替代食鹽、國家鹽税之前途、尚可聞問耶、歐美諸邦、或取無税制、或取輕税制、故變色變性、之後、乃用重淋改製之手續、其成本即不划算、流弊絶少、中國鹽税特重、即使變色變性之後、以免税之故、（每担三元有零仍此成本重）豈不能於運出之後、重淋改製耶、况新法第五章第二十七條、尚有不施變色變性之變通辦法、可便私圖、又豈區區保證或担保品、所可杜絶其流弊、</p>
<p>（戊）關於產少質劣成本過重得以相當方法裁併之點　消滅塲鹽、如不藉天然的而用人爲的、必無效果、例如淮南之劉莊塲以與海隔絶、廢除已有年矣、而產私也如故、至於海濱各塲、從前雖有五年遞滅、三年封閉之文告、究竟何嘗消滅、甚至已經廢灶之塲、私煎　起、產數反較未廢時爲多、是其明　、　鴻氣不斷、炊　將　、無人無地不具、即無人無地不可製鹽、即無人無地不可售私、消滅之乎、實祇便於私煎私販耳、</p>
<p>（己）關於政府得依產鹽狀况限定產額以免產鹽過剩之點　產鹽狀况、亦如農業、必賴天時、鹽產是否過剩、亦當視其銷路、如加限制、是否豐後即抑之使歉、歉後即勒令使豐、灘灶户板户、是否豐後即令其停業改業、歉後可隨意招徠、製鹽爲灘户灶户板户生業、且習知製鹽魯私之利、生命所關、能否馴服至此、且產東濱海鹽田、一望無際、設遇旺產、收棄之於地耶、抑投之於海耶、否則成本較廣、而又輪鐵均通運者、　集將見儘量而不見其剩、而兩淮兩浙之鹽、成本大而輸送遠、祗見過剩、是否有使天下之利、獨歸蘆東之計、是否可以坐視兩淮兩浙灘户灶户板户及依附爲生者數百萬人、盡皆失業、盡絶生計、而令地方治安、發生影響耶、</p>
<p>（庚）關於限制產額、獨不及精鹽公司、且再加精製者亦不受倉坨之限制、雖曰已經納税而收鹽放鹽、則不能無關係也、待遇不平等、顯見厚薄攸分、查精鹽發生、爲抵制洋鹽進口、祗准行銷通商口岸、苟其浸灌内地、亦以私論、舊法本極平允、而各公司以爲不便、到處喧聒、日日宣傳、廢除引岸、自由買賣、今立法院果持此主張矣、彼公司已有十餘家、製鹽担位、動輒數十萬担、如永裕一家、已有一百五十萬担之製額、若引譽廢除、各公司非盛大擴充、不接踵而起、祗須十餘家公司、即可將全國銷鹽二千五百萬担、悉數壟斷、藉日北方鹽本賤、可以以鹽製鹽、而南方鹽本貴、勢必以滷製鹽、則南方數百萬盛民之生計、勢必盡爲精鹽所攘奪、吾政府何厚於十餘家之精鹽公司、而薄於數百萬之鹽民、此眞大惑不解者也、</p>
<p>以上數則、不過略提大要、以供研究、如諸問題均有充分之應付與辦法、則採用革新手叚、毅然行之可也、如沿無充分之應付辦法、則寗審愼將事、蓋一發難收、誤國病民、爲害滋大、非若其他發號施令之易於挽回補救也、</p>

<p>— 看雲樓主</p>
<p>樊山先生之喪。識與不識。同深震悼。余與先生。未謀一面。而詩札時有往還。先生謂余詩淸逸。無近人不可解語。輒於詩友前稱道。聞之慚感。余嘗欲執　先生之門。介貴陽尚書陳庸庵先生示意。先生以其女弟子李桂芬。從余問字。謙遜不承。來函婉謝。然余偶有所詢。先生輒爲詳示。固不帶師生也。</p>
<p>先生聽歌豪興。老猶不衰。平津女伶。拜門下。先生知余亦嗜聽戲。故於李桂芬慧琴雪艶琴等南來。皆修函介紹。屬爲鼓吹。惟去冬新艶秋李慧琴來滬。臥榻書難。僅傳語報平安而已。艶秋北歸。曽邀余同往。余以滬事増積。未能抽身。期以今春再𢤗厥願。早知如此。則歲暮隨艶秋北去。尚得與先生一面。而今已矣。豈不痛哉。</p>
<p>去歲海上小報。曽誤載先生死耗。時雪艶琴到滬未久。先生尚有函來。爲渠先容。故余閲報。疑信參半。嗣函詢北平詩人曹繼蘅。始知非確。先生謂此種奇謠。生平已遭二次。去歲乃第三次也。楊雲史君。有挽詩樊宅。先生頗爲感激。余得　蘅書。喜先生無羞恙。亦有詩云。老人星隕報端披。消息傳來半信疑。纔見髙吟多盡興。若云生挽未徴詩。海雲喜得平安字。天地長留絶妙辭。薊北江南數千里。寸心遙寄月明時。</p>
<p>桂芬語余。先生貌淸　望之如六十人。喜聞鼻烟。　上恒染烟色。手指亦不甚潔凈。文人不事修飾。大抵然也。先生臥室。書籍縱横。不可爬梳。然先生記憶力强。檢書俯拾即是。故此種亂書堆。不許家人爲之整理。緣整理後。檢書即感即不便也。</p>
<p>先生逝世後。後生小子。對於其詩。妄加月旦。無論毀譽。均不足重。總之先生詩詞。自成一家。媲美前賢。其與左笏卿論詩一首。可以知其作詩之取徑。非淺學所能夢見也。詩云。君不見蘭子七劍兩手</p>
<p>中。中有五劍常在空。巧手能虚以運實。開　渾沌皆玲瓏。又不見單父種花驪花宮。萬花顏色無一同。匠心能以素爲絢。坐使枯寂回春風。兵家在以少克衆。權家在以輕起重。道家在以靜制動。詩家在以獨勝共。能言人所不能言。如山出靈無不宣。能圓人所不能圓。如月三五懸中天。百汲不竭井底泉。任燒不絶香上烟。百花釀作酒一瓶百藥練成丹一丸。五味入口取其甘五色入目取其鮮。五聲入耳取其和。惟貌不獨取其妍。取之杜蘇根底堅。取之白陸户庭寛。取之溫李藻思繁。取之黃陳奥窔穿。言之有物餅中　。裁之成幅機中練。視之無跡水中鹽。出之則飛匣中劍。無意何能作一經。無筆何以役萬靈。無才何以籠羣英。無學何能躋老成。無法何所謂尺繩。無事何足爲重輕。一字不安衆所議。八面受敵誰不能。老笏雜言昨挑戰。意亦葶韓通其變。六十餘年窮生活。爲君一騁雕龍辯。詩林　　百尺竿。老年進步如少年。學我者死殊不然。果如我語詩其僊。</p>

<p>怪胎難產　時有所聞。產生之家　輒以爲不祥。死固湮没。生亦置死。致罕供生理之研究。比鄰殷姓之次女于歸松江倉橋康三官爲室。康操獎業十年來未夢熊蛇。乏嗣爲慮。茲幸身懷六甲。於三月九日。忽覺腹痛異常。屈指妊期。已越兩月。急倩穏婆至。預備一切。延時一日夜。始告臨盆。產時嬰臀先下。俗謂（坐馬生者）是也。此類難產。殊危險。逾一時許、嘐嘐墮地矣。視之。一麟也。喜甚。該兒頭大若童。雙手過膝甚長。背有一窪。若孟。初以異相。益喜。及洗沐全身畢。掀開唇皮。見生門牙二。撫摩之。嘐嘐如鳥鳴。不能啼哭。三官迺詫異不置。妻恚甚。疑係怪物。擲諸地。面部徐徐發靑。康母年邁含飴心切。憐不忍棄。急携諸臥榻。而面色又轉靑爲赭。方欲窺其究竟。詎未及兩小時。而全口牙齒遍生。康妻益驚惶惟恐棄之不遑。一若大禍之將臨於是全家譁然。粼里無知之翁嫗。復推波助瀾。僉謂妖怪。康母亦失其主張。結果。則棄之倉橋河聞產婦現在病亦垂危云。</p>

<p>研究書法。全賴摹寫。邇來紙張騰貴。購紙學書。殊不經濟。且紙質軟薄者。一經墨瀋渲染。易於破裂。難作别用。若隨手抛棄。又悖敬惜之義。今有一法。以救其弊。則用報紙摹寫是也。余曩在平阿執教鞭時。曽定購滬報數種。以備瀏覽。每當臨池。輒以報紙試用。因報紙之紙質較厚。墨瀋不易透過背面。可以反覆摹寫。寫罷。曝以日。成置乾地。俟墨瀋旣燥。然後摺疊出售。較之巿價。仍不短少。間以試諸生徒。亦著成效。世有同癖者。盍嘗試之。</p>
<p>近日德國式之福柏士打汽罏。幾爲家居旅行者必備之物品。惟其打汽針上之橡皮。每因久燃　熱之結果。橡皮爲熱所烤。輒致乾縮。而打汽即失其功效。用者苦之。經售處。雖可更換。每索代價四五角。且不耐久。頃得一法。試之有效。法以舊破之皮鞋底。（橡皮質及膠皮質者不適用）以利刃割斷使薄。照樣　一圓塊。中刻裂紋。就針之前端。力撩使下。然後將螺釘杻緊。再將皮向前攤倒。用手緊　投入筒内。抽抵數次。即就範矣。此法旣不須代價。且能歷久不壞。一經試騐。當烽吾言之不謬也。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>動物虎豹犀象均產。而錫蘭產象特多。印度到處多盡一種蛇。其風蓋拜象獅與蛇蟒也。白白馬頗見之。憶昔漢明帝時。佛經初到中國。以白馬駄經至東都。故洛陽有白馬寺。不知此寺今尚存否。可知印度之有白馬。自古然矣。我來印度。旣見大白牛車。又見白馬。因思西游記一書。雖云荒誕。亦似有因。其叙唐僧西天取經。有豬八戒白龍馬沙和尚孫猴子。今以事實證之。白馬駄經。今印度尚有白馬。是事實也。猪八戒者到印度。經過回教國。回戒食豬。故云也。沙和尚者。沙彌。即小和尚之稱也。孫猴乃猴猻之名。今印度街上玩猴者不少。可見著西游記者。并非全杜撰。未可輕視。又云中魔王。亦有近理。三千佛名經有牛王佛之號。乃佛所説。印人拜牛。常飾以錦繡。牛大角。亦殊美觀。又其牛如　駝。項下峯髙突起。異乎中國。稱魔王。亦非無因。至述女兒國。更是事實。爪哇等處。元朝尚是女國。靑海西藏。緬甸今尚右女。特小説當然粉飾其詞耳。又其稱過火燄、則今各地火山甚多。由此證之。古人之書。未可一概視爲荒誕。應有相當根據。乃加附會。以成有趣味之文耳。</p>
<p>印度之鷄貓狗。平常未見有異。惟念幼時常聽母親説。唐僧西天取經。抱貓來中國以開之道階師。師云。中國不見得唐以前無貓。但唐人詩似尚未見有貓字。而古詩經云。有貓有虎。解者指虎類大獸。非小貓也。然則或者貓來自西方之諺。亦非盡無稽與。</p>
<p>偶於中國街頭見一毛驢。不知是中國人帶來乎。抑印度自有之乎。待訪問也。</p>
<p>印人戒殺生鼠不少。加城飛鷹滿天却不見其關仗。余常信孔子人而不如鳥乎之訓。蓋以各方面考查。鳥類道德。恒髙於獸類。而人爲哺乳類。其遜於鳥也。蓋亦有由耳。見賣鸚鵡者問之。一小鸚要十五元。又一要二百元。蓋　此地生活髙故耳。</p>
<p>頃問之印友。則云毛驢印度甚多。不奇也。余得此而證。一證明印度熱帶尚可自在畜驢。二證者前記余讀斯賓塞日記。自言在埃及騎驢之事。昔耶蘇在猶大常騎驢然則驢種自印度以重埃及。均可生存。何以兩廣黔中人對我言。驢蹄薄不耐熱而不可畜乎。其殆以至人傳播驢種故耳。一小事欲證明頗不易。中山先生知難行易之説。所以有價值也。吾甚盼南邊人民速多畜驢以増加生產。則可輕人民肩上負担矣。</p>

<p>— 郭睿</p>
<p>是在一星期以前吧、曁南同學閧傳着春假快臨、同時默念着假期間應怎樣地遣興消磨、不過有的想、「短足旅行是就近順便些、還有的想、「遠足旅行是登山涉水、可以開開眼界」因此各同學决定旅行的目的地也各不同了、自然走杭州蘇州、南京、南翔的都有、</p>
<p>不過還有些同學認爲乘輪船搭火車的旅行、實是單調乏味、失却遊覽的眞意、同時感到靑年的自身、應具有勇敢生動的精神和「行健自强」的努力、於是他們就組織個自由旅行團、旅行的路綫、是由上海經蘇州、無錫、鎭江、而至南京、再由南京轉杭州、寗波、鎭海、普陀山、回原到上海、路程是足有一千五百里、日程也須要兩個禮拜的樣子、</p>
<p>但是他們的旅行團還可稱之爲十人團、因爲這個旅行團是僅由十個架自由車的老手組成的、並没有什麽隨從的人、所以他們的衣食住行完全是要自己處理並且這次學校所津貼他們的數目也是不多的、所以他們一千五百里的旅行、雖不若從前童子的步行南洋、東北的壯盛和偉大、而他們那種英武活潑的精神的表現、都可以並稱之而無愧了、</p>

<p>可憐的她、終日雙眉緊鎖着、好像是有許多的心事、終是睡在那黑暗的小間裏、她有時不知想着了什麽、就握着筆寫字、在她寫到一半就不寫了、從頭一讀就嗖嗖的撕破也、抛在那字紙簍内去了、有時别人把她的破字紙拼起來看看、總不是怨命、便不嘆苦、　　　　她的母親是一個家庭中的暴主、終日裏睡在床上、從早上起幾乎要駡到睡、在她的耳朶中聽了這種可惡的聲音、正是心如刀割一般、萬丈愁緖、一縷縷望她芳心上飄蕩、一陣陣的熱涙不住地下來、她的情人是經濟上的弱者、雖然是憐香惜玉地的百般體會她、總不能使她虚榮的母親而滿心、旣不能使她長者之歡心、自然不能達到她自由的愛情和婚姻了、可憐的她、在她母親方面又不能違逆、在她的愛人方面、双有許多的不捨、那末這樣的境像很能使她抱着消極了、她很想能夠自立、但是一没有介紹人、二没有相當的本領去投考、久是悶悶的住在黑暗的家庭中、更無出首的日子、可憐她過這種的日子、每天不知要出多少的血涙、有時她母親還説他没有出息的坐吃家中、其實這種的女子最痛苦也没有了、她旣没有能力去自立、又没有能力去講文明自由、她弱小的魂靈、竟如受着狂風吹蕩一樣、要看看書又没有心、嘆嘆苦又没有知心的人、所謂的情體的愛人、又不能與她暢快的促膝談心、又不能出去看電影、她相當的消遣品、差不多没有一樣可以消滅的她心事、她的母親又不有一句的體惜她的言語、只是作無意的駡言、旁邊還有無知識小人冷笑她們、還要在她母親面前捏造她的壞處、更使她要生出悲哀了、</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The truth about the difficulties posed by various countries regarding extraterritoriality is not about extraterritoriality itself, but about issues related to the stationing of troops and the berthing of warships connected to extraterritoriality. If extraterritoriality is abandoned, lawsuits involving foreigners will be handled by China. Various countries believe that this is not of great importance and can trust the judgments of Chinese courts. However, the purpose of stationing troops and berthing warships was originally to protect foreigners. Due to the abandonment of extraterritoriality, there would be no reason to station troops and berth warships, and they would have to be completely withdrawn, which is what the powers are unwilling to relinquish.

<p>All Countries Are Preparing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of embassies of various countries moving south, I recently met with a consul-general who stated that all countries are preparing. They do not object to the National Government's requirement that the embassy districts of various countries should not be contiguous. However, the limit of 20 mu per embassy is considered insufficient. Each embassy has at least 30 to fewer than 100 staff members, not including employees and servants. At least 30 pairs of married quarters must be built, and each country does not have the habit of living in a single courtyard, plus garages, stables, etc., which cannot be accommodated within 20 mu. The issue of land purchase is quite hesitant. Recently, France managed to rent a house from He Yaocu in Gaoloumen for 800 yuan as a representative office, but the French are still looking for land.

<p>A nation that wants to break free from the shackles of external forces must eliminate internal divisions. External forces can only exert their influence after internal divisions exist. Therefore, those who harbor ambitions to invade neighboring countries will employ secret strategies focused on provoking various internal disturbances in those countries. If an opportunity arises, they will exert their full efforts to fuel the chaos, considering it more important than their own country's survival. Even if no opportunity arises, they will seek out suspicious events, twist facts, and spread rumors to create an opportunity. Over the past few years, we have seen countless instances of this. This is simply because those who want to weaken a nation must keep it permanently divided and fighting, so that external forces can then invade. Conversely, if we want to resist external forces and prevent invasion, the only condition is to ensure that there is no internal division or strife.</p>
<p>The Indian nation is currently seeking to break free from British shackles and is willing to use the full power of India to fight against Britain. The results may yet prove somewhat successful. However, even now, Hindu and Muslim believers continue to clash with each other, preventing the Indian nation from achieving unity. This greatly hinders the anti-British movement and bodes ill for India's future. A glimpse into this state of affairs may be gleaned from the statements made today by the All-India Muslim League.</p>

<p>(Suzhou) A fire broke out on the riverbank of Jiegantang outside Xumen at 11:30 AM, destroying over 100 flat-roofed houses and straw huts, and burning to death eight people, including men, women, and children. When the fire was raging, it happened that the Suzhou firefighting members from various districts were at Qiushan, commemorating the death of member Shi Jinkui, who died from electric shock last year, so no one arrived to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The names of the deceased are as follows: Chen Zhenhe and his young son, Zhang Er'a, Zhang (80 years old), Zhang Erqi, Qiaoyuan (7 years old), Guo Suzhen (7 years old), Guo Hongzi, and Wu Chuanyi, a total of eight people.

<p>Two Years of Exploration, 15,000 Miles</p>
<p>Through Persia, Afghanistan, into Xinjiang</p>
<p>The Expedition's Seven Objectives</p>
<p>National News Agency, Beirut (Syria), 5th - French Government</p>
<p>Seven departments, in conjunction with the French Geographical Society, the Natural History Museum, the Academy of Archaeology, and other academic organizations, launched the Asian Expedition, sponsored by the American National Geographic Society and the Chinese Geographical Society, led by Haardt. They departed from here on Saturday, with seven mountain trucks and six light cars, and will pass through Syria, Iraq, Persia, Afghanistan, and the Pamirs into Xinjiang, China. They are scheduled to meet the Polley team, which departed from Beiping on Wednesday, in Kashgar at the end of June. Then they will travel through Sichuan and Tibet into Annam to Saigon, and then take the route through Siam, Burma, India, Persia, and Arabia to return. They plan to spend two years exploring 15,000 miles of Central Asia. Its purpose has seven points: (1) Geography, planning to produce sound films and detail the situation in Syria, Iraq, Persia, Afghanistan, the Pamirs, and Annam, with particular emphasis on the possibility of connecting various places by air routes. (2) Archeology, examining the historical sites along the way, especially the ancient temples in Chinese Turkestan, which may prove that primitive races originated in Central Asia or the Gobi Desert. (3) Ethnology, examining the customs and characteristics of various ethnic groups along the way and producing sound films. (4) Natural History Museum, collecting specimens of plants and animals from various places and transporting them back to Paris. (5) Radio, a special radio vehicle will be used to test shortwave long-distance communication methods. The only American in the team, Williams, a special visitor from the American National Geographic Society, will use this vehicle to transmit telegrams to the United States daily. (6) Art, examining Persian and Chinese art in detail. (7) Commerce, examining commercial possibilities, trade routes, and markets for sales. The American National Geographic Society alone provided a budget of US$50,000 this time. This is the first time the society has funded a foreign expedition. The team has been preparing for more than two years, and the twelve vehicles used were custom-made from the Citroen factory and donated by the factory. In the past six months, 200 camels have been used to transport food and other supplies to storage locations along the way to meet the needs of the team as they pass through.</p>

<p>The Little Entente Meeting Will Discuss It</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 5th - According to the venue of the Entente Conference, it will be moved from Hörgulesban to the Romanian capital and will open in mid-month. The most important point on the agenda is the attitude that the countries of the Little Entente should take towards the new German-Austrian customs union. Czechoslovakia is the country that most strongly opposes German-Austrian cooperation, but the future of the conference is difficult to predict and depends on the attitude of other countries. The position of France is of great importance.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 5th - Berlin newspapers have rarely published articles related to the political situation on Easter Sundays in the past, but this year is different. On this day, the newspapers still paid great attention to the German-Austrian customs union, and the most important articles published included the speeches of Austrian Foreign Minister Schober, British Churchill, and Hungarian Prime Minister Bethlen. The German Times published Schober's speech, saying that the Geneva Treaty clearly stated that if we can find a way to remedy the current financial situation and rebuild economic vitality, all countries must provide assistance. Now that the opportunity to remedy the financial situation and restore economic capacity has just been found, it neither violates the existing agreements nor is it in line with the ideals of the Pan-European League plan. In the future, those who will benefit from it will not only be Germany and Austria, but may spread throughout Europe, but the countries do not see this and want to stab us in the back. Is this what is called providing assistance? The Berlin Forum also published Churchill's speech. Churchill said that the news of the conclusion of the German-Austrian customs union was able to cause such a great storm in European diplomatic circles, which is truly incomprehensible. We are already deeply disturbed by the obstacles that customs duties pose to the development of commerce, but when the first obstacle is broken, countries are calling out loudly to curse it, so that the imaginary benefits cannot be realized. However, the German-Austrian customs union will eventually become a reality, and European countries will benefit from it. The newspaper also published a conversation with Hungarian Prime Minister Bethlen. He said that Europe has now reached a period of economic construction, and the meetings in Paris, Warsaw, Geneva, Rome and other places are its pioneers, and the recent conclusion of the German-Austrian customs union also occupies an extremely important position. Hungary is now trying to adopt the same policy and will be able to start preparations before the end of this year in order to achieve the goal of improving the economic situation.</p>

They believe that President Hamaguchi will not easily recover and needs to rest quietly. They should establish a successor president to revitalize the Minseito Party and exchanged various opinions. This opinion was originally proposed by Masanao Nakano. They plan to nominate Kenzo Adachi as the successor president. This kind of meeting of the young faction caused a considerable commotion within the party.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - Although the condition of Prime Minister Hamaguchi after the operation is still good, it is impossible to be sure whether he can recover his health without waiting a week. Therefore, all parties in the political world are paying close attention. At this time, there are two views within the government and the party. Some cabinet members and members of the party, from a purely rational standpoint, believe that Prime Minister Hamaguchi has been in bed for a long time since being attacked last November and cannot perform government and party affairs. Now that he has been hospitalized again, even if the condition is good after the operation, it is still impossible to be discharged from the hospital. At least he needs to rest for two or three months. If he further alienates government affairs at this time, then from the standpoint of responsible politics, what a prime minister should be careful about is to make a decisive resignation and elect a successor president in order to complete the follow-up measures after the lifting of the gold embargo. There is no doubt that the follow-up measures after the lifting of the gold embargo require the Minseito Party to absolutely continue the austerity policy. Moreover, it is impossible to hand over the government to the Seiyukai, which has no real power in the parliament. Therefore, it can be determined that there is no such thing as the Seiyukai. Therefore, electing a successor president to revitalize the Minseito Party cabinet to continue to hold power. The other faction is pure Hamaguchi-centrism, saying that the follow-up measures after the lifting of the gold embargo are the necessary austerity policies, which are currently in progress. If they are changed or stopped halfway, then efforts to restore the financial economy will inevitably return to nothing. Moreover, Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition is quite good after the operation, and he is currently performing government affairs from the bed, so there is no need for a total resignation. The arguments of both factions are centered on the prime minister's health.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - The Seiyukai believes that although Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition is good after the operation, he can no longer be the national leader. It is expected that he will resign completely. If he resigns completely, the Minseito Party will definitely seek to continue the next government. However, no matter who other than Hamaguchi takes office as president, it will be difficult for the Minseito Party to end it satisfactorily. Moreover, the flaws in the current cabinet's policies have been completely exposed before and after the parliament. Therefore, there is no doubt that the next government will fall into the hands of our party, the only opposition party. This is the Seiyukai's observation of the political situation, and some people have already started activities secretly. It is also expected that the time of the political change will be no more than a few days after the prime minister leaves the hospital.</p>

<p>Differing Opinions Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - According to a dispatch from Paris, the governments of Germany and Italy have differing opinions when drafting the naval agreement. It is reported that the French government wants to continue building cruisers and destroyers between the 1933 and 1936 disarmament conferences to supplement the decommissioned ships and maintain its superiority over the Italian navy. The Italian government believes that there should be no replenishment during this period, so that the 1936 disarmament conference will not be restrained.</p>

<p>US President Has No Intention of Convening</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 5th - After Congressman Arens claimed that President Hoover could convene an international conference to maintain the price of silver, the White House denied that the US President had any intention of convening such a conference. Officials believe that the United States is not paying attention to the silver issue except for paying attention to the relationship between silver and world trade.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th - The Maffei Company, a banker, said that the low price of silver is not one of the important reasons for the sluggish world trade. Rising silver prices may cause more hardship to China than the low price of silver.</p>

<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 5th - Today's All-India Muslim Conference was chaired by Ishaqat Ali. It is said that the British are willing to immediately accept eight-tenths of India's demands. He hopes that Hindus can now accept the demands of Muslims. The states of India and the Hindu and Muslim people should unite and put forward unified demands to the British. Mrs. Mohammad Ali, the female chairman of the reception committee, gave a speech, asking Muslim women to remove their veils and participate in public affairs. The Indian governor then invited the important Muslim leaders who were in New Delhi to an informal meeting, which lasted for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 5th - The All-India Muslim Conference issued a notice regarding the killing of Muslims by Hindus in various parts of India, deploring the barbaric invasion of the Hindus and saying that if such invasions continue, they will inevitably lead to civil strife. It also warned the British government and the Indian government that if they continue to procrastinate and fail to seriously deal with the current situation, India will completely decline. Those who supported this case all spoke very passionately, while Ishaqat Ali did not approve of the spirit of revenge, saying that if Muslims were forced to fight, they must not harm women, children, the elderly, or the weak, or invade the temples of the people. The meeting also passed a motion demanding separate elections and one-third of the seats in the National Assembly. The proposer said that the Indian representatives who participated in the Round Table Conference intended to join the Federation in order to defeat the Muslim India. The only guarantee of investigation and return of Muslims is in a number of provinces where Muslims can live and work in peace. If the future is governed by the Hindu central government, the Muslims cannot bear it. It is said that if the Hindus fight against the British and gain power, then the Muslims will fight against the Hindus.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 5th—The Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Alexander, stated today that economic advisors would advise the government that wages must be reduced, or taxes must be levied on the goods consumed by workers. Mr. Citrine, the Secretary-General of the Trade Union Congress, who is one of the attendees of the economic advisory committee, immediately denied that the committee had made such a recommendation, and said that the Labour Party members would never advocate wage cuts. The Secretary of the Navy then issued a clarification, saying that he did not mean that the economic committee had made such a report, but most economists and industrialists believe that costs are too high, and the standard of living must be lowered by reducing wages or levying taxes.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Memorial Week at the Central Party Headquarters and National Government <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on the 6th, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week for the late leader Sun Yat-sen. Central Committee members Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Kong Xiangxi, Liu Luyin, Ma Chaojun, Zhang Daofan, Chen Bulei, Yu Jingtang, and other staff and guests, totaling more than 800 people, attended. Zhu Jiahua presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Mr. Zhu reported on his impressions after inspecting party affairs in Nanjing, Shanghai, and various areas in Jiangsu Province, stating that while the impressions gained this time were very good, there were also many areas that needed improvement: (1) The organization and content of district branches are relatively empty and scattered. Apart from routinely convening meetings, district branches often lack content.</p>
<p>Some district branches even lack this routine work. (2) Party members are unable to generate interest in party gatherings. Therefore, at party member congresses, discussion meetings, and lecture meetings routinely convened by district party headquarters and district branches, comrades only attend out of discipline, harboring the hardship of having to come, and thus feel impatient with the meetings and seek a quick end. (3) The situations of people's organizations in various places are either biased or apathetic. The party's involvement in the mass movement seems to be only superficial participation without actual in-depth involvement. They deeply feel the inability to attract attention through propaganda methods. Therefore, we believe that mass movements and propaganda methods should start with literacy campaigns. (4) Party members' wills cannot be unified, so the party's unity is unstable. In the future, if the party wants to seek permanent peace and unity for the country, it must first achieve the unification of the wills of all comrades. The meeting then concluded with the ceremony.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held a memorial week for the late leader Sun Yat-sen. Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, Li Yuying, Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Ru Yuli, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaozu, and other staff and guests, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Wang Chonghui presided over the meeting. After leading the ceremony, Yu Youren gave a speech on the National Government's financial policies, stating that the National Government has resolutely abolished likin and various taxes similar to likin, as they are extremely harmful to the people. It has now also issued an order to cancel the special consumption tax that was about to be implemented. In the future, the National Government's financial problems will be addressed through the four words "increase revenue and reduce expenditure." Whether increasing revenue or reducing expenditure, the principle is to consider the interests of both the people and the country. What we want to build is a Three Principles of the People nation. Our financial policies cannot be the same as those of other capitalist countries. We must use the Principle of People's Livelihood as the highest principle of financial policy. On the active side, we want to turn the government into a productive government and build a progressive national economy. The completion of this work depends entirely on the application of finance. If we continue to rely on borrowing or taxation to maintain national finances, it would be contrary to the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. The purpose of the recent order to cancel the special consumption tax lies in this, because it can not only remove the capital for warlords to carve out territories but also reduce the opportunities for corrupt officials to engage in fraud. In short, the government's action to cancel the special tax this time has a theoretical basis and profound significance. It is hoped that everyone will understand it clearly, and especially hope that all provinces will implement it earnestly. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The National Government and Northeast are Preparing to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Panchen Lama Erdeni left Wuzhumuqin Banner in mid-March and is heading south. The Northeast Frontier Defense Commander's Office was notified by telegram, and the Frontier Defense Command immediately sent Li Shaobai, the director of the Panchen Lama Reception Office, along with staff and vehicles, to meet him north of Tongliao. More than ten days have passed, and there is still no confirmed news of his arrival in Tongliao. This trip of the Panchen Lama is very important regarding Tibetan affairs, so the National Government and the Northeast authorities have shown great respect. The Northeast Frontier Defense Command has now allocated 2,000 yuan for reception expenses to prepare for all welcome and reception arrangements. In addition to sending Weischa Nosang from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to Shenyang to welcome him, the National Government has also specially appointed Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng as a welcome representative. Ma Fuxiang, the chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, has also telegraphed Bai Jianmin, a member stationed in Shenyang, to represent the commission and provide welcome and reception nearby. However, Central Representative Wu Tiecheng has already departed from Shenyang on the first of this month to inspect party affairs in various provinces and cities in the Northeast, heading to Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Harbin provinces. He plans to rush back to Shenyang when there is a confirmed date for the Panchen Lama's arrival in Shenyang to represent the National Government in the welcome. Also, fearing that the Panchen Lama's itinerary will be rushed and he will arrive during his inspection period, he has sent Secretary Zhang Zhenxi to stay in Shenyang. If he is unable to rush back in time, Zhang Zhenxi will represent him in the welcome. (April 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Dismissals and Anti-Communism on the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Main Factory Laid Off Another 300+ Employees</p>
<p>Railway Police Establish Six Anti-Communist Measures</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Recently, the income of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been decreasing daily, averaging less than 120,000 rubles per day, while expenditures require 6 million rubles per month. The gap between income and expenditure is extremely large. The Railway Bureau has no good plan other than layoffs and administrative reductions. Therefore, it announced today the layoff of 320 workers from the 36-shed railway main factory, including 60 Russian workers and 260 Chinese workers. Before the layoffs, the board of directors had debated the number for many days, and finally decided on this number, as there was nothing else to do. In addition to layoffs, the Railway Bureau also stipulated that the main factory will implement a work suspension system in the future. When work decreases, workers will not be paid, which is practically the same as a shutdown. In addition, the Ha-Man-Zui-Sui sections of the Railway Bureau's Transportation Department have also been merged, with Harbin as the central station, reducing the number of freight trains. Scattered goods will be transported along with passenger trains. Staff living in official housing must pay rent as usual, which will be deducted from their salaries. Salaries will be issued starting on the 10th of the following month. In addition, there are many other measures that are currently under review by the board of directors' budget committee. Last year, there were 24,427 employees on the Chinese Eastern Railway, including 10,584 regular employees, 3,196 temporary employees, and 10,647 daily-wage employees. After repeated layoffs, there are now 10,291 regular employees, 2,079 temporary employees, and 6,737 daily-wage employees.</p>
<p>Today, more than a thousand laid-off employees gathered at the board of directors, demanding to meet with the Russian Deputy Director Yemushanov. He did not meet with them. Afterwards, the workers went to the Railway Bureau, demanding that the Russian Director Rudyi meet with them. He also refused. After much negotiation, there was no result. Finally, they left a petition, which requested four points: (1) The Chinese Eastern Railway should, to the extent possible, pay all laid-off employees' severance pay and preferential benefits in one lump sum. (2) If the above cannot be done, the Railway Bureau must ensure that it pays at least a certain amount each month. (3) The severance pay office must issue a notice immediately. (4) Before the Chinese Eastern Railway can pay all the money, laid-off employees should temporarily enjoy the treatment of official housing and medical care.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been communist activity along the Chinese Eastern Railway. A few days ago, the police found a letter from the Communist Party branch at Hailin Station to the Liaoning Arsenal's Party branch, stating that they would remit funds immediately to supply guns and ammunition, and agreeing on a date for an uprising. The letter was written in code, and it took many people to translate it to find out the truth. In addition to informing the Railway Army Headquarters to take strict precautions, the Special District Commissioner's Office also ordered the Railway Police to be more vigilant. The Railway Police Department has now established six anti-communist measures, and ordered all sections and teams along the line to pay attention. The measures are as follows: (1) Officials and police chiefs should strictly prohibit communist agitation in their places of residence. (2) If officials and police chiefs find leaflets promoting red propaganda, or letters that appear to incite communism, they should immediately report them to their superiors for verification. (3) If the correspondence of officials and police chiefs involves suspected communist propaganda, the responsible official should be responsible for checking it and report the facts. (4) Officials and police chiefs should pay attention to guests who are received at all times. No section or team is allowed to accommodate outsiders for lodging. (5) When officials and police chiefs apply for leave, regardless of the length of time, the responsible official should pay attention at all times, and carefully review the facts of the leave, and silently investigate whether the applicant is fabricating a reason to apply for leave or interfering in external affairs. Leave should not be approved unless there is a legitimate reason. (6) Officials and police chiefs have an obligation to report facts of communist agitation, and to arrest those who distribute it. Those who know the situation and do not report it, or report it untruthfully, will be submitted for review and punishment. (April 1st)</p>

<p>To Request Instructions on Military Expenses and Military Governance Guidelines</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Shanxi army generals Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Feng Pengzhu,</p>
<p>Li Fuying, Yang Yaofang, Li Shengda, etc., held an impromptu meeting at 8:30 PM on the first day at Sun Chu's private residence in Linquanfu. During the meeting, they had a long discussion about the date of going to Shenyang and the issue of military expenses. The generals all felt that their troops had a large backlog of unpaid salaries, and there was no formal arrangement for future military expenses. There were great difficulties in the livelihood of officers and soldiers, and they should actively seek considerable remedies and follow-up measures. If the military expenses were resolved, it would be easier to start the follow-up work in Shanxi. It was decided to send a representative from each army to Shenyang to meet with Zhang, to report on the progress of demobilization and inspection, and to ask Deputy Commander Zhang for instructions on military expenses and future military governance guidelines. The representative of the Fourth Army has been decided to be Feng Pengzhu, the Fifth Army to be Li Fuying, the Sixth Army to be Yang Yaofang, the Seventh Army to be Chuan Zuoyi, the Railway Protection Army to be Sun Chu, and the Artillery Department to be Zhou Dai. As soon as each troop is slightly reorganized, they will go together. As for the departure date, there is a saying that it will be on the 5th of this month. (April 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Guangdong Provincial Government Adds Inspectors <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Original Inspectors of the Department of Civil Affairs are Abolished</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Department of Civil Affairs of Guangdong Province previously had the position of inspectors, dividing the province's counties into several districts, with one inspector in each district, who would go out to inspect the county administration of the districts at any time. However, the inspector system was good in itself, but the problem of people failed to fully satisfy people's expectations. Therefore, at the Fourth Provincial Congress of Representatives in January of this year, many county party representatives proposed to abolish the inspector system. After accepting the opinions of the presidium, the next provincial executive committee was requested to consult the provincial government to improve the system. Until the 153rd meeting of the provincial government on the 20th of last month, it was decided to abolish the inspectors of the Department of Civil Affairs and add inspectors of the provincial government, and the regulations were passed, which will be implemented from the 1st of this month. The inspectors are directly appointed by the provincial government and do not have offices. In addition to being ordered to investigate and report special cases, the inspectors should pay attention to investigating and reporting the economic organization and expenditure of funds in the counties and cities in the inspection area, local security, the situation of municipal administration and police teams, anti-bandit work, the examination and movement of organ officials, the morality and work spirit of county and city chiefs, public opinion's criticism of superiors, the degree of contact between the party and the people, local construction matters, local production types, the situation of agriculture, industry, commerce, fishing, mining, etc., the types and facilities of charitable undertakings, the local advantages and disadvantages of counties and cities, the sufferings of the people, and bad customs, the situation of municipal administration, the income and expenditure of local funds and the source of use, and whether county and city government officials violate meritorious orders. If inspectors encounter administrative sanctions in counties and cities, they may send a letter to the county and city chiefs to reply within a set time, and submit the details of the event to the provincial government for verification. When inspecting, inspectors should quickly find out the facts when they encounter major events in their inspection area, and attach opinions to the county and city chiefs' handling methods of the event, and submit them to the provincial government for review. Inspectors may request the assistance of county and city chiefs and consult various documents and books within the scope of their duties at any time, but inspectors should not notify the county and city chiefs in advance when they go to inspect various places, and should not accept any form of reward, supply, or welcome. If inspectors support county and city chiefs in deliberately concealing or making false reports, failing to comply with meritorious orders, abandoning their duties, or agitating for personal gain, they will be punished separately once they are found to be true.

<h3 id="e78">Guangdong Porcelain Merchants Appeal for Tax Exemption <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Forcefully State the Pain of Heavy Multiple Taxation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the abolition of likin in Guangdong, it was originally hoped that various local goods could be reduced or exempted from taxes, but unexpectedly, porcelain is subject to heavy multiple taxation. Compared to before the abolition of likin, there is still no relief from the pain of heavy taxation. The future of the porcelain industry is becoming increasingly difficult. Recently, porcelain merchants have expressed the painful situation of heavy multiple taxation to the chamber of commerce, requesting it to submit it to the government for relief to maintain national goods. The complaint states that, regarding Jiangxi porcelain, since Guangzhou is adjacent to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is a tax-free port, porcelain is imported directly from Hong Kong. Export exemptions</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>taxes, so the cost is naturally lower. Lower costs mean prosperous business. Avoiding the heavy and choosing the light is inevitable. Looking at the export of porcelain in Guangzhou, compared to ten years ago, it is only one-tenth or one-twelfth. The customs records can be investigated. Moreover, national goods such as local cloth and local products have been exempted from export tax by the government. It seems that the precedent should be followed. The government should completely exempt export porcelain tax to relieve the pain. First, merchants purchase Jiangxi porcelain and transport it to this city by Yue-Han railway. According to the railway bureau's regulations, regardless of the type of goods, it always collects the fifth-class freight rate. Unexpectedly, the Ministry of Railways suddenly changed the regulations. Fine porcelain is collected at the third-class freight rate, ordinary porcelain is collected at the fourth-class freight rate, and coarse porcelain is collected at the fifth-class freight rate. It is transported from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, to Ganzhou, to Nan'an, to Nanxiong, to Shaoguan. It is loaded onto the train in Shaoguan, and arrives in Guangzhou. It passes through five ports, experiences three times of entering the warehouse, and three times of hiring boats. The strength of the porters at each port is uneven, and the size of the boats varies. It is transshipped and loaded and unloaded in a chaotic manner. Therefore, only the number of pieces can be checked when loading the train in Shaoguan, and there is no</p>
<p>detail to distinguish. If it is misreported occasionally, it will be accused of false reporting and punished. The consequences are often severe. The government should still collect freight rates as before to alleviate the difficulties. Second, regarding Chaozhou porcelain, the principle of taxation is one tax per item. However, Chaozhou porcelain, which is tragically seized by foreign goods, is the opposite. It starts from Gaopo, and Dongguan tax is paid in Chao'an. Through tax is paid along the Meixi River. Export tax must be paid in Shantou. After arriving in Guangzhou City, Guangfu tax must be paid, as well as the Taiwan artillery fee. One item pays as many as five taxes. It is difficult to revitalize national goods. The government should exempt taxes along the way to comply with one tax per item. First, the average value of Chaozhou porcelain is about five yuan per hundred catties, while the customs tax is four mace and five cents of customs silver per hundred catties. Including the surtax, it is a total of six mace, seven cents, and five li of customs silver, which exceeds 12%. The total number of checkpoints along the way is no less than 30% of the value. The Guangfu tax factory also stipulates reporting and cancellation numbers. The harsh regulations are binding. If you forget it, you will be punished.

<h3 id="e79">The True Situation of Anhui Province's Financial Deficit <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>A Shortfall of More Than 4.7 Million</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Anhui Province's finances have always been strained. Government and military expenses have been increasing in recent years, resulting in an increasingly large shortfall. According to the budget for the 19th year of the Republic, expenditures exceed income by more than 4.7 million yuan, as shown below:</p>
<p>Under the heading of annual income: Land tax: 4,300,000 yuan; Deed, tooth, livestock, and slaughter taxes: 1,410,000 yuan; Various miscellaneous income: 1,560,000 yuan (including public report fees, tuition fees, legal fees, official business fees, provincial products, and fines); Temporary miscellaneous income: 886,000 yuan (including road construction bond funds, rice merchant bonds, mineral quality inspection fees, etc.); Central government subsidy for education: 1,200,000 yuan (the central government recovered Anhui Province's original cigarette surtax education fee and subsidizes 100,000 yuan per month); Salt surtax allocated by the central government: 2,016,000 yuan (Anhui Province's original salt tax surcharge in central Anhui has been ordered to stop, and the central government will return 608,000 yuan per month). Total: 11,372,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Under the heading of annual expenditure: Party affairs expenses: 861,072 yuan; Administrative expenses: 2,101,199 yuan (including county governments); Judicial expenses: 1,004,148 yuan; Provincial defense expenses: 2,938,378 yuan (salaries and expenses for two brigades and two regiments of provincial defense forces and security teams, and bandit suppression expenses); Public security expenses: 1,024,804 yuan; Financial expenses: 579,164 yuan; Education expenses: 2,763,085 yuan; Construction expenses: 3,792,845 yuan; Debt expenses: 402,082 yuan (repayment of rice merchant bonds and road construction bonds, and land taxes borrowed from northern Anhui counties in the 19th year of the Republic); General reserve expenses: 702,785 yuan. Total: 16,169,562 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the above table, expenditures exceed income by 4.7 million yuan. If there are disasters or bandits, income will be further reduced. The Anhui Provincial Government previously planned to implement a rice inspection donation and salt per-catty surtax, but they have now been canceled one after another. How to make up for this in the future is a real problem. It is heard that the Commander-in-Chief's Office will provide a monthly subsidy of 100,000 yuan, but there is still a shortfall of more than 3 million yuan. Financial Director Liu Pengyi went to Beijing yesterday to take up his duties, presumably for this reason. (April 3rd)</p>

<p>Bengbu Dispatch: After Jiang Guochang, a notorious bandit in eastern Anhui, was killed by Zhang Lisheng's Second Cavalry Division last month, the remaining bandits, recently joined by the fierce bandit Mao Laoliu's gang, continue to roam and cause disturbances in the border area of Mengcheng, Huaiyuan, and Dingyuan counties. Zhang Shutian, commander of the Fourth Cavalry Brigade, has been dispatching teams to search and suppress them for days, achieving significant victories. Mao Laoliu's gang was recently surrounded by Zhang's troops at Lujiagang. The bandits initially put up a stubborn resistance from a blockhouse, but after a fierce attack by government troops, Mao Laoliu was killed at the foot of the blockhouse, and the fake battalion commander Little White Dragon was also killed. In this battle, over fifty bandits were killed, more than forty were burned to death, and a minor bandit leader named Liu Quanfa was captured alive. More than ten guns were seized, and more than fifty kidnapped men and women were rescued and returned to their families. The captured bandit Liu Quanfa was executed on the spot. Currently, Brigade Commander Zhang is ordering his regiments to conduct searches in separate directions towards the bandits' lairs in the Laojiashan and Zhongjiashan areas, aiming to thoroughly eliminate them.

<p>The Department Orders All Steamship Companies to Obtain Navigation Certificates: The Jiangsu Construction Department previously ordered all shipping associations in various localities to ensure that inland steamships obtain navigation certificates before March 31st, and issued regulations for this purpose. The shipping associations in various localities informed the steamship companies, which collectively stated that complying with the department's regulations would create many obstacles and be difficult to implement. There was a need to apply for an extension and modify the procedures, which was jointly submitted by the Wujin and Wuxi shipping associations. The difficulties were divided into two points. Recently, a response was received from the Construction Department, stating: (1) After reviewing the navigation certificate regulations issued by this department for inland steamships, which were piloted last December, Article 2 requires filling in details of Ministry permits and customs notifications, etc. If the steamship companies have existing customs permits, they should have obtained them from customs long ago. Why did they wait until the deadline for certificate application at the end of March to request the association to forward the request? It is unavoidable to suspect deliberate delay. In addition to requiring each steamship company to obtain the permits from customs, we will tentatively allow forwarding of letters, but this cannot be used as an excuse for delay, violating the regulations. (2) Tugs with permits should fill them in as per the permits, and those without permits should obtain them from customs. However, all other items still need to be filled in according to the form, without needing to order the bureau to issue permits. This avoids delaying the deadline. Those using foreign-owned ships should declare it accordingly. As for the request for an extension of the certificate application deadline, it cannot be approved. They should immediately urge the steamship companies to comply with the regulations and submit their applications. If they dare to deliberately delay, they will be punished according to the law. Upon receiving the response, the Wuxi shipping association has already notified all steamship companies. A Major Fire at Longhua Temple Causes Many Casualties: The Longhua Temple at Tanbo Bridge, Twenty-Six Ward, outside the South Gate, was recently initiated by Wang Qinxu, the owner of the Hechu Sanmao Grocery Store, to hold an eighteen-day Longhua Society (i.e., Longhua Association). Over one hundred old Buddhist women from the city attended the meeting. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out on the second floor of the temple. At the time, there was a strong wind, which fueled the fire, and it quickly spread. Various fire brigades rushed to the scene to put out the fire, and it was extinguished after 4:00 PM. It is estimated that six halls and upper and lower floors of the main Buddha hall were burned down, with losses of about four to five thousand taels of silver. Two old women, Li Wang and a child, Wang Jishou, were burned to death, and five people, including Dai Wang, Shao Zhou, and Su Cao, were burned and sent to Puren Hospital for treatment. One old woman, Zhu, was seriously injured and her life is in danger. Afterwards, the responsible Public Security Third Branch sent police to take Ai Da, the woman in charge of the temple, to the bureau and then to the county Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Also, at about 8:00 PM that evening, five buildings of the Xiafang of the Taifu Silk Factory in Luojiahama, under the Ta Bridge outside the South Gate, were also burned down, affecting thirteen households. Two children, A Shengniang's son, Gengsheng, and Zhao Agai's daughter, Ximei, were burned to death. In addition, at Kaihua temple, north of the Xida Bridge in Nanfangquan, the home of Lu Shiliang was also suddenly burned down at 7:00 PM that afternoon due to carelessness, with four new and old houses completely destroyed, estimated losses of around ten thousand yuan. A Vagrant Gang Demands Money Through Extortion and is Arrested: Gu Hu, a woman from Fuzhou, Ganke Township, Fifteenth District of the county, is 45 years old and works as a lime boat puller. The other day, when her cargo ship returned home from Shanghai, a gang of vagrants, including Liu Ating, Gao Arong, and Yu Baolin, broke into her house with thirty to forty people and demanded 300 yuan in extortion. Gu Hu had no choice but to be extorted 62 yuan. Afterwards, she reported the incident to the county Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to arrest Liu Ating and strictly ordered the arrest of Gao and others for legal action.</p>
<p>A Corpse Retains a Lifelike Appearance After Half a Year: A resident surnamed Han in Han Lane, near Shitangwan, Sixteenth District of the county, is quite wealthy. His wife, Ding, passed away last August, and her coffin was temporarily placed in Ding Lane. Unexpectedly, some local ruffians, believing that Han was wealthy and might have buried valuables with his wife, dug up Ding's coffin in the middle of the night the other day. A gold ring and a pair of gold bracelets were stolen. The next day, Han discovered the theft and reburied Ding's coffin. However, although Ding had been dead for more than half a year, her complexion remained lifelike, so people called her a "stiff corpse." It is rare to see a corpse in a temporarily placed coffin not decompose.</p>

<p>Military Department Urges Handling of Camp Property Embezzlement Case: The Ministry of Military Affairs previously received a petition from Yu Buji and others accusing the Yonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company of embezzling military farmland from the Su and Lang camps. Last year, it drafted three measures ordering the county to instruct the company to comply. Recently, Qian Xueqi and other residents of Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan stating that the company's embezzled military property has been decided to be taken over by the Ministry, and they requested to pay for it and take over the management. The Executive Yuan, considering that the case has not yet been concluded, ordered the Ministry of Military Affairs to investigate and respond.

<p>Civil Affairs Department Sends Commissioner to Investigate Major Opium Case: Huang Bingying accused Yang Bingwei, the former head of the detective team, and Chen Xiangbao, a team member, of jointly dividing up opium. Since Yang and Chen fled and are being wanted by the county, and the plaintiff Huang Bingying is also avoiding appearing, the case cannot be thoroughly clarified. The provincial government has now ordered the Civil Affairs Department to investigate and respond. Director Hu has sent inspector Wu Zezhong to Jiangyin on the 3rd to conduct a secret investigation.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Sandbar Reclamation Leads to Dam Destruction: Zhu Benliang, the township head of the fourteenth township in the fourth district of Shazhou, and others stated that after the Lanli Company built a sea dike in 1922, the silted land was gradually occupied by wealthy people from the city and countryside. Only the sandbar claims obtained by mud workers in exchange for labor have not yet been realized. Last spring, representatives Zhu Tingyan and others filed a lawsuit with Zhu Tinghua and Chen Qichang over the illegal sandbar enclosure. Unexpectedly, on the 23rd of last month, Chen Qichang, along with Ye Zengpei, Wang Yingnan, Sha Wenbiao, Tang Qiwei, and others, and Huang Zhifang, the director of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, sent patrol officer Zhao Zhongpeng and others to forcibly enclose the land and arrest Mu Dashu. When they searched Chen Jinlong's home, the mud workers were outraged and mobilized people to confront the followers of Chen Qichang and the patrol officers of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Township Head Zhu and others believed that since the sandbar dispute was already in litigation, both parties should wait for a legal judgment and should not mobilize people to destroy the dike, and Director Huang Zhifang of the Third Branch should not be exploited to interfere in the land reclamation, causing disputes. Yesterday, they submitted a petition to the county government and the Public Security Bureau, requesting that they be quickly ordered to stop the activity.</p>
<p>Director Mao Negotiates Loans for the Cheng-Xi Highway: Since Mao Feng was appointed acting director of the Jiangyin Construction Bureau by the department, he came to office on the 3rd. Regarding the northern section of the Cheng-Xi Highway project, because the Cheng-Cai section's bridge piers have not been completed and the Qing-Yang section has not yet held a traffic opening ceremony, and the Cai-Qing section has not yet started construction, the completion of the entire road has no definite date. On the 4th, Director Mao met with the county magistrate at the county government to discuss ways to proceed with the northern section of the Cheng-Xi Highway. He also spoke with Shen Lunxu, the director of the Finance Bureau, and Wu Shuying, the chairman of the county Chamber of Commerce. Director Mao announced that the Cheng-Xi Highway is short of 30,000 yuan in funds. In addition to borrowing 10,000 yuan from the Xi-Cheng Long-Distance Bus Company, he planned to ask the Finance Bureau to borrow 10,000 yuan and the county Chamber of Commerce to borrow 10,000 yuan from various money houses to speed up the project so that the entire road can be opened to traffic by June 1st.</p>

<p>Citizens Petition for Funds to Build Riverbank Protection in Guazhou: Zhang Mingxuan, Zhang Bohua, Liu Changchun, Ji Tiantong, and other gentry, merchants, and citizens of Guazhou, across the river from Zhenjiang, stated that the riverbank on the east side of the Guazhou River has been collapsing frequently due to erosion by the river tide over the years. The bank built over the years since the Republic has almost completely collapsed, especially the collapsed area of the first dike, where the outer beach is only a few feet away from the bank at its closest point. The outer beach between the Ji Family and the Majia Port is only twenty-odd feet away from the bank. In an instant, when the tide rises, the bank will collapse. Therefore, they requested the provincial government to allocate funds for building riverbank protection so that the people inside the dike would not be displaced. The planned project would be approximately 1,400 to 1,500 feet long and would require 14,000 to 15,000 yuan. If only the dangerous areas are worked on, it would be about 700 to 800 feet long and would require 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. The exact construction plan will be decided after the provincial government conducts a survey.</p>

Due to the strong westerly wind, the fire spread rapidly. Firefighters from various districts rushed to the scene and, after extinguishing the fire for a long time, finally put it out. It is estimated that three houses were burned down, and all valuables and equipment were destroyed. The losses are said to be significant. Also, at about 10:00 PM on the same day, a fire broke out at the home of a Bao-surnamed rice shop at the entrance of Xia Ya Lane in the city. Fortunately, the fire brigades were effective in their rescue efforts, preventing the fire from spreading to neighboring houses. As a result, a firewood shed was burned down.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Holds All-School Student Military Review and Opens Sports Day</p>
<p>Xiamen University was founded solely by the overseas Chinese businessman Chen Jiageng. It has been ten years since it opened in 1921. The facilities are complete and the buildings are magnificent. It currently has five colleges: Arts, Science, Law, Education, and Commerce, as well as an affiliated high school. The professors are all well-known figures in the country. The construction cost reached more than 1.4 million yuan, and the annual recurring expenses reached more than 1.7 million yuan. It is the first private university to be registered. Since May of last year, it has been approved by the National Government to subsidize Chen Jiageng's educational undertakings with 5,000 yuan per month. The Education College of the school has also been designated by the Central Training Department as one of the schools to which subsidized graduating party members can apply. The other colleges are also developing fully. It is reported that the school is scheduled to hold the 10th anniversary celebration ceremony at the Zhixian Building Auditorium in the school at 10:00 AM on April 6th (the school's founding anniversary). On the same day, there will be an all-school student military review and a sports day. On the 6th and 7th, the zoological garden, botanical garden, library, astronomical observatory, tannery, antiquities exhibition room, and various laboratories will be open to welcome visitors. It is also reported that the school will publish a special 10th anniversary issue on the anniversary, which will be printed by the Shanghai Commercial Press. The content is said to be particularly rich.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Central Film and Cultural Propaganda Committee (Continued) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(7) Propaganda for Industry and Commerce to Revitalize Industry: The phrase "revitalize industry" is familiar to us. However, in the market, almost all commodities are imported goods. Even with just the textile industry, the annual losses already amount to tens of millions of yuan, not to mention others. Today, people advocate for domestic goods as a catchphrase, but with little effect. Why is this? It is because the advocates do not use the right methods, and the entrepreneurs lack guidance. For today's plan, it is difficult to expect results without large-scale propaganda. If films can be used to introduce Western industrial manufacturing methods in detail, so that we can learn from them and make improvements, and if the rich resources of the interior of each province can be shown on the screen to facilitate the development of industrialists, while also demonstrating the advantages and disadvantages of using foreign goods versus domestic goods, making people visually shocked and subtly influenced, then it will benefit the development of our country's industry and commerce in no small way.</p>
<p>(8) Propaganda for Agriculture: Our country claims to be based on agriculture, but recently, according to customs reports, over 200 million yuan of foreign rice is imported each year. This matter is of great concern and has a significant impact on the national economy. However, what is the root cause? Everyone wants to have a bumper harvest, but they end up suffering from famine. How can that be? However, our country's farmers have limited knowledge, and the agricultural tools they use are old-fashioned and clumsy. All work relies on the weather. When there are floods or droughts, they are helpless. The root cause lies in the lack of knowledge. To remedy this, it is necessary to equip farmers with agricultural knowledge. For example, in the winter of 1928, an agricultural tool exhibition was held in the suburbs of Paris. People from all over came to participate, asking about prices or how to use the tools, and buying what they needed. Only the Japanese carried cameras, one to photograph the shapes and structures of various agricultural tools, and the other to photograph their use. I asked them sincerely as a friend, "What is your intention in photographing this film?" He replied, "I am commissioned by the government to be stationed in Europe to film various news items and new products in agriculture and industry to inform the people of our country. This method is more convenient and can announce the truth without omission. If I were to make drawings of the works in this exhibition, then translate and explain them, it would take several months, and the result would still be empty talk on paper. Whether the people of our country can understand the use of these new products would still be questionable. Now, it only takes fourteen days to send them to Tokyo, so that when our people see this film, it is as if they have personally experienced this conference and know how to imitate it." From this, we can see that the power of making films is not insignificant. Now that our country's farmers' knowledge is so shallow, if we can imitate the Japanese method and make films of the latest agricultural tools and their use in various countries to promote them among the people, it will enable ordinary farmers to compete to imitate them, and the increase in production can be expected in a short time.</p>
<p>(Propaganda) Colonizing Borders, Immigrating and Comforting Overseas Chinese: Prosperous areas in the interior are troubled by dense populations. People think it is easy to make a living in familiar places. However, they do not know that colonizing the borders, with vast fertile land and gold everywhere, has gone unnoticed. Although it is said that this is due to transportation obstacles and difficulty in traveling, the real reason is not only this. The people in the interior do not know the real situation of the border areas, so they dare not go there rashly. Now, if we can film the prosperity of Mongolia, Tibet, and other places and the methods of development, and promote them widely, with special awards from the government, so that the unemployed will be happy to go there to earn a living, then the number of vagrants will naturally decrease, and production will increase day by day. Not only will our people be able to live and work in peace and happiness, but the people of the world will also indirectly receive its benefits, because production will increase. Therefore, propaganda for colonizing borders and immigrating is an essential plan. Furthermore, overseas Chinese have long suffered from the oppression of imperialism. I wonder how many people want to return to their motherland. If the government can compile concrete plans for urgently needed construction projects, set up plans, and establish measures to protect overseas Chinese investment in their home country, then if even one-tenth of the thirty million overseas Chinese return to invest, it will be extremely easy to start various construction projects and will benefit the country and the people in no small way. Otherwise, the motherland will remain the motherland, and the overseas Chinese will remain overseas Chinese, with no connection to each other, and neither will benefit. However, to arouse their idea of returning to invest, we must rely on film propaganda. Overseas Chinese are tens of thousands of miles away and do not know the real situation of their motherland. Therefore, they are hesitant to wait and see. Now, if we can film the richness of the whole country and the stability of the country and screen them in various places, arousing the interest of overseas Chinese in returning to invest, it would be an essential plan for today.</p>
<p>The above are just a few of the most outstanding examples. If we can implement them one by one, the effects will be as such. If we can promote them extensively, the benefits will be unlimited. I offer my humble opinion. I welcome my countrymen to teach me if I am correct. (The End)</p>

<p>The China Vocational Education Society held its 19th academic lecture the day before yesterday, with over 130 attendees. They invited Cai Yuanpei to give a lecture titled "The Criteria for Choosing a Profession." Mr. Yang Weiyu from the society gave an introductory speech. Mr. Cai's main points were that professions can be divided into mental and physical labor. Mental laborers govern others, while physical laborers are governed. Mental laborers are inventors and politicians, while physical laborers are practitioners. However, there are right and wrong, beneficial and harmful distinctions. Since ancient times, our country's mistaken concepts of professions have buried talent. It should be known that professions have no distinction of high or low, noble or base; all are equal. Those that benefit the people are righteous professions. For example, farmers who plant tobacco seedlings, workers who create poisonous gas to harm people, and merchants who sell opium and monopolize the market are engaged in unrighteous professions. The government should protect and encourage people's professions, enabling everyone to be properly allocated according to their strengths. Public undertakings will then be able to make efforts to improve. Male and female professions should be based on a division of labor, each serving society according to their natural inclinations. Housekeeping is also an important profession for women. In summary, the most important principle for choosing a profession is to consider social needs and take the happiness of the masses as a prerequisite; one should not harm the public for personal comfort. The lecture lasted an hour, and the audience listened attentively and were moved. At the end, Mr. Yang expressed his thanks, and the meeting was dismissed. It is said that the next lecture (on the 11th) has been scheduled, with Mr. Shen Junyi, director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, speaking on "The New Shanghai Plan." Mr. Shen is an industrial expert with extensive research on municipal affairs, and it is expected that he will contribute valuable insights at that time. Those who wish to attend the lecture are requested to obtain a lecture ticket from the society.</p>

<p>The Central China Games have been held four times, successively in Wuchang, Changsha, Jiujiang, and Wuhu. This year marks the fifth session, which will be held in Hankou. Yesterday, I met with Song Ruhai, leader of the Central China Football Team, who said that Hankou Mayor Liu Wendao has shown great interest in promoting sports and has appointed Song as the director of the preparatory committee for this year's Central China Games. At the end of April, he will convene responsible personnel from the four provinces to discuss matters. The Hankou Municipal Government has approved an appropriation of 90,000 yuan to repair the sports field and has a plan to build a sports hall to commemorate the martyrs. He will request financial assistance from the central government. The opening date of the games is tentatively scheduled for September, which will serve as a preliminary selection for the National Games.</p>

<p>First Match: North China Team vs. Central China Team</p>
<p>Tomorrow at 4 PM at the Baseball Field</p>
<p>Sichuan-England Football Team's Representation of Southwest China Rejected</p>
<p>Full Schedule Set, Closing on the 12th</p>
<p>The National Zonal Championship Football Tournament will open tomorrow at 4 PM after the North China team arrived in Shanghai the night before last. The North China and Central China teams will play the first match, and the tournament will close on the 12th. The Sichuan-England team's eligibility to represent Southwest China was rejected at yesterday's meeting. Details of yesterday's news are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e107">Delegation Holds Meeting <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, representatives from each team gathered at the Chinese Sports Advancement Association. Attendees included Shen Silang, president of the association; Zhou Jiaqi, secretary; Ma Yuehan, representative of North China; Song Ruhai, representative of Central China; Le Xiurong, representative of East China; and Liu Guangmei, representative of the Sichuan-England Football Team. The meeting was chaired by Shen Silang.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Sichuan-England Representative's Right Rejected <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The most important issue decided first was whether the Sichuan-England Football Team could represent Southwest China. Liu Guangmei, representative of Sichuan-England, stated that transportation in Southwest China was difficult and sports were underdeveloped. Chairman Liu Wenhui had sent a telegram requesting that Sichuan-England be allowed to attend, asking the conference to make an exception for the sake of promoting sports. However, the representatives believed that while promoting sports was important, they could not make an exception for the sake of the zonal tournament's future. If Sichuan-England could represent Southwest China, it would become a Shanghai zonal football tournament, which would be contrary to the spirit and principles of the national zonal tournament. If such a precedent were set, any team unable to attend in the future could ask residents living in that area to represent them, which would be difficult to imagine. Furthermore, the East China team included people from South China, so whom would they represent? This would become a problem. For the sake of the future, the request was unanimously rejected. However, for the sake of promoting sports, the conference could ask the association to send an official letter to the Sichuan provincial government, urging them to vigorously promote sports. They expressed great respect for the spirit of Sichuan-England. After more than two hours, a satisfactory solution was reached, and it was resolved to report the details to the Sichuan provincial government.</p>

<p>Next, the competition method was decided. It was agreed to adopt a single round-robin system, with each team playing each other once. The tournament will open on the 8th and end on the 12th. The game time will be 90 minutes. If there is no winner, the game will be extended by 30 minutes. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) North China vs. Central China, 4 PM on the 8th (2) East China vs. Central China, 4 PM on the 10th (3) North China vs. East China, 3 PM on the 12th</p>

<p>The Central China Football Team was organized by the Hankou Municipal Government and business community. Due to various reasons, some members could not arrive earlier. Yesterday, Tang Xingtian (secretary), Yuan Qingwu, Xiao Bo, and Jinhua Jin all rushed to Shanghai. Hearing that the games would start yesterday, they took a Wuchang ship and arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 5th. Yesterday morning, they arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the entire Central China Football Team, led by Song Ruhai, practiced at the Chinese Baseball Field. They worked hard and their skills were quite good. They first attacked the north goal and then practiced attacking the south goal, returning only in the middle of the day. In the afternoon, the North China team practiced on the field. Goalkeeper Huang Zhenquan performed very well. Dozens of spectators watched and applauded from time to time. The right wing was stronger. They drove away only at dusk. North China will be a strong opponent for East China, and there will be another fierce battle.</p>

<p>Shanghai Sports Association Wins Both Titles</p>
<p>First in Individual and First in Team</p>
<p>Champion: French Verdun</p>
<p>Third: Bai Hong Ma Fengrui</p>
<p>Time: 44 minutes 45 seconds</p>
<p>This year's annual cross-country race was held yesterday morning, with a course of eight miles on Jiangwan Road. As a result, the Shanghai Sports Association's A team won both titles, first in the team and first in the individual. The champion was Verdun from the team, with a time of 44 minutes and 45 seconds. Bai Hong Ma Fengrui fought hard and took third place, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Departure Scene: Among the Chinese participants were Ma Fengrui, Zhou Yuyu, and Dong Jia et al., a total of six people. In this participation, a total of 44 people. At 10 o'clock, they lined up in front of the Hongkou Park gate, and Pearce gave the order to start, heading towards Jiangwan Road. Verdun immediately took the lead, followed closely by Sgott, a soldier of the German army. Remy and Ma Fengrui followed together, and Nuggepot followed.</p>
<p>Flying Forward: After about a mile, they reached the wilderness. Verdun ran faster and faster, with tighter steps. Except for Remy and Ma Fengrui, all the rest fell far behind. After three miles, Verdun, Remy, and Ma were sixty or seventy yards ahead of the others. The situation changed half a mile from the finish line.</p>
<p>Ma Falls Behind: After crossing the Jiangwan Road Bridge, Verdun rushed forward. Remy and Ma tried desperately to catch up for two hundred yards. Ma Fengrui was exhausted and fell behind. Remy also tried hard to keep up, but ultimately felt no match for Verdun.</p>
<p>Swift Victory: Verdun still had plenty of energy, took the lead, and won the championship with a time of 44 minutes and 45 seconds, which was slightly worse than Remy's time last year, but the wind was quite strong, which was the reason for the inferiority. Remy was twenty-five yards behind, and Ma Fengrui was two hundred yards behind. After the race, Miss Hentou awarded the prizes.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Shanghai Coal Industry Proposes Recovering Kailuan Coal Mine <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association sent telegrams to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating: "The world's material evolution requires coal as a driving force in everything. The use of coal can be said to be grand. The relationship between coal and the prosperity and decline of the country is also extremely close. On February 19, 1910, British merchant Moller and Bime Company used fraudulent means to acquire the property of the Kaiping Mining Bureau without our side receiving any compensation. The perpetrators and destroyers in this matter were Zhang Yanmou, the director of the Kaiping Bureau, and Detring, the customs officer of Tianjin Hai Customs, who was the acting general manager of Kaiping. Although the Qing court later ordered Zhang Yanmou to recover the mine, Zhang Yanmou went to England to sue, which was justified in law, but in reality, he was still unable to recover it. This is a major and painful history of China's coal mines. During the Guangxu period, Zhou Xuexi raised funds to establish the Zhengzhou Coal Mine to resist Kaiping. However, due to weak capital and oppression from Kaiping, it was eventually merged by Kaiping, backfiring and causing heartache. This is the origin of the Kai Zheng Mining Bureau. For thirty years since then, the rights of the Kai Zheng Coal Mine have been in the hands of British merchants. Chinese shareholders receive only a small fraction of the profits. Their monopoly and manipulation have gone unquestioned. The losses in this matter are incalculable. We have always believed that all of China's humiliating and rights-compromising matters are caused by unequal treaties. Few know that the Kaiping Mining Bureau was cheated out of its property by British merchant Moller and Bime Company without compensation. Few also know that the Zhengzhou Coal Mine was annexed by British merchant Moller et al. through oppressive means. It can be said that the loss of the Kai Zheng Coal Mine does not fall within the scope of unequal treaties, but is due to the British merchants' use of illegal means, fraud, and annexation. If we say that canceling all unequal treaties will allow us to recover the Kai Zheng Coal Mine, it seems that this cannot be fully encompassed. This should be handled as a separate case, with legal action taken, and an audit of assets and compensation for damages sought in order to protect legal interests to the greatest extent possible. Now that the National Assembly is approaching, we respectfully submit this outline and request that the National Assembly allow the recovery of the Kai Zheng Coal Mine to be included on the agenda and discussed as a separate case. We hope to obtain appropriate methods and quickly set a recovery period in order to extend the spirit of the rule of law and rectify the country's coal rights. We earnestly submit this matter and pray for your approval. The country will be fortunate, the coal industry will be fortunate. The Shanghai Coal Industry Association respectfully submits."</p>

<p>Trial Reports Show Good Results</p>
<p>Due to the inability to directly communicate between China and Siam, international telegrams from the International Wireless Radio Telegraph Station established by the Ministry of Communications were forwarded by the Java Radio Station. Recently, the station deemed it necessary to directly transmit messages due to the close proximity between China and Siam. It then made preparations for trial broadcasts at the Fenglinqiao receiving station and the Liuhang transmitting station, and repeatedly conducted trial broadcasts with the ksg station established by the Siamese Radio Station. The radio waves were clear and fully capable of direct communication. The Ministry of Communications is currently in telegraphic communication with the Siamese government to discuss and finalize the China-Siam communication contract, which will be completed soon. As soon as the station receives instructions from the Ministry, it will officially begin communication.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Special News from the Shipping Industry <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>All Yangtze River Ships Resume Service: Since the Northern Expedition, Shanghai's Chinese-owned Yangtze River ships have been unable to fully resume service due to continuous warfare and the requisitioning of Yangtze River ships for military transport. In recent years, the Yangtze River shipping operations of China Merchants, Sanbei, and Ningshao have suffered significant losses. In order to consider the shipping merchants, the headquarters has given preferential lease payments for chartered ships and approved the issuance of shipping bonds to subsidize them. Now that military transport has ended, the Yangtze River ships of the three companies are being gradually released by the Ministry of Communications. China Merchants and Sanbei have resumed operations with the released ships in recent days. Ningshao's Yongxing ship, the last to be released to Shanghai, will also arrive in Shanghai today. After entering the dock for repairs, it will join the Yangtze River route. The Yangtze River Chinese ships, which have been out of service for several years, will be fully operational from today.</p>
<p>Request to Abolish Inner Harbor Licenses: The Jianghai Customs has promulgated regulations on the licensing of commercial ships in the inner harbor, notifying various shipping companies in Shanghai to promptly have their ships operating in the inner harbor re-licensed. After discussions among the shipping merchants in Shanghai, it was unanimously agreed that the customs' establishment of inner harbor ship licenses was intended to restrict foreign ships. If Chinese commercial ships have already complied with regulations and presented their registration to the Ministry and obtained a customs ship license, they should not be required to re-license their inner harbor ships, as this would be self-restricting. This matter was raised at the transportation conference and was passed but not implemented. The entire Shanghai shipping merchants association should submit a request to the Ministry, ordering all customs houses to immediately abolish the unfavorable regulations requiring Chinese commercial ships to re-license their inner harbor ships. The Shipping Association has now been publicly elected to submit a request to the Ministry to abolish this regulation.</p>
<p>Weihai Route Opens: After British ships abandoned the Weihaiwei route, the China Merchants Bureau proposed taking over the route. Xu Zushan of the Weihaiwei Administration also repeatedly requested the bureau to send ships to operate the route to facilitate cargo, passengers, and mail, thereby boosting the market. The China Merchants Bureau accepted his request and, following the example of British ships, requested the Ministry of Communications to allocate 4,000 yuan to the bureau. This case has been under negotiation for a long time and has not yet been approved, and the Weihai Administration has also failed to commit to payment. The China Merchants Bureau has now drafted regulations for adding the Weihai Bureau, and has signed a contract with the Weihai manager in charge, stipulating 18 articles. It is agreed that expenses will be deducted from the freight charges. A certain amount of expenses will be given for each ship. Once the contract is signed, the Beiyang ship will be ordered to also serve Weihai. Since the subsidy has not been received, a temporary agency will be established, and it will be expanded into a branch office once business develops.</p>
<p>Railroad Materials Transported to Hankou: A large batch of railroad tracks newly purchased from the United Kingdom by the Pinghan Railway has arrived, totaling 500 tons. New materials for the Yellow River Railway Bridge have also arrived at the same time. This cargo has been temporarily unloaded at the Yunzaobang Wharf in Wusong. Because of the urgent need to load it for laying, the Ministry of Railways has agreed with the British merchant Taikoo Shipping (Chinese commercial ships do not have heavy lifting equipment and cannot transport it, so foreign ships have been converted) to transport the railroad tracks and new bridges from Wusong to Hankou for laying.</p>

They have agreed to increase the export freight for silk to Europe immediately. It was agreed that the price of each 112-pound bale of silk would increase from 4 taels and 4 mace to more than 6 taels recently. The unprecedented increase in silk transport costs has been set and notified to various customers for implementation. The new and old freight rates are recorded below:</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Orders the Nagasaki Consul to Negotiate</p>
<p>According to news from the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, regarding the incident of the Japanese ship "Himeshima Maru" sinking the ship of Zhu Aliang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had ordered the consul in Nagasaki to earnestly negotiate with the ship's company, the Kihira Joint-Stock Company, and order them to compensate Zhu Aliang for all losses. The Kihira Company used the excuse that the ships collided and both parties suffered losses, and that it would only be able to fulfill its obligations after the Admiralty Court made a ruling based on the facts. Now, a telegram has been received from the consul in Nagasaki stating that the case has been determined by the Admiralty Court to not require a trial, so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a telegram ordering the consul to continue negotiating with the Kihira Company. The report that the Office ordered Zhu to file a lawsuit with the Japanese consulate is not factual.</p>

<p>The Fortress Headquarters Sends a Letter Requesting the Municipal Government to Negotiate</p>
<p>Yan Zemin, the commander of the guard of the Wusong District Fortress Headquarters, reported a few days ago that several foreigners wearing Western clothes suddenly came to the rear guard post of the headquarters, carrying cameras, and secretly photographed the South Fort of the fortress. Commander Yan believed that this matter concerned foreigners spying on China's national defense secrets, so he immediately led the guards,</p>
<p>Fortress, foreigners are not allowed to take pictures without authorization, in order to attach importance to national defense and promote friendly relations, and temporarily detained the two cameras carried by the Japanese and turned them over to the department. The deputy adjutant of the department, Shen Zitian, together with Mr. Yan and others, went to the site to investigate and found that the foreigners were still lingering. It was learned that they were all Japanese nationals, named Yoshitomi Yoshiki, Otsuki Shun, Kaii Yowao, and Obata Kenkichi, all employees of the Nichihua Textile Co., Ltd., currently residing at 98 Robert Road. They claimed that they came to Songjiang this time purely for a spring outing, and took photos of the fort only because of its beautiful scenery, and had no other intentions. They took out a stack of banknotes from their pockets and tried to bribe Deputy Adjutant Shen, asking for the return of the cameras. Deputy Adjutant Shen strictly refused, saying that this matter was of great importance and must be reported to the superiors for handling, and that he had no authority to handle it. The four Japanese then remained silent and left. Later, the sentry reported that there were seven or eight Japanese in total that day, carrying no less than five or six cameras. After the guard commander Yan Zemin stopped them, four or five people took the opportunity to escape, so only these four people were left. The photos reflected in the cameras were all torn up by the Japanese on the spot. However, these broken photos have now been collected and presented to the department by Mr. Yan. Deng Zhenquan, commander of the Wusong District Fortress, believed that this matter was of great importance, so he sent a letter to the Municipal Government detailing the incident, requesting that the Municipal Government forward the letter to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai to punish the Japanese and ensure that this type of incident does not happen again in the future. It is learned that the Municipal Government has already sent a letter to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Murai Kuramatsu, requesting that he promptly comply, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Customs Workers Strike Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Cotton Cloth Industry Association's Cancellation of Transportation Fees</p>
<p>More than 800 customs workers in this city went on strike yesterday morning because the Cotton Cloth Industry Association implemented the cancellation of cotton cloth transportation fees and customs inspection fees, and repeated requests to restore them were unsuccessful. The details are as follows: Yesterday's Strike Customs workers have been paid transportation fees and customs inspection fees by merchants dealing in cotton cloth for more than eighty years. Now, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association has decided that, starting from April 1st, buyers will be responsible for these fees themselves. Repeated requests to restore the original transportation fees have not been adequately answered by the Association, so they automatically went on strike yesterday morning. However, workers were still sent to clear customs for foreign miscellaneous goods.</p>
<p>Organizing Inspection Teams After the customs workers went on strike, in order to prevent smuggling, they organized inspection teams, divided into day and night shifts. There were a total of thirteen day teams: (1) Checking stack manifests at various foreign firms, Cheng Pinshun, Jiang Miaojin; (2) Customs and Revenue and Taxation Bureau, Yu Xingfa; (3) Mitsubishi Wharf to Huashun Wharf, Tian Sichao, Shui Yulong; (4) Yangshupu Factory to Sanxin Factory, Gu Haibao, Cheng Xiankang; (5) Shanghai Factory to Donghua Factory, Tian Qiru, Wang Shusheng; (6) Santai to Gongda Factory, Wang Dagen, Feng Jiulin; (7) Warehouse to Hengfeng Factory, Xu Shenggui, Zhu Jinquan; (8) Zhentai Factory to Shenxin No. 2 Factory, Ni Zipeng, Ying Bingxin; (9) Inside and Outside Thirteen Factories to Gongyi Factory, Yu Yueyou, Mei Rulin; (10) Da Wang Temple to Inside and Outside Nine Factories, Shen Linde, Yan Hen; (11) Puyi No. 2 Factory to Inside and Outside No. 3 Factory, Wang Gentang, Wan Kunlin; (12) Lihe Stack to Fengji Stack, Wu Xinhua, Wang Ruisheng; (13) Ewo Wharf to Huangpu Wharf, Jiang Ansheng, Liang Jihe. There were a total of five night teams: (1) Taikoo Wharf to Hongan Wharf, Lu Pinhua; (2) Dada Wharf to Ning Shao Wharf, Chen Pinjin; (3) Mitsubishi Wharf to Tonghua Shun Wharf, Lu Hongshou; (4) Huishan Wharf to Huangpu Wharf, Zhang Yusun; (5) Longmao Stack, Shen Ziguang. The inspection was carried out day and night, and there were no cases of smuggling. The order after the strike was good.</p>
<p>Authorities Investigating Customs clearance has always been responsible for reporting Chinese and foreign cotton yarn, cloth, and foreign miscellaneous goods. If it were to completely stop, ships would inevitably have no goods to load, which would have a significant impact on transportation. In view of this, the Municipal Society immediately sent Zhang Shuye to investigate the truth and report it so that it could be verified and handled.</p>
<p>The Labor Union Presents a Document The Customs Industry Union yesterday presented a document to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the Cotton Cloth Industry Association's covenant is forcibly deducting transportation fees and inspection fees. They request that you examine and verify the matter and promptly and strictly stop it. Since March 10th, members of the union have reported to the union that the Cotton Cloth Industry Association has discontinued the payment of transportation fees, etc., which have been earned through the blood and sweat of the members for decades, since February 21st of the national calendar. After receiving the news, the union immediately convened a meeting of all directors and supervisors on March 15th and decided to first inquire about the facts. After a week, there was no reply, so they sent a letter urging a clear response. However, the association ignored it. The union was preparing to send representatives to the association to inquire about the situation, but the members rushed to the union, demanding prompt action. Therefore, the union respectfully presented a document, inviting your bureau to send personnel to the union on April 4th for guidance. However, before another day could pass, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association finally announced the release of all the union's inherent benefits in the Xin Shen and Liang newspapers on April 3rd. How can the members of the union support their families with such a small amount of hard work? Usually, they rely on transportation fees, etc., to help them with their livelihood. Moreover, this subsidy is paid by the sellers, not by the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and it is not an excessive request by the union members. Now, the association has suddenly come up with this deceitful plan to enrich itself and monopolize the market. What is the conscience of the association when the livelihood of more than 800 members of the union is at stake? At a time when the cost of living is rising day by day, they are afraid that they will not have enough time to work hard. How can the economy withstand further stimulation? The union cannot help but feel disheartened by the reports in the newspapers. Therefore, at the general assembly of representatives on the 4th, there was hardly any space left for the members who attended. The workers at the entire venue requested to go on strike immediately. Comrade Zhang Shuye, a special commissioner of your bureau, and the directors of the union, did not agree to the request, advocating for prudent handling and waiting for a solution. Unfortunately, the noise of the crowd could not be stopped. The members then put forward two conditions: (1) that the matter be resolved in the shortest possible time; (2) that all expenses be fully paid by the union until the matter is resolved, otherwise they will take free action. The directors of the union were afraid of expanding the unrest, so they had to submit a document and respectfully request your bureau to convene both parties for mediation as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Opposing the Employer's Excessive Recruitment of Apprentices</p>
<p>More than 400 hat workers in this city went on strike on April 5th because employers were excessively recruiting apprentices, resulting in unemployed workers who had no way to find employment and deducting workers' wages, making it impossible for them to maintain their daily lives. After the labor union sent representatives to negotiate with the responsible representatives of the industry association without success, they went on strike automatically to prompt the employers to realize their mistakes. Yesterday morning, Changwang Yuxiang and others, the permanent directors of the labor union, went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition and issued a declaration requesting assistance from all sectors and presenting it to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Civil Training Committee, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting a speedy mediation, it is said.</p>

Although the Social Affairs Bureau has taken the initiative to mediate, the employer has never attended. Yesterday morning at 9:00, the mediation period arrived again, and the employer still insisted on everything, leaving no room for negotiation, so it ended without results. Last night at 8:00, the labor union convened a general assembly of all members, and it was heard that the Social Affairs Bureau and the workers would jointly submit a request to the Municipal Government for arbitration to resolve everything, it is said.</p>

<p>Recently, the sea around Wusongkou has been restless. Although fishing boats are ready, they still dare not go out to sea. The provincial government believes that the spring fishing season is not only the biggest business for fishermen and merchants, but also greatly related to national tax revenue. Therefore, it has joined forces with the Pacification Commissioner and the Navy Department to carry out a major suppression. A temporary Zeng Office was established outside Songkou. Yesterday, a fleet led by the commissioner set off to suppress pirates in the Lvsi sea area, with a deadline to completely clear them out before the Grain Rain solar term, so that fishing boats can go out to sea to catch fish, maintain the fishing season, and increase tax revenue.</p>

<h3 id="e153">The Dispute Involving the Shanghai South Public Bus Yesterday <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Company Asks the Authorities to Protect the Service</p>
<p>The Defense Corps Sent Personnel Yesterday to Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>The details of the incident in which the ticket collector of the Shanghai South Public Bus Company's Route 2 special bus to Longhua was beaten by the Longhua First Team of the Caohejing Defense Corps police have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. The company believes that this matter should be mediated by the Public Security Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau. Yesterday, it specifically requested the two bureaus to send teams to protect the operation of the Route 2 bus to Longhua, to avoid further accidents. The following is the original text of the bus company's report to the Public Utilities Bureau and the Public Security Bureau:</p>
<p>Reporting Matter: On the 5th of this month, at 4:00 PM, the ticket collector Ni Wuyi reported that while he was serving on Special Bus No. 19, the bus arrived at Longhua, and suddenly, Gao Diankui, the squad leader of the Longhua First Team of the Caohejing District Defense Corps, led more than 20 militiamen, including Zhu Shiyuan, rushing up. Wei Zixin, fearing a conflict, immediately ordered the bus to be changed to a regular bus and depart. Only one person bought a two-cent ticket, seven people bought three-cent tickets, and the rest refused to buy tickets. When the bus arrived at Maogong Bridge, they rushed off, intending to ask the driver Xu Aliang to turn back to Longhua to pick up passengers. However, Gao Diankui and others, having been instigated by the Captain Wu Rugui, refused to allow the bus to turn around, dragged the reporter down, causing injuries to his waist and feet, destroyed his hat and uniform, and snatched his copper badge. They remained by the bridge, not allowing him to report to the police station. He had to return to the company to report. The ticket collector Wang Hengxi reported that while he was serving on Special Bus No. 15, traveling from Ximen to Maogong Bridge, he was stopped by more than 20 members of the Longhua Defense Corps in Caohejing District, who boarded the bus and occupied the passenger seats, not allowing passengers to board. Despite people's persuasion, the ticket collector Xue Xianglin reported that while he was serving on the special bus, going down to Maogong Bridge, he was stopped by more than 20 members of the Defense Corps, who forcibly boarded the bus without buying tickets and slapped him in the face. He had reported to the police station. Captain Jia led the police to persuade them. The driver Zhang Qiankun reported that while he was serving on the regular bus, going down to Maogong Bridge, because the bus was full, the more than 20 members of the Defense Corps blocked the bus from stopping. Then squad leader Gao led the members to chase after him on a regular bus going off duty, trying to snatch his hat. The police dispersed them. One after another, the two routes were obstructed, and the situation was extremely tense. He immediately instructed the external affairs personnel to transfer the cars stranded at Ximen back to Route 3. On one side, Director Yang Pingcai and Xia Shuxiang followed Director Liu of the Sixth District Office's phone call and met with him. Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau and Engineer An of the Public Utilities Bureau were also present, and the above situations were reported separately. It was found that the Defense Corps was established to protect merchants and civilians, and is under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government. Wu Rugui is the captain, he should abide by the law and restrain his subordinates. However, because of the reduction in fares, after external affairs personnel discovered and reported it, they followed the Public Utilities Bureau's order No. 1197 to make up the tickets. Suddenly, on the afternoon of this day, taking advantage of the large number of passengers, he ordered Squad Leader Gao Diankui of the team to lead more than 20 militiamen, repeatedly ordering the special bus, which was approved not to stop along the way, to pick up and drop off passengers at Maogong Bridge Station, violating the rules, and violently beating the driver and ticket collector. This obstructs traffic, and they are willing to test the law with their own bodies. In addition to following the instructions of Director Zhang and Engineer An to resume traffic and reporting to the Public Security Bureau and Public Utilities Bureau, this document is submitted to your bureaus for review and forwarding to the Municipal Government, ordering the Shanghai South District Defense Corps Reorganization Committee to first suspend Wu Rugui and others from their duties and send them to the court for punishment according to law, in order to ensure the safety of business. The urgency of waiting for orders is beyond words. Sincerely submitted to Chen, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Huang, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Shanghai South Public Bus Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>The Municipal Defense Corps Reorganization Committee believes that the details of the Shanghai South Public Bus incident must be investigated clearly before a thorough investigation can be conducted. Committee Chairman Sun Baorong ordered Wang Zhuangfei, the Deputy Commander of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps, and Fan Ju, the Chief Instructor, to go to investigate the details of the incident yesterday. Wang and Fan went to various places to investigate yesterday. However, according to the Caohejing Defense Corps, the report in the newspaper was a misunderstanding. At that time, more than 30 members of the team were all armed and took the bus from Longhua to Shanghai. Although many people wanted to board the bus, the team members said that the bus was limited to 30 passengers by the Public Utilities Bureau, fearing that it would exceed the quota and cause danger due to the small bus and many people. Therefore, they immediately instructed the bus to depart. When the bus arrived at Maogong Bridge, some of the team members got off, while others still intended to go to Shanghai. The driver and ticket collector insisted on turning back to Longhua. The team members were afraid that they would not have enough time, so they fought each other, causing a conflict. This was the actual situation at the time of the incident. After receiving the report, Wang and Fan went to the Second Office of the Sixth District to investigate the details of the incident and learned the details. However, the Public Bus Company and the Defense Corps each held their own views. The two immediately made a detailed report on the information obtained from the investigations and submitted it to Chairman Sun for review, in order to conduct a thorough investigation. It is heard that the Public Bus Company has also submitted a report to the Public Utilities Bureau, requesting strict negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Taihu Bandit Chief Tai Bao A Shu Captured <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Extremely Vicious When Arrested</p>
<p>Savagely Bit the Finger of Detective Gu</p>
<p>His Brother Has Also Been Arrested</p>
<p>Will Be Sent to the Security Team for Review</p>
<p>When the second leader of the Taihu bandits, Sha Zhu Luo A Mei, was arrested in Shanghai on the 25th of last month, information was obtained at the same time that the escaped bandit chief Tai Bao A Shu Xu Tianxiong had also sneaked into Shanghai and was hiding in a rented house near the North Railway Station in the Chinese territory owned by the Qian family. At that time, there were already informants tracking him, and they immediately reported to the First District of the Minhang Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Public Security Team. Director Xu, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Fan Guozhong, the captain of the First Team, to secretly bring more than ten detectives to Shanghai to arrest him. When they arrived near the North Railway Station to ambush him, Xu had already heard the news and escaped an hour earlier. An inspection of all the furnishings in the house showed that they had not been moved, and it was assumed that he must have fled to the Concession. Therefore, a strict search was carried out. Until two days ago, it was discovered that Xu and his brother Fusheng were indeed together in Shanghai, and temporarily used the Huide Lane, Dalian Bay Road, and Huaiyuan Lane as places for contact and communication. Therefore, at around 12:00 noon the day before yesterday, all the detectives gathered at the entrance of the lane to wait. Not long after, Xu swaggered over and was arrested. However, during the arrest, Detective Gu Lansheng's left middle finger and ring finger were savagely bitten by the bandit, almost to the point of being bitten off. He was immediately taken to the Huishan Police Station. After a detailed interrogation by the chief of police, the bandit directly admitted that over the years, he had gathered more than 2,000 followers and repeatedly looted villages and towns in Jin, Ping, Song, Jia, and other places, kidnapped people for ransom, and joined the Red Bandits. He was even falsely appointed by Yan Xishan to disrupt the rear of the National Army and instigate the assassination of maritime detective Sun Huanwen at No. 10 Baoyu Lane in the French Concession. He also confessed that his brother Fusheng was currently hiding in the Central Apartment on Avenue Edward VII. Therefore, the original detectives went to the address and arrested Fusheng. It is heard that they will be transferred to the Second Regiment of the Songjiang Jiangsu Provincial Security Team for review and dealt with together with Sha Zhu Luo A Mei.</p>
<p>According to someone from Songjiang, the news of the arrest of Tai Bao A Shu Xu Tianxiong, the leader of the lake bandits who roamed the four counties of Songjiang, Jinshan, Pinghu, and Jiading, was reported to the Songjiang County Government on the evening of the 5th by Detective Fei Guanqing of the First Team of the Water Police, stating that he had been captured at the entrance of Huiyuanfang, Huade Road, Hongkou, Shanghai, and was now in the Huishan Police Station. After the formalities were completed, he could be sent to Songjiang, etc. According to the detectives who participated in the arrest, Captain Fan Guozhong of the First Team of the Second District of the Water Police, based on a report from a secret agent, after the arrest of Zhu Luo A Mei, Tai Bao A Shu and others were organizing an organization in the Huade Road area, but the location of the building number was not known. Captain Fan immediately gave travel expenses to those who knew Tai Bao A Shu and sent them to Huade Road to rent a room on the first floor of Huiyuanfang, with a window facing the road, where pedestrians could be seen. They stayed there to observe. Sure enough, at around 12:00 noon on the 5th, Gu Lansheng saw Tai Bao A Shu walking on the road, and realized that the time had come. He immediately exchanged glances with the detectives ambushing at the entrance of the lane. Gu Lansheng directly called out his name, asked him where he was going, and went up to arrest him. A Shu fiercely bit Gu's finger. Gu endured the pain and refused to let go, calling for more people to surround him. The police heard the sound and rushed over. Tai Bao A Shu tried to bribe the police with the banknotes he had on him, but the Western police had already arrived, so he was taken to the Huishan Police Station. At this point, Tai Bao A Shu's attitude became calm. He asked the police for tea and dishes. During the interrogation, he confessed that he was 29 years old, from Liujia Yanqiao, Jinshan. In the past, he was appointed by Yan and Feng to disrupt the rear. If they had not failed, we would all be in important positions. On the 14th of the first month, he disguised himself as a villager and broke out of the encirclement. After smoking opium at Jinshanwei, he hired a sampan and went by sea to Bailonggang to land, took a long-distance bus to Shanghai, and asked where his residence in Shanghai was. He said that he had a wife everywhere, so he had a home everywhere. Now that I have been arrested, what is the point of asking about my home? Then, Director Xu and Captain Fan Guozhong asked him if he had paid someone to assassinate us. He replied that it might have happened, and said that this place was just a temporary residence and there was no need to ask in detail. The maritime detective also learned that Tai Bao A Shu's brother, Xu Fusheng, was suffering from inguinal lymphadenitis and was hiding in the Central Apartment on Avenue Edward VII. Therefore, they went to arrest him and learned where the guns were hidden. In addition to sending people to the location he provided to seize the weapons, Director Xu and others planned to bring him back to the case. It is heard that the detectives who were guarding the scene included Fei Guanqing, Gu Lansheng, Gu Chungeng, Chen Long, etc. After receiving the news here, it is rumored that he will be sent to Songjiang today. Many citizens traveling between the railway station and the wharf hope to see the bandit's face, but it is said that he must first go to the Minhang District Department before he can be sent to Songjiang, so it will not be until tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The bandit leader has been captured, and everyone believes that the day when the bandit scourge will be eliminated is not far away, which is truly a great relief.</p>

After completing his studies, he followed Premier Sun to assist in the revolutionary cause. In the first year of the Republic of China, he served as the Western Secretary of the Nanjing Provisional Government. During the Second Revolution, he was ordered by the Premier to found newspapers such as the China Republican to promote justice and strongly attack the monarchy, which led to the closure of the newspaper by Yuan Shikai, and Mr. Ma was sent abroad. In the United States, he served as the Minister of the American Headquarters of the Kuomintang. When the Guangzhou Extraordinary President was established, he was sent to the United States as a special envoy for foreign affairs and a commercial commissioner. During the Pacific Conference, he served as the plenipotentiary representative of the South. Later, when the Premier served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, preparing for the Northern Expedition, he recruited Mr. Ma back to China to serve as the Secretary of the General Headquarters and Director of External Publicity. When he saw Borodin holding the party affairs and spreading communism, he was one of the first opponents. Not being able to achieve his goals, he traveled in Europe and the United States. Columbia University in the United States hired him as a professor of Chinese. After national unification, the Commander of the Northeast Border Defense Division hired him for his current position.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Reduction of Delays on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Many Effective Dispatching Methods</p>
<p>Recently, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has been experiencing delays due to old locomotives. Therefore, Pacific locomotives have been purchased to improve the situation. First, the Traffic Department ordered the Dispatching Section to carefully study and revise the timetable in consultation with the heads of various Traffic Sections. It has been implemented since April 1. Since the implementation of the new timetable, the speed of the special express trains has increased, the time has been shortened, and there have been fewer delays. Even the slow third and fourth-class trains, which have been delayed for a long time in the past, can arrive on time. It is also heard that the new timetable is very well-arranged, the trains on the way are staggered, and the timing is consistent, so the delays of the trains can be reduced. Moreover, according to the time of each train arranged this time, there is a leading train. If it is delayed for some reason, the following train will never overtake it midway, which can meet the needs of travelers. As for the allocation of locomotives, it is heard that the newly purchased Pacific locomotives will be used for the night special express trains, express trains, and third and fourth-class trains with more carriages, because this type of locomotive has a large towing force, which is very suitable for towing trains with more carriages. The other special express trains are towed by the original C and E-type locomotives with higher speeds, and the number of carriages is limited, so they can travel faster when carrying light loads. In addition, the railway is also making every effort to renovate the roadbed to increase the speed of the train without danger.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Red Pill Organization Cracked Down on Haikou Road <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, there have been more and more people selling red pills secretly in Shanghai. Because of their lower price than opium and their more potent medicinal properties, many smokers abandon opium and prefer red pills. In the future, the spread of their poisonous atmosphere will be even worse than the opium addiction. Although the police have strictly prohibited and investigated, it is difficult to eliminate them. The area around Six Malu has almost become a market for the secret production and sale of red pills. There have been several crackdowns in the past, and these people have become a little more restrained. However, recently they have returned to their original state. The day before yesterday, the Old Zha Police Station secretly dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to House No. 6 on Haikou Road and discovered a red pill manufacturing organization. They seized 127 large and small packages of red pills, along with Wu Amao from Suzhou and Yao Amao from Jiancheng who were selling them. They were detained and sent to the District Court for prosecution in the morning, requesting severe punishment in accordance with Articles 6 and 13 of the Opium Prohibition Law. The defendants Wu and Yao also confessed without denial. Judge Zhou sentenced Wu, the leader, to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 120 yuan. Yao, the helper, was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, and the red pills were confiscated.</p>

<p>On the 20th of last month, at 1:30 PM, several robbers suddenly broke into the home of Sichuan woman Pan Zhangshi at No. 638, Deqing Lane, Mu'er Ming Road, West Shanghai. They brandished handguns and spoke with a Sichuan accent, warning against any outcry. They ransacked the house, turning over boxes and chests, but were still not satisfied. They then went to the back room downstairs, where they robbed the woman Qian Sujun. She was able to shout for help, and they fled. The two women then checked their losses, finding that gold and jewelry worth 880 yuan had been stolen. They reported the incident to the police and requested an investigation. Lang Jintang and Liu Ronggen, Chinese detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, went to investigate. It was discovered that the robbers were hiding in No. 279, Kai Zi'er Road, in the French Concession. They cooperated with French Concession detectives and secretly arrested two robbers: Guo Jing from Hubei and Zhao Tianhua from Sichuan. They recovered some of the stolen jewelry. They then went to No. 159, Ai Duo Ya Road, and arrested two more accomplices: Wei Wenqing and Xiong Binglin from Sichuan. They confiscated an empty leather suitcase. All were taken to the police station and sent to the Special District Local Court the next morning. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, explained the case and requested an extension. Detective Lang also explained the process of solving the case, stating that the fourth defendant, Xiong Binglin, had taken off his old blue cloth robe and put on the stolen silk clothes after the robbery. The robbers packed the stolen goods in a white leather suitcase and hired a car to transport them. The stolen goods were presented as evidence. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confessions, questioned the defendants briefly, and ordered them to be detained for further investigation at a later date.</p>

Most of the names were people from Shandong and Hebei. It is unknown whether the deceased was the eldest or youngest brother. It is expected that his sworn brothers will come forward to claim the body for burial. However, a thorough search for the deceased's relatives has yielded no one to identify him. The incident was reported to prosecutor Yang of the local court, who arrived to conduct an inquest and determined that the death was due to illness. The body was entrusted to a charity for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Discussions on the New Salt Law in the Legislative Yuan - Zhang Peiyan <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, the Legislative Yuan passed the Salt Law, consisting of seven chapters and thirty-nine articles, at its 136th meeting. I deeply understand that the Salt Law is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and I dare not remain silent and complacent, leaving the country with an irreparable disaster. Therefore, I do not wish to engage in empty theoretical debates, but rather to point out the obstacles and defects in fact, to serve as a humble contribution for the authorities to consider. If it is possible to provide assistance in advance, to understand the true situation of salt administration, salt field production, sales, transportation, and storage in our country, to proceed cautiously, and not to apply rigid academic theories to the multifaceted salt affairs, then the Executive Yuan will not lose its dignity in the future, and the country and the people will be spared from danger. This matter concerns the governance of the Republic of China, and it is not to shield or lobby for one or two salt merchants. I earnestly hope that you gentlemen will carefully examine and analyze each article, listed as follows: (1) Salt should be taxed at the field, allowing people to buy and sell freely. The strongest advocate of this view in modern times is Zhang Jian of Nantong, who wrote "Opinions on Reforming the National Salt Law," and argued that for the sake of safeguarding the country and caring for the people, eliminating bandits, it is appropriate to change the salt law. He extensively discussed the adoption of Liu Yan's method of taxing at the field, hoping to achieve a situation where "the former merchant is still a merchant, and the former bandit is also a merchant," etc. When he was an outsider, holding a pen in his hand, he believed that he had thoroughly understood the past and present, grasping the beginning and the end, and found the treasure. He believed that</p>
<p>there was no better law than this. However, when he became a cabinet member in charge of salt administration, why did he not propose to implement it? Close examination of the facts reveals that this is because the ideal is not realistic. Various legal codes must be improved with each era. Liu Yan already implemented taxation at the field. If the law was truly good, then it should have been preserved and not replaced. Why did Wang Xianzhi and Huang Chao both gather crowds and rebel by selling illicit salt before the end of the Li Tang Dynasty? (See "Tang Ji Xizong Qianfu Second Year," note: Liu Yan's precise salt law began in the 14th year of Emperor Daizong's Dali reign and lasted only 95 years until the 2nd year of Emperor Xizong's Qianfu reign.) After the overthrow of the Tang Dynasty, the law was changed and implemented for more than 1,200 years (see Zhang Jian's "Yi Bian Yan Yi"). Although it is said that there is no law that does not become corrupt after a hundred years, the gains and losses, elimination of abuses, and patching of flaws have undergone countless processes. However, I have never heard of a fundamental law being changed because successive generations lacked people who understood finance and cared for the people. The truth is that the Chinese salt law focuses on taxation and adopts a heavy taxation system, taxing hundreds or even two thousand per hundred. If a no-tax system is adopted, any change is acceptable. Otherwise, the national economy is at stake, and production, sales, and transportation are all subject to established laws. Salt farmers and salt merchants each have their history and resources. Once destroyed, the overall network is lost, and both the country and the people suffer. This must be carefully considered. Implementing this new law will inevitably lead to difficulties. I will briefly outline the main points:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the point of taxation at the field: According to the current salt law, salt is taxed first, regardless of whether it is in the field, the embankment, or the mound, and then a permit and transportation ticket are issued. The field has a responsible merchant, the shore has a responsible store, and the transportation has a registered boat. The starting point is filled in on the ticket, and no deviation is allowed. Inspections are conducted, and the system is well-organized with clear lines of authority and few agencies. The tax law is comprehensive. If taxation is at the field, as stipulated in Article 14 of Chapter 3 of the new law, the government should build warehouses and mounds in suitable locations in the salt fields for storing salt. The intention is that all salt produced by salt producers must be stored in government-designated warehouses and mounds in accordance with the provisions. Here are some questions: (1) Except for Sichuan and Yunnan, most salt-producing areas are coastal, and the salt fields are vast, covering thousands of square miles. How many warehouses and mounds should there be? Can they be fully equipped in the shortest possible time? Furthermore, with convenient water and land transportation, what good methods are there to completely block the path of smuggling? (2) For salt that is taxed after being stored in warehouses and mounds, will the water and land field police established in Article 34 of Chapter 6 be as effective as the field merchants in managing their stoves and investigating private sales with relevance and integrity? (3) Beach households, stove households, and board households are all poor people who want to get a price for their salt as soon as they have it. If the provisions of Article 23 of Chapter 4 of the new law are followed, the total amount of salt stored by salt producers should be allocated according to their annual production ratio. This means that salt producers must wait until a year later to get a price for their salt. Otherwise, it will be impossible to obtain their annual production ratio. How can poor people who have no surplus grain wait? Furthermore, taking five tons as the standard, all those who produce less than five tons have the priority to sell first. This means that those who are lazy and produce less have the priority, while those who are diligent and produce more are in a disadvantaged position. This is not a way to increase production and even encourages laziness. Not only that, but each field has hundreds or thousands of beach households, stove households, and board households. Should the salt of each household be divided into piles or gathered into a pile? If divided into piles, will there be enough space? If gathered into a pile, how will they be distinguished by household when sold in the future? How will they be distinguished as first-class or second-class salt? Furthermore, once the beach households, stove households, and board households have weighed and handed over their salt to the warehouse, will the tax officials provide insurance in case of natural disasters or man-made calamities? Since the date of salt sales varies, how will the differences in brine consumption be handled? Considering the interests of the salt farmers, storing salt in warehouses and mounds is troublesome and does not provide immediate cash to alleviate poverty. It is better to sit and sell privately, which is simpler and more convenient. Which would they prefer?</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the point of free buying and selling by the people: Under the current salt law, the people are not free, and merchants have no freedom. According to the current salt law, field merchants have the responsibility to provide funds for collection and storage, stove production has a designated merchant, and food households have a store for storage and supply. The purchase price and selling price are all determined by the government. Therefore, even if production is high, salt producers do not feel that their production is unsalable. Even if production is insufficient, food households do not feel that their food is particularly expensive. Even in poor rural areas and places with extremely difficult transportation, food households do not lack salt to eat. If the new law is followed, there will be no merchants, and the word "people" will include a very broad range. Allowing free buying and selling will raise questions. Are beach households, stove households, and board households people? Can they freely buy and sell? After taxation at the field, if free buying and selling are allowed, will there be no restrictions on the area? After taxation, will there still be restrictions on the salt leaving the field? Will it still be free? Furthermore, since there is no designated merchant, there is no responsible person. What methods can be used to restrict it? If free buying and selling are still subject to area and time limits specified on the tax ticket, then it will not be free. If there are no limits, there will be countless problems. Since it is free buying and selling, those who profit will continue to operate without encouragement, and those who suffer losses will be allowed to close down. If there is a salt shortage in area A, will sellers be allowed to raise prices? If there is a salt surplus in area B, will sellers be allowed to lower prices? In areas with convenient transportation, there will be many speculators, and will there be problems of congestion and losses? In areas with difficult transportation, will transporters be reluctant, and will food households suffer from a lack of salt? If grain is in short supply, one can still catch sparrows, dig for rats, and use grass roots and tree bark to fill the stomach. But what can replace salt if there is a salt shortage? Liu Yan's method was to store official salt in distant areas between the Yangtze and Lingnan. If merchants were cut off and salt was expensive, the price was reduced to stabilize the price. Can the government now establish stabilized-price warehouses everywhere?</p>
<p>(C) Regarding the point of reducing the tax to five yuan per 100 kilograms uniformly: Converted to the sima scale, 100 jin is equivalent to 3 yuan, 1 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li plus some change. Salt is a daily necessity for the people and should be tax-free, just like rice and beans. In the past, it was said that the state cannot do without government expenses and therefore cannot avoid taxation. Also, the people's burden should be shared universally. But salt is less than food, and the production area is smaller than the grain-producing area. It is easy to manage because of its smallness, and it does not overburden the people. Therefore, abandoning grain tax in favor of salt tax is also a last resort. Today, the salt tax and surtax are heavy and extreme. Who would not want a reduction? But considering the state's budgetary situation, the good policy of a one-cent reduction in the likin tax has just been implemented. The financial difficulties of the central and local governments and the disputes over compensation have caused widespread unrest. After a sudden reduction in the salt tax, as well as the various tax exemptions for industrial and agricultural use of salt stipulated in Articles 6 and 7 of Chapter 1 of the new law, the leakage and abuses will be numerous. The central government will lose tens of millions of yuan in revenue each year, which is to be expected. In addition, various surcharges also generate an income of over 10,000 yuan each year. If these are all exempted, the total amount will probably be no less than 10 to several 10,000 yuan. How will this be supported? What methods will be used to compensate? Who will be responsible? This is something that those in power cannot ignore.</p>
<p>(D) Regarding the point of not allowing the sale of salt that does not meet standards and the implementation of discoloration and denaturation: Improving salt production is a natural principle of evolution and hygiene. It is acceptable to apply a gradual method to promote improvement. However, if the provisions of Article 4 of Chapter 1 of the new law are followed, salt containing 90% or more sodium chloride is considered first-class salt, and salt containing 85% or more sodium chloride is considered second-class salt. First-class salt should not contain more than 5% moisture, and second-class salt should not contain more than 8% moisture. This provision is somewhat presumptuous. Even in Japan, where science is advanced, the salt law stipulates that the sodium chloride content is divided into five grades, with the lowest being 70% or more and the highest being 90% or more. But in China, where science is backward, the grade and content are attempting to surpass Japan. The theory may be lofty, but how can the facts be difficult to implement? Furthermore, from a hygiene perspective, unclean impurities may be detrimental to hygiene, but what does moisture have to do with hygiene? Otherwise, water content will also be regulated when making ink. Also, salt containing magnesium is most likely to absorb moisture, and the seasons and weather are different. This is a natural chemical effect and not the fault of salt farmers and merchants. If this is implemented, then most of the salt already produced and not yet produced in each province will be unqualified and will have to be used entirely for fisheries, industry, and agriculture. However, fisheries, industry, and agriculture do not need such a large amount. Salt farmers rely on this for a living, so how will the government deal with this? Also, if the provisions of Article 18 of Chapter 3 of the new law are followed, salt that does not meet food salt standards should be stored separately for use in fisheries, industry, and agriculture, or the original producers should be ordered to re-produce it. I am afraid that salt farmers will admit that their salt does not meet the standards, not send it to the warehouses and mounds, and sell it all privately before being prohibited from selling it. If the law is not enforced on the masses, how will the government deal with it? Salt eaters are not all experts in hygiene; they only care about the salty taste and the cheap price. If the provisions of Article 29 of Chapter 5 of the new law are followed, and salt by-products such as bitter brine, brine blocks, brine nitrate crystals, alkali cakes, etc., are all tax-exempt, then any kind of by-product can be mixed with water and re-produced into salt. Anyone can take advantage of this, purchase these by-products to replace food salt, and what will become of the national salt tax? European and American countries either adopt a no-tax system or a light-tax system, so after discoloration and denaturation, they use heavy leaching and re-production procedures. The cost is not worthwhile, and there are very few abuses. The Chinese salt tax is particularly heavy, so even after discoloration and denaturation, it can be re-leached and re-produced after being transported out due to the tax exemption (the cost is still heavy at over three yuan per dan). Furthermore, Article 27 of Chapter 5 of the new law has a flexible method of not implementing discoloration and denaturation, which can be used for private gain. How can guarantees or deposits prevent abuses?</p>
<p>(E) Regarding the point of abolishing fields with low production, poor quality, and excessive costs in an appropriate manner: Eliminating salt fields through artificial means rather than natural means will not be effective. For example, the Liuzhuang field in Huaian has been abolished for many years because it is isolated from the sea, but private production continues as before. As for the coastal fields, although there were previously announcements of gradual abolition over five years and closure over three years, they have never been eliminated. Even in fields that have already been abolished, private production has risen, and the output is even greater than before abolition. This is clear. Smoke continues, and cooking stoves continue to burn. Everyone and every place has the means, and everyone and every place can produce salt and sell it privately. So, how can they be eliminated? In reality, it only facilitates private production and private sales.</p>
<p>(F) Regarding the point of the government limiting production based on the salt production situation to avoid overproduction: The salt production situation, like agriculture, depends on the weather. Whether salt production is excessive should also depend on sales. If restrictions are added, will abundance be suppressed to make it scarce, and will scarcity be forced to make it abundant? Will beach households, stove households, and board households be ordered to shut down and change careers after abundance, and can they be recruited at will after scarcity? Salt production is the livelihood of beach households, stove households, and board households, and they are familiar with the profits of salt production and private sales, which are a matter of life and death. Can they be tamed to this extent? Furthermore, the coastal salt fields east of the production area are boundless. If there is an abundant harvest, will it be abandoned on the ground or thrown into the sea? Otherwise, with higher costs and rail and water transportation available, only concentration will be seen, and no surplus will be seen. But the salt from Huai and Zhejiang, with high costs and long-distance transportation, will only be seen as excessive. Is there a plan to give all the benefits of the world to eastern Lu? Can the hundreds of thousands of beach households, stove households, and board households in Huai and Zhejiang and those who depend on them for a living be allowed to lose their jobs, cut off their livelihoods, and affect local security?</p>
<p>(G) Regarding the fact that the restrictions on production do not apply to refined salt companies, and even those who are re-refined are not subject to warehouse and mound restrictions, although it is said that taxes have already been paid for collection and release of salt, it cannot be unrelated. The unequal treatment clearly shows favoritism. The emergence of refined salt was to resist the import of foreign salt and was only allowed to be sold in commercial ports. If it infiltrated the interior, it would be considered private sales. The old law was very fair, but the companies thought it was inconvenient and clamored everywhere, promoting the abolition of the lead and free buying and selling every day. Now the Legislative Yuan holds this view. There are now more than ten companies, with a salt production volume of tens of thousands of dan. For example, Yongyu alone has a production quota of 1.5 million dan. If the lead is abolished, each company will expand greatly and emerge in succession. Only a dozen or so companies can monopolize the country's salt sales of 25 million dan. Northern salt is cheap and can be used to make salt, while southern salt is expensive and will inevitably use brine to make salt. The livelihoods of millions of salt farmers in the south will inevitably be seized by refined salt. Why is our government so generous to the dozen or so refined salt companies and so stingy to millions of salt farmers? This is truly baffling.</p>
<p>The above are just a few points to offer for study. If all questions have sufficient responses and solutions, then a reformist approach can be adopted and implemented resolutely. If there are no sufficient responses and solutions, then it is better to proceed cautiously, as a single mistake will be difficult to recover, harm the country and the people, and cause great damage, unlike other orders that can be easily reversed and remedied.</p>

<p>To the editor: I recently read a report in your newspaper's local news column stating that members of our regiment's first squad beat a ticket seller. This is inconsistent with the facts. I have recorded the actual situation at the time as reported by Wu Rugui, the captain of the first squad, and submit it as follows for your information: Yesterday afternoon, members of my squad wore uniforms and attended practice on time. After the practice, they dispersed and returned home. Some members had business in Shanghai and happened to take the Shanghai-Nanhui bus together. In accordance with the regiment's instructions, they purchased half-price tickets one by one. There were about thirty people at the time, and the Public Utility Bureau's regulation limited the capacity to twenty-eight people, so of course the limit could not be exceeded. The squad members and passengers already numbered over thirty, so there was a declaration restricting passengers to prevent danger, and there was no forced occupation. This is a clear fact. When the bus reached Maogong Bridge Station, a small number of squad members got off. The remaining members needed to go to Ximen, but the bus turned back to Longhua from the middle of the road near Jinji Road. According to the regulations of the No. 2 bus, the route runs from Ximen to Longhua and then from Longhua to Ximen. Of course, it cannot turn back halfway. This violated the company's regulations and deliberately made things difficult for the squad members. The members who wanted to go to Ximen did not reach their destination, so they inquired and asked the bus to go to Ximen in accordance with the regulations, which led to an argument. Upon hearing this, I immediately informed the members to return to the headquarters and wait for a resolution. The bus continued to run as usual without stopping, and there was no disturbance of order. The reports in the newspapers are inconsistent with the facts. I am reporting the facts and request that your newspaper correct the inaccurate reports to clarify the truth and avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Yang Xinzheng, Regiment Commander, Jing District Security Regiment</p>

<h3 id="e178">Mourning Mr. Fan Shan <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Watch Cloud Tower Master</p>
<p>The passing of Mr. Fan Shan is deeply mourned by those who knew him and those who did not. I never met Mr. Fan Shan in person, but we corresponded frequently with poems. Mr. Fan Shan said my poems were clear and elegant, without the unintelligible language of modern poets, and he often praised them in front of his poet friends, which made me feel ashamed and grateful. I once wanted to call upon Mr. Fan Shan, introduced by Mr. Chen Yong'an, the Secretary of the Board from Guizhou, but Mr. Fan Shan politely declined, saying he would have his female disciple, Li Guifen, ask me about calligraphy. However, whenever I had questions, Mr. Fan Shan would explain them in detail, without acting as a teacher.</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Shan enjoyed listening to opera and his enthusiasm did not wane with age. Female opera singers from Tianjin visited him. Mr. Fan Shan knew that I also enjoyed listening to opera, so he introduced Li Guifen, Huiqin, Xue Yanqin, and others to me in letters when they came south, asking me to promote them. However, when Xin Yanqiu and Li Huiqin came to Shanghai last winter, I was bedridden and unable to write, so I only sent a message to wish them well. When Yanqiu returned north, she invited me to go with her, but I was too busy with matters in Shanghai. I planned to fulfill my wish this spring. If I had known this would happen, I would have gone north with Yanqiu at the end of the year and had a chance to meet Mr. Fan Shan. Now it is too late. How sad!</p>
<p>Last year, a Shanghai tabloid mistakenly reported the news of Mr. Fan Shan's death. At that time, Xue Yanqin had not been in Shanghai for long, and Mr. Fan Shan still wrote a letter to introduce her. So when I read the report, I was half in disbelief. Later, I wrote to the poet Cao Jiheng in Beijing and learned that it was not true. Mr. Fan Shan said that he had encountered this kind of strange rumor twice in his life. Last year was the third time. Mr. Yang Yunshi wrote an elegy for Mr. Fan Shan, for which Mr. Fan Shan was very grateful. When I received Mr. Heng's letter, I was happy that Mr. Fan Shan was not ashamed and had no health problems, so I also wrote a poem: "The news of the fall of the Old Man Star is on the newspaper, the message is half believed. Just see the high singing, full of enthusiasm, as if the living elegy does not seek poetry. Haiyun is happy to get a letter of peace, and the world will always keep the wonderful words. Countless thousands of miles from Jibei Jiangnan, a small heart remotely sent to the bright moon."</p>
<p>Guifen told me that Mr. Fan Shan looked clear and refined, like a man in his sixties. He liked to sniff snuff, and his mustache was always stained with the color of snuff. His fingers were not very clean either. It is generally the case that scholars do not pay attention to their appearance. Mr. Fan Shan's bedroom was full of books, in a chaotic state. However, Mr. Fan Shan had a strong memory and could easily find the books he needed. Therefore, he did not allow his family to organize this pile of books, because after organizing them, it would be inconvenient to find them.</p>
<p>After Mr. Fan Shan's death, young people made presumptuous comments on his poetry. Regardless of praise or criticism, they are not worth taking seriously. In short, Mr. Fan Shan's poetry and lyrics formed his own style, comparable to his predecessors. His poem discussing poetry with Zuo Huqing shows his approach to poetry, which cannot be dreamed of by shallow scholars. The poem says: "Don't you see Lanzi's seven swords in both hands, five of which are always in the air. Skilled hands can use emptiness to operate reality, opening the chaos into exquisite beauty. Don't you see Shanfu planting flowers in Lihua Palace, the colors of ten thousand flowers are not the same. Ingenious hands can use plainness to create splendor, making the desolate return to spring. Military strategists use few to overcome many, politicians use light to lift heavy. Taoists use stillness to control movement, poets use uniqueness to overcome the common. Able to say what others cannot say, like a mountain revealing its spirit without concealment. Able to complete what others cannot complete, like the moon hanging in the sky on the fifteenth day. A hundred buckets will not exhaust the spring at the bottom of the well, and burning will not extinguish the incense. A hundred flowers are brewed into a bottle of wine, and a hundred medicines are refined into a pill. Take the sweetness of the five flavors, the freshness of the five colors, and the harmony of the five sounds. Only the appearance is not uniquely beautiful. Take it from Du Su, the foundation is solid. Take it from Bai Lu, the courtyard is wide. Take it from Wen Li, the thoughts are abundant. Take it from Huang Chen, the profound is penetrated. Words have substance, filling the cake. Cut it into a picture, weaving on the loom. See it without a trace, like salt in water. Release it and it flies, like a sword in a box. Without intention, how can you create a classic? Without a pen, how can you command ten thousand spirits? Without talent, how can you gather heroes? Without learning, how can you achieve old age? Without law, what is a ruler? Without cause, what is weight? If one word is not safe, everyone will criticize it. Who cannot be attacked from all sides? Old Hu Zaoyan challenged yesterday, intending to follow Han Tong's changes. More than sixty years of poor life, I will use the dragon-carving debate for you. The forest of poetry is a hundred feet pole, and the progress of the elderly is like that of the young. Those who learn from me will die, it is not so. If my words are true, poetry will be immortal."</p>
<h3 id="e179">New Construction in Suzhou Park <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Planning</p>
<p>Suzhou Park was rebuilt on the old site of the abandoned Prince's mansion in the city. It has been four years since its establishment. There are two teahouses on either side of the fountain in the south, called East Study and West Pavilion. North of the West Pavilion is the movie theater. Tourists gather here. The northern area is twice the size of the southern area, but no one goes there because of the weeds. When the former Rain King Yincai was the chief host of the Suzhou Municipal Preparatory Office, he planned to find a way to develop it, but he failed due to lack of funds. Now, Chief Huang Shen, the county magistrate, has allocated funds to dig a pond in the open space north of the library for lotuses. The excavated mud is piled on the banks of the pond, with more than a hundred peach and willow trees planted on top, and rocks are piled up to form a small mountain. There is an open space left on top to build a house. This work has now been completed. Therefore, the number of tourists in the north has recently been no less than that in the south.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Strange Records of Childbirth <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xufan</p>
<p>Difficult births of monstrous fetuses are often heard of. Families who give birth to them often consider them unlucky. If they die, they are buried and forgotten. If they live, they are abandoned to die. This rarely provides an opportunity for physiological research. The second daughter of a neighboring Yin family married Kang Sanguan of Cangqiao, Songjiang. For ten years, Kang has been hoping to have a child, but has been disappointed. Now, fortunately, she is six months pregnant. On March 9, she suddenly felt unusually abdominal pain. Counting the pregnancy period, it has been more than two months. She quickly hired a midwife to prepare everything. After a day and night, she finally gave birth. The baby was born buttocks first, which is called "sitting horse birth". This type of difficult birth is very dangerous. After more than an hour, the baby fell to the ground with a cry. Looking at it, it was a unicorn. They were very happy. The child's head was as big as a child's, and its hands were very long, reaching past its knees. There was a dimple on its back, like Meng's. At first, they were even happier because of its strange appearance. After bathing its whole body, they lifted its lip and saw two incisors. Touching it, it chirped like a bird, unable to cry. Sanguan was surprised. His wife was very angry, suspecting it was a monster. She threw it to the ground, and its face slowly turned blue. Kang's elderly mother was eager to have a grandchild and could not bear to abandon it. She quickly carried it to the bed, and its face turned from blue to reddish-brown. Just as she was about to see what was going on, within two hours, teeth grew all over its mouth. Kang's wife was even more panicked, fearing that a great disaster was about to befall them, and the whole family was in an uproar. The ignorant elders in the neighborhood added fuel to the fire, saying it was a monster. Kang's mother also lost her mind. As a result, they abandoned it in the Cangqiao River. It is said that the mother is now critically ill.</p>
<h3 id="e181">New Inventions for Waste Utilization <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Frugal Father</p>
<p>The study of calligraphy relies entirely on copying. Recently, paper has become expensive, making it uneconomical to buy paper for calligraphy practice. Furthermore, thin paper is easily torn when inked, making it difficult to reuse. If discarded casually, it would violate the principle of cherishing resources. Now there is a way to solve this problem, which is to use newspapers for copying. When I was teaching in Ping'a, I subscribed to several Shanghai newspapers for browsing. Whenever I practiced calligraphy, I used newspapers as trial paper. Because newspaper paper is thicker, ink does not easily bleed through the back, allowing for repeated copying. After writing, expose it to the sun to dry. After the ink is dry, fold and sell it. Compared to the market price, it is not much less. I have also tried this with my students, and it has been effective. Those who share the same hobby, why not try it?</p>
<p>Recently, German-style "Phoebus" gas stoves have become essential items for home and travel. However, the rubber on the gas needle often shrinks and hardens due to prolonged heat exposure, causing the gas to lose its effectiveness. Users are bothered by this. Although the retailer can replace it, it costs four or five cents and does not last long. Recently, I found a method that has proven effective. The method is to use an old, broken shoe sole (rubber or plastic soles are not suitable). Use a sharp blade to cut it thin and cut out a circular piece. Cut a slit in the middle. Force it onto the tip of the needle. Then tighten the screw and fold the leather forward. Use your hands to tightly insert it into the cylinder and pull it back and forth a few times, and it will be in place. This method does not require any cost and is durable. Once tested, you will know that my words are not wrong.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Wu Ziyu's Voice of Going Abroad <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>General Wu Ziyu of Penglai, believing in military force, has retreated to Jigong Mountain since his defeat at Yuguan in the thirteenth year. Then to Luoyang, then to Nanyang. In the end, as the National Army unified the north and south, he fled into the Wushan Mountains for seven or eight years. He once disguised himself as a monk and twice attempted suicide. The end of a hero is truly sad and difficult. The people of the country despise him for his undying ambition, but many admire him for not seeking refuge with foreigners. Now, it is reported that the General will go abroad. He sent an envoy to Beijing, requesting to go under the guise of investigation, and wanting 100,000 gold to strengthen his journey. The National Government is also broad-minded, and there is talk of granting his request. Then the General will soon travel across the ocean to take a look at the new world overseas and breathe the new air of the world. However, according to what visitors from Sichuan have said, Wu does not seem to want to be an overseas passerby, but wants to be a resident on the edge of the sea. Friends from Sichuan said that Wu lives in the Wen Tianxiang Shrine in Xuanhan, relying on Liu Cunhou's monthly allowance of 2,000 gold for living expenses. In recent years, there have been many disturbances in Sichuan, and officials and civilians alike are in difficult circumstances. Liu's assistance is always in danger of being stopped at any time. Although Liu could not bear to issue an eviction order, Wu ultimately felt that it was not a long-term plan to live under someone else's roof. Many of his followers had given up hope for the future and were scattered. He felt that he could not stay here for a day. Last year, he wrote to Sun, a trusted acquaintance in Shanghai, saying that Sichuan was difficult, and it was useless to stay. It was better to return to his hometown than to die in a foreign land. Please tell Penglai to repair his thatched cottage immediately, just needing a few thatched houses to provide a place to live and read in his old age, which would be enough. At the end of the letter, he also included a poem, which said: "I search for my old residence in the fragrance of winter wine, how are the dreams of the past? After twenty years of iron horses, I return to the remaining years of my life, reading books in the remaining water and mountains." His letter and poem were all aimed at returning home, but today's newspaper reports say otherwise. I think that going abroad and returning home are both paths of self-awareness, but returning home after going abroad is even more advisable. Does the General agree?</p>

<h3 id="e183">Travels in India (16) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Tigers, leopards, rhinoceroses, and elephants are all produced in India, but Ceylon produces especially many elephants. Snakes of all kinds are found everywhere in India. Their customs include worshiping elephants, lions, and snakes. White horses are often seen. I remember that in the time of Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty, Buddhist scriptures first came to China, carried by white horses to the Eastern Capital. Therefore, Luoyang has the White Horse Temple. I don't know if this temple still exists today. It shows that India has had white horses since ancient times. I came to India and saw a large white bullock cart and a white horse. It made me think of the book "Journey to the West." Although it is absurd, it seems to have some basis. It narrates Tang Sanzang's journey to the Western Paradise to obtain scriptures, with Pigsy, White Dragon Horse, Sand Monk, and Monkey King. Now, facts prove it. White horses carried scriptures. India still has white horses today. This is a fact. Pigsy passed through Muslim countries on his way to India. Muslims abstain from pork, hence the name. Sand Monk is a novice monk. Monkey King is the name of a monkey. Today, there are many people playing with monkeys on the streets of India. It can be seen that the author of "Journey to the West" did not completely fabricate it and should not be taken lightly. Also, the "evil demon king" is also reasonable. The Three Thousand Buddhas Sutra has the title of Bull King Buddha, which was said by the Buddha. Indians worship cattle and often decorate them with brocade. The large horns of the cattle are also very beautiful. Also, the cattle resemble camels, with high, protruding humps under their necks, which is different from China. Calling them "demon kings" is not without reason. As for the "Land of Women," it is even more of a fact. Java and other places were still female kingdoms in the Yuan Dynasty. Qinghai, Tibet, and Burma still have women today. It is just that the novel naturally embellishes its words. Also, the mention of passing through flames refers to the many volcanoes in various places today. From this, it can be proved that ancient books should not be regarded as absurd in general. They should have a considerable basis and then be embellished to create interesting texts.</p>
<p>Indian chickens, cats, and dogs are generally no different. However, I remember often hearing my mother say that Tang Sanzang brought cats to China to open the way for the Daoist priest. The Daoist priest said that China must have had cats before the Tang Dynasty. But Tang Dynasty poetry does not seem to have the word "cat." The ancient "Book of Songs" says, "There are cats and tigers." Interpreters refer to tigers as large beasts, not small cats. Then, perhaps the saying that cats came from the West is not entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>I happened to see a donkey on a Chinese street. I don't know if it was brought by the Chinese or if India has them. I will have to inquire.</p>
<p>Indians abstain from killing many mice. There are eagles all over the sky in Calcutta, but they are not seen caring about them. I often believe in Confucius's teaching that "Are humans inferior to birds?" After investigating in all aspects, the morality of birds is always higher than that of beasts. And humans are mammals, so their inferiority to birds is also due to something. I saw someone selling parrots and asked the price. One small parrot costs 15 yuan, and another costs 200 yuan. This is probably because the cost of living is high here.</p>
<p>Recently, I asked an Indian friend, and he said that there are many donkeys in India, which is not surprising. I obtained this evidence and proved it. First, it proves that donkeys can still be freely raised in tropical India. Second, I remember reading Spencer's diary, in which he said that he rode a donkey in Egypt. In ancient times, Jesus often rode a donkey in Judah. Then the donkey species from India to Egypt can all survive. Why do the people of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou tell me that donkey hooves are thin and cannot withstand heat and cannot be raised? It is probably because the sages spread the donkey species. It is not easy to prove a small thing. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's theory of "knowing is difficult and doing is easy" is valuable. I hope that the people of the south will quickly raise more donkeys to increase production, so that the burden on the people's shoulders can be lightened.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn Market Extremely Firm <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The standard cotton yarn market was closed due to the Qingming Festival. However, there were some spot transactions in the market. Most of the futures market was closed, without any target. Everyone was indifferent to negotiations. Therefore, there were few attendees. However, some people had the intention to buy, but the holders were unwilling to sell. Therefore, people's hearts were firm. Except for the selling price of fine yarn, which rose by two or three outside on Saturday and Sunday, the market was extremely firm. Coarse yarn also rose. It is expected that the standard yarn market tomorrow will not change greatly if the overseas situation is difficult to change, or there may be a tendency to rise. The prices of existing yarns are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market was still unattended. However, after the market gradually moved down, local villagers and overseas Cantonese Chinese in Shanghai all tried to handle it. This was because they replaced the foreign Ke Xian downstream. However, the owners were unwilling to devalue again due to the high cost, so the number of transactions was still difficult to be strong. Yesterday, the general market was sold by Guangdong merchants such as Rice Store for 310 bags of Jiangxi Ji Wan at a price of 11 yuan, 2 jiao and 7 fen, and 70 bags of red late rice at a price of 10 yuan and 5 jiao. Local villagers bought 150 bags of Nanjing Liu Rice Wei at a price of 9 yuan, 6 jiao and 9 fen to 9 yuan and 6 jiao. There were no other transactions. Ke Xian only had more from the train route. There were also a small number of foreign rice imports, but they were all transshipped to other ports.</p>

<p>Taiyuan Ice Opened Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market received telegrams from the producing areas. There were still few telegrams. In the market marked by the guild, all sugars were very popular, and the transactions were very prosperous.

The supply of households in the latter market turned scarce, and the market was very beautiful. No. 20 Shasha white was priced at 9 taels and 7 qian and a half.

<p>Recently, the weather has warmed up, and those with insufficient identity have softened. The market is extremely sluggish, so the market price is gradually moving. Those with more stocks in each industry are losing money. Yesterday, the market sold Zhuang Pai cakes for 4 taels, Zhuang Qing cakes for 3 taels and 2 qian, and the grades varied. Although the market price is already low, due to seasonal reasons, it is easy to spoil if it is left for a long time, so the future market is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<h3 id="e192">The Jinda Cycling Tour Group Undertakes a 1,500-Li Journey <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Rui</p>
<p>It was about a week ago that Jinan University students were excitedly discussing the upcoming spring break, pondering how to spend their leisure time. Some thought, "A short trip nearby would be convenient," while others thought, "A long trip involving mountain climbing and wading through rivers would broaden my horizons." Therefore, the destinations decided upon by the students varied. Naturally, some were going to Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, or Nanxiang.</p>
<p>However, some students believed that traveling by boat or train was monotonous and uninteresting, lacking the true meaning of travel. They also felt that young people should possess a brave and vibrant spirit and strive for "constant progress and self-improvement." So they organized a free tour group, with a route from Shanghai to Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and then Nanjing. From Nanjing, they would then go to Hangzhou, Ningbo, Zhenhai, Putuo Mountain, and return to Shanghai. The journey would be a full 1,500 li and would require about two weeks.</p>
<p>But their tour group could also be called a "ten-person group," because the tour group was made up of only ten experienced cyclists, with no accompanying staff. So their clothing, food, lodging, and transportation were entirely self-managed. Furthermore, the amount subsidized by the school was not large, so their 1,500-li journey, though not as grand and magnificent as the previous journeys of children walking to Nanyang and the Northeast, their spirit of bravery and vigor was worthy of being mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Letter to the Youth Corner <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Editor,</p>
<p>This manuscript is my first offering. Please publish it and don't set it aside, lest I be greatly disappointed. That would be very pitiful. Please forgive me for my poor writing, because my level is very low. I won't say much more. Wishing you literary peace. [Signed] Bei Chan</p>
<p>Suffering</p>
<p>Poor her, her brows are furrowed all day long, as if she has many worries. She always sleeps in that dark little room. Sometimes she doesn't know what she is thinking, and she grasps a pen and starts to write. But when she gets halfway, she stops writing. She reads it from the beginning and then tears it up with a "whoosh" and throws it into the wastepaper basket. Sometimes others piece together her torn paper to look at it. It is always a lament of fate, a sigh of bitterness.</p>
<p>Her mother is a tyrant in the family, lying in bed all day, scolding almost from morning until she sleeps. Hearing this hateful sound in her ears is like being cut by knives. Endless sorrows, strand by strand, float in her heart. Tears stream down her face. Her lover is economically weak. Although he pities her and understands her in every way, he cannot satisfy her vain mother. Unable to please her elders, she naturally cannot achieve her free love and marriage. Poor her, she cannot disobey her mother, and she has much attachment to her lover. Such a situation easily leads her to be pessimistic. She wants to be self-reliant, but she has no introducer and no skills to apply for jobs. She stays in the dark family, with no hope of getting out. Poor her, living this kind of life, she sheds countless tears every day. Sometimes her mother even says that she is useless, just sitting at home eating. In fact, this kind of woman is the most tormented. She has no ability to be independent, and no ability to talk about civilization and freedom. Her weak soul is like being tossed by a whirlwind. She has no heart to read, and no one to share her sorrows with. The so-called lover cannot have a frank conversation with her or go out to see movies. She has hardly any means of amusement to eliminate her worries. Her mother does not have a single word of sympathy for her, only unintentional scolding. There are also ignorant people nearby who laugh at them and fabricate bad things about her in front of her mother, making her even more sad.</p>

<p>The night before last, I lost a paper package in Zhabei, containing a donation book for the Shanghai Political and Legal College Guangming Society, numbers 16 to 30, and three letters. If anyone has found it, please return it, and I will be eternally grateful (please forward the item to the Youth Corner Editorial Department of this newspaper). Furthermore, the donation book has already been cancelled with the Guangming Society. I hope that all sectors will pay attention. Respectfully, Li Chunsen, April 6th.</p>
