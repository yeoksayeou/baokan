<p>本刊旨趣</p>
<p>最近萬寳山及朝鮮慘案發生以後，凡有血氣，同深憤慨，咸認經濟絶交爲制其死命之最良辦法，經濟絶交，當以提倡國貨爲對象，本會旣爲國貨工廠之集團，爰即組織國貨證明廣告以資識别，值此國人一致反日聲中，正我國貨界推銷國貨之良機，凡倡導國貨者，幸勿漠視，各地反日同志，請勿誤會，以利國貨之推行，而收抵制之實效，此本刋組織之旨趣也，是爲啟，</p>

<p>事業的發展，雖需資本，與精良之機械，欲求廉美之出品，營業上方得順利的進行，可是缺乏人才，總無辦法，人才充足以後，則資本機械等等均有辦法，出品當然精良，營業當然發達，故人才爲工業之前提人才果缺乏乎，以我國辦敎育三十年，造就之人才，不可謂少，歷年來自東西洋歸國之留學生，更不可謂不多，試問貢獻于社會者多少，以其所學用之于國貨事業者多少，一方興才難之歎，一方無用武之方，惟其供求兩方之不易接觸，致國貨不易收其效，人才不易顯其能，此爲社會之大損失，中國企業之不振，未始不由于此，際此反日聲中，創製與仿造爲急不容緩之舉，近二十年來，倡言經濟絶交者凡九次，其成效爲何如乎，一言以蔽之曰，具有眞才者，未獲佳機會耳，今若急起直追，奮起精神，或可收效于微末，有志靑年，具一技之長，願效忠于社會，此其時矣，本會一方面發展國貨事業，一方面重視專門人才起見，因有徵求之舉，藉爲雙方之紹介，希望懐才未遇之同志，與具有專長之眞才，惠然肯來，爲國貨事業謀貢獻、即爲社會闢無盡之利，區區之意，願以諗諸海内外之同志　，</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>可怪可怕的植物</p>
<p>美國施密司學院Smithsonian　Institute的甘立泊博士。Dr·Killip曾率領科學家多人。前往南美洲阿美仁Amazon河上流與秘魯Peru的山中採集植物標本。含辛茹苦。百折不回。得到了異常美滿的成績。去年二月間。回到華盛頓。帶來奇奇怪怪形形色色的植物。不下三萬種之多。有的可以殺人。有的可以引起怪夢。有的可以使魚類麻痺而魚肉依然可食。其中有數千種都是前人所從未發見。而不知它的名稱的。其中如阿耶烏西Ayahuasce藤一種。又名開必。Caap紅種藥劑師就把這藤製成藥品。服了能使人的神經起劇烈的反動。又有一種植物。産生乳汁似的毒藥。富有麻醉性。紅種人捕魚時。就將這種毒藥倒在河中。任是怎樣廣大的河面霎時間可使魚類都麻痺起來。漸漸的動彈不得。於是漁翁得利。很容易的將它們一一捕獲了。最奇怪的。魚服了毒。並不影響到它們的肉。烹煑以後。仍然可吃。一些没有異味。至於植物是何名稱。却不可考了。</p>

<p>— 自在</p>
<p>三門灣地處全國海岸之中心。爲浙東之門戶。土地沃衍。出産富饒。石浦鎭對面有東門島。即漢書地理志之天門山。地極險要。唐時築昌國衛城於島巓。警備防寇。其地四面環水。驚濤駭浪。苟值天霧夜霾。港門莫辨咫尺。海舶過此。咸視爲畏途。尤以與島對峙之老虎礁爲險惡。航行不愼。立肇災禍。吾昨因事往遊三門灣。順道參觀東門島鐙塔。塔爲漁民任筱和筱甫兄弟所建。高三丈餘。中置汽油燈。晚間燃之。宛如黑夜孤星。遠近皆見。航行者得指迷津。遂慶安瀾。</p>
<p>任氏兄弟。捕魚爲業將生平積蓄數千金。盡建鐙塔。并在塔旁。造平房兩幢。前四楹。後三楹。招待遊客休憩。陳設幽雅。壁間懸有喩志韶章一山馬公禺余天遂曾農髯等所書聨幅。均以義士稱之。蓋任氏兄弟自建塔後。家産蕩然。粗衣惡食。過其漁民生活。是眞難能可貴。其利濟社會心之深。實可媿煞一般守財虜也。</p>
<p>當吾之晤筱和義士時。披穿士織白棉布短衣。跣足不履。髮長垂肩。面部深褐色。似久歷風霜者。然其熱烈深厚之情感。時流露於談笑間。燈塔每年所需油類及其他維持費。須七百餘金。從未向外界勸募分毫。仍恃每日賣魚所得以充之。某次有人代陳當局。收歸省有。期能永久。豈知祗博得省庫奇絀。所請應毋庸議十字了之。然於此任氏不能不與波濤上下沐雨櫛風。勤於捕魚。維持油費矣。</p>
<p>把晤之餘。承任義士殷勤設餐欵待。水國佳餚。别饒風趣。並導登鐙塔。憑欄遠眺。水色山光。盡收眼底。海風呼嘯。衣袖飛揚。幾疑秋神降臨人間。豈復知是三伏天。酷暑薰蒸時也。茗談數時。又饗吾手製之苔萊黍粉團味美可口。得未曾有。嗟呼。斥私財。利公衆。與世無爭。自食其力。方之爭權奪利沽名釣譽之徒。其賢不肖。當有上下床之别。憶喩君所贈楹帖。「山中有二士。海外第一鐙」句。可謂貼切極矣。吾盤桓半日。臨别秉筆書數語與之。聊作雪泥鴻爪之誌耳。文云。中華民國二十年七月。往遊三門灣。道出石浦。順遊天門山鐙塔。承任筱和義士。殷勤招待。義士辛勞半生。借漁爲樂。斥私財利羣衆。指世道以迷津。樂善和好之風。當與斯塔並垂不朽。僕數載聞聲。一朝把晤。覽山水之佳勝。享半日之清閒。快慰無藝。因書數語。用留鴻爪。並表謝忱云。</p>

<p>— 湘蘅</p>
<p>細雨籠愁。空撩亂。滿園春色。簾半捲。海棠鋪綉。暮烟凝碧。鸚鵡驚回芳草夢。錦箋吟損靑雲客。但黄昏庭院悄無人。歸鴉急。更莫訴。風前笛。情與恨。還如織。嘆毶金縷。繫春無力。寂寞畫橈瓊沼裏。低回燕語雕樑側。向平湖十里杏花寒。誰憐惜。</p>

<p>— 無言</p>
<p>我國技擊之學。本於養生家。而養生家之熊經鳥伸五禽戲等。又爲古人樂舞之餘意。樂舞之變入養生。又與道家相通。故樂舞其全。而禽戲外壯等其分而各得其一偏也。五代時。達摩駐錫於嵩山。少林寺有達摩功之傳。厥後其徒數人。曾佐唐太宗敗王世充。有功。得封號。而宋太祖嘗以所學授少林僧。故少林有太祖拳之傳。岳武穆爲秦檜所害。所學爲少林僧所得。故少林有岳家手之傳。而少林遂爲技擊術之總匯。元代張三豐祖師。與少林僧相契。以道術互授。旣盡其奥。改爲柔拳。又曾夢玄帝授以拳法。後隠武當山。故有武當少林二派之别。三豐祖師旣精丹學。又通易旨。曾有無極太極八卦三套大拳各爲一百二十八手之創造。（共三百八十四手以合易經三百八十四爻）而畸人奇士。秘爲鴻寳。私相授受。以致殘缺不全。一鱗一爪。而集腋成裘者已不易得矣。然三套一氣而得眞傳者。固單傳一線。而未嘗絶也。周君天祥。成童時曾受業於徐州彭祖藩先生。而得其眞傳。兼武當少林兩派之長。昔游漢臯。今來滬濱。聞聲相思者。會諸同志。請周君表演於辛家花園之清凉寺。國曆二日。周君慨然蒞會。將無極拳一百二十八手勢表演一通。其手法之精妙。身勢之活潑。神情之肅穆。行氣之周足。非眞能得柔拳之三昧者。不能臻此絶詣也。時到會者。有武匯川葉大密季融五蔣竹莊靜波老和尙吕子彬父子黄星若父子。某女士曁來賓多人。觀演之後。莫不拍手贊歎。我國一切學問。本於易敎。今雖散失略盡。然果能悉心訪求。隨在可見先聖賢無所不用其極之寳藏。拳術其一也。他日周君能將三套養生大拳與少林派名拳公之於世。不但宜老宜少宜文宜武。延年却病。且於古樂舞易象中能間接放出特異之采。强國强種。發揚先烈。胥有賴也。爰泚筆紀之。（不受酬）</p>

<p>— 抱琴軒主</p>
<p>慕虎邱之勝久矣。以塵務鞅掌。卒不果游。日前天一公司赴蘇攝「歌塲春色」外景。邵君邀余同往。乘間得游虎邱。數年夙願。一旦獲償。快何如之。古人云。「偷得浮生半日閒」。今余可謂「偷得忙中半日游」矣。</p>
<p>是日清晨。由該公司乘汽車至北站。俄而職員演員亦陸續至。上車後。笑語雜作。宣景琳尤妙語解頣。及車抵蘇州。下車後。即攝車站外景。章擁翠飾一賣花女。持花筐徘徊月臺上。不知者誤以爲眞。竟有向之購花者。車站攝畢。即乘馬車至花園飯店。復攝三五鏡頭。始進午餐。時已一時三十分。諸人飢腸轆轆。一見饌至。即匙箸齊飛。肴饌乃如風捲殘雲。頃刻立盡。餐後。諸人先返滬。余則雇車赴玄妙觀。及至。大失所望。蓋除攤肆以外。别無可以游賞之處。環行一周。即往訪舊同學王愼軒君。王君爲蘇州名醫。與余闊别將十載。相見甚歡。即偕余往游虎邱。途中泥淖縱横。車輪陷泥中。不能前進。由兩車夫一推一挽而行。及抵虎邱寺門。乃舍車步行。王君導余游各處殆遍。其中如劍池千人石諸景。余曾於「唐伯虎」影片中見過。不啻舊地重游。復至冷香閣啜茗。此閣佈置。頗似嘉興烟雨樓。四週環植梅花。若在冬令。則暗香疎影。尤饒清趣。余因急欲返滬。潡覽畢。乘車逕赴車站。道經山塘街。大水没岸。深且半尺。車夫涉而過。宛如行車水上。因憶昔讀孟子。至子産以其乘輿濟人於溱洧。以爲輿而曰濟。頗近滑稽。不圖今日躬逢其事。抵站後。購票登車。汽笛一聲。車輪轉動。憑窗遙矚。猶見北寺塔屹立於蒼茫暮色中也。</p>

<p>七號。余旣接洽印回兩敎人士。復觀察其社會。對於印度觀察。略有心得。更觀其歷史所紀載。乃知印回兩民族之不同。在於宗敎永遠不能合作。印人社會素食敬神。求解脫人生者也。遠在巢父許由以上。仙佛之敎也。回敎以勇武開國。以敎爲立國之本。肉食敬天。强毅而馳騁中亞。求征伏異派者也。諺云秀才遇着兵。有理講不清。此印回之謂矣。吾觀全印史。馬基頓入而主之。希拉人主之。蒙古人主之。回人波斯人阿富汗人入而主之。近英人主之。印度敎不講政治也。其缺乏政治思想。故他種勢力自然人而乘其隙。此印度之謂也。吾中國以中道爲敎。但哲學宗敎缺乏。故佛敎入而主之。又物質科學缺乏。故歐美物質科學入而主之。蓋各民族各有專門特長特性。互助而相成也。今後吾望吾國深入物質科學。更發揮吾中道政治民生主義。以乘歐土之隙。而補其缺。則創大同者。舍華人而誰與。嗚呼。觀於印度各地戰禍頻仍。則純賢聖仙佛不足以爲治也。希拉之亡也。羅馬蠻族掠其哲學家名士美人。充野蠻種之奴隸。則希拉哲學不足以治國也。又觀於拿破侖之横行。成吉思汗之狂暴。忽焉而滅。毫無遺留。則徒　武力不足以治國也。吾中國有八字。曰經天緯地。文治武功。聖賢豪傑。陰陽剛柔。具備無缺。此中華之所以爲中華也。至宗敎問題。二十世紀已不成大問題。而回印人尙斤斤於此。非吾人所汲汲矣。中國者。民生問題與人生問題也。</p>
<p>是日有沙彌神信。Satyacleo音譯爲史特退。一印度敎徒。初歸自美國。從歐洲經過而返印度。年約五十餘。着淡黄衣。在禮堂講演。余苦不解梵語。不知何云。惟千餘學生。鼓掌不絶。約一分鐘。余愛印度學生之鼓掌。抑揚有調。如奏樂然。二千人鼓掌。如一大風琴也。此爲印度學生之特色矣。沙彌史特退語余。美人之願望於亞洲印度中國。不過销貨物取財耳。但今信印度敎者多。各大埠均有印度敎堂矣。余甚惜中國旣自無敎可傳。而并佛敎亦無人向外國傳之。徒自居於受人敎訓之地也。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>陸先生有些醋意了。他本來很熱羨着丁小姐，祇爲了幾個月來，雖然枉費了許多的心思：信寫過不少，電話也打過不少，總没有比較可以樂觀的答覆：可是他還不曾覺得絶望、他還以爲丁小姐對於他很有好感。所以他。始終還是熱烈地追求着。</p>
<p>現在，他居然看見丁小姐跟小陸一同來玩，又聽得小陸說是他去邀着伊一同來的，又想起三天前他自己曾經邀過伊來玩高爾夫球而伊不曾答應。心頭就像受了三下嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>當時也没有其他的談話，丁小姐向李先生笑了笑，自和陸先生繼續着前進了。李先生越看越生氣，越想越憤怒。他才知道自己是已經失敗在小陸的手了。</p>
<p>好容易十八個球穴都打完，陸先生把記着的擊數結算了一下，丁小姐的成績比較好一些，一共是打了六十四下，陸先生自己却打了七十三下·</p>
<p>「高爾夫這個名詞實在奇妙，自然我應該讓你佔着上風哩。」陸先生哈哈大笑</p>
<p>「爲什麽你應該讓我呢？」丁小姐還不懂得這句話的意義。</p>
<p>「把高爾夫三個字解釋起來，不就是說勝過你的丈夫麽？」他更高聲笑了。</p>
<p>丁小姐一些也不惱怒，祇覺得有些羞澀。但是在伊整個的思潮之中，分明這是一個極可珍重的紀念，又是極有刺激的享樂。</p>
<p>他們談談笑笑，一切都沈浸在融洩的風光之中。祇是時時在那邊偷瞧着的李先生，總覺得這是一個絶大的恥辱，不得不帶着失望與怨憤而怏怏地走了。</p>
<p>丁小姐雖然是生長在上海的，但是伊對於繁囂的都市生活却也有些嫌惡。伊很想在這個假期裏，到山水清幽的地方去旅行一回：現在伊才覺得可以有這個機會。</p>
<p>「上海也玩得膩煩了，我很想到蘇州去玩幾天。你是蘇州人，你得盡盡地主之誼啊！」丁小姐笑着說。</p>
<p>陸先生聽得丁小姐要到蘇州去，心裏便有些忐忑不寗：他想起了蘇州的火車站，便覺得對於他是有極大的危險性的。他只得宛轉地說：「我以爲蘇州没有杭州好，除了杭州·無錫的太湖也眞不錯。」</p>
<p>「不！杭州我是已經去過幾回了，無錫我也不想去，我想，還是到蘇州去好，又返又便利，况且又是你的故鄉！」丁小姐似乎很堅决的表示。</p>

<p>南市　河下昨日各帮來源略有、浦存不多、市面復漲、因洋米逐見提增、且北市又硬、各戶稍露進意、厚粳行情驟增二三角、薄稻到則不多、寗胃雖懈、本街去路尙活、致價又硬二角、蘆洋尖緣洋米日增、胃甚不弱、形亦跟起、陰化到稀銷可、勢歸穏健、洋米貨仍薄弱、漢帮動辦、本街亦有稍取、價格步硬、東新粳昨到一百餘石、致價站定、十四元五角、</p>

<p>施針工作　本月一日、爲甬輪入埠實行檢疫之第一日、但以各輪埠公司、事前未及通知各輪班長、故第一日市衛生局派醫生前往、未獲正式檢查璃二日太古新北京輪入口時、施針計七百六十人、大　檢查計十四人、寗紹輪施針五百二十人、大便檢查計十人、三日停航、四日新江天六百人、騐　十人、寗興約一千人、騐便十五人、五日新北京六百人、騐便十八人、新寗紹六百人、騐便十四人、六日新江天六百人、騐便二十一人、寗興六百四十人、騐便二十人、此數日來、施針檢查糞菌之槪數、但霍亂病者、幸未有入口也、</p>

<p>— 珂</p>
<p>奇怪、「亭子問」這個名詞、在現在的上海看來、差不多可以說是成爲一個特殊的名稱了、像「亭子間的生活」、「亭子間的文藝」、它又像北平的公寓一般、具着一種特有的神秘的氣味、可是、我雖然没有生活過、但對於這、總覺得不合胃口、討壓、不用說、自已没有亭子間生活的希望、即是、無論在一張印刷品上、或是一個人的談話裏、祗要是提到了亭子間這話、立刻會給我一個灰色的感觸——湫隘、凌亂、空氣濕悶而帶有腐朽的氣味、頽喪慘白的臉、披足的頭髮、低垂的頭顱、曲僂的背脊、枯澀而失望的眼睛、這些、像電影般不斷地在我眼前閃動、而引起我的不快、</p>
<p>記得有一天、我眞的走進一個亭子間了、不過所得的印象、却完全不是我想像的——而所得的不快却更深刻了、</p>
<p>那天、正是穿襯絨袍子的天氣、琴換了一件新做好的絨旗袍、怱怱地走到我房裏、要我陪她去江灣看一個朋友、</p>
<p>「他在什麽地方住、」我問、</p>
<p>「亭子問」、她說、</p>
<p>「呵、亭子間、」湫隘、凌亂、……又閃電般地在我腦裏閃過、</p>
<p>「不去、」我說、</p>
<p>「什麽、不去、好朋友、去罷、陪我去罷、」</p>
<p>我被她拖拖扯扯地終於答應了陪她去我們下了火車、又坐黄包車、轉了幾個灣、</p>
<p>「到了」、琴說着、黄包車便歇下來、</p>
<p>「花園街×××號」我略略地向門牌睨了一眼、便隨着琴走進那大門、記不清、不知道是怎樣地轉了一轉、一座樓梯突然地阻住去路、我們上了梯子、琴低聲地說、</p>
<p>「你看、那屋子便是了」、</p>
<p>左首一間房門上釘着兩張破壞了的名片、從房裏發出「拍拍」地牌響、夾着一種温柔的微帶蕩意的笑語聲、琴輕輕地在門上敲了幾下、</p>
<p>「啥人、請進來、」接着門便呀然地開了、</p>
<p>「呼………………」</p>
<p>「喂………………」</p>
<p>裏邊約有五六個男女搶着和琴招呼我跟着跨進屋裏、忽然地感到侷促、不安、幾乎想要退出來、</p>
<p>琴一箇一箇地替我介紹、我只略略地向大家點了點頭、不自然地立在琴的背後、</p>
<p>「請坐罷、」琴的朋友曉嵐很客氣地招呼、他是一個眼小臉尖的男人、穿着菜綠色的綢夾袍、西裝褲子拖到脚後跟、</p>
<p>「　」我在鼻管裏應了一聲、便　到靠穿的一張椅子上坐下、</p>
<p>椅子傍邊拉雜地堆着許多東西、洋油爐、爐上傾斜地放着一個鉛鍋、鍋裏濁水浸着幾把匙、鉛桶、洋鐵壺、菜碗、碗上架了幾极筷子、我很小心地把脚放好、我怕弄着黑煤、或踢翻了什麽、</p>
<p>「抱歉呀、攪亂了你們的牌局、」琴譏諷似地笑着說、</p>
<p>「没有什麽、」曉嵐似乎懂得地解釋道、「這不過是散悶、消遣、課餘的消遣、没有什麽、」</p>
<p>……………………………………</p>
<p>坐在牌桌上首、舖着黑灰色的（原來是白的）線毯的小鐵床上的一個大眼高顴的女郎、她瞟了曉嵐一眼、又對着坐在她右首的一個廣東口音的男人笑了一笑、把頭部斜俯到他的肩膀上、她輕巧地用手指做成一個圓筒、緊緊地靠住男人的左耳、血般地厚嘴唇貼在拇指邊、低聲地和他說、那男人便也睨着曉嵐微笑、</p>
<p>房裏對面舖着兩張小鐵床、主人便是曉嵐和那廣東人、廣東人見一個高高地箇子、黑黑地臉、最使人容易認識的是他的大鼻子、大得有些不相稱、</p>
<p>「秀、來唱一曲罷、一個本地口音、身材瘦小、穿着很整齊西裝的男人、向站在窗前正翻着一本曲本的女郎說、一邊把擺在凳上的留聲機連凳子拖到他面前、」「落花流水」就是這張吧、一說着便開動起來、</p>
<p>「不、誰願意唱這個、」秀微微地側著頭、但終於走到留聲機邊、發出一種尖脆的音調合着片子唱、她很白晣、圓圓的面孔上隠約有幾點麻、却不覺得難看、她有着靈巧的身段、常常喜歡一手支著腰、越顯得婀娜了、</p>
<p>歌聲岔斷了琴和曉嵐的談話、</p>
<p>「待慢新客呵、這里很龉龊的、」曉嵐忽然向我謙遜地說、</p>
<p>「不、……這房子很清爽、」我聲音低到連自己也幾乎聽不清楚、</p>
<p>「她呵、她是喜歡靜默的、」琴說者轉過來對我笑了一笑、</p>
<p>「是的、用功的人總愛靜默的、」曉嵐聳了聳肩膀說、</p>
<p>我笑了笑、没說什麽、</p>
<p>「曉風、她是不喜歡多說話的、你懂得没有、」琴說過又照樣地望著我揄挪似地微笑、</p>
<p>「哈哈……」曉嵐大嚨喉笑起來、</p>
<p>「怎的、這樣地討厭、」我想、</p>
<p>的確、我這時對他們起了一種輕鄙、厭惡、恨不得立刻跑了出去、</p>
<p>「没有什麽事、我們可以走罷、」我站起來問琴、</p>
<p>「回去嗎、反正没有要緊的事、再談談吧、」琴反對我說、</p>
<p>「那末、我先去、你再談談好了、」我决然地向他們告了别、他們隨便說了幾句挽留的話、便送到門口、隠約聽得說、</p>
<p>「面貌倒和氣、性情太冷僻哩、」</p>
<p>接著又是「拍拍」的牌響和笑謔的聲音、</p>
<p>這是一年多以前的事情、輕鄙、厭惡、依舊在我腦裏浮漾著、</p>
<p>今年暑假離開學校時、霖問我、</p>
<p>「這長的假期、你預備做點什麽、」</p>
<p>「我很想寫點文稿、但是、地方太煩囂了、」我說、</p>
<p>「你可以這樣做啊、另外租一間亭子間、一個人、豈不是很清靜嗎、」</p>
<p>「唉、怎能夠呢、」我搖搖頭回答她、我很明白自己、除了讀書以外、是不會做任何事情的、我不會用恰好的水量做成一鍋可以下咽的飯、或是拾隻籃子去小菜塲買些魚·肉·靑菜、什麽都不會、那有住亭子間的資格呢、但是、現在的我、却眞的坐在亭子間裏了、而且是整日地、</p>
<p>我自從回到姊姊處以後、一星期了、不能讀書或寫點什麽、姊姊、她是最喜歡講閒話、兩個外甥女、活潑而又頑皮、前面的鄰居有小孩哭、左首的鄰居打牌、打架、「我不怕這些、」我下了一個堅决的意志、我便試試做事、拿起筆來、祇聽得「哇、哇哇……、」「拍、劈拍、」我腦筋裏便只有這複雜的聲音在波動、筆底下就不由地重覆的寫出這幾個字來、「換換口胃吧、」我又去拿一本書來讀、可是、書頁上明明白白地一行行的黑字、而它裏面的東西、我什麽也看不懂、「怎麽辨、這樣下去、眞糟啦、」我終日地焦急著、想得到一塊安靜點的地方、</p>
<p>「亭子間、一個人、豈不是很清靜嗎、」霖的話突然地又在我意識裏重述了一遍、引起我對於姊姊處亭子間的注意、</p>
<p>這房間、門是開在晒台上、我們從來没有走進過那裏面去的、去年是給娘姨住、今年娘姨搬到樓下去、便只是堆積什物、箱子、木桶、洋鐵箱、竹簍、……雜亂地擺滿了一房間、裏邊雖然并不大、然而、却非常地安靜、如果把晒台上的門和通到廂房裏的門關閉、外面的煩囂聲浪一點也不會透進來、於是我就動手去整理、把十幾隻箱子一齊疊成三垜、一排地靠著墻根安放靠窗擺了一張方桌、置著幾本應用的書和墨水等、桌子底下正好堆放些零碎廢物、還有木桶、洋鐵箱……都略略地收拾了一下、層疊著堆在窗邊的墻角落裏、</p>
<p>「呵、好講究的寫字間、」姊姊嘲笑似地說、但、我以爲光線很充足、便十分滿意了、</p>
<p>窗戶是對著一個公署的後門開的、空氣還算清鮮、公署的後門口、種著一顆梧桐樹、濃密的綠蔭把整個弄堂遮得凉陰陰地、當輕風吹過、樹葉時時發出沙沙的聲響、給人一種輕飄的快感、起初房裏有些做黴氣、後來、經我勤懇地掃除、竟弄得很爽適了、我每天洗漱過後、便坐在窗前的方桌邊、靜靜地嘗味亭子間的生活、外面任是怎樣喧擾、也不能撥動我沉默的心絃、不過、有一件討厭的事、公署二樓的窗門正對著、裏面的辦事員閒暇的時候、常常故意地大聲咳嗽、嘘、嘘………</p>

<p>— 霖</p>
<p>每星期賺三十元至四十元的女子、阿台爾蘭寳的一天生活如下、</p>
<p>鐘聲打了八下、阿台爾伸了伸身子、仍舊踡伏在安適温暖的被頭裏、她感覺得腿裏有點酸痛、不久也就忘了、</p>
<p>阿台爾在一家服裝批發店裏充當模特兒、他住在合組屋裏、屋主是一對靑年夫婦、因爲要减輕浩大的開支、所以將餘屋出租、阿台爾進出自由、伊將住屋做爲社交之用、這一點使得屋主大爲沮喪、阿台爾每星期付十塊錢的房金、房間裏的佈置很是簡單、雖然伊在室内添置了幾個紐帶式的枕頭、三個法國式的洋娃娃、和幾張麥克司菲派立許的圖書、</p>
<p>阿台爾本來到紐約投身於舞台、事實上她過了四星期的舞臺生活、被選在音樂歌唱隊裏、她無思無慮的非常高興、練習的時期共一個月、在這個當兒演員當然不支薪水、然後在郊外一家小戲院裏演唱三天、再回來練習一個星期、這個末了一星期也没有工資、最後這戲班在紐約一家戲院裏公演、一連三星期生意清淡、就關門了、阿台爾覺得舞臺生活與伊的經濟狀况太不穏固、她從新找個位置做一家服裝店裏的模特兒、這個工作時間長而精神辛苦、可是工資很靠得住、阿台爾起初每星期賺三十元、後來又尋到别個位置、每星期薪水三十五元、</p>
<p>早晨起來實在很痛苦、這個時候是服裝批發最繁盛的時期、阿台爾怎樣的願意睡到中午呢、她一躍就起了床、洗過澡著衣服、手續很簡單、</p>
<p>阿台爾上一家價廉的餐館進早膳、這家餐館在百老匯上街、伊需要吃點東西支持一早晨的工作、因爲伊得到一種經騐、不吃東西往往容易暈倒在地板上、</p>
<p>她上工遲到五分鐘或十分鐘毫没有關係、除非這事情成功了一種習慣、她常常在九點一刻鐘到服裝店去、</p>
<p>在服裝批發店裏、模特兒的待遇好像營業上的用品一般、這種女子穿着薄的裏衣、和短緊貼肉的襯衫、這樣子穿衣服上去纔能伏貼、如果她們事情不忙、那末大家穿着襯衣坐在儲藏室裏、覺著冷淡無聊的時候、可以抽枝烟解悶、她們雖然穿着很稀很少的衣服、可是並没有人注意她們、當那買主進來的時候、模特兒等必定要試穿各種衣服給他們看、穿著衣服有一種專門的學問、阿台爾的一點淺薄的舞臺經騐、對於此事帮助不少、因爲伊曉得怎樣處置伊的體態、一件一件的衣服必須要著了脫、脫了著、模特兒等應該常常露著快樂喜悅的樣子、有時候售貨員對於模特兒發生無禮侮辱的舉動、女郎們祇得完全置諸不理、</p>
<p>阿台爾常常帮助衣服的出售、也許有一天她自己要賣出去、雖然現在她還没有充足的經騐做這件事、此外伊覺得自己不穏定、缺少責任心、伊明白有一天要和人家結婚、伊現在對於自己生活的方式很覺滿意、</p>
<p>伊所穿著做樣子的衣服、都是爲伊特製的、所以十分配身、伊穿了衣服要前後走動、這眞是件辛苦勞力的事、而牠却做出喜悅高興的樣子、當那售貨員對伊所穿的衣服加以大批定貨時、經理就在伊的背上輕拍示意、</p>
<p>這一個特殊的早晨、店裏十分忙碌、許多城外的主顧都聚集在内、女郎們做工須要加一倍快速、有幾個人專等在著衣室裏帮助她們著脫衣裳、經理走進來道、「女郎們、今天你們祗有半小時工夫進膳、我們要將全部的服裝給四個大買主看、仔細你們不要來遲了、」</p>
<p>女郎們對於這個宣佈、顯然没有滿意的表示、「啊、眞倒霉、你想我是誰的奴隸呀、」此外有同樣的咀駡在經理背後鬧着、可是這些女郎都准時回店、她們跑到一家附近的小吃店裏、吃了些熱食山明治和饅頭等、這個食單和平時略有不同、因爲女郎們很注意她們的食品、如果身量加重、她們的位置就要動搖了、在進食的時候、大谈談工作的經過情形、這幾個女郎大家都很相熟、所以談話時毫没有所顧忌、她們對於外表的謙遜一些也不知道、</p>
<p>下半天仍舊忙個不了、直到六點一刻鐘、阿台爾方纔很疲乏的穿上自己的衣服、經理走出來對伊說、「阿台爾、我要看你」、她扣上衣服的鈕子後、就跑到經理室裏、</p>
<p>「聽好了、孩子、那個從哇海哇來的買主、眞是個好人呢、他要帶你出去吃飯看戲、現在聽好了、他是一個好人、否則我是不放你去的、」</p>
<p>阿台爾知道經理想在這個買主身上、明天做一筆大交易、伊在這晚上早已與人有約、不願意改動、可是伊明白業務是緊要的、</p>
<p>「好的、我一准去罷、不過甲克、你總得在這里給件衣服我穿纔是、身上的破衣服不能穿了去、而時間又很局促、不能回家更調、」</p>
<p>許多女郎直呼着經理的第一個名字、在這個當兒、甲克不覺縐眉、因爲這是一個無字的法律、凡是模特兒不能將店裏的衣服穿到外面去、有時候女郎們違犯此律、查出以後、便要歇業、甲克覺得阿台爾有意要挾、但是他終究允應了、</p>
<p>「好阿台爾、照此辦罷、不過不要給别的女郎曉得、」</p>
<p>在服裝批發店裏、模特兒得有一種優待、凡是好看的衣服、都能用極低廉的代價買來、她們能夥買樣子衣、如果時期已經過去了、當那批發的時期巳經過去、零賣尙在上市時、這種協定相互有利、要是一個女子在服裝店裏做模特兒、伊的店主常和批發店來往、可以使她往批發店裏擇取衣服、</p>
<p>别的女郎急促回家之時、阿台爾在店裏躭擱不走、她開始很用心的穿着衣服、伊曉得甲克不會呌她去接待那買主、如果他是靠不住的、許多許多的買主想、他們有一種特權、可以隨時和模特兒交往、在下級的批發店裏、他們將這件事、例爲模特兒應盡職務的一種、要他們接待外城的買主、在這個特殊情况之下、阿台爾知道這個從哇海哇來的買主、也許在紐約單獨無聊、所以要一個伴侣解悶取樂、</p>
<p>伊揀了一件綠顔色的衣服、這個買主極力稱賞的、伊想把這件衣服在他眼前顯示一夜、也許他就會定買的、</p>
<p>約會見面的一家旅館、離店不過四條街、阿台爾僱了一輛汽車、很安閒的坐在裏面、可是時間很暫、伊要告訴車夫、將車暫等待用、再告訴那買主、伊巳經僱了一輛車子在外、因爲在這個時候的夜間、僱車是很困難的、倘然伊曉得一個人眞有錢的、阿台爾也决不要呌他將錢化去、伊認識一個學法律的靑年、當他將伊帶出去玩的時候、伊决計提議上那不十分化錢的地方去遊玩、他們到電影院去看戲、坐地道車、不過遇到了這個大買主、就决不如此了、</p>
<p>他已經籌備了這一夜的娛樂、連夜飯都已定好、他們在戲院區的一家大旅館屋頂上進餐、這個地方是冬季罕有開放的塲所、豐富的晚膳陳列在桌上、從牡蠣乳酪直到餅乾、種種齊備、阿台爾每樣都嘗一點、買主每樣都吃了許多、他們除了談論衣業之外、靜默的時候不少、阿台爾知道伊應該活潑潑地想些笑料談談、可是毫没有新鮮事故、</p>
<p>「去看看新鮮的戲罷」、當他們從旅館的大門走上汽車時、買主熱切的說着、可是他將戲名說出來的時候、阿台爾不禁心裏一沉、雖然不久伊仍回復了很喜悅的樣子、事實上、伊看過這齣偉大的歌劇、和不同的買主至少有八次之多、好像他們都愛看這戲似的、當然他們對於模特兒從來没有問過歡喜看什麽戲、買主看他們祗像用具一般、不作爲人類的女子、</p>
<p>談話中間、他們也不專指阿台爾所工作的一家批發店、買主曾向伊問及幾種關於式樣的問題、對於伊的意見好像很鄭重似的、在阿台爾方面、這一晚眞不可耐、在買主方面呢、見見紐約的世面罷了、他要回去告訴同住的伴侣、關於紐約伴遊的美麗姑娘、和那晚化錢的可觀、此外還要警告他們、不要在伊妻子面前提起、</p>
<p>阿台爾對於這齣戲的劇情、已能默誦於心、戲裏的裝束和音樂於伊也有一樣的熟悉、伊漸有睡意、伊竭力與睡魔爭扎、在疲倦中間不使瞌眼、在演劇中間伊還指點戲劇怎樣的高妙、使她的同伴高興</p>
<p>伊渴想回家安睡、去歇息她痛苦的身子、看戲完畢之後、别的事情不能做、他們上一家流行的夜總會跳舞小食、阿台爾微有不願之意、結果倒底屈服了、在夜總會裏他們戴上低帽、吹呌子跳舞、吃東西直鬧到三點鐘、其後大家筋疲力盡、伊對那城外的大買主話、這個晚上怎樣的可喜悅呀、伊眞是太疲倦爬上她的床去、一忽兒便熟睡了、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Seeking High-Level Talent <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Our association is a collective of machine-made domestic goods factories, with over one hundred and eighty member factories. In every discussion with managers, we often feel the difficulty of business development. It is not due to a lack of wealth but rather a shortage of capable talent. In other words, talent is hard to come by.</p>
<p>While capital and sophisticated machinery are necessary for business development, and the pursuit of inexpensive yet high-quality products is essential for smooth operation, nothing can be achieved without talent. With sufficient talent, capital, machinery, and everything else will fall into place. Naturally, product quality will be excellent, and business will thrive. Therefore, talent is the prerequisite for industry. Is there truly a lack of talent? With thirty years of education in our country, the number of talents cultivated cannot be considered small. The number of students returning from overseas in the East and West cannot be considered few. However, how many have contributed to society? How many have applied their knowledge to the domestic goods industry? On one hand, there is a lament about the difficulty of finding talent; on the other hand, there is a lack of avenues to utilize it. It is precisely because of the difficulty of contact between the two sides of supply and demand that domestic goods cannot easily achieve their effectiveness, and talents cannot easily demonstrate their abilities. This is a great loss to society. The stagnation of Chinese enterprises may well stem from this. At this time of anti-Japanese sentiment, creation and imitation are urgent and pressing matters. In the past twenty years, there have been nine calls for economic severance, but what has been the result? In a word, those with true talent have not found a good opportunity. Now, if we rise up quickly and rally our spirits, we may yet achieve some small success. It is time for ambitious young people with specialized skills who wish to serve society. Our association, on one hand, develops the domestic goods industry, and on the other hand, values specialized talents. Therefore, we are seeking talents to introduce both sides to each other. We hope that comrades who have talent but have not yet met the right opportunity, and true talents with expertise, will be willing to come and contribute to the domestic goods industry, which is to open up endless benefits for society. This humble intention is shared with comrades at home and abroad.</p>
<p>(Announcement) Applicants should send their applications to this association, stating their name, age, place of origin, education, expertise, and attaching a plan of approximately 300 characters, as well as stating their desired salary. (Not published) This association will select the best and compile them into a booklet to be distributed to various factories for introduction. All submitted documents will not be returned. The deadline for submission is August 30th. Please do not send applications for ordinary positions.</p>

<p>(Jinan) Shi Yousan's handgun brigade arrived in Dexian from Wucheng on the evening of the 5th, followed by a cavalry brigade of over 200 men. Cao Fulin took the Taishan armored car from Dezhou to Ji'nan at 3:00 AM this morning, got off at Luokou, and only took one person. He took a car to visit Han and returned to Dexian at 8:30 AM. Cao said that Shi's handgun brigade had over 2,000 men and the cavalry brigade had over 200 men. They arrived in Dezhou on the 5th and are temporarily stationed at Qilibao, south of the city.

<h3 id="e16">(5) The Disaster Situation in the Yellow River Basin <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>This time, the water calamity has also greatly affected the provinces and districts in the Yellow River basin. According to various newspapers, the affected provinces include Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan, with Henan being the most severely affected.</p>
<p>In Shandong, the Yellow River flows horizontally to the north and the Grand Canal vertically to the west. The river course shifts constantly, and the areas along the river are constantly threatened by floods. This time, with continuous heavy rain for days, the water level rose sharply, and the riverbanks were severely impacted, presenting dangerous situations. Although the River Affairs Bureau made great efforts to rescue the situation and prevent a breach, the low-lying areas along the river were all flooded. The autumn harvest will be greatly affected. In Jinan, following the flood, there was a severe hailstorm that damaged fields and houses and injured people and livestock, resulting in even greater losses. Although the Yellow River only flows through a corner of southern Hebei, the Yongding, Daqing, Hutuo, Haihe, Zhulong, and Grand Canal rivers crisscross the entire province. The southeastern part of the province is where all these rivers converge. This time, with the water calamity, all the rivers overflowed. The Yongding and Daqing rivers have already breached their banks, and the damage caused by the floods can be imagined. The city of Beiping also had knee-deep water, damaging property and injuring people, causing significant harm. Henan is the most severely affected province in the Yellow River basin. Rivers across the province have breached their banks, and nearly half of the province has been affected. The affected counties include Xihua, Yancheng, Ye County, Xiangcheng, Linying, Wuyang, Yanling, Mogou, Shangshui, Huaiyang, Xiping, Shangcai, Xiangcheng, Shenqiu, Xincai, Xinyang, Luoshan, Gushi, Huangchuan, Guangshan, Xixian, Luyi, Zhengyang, Xichuan, Deng County, and Dengfeng, among dozens of others. All are submerged in endless waves of water. Abandoned villages and wild shops drift like duckweed. Drowning people and livestock are washed up in piles. Those who were fortunate enough to survive gather on the mountains, overlooking the flood, drenched in rain and starving. With no way to survive, their cries shake the fields. The tragic situation is unseen in recent decades. As for Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan, these provinces have been plagued by natural disasters and man-made calamities for years. The survivors gnaw on tree roots and eat fruit to stave off hunger, and exchange children to eat, a tragic and inhumane situation. Anyone with a conscience cannot help but feel heartbroken and shed tears. This time, the water calamity has not spared them either. The Yellow River in Shanxi has risen, and the Sha River has breached its banks. The areas around Taiyuan, Xinjiang, Baode, and Heshun have all become disaster areas. In Shaanxi, the Luo and Wei rivers have risen sharply, and counties along the Wei River, such as Chaoyi, have become marshes. In Gansu and Suiyuan, the low-lying areas through which the Yellow River flows have also been submerged. Old wounds have not healed, and new wounds are inflicted. Woe to these survivors. What crime have they committed to deserve this fate? This is the general situation of the disaster in the provinces and districts of the Yellow River basin.</p>
<p>According to various newspapers, the disaster situation in the provinces of North China is roughly as described above. The details still need to be investigated and statistically analyzed in the future.

<p>Liu Wendao to Succeed as Ambassador to Germany</p>

This was decided at the State Council meeting on the 4th and has been agreed upon by the Japanese government. It is now being submitted to the National Government for official appointment. The successor as Ambassador to Germany will be Liu Wendao, the Director of Civil Affairs of Hubei Province. This has also been agreed upon by the German government and appointments will be made successively. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Reports on Investigation of Korean Case</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Rongbao arrived in Beijing at 4:30 pm. Ji Jing, Bi Mingyu, and Wang Yangqi met him at the station. He stayed at the Yangtze River Hotel. He said that he was ordered to investigate the losses of Chinese residents in the Korean case. He went to Seoul, Pyongyang, Incheon, and Sinuiju to investigate all losses together with the staff of the local consulates and overseas Chinese organizations. A written report has been prepared. He has spoken to the press many times on his way through Shenyang, Beiping, and Shanghai. In short, the Chinese in Pyongyang suffered the most during the Korean riots. Most of the houses of the overseas Chinese were destroyed. The property losses in Incheon and Sinuiju are still difficult to determine for the time being. In total, there were more than one hundred deaths, twice as many seriously injured, and twice as many slightly injured. In terms of property losses alone, the amount is approximately 2.5 million Japanese yen. The issue of responsibility for this incident is very clear. How our side should negotiate will be decided by the central government. I have come to Beijing specifically to report to the government. The location for future negotiations between the two parties, Nanjing or Tokyo, has not yet been determined. The Japanese side has now provided solid guarantees to the overseas Chinese in various places. If there are no major changes, they should be able to live in peace. The losses cannot be recovered in a short time. The Japanese side has consistently evaded responsibility for this case, insisting on using the name of relief and not acknowledging compensation. As for the negotiating strategy in the future, Foreign Minister Wang will be responsible for handling it. A joint investigation is not desired by either side and is unlikely to happen. Wang visited Wang Zhengting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs residence on the evening of the 6th and reported in detail on the investigation in various parts of Korea. Based on Wang's investigation report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will submit a third note to the Japanese government within days, still demanding that Japan take full responsibility.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to Zhong Yu in Changchun on the 5th, stating that although the Japanese side has agreed to withdraw the police force in the Wanbaoshan case mentioned in the telegram, they have not agreed to the return of Korean cultivators. It appears that they do not fully understand the crux of the case. It is hoped that negotiations will continue and make a clear statement that the Wanbaoshan area is not a mixed-residence area, and Korean people are not entitled to the rights of cultivators. The treaty is in place and can be reviewed. Unless all Korean people in the Wanbaoshan area withdraw, future disputes cannot be prevented. As for the withdrawal of the Japanese police force, Japan must implement it within the shortest possible time. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Accompanied by Curtius</p>
<p>Germany's Financial Crisis Has Barely Subsided</p>
<p>Domestic Political Turmoil Resurfaces</p>
<p>Berlin, National News Agency, 5th – Since the outbreak of the financial panic in Germany, German Chancellor Bai Luning and Foreign Minister Curtius have today left Berlin for the second time to continue the private meetings of leaders initiated by the British Prime Minister. The two took the Milan express train to the Italian capital at 10:00 PM, arriving in Rome early Friday morning. They are accompanied only by a translator and a secretary each. As the express train departed, crowds cheered them off. The Italian ambassador had already gone to Rome yesterday to make the final preparations for receiving the German leaders. According to official reports, the Chancellor and Foreign Minister met with the President this morning to discuss the trip.</p>
<p>Berlin, National News Agency, 5th – Before leaving for Italy, German President Bai Luning made a statement, saying that he expects the meeting with Mussolini to be pleasant and fruitful. The German people and government are well aware that Italy has always been guided by a sense of responsibility to maintain European peace and promote economic recovery. There is not only no ill will between the two nations, but they also share the same aspirations. Therefore, it is hoped that the friendly talks in the next few days will be very beneficial to both countries.</p>
<p>Berlin, Reuters, 5th – German banks, which had been closed since July 13th, reopened today. The situation is calm, with more deposits than withdrawals. The earlier fear of financial disruption during the reopening of banks has now been dispelled. The German people and business community are aware that borrowing from abroad is hopeless. Germany must save itself. This self-reliance is a promising feature. The German government suddenly decided to entrust the national bank with selling short-term treasury bills worth approximately 50 million marks, with an interest rate of 15%. Banks are rushing to buy them, which can generate a profit of at least 2 million marks.</p>
<p>Berlin, Reuters, 6th – Although the situation was calm when the banks reopened yesterday, another wave is about to emerge, causing anxiety among politicians of all parties. This is the national referendum on the dissolution of the Prussian State Assembly. This national referendum, scheduled for August 9th, was initiated by Herr Stahlhelm, an official of the National People's Party. Its purpose is to remove the coalition cabinet of the Social Democratic Central Party and the Democratic Party, which has been in office in Prussia for ten years. To achieve this goal, the national referendum must obtain a majority of 26,368,000 votes. Stahlhelm is supported by the National Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the National People's Party, and the People's Party (Foreign Minister Curtius is also a member of the People's Party). Even President Hindenburg, on whom German Chancellor Bai Luning relies for support to maintain the overall situation, is a supporter of Stahlhelm. However, the current government of Prussia is the most powerful supporter of Bai Luning. If the national referendum succeeds, it will have very unfavorable consequences, especially affecting foreign policy. Superficially, Stahlhelm seems to be able to mobilize and obtain the necessary majority. However, the initiators of the national referendum are now also worried about their future.</p>

<p>London, Reuters, 6th – News received from Copenhagen states that American aviator Mr. Cramer landed in Angmagssalik, Greenland yesterday, intending to explore the air route for American airlines, which has attracted general attention. It is said that the United States Post Office now intends to establish airmail service from the United States to Europe via Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands. Mr. Cramer departed from Tatroy on July 28th with a radio operator, carrying US$1,100 deposited with the Greenland government as a rescue fee in case his plane went missing. Britain has also taken similar actions before, and its aviator, Mr. Courtauld, almost lost his life. If Mr. Cramer succeeds this time, it may trigger competition between Britain and the United States. According to news from Washington, Deputy Postmaster General Glover declared that the Post Office Department was not involved in Cramer's flight, but would warmly welcome the results of Mr. Cramer's efforts, as the Post Office Department had studied the possibility of this air route.</p>

<p>Northeast Army</p>
<h3 id="e81">Orders Full-Line Pursuit <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Wen Nianzhong Discusses Shi's Army's Loss of One-Fifth</p>
<p>Most of the Northeast Army Pursues the Enemy to the Border of Shandong</p>
<p>A letter recently received from the Ping-Han Railway front states that the Northeast Army issued a general attack order on the morning of the 31st of last month. Yu Xuezhong himself departed from Baoding to supervise the troops, stationed at Fangshun Bridge, two stations away from Baoding. From Fangshun Bridge north to Baoding and south to Wangdu, transportation vehicles travel back and forth three times a day to transport military supplies and transmit news. However, important orders are still transmitted by telephone. After the military headquarters special train arrived at Fangshun Bridge, engineers installed a long-distance telephone on the train. According to front-line intelligence, Shi's army failed in the battle of Ranzhuang and retreated automatically. Most of its eastern route concentrated along the Hutuo River via Dongtinglun, and the central route bypassed Shijiazhuang along Zhengding. Another part of the army launched a fierce attack on Tang County west of the railway, attempting to contain the retreat of the central and left routes. The Northeast Army immediately dispatched the 18th Brigade of Du Jiwu to take charge of the left flank and the 14th Brigade of Chen Guanqun to take charge of the central route, respectively pursuing the enemy. Another 30th Brigade of Yu Zhaolin laid siege to Tang County with one part and approached Shijiazhuang along the railway with another part. The plane departed very early one day, and by the evening, it had dropped four reports. According to the reports, Shi Yun's army's baggage vehicles were discovered south of Zhengding. Many bombs were dropped and hit the targets. As for the official Shi's army, most of them retreated, and only a few plainclothes teams remained on the front line, showing slight resistance. The direction of Shi's army's retreat seemed to be toward the southeast. It was heard that the Central Army had intercepted them in the Nangong and Jixian areas, and the Second Army and the First Army were in contact to carry out a pursuit on the flanks and rear of Shi's army. As a result of the continuous pursuit, many prisoners were captured and transported to the rear. One day, two military flags, eleven artillery pieces, and countless rifles were captured. However, when Shi's army retreated, they destroyed the railway south of Qingfengdian. The first train of the Northeast armored train has gone to that area to repair it. Another day, a telegram from the front reported at night that the Northeast Army had occupied Dingzhou at 9:00 PM and was continuing to advance. At the same time, on the 29th and 30th evenings, due to the fierce fighting on the front line, there were many casualties on both sides. There is currently a train full of wounded soldiers being transported to the rear. Broken limbs and bones were a tragic sight. It was heard that most of them were soldiers from the 18th, 14th, 11th, and 3rd brigades. The battle of Ranzhuang was fought by the above three brigades, who tried their best to resist and prevent Shi's army from advancing. Otherwise, Baoding would not have been defended. Therefore, the casualties of these three brigades were higher than those of other units. It was heard that on the evening of the 30th, Shi's army used five brigades to advance back and forth, advancing and retreating three times. The battle was extremely fierce. Therefore, the sound of artillery in Baoding was very clear that night. However, Shi's army benefited from a quick battle and was difficult to defeat quickly, so they retreated. The Deputy Commander commended the brigade commanders of the three brigades for their effective command, which was able to defeat the strong enemy. Reporter recently met with Chief of Staff Wen Nianzhong, who said that our army has issued a full-line pursuit order. The 18th Brigade of Du Jiwu and the 11th Brigade of Dong Yingbin are pursuing the enemy in the An Guo and Shenze areas on the left flank. The 14th Brigade of Chen Guanyi is advancing towards Xinle. The 6th Cavalry Brigade of Bai Fengxiang is approaching the north bank of the Hutuo River. The 4th and 5th Cavalry Brigades of the Jin-Pu Railway have copied out in front of Shi's army to intercept them. A part of the Central Army has gone to Wuqiang Hengshui. This battle was a success of our army's tactics. Shi's army originally had three divisions, which were later expanded to five divisions. In addition, there was a special brigade. Due to insufficient manpower, many civilians were captured in various counties, so there were more than 70,000 people. The loss this time was less than one-fifth. Our army is determined to pursue the enemy with all its strength, in order to eliminate the remnants and eliminate future troubles. On the 2nd, Yu Xuezhong sent a telegram to take office as the commander of the First Group Army of the Northern Route Suppression of the Red Army, and specially made a military flag, which was red with three stars, which was extremely bright. On the same day, Yu arrived at Wangdu from Fangshun Bridge. Reporter met Yu at the station, who said that he would not stop here, but would abandon the railway and start to advance on land to supervise the pursuit between Dingzhou and Anguo, and then to Shenze. The enemy is now retreating to the southeast. Our army is determined to unite with all armies to intercept them, but only to the border of Shandong. It is expected to be completed in a week. Most of our army does not enter Shijiazhuang, but only a part of the 30th Brigade advances from the Ping-Han front. When our headquarters arrives at the Shandong border, if there are no other problems, it may change to the Jin-Pu Railway to return to Ping. But at this moment, the first step in the solution to Shi's army is to intercept it, in order to divide its military strength, so that it will not remain united, causing future troubles. Now the Central and Northeast armies have advanced. If it is absolutely necessary, order Shi's army to flee into Shandong. Our army's advance and retreat will be subject to the orders of the Central Committee, but there must be a proper solution. As for Shunde, it was heard that there was still a part of Shi's army in the city to defend it. The northward advance of the Central Army, it was heard, was to bypass the left and right routes. In the future, when the majority of Shi's army is resolved, then that part will naturally not be a problem, or it may flee into the nearby mountains, it is also unknown. As for the situation in the front, according to the plane report obtained today, Shi's army was discovered along the Hutuo River. Two bombs were dropped by the plane, and both were hit. The other side suffered heavy casualties and suffered great losses. (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Shao Lizi Returns to Beijing <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Fan Pujiang Arrives in Jinan to Discuss the Resolution of Shi's Remnants</p>
<p>A Jinan announcement states that Shao Lizi, the Secretary-General of the Land, Sea, and Air Force Headquarters, came to Jinan by order of the Central Committee to discuss with Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, how to deal with Shi Yousan. Now that Shi's army has been resolved, and Shandong is as calm as ever, Shao is returning to Beijing to report. The unfinished task here will be handled by Jiang Bocheng and Han in close contact. Therefore, Shao, along with his wife and secretary Peng Xuehuan, took the Pingpu No. 201 train back to Beijing this morning. At 8:00 AM this morning, Shao first went to the provincial government to say goodbye. Han then kept Shao for breakfast and made final consultations on the measures to accept Shi's army. After breakfast, Shao, along with his wife, Chairman Han, his wife, Education Director He Siyuan, Agriculture and Mining Director Wang Fangting, Construction Director Zhang Honglie, Finance Director Wang Xiangrong, Provincial Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, Salt Transport Envoy Yuan Lichen, etc., left the provincial government by car to the station. All the way from the provincial government to the station, the guards were increased. Inside the platform, Yang Xigeng, the deputy head of the pistol brigade's second regiment, led a company of soldiers to guard and escort them. Those who came to the station to see them off included Jiang Bocheng and his wife, Deputy Commander Zhang's representative Ge Guangting, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, and Public Security Director Wang Kairu. When Shao arrived at the station, the train had not yet arrived, so Shao waited in the lounge. At that time, Shao told reporters that Chairman Han upheld justice and acted as a pillar in the middle of the river to solve the problem of Shi's army. Therefore, it was able to be resolved in the shortest possible time, making the situation in the north safe again. The results of this visit were satisfactory, and Commander-in-Chief Jiang and Deputy Commander Zhang were very satisfied. Now that Shi's army is no longer a problem, Yu may go to Nanchang after Beijing to report the process to the Commander-in-Chief, but it is still not certain. Han Fuju also told reporters that Shi's army is now retreating to Shenze. The Central Committee ordered Yu to be responsible for accepting Shi's army, and he will of course comply with the order. However, the distance is too far, and Shi's army may not actually flee to Shandong. Even if he comes, Yu will welcome him, because the main force of Shi is the Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe troops, which are of good quality. If Shi comes in person, as long as he leaves the team, Commander-in-Chief Jiang is magnanimous and will definitely protect his personal safety. As for the troops newly collected by Shi, most of them are bandits and their discipline is too bad. If they come to Shandong, they will definitely harass the local people, which Yu will not welcome. Now we have made full preparations for accepting Shi's army, and we will further explore the trends of Shi's army and deal with them temporarily. It was also said that the issue of clearing the countryside in Shandong and Henan is currently being planned. The Pingpu No. 201 train then entered the station, and Deputy Zhang's representative Fan Pujiang took the car to Jinan. The important people first welcomed Mr. Fan, and then sent Shao on the train. According to Fan, the mission of this visit was to report the battle between the Northeast Army and Shi Yousan's army to Chairman Han on behalf of the Deputy Commander, and to bring the Deputy Commander's handwritten letter, which stated that if a small number of Shi's troops fled into Shandong, please Chairman Han be responsible for resolving the issue to avoid disturbing the local people. Shi's army is now fleeing southeast from Shulu, and most of them have crossed the Hutuo River. There were no major losses on both sides in this battle. Because the Deputy Commander advocated peace and did not want to start a war, he retreated to Shijiazhuang, then to Zhengding, and then to Wangdu. It was hoped that Shi would finally realize his mistake. Shi's army advanced step by step, forcing them to more than ten miles away from Baoding. The Deputy Commander believed that the opportunity was imminent and could not retreat any further. The conflicts began with Shi's army, and the soldiers were fortunate enough to be able to solve it quickly, without causing great chaos in the local area. It was fortunate. At that time, Shao Lizi talked with Fan, and Shao asked whether Shi's army had fled to southern Shanxi. Fan replied that there was none, and said that most of the artillery of Shi's army was lost. The Second Army Commander of the Northeast Army, Wang Shuchang, has withdrawn to Machang from the front line, but the cavalry is still in the front line to intercept Shi's army. The whereabouts of Shi Yousan are still unknown. When it was ten o'clock, the car arrived and started. Shao Lizi and his wife boarded the car, and Han and Fan Pujiang Ge Guangting Jiang Bocheng went to the provincial government to meet and hosted a banquet for Fan. (August 4th)</p>

<p>A Brief Account of Korean Customs and Topography: In the North and South Pyeongan Provinces, the Gyeonggi, Hwanghae, and Gangwon Provinces of Korea, mountain ranges stretch continuously and endlessly, without vast plains or wilderness. Only the basins of the Daedong River and the Jin River have relatively lower terrain. Because the Hwanghae Province is close to the coast, the land is still fertile and agricultural products are abundant. The other provinces rely solely on the two water sources of the Daedong and Jin Rivers to divert water to grow rice. The main agricultural product is rice, followed by sorghum and soybeans. Grains are also planted occasionally. The population is extremely dense, with a large village every one or two li. Due to the population, the fields of the wealthy are at most 100 square feet, with each square foot being six feet square. Ordinary families cultivate only four or five square feet. There are many people who are alone and rely on their own strength. The only way to maintain a livelihood is to work hard. Therefore, the majority of the people in Korea are laborers. Most ordinary people do not engage in production. Those with land rent it out to others and live off the rent. Men sit indoors all day long, drinking alcohol from large bowls, or seeking two or three companions to play chess in the mountains and forests, spending their leisurely and happy years, regardless of drought, flood, or chaos. The poor are hired to work for others, but they are often unwilling to work hard, and the rewards they receive are used to consume liquor. In each city, town, and village, there are no places to sell drinks. The only places available are the restaurants that sell alcohol. There are two types of alcohol. The expensive one is like the old wine of our country, and the inferior one is like rice water, the color of horse urine. Usually, five cents (Japanese money) buys a bowl. Koreans who are traveling or working and thirsty buy several bowls and drink them like cattle. The wine is called "Makgeolli." The reporter once bought and tasted it. It tastes bitter and slightly salty, and its turbidity is nauseating. I don't know why Koreans are so fond of it. Koreans do not save. There is no overnight food in the house, even among the wealthy. Every day after breakfast, men and women go back and forth to the towns and villages, either carrying a pot or a bag. All of them are buying food. Most of their time is spent on this. The lack of value of time is most evident among Koreans. Those who live in Sinuiju cross the river to Andong every day to buy food. They travel more than ten li back and forth, running under the scorching sun, without considering it a hardship. It is truly a strange thing. Most of the houses of ordinary families are made of thatched grass and mud, and the architecture is extremely poor, all the same, without any new patterns. The rooms are short, and one must bend over to enter. Facing the door is an earthen kang, and the stove is located at one end, dug into the ground without piling it up. When burning, the room is filled with thick smoke, but those who drink and play chess are calm in the room, without diminishing their interest. The more well-off wealthy families, or those listed in the gentry class, cover the roof with tiles, and carve wood into lattices. Inside the room, there is a front room, an outer room, and an inner room. Family members rest in the inner room, and do not come out even when guests arrive, which strictly separates men and women. Most of the food is millet (grain). Although rice is produced, they do not grind it themselves. Guests</p>
<h3 id="e84">Overseas Chinese Children in Incheon <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>They consider cold noodles to be a superior dish. The method involves pounding rice into noodles, pressing them through a sieve-like device to create thin strands, and then boiling them before putting them into cold water. They are combined with sour and spicy ingredients and are even given as a supreme gift. However, when we [Chinese] eat it, even those who have lived in Korea for a long time frown and find it hard to swallow. Very few are engaged in commerce. If they do business at all, they only sell rice and cloth. Their shops are generally crude and small, with goods piled haphazardly on earthen platforms. The so-called clerks, shop assistants, managers, and boss's wives sit around in the room, leaning against the goods, playing chess or drinking wine. When tired, they lean back against the piles of goods and take a nap. Even when customers come, they barely open their eyes to look and do not bother to serve them, continuing their dream journeys. This fundamentally deprives them of the ability to compete with our fellow overseas Chinese. Therefore, hardly one in a hundred Koreans engages in business profitably. There are two styles of marriage, new and old. The new style is mostly practiced by young students, with simple wedding and engagement procedures, often held in a church. The old style is largely like ours in China, except that the woman keeps her eyes tightly shut from the moment she gets into the sedan until she arrives at her husband's home, forbidden to open them, otherwise it is considered inauspicious. The concept of female chastity is not as strict as before, and there are many free marriages. For both men and women, clothing styles have remained the same for hundreds of years. In summer, they all wear white summer cloth. Women's clothing, with an upper garment and lower skirt, follows the ancient system. However, in the capital [Seoul], skirts are still light green; in Pyongyang, still black; and in other places, still white. Men's trousers are particularly baggy, allowing them to retract their heads into the trousers at night, as if in a bag, sleeping soundly without fear of mosquito bites. This is also a special system. Although overseas Chinese have lived in Korea for a long time, very few marry Korean women. It is not that Chinese and Koreans cannot intermarry, but rather that once a Korean woman is married, her relatives come to bother them every day, either staying for a long time or leaving and returning. Entertaining and treating them is a small matter, but providing gifts upon their departure is hard to sustain. If there are no gifts, they take and carry things away themselves, without the host's consent. If the supply is not maintained, then they have no choice but to divorce. The old Korean palace in the capital, now a relic of the fallen dynasty, has been converted by the Japanese into Changgyeongwon Park, divided into botanical and zoological gardens and a museum. The palace architecture resembles the Manchu Qing palaces of Shengjing [Mukden]. All Korean relics, stone coffins, sarcophagi, Buddhist sutras, pottery, and clothing, are displayed inside. Many Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people visit. The zoo's collection is particularly rich, with lions, elephants, tigers, leopards, walruses, crocodiles, and other species, amounting to more than a dozen kinds, representing a large-scale animal collection. There are no bandits anywhere in Korea. People do not lock their doors at night, and no one picks up lost items on the road. This is ostensibly due to the power of Japanese politics, but in reality, even though Koreans are so poor they don't even have a foothold, they also lack the courage to resort to desperate measures.</p>

<p>Tens of Thousands of Refugees in Hankou After Four Days of Flooding</p>
<p>Dikes Along the Riverbank in Wuchang Are in Danger of Breaching</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that after the Dan Shuichi dike and the railway tunnel gate successively breached, Hankou was completely flooded. After four days, the people have been displaced and uprooted. The misery is too dreadful to witness. On the Wuchang side, the Sai Hu dike and the Xu Jia Peng riverbank are also showing signs of danger and may not last. The authorities are trying to take care of both sides and are overwhelmed. We, the remaining survivors, can only await death with our hands tied. I, as one of the refugees, witnessed this flood and was unable to prevent the catastrophe. I will write down the tragedy of the Wuhan disaster and the suffering of the people, and proclaim it to the whole country, hoping that those who care about the disaster in Hubei will hear about it.</p>
<p>Hankou area On the second day, at 12:00 noon, floodwaters poured into Hankou, flooding the entire city. On the third, fourth, and fifth days, the water level has not receded slightly. In higher-lying areas, the water is more than a foot or several feet deep. In low-lying areas, it is as deep as twenty feet. People are supporting the old and carrying the young, sheltering in the water, and some are squatting on rooftops. Most of the government employees are staying in hotels, or traveling back and forth in the city by car or boat. The contrast is quite striking, with some enjoying luxury and others in misery. When the flood first arrived, people did not have time to escape, and many died. The area where the Dan Shuichi tunnel gate breached suffered especially heavy casualties. Every day, about two to three hundred corpses are found, often tied together with straw ropes. The corpses of pigs and cows are everywhere, which is also miserable. The exact number of dead and injured has not yet been investigated, but the number of refugees has reached 220,000, or even more than that. The Flood Relief Association has expanded the refugee shelters to eight locations and has added 20 staff members to the relief section, with Huang Wenzhi as the director-general and Cai Fuqing and others as staff members, to engage in relief work. The city party headquarters and the Second Bandit Suppression Propaganda Office have also organized a慰问队to purchase food and medicine and transport them by boat to distribute in the disaster area. Major shops and charitable organizations have also organized rescue teams to provide relief in different directions. Initially, prices rose more than double. After the commander of the military camp strictly prohibited it, prices have decreased slightly. There is a great shortage of grain and rice. Chairman He Chengjun has telegraphed General Commander Jiang [Chiang Kai-shek] and Chairman Lu Dipin of Jiangxi to purchase 100,000 piculs of rice in Jiangxi to transport to Hankou for relief. In terms of public security, thanks to the effective maintenance of the military and police, it is still stable. In addition to the original garrison troops, more than eight additional battalions have been dispatched to control the area near Wuhan. On one hand, the military camp has issued instructions to its subordinates to investigate criminals and prevent riots, and has established four measures: (1) Local officials and gentry should conduct a household census in their respective jurisdictions, and any new arrivals to hotels without guarantors should be expelled; (2) Strictly prevent petty thieves and pay attention to normally restless vagrants; (3) Local jurisdictions where disturbances occur will result in punishment of officials and gentry; (4) Government employees should go to their offices to work and not stay in hotels. As for the accumulated water in Hankou, 20,000 yuan has been allocated on the fifth to build a long embankment from Minquan Road to the Japanese concession, using machines to drain the water out. It is scheduled to start construction on the sixth and drain the water by the tenth. However, when planning to drain the street water, the embankments at Qiaokou, Huangjingtang, Pizi Street, and the Pacific Soap Factory became critical again. He Chengjun has ordered the mayor of Hankou, He Baohua, and the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, Chen Keming, to find ways to carry out emergency repairs. If there is another breach, they will be held accountable. It is reported that He and Chen have already been attacked for their ineffective rescue efforts and failure to carry out repairs when the Dan Shuichi breach occurred, and He has also been impeached by the provincial and city party headquarters. Now that they have received this strict order, they know that they cannot delay any longer, so the footsteps of the two have already been seen at Qiaokou, Huangjingtang, and other places in recent days.</p>
<p>Wuchang area The terrain of Wuchang is slightly higher than that of Hankou. After Hankou was flooded, many disaster victims crossed the river to seek refuge, all regarding it as paradise. Unexpectedly, after the Wuqing Gate embankment breached, the water inside the Wutai Gate was also level with the Wuqing Gate, gradually threatening to inundate this majestic city. On the fourth day, Zhengjie Street outside the Baoan Gate was flooded by three feet, and Shoushan Temple Street, Sai Bao Alley, and Minglun Street were all flooded. At the same time, the Sai Hu dike and the Xu Jia Peng riverbank outside the Tongxiang Gate were in extreme danger. Fang Dazhi, the director of the Construction Department, went to inspect after hearing the news and ordered the blockade of Pinghu Gate, Yuecheng two city gates and the lake, the Wenchang Gate city gate cave and culvert, the Wangshan Gate city gate and culvert, the Qing Shiqiao culvert, the Xiaodongcheng, the Dadongmen South Radio Station, the Renhui Bridge, Shisiying, Yunjia Bridge, Tanhualin, Wusheng Gate, and other culverts one after another. The Mada Gate ditch and the total drainage ditch outside the Tongxiang Gate are currently flowing outward. Once blocked, the water will accumulate in the city, so the ditch mouths are lined with burlap sacks, and they will be blocked only when necessary. According to those who know the terrain well, reinforcing the embankments and blocking the ditches is only a temporary solution. For a foolproof plan, the bridge holes in the Tongxiang Gate area should be blocked as soon as possible, and a long embankment should be added between the Changchun Temple and the railway. Sandbags should also be used to build an embankment in the Bowen College, Dongyue Temple area, so that even if the Sai Hu dike collapses, Wuchang can be safe. According to the personnel guarding the Sai Hu dike, the embankment protection project is not large, but they are suffering from the lack of necessary materials, and sometimes they are at a loss as to what to do. For example, in the middle section where the water cave is leaking, there is a lack of wooden piles, and the leaking water continues to seep in, which is very distressing. This situation is indeed real, because the Hubei province's dike funds have been embezzled by local merchants. At a time when the provincial treasury is extremely tight, how can there be surplus funds to allocate? The authorities cannot shirk their responsibility.</p>
<p>Aftermath measures The Flood Relief Association, considering the seriousness of the disaster, has formulated four aftermath measures and jointly issued a notice with the provincial government yesterday, which reads: "Considering that the flood in our province this time is extremely serious, unprecedented since the Daoguang era of the Qing Dynasty, the rivers and streams have risen together, and the dikes have collapsed. All counties have suffered the same devastation, and the provincial towns have become swamps. The people are displaced and flock to Wuhan, where the summer heat is oppressive, scorching above and humid below. They are perched precariously, and it is difficult to find a full meal. The sight is heartbreaking. Our government and association are aware of the catastrophe and the hardship of the times. We are now proposing plans to help the people in need and have decided on the following four measures: (1) Resettling the displaced. There are many refugees in this flood. In the suburbs of Wuhan alone, according to the survey reports, on both sides of the river, inside and outside the railway, from Wuqing Gate to Dan Shuichi, there are valleys and pits filled with people crying out for food. If we do not immediately take measures to resettle them, they will inevitably be stranded and become even more displaced. In addition to repeatedly sending letters and orders to the Hankou Municipal Government, the Public Security Bureau, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, the Wuchang County Office, and social organizations to repeatedly inspect and provide relief at any time, Chengjun and others have also personally inspected the area to formulate a comprehensive plan. At present, in Wuchang, the yarn, cloth, silk, and hemp four bureaus outside Wenchang Gate and the Kai Zi camp and other places have been selected for resettlement. In Hankou, the Charity Association, Wanshou Palace, Xinshi Marketplace, Xinhua Company, Changsha Guildhall, and various hotels have been selected for resettlement. For those who are floating on the water, the association has hired many ships, selected staff members, and planted flags and signs to guide them to the designated locations for rest. (2) Relieving the famine. Once the disaster victims have a place to stay, we should rush to provide relief. It is found that there is nothing better to relieve hunger than cooking porridge, and cooking porridge requires rice. In this flood, rice prices have skyrocketed. In the emergency relief, we must separately arrange cooking porridge and selling rice at low prices according to the urgency and priority. Regarding the matter of cooking porridge, in Wuchang, disaster victim certificates have been prepared. Those who are verified to be genuine will be temporarily issued three yuan per household. It is also planned to separately sell 160,000 piculs of rice at low prices to relieve the market and maintain the people's food supply. With supply and demand in balance, both the gentry and the refugees will receive real benefits. (3) Preventing the spread of epidemics. After a major disaster, there are bound to be many epidemics. The old and weak are gathered together, and if one person dies suddenly, germs will spread everywhere. Therefore, preventing epidemics is listed after resettling the displaced as the most important task in disaster relief. In addition to sending letters to the provincial and municipal hospitals, assigning doctors to carry medicines and go to the resettlement centers to provide treatment at any time, the association will also organize a rescue team to inspect the disaster victims and provide emergency aid. As for the remains of those who died suddenly or drowned, the association will collect and bury them to promote humanity and hygiene. (4) Urgently seeking to restore transportation. The flood situation in Hankou is more severe, and there are more households. All transportation issues are particularly important. In recent days, there have been reports of people being electrocuted to death due to water damage to electrical wires, and people falling into the water and dying due to missteps. In addition to requesting the water and electricity company to quickly prevent all dangerous situations where electric shock may occur, the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau are also hiring small boats to facilitate travel. Once the flood recedes slightly, dredging will be carried out. In addition, the government and association will both deliberate on any matters that can serve as a warning for the future and should be carefully planned to ensure a comprehensive plan. As for the disaster situation in various outer counties, we have separately compiled tables to investigate and clarify the truth in order to determine the relief measures. We have also sent telegrams to the county magistrates of various counties to first organize emergency relief and not allow the disaster victims to be scattered and helpless. However, at a time when there are many incidents in the suburbs and the lives of the people are hanging by a thread, looking to the future only increases our vigilance and trepidation. We hope that kind people and gentlemen will either list the advantages and disadvantages, or donate grain and distribute it, or give medicine and clothes, each doing their best to make up for the shortcomings and save the situation. Everything depends on cooperation. In addition to issuing separate orders, we urgently issue this joint notice, hoping that everyone will be fully informed." (August 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Tragic Situation of the Flood in Wuxue <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Wuxue states that since July 10th, there has been continuous heavy rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, and the weather has been unusually cool. For two weeks now, the river water has risen sharply, and the main wharves, such as the Lower City Main Street, the River Street, the New Street, and the Shangguan, Xiaguan, and Chengzu Streets, are all flooded by three to four feet of water. Commerce has therefore come to a standstill. Currently, large and small shops are moving to other locations, causing house prices to skyrocket, increasing by two-thirds compared to normal rental prices. Yesterday, a section of the official embankment in Erfu Street suddenly leaked. Fortunately, the dike watchmen discovered it and reported it to various agencies, which gathered nearby farmers to collect tools for blocking the water and urgently built a temporary earthen dam. They worked through the night in the rain to temporarily prevent any further damage. However, there are also three or four places in the upper and lower official dams that seem quite dangerous. The people are all in a state of extreme panic. Moreover, the water level in the inland lakes has increased even more. Guangwu Auto has been blocked by the water, and ships have also completely stopped running. As a result, the livelihoods of the dockworkers at various stations have been affected, and the company's losses have also been enormous. In addition, the Weiyi Dam in Luocheng reported four dangerous spots the day before yesterday. Villagers have been working day and night to carry out emergency repairs, but despite using wooden rafts and large trees to block the leaks, there has been no effect, so it has already breached. Furthermore, Guangji County, which is a major producer of grain and rice, is said to have been flooded, and the prospects for cotton, hemp, and tobacco in other places are also hopeless. It is reported that this major disaster is unprecedented in decades. The entire county is in a state of panic over food supplies. Moreover, after suffering from banditry for years, they are now facing a devastating flood, so the people's livelihoods in the future are a cause for serious concern.</p>
<h3 id="e89">After the Cheluo Dam Was Opened, A New Dam Was Opened Again <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Nanguan Dam Was Also Secretly Opened</p>
<p>Refugee Shelters Have Been Set Up in Gaoyou City</p>
<p>A dispatch from Gaoyou on the 3rd states that the water level of the Grand Canal in Gaoyou has been rising continuously in recent days. As of yesterday (2nd), it has risen to one zhang, eight chi, and eight cun. The Gaoyou office of the Jiangsu Water Conservancy Bureau received a telegram from the provincial government at 2:00 AM yesterday, ordering the opening of the dam. It also ordered Camp Commander Wang, stationed in Yang, to bring his troops to Gaoyou to assist. After receiving the telegram, Director Mao immediately sent a letter to Magistrate Wang, asking him to dispatch a police team, a Gaobao You patrol team, and the Public Security Bureau to assemble at 5:00 AM yesterday to open the Cheluo Dam. The farmers from the five lower counties who were protecting the dam jumped into the Grand Canal upon seeing the police team approaching to open the dam. Fortunately, they were all rescued and did not drown. At that time, the county magistrates and representatives of various counties also rushed to the scene by boat and consulted with Director Mao. If the water rose again today, the dam would be opened. In the end, both sides sent people to inspect the water level. Upon receiving the report that the water had not increased or decreased, they ordered the police teams to return to the city first. At 3:00 PM, the county party headquarters convened an emergency meeting of various agencies in the county. Suddenly, a telephone report came from Nanmen, stating that the southwest wind had suddenly picked up at this time, the river water had risen sharply, and the canal embankment was in extreme danger. Magistrate Wang immediately joined the county magistrates of various counties, Director Mao of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and the military police and provincial water police stationed in Youcheng to go to open the dam by boat. The farmers protecting the dam stepped forward to prevent the police team from landing. While they were arguing, Camp Commander Wang arrived with his troops to assist, and the dam was finally opened. At that time, there were only over 300 farmers protecting the dam. The thousands of other farmers had heard earlier that the water level could be maintained up to two zhang and thought that the dam would not be opened for the time being, so they had all returned to their villages to harvest rice. After the dam was opened, the farmers protecting the dam all went home in tears, a very tragic sight. At that time, rumors suddenly spread throughout the city, claiming that farmers in Xinghua had dug up the head sluice gates along the river and were planning to dig up the Ximen canal embankment, making it impossible to protect the city of Youcheng. The general residents were all greatly alarmed, and the society became unstable. Fearing that these farmers might actually commit such illegal acts, Magistrate Wang ordered the military police to go to the Ximen, the sluice gates along the river, and the head sluice gates to defend them, and the people's hearts were slightly settled. Today, the Junhe water level is still rising as before. The Yu Wharf water level has reached one zhang and nine chi. It is said that the dam water arrived in Xinghua this afternoon. The second, third, sixth, eighth, and ninth districts of the county have been completely flooded, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Because a famine is emerging, the rice mills in the city have seen the price of rice skyrocket by sixty cents per dan, and there is still a tendency to rise further. The county has suffered successive famines in recent years, and now it has been hit by this flood, which is truly unfortunate for the people of Youcheng.</p>

<p>Jiangdu</p>
<p>A dispatch from Gaoyou on the 6th states that at 6:00 PM yesterday (4th), there was a sudden downpour, accompanied by a strong northwest wind. The Grand Canal's water level suddenly rose from one zhang and nine chi to one zhang, nine chi, and six cun. The waves, driven by the wind, directly washed against the embankment, which was extremely dangerous. All the teachers and staff of the education sector, as well as the employees of various shops and agencies, wore straw sandals and carried high poles and lanterns to work on the embankment. Fortunately, by 8:00 PM, the rain had stopped and the sky had cleared, but the wind was even stronger than before. The new additional sub-embankment at the Miaohangkou and Hehuatang outside the North Gate had collapsed by several feet due to the impact of the huge waves. They immediately sounded the gong to rush to the rescue. After receiving the report, Magistrate Wang immediately ordered Shen Qi, the first platoon leader of the police team, to lead his team to open the new dam together with the Water Conservancy Bureau, and personally rushed to Miaohangkou and Hehuatang to direct the rescue efforts, and the situation was resolved. Unexpectedly, at that time, a new additional sub-embankment on the Ximen Canal embankment suddenly collapsed by several zhang and was extremely dangerous. Suddenly, gongs sounded inside and outside the city, and the people were terrified. Many people climbed onto the city walls to take refuge. Magistrate Wang rushed to Ximen again to supervise the embankment protection work. Before Ximen had escaped the danger, reports of overflowing water came from the Yu Wharf, Tonghu Bridge, and Huayan Temple one after another. Fortunately, there were many workers, and the situation was resolved through emergency repairs. Only at 1:00 AM this morning did the northwest wind stop, and the canal embankment was no longer in danger. The citizens of the entire city did not get a good night's sleep. Residents outside the city, during the extremely dangerous times, all flocked to the city to take refuge. Today, the water level of the canal embankment, due to the cessation of the wind, the Yu Wharf water level has dropped to one zhang, nine chi, and three cun. It is now learned that the Nanguan Dam was also secretly opened last night. Magistrate Wang has ordered the accumulation of soldiers at the four city gates this morning to block the north and south water gates in preparation for closing the four city gates in the event of an extremely dangerous situation to prevent accidents, and refugee shelters have been established in the city. It has been determined that the public education center, Qianming Temple, Yaowang Temple, and other 40 locations will be used as the shelter sites. At around 10:00 AM this morning, a gong sounded again, reporting that the moat near the city had broken and the head sluice gate was leaking. Upon hearing the alarm, the general residents were greatly alarmed. Each family was busy building water pavilions, because if these two locations were to fail, the water would flood into the city. Fortunately, after emergency repairs, there are no problems. Currently, the three dams in You territory have been opened. If the canal water continues to rise, the people of the entire city of You will likely be buried in the bellies of fish. (August 5th)</p>
<p>A dispatch from Zhenjiang states that since the Cheluo Dam was opened on the 2nd, the water level of the canal in Jiangsu province has continued to rise. On the 3rd, the Yu Wharf rose by one cun, with a water level of one zhang, eight chi, and nine cun. Mao Yisheng, the director of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, and the resident engineers sent by the various departments of the provincial government,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>telegraphed the provincial government from Gaoyou to report the increase in the water level, saying that it was not enough to relieve the crisis without continuing to open the Nan (Nanguan Dam) and Xin (New Dam) dams. Director Mao returned to the provincial government on the 4th to attend the provincial government meeting and reported everything. It was decided that if the water level continued to rise and was deemed critical, the Nan and Xin dams would be allowed to continue to be opened. It was reported to the Water Conservancy Bureau that the Yu Wharf water level had increased by one cun each on the 4th and 5th, with a water level of one zhang, nine chi, and one cun. Therefore, the Xin Dam, which drains into the sea, was opened again yesterday. The Nanguan Dam has already overflowed, and it will inevitably be opened within days. As for Yaowan Yishui, it suddenly surged by one meter and fifteen centimeters on the 4th, with a water level of nineteen meters and twenty-six centimeters. The Huai River in Bengbu fell by five centimeters, with a water level of nineteen meters and eighty-six centimeters.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Yangzhou states that the canal's water level was initially expected to gradually decrease after the Cheluo Dam was opened. Unexpectedly, in the past three days, the water flow along the canal has still been increasing. As of the 5th, the Gaoyou Yu Wharf water level had risen by two cun again, with a total water level of one zhang, nine chi, and one cun. Therefore, the New Dam was opened again yesterday, and the Nanguan Dam also overflowed, and it will inevitably be opened within days. However, after these two dams are opened, whether the disaster in the counties of the Lixia River will not worsen is a major question. Furthermore, although the dams continue to be opened, if the water continues to rise, it will inevitably lead to breaches. Therefore, the provincial government and the Pacification Supervisory Office view protecting the embankments and rescuing them as the only task amidst the calls to open the dams. It was recently heard that the Jiangdu County Government received a telegram from the provincial government, relayed by the Water Conservancy Bureau, stating that the canal embankments should be protected by the various construction offices, which should convene civilians to protect them in order to avoid breaches. After receiving the telegram, the county government immediately ordered Section Chief Lu Shiquan of the Second Section to go to Shaobo Town to supervise and manage the matter and protect the people's fields. Furthermore, Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Supervisor, believed that the matter required the joint efforts of the military and the administrative aspects due to the severe flooding, and yesterday issued a general order that the troops stationed along the canal should unanimously maintain the river embankment. As for how to handle the matter, they should contact Section Chief Qian and Director Mao of the Water Conservancy Bureau, who were sent by the provincial government, at any time for proper consultation.

However, the Construction Bureau has not complied with the directive from the Executive Yuan to move the original screen wall in for reconstruction. The general preservationist faction believes that the Director of the Construction Bureau has violated orders and neglected duties, and they are very dissatisfied. As for the demolished bowl shop owners, they also believe that the Construction Bureau has violated laws and colluded to exert pressure. After appealing to the Hubei Compatriots Association in Shanghai, the association sent four people, including Wang Bu and Cheng, to Suzhou yesterday (the 6th) to petition the county government, demanding the removal and punishment of the Director of the Construction Bureau.</p>

<p>Reasons for Police Detectives Arresting the District Head: On the night of the 31st of last month, Fang Guozhen, a secret agent from the county police team, and Liu Wenjin, an informant, led the arrest of Sun Jinxi, Sun Sanguan, Wang Goulang, and Yin Xiaojianzi, the perpetrators of the robbery case at the home of Huang Guangen in Lanmen Sha in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic. At that time, Chen Xipei, a neighbor, opened the door to investigate because Wang Goulang's wife was calling for help. Fang Guozhen and others called him a communist, beat him with ropes, and dragged him to Wang Guangen's house for private interrogation. After Ding Jinshu, Gu Changyuan, and others intervened, he was released after paying 20 yuan, with 10 yuan paid now and the remaining to be paid in three days. Chen, suffering this injustice, went to the Third District Office to petition the District Head, Xu Kuizheng, to investigate. Xu then sent militiamen to arrest the perpetrators, but Fang Guozhen and others had already fled. He also questioned Wang Goulang and others, who all stated that Fang Guozhen had extorted money in the dark. Later, they were sent to the Houcheng Third Sub-Bureau. Fang Guozhen went to the county to report that Chen Xipei had extorted money and released the perpetrators, feigning injury for verification, and obtained Order No. 2 from the county. On the 3rd, he brought seven policemen from the Wangjiadai Police Team to the District Office to demand the release of the people. Xu claimed that the group had been sent to the Houcheng Third Sub-Bureau. Fang went to the Third Sub-Bureau, asking them to hand over the people. Director Zhang of the Sub-Bureau replied that since the bandits were sent by the Third District Office, they should still be sent to the Third District Office, and there was no reason for him to hand them over. Fang then went to the District Office again. District Head Xu stated that since there was no private seal of the trial officer on the warrant, he could not release the people. Fang became furious and, together with the seven policemen, arrested District Head Xu and escorted him to the city. The township heads of the district believed that the District Head was the leader of the entire district and was arrested and humiliated by Fang Guozhen. This not only lacked legal basis but also caused a loss of face for the entire district. They held a meeting yesterday (the 4th) and unanimously agreed to rescue him, demanding that the county government dismiss Fang Guozhen and punish him severely. They appointed Zhong Yanxin, Sun Xueshan, and others as representatives to petition the county. In the afternoon, District Head Xu personally presented the case to County Magistrate Peng, demanding strict handling according to the law. This afternoon, after summoning Chen Xipei, Wang Goulang, Fang Guozhen, and others for questioning, further action will be taken.</p>
<p>Court Interrogation of Conflict Between Militia Police and the Big Sword Society: Zhang Guangde, a small shop owner of Yongji Noodle Shop in Houcheng, Second District, and a member of the business militia, was taken away by the Big Sword Society (local defense group) of Zhuxiang, Zhouzhuang. This was because Zhang was implicated by Gu Zigen, who claimed that he had participated in the robbery case at the home of Sha Tingxiang. The Houcheng Business Militia and the Third Sub-Bureau of Public Security went to search, resulting in a conflict. At the same time, Zhou Jigen was killed, and Xu Bingxiang and Ding Zuomei were drowned. All eight people arrested on both sides, including Hou Youwang, Li Yaoting, Sun Chufa, Zhang Guangde, Gu Zigen, Zhu Kunru, Zhu Jinyan, and Song Shanlang, were interrogated by Trial Officer Wu on the afternoon of the 3rd. Each person's testimony differed. Zhang Guangde and others arrested by the Zhouzhuang side denied being bandits, and Hou Youwang and others newly arrested by Houcheng denied being members of the Big Sword Society. As a result, all were released on bail pending further questioning.</p>

Over the years, the interest accumulated to more than 400 yuan. However, due to changes in municipal administration, these funds have been repeatedly transferred. Recently, due to sudden floods, the dykes in the entire district are about to breach. Farmers have petitioned the District Office to allocate these funds for dyke construction. However, after investigation, only 200 yuan remained. The remaining principal and interest were all embezzled by the former District Head, Hu Zhongfang.

<p>Communist Party Horrifyingly Murders the District Head: Shawan, Guangde, is located in a remote mountainous area. In recent years, the Communist bandits have been entrenched and extremely rampant. Although the garrison troops have been dispatched to suppress them, it is still difficult to completely eradicate them due to the thick mountains and forests. On the 2nd of this month, the newly appointed District Head Yang of the Fifth District of the county went from the city to take office. The escorting military police consisted of about 60 people. On the way, they were suddenly surrounded by a large number of Communist bandits when passing through Banbiantian. Banbiantian is a notoriously dangerous mountain valley, with narrow sheep trails that can only accommodate one person at a time. On the left is a steep mountain, and on the right is a small river. At that time, the military police were outnumbered, and the terrain was cramped, so after a fierce battle for 20 minutes, they retreated with cover from box cannons. It is estimated that four officers and soldiers were killed on the spot. The new District Head Yang was captured and horribly murdered. Four quick-firing guns, 200 bullets, and 800 yuan in military pay were lost. It is also heard that the Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau also lost some tax revenue, and the tax collector Chen suffered minor injuries.</p>

<p>Aftermath of the Second Flood: Hefei has been in a state of misery since the second flood on the 25th and 26th. Many people have been left homeless. The Red Cross has specially set up shelters to provide porridge and meals, reaching over a thousand people in a single day. However, the flood victims in the northwest city are blaming Zheng Yaotang, who is responsible for the Shuixi Gate dam, for handling the situation poorly. Furthermore, they are blaming the Gu Lou Bridge circle, which has been blocked by business firms, and the Jiu Shi Bridge circle, which has been occupied by poor people, for causing the unrest. On the afternoon of the 27th, people from all walks of life held a meeting at the First Public Office to discuss and resolve the matter. They presented a report to the county requesting that Zheng be dealt with, either by fining him 400 yuan or by parading him through the streets with a cangue. They requested that the County Government Construction Bureau send workers to dredge the Gu Lou and Jiu Shi Bridge circles and raise funds to repair the city's rivers. They also appointed dozens of people to form a water disaster relief and temporary river dredging committee.</p>

<p>Respectfully, I read in your newspaper's August 4th local communications column, under the Wuxi section, that Qingcheng City, Qianzhou, Yuqi, Beiqi, and other places have ordered a total of 360,000 tiger-branded silkworm seeds from the Dayou Seed Manufacturing Plant. Currently, various merchants, knowing that the mulberry trees are submerged in water and the mulberry leaves are withered, believe that it is not suitable for the silkworms to eat them, so they have no intention of raising them and have been returning them to the seed manufacturing plant. This is absolutely not true. The information reported in your newspaper must be based on false rumors. Please disclose this letter to clarify the situation and avoid misunderstandings. Respectfully, Hushu Pass Dayou Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant, 8.5.</p>

<p>Recently, I read a news item in the local communications column of your newspaper on August 5th regarding the "election dispute of provincial and national representatives" in Nanhui. It does not conform to the facts. On the 2nd, the county held a re-election meeting for representatives to the Provincial Representative Assembly. Prior to the meeting, the department sent employees to different district branches, and those that qualified as a representative were selected by the law. There were 35 representatives. That day nineteen showed up, and the Provincial Rectification Committee sent the fifth-district instructor, Li Songjiao, to supervise. Around 2:00 pm, Zhu Baozhong and other five representatives asked to meet with the supervisors and left, delayed until 3:20. The supervisor, seeing the statutory number of representatives, and having surpassed the stated deadline, announced the meeting would begin. So-called refusal of representation, the department informed attendants of that fact. How could they be rejected afterwards? There is no reason or fact for this at all. Especially the mention of heavy weaponry and an intense environment, it's completely unheard of. That day, six police officers were dispatched to maintain order. It is feared that confusion would be spread. I ask that you place the original message in the incoming message section to illuminate the truth. Nanhui County Party Department Rectification Committee, August 6th.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Hunan Education Circles Petition for the Completion of Independent Education Funding <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The education circles of Hunan have been tirelessly advocating for the independence of education funding for several years. Although the Executive Yuan approved a surcharge of two yuan and three jiao per package of foreign salt, only eight jiao per package was actually received, amounting to just over 90,000 yuan per month. The monthly education budget for Hunan requires 300,000 yuan. If the full amount were allocated (over 260,000 yuan per month), it could barely be sustained. However, the current shortfall is significant, making it difficult to maintain. Therefore, after deliberation by representatives of various schools, in addition to sending Fang Kegang, Hu Yuantan, and other representatives to explain the situation to the central government, a formal petition was submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Education, based on the Provisional Constitution, requesting the direct allocation of funds from the salt tax or customs duties to achieve independence. The text of the petition to the Executive Yuan is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition for the Implementation of the Central Government's Previously Approved Independent Education Funding, in Accordance with the Provisional Constitution, to Safeguard and Maintain Education: It is noted that Hunan Province's education funding was once allocated eight jiao from the salt tax surcharge and managed independently, which proved convenient for many years. Subsequently, due to the gradual development of education, with annual needs exceeding three million yuan, the originally allocated eight jiao per package proved to be significantly insufficient. Education circles therefore submitted a petition to the government in the spring of the 18th year of the Republic, requesting the allocation of one yuan and five jiao from the salt tax surcharge in Hunan, totaling over 260,000 yuan per month, to achieve the independence of education funding. This was approved by the Executive Yuan in May of that year, reported to the National Government for record, and the Ministry of Finance was instructed to transfer the allocation, while the Ministry of Education notified the Hunan Education Department for information. In May of the 19th year, the Hunan Special Finance Commissioner was instructed by the Ministry of Finance to allocate additional funds. Subsequently, upon reading reports that the salt tax surcharge had a limited term and was to be collected by the Ministry of Finance, academic circles expressed concern that Hunan's education funding was fundamentally threatened. They detailed the special difficulties in Hunan Province and petitioned the Executive Yuan to maintain the established case and complete independence, and appointed Hu Yuantan, Lei Zhuohuan, and eight others to go to Beijing to fight for it. Unexpectedly, last year, the Ministry of Finance unified the salt tax, still calculating based on the old amount of eight jiao, resulting in only 93,100 yuan per month being allocated by the Hunan Salt Transportation Bureau. Consequently, Hunan Province's education funding suffered a monthly deficit of 174,000 yuan. It is considered that Hunan has been plagued by banditry and natural disasters for many years, and its financial constraints are even more severe than before. Various schools are struggling to survive due to limited funding, while the public's knowledge is gradually increasing, leading to a growing number of applicants to schools. However, schools are unable to accommodate them all, leaving young people wandering aimlessly, which is a major hidden danger for the country. Furthermore, during the period of political tutelage, education is a fundamental construction. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen clearly stated in his political program the need to increase education funding. This year's Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China for the Period of Political Tutelage, Article 53 of Chapter 5, also clearly stipulates that the central and local governments should generously allocate necessary funding for education and ensure the security of lawfully independent funding. Currently, the salt tax surcharge of two yuan and three jiao per package, which was approved by the central government for allocation to Hunan Province, is indeed lawfully independent funding. The established case is clear and can be reviewed. Hunan is suffering from the aftermath of chaos, with impoverished people and depleted resources. Even if the central government does not generously allocate education funding, the one yuan and five jiao of this lawfully independent education funding of two yuan and three jiao should be protected by the Provisional Constitution and implemented. Kegang and others, in order to comply with the Provisional Constitution and complete the independence of Hunan Province's education funding, respectfully petition your Excellency with three requests: (1) The previously approved additional allocation of one yuan and five jiao from the salt tax surcharge, totaling 174,000 yuan per month, is requested to be implemented from the Hunan salt tax surcharge and directly transferred to the Hunan Provincial Education Funding Management Committee for safekeeping, in accordance with the established case. (2) Alternatively, please approve the allocation of 174,000 yuan per month from the Changsha Customs duties as Hunan Province's education funding, and instruct Changsha Customs to comply and directly issue the funds nearby. (3) If not allocated from Changsha Customs duties, then please directly allocate 174,000 yuan per month from the central government as Hunan Province's education funding, to be transferred to the Hunan Provincial Education Funding Management Committee for safekeeping. These requests are made only because of special difficulties, and we would not dare to repeatedly implore. However, the Provisional Constitution is a creed to be observed by all, and the independence of the above-mentioned education funding is an established case approved by the central government. Based on facts and legal principles, these are not excessive demands. We earnestly request your Excellency's prompt consideration and clear implementation, so that Hunan Province's lawfully independent education funding can have a reliable guarantee. We are at the point of anxiously awaiting orders, and we respectfully submit this petition.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Anhui Education Department Organizes Provincial School Properties <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Apart from a portion of the school properties under the Anhui Education Department being houses in Anqing City, the remainder are river islands. Lai Zi Island in Huaining County belongs to the Provincial Education Association and is currently temporarily managed by the department. Da Sha Tu in Fanchang County, Ba Du Lake in Dongliu County, and Chongwen Island and Tieban Island in Tongcheng County are all directly under the jurisdiction of the department. In view of the complex conditions of these river islands and the frequent changes in land, it is impossible to verify the actual number of acres. The rents and taxes collected in the past, due to the customary practice of assigning personnel to collect taxes according to acreage, only totaled over 10,000 yuan per year, making it difficult to achieve substantial improvements. It is necessary to immediately conduct a land survey and organize these properties to increase the revenue from school properties. The department has submitted a proposal to the provincial government meeting, requesting instructions on the methods for organizing provincial school properties. It has also drafted a simplified charter for the Provincial School Properties Organization Committee. The proposed committee members, in addition to the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education Departments as ex officio members, will also include several members appointed by the provincial government. The head of the Education Department will concurrently serve as the chairman of the committee. The committee will have three sections: organization, collection, and affairs, responsible for all matters related to their respective sections. This charter has been discussed and approved by the department's affairs meeting and will be implemented upon approval by the provincial government meeting.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Social Education Summer School, held at the Wuxi Education College, has been in session for three weeks. The following is a recent dispatch from the school:</p>
<p>(1) The "Introduction to Social Education" course was originally planned to be taught by Gao Jiansi, the president of the Education College. However, due to Gao's busy official duties and his recent need to go to Zhenjiang to chair the National Vocational Guidance Conference, Yu Qingtang, the head of the Third Section of the Education Department, has been appointed instead. Furthermore, the "Social Problems" course, which Yu Songhua, a professor at the Business School of Central University and editor of the Oriental Magazine, was unable to teach due to a lack of time, has also been assigned to Lei Binnan, the director of academic affairs at the school.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to the scheduled lectures and discussion sessions, in order to enhance the knowledge of the attendees, the school has invited several temporary lecturers. Recent speakers have included Yu Songhua on "Leisure and Life" and "Principles of Social Organization"; Chen Weishi, director of the Provincial Suzhou Library, on "The Lamp of the Night"; Liu Yimou, director of the Provincial National Studies Library, on "The Fundamentals of Public Education"; Liu Shaozhen, a staff member of the Third Section of the Education Department, on "An Urgent Proposal for a Solid Foundation for Social Education"; Hua Yizhi, a bee-keeping expert, on "Various Aspects of Bee-keeping"; and Ma Zongrong, head of the Department of Social Education at Daxia University, on "The Future Path of Social Educators." Li Yunting, director of the Department of Social Education at the Ministry of Education, Liu Pingjiang, former head of education in the capital, Tang Moubo, a professor at Jiaotong University, and Miao Picheng, a member of the Central Committee, will also be giving lectures at the school.</p>
<p>(3) The school is scheduled to last for a total of four weeks. After four weeks, all attendees will be divided into groups and sent to Shanghai, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other places for observation. The observation methods have already been drafted by the school's guidance committee.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Middle and Primary School Teachers Fight for Education Funding <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>| Held Second General Assembly... Vowing Not to Start School Until Goals are Achieved</p>
<p>Since the new standards for Songjiang County's education funding were established in the 17th year of the Republic, they have been barely maintained. Subsequently, due to repeated provincial orders to reduce the living expenses of education personnel, the situation has been deteriorating daily, yet they still struggled to support it. However, after provincial investigator Xu Xihuang arrived in Songjiang to conduct an investigation, he disregarded the facts and falsely reported to the Education Department, resulting in the arbitrary reduction of Songjiang's education funding, making it impossible for teachers and staff to maintain their livelihoods. Forced by these circumstances, they united all the teachers and staff of the county to fight for their rights. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the third general assembly was held in the auditorium of the People's Education Center, with over 300 teachers and staff from middle and primary schools attending. Xu Rensen chaired the meeting, and Tang Zhenzhi served as the secretary. After the formal proceedings, the chairman gave a report, followed by a discussion of the proposals. (1) If a satisfactory solution to the budget for the 20th year of the Republic has not been reached by the time school starts, in addition to each school announcing a temporary postponement of school, should a declaration be printed and posters pasted to inform all sectors of society of the truth? It was resolved to pass this proposal and appoint Mr. Song Renwei and Mr. Chen Guisanyi to draft the declaration, which will be submitted for approval at the next general assembly and then published in major newspapers in Shanghai. (2) Chongming County's education funding has also been arbitrarily reduced by the Education Department. How should this association express its support in a letter requesting assistance? It was resolved that the Education Department's austerity policies affect more than just Songjiang and Chongming counties, and a telegram should be sent to urge the education associations of various counties to organize a provincial education association to take the lead in fighting for their rights to maintain local education. 3. The Education Department's reduction in funding is destroying education. Request that the county's representatives attending the provincial assembly present this issue for discussion and assistance at the assembly. It was resolved to pass this proposal. 4. In the case of the Education Department's reduction in funding, the primary schools have not yet received official documents. An investigation has revealed that they have been shelved by the education committees of each district. Should this association make a statement? It was resolved that this association should send a letter to the education committees of each district, sternly questioning them. The date for the next meeting was set for 1:00 PM on August 12th. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Strange and Terrifying Plants</p>
<p>Dr. Killip of the Smithsonian Institute led a group of scientists to collect plant specimens in the upper reaches of the Amazon River and the mountains of Peru in South America. Despite hardships and setbacks, they achieved remarkable success. In February of last year, they returned to Washington, bringing back no less than thirty thousand species of strange and diverse plants. Some could kill, some could induce bizarre dreams, and some could paralyze fish while leaving their meat edible. Among them were thousands of species previously unknown and unnamed. For example, one type of vine called Ayahuasca, also known as Caapi, is used by native apothecaries to create drugs. When ingested, these drugs cause drastic reactions in the nervous system. Another plant produces a milky sap with anesthetic properties. Native people pour this sap into rivers when fishing, quickly paralyzing the fish across a large area of the river, rendering them helpless. Fishermen then easily capture them one by one. Strangely, the poison does not affect the fish’s meat, which remains edible after cooking and has no unusual taste. The name of this plant, however, remains unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Two Righteous Men on Dongmen Island <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Carefree</p>
<p>Sanmen Bay is located in the center of the national coastline, serving as the gateway to eastern Zhejiang. The land is fertile, and the produce is abundant. Opposite Shipu Town lies Dongmen Island, which is recorded in the Book of Han as Tianmen Mountain. The terrain is extremely dangerous. During the Tang Dynasty, Changguo Garrison was built on the island's summit to guard against pirates. The island is surrounded by water, with raging waves. In foggy or hazy weather, the port becomes indistinguishable even at close range, making it a feared passage for ships. The Tiger Reef, which faces the island, is particularly treacherous. Careless navigation can lead to disaster. Yesterday, I traveled to Sanmen Bay on business and took the opportunity to visit the lighthouse on Dongmen Island. The tower was built by two fishermen brothers, Ren Xiaohe and Xiaofu. It stands over thirty feet tall and houses a kerosene lamp that is lit at night, shining like a solitary star in the darkness, guiding navigators and ensuring safe passage.</p>
<p>The Ren brothers, who make a living by fishing, used their life savings of several thousand gold coins to build the lighthouse. They also constructed two houses next to the tower, with four rooms in the front and three in the back, to provide rest for travelers. The furnishings are elegant, and the walls are adorned with couplets written by Yu Zhishao, Zhang Yishan, Ma Gong, Yu Yutian, and Sui Zengnong, all praising them as righteous men. After building the tower, the Ren brothers' wealth was depleted, and they lived a simple life with coarse clothes and poor food, which is truly commendable. Their deep concern for the benefit of society shames the hoarders of wealth.</p>
<p>When I met the righteous man Xiaohe, he was dressed in a short garment of coarse white cotton cloth, barefooted, with hair hanging down to his shoulders, and a face tanned dark brown, indicating a long history of weathering storms. Yet, his passionate and deep emotions were revealed in his smiles and conversation. The lighthouse requires over seven hundred gold coins annually for oil and other maintenance costs, which they have never sought from outside donations. Instead, they rely on their daily fish sales to cover the expenses. Someone once suggested to the authorities that the lighthouse be taken over by the province to ensure its permanent operation. However, this only resulted in the province claiming insufficient funds and rejecting the proposal. Thus, Ren and his brother continue to brave the waves, endure the wind and rain, and diligently fish to maintain the oil expenses.</p>
<p>After our meeting, the righteous man Ren cordially offered me a meal, featuring delicious aquatic dishes with unique flavors. He also led me to the top of the lighthouse, where I could gaze into the distance, taking in the beautiful scenery of the water and mountains. The sea breeze howled, and my sleeves fluttered, making me feel as if the autumn god had descended to earth. Who would have known that it was the scorching heat of the dog days of summer? After several hours of tea and conversation, I was treated to handmade cakes of lichen and millet flour, which were delicious and unforgettable. Alas, he spends private wealth for public benefit, avoids worldly disputes, and relies on his own efforts. Compared to those who strive for power, profit, fame, and reputation, his virtue is vastly different. I recall the couplet given by Mr. Yu: "Two righteous men in the mountains, the first lighthouse overseas," which is truly fitting. I lingered for half a day and wrote a few words before departing, as a memento. The text reads: "In July of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, I traveled to Sanmen Bay, passing through Shipu and visiting the Tianmen Mountain lighthouse. I was warmly received by the righteous man Ren Xiaohe. After spending half of his life diligently laboring and finding joy in fishing, he spends private wealth to benefit the public and guides the world with a beacon of light. The spirit of benevolence and harmony should be as immortal as this tower. I had heard of him for several years and finally met him today, enjoying the beautiful scenery and the peace of half a day. I am immensely pleased and wrote these words to leave a trace and express my gratitude."</p>

<p>— Xiangheng</p>
<p>Fine rain enshrouds sorrow, aimlessly stirring, spring colors fill the garden, curtains half-drawn. Begonias spread like embroidery, evening mist solidifies green. A parrot startles awake from a dream of fragrant grass, embroidered stationery wears out by a scholar of blue skies. But the courtyard at dusk is quietly empty, crows return urgently. No more to be said, a flute before the wind. Love and hate, still like weaving. Sigh, silken thread, helpless to bind spring. Lonely painted boat on the jade pond, hesitating swallows speaking under carved beams. Facing a cold ten-mile expanse of apricot blossoms on the flat lake, who pities them?</p>
<h3 id="e140">Wuji Boxing <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Silent</p>
<p>The art of combat in our country originates from the practices of nurturing life. The bear-walking, bird-stretching, and five-animal exercises of the life-nurturing schools are derived from the ancient people's leisure activities of music and dance. The transformation of music and dance into life-nurturing practices connects with Taoism. Thus, music and dance represent the whole, while the animal exercises and external strengthening represent parts, each with its own emphasis. During the Five Dynasties period, Bodhidharma resided at Mount Song. Shaolin Temple has a tradition of Bodhidharma's exercises. Later, several of his disciples assisted Emperor Taizong of Tang in defeating Wang Shichong, earning titles. Emperor Taizu of Song once taught his skills to the Shaolin monks, hence the Shaolin tradition of Taizu Boxing. Yue Wu Mu was framed by Qin Hui, and his skills were acquired by the Shaolin monks, thus the Shaolin tradition of Yue Family Hand. Consequently, Shaolin became a general repository of combat techniques. During the Yuan Dynasty, Grandmaster Zhang Sanfeng became acquainted with the Shaolin monks, exchanging Taoist arts with them. After mastering their essence, he modified them into a soft boxing style. He also dreamt of the Xuan Emperor imparting boxing techniques. Later, he secluded himself in Wudang Mountain, leading to the distinction between the Wudang and Shaolin schools. Grandmaster Sanfeng, proficient in elixir studies and versed in the principles of the Book of Changes, created three sets of grand boxing techniques, Wuji, Taiji, and Bagua, each consisting of one hundred and twenty-eight moves (totaling three hundred and eighty-four moves to match the three hundred and eighty-four lines of the Book of Changes). These were secretly treasured by eccentric individuals and passed down privately, resulting in fragmentation and incompleteness. It is not easy to gather even fragments to form a whole. However, those who have obtained the genuine transmission of the three sets of techniques in one breath have maintained a single line of transmission that has never been severed. Mr. Zhou Tianxiang studied under Mr. Peng Zufan of Xuzhou in his youth and obtained the genuine transmission, combining the strengths of both the Wudang and Shaolin schools. He once traveled to Han Gao and now comes to Shanghai. Those who have long admired him gathered fellow enthusiasts and invited Mr. Zhou to demonstrate his skills at Qingliang Temple in the Xin Family Garden. On the second day of the national calendar, Mr. Zhou generously attended the gathering and performed all one hundred and twenty-eight moves of the Wuji Boxing. The exquisiteness of his techniques, the agility of his movements, the solemnity of his expression, and the completeness of his energy circulation were such that only one who had truly grasped the essence of soft boxing could achieve such excellence. Those present at the demonstration included Wu Huichuan, Ye Dami, Ji Rongwu, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Jingbo the old monk, Lü Zibin and his son, Huang Xingruo and his son, a certain lady, and many other guests. After watching the performance, all applauded and praised him. All knowledge in our country originates from the teachings of the Book of Changes. Although much has been lost and scattered, if one can diligently seek, one can find treasures of the past sages everywhere. Boxing is one such example. If Mr. Zhou can make public the three sets of life-nurturing grand boxing techniques and the famous boxing techniques of the Shaolin school in the future, they will not only be suitable for the old and the young, the civil and the martial, prolong life, and prevent illness, but also indirectly release unique splendor from ancient music, dance, and the images of the Book of Changes, strengthening the country and the race, and promoting the ancestors. All of this depends on him. Therefore, I take up my pen to record this. (No payment accepted.)</p>
<h3 id="e141">Stealing Half a Day for a Trip <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Master Embracing Qin</p>
<p>I have long admired the beauty of Tiger Hill, but I have never been able to visit due to being overwhelmed with worldly affairs. A few days ago, the Tianyi Film Company went to Suzhou to film exterior scenes for "Spring Colors on the Singing Stage." Mr. Shao invited me to accompany him, and I took the opportunity to visit Tiger Hill. A wish that had been cherished for years was finally fulfilled, how delightful! The ancients said, "Stealing half a day of leisure from busy life." Now I can say that I have "stolen half a day for a trip from busy life."</p>
<p>That morning, I took a car from the company to the North Station. Soon, the staff and actors also arrived one after another. After getting on the car, laughter and chatter filled the air. Xuan Jinglin was especially witty and amusing. When the car arrived in Suzhou, we got off and immediately filmed exterior scenes of the train station. Zhang Yongcui played a flower seller, wandering on the platform with a flower basket. Those who did not know the truth mistook her for real and even tried to buy flowers from her. After filming at the train station, we took a horse-drawn carriage to the Garden Hotel and filmed another three or five shots before having lunch. By then, it was 1:30 PM. Everyone was very hungry. As soon as the food arrived, spoons and chopsticks flew, and the dishes were quickly emptied, like clouds swept away by the wind. After lunch, everyone returned to Shanghai, while I hired a car to go to the Xuanmiao Temple. When I arrived, I was greatly disappointed, as there was nothing to see except for the stalls. After walking around once, I visited my old classmate, Mr. Wang Shenxuan. Mr. Wang is a famous doctor in Suzhou. We had been separated for almost ten years, and we were very happy to see each other. He accompanied me to visit Tiger Hill. On the way, the mud was everywhere, and the wheels of the car got stuck in the mud and could not move forward. The two coachmen had to push and pull the car to move forward. When we arrived at the gate of Tiger Hill Temple, we got out of the car and walked. Mr. Wang led me around to see almost all the scenic spots, including the Sword Pool and the Thousand-Man Rock, which I had seen in the film "Tang Bohu." It was like revisiting an old place. We went to the Cold Fragrance Pavilion to have tea. The layout of this pavilion is very similar to the Misty Rain Tower in Jiaxing. It is surrounded by plum trees. If it were winter, the faint fragrance and sparse shadows would be even more interesting. Because I was anxious to return to Shanghai, I took a quick look and took a car directly to the train station. On the way, we passed through Shantang Street, where the flood had submerged the banks, half a foot deep. The coachman waded through the water, as if the car was driving on water. This reminded me of when I read Mencius, who thought it was almost humorous to say that Zichan used his carriage to help people cross the Zhen and Wei rivers. I didn't expect to experience it myself today. After arriving at the station, I bought a ticket and boarded the train. The whistle blew, and the wheels turned. Looking out the window, I could still see the North Temple Pagoda standing tall in the hazy twilight.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 7th, after contacting people from both Indian and Islamic religions, I then observed their society. From my observations of India, I have reached some understanding. Moreover, upon looking at historical records, I have come to realize the reason why the Indian and Islamic peoples cannot cooperate lies in the fact that they will never cooperate on religion. Indian society is vegetarian, reveres gods, and seeks liberation in life. It is like the teachings of immortals and Buddhas going back to the time of Chao Fu and Xu You and even earlier. Islam uses courage and force to establish countries, with religion as the foundation. It is meat-eating, reveres Heaven, is strong and roams in Central Asia, seeking to conquer and subdue dissenters. There is a saying that scholars cannot reason with soldiers. This describes India and Islam. Looking at the entire history of India, the Macedonians entered and ruled it, as well as the Greeks, the Mongolians, the Muslims, Persians, and Afghans, and more recently, the British. Indian religion does not discuss politics, which lacks political thought, thus allowing other forces to exploit the gaps. This is India. Our China takes the middle way as the teaching, but lacks philosophy and religion. Buddhism entered and dominated, and also lacks material sciences, thus allowing material sciences to enter and dominate. Each nation has their own specialized strengths and characteristics, helping and complementing each other. In the future, I hope our country deeply delves into the material sciences and further develop our middle-way politics and principles of people's livelihood. By taking advantage of the gaps in Europe and making up for its shortcomings, we will create great unity, and who can do this but the Chinese? Alas, looking at the frequent wars in India, it is clear that pure sages, immortals, and Buddhas are not enough to govern. When Greece fell, Roman barbarians plundered its philosophers, celebrities, and beautiful women, turning them into slaves of savage peoples. Thus, Greek philosophy is not enough to govern a country. Looking at the rampage of Napoleon and the ferocity of Genghis Khan, which disappeared without a trace, brute force alone is not enough to govern a country. Our China has eight words: managing heaven and earth, civil and martial achievements, sages and heroes, yin and yang, rigidity and flexibility, complete and without deficiency. This is why China is China. As for the religious issue, the 20th century is no longer a major problem, but the Indians and Muslims are still obsessed with it, which is not what we are eager for. China is concerned with the issues of people's livelihood and human life.</p>
<p>That day, there was a Buddhist monk named Shamin Shenxin, Satyacleo (transliterated as Shitetui), an Indian follower who had just returned from the United States, passing through Europe before returning to India. He was about fifty years old and wore a light yellow robe. He gave a lecture in the auditorium. I unfortunately did not understand Sanskrit and did not know what he was saying. However, thousands of students applauded continuously for about a minute. I admire the way Indian students applaud, with rhythmic cadences like music. Two thousand people applauding is like a large organ. This is a characteristic of Indian students. The monk Shamin Shitetui told me that the wishes of the Americans for Asia, India, and China are only to sell goods and make money. However, there are now many followers of Indian religion, and there are Indian churches in major ports. I regret that China has no religion to transmit abroad, and no one is transmitting Buddhism to foreign countries, leaving us in a position to receive teachings from others.</p>

<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>Mr. Lu was getting jealous. He had originally envied Miss Ding, but for the past few months, despite his wasted efforts, writing many letters and making many phone calls, he had not received a comparatively optimistic response. However, he had not felt hopeless. He still believed that Miss Ding had a good impression of him, so he continued to pursue her passionately.</p>
<p>Now, he actually saw Miss Ding come to play with Little Lu, and he heard Little Lu say that he had invited her. Remembering that he himself had invited her to play golf three days ago, and she had not agreed, he felt like he had been struck three serious blows.</p>
<p>There were no other conversations at the time. Miss Ding smiled at Mr. Li and continued forward with Mr. Lu. The more Mr. Li looked, the angrier he became, and the more he thought, the more furious he became. He realized that he had already been defeated by Little Lu.</p>
<p>Finally, after all eighteen holes were played, Mr. Lu calculated the recorded scores. Miss Ding's score was better, with a total of sixty-four strokes, while Mr. Lu himself had seventy-three strokes.</p>
<p>"The term 'golf' is truly wonderful. Naturally, I should let you have the upper hand," Mr. Lu laughed heartily.</p>
<p>"Why should you let me?" Miss Ding still didn't understand the meaning of these words.</p>
<p>"If you interpret the three words 'golf,' doesn't it mean 'surpass your husband'?" He laughed even louder.</p>
<p>Miss Ding was not angry at all, only feeling a bit shy. But in her entire mind, it was clearly a most precious memory and an extremely stimulating pleasure.</p>
<p>They chatted and laughed, everything immersed in the dissolving scenery. Only Mr. Li, who was constantly peeking over there, felt it was a great humiliation and had to leave disappointedly and resentfully.</p>
<p>Although Miss Ding grew up in Shanghai, she felt some disgust for the bustling urban life. She wanted to travel to a place with beautiful mountains and rivers during this vacation. Now she felt she could have this opportunity.</p>
<p>"I'm tired of playing in Shanghai. I want to go to Suzhou for a few days. You're from Suzhou, you have to fulfill your duties as a host!" Miss Ding said with a smile.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu felt somewhat uneasy when he heard that Miss Ding wanted to go to Suzhou. He thought of the Suzhou train station and felt it posed a great danger to him. He had to say indirectly, "I think Suzhou is not as good as Hangzhou. Besides Hangzhou, Taihu Lake in Wuxi is also really good."</p>
<p>"No! I've already been to Hangzhou several times, and I don't want to go to Wuxi. I think it's better to go to Suzhou. It's convenient to go and return, and besides, it's your hometown!" Miss Ding seemed to express herself very firmly.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Gold Price Rebounds Rapidly <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Small fall, big rebound… up seven taels eight mace</p>
<p>Triggered by the sharp drop in the British pound. Yesterday, the gold price trended upward again. The progression was good, and the fluctuations were moderate. However, there were over eight taels of fluctuations from morning to night. In the end, the price rose by eight taels, reversing the previous days' losses of just over seven taels. This is a sign of a slow retreat followed by a swift advance. The price rose from the opening, likely due to the slight increase in the silver market. The sharp drop in the British pound internationally, Germany's plan to buy cash from the United States, and the declining US stock market boosted confidence. Major players actively bought, and the North Bank's cash outflow was significant. The market became increasingly bullish, exceeding 740 taels. The foreign exchange market was also tight. In the after-market, the situation was very stable, fluctuating by only one tael. Transactions were not as active as in the morning. The exchange rate stabilized, with the final price at around 44 taels. This morning, the large bars show a trend of falling, but the gold market is not expected to weaken. However, there may still be some sideways movement.</p>
<p>Progressive rise after the opening. The opening price for September was up 1 tael 2 mace at 737 taels 2 mace. The price of silver rose by one-sixteenth of a tael, and the telegraphic rate rose by one-eighth of a tael. The private telegraph rate rose by only one-sixteenth of a tael, so it was not significant. Then, due to strong buying interest from Cuichangyong, Dadecheng, and Zhifengyong, the price rose from 36 taels 8 mace to 39 taels 8 mace. It then fell slightly by one tael to 38 taels 6 mace, due to sales by Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Shunli, and Yuancheng. The first order was issued without change, and Dongyang added 0.25, then increased to 39 taels 5 mace. The domestic market stabilized, and the banks absorbed 1,875 pounds of British gold in September, with purchases from Richang, Xiexingyong, and others, which further increased to 41 taels 4 mace. Later, it was often heard that British gold for October could be settled at 1,875. Around 10:00, it was 42 taels 0.012 mace. Subsequently, Hongli, Fuyu, Yiyu, Qianchangxiang, Changshengyong, and Cuichangyong (sometimes on behalf of Wu) actively purchased, and the banks absorbed 125 pounds of British gold. It increased to 0.0625, so the gold price jumped by 40-50 taels. It only fluctuated by a few mace until 11:00, rising to 45 taels 3 mace. Fellow traders scrambled for British gold, but the banks were willing to sell. Sumitomo and HSBC sold 125 in September, and Yuanmaoyong, Yuancheng, Xiexingyong, Yifengshui, and Futaiheng also sold, so the price fell sharply by 1 tael 6.7 mace to 43 taels 6.7 mace at 11:10. It was briefly heard that the Indian exchange rate was small by two annas, and it increased to 4 taels 9 mace. However, there were continuous sellers, and it was 43 taels 2 mace at 11:30. As Ganchangxiang and Changshengyong dragged it in, small retailers sold it, pushing it back down to around 3 taels 5 mace. The quoted price was changed to 791 taels 4 mace, a difference of 52 taels to 46-47 taels.</p>
<p>The situation calmed down slightly in the afternoon. The after-market opened slightly lower at 43 taels 2 mace, which was the remaining momentum after the noon close. The Indian exchange rate was small, and it was expected to increase to 4 taels. But Wanxing and others sold, so it fell to 42 taels 5 mace. Afterwards, there was only a fluctuation of one tael. Zhengjin bought forward British gold at 1,875, and Great Britain bought 125 in the near term, so the gold price rose to 44 taels. Afterwards, 1,875 could be settled, causing a drop to 43 taels. After 3:00, the buying seemed strong, likely because the Indian exchange rate was again small by one anna. Around 4:00, it was 44 taels 5 mace, and it then retreated to 43 taels 5 mace. At the 4:30 closing, it was 43 taels 8 mace, continuing to rise to 44 taels 2-3 mace as Yiyu and Yuanmaoyong bought in. Compared to the day before, it rebounded by 7 taels 8 mace (according to the quoted price). This is a small fall followed by a big rebound. The highest price of the day was 45 taels 3 mace, and the lowest was 36 taels 8 mace, a difference of 8 taels 5 mace.</p>
<p>Spot northern sales suddenly booming. Spot prices opened at 42 taels 2 mace, closed at 43 taels 5 mace, and 43 taels 5 mace in the afternoon. The closing price was 44 taels 4 mace, a difference of 47-48 taels for the quoted price and 42 taels and 44 taels when accounting for it. The total water compensation for the day was 42 taels. Sales of spot gold bars are quite strong, and prices are gradually increasing, up 12 taels 7.5 mace. Various firms sold 4,000-5,000 taels to Yingfengheng. The company also sold more than 7,000 taels to the Tianjin Dalian gang, and Dafengheng and others also sold as much as 14,000-15,000 taels. The market price may rise again.</p>
<p>Transactions are more in demand than supply. On the surface, there were more buyers. According to statistics, Cuichangyong, Qianchangxiang, Changshengyong, and others bought on behalf of Wu, but they also sold from time to time. Dafengheng, Yingfengheng, and Tongfengheng all sold spot goods. Dadecheng, Yiyu, Tianxiang, Hongxing, and Hongli also bought. Richang, Xiexingyong, Yuantai, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, and Hengyu bought and sold. Yuancheng, Futaiheng, Yuanheng, Tongtaichang, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, and Yifengyong all sold. In the afternoon, Ganchangxiang, Yuanxingyong, Yuanchun, Yuantai, Yuandayong, and Shunli bought and sold in varying amounts. Cuichangyong, Tongtaichang, Yiyu, and Zhifengyong all bought. Wanxing, Hengyu, Huixiang, and Futaiheng sold. There were many purchases and sales of hedging items. The Dalian gang sold a total of 2,800 bars and bought a total of 1,100 bars.

<h3 id="e149">Slight Improvement in the Silver Market <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the market for silver dollars has been sluggish for a long time, hovering around five cents, with no significant changes. Yesterday morning, due to news that customer demand had slightly improved, market sentiment turned positive. Consequently, the opening market showed a slight firming trend. However, it is unlikely that this trend will continue for long, and there is unlikely to be any major change in demand. As for the trend in silver prices, based on the situation last month, there was initially an upward trend. Currently, due to the unresolved anti-Japanese sentiment, the demand for silver has not had an opportunity to surge, so it remains sluggish.</p>
<p>Silver Exchange Rates: (Silver Dollars) The morning market was at 7.255 cents, and the afternoon market was at 7.25625 cents, slightly better than the previous day's morning market by 0.0075 cents. (Silver Discount) The morning market was at 0.6 cents, and the afternoon market was at 0.5 cents, with an additional 0.02 to 0.03 cents for commissions.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market Situation: Jiangnan small silver dollars were at 6.505 cents in the morning market and 6.5 cents in the afternoon market, with 3,000 units traded in the morning market and 2,500 units in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were at 6.455 cents in the morning market and 6.46 cents in the afternoon market, up 0.015 cents from the previous day, with 155,000 units traded in the morning market and 90,000 units in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000 cash, reaching 377,000 cash.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: (Silver) Yesterday, bank receipts totaled over 2.3 million from Chinese merchants, over 1.2 million from foreign merchants, and 8.56 million from various customs duties and miscellaneous fees. Outflow from warehouses was 900,000. Japanese banks received over 3.8 million and deposited 300,000 into warehouses. Money shops and silver firms received over 43 million and over 3.4 million in commissions. Remittances from various routes totaled over 600,000, with cash receipts of 5-600,000. (Silver Dollars) Exchange and draft transactions: 1.535 million in the morning market for drafts and 65,000 for banknotes. In the afternoon market, 1.295 million for drafts and 80,000 for banknotes. Off-market banknotes: 150,000 in the morning and 170,000 in the afternoon. Bank trading: 700,000 in the morning and 650,000 in the afternoon. Interbank silver dollar transactions totaled over 1.6 million, with over 1.4 million in banknote receipts and disbursements. Money shops and silver firms received over 5.2 million and over 1.7 million in commissions. Silver dollar borrowing and lending totaled over 1.3 million, with small money shop transactions exceeding 300,000 and spot silver dollar transactions exceeding 3-400,000.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Dormant Demand for Silver Dollars <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The sluggish demand for silver dollars this year is unprecedented compared to last year. The large-scale spring and early summer silkworm cocoon season was fleeting. Subsequently, the demand for summer cocoons was even more stagnant. For nearly two months, the demand for silver dollars from out-of-town customers completely disappeared. As a result, the silver dollar price trended downward, with no hope of rising. According to news from spot traders, the Yangtze River basin is experiencing a severe shortage of silver dollars due to the recent floods. Therefore, starting yesterday, there has been a rush to purchase from the Shanghai market. However, the quantity is limited and not for formal use. It is estimated that the demand is only for 1-2 million. Yesterday and the day before, shipments to various locations totaled 3-400,000 each. Demand from other areas remains stagnant. It is expected that there may be an opportunity for strong demand after the autumn cools down. Therefore, the current silver dollar price may see a slight improvement.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the securities market in this city saw a quiet spot market and a relatively active futures market. Trading was lively for major bonds, but there were no new developments in the overall environment. Market sentiment was stable, so supply and demand were balanced. Bond prices were stagnant, fluctuating only 0.04-0.05 cents between the morning and afternoon markets, resulting in mixed gains and losses. The 1921 bond has been inactive for a long time. Yesterday's price was slightly better than at the beginning of the month by a little more than 0.06 cents. Based on the current market situation, a slight firming trend is expected. The spot market traded only 10,200 yuan for the entire day, while the futures market traded 13.6 million yuan.</p>

<p>External Markets Continue to Decline...Actual Sales Stagnant</p>
<p>Long Positions Cut Losses Painfully...Market Prices Plunge Straight Down</p>
<p>The long-brewing yarn market suddenly experienced a sharp drop, with the situation being very weak. The overseas cotton yarn situation is trending downwards, with no end in sight. Additionally, widespread flooding is impacting actual sales, and trade on all routes is stagnant. Sichuan yarn prices plummeted by 10 taels, and Guangdong yarn prices also fell by 3-4 yuan. Numerous negative news items arrived in quick succession, leading to significant wavering among long positions. Scattered long positions had to endure painful liquidations, resulting in a straight plunge in market prices. However, given the treacherous trends in the global cotton market, further price declines are still possible. Some believe that prices may even fall to around 50 taels.</p>
<p>Human Labels Fall by 2.7 Taels: Trading on the exchange for human labels opened lower in the morning market due to negative news and falling U.S. cotton prices. Prices fell by 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 cents across various months, with the second and third rounds of trading remaining weak. As a result, prices fell by 1.48, 1.49, and up to 2.3 cents. The afternoon situation remained weak, with each month falling by 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 cents. The total volume traded was 52,750 bales. Sold: Yiyu 1,750 bales, Jifeng 2,400 bales, Shenyu 1,650 bales, Lichang 3,000 bales, Tianlong 1,150 bales. Bought: Daji 1,900 bales, Gongtai 2,750 bales, Tongyu 4,100 bales, Senkang 1,300 bales, Yuantai 1,350 bales, Yichang 1,250 bales. The closing prices for human labels are recorded below:</p>

Internal dealers purchased 300 bales. Prices fell by over 2 taels. Domestic dealers imported 75 bales from the interior, 25 bales from Tianjin, 25 bales from Qingdao, and 30 bales from Sichuan.

<h3 id="e154">Violent Decline in the Cotton Market <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Treacherous Global Trends</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Compete with Price Cuts</p>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, and the sharp decline has been brewing for some time. However, the majority of people in this city are holding firm due to the severity of the flooding. Recently, the prices of Indian and American cotton have fallen sharply, making silver-based calculations cheaper. Therefore, domestic cotton is struggling to stabilize. However, the situation in the American cotton market is extremely pessimistic, and foreign merchants, seeing the urgency of the situation, have been forced to cut losses. The market is becoming increasingly weak, and there are reports of foreign cotton being sold off at reduced prices. Each factory is hesitant to take action due to the deteriorating environment. Some say that Japanese factories have already purchased 30,000 dan of Lumite cotton at 39 taels, and the spot goods are being delivered to the factories.</p>
<p>Han Labels Fall by 0.95 Cents: Trading on the exchange for Han labels opened lower in the morning market due to a sharp drop in Indian cotton and weak American cotton. Selling pressure was strong, with prices falling by 0.055 to 0.08 cents across various months. The afternoon situation remained weak, with prices falling by 0.015 to 0.03 cents. The total volume traded was 146,300 dan. Sold: Taixing 5,000 dan, Xincheng 2,000 dan, Xinfeng 2,300 dan, Heshen 2,600 dan, Yichang 2,700 dan, Beiji 3,700 dan, Yuda 1,500 dan.

<p>Spot Sales Completely Stalled: Spot cotton trading is becoming increasingly quiet. The trend of foreign cotton is becoming more treacherous by the day, and each factory is taking a wait-and-see approach. The source is estimated to be 1,400 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Grains: Smooth Sales in the Hexia Rice Market <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>South Market: There was a slight supply of various types of rice from Hexia yesterday, with limited inventory. The market rebounded due to the gradual increase in foreign rice prices and the firmness of the North Market. Dealers showed some buying interest, and the price of thick japonica rice suddenly increased by 0.2-0.3 cents. There was not much early indica rice arriving, and although the demand from Ningbo was weak, the local sales were still active, leading to another increase of 0.02 cents. The arrival of Luyang Jianyuan foreign rice is increasing daily, with strong demand and a rising trend. The sales of Yinhua rice are good when available, and the trend is stable. The supply of foreign rice remains tight, with activity from the Han dealers and some local purchases. Prices are gradually firming. Over 100 shi of Dongxin japonica rice arrived yesterday, stabilizing the price at 14.5 yuan.</p>
<p>New Zha: The supply from the West Road is slightly less, and the market is not smooth. There is a lack of early indica rice arrivals, and the bulk price suddenly increased by 0.4-0.5 cents. People are watching closely. The prices of Su Chang Machine Japonica rice and Kunshan rice have each increased by 0.2 cents. Although there is some South Port early rice on the docks, the quantity is not large, and the price has also increased by about 0.01 cent. The sales of Lubu Jianyuan rice are sluggish, with no change in price. Wine shops and food vendors purchased nearly 1,000 shi of glutinous rice, and the price increased slightly by 0.02 cents. The Hexia factories have a volume of 6-7,000 shi.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Flour: Continuing Imports by Out-of-Town Dealers <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed an initial state of stability. With a slight decrease in the price of foreign wheat by 0.02-0.04 cents, sentiment among industry participants was naturally depressed. Although the opening price for this month reached 3.2105 yuan, the floods in the country, both north and south, have caused unprecedented and unparalleled devastation. Therefore, dealers from various regions are still purchasing actively. Impartially speaking, given the situation in the country, the current market value seems reasonable. However, with the continued dumping from foreign countries, it seems that the shorts are intending to make adjustments.

<h3 id="e158">Wheat Market: Recovery After Weakness <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed signs of weakness, with the price for the current month reaching a low of 4 taels, but it soon recovered. Trading in the distant months was relatively sparse, and the market was stable. By the afternoon opening, the longs for the current month were unwilling to move lightly, and given the significant floods and expected food losses, buyers remained firm. As a result, the current month was unchanged, September increased by 0.01 yuan, October and November increased by 0.02 yuan, and December increased by 0.01 yuan. The spot wheat market remains stable. Over 5,000 bags of Wusong, Xu Gongqiao, Shuangfeng, Zhitang, Wuxi, Yangzhou, and Luzhu wheat were opened and handled by Huafeng and Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Silk and Tea: New York Silk Market Has Prices but No Sales <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Factory Silk Remains Expensive with No Demand</p>
<p>New York has historically been the largest consumer of Chinese silk. In recent years, due to economic instability in various countries and the declining sales of silk fabrics, silk weaving factories have increasingly focused on rayon to reduce costs. Furthermore, Japanese silk has taken the opportunity to compete with low prices, causing the American sales of Chinese silk to suffer a setback. Shanghai white factory silk has not seen any transactions since March of this year. Recently, some silk factories have occasionally made supplemental purchases of futures to prepare for production, but they still find Shanghai factory silk too expensive and there is no demand. The demand for gray raw silk and Sichuan and Shandong yellow factory silk is also stagnant, with prices but no sales. However, trading in Japanese silk futures and spot is quite lively. It is reported that over 1,000 bales have been sold this month.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Grey Raw Silk Prices Remain Weak in American Sales <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market continued to be quiet. Although overseas silk factories are gradually becoming more active in purchasing futures silk, there are still no positive reports on Chinese silk. Grey raw silk prices remain weak in American sales. Yesterday, only Dachang made a supplemental purchase of 20 bales of high-grade grey raw silk to cover shortages, and Samsung purchased 10 bales of white raw silk. The price remains stable.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Core-Picked Zhenmei Tea Skyrockets by Over 10 Taels <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, major firms such as Jinlong, Yihe, Xiehe, and Yongxing were highly interested in core-picked Zhenmei tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. The top price for high-grade Wuyuan goods opened at 240 taels, and the market price skyrocketed by over 10 taels. The shrimp-eye pearl tea market was more active than before. The sales of needle-tip tea and phoenix-tip tea were also firm. Although there was no major development in the Gongxi market, white-top dealers, anticipating the upcoming Russian season, also had a tendency to search for purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e162">North-South Goods: Slight Improvement in Dried Lily Flowers <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Since the new crop of dried lily flowers came to market this year, the various firms have had different goals, and the company has failed to form. Therefore, each firm has been acting independently, and market prices have frequently fallen, resulting in significant losses. As a result, sales in various regions have also been sluggish. The various firms, fearing a repeat of this situation, are planning to reorganize the company and unite to work together to maintain market prices. This is expected to be realized, and the market price has already shown a slight improvement. If sales improve in the future, the opportunity for recovery will be just around the corner.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Sugar Market: Both Taikoo and Market Sugar Turn Upward <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to news from sugar-producing areas, the price of Cuban spot sugar was unchanged, while New York sugar futures fell by 0.01 to 0.03 cents. Both Javanese spot and futures showed little fluctuation. In the Public Association market, the price of Dutch sugar #24 coarse white sugar was stable, but both sales and purchases were slack, and trading was scarce. The asking price remained at 11.3 taels, while Hong Kong goods were at 11.2 taels. The price of #20 medium white sugar was at 10.085 taels, and the market was still firm. The price of Cuban red sugar increased to 9.95 taels, as it is used by ice sugar factories to produce ice-flower sugar, and demand is quite strong, making the market very firm. Trading in Taikoo cane sugar was quite active. B was at 11.09-11.0925 taels, CW was at 11.0725-11.075 taels, DY was at 11.07 taels, HX was at 11.07 taels, and HM was at 11.02 taels. The market was firm and brisk. The Public Association has several hundred bags of ice-flower green sugar offered at 10.035 taels. The market is brisk, and there are no signs of further price increases.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Hardware: Arrivals Are Strong but Sales Are Stagnant <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, the hardware market continued to be quiet. Both retail and wholesale trade with out-of-town dealers were minimal. Although factories made some transactions, most were just for adding assorted goods. As for staple goods, there was still no good demand. Unfortunately, arrivals continued unabated, leading to a situation of full inventory and reduced sales. The overall market situation was somewhat sluggish. However, with recent exchange rate stability and positive sentiment, there was no panic in the market, so this can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>Frequent Arrivals of Imported Goods: In the past two to three days, the number of hardware imports has been very large. Therefore, warehouses such as New Taikoo, Gonghexiang, and Zhaoshang Zhongbei, as well as piers such as Dalai and Osaka, are all facing problems of being full. Among them, the inventory of scrap iron is the most abundant. Among the new goods, English 10-gauge plates, tinplate, flat white iron, and new lead wire are also quite popular. However, 8-gauge 26-foot black iron sheets are still not arriving, so prices have been able to remain stable without falling.</p>
<p>Export Business Is Stagnant and Inactive: The hardware export business to various ports has been stagnant and inactive recently. Although sales are usually sluggish during the summer season, this year is worse than ever. The reason is that various regions have been affected by flooding, and Shi Yousan's betrayal has severely impacted business in Tianjin. As a result, the hardware market trend feels very deserted.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Jiang Zuobin Appointed as Envoy to Japan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Shigemitsu Officially Appointed as Minister to China</p>
<p>Jiang's European Trip May Be Cancelled</p>
<p>Wang Rongbao Went to Beijing Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Minister to Japan, Wang Rongbao, accompanied by his staff member Ren Jiafeng, went to Beijing by special express train at 9:30 yesterday morning to meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhengting, to report on the results of the investigation of the Korean case. Wang has been appointed as the Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The National Government has decided to appoint Jiang Zuobin as the Minister to Japan. The Japanese government officially expressed its agreement yesterday. Before Jiang takes office, the secretary of the embassy in Japan, Jiang Hongjie, will act as the agent. It is reported that Jiang was summoned to Jiangxi by Chairman Jiang's telegram to discuss this matter. At the same time, according to news from the Japanese Consulate, the Japanese government officially appointed the Acting Minister Shigemitsu Kui as the Minister to China yesterday, and immediately formally notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The relationship between China and Japan should have new developments. Jiang Zuobin and Shigemitsu Kui made the following remarks to Chinese and Japanese reporters yesterday.</p>
<p>Jiang Zuobin's Remarks: A reporter from the Far East News Agency specially visited Jiang at his private residence at 5:00 PM yesterday and asked whether he had received a formal order for the change of his appointment as the Minister to Japan, and whether his attendance at the League of Nations meeting would be cancelled as a result, and whether he would go to Japan to take office first. According to Jiang, he originally planned to take the Fengtian Maru from Shanghai to Dalian on the 9th of this month, and then go to Russia to attend the League of Nations meeting in Europe. His luggage had just been packed when he suddenly received news of his change of appointment as the Minister to Japan. However, he has not yet received a formal order, so he is not in a position to express any opinion to you. However, if this matter is true, his attendance at the League of Nations meeting may be cancelled, and he cannot predict it. In short, everything will be done in accordance with the orders of the National Government.</p>
<p>Shigemitsu's Remarks: Shigemitsu Kui, the newly appointed Japanese Minister to China, told a group of Japanese newspaper reporters yesterday that he was deeply frightened by the new order he received today (that is, yesterday). But in reality, his duties have not changed in any way. The only difference is the name. In the future, he will continue to work hard to promote the development of relations between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Emergency Disaster Relief Association for Flooded Provinces</p>
<h3 id="e188">Grand Inaugural Meeting Held Yesterday <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Telegraphic Request to the Government for Prompt Allocation of 20 Million in Cash</p>
<p>Organize 500 Fundraising Groups, Each with 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Disaster Relief Association for Flooded Provinces held its inaugural meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday. More than 200 people attended, including Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Ha Shaofu, Wang Peiyuan, Qin Runqing, Zhang Zhijiang, and Wang Yansong. Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, and Wang Xiaolai were publicly elected as the presidium. After Yu Qiaqing reported the purpose of the meeting, Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yiting spoke successively, detailing the severity of the floods in various provinces and the urgent need for relief. Subsequently, Xu Shiying reported on the flood situation in 16 provinces including Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Guangdong. In general, he said that the continuous rain and mountain floods had caused deaths and displacement, which was an unprecedented catastrophe in nearly a hundred years. He asked for urgent fundraising to provide relief. As a result, Wang Xiaolai proposed two solutions: (1) In the name of the meeting, telegraphically request the government to promptly allocate 20 million in cash for relief; (2) Organize fundraising groups to raise funds separately, with 1,000 yuan per group, and set up 500 groups. Regardless of whether they have arrived today or not, those who have been invited by letter will all be executive members of this association, and they are requested to designate at least one group, and it is best to recognize several groups. The entire venue unanimously approved. Those who signed up on the spot accounted for 75,400 yuan. Others who have not yet committed will be sent to contact them. The rest of the proceedings will be discussed at the next committee meeting. The meeting adjourned at nine o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Yesterday's News on Expanding the Concession <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Merchants in Western Shanghai Have Begun to Deny</p>
<p>The Western newspapers fabricated the story that merchants in Western Shanghai had requested the Municipal Council to expand the concession. Legitimate merchants in that area have now begun to deny this. The truth of the matter will soon be revealed. The following is a continuation of what we have heard:</p>
<p>Denial by Merchants and Residents of Zhoujiaqiao: Gu Hongjun, Chen Zhenbo, Lv Xuehai, Ji Jinwen, Zhu Fangjie, Yuan Lianghong, Jiang Qinsheng, Bao Benchu, Zhang Yongqing, Lu Shirong, Hong Liangqing, and other merchants and residents of Zhoujiaqiao in Western Shanghai, saw a news report in a major American newspaper that 200,000 merchants and residents of Zhoujiaqiao, Wangjialou, and Shengjiaqiao in Western Shanghai had jointly requested the Municipal Council to expand the concession. They all believe that the merchants and residents of Western Shanghai are not all ignorant people. How could they have such a heartless and crazy idea of ​​flattering foreigners and willingly acting as accomplices? Even if there are one or two local ruffians who are willing to be lackeys of the Municipal Council, their despicable behavior is only their own private opinion, and how can they pretend to be representatives of 200,000 people in Western Shanghai? They do not know what basis the Municipal Council relied on, or what methods it used, to obtain the so-called joint request of 200,000 people in Western Shanghai, and even published a propaganda-style record in a major American newspaper. Is this kind of trick using ronin to impersonate public opinion? Once an investigation is conducted, the truth will come out. But the merchants and residents of Western Shanghai, for no reason, bear this evil reputation of flattering foreigners, inviting people to spit and scold them. How can they remain silent? Therefore, yesterday, they convened people from all walks of life and held a special emergency meeting at the Zhoujiaqiao Security Corps. They all said that the contents of the newspapers and the letters requesting the Municipal Council to expand the concession were absolutely denied by the citizens of Western Shanghai, and they submitted a document to the party and government authorities requesting a strict investigation of the heartless and crazy representatives who impersonated the request, and requested them to forward it to the Municipal Council to find out the source of the letter of request in the name of others, in order to emphasize sovereignty and extend genuine public opinion.</p>
<p>Statement by the Municipal Committee of the Pusong District: The Guomin News Agency said that after the news of the merchants in Western Shanghai requesting the expansion of the concession was published, the reporter of the Guomin News Agency specially visited Chen Yafu, a member of the Municipal Committee of the Pusong District, for the sake of clarifying the facts. According to him, he was extremely shocked after reading the news in the "Great American Evening Post" that merchants from Chenjiaqiao, Zhoujiaqiao, Wangjialou and other places in Western Shanghai had jointly requested the Municipal Council to expand the concession. He secretly said that he has always been the most vocal advocate for the recovery of the concession and the recovery of roads built beyond the boundary. The merchants in the newspaper's publication are located within the scope of the Pusong District, and he has an inescapable responsibility. Therefore, he went to Wangjialou Zhoujiaqiao (that is, the Zhu Jiaqiao in the newspaper's error) and Chenjiaqiao (that is, the Sheng Jiaqiao in the newspaper's error) and other shops yesterday in the sweltering heat to conduct a detailed investigation. They all said that at this time of singing loudly about the recovery of the concession, no sane merchant would dare to do such a wicked thing and do something against his conscience. They absolutely deny the sections published in the "Great American Evening Post." The merchants in the towns and villages in the Pusong District of Western Shanghai are all well-informed and enthusiastically participate in every patriotic movement. The groundless rumors of the newspaper are not worth a smile from those who know the truth. It is also said that the merchants in the area will automatically make a statement to prove that there is no such matter.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Chinese Taxpayers Association: The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association declared, "At this time when we are rapidly recovering roads built beyond the boundary and preparing to recover the concession, in order to complete the territorial sovereignty of our great Republic of China, those who oppose the recovery and maintain the status quo, apart from stubborn foreigners, are either those who do not know that there is a country and behave like Jews, or those madmen who rely on strong power to bully those who love peace. According to the Great American Evening Post of this port on August 4 and the North China Daily News on the following day, there is a news report that someone in Western Shanghai has written a letter to the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council requesting the expansion of the concession to Western Shanghai. All of us, the masters of the territory, must be shocked and think that those who signed the letter are really people abandoned by the citizens. Moreover, based on their suggestions, they expressed that the Municipal Council has the ability to build, and that the psychology of the residents is expected to have a significant impact. In the view of this association, if you want to make excuses, why worry about no words? This is only a kind of propaganda, which is the intention of those who are not conducive to the integrity of our national sovereignty, and even more so a false action by those who hold aggressive ambitions. If there are Chinese in the list of signatories, if there are responsible Chinese who can represent the residents of Western Shanghai, they will surely treat the letter as a treasure and publicly announce it, thinking that all the special rights that are not allowed by international law are a powerful excuse for not returning them. Otherwise, if they cannot or do not want to present the responsible signatories, then this kind of letter is really like an anonymous posting and has no value. A further presumption is that the writer and the person who sees the letter are both appointed by one party, which is even better, then what impact can this kind of letter have on the psychology of our compatriots? On the contrary, it is enough to prove that roads built beyond the boundary and concessions should be rapidly prepared for recovery, in order to eliminate the delusions of ambitious people. In short, this kind of senseless propaganda is no different from the propaganda of Mao Lisheng's lease of Shanghai on December 7, 1929. It only urges the tension of our country's national rights recovery movement. This declaration is made to reveal the conspiracy. August 5, 1931." The association also sent a letter to the Municipal Council saying, "Dear Sirs, According to the Great American Evening Post of this port on August 4 and the North China Daily News on the following day, there is news that residents of a certain place in Western Shanghai wrote a letter to your office requesting the expansion of the concession to Western Shanghai. We are very surprised. We hereby inquire with your office whether you have received the letter, and if there is such a letter, who are the responsible signatories? This matter is of great importance. We hope you will investigate and reply to us clearly."</p>

<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3 id="e193">Announces Steps for Dealing with Japanese Goods <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Present Sacrifices Are for the Survival of Descendants</p>
<p>Economic Severance Should Follow Publicly Agreed Regulations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce notified various trade associations yesterday, "Dear Sirs, On July 31st, we received a letter from the Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Committee of all sectors of the city, opening on July 28th, we received a letter from your company, requesting the release of the seized Japanese goods as soon as possible, or transfer them to a warehouse to avoid losses, etc. After checking the case regarding the release of the seized Japanese goods, your association requested a meeting with the association, and it was resolved by the fourth executive committee meeting. The method of disposing of the seized Japanese goods by our association has been published in the newspaper, and a mimeographed copy is attached for your reference. It is hereby notified to you to forward it to your association. After checking the method resolved by the meeting, it is not only related to the transportation industry, and although the above method was sent to the newspapers of this city on July 30th by the association, we are afraid that all industries have not paid close attention to the newspaper reports. We were planning to notify you of the method resolved by the meeting by letter, and we received a letter from the committee stating that we received a letter from you, requesting the return of the goods seized before the 24th, etc. After checking the meeting of the representatives of all sectors of the city, which was held in your council hall on the 13th of this month, it was resolved to permanently sever economic relations with Japan with a calm and extremely courageous spirit. All sectors were represented at the meeting, and there were also many enthusiastic patriotic members of the business community who participated in the meeting on that day. Since the decision was made at the meeting, Japanese goods should not be imported at all. On the 15th, the committee was officially established, and it was also published in the newspaper that all Japanese goods should be stopped from moving. Those who have entered should come to the committee to register. Now the transportation and other industries have not followed the announcement, and have not come to the committee to apply for registration, and have arbitrarily declared the goods for export. This is really inappropriate. However, according to your association's transfer, your association convened a general meeting of members on the 24th of this month and resolved to sever economic relations with Japan and participate in anti-Japanese work. The entire venue unanimously stood up and passed the resolution. Various industries have also successively announced that they will automatically refuse to transport, refuse to load, and refuse to purchase. The voice has been spread, and the whole city is united. After discussion by our association, we all believe that although various industries cannot avoid watching and hesitating in the past, if they can resolutely implement it in the future, showing the true sincerity of the merchants and people in loving the country, and vowing to fight the enemy with the same hatred, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. Therefore, at the fourth executive committee meeting of our association, according to the request of your association and various industries, the method of disposing of Japanese goods was resolved as follows: (A) The disposal of Japanese goods should be divided into three steps: (1) For Japanese goods purchased and stored by merchants before July 14, they should come to the association to register within the registration period. (The registration period ends on August 6, and the registration form should also state: (1) the origin of the goods, (2) the number of the goods, (3) the warehouse where they are stored. After the registration period expires, a certificate will be issued to allow them to be sold without charge. However, if Japanese goods purchased and stored by merchants before July 14 have not been registered and are reported for export and sale, and have been found by our association, a relief fund for anti-Japanese and aid to overseas Chinese will be levied at 10%, and the registration will be supplemented. (2) For Japanese goods purchased and stored by merchants after July 14 and before July 24, if they have not been registered and are reported for export and sale, and have been found by our association, the relief fund for anti-Japanese and aid to overseas Chinese will be doubled, and the registration will be supplemented. (3) After July 24, those who purchase and transport Japanese goods again will be confiscated if found. Even if the goods purchased were before July 24, if they are not registered with the association within the time limit, they will also be confiscated if found. (B) After each item is registered, the respective trade association will collect and store them in one or two warehouses, and send a letter to the association to request the association to send personnel together with the Chamber of Commerce to inspect and verify them clearly. After printing them separately on each item, they will be allowed to be sold for circulation. If they are exported in large quantities, the trade association can send a letter to the association to apply for a pass, which will be stamped and issued by the association together with the Chamber of Commerce for mutual investigation. After the goods arrive, the consignee should first report to the local anti-Japanese association and the Chamber of Commerce for inspection and registration before they can be collected. In the future, if goods are found without stamps, they should be detained and confiscated for use as a relief fund for anti-Japanese and aid to overseas Chinese. The above methods are to be lenient to the past and strict to the future, and to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants while strictly implementing the resistance to goods. We hope that your association will notify various industries to comply with the regulations. As the saying goes, "Cut off the arm when a poisonous snake is in your hand." All of these unavoidable sacrifices at present are for the survival of our descendants for billions of years. We especially hope that your association will sincerely inform them of this. In addition, the goods seized by various industries before the 24th will no longer be replied to one by one. We hope you will check the case and inform them. The so-called "conquering Manchuria and Mongolia in order to conquer the entire China" by the Japanese has long become an open secret in their country, and using Koreans is a precursor to conquering Manchuria and Mongolia. Once this conspiracy is fully completed, how can our people still have a place to eat? The so-called unavoidable sacrifices at present by the association are for the survival of our descendants for billions of years. This is a heart-wrenching and tearful talk. The method of disposing of Japanese goods resolved by the association this time has been changed compared with the first resolution. It is really for the sake of reconciling the spirits of all sectors and cooperating thoroughly. Our business community should especially deeply understand the ancient训 of "The house is falling, the beam is broken, and the beams will be crushed." Understand that the meaning of this economic severance with Japan is completely for self-preservation. With an automatic spirit, abide by publicly agreed regulations, and do not repeat the mistakes of the past with inconsistent steps and divergent opinions.</p>

<p>Jiang Boqi, the former Governor of Zhejiang and Guangdong Provinces, an advanced member of the Party and the State, passed away on the 5th. All sectors deeply mourned his death. The details have been published in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday at 4:00 PM was the time for the encoffining ceremony. For a time, those who came to pay their respects filled the door, and they all personally offered the ceremony of encoffining. A huge mat awning was built on the lawn of Jiang's residence (No. 23 Sapo Road), and the plain colors fluttered, attracting the attention of passers-by. It is said that the funeral committee has been organized and established, and Li Liejun is the general manager. Therefore, he did not avoid the heat and personally went back and forth to command. Those who saw his old friendship and party spirit were moved. Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, who was in Jiangxi, specially sent his aide-de-camp Jiang Yi as a representative to take care of everything. The military band of the command arrived at the scene, all with black gauze wrapped around their arms, and respectfully played mourning music. Mayor Zhang Yuejun arrived at 7:00 AM. Among the friends were Xu Shiying, Zhang Zhijiang, Cheng Qian, Xu Qian, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Zhou Fengqi, Chu Huiseng, Gao Zibai, Li Zhengwu, Tao Jiayao, Li Yujie, Shen Tianxin, and other representatives from all walks of life, totaling more than 200 people. Wang Jingwei, Tang Shaoyi, Sun Ke, Xu Chongzhi, and Gu Yingfen also sent condolences from Guangzhou and telegraphed 1,000 yuan each as a funeral gift. Jiang was a senior member of the Tongmenghui who destroyed his family to make a revolution and devoted himself to the party and the country. He was dignified, honest, and upright. Although he held important positions, his situation after his death was extremely desolate. The family members and the funeral committee plan to hold the funeral on the fifth seventh day and return to their hometown for burial. The All-Zhejiang Association believes that the Sangzi area has benefited and his legacy remains. It is said that they have telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to forward the request to the National Government for preferential commendation to show loyalty and sincerity.</p>

They resumed work yesterday, and the working hours are still the usual nine hours, from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, with one hour for lunch break. All issues related to treatment improvement will be discussed by the Social Affairs Bureau convening both parties on another day.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Employee Request for Improved Benefits <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The entire workforce of the China General Edison Company had previously proposed improvements to their benefits, which have now been satisfactorily resolved. The company's General Manager, Lu Bohong, subsequently issued a notice stating, in essence, that the company's newly revised worker benefits regulations are slightly more favorable than before and have been approved by the board of directors. As employees also serve the company, they cannot be excluded. The manager has decided to submit a request to the next board meeting to formulate separate employee benefits rules that will certainly not be inferior to those of the workers, in order to demonstrate impartiality and provide encouragement. Please be informed accordingly. It is now known that after General Manager Lu Bohong's announcement, all employees of the company immediately convened a general meeting and resolved to propose eight articles. Eleven representatives were elected to send a letter to the company authorities, setting a date for signing an agreement so that labor and management could jointly abide by it. After the employees sent three letters to the company requesting a joint discussion and signing, the company authorities delayed without responding. Consequently, all employees collectively decided to petition the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for a swift resolution. The eight proposed improvements to benefits are listed below: (1) Request the company to increase employee benefits and establish fixed salary rates for each level to enhance work efficiency. Measures: (A) The minimum monthly salary for a section chief should not be less than 350 yuan, the minimum monthly salary for a deputy section chief should not be less than 300 yuan, the minimum monthly salary for a section staff member should not be less than 180 yuan, the minimum monthly salary for a team leader should not be less than 250 yuan, the minimum monthly salary for a team member should not be less than 140 yuan, and the minimum monthly salary for a trainee should not be less than 40 yuan. (B) Trainees should receive a salary increase once every year-end, with a minimum increase of 10 yuan. However, after three years of service, they should be promoted to team members and receive a team member's salary. (C) Whenever an employee is promoted, their job salary should increase according to their level. (D) For current company employees, the appropriate salary level should be determined as follows: Section chiefs and team leaders can receive salaries based on their title and level. For other section employees, three employees from each section should be publicly elected by the section, and with the approval of the employee representatives, they will work with the respective section chief to impartially determine the appropriate salary level for each employee. This will be reported to the employee representatives for approval and then communicated to the company for salary payment according to the level. (E) The current salary rates are tentatively set for a period of three years. After three years, due to the continued increase in the cost of living and the company's expanding business, employees may request the company authorities to modify and increase salaries according to the living situation. (2) Request the company to provide free electricity to employees for residential use. (3) The company should not suspend employees without a valid reason. If an employee has committed a serious offense that warrants suspension, the criminal act should be announced in detail. (4) When an employee retires, the company should provide a retirement gratuity based on their years of service, paying one month's salary for each year of service, with the salary at the time of retirement as the standard. Two months for two years, three months for three years, and so on. Months less than one year can be calculated based on the average distribution of twelve months of the year. (5) If an employee dies due to illness, the company should provide a one-time funeral expense of 1,000 yuan and a separate retirement gratuity based on the years of service, which should be fully received by the family. (6) Employees who work overtime on Sundays or holidays should be paid one-thirtieth of their monthly salary for each overtime session. (7) Employees receive an annual bonus of two months' salary at the end of each year. However, new employees who start service in July will only receive six-twelfths of the full annual bonus, and those who start service in December will only receive one-twelfth of the annual bonus. In the interest of fair treatment, whenever an employee resigns, the annual bonus should be divided into twelve parts, and the employee should be paid the corresponding number of twelfths based on the number of months they have served in the current year, in order to ensure fairness. (8) The company's Employees' Welfare Association is a place for employees to cultivate their minds, strengthen their bodies, and enjoy legitimate recreation. The company should subsidize the association's expenses with 600 yuan per month and provide a one-time allocation of 3,000 yuan for the association to purchase equipment.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Replacing Workers Sparks Unrest <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Peaceful Resolution Reached in Shanghai</p>
<p>The President Adams, a world liner of the Dollar Steamship Lines, arrived in Shanghai this time from New York, USA, and entered the port on the 3rd of this month. The ship was docked at the Bailianjing Wharf in Pudong. The stewards, servants, and other personnel on board became agitated upon learning that the foreman intended to replace them with new recruits. Fortunately, the Shanghai representative of the company, with the aim of resolving the matter peacefully, prevented any unexpected incidents from occurring. The details of the event are as follows:</p>
<p>Revision of Contract: The stewards, servants, and other personnel employed on the ship had previously entered into employment contracts in Singapore. Their salaries averaged 25 yuan per month, paid in Singapore currency. Upon the President Adams' arrival in Shanghai, the ship's foreman proposed that the workers' contracts be revised and signed in Shanghai, allowing payment in Shanghai currency, which would save the company a few yuan per month per person. The workers immediately expressed their opposition and, in addition to requesting Mr. Suckle, the shipowner's representative, to convey their concerns to the Shanghai office, they also telegraphed the head office in San Francisco for assistance.</p>
<p>Replacing Workers: The ship's foreman, determined to dismiss the sailors who resisted the contract revision, hired a new batch of workers, totaling more than 80, in Shanghai. The foreman led them onto the ship at 7 a.m. on the 5th. Upon the workers' arrival on board, the existing crew members united in resistance, guarding the gangway to prevent the foreman and the new workers from boarding. They also requested the American sailors on board to assist them in their struggle. The American stokers and other personnel expressed their sympathy for the veteran workers and drove the foreman ashore.</p>
<p>Request to the Shanghai Office: Taking advantage of this opportunity, the workers put forward their conditions for security: (1) The existing crew members on board must not be replaced. (2) The contracts must still be signed in Singapore, and the workers' salaries must be paid in Straits dollars. (3) The foreman's contracting system and deductions must be abolished. (4) Improvements in treatment, etc. Representatives were then elected by the workers to present their case to Mr. Suckle, the shipowner's representative, and to convey it to the Shanghai office. The Shanghai representative, recognizing that the fault lay with the foreman, immediately agreed to the sailors' requests and ordered them to resume work quickly.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The new workers were withdrawn: The Shanghai office, recognizing that the ship was a regularly scheduled world liner and that any delay would be unacceptable, immediately ordered the foreman to dismiss the newly hired workers and prevent them from boarding. At the same time, the workers on board were instructed to resume work quickly. Cargo loading and passenger boarding proceeded as usual, and the ship departed from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th, returning directly to New York. The workers on board, grateful for the assistance of the American sailors on the ship in achieving this victory, expressed their deep appreciation. Representatives were dispatched by the workers to express their thanks and to request that American and Chinese sailors unite permanently in the future.</p>
<p>Request for Reconsideration</p>
<h3 id="e199">New Organizational Law of the Directorate General of Posts <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Petition from the Postal Workers' Unions to Director Qian</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees' Union jointly submitted a document to Director Qian, requesting reconsideration of the new organizational law of the Directorate General of Posts. The petition stated that the recently promulgated organizational law of the Directorate General of Posts, in consideration of the actual circumstances of the postal service, contains certain unsuitable provisions. They jointly requested, with utmost sincerity, that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Communications of the Executive Yuan, which would then request the Legislative Yuan to approve amendments to benefit communications and comply with public sentiment. It was noted that since its establishment, the Chinese postal service has undergone over thirty years of development, achieving remarkable results and consistently ranking as the leading state-owned enterprise. The primary reason for this success lies in the well-organized and systematic structure of the postal service, the relatively comprehensive existing regulations, the employees' reliance on guaranteed rights, and the resulting development of the business. However, the recently promulgated organizational law of the Directorate General of Posts introduces numerous changes to the existing system. Several aspects that are deemed incompatible with the circumstances of the postal service are listed below for consideration: (1) The position of Deputy Director General is not explicitly stipulated to be selected from experienced postal directors. It is recalled that when the right to manage the postal service was recovered, the former Director General, Mr. Meng Wangken, was promoted from his position as a senior postal director. At that time, the regulations of the Directorate General stipulated that the general managers should also be filled by personnel with experience in the postal service. This demonstrated the Minister's understanding of the difficulties involved in managing the postal service, which could not be easily handled by those unfamiliar with its operations. When the former Director General attended the Universal Postal Congress, the acting Director General, although not a postal service veteran, benefited from the assistance of several experienced managers, who provided support in managing the bureau's affairs. Fortunately, few obstacles were encountered. Therefore, the current regulations of the Directorate General still stipulate that the managers should be filled by personnel with experience in the postal service. The unions have repeatedly applied to the Ministry of Communications, the Bureau, and other higher-level authorities, requesting that this principle be retained when revising the organizational law of the postal service to benefit the communications industry. These requests were largely accepted. However, the Legislative Yuan's recent revision of the organizational law of the Directorate General of Posts changed the general managers to Director General and Deputy Director General. The qualifications for the appointment of the Deputy Director General omitted the provision that it should be filled by personnel with experience in the postal service, causing widespread anxiety among the staff. While the unions greatly admire the Director General's expertise in postal science, the position of Deputy Director General is also crucial. Ultimately, selecting someone familiar with the postal service would be more mutually beneficial. Furthermore, the unions especially hope that the position of Deputy Director General will be reserved for promotion from among postal directors, to provide encouragement and support. The current managers have already been appointed by the Ministry of Communications as Deputy Director General, demonstrating that the Minister still considers the previous regulations to be appropriate. It is therefore necessary to request the Legislative Yuan to approve an amendment that retains the qualification for the Deputy Director General of the Directorate General of Posts to be selected from experienced postal directors, thereby reassuring the public. (2) The Chief Secretary should also be explicitly designated to be appointed from senior postal personnel. According to the new organizational law, the Chief Secretary is equivalent to the Director of the Secretariat in the current regulations. The powers and responsibilities are similar. The Directors of the Secretariat, like other directors, have traditionally been filled by personnel with experience in the postal service. The new organizational law also stipulates that the Director and Deputy Director should be appointed from postal directors and deputy postal directors. Therefore, the same principle should apply to the Chief Secretary and should be explicitly stated. (3) The affairs of the Performance Evaluation and Auditing Departments should continue to be handled by the Bureau. The Performance Evaluation Department is responsible for matters related to the promotion, demotion, and dismissal of postal personnel. It has always been managed according to established regulations, guaranteeing the rights of tens of thousands of employees and consolidating the foundation of the postal service. The Auditing Department is responsible for auditing the national postal service's receipts and expenditures and supervising accounting. Its strictness has ensured the clarity of postal finances. The new organizational law does not provide for the establishment of these two departments, which must be assigned to other departments. If they are divided or separated from the Bureau's organization, the entire postal system and its structure will inevitably be disrupted. The theory is unsound, the facts are fraught with difficulties, and the resulting malpractices will cause widespread suspicion and fear, which is not beneficial to the communications industry. Therefore, these two departments should continue to be handled by the Bureau to maintain consistency and preserve the old regulations. In summary, the above three points are matters of concern for the future of the postal service and cannot be ignored. It is appropriate to submit this document for consideration and forward it to the Ministry of Communications of the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Legislative Yuan approve amendments to the organizational law of the Directorate General of Posts, which would be mutually beneficial to both the public and the postal service. Furthermore, the position of Postal Inspector, while important and appointed by the Ministry of Communications, is not explicitly stipulated in the new organizational law. It seems appropriate to request an amendment to include it. Respectfully submitted to Qian, Director General of the Directorate General of Posts, August 4th, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Two Courts Officially Opened Yesterday <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The newly established Higher and District Courts of China within the French Concession of this city, after taking over the French Public Concession on July 31, were established the following day. Due to the urgency of the time, the internal organization was not yet complete. Therefore, only yesterday, at 10:00 a.m., did they officially open and begin accepting new and old civil and criminal cases. However, the Third Branch of the Higher Court, because the original French Public Concession did not have an appeals mechanism, had no previous appeals cases to hear. New appeals cases have not yet been completed by the prosecutor. Therefore, the High Court will actually need several more days before it can officially open.</p>

<p>Case of Chinese Policeman Shot</p>
<h3 id="e206">Shanghai Municipal Council Attempts to Settle with Compensation <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Decision to Send Another Letter for Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>The case of the Chinese policeman shot on Hart Road has not been resolved despite repeated negotiations by the Municipal Government with the Shanghai Municipal Council, due to the Council's persistent delays. According to information obtained from investigations by both the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Municipal Government, the Council, after receiving the Municipal Government's request for mediation, sent representatives to discuss the matter with the Municipal Government. They were willing to offer generous compensation to the injured policeman, but they still refused to admit fault or accept guarantees regarding the punishment of the assailant. As a result, the talks were inconclusive. The Municipal Government stated that it considered the case to be a whole incident, and that it was concerned with clarifying right and wrong and bringing the assailant to justice, not simply settling the matter with more money. If the purpose of the negotiations was solely for monetary compensation, the Municipal Government would not have bothered to handle the case. The case is of a criminal nature. If the criminal part is not resolved, the civil part cannot be discussed. It is regrettable that the Shanghai Municipal Council has misunderstood the objective and has not resolved the matter quickly and reasonably. Therefore, the Municipal Government has decided to send another letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council for serious negotiations and to urge a swift resolution and response.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Society received an urgent telegram from the Yexian County Flood Relief Committee in Henan Province: "Yexian County is unfortunate and has repeatedly suffered disasters. Calamities and disasters have occurred in succession, and the people cannot bear it. Unexpectedly, in June, another flood disaster occurred, destroying countless houses. Grain and livestock were washed away. Many of the good fields in the countryside were turned into gullies. Many people were injured or killed. Such a catastrophe is unprecedented in the past thirty years. The autumn harvest is now hopeless, and it is increasingly difficult to prepare for winter," etc. They also received a telegram from the Suiping County Relief Branch in Henan Province: "Since July 9th, heavy rain has fallen in Suiping County, without ceasing for days, causing mountain floods to erupt and the entire county to become a swamp. All crops were washed away, and more than twenty embankments collapsed. Many families lost all their members. Countless livestock were washed away. The estimated losses amount to tens of millions. Winter is approaching, and how will we survive? Under the threat of hunger and cold, taking risks is even more worrisome," etc. They also received a telegram from various institutions and groups in Gaochun County, Jiangsu Province: "Since the summer, the people of Chunyi have suffered from the backflow of the Yangtze River and the flooding of lakes. Furthermore, there has been continuous rain for ten days, causing mountain floods to erupt. As a result, dikes have collapsed, fields and crops have been flooded, houses have collapsed, and livestock have been swept away. In the entire territory, two hundred and twenty dikes have been submerged, with no fewer than one hundred and several tens of dikes having sunk one after another. Starving people are everywhere, and their cries shake the heavens. The tragic situation cannot be described in words," etc. They also received telegrams from the Chaoxian County Government and the Agricultural Association Red Cross in Anhui Province: "Chaoxian County has suffered from heavy rain for ten days, causing mountain floods to erupt. All dikes in the county have collapsed. Grain and goods have been swept away. The estimated losses are difficult to calculate. Currently, there are more than 100,000 people without food or shelter," etc. They also received a public letter from various institutions and groups in Guoyang County, Anhui Province: "Our county has suffered from repeated disasters in recent years. Unfortunately, in July of this year, there was continuous rain again, causing the rivers to burst and flood, inundating fields and houses, and scattering the people. The property losses are incalculable. Cultivation has been delayed, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Now, there are starving people everywhere, crying for food. The sight is heartbreaking and unbearable," etc. They also received a telegram from Fengyang, Anhui: "The Huai River has flooded, inundating countless fields and houses. 100,000 disaster victims have no place to go and cannot get food," etc. They also received a telegram from various groups in Anhui Qiu: "Heavy rain has been falling continuously, and mountain floods and river tides have increased, creating a vast expanse of water.

The disaster is extremely severe, and the autumn harvest is hopeless," etc. They also received a telegram from the Hunan Xiang Flood Relief Association: "Hunan Province has suffered from repeated military conflicts and bandits in recent years. The people are dying and lying on pillows, a tragic sight beyond description. However, since the beginning of this summer, there has been continuous rain, causing mountain floods to erupt. Fields, houses, people, livestock, and property have been washed away in countless quantities. Deaths are recorded on the roads, and cries shake the heavens. The losses have already reached tens of millions of yuan, and the number of casualties has reached hundreds of thousands. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and there is no livelihood," etc.</p>

<p>Letters and Telegrams Received by the Jisheng Society</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a telegram forwarded by the society's committee member, Mr. Ding Junjiahou, from the Anhui Provincial Charity Federation, stating: "The Anhui Province has been flooded due to continuous rain for a long time, turning cities into swamps. The Guangji Embankment, which is the lifeline for the people's food supply in the provincial capital, collapsed on You Day, causing countless deaths and drownings. It is a tragic situation beyond description. Emergency relief is being distributed in various ways. Please grant a large sum of money to save the hungry and drowning, and please reply by telegram," etc. They also received a telegram from the Guangji Embankment Flood Relief Association, stating that the collapse of the Guangji Embankment has left more than 200,000 disaster victims waiting to be rescued and urging urgent relief. They are eagerly awaiting orders, etc. Furthermore, more than 100 zhang of the northwest embankment of the Guangcheng Embankment collapsed and washed away due to failure to rescue it in time. Countless people and livestock were drowned and washed away. Representative Xu Pingxuan came to the association with mail and telegrams to request relief. In addition, Zhai Zhancheng, director of flood relief at the Wuhu branch of the association, reported that the Mahu Fenglin Shanrui Embankment and the smaller embankments in Wuhu were almost entirely destroyed. The embankments that have not been breached are in imminent danger. The streets and roads are several feet deep in water. The affected farmers are bringing their elderly and children into the city to take shelter in temples and on the embankments, exposed to the wind and rain and unable to get a full meal all day. Their homes have been flooded, and their belongings have been lost. The sorrowful and tragic situation is indescribable. The Jinbaoren Embankment in the northern rural area of Xuan County, the Xihang West River Embankment in the western rural area, and the Taifeng Embankment and Lingdu Embankment in Nanling have all collapsed, resulting in hundreds of deaths. More than 100,000 mu of fields in each embankment have been destroyed. Starving people are everywhere, a tragic sight beyond description. They are waiting for relief to prolong their lives. The association has allocated 5,000 yuan each for emergency relief in the Guangji Embankment and various embankments in Wuhu, and has remitted the funds to Mr. Ding and Director Zhai to expedite emergency relief. Furthermore, more than 20 counties in northern Anhui, including Su County, Fuyang, Yingshang, Si County, Wuhe, Linhuai, Fengtai, and Huaiyuan, central Anhui, including Hefei, Huoshan, and Quanjiao, and southern Anhui, including Wanzhi, Fanchang, and Dongliu, have suffered from severe floods or hailstorms, resulting in dire circumstances and unbearable suffering for the people. The disasters are severe, with only minor variations. They are sending telegrams and weeping, lamenting the impossibility of providing relief. The association has been providing relief for more than ten years, and the relief efforts have been particularly heavy in recent years, exhausting all resources and lacking the means to cook rice. The lives of the people are hanging by a thread, and their cries to heaven go unanswered. It is hoped that kind people and charitable organizations at home and abroad will offer help and donate generously. For example, the World Book Company generously made a vow to donate the full day's proceeds from book sales to help with relief, contributing more than 1,300 yuan to Anhui relief. Such initiatives will hopefully inspire others to contribute, and the dying disaster victims will have cause to celebrate their survival.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Two Anhui Charities Beg for Flood Relief <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Letter to Xu Jingren</p>
<p>The Anqing Branch of the World Red Cross Society and the Anhui Provincial Private Charity Federation sent a letter to Mr. Xu Jingren on August 3rd: "Before the flames of war have died down, floods have struck again. The Guangji Embankment near our province and city suddenly collapsed after You Day, severing the lifeline of the people's food supply in several counties along the Yangtze River. The disaster area is hundreds of miles wide, directly affecting hundreds of thousands of people and indirectly affecting millions of people. The provincial capital and important cities along the river have seen businesses close and the population cease working. Boats travel on the thoroughfares, accompanied by fish and shrimp. Vegetables and other delicacies are now considered insignificant, and mountain fowl have become weeds. People are eating cattle to survive, caring only for the present and neglecting the future. The cries of starving people are everywhere, and rescue is difficult. Our two associations dispatched dozens of staff members the day after the disaster on You Day, traveling by boat in the rain to distribute pancakes and steamed buns, rotating daily to distribute dry food, totaling 60 million jin. The Provincial Government convened a meeting yesterday, passed regulations, and elected standing committee members. Before the Flood Relief Committee of the government is organized, the charitable organizations will continue to raise funds and distribute emergency relief to save the starving people. Therefore, in addition to entrusting Mr. Fu Shunsheng in Shanghai to make an appeal nearby, we have specifically designated Representative Wang Duzhai to bring ten copies of disaster photos and sincerely visit your residence to personally present the disaster situation and emergency relief measures. We know that you are a great philanthropist who is concerned about hunger and drowning and has compassion for the world. During this time of widespread catastrophe, it is time to spread your benevolence widely. We earnestly beg you to have pity on the suffering and provide early rescue.

<h3 id="e211">A Candid Discussion on the Jiangning Flood Disaster <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Leng Jun, the Magistrate of Jiangning County, was publicly recommended by the local community to come to Shanghai to raise relief funds. This was reported in a previous issue. Yesterday, our reporter visited him at his residence, and the following is a record of his conversation. The flood disaster in Jiangning this time is exceptionally severe, the worst seen in recent decades. Since the beginning of summer this year, there have been continuous wind and rain for weeks, causing mountain torrents and rivers to rise simultaneously. The water level has overflowed and there is no way to release it. On July 24th, from morning till evening, torrential rain poured down, and in an instant, the water depth on the flat ground reached several feet. Except for the 382nd district, which suffered less due to the mountainous terrain, almost all other districts in the county were turned into a watery expanse. Seventy to eighty percent of the large and small embankments were submerged and destroyed, and those that have not yet collapsed are in imminent danger. The loss of fields, houses, and livestock is countless. According to reports from district and township heads, the estimated area of affected farmland is over 400,000 mu, and the affected population is approximately 100,000. In addition to the three existing shelters, they are still insufficient to meet the urgent needs. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway line from Xiaguan to Yaohuamen is lined with flood victims on both sides. Some have built temporary shelters with straw mats, while others are temporarily staying on high ground, exposed to wind and dew, in a state of extreme misery. The county government has not only submitted requests to the provincial authorities for relief and participated in the capital's emergency relief efforts, but also publicly recommended representatives to come to Shanghai to raise donations. They have already contacted Ningbo gentlemen and major philanthropists in Shanghai, and the results have been quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Inspection of Ningbo Ships Arriving with Epidemics <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Remarks by Director Hu</p>
<p>Reliable reports from the seaport quarantine indicate that a small number of cholera cases have occurred in Yin County recently. The bureau has specially collaborated with the Municipal Health Bureau to implement inspections of passengers on Ningbo ships entering the port. The Municipal Health Bureau has dispatched quarantine doctors to conduct inspections. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited the bureau director, Mr. Hu Hongji, to inquire about the current situation of quarantine. He replied as follows:</p>
<p>Quarantine of Ningbo Ships Mr. Hu stated that during the period when seasonal epidemics are about to occur, all major ports around the world have health authorities established by their respective countries' major cities, which dispatch permanent doctors to designated sea lines where ships anchor before entering the port. The quarantine doctors thoroughly examine the physical condition of all passengers on board for any signs of infectious diseases. At the same time, stool samples are collected from each passenger. Only those whose stool samples are found to be free of infectious bacteria are allowed to disembark. For example, when Japanese ships enter Nagasaki, the local health authorities' quarantine work is meticulous and often continues day and night, with some inspections taking more than a day. Shanghai is a place with a diverse population and dense population. Cholera is rampant every year, and the number of deaths is alarming. To prevent problems before they occur, the bureau's work during this year's cholera prevention period is more active than in previous years. After all, when an epidemic breaks out in a major city in any country, it directly creates a continuous link with the international community. Since the true cholera disease occurred in Ningbo, the bureau immediately implemented inspections of Ningbo ships entering the port after receiving the report. This started on August 1st. However, the shipping industry initially had requests due to business hours. The bureau also provided special convenience to shipping companies in the quarantine procedures. When Ningbo ships arrive at Songkou at 4:00 AM every morning, the bureau's six doctors stationed in Wusong take small boats to the ships when they display the signal lights (i.e., three red lights) to conduct quarantine and administer vaccinations, as well as test stool samples. It takes one to two hours from Songkou to the dock where the ships stop at the Bund, and the doctors' quarantine and vaccinations also take only three to four hours. Therefore, there is actually no impact on the shipping companies' business. The results of the inspections in recent days have been good. True cholera has rarely been found among the passengers. However, all passengers must be forcibly injected with preventive vaccines by the doctors.</p>
<p>Vaccination Work August 1st was the first day of implementing quarantine for Ningbo ships entering the port. However, because the port companies of each ship had not notified the ship captains in advance, the doctors sent by the Municipal Health Bureau on the first day did not receive a formal inspection. When the Taikoo Xinjing Beijing ship entered the port on the second day, 760 people were vaccinated and 14 stool samples were checked. On the Ningshao ship, 520 people were vaccinated and 10 stool samples were checked. There were no sailings on the third day. On the fourth day, 600 people were vaccinated on the Xinjiang Tian ship and 10 stool samples were checked. Approximately 1,000 people were vaccinated on the Ningxing ship and 15 stool samples were checked. On the fifth day, 600 people were vaccinated on the New Beijing ship and 18 stool samples were checked. 600 people were vaccinated on the Xin Ning Shao ship and 14 stool samples were checked. On the sixth day, 600 people were vaccinated on the Xinjiang Tian ship and 21 stool samples were checked. 640 people were vaccinated on the Ningxing ship and 20 stool samples were checked. These are the approximate figures for vaccinations and stool sample inspections in recent days, but fortunately, no cholera patients have entered the port.</p>

<p>Authorized Capital of 600,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Board of Directors and Supervisors Elected</p>
<p>In March of this year, leaders in the silk industry and prominent figures in the financial world in this city jointly initiated the organization of a Silk Industry Bank, with the aim of regulating finance and benefiting society. The original capital of the bank was set at 500,000 yuan. However, due to the enthusiastic subscription of shares by various silk industry groups and the warm support from all sectors, the number of subscribed shares exceeded the fixed amount, so it was revised to 600,000 yuan. All preparatory matters have been completed, and the share capital has also been fully paid up. The bank held a shareholders' founding meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month. The articles of association were passed on the spot, and Wang Yansong, Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Linshu, Lu Zhengbing, Zhang Danru, Pei Yunqing, Feng Zhongqing, Hu Xisheng, Shen Qinzhai, Yu Guozhen, and Chen Ziming were elected as directors.

<p>The Special District Court Schedules a Hearing</p>
<p>The case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinkang ship being sunk by the Japanese ship Ryuyo Maru has been going on for more than two years, with no progress in the negotiations. The dead are drowned at the bottom of the sea, and the living are in pain. Continuing to delay this matter is not a way to comfort the dead and reassure the living. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had already filed a lawsuit for damages with the Shanghai Special District Court. Several summonses have been issued, but because the other party has not arrived, the case has not progressed. All the families of the victims have also entrusted lawyers Wu Jingxiong and Sheng Zhenwei to file a petition with the court, requesting a judgment ordering compensation for damages, totaling 1,110,862.27 national currency, and bearing the litigation costs. After the court received the petition, considering the importance of the matter, it has now scheduled a hearing for the morning of the 15th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Stabbed to Death with Multiple Knives <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Revenge Killing? ... Murder?</p>
<p>At 6:45 AM yesterday morning, a man was stabbed to death with multiple knives at the entrance of Xicheng Lane on Avenue Ruì Brénier, French Concession. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tragic Cry for Help At 6:30 AM yesterday morning, residents near Xicheng Lane were still sound asleep when they suddenly heard a tragic cry for help. They got out of bed to watch and saw the deceased lying diagonally at the entrance of the lane. The four murderers fled towards Avenue Lafayette and through Xicheng Lane towards Avenue Foch, leaving no trace. At that time, a growing number of onlookers gathered. The patrol station on Songshan Road was notified and immediately led patrols to investigate. The deceased was wearing a white silk long gown, with a white cotton short shirt and trousers underneath, black socks and black shoes, and the soft-brimmed straw hat he was wearing on his head had been thrown at the entrance of the lane. Blood was all over the ground. It was counted that there was one knife wound on his back, which was pulled out by the patrolmen afterwards, one knife wound on his chest, and one knife wound on each side of his waist. He was immediately taken by car to the coroner's office.</p>
<p>Eyewitness Account According to eyewitnesses, the deceased left the lane alone at around 6:30 AM yesterday morning and hired a rickshaw to the North Railway Station, agreeing on the fare. Just as he was about to get into the rickshaw, four people resembling workers suddenly rushed out from behind the deceased, each taking out a sharp knife. They first stabbed the deceased severely in the back with a knife, which went deep into the flesh, and then stabbed him in the chest, which the deceased pulled out himself. He was stabbed in each side of the waist, and blood gushed out. The deceased died instantly. The murderers fled in southwest directions.</p>
<p>Family Report At that time, many people gathered to watch, and the deceased's eldest son, Daquan, also learned that there was news of a pedestrian being stabbed to death at the entrance of the lane. He ran out to watch and, upon seeing that it was his father, turned back to inform his mother and blew a whistle madly. As the number of onlookers increased, the deceased's wife, Jin, and concubine, Chen, arrived and mourned over the body. According to the deceased's wife, Yao, the deceased's surname was Huang, named Haiqing, 38 years old, from Wuwei County, Anhui Province, formerly residing at No. 8 Fengyu Lane on Avenue Foch, and recently moved to No. 54 Xicheng Lane for only two months. The deceased previously worked as a gatekeeper patrolman at the baseball field on Avenue de l'Observatoire in the French Concession. He was dismissed nearly three years ago. He also opened the Changjiang Public Apartment on Caishi Road in the Caishi Fang the year before, but closed it down last spring, so his finances were extremely tight. He had just taken up the position of squad leader of the fourth district detective team of the Wusong Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Public Security Team five days ago, but had not yet reported for duty. Therefore, he took a car to the Wusong district headquarters to report for duty this morning, but unexpectedly he was brutally murdered by bandits as soon as he left his house.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Huang Haiqing's Portrait <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Court Examination The patrol station reported to the Second Court of the Special District, and Prosecutor Ding Shikui was appointed to examine the body at the coroner's office at 10:00 AM, accompanied by a clerk and a forensic doctor. He took his seat in court. The detective reported the previous situation and presented the two murder weapons to the court. After Mr. Ding questioned the deceased's wife, Huang Jin, he ruled that the deceased Huang Haiqing had indeed been stabbed to death before his death, and allowed the deceased's wife to sign a certificate to claim the body for coffining and burial, pending the patrol station's arrest of the murderer for investigation. After the examination, the patrol station took photos of the body, and the family members collected it in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Condition of the Deceased's Family The deceased had one wife and one concubine, who lived together in a two-story building at No. 54 Xicheng Lane. The wife lived in the front building and the concubine lived in the back building. The wife, Jin, 36 years old, had three sons: the eldest, Dajin, 14 years old; the second, Sanbaozi, 9 years old; and the third, Laobazi, 5 years old. The concubine, Chen, 37 years old, had been with Huang for eight years and currently works as a nanny in a foreigner's home. She gave birth to twin sons a week ago, but one died young, and the other was named Shuangzi. The deceased's older brother, Huang Youshu, 48 years old, works at the Longhua Ordnance Pharmaceutical Factory and also lives with his younger brother and his family, relying entirely on the deceased for survival. Now that he has tragically fallen victim to bandits, the future is worrying.</p>
<p>Post-Incident Investigation According to friends of the deceased, the deceased was strong-willed and never showed mercy when handling official affairs, which often incurred the hatred of bandits. This brutal murder may have been carried out by bandits seeking revenge. According to neighbors of the deceased, the deceased had an affair with a woman surnamed [Omitted] and even caused a storm of jealousy. This murder may also be a case of adultery.</p>
<p>Wang Zengshou, Who Embezzled 200,000 Yuan,</p>
<h3 id="e220">Apprehended <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Accomplice Shi Wenhao Flees to Japan</p>
<p>Taichang Qianzhuang Sends Telegram Requesting Arrest</p>
<p>In January of this year, Shi Wenhao, a partner, and Wang Zengshou, an accountant, of Ruyi Lane's Taichang Qianzhuang colluded to embezzle a huge sum of 200,000 yuan and fled without a trace. After the associate manager of the qianzhuang noticed this, he immediately ordered other partners to check the accounts, reported it to the patrol station for arrest, and requested lawyer Jiang Yiping to represent him in posting a notice in various newspapers in Shanghai, offering a reward of 10,000 yuan for the arrest. However, after the notice was posted for a long time, there was still no trace of them. Later, at the request of Wang Zengshou's relatives and friends, the reward for the arrest was canceled in order to find them. The qianzhuang complied and requested the patrol station to cancel the reward and arrest order. Lawyer Jiang was then asked to post a notice in the newspaper canceling the arrest and reward. It was hoped that Shi and Wang would send someone to mediate and arrange things, but unexpectedly, half a year passed and there was still no news. Therefore, a report was filed with various neighboring district and inland government offices to try to capture them. The day before yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Dachang Town sent police to Shanghai to report to the qianzhuang that the fugitive Wang Zengshou had already been arrested in Dachang. According to his confession, the accomplice Shi Wenhao fled to Japan after the incident, while he himself could not leave because he had family. After Manager Luo of the qianzhuang heard the news, he rushed to the Dachang Public Security Bureau that night and requested that the case be transferred to the Special District Court of the Public Concession for trial. He also sent a secret telegram to the Japanese authorities, requesting that Shi Wenhao be arrested and brought back for interrogation.</p>
<p>A Wealthy Family from Xiaoshan Kidnapped</p>
<h3 id="e221">Contact Planned in Shanghai <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations at the Entrance of the Quelou Hotel</p>
<p>Chen Xuewen, Zhou Luren, et al., Arrested</p>
<p>Wang Guisheng, a wealthy family from Dayi, Xiaoshan County, Shaoxing, was kidnapped by bandits on the 23rd of last month. Later, his family received more than ten letters from the bandits, demanding a ransom of 52,000 yuan. The last letter instructed the Wang family to send someone to open a room at the Quelou Hotel on Xizang Road in Shanghai on August 4th, with the name Wang Jianyi written on the room card. The person should carry one hat box from the Hangzhou Zhang Yun Sheng Hat Shop, one large and one small, and someone would come to contact them. After receiving the letter, the Wang family reported it to the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, which ordered detective team leader Zhu Xiaodong and deputy team leader He Yongfu to come to Shanghai. They filed a report with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, and Director Chen assigned detective Gao Wansheng to report to the Old Gate Patrol Station. The patrol head ordered detectives Xu Zexin and Feng Xiushan to go to the Quelou Hotel and open rooms 75 and 76, following the instructions in the bandit's letter. At 5:15 PM the day before yesterday, the detectives received a phone call from the bandits, instructing the Wang family representative to come down to the hotel entrance for negotiations. The Hangzhou detective Qi Yunjian pretended to be the representative and waited at the hotel entrance, while the other detectives were scattered around in ambush. Before long, Chen Xuewen and Zhou Luren, both from Shaoxing, came to talk to Qi and were arrested. At that time, there was also a Shanghai man named Cao Jinsheng, who was arrested after the detectives suspected his behavior. They were all taken to the patrol station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special District Court. The patrol station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that Chen and Zhou had just arrived in Shanghai two days ago, which showed that their trip was purely for the purpose of negotiating the ransom. Cao Jinsheng was a chauffeur who had dropped off his master, Wang Shanzhi, at Yipinxian and then got out of the car to play. He did not know how he had been arrested for suspicious behavior. After investigation, it was found that he was not involved and should be released. The Public Security Bureau requested to transfer Chen and Zhou, and the patrol station did not object. Presiding Judge Zhou Hanting verified the report and questioned the three defendants. He then ruled that Chen Xuewen and Zhou Luren be handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau for investigation. Cao Jinsheng was released on bail of 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Two Bandit Leaders Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Qian Weizhu Sentenced to Fifteen Years</p>
<p>Xu and Sun Sentenced to Eight Years Each</p>
<p>Yang Aquan, a Chinese detective, and Shen Yuzhou and Liu Changgen, detectives from the Yangshupu Patrol Station, previously arrested Wang Zhenji, Wei Yuzhai, Qian Weizhu, Xu Guozhu, Sun Hongshun, Zhang Kejin, Zhang Han, Yang Chen, and suspects Qian Weizhong and Qian Shen, all from Jiangbei, and confiscated two pistols and seven bullets. It was found that between February and June of this year, they used firearms to rob Weng Dachu at No. 1384 Dongyangshupu Road and opened fire to harm Indian patrolmen Kena Xing and Xu Guisheng at an unnumbered address on Qiqihaer Road, as well as Zhang Wang, a woman on Dagu Road, of clothing, jewelry, and silver worth more than 200 yuan. Wang Zhenji, Dong Yuzhai, and Qian Weizhu also attempted to kidnap Chen Bingxiang, a Cantonese, on Morrison Road at 9:00 PM on June 17, but he escaped. The patrol station sent the suspects to the First Court of the Special District. After the interrogation was completed, Presiding Judge Feng Shide took his seat in the Third Court yesterday morning and sentenced Wang Zhenji and Dong Yuzhai to death, Qian Weizhu to fifteen years in prison, and Xu Guozhu and Sun Hongshun to eight years in prison each. Zhang Kejin and Zhang Han were each sentenced to three months in prison, and Yang Chen was sentenced to two months in prison. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be equivalent to one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention. The two pistols and seven bullets were confiscated. Qian Weizhong and Qian Shen were found not guilty. Sun Hongshun had committed other crimes in the French Concession and was sent back to that court for execution after the sentence was carried out. The clothing of the deceased Chen San was stored in the warehouse.</p>

<p>Automobile Pleasure Cruise Yang Cheng Biao, 24, from Tongzhou, a ticket seller at the Tianchan Theater, was the nephew of Gu Zhuxuan. Yesterday morning at 4:00 AM, he and three friends hired a chauffeur-driven car and went for a pleasure cruise in the Wusong area. Before they were far from their destination, when the car was turning, it collided with a telephone pole on the side of the road because it was going too fast. With a loud bang, the car was smashed to pieces. Yang and his friend Lu Xiugui jumped out of the car, but Lu only suffered minor injuries to his face and hands. However, Yang Cheng Biao's brain was splattered and his breath was weak. His friends immediately hired a car and rushed him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died around 7:00 AM.</p>
<p>Touching Electrical Wire While Washing Hands Donghai Cinema, at Tilanqiao, invited the famous "Tang Fei" of the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade to perform "Immortal Carrying" and various martial arts last night. Ah Cai, a coppersmith from the fire brigade, about 30 years old, went to help out. Because his hands were dirty, he saw a jar of water on the ground backstage and bent down to wash them. Unexpectedly, there was electricity in the water, and he touched it with both hands, and died on the spot. He was taken to the Tongren Hospital and transferred to the coroner's office by fire engine, pending a court examination.</p>
<p>Poor Swimming Skills Yu Shuanglin, 30, a worker at the Xiangtai Lumber Company in Yangshupu, went to the Lan Road River to take a cold bath the night before. Unfortunately, he was not good at swimming and drowned. It was not until about 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon that the body floated to the surface of the water. A pedestrian saw it and called a Chinese patrolman from No. 2624 to come and retrieve the body. It was taken to the Tongren Hospital and transferred to the Fielun Road coroner's office for examination.</p>
<p>Falling from a Height A woman named Yang Ada, 12, from Anhui Province, was employed as a maid by a family at No. 210 Avenue Foch in the French Concession. At 10:40 AM yesterday morning, she was playing with her young master on the balcony when she accidentally fell and died from her injuries. The owner immediately took the child's body to the Renji Hospital and reported it to the patrol station. Bao Tan Wang Licheng was ordered to go to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to report to the Second Special District Court for examination.</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Plans to</p>
<h3 id="e223">Establish a Poor People's Loan in the Public Concession <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Depending on Whether It Can Get Assistance from the Public Works Department</p>
<p>There are many poor people in this city, and it is difficult for them to make a living. They suffer greatly from high-interest loans (such as "printing money"). Since the municipal government established poor people's loan offices in Nanshi and Zhabei, the poor people in the north and south cities have been able to gradually eliminate the oppression of high-interest loans. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is in charge of this matter. Recently, it has produced hundreds of porcelain-enameled loan notices and distributed them to Nanshi trams and public buses in the north and south cities, so that the poor can know that there are places to borrow money and will no longer have to borrow printing money. In view of recent reports of Indians and a few Chinese people lending printing money in the concession and committing various cruel and brutal acts, it is eager to promote poor people's loans in the concession to alleviate the suffering of the poor. However, the situation in the concession is special and difficult to handle. Unless it can get the sincere assistance of the Public Works Department and its affiliated agencies, it will be difficult to do so. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, which said:</p>
<p>"It has been reported that Indians and a small number of Chinese people are lending printing money in the concession, which is cruel. This Bureau cannot help but feel sad. Since the city established the first and second loan offices in Nanshi and Zhabei, the poor people in those areas have rarely suffered from borrowing printing money. The poor people in the concession are also our Chinese citizens, and we should treat them equally. Now, in order to help the poor, the poor people living in the Public Concession can also borrow money from the first and second poor people's loan offices in this city, according to the regulations of the poor people's loan offices in this city. However, the prerequisite is whether it can get the sincere cooperation and assistance of your bureau and its affiliated agencies. For example, in order to prove the household registration of the borrower and to track down the absconding borrowers, this city has the assistance of the various district offices of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The investigators of the loan office also need the assistance and protection of the local police when they go out to fulfill their duties. If your bureau and its affiliated agencies can provide the same assistance as the Municipal Public Security Bureau, this Bureau will send personnel to your bureau to discuss the detailed implementation plan as soon as a reply is received, in order to benefit the poor people. Attached is a copy of the second collection of the Bureau's laws and regulations, in which the regulations of the poor people's loan offices are on page 99. Please check it."</p>
<p>If the Public Works Department can assist, the poor people in the concession can also slightly alleviate the suffering of their lives.</p>

<p>The Case of Maintenance Between Wu Li and Wu Shujun</p>
<p>Wu Li, a young woman from Ningbo, previously hired lawyer Jin Yu to file a complaint with the former Shanghai French Public Court, accusing her husband, Wu Shujun, of abandonment and failure to provide maintenance, requesting a judgment granting her living expenses of 20,000 yuan. The court approved the complaint and ordered a summons. Presiding Judge Zhu adjudicated the case on the last day of his term.

<p>Pan Deping, an employee of the Universal Savings Society, is a young and handsome gentleman who often goes to various dance halls during his spare time to do the foxtrot. Therefore, he is often seen at the gates of the Moon Palace and Great East dance halls. The night before, Pan went to the Great East dance hall and danced with Ren Qiuyue, a dance hostess from Suzhou (16 years old, living at No. 2, Alley 1, Daqing Lane, Great Horse Road). When they became bored at around 3 a.m. the next morning, they went on a suburban tour with Ren Qiuyue and another dance hostess, Lu Xiaomei (17 years old, from Suzhou). They hired a No. 7624 covered truck from a certain car dealership at No. 72 Guangxi Road, driven by the driver Ma Fuzhen, and asked him to drive them around the western suburbs of Shanghai. Because it was late at night and there were few pedestrians, Ma stepped on the gas pedal, driving at full speed, with the semblance of soaring through the clouds. Unexpectedly, misfortune is unpredictable. When the car arrived at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Seymour Road, it crashed into a big tree by the roadside with a screech. The bumper and headlights of the car were severely damaged. Ren Qiuyue injured her head, but the others were unharmed. Afterwards, she was taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment by car.</p>

<p>Xiao Yunlu, a native of Hunan, recently opened the Beihai Chun Restaurant at No. 113 in Jiumu Di. Because he hung up signs everywhere, he covered up the porcelain house number nailed up by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. Later, Xiao heard from others that the house number could not be obscured, lest he be fined. Thereupon, Xiao privately made a piece of No. 113 house number with lead skin and white paint and nailed it to the door. It was spotted by patrolman Chen Lirong, who took Xiao to the First Sub-station of the Second District for violating the police regulations after prying off the privately made house number. After questioning, Xu, the chief of the sub-station, found that Xiao Yunlu's private manufacture of the house number was due to a misunderstanding of what people said.

<p>Chen Decai and Wang Keming Arrested</p>
<p>Recently, a type of robber has been discovered in the city. They specialize in pretending to sell counterfeit cigarettes in various streets and alleys. When ordinary pedestrians stop to watch, these people will squeeze the viewers and search for money. At about 7 AM yesterday, Gu Baoru, a native of Wuxi who worked at the Ningyi Public Customs Brokerage at No. 28 Yongan Lane, Yongan Street in the French Concession, was carrying more than 200 yuan in paper money to the south, intending to go to the Dasheng Storage at Shengyi Wharf to pick up goods. Unexpectedly, when he arrived at Shengyi Wharf, a stranger holding a cigarette came forward and said, "Sir, please try this cigarette. It is the latest product. This product has good tobacco and the price is right. Please try it, and you will know that I am not lying." At that time, another accomplice immediately stepped forward and lit a lighter to invite Gu to smoke. Upon seeing this, Gu immediately stopped and stared blankly. Suddenly, two more bandits came up from behind, taking advantage of Gu's unpreparedness, and squeezed Gu in an attempt to search for money. Gu, knowing that he was being robbed, desperately broke free and ran to Yuan Huirong, the police officer at the Dasheng Storage of the First Sub-station of the First District, to report. Yuan Huirong rushed to the scene and arrested the two bandits who were pretending to sell cigarettes and took them back to the sub-station. During the preliminary trial by the chief of the sub-station, Gu recounted the whole story and requested that they be punished. Questioned, the two criminals confessed their names as Chen Decai, 31 years old, from Yancheng, residing in a certain inn on Taiping Bridge, and Wang Keming, 34 years old, from Yuyao, and both claimed to make a living selling cigarettes. The rest of their confessions were vague. They were ordered to prepare a document and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>At about 10 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, a man dressed in blue cloth pants, naked on his upper body, and resembling a coolie suddenly came to the Dongjiadu Wharf in Nanshi. Taking advantage of people's lack of preparation, he jumped into the Huangpu River. Upon hearing the sound, boatmen rushed to the scene to rescue him. However, it was dark at the time, and the man was not seen emerging for a long time after entering the water, so the rescue was unsuccessful. Spectators all said that he must have been buried in the belly of a fish and sighed in succession. Unexpectedly, the corpse suddenly emerged when the long-distance bus ferry from Shangnan arrived at the port the day before yesterday. After being reported to the Nanshi Wharf Lifesaving Bureau, the corpse was taken back and coffined and placed in a hall for identification.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Letter <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I am writing to you today to address a matter concerning the report in the Shanghai News section of the Shen Bao on the 5th, regarding the reorganization of the Wusong Water Police and the issuance of fishing boat flag licenses. The report stated that the Fourth District Headquarters hired a boat and sent personnel to implement inspections, but the flag license fee collected was more than ten times the prescribed amount, and even additional demands were made, causing great suffering to the boatmen. Reading this, I was greatly shocked. It has been verified that the issuance of fishing boat flag licenses was requested to the provincial government by the Wusong Chamber of Commerce and various boat gangs on their own initiative, not by the Fourth District of the Water Police proactively. After the district was ordered by the provincial government to investigate and reply for approval, the district chief set off to suppress bandits. All registration and fee collection procedures were handled by Yuan Xichou, the former section chief of the First Section, together with Mr. Zheng Shushan of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. In addition to collecting the prescribed labor and flag license fees, the district headquarters was not involved in any other extra charges. I am afraid that this will mislead the audience, so I am writing to your newspaper to correct the situation. With best regards, Yours sincerely, Huang Wenhan, Accountant of the Fourth District of the former Provincial Water Police Team, August 6th.</p>

<h3 id="e252">The Garret Room <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>Strangely, the term "garret room" in present-day Shanghai can almost be said to have become a specific designation, like "garret room life," "garret room literature." It's like the apartments of Peiping, possessing a unique, mysterious air. However, although I have never lived in one, I always find them unappetizing, even detestable. Needless to say, I have no desire to live in a garret room myself. Even if I see it mentioned in print or hear it in conversation, the phrase "garret room" immediately gives me a gray feeling—narrowness, disorder, air that is humid and musty, a listless, pale face, disheveled hair, a drooping head, a hunched back, withered and disappointed eyes. These things flash like a movie before my eyes, arousing my discomfort.</p>
<p>I remember one day I actually went into a garret room, but the impression I got was not at all what I imagined—and the unpleasantness was even more profound.</p>
<p>That day, it was just the weather for wearing velvet robes. Qin changed into a newly made velvet cheongsam and hurried to my room, asking me to accompany her to Jiangwan to see a friend.</p>
<p>"Where does he live?" I asked.</p>
<p>"A garret room," she said.</p>
<p>"Oh, a garret room." Narrowness, disorder… flashed through my brain again like lightning.</p>
<p>"I'm not going," I said.</p>
<p>"What? Not going? He's a good friend, please, come with me."</p>
<p>I was dragged and pulled by her until I finally agreed to go with her. We got off the train, took a rickshaw, and turned several corners.</p>
<p>"We're here," Qin said, and the rickshaw stopped.</p>
<p>"Garden Street No. ×××." I glanced at the house number and followed Qin through the gate. I don't remember how, but we turned a corner, and a staircase suddenly blocked our path. We went up the stairs. Qin said in a low voice,</p>
<p>"Look, that's the room."</p>
<p>Nailed to the door of the room on the left were two torn business cards. From the room came the sound of "pat, pat" mahjong tiles, mixed with a gentle, slightly flirtatious laughter. Qin gently knocked on the door a few times.</p>
<p>"Who is it? Come in," followed by the door creaking open.</p>
<p>"Helloooooo…"</p>
<p>"Heyyyyy…"</p>
<p>About five or six men and women inside rushed to greet Qin, and I followed her into the room. I suddenly felt cramped and uneasy and almost wanted to retreat.</p>
<p>Qin introduced me to everyone one by one. I just nodded slightly to everyone, standing unnaturally behind Qin.</p>
<p>"Please sit down," Qin's friend Xiaolan said very politely. He was a man with small eyes and a pointed face, wearing a celery-green silk lined robe, and suit pants dragging behind his heels.</p>
<p>"Uh," I responded in my nose, and sat down on a chair near the door.</p>
<p>Next to the chair were a lot of things piled up messily—a kerosene stove, with a tilted lead pot on top. In the pot, muddy water soaked a few spoons. A lead bucket, a tin kettle, a vegetable bowl, with a few pairs of chopsticks resting on top. I carefully positioned my feet, afraid of touching black soot or knocking something over.</p>
<p>"Sorry for disturbing your mahjong game," Qin said with a mocking smile.</p>
<p>"It's nothing," Xiaolan seemed to understand and explained, "This is just for relaxation, entertainment, leisure after class, it's nothing."</p>
<p>……………………………………</p>
<p>A girl with big eyes and high cheekbones was sitting at the head of the mahjong table, on a small iron bed covered with a blackish-gray (originally white) blanket. She glanced at Xiaolan, smiled at a man with a Cantonese accent sitting on her right, and tilted her head down to his shoulder. She deftly made a cylinder with her fingers, pressed it tightly against the man's left ear, pressed her blood-red thick lips against the edge of her thumb, and whispered to him. The man also smiled at Xiaolan.</p>
<p>Opposite the room were two small iron beds, which were the masters of Xiaolan and the Cantonese man. The Cantonese man had a tall figure, a dark face. What made him most recognizable was his big nose, which was a little disproportionate.</p>
<p>"Xiu, sing a song," said a man with a local accent, short and neatly dressed in a suit, to the girl standing by the window turning the pages of a songbook, while dragging the phonograph on the stool in front of him. "Falling Flowers and Flowing Water," is this the one? As he spoke, he started it up.</p>
<p>"No, who wants to sing this?" Xiu tilted her head slightly, but finally walked to the phonograph and sang in a high-pitched tone along with the record. She was very fair-skinned, and there were a few freckles on her round face, but they didn't make her look ugly. She had a nimble figure, often liked to prop her hand on her waist, which made her look even more graceful.</p>
<p>The singing interrupted Qin and Xiaolan's conversation.</p>
<p>"Sorry to neglect our new guest, this place is very messy," Xiaolan suddenly said to me humbly.</p>
<p>"No...this house is very clean," my voice was so low that I could barely hear myself.</p>
<p>"She, she likes silence," Qin said, turning around and smiling at me.</p>
<p>"Yes, diligent people always love silence," Xiaolan shrugged.</p>
<p>I smiled and said nothing.</p>
<p>"Xiaofeng, she doesn't like to talk much, do you understand?" Qin said, looking at me teasingly again.</p>
<p>"Haha…" Xiaolan laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"What is this, so annoying?" I thought.</p>
<p>Indeed, at this time I felt a kind of contempt, disgust, and wished I could run out immediately.</p>
<p>"If there's nothing else, we can go," I stood up and asked Qin.</p>
<p>"Go back? Anyway, there's nothing important, let's talk a bit more," Qin objected.</p>
<p>"Then, I'll go first, you can talk more," I resolutely said goodbye to them. They casually said a few words to persuade me to stay, and then sent me to the door. I vaguely heard them say,</p>
<p>"Her appearance is amiable, but her temperament is too aloof."</p>
<p>Then there was the sound of "pat, pat" of the mahjong tiles and teasing laughter again.</p>
<p>This was more than a year ago. Contempt and disgust still float in my mind.</p>
<p>When I left school this summer vacation, Lin asked me,</p>
<p>"What are you planning to do during this long vacation?"</p>
<p>"I really want to write something, but the place is too noisy," I said.</p>
<p>"You can do this, rent another garret room, just you alone, wouldn't it be very quiet?"</p>
<p>"Alas, how can I?" I shook my head and answered her. I knew very well that apart from studying, I wouldn't do anything else. I can't make a pot of edible rice with just the right amount of water, or pick up a basket to go to the market to buy some fish, meat, or vegetables. I can't do anything, so how can I be qualified to live in a garret room? But now I am really sitting in a garret room, and all day long.</p>
<p>It's been a week since I came back to my sister's place, and I can't read or write anything. My sister, she loves to gossip the most. The two nieces are lively and naughty. There are children crying in the front neighbor's house, and the neighbor on the left is playing mahjong and fighting. "I'm not afraid of these," I made a firm decision. I'll try to do things. When I pick up the pen, all I hear is "wa, wa wa…" "pat, crack," and only these complex sounds are fluctuating in my brain, and under the pen I can't help but repeatedly write these few words. "Let's change the taste," I went to get a book to read again, but on the pages, the rows of black words are clearly written, but I can't understand anything inside. "What to do, if this continues, it's really terrible," I was anxious all day, wanting to get a quieter place.</p>
<p>"A garret room, just you alone, wouldn't it be very quiet?" Lin's words suddenly repeated in my consciousness again, arousing my attention to the garret room at my sister's place.</p>
<p>The door of this room opens onto the sun deck. We have never gone inside. Last year, the amah lived there. This year, the amah moved downstairs, and it was just used to store things, boxes, wooden buckets, tin boxes, bamboo baskets… messily filled the room. Although the inside is not very big, it is very quiet. If you close the door on the sun deck and the door leading to the wing room, not a single bit of the noisy sounds outside will get in. So I started to clean up, stacked more than a dozen boxes into three piles, and arranged them against the wall in a row. I put a square table by the window, with a few useful books and ink, etc. Under the table, I just piled up some odds and ends of waste. The wooden buckets and tin boxes… were all slightly tidied up and stacked in the corner of the wall by the window.</p>
<p>"Oh, what an elaborate writing room," my sister said mockingly, but I thought the light was very good and was very satisfied.</p>
<p>The window faces the back gate of a government office, and the air is still fresh. A plane tree is planted at the back gate of the government office, and the dense green shade covers the entire alley in cool shade. When a gentle breeze blows, the leaves often make a rustling sound, giving people a light and happy feeling. At first, the room was a bit moldy, but later, after my diligent cleaning, it became very refreshing. After washing up every day, I sit at the square table by the window, quietly savoring the life of the garret room. No matter how noisy it is outside, it cannot move the strings of my silent heart. However, there is one annoying thing, the windows and doors on the second floor of the government office face each other, and the clerks inside often deliberately cough loudly during their leisure time, shush, shush...</p>

<h3 id="e259">New York Working Women's Life (10) <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The daily life of a woman earning thirty to forty dollars a week, our friend A'Dai'er Lan Bao, is as follows:</p>
<p>The clock strikes eight, A'Dai'er stretches, still curled up in the comfortable warmth of her quilt. She feels a little ache in her legs, but soon forgets it.</p>
<p>A'Dai'er works as a model in a clothing wholesaler. She lives in a shared apartment. The landlords are a young couple who rent out the extra rooms to reduce their huge expenses. A'Dai'er has freedom to come and go. She uses the apartment for socialising, which greatly frustrates the landlords. A'Dai'er pays ten dollars a week for rent. The room is simply furnished, although she has added a few knotted pillows, three French dolls, and several Maxfield Parrish prints.</p>
<p>A'Dai'er originally came to New York to pursue a career on stage. In fact, she spent four weeks in theatre, selected for a musical troupe. She was carefree and very happy. The rehearsal period lasted a month, during which the actors were of course not paid. Then they performed for three days in a small theater in the suburbs, before returning for another week of rehearsals. This final week also had no pay. Finally, the troupe performed at a theatre in New York, but after three weeks of poor business, it closed. A'Dai'er felt that a life in theatre was too unstable for her financial situation. She found a new position as a model in a clothing store. This job was long and mentally tiring, but the wages were reliable. A'Dai'er initially earned thirty dollars a week, but later found another position paying thirty-five dollars a week.</p>
<p>Getting up in the morning is truly painful. This is the busiest time for clothing wholesalers. How much A'Dai'er would like to sleep until noon. She jumps out of bed, takes a bath, and gets dressed – the procedure is very simple.</p>
<p>A'Dai'er goes to a cheap restaurant for breakfast. This restaurant is on Broadway. She needs to eat something to sustain her through the morning's work, because she has learned from experience that she is prone to fainting if she doesn't eat.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if she is five or ten minutes late for work, unless it becomes a habit. She usually arrives at the clothing store at a quarter past nine.</p>
<p>In the clothing wholesale store, models are treated like business supplies. These women wear thin undershirts and short, tight-fitting camisoles, so that the clothes fit well. If they are not busy, they sit in the storage room in their camisoles, and when they feel cold and bored, they can smoke a cigarette to relieve their boredom. Although they wear very little clothing, no one pays them much attention. When buyers come in, the models must try on various clothes for them to see. There is a special skill to wearing clothes. A'Dai'er's limited stage experience helps a lot, because she knows how to handle her figure. Each piece of clothing must be put on and taken off, taken off and put on. The models should always look happy and cheerful. Sometimes, salespeople behave rudely or insultingly towards the models. The girls have to ignore it completely.</p>
<p>A'Dai'er often helps to sell clothes. Perhaps one day she will sell them herself, although she does not yet have sufficient experience to do so. Moreover, she feels unstable and lacks a sense of responsibility. She knows that one day she will get married. She is currently quite satisfied with her lifestyle.</p>
<p>The clothes she wears as samples are specially made for her, so they fit perfectly. She walks back and forth in the clothes. It is truly a hard and laborious task, but she makes it look happy and joyful. When the salesperson places a large order for the clothes she is wearing, the manager pats her back to indicate approval.</p>
<p>This particular morning, the store is very busy. Many out-of-town customers are gathered inside. The girls have to work twice as fast. Several people are waiting in the dressing room to help them put on and take off clothes. The manager walks in and says, "Girls, you only have half an hour for lunch today. We need to show all the clothes to four major buyers. Make sure you are not late."</p>
<p>The girls don't show obvious satisfaction with this announcement. "Ah, that's unlucky, who do you think I am, your slave?" Similar curses are muttered behind the manager's back, but all the girls return to the store on time. They run to a nearby diner and eat some hot sandwiches and steamed buns, etc. This menu is slightly different from usual, because the girls pay close attention to their diet. If they gain weight, their positions will be in jeopardy. During the meal, they talk a lot about the work situation. These girls are all very familiar with each other, so they speak without reservation. They know nothing of outward modesty.</p>
<p>The afternoon continues to be hectic. It's not until a quarter past six that A'Dai'er wearily puts on her own clothes. The manager walks out and says to her, "A'Dai'er, I want to see you." She buttons up her clothes and runs to the manager's office.</p>
<p>"Listen carefully, child, that buyer from Hawaii is a really good man. He wants to take you out for dinner and a show. Now listen carefully, he is a good man, otherwise I wouldn't let you go."</p>
<p>A'Dai'er knows that the manager wants to make a big deal with this buyer tomorrow. She already has an appointment for tonight and doesn't want to change it, but she understands that business is important.</p>
<p>"Okay, I will definitely go, but Jack, you have to give me a dress to wear here. I can't wear my own tattered clothes, and there isn't enough time to go home and change."</p>
<p>Many girls call the manager by his first name. At this moment, Jack frowns, because there is an unwritten rule that models cannot wear clothes from the store outside. Sometimes girls violate this rule, and if it is discovered, they will be fired. Jack feels that A'Dai'er is deliberately blackmailing him, but he eventually agrees.</p>
<p>"Okay, A'Dai'er, do it that way, but don't let the other girls know."</p>
<p>In clothing wholesale stores, models have a privilege. They can buy any nice clothes at a very low price. They can buy sample clothes in bulk. If the season has passed, when the wholesale period has passed but retail sales are still ongoing, this agreement is mutually beneficial. If a woman works as a model in a clothing store, and her boss often deals with wholesale stores, she can have her choose clothes from the wholesale store.</p>
<p>While the other girls hurry home, A'Dai'er lingers in the store. She begins to dress very carefully. She knows that Jack would not ask her to entertain the buyer if he were unreliable. Many buyers think they have a privilege to socialize with the models at any time. In lower-level wholesale stores, they consider this one of the model's duties, requiring them to entertain out-of-town buyers. In this particular situation, A'Dai'er knows that the buyer from Hawaii might be lonely in New York and wants a companion for entertainment.</p>
<p>She chooses a green dress that the buyer had greatly admired. She wants to show off this dress to him for a night, and maybe he will order it.</p>
<p>The hotel where they are to meet is only four blocks from the store. A'Dai'er hires a car and sits inside comfortably, but only for a short time. She tells the driver to wait for her, and then tells the buyer that she has hired a car outside, because hiring a car is very difficult at this time of night. Even if she knew someone was really rich, A'Dai'er would never call him to spend his money. She knows a young man studying law. When he takes her out, she always suggests going to places that don't cost much money. They go to the movies or take the subway. But when meeting this major buyer, she will never do that.</p>
<p>He has already prepared for the night's entertainment, even booking a dinner. They dine on the rooftop of a large hotel in the theatre district. This place is rarely open in winter. A lavish dinner is displayed on the table, complete with everything from oysters and cheese to biscuits. A'Dai'er tastes a little of everything, while the buyer eats a lot of everything. They are often silent, except when discussing the clothing business. A'Dai'er knows she should be lively and tell some jokes, but there are no fresh incidents.</p>
<p>"Let's go see a new play." As they walk out of the hotel's main entrance into the car, the buyer says eagerly, but when he mentions the name of the play, A'Dai'er's heart sinks. However, she soon recovers her cheerful appearance. In fact, she has seen this great opera at least eight times with different buyers, as if they all love to see this show. Of course, they never ask the models what shows they like. The buyers see them as mere tools, not as human women.</p>
<p>During the conversation, they don't only talk about the wholesale store where A'Dai'er works. The buyer has asked her several questions about styles, and seems to value her opinion very seriously. For A'Dai'er, this evening is truly unbearable. For the buyer, it's just seeing the sights of New York. He will go back and tell his roommates about the beautiful girl he escorted in New York, and the considerable amount of money he spent that night. He will also warn them not to mention it in front of his wife.</p>
<p>A'Dai'er can recite the plot of the play by heart. She is just as familiar with the costumes and music. She gradually feels sleepy. She struggles to fight off sleep, trying not to doze off in her fatigue. During the performance, she even points out how wonderful the play is, to please her companion.</p>
<p>She longs to go home to sleep and rest her aching body. After the play, there is nothing else to do. They go to a popular nightclub for dancing and snacks. A'Dai'er is slightly reluctant, but eventually gives in. At the nightclub, they wear low hats, blow whistles, dance, and eat until three o'clock. Afterwards, everyone is exhausted. She tells the out-of-town buyer how delightful the evening was. She is so tired that she collapses onto her bed and falls asleep immediately. (To be continued)</p>
