<p>叔問</p>
<p>孫清光緒初元。蘇州元和縣太史公顧子山先生（文彬）自浙江寗紹台道卸任歸。官囊充裕。不似陸公紀鬱林返里。僅載一船亂石焉。廉訪公家住城南護龍街鐵瓶巷。巷東頭有荒地十餘畝。顧以廉價得之。自繪園圖。鳩工庀材。栽花種竹。疊石浚池。經之營之七八年。落成。索寓公德清兪蔭甫（樾）題榜曰怡園。園中聯對悉由主人自集宋元詞曲句。蘇城多名園。怡園獨以字書勝塲。又取與衆樂樂之義。任人遊覽。門票售大錢五十文。叔間於壬午癸未申申乙酉之際。每當春秋佳日。常隨父師尊長。時往瀏覽。迄今四十年來。坡仙琴館。不渡艇子。否聽箏室。猶縈繞於夢寐間也。園主人具賈秋壑癖。問竹庵不减半間堂。玉盒金龍。堆積如峰。一交九月。蘇城距離百里間之好秋興者。莫不携青絲綠羽。來與顧子山决勝負。歲歲爲常。何止一日。丁亥八月杪。忽來一嘉興姚姓少年。劇翩雋俊。賭彩甚巨。顧連負十七次。憤火上升。竊謂姚姓之蟲。形不見大。態不見異。何草一撥必呌三聲。蟲一鬥必夾兩斷。其中必有可疑之點。一日重約鬥千金。姚姓欣然允。出彩於桌。兩方觀戰如壁。開籠一撥。而姚姓將軍呌三聲。顧姓將軍若腰斬。子山怒不可遏。遂起手捉住姚蟲·孰知渾身鐵鑄。以</p>
<h3>首都之飛來剪</h3>
<p>鷄冠</p>
<p>首都朝天宮附近之宮後山。其上荒塜纍纍。有古蹟二。一石一剪。皆以飛來爲名。石絕巨。以爲時久遠。着土不易動。惟剪在高處。露厥首端。誌在邑乘。爲人稱道。大抵此物始於明代。距今約有五百餘載之久。深埋之後。迄無人動之者。而故老相傳。則謂金陵王氣所鍾。將繼有眞主出世。劉伯溫特置飛來剪以破之。怪誕之談。殊無足信。前旬市敎育局。以斯剪長埋荒山。未免可惜。欲設法移往公園。加以保存。藉供考覽。鳩工施鋤。計三日餘而剪盡顯。常人以爲剪頭在上丶則士內必餘其柄。乃掘發之後。始明所謂飛來剪者。實一兩頭剪。與普通之形不同。不過剪雖全露。以重量太大。尚未能移。識者謂須賴機械之力云丶</p>

<h3>春明劇訊</h3>
<p>— 徐筱汀</p>
<p>蘭芳鳳卿富英妙香諸人。方輟演於滬上大舞台。小樓連良新艶秋等又將繼露色相。一時春申劇界。稱鼎盛焉。試再一及北平劇事。遽失却如許重心人物。自不免蕭條冷落。况叔岩久不出台。雪艶琴又新攖採薪。此外能自成一班者。只艷秋慧生小雲慶奎又宸琴心而已。此數人若同時移在滬上出演。尚可稱爲盛極一時之羣英會。然在慣於品劇之平人目中視之。則不勝其悽凉之感矣。爰將其最近劇訊。披露於後。以告關心菊事者。</p>
<p>艶秋於一月十四夜出演中和。劇目係刺湯鬧學雙齣。尚有少樓之南陽關。瑞安之殷家堡。十九夜劇目係宇宙鋒黃鶴樓（反串小生）。二十一夜則係青霜劍云。</p>
<p>慧生已與大元分道楊鑣。前此赴津。曾與名票程君謀合作。成績頗佳。回平後程亦串過幾次。惟十七夜慧生在吉祥露佈之劇目繡襦記與十八夜之魚藻宮時。已無君謀名字矣。配角有時慧寶吳彥衡芙蓉草諸人丶</p>
<p>小雲新婚燕爾。喜星高照。十七夜應世界紅卍字會中華總會粥廠之請。在華樂演珍珠扇。十八夜爲外四自治區演公益義務戲於華樂。劇目定春秋配。（乃弟富霞爲陪李春發。）掛在壓軸。大軸則係慧生慶奎壽臣之皖城。尚有琴儂仲衡桂仙之進宮。實近來難得之佳劇也丶慶奎十七夜演義務戲於華樂。與小雲同台。劇目係反宋盜御馬之黃天霸。此外票界耆宿七二老人李君吉甫。亦加入串演雲台觀。</p>
<p>又宸與黃桂秋十五夜在開明貼演襄陽城帶搜臥龍崗。並標明﹁機關佈景與衆不同﹂字樣。想來難脫「諸葛亮招親」窠白也。尚和玉亦加演對刀步戰。此老風頭。誠老而彌健焉。</p>
<p>琴心與常老四（立恒）和玉出演於吉祥。十六夜戲係琴心新排之無雙。由程繼先飾王仙客。尚和玉飾古押衙。立恒則演南陽關云。</p>
<h3>畫苑競秀記</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>最近十年中海上畫展之興盛。莫如今年爲甚。蓋自元旦日謝君公展首舉畫展於寗波同鄉會。接續舉行者。即有六合畫展。中國文藝專門學校畫展。說者謂此乃偃武修文之佳兆。蓋元月爲一歲之首。發端旣有此文化點綴。其終必風雅道長。干戈載戢。其說亦未可非也。從知民心厭亂非一日矣。余旣得飽眼福。不可無記。用掇一二。以資表張。其亦二十年文化發軔之始應有之文字乎。</p>
<p>謝君公展此次畫展佳品。不勝枚舉。吾人欣賞之餘。誠覺游夏無一辭之贊。盛名之下。信不虛也。惟謝君謙抑倍甚丶屬爲平章。無已。余乃作而言曰丶力大氣厚。此日畫苑。惟君當之。</p>
<p>六合畫展。係張葉沈郭高徐六君所組合。所陳之作。皆爲精心結撰。無愧古人。葉君渭莘屬綴一辭。余何人斯。而敢下評丶雖然。寶物當前。情不自禁矣。作而言曰。張如天馬行空。葉如承蜩靈手。沈有僚丸之能。郭有棘猴之工。高如珠走玉盤。徐如秋水成漪。</p>
<p>中國文藝專科學校。此次畫展分校外校內二組。校外如不佞等皆應徵加入。不用贅辭。校中除敎授外丶學生如杜小甫尤其侃周勝庵丁月瑞文秉敦左德全曲宗燮方江水黃景華諸君。均屬後起之秀。其精到處。雖老畫師不能專美於前。可知該校平日指導之認眞。而杜君等學養之有方也。聞近日在京滬路一帶展覽。頗受社會歡迎云。</p>
<p>余作此文後。無以名之。但覺千嚴競秀。不可方物丶即以畫苑競秀名之。當乎。否乎。</p>

<h3>巴黎物語（十）（一）</h3>
<p>六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>這呌作普羅巴的富翁本是勒諾夫的朋友。他在一種困境中突然離去了他們。跑到南美洲後漫漫的發了大財了。普羅巴死時託這位天文學者來尋訪雅萊女士並把他所有的財產遺傳給伊。雅萊忽然遇到這意外的事簡直不知怎辦。伊心想把這樣大的財產遺傳給伊决不是偶然的事。伊家裏掛着有普羅巴的照中。伊自己的面貌和這照中非常相似。再加以許多過去的回憶使得伊不能不疑到伊母親的貞操。也許自己實際是這普羅巴的女克罷。伊一想到這裡伊狠覺難過。因爲伊狠愛伊的父親勒諾。與其受着遺產使他的父親精神感到苦痛。伊寗願犧牲這個從天上掉下來的大財。但那位誠摯的天文學者再三要求。雅萊沒法只得受下。但伊和天文學者約好嚴守秘密。拿着這筆资本。用天文学者的名義將雅萊現在就傭的那個银行買來。再由天文學者请雅莱去管理一切。這一段算是本劇最有精采的地方。許多情節複雜而又有趣。作者在這兒簡直把觀衆玩弄於股掌之上。但結局一切都好了。雅萊成了萬萬財產的所有者。和伊的表兄結婚了。原來那位死在南美的普羅巴先生並不是伊的父親。而是伊的外祖父。（伊的外祖母失德了）現在什麼人都滿意了。愛財的姑母不用說。習於揮霍的勒諾先生也有錢化了。總而言之金錢萬能。皆大歡喜。所最倒霉者只是伊那死了多年的有名無實的外祖父。</p>
<p>這喜劇雖並沒有包含什麼新頴的思想。但作者對於日常生活體騐入微。有許多地方狠使人發笑而乂狠近情理。有許多對話狠古怪而又狠自然。全劇的組織曲折而又緊凑。非老於此道者不辦。但劇本雖好。如果沒有聰明而有經騐的俳優表演也還是徒然。本劇在亞特列Athenee劇院初次上演時。由喜劇名脚Rosemberg飾天文學者丶活現出一個慈祥正直的老學者。使人見着禁不住要笑。但其實他身上又並沒有什麼奇特的地方。Soria夫人飾雅萊女士。質樸俊美。自然有一種青春的流露。其餘飾勒諾。加士登等的脚色。都能各稱其職。盡量表出老倍爾納氏作品的妙味。</p>
<h3>游歐通信（九十五）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（十八）</p>
<p>丨六月四日丨大伽藍聖彼得丨梵諦剛敎皇宮丨西施庭敎堂丨</p>
<p>我們倚欄對噴水池望了一晌。也很昳麗。但身體略感疲乏。就走進廻廊裏面的小廳。到裏面坐下。巍然立在中間的是世界有名的傑作呌做臘懊空Laocoon的彫像。這是一座美妙的羣像。是我素所仰慕的一件珍品。我在巴黎羅佛宮常常去看這像的模造品。其原作就在這裏。我當然是萬分的愉快了。坐着看了一回丶再前前後後摩挲了好久。覺得那豐饒和謹飭的精神究竟比模造品更表現得明顯。</p>
<p>這是耶穌紀元之前一世紀中葉。希臘羅特斯派Rhodes彫刻家亞葉山同Agesandro及其二子柏利特Polydre與亞德拿杜Athenodro的傑作。這個有名的羣像。是表現希臘神話臘懊空Laocoon和他兩個將死的兒子。在阿博洛Apollon所使命下來的蛇的纏繞中掙扎苦痛的狀態。三個身軀被蛇的纏繞聯合爲一。取材之奇特。决非近人所能夢想。緊張而壯碩的軀幹。絞曲了腰圍。厚疊起醫部。皺了雙眉。亂了頭髮。激勵的眼睛裏幾乎要透出火燄。雄渾的姿態。簡直像一座崇嶺。片刻也不容人們放過。　這種﹁人﹂﹁神﹂之戰。表白人間的悲劇的熱情。使人撩亂而窒息這種羅特派的彫刻家之藝術。亦不下於貝迦梅丶Pergame派的藝術。他和後者一樣淵博。一樣剛勁。但更其爲。實現主義者﹂的和更爲﹁唯物主義者﹂的。細細凝視這羣像的面相。那英雄的情操。能夠使臘懊空及其二子在最後的憂思中將面容轉變。眞是刻劃盡致的藝術的傑作。作者所有的堅强的全力量。恐完全宣洩在這石頭上了。</p>
<p>﹁附注﹂貝迦梅Pergame是小亞細亞的一個名城。羅特斯Rhodes是愛琴海羣島之一。自亞歷山大帝之死直到羅馬人怔服希臘的以前。通常稱之爲埃萊尼克Helleniques文化時代。希臘美術上已漸見衰落而起了新的變化。於以前之平靜。優美。偉大諸特質外。更能表現苦悶。熱烈等徵象。其代表作家生於貝迦梅。羅特斯西地而成貝迦蒙羅特斯兩派。貝迦梅派最著名之彫刻如﹁高盧人之自殺﹂﹁角鬬者﹂等。羅特斯派著名之彫刻就是臘懊空。</p>

<h3>National Internal Affairs Conference Plans Overall Bandit Suppression Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Internal Affairs Conference has appointed ten members to draft an overall bandit suppression plan. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Fan Guang convened a meeting at the Central Hotel for the committee members to draft the plan. It is scheduled to be submitted to the general assembly for a decision on the morning of the 23rd. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Leads Military Officers in Paying Respects at the Mausoleum</h3>
<p>Rewards to Various Division, Brigade, and Regiment Commanders</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 8:00 AM on the 22nd, Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting at the Lixingshe (Society for Encouragement of Morale) with over forty division, brigade, and regiment commanders from the forces of Han Fuju, Sun Lianzhong, Ma Hongkui, and others. He gave detailed instructions on the reorganization and training of the troops, as well as the direction for studying Party principles. After the speech, he led all the military officers to pay respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. After the ceremony, they toured the mausoleum for a week. Chiang Kai-shek also recounted the greatness of Sun Yat-sen's life and achievements. It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek awarded the military officers who came to Nanjing with tiered rewards, with 5,000 yuan each for general commanders and division commanders, 500 yuan for brigade commanders, and 300 yuan for regiment commanders. The military officers, having completed their tasks in Nanjing, are expected to return to their defense areas immediately. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin Discusses American Raw Silver Loan</h3>
<p>Lin Bo Ke Negotiating in America</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Hanmin stated that the raw silver loan has been under consideration for some time. The United States has recently had a surplus of raw silver, amounting to 150 million ounces. With the international market in a slump and an excess of industrial products, the number of unemployed workers has increased to over six million. Therefore, they have decided to lend the surplus raw silver to China to increase China's purchasing power and alleviate the crisis in their international market. This loan is initiated by the United States on its own accord, without any conditions or guarantees, based entirely on international credit. China urgently needs to utilize foreign capital to construct railways and dredge waterways for essential projects. In the future, the funds will definitely not be used for consumptive purchases but will be entirely invested in productive enterprises. This proposal originated in the United States and was subsequently discussed with England. However, the "gold faction" in England and America strongly opposes it. Lin Bo Ke is currently making informal proposals in the United States, and the two governments have not yet handled the matter through formal procedures. (Special dispatch, 22nd) (Nanjing) A certain important figure stated that the United States has not yet formally expressed its intention to lend 200 million ounces of raw silver to China. Therefore, although China believes that this move would provide an excellent opportunity for construction, it is not appropriate to make any prior statements. Lin Bo Ke's trip to the United States is for his own private negotiations and he does not carry any mission from the Chinese government. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

The reduction of fees is 4-5 centimes per word, resulting in an annual loss of about one million yuan, which is a loss of rights and benefits.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Reopening of Various National Parliaments</h3>
<p>After the recess of parliaments in various countries, political news had been quiet for many days. Now, with the end of the break, the political battles between parties have begun one after another, and the instability of the political situation in various countries is just like last year. After the reopening of the Polish Parliament, the election campaign issue caused a major disturbance on the first day, leading to the withdrawal of all opposition party members. After the reopening of the German Parliament, the Finance Minister announced the perilous state of German federal finances to the Budget Committee, causing widespread panic. Furthermore, due to the inability of political parties to cooperate, the Brüning cabinet remains highly unstable. After the reopening of the French Parliament, Socialist Pu Yi Sen was re-elected as Speaker. Although no major disputes have been seen, since the passage of the release of communist party members and the withdrawal of communist accusations in the first regular meeting, public opinion regards this as a sign of the increasing influence of extreme left-wing forces, which has some impact on the political situation. After the reopening of the British Parliament, the Conservative Party continues to strongly attack the Labor government. Today, after the Conservative Party passed an education amendment in the House of Commons, Baldwin questioned MacDonald about admitting the cabinet's failure, and Churchill further pressed MacDonald to resign the cabinet. The end of the Labor government is becoming increasingly apparent. In the Japanese Parliament, during the recess period, both the government party and the opposition party were fully prepared for a fierce battle. Today, with the reopening of Parliament, the melee will begin immediately. After Prime Minister-Designate Shidehara's speech on administrative and diplomatic policies, it is yet unknown, as the Japanese newspapers say, whether it will bring "wind and rain." Observing the situation after the reopening of parliaments in various countries, the state of the political situation in various countries this year can be roughly seen. Although parliamentary politics today has become a source of annoyance and is even despised as insignificant, in parliamentary political countries, the life of the government hangs in the hands of the parliamentarians. In the midst of disputes and disturbances, the fate of the political future can be predicted, so how can it be ignored?</p>

<h3>Beginning of Political Battle in Japan</h3>
<p>Parliament Reopens Yesterday After Recess</p>
<p>Shidehara's Speech on Internal Affairs and Diplomacy</p>
<p>Inoue's Speech on Finance</p>
<p>Seiyukai Adopts Three-Stage Tactic</p>
<p>Negotiating Meeting of Various Factions of the House of Representatives Breaks Down</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch of the Electric Communication Society on the 22nd Containing many difficult problems, such as the Acting Prime Minister issue, the Wushe Incident, and the relief law and depression issues, the 59th session of the Diet began its question-and-answer battle today in both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives, there was an emergency question at the beginning to attack the government. On the side of the House of Peers, the anti-government faction of the Research Society and the Koyu Club also took joint actions to pressure the government. Whether it will bring "wind and rain", the political battle in both Houses has begun amidst tension.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Plenary Session of the House of Peers</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch of the Electric Communication Society on the 22nd The House of Peers held its plenary session at 10:00 a.m. today. First, the Chairman of the House was elected, and Matsudaira was elected by a majority. Then, a motion was proposed to have the Speaker express condolences to Prime Minister Hamaguchi, which was passed unanimously. Next, Prime Minister-Designate Shidehara took the stage and gave a speech on administrative policy, followed by a speech on foreign policy as Foreign Minister. After the speech, Inoue of the Kosei Club suddenly requested to speak and took the stage, claiming that Shidehara had said to the US Ambassador last year that "Japan may be destroyed in a war with a major power." This statement insulted the nation and dampened the spirits of the plenipotentiaries sent to the London Conference. We cannot debate national affairs with such a reckless Prime Minister-Designate. His voice and expression were stern. Shidehara took the stage and replied that what Inoue said was based on hearsay and that he had never said such a thing. Inoue still wanted to pursue the matter and requested to speak, but Speaker Tokugawa stopped him. The meeting adjourned at 11:40 a.m.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister-Designate's Speech on Administration</h3>
<p>Electric Communication Society Dispatch Prime Minister-Designate Shidehara's speech on administrative policy in the House of Peers today was as follows: "Due to Prime Minister Hamaguchi's misfortune, according to Article 8 of the Cabinet Organization Act, I, the undersigned, am temporarily acting as Prime Minister and meeting with you, which is a great honor. The most important event that occurred in the past year was naturally the London Treaty. By concluding this treaty, we can promote friendship with strong powers and reduce the burden of national expenses, which can be said to be a win-win situation. The civil unrest in neighboring China has been quelled, and the country is moving towards construction, which is a welcome phenomenon. The relationship with European and American countries is also improving day by day, which is even more gratifying. The budget for the 6th year has been compiled according to the tightening policy in view of the national situation, reducing 320 million yuan compared to the 4th year. Regarding national defense, the financial resources reserved from military reduction will be used to establish a supplementary plan. At the same time, the surplus will be used to implement a tax reduction of 9 million yuan in the 6th year. From the 6th year to the 11th year, there will be an annual tax reduction of 25 million yuan. The current government's policy of not borrowing money remains unchanged, but we believe that relieving unemployment is an urgent national task, so we will issue unemployment bonds this year. Since the lifting of the gold embargo last January, the Japanese financial world has encountered unprecedented difficulties due to the global situation. Fortunately, those in the industry continue to improve and reorganize the business world with unwavering perseverance. The government has also decisively reorganized administrative finances and revised the pension law to seek to conserve expenses. Under the current circumstances, we cannot simply allow expenses to expand. We must conserve them to cultivate the strength of the people and prepare for future use."</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Shidehara's Speech on Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Electric Communication Society Dispatch Prime Minister-Designate Shidehara delivered a speech in the House of Peers regarding foreign policy, the gist of which is as follows: "The most important thing in the world of foreign affairs in the past year was the conclusion of the London Naval Treaty. We believe that the conclusion of this treaty can put an end to the competition for auxiliary ships among countries, increase mutual trust among countries, and have a positive impact on the naval conference to be held in Showa 10 (1935). Secondly, regarding the China issue, although there are still many difficulties in China's future, in addition to coping with patience and courage by Chinese politicians, the friendship of the powers is also necessary. The recent words and actions of the leaders of the Chinese National Government focus on the construction of domestic politics. If they can work hard on the construction of domestic politics, provide appropriate protection for the lives and property of domestic and foreign people and legitimate economic activities, and fulfill China's obligations, then the unequal treaties will naturally lose their raison d'être. Regarding the construction of railways in Manchuria, Japan does not ignore China's legitimate claims and its position, and at the same time, it does not believe that China has a plan to endanger the position of the South Manchuria Railway. Trade with Russia has improved since then, increasing three times compared to when diplomatic relations were restored. The fishery issue between Japan and Russia is still an outstanding issue in the negotiations, but we believe that the Soviet government attaches importance to good relations between the two countries and has the intention to resolve it. The relationship with European and American countries is also in a satisfactory state. Regarding the US immigration law issue, recently, the American people have understood Japan's position. The facts are all there, and there is no doubt. We should pay close attention to the development of the issue."</p>
<h3>Yoshiza Inoue's Speech on Finance</h3>
<p>Electric Communication Society Dispatch on the 22nd of Tokyo In the official meeting of the House of Representatives today, following Shidehara, Finance Minister Inoue gave a speech on finance, explaining the decrease in revenue, the rationalization of administration, and the distribution of military reduction surplus to tax cuts, then declared that the Japanese economy has passed the extremely uneasy era and is gradually moving towards a normal state. Currently, there are no external adverse effects. Although it cannot be predicted that it will recover rapidly, it is moving towards recovery at a healthy pace. After the lifting of the gold embargo, the outflow of gold reached 308 million yuan. The Bank of Japan's cash reserves decreased to 240 million yuan as of December, but this outflow of funds can be regarded as this year's inflow of funds, so this level of cash reserve decrease does not need to be worried. The amount of overseas trade for the whole country reached more than 1.5 billion yuan, and the excess of imports was more than 160 million yuan. With this state of trade in the world's recession and the first year after the lifting of the embargo, there is no need to be pessimistic. Electric Communication Society Dispatch on the 22nd of Tokyo. The Seiyukai held a meeting of top executives at 7 p.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures for the Diet, which lasted until late at night. Regarding the Acting Prime Minister issue, it was decided to use a three-stage tactic. The first stage: At the beginning of the Diet's reopening today, a resolution on constitutional operation would be proposed and the negotiation meeting with various factions would be requested to schedule it. The second stage: If the above-mentioned method fails, the schedule would be changed and an emergency scheduling of this resolution would be proposed. The third stage: If the second method also fails, the next bill would be scheduled after the speech on administrative policy by Acting Prime Minister Shidehara. The Seiyukai's fighting spirit is very strong. It is difficult to predict what kind of situation will unfold in the Diet today.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Society Dispatch on the 22nd of Tokyo The negotiating meeting of the various factions of the Lower House was held at noon today in the negotiating rooms of the various factions. The Seiyukai side proposed to urgently schedule the most important resolution on constitutional operation in parliamentary politics before the speech on administrative policy by the Acting Prime Minister. Because the Minseito side strongly refused, the negotiating meeting broke down.</p>
<h3>British Labour Government Fails in House of Commons</h3>
<p>Amendment to Education Bill Passed</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 21st The British Labour Government failed in the House of Commons tonight. The Conservative Party's amendment to the Education Bill was passed by 282 votes to 249 votes. Whereupon, Baldwin rose to ask whether the Cabinet would acknowledge the result of the failure. Prime Minister MacDonald did not answer. Churchill was angry and requested the Cabinet's resignation, saying that if it did not resign, it would lose the respect of the people. Reuters, London, 21st While the House of Commons was discussing the Education Bill to raise the school leaving age from 14 to 15, Labour MP Scott proposed an amendment arguing that the bill should not be implemented in schools without facilities unless they received state funding. Tonight, the House of Commons passed this amendment by 282 votes to 249, causing the government to fail. Shortly after, Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the government did not consider the failure of this bill to be a very important event, as it did not involve principles. The government has accepted this amendment, and the bill passed its third reading by 256 votes to 238.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council Discusses Minority Issues</h3>
<p>Polish German Minority Abused</p>
<p>Representatives of Both Sides Engaged in Eloquence</p>
<p>Consideration Committee of the European Union Passed Six Resolutions</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 21st This afternoon, the League of Nations Council opened a meeting on minority issues, with a packed audience. After the Japanese representative reported on the case, German Foreign Minister Curtius bitterly recounted how the German minority in Upper Silesia had been abused by Poland during the election, saying that the minority issue was not just a dispute between two countries, but a purely League of Nations matter. No matter which country brings it up, the League should bear the responsibility of ensuring that the minority's due rights can be fully exercised without obstruction. The Polish nation has used every means to suppress the German nation's spirit and injure its body. The Polish government has also indirectly admitted that there were 99 criminal prosecutions and 17 disciplinary actions afterwards. When the Poles committed open acts of violence, the authorities never intervened, and even lower-level officials participated. Although these acts of violence were committed by members of the Anti-Association, the Association is semi-official in nature, and it is credible that the members' actions have the tacit consent of the Polish government, and the Polish authorities should bear part of the responsibility. Then, Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski rose to strongly defend the Poles, saying that it was all an excessive action driven by temporary patriotic fervor, and compared it to the actions of the German Steel Helmet League. Curtius rose again to refute, pointing out that the comparison of the Steel Helmet League was irrelevant to the issue, and that the Polish Foreign Minister's involvement of German President Hindenburg's name as honorary president of the Steel Helmet League in the debate was out of line. He also requested that the League of Nations promptly conduct an investigation to make the Polish government compensate the German minority for the damage suffered and give new guarantees. However, Zaleski also strictly rejected this. Both sides argued eloquently and were evenly matched. However, Curtius consistently took the offensive, while Zaleski could only defend, and occasionally admitted to some points. Therefore, neutral observers mostly believed that the German side had more reason and strength and could seize victory.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 22nd The European Federal Consideration Committee held a meeting today, which will be reopened in May. Five resolutions on economic issues were unanimously passed and will be submitted to the League of Nations Council. The content mainly focuses on relieving the panic in the European agricultural sector. In addition, two small committees were organized, one to discuss tariffs and preferential tax rates, and one to discuss agricultural lending, both of which will meet within the next month. Finally, a resolution was also passed, recognizing that the situation is very difficult and that countries are determined to work together through the League of Nations to plan for self-rescue. Then, the British and French Foreign Ministers rose to thank the Chairman for his hard work, and Chairman Briand also gave a brief speech, expressing his firm belief that after this exchange of views, European countries will be able to cooperate.</p>

It is proposed that the Ministry of Interior inform all provinces, cities, and counties to investigate and handle them accordingly. Cases 71, 78, 95, and 107 all concern fundamental methods for relieving vagrants. It is proposed that the Ministry of Interior compile the plans listed in each case and issue them to all localities to actively implement them. As for Case 108, which is specifically related to infant care, it is proposed that the Ministry of Interior directly order all localities to pay attention to improving it. The resolutions were passed. (12) Case 56: Establishing documentation committees in all cities and counties. (Review Opinions) This case is feasible. It is proposed to amend item two to read: "The documentation committee is organized by the city and county government, with the directors of the education bureau, district heads of each district, principals of each school, and directors of each library serving as ex officio members. Local scholars and Confucian scholars and those familiar with local anecdotes may also be invited to serve as members."

(4) Case 60: Proposing to modify the organization method of county defense corps to facilitate progress. (Review Opinions) Both cases are referred to the Ministry of Interior for reference.

(13) Case 86: Implementing inter-provincial joint defense to eliminate the source of bandits. (Review Opinions) The above seven cases are all related to bandit suppression and communist eradication plans. Some are related to party affairs, and some are related to military affairs. It is requested that the Ministry of Interior forward them to the Central Party Headquarters, the Commander-in-Chief's Office, and the Ministry of Military Affairs for reference. Members spoke actively, all agreeing that this case is of great importance and requires special attention. On one hand, the committee should formulate an overall plan to contribute to the government and military authorities as much as possible for their consideration. On the other hand, the committee should send a telegram to the military leaders of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces to eliminate the communist bandits in the shortest possible time to relieve the suffering of the people and avoid major obstacles to the implementation of internal affairs. The members from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces also reported on the tragic situation of the communist disaster in their respective provinces, stating that the inhumanity of the communist bandits is absolutely doomed to failure. However, like the rebellions of Li Chuang and Zhang Xianzhong at the end of the Ming Dynasty, although the roving bandits ultimately perished, the Ming Dynasty also fell as a result. Therefore, it is believed that the problem of communist eradication is related to the survival of the nation, and they elaborated on their ideas for addressing both the root cause and the symptoms. The case was discussed for two hours. Finally, it was decided to form another committee based on the review report and the methods for addressing both the root cause and the symptoms discussed at the meeting. Wu Xingya, Cao Bowen, Fan Guang, Zhang Naiyan, Li Huaying, Li Bailing, Wang Shengzu, Yuan Liang, Niu Zaikun, and Liu Jingdu were appointed as the ten members of the committee to formulate detailed measures to be submitted for discussion at tomorrow's meeting. Fan Guang was appointed as the convener. As the time had passed noon, the meeting was adjourned. Other proposals will be discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>The Fourth National Internal Affairs Conference</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>(16) Case 29: Proposal to stipulate long-term police savings measures. (Review Opinions) Approved in principle, and handed over to the Ministry of Interior to draft appropriate measures for implementation. The resolution was passed. (17) Case 30: Proposal to issue an order for long-term police seniority pay increases and to formulate long-term police assessment regulations. (Review Opinions) Merged with Case 3, and the original case was handed over to the Ministry of Interior for reference. The resolution was passed. (18) Case 38: Request to increase the salaries of patrol officers at all levels to focus on lower-level cadres. (19) Case 45: Request to improve the treatment of police personnel and formulate protection laws. (20) Case 47: Request to stipulate annual seniority pay increases and retirement benefits for police officers. (21) Case 50: Request to amend the Official Pension Regulations regarding the length of service for retirement pensions for long-term police. (22) Case 53: Request to amend the Police Officer Rank Regulations and Salary Regulations. (23) Case 55: Request to formulate a Police Officer Protection Law. (24) Case 62: Request to improve police treatment. (25) Case 76: Request to increase the treatment of police officers. (Review Opinions) Cases 19 were of the same nature and were discussed together. It was believed that it was necessary to improve the treatment of police officers. Police officer salaries should be equal to those of civil servants. Police officer protection should be the same as that of ordinary civil servants. Patrol officers should receive the same treatment as ordinary commissioned officers. The age limit for retirement for long-term police officers was passed in accordance with the principles of Case 50, changing 60 years old to 50 years old. All were handed over to the Ministry of Interior for handling. The resolution was passed. (C) Land Group, (1) Case 1: Request to promptly issue regulations for the organization of land administration agencies and detailed rules for the implementation of land laws. (2) Case 5: Each province should establish a land administration agency specifically responsible for land administration to unify land administration. (Review Opinions) The main points of the original proposal request the central government to promptly formulate and issue regulations for the organization of land administration agencies and detailed rules for the implementation of land laws in order to unify land administration, which is a prerequisite for land reorganization. It is proposed that the original proposal be sent to the competent authorities for handling. The resolution was passed. (3) Case 2: The construction of automobile routes should be connected to or branch off from railway lines to promote mutual assistance. (Review Opinions) The original proposal advocates that each province should avoid building automobile highways parallel to railway lines, which is very adequate. It is proposed that it be sent to the competent authorities for submission to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the provincial governments for compliance. The resolution was passed. (4) Case 3: Using civilian labor to promote national road construction. (Review Opinions) Investigating and repairing roads and acquiring land is more important than conscripting civilian labor. The original proposal only requests the stipulation of methods for conscripting civilian labor, which seems insufficient to promote the progress of road administration. It is proposed that it be sent to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Railways to formulate a general outline of methods for requisitioning land and conscripting labor, and to submit it to the government for approval and circulation. In addition, the provincial governments should formulate detailed implementation rules based on local conditions for handling. The resolution was passed. (5) Case 4: Quickly establishing surveying schools in each province to cultivate specialized talents in order to complete land surveying as soon as possible. (6) Case 6: Each province should establish specialized schools to train land surveying talents. (Review Opinions) Investigating that China is very lacking in surveying talents, opening surveying schools to cultivate specialized talents is a matter of utmost urgency. It is proposed that the original case be sent to the competent authorities to handle it jointly with the General Staff Headquarters. The resolution was passed. (7) Case 7: Each province should conduct pilot land surveys in the leading counties of each province. (Review Opinions) Conducting land surveys on a trial basis in the leading counties of each province is also a type of implementation method. It is proposed that it be sent to the competent authorities for reference. The resolution was passed. (8) Case 8: Organizing national geodetic surveys. (9) Case 9: Small triangulation surveys and topographic mapping in each province should be completed rapidly by the Land Survey Bureau. (Review Opinions) China has never determined the national accurate map and national defense boundaries. Organizing geodetic surveys is a matter of utmost urgency. It is proposed that it be sent to the competent authorities to plan and handle it jointly with the General Staff Headquarters. The resolution was passed. (10) Case 10: Requesting the Ministry of Interior to formulate land reorganization regulations, investigation rules, surveying rules, and various registers, books, and maps. (Review Opinions) The various implementation rules and statistical charts required for land reorganization should be formulated as soon as possible to facilitate progress. It is proposed that it be sent to the competent authorities for rapid handling. The resolution was passed. (11) Case 11: Establishing a factory to manufacture surveying instruments. (12) Case 18: Fundraising to establish a surveying instrument manufacturing plant. (Review Opinions) Investigating that surveying instruments are all purchased from foreign countries, and that surveying land requires a large number of instruments, establishing a factory to manufacture them ourselves is a necessary measure. It is proposed that it be sent to the competent authorities to handle it jointly with the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Education, and the General Staff Headquarters. The resolution was passed.</p>

<p>Important News 2</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Returns to Shenyang by Plane</h3>
<p>Accompanied by Zhu Guangmu and others.</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence - Zhang Xueliang has been staying in Tianjin for almost two months. Although special envoys have been dispatched repeatedly to ask for instructions and telegrams have been sent urging him to return to his command, Zhang has ultimately extended his return due to presiding over the Shanxi-Suiyuan problem. Now that the various Shanxi-Suiyuan problems have been fully negotiated and decided, he returned to Shenyang from Tianjin by Ford aircraft on the 18th. Driven by Feng Yong's driver, it took off from Tianjin at 10:00 AM and landed at the Dongta Airport at 1:40 PM. Those who traveled with Zhang on the plane were Zhu Guangmu, Director of the General Affairs Office of the Commander's Office; Su Quanbin, Director of the Military Supplies Office; Huang Xiansheng, Director of the Adjutant's Office; Tan Hai, Chief of the Adjutant Guard; Liu Duoquan, Commander of the Guard; and several guards. After Zhang disembarked from the plane, he returned to his private residence to rest, and the accompanying personnel returned to their private residences. The news of Zhang's return to Shenyang by plane was kept extremely secret beforehand. Although the Tianjin side had informed them by telephone at 12:00 PM on the 18th that a plane was returning to Shenyang, it was not mentioned that it was Zhang, so the important figures of various agencies did not go to the airport to greet him. Military police along the Tianjin-Liaoning line and at various stations have been secretly deployed since the 18th, and strict precautions have been taken in preparation for Zhang's return to Shenyang. Since Zhang changed to flying to Shenyang, this security has not been withdrawn, as the special train of the Beining Railway prepared for Zhang is still carrying Secretary-General Wang Shuhan and others. The special train departed from Tianjin in the afternoon and is expected to arrive at around 10:00 AM on the 19th. After Zhang arrived in Shenyang, various parties rushed to Zhang's residence to pay their respects. The first were Zhang Zuoxiang, Chairman of Jilin Province; Rong Zhen, Director of the Military Affairs Department of the Frontier Affairs Office; Zang Shiyi, Chairman of Liaoning Province; and Yuan Jinkai and Liu Zhe, members of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee. It is heard that Mo Dehui, the Plenipotentiary Representative of China and the Soviet Union, is also scheduled to arrive in Shenyang from Harbin on the evening of the 18th to report on the progress of the Sino-Soviet talks. Furthermore, all sectors of Shenyang, including agriculture, commerce, the military, and education, are preparing a grand welcome meeting, which is planned to be held immediately after Zhang Xueliang returns to Shenyang. Considering that Zhang is tired from his travels, it is planned to wait until he has rested for a day or two before holding the welcome meeting. (18th)</p>
<h3>Carelessness on Beining Railway Baggage Car</h3>

<p>Shenyang Correspondence - The Shenyang Office of the Beining Railway received a report on the 18th afternoon from the station master of Dongxinzhuang Station and the conductor of the 106th Express Train that the 106th Third-Class Special Express Train from Shenyang to Beiping, which departed from Shenyang at 2:30 PM on the 17th, on the Beining Railway, at approximately 1:00 AM on the 18th, when traveling west of Xingcheng County, about to arrive at Dongxinzhuang Station, east of Suizhong County, the thirty-ton iron-roofed baggage car behind the guard car and passenger car suddenly and carelessly caught fire, and the flames were so fierce that they could not be extinguished. The train conductor, hearing the alarm, fearing that the fire would spread to the vehicles in front and behind, unhooked the car and left it at Dongxinzhuang Station. The passenger cars continued westward. The baggage car burned until dawn at around 4:00 AM, when the fire was finally extinguished. A total of 183 pieces of passenger luggage were loaded. Except for 14 pieces that were salvaged, the remaining 169 pieces were burned. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. (19th)</p>
<h3>Arrest of Communist Leader in Northeast China</h3>
<p>The History of Han Shouben and His Wife</p>
<p>Detected by Police in the Harbin Special District</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: For the past year, the activities of the Communist Party in Northeast China have centered around Harbin as their base of operations. Their propaganda plan is like a net, extending throughout the city and along the three railway lines of the Eastern Railway: Harbin-Changchun, Harbin-Manchuria, and Harbin-Suifenhe. It penetrates into various areas of workers and peasants, waiting for the movement to mature before launching sudden riots. Therefore, Communist Party cases in various areas have emerged one after another. Although the Harbin police authorities knew that there were Communist Party nests in the city, they were slow to handle the procedures. Although they repeatedly discovered the party's declarations, they had not yet heard of the capture of the ringleaders. Unexpectedly, recently, due to several suspected criminals, they discovered and arrested Han Shouben, the leader of the Communist Party in Northeast China. The details are recorded as follows: At the beginning of this month, postal inspectors at the Special Police Department intercepted a large number of Communist Party mails from Vladivostok, Yanji, Jiangxi, Hebei, and other places. The covers were all addressed to P.O. Box 120, Nangang Post Office, Harbin. Upon opening and reading the contents, the books were mostly red propaganda materials, and the letters were vaguely worded and incomprehensible. Therefore, they paid attention for a week and learned that the establishment of this mailbox must have some background. They reported it directly to Jia Wenqi, the acting director. Jia approved Sun Shifu, the director of the Third Department, to investigate secretly. Sun ordered plainclothes inspectors from the department to wait at the Nangang Post Office. At 2:00 p.m. on the 13th of this month, a young woman, dressed in Western-style clothing, resembling a female student, went to the post office, opened this P.O. Box 120, and took out several letters and newspapers, stuffing them into her coat pocket. As she turned to leave, the waiting inspector stepped forward to stop her and questioned her. She claimed to be Guan Shaoying, 22 years old, from Yitong County, Jilin, a student at the Sino-Russian Industrial University, who had recently dropped out of school. Because she had no fixed address, she rented a mailbox for the convenience of receiving mail. The lease had been in effect for less than half a month. When the post office was questioned about this, they said that the mailbox renter's name was Shao Wenjun, with an unknown address, and was not rented by Guan Shaoying. The inspector suspected her and arrested the woman, taking her back to the department. After the director interrogated her, she also said that the mailbox was indeed rented by Shao Wenjun. She said that after dropping out of school, she lived in a certain inn, the name of which she had forgotten. Due to financial difficulties, she had no choice but to become a prostitute. On the 9th of this month, she met Shao at a movie park outside the city. They fell in love at first sight and immediately became engaged. Shao said that he was a secretary in a certain headquarters and was too busy today, so he asked her to collect the mail on his behalf. When asked about everything else, her answers were vague. Therefore, the director summoned household registration police to identify whether the woman lived in this jurisdiction. A household registration police officer recognized that the woman was indeed named Guan Shaoying and had a husband named Han Shaowen, who lived at No. 22, Tiegong Street, Nangang. The director then sent personnel to inspect this address. In the handbag used by Guan, they found many propaganda books and vaguely worded letters. The most convincing proof that Shao Wenjun was Guan Shaoying was the receipt for renting the post office mailbox. At that time, the landlord was asked and said that Guan and her husband, Han Shaowen, had rented the room for several months. Han usually did not leave the house, and Guan Shaoying handled everything. Han claimed to be a worker, but he went to Jilin once every ten days. He did not know anything else. Later, the director questioned Guan based on the evidence found. Although her attitude changed, she still stubbornly insisted that she was a prostitute and denied everything else. The most ridiculous thing was that when the director asked about her husband's occupation, she replied that he had no occupation. When asked how they lived without an occupation, she replied, "When we women meet men outside, and they see us a few times, who doesn't give us money to spend?" When asked why her husband went out every few days, she replied, "He leaves me work to do, so I can rely on people!" Because the director could not get any useful information, he sent the woman to the Special Police Department on the morning of the 15th. On the one hand, he secretly tracked down Han Shaowen. On the morning of the 16th, Han returned from the provincial capital and went out again to buy rice and flour. He returned to his residence at 1:00 p.m. At that time, the landlord of the house had secretly reported to the police station of the Third Department of the Special Police on Zhuan Street. Inspector Zhao Desheng immediately led police to arrest him. When they entered the room, Han was wearing a blue cloth robe and black woolen boots, looking very much like a worker. He was holding a letter and reading it. When he saw the police enter, he quickly tore up the letter. Inspector Zhao snatched it, but only half a page remained. Reading the words, they were still incomprehensible. At that time, Han saw that things had been exposed and quickly took out 250 yuan, asking Inspector Zhao not to report the note. Zhao pretended to agree and immediately sent the suspect, evidence, and money to the department together. After arriving at the department, the director did not interrogate him and personally escorted him to the management office. After identification by Director Wu Kuichang, it was learned that Han Shaowen was the fugitive Communist leader Han Shouben using an alias. However, during the interrogation, Han still did not admit that he was Han Shouben. Later, Feng Fanyi, an official from the detention center who had been detained because of Han's escape, was brought out to identify him. Only then did Han have nothing to say. That night, the police department detained Han and telegraphed a report to Liaoning, saying that he must be escorted to Liaoning within days. Han is now 28 years old, from Changchun, Jilin. He graduated from Jilin Provincial Normal School and served as an editor for the Changchun Dadong Newspaper and a middle school teacher. Before the purge of the Communist Party, he was a special commissioner of party affairs in Jilin. After the purge, Han was raised by the Third International and was the only key leader of the Communist Party in Northeast China. All the party's propaganda and riots in Northeast China, as well as the labor unrest in Harbin in the past and the recent May 5th turmoil in Jilin, were all directed by him and his accomplices. Last fall, he was captured by the special police, and several supervisors and translators were sent to escort him to Liaoning. On the way, he escaped under the pretext of going to the toilet. The police officers who escorted him were reprimanded for this. Unexpectedly, he has now been discovered, which was also unexpected. The authorities have now sent personnel to strictly arrest his accomplices. (16th)</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Discussing 76 Proposals</p>
<p>Both Chinese and Russian Sides Have Important Proposals</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The joint conference of directors and supervisors of the Eastern Railway has not been formally convened since Mo Dehui left the country on May 1st last year. On the 12th of this month, it was specially convened to discuss the cases of the interim board of directors and the Railway Bureau's implementation of bureau orders in the first half of last year. The Russian side was represented by Deputy Director Ye Musahanav, Director Danilevsky, Kuznichev, Simanovsky, and Supervisor Biel Shen. The Chinese side was represented by Director Mo Dehui, Directors Li Shaogeng, Fan Qiguang, Shen Ruilin, Supervisor Guo Fuming, Supervisor Zhang Shu, etc. The Russian Director of the Railway Bureau, Rudyev, also attended the meeting with the heads of various departments. A total of 76 proposals were discussed, of which about 62 were about seeking approval, and most of them had been implemented for many days. It was a formal commitment, so they were passed quickly. Mo Dehui put forward three proposals on this day: (1) To revitalize the railway's forests and mines to prevent leakage; (2) To organize a committee to reduce freight rates; (3) To reduce the operating expenses of the Supervisory Office by 10%. The proposals of the Russian Director of the Railway Bureau were: (1) To establish a translation office to facilitate official business; (2) To reorganize the various departments and sections under the Railway Bureau. These were more important and were the focus of joint efforts by both sides. According to the reasons put forward by Mo for revitalizing the railway's forests and mines, it was based on the investigation by Ding Tao, the director of the Zhalanor Mine. The coal seams of the Zhalanor Mine are very high and can be restored. The Mianpo and Hengdaogou forest farms on the Hasui Line are where railway wood is produced and should resume work. During the discussion, the Russian side argued that the Eastern Railway was currently in a state of financial deficit and could not afford to spend huge sums of money to restore the Zhalanor Mine. As for purchasing foreign coal, it did not require huge sums of money and should be temporarily maintained. The Mianpo and Hengdaogou forest farms do not produce sleeper materials and there is no need to restore them. As a result, the original proposal was retained and will be discussed in the regular meeting of the board of directors. The reason for the original proposal put forward by Mo to organize a committee to reduce freight rates was that the Eastern Railway's freight volume had decreased due to the fact that soybeans from northern Manchuria were not exported. The reason why soybeans were not exported was that the Eastern Railway's freight rates were too high. According to the resolution of the interim board of directors on December 25th, freight rates were reduced by 20% and passenger fares by 40% from January. Now, efforts should be made to reduce them to encourage the export of special products. The freight rate should be reduced to 40%. As a result of the discussion, one Chinese and one Russian director organized a committee to work with the heads of various departments of the board of directors to study new transport rules, which will be promulgated and implemented on February 1st. Mo's proposal to reduce the operating expenses of the Supervisory Office by 10% did not involve Russian rights. If the proposal was passed, the Russian Director's proposal to reorganize the various departments and sections under the Railway Bureau, such as abolishing the Locomotive Department, merging it with the Traffic Department, and abolishing the Land Department and the Chinese and Russian Secretariat, would all be related to the railway's austerity policy. Both sides agreed. If the proposal was passed, the Russian Director's proposal to establish a translation office was originally proposed by the Chinese side. It was originally scheduled to be established on November 1st last year. Later, because the Russian side argued that the translations of all departments of the Railway Bureau should be served by the translation office, which was contrary to the Chinese side's opinion, the establishment was delayed. Now that the Russian Director has urged it, it has been decided that the original preparatory committee will re-draft the articles of organization and submit them to the board of directors for approval, and then order the Railway Bureau to implement them. However, it can be formed by mid-next month at the latest. The meeting on the 12th was not completed, and the meeting continued on the 13th. The unresolved items will be discussed in the regular meeting of the board of directors. (14th)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Clearing and Purification General Bureau</h3>

<p>The Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office, in order to thoroughly eliminate bandits, has sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting that clearing and purification be implemented simultaneously in each county after pacification.

The Second Section of the Secretariat of the Provincial Government is currently drafting the regulations of the General Bureau. Once the draft is completed and passed by the Provincial Government Committee, it can be established. It is heard that the Director of the Clearing and Purification General Bureau will be concurrently held by the Chairman of the Provincial Government, and the Deputy Director will be concurrently held by the Director of the Civil Affairs Department. The personnel within the bureau will also be transferred from the Provincial Civil Affairs Department and will not receive concurrent salaries in order to save public funds.</p>

<p>Shuikou Town, located three miles south of the Hushaio Bridge in the eastern countryside of Pinghu, is a small coastal market town. Song Maosheng, who is quite wealthy and operates a jellyfish business in the town, has been coveted by bandits. However, due to the presence of a water police patrol team stationed at the Hushaio Bridge, they did not dare to act rashly. Recently, the Quan Gong bandits have retreated eastward, so the vigilance has been slightly relaxed. However, the bandits' intelligence is very keen. On the evening of the 20th, at about 7:00 PM, more than eighty bandits, forty of whom were armed with guns, traveled west along the seawall and went straight to Song Maosheng's house to kidnap people. They mistakenly entered Song A'si's house and kidnapped A'si's entire family of six. Maosheng heard the alarm and knocked down the wall to escape. By the time the bandits found out, they returned to Maosheng's house, but only an empty house remained. So they took the six members of A'si's family away.</p>

<p>Information on Abducted Village Girl Sent to Family</p>
<p>The daughter of Miao Shousheng, a farmer from the 8th District, whose nickname is Eryuan, was abducted and sold to Jilin several years ago. Recently, due to her unwillingness to be a prostitute, the local Ji Liang Institute sent a letter to her family, asking them to come and identify her. Her father consulted with Hou Baizhou, the executive committee member of the district, who accompanied him to Shanghai last month and entrusted the Shanghai Women and Children Relief Association to investigate her whereabouts. A photo has been sent, confirming that she is indeed Miao's daughter. However, according to the association's procedures, the family must first pay the travel expenses before they can handle the matter.

The investigation began yesterday, with the interrogation of the original river project cashier to thoroughly investigate the matter. The district affairs of the two directors, Jiang and Zhang, will be temporarily handled by assistant staff appointed by the county.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Plans to Establish Simplified Primary School Curriculum Standards</h3>
<p>In order to urgently promote preliminary compulsory education, the Jiangsu Education Department previously drafted the "Provisional Measures for Implementing Preliminary Compulsory Education in Jiangsu Province" and ordered all counties to establish simplified primary schools in areas where normal schools are located or where the population is dense, in addition to ordinary primary schools. These schools will enroll children around the age of ten who cannot enter formal primary schools, and will provide two hours of instruction per day per grade, for a total of 500 hours per year. After completing three years, for a total of 3,000 hours, compulsory education will be considered completed. As this is a new undertaking, and lacking expertise, Li Xiaonong and Xin Zenghui have been hired to draft a plan. The plan contains special arrangements for Party Principles, National Language, Arithmetic, General Knowledge, and Physical Education. It is currently being revised and will first be implemented in the provincial capital. Soon, it will be submitted to the Ministry for record and distributed to various counties for implementation.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Temporarily Suspends Continuing Tuition for Students Studying in Europe and America</h3>
<p>At the 370th meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee, Zhang Daofan, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, proposed that the remaining funds from the European and American study abroad expenses will soon be exhausted. Until expansion methods are devised for education funding, the proposal to temporarily suspend the allocation of continued funding or subsidies to students requesting financial aid was discussed. It was noted that the Department's previous assistance to students studying in Europe and America by providing subsidies or financial aid was purely based on the limited remaining funds from the study abroad expenses. However, due to the lack of clear regulations for those requesting assistance based on precedent, there were no standards to follow, making it difficult to respond. Recently, due to financial constraints, all previous remaining funds have been almost entirely diverted. Furthermore, at a time when gold prices are soaring, the original budget based on the calculated gold price is already insufficient. It is foreseeable that there will be no remaining funds in the future. It is proposed that the meeting decide that until expansion methods are devised for education funding, in addition to students who have already been approved for subsidies and students who are separately assigned to study in Japan with subsidies, the allocation of continued funding or subsidies to students requesting financial assistance should be temporarily suspended. This is respectfully submitted for decision.</p>
<h3>After Registration, Law Schools Should Submit to the Judicial Yuan for Special Permission</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the education bureaus of Shanghai and Beiping that after registration, law and political science schools should submit to the Judicial Yuan for special permission. It is noted that the private China Public School, the private Shanghai Law and Political Science College, the private Shanghai Law College, the private China College, and the private Chaoyang College were all approved for registration by the Ministry after the National Government promulgated and revised the Regulations for the Establishment of Private Law and Political Science Schools with Special Permission from the Judicial Yuan in April of last year. (The private Yanjing University recently changed the name of its Applied Social Sciences Institute to the Law School and added a law department, which was also approved by order.) These schools should comply with the regulations and submit a request to the Judicial Yuan for special permission. When submitting the request for special permission, in accordance with Article 2 of the regulations, the school's board of directors should submit the Ministry's approved registration certificate, the proposed curriculum for the law or political science department, the resume of the faculty, and the equipment plan to the Ministry for forwarding to the Judicial Yuan for review. The Bureau is hereby ordered to instruct the schools to comply.</p>
<h3>The Ever-Increasing and Strained Education Funding in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The salary collection strike by the education sector in Jiangdu has lasted nearly ten days. The funds for nine months have still not been fully distributed. Initially, County Magistrate Chen ordered the tax clerks to collect and pay 30,000 yuan of old debts within the next twenty days, and to remit all new collections. According to the overall plan, including other collections, the funds for three months can be barely scraped together by the end of the lunar year. However, the tax clerks only agreed to 24,000 yuan for the old debts, and claimed that the new collections were actually old debts, making it impossible to collect any new funds. The county magistrate was extremely angry and reportedly detained the chief clerk, Zhu, and sent him to the county seat for questioning on the evening of the 19th. The Bureau Director believes that it is always difficult to thoroughly resolve the issue, so he went to the provincial government this morning (the 20th) to personally resign. Before leaving, he sent a letter to the county government, stating: "The Bureau Director believes that there is no solution to the education funding issue, and only by resigning can he apologize to all education colleagues in the county. In addition to a separate official request, I am hereby submitting this letter due to my trip to the provincial government to personally resign." Upon hearing the news, the faculty and staff held a temporary emergency meeting attended by about 200 people. The resolutions passed are listed below: (1) The association will send someone to the county government to demand the remaining 5,000 yuan of the first deadline for outstanding payments (resolution passed); (2) Representatives will be sent to the Education Department to request the Bureau Director to return to Yangzhou and to request the Education Department to send someone to Yangzhou to resolve the salary collection issue (resolution passed); (3) The association will invite Fang Mianzhi, a member of the land tax commission, to the Bureau to report on the new collection accounts for the 19th year, and accompany the colleagues of the association to the county to verify the new collection accounts for the 19th year (resolution passed).</p>
<h3>Measures Taken by Director Cheng of the Fujian Education Department After His Reinstatement</h3>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence, after Director Cheng Shiwei of the Fujian Education Department returned to Fujian and was reinstated, he actively reorganized the department and issued a reinstatement declaration. The following is a summary of the department's ongoing matters:</p>
<p>(1) Planning Provincial Education Funding: Director Cheng believes that education funding is the lifeline of education, and upon his reinstatement, he immediately focused on this matter. He discussed with Director Chen Peikun several times, and held a temporary meeting at the Salt Transport Office on January 7, attended by Director Chen, Director He of the Finance Department, Salt Transport Envoy Shen, Associate Director Cui, and Director Cheng. The following key decisions were made: (1) The contract for the Fuzhou Kee Salt Company for 60,000 dan of salt will expire on January 20. A decision should be made whether to notify the company to continue the contract, or to solicit other merchants; (2) Of the salt tax revenue until the end of October of the 20th year, which is estimated to be 150,000 yuan, 40,000 yuan will be deducted from the special expenses of the three departments. The remaining funds will be allocated and used by the three departments according to their essential needs. The remaining shortage of 110,000 yuan will be evenly reduced from the proportion of the three departments and education funding to repay external debts. Future increases in revenue will still be paid according to the original budget. It is reported that the salt tax is completely contracted to merchants, and will be implemented from February. The current education funding is about 110,000 yuan per month, which is not much different from the original budget.</p>
<p>(2) Encouraging Department Staff with Six Matters: A memorial week was held on the 12th (Monday), where Director Cheng reported on his work and encouraged the department staff with six matters: (1) Focus on work and increase efficiency; (2) Save expenses and rectify the environment; (3) Comply with laws and strictly handle affairs; (4) Consider the circumstances and actively guide; (5) Emphasize publicity and cooperate internally and externally; (6) Formulate plans and strive for progress.</p>
<p>(3) Organizing a Party Principles Research Association: The Education Department originally had a Party Principles Research Association, which had completed its second phase of research. After the June 16th coup, it was suspended. Now Director Cheng has reorganized it, appointing the department staff Dai Xizhang, Wei Xianzhang, Weng Yan, Kong Liying, and Xue Yidan as members of the research association, with Dai Xizhang as chairman. A meeting was held on the 10th to discuss and resolve that research would begin immediately. The research methods will include reading, lecturing, discussion, and testing. The research materials will begin with the third phase of the National Reconstruction Program.</p>
<p>(4) Restoring the Jinjiang Rural Normal School: The Provincial Jinjiang Rural Normal School was temporarily suspended due to academic issues arising from relocation. Now Director Cheng believes that the school is of great importance to promoting rural education and improving agricultural and forestry production, and should be restored as soon as possible. He has appointed Liu Qingping as the school's preparatory officer, and ordered him to go to Jinjiang immediately to plan everything.</p>

<h3>Zhu Minyi Initiates Shanghai Academic Organizations</h3>
<p>Memorial Week Exchange Lecture Method</p>
<p>Dr. Zhu Minyi, Principal of the Shanghai Sino-French National Institute of Technology, recently initiated an exchange lecture method for the memorial weeks of various universities and colleges in Shanghai. He has sent letters to the authorities of each school for consultation. The letter from Mr. Zhu has been found and recorded below:</p>
<p>Ever since the death of our Party's General, the Central Government has stipulated that a memorial week for the General should be held on the 1st of each week, partly to commemorate the General's great spirit and personality, and to set an example for future generations, and partly to lecture on the General's teachings and report on domestic and international affairs, in order to promote each other. All administrative organs, agricultural, commercial, industrial, and academic organizations across the country have followed suit. However, because they are held separately, those in charge of the lectures are usually the leaders of each organ, who often feel that they lack information and the lectures are dull. Therefore, the Central Government recently stipulated that committee members should take turns giving reports at the memorial weeks to stimulate the interest of the listeners. For example, in the Shanghai Municipal Government, the mayor takes turns attending the memorial weeks of each bureau every week, both to understand the situation of each bureau and to encourage subordinates, which is a good intention and worthy of emulation. Therefore, I have proposed an exchange lecture method for the memorial weeks of various universities and colleges in Shanghai. It has been found that there are seventeen universities and colleges in Shanghai, national and registered with the Ministry of Education, including the School of Commerce, School of Medicine, Jiaotong University, Jinan University, Tongji University, Labor University, Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Sino-French National Institute of Technology, China Public School, Fudan University, Guanghua University, Datong University, Daxia University, Shanghai University, Law School, College of Law and Politics, Sino-French University, and College of Pharmacy, and the Academia Sinica, the highest institution of learning. The principals and presidents of each school and college will take turns participating in the memorial weeks of each school and college every week. For example, if there are schools A, B, C, and D, in the first week, the principal of school A will go to school B to lecture, the principal of school B will go to school C to lecture, the principal of school C will go to school D to lecture, and the principal of school D will go to school E to lecture. In the second week, the principal of school A will go to school C, the principal of school B will go to school D, the principal of school C will go to school E, and the principal of school D will go to school F. In this way, the principals of each school will take turns going to each school once a week. If there are six colleges and twelve schools in Shanghai, each principal will take turns going to each school for the memorial week once in eighteen weeks, exchanging back and forth. And each person and each lecture topic can be lectured eighteen times, and then the second lecture topic can be changed. In each school, eighteen different lectures will be heard in eighteen weeks. This will not only arouse the students' interest in participating in the memorial week and prevent them from getting bored, but also increase their various knowledge. On the part of the principals of each school, they can take the opportunity to contact each other to increase the feelings and unity between the universities and to provide academic assistance. Moreover, each time they attend the memorial week of each school, they can make a comparison of the students' participation in the memorial week and the situation of each school's teaching and management, so that they can learn from others' strengths and make up for their own weaknesses, and avoid the disadvantages of being separated from each other. I have discussed this idea with the authorities of each school, and they have expressed their approval. For the sake of formality, I am hereby requesting your agreement in writing. Whether this is feasible or not, I hope you will make a decision so that I can arrange to work together with each school. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>(1) Track and Field (Sprints): Yoshioka, Aizawa, Abu, Sasaki; (Middle Distance): Nakajima, Nishi, Yashiba; (Long Distance): Tsuda, Kita, Kitamoto, Hisatomi; (Marathon): Takahashi (Suzuki, Shioya, Kusunoki); (High and Low Hurdles): Miki, Iwanaga, Fujita; (Jumping): Nambu, Oda, Oshima, Kimura, Ono, Nishida; (Throwing): Sumiyoshi, Ito, Saito; (Pentathlon and Decathlon): Saito, etc., totaling 27 individuals, along with 5 supervisors and coaches.</p>
<p>(2) Swimming (Freestyle): Takaishi, Sada, Miyamoto, Takahashi, Makino, Yokoyama, Katayama, Takemura Kiyoshi, Takemura Tora, Tanaka, Yoneyama; (Backstroke): Irie, Suzuki, Kawazu; (Breaststroke): Tsuruta, Nakamura, Tsukahara, Okushi; (Diving): Mizutani, Hara, etc., totaling 20 individuals, along with 4 supervisors and coaches.</p>
<p>(3) Rowing: 15 athletes, 5 reserve athletes, and 3 supervisors and coaches.</p>
<p>(4) Soccer: 11 athletes, 4 reserve athletes, and 2 supervisors and coaches.</p>
<p>(5) Hockey: 11 athletes, 4 reserve athletes, and 2 supervisors and coaches.</p>
<p>(6) Boxing: 4 to 8 athletes, and 2 supervisors and coaches. (7) Skiing: Up to 10 athletes, and 2 supervisors and coaches.</p>
<p>(8) Skating: Up to 10 athletes, and 2 supervisors and coaches.</p>
<p>(9) Equestrian: 8 athletes, and 3 supervisors and coaches.</p>
<p>Regarding expenses, because the equestrian costs are exceedingly high, reaching 260,000 Japanese yen, they are listed under independent accounting. The travel (second class boat tickets), accommodation (averaging 1,000 yen per person per day), preparation, communication, social, sports equipment, medical, transportation, and other expenses for the athletes, supervisors, coaches, and staff (approximately 10, totaling 168 people) will require a total of 180,000 Japanese yen. It is hoped that the government will subsidize 80,000 yen for this amount (and an additional 20,000 yen for equestrian expenses, as the government subsidized a total of 80,000 yen, including 20,000 yen for equestrian, for the smaller number of athletes at the previous games). The remaining 100,000 yen is currently being raised by an organized fundraising committee appealing to society.</p>

<p>The status of higher education has been described above. For detailed information about the universities and specialized schools, please refer to the "Overview of Higher Education" published by the Ministry of Education. From it, one can see which schools or departments have too few students, too few teachers, or incomplete facilities, and urgently need improvement. Furthermore, only one or two universities have graduate schools; the rest do not. This is an area that still requires effort.</p>

<p>The previous second goes. The next second comes. Where is the present in between? A single unit. A double place. Infinity is born from the third.</p>
<p>Extremely rare. Listening to a military march, ten cups of wine. Isn't that excessive? Closing a private school, copying the Three Character Classic.</p>

<h3>Recalling the Past</h3>
<p>Uncle Wen</p>
<p>During the early years of Guangxu, Sun Qing, Grand Historian Mr. Gu Zishan (Wenbin) of Yuanhe County, Suzhou, retired from his position as Ning-Shao-Tai Circuit Intendant of Zhejiang. His official purse was ample, unlike Duke Lu Ji of Yulin, who returned home with only a boatload of jagged rocks. The Honest and Upright Official resided in the Iron Bottle Lane of Hulong Street, south of the city. At the east end of the lane was over ten acres of barren land. Gu acquired it at a low price, drew his own garden plans, hired craftsmen and gathered materials, planted flowers and bamboo, piled stones and dredged ponds. After seven or eight years of construction, it was completed. He asked the resident Mr. Yu Yinpu (Yue) of Deqing to inscribe the name "Yi Garden." The couplets in the garden were all collected by the owner himself from Song and Yuan lyrics and songs. Suzhou has many famous gardens, but Yi Garden stands out for its calligraphy. It also takes the meaning of sharing happiness with the people, allowing anyone to visit. The admission fee was fifty large coins. I, during the years of Renwu, Guiwei, Jia Shen, and Yi You, often accompanied my father, teachers, and elders to visit on fine days in spring and autumn. Now, forty years later, the Piano Pavilion of Po Xian and the Not-Crossing Boat, and the Sound of Zheng Chamber, still linger in my dreams. The garden owner possessed Jia Qiuhe's hobby. The Wen Zhu Hermitage did not lessen the Half Room Hall. Jade boxes and golden dragons were piled up like mountains. Once September arrived, those who enjoyed the beautiful autumn scenery within a hundred li of Suzhou would bring their green silk and green feathers to compete with Gu Zishan. This happened every year, and not just for one day. In late August of Dinghai, a young man surnamed Yao from Jiaxing suddenly arrived, extremely agile and handsome, wagering large amounts. Gu lost seventeen times in a row. His anger flared. He secretly thought that this Yao surnamed insect did not seem large in shape or different in appearance. Why did it chirp three times with every blade of grass it touched and break in two with every fight? There must be something suspicious about it. One day, he made a large bet of a thousand gold. The Yao surname happily agreed and placed the stake on the table. Both sides watched intently. Upon opening the cage and making a move, the Yao surname's general chirped three times, while the Gu surname's general seemed to be cut in half at the waist. Zishan could not contain his anger and reached out to grab the Yao insect. Who knew it was cast entirely of iron?</p>
<h3>The Flying Scissors of the Capital</h3>
<p>Chicken Crest</p>
<p>Gonghou Mountain near Chaotian Palace in the capital is covered with ancient tombs. There are two historical relics: a stone and a pair of scissors, both named "Flying." The stone is extremely large and, because of its age, is firmly rooted in the earth and difficult to move. However, the scissors are located at a high point, with their tips exposed. They are recorded in local chronicles and praised by people. Generally, these items originated in the Ming Dynasty, about five hundred years ago. After being buried deep, no one has ever moved them. According to local elders, the aura of kingship is concentrated in Jinling, and a true ruler will eventually emerge. Liu Bowen specially placed the Flying Scissors to break this aura. Such bizarre tales are hardly credible. Recently, the Municipal Bureau of Education, considering it a pity that the scissors are buried in the wilderness, decided to move them to a park for preservation and display for study. They hired workers and used hoes, and after more than three days, the scissors were fully revealed. Common people thought that with the scissor blades pointing upwards, there would surely be a handle remaining in the earth. However, after digging them up, it became clear that the so-called Flying Scissors were actually double-bladed scissors, different from ordinary ones. Although the scissors were fully exposed, their weight was too great to move. Experts say that mechanical power is needed.</p>
<p>The insect had its molted skin glued on. Inside, there was a small machine made of grass and magnetized stones, which is why it won.</p>
<h3>Drama News from Spring City</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Lanfang, Fengqing, Fuying, Miaoxiang and others have just finished performing at the Grand Theater in Shanghai, and Xiaolou, Lianliang, Xinyanqiu, and others are about to continue the spectacle. For a time, the Shanghai drama scene is said to be at its peak. However, taking another look at the drama scene in Beiping, having suddenly lost so many key figures, it is inevitably desolate and declining. Moreover, Shuyan has not been on stage for a long time, and Xue Yanqin has recently become a housewife. Other than these, those who can form a company on their own are only Yanqiu, Huisheng, Xiaoyun, Qingkui, Youchen, and Qin Xin. If these few people simultaneously performed in Shanghai, it could be called a grand gathering of heroes for a time. However, in the eyes of Beiping people, accustomed to appreciating drama, it is impossible not to feel a sense of desolation. Therefore, I will disclose their latest drama news below to inform those who care about the drama scene.</p>
<p>Yanqiu will perform at Zhonghe on the night of January 14th. The plays will be "Stabbing Tang" and "Disturbing the School." There will also be Shaolou's "Nanyang Pass" and Ruian's "Yin Family Fort." On the night of the 19th, the plays will be "Cosmic Front" and "Yellow Crane Tower" (playing a young male role in drag). On the night of the 21st, it will be "Green Frost Sword."</p>
<p>Huisheng has parted ways with Dayuan. Before going to Tianjin, she collaborated with the famous amateur Cheng Junmou, with very good results. After returning to Beiping, Cheng also appeared a few times. However, on the night of the 17th, when Huisheng performed "Embroidered Robe" at Jixiang, and on the night of the 18th for "Fish Algae Palace," Cheng Junmou's name was no longer there. The supporting cast included Shi Huibao, Wu Yanheng, Furong Cao, and others.</p>
<p>Xiaoyun has just married, and her star is shining brightly. On the night of the 17th, at the request of the Red Swastika Society of China's Charity Kitchen, she performed "Pearl Fan" at Huale. On the night of the 18th, she performed a public service charity show for the Outer Four Autonomous Regions at Huale. The play was "Spring and Autumn Match" (her younger brother, Fuxia, played as Li Chunfa), as the finale. The main play was Huisheng, Qingkui, and Shoushen's "Wan City." There was also Qin Nong, Zhong Heng, and Guixian's "Entering the Palace." This was truly a rare and excellent play recently. Qingkui performed a charity show at Huale on the night of the 17th, sharing the stage with Xiaoyun. The play was "Huang Tianba Robbing the Imperial Horse from the Song Dynasty." In addition, Li Jifu, an elder statesman of the amateur scene, also joined in performing "Yuntai Temple."</p>
<p>Youchen and Huang Guiqiu will perform "Xiangyang City" and "Searching Wolong Gang" at Kaiming on the night of the 15th, with the words "Different Stage Scenery" clearly marked. It seems hard to avoid the old routine of "Zhuge Liang Recruiting a Bride." Shang Heyu also performed "Knife Fighting on Foot." This old man's popularity is truly strong even in old age.</p>
<p>Qin Xin and Chang Laosi (Liheng) and Heyu will perform at Jixiang. The play on the night of the 16th will be Qin Xin's newly arranged "Peerless," with Cheng Jixian playing Wang Xianke, Shang Heyu playing Gu Yaya, and Liheng playing Nanyang Pass.</p>
<h3>Record of the Painting Exhibition Competition</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Recently, the flourishing of painting exhibitions in Shanghai has been more prosperous this year than in the past ten years. Since Mr. Xie Jun Gongzhan first held a painting exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association on New Year's Day, there have been the Six Harmonies Painting Exhibition and the Chinese Arts and Crafts School Painting Exhibition. Some say that this is an auspicious sign of abandoning arms and cultivating culture. The New Year is the beginning of the year. Since the beginning has been adorned with culture, its end will surely be a long path of elegance, and weapons will be sheathed. This statement cannot be denied. Since I have feasted my eyes, I must make a record of it to sing its praises. It should also be the first written word to emerge after twenty years of cultural development.</p>
<p>The excellent works in this painting exhibition of Xie Jun Gongzhan are too numerous to mention. After appreciating them, I sincerely feel that there is no word of praise from Youxia. Beneath a great reputation lies true substance. However, Mr. Xie is very modest and asked me to make an unbiased assessment. I cannot refuse. Therefore, I wrote: "Great strength and thick atmosphere. In today's art world, only you deserve it."</p>
<p>The Six Harmonies Painting Exhibition is composed of six gentlemen: Zhang, Ye, Shen, Guo, Gao, and Xu. The works exhibited are all carefully crafted and worthy of the ancients. Mr. Ye Wei Xin asked me to write a commentary. Who am I to dare to make an assessment? However, with treasures before my eyes, I cannot restrain myself. Therefore, I wrote: "Zhang is like a heavenly horse soaring through the sky, Ye is like a skilled hand catching cicadas, Shen has the skill of juggling beads, Guo has the craftsmanship of carving thorny monkeys, Gao is like pearls rolling on a jade plate, and Xu is like autumn water rippling."</p>
<p>This painting exhibition of the Chinese Arts and Crafts School is divided into two groups: off-campus and on-campus. Off-campus, such as myself and others, all joined in response to the call and will not be discussed further. Within the school, in addition to the professors, students such as Du Xiaofu, You Qikan, Zhou Shengan, Ding Yuerui, Wen Bingdun, Zuo Dequan, Qu Zongxie, Fang Jiangshui, and Huang Jinghua are all rising stars. Their mastery is so refined that even old painters cannot claim to be superior. It can be seen that the school's guidance is serious and Du and others' learning is well-rounded. It is said that the exhibition has recently been held along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and is very popular in society.</p>
<p>After writing this article, I have nothing to name it. I only feel that thousands of cliffs are competing to be beautiful, beyond comparison. So I will name it "Record of the Painting Exhibition Competition." Is it appropriate? Or not?</p>
<p>News from the Publishing World: The China Railway Transportation Society was organized by progressive figures in the railway industry such as Zheng Baozhao and Ge Li. They have also published the Railway Weekly this year. The first and second issues have already been published. The content is extremely rich and the layout is novel. Those who care about transportation cannot afford to be without a copy. In order to provide preferential treatment to readers, the publication is priced very cheaply.

Those who wish to subscribe by mail should enclose 3 cents for each issue and send it to Cheng Zhizheng at Shanghai Jiaotong University. It will be sent promptly.</p>
<h3>Paris Anecdotes (10) (1)</h3>
<p>Six once sent to Paris</p>
<p>This millionaire named Proba was a friend of Lenoir. He suddenly left them in a predicament. After running to South America, he gradually became wealthy. When Proba died, he entrusted this astronomer to find Miss Yalai and inherit all his property. Yalai suddenly encountered this unexpected event and simply didn't know what to do. She thought that inheriting such a large property was definitely not accidental. There was a photo of Proba hanging in her house. Her own appearance was very similar to that in the photo. Coupled with many past memories, she couldn't help but suspect her mother's chastity. Perhaps she was actually Proba's daughter. When she thought of this, she felt very sad because she loved her father, Lenoir, very much. Rather than letting the inheritance cause her father mental pain, she would rather sacrifice this great fortune that fell from the sky. But the sincere astronomer repeatedly insisted. Yalai had no choice but to accept. But she made a secret agreement with the astronomer to keep it a secret. Taking this capital, she bought the bank where Yalai now worked in the astronomer's name. Then, the astronomer invited Yalai to manage everything. This part is considered the most exciting part of the play. Many plots are complicated and interesting. The author simply plays the audience in the palm of his hand here. But in the end, everything was fine. Yalai became the owner of millions of assets and married her cousin. It turned out that Mr. Proba, who died in South America, was not her father, but her maternal grandfather. (Her maternal grandmother was unchaste.) Now everyone is satisfied. Needless to say, the money-loving aunt is happy. Mr. Lenoir, who is used to spending lavishly, also has money to spend. In short, money is omnipotent. Everyone is happy. The most unlucky one is only her nominal maternal grandfather who died many years ago.</p>
<p>Although this comedy does not contain any novel ideas, the author has keen insights into daily life. Many places are very amusing and very close to reason. Many dialogues are very strange and very natural. The organization of the whole play is tortuous and compact. Only those who are experienced in this way can do it. But even if the script is good, it will still be in vain without the performance of smart and experienced actors. When this play was first performed at the Athenee Theater, Rosemberg, a famous comedy actor, played the astronomer, vividly portraying a kind and upright old scholar. People couldn't help but laugh when they saw him. But in fact, there was nothing special about him. Mrs. Soria played Miss Yalai. Simple and beautiful, she naturally had a kind of youthful revelation. The other actors who played Lenoir, Gaston, and other roles were all able to fulfill their duties and express the wonderful flavor of the old Bellnard's works as much as possible.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (18)</p>
<p>| June 4 | St. Peter's Basilica | Vatican Papal Palace | Sistine Chapel |</p>
<p>We leaned against the railing and gazed at the fountain for quite a while. It was indeed beautiful. However, feeling slightly fatigued, we walked into a small hall inside the cloister. Sitting down inside, we saw, standing majestically in the center, the world-famous masterpiece called the Laocoon statue. This is a marvelous group sculpture and a treasure I have long admired. I often went to see its cast in the Louvre in Paris. The original is right here. I was naturally extremely delighted. I sat and looked at it for a while, then walked around and caressed it for a long time. I felt that the rich and meticulous spirit was even more clearly expressed than in the casts.</p>
<p>This is the masterpiece of the Greek Rhodes school sculptors Agesandro and his two sons Polydre and Athenodro, from the middle of the 1st century BC. This famous group sculpture depicts the Greek myth of Laocoon and his two dying sons struggling in the coils of the snakes sent by Apollo. The three bodies are united into one by the entanglement of the snakes. The uniqueness of the subject matter is beyond the imagination of modern people. The tense and strong torsos, the twisted waists, the thick folds of the medical area, the furrowed brows, the disheveled hair, and the fiery glow almost piercing through the intense eyes. The magnificent posture is simply like a towering mountain, not allowing people to let go for a moment. This kind of "man" versus "god" battle, expressing the passion of human tragedy, is so unsettling that it suffocates. The art of this Rhodes school sculptor is not inferior to the art of the Pergame school. Like the latter, it is erudite and vigorous, but even more "realistic" and "materialistic." Carefully gazing at the faces in this group sculpture, the heroic sentiment that allows Laocoon and his two sons to transform their expressions in their final sorrow is truly a masterpiece of art that is meticulously carved. All the strong power of the author seems to be completely released into this stone.</p>
<p>"Note" Pergame is a famous city in Asia Minor. Rhodes is one of the Aegean islands. From the death of Alexander the Great until the Romans conquered Greece, it is usually called the Hellenistic cultural era. Greek art gradually declined and new changes arose. In addition to the previous tranquility, elegance, and grandeur, it could also express distress and enthusiasm. Its representative writers were born in Pergame and Rhodes, forming the Pergame and Rhodes schools. The most famous sculptures of the Pergame school are "Gaul Suicide" and "Gladiator." The most famous sculpture of the Rhodes school is Laocoon.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Advances Again</h3>
<p>Rumor of Bank Absorbing Cash</p>
<p>The gold price fluctuated and rose from morning low to afternoon high. Yesterday, January 22nd, the price of gold trended upwards again. Weak in the morning, strong in the afternoon, and after noon, it escaped the 720 taels mark. However, the raging waves were difficult to quell. Fluctuations of ten taels at a time became commonplace. There were a total of 22 taels of ups and downs throughout the day. People's minds were confused, as if lost in a fog. As the exchange rate slightly relaxed, the listed price continued to increase by half a file. It was a clear example of divergent trends. The market trading was still active. Chen Feng, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Da De Cheng, etc., were on the buying side, while the sellers included Fu Chang, Yong Feng Heng, Xing Fu, Xing Yong, etc. With overseas silver markets also showing upward movement, gold prices were initially sluggish in the early morning. However, things changed rapidly. It once fell to the 700 taels mark. Afterwards, buyers were eager, especially with the rumor that a certain bank was buying spot goods. This sudden turn of events caused a surge of more than ten taels. The market became more favorable, with major players competing to buy. Yong Heng, Heng Xing, Tai Kang Run, Da De Cheng, etc., all entered. Zhi Feng Yong, Yu Da, and retail investors mostly sold off.

After 9:10, Xin Heng, etc., entered again, Mitsui bought March Dalian at 1.54625 taels, and banks did recent American gold at 31.75, causing it to rise again by six or seven taels, reaching 08 taels at 9:20. However, the advance listing had already increased by 125, American gold increased by 25, and Japanese gold decreased by 1.25, so it fell again to 04 taels. Not long after, Cheng Feng Yong Chen suddenly advanced, and in over ten minutes, it soared by ten taels, reaching fourteen taels around 9:50, then instantly retreating by four taels, reaching 710 taels around 10:00, so March British gold could be settled at 136875.

Afterwards, Fu Xing Yong Yuan Mao Yong, etc., sold off, so March British gold could be settled at 135625, with the bank buying price at 625. It suddenly depreciated six taels and over, and at noon it was calculated at 12 and a half taels, until the market closed at 15 taels, continuing to suppress it to three or four taels. The listed price was changed to 706 taels and 40 mace, calculated as 63-4 taels to 50 taels, and at noon it was 52 taels and 3.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Rebound Strongly</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned upward, and the situation is very tight. In fact, after manufacturers bought it the other day, the counter suddenly became dry, sellers were lacking, and foreign cotton rebounded, and the market sentiment was strong. However, the need for current yarn from all gangs has no excitement, so most retail investors tend to sell, but buyers, due to exchange rates and high prices of everything, have a strong desire to do more.</p>
<p>The Market for Human-Labeled Yarn Rebounds with Two Foreign Labels. The opening price of the market for Human-Labeled yarn showed a tight market with a lack of sellers on the floor.

<h3>The Cotton Market Has Fierce Gains</h3>
<p>Foreign Market Turns Around… Strong Buying Interest</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, and the upward trend is particularly sharp.

The Han gang will probably deliver this month, it is said.</p>

<h3>Grain, River Rice Market Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>In Zhabei yesterday, 30 boats from various provinces arrived, but sales remained sluggish. The white glutinous rice market weakened again, with high-quality rice falling in price. The situation became increasingly soft. Thin rice also tended to be sluggish, with prices seeing a slight decrease. The goat glutinous rice trade was active, and due to scarcity, there were no significant fluctuations. The Du Bu sharp rice sales were brisk, and the source was not abundant, so the market remained stable. The trade gradually became quiet. The price decreased slightly.</p>
<p>Yesterday in South Shanghai, 20 to 30 boats arrived. The local market sales were weak. Sales of regular white glutinous rice were extremely sluggish, especially high-quality goods. The market was inactive. The trend of Jiangsu and Zhejiang machine-milled rice was also listless, and retail sales were very weak. The above grades all fell by about 1 mace. The source of early thin rice from the southern route was slightly scarce, but merchants from Ningbo and other places were cautious due to the upcoming settlement of accounts. Therefore, the price was slightly reduced. The goat Du Bu sharp rice market was mediocre. The high-quality remained stable, while the middle and lower grades declined slightly. The white yuan hanging appetite was not good, and the overall price saw a drop of 1 mace. Throughout the day, the trade of rice from various provinces was sluggish.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Glutinous Rice Uniquely Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for out-of-town glutinous rice turned stable. Because the supply increased and the sales of out-of-town merchants slightly weakened. However, the local appetite turned active, and the market price did not fall due to the weak sales of out-of-town merchants. The overall market saw Guang merchants purchase more than 200 packages of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice. Ningbo merchants purchased several hundred packages of Jiangxi machine-milled early rice. Other Jiangxi and Hunan rice were all purchased by local merchants. Recently, the arrival of Nanjing machine-milled rice has been less, and the local market has instead paid attention. Yesterday, two small carts of new arrivals came, and the price rose by nearly 1 mace compared to the previous market. The total market transaction was 2,500 to 2,600 packages of various rice. Machine-milled Nanjing glutinous rice was 10 yuan and 1 mace. Rough rice was 8 yuan and 8 mace. Red rice was 10 yuan. Machine-milled late Jiangxi rice was 11 yuan and 7 mace. Machine-milled early rice was 10 yuan, 7 mace and 7 fen. Red late Hunan rice was 11 yuan, 1 mace and 3 fen. Red Hunan rice was 10 yuan and 1 mace. Medium and lower grades were reduced accordingly.

<h3>Selling Imported Wheat Competitively, Flour Market</h3>
<p>Manufacturers are selling futures one after another... Gradually weakened in the afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a downward trend in all months. Although there was no special change in the quotation of imported wheat, the sale of spot imported wheat was endless. Because imported wheat brokers took advantage of the slight increase in exchange rates, they inquired abroad. After the domestic operators returned the price, they took the opportunity to settle the price and place an order. Therefore, manufacturers, in view of the unfavorable situation, have mostly abandoned their prejudices and sold futures whenever they had the opportunity. The weakening in the afternoon was actually due to this reason. Watching the future, the situation of imported wheat falling by another 0.05 yuan may reappear. As a result, this month was 0.05 yuan lower than the previous day, February was 0.01 yuan lower, March was 0.015 yuan lower, April and May were 0.0175 yuan lower, and June was 0.02 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the morning opening of the wheat futures market showed a sluggish trend in all months. Because the quotation of imported wheat remained flat and soft, most people could not help but wait and see. In the afternoon, it was rumored that a certain merchant had sold imported wheat, and it was heard that Australian white wheat was only 4 taels and 0.05 yuan. Therefore, those who sold to the market poured out like a tide, offering prices regardless of the price. Therefore, people's hearts were greatly shaken, and the market was very soft. The circular buying and selling, which continued to set the price of imported wheat and then sell it to the market, was very worrying for the future. As a result, the prices for January, February, March, and April fell by 0.03 yuan each compared to the previous day. The new wheat for June also fell by 0.04 yuan. Spot wheat was silent due to the lack of arrivals and sales, and there was no trading.</p>
<h3>Soybean Futures Firm, Soybean Cake Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading volume of soybean futures for this month was flat. The Green River month will soon be delivered, and most of it has been proposed to settle in cash. Therefore, the market price did not fluctuate much. The distant months followed suit due to the slight increase in consecutive letters, but the buying interest from all parties was not smooth, and only increased slightly. As a result, compared with the previous day, the January contract was flat, the February and March contracts were up 0.01 yuan each, and the April contract was up 0.03 yuan, and the May contract was up 0.02 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of bean cake was very flat. Merchants from other provinces made slight purchases, and factories and Lian merchants made slight sales. And the brokers had slight entries and exits. The market sentiment was similar to the previous day, so there was only a fluctuation of 0.005 yuan up and down in the morning and afternoon sessions. The closing price was flat for March, up 0.005 yuan for April and May, and down 0.0075 yuan for June.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Trade Quiet, Market Firm</h3>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's telegram from the producing area showed that the spot price of Cuban sugar was still 1.40625. The prices of New York sugar futures for March and September did not rise or fall, the price for May fell 0.01 yuan, and the price for December rose 0.01 yuan. The price of Java refined sugar also did not rise or fall. The Association Market's marked price, Dutch sugar No. 24, the trade of raw and white sugar was very scarce. Although the buyers were not strong, the sellers were still tight. As a result, the transaction price was still 10 taels and 2 mace, and the market was very firm. Medium and fine white sugar and other types still had no transactions. The trading of Japanese sugar was also not very prosperous. Minghua YT Mark 10 taels and 3 mace, Meiji goods 10 taels and 3 mace and 5 fen, YP Mark 10 taels and 5 mace and 5 fen, YRO Mark 9 taels and 9 mace, the market situation was also flat.

The price of Five Blessings Ice, domestic goods, was originally 8 taels and 7 mace, and continued to be offered. Thai Yuan Ice arrived in more than 200 boxes yesterday, but there were still few buyers, and the market situation was also stable.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Daylily Market Price Recovers and Loosens</h3>
<p>Since the market price of daylilies has been rising, the sales of Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants were initially quite smooth, but recently they have gradually become stagnant. Therefore, for merchants' goods, those purchased at low prices are inevitably loosening in price, with an up and down fluctuation of about 2 taels compared to the previous market. The market price yesterday for top-grade daylilies was 30 taels, and then from 25 to 26 taels to 22 taels. However, the brokers still stood firm due to cost considerations and were unwilling to compromise. And those from other provinces who purchased directly from the local area did not loosen the price either. In fact, the future market can be stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factory's Processed Goods Scarce and Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of white processed silk in Shanghai was still difficult to turn smooth. Because overseas silk telegraphs continued to arrive in Shanghai. European and American merchants had a strong appetite. The goods in the hands of various manufacturers were becoming increasingly scarce, and raw materials were also in short supply. There were no goods on the market. Yesterday, only Mitsui and others imported 30 packages of Shanghai white processed silk, Kaili and others imported 30 packages of Sichuan yellow processed silk, and Dachang and others imported 20 packages of white dry processed silk. The prices were all firm.</p>
<h3>Precious Eyebrow Green Tea's Falling Trend Continues</h3>
<p>In the local foreign merchant tea market, in recent days, the trading of Needle Eyebrow and Delicate Eyebrow has been quite prosperous. And because the inventory is scarce, the price is slightly better than before. However, the most important Precious Eyebrow green tea still has an inventory of more than 20,000 boxes. British and French merchants still dare not hoard Chinese tea. Chinese tea merchants are eager to sell and are willing to lower prices again and again. Yesterday, Tongfu and Baochang and other firms had a small number of purchases of Precious Eyebrow, but the market fell by another 3 to 4 taels compared to the previous market. The trend of the tea market has become the end of its strength.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Surge Before Year-End Slows Down</h3>
<p>The rising trend in the local factory cloth market has gradually subsided. Because the end of the year is approaching, most people in the area are preparing, so trading in futures has come to an end. From yesterday onwards, merchants from other provinces were not as smooth as before. Fine cloth was slightly soft. Trumpet Boy and Yang Crane were both 7 taels, Blue Double Fish was 7 taels and 5 fen, and Human Clock was 6 taels and 6 mace. Fine twill Yang Crane was still expensive due to the lack of spot goods. Yesterday, it opened at 7 taels and 3 mace and 5 fen, and Blue Double Fish was 6 taels and 9 mace and 5 fen. Coarse cloth, 9-pound goods, was still popular. Cat Five Bats still required 4 taels, 4 mace and 7 fen and 5 li. Jardine Matheson bleached cloth rose with foreign goods and opened at 8 taels and 4 mace and 5 fen. Coarse twill was unremarkable. Cat was 5 taels, 1 mace and 7 fen and 5 li. Three Rabbits were 5 taels and 3 mace, and Three Fish were 5 taels and 3 mace and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Eastern piece goods, velvet products, saw a slight decline. Water Wave Velvet and Moon Flower Velvet were both soft. However, Big Red Velvet reappeared at a new high price and sold for 2 mace and 3 fen and 5 li yesterday. Concubine French Velvet returned to 2 mace and 2 fen and 5 li due to the gradual increase in spot goods. Printed Straight Tribute Nè became more and more expensive. Yesterday, bald Big Red was 4 mace and 1 fen, and Assorted Colors was 3 mace and 9 fen and 5 li. Hunting Goose, Moganshan, and Straight Tribute Nè, which were once out of stock, had slightly more spot goods yesterday. Fine Serge had arrived in Shanghai one after another. Lakeside Pavilion Blue Gray opened at 3 mace, 4 fen and 2 li and 5 hao, Assorted Colors at 3 mace and 4 fen, Joy at 2 mace, 3 fen and 7 li and 5 hao, Ancient City Association at 3 mace and 8 fen, and Treasure Ball at 3 mace, 7 fen and 7 li and 5 hao. Western goods also saw a decline in activity.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Lead Wire Soars in Price</h3>
<p>New lead wire was very popular due to insufficient supply. Recently, the Hankou merchants suddenly made a large purchase, so the trend was even better. The standard soared in price. From the 16th to the 20th, it was estimated at 14 taels and 5 mace. From the 21st to the 25th, it was sold at 18 taels. It was heard that 400 to 500 dan were approved yesterday, which made the market goods even scarcer.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt and Sichuan Camellia Both Tend to Rise</h3>
<p>Because of the continuous arrival of new goods in Hankou, the price of tallow oil fell again and again. The price of Chongqing oil only opened at 15 taels. Various merchants, in view of the fact that the selling price had reached a low level, started to purchase. At the same time, various foreign firms also inquired. The market atmosphere suddenly tightened. Chongqing and Macheng both rose by 2 mace, which was 15 taels and 2 mace. The brokers believed that the harvest this year was poor, and the late arrivals might be scarce, so the price still needed to be raised by 3 to 4 mace. The local market price has been changed. The current selling price of famous Chongqing oil is 20 taels and 4 mace, Chongqing oil is 20 taels and 2 mace, Macheng is 19 taels and 6 mace, and Ping oil is out of stock. The land price of Sichuan camellia continued to rise. The market price rose accordingly. The heart plate of rice opened to 115 taels, and the unified account has reached 120 taels. The broker's selling price is also at 120 taels. The future market will not be sold without additional cost.</p>

<h3>Foreigners are not Allowed to Hunt in the Garrison Area</h3>

The Ministry should be requested to consult with the embassies of various countries and instruct foreigners to be notified that, regardless of whether they hold a passport or not, they may not patrol and hunt in the garrison area. Whether it is appropriate or not, the instructions are to be followed. The Garrison Department has sent letters to the Foreign Affairs Department and the Municipal Government for reference.</p>

<h3>Xia Shaoen Indicted by Procuratorate in Zhao Assassination Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>And Request to Transfer Wang Laosan to the Court</p>
<p>The perpetrator of Zhao Tieqiao's assassination, Xia Shaoen, was arrested by the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau and sent to the local court. Yesterday, the procuratorate indicted him. The original text is excerpted as follows: "Indictment" Xia Shaoen, (ie Xia Shaoen), male, 36 years old, from Hefei, Anhui. The defendant on the right, the murder case No. 808 of the 19th year of the Republic of China, has been investigated in accordance with the law and is deemed to be filed for public prosecution. The defendant's criminal facts and the legal provisions he violated are listed below. On December 30 of last year, the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau submitted a suspect, Xia Shaoen, in the case of the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, the former director of the China Merchants Bureau, along with a confession to the court for handling. According to the defendant Xia Shaoen's confession, my family lives in Wu Huari, Yangjiadu, Pudong. I know Wang Laosan because we are from the same village. He (referring to Wang Laosan) came to my house that day (the date is forgotten) and invited me to Shanghai to play. I said that I wanted to sell vegetables for a living and had no time. He bought rice for two yuan. The next day he came to my house and invited me to Shanghai to beat people. After arriving in Shanghai, he gave me a box gun first. I said I couldn't use it. Later, I changed to a six-wheeled pistol, loaded with bullets. I said that killing people would cost my life. He said that I had to do it, and if I didn't go, he would kill my family. He forced me to go with him. After the beating, Wang Laosan gave me 100 yuan and took back the original pistol he had given me before. He also said that the day I was in Shanghai, I met with Wang Laosan, Liu Anru, Fei Xiangyun, and others in someone's house. Wang Laosan took out a four-inch photo of Zhao Tieqiao and handed it to Liu Anru to look at. Liu Anhe immediately recognized it on the spot and shot it. Fei Xiangyun only watched it clearly from the side. After I finished looking at the photo, I went to a restaurant with Wang Laosan, Liu Anru, Fei Xiangyun and others to eat porridge. Wang Laosan gave me one yuan for the meal. After eating, we proceeded to the entrance of the China Merchants Bureau on the Bund. Wang, Liu, and Fei walked quickly and arrived at the destination first. The planned Liu Anru fired the shot and killed Zhao Tieqiao. Because I was lame, I walked behind. Although I didn't see who fired the gun at what location, I heard Wang Laosan say to me afterwards that Zhao Tieqiao was killed by Liu Anru's shot. As for the clothes worn by Liu Anru, he was wearing a silky white short jacket and trousers. Wang Laosan, Fei Xiangyun and I were all wearing blue short jackets and trousers. I confessed repeatedly that it was the truth and asked for leniency." In summary, referring to the confession of Xitan Zhen, Burais said that the first murderer was wearing white and the second murderer could prove that he was the person who shot the bodyguard. The driver Shen Asan said, "That day I sent Director Zhao to the bureau to work, and his wife didn't get out of the car. When the master got out of the car, I suddenly heard a gunshot, and I saw a man wearing a white willow branch shirt, holding a pistol, coming out of the bureau's entrance and escaping to the Bund." (See the confessions of Zhen Burais and Shen Asan in the special zone volume) There is no doubt that Xia Shaoen is an accomplice. He has an agreement on the time and place of the combination and the subsequent dissolution. He received property and escaped, which shows that he is one of the premeditated persons. Based on the above description, the facts of this case are clear. Except for Liu Anru and Fei Xiangyun, who will be dealt with after they are arrested, the defendant Xia Shaoen has committed the crime of Article 42 and Article 284, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Criminal Law, and shall be transferred for public trial in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>Liu Maochu, the chief prosecutor, heard that the city's public security bureau has arrested Wang Laosan, and has specially written to the city government to transfer the suspect for handling. According to Liu's opinion, the handling of affairs should be rapid and cautious. Although Xia Shaoen did not admit that he was the person who directly shot Zhao Tieqiao, from a legal point of view, according to the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Republic of China, No. 8 in the fourth year, No. 34 in the fifth year, and No. 576 in the tenth year, he should be treated as the principal offender. According to the interpretation of No. 27 in the sixth year, it is naturally a completed crime, and the only legal punishment is the death penalty.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's Conference on Cutting Li Tax Postponed</h3>

<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Directs Factories to Implement the Factory Law</h3>
<p>The Situation on the Second Day</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, regarding the Factory Law and its Enforcement Regulations, which have been promulgated by the Central Government in succession, and scheduled to take effect on February 1st of this year, has not only issued notifications but also, to guide factories in complying, printed thousands of copies of small booklets containing the Factory Law and its Enforcement Regulations. Additionally, key provisions of the law have been listed and printed in detail, distributed to various factories, ensuring a clear understanding of the legislative intent. As the implementation date approaches, representatives from various industries and factories have been summoned to the bureau for detailed instructions, urging compliance with the laws and strict implementation. Starting February 1st, personnel will be dispatched daily to inspect factories. Violators, it is said, will be subject to penalties.</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, summoning representatives from various industries to the bureau, is guiding the implementation of the Factory Law and discussing matters within the scope of factories. Yesterday marked the second day of such guidance. In the morning, representatives from the letterpress printing and color printing industries reported in, including Lu Fengzuo from color printing and Shi Jiuyun from letterpress printing, totaling more than ten people. In the afternoon, representatives from the cosmetics industry reported in, including Chen Diexian and others from the Family Industrial Cooperative, Xiangya Company, and China Daixue Industrial Cooperative, totaling four people. Xu Zhi and Tian Heqing, staff members from the Social Affairs Bureau, attended the talks. The representatives from various industries had numerous opinions regarding the implementation of the Factory Law, requiring detailed study. (1) Regarding factory meetings, can workers be selected as representatives alongside employer-appointed representatives? (2) Does the factory bear obligations under the Factory Law for temporary piece-rate workers? Representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau reported on four items: (1) Submit factory management regulations to the bureau for review as soon as possible. (2) Establish labor contracts for workers in factories as soon as possible. (3) Factories must urgently report the ages of child laborers, bonus and incentive programs, and detailed rules for factory meetings. (4) Factories should expedite the installation of safety equipment, such as emergency exits, fire escapes, and smoking rooms, if not yet equipped. The recent tragedy at the Fuchang Military Garment Factory, was also due to inadequate equipment. The above four items represent the initial steps in implementing the Factory Law. It is hoped that representatives from various industries will convey this to their respective factories for immediate implementation. After the talks, the bureau printed and distributed an explanation table of the Factory Law to the representatives. It is reported that the bureau will answer the opinions on the Factory Law suggested by representatives of various industries,</p>
<p>Providing answers where possible, and conducting further detailed research for those that cannot be answered immediately. Today, the bureau will summon representatives from the oil pressing industry in the morning and the egg industry in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Fei Bohong wrote a letter stating: The news report on the 22nd in various Shanghai newspapers regarding "Discussion of Implementing the Factory Law" contained discrepancies regarding my statements. In fact, I attended that day as a representative of the Chinese General Chamber of Industry and presented four formal points from the Chamber's standpoint: (1) All factories, both Chinese and foreign, should implement the law uniformly. (2) Both labor and management should implement the law uniformly. (3) Regarding time off, holidays, and night work for female workers, a grace period should be considered for certain industries. (4) Ambiguous wording should be clarified. Subsequent remarks were either clarifications or discussions with others and not formal proposals. Later, when the issue of factory meetings was raised, I stated, "Factory meetings are not subject to penalties under the Factory Law, and whether enforcement is mandatory is questionable. The Social Affairs Bureau should consider formulating implementation measures, as it is not easy for small factory owners to send many representatives." Furthermore, I stated, "What measures will be taken if foreign-owned factories in China refuse to implement the Factory Law?" Some errors may exist in the wording of newspaper reports, and some statements may be mixed with those of others, which could lead to misunderstandings. This statement is for clarification.</p>
<h3>Qian Chengxu Discusses the Factory Law</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Qian Chengxu, representative of the Chinese General Chamber of Industry, returned to Shanghai from the capital early yesterday morning. In an interview with our reporter, he stated that domestic factories in China have recently experienced a degree of panic upon hearing that the Factory Law will soon be implemented. However, in terms of the law itself, the principles adopted are not incompatible with current trends, nor does the legislation fail to recognize domestic conditions. Unfortunately, the level of Chinese industry is too underdeveloped, and production capacity is inferior to that of others. Due to these various factors, the implementation of the law is perceived as a sudden hardship in reality, and everything cannot meet the spirit and purpose of the law. The national industrial organizations, for this reason, specifically dispatched me to the capital to submit several clauses of the Factory Law that are truly difficult to implement, requesting the government to consider allowing a period of grace for making preparations. It is not true that they are requesting the government to postpone the implementation. When asked about the government's attitude, Qian replied that the Ministry of Industry has requested the National Government to grant a one-year grace period for Article 13 of the Factory Law concerning night work for female workers. When further asked whether the law would apply uniformly within the concessions and the mainland after its implementation, he replied that, in his personal opinion, there seem to be some problems that can be studied regarding the status of the concession's Municipal Council and extraterritorial rights. (1) Since there are still obstacles to the implementation of special Chinese laws in the concessions, the Municipal Council could use this as an excuse to evade responsibility for enforcement. (2) Factories with extraterritorial rights are not subject to Chinese laws, and the law itself would therefore lose its effectiveness. The impact could lead to disputes over treatment due to the different positions of Chinese and foreign factories. However, it is rumored that the government authorities have already established appropriate measures for this situation.</p>

<p>Concerning the Reduction of Shipping Fees for Overseas Chinese Silver Letters</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways sent a telegram to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Association regarding the reduction of shipping fees for silver letters from overseas Chinese, stating: Telegram received. Shipping fees for bulk silver on the Chao-Shan Railway have been ordered to be reduced by half in accordance with the cargo classification table and passenger transport regulations.

In addition to informing overseas Chinese in various regions, we respectfully express our gratitude via telegram. We still implore you to exercise your powers as a senior official and continue to alleviate the difficulties of overseas Chinese. The Overseas Chinese Association bows respectfully, Yang.</p>

<h3>Special Shipping News</h3>
<p>Fog, Ice, and Shallow Water</p>
<p>Affecting Ship Traffic</p>
<p>Heavy Fog Delays Merchant Ships Yesterday, there was heavy fog in Shanghai. The fog was especially heavy at the mouth of the Wusong River. The sea lanes were indistinguishable, causing ships coming from the Yangtze River, such as the Jianghua, Jiangxin, and Anqing, and ships coming from the coast, such as the Sichuan and Pingnai'erdi, to be unable to enter the Huangpu River. They anchored in the Yangtze River estuary and outside Sanjia Water, sounding their horns to warn of their presence and temporarily avoid the heavy fog for safety. Statistics show that more than twenty ships, large and small, were delayed by the fog yesterday. There were also a dozen Shanghai-bound ships anchored at sea and taking refuge from the fog in the Wusong River. As a result, only the Ningbo class Ningxing and Xinjiangtian and three Jianghai ships arrived as imports yesterday. The news of other ships is still unknown. The Asian Queen, a mail ship of the Changxing Company, which was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, was also delayed by the fog. According to a telegram from the ship, it is expected to enter the port at 7:00 AM today, with passengers disembarking at the Customs wharf at 8:00 AM and departing for Hong Kong on the 24th. The Shinyo Maru of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company was also blocked by the fog yesterday and did not enter the port. Huang Shaoxiong, who was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on that ship to resolve the affairs of the Guangxi Bureau, also did not arrive and is now scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>The Qitai Runs Aground Upstream. The Qitai, a ship of the American-owned Jiejang Company, was transporting goods from Yichang to Shanghai. It encountered a significant reduction in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Areas below Shashi, such as Tianxinggang and Chenglingji, had only six feet of water depth during low tide, causing almost all of the upstream merchant ships to be blocked. Although the Qitai is a shallow-draft vessel, it ran aground while passing through Chenglingji. Due to the cargo on board, the bottom of the ship became deeply embedded in the sand and mud, making it impossible to move. The Hankou branch of the Jiejang Company, upon receiving the news, urgently dispatched several tugs and barges to unload the cargo from the ship's various holds to reduce its weight before attempting to tow it. However, even after the holds were emptied, the ship still could not be freed. The branch then ordered the cargo of the Qitai to be transported to Hankou and transshipped to Shanghai on other vessels. The Qitai had to be left aground on the sandbar, waiting for the water to rise before being towed away.</p>
<h3>Shipwrecked Crew Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>In November of last year, the Nanshan Maqin, a ship of the British-owned Lai Ci Foreign Firm, struck a reef in the Peacock Harbor area north of Vladivostok. The ship could not be salvaged. Now that the area is completely frozen, all forty crew members and sailors have been ordered by Maqin, the manager of the firm, to leave the ship and return to Shanghai, awaiting salvage after the thaw in the spring. The crew members have already departed from Vladivostok on the firm's Minan Maqin and are returning to Shanghai. Another ship will be sent to Peacock Harbor after April next year to tow the ship.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Party Members Request National Funeral for Lu Xiqing</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Committee Initiates a Grand Memorial Service</p>
<p>Scheduled to be Held in Chongqing on February 20th</p>
<p>Xiang Chuanyi, a member of the Sichuan Provincial Government; Song Shaozeng, a member of the Party Committee; and Huang Shengxiang and Xia Zhishi, fellow members of the Kuomintang, among dozens of others, had previously expressed their desire to request the National Government to grant a national funeral for General Lu Xiqing. According to news from the Sichuanese community in Shanghai, Ma Yaosheng and Wang Gongdu, among twenty-nine Sichuanese party members, also sent a telegram to the central government requesting a national funeral for General Lu to comfort his loyal spirit. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, General Lu Xiqing dedicated his loyalty to the party and the country and died from overwork. All who know and do not know him are in grief. General Lu Xiqing, in addition to assisting Premier Sun Yat-sen in restoring Guangzhou, laying the foundation for the National Government, and following Premier Sun Yat-sen north to complete the revolution, (garbled code) need not be elaborated. During the campaign against Yuan Shikai, he served as the rearguard in Wanxian, Sichuan, negotiated alone with the Qin army, prohibiting the violation of civilians, and subsidized comrades who fled to Shanghai, secretly serving as the center of gravity for party members in the southwestern provinces. During the National Protection War, he risked his life to arrive in Chengdu, plotting to make Chen Huan (Chen Er'an) independent, allowing Cai E to achieve success with a few thousand troops. All of these are important achievements, and his contributions cannot be compared. His achievements are comparable to those who were buried alongside Premier Sun Yat-sen. Therefore, we jointly request that he be given a national funeral to comfort his spirit and set an example. This telegram is to inform you, and we respectfully request your approval. Sichuan party members Ma Yaosheng and others (names omitted) kowtow."</p>
<p>Further news: The death of General Lu is deeply mourned by party members in Sichuan. The Provincial Committee has initiated a grand memorial service scheduled to be held in Chongqing on February 20th. The telegram sent by the Provincial Committee to the Shanghai Funeral Committee is supplemented below: "To the Shanghai Funeral Committee for Lu Xiqing, Our previous telegrams should have arrived. We share your deep grief over the passing of Comrade Lu. In addition to sending a telegram to the central government requesting generous compensation, our committee has initiated a resolution to hold a memorial service in Chongqing on February 20th. We have appointed five comrades from our committee: Jie Chongzhi, Luo Wenhan, Zhou Kaiqing, Jiang Yurong, and Long Teng, as preparatory personnel, and have telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government, the various army and division commanders, the various county and city committees, major institutions, legal entities, schools, and newspapers to send representatives to participate. We urgently inform you of this and request your guidance. The Sichuan Party Affairs Steering Committee kowtows."</p>
<h3>Whitey Rophiell to Leave Shanghai by Plane Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Whitey Rophiell, Director of the Aviation Department of the American Trading Company, originally planned to fly to the Philippines yesterday morning. However, after receiving a message from the Zikawei Observatory that the weather was not good along the way, he was unable to depart. If the weather is good tomorrow morning, he plans to leave Shanghai at 8:00 AM. Although he will pass through Fuzhou on the way, he does not intend to land unless absolutely necessary, so as not to delay the journey to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Executive Committee Stipulates Methods for Lecturing on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings during Commemoration Week</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters previously resolved at the Fourth Plenary Session that the speech program during Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Commemoration Week should be changed to reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings or work reports, and has been following this accordingly. However, this work has always been undertaken by members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees. Now that the scope of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings is very broad, lecture materials should be determined well in advance. In order to urge comrades to conduct more widespread and in-depth research on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the 80th Standing Committee Meeting of the Committee resolved to assign the Training Department to formulate methods. It is now known that the Training Department has complied with the wishes of the Executive Committee and formulated six methods, which were submitted to the 81st Standing Committee Meeting of the Executive Committee and resolved to be amended and passed. The full text is recorded as follows: (1) All staff members of the Committee, except for the members who will continue to give lectures as usual, must abide by the provisions of these methods. (2) The staff member who will lecture on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings each week will be decided by the Chairman using a lottery method after the report. (3) If a staff member has important business and cannot attend, the relevant department or committee must formally send a letter to the Training Department to request leave on their behalf. If leave is not requested and the staff member does not attend the lecture, they will be punished in accordance with the regulations on non-attendance at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Commemoration Week. (4) The topic of the weekly lecture on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings will be determined by the Training Department and announced at the end of each Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Commemoration Week. (5) The time for each weekly lecture shall not exceed twenty minutes at most. If necessary, it may be extended with the permission of the Chairman. (6) These methods will be executed by the Training Department after being approved by the Municipal Executive Committee and agreed to by the Municipal Supervisory Committee.</p>

<h3>The Central Government Dispatches Personnel to Inspect Party Affairs on Two Railways</h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters, as the re-election of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways is imminent, specially dispatched Xiao Fengwei (Zi Hui Ru, from Hunan) to the Headquarters at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday (January 21st) to inspect for one week. He is staying at Room 77 of the Hongkou Grand Hotel on North Sichuan Road. Yesterday (January 22nd), he inspected the First District Party Headquarters affiliated with the Headquarters and attended the Executive Committee meeting. Tonight, he will take a ship to Ningbo to inspect the Sixth District Party Headquarters of the Headquarters in the Ningbo-Shaoxing section. After completing the inspection, he will take a car from Baiguan to Hangzhou to inspect the Fifth District Party Headquarters of the Headquarters in the Shanghai-Hangzhou section. He will then proceed to Suzhou (Second District), Changzhou (Third District), and Zhenjiang (Fourth District) in order, before returning to Nanjing to report on his mission.</p>
<h3>The Truth about the Sealing of the Preparatory Committee of the Gate North Rickshaw Pullers Union</h3>
<p>Statements from Responsible Persons of the Civil Training Association</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspapers reported news of a petition by rickshaw pullers in Zhabei. A reporter from the Guomin News Agency made a special trip to the Civil Training Association of the Municipal Party Headquarters to inquire about the truth. According to the responsible person of the Association, Chen Jintang and He Wushan, among others, claiming to be representatives of rickshaw pullers, had previously petitioned the Civil Training Association to allow the establishment of a rickshaw pullers union. After investigation, it was found that there were people from outside the industry mixed in. The establishment was therefore disapproved in separate instructions, and the Public Security Bureau was instructed to seal it. However, the initiators had established a preparatory office without authorization and published announcements falsely claiming approval from the Central and Municipal Party Headquarters, intending to profit from it. After the Preparatory Committee of the Zhabei Republican Road Zhen'anli Rickshaw Pullers Union was sealed by the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, representatives Liu Fujun and others petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters. They were received and explained in detail as follows: Because many of the organizers and initiators of their organizations are people from outside the industry, which is inconsistent with the principle of voluntary organization in the Trade Union Law, and because this matter is significant, it is easy to create abuses without careful planning, and because this association intends to reorganize all trade unions in the city in accordance with the current Trade Union Law, any newly formed groups will be considered with caution. However, the notices published in various newspapers by the preparatory offices of the rickshaw pullers unions mutually attacked each other, claiming that they had been approved by this association or the Central Government, which is a violation of orders and an attempt to profit. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau was instructed to seal them. As for the news reported in the newspapers yesterday, it is not reliable.</p>
<h3>Year-End Bonus Issue for Two Railways</h3>
<p>Employees Demand Payment in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways stipulated that the year-end bonus method for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways should be 20% of the net operating profit. In 1929, employees of the two railways received bonuses for two months. Although the situation was affected by military actions last year, the operating conditions were still very good due to the efforts of all employees, especially on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. If calculated according to the prescribed method, each employee should receive at least one and a half months' salary as a bonus. However, the railway bureau notified that only one month's bonus would be paid, which deeply disappointed all employees. They have been demanding that the railway bureau still pay the bonus in accordance with the regulations. The organizing committee of the two railways has, based on submissions from the trade unions of the Ningbo-Shaoxing section, the Shanghai Machinery Factory, the Wusong Machinery Factory, the traffic unions of the Beijing-Shanghai section, the machinery unions of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section, and requests from various employees, forwarded a letter to the railway bureau requesting that the matter be handled in accordance with the regulations. It is reported that the railway bureau has indicated that it will submit another report to the Ministry of Railways to request approval for an additional half-month's bonus.</p>
<h3>Naval Headquarters Paying Attention to Japanese Fishing Vessels Intruding to Catch Fish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it issued a circular to all affiliated warships for strict investigation</p>
<p>The naval warships stationed in Shanghai received a circular from the Naval Headquarters yesterday stating that Japanese fishing vessels have repeatedly been found intruding into our country's territorial waters along the coasts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong to fish and steal marine products, causing our country's fisheries to decline day by day, which deeply affects the livelihoods of coastal residents. Therefore, the circular orders all affiliated warships to strictly investigate the actions of Japanese fishing vessels when patrolling the seas and to stop them at any time in order to protect our country's fishing rights (Daily News).</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Association Thanks the Central Government</h3>
<p>For Revising the Passport Law</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Association believes that the revised passport regulations issued by the Central Government are much better than before and has sent telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan to express its appreciation. The original texts are recorded below: (1) "To the Nanjing National Government and the Executive Yuan, the Association previously submitted a request to your government to improve the passport measures. Fortunately, you adopted our views and referred them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for revision. After reading the approved regulations, we found that they are much better than before. In addition to sending a telegram to overseas Chinese to publicize this virtue, we first express our sincere gratitude and implore you to continue to alleviate the hardships of overseas Chinese, who are patriotic and enthusiastic." The Overseas Chinese Association, acting chairman Xu Jigong, kowtows. Yang. (2) "To President Hu and Vice President Lin of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan and the honorable members of the Committee, the Association petitioned your esteemed Yuan to improve the passport measures, and we are grateful for your adoption. In addition to sending a telegram to overseas Chinese to publicize this virtue, we first express our gratitude via telegram and implore you to continue to create blessings for overseas Chinese." The Overseas Chinese Association bows respectfully. Yang.</p>
<h3>Insurance Regulations Should Be Recorded in Both Chinese and Western Languages</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Asks the Joint Foreign Chamber of Commerce to Order Transfer and Persuade Compliance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Joint Foreign Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, after investigation, various foreign insurance companies conducted insurance business last year, and for Chinese policyholders, in addition to using both Chinese and Western languages for the policy, all the articles and regulations attached to the policy were recorded only in English, which is very incomplete. The articles and regulations of the insurance companies are matters that both parties should abide by, and whether compensation should be paid is determined by this when a problem arises with the guaranteed risk. How important is this relationship? Very few Chinese policyholders can understand English. At the time of insurance, they only rely on the persuasion of the intermediary and cannot understand the content in detail. Once a compensation liability issue arises, they often hold their own opinions, disputes drag on for years, and are difficult to resolve. Once this situation is spread, it only makes the insurance companies' plans to develop their business suffer an invisible setback. Moreover, in terms of sorting out, the insurance company and the policyholder have a contractual relationship, then Party A has the obligation to let Party B understand the content of the contract. In terms of human feelings, Chinese businessmen operate in China, and Chinese people are both landlords and responsible for their master's status. All businessmen take obedience to the customer's hobbies and customs as a way to make money. The text used in the contract stipulates the rights and obligations of both parties, and its nature is more important than the customer's hobbies and customs for the required goods. How can we stick to the habit of the past and not consider the convenience of the customer? Moreover, based on the above reasons, our association believes that foreign insurance companies should use both Chinese and Western languages to record in detail the insurance policies and their accompanying articles and regulations used for Chinese policyholders to determine the relationship between the rights and obligations of both parties, so that policyholders can examine them at their leisure in advance, reduce disputes and controversies in the future, and help promote business and mutual harmony. Accordingly, we are writing to your association for your reference and hope that you will transfer the order and persuade the various insurance companies to comply." To the Joint Foreign Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request to Stop Jinan Military Medical Office from Forcibly Occupying Egg Factory</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, stating: "Respectfully addressed to the Nanjing Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters: On January 21st, a letter was received from the Shanghai Egg Factory Industry Association stating that Tongxinxiang Egg Factory, a member, reported receiving a telegram from Jinan stating that Dong Danlin, the director of the Jinan Military Medical Office, forcibly broke open the material building and took various items, and forcibly occupied the cooling warehouse. It was difficult to protect the drying room, and those who tried to protect it were tied up and beaten. They requested immediate assistance, etc. It has been found that the government has long issued clear orders prohibiting the military from occupying civilian houses. The medical office, relying on its power, is forcing and occupying civilian houses, which is already disregarding the law. Now, it is intensifying its efforts to forcibly take items and tie up and beat merchants, which is even more intolerable by law. Moreover, egg factories rely entirely on the spring season for production. With work about to start, if they are not quickly relocated, it will affect the factory's operations and the livelihoods of workers. We request that your department telegraph the government to order the garrison to strictly prohibit coercive behavior and move out by a specific date to uphold the law and maintain industry. Once we receive a detailed report from the factory regarding the material losses suffered due to this garrison, we will submit another request to the government to be responsible for compensation. The situation is urgent, and we implore you to investigate and handle it promptly to prevent the escalation of turmoil, etc. Based on this, it has been found that your department has repeatedly issued orders strictly prohibiting the military from occupying civilian houses. However, Dong Danlin, the director of the Jinan Military Medical Office, dared to use violence to seize the egg factory, forcibly take items, and tie up factory workers. This not only violates your order and tarnishes military discipline but also obstructs the egg factory at a time when it needs to ship goods, which is greatly contrary to the central government's aim of maintaining industry. Based on the aforementioned situation, we respectfully request that your department review and approve it, and order an investigation and prohibition, set a deadline for relocation, and hold them responsible for all losses incurred after the occupation to maintain military discipline and safeguard commerce for the public good. Respectfully, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, Ma."</p>

<h3>Red Cross Receives Disaster Report from Hua County Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society yesterday received a disaster report from Hua County, Henan, stating that Hua County is located in the war zone. The large armies of the third and fourth fronts pass through Xin Hua and other counties, which are the source of all their supplies. In a few months, they have dispatched vehicles and conscripted soldiers more than six or seven thousand times, and requisitioned silver and rice two or four times. The military special donation alone amounted to 270,000 yuan, which was assigned to the merchants and people by the corrupt County Magistrate Ge Cheng, who ordered them to pay the full amount within one month. Moreover, the fodder was extorted at a rate of 10,000 catties per day. When the people had no grain or grass, they were forced to pay in cash at a discounted price. The exploitation was unprecedented. Other expenses such as comfort fees, house number fees, shoes and socks fees, drug fees, and discounted fees for seized horses were imposed. The ingenuity of the names and the quantity of the expenses were unprecedented in Henan. The total amount of various requisitions and miscellaneous levies has reached 4,413,027 yuan. Hua County is a remote and desolate place, but it has been drained of its resources. The suffering is even more severe than in the war-torn counties. The police officers are urging for payment and issuing arrest warrants with great urgency. For several months, hundreds of people have been imprisoned. Weak village chiefs have died from being forced to pay. What crime have the good people committed to suffer such poisoning? Moreover, when defeated soldiers pass through, they leave nothing behind. Bandits rob and kidnap every night. Bandits and soldiers are more ferocious than tigers and wolves. The villages are in turmoil, and the people are unable to survive. Our compatriots are born at an unfortunate time and suffer extreme hardship. Gentlemen with compassion will surely feel sorrow upon hearing this and shed tears upon seeing it. They cannot stand idly by and ignore the plight. Although unification has been achieved, the requisitions and supplies have not been reduced. The people are extremely distressed, and the wounds are deep. Middle and lower-class families lack food and clothing. Only cunning people become bandits, and good people become beggars. Winter is approaching, and there are cries of sorrow everywhere. The elderly and weak are starving. Relief efforts require a large amount of funds. In addition to submitting a request to the National Government and the Disaster Relief Association for funds, we are now attaching a copy of the true situation and a donation booklet. We beg you to provide prompt assistance to save those in dire need. The Disaster Relief Branch of Hua County, Henan."</p>
<h3>Huang Chu Jiu's Posthumous Issues Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the Daily-Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department announced their liquidation, depositors were greatly alarmed and organized creditors' groups to actively pursue legal protection. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, several creditors gathered in front of Huang Chu Jiu's private residence, causing a slight dispute. After explanation, they gradually dispersed. The Chamber of Commerce paid attention. The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Huang Zhuo Jiu Aftermath Committee, stating that after the death of Mr. Huang Zhuo Jiu, the Daily-Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department, which he operated during his lifetime, were being liquidated by accountants appointed by your committee. At the 29th regular meeting of the Chamber of Commerce on the 22nd of this month, it was discussed that the depositors of the bank and the department were mostly accumulated from small sums of hard-earned money. Since hearing the news of the liquidation, both principal and interest have been temporarily suspended, and most of them are women and laborers, who are all disappointed and at a loss. It is truly pitiful. According to banking principles, the directors and key personnel should bear unlimited liability. The Chamber of Commerce decided that your committee should pay attention to the above two points during the liquidation process to ensure that depositors are fully protected. A copy of the case is sent to you for your information and action. Please reply. The Committee meeting. The Huang Chu Jiu Aftermath Committee, consisting of Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, Ye Shantao, Zhao Qinbo, and others, held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. They paid particular attention to the interests of small depositors of the Daily-Night Bank, etc., and decided to determine a method and handle it clearly in the shortest possible time, and formally issue an announcement to all sectors.</p>
<p>Yesterday, reliable sources reported that the deposits of the Daily-Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department were mostly accumulated from the hard-earned money of laborers and women, ranging from one yuan to several hundred yuan, which had a huge impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. Therefore, the committee plans to raise some cash in the near future to first pay off the small deposits of several hundred yuan or less, and then find a way to repay the larger deposits. According to those close to the Huang family, the rumors of Huang's embezzlement are not credible. It is estimated that his private assets are sufficient to repay all debts, but due to the inflexibility of cash flow, it is necessary to take some time to sort things out. In any case, creditors will not suffer any losses.</p>

<h3>Ten Robbers in Moon Palace Kidnapping Case, Six Robbery Cases, One Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Those kidnapped were Xi Lusheng, Zhang Zukang, the Zhang brothers, Lou Kenzai, etc.</p>
<p>Those whose kidnapping was intended but not completed were Chen Zhimei, Zhang Zuhuang, etc.</p>
<p>Wei Jinfu, Mao Yiwen, Sun Defu, Bao Shuji, Liu Yongxiang, Ding Yugao, Liu Junjie, Bian Zenghua, and other Chinese detectives from the Hongkou Patrol Station, successively apprehended ten men and women, including kidnappers Shi Jinde (aka A Gen, also known as Gengsheng), Xie Shusen (aka San Guangchang Amao), Li Wenbin (aka Li Meidi), Xie Atao, Chen Zhijian, Song Yaoming, Guo Aliu, Yu Xueshi, etc., from Room 19 of the Moon Palace Hotel on North Sichuan Road and other places, and confiscated three handguns, as well as bullets, passbooks, and other items. Upon investigation, it was learned that these people had committed six kidnapping cases and one robbery case. They were sent to the Special District Local Court, and were interrogated twice. Because public attendance was prohibited, no records were kept. Now that the period for public disclosure has arrived, the crimes committed by each criminal are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Xi Lusheng's tragic death. On December 6th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, at 12:30 PM, HSBC comprador Xi Lusheng was riding in a car to Yizhixiang Restaurant on Fuzhou Road to buy beef when he encountered robbers who kidnapped him. Xi tried to escape and was shot and killed by the robbers. Defendant Shi Jinde is involved in this case. After interrogation, Shi confessed without denial. Doctor Niu Huilin also appeared in court to testify, stating that he had treated Xi and the medical expenses were about a hundred yuan. Xi's chauffeur, Sun A'er, and bodyguard, Zhang Lanting, also testified to everything. Sun also identified Shi as being present at the scene.</p>
<p>(2) The preparation treasury was robbed. Defendants Xie Shusen, Li Wenbin, and Hua Guibao robbed 46,000 yuan of foreign currency from the four-bank preparation treasury in front of the Bank of Communications on the Bund, Fuzhou Road, on March 13th of last year. After interrogation, all defendants confessed. Xie claimed to have received 1,200 yuan of the loot, Li claimed to have received 1,600 yuan, and Hua claimed to have received 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Zukang was kidnapped. Defendant Li Wenbin kidnapped soy sauce king Zhang Zukang on Wuchang Road on February 19th of last year. After interrogation, Zhang Zukang stated that after he was kidnapped, he was transferred and hidden, intending to extort a huge sum of money. He was later detained in the warehouse of a Japanese yarn factory in Caojiadu. When the Chinese police raided the place to arrest gamblers, the kidnappers were startled and fled. He was rescued by the yarn factory workers and escaped. Defendant Li Wenbin also admitted to the accusation and led Chinese and Western detectives to the scene of the incident to demonstrate the kidnapping.</p>
<p>(4) The Zhang brothers were kidnapped. Defendants Shi Jinde and Chen Zhijian kidnapped Zhang Xinglian and Zhang Hualian, the two sons of Finance Vice Minister Zhang Shouyong, on Daxi Road on April 14th of last year. After interrogation, Shi confessed to participating in the kidnapping at the patrol station and led detectives to the kidnapping site to demonstrate the situation at the time. He also confessed that Chen Zhijian, a nurse at Guanghua University, had communicated beforehand (the Zhang Xinglian brothers were both students at Guanghua University). Afterwards, he received 21,000 yuan of foreign currency, of which 5,000 yuan was given to Chen Zhijian as a reward for his communication. 6,000 yuan was deposited in Zhejiang Siming Bank, and 10,000 yuan was deposited in Sincere Company. Chen Zhijian also confessed at the patrol station that he received 5,000 yuan, of which 1,000 yuan was deposited in HSBC under the name of Wang, 1,000 yuan was deposited in Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and 2,000 yuan was deposited with Zhang Shaolan. However, both defendants denied this in court, and the two plaintiffs were unable to identify them.</p>
<p>(5) Lou Kenzai was kidnapped. Defendant Li Wenbin kidnapped Lou Kenzai, the son of Lou Xunru, a giant in the money industry, at the gate of the Money Industry Public School at No. 382 Peng Road on November 4th of the year before last. After interrogation, the plaintiff and the chauffeur Li A'yu and Li Gengnan testified in court, but were unable to identify the defendant. Defendant Li Wenbin has already confessed. The above five cases were clearly interrogated during the previous two court sessions.</p>
<p>(6) Attempted kidnapping of Chen Zhimei. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the hearing was continued. Judge Feng Shide of the Special Court presided over the sixth criminal court. First, the sixth case was heard. Li Zhishan, the acting lawyer for the patrol station, stated that in this case, the defendants Shi Jinde, Xie Shusen, Li Wenbin, and Xie Atao attempted to kidnap Chen Zhimei, who lived at No. 735 Ankangli, Fair Road, and worked as a comprador for Welly Yanghang, on the morning of December 3rd of last year at 8:00 AM. Although the defendants had prepared, they had not yet carried out the kidnapping. The plaintiff is also present in court. Chen Zhimei testified that he was from Shanghai, Jiangsu, and was 45 years old. He worked as a comprador for Welly Yanghang. He did not know about the kidnapping attempt. Shi Jinde was questioned and stated that he went to Room 19 of the Moon Palace Hotel on that day to visit Xie Shusen and Li Wenbin, and was arrested. He knew nothing about the attempted kidnapping of Chen Zhimei. Xie Shusen stated that he came to Shanghai from Guangdong in August of last year and lived in Room 19 of the Moon Palace Hotel with Li Wenbin. Li had arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong before him. The attempted kidnapping of Chen Zhimei was initiated by Chen and Mao, who were at large. Chen claimed to have worked as a chauffeur for Chen Zhimei and knew that Chen was wealthy. Therefore, when they discussed it in the Moon Palace, Chen, Mao, Xie Atao, and Li Wenbin were all present. Because it was necessary to first identify Chen Zhimei's appearance and the route he took, he, Chen, and Mao took a tram to Youheng Road and got off. The three of them went ahead, and he waited there. Li Wenbin stated that he came to Shanghai from Guangdong in June with Xie Shusen and lived in Room 19 of the Moon Palace Hotel. Chen and Mao initiated the matter and went to take a photo (to recognize the face). However, he only knew that he was going to visit Mao's friend beforehand. Xie Atao stated that she was arrested while looking for Shi Jinde at the Moon Palace and knew nothing else.</p>
<p>(7) Attempted kidnapping of Zhang Zuhuang. The seventh case was then heard. Li Zhishan, the lawyer for the patrol station, stated that in this case, the defendants Xie Shusen, Li Wenbin, Guo Aliu, and Song Yaoming intended to kidnap Zhang Zuhuang, the cousin of soy sauce king Zhang Zukang, in mid-December of last year. Zhang lived at No. 5 Xiaoshadu Road and was only 18 years old. He was a student at the Gezhi Public School affiliated with the Shanghai Municipal Council at the intersection of Guangxi Road and Beihai Road. The defendants had taken photos with the intention of kidnapping. There is a record of the confession. Xie Shusen stated that the attempted kidnapping of Zhang Zuhuang was initiated by Chen Xianglin, who was at large, who said that Zhang was rich, but he did not go to take a photo. Li Wenbin also stated that Chen initiated the matter and that he and Chen had gone to Xiaoshadu Road to take a photo once. Guo Aliu and Song Yaoming's statements were evasive. Then, Fan Gang, the lawyer representing the defendants Yu Xueshi and witness Shi Xueshi, requested that the two be allowed to be released on bail pending further interrogation. Judge Feng Shide approved the two to be released on bail pending further notice, and the others were returned to custody to be heard again on the afternoon of January 29th.</p>
<p>The stolen goods found in Shi's house. After defendant Shi Jinde was arrested at the Moon Palace Hotel, the patrol station received a tip that Shi's family had a handbag that Shi's relative Yu Xueshi (Shi's wife's elder sister) had sent to Fahua Town to hide. The patrol station sent Chinese and Western detectives to Fahua Town to search, but they found nothing. They saw Yu Xueshi return home empty-handed. Later, it was reported that Yu Xueshi had deposited the handbag in a Westerner's house in the French Concession. They searched the house and found three handguns, twenty-seven bullets, a one-million-yuan passbook, a six-thousand-yuan deposit slip, a four-thousand-yuan passbook, a gold diamond ring, three gold rings, two gold lockets, and two gold chains inside a phonograph. A large number of silks and satins and leather clothes were also found in Shi's house. All of the above stolen goods are now in the patrol station. Shi also opened a Dadong Automobile Company in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shi's wife was arrested and her confession. After Shi Jinde was arrested, his wife Shi Xueshi fled in advance and could not be apprehended. About two weeks later, the patrol station learned that Shi Xueshi was hiding in the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Road and sent Chinese and Western detectives to arrest her. Shi Xueshi then led the detectives to the Ximen in the Nanshi to arrest her accomplice Song Yaoming (the tenth defendant). Shi Xueshi testified in court that when the kidnapping of Xi Lusheng occurred, she heard her husband Shi Jinde say that the matter had been discussed at the Shenzhou Hotel and the Jiangzhe Hotel beforehand. When the Zhang brothers were kidnapped, she heard that Chen Peter (Chen Zhijian, Chen was raised by American missionaries when he was young, so two American missionaries attended the court hearing several times. Chen studied medicine at Tongren Hospital and later practiced medicine in Changshu. After returning to Shanghai, he began to work as a nurse at the Guanghua University School Medical Office) had reported to her husband that the Zhang family was wealthy. So her husband discussed the matter with her, so in May, she suddenly saw her husband Shi Jinde return home with a large amount of banknotes. She asked her husband where he got so much money. Her husband said that it was the ransom for kidnapping the Zhang brothers and that he had to give Chen Peter four or five thousand yuan as a reward for his efforts. (It was heard that Zhang Shouyong paid a ransom of 140,000 yuan to release the Zhang brothers.)</p>
<p>The Xue sisters were allowed to be released on bail. The patrol station will not prosecute Yu Xueshi (Shi's wife's elder sister) and Shi Xueshi (Shi Jinde's wife) for the time being. Judge Feng Shide has now approved their release on bail pending further notice.</p>
<h3>Lee Kuo-liang Kidnapping Case: Masterminds Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Others Given Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lee Kuo-liang, a Yunnan native residing at No. 818, Tongchunfang, Zhejiang Road, Shanghai, owner of the Xingli Copper and Tin Company, was invaded by multiple robbers at 7:15 PM on November 28th last year. They looted his property and kidnapped Lee, demanding a large ransom. Subsequently, Hua Detective Yu A-gen, Wang Chang-gen, Detective Inspector Song Bing-zheng of the Old Zha Gate Police Station, and Ding Kuo-zhen of the Hua San Dao Gang, rescued Lee at No. 9, Fulu Li Road in the French Concession. The kidnappers, Xu Jia-jun, Li Shao-xuan (aka Yang Nan-xuan), Chen Zhen-zhi (aka Xia Ji-zhi), Zhuang Rui-bang, Zhou Zhi-wei, Yin Cheng-chang, Cheng Qing-shan, Dong Qi-de, Wei Hui-zhang, Zhang Kun, Shen Yong-fang, Zhu Yun-qing, Xu He-lin, the woman Yang Tang-shi, Cui Cheng-zhi, Yuan Gen-di, and sixteen others were arrested at locations including No. 128, Xin Xin Li, Jinshenfu Road. Two handguns and seven bullets were confiscated. The case was handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation, awaiting sentencing. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Zhou Han, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, delivered the verdict: Xu Jia-jun, Li Shao-xuan, Chen Zhen-zhi, Wei Hui-zhang, and Zhang Kun are each sentenced to death for the crime of jointly kidnapping for ransom. Zhuang Rui-bang, Zhou Zhi-wei, Yin Cheng-chang, Dong Qi-de, Shen Yong-fang, and Xu He-lin are each sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of jointly kidnapping for ransom. Cheng Qing-shan, Zhu Yun-qing, Yang Tang-shi, Cui Cheng-zhi, and Yuan Gen-di are found not guilty. The two handguns and seven bullets are confiscated. The police lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, declared an appeal regarding the acquittal of Cheng Qing-shan. Judge Zhou then ordered Cheng to be temporarily detained at the police station during the appeal period. He also summoned Yang Bao-qing, the husband of Yang Tang-shi, to the court, informing him that his wife had associated with the kidnapper Yin Cheng-chang but had been found not guilty by the court. He was instructed to take her back and strictly supervise her to prevent future offenses. Yang expressed gratitude and left.</p>
<h3>Lu Shao-tang Kidnapping Case: Continued Trial of Bandits</h3>
<p>Police Lawyer Adds Charges of Four Robbery Cases</p>
<p>Madam Feng Wang Still Considers Reputation</p>
<p>Wang Zhi-lang Accused of Obtaining Property by Fraud</p>
<p>Zhang Ai-qi and Shao Er-bao Granted Bail</p>
<p>Feng Mu-qing and twenty-five others were heavily implicated in the kidnapping of Lu Shao-tang, the comprador of the Fair Price Foreign Firm, for ransom, and the shooting of Lu's bodyguard, the Russian Madi Sdi. Chief Inspector Lu Lian-kui, Detective Inspector Liu Zhao-nian, Feng Zhi-ming, Wang Hong-sheng, Wu Han-zhang, and others from the General Investigation Department of the General Police Headquarters, apprehended the suspects, rescued Lu Shao-tang at No. 374, Hart Road, and confiscated three Mauser pistols, two handguns, and hundreds of bullets. The case was handed over to the Special District Court, which interrogated them for the third time in detail. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Han continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, stated, "Although this lawyer has already presented the details of the entire case last time, there are still omissions. I am supplementing them now. The police accuse all defendants of violating Article 2 of the Law for the Punishment of Bandits, but only Wang San-huai, Tian Chang-shan, and Hu Zhu-de are most important. The rest are suspects, but it is difficult to prove. The police further accuse Feng Mu-qing, Qian Shan-hai, Zhang Yun-kang, and He Zhi-sheng of violating Article 1 of the Regulations for the Prohibition of Military Firearms, because thirty-five bullets were found in Room 353 of the Oriental Hotel where they resided. One of the bullets was an unfired cartridge from the Mauser pistol used during the kidnapping of Lu, which has been certified by the Western gun examiner Rong Si at the Gordon Road Police Station. Sun Feng-zhu, Guan Jin-chen, Shuai Lei, the woman Shuai Wu-shi, Shuai Qing-hua, Shuai Qian-shi, and Liu Qian-shi are also accused of violating Article 1 of the Firearms Prohibition Law, because the police found a handgun and seventeen bullets in the house they resided in at No. 414, Lafayette Road. Furthermore, Zhang Yun-kang is also accused of armed robbery of properties at No. 413, Sichuan Road, No. 278, Yunnan Road, No. 75, Xin Zha Road, and No. 705, Chengdu Road. Zhang did not actually commit the robberies, but only provided firearms to the robbers and divided the loot. He should be interrogated." When questioned, Feng Mu-qing, Qian Shan-hai, and He Zhi-sheng admitted to visiting Room 353 of the Oriental Hotel and engaging in prostitution, but firmly denied that the bullets belonged to them. Zhang Yun-kang denied the four robbery cases accused by the police, only stating, "I previously lent a handgun to Zhang Zhong-da for robbery purposes. Zhang lost the gun and compensated me with thirty yuan. I don't know about the robbery." Feng Wang-shi testified, "I used to be a prostitute in a brothel in Fuxiang Li, and later married Jin De-kang. But before marrying Jin, I had a relationship with Feng Mu-qing. This time, I called myself Feng Wang-shi instead of Jin Wang-shi at the police station to save Jin's reputation." The police lawyer Ru immediately stated, "Jin De-kang has already sued Feng Mu-qing in your court for disrupting the family." Zhang Xian-ting testified, "I was detained because I was visiting a friend at Room 51 of the Da Dong Hotel. I don't know about the kidnapping." Lawyer Ru immediately stated that Room 51 of the Da Dong Hotel was the meeting place for the kidnapping plot. When Zhang was arrested, a piece of paper with the address of the ringleader of the case was found on him, so Zhang is actually related to this case. How can he claim ignorance? When questioned, the remaining defendants all denied the kidnapping and hiding of weapons, and none admitted to anything, so it is omitted here. The plaintiffs in the robbery cases, Yun Hui-shou and Wu Qian-shi, also filed charges, stating the circumstances of the robbery and claiming that none of the defendants present today robbed their homes. The police also presented a criminal, Zhang Zhong-da, who was arrested during the robbery of Wu Qian-shi's house on Chengdu Road and sentenced by the court. He suddenly overturned his previous testimony in court, claiming that the Zhang Sha-kang he testified about was not the one arrested fourteen years ago. When Zhang Zhong-da was brought to the court, he had confessed that Zhang Yun-kang had provided the handgun, so the police presented him as a witness. But Zhang overturned his previous testimony in court, claiming that the Zhang Yun-kang he testified about was not the person involved in the case. The Western detective testified that after Zhang Zhong-da was arrested, he immediately confessed that Zhang Yun-kang lived at No. 38, Hualun Road. The police immediately arrested Zhang, but he had already fled, only capturing his wife. At that time, a photo was found in his house, and his face was no different from the current Zhang Yun-kang. The photo was presented as evidence. The police lawyer Ru then stated that although the defendant Wang Zhi-lang has no charges in this case, he was previously accused of obtaining property by fraud, and your court sentenced him to one year in prison. Furthermore, someone is currently suing him in your court for fraud, etc. Judge Zhou Han reviewed the testimonies and adjourned the case for further hearing. Zhang Qing-qi and Shao Er-bao were granted bail of 500 yuan each, and the rest were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Dr. Tang's Case Against His Wife</h3>
<p>Preliminary Hearing Held Yesterday in Investigation Court</p>
<p>Tight Security, Lengthy Proceedings</p>
<p>Dr. Tang Hui-xuan, a Ph.D. in Economics, accused his wife, Zou Ai-zhen, of adultery with Chen Gen-wei in the District Court. Because the self-accusation regulations do not allow prosecution against relatives, the case was dismissed and transferred to the Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday at 2 PM, Prosecutor Wu Shi-xin, accompanied by a clerk and translator, opened the First Investigation Court for a preliminary hearing. The parties and witnesses who reported included Tang Hui-xuan, Zou Ai-zhen, Chen Gen-wei, Zou Yue-zhen, Zou Yu-shi, the foreigner Carlo Aksis, Chen Zhen-han, and patrol officer He Feng-lin, a total of nine people. Zhou A-mei and Tang Ai-si, who were also summoned, did not arrive. They were immediately interrogated separately. The proceedings lasted a long time, and only ended when the lights were lit. Security was very tight. The results will be announced after further questioning.</p>
<h3>Western Woman Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>A Tragic Love Story</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that Baroness Bi-tao-er, the female protagonist in a tragic love story among Westerners in this port, has committed suicide by poisoning. She died at the Hongen Hospital at 10:30 AM this morning (22nd). Her funeral arrangements are currently being handled by the Baron, who has entrusted the Wan Guo Funeral Parlor to take care of them. The Baron is a Luxembourg steel merchant who married the Baroness eight years ago. In 1929, he became the China representative of a steel factory and came to Shanghai with his wife. Later, Sir White, the former Speaker of the Indian Legislative Assembly, attended the Pacific International Academy Conference in Honolulu, and then came to Shanghai with his wife. They met the Baron and his wife, and the four became close friends, often visiting each other. They even traveled to Beijing together. At that time, the love between the Baron and his wife was the envy of Westerners in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, things went awry. On October 12th last year, after the Baroness broke up with her husband, she left home with White and traveled to Japan. At that time, White's wife had returned home earlier to send her son to school and was waiting for him in San Francisco, while White was accompanying the Baroness on a trip to Japan. Later, the Baroness repeatedly telegraphed her husband from Japan, hoping to restore their old relationship. Soon after, she returned to Shanghai with White, and White also repeatedly interceded on behalf of the Baroness. The Baron remained firm in his refusal. With the hope of reconciliation gone, the Baroness fell ill. She followed the doctor's advice and went to Japan with White again. On the 18th of this month, the two took the Nagasaki Maru back to Shanghai. As soon as the ship docked, a doctor was summoned, as the Baroness had taken a large dose of poison. She was then sent to Hongen Hospital, where she died this morning. She left behind three letters, one to her husband, one to White, and one to Arnold of Anli Foreign Firm. Arnold is one of the Baron's close friends, and the Baron works at Anli. The *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reporter visited the Baron and White this morning to inquire about the cause of the Baroness's death and the facts of the matter, but they both declined to answer.</p>
<h3>The First Case of the Special District Mediation Court</h3>
<p>Guo Biao Participates in Mediation</p>
<p>The Result Still Requires Litigation</p>
<p>*The New Shanghai Society* reports that the Civil Mediation Court of the Special District Court requires all civil cases to undergo mediation before litigation. Only if mediation fails can a lawsuit be filed. However, since the court was established almost a month ago, it was not until yesterday that a case was brought to the court requesting mediation. The mediators were Guo Biao, the director of the mint, and Dong Cheng-xi-qing and Zhu Lian-sheng. The case involved Tang Song-qing, who died of illness. His wife, Ni-shi, and mother, Fan-shi, claimed that Tang had deposited 2,300 yuan in the Yong An Company Silver Savings Department during his lifetime. Since Tang had passed away and funds were needed for the funeral, Tang's wife and mother applied to Yong An to withdraw Tang's savings. Fearing that they would not be able to withdraw the money without proof, they specifically had two lawyers, Lu Qi and Tang Ying-song, send a letter to verify the claim, and they had the Zheng Tai Xiang Foreign Goods Fabric Company as guarantor. However, Yong An Company firmly refused to pay, stating that if they wanted to withdraw the money, Tang Song-qing's personal signature and seal were required. Otherwise, they had to publish a statement in the *Shen Bao*, *Xin Wen*, and *Min Guo Ri Bao* newspapers for three days. If no one came forward to interfere after one month, they would be paid. Tang Ni-shi, needing funds urgently, could not wait long, so she filed a petition with the Mediation Court of the Special District Court, requesting mediation. Judge Pang Shu-rong opened the Mediation Court. Yong An Company appointed Guo Biao as the mediator, while Tang Ni-shi appointed Zhu Lian-sheng and Dong Cheng-xi-qing as the mediators. Because Guo insisted on requiring publication in the newspaper for one month and no opposition before payment, the meeting ended without results. It is reported that Tang Ni-shi has now officially hired the two lawyers Lu and Tang to file a lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Empty House Yields Nothing</h3>
<p>Victim Outsmarts Bandits</p>
<p>Zhou Jin-sheng, a resident of Huang Yong Zhai in northwestern Wusong, made his fortune selling kiln goods in Shanghai and had some assets. Last summer, Zhou closed his business and returned to his hometown with his family.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>He hired workers to build several new houses to live in, attracting the attention of bandits. At the end of the year, he received several threatening letters demanding large sums of money. Zhou initially ignored them. Until the morning of the day before yesterday, around 9 AM, Zhou's young son went out alone, intending to go to a nearby teahouse for tea. On the way, he encountered two men speaking with a northern accent, who passed him face to face. Zhou heard the two men seemingly discussing something, and they even mentioned Zhou's name. Zhou did not recognize either of the men, nor were they from the neighborhood. Zhou was shocked. He recalled the threatening letters he had received and concluded that these people were definitely not good. He became wary and turned back home, informing his entire family. All their silver, money, clothes, ornaments, and other valuables were packed into boxes. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, he sent someone to Shanghai to deposit them in a safe place. He also ordered his entire family to stay temporarily at the homes of relatives, locking up his house. Zhou himself stayed at a neighbor's house, arranging for nearby neighbors to be vigilant. Sure enough, as Zhou had expected, around 12 AM the night before last night, more than ten bandits speaking with a northern accent arrived at Zhou's house armed with weapons. They fired a shot, broke open the front door, and entered. Seeing that it was an empty house and hearing the sound of gongs, they knew that precautions had been taken. They did not dare to linger and fled east. After the bandits left, Zhou and his neighbors returned home to inspect and found no losses. But since he had been targeted by bandits, it would be extremely dangerous to live in his house in the future. Therefore, yesterday, his entire family moved to Wusong to stay temporarily.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Laborer Falls into River and Dies</h3>
<p>The Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Kasato Maru entered port yesterday, docking at the Hongkou Mail Steamship Wharf. At 3:30 PM, while the ship was unloading cargo, two laborers, Bai He-shang, a local, 26 years old, and Xiao Nan-sheng, a Cantonese, 27 years old, were sitting on an iron bar on the ship, playfully fighting each other. Unexpectedly, the iron bar they were sitting on broke, and the two fell into the river. After Bai He-shang fell into the water, he rose to the surface. A person on the ship hurriedly threw a rope and a life preserver to rescue him. Unexpectedly, Bai He-shang's feet were grabbed by Xiao Nan-sheng, causing him to sink twice. Both drowned. The workers and water patrol boats tried to salvage them, but it was too late. They had already drowned.</p>
<h3>Engineering Drawing Annotations: Foot Problem</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry Rejects Request</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in order to promote the new metric system, had previously announced last year that, starting this year, all technicians applying to the Bureau for any permits must use the metric system for all dimensions, area, and other measurements on the drawings submitted. Failure to comply would result in rejection. However, after the announcement, most engineers felt that the foot had been used for a long time, and it would be difficult to change overnight. And while standard new instruments were not yet widely available, contractors and foremen found it extremely difficult to estimate materials and construction. They requested the Bureau to temporarily allow annotations of equivalent foot measurements below the metric measurements for assistance. As this concerned legal regulations, it was necessary to request instructions from the relevant central authority on whether temporary accommodation could be made before a decision could be made. A request was submitted to the Municipal Government, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Industry for review. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry, after reviewing the request, believed that this accommodation might hinder the promotion of the metric system and did not approve it. The original text of the reply is copied below for reference: "Regarding the reply, the report from your office states that the Bureau of Public Works reported that since the Bureau announced to all architects and engineers that, starting January 1, 20th year, all applications to the Bureau for permits for engineering purposes must use the metric system for all measurements, area, and other dimensions on the drawings submitted, all architects and engineers felt that the foot had been used for a long time, and it would be difficult to change to the meter overnight. Contractors and foremen found it particularly difficult to estimate materials and construction. They repeatedly asked the Bureau whether it was possible to temporarily annotate the equivalent foot measurements below the metric measurements. The Bureau believed that this concerned legal regulations and did not dare to make a decision without authorization. Therefore, the situation was reported to request instructions, etc. Based on this, in addition to instructions, we await your ministry's review and reply before we issue further instructions. Upon review, Article 11 of the Law on Weights and Measures promulgated by the National Government stipulates that all matters relating to weights and measures, except for private sales and transactions, which may temporarily use the market system, shall use the metric system. Furthermore, the amended regulations of the Ministry of Interior on the application of scales for land surveying stipulate in Article 3 that the market system may be used for land surveying related to the property rights of the people. The government's promotion of the new system adopts an absolutely strict approach and must not be ambiguous in any way. If it is permitted to annotate equivalent foot measurements below the metric measurements, then the current scales of other countries and regions may also follow this example and annotate. The result will inevitably be a case of the tail wagging the dog, which will greatly hinder the promotion of the new system. The request cannot be approved. We hereby reply to the aforementioned request and request that you review and inform accordingly, etc."</p>
<h3>Approval of Condolences for Liu Rong-tai, Martyr of the Municipal Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Section Three Fire Brigade reported that its director, Liu Rong-tai, was fatally injured by the Shanghai-Nanjing Express train while setting out in a car on a snowy night to rescue people. They requested the Municipal Public Security Bureau to provide relief. Yesterday, the brigade received Directive No. 126 from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, stating, "The report and attachments have been noted. The standing committee member, Liu Rong-tai, was usually enthusiastic about brigade affairs. He encountered danger and died while on duty on a snowy night, showing courage and righteousness and sacrificing his life for his duty. We deeply mourn his loss. The Bureau shall approve the advance payment of 200 yuan for funeral expenses as assistance, and we will report to the Municipal Government for generous consideration and relief. Furthermore, his orphaned child, Liu Shao-ji, shall be sent to a municipal school for free education, to cultivate him and to honor the loyal and comfort the departed soul. After the incident occurred, the fifth district inspector, Gong Zheng, and the patrol chief of the Gonghe Xinlu Police Station, and the on-duty police officer mishandled the situation. They have been ordered to be dismissed and interrogated by the Bureau. As for the railway bureau, the facilities at important traffic locations are inadequate, and the signalman neglected his duties, causing this tragedy. Tracing the origin of the disaster, the fault lies with them. We shall immediately send a letter to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration to investigate and severely punish them, and to repair the gate at the railroad crossing as soon as possible to ensure safety.

<h3>Lu Li-hua's Case Against the Secretary: Civil Settlement</h3>
<p>Liu Xun-fang, the former secretary of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, was dismissed by the principal of the school, Lu Li-hua. He harbored resentment and sought to damage her reputation. He drafted a false accusation with Chen Hong-chang and others, using the name of a student's parent, Wang Xin-ming, and filed six charges with the Municipal Bureau of Education. Wang Xin-ming discovered this and immediately sent a letter to Principal Lu and the Municipal Bureau of Education to clarify the matter. Lu conducted a detailed investigation, seized the original manuscript, and verified the handwriting. She discovered that it was written by Liu Xun-fang. She gathered evidence and hired lawyer Xu Shi-chang to sue him in the District Court for defamation. The prosecutor's investigation confirmed the handwriting. In addition to issuing an arrest warrant for Chen Hong-chang, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution against Liu Xun-fang. Lu also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting the court to order Liu to pay for the damage to her reputation. The details were reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Ma opened the court for continued hearing. First, he asked the plaintiff, Lu Li-hua, about the civil lawsuit, whether there was a possibility of settlement. If she could be lenient, Liu Xun-fang would voluntarily publish a statement to restore the reputation of the school and the principal. Lu replied that the incident occurred among the staff of the school, which she deeply regretted. Because the school is a solemn educational institution of society, everyone should help its development. People in the intellectual class should not take such actions. Based on past destructive situations, the law should impose appropriate penalties to serve as a warning. Now that Li-hua is involved in education, she should focus on education. Regarding the private part of the lawsuit, she appreciates the judge's efforts to mediate. She hopes that the defendant can truly repent and not act impulsively or be used by others in the future. Then, she is willing to shorten the period for publishing the apology statement to five days. She requires it to be fulfilled according to the agreement within one week in accordance with the law. Please make a judgment on the public prosecution according to the law. Judge Ma then educated the defendant, saying that since the plaintiff has been generous, you should follow the shortened period to publish an apology statement to restore the reputation of the school and the principal. The defendant listened to the instructions and admitted it. After both parties' lawyers signed on behalf of them in court, the defendant's lawyer requested that the defendant be released on bail. Judge Ma said that the public prosecution had not yet been judged and should be handled after sentencing. The defendant was ordered to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Lights Went Out Last Night</h3>
<p>Caused by Damage to the Square Shed at the New Zha Gate Bridge</p>
<p>The lights in Zhabei's Hengfeng Road, Chang An Road, and other places suddenly went out completely last night after 10 PM. Important streets became dark areas. Kulun Road, Menggu Road, Wuzhen Road, Datong Road, Xinmin Road, and others were all affected. Shops closed early. According to the Water and Electricity Company, the lights went out because the electrical square shed inside the Fuxin Company at the New Zha Gate Bridge was damaged. After receiving the news, the company immediately sent workers to repair it. About twenty minutes later, part of the power was restored. When the lights went out, the directors of the Fourth District, Fourth District One Station, and Second Station of the Public Security Bureau instructed the police on duty to pay extra attention to maintaining public order.</p>
<h3>Pengpu Militia Captures Three Bandits</h3>
<p>Seizes a Handgun and Ten Bullets</p>
<p>Around 4 PM yesterday, Su Sheng, Wang Shi-fu, Lu Xing-chun, Chen Ji-ren and other detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau went to the Pengpu Militia Second Team in Qia Xing Li, Datong Road, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, to report that bandits robbed someone surnamed Bao in Baoxing Road today and that at 5 PM they would pass through the Pingjiang Bridge of your team. They requested the team to send people to assist in the arrest. After receiving the report, Team Leader Shangguan Rong immediately dispatched Squad Leader Shi Fu, leading team members Guo Xiao-ran, Jiang He-tang, Cui Xian-fu, and the detectives, all disguised, to wait at the destination. At 5:15 PM, three bandits were seen coming from the east. When they arrived at the entrance of the Pingjiang Bridge, the informant identified the last bandit, named Huang Dian-chen, as carrying a handgun and bullets. The team members pretended to be pedestrians and walked behind Huang. They then turned around and grabbed the bandit around the waist. The other two bandits, seeing the situation was not good, quickly tried to escape. The other detectives rushed out, and all three bandits were completely captured. A No. 00200 thirteen-shot handgun and ten bullets were found on Huang. They were all taken to the team, and the team leader interrogated them. Huang confessed that he was 24 years old and lived in Da Yang Bridge. The other two bandits were Fu Guo-xi, 29 years old, who lived in a thatched shed in Nanshan Road, Gonghe Xinlu, and Zhang Yang-zhi, 30 years old, who lived behind the Fengtai Silk Factory in Pengpu Xinqiao, all from Funing. The rest of their words were ambiguous. After the team reviewed the confession, because there have been many robberies in the Zhabei area recently, none of which have been solved, they ordered the three bandits, Huang Dian-chen, Fu Guo-xi, and Zhang Yang-zhi, along with the handgun and bullets, to be handed over to the detectives for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Breaking of a Kidnapping Case on the Songshan Maru</h3>
<p>The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's Amoy route Songshan Maru steamer docked at the Osaka Wharf in Lao Baidu, Pudong, at 11:00 AM yesterday. It turned out that two kidnappers, a man and a woman, had kidnapped two boys and were planning to take the ship to Shantou to sell them. Fortunately, they were discovered by the crew, who reported it to the Water Police Station by telephone. Detective Huang Songsheng was dispatched to arrest the four people, along with five pieces of luggage, and bring them to the police station. According to the interrogation by the police chief, the man's name was Jiang Jiashan, 32 years old, from Fujian. He firmly denied any kidnapping activity. According to the woman, surnamed Hu Lin, 35 years old, from Suzhou, one of the boys, Hu Yincai, 7 years old, from Suzhou, was bought by Jiang for 70 yuan. The other boy, Pu Asan, 6 years old, also from Suzhou, was bought by Jiang for 50 yuan. She said that she was entrusted to accompany them to Shantou for sale, and it was agreed that she would be paid 10 yuan for each child. The names and ages provided by the two boys matched. Jiang was undoubtedly guilty of selling children. The investigator Chen Shaoting from the relief association was notified, and detective Wu Rongsheng was ordered to escort the four people to the local court for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Unnamed Woman Dies Tragically from Coal Gas Poisoning</h3>
<p>An unnamed woman, about 24 or 25 years old, lived alone in a pavilion room in the remaining house of the Feng Zhao family at No. 4 Youyi Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession. The night before, she did not extinguish the coal briquette stove when she went to sleep, resulting in coal gas poisoning. It wasn't until the afternoon of the next day that the second landlord saw that she hadn't gotten up yet and still didn't suspect anything was wrong. So, around 3:00 PM, someone came to deliver a letter, knocked on the door but received no response. They pried open the door and went inside to check, and found that the woman had died. The second landlord reported it to the police, who ordered detectives to go to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy room to examine the body. Since there were no family members, the criminal section of the police station reported it to the French Court's Judge Zhu for an autopsy yesterday. It was determined that she died of poisoning. The court ordered photographs to be taken, and the hall provided a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>The Barbarity of Wu A'gen from Xixie</h3>
<p>Suspended by his master for theft</p>
<p>Repeatedly making things difficult for the introducer</p>
<p>Mrs. Nerbol, a Westerner residing at 205 Avenue Edward VII, wanted to hire a Chinese Xixie (butler) last year, so she asked her cook, Wang Zhenlin from Zhenjiang, to find one. Later, Dong Zhao, a woman from Yangzhou, asked Wang to recommend her relative, Wu A'gen, to husk rice. Wu got the job and received a monthly salary of 20 yuan. However, Wu had a habit of stealing. At the end of the year, Mrs. Nerbol discovered that items had been stolen and suspected Wu, so she immediately fired him. However, Wu denied it and suspected that Wang had deliberately manipulated things to cause him to lose his job. Suddenly, on the 8th of this month, he gathered a crowd and broke into Wang's house, beating him severely before fleeing. At 7:00 PM the night before, Dong Zhao went to Wang's residence again, demanding compensation of 40 yuan for two months' wages, as well as 46 yuan for entertaining expenses, and instructed Wang to go to her aunt Zhang Yu's place at No. 19 Ziyang Lane, Wuding Road, to talk, otherwise she would invite the Axe Gang to deal with him. After the woman left, Wang sought help from his employer, who reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Detective Yang Fusheng, accompanied by Wang, went to Ziyang Lane. Unexpectedly, Dong and Zhang grabbed and twisted Detective Yang, tearing his clothes. Wu A'gen then took the opportunity to escape. Detective Yang then arrested the two women and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the local court of the Special District. Judge Wu Tingqi conducted a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, requested a postponement to allow the arrest of Wu A'gen for further investigation. Judge Wu granted the request and ordered the two women to be detained for further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suspect in a Three-Year-Old Murder Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhang Genhan, a Jiangbei thug nicknamed "Pockmarked Lao Si," killed Gu Aquan from Wuxi with an iron weapon on Pingliang Road three years ago, on April 10th, and fled without a trace. For three years, it was impossible to investigate and arrest him. The day before yesterday, Chinese and Western detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station passed by Songpan Road on business and encountered the suspect, who they immediately arrested. Yesterday, he was sent to the local court of the Special District. The deceased's wife, Gu Chen, filed a case, proving that she was present when the defendant attacked. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he was now the leader of a group of laborers, and although his face was pockmarked, he was not called "Pockmarked Lao Si." He said that he had five brothers and he was the third. He claimed he did not know about Gu's death. He hired lawyer Jiang Yiping for his defense. The judge ordered the defendant to be detained for further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Autopsy on a Child Killed by a Public Bus</h3>
<p>Public bus No. 15024 of the Public Concession was traveling west on Huade Road in Hongkou the day before yesterday. Near Lan Road, several children were playing. One of them, Zhang Genbao, jumped into the road, and the driver, Chen Azhong, did not steer to avoid him, causing Zhang to be knocked down. He was seriously injured. Chen took the child to the hospital, but he died. The body was taken to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the local court of the Special District was requested to send prosecutor Guo Wei to conduct an autopsy. He took his seat and, according to the Western deputy police chief, the investigation found that the bus driver, Chen Azhong, was at fault, and the police station had filed a complaint against him. When questioned, Chen Azhong claimed that he had been driving for many years and had always been cautious, and had never caused an accident. This time, it was because the child was playing in the road and he was not paying attention. Although he tried to avoid him, the child still ran in front of the bus and he couldn't avoid him. The deceased's father, Zhang Qinggan, also filed a case, requesting justice. After verifying the statements, Guo determined that Zhang Genbao had died from a head injury caused by being hit by bus No. 15024. The driver, Chen Azhong, was suspected of negligence and should be detained and sent to the hospital for further investigation. The body was handed over to his father, Zhang Qinggan, for burial.</p>
