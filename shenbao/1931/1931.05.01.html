<h3>Sino-British-French Jurisdiction Negotiations</h3>
<p>Results of the Fourth Consultation</p>
<p>The Point of Contention Lies in the Hesitation Period for Jurisdiction in Four Areas</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>The result of the fourth Sino-British jurisdiction negotiation: regarding the three-year hesitation period for Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, the British still insist, while they have made concessions on the rest. The four points originally raised in the note of the British Ambassador Lampson were: (1) Regarding the issue of retrial, if one is dissatisfied with the judgment of the Chinese court, one can still request a retrial in the British court. (2) To first abolish civil jurisdiction and then gradually abolish criminal jurisdiction, which will be abandoned when the Chinese judicial spirit is fully complete. (3) The Chinese court must hire foreign advisors. (4) The withdrawal of cases in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou should be delayed, limited to the three-year validity of the agreement to recover the Mixed Court. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the case: (1) Appeals can be made to the higher-level Chinese courts for retrial. Appealing to the British court is tantamount to a higher-level court, which is difficult to approve. (2) Civil and criminal matters cannot be abolished at different times. (3) The Chinese court must hire foreign advisors; the word "must" should be changed to "may," so that Chinese people can also serve as advisors. (4) The hesitation areas in the four places are enough to invite various countries to follow suit. The hesitation explanation is equal to reservation, and this is especially difficult to admit. After the third meeting, the British Ambassador forwarded this to the British government and received a reply that concessions could be made on the first three points. However, on the fourth point, the British government believed that it was necessary to maintain it based on the previous Mixed Court agreement. The hesitation explanation is different from the extension. The British have already felt that there is no more room for concessions. At the fourth meeting a few days ago, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was still not satisfied with this, hoping that the entire hesitation period would not exist on paper. The British Ambassador forwarded this to the government again, but there has been no response. It is feared that the case may be delayed. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Regarding the Sino-British jurisdiction issue, the British Ambassador Lampson is still staying in Beijing awaiting instructions. On the French side, it is not yet certain whether it can be resolved before the National Assembly. Today, the Foreign Minister has not met with the British and French Ambassadors. Only related personnel from both sides have been in contact. On the American side, Minister Wu has received telegrams to Beijing in recent days, and it is generally possible to resolve the issue simultaneously with the United Kingdom. Moreover, the one point on which China and Britain have not yet agreed is indeed the issue of the reservation period for jurisdiction in the four places of Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. Today, someone asked the diplomatic authorities about this, and it was said that it was inconvenient to answer. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Portugal's Current Upheaval and the Students</h3>
<p>Portugal has long been a country with backward education. Around 1919, there were only 707 public primary schools, 32 secondary schools, and 3 universities. Some argued that the country's troubles stemmed from a lack of education among its citizens. Today, while Portugal's education has not made the rapid progress of other countries, it is vastly different from before. Yet, upheavals continue unabated. A nation lacking education is prone to internal strife, but an educated citizenry, with its advanced knowledge, can also easily incite political change. However, one leads to aimless movements, merely disrupting the moment, while the other leads to upward movements, serving as a catalyst for reform. According to a Reuters dispatch, the Spanish revolution and the Madeira rebellion have led some university students across Portugal to rise up against General Carmona's dictatorship. Demonstrations by students at the University of Porto resulted in one death and nineteen injuries. Seven Portuguese students were arrested on the Spanish border for carrying leaflets urging Portuguese students to revolt. Additionally, according to a Guomin News Agency dispatch, the people within Portugal, particularly in Lisbon and Porto, are in a state of great anxiety following student riots. It is clear that students are playing a significant role in the current Portuguese upheaval. However, this is not unique to Portugal. Since the rise of political thought, young students have eagerly participated in political changes in various countries. The recent series of revolutions in Central and South American countries have also involved significant student activity. However, the political movements of students in Central and South American countries began much earlier and do not originate from today.</p>

<p>Cairo Express Mishap</p>
<p>Three Cars Burned in High-Speed Transit</p>
<p>Forty-Six Dead and Forty-One Injured</p>
<h3>Reuters, Cairo, 29th</h3>
<p>The Cairo Express was traveling at full speed towards Alexandria today when a fire broke out midway. The wind fanned the flames, causing them to spread rapidly. The driver was unaware of the mishap in the passenger cars and continued to drive forward. Although passengers shouted loudly from the windows to stop, it was to no avail. Seeing the fire getting closer, passengers, fearing being burned to death, jumped from the train, mostly falling to their deaths. Finally, a railway signaler managed to alert the driver, who immediately applied the brakes, and the train stopped, but it was too late. It is now known that forty-one people have died and fifty have been seriously injured, many of whom have no hope of survival. Police arrived at the scene after receiving the alert and began rescue efforts. The driver was arrested on the spot. The fire started in a third-class car, and the cause is unknown. The day was a holiday, so the third-class cars were very crowded. Those who jumped from the train and did not die immediately were writhing on the ground, their arms and legs broken, in a pitiful state. Another telegram stated that the current death toll has been verified as forty-six, with forty-one injured.</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, Cairo, 29th</h3>
<p>The express train between Alexandria and Cairo had an accident in the place of Tantah, resulting in the loss of life of as many as 41 people, including 10 children. At the time, the fire was extremely fierce, causing three sections of the second-class carriage to be burned before the car could be stopped.</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, Cairo, 29th</h3>
<p>The Alexandria express train had an accident just before arriving at the Binha station. When it arrived at the station, a flag waver caught a glimpse and quickly signaled to stop the car. Three third-class cars had already been burned and 41 passengers were burned to death, including 10 children. Only one European, a Spanish woman, was killed. In addition, 36 people were burned and all were sent to the hospital for treatment. The cause of the fire is still unknown.</p>
<p>Meditation of Madeira War Has Failed</p>
<p>The Portuguese Government Denies That the Overall Situation Is Not Stable</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, Lisbon, 29th</h3>
<p>The mediation of the Madeira war by the priest of Funchal was ineffective because the Minister of the Navy, Mr. Kalila, insisted that the rebels must surrender unconditionally. The government forces have now begun to continue their attacks, but the positions of both sides have made little progress. The area of Funchal has not yet been bombarded, and Mr. Kalila has notified that if the rebels insist on not surrendering, the area of Funchal will be bombarded. In Portugal itself, after the student riots in Lisbon and Porto, the people are very apprehensive, and the city of Lisbon has a fortress-like appearance. The patrol of soldiers and the installation of machine guns everywhere are enough to make people feel uneasy.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Lisbon, 29th</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, there has been no war on Madeira Island so far, because the bishop of Funchal is running around in an attempt to reconcile the parties. The revolution in Spain and the rebellion in Madeira have caused some university students in Portugal to rise up against General Carmona's dictatorship. Demonstrating medical students at the University of Porto have now been driven out by the police. One student died and nineteen were injured. Seven Portuguese students were arrested on the Spanish border today because they were carrying leaflets advising Portuguese students to revolt. The Portuguese government denies that the overall situation is not stable, but said that there are now 10,000 soldiers gathered in key points to maintain order if necessary.</p>
<p>British Merchants Trade with India</p>
<p>Eliminate Discrimination Against Indians</p>
<p>Lancashire Delegation Petitions</p>
<p>The Conservative Party Decides to Help</p>
<h3>Reuters, London, 29th</h3>
<p>Sixty Conservative members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords met with a delegation from Lancashire in the House of Commons today to discuss the Indian cotton industry. The delegation asked the Conservative Party for assistance because the British and Indian governments have failed to protect the cotton industry. A representative of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce stated that India is rejecting British goods and that if the government does not deal with the Indian boycott and import tax, then the trade in British textiles to India will definitely cease to exist forever. The Conservative Party announced a letter from party leader Baldwin, stating that the party is willing to do its best to assist British merchants, and advocates that, no matter how the Indian issue is resolved, there must be a fundamental provision to prohibit discrimination against British trade. The Conservative Party stated to the delegation that it will give sympathy and assistance. The delegation then went to see the Liberal Party members and stated everything. The Liberal Party also expressed great attention. In the House of Commons, Labor Party Gan Weishi mentioned the delegation's petition and also regretted the Indian boycott, saying that if we participate in the Round Table Conference, there must be an understanding that India allows free trade. The Lancashire delegation has also appointed four members of Parliament from Lancashire (two from the Labor Party, one each from the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party) to meet with the Secretary of State for India to discuss this matter.</p>
<h3>Reuters, London, 29th</h3>
<p>Lord Snell, Undersecretary of State for India, said in the Upper House today on the impact of the Irwin-Gandhi Agreement on trade that it is too early to say what impact this agreement has on trade. Although difficulties have indeed occurred, there is no reason to determine that the Indians have violated their responsibilities regarding the rejection of British goods. The Indian government is currently considering the difficulties that have arisen. He knows that the open propaganda of boycotts as a political tool has stopped, but the efforts to persuade Indians not to use foreign cloth have not stopped. The Indian government has learned that the sales of foreign cloth have increased and that the bottom is gradually being cleared. There is indeed hope for peace in India. Although there are still many difficulties in the future, the British government does not see any reason for pessimism in the current situation.</p>

<h3>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 29th</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Laval and the Chief of the Paris Police Department, Chabot, have now decided to prohibit all public demonstrations and parades on May 1st, Labor Day. If anyone disobeys the police's prohibition or interferes with the work of various factories, the authorities will not hesitate to use force to forcibly suppress them. All sectors of society are quite surprised by this and do not understand why the authorities have taken such severe measures.</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, Madrid, 29th</h3>
<p>The government has issued an order declaring May 1st a national holiday. Railways and postal services will also be closed on this day.

<h3>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 30th</h3>
<p>As usual, the 12th Labor Day anniversary is approaching tomorrow. It is expected that up to 15,000 people will participate. Because the left-wing faction of the National Council and the right-wing group of the Social Democratic system have long been in opposition, it is expected that there will be considerable disturbances. The Metropolitan Police Department has mobilized 4,000 police officers to severely guard the actions of the National Council.</p>
<p>World Recession Due to Uneven Distribution of Gold</p>
<p>Speech by Mr. Luther of Germany</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 29th</h3>
<p>Today, the Governor of the German National Bank, Mr. Luther, gave a long speech at the shareholders' meeting. Mr. Luther said that today's world recession is caused by the uneven distribution of gold among the countries of the world. Germany's reparations and the Allied countries' war debts are the main reasons for disrupting the world's economic stability. Mr. Luther said that France is the richest country in the world today. France's gold reserves, calculated by population, are 214 marks per person. The United States is second, with 161 marks per person. The average gold reserve per person in the United Kingdom is 66 marks, while Germans have only 36 marks per person. Therefore, if we want to restore the prosperity of the world today, we must return the gold reserves of various countries to the market. Germany has a long period of reparations, and the country's financial resources are now almost exhausted. Due to political and other relations, all assets cannot be made in Germany. The gold circulating around the world has lost its effect of infusion and circulation. The harm is not only to the countries lacking gold, but also to the countries holding gold. Today, if we want to save this problem, we must start from the political aspect, that is, the debt problem must be re-ordered.</p>

<p>Three Major Reorganization Policies of the Japanese Minsei Party</p>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs Plans to Reform the Local System</p>
<h3>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 30th</h3>
<p>The three major reorganization plans of the Minsei Party are gradually becoming concrete. Its scope is extremely broad.

<h3>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 30th</h3>
<p>Although the ruble issue has been resolved, the Shinano Maru issue, which was not reported before fishing, remains unresolved. The Japanese-Russian Fisheries Company is feeling quite difficult. When the ruble issue was resolved, the company asked the Soviet ambassador to send a telegram to check the certificate, but the embassy insisted on not allowing it and requested that the Shinano Maru be returned to Hakodate. However, the Shinano Maru can arrive in West Kamchatka this morning. If it is returned again, not only will the fishing news be missed, but the company will also suffer huge losses. At present, a compromise is being sought, but the Russian attitude is quite tough.</p>

It has been completely proven that capital countries and social countries can coexist hand in hand.</p>

<h3>Reuters, London Telegram, 29th</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Henderson stated in the House of Commons today that France had responded to the matter of the Franco-Italian naval agreement, and Britain had replied.

The French government wants to increase the number of cruisers and destroyers between 1933 and 1936 to replace old warships to maintain its advantage over Italy, but the Italian government believes that there should be no additions during this period.</p>

<h3>Bandits Are Being Searched for and Suppressed at Baodu Mountain</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The large-scale bandit suppression in southern Shandong is proceeding smoothly. After clearing Meng Mountain, the main force moved to suppress the bandits at Baodu Mountain. Fierce battles have been ongoing for days, but the bandits are elusive, often using small groups to harass and attempt to break through. The bandit suppression army is closely guarding and searching forward. The latest telegram from the General Headquarters' Teng County Staff Office is recorded below: "According to Director Liu Shuxiangyou's telegram: 1. I have received your telegram and have instructed all units at the front to be extra careful and work hard, and to report back frequently. 2. According to Division Commander Chen Jingwei's telegram: (A) I have discovered about 300-400 bandits fleeing from the northwest at the southern end of Fang Mountain, and they are currently engaged in fierce fighting. More than 40 cavalry bandits fled from the eastern mountain range of Shangdong Village, and were met with a head-on attack. The bandits routed to the northwest. This group is one of the defeated units of Ma Brigade. (B) I discovered two bandits hiding in Lotus Cave, who have been killed and two guns have been seized. (C) More than 20 bandits were found in Ma Temple, occupying the village. Troops were sent to suppress them. In addition to those burned to death, 19 bandits were killed, including Yao Er, nicknamed 'Second Flag Pole', who is the second-in-command of Zhang Heilian. In this battle, 15 guns were seized. Our side suffered three soldiers killed and one officer and six soldiers wounded, etc. 3. The armored vehicle has arrived in Teng County to transport the wounded and killed officers and soldiers. Ma Brigade also sent three wounded soldiers last night, each of whom has been rewarded with ten yuan. One severely wounded soldier sent the day before died this morning. A coffin has been prepared and temporarily stored. When more are transported from the front, they will be transported to Jinan together. Respectfully reported." (28th)</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Loss of Books from the Haiyuan Pavilion</h3>
<p>It is said that all the rare Song and Yuan editions were taken away by bandits.</p>
<p>Most of what remains are Qing and Ming editions and handwritten copies.</p>
<p>Ancient calligraphy was in dozens of boxes, all destroyed by rain.</p>
<p>Liaocheng Correspondence: In the late Ming Dynasty, Mao Zijin of Changshu had a passion for books, collecting up to 48,000 volumes. He reprinted the classics and histories, philosophical works, and literary collections, which circulated throughout the country, and published fifteen collections of the Jinjin Miscellany, all old editions from before the Song and Yuan Dynasties. He built the Jigu Pavilion to store them. The ability of Chinese secret books to spread to the world is due to Mao's reprinting. However, most of the collected copies have been sold. The Tianyi Pavilion of Fan Qin in Yin County also had a rich collection, but it was neglected in the late Qing Dynasty, and it gradually disappeared. Today, less than one-tenth remains. Xiang Molin's Tianlai Pavilion of calligraphy and paintings, which collected the best of the three Wu regions, was completely lost in the early Qing Dynasty. Among the precious books, calligraphy, and antiques preserved to modern times, only the Yang family of Liaocheng remained.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Haiyuan Pavilion</h3>
<p>Yang's name was Yizeng, posthumously named Duanqin. He was an official who rose to become the Governor-General of the Two Lakes River Conservancy in the Qing Dynasty. He was famous for his love of books at the time. He formed a literary friendship with Bao Shichen of Jing County and hired Bao as a member of his staff. He collected hundreds of thousands of volumes of books, as well as a wealth of calligraphy, paintings, and antiques. These were all appraised by Shichen and Yizeng. He built twelve rooms for the Haiyuan Pavilion, storing the fine Song and Yuan editions upstairs, and the imitations of Song and Yuan, Ming editions, early Qing editions, palace editions, and handwritten copies downstairs...Calligraphy, paintings, and antiques were stored separately in the backyard of the Haiyuan Pavilion in five storage rooms. His son, Shaohe, wrote the "Occasional Records of楹書", and also published the "Haiyuan Pavilion Series." Jiang Biao wrote the "Catalog of Song and Yuan Books," and Bi Heng wrote the "Haiyuan Pavilion Literary Collection," which was truly a flourishing time. It was passed down to his grandson, Baoyi. Because he lacked an heir, Yang Jingfu was adopted as his successor. Over the past ten years, disturbances have followed one another. Jingfu moved to Tianjin, leaving two concubines to manage the household affairs. When the great bandit Wang Guanjun first captured the city, the Haiyuan Pavilion was fortunately spared. The second time, Qian Jinzi led his troops to occupy the Yang residence. Most of the calligraphy, paintings, and albums downstairs were lost. More than two hundred ancient inkstones with inscriptions by famous people, describing the inkstones' lineage, which could be rubbed into four thick albums, were all lost along with the rubbings. At that time, Qian Jinzi was negotiating surrender and took special care of Yang's collection, strictly ordering the bandits not to enter the study without permission, so the loss was minimal.</p>
<h3>Rare Editions Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>After the bandits left, the county government, public security bureau, education bureau, and construction bureau jointly inspected and verified the items, and sent a list to Tianjin, notifying Yang Jingfu. Not long after, He Siyuan, the Director of Education, sent Wang Xiantang to inspect and register the items, and added seals to them, intending to take them into government custody. At that time, Yang Jingfu had not received news of the Education Bureau's measures. He thought that the bandits had already left and did not pay attention. His second and third concubines fled before the bandits arrived, suffering great losses. After the bandits left, they immediately returned to Liaocheng from Jinan. In the spring of the nineteenth year, the bandits' power revived. Jingfu's concubines, wanting to preserve the family property, were unwilling to leave. When the bandits entered the city, they were caught off guard and eventually disguised themselves and fled to Jinan empty-handed. The Haiyuan Pavilion was still occupied by Qian Jinzi, who reissued the ban, prohibiting anyone from touching the collection without permission. Many bandits resented Qian Jinzi's strict control and assassinated him. Because the bandits thought Qian Jinzi valued waste paper, they vented their anger by throwing books everywhere. The imitations of Song and Yuan, Ming editions, early Qing editions, palace editions, and handwritten copies downstairs were burned, torn, used to wipe utensils, and made into pillows... everything was replaced with books. There were few antiques and porcelains left. More than a thousand pieces of rosewood frames and glass covers, with various shapes, which had decorated precious artifacts, were piled up in the courtyard. In the storage room behind the pavilion, the calligraphy and paintings were stacked several feet high. Because of a month of continuous rain, the roof collapsed, and the calligraphy and paintings turned into black mud, with not a single complete character.</p>
<h3>The Loss of Unique Copies</h3>
<p>At that time, Wang Guanjun's headquarters was located in the county government, and he agreed with the county magistrate, Wang Kechang (from Tianjin), to loot the fine Song and Yuan editions. Wang Kechang identified and appraised the books, and the fine editions upstairs were packed into eight large wooden boxes and carried into the county government. Wang Kechang obtained some rare items, and the rest belonged to Wang Guanjun. Later, Wang Guanjun committed suicide after being wounded in battle, and it is unknown to whom his books fell. After Wang Guanjun's death, Xue Chuanfeng and Wang Jinfa each took charge of his bandit gang once, and it is suspected that they were obtained by Xue and Wang. Afterwards, Yang Jingfu sent his steward, Deng Huating, to inspect and collect the books. It was estimated that seven-tenths of the classics, four-tenths of the histories, four-tenths of the philosophical works, and three-tenths of the collections were lost. The Song and Yuan editions were completely lost. The unique Korean editions of books on phonology were the most valuable. What remained were imitations of Song and Yuan, Ming, and Qing editions, handwritten copies, etc., which were mostly incomplete, and were packed into seven large carts and transported to Jinan. Twenty boxes of ancient inkstones were lost in the backyard, leaving not a single one. Forty-three boxes of calligraphy and paintings, except for those that were looted, were all destroyed by the rain. Forty boxes of Kangxi, Qianlong, and Daoguang porcelain were completely lost. Twenty-four jars of Shaoxing wine made during the Kangxi and Daoguang periods were all drunk by the bandits, and the empty jars were used as chamber pots, worth more than 4,000 yuan. The wooden furniture was completely destroyed. The floor tiles in each room were broken, and the ground was dug more than ten feet deep. The plaque of "Haiyuan Pavilion," with several lines of inscription by Yang Yizeng at the end, was taken down by the bandits, and its whereabouts are still unknown. Afterwards, any photographs taken by outsiders with the plaque of "Haiyuan Pavilion" are fakes. It is said that the Shanghai Commercial Press had contacted to print and copy the books, and the conditions were divided into two types: Yang would receive 40% of the sales price of the valuable editions, and the Commercial Press would receive 60%. The remaining editions would be divided on a 30/70 basis. However, the negotiations stopped and did not materialize.</p>
<h3>Unfounded Sale to Foreigners</h3>
<p>When the collection had not yet been transported to Jinan, Ma Hongkui's Eighth Division increased its defense of Liaocheng, resulting in considerable losses. After the Eighth Division left, the headquarters of the Eighty-seventh Brigade moved into the Haiyuan Pavilion and used part of the 17-foot-long and 1.5-foot-wide stage panels that were left behind to make car seats, wooden horses, city-running bridges, and overhead bridge架板 and other gymnastic equipment. A certain resident military officer also selected many fine editions. Yang Jingfu heard the news and sent his steward to collect them and transport them to Jinan, which attracted public attention. Some said that Yang intended to sell them to foreigners, while others said that the provincial authorities were in contact with Yang to donate them to the public for a price of one million yuan. However, according to Yang's steward, Yang Jingfu still has 80 hectares of fertile land, and together with other businesses, can earn 20,000 yuan a year. Why would he sell the heirlooms of his ancestors? As for the provincial authorities contacting Yang, that is even more unfounded. Yang Jingfu has not met with the provincial authorities, nor has he exchanged a single word with them. It is thought to be a propaganda tactic. However, there is no smoke without fire, and there may be a reason. What the facts are will soon be seen. (April 18)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Port Authority Measures the Harbor</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Li Yucheng, Director of the Qingdao Port Authority, believes that Qingdao's commerce is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the ships coming and going are like weaving, but the nautical chart is still the old chart surveyed and drawn during the Japanese occupation. The depth of the waterways and the situation of the harbor have changed. The newly discovered reefs and added signs have not been included. This is not a cautious way to manage the port and protect navigation. Last winter, he submitted a request to the municipal government to request the Northeast Naval Command to transfer the Naval Hydrographic Survey Team to Qingdao for detailed surveying and drawing of a new chart. Last month, the Naval Command sent eight experienced surveyors to Qingdao, along with three surveying workers and various instruments. The Port Authority has assigned staff to work together, first going to each port area for detailed inspection, and allocating several large and small steam boats and sampans for use. All surveying points have been determined, and signal flags have been set up on the coast and mountain tops of the city as angular targets. It is heard that the area to be measured is divided into four parts: Dachan Island Port, Xiaochan Island Port, Inner Harbor, and Outer Harbor. The Outer Harbor is about 17 nautical miles from east to west and about 8 nautical miles from north to south. The Dachan Island Port, Xiaochan Island Port, and Inner Harbor are about 4 nautical miles in total length from east to west and about 6 nautical miles in width from north to south. The scope is quite large. According to the planned schedule, they will start from the Outer Harbor and gradually extend to the Inner Harbor. It is estimated that the entire project will take six months to complete. However, Qingdao has thick fog in summer, making surveying difficult. It is difficult to predict whether it will be completed on time. (April 27)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Silver Shops Discriminate Against Central Banknotes</h3>
<p>Due to Opposition to the Financial Bureau's Measures to Suppress the Silver Industry</p>
<p>Resisting Central Banknotes in Exchange and Remittance</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Finance Bureau promulgated measures to suppress the silver industry, a gap has arisen between silver shops and government offices. Later, the Silver Industry Association petitioned the Finance Bureau to postpone the implementation of the suppression measures, but it was not approved. Silver merchants then had a tacit understanding to passively resist Central banknotes. On the 22nd of this month, a rumor circulated in the market that the Central banknotes would be discounted by four yuan per thousand yuan that day. By the 23rd, it would be discounted by almost ten yuan per thousand yuan. Silver shops throughout the city all held a discriminatory attitude towards Central banknotes and deliberately raised the value of Hong Kong banknotes. According to the market situation on the 22nd, it cost 306 yuan more per thousand yuan to exchange silver dollars for Hong Kong dollars upon entry, and 308 yuan more per thousand yuan upon exit. However, it cost 320 yuan more per thousand yuan to exchange Central banknotes for Hong Kong dollars. Thus, the price of Central banknotes compared to silver dollars for exchanging Hong Kong dollars was already discounted by more than ten yuan per thousand yuan. By the 23rd, some silver shops dared to discriminate against Central banknotes and were unwilling to use them. For buying and selling foreign banknotes, they used silver dollars as the standard. In the past, when Central banknotes and silver dollars were at par, one yuan of Central banknotes could be exchanged for 170 copper coins, but recently it could only be exchanged for 160 coins. The above is the general situation of silver exchange shops resisting Central banknotes and passively dealing with the government. As for the remittance silver shops, it is said that they have also joined in the effort. Since the 22nd, they have stopped accepting Central banknotes for remittance to various ports. On the 24th, all merchants in the city who took Central banknotes to silver shops for remittance were refused. As a result, remittance to the east, west, and north of the three rivers suddenly became difficult. If silver dollars were taken for remittance, the silver shops were happy to accept them. Since the silver shops did not accept Central banknotes for remittance to various places, and the exchange shops indirectly deliberately discounted them, this had a significant impact. Therefore, there was inevitably a run on the Central Bank in recent days. Fortunately, the people involved in this run were all from silver shops, and ordinary people did not participate. Shops in the market continued to use the banknotes at full value for transactions, so the turmoil subsided later. On the afternoon of the 22nd, there were slightly more people holding banknotes for redemption in front of the Central Bank. On the 23rd, there were fewer and fewer, with only 30 to 40 people coming to redeem each time. In order to prevent the masses from being disturbed by troublemakers, the authorities issued a joint announcement on the 24th by Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, to inform the citizens not to believe the rumors of speculative merchants, lest they suffer losses.

<h3>The Tragic Situation of the Gan River Flood</h3>
<p>He Yingqin Initiates Flood Relief Association</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since Grain Rain, the province has experienced continuous rain, day and night. In recent days, mountain torrents have erupted and rivers have overflowed, especially the Gan River, where the water has risen the fastest. Because the river flows from south to north, with a length of more than 2,000 li, the tributaries are numerous, and the amount of water must also increase sharply. Residents along the Gan River have built dikes to prevent floods, but because the water was too strong this time, the dikes were washed away and many breaches occurred. The Dayou Dike and Fish Tail Sluice in Nanchang County, and the Da Dike, Zhoukou Dike, Yaochao Dike, and Xibao Dike in Xiwen collapsed one after another on the 23rd and 25th, dozens of feet long. The Duan Village near the Fish Tail Sluice was washed away. Wumentangtou in Zhoukou Dike, where residents' houses were washed away, and the dozens of li within the dike turned into a swamp. Because the victims have no homes to return to, many are sleeping in the mountains or on the hills, which is unbearable to see. Although it has cleared up in the past two days, the water level is still rising. Low-lying areas outside Nanchang City, such as the Sesame Fields, are a vast expanse of water. The water in the East Lake in the city has risen several feet sharply, and the water in places such as Gaoqiao is knee-deep, cutting off traffic. Minister He Yingqin personally went to Heqian outside Zhangjiang Gate yesterday to inspect and saw the flooding, which caused a major disaster. After returning to the camp, he initiated the Jiangxi Flood Relief Association. At the same time, he sent an adjutant to the Nanchang Chamber of Commerce to gather business leaders such as Lu Fuchuang and Zeng Jinshan to discuss emergency relief measures. It is heard that the business leaders have started raising funds and preparing to distribute them to the nearby victims for relief. (April 29)</p>
<h3>The Twists and Turns of the Harbin Shipping Industry's Grand Union</h3>
<p>Merchants and People Along the River Express Opposition</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Telegrams the Province Requesting Dissolution</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Harbin Shipping Industry's Grand Union has just been successfully concluded, and it is also the time when the Songhua River is thawing and navigation is beginning. However, merchants and people along the river unanimously oppose the bureau's combination of large forces, increasing prices, and monopolizing the market, and jointly request the authorities to restore free navigation. They have declared a strike to show their resistance. The Binjiang City Chamber of Commerce is afraid that if this stalemate continues, it will not only affect the shipping industry, but also affect the Harbin market. It has telegraphed Chairman Zhang of Jilin, requesting the dissolution of the Shipping Union Bureau to save the situation. The Shipping Bureau has also telegraphed the Liaoning, Jilin, and Harbin authorities, strongly explaining its position and expressing dissatisfaction with the Chamber of Commerce's actions. Each side holds its own view and attacks the other. It is heard that the Jilin Provincial Government believes that the bureau was established with the approval of the Northeast Transportation Committee, and how to deal with it should be decided by Liaoning. This matter may be difficult to resolve for a while. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Binjiang City Chamber of Commerce Telegram</h3>
<p>The Harbin Government-Business Shipping United Bureau, with a combination of large forces, monopolizes shipping rights and has aroused the reaction of merchants and people along the river, resisting by not transporting goods and not loading grain. The Harbin market relies entirely on transactions with various places along the river. Only when goods go out and grain comes in can business be done. Now, due to the impact of the Shipping Union's actions, goods are not going out and grain is not coming in, business throughout the city has come to a standstill, and people are panicking. The situation is dangerous and pressing. I hereby telegraphically request that you order the dissolution of the Government-Business Shipping United Bureau and restore free navigation and business in order to save the market and calm the people. The Binjiang City Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits.</p>
<h3>Shipping United Bureau Telegram</h3>
<p>It is noted that the overall union of Harbin shipping is purely to consolidate shipping rights externally and maintain shipping regulations internally. It has declared that it will never increase freight rates, and has determined shipping schedules and expanded shipping routes in order to facilitate transportation and develop agriculture and commerce. There is absolutely no monopoly or control. This has been reported and filed, and Chinese and foreign merchants have unanimously agreed. However, a small number of merchants along the river, because there were previously many ships and few goods, used their goods to manipulate the shipping merchants, demanding commissions and various improper profits. This shipping union makes it inconvenient for each person to pursue personal gain. Also, because the market is tight, there are no goods to sell on credit, and the price of grain is low, there is no profit in purchasing and transporting it. Therefore, they incited the Chamber of Commerce to exaggerate the situation, with no reason. The shipping industry reduced freight rates to 85% last year, and maintains the original price this year, without increasing them. How can there be any talk of monopoly? If the merchants can point out the facts that the bureau is monopolizing and controlling the market, and that it is inconvenient for commerce, the bureau will take responsibility. The bureau is a legally established organization that has been approved and registered, and it is impossible to make slight changes due to the incitement of a few people seeking to profit from it, which would endanger national shipping rights and river transportation.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>In addition to distributing telegrams separately, this telegram is specially submitted. I humbly request your support, and I am deeply grateful. Wang Shuncun, Deputy Director of the Harbin Government-Business Shipping General United Bureau, and 57 shipping merchants respectfully submit.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Seaport Development in Haizhou in a Few Months</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways Sends Personnel to Haizhou to Inspect the Situation</p>
<p>Xuzhou Communication: Regarding the opening of a seaport in Haizhou, the Ministry of Railways dispatched technician Lin Rongxiang and Construction Committee member Chen Maojie, along with German engineer He Mude from Siemens, to Xuzhou. They met with Qian Zongze, director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, and proceeded to Haizhou for on-site inspections. Zhang Jian, director of the Eastern Section Engineering Office of the Longhai Railway, He Xianhua, head of the engineering section, and Dong Yaotang, head of the traffic department, accompanied them. Qian and the others departed by train at 26:00 in the morning, arriving in Xinpu that afternoon. After disembarking, they immediately inspected the Fengpu Steamer. Subsequently, they sailed to Dapu to inspect the Linhong River and visited the station pier. The 27th was hampered by rain, preventing inspections. On the morning of the 28th, they traveled by car to Xugou for inspection, then turned to Laoyao to observe the terrain of Xilian Island from afar. In the afternoon, they returned to Xinpu and stayed at the Zhongxing Branch Factory. According to the heads of various departments who accompanied the inspection, the location for the seaport development is excellent. If construction is completed, it is predicted that it could surpass the ports of Qingdao, Shantou, and Xiamen. Geographically, from Dapu, traveling east around the mountains for about fifty li, one reaches Xugou. Xugou is a coastal area with the coastline slanting southeastward, passing Sunjia Mountain and reaching Laoyao. Xilian Island and Laoyao face each other, standing in the sea. However, the water depth between Xugou and Laoyao and the middle of Xilian Island is only fifteen feet at its deepest, and some areas are as shallow as several feet. It is necessary to fundamentally deepen the water to accommodate the entry and berthing of ships. It is estimated that a breakwater needs to be built, extending westward from the northwest end of Xilian Island to the sea off Sunjia Mountain, to prevent turbulent waves from the north. Then, ships can safely enter and exit the port from the southeast end of Xilian Island to the sea off Laoyao. The Longhai Railway must extend the route from Dapu, passing east of Xugou, crossing Sunjia Mountain, and reaching Laoyao, requiring an estimated cost of approximately 1.8 million yuan. As for the port development project, German engineer He Mude still needs to draw up diagrams and report to the chief engineer of the German headquarters for estimation before a concrete plan can be determined, as the project is vast and requires careful research and estimation. The area of Xilian Island, measured from a distance, is about 20 square kilometers. The port's perimeter is about 25 kilometers in both length and width. In the future, the extension of the Longhai Railway must proceed simultaneously with the port development. The German engineer left Xuzhou the same day to return south. The two committee members, Chen and Lin, went north from Xuzhou to conveniently visit Mount Tai. Qian Zongze is scheduled to return to Zhengzhou tomorrow. This port development is expected to be realized in about three to four months. (April 29)</p>

<h3>The First Water Police Team Captures Another Important Bandit</h3>
<p>Fan Guozhong, the captain of the First Water Police Team, along with Wang Leshan, an officer awaiting assignment, captured Dai Kechang, an important wanted criminal with a reward for his capture, in Shanghai. Dai Kechang was the vanguard of Taibao A'shu and known for his ferocity. Previously, it was widely rumored that pseudo-regiment commander Lu Yaosheng was captured in Shanghai, but it was a mistake involving Zhao A'mu. The Zhao bandit, namely pseudo-regiment commander Zhao Guomin, is currently under interrogation at the Minhang District Headquarters. The case has been reported to the command headquarters for record.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Discusses Business Tax Issues</h3>
<p>The local Business Tax Bureau was established and began operating last month. The business registration certificates have been largely completed. However, it is rumored that the tax will be levied next month. The County Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting today (30th) to discuss the matter and resolved that the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations violate the national guidelines. Until the Ministry of Industry submits the matter to the Central Political Committee for review, the provincial government's decision to implement the tax cannot be followed.</p>
<h3>Approval to Prohibit Quarrying in Jiufeng</h3>
<p>Song residents Geng Daochong and Zhang Kaiqi, among others, previously submitted a public petition to the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Industry, requesting a ban on quarrying in Jiufeng due to its detrimental effects. The petition stated that after the closure of Tianma Mountain, people were buying Xiaokunshan, Hengshan, and Xueshan from the Shatianshan Official Property Bureau under the pretext of afforestation and tree planting, and then digging graves and quarrying stones. As a result, stone factories sprung up and companies flourished. Recently, they even established private agencies in Shanghai, acting recklessly. The petition listed four major harms and requested that the provincial government instruct the Songqing County government to uphold the ban on quarrying and issue a notice of closure. The Ministry of Interior has now approved the petition, stating that it has consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government to handle the matter properly in accordance with the Ministry's regulations on the preservation of scenic spots, historical sites, and antiquities. It is also reported that the Ministry of Industry has instructed the Jiangsu Construction Department to order the county to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<h3>Joint Suppression of Lake Bandits by Land and Naval Forces</h3>
<p>In recent days, bandits have been rampant in various areas bordering Tai Lake, with frequent reports of looting. The Pacification Office has specially dispatched a security team of one battalion, led by Battalion Commander Gao Zhifu, from Jiangyin aboard two steamers towing eight large boats. They passed through Wuxi to Suzhou and arrived in Wujiang yesterday (30th) at 9:00 AM. They plan to proceed to Zhenze and then be stationed at key points in Tai Lake, such as Nanku Temple, to defend and suppress the bandits. Meanwhile, Shen Gaozhen, the chief of the Third District of the Naval Police, after receiving news of bandit activity at Maokou, Dongshan, on the 26th of last month, immediately dispatched Inspector Wang Rong aboard the Zhizhong steamship and training patrol boats to Dongshan. They joined forces with the county police and the Seventh and Eighth Teams of the Second District to search and suppress the bandits in Tai Lake. He also ordered the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Water Police Teams to guard Wujiang. The Fourteenth Team ambushed near Nanku Temple on the 27th, 28th, and 29th, preparing to attack. On the morning of the 28th, Zhang Guifang, the leader of the Fifteenth Team's detachment, led ten boats to search the Tai Lake area near Lujiagang, Wujiang. At 4:00 PM on the 30th, Captain Zhang telegraphed from Zhenze that they had captured six lake bandits, five guns, and rescued a hostage. Also, Huang, the leader of the First Team's detachment, captured a lake bandit surnamed Liu yesterday (30th) in the Shengzhen Meiyan River marshes. He has been sent to the Pingwang Team headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Successive Suicide Cases</h3>
<p>Guo Chen, a female worker from the Shenxin Third Factory workshop outside the West Gate of the city, 23 years old, committed suicide because her husband, Guo Rongsheng, often went out to idle and associated with undesirable elements, leading to financial difficulties. Although she repeatedly advised him, he ignored her. As a result, disputes arose between the couple. In anger, Chen had the idea of suicide. She secretly went out in the afternoon, bought twenty red pills of Jindan, and swallowed them in her room. Later, her husband noticed and immediately sought medical treatment, and she was saved. Also, Zhao Di, a child bride of a resident surnamed Chen from Gandeli, Dongxin Road, outside Guangfu Gate, was worried about her marriage with her husband, A'da. Yesterday afternoon, she swallowed a gold ring weighing two qian, intending to end her life. Fortunately, her mother-in-law found out and carried her to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, and her life was not in danger.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Decides to Acknowledge and Pay Business Tax</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce convened a temporary meeting of representatives from various industries to discuss the business tax issue. Fifty-two industries and seventy-three people attended. Qian Sunqing, the chairman, reported on previous consultations with the Business Tax Bureau and a recent meeting with the Director of Finance. The main point of contention was to temporarily implement a trial run with a maximum rate of two per thousand, with each industry determining the amount themselves and collectively acknowledging and paying the tax by industry. With the tax collection period imminent, it was urgent to discuss and determine a plan. Following discussions among those present, it was decided that the local business tax would allow each trade association to first invite members to discuss and determine the exact amount to acknowledge and pay, and then report back for verification. Industries without established trade associations could have Chamber of Commerce members responsible for handling the matter, and were limited to reporting back by May 7th to avoid delay, so that the information could be compiled and forwarded to the head office to finalize the procedures.</p>
<h3>Merchants Oppose Electricity Price Increase</h3>
<p>The Qishuyan Power Plant of the Construction Committee had previously reported that the raw materials for electricity mostly came from overseas, and since the rise in gold and fall in silver, all sources had increased in price. In addition, coal prices had soared and transportation costs had increased. Therefore, it was specially approved by the Construction Committee to cancel discounts on electricity fees in Wuxi City, effectively charging 1.8 jiao per kilowatt-hour, starting on May 1st, and a notice was published in the newspaper on the first of last month. However, residents Tao Nianzu, Yan Juezhi, and more than 800 households, including the Zhang Yimao store, felt that at a time when the cost of living was increasing, electricity was a necessity for the people, with the same importance as firewood, rice, oil, and salt. They represented the citizens of Wuxi and presented three points to Director Wu, requesting that public opinion be adopted, the people's plight be understood, and the decision be withdrawn. The three points of their request are recorded below: (1) The sale of electricity meters should be left to the people's freedom. (2) Cancel package rates and abolish unequal treaties. (3) Maintain discounts and reduce the burden on the people.</p>

<h3>Financial Bureau Urges Collection of Old Debts</h3>
<p>The grain affairs of Jiangdu have been notoriously sluggish. Over the years, arrears of busy season grain taxes have accumulated to more than 300,000 yuan. It is now reported that the Financial Bureau, in order to clear the arrears, has prepared a special project and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. Six collection officials have been established and all grain service villages and sandbanks in the county have been divided into more than twenty groups. Each group will be assigned one group leader, and each group will be further divided into six teams, with one collection official assigned to each team. The official will supervise the group leaders to collect the arrears of grain within the time limit. Among the collection officials, one will be designated as the head, and under the command of the land tax director and the collection supervisor, the teams will be compared and pursued. In addition, the actual collection registers for the 17th and 18th years will be retrieved, and the land tax director and collection supervisor will be ordered to extract the outstanding large households in each map and submit them to the county government for the assignment of bailiffs to accompany the grain service villages and sandbanks in each map to the county to urge collection. The county will no longer allow the clerks to use excuses to shirk responsibility.</p>
<h3>Angered by Wife's Infidelity, Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Lu Wenlong, a resident of Shaobo Town, has been making a living in Shanghai. He returned home the other day and discovered that his wife was having an affair with Wang Daguo, a bamboo alley vendor. Greatly angered, he committed suicide by poisoning himself. By the time people noticed, it was too late to rescue him, and he died immediately.</p>

<h3>Young Son of Yuan Family in Southern Countryside Kidnapped</h3>
<p>The home of Yuan Qinglai, a farmer in the Sixth Li of the First Main District of the southern countryside of the county, was suddenly attacked by many bandits on the night before last. They were armed with guns and looted everything. Before leaving, they kidnapped Yuan's young son and demanded a ransom of 10,000 yuan to be paid outside the East Gate of Xinghua. It is reported that Yuan has now come to the city to report the case to the county government and request a strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Old Man's One Misstep Leads to Eternal Regret</h3>
<p>Li Qianxiang, a farmer from Lijiazhuang, Sanmin Township, who is over seventy years old, was invited to a banquet in a neighboring village the other day. Unfortunately, he accidentally fell into the water while crossing a log bridge. He was rescued, but he had already died. It is a tragedy.</p>

<h3>Shipping Bureau Opposes Affixing Stamps to Ticket Stubs</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing Inland River Shipping Company has recently received notice that a one-jiao stamp should be affixed to each book of tickets. Therefore, the various shipping companies held a joint meeting yesterday. They all said that if the passenger ticket is worth more than one yuan, it already complies with the regulations by affixing a stamp. The ticket stub and the passenger ticket belong to the same page. If another stamp is affixed, it is tantamount to levying a double tax on a single trade document, which clearly violates the principles of tax law. It was resolved that a joint telegram would be sent to the Ministry of Finance and the Provincial Stamp Bureau on the same day to request cancellation in order to emphasize the tax law. If the request is not approved, the company will withdraw the tickets to avoid disturbances and reduce the burden.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping and Robbery Occurs in Tanghui Township</h3>
<p>The home of Wu Pinhe, a farmer in Zhuangbang, Tanghui North Township, Jiaxing, was broken into by thieves the day before yesterday. They looted arbitrarily, stealing clothing and ornaments worth about five or six hundred yuan. Before leaving, they kidnapped Wu Pinhe's married daughter, Fu Shi, and her son. Wu Pinhe and his son, Shi Xiang, were lucky enough to escape elsewhere and were not harmed.</p>

<h3>Remnants in Eastern Countryside Not Cleared</h3>
<p>After the leaders of the bandits in Pudong were executed one after another, the remaining bandits under Zhu Luo A'mei have not been completely cleared. It is now reported by people from the eastern countryside that the bandits Shen Jinsheng and Yang Meimei, claiming to be the commander and deputy commander, led the remnants of Zhu Luo A'mei's subordinates, including Liu Dexing, and looted again in Fuxingdai, on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, on the night of the 26th, and injured the victim. Now that the provincial army is heading to He, the remaining bandits at sea are landing one after another. It is reported that Wang Zhiqi's unit of the Second Regiment of the Provincial Security Team will be transferred to Pinghu to fill the defense soon.</p>

<h3>Loan for River Works Returned Through Tax Levy</h3>
<p>The funds for the Nanqiao Tang River works, previously insufficient due to the levy, were entrusted by the Construction and Finance Bureaus to the local gentry Shen Menglian for guarantee and a loan of 4,000 yuan was obtained from the bank to supplement the funds. Unexpectedly, after lawsuits arose over the eastern and western dikes, the river donations originally intended to repay the loan could not be continued, and the loan could not be repaid, which has been in arrears for three years. Now, in order to maintain public credit, the county government has specially submitted the matter to the current county council for discussion. It was decided to follow the original plan of the Second Local Administrative Council, and except for the arrears of the West Dike, which will be compensated by itself, the East Dike will levy a special donation to repay the debt in the 20th year. The matter was reported to the Construction and Finance Departments yesterday to request instructions for handling.</p>
<h3>Suicide Attempt After Wife's Death and Concubine's Demise is Rescued</h3>
<p>In Xiaocheng Huangmiao Tou in the county, there is a farmer named Gu Zhaocai whose wife is mad and paralyzed and unable to give birth. Therefore, he married a Huang woman this spring as a concubine in order to continue his lineage. Unexpectedly, not long after their marriage, Zhaocai became seriously ill. When he got out of bed, the concubine suddenly contracted an epidemic and died. Recently, his wife also died of her old illness one after another. Facing this adversity, Zhaocai felt that there was no joy in life and swallowed raw opium yesterday, intending to end his life. Fortunately, his nephew Zhou Xiongbo came to visit and noticed something unusual. He called the neighbors to rescue him with all their might, and there was no danger to his life. However, because the stimulus was too deep, there is fear that he may develop mental illness.</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader Li Wenjun Arrested</h3>
<p>Li Wenjun (also known as Guan Jie), the leader of the bandits who burned and looted in Zhuanghang, once served as the pseudo-political director under Taibao A'shu. After he was discovered and wanted by the Robbery Bandit Command the day before yesterday, he was arrested by the First District of the Water Police. Also, the concubine (Zhuang Gu) of Tang Yixin, a notorious bandit in Zhuanghang who has been executed, was also captured in Ji'an Lane, Shanghai, while buying thread. Now, all circles in Zhuanghang believe that these two bandits are the main ringleaders in the tragic burning and looting case in Zhuanghang in the 18th year. They have telegraphed the provincial government today (29th) to request approval to follow the precedent of Taibao A'shu and execute them by firing squad on the spot in Zhuanghang Town, the most important place of the crime, in order to satisfy the people's anger.</p>

<h3>Robbery of Salt and Assault of Boatman</h3>
<p>The Julong Salt Through-Tank Company in Xinba Town, Xiaoshan's southern countryside, was entrusted by Shao Gaosheng, a boatman commissioned by the Yansuo in Shaoxing, to transport several hundred salt cargoes to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the other day (23rd). Unexpectedly, as soon as the boat arrived at the port and was being unloaded, several villagers suddenly came and forcibly robbed the lower cabin. Although Shao and others stepped forward to fight back, there were too many people, and three large baskets of salt were robbed. The boatman Shao Gaosheng was assaulted and his life is in danger. Shao has taken the body to the county court to request an inspection and has filed a complaint requesting the return of the salt and the arrest and punishment of the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Clear Autonomous Household Donations</h3>
<p>Since the Xiaoshan County Government began processing autonomous household donations last year, each village and li 都 has used this as a major source of income. In addition to the district offices extracting 25% from each village chief and li chief, the rest is embezzled by the village chiefs and li chiefs. Although the county government has sent officials to the countryside to clean up, the village chiefs and li chiefs mostly look on and wait. Now that the cleanup period has long expired, the cleanup has not been handled, and the cleanup officials can only sigh helplessly.</p>

<h3>Ying Xudong's Home Robbed and Burned</h3>
<p>The home of Ying Xudong, a resident of Ying in the Fourth Jia area near Haimen, Linhai, was suddenly attacked by more than thirty bandits wielding weapons at around 12:00 PM the night before last. Seeing that they were well-equipped with guns, the family did not dare to resist. They were robbed of silver, money, clothes, jewelry, and other items worth more than a thousand silver dollars. More than twenty houses were burned down, and it was heard that seven people were burned to death and three people were kidnapped. The family has filed a complaint with the competent authorities for investigation and arrest. It is unknown whether they will be able to capture them.</p>

<h3>The Opening of the Fourth Jiangsu Provincial Joint Games for Middle Schools</h3>
<p>Held in Zhenjiang for four days starting at 9:00 AM today</p>
<p>Wu Bangwei Swears in the Provincial Stadium's Inauguration Ceremony</p>
<p>The Fourth Jiangsu Provincial Joint Games for Middle Schools began today at 9:00 AM and will be held for four days at the Zhenjiang Provincial Zhenjiang Stadium. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Brief History of the Assembly</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Joint Games for Middle Schools have been held for four years so far. The first two sessions were held in Nanjing, but at that time there was a university district system, and only a few schools participated. Since the provincial capital moved to Zhenjiang, the third session was also held in Zhenjiang. The conference was organized by the Department of Education. A provincial stadium was opened in the southern suburbs of Zhenjiang to be used as a competition venue. The number of participants increased compared to before. This year is the fourth session. Regardless of whether they are provincial, county, public, or private schools, they have enthusiastically signed up to participate, and the number of schools and athletes has doubled compared to before. The spirit and results of each conference have been very satisfactory. In one year, all sixty-one counties in the province will be represented.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Venue</h3>
<p>The venue for the conference is the Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang Public Stadium, formerly the training ground of the Zhenjiang Police Academy. It is located outside the South Gate of Zhenjiang and covers an area of ​​tens of acres. It has now been rebuilt. The northernmost building is the office hall. To the left and right of the hall are the netball, volleyball, and tennis courts, for a total of four courts on the left. To the right are connecting volleyball and basketball courts, all outdoors and surrounded by wooden fences. The southernmost is the large sports field, which is the track and field competition field. A football field is set up in the middle. When playing football, track and field will be suspended. To the east of the football field is the command stand, which is very artistic in construction. Unfortunately, there is no large wooden seat for the audience, and it is feared that it cannot accommodate many people, which is a shortcoming.</p>
<p>The scenery of the venue is very beautiful. Small mountains rise in the front and back, and an ancient pagoda stands upright in front, implying the unyielding spirit of men. To the left and behind is a forestation field, with dense green shade, which can be used as a natural grandstand. At the entrance of the field, a magnificent archway is built, cut in white, with green and blue edges, adorned with gold letters, magnificent and revealing beauty.</p>

<h3>Today's "May First" Holiday</h3>
<p>Factories Closed</p>
<p>Military and Police Precautions</p>
<p>Today is the May First Labor Day, and also the day when various factories are closed and work is suspended. The military and police authorities in both the Chinese and foreign-controlled areas of this port have been stepping up security since yesterday. The situation yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<h3>North and South City</h3>
<p>In the Chinese area, this morning in the South City, on Mingguo Road, Zhonghua Road, and at Laoximen, Fangbang Bridge, Shiliupu, etc., the Municipal Public Security Bureau has increased double posts. At important locations, the Public Security Brigade has also sent teams with three to five box cannons for auxiliary defense. Gaochang Temple and Longhua are under the jurisdiction of military institutions, and a patrol team organized by the stationed Fifth Division troops temporarily patrols with guns. The military police guards and the arsenal guards have received orders to cut off pedestrian traffic after 8:00 PM tonight. The area between the arsenal and Zhabei is also a place where factories are concentrated, so the various public security sub-bureaus have also been strictly taking precautions since yesterday.</p>
<h3>Two Concessions</h3>
<p>The Public Concession and the French Concession have been taking strict precautions since the discovery of leaflets for the May First Labor Day on Nanjing Road a few days ago, sparing no effort. Yesterday, in the western part of Shanghai, the constabulary sent officers on motorcycles to patrol with the volunteer corps to prevent any eventuality. It is said that more detectives will also be stationed in various amusement parks and entertainment venues today.</p>
<h3>Wusong</h3>
<p>Wusong implemented martial law after 6:00 PM last night. At the Jungong Road intersection and the Yunzaobang Bridge, Zhang, the chief of the first section of the seventh district, sent police to guard and check pedestrians. The main roads on Waima Road, Paotai Bay, Tongji Road, and Taixing Road are guarded by police sent by Zhao, the district chief of the seventh district. The Huangpu River, Yunzaobang, Yizhoutang, etc., are patrolled by teams sent by Ding Xiaoping, the captain of the water patrol team. Each station of the Songhu Railway also has troops stationed by Xiong, the battalion commander of the Fifth Division.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Leaving for Beijing Tonight to Attend the National Assembly</p>
<p>And Negotiate Fujian Financial Issues</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang, Minister of the Navy and Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, along with Central Committee member Chen Zhaoying, Fujian Provincial Committee member Chen Peikun, former Secretary-General of the Fujian Provincial Government Wu Buyue, Yang's secretary Shen Jikui, adjutant Lin Zhijin, and more than ten other staff members, arrived at the mouth of Wusong at 10:30 AM yesterday on the Puan warship from Fujian. The headquarters of the First Fleet of this port specially dispatched adjutant Peng Zuxuan and a Jiangnan launch to Wusong to welcome them. After Yang and others landed at the Wusong Wharf, they took a car to the Navy Club on Jing'an Temple Road to rest. In the afternoon, Yang met with the captains of the various ships stationed in Shanghai, as well as Chen Zaofan, the deputy director of the shipyard, and Wu Guangzong, the director of the Hydrographic Bureau. According to Adjutant Lin, who came with him, he had not heard of the collective resignation of the Fujian Provincial Committee when they left Fujian, but the financial situation in Fujian Province is indeed very difficult. This time, Minister Yang is going to Beijing to attend the National Assembly, and he also plans to discuss solutions to the Fujian financial problem with the central government. As for the handling of political prisoners such as Lin Zhong, it is entirely up to the central government, and Chairman Yang has no preconceived notions, and so on. Yang, along with Central Committee member Chen Zhaoying, adjutants, and staff members, took the night train to Beijing at 11:45 PM last night.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Foreigners Entering China Begins Today</h3>
<p>One Group Permanently Stationed in Wusong</p>
<p>Implementation at the New Customs Wharf</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau, having been ordered to inspect the entry permits of foreigners entering China, has promulgated detailed regulations and announced that the inspection will be implemented on May 1st. It is heard that the bureau has obtained Director Chen's approval for the group inspection arrangement. One group will be stationed at the Wusong Fire Brigade Building as an office, with four resident inspectors. The majority of the inspectors, led by Chen Timin, the deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Section, will set up a foreign passport inspection office on the second floor of No. 9 Hankou Road in the Public Concession, in order to facilitate close contact with the Customs and assist in the handling. It is also heard that because the arrival times of foreign ships are uncertain, each inspector is permanently stationed at the office for inspection and registration at any time. The arrangements were completed yesterday and will be officially opened today. It is also heard that foreign ships entering today will not stop at Wusong to disembark passengers. All foreigners will take tugboats to Shanghai to disembark at the New Customs Wharf, which is the usual practice for foreign ships entering the port. Most of them switch to tugboats and disembark on the Bund, so the inspection work in Wusong is very rare. Yesterday, the office received a report from the Customs that a foreign ship would enter the port at 7:00 AM today and disembark at the New Customs Wharf. Hong Qi, the director of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has notified all inspectors to take note of this and handle it. It is also heard that Director Hong plans to personally lead the inspectors to board the ship for inspection at that time.</p>
<p>A Record of Ship Collisions</p>
<h3>French Mail Steamer Collides with Lion Steamer</h3>
<p>The Sphinx, a French mail steamer of the French Mail Steamer Company on the China-France route, arrived in Shanghai from Marseille and entered the Huangpu River at 11:00 AM yesterday. As the ship was mooring at the China Merchants Bureau's middle wharf, it was turning around when the Lion Steamer of the Sanbei Company, which was chartered to the Soviet merchant fleet to load cargo, was departing from Shanghai to Vladivostok. As it left the dock and approached the Waibaidu Bridge, it collided with the French mail steamer. As the Sphinx was turning around, the Lion was proceeding along the right side of the channel. The waves were most turbulent at that point. The bow of the French mail steamer rammed into the side of the Lion while turning. Fortunately, the Lion quickly retreated, but the outer side of its bow was struck by the French mail steamer's bow near the anchor hole. The French steamer has a displacement of 20,000 tons, while the Lion has only 3,000 tons. The impact caused the iron plate on the bow of the Lion to be damaged, but fortunately, no one was injured. It immediately reversed and returned to the Lan Nidu Wharf to moor. The incident was reported to the Customs River Department, and an engineer was asked to inspect the damage in order to negotiate compensation with the French steamer. At the same time, the damaged area was immediately repaired so that it could depart today. The French mail steamer was not damaged.</p>
<h3>Hubei Steamer Damages Nanning Steamer</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Pao (North China Daily News) reported that the Taikoo Company of this port recently received a wireless telegram stating that the company's Hubei steamer and the Nanning steamer collided on the Fujian waters on Wednesday (29th) morning. The Nanning steamer was slightly damaged, but the details are not yet known.</p>
<p>The Shipwrecked Crew of the Huayang Returns to Shanghai</p>
<h3>Shipwrecked Comrades Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Huayang Steamer of the Hang'an Shipping Company encountered a reef in the fog off Nanyushan on the Wenzhou waters. The 112 crew members and passengers were rescued by a British mail steamer to Hong Kong. Forty-two of the passengers were sent to Xiamen in Hong Kong to return to Fujian, while the 71 crew members and sailors, including the Russian captain Shakrov, stayed in Hong Kong for two days. The Yonglong firm in Hong Kong purchased tickets for them on the Lushan Maru of the Nisshin Company, which arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM yesterday. After the shipwreck, each person only escaped with the clothes on their backs. Their luggage and belongings were not recovered. Therefore, they arrived in Shanghai yesterday in a very disheveled state.</p>
<h3>Truth about the Accident</h3>
<p>According to the shipwrecked crew members who spoke to the reporter, the Huayang encountered dense fog north of Nanyushan on the 21st. After the ship struck a submerged reef, the captain, Shakrov, ordered the engineer to reverse, intending to retreat. Unexpectedly, the reef had penetrated the ship, and the bottom of the ship was immediately divided into two and sank after reversing, leaving no time to linger. The crew, sailors, and passengers rushed to the deck. First, two sampans were lowered to rescue the passengers onto the reef, and then the sampans were lowered again to rescue the workers. They gathered at the foot of Nanyushan and climbed to the summit, where they were rescued by Liang Meiting, a local fisherman, and were able to survive.</p>
<h3>All Cargo Lost</h3>
<p>The ship has tilted over and capsized, and the cargo has completely sunk. Yesterday, the survivors returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. As they passed the Ma'an sea area, they only saw the Huayang's masts sticking out of the sea, and it was impossible to salvage anything. The passengers' and crew's luggage was also lost at sea. The loss, both public and private, amounted to four to five hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Settling the Crew</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the crew members arrived at the Hang'an Shipping Company and asked Huang Xingge to provide relief funds in accordance with the method of compensating the crew members after the Newchang and Dachang shipwrecks. Yesterday afternoon, Le, the compradore of the ship, was discussing the matter with Huang Xingge.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Still Allowed to Enter</h3>
<p>Our country announced that, starting today, Japanese fishing boats would be prohibited from entering the country, causing great panic among Japanese fishermen and merchants in Shanghai, Andong, and Qingdao. The Japanese authorities immediately negotiated with our country, mainly to preserve their fishing rights. It is confirmed that the ban on Japanese fishing boats under 100 tons from entering the country on May 1st has been declared indefinitely postponed. Therefore, starting today, Japanese fishing boats can still go to the ports of An, Jiao, and Hu in China as usual.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Announces Abolition of Unified Tax Office in Customs</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Unified Tax Office has determined to abolish the Unified Tax Office in Customs, effective on the 16th of this month. Yesterday, it issued a special announcement to the merchants, stating: "Regarding the announcement, on April 23rd of this year, Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance instructed that the Unified Tax Office and the various district bureaus and management offices had resident offices in the Customs to handle the collection of unified taxes on imported goods and to inspect export goods subject to unified taxes. Now, in order to facilitate merchants and the people, the above-mentioned resident offices will be abolished on May 1st. The original collection and inspection matters will be transferred to the Customs Taipan of each port. All handover and necessary procedures will be properly arranged and reported by the Customs Administration, the Unified Tax Office, and the Inspector General of Customs. Matters such as the supervision and affixing of stamps and the issuance of permits for unified tax goods will continue to be handled by the Unified Tax Office." This was done after consultation with the Customs Administration and the Inspector General of Customs, and the various district bureaus and offices were first notified to comply. As the handover and necessary procedures are still being prepared, it has been decided, after further consultation, to change the effective date to May 16th. All collection and inspection methods have been separately communicated by letter. In addition, six articles related to merchants are extracted and announced to all merchants, factories, and firms subject to unified taxes. This is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order Exempts Oil Managers from Business Tax</h3>
<p>Orders Have Been Issued to All Provinces and Cities to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Oil Industry Association at No. 179 Mingguo Road previously stated that the nature of the various sub-managers in this port is equivalent to branches of the head office, which is different from ordinary sellers. They have separately petitioned the Municipal Government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting exemption from business tax. In addition, Guanghua Oil Company, a member of the association, previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request a halt to the strong collection of business tax in Fujian Province, and stated the reasons, earnestly requesting that an order be issued immediately to all provinces and cities, ordering them not to collect business tax from oil managers again. After the above was sent, it is now known that the company received a Ministry telegram the day before yesterday, approving the request, and issuing a letter to the various provinces and cities, stating: "Regarding the letter, according to the telegram from Xu Jingren, chairman of Shanghai Guanghua Oil Company, stating that the case of Fujian's strong collection of oil business tax is inconsistent with the regulations, and earnestly requesting the Ministry to order Fujian to stop it, and requesting a reply, etc., according to this, after investigation, the contract signed between the National Government and Mobil, Asiatic, Texaco, etc., on January 31, 1929, clearly stipulates that in addition to the import tax collected by the Customs according to the current tariff rules, and the various taxes listed in the contract, all other taxes and levies should be exempted. The National Government has clearly ordered compliance in the case of Guanghua Oil Company, although there is no contract relationship, it should be treated equally in accordance with the principle of treating foreign merchants equally. The collection of kerosene tax in each province, except for miscellaneous goods stores that also operate retail kerosene and gasoline, should still collect business tax, all kerosene and gasoline companies and wholesale stores should be exempted from business tax to comply with the central government's decision. According to the previous situation, in addition to forwarding the letter, we hereby request your provincial and municipal governments to forward the letter to the finance departments and bureaus for compliance. We hope you will investigate accordingly." According to the letter, miscellaneous goods stores are similar in nature to opium dens, and wholesale stores refer to the various oil distribution managers in this port and other ports. It is heard that the association has recorded the case and distributed it to each manager member for information.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan Gives a Speech at the National YWCA</h3>
<p>Women's Understanding of the National Assembly</p>
<p>The National YWCA invited Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, to give a speech at the association on the afternoon of April 28th. The topic was Women's Understanding of the Upcoming National Assembly. Ms. Ding Shujing, the general secretary of the association, presided over the meeting. The main points of Mr. Pan's speech are summarized below: "The election law for this National Assembly adopts a system of occupational group elections. Groups such as agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and freelance professions all have the right to send representatives. However, women's groups are excluded, which seems inconsistent with the principle of gender equality enshrined in the Kuomintang platform, which has inevitably caused misunderstandings among women across the country. In fact, each occupational group has women</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>within it. There is no need to separate gender boundaries. Therefore, theoretically speaking, this approach is intended by the authorities to eliminate gender divisions. But in reality, there are very few women working in occupational fields. Apart from a large number of female workers in silk mills, the number of men in other occupational fields far outnumbers women by a factor of ten thousand. As for women working in freelance professions, such as lawyers, accountants, engineers, doctors, and pharmacists, they are even rarer. Due to the small number of women in occupational fields, their chances of being elected are naturally low. This is an undeniable fact. The central authorities have now indicated that they will allow domestic women's groups to jointly nominate ten female representatives to attend the domestic conferences, but whether this matter can become a reality depends on the permission of the presidium of the National Assembly before it can be implemented. According to the organizational law of the National Assembly, in addition to the central party executive and supervisory committee members and the ministers of the various Yuan (councils), those specially permitted by the presidium may also attend. However, attendees only have the right to speak, not to vote. But according to recent news, the issue of women representatives attending will probably be resolved. The major cases to be decided by the National Assembly can be broadly divided into domestic and foreign affairs. Domestically, they are nothing more than guaranteeing domestic tranquility, training people in self-government, and maintaining social order. All these are common goals for the whole country, so there is no need to distinguish between men and women. As for foreign affairs, the greatest goal is to abolish unequal treaties. This is the unanimous demand of the whole country, and of course, there is no gender boundary. As for the abolition of unequal treaties, the diplomatic authorities have clearly announced that they are prepared to conclude it before May 5th. But in reality, there are still many hidden reefs ahead. Anyone who is slightly aware of the diplomatic situation can understand that this requires the entire body of representatives to generate concrete solutions in the National Assembly. Then the government will have the support of the entire nation, and all negotiations will naturally proceed effectively. This matter is related to the lifeblood of our country, and all female representatives attending should also fulfill their national duty and work together. In addition, the matters that are closely related to women are the Constitution. If there are any provisions in the Constitution that are unfavorable to women, the female representatives attending can raise objections and ask the National Assembly to consider them in detail before adopting them. But judging from past experience, the National Government will certainly not discriminate against men and women, because the Party platform set by the late Premier also has provisions to promote gender equality. Finally, I ask my fellow women to consider the National Assembly for the entire China, and not to focus solely on the advantages and disadvantages of women. Moreover, the male representatives who attend also have the obligation to work for their wives, daughters, and sisters, so it is not impossible for indirect influence to occur." After the speech, the audience who attended raised questions for discussion, and Mr. Pan explained them one by one, which was quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3>The All-Anhui Association Sends an Urgent Telegram to the National Government</h3>
<p>Immediately Dismiss Chen Diaoyuan and Hand Him Over for Punishment</p>
<p>The All-Anhui Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the central government yesterday regarding Chen Diaoyuan's refusal to accept the impeachment by the Control Yuan. The telegram stated: "To the National Government in Nanjing, we have read in the newspaper that Chairman Chen Diaoyuan of Anhui telegraphed Chairman Jiang, claiming that the Control Yuan's impeachment was based on fabricated facts, which is very serious. We have investigated that since the central government clearly ordered the abolition of likin (internal tariffs) on January 1st, Chen Diaoyuan has arbitrarily established salt and rice bureaus, which is a violation of the central government's ban on likin-like levies. Anhui people have repeatedly reported this, and your government has repeatedly ordered the abolition, but Chen Diaoyuan has dared to resist, dispatching troops to forcibly collect taxes, killing boatmen, and triggering strikes in Wuhu and Bengbu. Not only have public organizations inside and outside Anhui filed petitions with the central government, but the Ministry of Finance also has a telegram to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce ordering the punishment of Chen's subordinates who caused the incident. Although it was abolished later, a disguised food administration was established, which deducts ships and extorts donations, even more severe than the rice donation. Yang Xiaowu and other representatives of the Wuhu rice merchants petitioned to stop this. Now, although it has been eased, there is still a condition of oppressing Wuhu rice merchants to raise one million yuan. Matters such as collecting tobacco tax and issuing tobacco licenses cannot be concealed. The Central Anti-Opium Association has consulted the provincial government on the case of the Datong Public Security Bureau transporting opium. On April 7th, it was discovered in Huixian that Lin, the troop commander of the Datong Military Police Inspection Office, was carrying 150 catties of opium with his troops and weapons. County Magistrate Wu Wenjun did not dare to handle it and personally went to Datong for instructions. In Shexian, Magistrate Miao discovered that the Wuhu Military Police Office had sent Mao and Shen, two troop members, to escort Zhou Baoqing and other opium traffickers. The Wuhu Military Police Office Director Yang Yizhai sent an urgent telegram requesting their release. Furthermore, as for forcing people to grow opium, Wei, the brigade commander Lihuang, telegraphed the central government requesting that officials be sent to eradicate opium seedlings in northern Anhui. In summary, the evidence is overwhelming. It cannot be said that Anhui merchants are falsely accusing him, or that Anhui public organizations are falsely accusing him, or that the Anti-Opium Association and the Ministry of Finance are falsely accusing him, or that the Control Yuan, which bears the highest supervisory responsibility in the country, is also falsely accusing him. How can such an extremely vicious person be tolerated any longer? We earnestly request your government to comply with the Control Yuan's impeachment, immediately dismiss Chen Diaoyuan and hand him over for punishment, and order the Datong Public Security Bureau Director, troop commander Lin Tingfang, troop members Mao and Shen, opium trafficker Zhou Baoqing, and others to be escorted to the central government for interrogation, and the opium from Yixian and Shexian to be sent to the central government for destruction. If Chen Diaoyuan still thinks he can escape and refuses to plead guilty, this association is willing to sign a reverse guarantee and send representatives to confront him in person to uphold the law and comply with public opinion. We urgently await orders. The telegram to the Control Yuan is the same, omitted."</p>
<h3>China International Trade Association Emphasizes Introducing Direct Trade</h3>
<p>The China International Trade Association was organized by a preparatory committee of more than 100 people, including Zhang Gongquan and Chen Guangfu, appointed by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce based on the resolutions of the National Industry and Commerce Conference. The inaugural meeting was held in mid-February, and Chen Guangfu, Zhang Gongquan, Ren Sida, Lin Kanghou, Zou Bingwen, and others were elected as executive directors, as reported in various newspapers. Currently, the association's affairs are actively underway. Merchants and individuals in this port and elsewhere who are interested in international trade are also actively joining the association. It is heard that the association's main work is to introduce direct trade in the first step. China's international trade has had an import surplus for many years, and major commodities such as silk, tea, and egg products have also declined year by year. The main reason is the inability to trade directly. Whether importing or exporting, foreign merchants handle everything. Domestic delivery and overseas market conditions are at the disposal of foreign merchants. The losses suffered by Chinese merchants are very significant. In order to remedy this situation and develop Chinese trade, the association plans to start by introducing direct trade as the first step. The association can find ways to introduce foreign merchants who want to purchase goods, inquire about the situation, or seek trading partners in China, and Chinese merchants who want to find markets for their exported goods abroad, so that they can directly communicate and avoid the monopoly of a few foreign firms. It is now heard that the association is carefully drafting appropriate measures, which will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Record of the Emergency Relief Tea Party for Shaanxi Disaster</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan Will Go to the Disaster Area to Supervise Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Please Submit Unpaid Contributions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Emergency Relief Committee for the Shaanxi Disaster held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, inviting individuals from all walks of life in Shanghai who had been involved in fundraising. Attendees included Zhu Ziqiao, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Zhihao, Tang Jiyao, Yuan Ludeng, Ha Shaofu, Wen Lanting, Liu Zhanen, Wang Peiyuan, Lu Qisheng, Wang Jiean, Xu Yongzuo, Zhang Yichen, Lu Weiwen, Yu Yangsheng, and over a hundred others. Wang Xiaolai chaired the meeting, delivering a brief opening speech, followed by Zhu Ziqiao reporting on the current situation in Shaanxi, including the establishment of porridge kitchens in various districts, arrangements for emergency relief and work relief, educating and employing disaster-stricken children, burying corpses, transporting medicines for epidemic prevention, and filling in trenches for disaster relief work. Regarding the conflicts between the Hui and Han populations in Gansu and their backgrounds, teams had been dispatched several times to investigate, but were unable to pass due to bandit obstruction. Efforts are now being focused on transportation to understand the root cause, address it, and apply the spirit of human mutual aid to eliminate natural and man-made disasters. However, Qinglan intends to travel to the disaster area soon to supervise relief efforts. He hopes that various Shanghai organizations and charitable individuals will contribute the amounts already pledged but not yet paid, so that Qinglan can take them to help with disaster relief. Next, Kang Jiyao, chairman of the Shaanxi Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee, reported on the Shaanxi disaster, dividing it into three categories: famine, war, and plague. He suggested that the Buddhist teachings of greed, anger, and ignorance, which are the foremost things to avoid, are the root causes. He stated that misfortune and fortune have no gate, but are summoned by oneself; insatiable greed is repaid with famine, tyrannical and unrestrained violence is repaid with war, and disbelief in cause and effect is repaid with plague, which is the law of heaven. Therefore, in addition to providing material relief, they are also holding prayer meetings and printing and distributing good books, hoping to encourage abstinence from killing and the release of living beings, and to counter the three unwholesome karmas. Then, Wu Zhihao reported that various trade groups and major philanthropists, silver money guilds, exchanges, and industrial factories in Shanghai have raised a total of 354,353.18 yuan. In addition, a wandering monk from Ningbo, An Xin Toutuo, donated 25,000 yuan and will accompany the team to distribute relief. There was also a report from the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Committee, which telegraphed the disaster situation in various counties, such as Lan Gao, Wugong, Shuncheng, Pucheng, Hengshan, Zhouzhi, Xingping, Jingbian, Shangxian, Qishan, Liquan, Longxian, Jingyang, Xianyang, Mei County, Chaiyang, Lin Tong, Feng, Sanyuan, Fengxiang, and Weinan, and dozens of other counties. The disaster situation is mainly severe drought for many years, with cracked fields, destroyed houses due to bandits, widespread epidemics, corpses lying everywhere, the old and weak turning to ditches, and the young and strong taking risks. Homes are without possessions, and the fields are full of starved corpses. The telegrams were so tragic that they could not be fully read. As for the relief funds already remitted, they amount to approximately 210,000 yuan. Finally, the chairman congratulated those who generously donated, wishing them great wealth, so that they could increase benefactors for the disaster victims. Finally, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Another report states that Zhu Qinglan will travel to Tianjin and Beijing on the 5th or 6th of this month to appeal for disaster relief for the disaster victims, urging donations to be quickly transferred to the disaster area to supervise relief efforts. It is reported that Mr. Zhu has already conducted four field surveys in Shaanxi and other places.</p>

<h3>Statements from Various Trade Associations on the Xin Haishan Case</h3>
<p>The various trade associations issued a telegram yesterday stating: To all compatriots nationwide via various newspapers: The bloodstains of the brutal murder of Xin Dingxiang by French sailors have not yet dried, and now the tragedy of Xin Haishan being shot by French police has occurred again. What crime have our compatriots committed to suffer such misery? The French police dared to injure people for no reason, which is truly disregard for the law. The concession authorities turned a blind eye to it, which is even more intolerable to the world. If our Chinese nation is not as drunk and dreamy as it was in the past, we should unite as one to support negotiations. Our heads can be thrown away, but this hatred must be avenged. Our blood can flow, but this revenge must be taken. A moment's delay concerns the survival of the nation. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate strictly with the French Consul to achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrators, apologizing, and providing compensation, we sincerely appeal and hope for resonance. Sincerely, Shanghai Nanhua Industry, North-South Goods Dismantling Industry, and Industry Association. To all national groups and institutions: A telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated: To the esteemed National Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Although the Shanghai Municipal Government has filed a negotiation in the case of Xin Haishan being shot by Western police in the French Concession, there have been no results. All sectors are indignant and cannot live a day longer. The Western police rely on the power of imperialists to open fire arbitrarily and play with people's lives, which is truly the nature of jackals and wolves and disregards the law. If we do not fight for this, what remains of the national system? If we do not extend this, where is justice? We dare to telegram your government to negotiate strictly with the French Consul based on reason and achieve satisfactory results. The survival of the country hangs in the balance, and the safety of the nation is at stake. We hope for unanimous support and jointly urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate strictly, and we will not give up until we achieve our goals.

<h3>Is a Money Shop Law Necessary? Zhou Yangwen</h3>
<p>Banks and money shops are both financial institutions in our country today. Only because of the different operating methods and the different organizational systems, there is inevitably a distinction between the two. Since the Legislative Yuan passed the Banking Law at the 133rd meeting of the Yuan, the money shop industry believes that various regulations are difficult to apply to the money shop industry, so letters and telegrams have been sent one after another, requesting the promulgation of independent laws and regulations. The reason for their request to enact a separate money shop law is nothing more than (1) the money shop industry has a long history in our country's financial history, and the writing of laws is purely based on custom. Now that the money shop industry has a considerable history and custom, there is a need to specifically enact special laws to protect it. (2) Our country's southern industry is nascent, and industrial and commercial shops rely purely on the credit of money shops to grant loans for turnover. If the money shop industry stops operating credit loans, the commercial industry will immediately decline, and the industrial industry will also stagnate at the same time. The impact of this will be of great importance. The above two reasons are the only basis for the money shop industry to request the enactment of a separate money shop law. From the perspective of legislation, the purpose is to stabilize the financial situation of the society, and then to respond to the trend of the world economy, and to seek the improvement of the organization and business of modern financial industry, so as to meet the needs of modern new industries. Therefore, the Banking Law is specifically formulated to transform habits and improve the social and economic status with the power of law. The intention of both is good, but the results are different. Now, let us use a fair and straightforward attitude to explore whether a money shop law is necessary in the principle of the evolution of the times. Before discussing whether there is a need to enact a special law, we must first talk about whether the business methods of the money shop industry are sufficient to meet the needs of modern society. If we want to study whether it is sufficient to meet the needs of society, we must first trace back to the business methods of the money shop industry. According to the business methods of modern money shops, in short, there are about three points: 1. The buying and selling of silver and the difference between the income and expenditure of various households; 2. Credit loans; 3. The transfer of silver between the same industry. The above three categories are the most important businesses of the money shop industry. Although there are also types such as pledging loans, remittances, and deposits, they are all listed in a secondary position, and the methods are not as thorough and extensive as those of banks. Now, let's further investigate whether the business methods of its three main categories have the possibility of existence and maintenance, so as to see whether a money shop law is necessary. A. The buying and selling of silver and the difference between the income and expenditure of various households. It is known to everyone that our country's monetary system is chaotic. Since silver dollars were adopted as the national currency and circulated everywhere, silver (that is, Guiyuan, which is a completely fictitious standard and has no physical object) should have disappeared. Only because it is profitable (receiving and paying with real silver dollars, keeping accounts, exchanging silver dollars in the fictitious market, and paying in and out of the market), it is maintained in every way, which leads to different types of currency depending on the region. Merchants and people have the suffering of being repeatedly exploited, and there is no benefit to the smooth use of currency. Within a country, the exchange is as frequent as foreign exchange. This unhealthy phenomenon that harms commerce should have been abolished long ago, or it is also the origin of the abolition of silver and the change to Yuan. Now, our country's finances are becoming more and more stable, and reforming malpractices is one of the important policies. Therefore, there is an act of hiring experts to design a monetary system. Now, the price ratio of gold and silver is very different, and it is forced by the trend of the world economy to implement the gold standard system, which seems difficult to delay. In the future, the direct method of reforming the monetary system (see the draft of the Gold Standard Monetary System Law by Gan Moer) is implemented, and even the current national currency must be changed, let alone silver. Silver, as a thing, has become a past trace in the history of our country's monetary system. There is no possibility of permanent existence, and it has evolved into a trend of natural elimination, which is also clear. Then, in the near future, the silver that the money shop industry regards as its main business will no longer be able to be maintained, so why is there a need for a money shop law? B. Credit loans. Observing society from the perspective of the entire economy, its scope is not limited to one industry or one business. That is, any individual legal person, organization, or non-legal person organization should have a place for the financial industry to operate. Moreover, social evolution is changing with each passing day, and various situations are different from the past. According to the methods and scope of credit loans in the main business of money shops, it is already clear that it cannot meet the needs of the entire society. Furthermore, the position of the financial industry is the organ for receiving and transferring credit. Its responsibility is of great importance and is related to the prosperity and decline of the social economy. The risk of credit loans is great. Once it fails, it will directly harm the interests of depositors and indirectly shake social finance. If depositors want to have security, then loans must be restricted first (Article 34 of the Banking Law). To manage the business and avoid malpractices, the organization must first be improved (Article 2 of the Banking Law). To protect the interests of the majority of society and seek the stability of the national economy, it is necessary to use the coercion and supervision of the law to achieve success. Examining the process of evolution of the financial industry in various countries, it is all like this. As for saying that if credit loans stop or decrease, the industrial and commercial industries will decline, etc., thinking from a simple and narrow perspective, it seems worrying. However, if we inspect it from the principle of the entire economic change, we believe that it can therefore obtain the improvement of the financial status, and therefore transform the empty and unstable credit loan into a substantial mortgage loan with collateral. It can also break the unnecessary habit of regarding mortgages as shameful by our country's merchants and people. If the money shop industry does not operate credit loans, the shops will inevitably rely only on their inherent capital to operate, and the result is that the business will decrease and the profits will be meager. The industrial industry will also have difficulty increasing its output due to the decline of the commercial industry, and the result will inevitably be difficult to survive, and the workers will also be affected. In this time of crisis, it is bound to hope for economic cooperation in the financial industry. At this time, the bank is also trapped by the narrow scope of investment and is eager to seek a way to cooperate economically with the industrial and commercial industries. As a result, it must, within the scope permitted by law, pay for the purchase of raw materials for the industrial industry, so that its production increases, and the goods it produces are the collateral of the bank. When selling, it can be changed to a mortgage and entrust the bank to transfer it to other ports. At this time, the bank, in addition to the business of pledging loans and mortgages, can also make rapid progress in the two types of businesses of issuing domestic mortgage letters of credit and "discounting commercial bills of exchange". When the goods arrive at the local area, they can be changed to pledging loans, current or fixed, or another simple method can be set. Then, commerce and industry are not only not declining, but can therefore promote the progress of our country's industry. Is the financial industry itself only stable? From the various reasons mentioned above, the two reasons on which the money shop industry is based have not been fully seen, and whether a money shop law is necessary is even clearer. C. Transfer of silver between the same industry. The transfer of silver between the same industry is directly a method for the money shop industry to sort out bills, and indirectly it is actually an important tool for maintaining its fictitious silver bookkeeping. If silver is abolished, this system will also be eliminated naturally. As for the collection and payment of bills between the same industry, the clearing house will naturally rise and replace it, so there is no need for us to worry about it. Under the above-mentioned various reasons and circumstances, it is felt that the most appropriate attitude for the money shop industry at present is to suffocate and respond to the needs of the times, abandon its policy of maintaining, resolutely improve, and jointly move towards the road of a new economy. With the management experience that the money shop industry has always operated, is it not enough to jointly promote progress in the banking industry? Why is it necessary to seek only the money shop law?</p>
<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To the Editor-in-Chief: Our association previously received a letter from a sympathetic person in this city, signed "Unable to Bear to See," which was sent to the Qinglian Pavilion downstairs on Fuzhou Road. There is a street performer who uses a human-headed bird as a spectacle to collect money. In fact, he is coercing children to expose their faces and wear wings, which seems to be a child abuse trick. We should investigate and deal with it. After the association received this report, it immediately sent Guarantee Department Staff Wang to conduct a field investigation with Staff Zhang. According to the report, it seemed to be a violation of human rights, so they went to the Lǎo Zhá Police Station to consult with Supervisor Du Junhui and others to discuss solutions. As a result, Supervisor Hui ordered two detectives in plain clothes to investigate thoroughly. According to their report, the human-headed bird was indeed a child in disguise. The persons involved were all from Anhui. The law uses a reflector to cover the child's body, only exposing the face. On both sides of the face, there are already white bird wings. There are two children who take turns to perform. There is a chair to sit on during the performance, and they are each given 40 copper coins a day for pocket money, so there is no pain, etc. However, for the sake of prudence, Supervisor Hui went to the lawyer's office of the Industry Bureau with Staff Wang of the association the next day. After lawyer Gan Zhongxian showed that Article 50, Section 1 of the Criminal Law did not constitute a criminal offense, it was not banned. Later, the association still had a researchable point on the reflector, so yesterday afternoon, Director-General Wu of the association invited physicist Dr. Li Yaobang to conduct a field inspection. It was indeed true, so he was relieved. The China Child Welfare Association.</p>

<h3>Hiding the Kidnapped Victim at Ji's Bridge</h3>
<p>After Jin Anxiang was kidnapped on the 21st, the victim was initially hidden near the racecourse on Jiangwan Road.

He seized the opportunity to escape from the bandit's lair, running wildly for dozens of miles through the fields. However, Jin did not know the way. After running for a long time, he circled back to the vicinity of the bandit's lair. Around 9 AM, he knocked on the door of Qu Qingtang, the head of Yangxing Township, seeking assistance to escape the danger. After Qu inquired about the reason, he learned that Jin was a kidnapped victim who had escaped. He asked about the location of the bandit's lair. After Jin explained in detail, Qu carefully considered the information and realized that it was at Ji's Bridge, not far from his home. He told Jin this, who was greatly alarmed and begged for help.</p>
<h3>Township Head Qu Dispatches People to Escort Him</h3>
<p>Qu immediately told him that he was indeed the township head of this area and not a bandit, which slightly reassured Jin. Qu immediately invited several villagers to escort Jin to the Yangxing Public Security Substation. After Liang Yu, an officer at the substation, questioned him in detail, the substation prepared a document at 3 PM that afternoon and dispatched police officers to escort him to the Baoshan County Government. The county government then sent a letter to the Xinzha Police Station, notifying his family to retrieve Jin.</p>
<h3>Visiting to Find the Bandit's Lair</h3>
<p>After receiving the report, Baoshan County Magistrate Qiu Mingjiu immediately ordered the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau to swiftly crack down on the bandit's lair. Officer Liang of the Yangxing Substation personally led detectives to Ji's vicinity, following the situation described by the kidnapped victim, and conducted a thorough investigation. However, because the address provided by Jin was extremely vague, they had not cracked the case for many days. Until 1 PM the day before yesterday, West Detective Wadeghurst (transliteration) and Chinese Detective Tang Jian of the Public Concession brought the kidnapped victim to Yangxing to meet with Officer Liang and led the police to the bandit's lair at Ji's Bridge, following the path Jin took when he escaped. Unexpectedly, the bandit's lair turned out to be the home of Qu Qingxiang, the younger brother of Township Head Qu Qingtang.</p>
<h3>Qu Qingxiang is Finally Apprehended</h3>
<p>By the time the detectives arrived at the place, the kidnappers had already fled. Qu Qingxiang's entire family had also fled, leaving only an empty house. Officer Liang, finding nothing in the search, went to the home of Township Head Qu Qingtang and ordered Qu to hand over his brother. Qu initially did not know about his brother's involvement, so he turned pale with fright upon hearing this. Fearing being implicated by his brother, he immediately searched everywhere. It wasn't until around 4 PM that he managed to apprehend Qu Qingxiang and brought him to the Yangxing Substation, where Officer Liang interrogated him rigorously.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Trouble Due to Failure of the Money Shop</h3>
<p>According to Qu's confession, he is 35 years old, from Yuzhi Township, 31st Tu, Yangxing. He makes a living pushing a cart. He claimed that he had no prior knowledge of the kidnapping case. On the morning of April 22nd, a friend named Xue Zhaofu came to my house and said that several friends would be coming to my house in the afternoon. I asked him what it was about and what their names were. He said that they call him Jin Anxiang because he had escaped from debt due to the failure of a money shop and was temporarily avoiding trouble. I asked when they would arrive. He replied around 8 PM in the afternoon. I asked how many people there would be. He replied there would be five people in total. I asked how many of these five people you knew. He replied that he only knew Xue Zhaofu. I asked how you knew Xue. He replied I knew him when I was working in the ice factory near the Jiangwan Shooting Range. I asked what Xue did for a living. He replied that he was a teacher. I asked where he lived. He replied he lived in the temple in Baizhuang Alley, Jiangwan. I asked how many people were in his family. He replied one father, one wife, two sons, and one daughter, a total of five people. After he came to notify me, he returned home. Later, two of them also left.</p>
<h3>From Shanghai to Buy Fields</h3>
<p>Two people watched over Jin Anxiang. Afterwards, I realized that I should not allow them to live in my house. One of them was surnamed Ying, but I don't know his name. He said I live in the oil cart lane at the east gate of Jiangwan, there's nothing to worry about. And told me to go to sleep. If anyone comes and asks you where these people are from, you can say they are from Shanghai to buy fields. The other two slept with Jin Anxiang. The next morning, I was asked to cook porridge and give it to them to eat. After I cooked it and sent it to them, I pushed my cart to do business in Yangxing. When I returned home at 9 AM, I met Qu Qingtang and Jin Anxiang coming to Yangxing. After I got home, my wife said that after you pushed the cart out, Xue Zhaofu came with an unrecognized person. Seeing that Jin had escaped, their faces changed color. My wife questioned Xue Zhaofu. He said it was nothing. Afterwards, they each walked out, saying that there were important matters in Shanghai, etc.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Accomplice Xue Zhaofu</h3>
<p>After Officer Liang verified the confession, he knew that the accomplice was hiding in Jiangwan. He immediately went to Jiangwan and, together with Dai Enhong, the director of the First Precinct of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrested Xue Zhaofu at the address yesterday morning at 10 AM. He is currently being interrogated. Yesterday morning, the Qu suspect was escorted from Yangxing to the Baoshan County Government for disposition. At 2 PM yesterday afternoon, Liu Shaokui, the deputy detective of the Special Affairs Department of the Concession's General Patrol Station, prepared a document to the Baoshan County Government, requesting that he be transferred to the case for handling. County Magistrate Qiu dispatched trial officer Huang Jie to receive them. Since the crime scene was in the concession, but the case was solved within the county's jurisdiction, there should be room for discussion. The request to transfer was not granted, so the Qu suspect is still detained in the Baoshan County Government Detention Center.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial Record of the Zhao Assassination Case</h3>
<p>The Suspects Completely Deny Previous Confessions</p>
<p>No Plaintiffs Appeared</p>
<p>The murderers in the Zhao Tieqiao assassination case, Xia Shaoen, Wang Jinshan, and Cheng Haibo, were tried again by Judge Zhao yesterday morning. The official asked Xia Shaoen, "Tell the truth, who ordered you to assassinate Zhao Tieqiao?" He answered, "Wrongly accused." The official asked, "You confessed at the Public Security Bureau and also confessed three times at the Investigation Office." He answered, "The detective told me to say that." The official asked, "Aren't you a child?" He answered, "I was afraid of him." The official asked, "Didn't you say that Cheng Haibo was involved?" He answered, "I don't know him." The official asked, "If you didn't kill him, why did you go to Anhui?" He answered, "Because I was sick." The official asked, "What was the doctor's name?" He answered, "Surname Liang, I don't know his given name." The official asked, "When did you go to Anhui?" He answered, "I left on the tenth day of June and arrived in Wuhu in two days, and then arrived in Hefei in two days, staying at my sister's house, and then at my cousin Shao Yi's house in September. I was arrested four days later at my wife's uncle's house." The official asked, "When did you get sick?" He answered, "Either in the first month or in the twelfth month." The official said, "You don't even remember the day you got sick, which shows that you are talking nonsense and being cunning." The official then asked Wang Jinshan, "Do you know Xia Shaoen?" He answered, "I didn't know him before. Last spring, he sold vegetables and often passed my house. Because we are from the same village, we got to know each other." The official asked, "Did you order Xia Shaoen to kill Zhao Tieqiao?" He answered, "No." The official asked, "You have confessed in the Public Security Bureau and the Procuratorate before." He answered, "No." The official asked, "According to Xia Shaoen, you gave him a pistol and had him kill Zhao Tieqiao, and you sent him to Nanjing?" He answered, "No." The official asked, "Did you say it was Wang Zhongru's idea, and that Chiang Kai-shek also went?" He answered, "No." The official asked, "How much money did you give Xia Shaoen?" He answered, "None." The official asked, "Didn't you say you gave him two hundred and fifty yuan?" He answered, "That didn't happen." The official asked, "What time did you go to the China Merchants Bureau that day?" He answered, "No." The official asked, "You confessed to the prosecutor that you were five minutes late and had been beaten?" He answered, "No, I was wearing a white jacket and pants. I also confessed at the prosecutor's office." He answered, "No, I was wearing a white jacket and pants." The official said, "You've changed after waiting a few days in the detention center." Then he asked Cheng Haibo, "Did you assassinate Zhao Tieqiao?" He answered, "No." The official asked, "Did Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jinshan talk to you?" He answered, "I went to Anhui on April 16th." The official asked, "Do you know Xia Shaoen?" He answered, "I don't know him." The official asked, "Wang Zhongru and Chiang Kai-shek?" He answered, "I don't know them." The official asked, "Aren't they all from your village?" He answered, "There are hundreds of thousands of fellow villagers in Shanghai, I can't know them all." The official asked, "Is Wang Jinshan your tenant?" He answered, "Yes." At this point, since the plaintiffs Zhao Huang Shenyi and Zhao Tiejian, and other witnesses, had not appeared, the official ordered a postponement for another trial. The defendants were all returned to custody.</p>
<h3>A Key Suspect in the Murder of a Female Guest Suddenly Surrenders</h3>
<p>Claims to Have Absolutely Nothing to Do with the Woman's Death</p>
<p>But the Police Are Still Charging Him with Murder</p>
<p>Wang Desheng, who stayed at room number 33 of the Sanjiang Hotel at numbers 12 and 13, Beihai Road, at around 2 PM on the 22nd of last month with a woman named Zhang, left alone the next morning. Afterwards, the bellboy Pei Songlin noticed that the woman had been murdered. He reported it to the police. The details of the inspection by the Special District Court have already been published in the newspapers. The day before yesterday afternoon, Wang Desheng suddenly surrendered to the Zhabei Police Station. The detective found out that Wang's real name was Chen Quanlong from Songjiang. Wang Desheng was his alias. The deceased's real name was Song Azhen, from Fengjing, only 18 years old. She was his mistress, etc. He was immediately taken into custody and escorted away yesterday morning.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>At the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Special District Court, the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated the case, saying that the defendant confessed to the police that he and the deceased went to the Sanjiang Hotel at around 4 PM that afternoon, and left together until 11 PM in the evening. Not long after, he left alone, leaving the woman in the room to go somewhere to smoke opium. He returned to the room at 2:30 AM and saw that the woman had died on the floor. He then picked her up and put her on the bed, covering her with a quilt. Fearing that he would be found guilty, he sneaked out at 3 AM and returned to Songjiang, telling his family and surrendering to the police, etc. However, according to the defendant's confession, there are suspicious points, and it is not reliable. The detective had previously investigated and saw that the deceased was lying on the bed, with her hands exposed outside the quilt. She was only wearing a tight-fitting vest and shorts, and had no belt. Why would she take off her clothes and belt to commit suicide? Therefore, the police are prosecuting the defendant for murder in accordance with Article 282 of the Criminal Law. Then, Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui explained the situation, saying, I went to investigate and saw that the deceased was wearing a short vest, with a belt wrapped around her neck, deeply penetrating the skin, blood flowing from her mouth, and blood stains on the pillow. I presented the belt for inspection. The bellboy Pei Songlin also testified that the defendant did leave at 7 AM on the 23rd, and told him that he was going out to visit friends. The woman was still sleeping and should not be woken up, etc. After Chief Judge Zhou Hanting questioned the defendant, he ordered him to be returned to custody and retried at a later date.</p>
<h3>Woman Sues for Division of Inheritance</h3>
<p>Qiao Mingzhu Fights for Her Due Rights</p>
<p>Her Elder Brother and Uncle Ignore Her</p>
<p>Pengsan Hopes for a Peaceful Agreement</p>
<p>The Judge Also Believes that Reconciliation is Best</p>
<p>Qiao Mingzhu is the daughter of the deceased Qiao Rangmu. She is in her early twenties and has not yet married. She currently resides at the YWCA on Dixiwei Road. Recently, she has been involved in a lawsuit with her elder brother Qiao Shutian over inheritance, leading to sibling discord and causing embarrassment. Rangmu was known for his wealth, and he had four children: Meng, Zhong, and Shu are all sons, and Mingzhu is the youngest. In the fourteenth year, Rangmu passed away, leaving an inheritance of 240,000 gold, all managed by the eldest son Shutian, which was never divided. Shutian, since his father's death, has been stingy and unwilling to provide the necessary living and educational expenses for his younger sister. At that time, Mingzhu hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to send a letter to Shutian, requesting an equal division so that she could manage her own share. Shutian hired lawyer Zhu Sifu and replied, promising Mingzhu's claim for division, but said that it could only be jointly negotiated and carried out after Pengsan returned from the United States. Pengsan is Shutian's third younger brother and Mingzhu's third elder brother. Now that he has returned home after completing his studies in the New World, Mingzhu has reiterated her request, urging Shutian to disclose the types and amounts of the estate and clear the accounts. However, Shutian turned a deaf ear and ignored her. After applying to the Special District Court for mediation, he repeatedly refused to be summoned and did not make any concrete statements. Mingzhu, seeing that her brother's intentions were nothing more than to delay and evade, entrusted lawyer Jiang Yiping to represent her and filed a lawsuit with the Special Court, requesting that Qiao Shutian be ordered to appear in court and be ordered to hand over all of Rangmu's property, to be divided into three parts, with her receiving 80,000 yuan to manage herself. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenyong opened the court and summoned the trial. The defendant Qiao Shutian did not appear and was represented by Pengsan. Lawyer Jiang first stated the plaintiff's intention to sue. Then Qiao Pengsan stated his claims, generally saying that they are siblings, and the younger sister can negotiate a peaceful agreement for inheritance rights, why must they fight each other and harm each other. He had previously advised the plaintiff to wait a little longer, so that he would have the opportunity to gather relatives and make proper arrangements. If they must be calculating and insist on certain prejudices, it would be contrary to the friendship between siblings. Wouldn't the plaintiff understand that they had suddenly become involved in a lawsuit. Now, he can only ask for a postponement, so as to reconcile outside the court. Judge Xu also believed that reconciliation was the best way to resolve the case, so as to avoid hurting feelings. He then approved the postponement. If reconciliation ultimately fails, the trial will resume.</p>
<h3>A Bride Becomes a Widow in One Day</h3>
<p>Why Marry a Wife When the Son is Seriously Ill?</p>
<p>Harming Others and Oneself, the Old Man is Confused</p>
<p>Filing for Separation is Justified</p>
<p>Zhu Fenglin, daughter of Zhu Zhang, a farmer in Baiyangzhai, Liuhang Township, Baoshan County, is of marriageable age and has a beautiful appearance. Since childhood, she was promised to marry A Mao, the son of Yin Fusheng, a villager of Maqiaozhai, Dachang Township, through the matchmaker Xu Jinquan. However, A Mao was short in stature and underdeveloped. Zhu Zhang was informed of this later and negotiated with the original matchmaker Xu Jinquan, demanding that the marriage be dissolved, but to no avail. Furthermore, it was heard that Yin A Mao was ill. Unexpectedly, Yin Fusheng, because his son's illness was serious, chose to complete the wedding on the 24th day of the first month of the lunar calendar last year. Fearing that the woman's family would know that the groom was sick and would not agree to the marriage, he tied the groom to the cart and had the original matchmaker push the cart to meet the mother-in-law. Zhang had no choice but to agree and immediately ordered her daughter to board the sedan. At that time, Fenglin was still in her boudoir. When the sedan arrived at the man's house, just as she came out of the sedan, the groom was holding the wedding ceremony. The groom's face had turned pale and he could barely support himself. The ceremony was quickly completed and she was sent to the bridal chamber. The groom went to bed, while the bride was sitting and waiting by the wedding candles, when she heard that the groom had died. Therefore, the bride suddenly became a widow. At that time, she immediately removed the red and gold and silver accessories from her head, changed to bone hairpins, and took off her red shirt and red skirt, changing into white mourning clothes. The next day, his father-in-law Yin Fusheng, due to lack of funeral expenses, wanted to pawn the bride's dowry clothes. Because the bride was unwilling, an argument arose. From then on, there were constant disagreements between the father-in-law and daughter-in-law. On the 20th day of the second month of the lunar calendar this year, when the bride returned from her mother's house, she saw that the bedding on the bed had disappeared. When she asked her parents-in-law, another dispute arose. The bride then filed a complaint with the Baoshan County Government, alleging abuse, etc. After County Magistrate Qiu approved it, he ordered both parties to be summoned. Yesterday, Trial Officer Huang held a hearing. The plaintiff Zhu Fenglin appeared in court, demanding that she be separated from her father-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship and regain her freedom, etc. She also testified that last year, Yin Fusheng had no intention of marrying at all, and her mother was also unwilling to let her marry immediately. This kind of evil relationship was all caused by the original matchmaker Xu Jinquan, etc. Because the defendants Yin Fusheng and Xu Jinquan did not appear in court, the judge ordered a retrial after further summons. After the order was completed, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Special District Court Burns Various Narcotics</h3>
<p>Mostly Opium and Opium Paste</p>
<p>It Took Two Hours to Turn to Ashes</p>
<p>The Special District Court, in accordance with regulations, gathers and publicly burns all kinds of prohibited narcotics confiscated in cases every three months to clear procedures. From January to March this year, the accumulated confiscated opium, morphine, red pills, heroin, cocaine, and other items were again quite numerous. Among them, opium and opium paste were the most abundant. The court president Yang Zhaoyun submitted it to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Ministry of Justice for approval. It was decided to publicly burn them at the Yizhongdi of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, south of the Special Court, at 2 PM yesterday afternoon. Letters were sent in advance to various Party, government, and military agencies, as well as the Bar Association, the Bureau of Works, and other Chinese and Western groups in the city, inviting them to send representatives to observe. It was raining lightly during the burning. President Yang and Chief Prosecutor Zhou specially dispatched several judges and prosecutors to the scene to supervise the staff to burn them, and bailiffs were on site to maintain order. It took more than two hours for the narcotics to turn to ashes. This is the fourth time since the establishment of the Special Court that narcotics have been burned.</p>
<h3>Japanese Car Causes Accident</h3>
<p>Offends the Public, Unable to Escape</p>
<p>Sent to the Police Station, Awaiting Trial</p>
<p>A certain Japanese person residing at number 83 Kunshan Road, at around 2 PM the day before yesterday afternoon, was driving his own car (license plate number M/C246) past Hongkou Park. At that time, Japanese expatriates were celebrating the Emperor's Birthday in the park, and some Chinese people were standing on the sidewalk outside the park to watch. The Japanese person drove carelessly and crashed directly onto the sidewalk, knocking down a certain Chinese person and injuring his chest. The Japanese person, seeing that he had caused an accident, tried to escape. He was surrounded by spectators who refused to let him go and argued with him. The Japanese person, knowing that he was in the wrong, tried to bribe his way out of the crime. The spectators were very dissatisfied. Later, after the patrol arrived, the Japanese person and the injured person were taken to the police station. The detective ordered the injured person to be sent to the hospital for treatment and ordered the Japanese person to report to the police station at 2 AM on the second day for questioning.</p>
<h3>Yinghu Township Head Accused of Dismissal</h3>
<p>Wang Yunzhi, the head of Yinghu Township, District 1, Minhang County, was recently accused by Jiang Honggen and other villagers of Qin Zhiyinghu and other townships in a petition to the county government, accusing Wang of extorting money from the people and embezzling public funds. County Magistrate Yan ordered the district office to investigate and reply. Subsequently, District Chief Wu found out that the township head Wang Yunzhi extorted dozens of yuan from villagers Guo Guiquan and He Qiansheng for marrying widows. Also, when the township built a wooden bridge, he altered the wood merchant's invoices to commit fraud. After receiving the reply, County Magistrate Yan believed that Wang, as the township head, had acted in such a way and was extremely unlawful. Therefore, yesterday, he issued an order to dismiss Wang and ordered the district chief to select impartial personnel to report for appointment. At the same time, he hurried to carry out the township elections. Wang Yunzhi was ordered to hand over all the embezzled funds and allocate them to charity.</p>
<h3>Doubts about the Xu Chen Murder Case</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Wu Shixin Orders Qiao Fusheng to be Detained</p>
<p>In the house opposite the Minli Middle School, Dananmen, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, this port</p>
<p>In the case of the woman Xu Chen being strangled to death with a rope by bandits in the middle of the night a few days ago, Wu Shixin, the prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court, found that Qiao Fusheng, who was mentioned in various newspapers after Xu Chen's death, was closely related to this case. Moreover, it was found that when Xu Chen was killed, there were two clothing boxes in the room, which were carried out of the room by the bandits, and the clothes were thrown all over the floor after opening the boxes, which clearly showed that it could not have been committed by one person. Moreover, there were two children (around ten years old) living in the same room in the deceased's room. When the family members requested an autopsy the next day, they requested to be exempted from the autopsy. All kinds of doubts should be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, yesterday morning, he ordered the judicial police chief to supervise the police to arrest Qiao Fusheng, the son of the former local leader Qiao Zhishan, for the case. After investigation by Prosecutor Wu, he ordered the police to send Qiao to the detention center for temporary detention, pending a detailed investigation, and then proceed with the review.</p>
<h3>Responsibility Issues for Hitting and Killing a Woman</h3>
<p>Streetcar Driver and Collapsed Cart Driver Each Hold Their Own Views</p>
<p>Dahe Coal Company, No. 109 Longmen Road, Public Concession, used a collapsed cart to load coal at 9 AM on the 17th of last month. The cart drivers Xu Baoxing, Chen Sanjin, and Wang Jinfa pulled it to the intersection of Dongxinqiao Caishi Street in the French Concession. At that time, a French streetcar driven by Luo Bingzhang was coming from south to north. They were unable to avoid each other in time and collided. At that time, the collapsed cart hit and injured Teng Gu, a Suzhou woman who was buying vegetables, injuring her waist and causing her to faint and fall to the ground. After the patrol arrived, recorded the number, and sent the car to Renji Hospital, she died after ineffective treatment. After reporting the incident, Judge Zhu verified that it was true and ordered the corpse to be coffined and waiting for verification. Yesterday, the police sent both parties to the French Public Hall for questioning. First, the collapsed cart drivers Xu Baoxing, Chen Sanjin, and Wang Jinfa all said that they were ordered by the store to pull the collapsed cart to deliver goods outside and were walking through the Dongxinqiao Caishi Street intersection. At that time, both sides of the road were vegetable vendors. At that time, the streetcar drove from the south and the people couldn't get out of the way in time, so they abandoned the car and ran away empty-handed, so that the streetcar slammed into the collapsed cart, and the collapsed cart was hit by the streetcar and hit the deceased, which is true. The witness Zhao Yingbao Wang Aqingsupplied the same statement. After the son of the plaintiff corpse, Teng Shisheng, attorney Fei Xizhen, stated that the situation of the deceased being hit has been clarified and does not need to be mentioned further. However, after investigating, the plaintiff's mother had always worked as a helper in Dongnanlou and went out to buy vegetables in the morning, and was injured and killed by the negligence of the streetcar driver and the collapsed cart driver at the vegetable market street intersection. The defendants are indeed difficult to evade, and requested a trial in addition to seeking private compensation of 5,000 yuan. The defendant streetcar company driver Luo Bingzhang, represented by attorney Bahe, stated that the location of Dongxinqiao Caishi Street has always been narrow, and in addition, there are renovations in the place in recent times, and the streetcar driver was driving very slowly at the time, and it was caused by the collapsed cart driver's carelessness to hit and injure the deceased, which is the fault of the collapsed cart driver and has nothing to do with my client, please investigate clearly. Judge Zhu ordered a review of the decision.</p>
<h3>Morning Light Art Exhibition Adds Exhibits</h3>
<p>The 5th Exhibition of the Chenguang Art Association opened on the 25th of last month at the Shanghai Art School of the Tiantong Temple on Jiangwan Road, and will last until the 3rd of this month. Visitors have been coming in droves for days, with thousands of people. It is heard that the Japanese are paying particular attention, and the number of visitors accounts for a quarter of the Chinese. Many Japanese journalists have copied all the titles of the exhibits on the floor. The exhibits of this association are quite descriptive of revolutionary deeds and national shame. There are also some expressions of proletarian painting. The Japanese have always paid close attention to international relations and emerging literary and artistic ideas. The members of the association in the capital have newly sent many descriptions of the new construction of the capital, such as "Central Party Headquarters", "Central Meteorological Observatory", "Zhongshan Road", "Zhongshan Gate", "Ministry of Railways" and other works, which have also been added to the exhibition, so the number of visitors is even more enthusiastic. There are still two days left in the current session.</p>
