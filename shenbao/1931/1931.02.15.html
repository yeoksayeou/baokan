<p>陳氏之蜚聲全國。其功績實在於漢口英租界之收回。時與陳折衝樽爼者。爲英國之參贊阿瑪利氏。議定後。即待雙方簽字。詎翌日陳與阿瑪利會見時。突拒絕簽字。蓋英國軍艦數艘開泊江干。陳氏認爲不满也。阿旋令軍艦撤退。議始成。當時各國無不聞訊色變。譽之爲鐵腕外交家。而百餘年來弱國無外交之中國。竟得揚眉吐氣。國人之同情於陳氏。從可知矣。</p>
<p>當寗案發生後。各國公使。會商對付我國。於是以公使團名義提出抗議。時陳猶在位。得抗議書後曰。彼整個而謀我。我當分化之。於是分别答復。其措詞亦輕重不同。果也奏效如神。各國均紛紛單獨與我國謀妥協。不幸陳以時局變化而去位。事遂中擱。惜哉。</p>

<p>綠·珠·</p>
<p>金陵自古名城。有龍蟠虎踞之稱。國民政府奠爲首都後。僡形矞皇典麗。凡百建設。亦已次第進行。最近更有興造花園住宅區之擬議。是則羅馬巴黎不得専美於前矣。茲將首都興造花園住宅區之緣起計劃等項。分述於次。</p>
<p>緣起　南京市當局以爲市内人口日有加增。住宅缺乏。現有樓宇。多在城南一帶。而自下關訖於鼓樓間。逶迤十餘里。居戶寥落。頗形荒凉。自應力求開發。以資繁盛。又爲整理市制。改良住宅。及繁榮下關至鼓樓等處之市面起見。迺有興造花園住宅區之必要。</p>
<p>計劃　就大方巷古林寺一帶。分區興造花園住宅。每一區之面積。約自四百畝至五百畝之間。求其有林泉之勝。而城中之喧擾。區内土地。除公用者外。均准私人繳價承領。並得依照規定樣式。興造新式住宅。如是。首都之蔚然大觀備矣。</p>
<p>步驟　現在首先着手第一區之興造。計占地六百畝。位於三牌樓中山路之西。鼓樓之北。地點旣稱適中。地勢亦復高峻。一經開闢馬路。與中山路幹綫相銜接。行駛公共汽車。交通自屬便利。第一區完成後。再繼續推廣。使將來衡宇相望。如入藝術之塲。其最大之目的。固不僅解紓居住困難已也。</p>
<p>佈置　每區之興造。除照規定樣式外。並建公共園亭。愉資行樂。辦理公共學校。以重敎育。其它如運動塲游戲場中央大會堂等等。無不力求完備。其最重大之工程設備。即按戶裝設自來水。現在着手之第一區。尤注意於公共園亭之建設。務使區内林木繁殖。田園花竹彌望皆是。居斯地者。大有城市山林之槪。將來推廣至第二三區。則依山築路。住宅就山腰建築。風景尤爲幽蒨。不啻爲瑞士之縮影云</p>

<p>自六合展覽及蜜蜂社消寒會次兩展覽後。海上愛美者。頗屬自葉渭莘氏作品。渭辛所作。山水花草。流利融渾。無寒乞相。無鄙倍思。洵爲清才。蓋氏旣秉先德指發先生之敎。又與一亭堇叔諸老輩游。宜其一日千里。兩次會中所陳。如大幅山水。愚曾爲一詩張之。又柳燕白貓諸幀。皆各極雋遠渾茫之致。扇面諸屏。尤經百練。自非凡響。平居論畫。氏嘗側重靑藤。而不以白陽爲然。故其畫矯健處。乃類靑藤。然白陽託興之淡遠。用筆之簡斂。宜爲畫人所不廢。則絢爛之後。歸於平淡。渭　方年少。自不必斤斤學此而久後必知白陽之長。可斷言也。海上畫家。傖俗無論矣。其有矯絕塵者。每有清而不雄。超而不沈。直而不曲。枯而不潤之失。渭辛雄矣潤矣。能於揮灑時。力求沈著頓挫之致。則其造詣。何可限量。吾爲此文。又不特僅爲吾黨張目已也。。還質渭辛。或不河漢斯言。（未蓋章）</p>

<p>蝦餅。先以生猪油入小石臼中搗爛。（石臼新者有石屑。不可用。）乃以小蝦去壳。取蝦仁入臼中同搗。再加入鷄蛋數枚。（連黃打碎。）又鹽及陳酒少許。（如蝦一斤。用猪油一兩。鷄蛋二枚。鹽一小匙。多則類推。（打匀後。置入手中。揉成圓式。旋做旋投入冷水鍋中。俟做好後。再入火煑沸。即取起。連湯收貯。如天冷。可藏多日不壞。如須炸食。做時即入油鍋中。煑至淺黃色取起。蘸焦鹽或辣醬油食。或再用冬菰冬笋黃芽菜等同煑食。</p>
<p>魚圓。以靑魚（白魚亦可。）去皮骨。用刀背搗爛。再以刀口吹細。加入熟猪油。鷄蛋靑。（先打透。）菱粉。（水調。）鹽及陳酒少許。）如大靑魚一尾。帮蛋靑六七枚。餘酌用。）同杵至細膩爲度。揉成圓形。旋做旋投入冷水鍋中。再煑沸取起。連湯收貯。</p>

<p>九月一號。印度友人ＮＡＧＡＨＷＡＬＴＥ邀食印度飯。厥名拿戈瓦弟。意爲龍也。又證道會秘書拿戈拿通亦龍之意。萬慧師語我。君於印度已得二龍矣尙不知耶。余問印人多以龍名乎。如昔者龍樹。萬曰。大抵以龍名者。當爲好奇之人。平常人亦少以名也。拿戈瓦弟爲一美術家。作畫吟詩。獨身十年矣。長英文。而素食。二龍及印學生索食者多。據醫博士周光贊久於印者。言印人旅館飯店素食者遍地皆是。世界上人性善者算印人也。是日與拿戈氏先飲印度咖啡。其味甜於中國式。余不慣飲之。印人杯多用黃銅。其飲法殊可異。彼非如我惟杯就唇而飲者。乃一定如鳥之仰其項。而以杯中茶水自然灌於口中。此一定之習慣。拿戈語我。印人飲水杯。决不與唇接。乃仰而灌入故也。余常見印人飲。殊未注意。今如其敎。乃時時察之。拿戈之言不誣也。旣入飯店。純素無葷物。其食法用方塊蕉葉。舖於桌上。乃置飯菜於上。有玉蜀黍及辣菜葱。蓋忌葷而尙辛辣品。不用　而爲我特設勺义。如西餐所用。印人當然以手進食。依如法顯侢所言。有一事應注意。印人各食。各人不可以器觸他人食物。爲大不敬。不獨食物爲然。凡用具器物如烟袋茶杯布等。切不可輕以手觸之。有時一人買物。未買妥而以手觸之。遂致賠償云。但以我所見。在緬甸之印商。尙未有此俗也。余食其飯。因其蕉葉上亦頗有香味。二人一餐。凡十四安拿。未满一元。不算貴。然比中餐亦不賤也。中餐在此地者如我日在美珍飯店所食。每餐三安拿。茶甚佳矣。余近亦不敢勸人素食。因出門素食。甚不便也。印度人生活簡單。思想高尙。故甘地之復古派學術。乃能大放光明。據人云。甘地之苦行無抵抗。亦惟印人能從之。若他國民則不能也。由來人文生於地文。余以此言爲然。將來至印度。須察其地理所生之文化也。</p>

<h3 id="e36">India and the Jews <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Jews have a movement to restore their nation, and the Indians have a movement for self-reliance. Both are now making rapid progress. Although the Jewish people are scattered among various countries, they all have the ability to establish their own power. What they lack is a unified territory. Now, their efforts to restore their nation are aimed at establishing a foothold in their homeland. According to a letter from British Prime Minister MacDonald, the British government is paying close attention to the Arab people who are being displaced by the Jews and have no permanent occupation or land. The British government wants to determine as soon as possible what kind of land can be used as a settlement for the Jews. All land acquisition and transfer must be under a centralized management. Jewish leader Weizmann then said that he believed that the time had come for renewed cooperation with Britain. Therefore, the movement for the restoration of the Jewish nation has a very promising future.</p>
<p>As for India's pursuit of self-reliance, it differs from that of the Jews. The Indians originally had a vast territory, but they lacked political power, which was controlled by others. Now, because of the Indian self-reliance movement, the British Round Table Conference has been created. It is now reported that Gandhi, leader of the National Congress, has a proposal to suspend the non-violent resistance movement and to assist in the unfinished work of the Round Table Conference. There are four conditions in total, mostly for the amnesty of political prisoners and the cessation of various oppressive actions, as well as an investigation into the conduct of the police during previous conflicts, all of which are relatively easy to do. However, one condition, the freedom to inspect liquor stores and foreign cloth stores, may be problematic. Nevertheless, India's prospects for self-reliance are also very promising.</p>

<p>Paris dispatch: The French Royalist Party still exists. Its members all regard the Duke of Guise, currently residing in Belgium, as the future head of state of France. Recently, the party has been very active because of next year's presidential election, and various factions are already actively preparing. According to the party's observations, the Communist Party will win an overwhelming majority in the election, causing great turmoil in the labor sector. The Royalist Party can then take the opportunity to launch an uprising, overthrow the government, and establish a monarchy. The party is secretly planning to divide Paris into several war zones, organizing 20,000 members from various locations into several teams, all under the command of a trained military officer. If anything happens, an order can be issued immediately to summon them. The party has already obtained the Duke of Guise's consent and is preparing for him to return to the country and assume the throne after its members occupy the government.

<p>British Prime Minister's Letter to Jewish Leader to Remove Misunderstandings</p>
<p>National News, Moscow, 13th: The Soviet authorities have newly established a Jewish administrative region in Crimea, named the Freidorf Region, which includes fifteen Jewish village soviets, two German village soviets, and eighteen mixed village soviets. Jewish farmers account for half of the population in the area, so the authorities have specially established the administrative region to show respect for ethnic minorities and to prevent the Zionist movement from emigrating.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: British Prime Minister MacDonald sent a letter to Weizmann, the leader of the Zionist movement, to dispel misunderstandings about the British policy on Palestine as outlined in last October's White Paper. It roughly stated that the British government is paying close attention to the landless Arabs who have been displaced by the Jews and have no permanent jobs. The British government wants to determine as soon as possible what kind of property can be used as a Jewish settlement. All land acquisition and transfer must have a centralized management until the development plan is established on a solid foundation. The British government recognizes that the Jewish Agency can absolutely prioritize the employment of Jews to manage projects funded by Jewish capital, but if unemployment becomes serious, Britain, as the trustee, will of course have to reconsider this matter. Weizmann now claims that he believes that the time has come to cooperate with Britain again and hopes that the Jews can continue to carry out economic work in Palestine.</p>

<p>Anti-Government Faction Very Active</p>
<p>Hamaguchi Likely to Come Forward Early</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: As a result of last night's cabinet meeting on countermeasures against the House of Peers, the government believes that it will be difficult to overcome the difficulties in the House of Peers unless Prime Minister Hamaguchi attends the parliament. Therefore, they all advocated that Prime Minister Hamaguchi should attend the parliament immediately. The government's view of the parliament is that no matter how the opposition parties attack with the so-called "first-stage strategy" in the House of Representatives, it can be stopped with absolute majority power. However, the anti-government faction's activities in the House of Peers are quite organized and are progressing daily. The momentum for impeaching the government on the grounds of overestimating revenue and military preparations is increasing daily. In particular, regarding the problem of Foreign Minister Shidehara's gaffe, the voices demanding that Prime Minister Hamaguchi attend the parliament are rising. Judging from the recent situation, there has been a sudden deterioration. The government seems to be implementing Prime Minister Hamaguchi’s earlier attendance in parliament, to sweep away this unpopularity, is the best policy. Therefore, it was decided that Adachi and Eki would visit the Prime Minister in the next few days to state the above matters and discuss the timing of the Prime Minister's attendance. It is reported that the Prime Minister's attendance is scheduled for around the 22nd or 23rd.</p>

After passing the House of Representatives, it will be handed over to the House of Peers to hold a budget meeting for further review. The House of Peers and the government faction plan to launch a fierce attack on the government regarding important issues. The chairman of the budget committee, Lin Hakutaro, belongs to the government faction, but most of the section chiefs of each subcommittee are anti-government figures. The fate of the budget is also not very optimistic. Japan Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Kinya questioned at the third budget subcommittee: (1) Is the drastic reduction in Japan's trade with China the result of the sharp drop in silver prices? Is there any countermeasure for this matter? (2) Does the government have any intention of convening an international conference to reform the Chinese currency? Finance Minister Inoue replied that due to India's silver disposal and China's currency reform, the accumulation of silver in Shanghai has become an unprecedented amount. Therefore, the sharp drop in silver prices cannot be prevented. As for the reform of China's currency system, it is generally expected by all countries, but currency reform is very difficult, so there is no intention to convene an international conference.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>From Nanchang: For the Attention of All Newspapers. Zhang Huizan, commander of the 18th Division of the Army, led two brigades on the 20th day of the 12th month of the 19th year, in a bloody battle against the entire five armies of the communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang at Longgang, Jiangxi, for an entire day. Because there was no support, and resources depleted, he fell into the den of the bandits. This month during winter days, sentries of the 77th Division of the National Army discovered, at the Gan River in Ji'an, a wooden box containing a human head, marked with the name of Commander Zhang. It was identified as genuine by former subordinates and relatives. Furthermore, soldiers who escaped from the bandit side reported that, after Commander Zhang's capture, the bandit leaders Zhu and Mao threatened and enticed him, but he remained steadfast and unyielding. They tortured him all day long, but the bandits were helpless. So, on the 28th of last month, they decided to cut off his tongue and kill him. The cruelty was extreme. Zhang, the late commander, studied military science in his youth and immediately showed unusual talent. He studied in Japan and Germany, always remembering his motherland, and always regarded revolution as his duty. He initially followed the late Director Tan, participating in strategy, and then engaged in the anti-Yuan campaign with General Cai E, providing much assistance. Subsequently, he served as commander and brigade commander, participating in every battle, never boasting of his merits. In the 11th year of the Republic, he resigned and went to Shanghai, uniting with comrades in the party, recruiting talents and heroes, and secretly planning. Then, he followed the late Generalissimo and Director, went to Guangdong, and held military positions. In every battle, he took the lead. In the 15th year of the Republic, he launched a major northern expedition, serving as the commander of the 4th Division of the 2nd Army, driving through the southeastern provinces, fighting hundreds of battles, shedding much blood, and being filled with excitement. In particular, in the North River and East River in Guangdong, and in Xinyu, Luzhou, Nanchang in Jiangxi, and Yisha and Guandimen in western Hubei, he was most famous for using the few to defeat the many and reverse the overall situation. Detailed accounts are recorded in the Battle Records of the Second Army in the Northern Expedition. After the National Army was reorganized, he continued to serve in his current position. Since being stationed in Jiangxi, due to frequent incidents in the Central Plains, deployments have been frequent. He only had the strength of one division to defend dozens of counties in Jiangxi. The situation was isolated and dangerous, but he never retreated. Last July, his troops went to Hunan to suppress the rebellion. The bandit troops of Zhu and Mao took the opportunity to attack Nanchang. Commander Zhang personally supervised the division's directly affiliated team, building fortifications day and night, using only a small part of the Wang brigade to defend the city. The bandit troops were forced to retreat. All of this is something that people have repeatedly praised. Commander Zhang often said that soldiers have the duty to defend the party and the country. The communist bandits have long been a problem for the party and the country. Killing one more bandit is equivalent to removing one more harm for the party and the country. Limited by circumstances, he was unable to eliminate them, but he was determined to die early. Therefore, since receiving the order to encircle and suppress them, he has been brave and went straight ahead. In this battle with the bandits at Longgang, although he knew the disparity in numbers, he vowed not to retreat. According to his usual detailed plans for suppression, none of them failed to hit the key points. However, before the plan could be implemented, he bravely went forward to his death, exhausting his strength and mind, sacrificing his life for righteousness. His remains could not be found, but his spirit returned home first. His tongue was cut off but his integrity will forever be commemorated. His death was tragic. In addition to reporting to the central government for preferential treatment to comfort his soul, we are hereby acting on the order of the Ninth Route Army Commander, establishing a funeral office in the headquarters of the 18th Division in Nanchang, and choosing a date for a public memorial service. If you are willing to send elegiac couplets and sacrificial offerings, please send them to our office in Nanchang for receipt. The Funeral Office for the Late Commander Zhang of the 18th Division of the Army.</p>

<p>He Yingqin Orders Strict Prevention of Female Bandits Colluding</p>
<p>After Requesting Instructions, Ruan Zhaochang Has Returned to His Defensive Position</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: National Government Chairman Chiang has learned that the bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, Fang, Shao, Kong, Li, He, and Kuang have been rampaging through the borders of Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, burning, killing, looting, and employing extremely cruel methods. If they are to be fundamentally eradicated, military force alone is insufficient. He has now issued a telegram to the various bandit-suppression units in the four regions, ordering them to act in accordance with the methods of treating the symptoms and the root causes, as well as exposing those in the military who collude with the communist bandits. After receiving the telegram, Jiangxi and Shandong have forwarded it to the various units in Jiangxi to be followed. At the same time, Director He, based on the report from Jiang Jianren of the Propaganda Brigade, learned that the Communist Party has dispatched many young female bandits who are going out to seduce the military. He requested that this be strictly prevented. After receiving the report, He immediately sent a telegram to the three route commanders Lu, Zhu, and Jiang, as well as to Supervisor Wang (Jinyu), ordering them to strictly prevent this. The telegrams are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Commander Lu: In accordance with Chairman Chiang’s telegram instructing the treatment of the symptoms and root causes of bandit suppression: (1) The military should strive to suppress the bandits to treat the symptoms, but it is especially important for the party, government, and military to cooperate in publicizing our party’s ideology, uniting the masses, and thoroughly clearing the villages to treat the root causes. (2) In addition to striving to suppress the communist bandits, the military should strictly abide by discipline, actively appease the masses, and absolutely prohibit disturbing the local population. (3) The military should not be satisfied with merely driving away the communist bandits or recovering cities. They should continue to pursue and suppress them until the remnants are completely annihilated. (4) Officers and soldiers are strictly prohibited from going out and carousing. The telegram also stated: It has been found that in areas such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Anhui, and Fujian, the communist bandit forces are actually weak, and their methods are extremely treacherous. On the one hand, they advocate communism to deceive the masses, and on the other hand, they secretly hide their names to confuse the military and the people, disrupting the local area. After that, any communist bandits who come to agitate our military, whether at the sentry line or in the military, our officers and soldiers who can expose and solve the case will be rewarded with 100 yuan. If they can arrest a communist bandit with concrete evidence on the spot, they will be rewarded with 200 yuan. Those with more serious circumstances will be rewarded separately. However, prisoners of war are not included in this rule and must not be falsely reported. I will issue another order separately. I am sending this telegram in advance, hoping that you will immediately forward it to all subordinate troops down to the lowest-ranking soldiers, so that they may all be informed.</p>
<p>Telegram from Director He: To Commander Lu Yong’an, Commander Zhu Yimin, Commander Jiang Jingran, Supervisor Wang Xiangting, and Division Commander Ruan Shaowen: Secretly, according to the report from Jiang Jianren of the Propaganda Brigade, and according to the confessions of female bandits who have been captured, the Communist Party has recently dispatched a large number of young and beautiful female bandits to the garrisons of our various armies to carry out seduction work, either disguised as various small vendors, or cooking and washing clothes for the soldiers, and even sacrificing their bodies to lure them. Once a relationship develops, they say that they were captured by the communist bandits and only managed to escape back. They also say that communist bandit officers and soldiers can all receive 20 yuan per month, and the treatment of prisoners is excellent. Those who surrender a rifle can get 30 to 50 yuan, and those who do not want to stay will be given travel expenses. It has been found that the communist bandits' intentions to seduce are irresistible. I hope that you will immediately forward this to your subordinates and take strict precautions. Gengchen, He Yingqin.</p>
<p>Ruan Zhaochang, commander of the 55th Division, and his troops are currently stationed in the Fuliang, Jingdezhen, Raozhou, and Duchang areas, with the division headquarters located in Leping. Director Ruan came to the province on the 6th to meet Director He, report on the progress of the war, the bandit situation in various defensive areas, and request instructions on the current suppression strategy. The meeting has concluded, and he returned to Leping yesterday in the snow to return to his defensive position. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Anhui Province Organizes Village Clearing and Joint Defense <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Actively Consolidates City Defenses</p>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: Chen Diaoyuan, chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, due to the rampant communist bandits in various counties, causing the people to suffer beyond endurance, is organizing a Village Clearing Headquarters, with branch offices established in various counties as appropriate, in order to carry out village clearing and bandit suppression at the same time. He has submitted this proposal to the provincial government's standing committee for discussion and resolution. The organizational regulations have been handed over to the single-item regulations review committee for review and will be reported to the meeting again. Before the headquarters is established, the provincial government has approved the request from the Prepared Army Corps Headquarters to supervise and urge the various counties to expedite the clearing of the villages in order to maintain public security. It has ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to forward this to the county magistrates of the various counties, instructing them to immediately comply with the previously promulgated Village Clearing Regulations, expedite the implementation, and report back at any time. The department has also submitted the formulated joint defense measures for the various counties, which have been passed by the 161st standing committee meeting of the provincial government, and has sent these measures to the Ministry of Interior and the provincial government for filing. It has also requested that the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces be notified, instructing the counties bordering Anhui Province to implement joint defense, and has issued a notice to the sixty county magistrates to comply with this and earnestly implement it at any time. Since the establishment of municipal administration in Anqing, demolition of the city walls and road construction have been actively carried out, but due to insufficient funds, the project has not been completed. Now, the municipal administration preparatory office has been ordered to be abolished, and the broken bricks and crumbling ruins in the eastern, southern, and northern gates are visible everywhere. The Prepared Army Corps Headquarters, based on a telegram from Ruan Zhaochang, commander of the 55th Division, which roughly stated that the communist bandits are rampant and the suppression of bandits in various areas has not yielded significant results, the provincial capital is the administrative hub and defense must be strict. It is said that the city walls of Anqing have been largely destroyed and should be repaired. During the suppression of the Nian bandits in the Qing Dynasty, villages and towns were all built with stockaded walls, which could effectively control the bandits, because the bandit nature of the bandits meant they could not attack cities and had no time to attack cities, so they had nothing to plunder and would disperse on their own. This is my humble opinion, and I hope you will consider it. The Army Corps Headquarters believes that what he said is not without merit, and at this time when communist bandits are rampant, consolidating city defenses is an urgent task. It has specially consulted the provincial government, instructing the Department of Construction to order the Huaining County Government to comply, strictly prohibiting the demolition and theft of bricks and earth, and ordering the Anqing Public Security Bureau to strictly prohibit anyone from demolishing or stealing bricks and earth from the city walls, and should punish them according to the law.

<h3 id="e69">Guangdong Army Repels Li Mingrui's Band <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Story of Li's Band Invading Lechang</p>
<p>Bandit Traces Also Found in Rucheng and Renhua</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: After the communist bandit Li Mingrui's band escaped from Lian County into the Guangdong-Hunan border area, they encountered an ambush by the Guangdong army's Deng Regiment in the Meihua Pingengkou area, and then fled into the Lechang County area. Huang Yanzhen, the commander of the North River Bandit Suppression, immediately sent the 149th Regiment of the 63rd Division, led by Guo Runhua, to Lechang to intercept and suppress them. Later, it was learned that the band that had fled to Lechang was led by Li Mingrui himself, with more than a thousand men, while the bands of Wei Baqun and Zhang Yunyi had entered the Lan Mountain and Linwu areas on the Hunan border through Wuyang. On the 6th, a large number of communist bandits fled to Dadong and Huangdong, opposite Lechang. There were also three to four hundred bandits who fled from Huangdong to the villages near Renhua, so on the morning of the 7th, Renhua County was once again in a state of emergency. It was found that Renhua was not far from Rucheng, and Hu Liang, the communist leader of Rucheng, had gathered more than ten people, including the commander of the pseudo-detachment, Xi Zanxiang, and others, and launched an uprising in the Rucheng area on the evening of the 6th, responding to Li's bandits, burning and killing more than twenty villages. At present, bandit traces of more than five hundred people have been found in Dongtang, twenty miles from Renhua County. As for the regular troops stationed in Shaoguan, they had already urged the 125th Brigade's replenishment regiment, led by Yan Yingyu, who had returned from Guangzhou, to also rush to Shaoguan and deploy defenses in the Xingning and Renhua areas. The first battalion of the Yan Regiment had already departed from Shaoguan for Xingning on the 7th, and the second and third battalions and the directly affiliated units of the regiment continued to depart from Shaoguan on the 8th. As for the Pingshi and Lechang areas, Guo Runhua's regiment was strictly defended and suppressed. Two regiments of the Hunan army had also arrived from the Hunan border to provide assistance. Li's bandits initially planned to disturb Pingshi and were about to cross the river, but they did not expect that the Hunan army had already arrived. Li's bandits then changed their plan, most of them retreating back to the Lian County area, while local bandits Xie and Deng each went out of Lechang City to the Dacaichang area, twenty miles away. As a result, Lechang was shaken, and merchants stopped handling goods. At the same time, the Shaoping Highway cars also stopped running. It was reported that the local communists arrived at Dacaichang on the 5th, immediately sealed off the boats and crossed the river, gathering more than 3,000 people, with about 1,000 rifles. On the 6th, they advanced along the Shaoping Highway to Changduo, which is one day away from Renhua. The local communists of Xiaobeijiang rushed from Changduo to Renhua, contacting the local communists in Rucheng. Fortunately, Guo's regiment had already rushed from Lechang to Changduo to meet them head-on. They made contact with each other in Changduo, and the battle was fierce. At the same time, a battalion of Tan Langxing's regiment stationed in Renhua was also on alert against the local communists near Renhua. In the battle of Changduo, the local communists lacked bullets and were defeated by the government army, fleeing to the Hunan border. Guo's regiment continued to pursue them with the second battalion. The Guangzhou Headquarters received a telegram yesterday from Huang Yanzhen, commander of the North River Bandit Suppression, saying that Guo's regiment had searched and suppressed the remnants of the bandits near Changduo in the North River on the 6th, capturing a company of bandits, seizing forty or fifty rifles, one mortar, and several horses, and is still continuing the search and suppression.

As for the inspection of the Provincial Defense Army, the office also plans to start with Liu Zongyi's troops first. Once completed, the original name will be cancelled and replaced with the name of the Security Team.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhen's 49th Division has repeatedly received telegrams from the Central Government urging it to enter Jiangxi to join in the suppression of the communist bandits, and preparations for departure have been made. However, due to the importance of the defense of Zhangzhou, a telegram has been sent to the provincial government to forward it to the Central Government, requesting that capable troops be dispatched to Zhangzhou to take over the defense. Before the Central Government's takeover troops arrive, please order Chen Guohui to dispatch two regiments to Zhangzhou to take over the defense. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government forwarded it to the Central Government, requesting that a division of troops be dispatched by sea to Zhangzhou. This has been approved, and the Ministry of Military Administration has telegraphed the provincial government, saying that it has dispatched an elite division, which will be concentrated immediately and take a ship from Shanghai to Fujian, going directly to Zhangzhou and still under the command of He Yingqin for bandit suppression. As for the unit number, it is not yet known. (February 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Tianjin Public Security Bureau Arrests Communists in Large Sweep <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Over Thirty People Arrested and Extradited for Interrogation</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Tianjin Public Security Bureau received a tip from the Special Affairs Squad the day before yesterday, stating that the Communist Party of this city was holding a meeting at the Yuzhong Hotel in the French Concession on the morning of the day before yesterday, resolving to send personnel to infiltrate and work within the Jin-nan army, which is currently undergoing reorganization, with plans to depart within days. Simultaneously, the City Reorganization Committee also received this report. They immediately consulted with Zhang Xueming, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, to devise a plan for arrest. Zhang did not issue the mobilization order until 11:30 PM the night before, dispatching Secretary-General Wu Yixian to the Japanese Police Department, Section Chief Shen to the French Municipal Council, and Secretary Zhang Guanru to the British Municipal Council, to separately negotiate arrest procedures. Due to the lateness of the hour and the lack of official documents, they requested that the arrests be made first, with warrants to be issued later. After obtaining the consent of each Municipal Council, the Public Security Bureau Special Affairs Squad immediately mobilized, joining forces with the special agents of each Municipal Council to set out at 2:00 AM yesterday morning, searching the various concessions for hidden Communists. They arrested ten Communists at No. 9 Qinren Lane in the British Concession. It is reported that among them were Zeng Pilie, Li Huifang, and two women. They also arrested Du Zhensheng, Han Linfu, and others at the Yuzhong Hotel in the French Concession. Du Zhensheng previously served as Shi Yousan's representative in Tianjin and, under the guise of purchasing firearms, embezzled 250,000 yuan and fled to Dalian. Du was once engaged to the famous socialite Jin Xiuyan, and her father, brothers, and brother-in-law were implicated and remain in custody due to his embezzlement. Du came to Tianjin from Dalian this time to attend a meeting, leading to his arrest. Accompanying Du was Han Linfu, who, it is said, was a former alternate member of the Central Executive Committee who had been expelled. Unexpectedly, after convening a meeting of Communists on the morning of the day before yesterday, he was arrested in his sleep the following morning. The search in the Japanese Concession also resulted in the arrest of over ten people. Because the locations searched in the British and Japanese Concessions were Communist strongholds, a large number of Communist books and propaganda materials were seized. All personnel involved in the Communist search remained awake throughout the night. By 9:00 AM yesterday morning, over thirty people had been arrested and extradited to the Public Security Bureau by each Municipal Council. The propaganda materials and Communist books were also transported to the bureau by automobiles. Chief Zhang dispatched Secretary Zhang Guanru, Special Affairs Director Rong Ziheng, Section Chief Sun of the Third Section, and Section Chief Shen of the Fourth Section to conduct separate interrogations last night. It is reported that the Communists arrested this time are mostly important figures. Although it was not a complete sweep, the Communist Party in Tianjin has suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Public Security Bureau of this city previously received a telegram from the Public Security Bureau of Baoding, stating that Bai Ruizeng, the accountant of the Tianjin Huatong Automobile Company, was carrying books for the Communist Party and requesting investigation. The bureau dispatched police on the 7th of this month to apprehend Bai Ruizeng and bring him in for questioning. According to Bai Ruizeng's confession, he delivered the books with Liu Kuisheng to a school in Baoding, but he did not know the contents of the books. The Public Security Bureau will soon escort the suspect to Baoding for further action. (11th)</p>

<p>Revision of the Bo Recuperates the Fuzhong Mining Committee's Circular Telegram</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the two counties of Xiuwu and Boai in Henan Province recovering the mining rights of the British Fuzhong Company, a circular telegram was issued stating: "Recently, a telegram was sent to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Chairman Jiang, the Minister of Railways Sun, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang, the Minister of Industry Kong, the Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, and all committee members, stating: 'After the great chaos is quelled, the people yearn for governance. The most crucial task for the entire nation is to abolish unequal treaties. The contract for the Fuzhong Company's mining affairs is a most unequal treaty. Its acquisition of these mining rights lacked legitimate justification, and after acquisition, it refused to implement even minor benefits to the local people. According to the provisions of Article 41 of the contract, which deny partial or total invalidation, this contract has long lost its value. Our committee members have submitted reports to the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and the Henan Provincial Government, engaging in negotiations, but have not fully achieved our goals. As a result, the Fuzhong Company has been unable to resume operations for years. The company, aware of the difficulty in defying public sentiment, recently used the pretext of unemployed workers to petition the Central Government, requesting permission to resume operations. An investigation reveals that the company ceased operations in 1925 due to workers' dissatisfaction with their treatment, leading them to leave en masse. The public resented its breach of contract and refused to cooperate. Currently, there are no unemployed workers in Jiaozuo, nor are there any workers willing to work for the company. The company is cunningly using pretexts to deceive the government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, failing to recognize this, has even proposed organizing a committee to reorganize the Zhongyuan Company to discuss and resolve all disputes with the Fuzhong Company. This not only ignores the truth of the past but also disregards the fervent desire of the people of Henan to protect the mines. Our committee members, for the sake of national sovereignty and the livelihood of the people, vow to never recognize the resumption of operations by the Fuzhong Company. If this is not accepted, we can only rely on the strength of hundreds of thousands of people in Xiuwu and Boai counties to resolutely refuse to cooperate and do our utmost to resist. We hereby disclose the steps to be taken: (1) Based on the various breaches of contract by the Fuzhong Company, we will proceed to cancel its contract. (2) We will do our utmost to assist in the development of the Zhongyuan Company. (3) We will assist the government in accumulating funds to repay the debt of the Daoqing Railway. (4) We will order the Fuzhong Company to compensate for losses. (5) We will resolutely refuse to cooperate with the Fuzhong Company. Loving and protecting the mines is a common desire of the people. The government and the people should be united. We earnestly hope that you will heed the public opinion, dismiss this proposal, and not only will the hundreds of thousands of people in Xiuwu and Boai be immensely grateful, but the livelihood of the 30 million people of Henan will also depend on it. The joint association of the Xiuwu and Boai committees for recovering the Fuzhong mining rights respectfully bows in winter. Our committee members, entrusted by the people of Xiuwu and Boai, are fighting to recover the mining rights. We will not cease until our goal is achieved. We still pray for the united assistance of all compatriots, party-state seniors. We urgently send this telegram, not daring to be ungrateful." The Xiuwu and Boai committees for recovering the Fuzhong mining rights bow together.</p>

<p>Jiaxing Dispatch: The Ningping steamer of the Suzhou Ning Company, traveling from Jiaxing, was sailing back to Jiaxing from Suzhou on the 13th when seven or eight bandit boats were discovered in the Tang River at Wangjiangjing South Qilihui, Jiaxing County. The bandits were all armed with wooden-cased guns, pistols, and hand-cranked machine guns, ordering the steamer to stop. They then swarmed onto the steamer and tugboats, robbing passengers indiscriminately, with no one spared. In addition to luggage, everything was looted, and many passengers had their clothes stripped off. Just as the steamer was about to be robbed, the daytime steamer of the Tongyuan Company, traveling between Nanxun and Jiaxing, also with a tugboat, arrived from the direction of Pingwang and was subjected to the same robbery. When the steamer finally reached the wharf in this city, it was already late, and the passengers were mostly in a state of utter disarray. (14th)</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department instructed the Highway Bureau yesterday, stating that the Quchang Road Company Preparatory Committee had submitted a request to extend the route to Lanxi. It was found that the original capital of 400,000 yuan for the Quchang Road was scheduled to be completed in six months. The bureau should investigate and report on whether the shares have been fully raised and how the project is progressing. The request to extend the route should be submitted to the department for approval after the Quchang Road is open to traffic.</p>
<p>The Shichang Highway (Shizhou to Changhua) is also one of the six major trunk lines in Zhejiang Province, connecting to Anhui Province. The Yugan section has been open to traffic for some time. Now, due to the completion of bridges and culverts on the Yugan to Changhua section, the original opening date of the 15th of this month has been changed to March 1st due to continuous rain and snow. Passenger vehicles will begin operating then. (14th)</p>

<p>Investigating Fraudulent Donation Offenders: The Sijing River area, where the three counties of Jiaqing, Qingpu, and Shanghai meet, used to have a branch office of the Shanghai Tax Bureau. After the office was ordered to be abolished, a patrol boat was left behind, owned by Jin Bao, a former servant of the office. On the 28th of last month, three people with Zhejiang accents, surnamed Jiang and Xu, claimed to be ordered by the Jiangsu Shipping Administration Bureau to borrow the originally rented house of the office as the bureau's office, posting announcements. Jin Bao was ordered to hang a red flag on the remaining patrol boat. All passing ships had to pay a license fee of two yuan or a license fee of five jiao, and were given zinc license plates or receipts. Later, the shipowners resisted, pointing out that they were imposters. Jiang and others dared to claim, "I am Commander-in-Chief Jiang's nephew. If you resist, we will go to Zhenjiang to mobilize troops to protect us," and left under this pretext. After receiving the report, the county government ordered Song, the section chief of the County Public Security Bureau, to lead police officers from the police squad, including Gu Wen, to investigate. They found that the report was true and recovered hundreds of zinc license plates, an announcement, and a patrol boat. They returned to the county to report. The county government has ordered the police teams to investigate and arrest Jiang, Xu, and others for punishment.</p>

<p>Request to Seal Up the New World: It was discovered on the 7th of this month that the New World Inn located under the Gongyun Bridge outside the Guangfu Gate of this county was stealing electricity. Qi, from the electric plant, discovered that the seal on the electric box was forged. After summoning both parties and a notary at the county chamber of commerce, the seal on the electric box was re-examined, revealing a suspicious point that has not yet been resolved. Now, citizens Fang Minwen, Li Ziliang, Yang Guozhen, and others have reported that the inn secretly harbors prostitutes, condones gambling, hides filth, and acts as a go-between. It not only corrupts countless young people but also harms local morals. The inn treats official prohibitions as nothing. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a report to the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting that officials be sent to secretly investigate and order the county to seal up the inn and detain the inn manager, Xie Shaojing, in order to serve as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Strictly Prohibit Setting Off Firecrackers, Beating Gongs and Drums, Business Closures, and Gambling <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Following the Gregorian calendar and abolishing the old calendar has been repeatedly ordered but not followed. As the end of the old calendar year and the beginning of the new year approach, the municipal authorities, fearing that citizens will still be outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant, have specifically reiterated the prohibition yesterday. The public notice and instruction from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the response from the Bureau of Social Affairs are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Public Notice: The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's public notice states: Regarding the implementation of the Gregorian New Year, measures were announced by the municipal government in December of last year. All activities related to the end of the old calendar year and the beginning of the new year have already been moved to the Gregorian New Year. All other bad customs should be eliminated. In particular, the setting off of firecrackers, beating of gongs and drums, business closures, and gambling should be strictly prohibited. In addition to ordering each district to diligently investigate and prohibit these activities, it is hereby urgently announced for the information of all citizens, who are expected to comply and not deliberately violate these rules, lest they be punished. This is imperative. February 14, Republic of China Year 20, Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng.</p>
<p>Instruction: The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's instruction states: Comply with the order. A public letter from the Bureau of Social Affairs states: It has been found that businesses and factories may not close down during the end of the old calendar year and the beginning of the new year. The Department, in conjunction with the Municipal Party Headquarters, announced and implemented these measures, and the Central Government issued a circular stating that businesses may close down for five days during the Gregorian New Year, but may not close down at all during the old calendar New Year in order to promote the Gregorian calendar and change the people's customs. The end of the old calendar year is approaching, and there is concern that there will still be business closures according to traditional customs. In particular, food and vegetable vendors are essential to the daily life of the people, and it would be inappropriate to stop their business and cause inconvenience to the people who are following the government's orders. Therefore, it is necessary to inform them in advance so as not to cause obstacles. It is appropriate to request that your bureau investigate and quickly instruct the various districts in the northern and southern parts of the city to inform the shops and vendors under their jurisdiction that they must not close down during the specified period, so as not to incur punishment. Please reply. Having received this, and having seen the file regarding the abolition of the old calendar New Year and the promotion of the Gregorian New Year, which was previously ordered to be followed by the Municipal Government's Order No. 6543, all activities related to the end of the old calendar year and the beginning of the new year have already been moved to the Gregorian calendar, and all other bad customs should be prohibited. All matters related to the setting off of firecrackers, beating of gongs and drums, and business closures and gambling should be strictly and thoroughly investigated and prohibited. Having received the foregoing, and in addition to the public notice and reply, this order is issued to the chief, who is expected to comply and strictly enforce it. This is imperative. January 14, Republic of China Year 20, Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng.</p>
<p>Response: It has long been proclaimed and forbidden, in conjunction with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs, that businesses, companies, and factories may not take holidays under the pretext of the end of the old calendar year and the beginning of the new year. The British American Tobacco Company in this city reported that its workers in the Pudong factory had requested leave for the old calendar New Year. In order to follow the Gregorian calendar, the factory did not allow leave. Now that the end of the old calendar year is approaching, most of the workers have left the factory without permission, so they are requesting instructions from the bureau in order to handle the matter. Yesterday, a response was received stating: It is found that during the end of the old calendar year and the beginning of the new year, from February 15th to 24th of the Gregorian calendar, no holidays may be taken under any pretext. If any businesses, companies, or factories take holidays without permission, they shall be ordered to pay their workers double wages for each day. If any workers take leave for reasons other than weddings, funerals, or illness, their wages will be deducted twofold. If the leave exceeds ten days and affects operations, they may be dismissed. This has been announced to the public by this Bureau in conjunction with the Municipal Party Headquarters in Public Notice No. 5096.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Yesterday's Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Engineering Hall at Jiaotong University <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Guests Attended Amidst Heavy Snow</p>
<p>Since Sun Ke and Li Zhaohuan successively became presidents of Jiaotong University in this city, they have been eager to expand the campus buildings and have established five-year and ten-year plans. In the past two years, the Zhixin West Building and the Iron and Wood Factory have been completed. Recently, the construction of an Engineering Hall has begun, and ground was broken on December 14th of last year. On the 20th of the same month, a groundbreaking ceremony was held, and the original metal and woodworking factories were dismantled to prepare the site. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now reported that the dismantling work has been completed, and yesterday a groundbreaking ceremony for the hall was held. President Li Zhaohuan of the university telegraphed Sun Ke, Minister of Railways, to come to Shanghai, and also invited prominent Chinese and foreign figures in Shanghai to participate. On that day, snow fell heavily and the weather was very cold, but the participants were still very enthusiastic. Among the guests were Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Aoi, French Vice-Consul Han Shi Li, Shanghai Electric Power Company Chief Engineer E.I. Ed at, Jardine Engineering Corporation representative He Jin'en, U.S. Steel Corporation representative Bao Qisi, Swiss Sulzer Company representative Max Ted, and dozens of others. The ceremony began at 10:30 a.m. After the meeting, Li Zhaohuan gave a report, followed by a speech by Sun Ke. After the ceremony, the group braved the snow to lay the foundation stone at the site and took photographs before dispersing. The speeches of Li and Sun are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>President Li's Report Minister, Distinguished Guests, Today is the groundbreaking ceremony for the Engineering Hall of Jiaotong University. Because it is snowing today, it is inconvenient to hold the ceremony outside, so we have temporarily borrowed this classroom. We are very grateful and honored to have the Minister's instructions and the guidance of Chinese and foreign guests. Jiaotong University has a history of thirty-five years. After several reforms in the past, it has achieved its current situation. However, in the past ten years, various construction projects at the school have been stalled due to financial difficulties. Until the year before last, Minister Sun took office as the president of our school and set a five-year and ten-year plan for the entire construction of Jiaotong University. On the one hand, he boosted the spirit of Jiaotong University spiritually, and on the other hand, he rebuilt it materially. According to this plan, the new dormitory (Zhixin West Building) was completed last year. The second step was to build this factory, and the third step is the Engineering Hall. Construction began on December 14th last year, and the groundbreaking ceremony was held on the 20th. The estimated cost is 241,900 taels, excluding electrical equipment and other installations, totaling 500,000 yuan. It was originally scheduled to be completed in August of this year. However, because the snowfall this year is more severe than in previous years, the project cannot be completed according to the budget, or it may be completed in early September. Taking this opportunity, our school plans to hold a 35th-anniversary celebration in October or December, and the opening ceremony of the Engineering Hall will also be held at the same time. We also plan to hold an industrial exhibition. We hope that all guests will come to the school at that time to give guidance, and that all colleagues and students will work together to plan this major celebration. Now, please listen to Minister Sun's speech.</p>
<p>Minister Sun's Speech Distinguished Guests, Faculty, and Students, In the past two years, I have said at this school that Jiaotong University is a specialized school in China with a glorious history and long tradition. In the past fifteen years, many talents for national construction have been cultivated by this school, and they can be seen in government agencies and in society. This historical glory naturally makes us feel satisfied. However, the cultivation of talents by a school cannot be separated from the needs of the country and the spirit of society. As the needs of the country increase, our university must also develop day by day in order to achieve the original intention of establishing and maintaining Jiaotong University. Now, China has entered a period of peaceful construction, and the country's needs in the future will naturally be very large. At the same time, the revitalization of industry and commerce also urgently feels the need for talent. In this way, since the number of specialized talents needed by the country and society has increased, the strength of our school in cultivating specialized talents must also increase accordingly. The Ministry and the school, in view of this, decided on a plan to promote the development of the school. The first step is to engage in material construction. In the past two years, considerable achievements have been made. The construction of this Engineering Hall was actually planned by the school several years ago. President Ling also initiated it at that time, but because of financial difficulties, the government had no way to implement the construction. It is only now that there is hope of completion. Today is the groundbreaking ceremony. We hope that the entire building will be completed this year. After completion, it will not only be that Jiaotong University has increased its facilities, but it can be said that it has opened a new chapter in the national universities of the entire Chinese education community. The construction of the Engineering Hall has a great relationship with the development of our school. I hope that whether it is faculty or students, they will all strive to improve their knowledge and study practical sciences. What is studied today can be used to serve society tomorrow, to revitalize various industries, and to work together to promote it. It is not only the glory of our school, but also the happiness of the country and society. This is the opinion I contribute to the ceremony today.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Letter from the Consolidated Tax Department to the Yarn Mill Association <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Tax Exemption for Inventory Until the End of March</p>
<p>Tax Reduction for Straw and Small Packages Not Approved</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn Mill Association received a letter from the Consolidated Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, which stated: Regarding the method of levying taxes on cotton yarn leaving the factory, your association previously submitted eight key points and sent representatives to petition the department. The department considered that the requests for extending the tax exemption period for inventory and reducing taxes on small and straw packages were important matters related to tax policy and could not be approved by the department without authorization. The situation was immediately reported to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. Now, instructions have been received that, with the implementation of the consolidated tax on cotton yarn, all inventory before February 1st will be allowed to be transported and sold within the prescribed time limit and will be exempt from tax, following the same tax collection method as machine-made foreign goods. This kind of accommodation already shows consideration for the difficulties of merchants. However, the first half of February coincides with the end of the lunar year, and transportation is stagnant, which is somewhat difficult in terms of commercial practice. Inspection and verification show that this is indeed the case. The transport and sale of inventory is temporarily allowed to be extended to March 31st. There will be no further extensions after this date. This is a special accommodation method at the beginning of the implementation. In the future, if there is a tax increase, all goods stored in the factory should still be implemented from the date of the tax increase, and this example should not be used as a precedent. As for the request to exempt the cotton on January 31st from consolidated tax, with 360 catties converted into one bale of yarn, it is difficult to implement and may affect other tax revenues, so it is impossible to approve. This time, the government abolished likin and implemented a new tax system, which has resulted in great losses, but it is all for the purpose of unifying the tax system and facilitating merchants. The manufacturers should be aware of the government's efforts to benefit merchants and eliminate malpractices, and should no longer worry excessively or make excessive demands. Regarding the request to reduce the consolidated tax on straw and small packages of cotton yarn, it should be known that the consolidated tax is a new tax system, and in principle, there can be no distinction between light and heavy. Moreover, since the tax rules have been determined and promulgated, the country's credibility, both internally and externally, is extremely important, and it is even more important not to change them rashly. It is hoped that you will inform your members to abide by the above and so on. Upon receiving this, we should comply with it. As for the other petitions regarding collection procedures, in order to strive to accommodate commercial situations, the department will be able to make accommodations if the method can be simplified without affecting tax revenue, in order to conform to the government's utmost concern for commerce. The department will also consider the various articles requested by your association in detail and decide on temporary measures with your association's representatives as follows: (1) The cotton yarn tax payment certificate will be temporarily stamped by the local consolidated tax bureau and issued to the factory representatives for the manufacturers to fill out and collect at any time. (2) The procedure for brushing and printing inspection numbers on the yarn bales is more complicated. It is temporarily allowed to be changed to stamping a mark with the three characters "徵統稅一" (consolidated tax one) made of coir on the yarn bale as proof of tax payment. (3) After the manufacturer applies for the tax payment certificate and stamps the "徵統稅一" (consolidated tax one) coir mark on the package surface, it can be shipped from the factory and sold locally. Those who transport and sell it elsewhere must report to the first-level management office or inspection office that it passes through (the location of the first-level management office or inspection office should be determined by each bureau and office based on the situation). After verifying that the goods and certificates match, the tax payment certificate will be stamped with a mark, and it can pass through without further inspection. (4) It is temporarily allowed for factories in Nantong, Wuxi, and Bizhou and other inland areas to ship in small packages as usual, and to accumulate forty small packages as one large package to pay the tax, without having to obtain a certificate. However, each factory must quickly establish a retail department. Once the retail department is established, no more zero packages can be shipped. (5) If the yarn mill has a weaving workshop, the cloth should be taxed first according to the yarn. From the first of this month, the amount of yarn sent by each factory to the weaving workshop should be reported for supplementary tax. Those who do not want to pay the tax on the yarn can report the brand name, number, weight, and other details of the woven cloth to the factory representative for verification and registration before shipping from the factory. Then, the grade will be determined, and the tax will be supplemented on the cloth. (6) The tax standard for each bale of cotton yarn is: for those below 23 counts, each large bale of 40 small packages is calculated as 312 catties; for those exceeding 20 counts, each large bale is calculated as 310 catties. The above temporary measures are extraordinarily accommodated by the department and will be submitted for approval. In addition to distributing them to the subordinate agencies to comply with, it should also be sent to your association to let all manufacturers abide by and implement them to enrich national taxes. This is most important.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Various Industry Tax Rules Association Continues to Submit Opinions on Business Tax <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Continued Submission to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of the various industry trade associations in this city yesterday continued to submit to the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing National Government, "Regarding the audit and approval of the submitted document No. 11945 of the Junfu [Ministry of Finance], which was submitted to petition for the correction of the Zhejiang Province Business Tax Regulations and to conduct assessment and correction at any time to comply with the outline, and to pray for investigation and approval to relieve commercial difficulties and benefit commerce. We have reviewed and learned that the draft Business Tax Regulations of Zhejiang Province has been submitted to the ministry by the provincial government, and the ministry is in the process of reviewing each item. If the business classification, tax standards, and tax rates exceed the provisions of the ministerial outline and supplementary measures, they should be amended separately and then submitted to the provincial government for reply and transferred to the Finance Department for compliance. It is hoped that you will be informed of this decision." We have received this information, and we deeply appreciate the ministry's concern for the people's suffering and its willingness to listen to their voices. However, after investigating the business tax rates formulated by the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there are many instances where they exceed the provisions of the outline and supplementary measures. We respectfully submit a brief explanation to the ministry for your kind consideration. (1) After investigating the general outline of business taxes in various provinces, except for luxury businesses and others that should be cracked down on, the maximum tax rate should not exceed 2/1000. However, the tax rates formulated by the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang mostly exceed 2/1000, which is in obvious contradiction with the provisions of the outline. Moreover, the separate taxation of local and foreign goods is in violation of Article 7 of the supplementary measures. This is the first issue that we request the ministry to strictly correct. (2) Business tax should be levied on business operations, but the tax rates formulated by the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are based on items, which is a repeat of the mistake of the hundred-goods likin donation and opens the door to harassment by minor officials. Moreover, it is in contradiction with the naming of business tax. This is the second issue that we request the ministry to strictly correct. (3) The collection of business tax should be limited to those who engage in buying and selling activities. However, the so-called "zhuangke" (wholesale agents) in the market do not constitute buying and selling activities. For example, egg factories in Shanghai set up "zhuang" in the interior, only buying and not selling. Similarly, in the yarn and cloth industry, branches are set up in Haimen and Nantong to collect cloth, and another "zhuang" is established in Shanghai, but only for the convenience of handling and transportation. If these "zhuangke" also have to pay business tax, it is tantamount to a kind of buying and selling activity and paying double business tax. There are no explicit provisions for this in the business tax rates formulated by the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and there will be many disputes during collection in the future. This is the third issue that we request the ministry to include in its consideration and exempt these "zhuangke" from business tax. The above reasons are entirely based on the submissions of various industries and integrated. We urge the ministry to consider the difficulties of merchants and, when revising the business tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, to ensure that all rates do not exceed 1/1000, except where the government has other regulations below 2/1000. The wholesale part should be taxed at 1/4, in accordance with the provisions of the outline. The collection method should be modeled after that formulated by the Anhui Provincial Government, and it should be handled in proportion to the turnover, so as to prevent harassment. In addition, "zhuangke" who do not engage in buying and selling activities should be exempt from business tax to avoid duplication.

<h3 id="e93">The Dyeing and Weaving Industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Requests Revision of the Business Tax Regulations <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Dyeing and Weaving Industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, "To the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, We have investigated Article 4 of the Detailed Rules for the Consolidated Tax on Cotton Yarn issued by your ministry, which states that cotton yarn on which consolidated tax has already been paid and the cloth and other items directly woven from this cotton yarn are exempt from other types of national, provincial, or local taxes. Therefore, the business tax regulations of various provinces do not include the textile industry, because the cotton yarn and cloth produced by the textile industry have already been subject to consolidated tax. The dyeing and weaving manufacturing industry is a manufacturer of finished products woven from cotton yarn on which consolidated tax has been paid. The business nature of the dyeing and weaving industry is the same as that of textile factories, and it is of course exempt from all taxes and levies. Even the business tax regulations of various provinces list the cotton textile industry under the item of goods selling industry, and there are no provisions for further levying taxes on the cotton textile manufacturing industry. There is no need for further explanation. We humbly report this to your attention, and we respectfully request your ministry to issue an instruction to the finance departments of various provinces that when levying business tax on the dyeing and selling industry, the dyeing and weaving factories and their wholesale outlets (i.e., direct issuing offices) in the cotton textile manufacturing industry should not be involved. We also request your approval for strict compliance to benefit the industry."</p>
<h3 id="e94">Six Shipping Companies Operating Shanghai-Taiwan Liners Establish Escort Teams and Raise Fares <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Three Guards Assigned to Each Ship First</p>
<p>To Be Implemented on the Second of This Month</p>
<p>Since the Xinning Taiwan liner was robbed and Taiwan bandits were discovered on the Guangji ship, navigation on the waters off Zhejiang has been very dangerous. The Lian'an Shipping Association in this city, because its six member companies' ships all travel to eastern Zhejiang, and because the Taiwan bandit Ye Mingsheng confessed during interrogation on the Chao Wu warship that he also planned to rob Shanghai-Taiwan liners, the six companies have now agreed to increase armed escorts to protect passengers. What we have heard is recorded below.</p>
<p>Request for Escort Teams The Lian'an Shipping Association's Daxi and Pingxing ships operate on the Shanghai-Taiwan line. The association has now decided to follow the example of the Sanbei, Ning Shao, and China Merchants Bureau ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and also request the placement of escort teams. The association has submitted a public request to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to first dispatch 20 soldiers with pistols and wooden holsters to protect everything on the ship. The allowances will be provided by the Shipping Bureau. This has been approved, and the escort will be dispatched starting on the 18th and will be implemented starting on the 20th when departing. Three guards will be assigned to each ship first, and two or three more will be added in the second stage to strengthen the force.</p>
<p>Increase in Passenger Fares The six companies need to increase expenses for adding security guards. After a joint meeting of the Lian'an Shipping Association, it was decided that, starting from the opening of the classes on March 20th, the passenger cabin fares for ships from Shanghai to Haimen, Zhoushan, and other ports will be increased uniformly, about 20 percent more than the original fares. After the decision was made yesterday, it was announced to all sectors of society. As for freight rates, they are still under negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Sino-French Radio Station Will Officially Communicate <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The French Are Currently Transferring the Project</p>
<p>The Sino-German Electrical Equipment Has Also Been Completed</p>
<p>The International Radio Station established by the Ministry of Communications in Zhenru, except for the Sino-American portion that has officially communicated directly, the other Sino-French and Sino-German electrical equipment has not yet officially communicated due to unfinished projects. It is now learned that the Sino-French radio equipment of the International Radio Station was contracted by the French Long-Distance Telephone Company, and our country paid the project fee of more than 40,000 yuan. The installation started on March 11th last year and was completed in the first ten days of this month. Starting the day before yesterday (12th), the French Long-Distance Telephone Company, together with our country's radio engineers, is officially testing and communicating with Paris. It is planned to complete eight major tests. During the testing period, if any incorrect information is found in the communication, the French Long-Distance Telephone Company will still be responsible for repairing it. As for the incoming and outgoing telegrams, there is no degree of incorrectness. In order to complete its responsibilities, it will then be transferred to our country's Ministry of Communications for acceptance and communication. However, after our country accepts the project, it will still need to conduct local testing of the machine to understand the internal workings of the project. If any instability is found, the company will still be responsible for repairing it. The Sino-German electrical equipment project was installed by our country itself and was completed last month. Currently, it is communicating directly with Germany. On the German side, it has repeatedly requested to publicly and voluntarily test report for one day without charging telegram fees to gain the trust of all sectors of society. However, whether or not to hold a voluntary test report has not yet been decided by the Ministry of Communications.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways Has Approved</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has scheduled a National Commercial Transportation Conference to be held in Nanjing on March 1st of this year. The China National Coal Production and Sales Association, because the association has a close relationship with the railway, has telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, requesting that a representative be allowed to attend the conference and make contributions. Yesterday, the association received a letter from the Ministry of Railways, stating that regarding the request to send a representative, one representative and two attendees will be allowed to attend the meeting at the time. After receiving the letter, the association will hold a meeting to elect them in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has instructed the various rice industry groups in this city, stating, "In order to comply with the order, rice prices are related to people's livelihood. This bureau is responsible for food and is responsible for regulating surpluses and deficits. Now is the time after a good harvest, and both agriculture and commerce should be taken care of without bias. In the future, the association must report to this bureau in advance for the purchase of foreign rice futures. Even for those purchased in the past but not yet delivered, a supplementary report should also be made for review. The association members must understand the purpose of this bureau in regulating food and should not be alarmed. If there are any omissions in the report, it will lead to inconvenience. In addition to separate orders, this order is given to be followed." It is heard that yesterday, the Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association was also instructed that the purchase and sale regulations of the industry must clearly stipulate the article that the purchase of foreign rice must be declared to the Social Affairs Bureau. Orders have been issued to comply with this, and the registration rules will be formulated soon and submitted to the Municipal Government for promulgation.</p>

<p>The Anti-Drug Association's Declaration The China National Anti-Drug Association's declaration against opium public sales states, "For several months, there have been rumors that the anti-smoking authorities will abolish the policy of complete prohibition and adopt opium public sales, which is extremely disturbing. The association believes that opium public sales have been denounced by the Premier and opposed by the public. It violates the Kuomintang's platform, destroys the anti-smoking regulations, and should not exist under the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. It is also not allowed by international anti-smoking treaties. If it is implemented, our international status will be completely lost, and the people's suffering will be aggravated. Feeling that it is dangerous, we cannot remain silent. On January 1st, we issued a declaration expressing our opposition. On January 12th, we sent a letter to the Central Anti-Smoking Committee to inquire about the authenticity of the rumors. On January 17th, we received a letter from the committee stating that it was not true. While we were analyzing the matter, we are not...</p>

<p>There was no insurance last year, which is also one of the false accounts. In addition, there are still accounts that have not been calculated. We will determine the details after verification." When questioned, the defendant, Wang Jiucheng, who lives at No. 86 Tangjia Lane, said that he was the new manager of Yuanchang, which has recently closed due to losses of about 20,000 gold. In addition, the assistant misappropriated more than 2,700 yuan, and the accountant also slightly misappropriated some funds. There are still 6,000 yuan worth of goods and properties in the warehouse, which is about 30,000 yuan short. The plaintiff then pointed out that I had embezzled this money, but in fact, I only used more than 400 yuan, and so on. The court ordered the defendant to pay 6,000 yuan as bail and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Telegram from the Shipping Workers' Union to the Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>The Inland River Shipping Workers' Union in this city telegraphed Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Nanxian (above omitted), "Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, according to today's newspaper, at 3 p.m. on the 13th, small vessels on the Ning Shao Company's Suzhou-Jiaxing route and the Tongyuan Company's Nanxun-Jiaxing route were robbed by large gangs of bandits south of Wangjiangjing. The two vessels lost a total of more than 10,000 yuan. Upon reading this, we are deeply shocked. Wangjiangjing is very close to Jiaxing, and the bandits dared to gather and run rampant in broad daylight, which is truly a disregard for the local officials. The military and police officers have also been unable to provide effective security. If they are not strictly pursued and arrested, how can the area be pacified and commercial transportation be secured? It is appropriate to order the naval and land forces to investigate and arrest the bandits within a time limit and bring them to justice to maintain the shipping industry. The responsible officials should be punished first to prevent negligence. We respectfully telegraph this and ask for your attention. The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Workers' Union respectfully submits this.</p>

<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Relief Committee, stating, "To the Chinese Red Cross Society, We have recently received a report from Zhang Lie, the magistrate of Lingbao County, and Dong Faxun, a disaster investigation committee member, stating that Lingbao has been hit by military disasters and banditry. Since last year, the Northwest Army has extorted military salaries, provisions, bran fodder, materials, grass, and opium, totaling more than 2.44 million yuan. More than 3,500 heads of livestock and more than 910 carts have been forcibly requisitioned, and the commutation price for conscription is more than 84,000 yuan. This year, bandits are rampant, and 5,600 houses have been burned down and more than 2,200 people have been kidnapped. Property worth approximately 1.1 million yuan has been looted, and 470 people have been murdered. The reduction in harvests due to drought and locusts and the deaths due to epidemics are not included. Now, as the severe winter approaches, they are suffering from both hunger and cold. Without prompt relief, they will turn into worms. Lingbao is a key point in Henan Province. Frequent military and bandit destruction has left the survivors unable to breathe. We earnestly request your organization to consider the survivors and provide grain and funds as soon as possible, and to widely publicize this to promote relief. We are most grateful.

<p>Mr. Liang Shaofu from Zhou is proficient in traditional Chinese medicine. This time, he was invited by key figures from the capital to come south to prepare for the National Medical Center. He has been residing in Shanghai for more than a month, and people in Shanghai who heard that he had come south came in droves to seek medical treatment. He has saved many lives. For example, the couple of the former Shanghai Daoyin Chuanxie, Madam Wu Yunzhai, Madam Lu Yuequan, and Madam Liu Shisun have all had long-standing diseases healed by his skillful hands. In order to be kept in Shanghai by the people of Shanghai, he has resigned from his position as consultant to Deputy Commander Zhang and will practice medicine in Shanghai.

<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Special District Court heard a case initiated by the Public Works Department's lawyer regarding violations of the Stamp Tax Ordinance. The summoned parties included six businesses: Shujin Lane's Yonghexiang Company, Pentang Lane Bridge's Gu Rongxing Salt Store, Qipan Street's Qixin Bookstore, Guizhou Road's Changhe Rice Store, Fude Road's Yongfaxiang Fruit Store, and Sima Road's Huamei Pharmacy. Presiding over the trial was Magistrate Li Hongye. All were found guilty of not affixing stamps to invoices. The court immediately sentenced Yonghexiang, Qixin Bookstore, and Changhe Rice Store each to a fine of ten silver dollars. Gu Rongxing Salt Store and Yongfaxiang Fruit Store were each fined forty silver dollars. However, Huamei Pharmacy had been fined once before on September 10th of the previous year, making this a second offense, and thus the fine was increased to fifty silver dollars. Six other businesses, including Qinghe Inn, Ronghexiang, Zhiyuan Company, Senda Timber Company, and the nine major silk and satin stores including Hechun, were not present and their cases were rescheduled.</p>

<p>Snow fell for twelve hours from the night before to yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The accumulated snow on the roads reached over a foot.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, there has been continuous rain and snow. Yesterday's snow was particularly heavy. Starting the previous evening, the weather suddenly changed from drizzling rain to sleet. After 6:00 PM, it snowed in bursts, stopping briefly between each. When it snowed, the pellets were quite large, making a rustling sound against the tiles, not only causing suffering for those traveling but also disturbing people's sleep. Around midnight, the sleet turned to snow, with petals like plum blossoms and clumps like willow catkins dancing in the wind until it stopped yesterday afternoon. This lasted for twelve hours. The snow accumulated to a foot on rooftops, and supple branches and withered trees were all weighed down. The streets were like a powder shop made of jade, instantly turning Shanghai into a silver city. The following are noteworthy observations due to the heavy snow:</p>
<p>The Cleaners Overwhelmed: With so much accumulated snow everywhere, the cleaners were suddenly overwhelmed. Traffic in several places was blocked in the early morning. Although various vehicles did not stop even slightly in the prosperous areas, the snow turned to puddles after being rolled over by vehicle tires, causing suffering to pedestrians.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Drivers Profiteering: Rickshaw drivers took the opportunity to profiteer, increasing fares several times over the usual price. Coinciding with the end of the lunar year, when businesses were closing accounts, bill collectors lamented, "I can't go anywhere, brother!"</p>
<p>Streetcars Difficult to Operate: The weather in Shanghai has been very cold for several days. The day before yesterday, it rained heavily all day, and ice fell at times. The sound of ice pellets striking the roof tiles was like hail in summer. Last night, it snowed heavily all night until noon yesterday. The accumulated snow on the roads reached about a foot. This morning, all streetcars in both the Chinese and foreign concessions were suspended. They only started operating gradually by noon. At around 1:30 PM in the afternoon, the electric wires installed near Nanjing Road on Jing'an Temple Road in the Public Concession experienced a temporary shortage of current due to the heavy snow, causing streetcars on routes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 to stop and be unable to move forward, resting along the way for about twenty minutes. Traffic only resumed after the current was sufficient.</p>
<p>Telephone Service Affected: More than twenty telephone lines on the section of Zhongxing Road in Zhabei Telephone Bureau, east of Taiyuan Fang, were broken by the accumulated snow, hanging down into the road like tangled hair. Unaware pedestrians avoided them, fearing electric shock. There were few residents and vast open spaces along the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road, Luhuajing, and Xietu Road. Many telephone poles erected by the Telephone Bureau had already been broken by the heavy snow on the night of the 10th and had not yet been repaired, and the heavy snow on the night of the 13th caused most of the poles to suffer, with the telephone wires falling to the ground, making communication difficult. Furthermore, all telephones in Wusong and Baoshan were out of service yesterday. The Songyang Telephone Company issued a notice to users yesterday stating: "Dear Customers, Due to the continuous heavy snow, all lines have been damaged. Repairs are temporarily impossible to begin. We have no choice but to temporarily suspend telephone service. We hereby notify you."</p>
<p>Reduced Supply of Rice and Vegetables: The heavy snow did not stop, and rice boats were blocked, leading to a scarce supply in Shanghai. According to rice merchants, the market price has risen by several jiao per dan. At the same time, vegetable vendors braved the cold to come to Shanghai, and the prices of vegetables also increased several times. The poor are all complaining.</p>
<p>A Poor Man Freezes to Death: The weather was severely cold, with rain and snow covering the roads. The poor in Bietianyuan could not escape its onslaught. Therefore, a poor man in Pudong, about twenty years old, was lodging under the bridge of the old Xiangyan Factory, using the bridge's shelter as a natural stone house to avoid the wind and snow. However, lacking any means of warmth, he eventually froze to death. Yesterday, the court confirmed the death and arranged for the body to be collected.</p>

<p>This month on the 28th at 9:00 AM</p>
<p>To be heard by Magistrate Zhou Daren</p>
<p>Film actress Hu Die and Lin Xuehuai had previously made an engagement agreement, originally planning to marry after a considerable period. Unexpectedly, last winter, Lin suddenly sent a letter to Hu Die proposing to terminate the engagement, leading to a lawsuit. The case was initially filed in the Shanghai District Court but had not yet been opened for trial. Subsequently, Hu Die discovered that Lin Xuehuai resided at No. 171, near Beishanxi Road (Boundary Road) in the Public Concession. According to the law, the case should be heard in the Special District Court because the defendant resides there. To avoid jurisdictional disputes in the future, Hu Die's attorney, Zhan Jifeng, filed a petition with the Shanghai District Court to transfer jurisdiction. After investigating Lin's address and confirming that it was indeed in the concession, the court granted the request and transferred the case files to the Special District Court. However, a long time has passed, and there has been no date set for the opening of the trial, leading to the widely circulated Hu-Lin contract termination case appearing to have calmed down. Although the general public is paying close attention, there is no way to ascertain the truth. According to reliable information from the Special District Court, the case file regarding the Hu-Lin contract termination case was recently sent from the District Court to the Special District Court. The court has scheduled the case for trial in the ninth courtroom at 9:00 AM on the 28th of this month, to be presided over by Magistrate Zhou Daren. Hu Die's attorney will still be Zhan Jifeng, while Lin's representative attorney will be E Sen. It is expected that there will be a fierce debate when the trial opens.</p>

<p>Cui Laoqi Murdered</p>
<p>Cui Laoqi, a Shandong native, thirty-seven years old, residing in Haigeli, Xuhui, was returning home from outside at 2:00 AM the night before last. At the time, it was snowing heavily, and there was no one walking on the road. Cui was ambushed and hacked to death with an axe on the road at Yangjiaku, Haige Road. He was wounded in the head and other places, and his entire body was covered in blood. The snow-covered ground was stained red. The murderer fled immediately, and no one knew anything about it. It was not discovered until yesterday morning, and the Second Precinct of the Sixth District ordered an investigation, considering two possibilities: revenge killing or robbery. Wang Mao, the head of the fifth tu of the twenty-eighth bao, was ordered to report the case to the District Court. Prosecutor Yang, along with coroner Xuan Zhiming and others, arrived at the scene to examine the body. It was ordered that the family prepare the coffin and await investigation.</p>

<p>Bloodstains Messily on the Pillow</p>
<p>Fingers Appeared Cyanotic</p>
<p>The night before last (the 13th) at 10:00 PM, a man claiming to be Zhao Guangyu from Shandong, about thirty years old, alone, checked into a room at a certain hotel at No. 245, Avenue Edward VII, in the French Concession. He was led to room 303 on the third floor by a receptionist. Zhao paid the room fee and immediately closed the door to sleep. It is unknown what caused him to suddenly become despondent and commit suicide by taking poison. At around 12:00 PM on the following afternoon, a waiter, Cao Wenqing, noticed that Zhao had not yet gotten up. According to the hotel's regulations, the time had expired, so he knocked on the room door to ask if the room needed to be extended. He only heard a vague response from inside, not specifying whether it was necessary or not. The waiter went to inquire in other rooms. Later, at around 2:00 PM, he still had not gotten up. He knocked on the door again to inquire but received no response. Suspecting something was wrong, he called other waiters to pry open the door and found that he had died. The cashier immediately reported it to the Grand Clock Tower Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The deceased was stout, of medium height with a round face, and had a Western-style haircut. The bedding next to the pillow was messily stained with blood, and his fingers were cyanotic. He was wearing a padded jacket of plain blue satin, a thin cotton vest of blue feather satin, a short shirt of white-bottomed blue-striped flannel, and a vermilion undershirt. He was wearing grey cloth padded trousers, blue crepe silk outer trousers, and white cotton socks with wrapped leggings. The quilt was covered with a dark grey sesame-thread woolen camel hair robe and a white-grey sesame-thread single jacket. Two letters addressed to Wu Daosheng were found in his pocket. The body was carried to the Tongren Fuyuan branch autopsy station. At the same time, detectives took the letters back to the police station to report to the detective chief, awaiting an autopsy and the detective, based on the address written on the letters, investigated the family.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Director Pan Discusses the Municipal Government's Policy on Handling the Riyue Case <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to supervise and liquidate the case at any time.</p>
<p>Four lawyers, Wu, Chen, Qin, and Jiang, have been entrusted to represent the creditors.</p>
<p>The liquidation of Riyue Bank and the Savings Department of the Great World is attracting social attention. The Wuchen Society reporter specially visited Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to inquire about the Municipal Government's policy on handling this case. Director Pan gave a detailed explanation, which is recorded as follows: The Municipal Government has always paid attention to this case. Its sole purpose is to safeguard the interests of all creditors and to prevent any prejudice against poor depositors. Now that the judicial authorities have separately accepted the case, sent personnel to liquidate it, or seized property, and the creditor group has not expressed a consistent opinion, the Municipal Government is not in a position to take administrative action at the same time. I have been instructed by Mayor Zhang to instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to supervise the liquidation at any time, to prevent confusion or prejudice. Most of the creditors are women, laborers, and small depositors, and some may not be familiar with legal procedures, leading to the loss of rights. Therefore, the Bureau is responsible for providing guidance and has contacted four lawyers, Wu Jingxiong, Chen Xuerui, Qin Liankui, and Jiang Yiping, to ask them to act as representatives and participate in the litigation on behalf of more than ten thousand creditors. The four lawyers, with a sense of public service, have all generously agreed to fulfill their obligations. The Bureau will formally send letters of engagement tomorrow and publish a notice. If there are any creditors who have not yet registered, or those who have previously registered with accountant Xu Yongzuo but have not participated in the litigation, they can contact the offices of the four lawyers separately as soon as possible to be represented in court. As for the future liquidation results, if the assets of Gongfa Company are insufficient to cover its debts, the directors and shareholders should be jointly responsible. The list of shareholders is being secretly investigated.</p>

<p>Ke Xiangchu Extorts Illegal Fees</p>
<p>Sent to the Vagrant Work Training Center</p>
<p>The so-called "thirty-six gangs" have been rampant and illegal at the wharves in South Shanghai for a long time, causing resentment among merchants and travelers. Since the Municipal Government's strict crackdown, they have already been restrained. Unexpectedly, on February 7th, a man named Ke Xiangchu at Wharf No. 4 obstructed the loading and unloading of goods, extorted illegal fees, and took away the bamboo poles and ropes carried by the laborers. He was arrested on the spot by the wharf patrol police and sent to the First District Office of the Public Security Bureau, transferred to the Public Security Bureau for severe punishment as a warning. It is now known that Ke Xiangchu, also known as Ke Yangchu, has been interrogated by the Public Security Bureau and confirmed to have committed extortion. He has been sent to the Vagrant Work Training Center to learn a trade and instructed not to be released unless there is genuine evidence of repentance. At the same time, a photo of the ruffian will be posted throughout the wharves to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>Dr. Kong Bo and his wife are from Kansas City, USA. Recently, during their vacation, they are touring the Pacific countries. They arrived in Shanghai by ship from Australia a few days ago and were introduced by Mrs. Bibi to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association to inquire about children's welfare news. Mr. Wu Weide, the Director-General of the Association, led them to visit the Children's Welfare and Education Institute established by the Association. At that time, the children in the institute were having lunch. The young children, from five to twelve years old, were also implementing a self-service system, which was quite interesting. The equipment in the classrooms, the layout of the bedrooms, and the management methods were all carefully inspected. Dr. Kong was very satisfied with this.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Petition by Vegetable Vendors on Ximen Road in the French Concession <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The vegetable vendors in the middle section of Ximen Road in the French Concession have been setting up stalls and operating their businesses after donating for licenses at the Grand Clock Tower Public Works Department. However, since December of last year, the French Public Works Bureau, at the request of the Nanyang Bridge Business Association, stopped issuing licenses, claiming that they obstructed pedestrian traffic. This directly affected these vegetable vendors who relied on setting up stalls, totaling more than ninety households, resulting in unemployment and making it impossible for more than a thousand people to make a living. Although they still resumed operating covertly at the beginning and end of the alley, they were frequently subjected to detention and fines. Furthermore, during the period of lunar new year account settlement, which is usually a time of thriving business, they had no choice but to seek unity and make a final appeal. A few days ago, they elected representatives Yan Wenguang, Wang Shangyi, Zhao Jinkun, Lu Peiqing, Zhi Jinneng, Li Dagen, Wang Ayu, and others to petition the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, the French Public Works Department Donation Office, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Social Affairs Bureau, and to sincerely request Mr. Du, Chairman of Huagene Road, to consider the livelihoods of the common people, speak up for justice, and find ways to help. Mr. Du's residence sent Mr. Yang to meet with them on his behalf, promising to find a way, or to designate other straight roads such as Ma Lang Road and Jule Road for business operations, so that there would be no obstruction to the road administration. Each representative was satisfied and dispersed. However, the end of lunar new year account settlement period has arrived, and it is uncertain whether licenses can be obtained in these one or two days. These more than ninety households and over a thousand poor people are still frowning with suffering.</p>

<p>Abiding by the Agreed Price List Preserves Credibility</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association sent a letter to various silk shops regarding the settlement of the final dyeing accounts for the year 19, stating: "Greetings. Due to the soaring price of gold, independent tariffs, and rising raw material costs, the operating costs are enormous. Various industries have increased prices to seek compensation. The main raw material used by our industry, dyes, has risen to three or four tenths, making it difficult to maintain operations. We could have increased dyeing fees appropriately to remedy this. However, in February of the year 19, before your industry sent items for dyeing and before our industry received items for dyeing, there were agreed price lists stamped, stipulating the prices of various colors. Increasing prices midway would inevitably harm our credibility. Furthermore, according to our industry, there were still violations of the agreed price list and deductions of dyeing fees during the first and second periods of the year 19 settlement of dyeing accounts. If there is no increase in price and further deductions are made this time during the final period of the dyeing accounts, then the operations of each dyehouse in our industry will naturally not be able to be maintained. Our association's representatives have decided that all final dyeing accounts for the year 19 will be settled according to the prices stipulated in the agreed price list stamped with each silk shop in February of last year, temporarily enduring the pain and not increasing prices, to show our adherence to credibility. We should record this accordingly and respectfully inform you. We hope that your shop will adhere to the principle of good faith and commercial integrity, so that our industry's dyehouses will settle the final dyeing accounts for the year 19 with your shop according to the prices stipulated in the previous agreed price list, without further deductions or delays. We would be publicly grateful."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau recently learned that a gang of bandits who had repeatedly committed murder, arson, robbery, intimidation, and fraud in Qidong County were hiding in No. 12 Hongyunfang in the French Concession. It sent a full squad of detectives, together with the French police, to rush to the house and arrest seven people, including Wang Chunfu, Zhu Hanping, Yu Er, and Lu Guangren. After being interrogated by the French court, they were allowed to be taken back by the Bureau. The Bureau repeatedly conducted preliminary trials, and based on eyewitness testimony, in addition to the four suspects Wang, Zhu, Yu, and Lu, the other three were not recognized. Statements were recorded in court and a pledge was signed. The Bureau, believing that the other three were not related to the case, released them immediately to avoid harming innocent people. The four suspects, Wang et al., were sentenced to detention pending further instructions. At the same time, a formal document was being prepared to request the Qidong County Government to transfer the suspects for interrogation. The Qidong County Government had also heard the news and confirmed that Wang Chunfu was actually Xu Jusheng, and Zhu Hanping was actually Zhu Tingrong, who were repeatedly wanted by the county for major crimes and were not apprehended. Therefore, County Magistrate Zhou Juesheng personally led the Chief Prosecutor Su Zihu and others, taking the county's warship to Shanghai. The County Government requested to fetch and take them back. By order of the County Government, the Public Security Bureau yesterday extracted the four suspects, Wang et al., from the detention center, handed them over to the county's Team Leader Su and others, escorted them onto the warship, and took them back to Qidong for trial.</p>

<p>Circumstances Seem Suspicious</p>
<p>Wang Xia Shi, a woman from Bao Ying, forty-one years old, residing next to the Taitong Inn on North Hutang Road, Pudong, runs a pancake shop at home to make a living. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, two young girls suddenly lingered in the shop. A police officer from the Fourth Squadron saw them and became suspicious. He went forward to question them. According to one girl, named Shen A San, sixteen years old, living in Yangjing East Zhaikou, she came to Lannidu today to look for her aunt to work in a yarn factory, but did not find her. Another girl, named Shen Weiying, fifteen years old, from Chongming, is a neighbor of Shen. She ran away here today after being beaten by her aunt. When asked, Xia Shi said that she saw the two girls walking in the heavy snow and felt sorry for them, so she invited them in for a moment and had no bad intentions. The police officer, believing that the two girls' words seemed untruthful, took them and Xia Shi to the station, where the precinct chief ordered to await investigation, summon and interrogate family members.</p>

<p>Five Arrested by Police Following Snow Tracks</p>
<p>Wu A Yuan's family, a local resident living at No. 27 near the Yunzao River in Wusong, was suddenly visited by five or six robbers at around 12:00 PM the night before last, while it was snowing heavily. Each of them held a weapon and broke down the door. The whole family was awakened and ordered by the robbers not to make a sound. The robbers then ransacked the house and fled with their loot. After the incident, the victim Wu A Yuan rushed to the First Precinct of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau. After hearing the report, Chief Zhang Jiguang immediately led the patrol officers and police to search and arrest the robbers. Following the robbers' footprints in the snow, they captured five people in a straw shed in Gan Jiaqiao. Upon interrogation, they were identified as Peng Yucheng, Gu Fulin, Liu Buhua, Qiu A Bao, and Xu Yunju, all of whom worked for a living. The victim identified the two robbers, Peng and Gu, as the ones who prevented him from moving during the robbery. The other three could not be identified at the time. After reviewing the confessions, Chief Zhang instructed that the five suspects be sent to the headquarters for strict handling.</p>

<p>Amounting to a Huge Sum of 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Yuan Chang Xin Tea Shop at No. 108 North Shanxi Road, a joint venture business with a capital of 10,000 yuan, divided into ten shares, the manager, Wang Jiucheng from Shaoxing, is also one of the shareholders. Recently, other shareholders jointly accused him of embezzling over 30,000 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Ge of the Special District Local Court held a hearing. The plaintiff shareholders appointed Li Zhuoqing to appear in court and testify. Li is a woman, but holds a larger number of shares. According to Li's statement, Yuan Chang Xin was established in October of the 18th year of the Republic (lunar calendar). The defendant, Wang Jiucheng, only owned half a share, worth 500 yuan. He has been the manager since then, and the embezzled funds have reached a huge amount of 30,000 yuan. However, his fraudulent methods are very clever, and it was initially impossible to find any flaws. Later, after detailed verification, it was discovered that there were several discrepancies in the accounts. For example, the defendant's Cheng Ji account had an income of over 2,900 yuan, but this amount was not recorded in the general ledger. There were several such cases. Also, regarding the insurance fee,</p>

<p>Rumors are rife that the anti-opium authorities are preparing for a public sale of opium, causing widespread anxiety. People from all walks of life are running around spreading the news, and telegrams and letters are flying. The reason for this is said to be well-founded. The Customs has allegedly been entrusted by the authorities to draft the regulations for the public sale. Ji Hong, who claims to be an expert in handling opium taxes, has also, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, led Guanwu Shuyao Yao and Zhou Zhizhen to Taiwan to investigate the local opium public sale methods, intending to imitate them. The local overseas Chinese are extremely shocked and have sent urgent telegrams to this association to lodge a serious protest. At the same time, Wu Liande, who is close to the anti-opium authorities, has publicly advocated for the implementation of opium public sale in the newspapers and has published this article as a separate pamphlet, distributing it both domestically and abroad. Wu Liande, as a member of this association, has made such remarks, which not only violate the overall position of this association but also contradict his own consistent stance. Everyone has their own aspirations, and it is understandable that opinions cannot be forcibly aligned. However, this association should solemnly declare that it absolutely does not sympathize with Wu's personal opinions. Recently, Li Jihong, who went to Taiwan to investigate the public sale, and Wu Liande, who openly advocates for public sale, have both been formally appointed as members of the Anti-Opium Committee. Furthermore, Liu Ruiheng, the chairman of the committee, did not explicitly deny the public sale in his conversation with the Daily News reporter, as reported in the Shishi Xinbao on February 13th. This indicates that the anti-opium authorities' policy of adopting public sale is already in full swing and is by no means unfounded. The colleagues of this association, adhering to the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions and the people's entrustment, are engaged in the anti-drug movement, hoping to promote the implementation of opium prohibition. Regarding the policy of opium public sale, we have conducted many years of research and investigations in various countries. Based on our experience and findings, we deeply know that it has a hundred disadvantages and not a single advantage. Therefore, we have passed a resolution in the regular meeting to express our firm opposition. We will use our fearless spirit to protest against public sale. Now, I will present my humble opinions in the following points for the consideration of the nation: (1) Opium public sale is a total bankruptcy of political morality. Opium is a poisonous substance that can destroy a nation and extinguish its people. Public sale is an aggressive policy imposed by the great powers on their colonies. Therefore, they absolutely prohibit their own citizens from smoking, and offenders are punished with ten years of imprisonment. However, they allow our overseas Chinese to indulge in it. Their premeditation can be seen. If it is implemented in our own country, what is the difference between suicide and murder? To allow people to smoke poisonous substances through law as a way to raise funds is truly unprecedented and unheard of at home and abroad. If it is implemented, it will lead to a total bankruptcy of our country's political morality and will be abandoned by the people of the whole country. Anyone with a conscience should not consider raising funds by poisoning the people as feasible. This is the first reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. (2) Opium public sale violates international faith. Since the British smuggled opium into our country, people from all walks of life have been deeply saddened by the opium disaster and have worked hard to resist it. The pioneering figure in opium prohibition, Tang Shaoyi, first initiated and signed the Sino-British Opium Prohibition Treaty. Later, various countries signed the Hague Opium Convention, which was also signed by our country, to strictly prohibit opium within the country. Subsequently, at various international conferences, our representatives, based on the public opinion of the government and the people, opposed the great powers' implementation of opium public sale policies in their colonies and made every effort to attack and demand its cancellation. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an opium prohibition declaration on January 9th, also clearly protesting. At the international anti-opium conference on opium public sale, our representative Wu Kaisheng followed the declaration and protested at the conference. Looking at our country's words and actions towards foreign countries before and after, we have always opposed public sale. If we now take it upon ourselves, our international status will be completely lost, and our national credibility will be destroyed from then on. Thinking of this, I cannot help but shudder. This is the second reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. (3) Opium public sale violates the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions. Throughout his life, Dr. Sun Yat-sen deeply hated and detested opium. In 1924, he issued an anti-drug statement, clearly stating that opium business can never coexist with the national government empowered by the people. He also said that anyone who advocates for legalizing the opium business and allowing customs to permit opium imports in order to enrich revenue is a public enemy of the people, even as a temporary expedient. If a responsible government agency allows opium to exist for its own convenience and does not care about the long-term consequences, it is an act of treason. Dr. Sun Yat-sen created the Republic, and his instructions should be followed by future generations and should not be violated. Anyone who advocates for opium public sale is violating his anti-drug instructions. This is the third reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. (4) Opium public sale violates the party platform and the law. The Kuomintang platform clearly stipulates the prohibition of opium traffic. The laws of the National Government also advocate for the complete prohibition of opium traffic. Repeatedly and repeatedly, explicit orders have been promulgated. In November of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the central government held a national anti-opium conference, which passed 44 resolutions to completely prohibit opium. Government dignitaries and parliamentary speeches also unanimously advocated for complete prohibition and not using opium as a source of tax revenue. The representatives attending the conference, from ministers of the National Government and various departments to representatives of various countries, all swore to Dr. Sun Yat-sen to prohibit opium. All of these facts are known at home and abroad. If we now abandon the policy of prohibition and implement public sale, where will we place the Kuomintang platform, the anti-opium laws, and the first national anti-opium conference? Anti-opium laws are not child's play and cannot be changed overnight. This is the fourth reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. (5) Opium public sale will make opium prohibition worse. Proponents of opium public sale often criticize the failure of the current anti-opium laws. However, they do not know that the reason why the current anti-opium laws cannot be implemented is not the fault of the laws but the government's failure to enforce them. The authorities have not been strict in enforcing the current anti-opium laws. In cases of large officials transporting opium, smoking opium, and soldiers planting opium and providing protection, even with conclusive evidence, they have not been punished according to the law. As a result, soldiers transporting opium has become an open secret. Those in high positions and with high salaries are often criminals who violate the anti-opium laws and even take pride in violating the laws and use opium business as a source of wealth. How can we expect the people to abide by the law? It is like climbing a tree to catch fish. The public destruction of the anti-opium laws by the special opium tax in Hubei and Hunan still wants to blame the current anti-opium laws for not being able to be implemented, which is truly incomprehensible. Therefore, the urgent task today is to respect the current anti-opium laws, give full play to their spirit, and promote their implementation with strength. We should first punish the big officials who violate the law in order to influence the people of the whole country. If we abandon the anti-opium laws and adopt a public sale policy, the people will be even more disappointed, and opium prohibition will only get worse. This is the fifth reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. (6) Opium public sale is a regression of politics. Although the poison of opium is deep, the authorities in the late Qing Dynasty, recognizing the suffering of the people and the major trends of the world, were still able to sign a ten-year opium prohibition treaty with the British and implement it vigorously. Anyone who violated the law, regardless of their position, would be punished to achieve prohibition, which was praised by the world. In the early years of the Republic of China, opium prohibition was strict. When Xu Shichang was president, he did not hesitate to spend 35 million yuan to buy the British opium and burn it to show his determination. Now, the revolutionary government, at a time when the internal strife has been settled and the period of political tutelage is beginning, is proposing opium public sale. This is tantamount to admitting that what the Qing Dynasty could do and what the Beiyang government could do, our National Government is powerless to do. We deeply advocate that opium has already been prohibited once. If the government is determined, it is not impossible to prohibit it again. If we do not exert our will and instead adopt a plan to raise funds through public sale, it is nothing short of promoting the regression of politics. This is the sixth reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. (7) Opium public sale will repeat the mistakes of state-run opium. Opium public sale has been implemented in our country many times, but all have failed. The most recent example is the opium public sale implemented by the Ministry of Finance in Jiangsu and Zhejiang in 1927 and 1928, which was full of ugly scenes and numerous malpractices. It was called raising funds for the government, but in reality, the government's revenue was less than a quarter of the budget, while the sales of opium were ten times higher than in the era of private trafficking. The shady secrets can be imagined. At that time, due to the strong opposition from the people, the National Government sent Councilor Zeng Boxingshi to Shanghai to investigate. His report to the central government strongly stated that the malpractices of state-run opium trafficking were numerous. Seeing that this method was not feasible, the National Government ordered its cancellation. If we now want to implement opium public sale, we are bound to repeat the mistakes of the past. The result will ultimately be more harm than good. This is the seventh reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. (8) Opium public sale will make the political situation even more chaotic. Now, those who advocate for opium public sale often complain that the military in various provinces privately collect opium taxes, amounting to tens of millions of taels, enriching themselves without benefiting the national treasury. However, they do not know that the central government's opium prohibition and the military in various provinces are still somewhat restrained. Once public sale is implemented, the military and officials will have an excuse to openly and brazenly levy taxes and enrich themselves. They will not necessarily turn over the opium taxes to the government due to the central government's public sale. If the central government has the ability to make them turn over all the opium taxes to the government, it would be better to use this ability to prohibit opium. The ancients said, "When those above and those below compete for profit, the country is in danger." Therefore, if public sale is implemented today, it will inevitably enable the military in various provinces to open up financial resources and consolidate their positions. The result will only make the situation even more chaotic and unmanageable. This is the eighth reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. (9) Opium public sale will inevitably lead to its indefinite cancellation. Opium public sale is a source of wealth for raising funds. The colonies of various countries rely on it as the largest source of revenue for government expenses. Therefore, although our country has protested many times over the past ten years, it has been impossible to cancel it. This is because once the revenue is so large, it is impossible to give it up. The Ministry of Finance previously established a tax office in Hankou, which was nominally temporary, but has been repeatedly extended and is unwilling to cancel it because the profits are high and they are reluctant to give it up. Our country's salt tax was also a temporary expedient, but it has only recently been cancelled, which shows the endless harm caused by the initial creation. Opium public sale may be advocated for ten or fifteen years, with annual revenue of over 100 million yuan. In the future, it will be impossible to cancel it within a fixed period. Advocating for government public sale is like leading a tiger to taste human blood, which will inevitably lead to the inability to stop it. This is the ninth reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. (10) Opium public sale will inevitably increase the number of opium addicts. Since opium public sale aims to raise funds, those who handle it will do everything possible to expand its sales to increase revenue. As a result, the number of opium addicts will inevitably increase, and the opium disaster will become more severe. The previous lessons of the British and Dutch possessions in Southeast Asia can serve as a warning. In the Straits Settlements and the Malay Peninsula, Chinese opium addicts account for more than 20% of the total population. It is undeniable that opium prohibition in our country has been lax. However, the number of smokers, in proportion, is only a quarter of that in British possessions. This situation can serve as a clear warning. This is the tenth reason why opium public sale is unacceptable. In short, opium public sale has a hundred disadvantages and not a single advantage. The country's economic difficulties should be solved in a fundamental way. It is absolutely impossible to quench thirst with poison, which will lead to endless disasters. I hereby declare my views and hope that the people of the country will respond in unison. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate.</p>
<p>Wu Liande's Talk, reported by the Guowen News Agency: Mr. Wu Liande Fu Shi recently expressed his views on opium prohibition in his personal capacity, providing people with a common matter for research and consideration, which has aroused special attention from all parties. Reporters think that the issue of opium prohibition is something of concern to the whole country, and the opinions made by Dr. Wu Fu Shi are something readers would like to hear. Yesterday, the reporter visited Dr. Wu at the Jiu Jiang Za Hao office. The following is a record of the conversation:</p>
<p>I (Wu self-proclaimed) The article "The Opium Problem of Extreme Toxicity" published earlier was purely a personal observation of China for decades. "The toxicity of opium has reached its extreme, and today it has spread all over the world. Therefore, the opium problem is not a simple or local problem, but a problem of narcotics that the whole world should pay close attention to. It is not to say that China suffers the most. I am Chinese, and I have studied medicine all my life. In addition to seeking the happiness of mankind in the world, my love for my country has never gone away. Therefore, I have served the country for nearly 20 years. My words and deeds should also be well known to the people of the country. As for the object of opium, I am deeply saddened and disgusted. I believe that it is the greatest harm to mankind and a huge enemy of the Chinese nation. Since the signing of the Hague Convention, 20 years have passed. People talk about opium prohibition every day, but the atmosphere of opium is getting stronger. People talk about rejecting drugs, but the poison is spreading throughout the country. Overseas morphine factories are stepping up their efforts to produce and ship narcotic drugs to China in increasing quantities. We only hear the voice of the people rejecting drugs, but we have not seen any fundamental measures to reject drugs. Even palliative measures such as smoking cessation hospitals to give smokers a chance to quit smoking have not yet been established. Liande belongs to the people of the country, who are heartbroken by what they see, so he collected decades of experience and consulted the situation at home and abroad, considered it carefully, and published an article regardless of its shortcomings. It is not a tribute to the authorities, nor does it represent the views of any organization or group, nor is it a crazy person with ulterior motives, but a personal opinion in a question that everyone should study. The purpose is to completely ban opium and enable the Chinese nation to have a day to carry forward and magnify the light. I deeply hope that the people of the country will no longer just observe the opium problem with endless harm in a straight line and conduct in-depth research on it. Perhaps one idea in thousands of thoughts can be discussed by everyone. I especially hope that the press will give a careful identification and discussion to provide reference for the opium authorities and wake up the Chinese people's opium dream.</p>

<p>Organized by National Industrial Groups</p>
<p>The International Chamber of Commerce is a joint organization of chambers of commerce from 47 countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and France. It holds a very important position in international trade. At the first representative conference held by the Chamber in Paris, France, a few years ago, although Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, and others attended, they had not officially joined the Chamber. A few months ago, at a meeting of the China International Trade Association, Mr. Lin Kanghou of the banking community strongly stated the relationship between the International Chamber of Commerce and the future of international trade in our country at the meeting and advocated joining the Chamber in time to obtain international commercial status. The listeners were moved, so on the 7th of this month, various national industrial groups initiated the organization of the Chinese branch of the International Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, and elected Chen Guangfu as the chairman, Guo Bingwen as the vice chairman, and Lin Kanghou as the secretary-general, and on the 13th, they sent a telegram to the Chamber in Paris, expressing their official accession.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Shanghai Municipal Government Municipal Meeting <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The 174th Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government held its 174th municipal meeting on January 30, 1931. Those present were Yu Hongjun, Sun Baopei, Xi Dingyi, Tang Naikang, Zhu Yan, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Hu, Yuan Liang, Hu Hongji, Xu Peihuang, and Huang Boqiao, with the mayor (acting secretary-general) presiding and Yuan Sheng (acting) taking minutes. (A) Reporting Matters. The Chairman reported (1) The executive branch and various bureaus' budgets for the 20th year of the Republic (1931) have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be submitted by the end of January. However, the government's submitted budget for the 19th year has not yet been approved. When preparing the budget for the 20th year, it seems that we can only use the actual revenue of the first half of the 19th year as the standard. We will now actively proceed, and we hope that the bureaus will prepare accordingly. (2) In order to ensure that citizens fully understand the government's operations and eliminate misunderstandings, the government has decided to support the Municipal Promotion Association and the Municipal Research Association organized by the outside world. The association has requested that senior officials from the municipal agencies give lectures. The government has agreed to their request because its purpose is still appropriate. We hope to make contact. (B) Matters for Discussion. (1) The organization rules of the Shanghai Municipal Huangpu River Dredging Committee (originally Item 7) were discussed and approved. (2) Regarding the request to investigate the reasons for the economic stagnation of the Chinese areas, especially in terms of public works (originally Item 1), it was resolved that the Bureau of Public Works, the Bureau of Land Administration, and the Bureau of Finance should jointly formulate a plan and submit it to the government for approval. (3) The proposal to determine the route of the Pudong Yanpu Highway (originally Item 2) was resolved to be postponed. (4) The proposal to expand the police training center of the Public Security Bureau (originally Item 5) was resolved to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for research and report to the meeting for consideration. The remaining proposals will be discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Zhu Yan's Lecture on Land Issues <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The City Has a Total Area of Over 1.27 Million Mu</p>
<p>Divided into Seventeen Districts, Using Qiu as the Unit</p>
<p>Zhu Yan, director of the Shanghai Land Bureau, gave a lecture at the Shanghai Municipal Research Association in the Sichuan Road Youth Association yesterday afternoon, titled "An Overview of Land Administration in Shanghai," with over 300 people in attendance. The lecture is recorded below as follows.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I heard that the gentlemen of the Municipal Research Association here are enthusiastic about studying various issues of municipal administration in this city and have invited colleagues from the municipal authorities to give lectures here. I am very happy about this. I have been invited to give a lecture on land administration in this city. However, the content of the item is very dry, but in order to clarify the progress of municipal administration in this city, I will give a brief report on this issue. In the past, there was no such name as land issues, so it can be called a new issue. The organization of the urban area is entirely based on the city organization law and the model of the Songhu Military Governor's Office. There are places such as Shangbao and Zhoupu, or because the boundaries of several counties intersect, the boundaries are unclear. After joint discussions by the central, provincial, and municipal governments, they have all been incorporated into the administrative area of the city. In the past, Shanghai was called a certain village or a certain city, etc. Now, these names have been uniformly abolished and changed to districts. After the reorganization, the city is divided into 17 districts. The concession area is called a special district. According to statistics, the city has an area of 1,272,000 mu, of which 731,000 mu have been taken over. The public concession area has 33,503 mu, and the French concession has 21,409 mu. However, the French concession also has a so-called new French concession area, which has 13,001 mu. The name of the new French concession area is not formally leased. It is actually due to Yuan Shikai's妄想妄想稱帝称帝 in the third year of the Republic (1914). In order to obtain the recognition of various countries, an agreement was signed with the French concession to allow the right to build roads beyond the boundary. The name at the time of signing was the road area outside the concession, and its area was several times larger than the original leased area. I hope that you will pay special attention to this issue. If you want to send letters in that area, you should call it a certain place and not treat it as a concession. Even the rest of the concessions should be called a certain concession and the word "concession" should not be omitted, so as not to be ridiculed by foreigners. The small parts of the original area were previously divided into Bao Tu and Wei Hao. In Baoshan County, there was one more Qiu name. After the Land Bureau took over, it was changed to Qu Tu Wei Hao Qiu, with Qiu as the unit to avoid the unevenness of the past. Before the establishment of the Land Bureau, land administration belonged to the county magistrate, and the county magistrate could only maintain the status quo on this issue and could not have innovative methods to improve it. Even the Qingzhang Bureau (land survey bureau) run by the local gentry had no evidence and could not have improved methods to remedy it. Moreover, there were many inconsistencies in the area of the region, and its funding could only be subsidized by adding eight points to the land tax. With insufficient economy and lack of talent, its inability to achieve good results was also an inevitable fact. Therefore, after the establishment of the Land Bureau, the first task was to take over the entire Qingzhang Bureau as the basis, and on the other hand, to take over the Land Register Office and the survey Bureau of the Baoshan Hall. Now the Land Bureau has professional talents and more scientific methods, which will surely lead to a good result. The first section of the four sections is divided into five units: (1) Document Unit (2) Accounting Unit (3) Cashier Unit (4) Collection Unit (5) General Affairs Unit. The second section is divided into four units: (1) Foreign Affairs Unit (2) Public Land Unit (3) Land Price Unit (4) Requisition Unit. The third section is divided into three units: (1) Unit (2) Unit (3) Kaogong Unit. The fourth section is (1) Registration Unit (2) Review Unit (3) Single Contract Unit. A writing office is also set up outside the bureau to facilitate the writing of petitions for the people.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Provincial Order to Protect Commercial Guilds <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>County Government Receives Provincial Order and Ministry Order</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which stated, "In order to comply with the matter, the Ministry of Industry has issued a notice stating that commercial guilds in various provinces and cities have traditionally been jointly operated by local merchants or those in the same trade, with the good intention of fostering relationships and developing commerce. Recently, merchant groups in various places have reported that their guild halls are often being occupied, confiscated, or their assets sold off. If this is indeed the case, it is highly inappropriate and contrary to the duties of the Ministry. The Ministry is currently seeking to consolidate the strength of merchants, implement unity, and collectively strive to deal with the outside world. Such historical organizations should be maintained and not recklessly destroyed. In addition to issuing separate orders, a corresponding order is hereby issued, instructing the county magistrate to investigate, strictly protect, and ensure commercial stability. This order is issued."</p>

<p>Each Worker to Receive 65 Yuan in Compensation from the Employer</p>
<p>The Huayang Textile Factory on Sanggongtang Road in the Shanghai South area, recognizing that the output of foot-pedal looms was low, began to convert to motorized machines in January. As a result, twenty male workers operating foot-pedal machines, including Shi Xiebong, were laid off, leading to a labor dispute. It is reported that the dispute was resolved on February 12 through negotiations between labor and management. As a result, the employer will provide each worker with a subsidy of 65 yuan, totaling 1,430 yuan, and terminate the employment relationship.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Reasons for Increased Chinese Language Instruction in Japanese Schools <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Used as a Tool for Aggression Against Our Country</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: Due to the impact of the economic downturn, Japan's unemployment rate has reached 400,000. Last year, only 30% of university and vocational school graduates found employment, creating a difficult job market. To open up new avenues for employment and reduce the number of unemployed, Japan is encouraging emigration to Manchuria. This spring, there will be over 20,000 graduates. A survey by the Bureau of Education regarding the future career aspirations of these students revealed that nearly half desired to go to Manchuria. However, they are hindered by their lack of proficiency in Chinese. Therefore, the Ministry of Education has mandated Chinese language as a compulsory subject in all levels of schools. The stated reason is the close relationship between Chinese and Japanese culture, and the need for Japan to emphasize Chinese language. In reality, this is to train language tools for aggression against our country. Chinese language is also taught in military schools and among soldiers, further revealing Japan's ambition towards our country.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Record of the Nantong College Board of Directors Meeting <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Report on the Registration Process and Resolution to Plan Funding</p>
<p>Organize Base Property Reclamation and Request Government Subsidies</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, Chairman of the Nantong School Board of Directors, and He Yushu, Vice Chairman, convened the second Board of Directors meeting in Shanghai on the tenth of this month. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Attendees: Chu Minyi, Rong Zongjing, Qian Xinzhi, He Yushu, Zhou Zhongqi, Zhang Xiaoruo, Wu Jizhi, Xu Gengqi, Yu Youren (represented by Zhang Xiaoruo), Li Shizeng (represented by Chu Minyi), Zhang Yiou (represented by Li Yongzhen); Observers: Zhang Xiaoruo (President), Li Yongzhen (Department Head), Zhang Wenqian, Zhao Shizhen, Zhang Junwu (Head of Base Property), and others.</p>
<p>Report Items: Chairman Chu reported (1) After the organization of the Board of Directors was established and approved by the Ministry, an application was submitted for school registration. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect the school and deemed it qualified. However, it was required to have three colleges for enrollment. The school originally had three departments: agriculture, medicine, and textiles. The textile department could not be considered a college, so the Ministry temporarily approved the registration under the name Nantong College. When three colleges are established, the old name Nantong University can be restored. (2) The school has an affiliated middle school, which was previously included in the application submitted at the same time as the university. Now, according to the regulations for registering private schools, it is necessary to request the Department of Education to approve the registration. A separate form has been prepared by the Board of Directors and submitted for approval. (3) According to the regulations of the Board of Directors, in addition to permanent directors, the term of office is six years, with one-third being re-elected every two years. A re-election should be requested. (4) Due to the busy schedules of the directors, it was difficult to convene the Board of Directors, so the meeting was delayed until today. Many matters need to be discussed regarding improving school affairs, developing base property, planning funding, and reviewing and approving final accounts. President Zhang is now invited to report.</p>
<p>President's Report: (1) The school's academic atmosphere is good, teachers guide well, students are disciplined, and teachers and students treat each other with sincerity, with very little estrangement. The school rules are well observed. In the future, efforts will be made to rectify them at any time to prevent the spread of bad habits. (2) The three departments are all practical subjects, emphasizing practice. Those who fail monthly, term, or graduation exams must take supplementary exams or repeat the course. Academic performance is combined with practical research performance to determine the score, along with conduct grades. This is notified to the family at the end of each semester, so students can study earnestly. (3) According to a survey of graduates from the three departments, few are unemployed. Their service performance is praised by all, saying they have a good habit of diligence and hard work. The graduates of the previous session all obtained work immediately after graduation. (4) The school's expenses rely on allocations from the Dasheng Yarn Factory, which are still tight. Although the school has rich base property, it is currently unable to generate income to subsidize the school's expenses. (5) The school has over 110,000 mu of base property reclamation land in the fields, which suffered significant losses due to banditry last summer. Continued rectification is still needed. A more detailed report is available.</p>
<p>Resolved Matters: (1) The Board of Directors shall request subsidies from the national government, following the example of Xiamen University. (2) Prepare a request to the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture and the Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee, hoping for their subsidies. (3) The President shall send personnel to inspect the various base property lands, investigate the previous performance, and, together with the Director of Reclamation Affairs, prepare a future plan for full verification. (4) The Board of Directors shall submit a document to the Ministry of Education and forward it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the county governments in the locations of the school's base property to cooperate in protection. (5) Establish a secretariat with four secretaries to be responsible for academic, financial, and reclamation affairs, to be concurrently held by directors. (6) Resolve the method of restoring the old name for enrollment. Add a chemical engineering department to the agricultural department, or add a mechanical engineering department to the textile department, to form a college of engineering. The three department heads should first prepare a budget and submit it to the next Board of Directors meeting for discussion. (7) Resolve to recommend Mr. Cai Ziming, Shen Yanmou, and Yu Jingzhi as directors. The meeting adjourned after a group photo.</p>

<p>Defeated Qi Team 11-9 Yesterday</p>
<p>The final of the Shanghai Basketball League Group B, Division 3 was held at Huaxing last night. The participants were Jianle and Qi Team. The two teams had previously achieved the same record of nine games, eight wins, and one loss, occupying the top position. Last night at 8:30, the two teams met in a dramatic battle. At the beginning, Xie Ze of Qi Team scored with a free throw. After that, the two sides defended each other very tightly. Qi Team had more momentum, but scored few points, because the opportunity to shoot was rare. However, because of the effective defense, they were able to keep the game safe and sound in the first half. In the first half, Qi Team had four points and Jianle had zero points. In the second half, Jianle's spirit suddenly increased and there was a great improvement. In the blink of an eye, they surpassed Qi Team with a score of 5-4. Qi Team reorganized their forces and increased their efforts, and took the lead for the second time with a score of 6-5 and 8-7. At that time, the atmosphere was tense and the situation was serious. The five players of Jianle shouted and the whole team advanced fiercely, instantly scoring in the enemy's basket, leading 11-8. Qi Team added the final touches, but finally was unlucky and only scored one point. As a result, Jianle won 11-9 and won the Group B, Division 3 championship. The magnificent silver shield of the conference was taken away as a souvenir of the team. The referee was Fang Peirong.</p>

In the first half, Tongji was 17 and Jianhua was 13. In the second half, Jian Dongxiaopei opened the game with a free throw. Tongji's Luo Zhao advanced bravely and scored two goals. The score gradually increased. Tongji suddenly suffered a blow. Zhao Renjun, who was good at shooting and running, left the field due to a foul. The fighting spirit of his companions was not reduced. As a result, the sharpness was maintained. Jianhua threw the number of shots, but there were many wastes, and the gains were limited. The difference between the two teams was always around ten points. As a result, Tongji won 31-21. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Gold Standard Situation Under Development <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the seven taels posted by the swap party, the gold standard situation on February 14 was complicated and erratic. Because it was swap day, the market opened half an hour early, at 8:30 AM. The March to April swap was posted by the bulls, initially at seven taels and then at eight taels. The official opening price was seven taels and three qian, then around seven taels and a half. At noon, it was seven taels, and a portion had not yet been swapped. As usual, there were no transactions in March contracts. Most of them were converted to April contracts. However, the opening price was 774 taels and 7 qian, and the closing price at noon was 74 taels and 1 qian, which was slightly less than 9 qian from the previous day. This is based on the standard of the April contract listing price.</p>
<p>The April Contract Market Shows a Hidden State The April contract has already been launched. The market price was initially strong, but later showed a hidden state. The difference between the highest and lowest prices in the first session was ten taels. The psychology of the same industry was divergent and uncertain. Companies such as Yuan Mao Yong Tai Kang Run Bing Xing all bought in, while Heng Xing Yuan Heng Dalian Dai and others mostly sold out. The exchange rate seems to be easing, but the listed price has not moved. Overseas silver markets continue to plummet, but it is not considered to be moving. Because the European market buyers are sluggish, the gold price is still flat. Later, as buyers were active, there was an upward trend. Then, Guangbang and others sold out, and the exchange rate turned from superior to inferior. The market atmosphere was already weak, breaking into eighty taels. At noon, it was slightly stable, and later it was 81 taels. The weekly market situation has been quite intense, and the highest and lowest prices are as high as 54-55 taels. The total increase was still 7 taels and 8 qian. Yesterday was Saturday, and the market closed in the afternoon. Since the April contract opened at 782 taels in the morning, it rose to 87 taels and 5 qian after Hongli and others bought in. The big silver bar then fell by 16 points. The silver price plummeted by 1.5 points. The private telegram also went down by 1.625 points. However, the United States initially sold out slightly, and then there were fewer sellers, so people's hearts were calm. Then Zhifeng Yong sold out, and immediately fell to 3.5 taels. Soon, Yuan Mao, Yong Heng Xing Yuan and others came to the market to buy. Because Huabi bought 28 yuan of June US dollars, and Zhengjin absorbed 1.19375 of March British gold, the gold price soared, reaching 88 taels at 9:00. After that, Dade Cheng, Fuyu, Wan Xing, Shunli Lai sold, and then depreciated by 7 taels. The first order was 80 taels. The listing price was not changed. The internal was flat. Only five or six minutes later, it rose to 82 taels and 5 qian. Heng Xing Sheng Da Yuan Heng and others followed suit, turning downwards, falling 5 taels. At 10:00, it suddenly became 77 taels and 5 qian. However, the exchange rate stood still. Later, Bing Xing, Zhen Chang Xiang and other hedging teams all entered, so they gradually soared, soaring by 7 taels, reaching 85 taels at 10:15. Heng Yu and Heng Xing continued to sell, and fell back to 80 taels at 11:30. Later, there were few transactions, and the price increased slightly by 1 tael, totaling 82 taels. At the noon closing, it was 81 taels, and it had fallen to 80 taels. The highest price in half a day was 88 taels, and the lowest price was 77 taels, with a difference of 10 taels. The early opening price of the product was 83 taels, and the closing price at noon was 80 taels. The listed price was still 864 taels, a 84-tael difference. At noon, it was 84 taels. The account was recorded as 71 taels in February, 74 taels in March, 81 taels in April, and 71 taels in additional water.</p>
<p>The psychology of the industry has a trance phenomenon. Various companies, such as Tai Kang Run, Bing Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, and Hongli have all entered. Yuan Tai Zhen Chang Xiang has also entered. Heng Xing, Sheng Da Shunli, Wan Xing, and Yuan Heng have all exited. Zhifeng Yong and Dade Cheng sold out irregularly. Dalian Gang bought 300-400 bars, a total of more than 1,000 pieces. Guangbang sold more than 10 million.</p>
<h3 id="e151">From Stability to Weakness in Foreign Exchange <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the London silver market reports for British, American, and Indian currencies all showed weakness, but the buying interest was not weak, so the market remained relatively stable. The exchange rates between British and American currencies both saw slight declines, but the Shanghai market remained unmoved. The HSBC exchange rates were the same as the third revision of the previous afternoon. As for the banks' transaction prices, they were initially stable in the morning but then declined. The gold market was chaotic and without order, with fluctuations of more than ten taels within half a day, and there was also a swap market. April was high, so short positions paid over seven taels. People's hearts are still in a state of uncertainty. Limited trading by Chinese merchants saw about 100,000 pounds of British gold traded, with Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsubishi, and Shanghai banks taking in. Various banks did tens of thousands of pounds between themselves, and also twenty to thirty thousand US dollars between themselves. Fook Cheong Gold Shop and others sold slightly, while trading in Japanese gold was even scarcer. At the midday close, compared to yesterday, British gold was slightly up by 0.0625, US dollars were up by 0.125, and the Japanese exchange rate was down by 0.02. Due to Saturday afternoon, there was no market as usual.</p>

<p>Large Bars Down Another 0.3125</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegrams, the price of large silver bars continued to decline. Ground China sold, India bought at small prices, Citibank had a few sales, the market was flat, and after the close there were many buyers buying at the listed price. There were no sales from the United States. The near-term declined by 0.3125, to 12 1/8 pence (equivalent to British gold 1 shilling 2 and 1/4 pence). The forward also declined by 0.3125, to 12 pence.

<h3 id="e153">One Grade Higher in Interest, Silver Still Being Borrowed <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, banks closed in the afternoon as usual because it was Saturday. Money shops were still busy as ever due to the year-end account closing. The market made a market price, with only foreign interest rates increasing slightly. The morning market was 7 qian 2 fen 1.5 li, and the afternoon market was 7 qian 2 fen 2.5 li, a total increase of 1.5 li compared to the previous morning market. It is rumored that silver and money industries still have large short positions, and they were all covered yesterday, leading to a rise in the market price. The silver interest rate in both markets was still borrowed in white, and the clearing was also white. Foreign exchange transactions were made. In the morning market, remittance clearing was 1.24 million, and there were no banknote transactions. In the afternoon market, remittance clearing was 1.025 million, and banknote transactions were 30,000. In the off-exchange market, there were no bank settlements made in either market, so it is impossible to investigate. It is only heard that foreign settlements were over 1 million, interbank remittances were over 1.2 million, withdrawals were 1.7 million, interbank cash receipts were over 1 million, customer source was over 100,000, local collection was 800,000 to 900,000, and banknote receipts, issues, and money shop transactions totaled approximately 2 million.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Trends After the Great Change in Subsidiary Silver <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Previously, because Jiangnan subsidiary silver was trending towards stability while Guangdong angular silver was soaring, the Dalian banks thought that Guangdong angular silver was rising more than Jiangnan angular silver, so they absorbed Jiangnan angular silver and ordered more with telegrams, which led to excitement and large-scale purchases, resulting in the miraculous price of 8 qian the day before yesterday. Yesterday, there was no buying or selling, and the market calmed down, so it returned to its original position. The morning market was 6 qian 8 fen, and the afternoon market was 6 qian 8 fen 1 li, with transactions made. The morning market was 1,500 jiao, and the afternoon market was 2,000 jiao. Guangdong subsidiary silver was 6 qian 7 fen 4 li 7 hao and a half in the morning market, and 6 qian 7 fen 5 li in the afternoon market, a slight decrease of 0.05 compared to the day before yesterday. The morning market saw 220,000 jiao traded, and the afternoon market saw 145,000 jiao traded. Copper coins were reduced by 2,000 wen, to 343,000 wen.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Observations on the Year-End Closings of Financial Circles <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The silver and money industries set yesterday as the deadline to count the results of settling the 19th year of the Republic accounts by February 16. There is considerable confidence that all kinds of outstanding debts have been accounted for, and most creditors with good reputations have already settled. However, there are many who are unable to compensate for deferred payments due to unpaid or unsettled mortgages or foreign exchange. According to investigations, more than 60% of the accounts have been cleared. It is evident that the silver and money industries have been cautious in issuing loans and have used steady practices during the 19th year, resulting in favorable results. However, bad debts are inevitable, but it is still not a major concern.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Bond Prices Generally Slightly Weak This Week <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Market Conditions Quiet, Transactions Around 30 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Because this week is the end of the old lunar year, all industries are handling year-end closings, so the securities market has also returned to tranquility. Large investors are not entering or leaving much, and overall sentiment is scattered. Daily futures transactions throughout the week were still around 6 to 7 million in the first half of the week, but on Thursday and Friday, they were only in the 4 million range. On the weekend, trading was halted. Statistics show that the total turnover for the week was 29,695,000 yuan, including 6,415,000 yuan for 20-year Tobacco bonds, 5,145,000 yuan for 19-year Relief bonds, 5,400,500 yuan for Disbandment bonds, 4,600,500 yuan for 19-year Customs bonds, 3,960,000 yuan for Demobilization bonds, 2,015,000 yuan for 96 Public bonds, and 1,200,500 yuan for Reorganization 6% bonds. The other bond categories were extremely sparse, such as 625,000 yuan for Customs Tax, 185,000 yuan for Financial bonds, and although 19-year Tobacco 7-year Extension, Relief and other bonds were also offered, the turnover for each was only several thousand yuan. Furthermore, spot trading totaled 236,300 yuan, including 97,500 yuan for 19-year Customs bonds, 67,000 yuan for Demobilization bonds, 35,800 yuan for Disbandment bonds, and only several thousand yuan for the remainder. As for the trend of each bond price, except for the 19-year Customs, 19-year Relief, and 20-year Tobacco bonds, which fell slightly more substantially by 6 to 7 jiao at the beginning of the week, other bonds only fluctuated by several jiao each day. As a result, compared to last week, futures prices generally declined, except for a few spot prices that rose slightly. A statistical breakdown of the weekly high, low, and fluctuation of each bond price is as follows (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Although the Shanghai white filature saw a slight increase yesterday, the raw silk costs for manufacturers were high, and losses were still significant, so the willingness to sell was increasingly weak. Silk factories suspended work, and other Sichuan and Shandong silk merchants were also watching. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others took in 20 bales of Huang filature, and Zhonghe took in 10 bales of white Qiantang filature.</p>

<p>Jianbing sugar is currently seeing rising prices due to the continuous increase in autumn grain costs, so the numbers have held firm to all incoming goods. Top Wufu white ice is showing particular strength. It is found that the previous market price was 8 taels 7 qian per dan, but according to yesterday's telegram, it has risen to 9 taels and a half. Although it is not easy to make a large profit at once, the price of 9 taels is bound to be reached. Other brands such as Peacock, Five Hats, Double Lions, Jiao Song, Yuchun, Lion Ball, Tianming, Chunyuan, Lantian, Sanmei, Liangyi, and other high-grade products are all planning to raise prices. The first market after the year-end closing is expected to be promising.</p>

<p>Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister of the National Government, Chen Youren, recently returned from overseas. His actions are closely watched by the people. A guest discussed his anecdotes, so I noted them down.</p>
<p>Chen's fame throughout the country was really due to the recovery of the British concession in Hankou. At that time, the British consul, Amari, negotiated with Chen. After the agreement was reached, it was waiting for both parties to sign. Unexpectedly, when Chen met Amari the next day, he suddenly refused to sign because he felt dissatisfied that several British warships were docked in the river. Amari then ordered the warships to withdraw, and the agreement was made. At that time, all countries turned pale upon hearing the news and praised him as a tough diplomat. China, a weak country with no diplomacy for over a hundred years, was able to finally stand tall and proud. The people's sympathy for Chen is evident.</p>
<p>After the Nanjing Incident occurred, the foreign envoys discussed how to deal with China and submitted a protest in the name of the diplomatic corps. Chen, who was still in office at the time, said after receiving the protest, "They are plotting against me as a whole. I should divide them." Therefore, he replied separately, with different wording for each. As expected, it worked like a charm. The countries all rushed to negotiate compromises with China individually. Unfortunately, Chen lost his position due to changes in the situation, and the matter was interrupted. What a pity.</p>
<p>Chen was born in the South Seas Islands and had been overseas since he was young. Therefore, although he was proficient in English and French, he did not know Chinese. This was also a shortcoming.</p>
<h3 id="e163">A Brief Account of the Construction of Garden Residential Areas in the Capital <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Lüzhu</p>
<p>Nanjing has been a famous city since ancient times, known as the "dragon coiling and tiger crouching." After the National Government established it as the capital, its beauty and elegance were magnificent. All kinds of construction have also been carried out in an orderly manner. Recently, there has been a proposal to construct garden residential areas, so Rome and Paris cannot claim exclusive fame for this. The origins, plans, and other aspects of the capital's construction of garden residential areas are described below.</p>
<p>Origins: The Nanjing Municipal Authorities believe that the city's population is increasing daily, and housing is lacking. The existing buildings are mostly located in the southern part of the city, and the area between Xiaguan and Gulou stretches for more than ten miles, with few residents, which is quite desolate. Efforts should be made to develop and prosper the area. Also, to reorganize the municipal system, improve housing, and promote the market between Xiaguan and Gulou, it is necessary to construct garden residential areas.</p>
<p>Plans: Garden residences will be constructed in zones around Dafang Lane and Gulin Temple. Each zone will have an area of approximately 400 to 500 mu. The aim is to have the beauty of forests and springs and to avoid the noise of the city. In addition to the land for public use, all land within the zone can be purchased by private individuals by paying the price and building new-style residences according to the prescribed style. In this way, the grandeur of the capital will be prepared.</p>
<p>Steps: Currently, the construction of the first zone is starting. It covers an area of 600 mu and is located west of Sanpailou Zhongshan Road and north of Gulou. The location is quite suitable, and the terrain is high. Once the roads are opened and connected to the main line of Zhongshan Road, public transportation will be convenient. After the first zone is completed, it will continue to be expanded so that houses will be visible in the distance, as if entering a field of art. The ultimate goal is not only to alleviate housing difficulties.</p>
<p>Layout: In addition to the prescribed styles, public pavilions will be built in each zone to provide entertainment, and public schools will be established to emphasize education. Other facilities such as sports fields, playgrounds, and central assembly halls will all be made as complete as possible. The most important project is the installation of running water for each household. The first zone currently under construction pays particular attention to the construction of public pavilions, so that trees will flourish in the zone, and gardens with flowers and bamboos will be visible everywhere. Those who live in this place will have the idea of ​​urban mountains and forests. In the future, when the second and third zones are extended, roads will be built along the mountains, and residences will be built on the mountainside. The scenery will be even more secluded, just like a miniature version of Switzerland.</p>

<p>Since the two exhibitions, the Exhibition of Six Harmonies and the Winter Gathering of the Honeybee Society, Shanghai art lovers have greatly admired the works of Mr. Ye Weixin. Weixin's landscapes, flowers, and plants are fluid and harmonious, without the appearance of coldness or meanness. He is truly a talented individual. He has received the teachings of his elders and has also traveled with masters such as Yiting and Jinshu, so it is fitting that he progresses a thousand miles a day. The items displayed in the two exhibitions, such as large landscapes, have been praised by a poem written by me. Also, the paintings of willows, swallows, and white cats are all extremely refined and full of ethereal charm. The fan paintings are particularly well-honed and have an extraordinary flavor. In ordinary discussions about painting, he often emphasizes Qing Teng and does not agree with Bai Yang. Therefore, his paintings resemble Qing Teng in their vigor. However, the tranquil indifference and simple brushstrokes of Bai Yang should not be abandoned by painters. After brilliance, one returns to simplicity. Weixin is young, so he does not need to meticulously study this, but he will surely know the merits of Bai Yang in the future. This can be said with certainty. Shanghai painters, not to mention the crude and vulgar ones, often have the faults of being clear but not majestic, transcendent but not deep, straight but not curved, and dry but not moist. Weixin is majestic and moist. If he can strive for a sense of deliberation and restraint when painting freely, then his achievements will be limitless. I wrote this article not only to promote my party, but also to ask Weixin if these words are not far-fetched. (Unstamped)</p>

<p>Sa Puli is a native of Minhou, Fujian, and is the well-known General Sa Zhenbing. He is fond of good deeds and charity, and has the great compassion and mercy of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, who saves people from suffering. Therefore, the world calls him the "Bodhisattva." Last year, the three provinces joined forces to suppress the communist bandits, and the Bodhisattva brought tens of thousands of gold coins with the army to Longyan for disaster relief. The people of Longyan treated him as if he were their parents, and their praise was endless. After the 1927 Incident, the suppression troops returned to Ji Lu, and the Bodhisattva moved to Yongfu, where he guided the anti-communist work. This time, the suppression army again recovered the city of Longyan. On January 22, the Bodhisattva came to Longyan from Yongfu. Tens of thousands of people, including the people of Longyan and party, government, and military personnel, welcomed him outside the city, causing the road to be blocked. The sound of firecrackers and cheers shook the sky. The Bodhisattva was wearing a coarse cloth gown. Although he was over sixty years old, he was still quite energetic. He got out of the sedan chair and walked, nodding to the welcomers one by one. He was led to the reception center by the welcoming representatives to rest. Inside and outside the city were plastered with welcome slogans, such as "Welcome General Sa Zhenbing, with the heart of a Bodhisattva, to calm Longyan." "Welcome General Sa Zhenbing Dingming, who is compassionate and merciful and saves people from suffering." "Welcome the Sa Bodhisattva who saves the people from fire and water." "Sa Bodhisattva is the savior of the victims." "Long live Sa Bodhisattva," etc. They were colorful and extremely grand for a time. (Unstamped)</p>

<p>The seven necessities for opening a door are all related to food. The hundred flavors of cooking all depend on oil and salt, and soy sauce is also an important part of it. Cooking fish and roasting meat cannot be done without it for a day. However, in recent years, everything has been expensive, and the inferior soy sauce, when added to the dish, does not feel salty but rather sour. There is something called "Tai Oil" or "soy sauce essence." Its taste is indeed delicious, but it is rarely used in the streets for takeaway meals, etc., except for use in family cooking, because its price is high. Now, a friend said that Japan has newly invented a kind of soy sauce yeast, which is black and slightly yellow in color. Each grain is about the size of a dice in a game, and the price is very low. Place more than ten grains in a large red flower vegetable bowl, add salt, and pour boiling water over it to fill it. Stir it with chopsticks,</p>
<h3 id="e167">Small Notes on Listening to Storytelling <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Ping, Shui.</p>
<p>Storytelling is an art that originated in Suzhou. It is a form of entertainment. These days, various storytelling theaters in Shanghai are holding storytelling gatherings. When I have some free time, I often go to listen. The famous storytellers perform in turns each day, which is quite interesting. Therefore, I would like to briefly comment on some of the famous storytellers. The collaborative performance of "The Pearl Pagoda" by Shen Jian'an and Xue Xiaoqing is very popular. Although Shen's singing has a slightly hoarse voice, he is good at using melodies. His narration and expressions are just right. Xue is good at playing instruments and singing. His pronunciation is clear and pleasant to listen to, making them a perfect match.</p>
<p>"Yang Naiwu" is a book that few storytellers perform. Li Bokang gained fame for telling this story. His enunciation is clear and his singing has vigor, which is his unique quality. Although it is not pure Wu dialect (he is from the Runyu Society), it is still quite pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>Huang Zhaolin's "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" has been famous for a long time because he is focused and engaged when he tells the story. His call and response and performance of fighting stances are particularly good. It is not easy to tell the story for a whole year.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaoqing and his son's "Gold-Painted Phoenix" can be considered a signature story. (Xiaoqing's father, Heqing, was famous for this story). Although Xiaoqing is old, his narration and singing are still meticulous, and his engagement is especially rare. Other storytellers such as Wei Yuqing, whose singing has many tunes, Zhao Jiaqiu, whose voice is crisp, and Xu Jixiang, whose narration is experienced, are all top talents. The bustling city of Shanghai is a vibrant place, and listening to storytelling in one's spare time is also a way to relax. (No payment accepted).</p>
<h3 id="e168">How to Make Shrimp Cakes and Fish Balls <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Zui, Chi, Sheng.</p>
<p>Among the delicacies at the end of the year, shrimp cakes and fish balls are the most delicious. Therefore, many families prepare them. However, if they are not made properly, they will be too old or too tender, and the taste will be inferior. The ones made in my home are quite suitable, and they are of high quality and low price, which is unmatched by those sold in the market. The method of making them is described below for those who want to try at home.</p>
<p>Shrimp Cakes: First, put raw lard into a small stone mortar and mash it. (A new stone mortar has stone chips, so it cannot be used.) Then, shell the small shrimp and put the shrimp meat into the mortar and mash it together. Then add a few eggs (break the yolks together), a little salt and rice wine. (For one catty of shrimp, use one tael of lard, two eggs, and one small spoon of salt. If there is more, then extrapolate.) After mixing well, put it in your hand and knead it into a round shape. Make it while you put it in a pot of cold water. After it is made, put it on the fire and boil it. Then take it out and store it with the soup. If the weather is cold, it can be stored for many days without spoiling. If you need to fry it, put it in a pot of oil while making it, and cook it until it is light yellow. Take it out and eat it with charred salt or spicy soy sauce. Or cook it with winter mushrooms, winter bamboo shoots, and yellow sprouts.</p>
<p>Fish Balls: Remove the skin and bones of green fish (white fish is also acceptable). Mash it with the back of a knife, then chop it finely with the edge of the knife. Add cooked lard, egg white (beat it thoroughly first), water chestnut flour (mix with water), salt, and a little rice wine. (For a large green fish, use six or seven egg whites, and use the rest as appropriate.) Pound it together until it is fine. Knead it into a round shape. Make it while you put it in a pot of cold water. Then boil it and take it out and store it with the soup.</p>
<p>Brief News: The Suzhou May 30th Road Park held a goldfish exhibition last December. Since then, it has been adding tanks and purchasing species. It is said that the park has the most species of goldfish. According to the plan, ten new cement ponds will be built after hatching this year. The park will also raise fish in the several acres of ponds in the northern part of the park. Once the small fish grow up, they will be sold. The income will be used to cover expenses. It is also said that Mr. Wu, an employee of the park, has found a place in the countryside outside the city to specialize in raising fine species. He uses various scientific methods to make them develop healthily, so as to be a pioneer in promoting the fish industry in the future. Although the industry is small, it must be impressive. As for the general fish farmers in Wu, they have recently established an association to exchange ideas and compile a book on goldfish science for publication. It is currently being edited.

<h3 id="e169">Pure Talk on Narcissus <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Shen, Shou, Ruo.</p>
<p>Narcissus is known as the golden cup and jade plate. There are two types: single-petal and double-petal. Double-petal is more expensive, and people cherish it. The green leaves and white flowers are fragrant and elegant. Its charm is worthy of praise. People in the past have often praised it. In this cold weather, a pot of narcissus is placed between the ice railing and the snowy window. Looking at it, one cannot help but feel relaxed and longing. I have observed four characteristics of this flower in quiet contemplation. I record them here for pure conversation. The character of the narcissus is like a quiet and chaste woman. She is silent, does not boast, and is self-evident in her nobility. Her character is not much different from that of Lady Xi. As for its color, it is snowy and icy. It is cold and beautiful, and it is pure and beautiful. The fairy of the water and the fairy in white are comparable to it. The fragrance is clear and distant. One does not tire of smelling it. It can be friends with orchids. Compared to roses and golden millet, it is too vulgar and greasy. The most enduring taste is in its lightness and elegance. It is like tasting aged wine, like looking at a painting by a Yuan dynasty master.</p>

<p>September 1st. My Indian friend NAGAHWALTE invited me to eat Indian food. His name is Nagowardi, which means dragon. Also, the secretary of the Testimony Association, Nagonatong, also means dragon. Master Wanhui told me, "You have already obtained two dragons in India and you don't know it?" I asked if many Indians are named after dragons. Like the dragon tree in the past. Wan said, "Generally, those who are named after dragons are curious people. Few ordinary people are named after them." Nagowardi is an artist. He paints and writes poetry. He has been single for ten years. He speaks English and is a vegetarian. There are many dragons and Indian students who ask for food. According to Dr. Zhou Guangzan, who has been in India for a long time, vegetarian hotels and restaurants are everywhere in India. Indians are considered to be the most kind-hearted people in the world. On this day, I first drank Indian coffee with Mr. Nagowardi. It tastes sweeter than the Chinese style. I am not used to drinking it. Indian cups are mostly made of brass. The way of drinking is very different. They don't drink like us, with the cup to their lips. They always raise their heads and pour the tea in the cup naturally into their mouths. This is a fixed habit. Nagowardi told me that Indians never touch the cup to their lips when drinking water. They always pour it in by raising their heads. I often see Indians drinking, but I didn't pay attention. Now, according to his teaching, I always observe it. Nagowardi's words are true. After entering the restaurant, it was purely vegetarian with no meat. The way of eating is to use square banana leaves and spread them on the table. Then put the rice and dishes on it. There are corn and spicy green onions. They avoid meat and like spicy food. They don't use chopsticks, but they specially set up spoons and forks for me, as used in Western food. Indians naturally eat with their hands, according to what Fa Xian said. One thing to note is that when Indians eat, they cannot touch other people's food with their utensils. It is considered very disrespectful. Not only food is like this. You must not lightly touch any utensils, such as pipes, teacups, and cloth, with your hands. Sometimes someone buys something, but if they touch it before it is finalized, they will have to pay compensation. But from what I have seen, Indian merchants in Myanmar do not have this custom. I ate their rice, because their banana leaves also have a fragrance. A meal for two people costs fourteen annas, which is less than one yuan. It is not expensive, but it is not cheap compared to Chinese food. Chinese food here, like what I eat at the Rizai Meizhen Restaurant every day, costs three annas per meal. The tea is very good. I don't dare to persuade people to be vegetarians lately, because it is very inconvenient to be vegetarian when going out. Indians have a simple life and noble thoughts. Therefore, Gandhi's retro school of thought can shine brightly. According to people, Gandhi's non-violent resistance can only be followed by Indians. Other nationals cannot. Culture comes from the land. I think this is true. When I go to India in the future, I must observe the culture produced by its geography.</p>
