<p>議和以後。欲謀日耳曼民族之結合。爲和約所不許。今德奥稅約之議起。而各國已來反對之聲。雖經德奥政府屢次聲明。祇限於經濟方面。與政治無關。並與和約一無抵觸。然而反對之聲。終未能全消者。蓋以各國之忌德奥結合。亦明知其祇爲經濟。不涉政治。更明知其與和約無碍。而仍不能放心者。實因兩國精神上之結合也。假使德國所結合之稅約而非奥。奥國所結合之稅約而非德。則同此方式。同此情形。决無他國出反對之也。不但不反對。或且從而稱道之。仿效之也。此於民族之求生存。團結與分歧。其所異甚大也。分歧爲人所輕。團結爲人所畏。凡爲民族之一體者。可不深長思哉。</p>
<p>古之侵略人國也兼弱攻昧取亂侮亡猶必俟人之自弱自昧。自亂自亡。而後兼之攻之取之侮之也。今則更甚。千百其方法以使人弱。千百其方法以使人昧。千百其方法以使人亂而亡。而後得如食兼攻取侮之顧。有國家而圖自存者。可不深自思維而防範之哉</p>

<h3>英政府邀請德總揆游倫敦</h3>
<p>討論兩國間一切問題</p>
<p>法國又一晴天霹靂</p>
<p>白里安决謝絶參加</p>
<p>路透社六日倫敦電聞英政府已請德總理白魯寗及外長寇蒂斯以友誼而非正式之儀式來游倫敦、</p>
<p>路透社七日巴黎電報稱法外長白里安不允出席倫敦英德會議、英政府雖請其游英、但白里安謝絶之、因法國將辦總統選舉也、聞德總理與德外長五月初可到倫敦、巴黎迴聲報稱、在德奥經濟協定之霹靂一聲後、如法國接受此請、則必有不利的後果云、</p>
<p>國民社六日柏林電英政府邀請白寇二氏游倫敦消息、已由此處官方證實、惟正式請柬尙未收到、一俟收到即可應允赴約、因英德二國之政治家藉此可以晤叙一室、討論兩國間一切問題、實較正式會議便利多多也、</p>
<p>巴黎訊、英外相漢德森關於英國對德奥經濟聯盟之活動之演說、爲巴黎人士所指適、法人謂英國之提議將此問題提出國聯行政院、不過一種狡點手段、蓋一方迫德國接受英國此種延緩策略、一方並不保證德奥間之談判因此中止、法外相白里安今在國内頗失威信、因彼未能堅持反對德奥聯盟之方法意見之故、現信白里安已失其被舉爲總統以繼杜梅古之最後機會、遷舉將於下月舉行、（世界）</p>

<p>轟動一時之全國分區足球錦標大比賽、已定今日下午四時開幕、華北華中華東三路雄師、相會滬濱鼎足而分天下、不知錦標將屬誰家、今日華北華中兩路健兒、先行出馬、四時起在中華棒球塲交鋒、華北精兵、華中勁旅、一旦相逢、定一塲劇戰也、人塲券分一元防及四角兩種、裁判員陳吉祥、</p>
<h3>華北隊之陣綫</h3>
<p>華北隊陣綫、於昨晚十一時决定如下、</p>
<p>任兌　張德江　　王長頴　黄志民黄振勳　張國威　趙啟春羨鍾芬　沈崇誨　譚葆憲黄玉佳　　預備員　趙燕生　黄振聲</p>

<h3>遼寗健將到滬</h3>
<p>華北隊之遼寗後衛健將王長頴、爲東北大學學生、昨晚深夜十一時許由平浦車趕到、亦寓儉德儲蓄會、將爲華北隊生力不少、惟馮庸大學之譚福禎、因學校不准請假、不能脫身·華北頓感中堅人才恐慌、於昨晚决定暫由張國威升補、惟如不稱職、將臨時再更動、華北中堅共有四人、孫思敬·黄中孚（傷足）何憲成·譚福禎·俱不能來滬、殊爲華北隊不幸、</p>
<h3>華中隊之健將</h3>
<p>華中球隊、以往來甚疏、鮮有知其内容、此次所來隊員、更謙虚萬分、自遜其實力之不如人、實則健將甚多不可小視、舉其一二、以作介紹、中鋒袁慶武、爲武漢法政學院學生、原充右内翼、因中鋒羅傑傷足未愈、乃代替之、此人動作敏捷、指揮進退、攻打射擊、無不如意、爲華中隊前鋒之猛虎、左輔王以徳、爲漢口市政府球隊之前鋒、亦屬佼佼者、後衛趙蘭泉安穏可取、右翼蕭勃、亦稱不差、此外最可惜者、即武昌文華大學有一楊君、由中鋒之傑出人才、與袁王二人、珠聯壁合、楊君以功課甚忙、行至九江復返武昌、羅傑足傷不能出場、亦甚可惜、故華北對之、未必操必勝之權也、</p>
<h3>恊會電覆川省</h3>
<p>全國體育協進會、昨日根據前日代表團會議之决議、　關於蜀英足球隊之不能出席代表詳情、電覆四川省政府主席劉文輝、</p>
<h3>分區賽之歷史之述</h3>
<p>日來體育界同人及海上球迷、殆無不注意届全國分區足球錦標比賽、華中北東三區建兒、秣馬厲兵、枕戈待發、預料角逐疆塲、必有一番熱閙、街頭巷尾、無不引爲談助、際此攻燕飛忙、佳人羅裳初試、輕風迎面、細柳拂頭、如此良辰、亦正吾人鑑賞健兒身物手之期、况當此干戈暴發之時、凡關於分區足球已往之情形、諒亦爲同人及球迷所亟欲知者、爰搜集材料、作一系統之紀述如下、</p>
<p>前淸宣統二年、第一届全國運動會舉行於南京南洋勸業會塲、除田徑賽籃球網球外、各區足球隊亦紛紛赴會、計加入者爲華東南北西北中五隊、無形中遂成分區比賽、華南華東兩隊、得决賽資格、結果華南以一比零勝、榮獲是届錦標、</p>
<p>第二届全國運動會、於民國三年東北京天壇開會時、參加足球賽者、有東西兩部、結果東部奪行得錦、</p>
<p>嗣後國内因連年戰事、運動阅競賽、停頓多年、延至民十三年、在武昌開第三届全國運動會、乃繼續行分區足球比賽、是年參加者四隊、爲華東區華北區及湖濱與文華兩大學、華南因日期關係、未往與賽結果華東與文華得决賽權、華東以六比一得最後勝利、奪得錦標、</p>
<p>民國十四年五月、吾國爲　備參加第七届遠東運動會之全國預選、在上海　約翰大學舉行同時亦有分區足球比賽、惟參加者、祗華東華北兩隊、在天文台路中華足球塲舉行、採三賽兩勝、第一次華東以二比一勝、第二次華北以二比零勝、第三次華東又以四比三勝、由邑　薛炎生君獎銀杯一只、</p>
<p>此外華南足球隊因赴遠東運動會道經滬濱時、亦曾作友誼比賽、合併上述數次、或則在全國運動會範圍之下、或則因參加遠東會之關係而舉行、均不能稱爲眞正之全國分區錦標比賽、乃附帶提及、藉知吾國從前足球界之情形耳、</p>
<p>十三年秋、中華全國體育進會産生、鑒於吾國體育之散漫、亟謀振興聯絡之計、遂發起全國分區足球賽會、於民國十五年春舉行於上海棒球場是爲正止式分區比賽之新紀元、由華南華東二隊首先參加、華北因時局關係、未能出席、華中臨期未到、乃由東南兩隊比賽、取三賽兩勝制、結果華南以八比二及五比一、連勝兩次、得首次全國足球錦標、兩隊戰將錄下、（一）華南隊、守門陸處祥、後衛黎郁達、吳錦泉、中堅黄瑞華、後衛杜玉英、梁玉堂、中鋒黄柏松、内鋒孫錦順、梁榮德、外　光耀彭錦榮、預備員劉九易贊邦伍寳　陳焕賢領隊梁卓如、（二）華東隊、守門陸鍾恩、後衛哈元貞、馮運佑、中堅梁官松、後衛陳樸、毛志恒、中鋒卞鳳年、内鋒李惠堂、徐樂、外翼陳錦江、丁人變夔、</p>
<p>民十六年華東華南二隊、繼續舉行第二次分區賽、華東隊應召南下、與上海埠際隊同時出發香港、酣戰經過、錦標仍歸華南、是年華南以南華中華兩會聯合代表、並由已故南華體育會會長利希愼君、個人贈送大銀杯一座、下懸小銀盾十面、作十年内之錦標、每届優勝者、名刻其上、以作永久紀念、</p>
<p>民國十七年第三届復輪値舉行於滬瀆、華南區由中華會全體代表、而華北經幾許困難、率能糾合健兒、南來加入、於是分區賽會、漸呈進步現象、三方角逐、華東先以四比二勝華南、而華南川以九比一勝華北華東又以四比二勝華北、錦標遂爲華東奪得、開從前未有之紀錄、三隊戰將如下、（二）華東、守門陸鍾恩、後衛馮運佑李壽華中堅梁官松、前衛陳鎭和朱璆、前鋒奚巧生李寗照陳家球吳炎章李惠堂陳錦江、（二）華南、守門易贊邦、後衛吳錦泉黎郁達、中堅黄瑞華、前衛梁玉堂林玉英、前鋒曹桂成李惠官劉茂孫錦順陳光耀、（三）華北、守門聶輔臣、後衛高亮臣王長穎、中堅孫思敬、前衛孫廣琛杜慶祥、前鋒卞松年陳家駒于敬純杜用文王雍助、</p>
<p>民國十八年、分區比賽、應六區之要求、舉行於華北、惟華南隊因氣候不服、未能參加、由東北兩隊、竸奪冠軍、採三賽兩勝制、分别在北平天津兩地舉行、藉以促進北方民衆之注意、喚赴足球界之興趣、是提倡之良策、結果華東以三比零及一比零連勝兩次、保持冠軍、兩隊戰將如下、</p>
<p>（一）華東、守門周賢言、後衛馮運佑李寗、中堅梁官松、前衛安原生陳鎭和、前鋒奚巧生陳虞添張錫恩陳家球李惠堂陳秉祥符和　、（二）華北、守門聶輔臣黄振助、後衛蕭滌非王長穎杜用文、中堅孫思敬黄中孚、後衛孫廣琛任兌、前鋒周兆元陳錦江尹商屏于敬純崔之義卞鳳年潘作新王雍劼孫桎林、</p>
<p>民國十九年春又在香港舉行、華北則以路途遙遠、不克與賽、華南華東兩隊第一次賽、華東先勝二球、華南造成各二、乃和局而散、再决雌雄、先爲三比三和局、延長時間、各得一球、成續四對四和局、於是再作第三次决賽、觀衆達一萬七千人、爲從來未有之盛况、結果華南以四比一勝、先前兩仗、華東機會甚佳、未勝於前、而敗於後、殊可惜也、</p>
<p>今年（民國一十年）已爲第六届、參加者爲華東北中三隊、華中隊尙爲首次參加、足證分區足球之發達、及華中體育界之勃興、惜華南未能來滬、殊覺遺憾、三角對抗、結果如何、容後分解、</p>
<h3>漢滬兩市府足球隊</h3>
<p>將舉行友誼賽</p>
<p>華中足球隊中、頗多爲漢口市政府足球隊隊員、此次全隊偕同南下、挻與滬京市政府作友誼比賽現已約定上海市政府先作比賽、一擬得滬市府覆信後、即决定日期、賽後漢市府隊再往首都、與京市府及中大作友誼賽、漢市政府隊陣容如下、</p>

<h3>日輪豐浦丸撞壞江裕輪</h3>
<p>日輪肇禍後飛逃</p>
<p>貨客已派駁載滬</p>
<p>近年日輪、在我國撞船肇禍、時有發生、如新康·新大明·等慘案、已數見不鮮、交涉且無結果、詎又有日郵近海社輪撞我長江船事之發生、出事以後、日輪且潛行逃遁、茲將此事原由、分記如後、</p>
<p>江裕下水　招商局長江輪江裕號、上次因水手頭目調動、發生怠工風潮、及解决後、即啓椗赴漢、至五日晚、該輪由漢運裝旅客及大批下水貨、關回上海、途中尙稱平順、六日是上午二時、開到安慶、船正下航、不意爲日輪所撞、船身大爲損壞、甚至不能航行、</p>
<p>日輪肇禍日郵社近海部内、在我國長江一路、派輪船十一艘、往來行駛漢口大冶及日本之八幡等地、今次該社豐浦丸輪、由日本載貨來華、直放長江、至六日上午二時、時當深夜、招商局江裕輪、適離安慶、至下游五十里、地名江龍礁相近、日輪豐浦丸迎面駛來、不依航道、横衝直撞、江裕船主見而大驚、念放回聲、令日輪相讓、詎日船置之不睬、仍急切前進、江裕急即側避、而日輪之船頭、已猛撞入江裕之後尾矣、</p>
<p>撞壞情形豐浦丸爲外海船、載量尤巨、江裕船身較小、以退讓不及、被撞在江裕輪之船尾部、車翼被其撞落、舵機亦被其毁壤、苟非江裕退避迅速、則將撞在中艙、寗有倖存之理耶、被撞之後、江裕舵翼兩毁、船即不能行動、船上旅客船員、咸大驚駭、幸輪體未曾破漏、人心始安、當經船主抛錨停泊、發電求救、</p>
<p>日輪逃遁日輪豐浦丸、在肇禍後、自知過誤、應負全責、詎料該日輪竟不顧道德、非第對江裕不加助救、而更於此時、乘深夜無人得知、便掉頭不顧、逕向上水逃走、恐江裕放　板追回、該日輪乃開足馬力、向上水飛逃、</p>
<p>救護情形江裕失事後、即電滬報告、並請救護、昨日、滬局已發急電、命安慶分局、迅派駁船小輪、馳往江龍礁、先將船内之旅客貨件、駁卸出淸後、即交下水各江輪拖帶來滬、大致明日可以抵申、至江裕輪現旣不能行駛、又慮盜匪往刦、昨由李仲公電請皖當局、派兵至該地、保護船身矣、</p>
<p>交涉賠償昨日、招商局根據江裕船電報、致函日郵社近海部、要求賠償、豐浦丸輪撞壞江裕之全部損失、一面由局派工程師、至皖視察江裕之損壞情形以便開具淸單、向日郵社追索損失費、</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論地曲哀市汽車展覽會詳記  蕭國祥　　自由輪齒輪變速器引人注目　車身機件各部均有新奇改良　　地曲哀市（Ｄetloit）米西干省唯一大工業城美國汽車中心。更全世界汽車中心也。蓋每年所出汽車産額。佔全世界百分之六十。按今日全世界汽車之總數。爲三千七百餘萬輛。即有二千二百萬輛産於地曲哀市。如此可見地城在汽車事業上。佔重優越地位。人咸稱之爲汽車城。誰曰不宜。　　美國自一九二九年秋。工商業即陷萎縻不振之狀。市面凋疲。廠有餘貨。失業者衆。經濟亦隨之而入恐慌狀熊。於茲一年有餘。民衆皆希望本年全國工商業恢復常狀。當此經濟滯塞之際。祗有汽車製造可領袖百業。故本年衆目睽睽之汽車展覽會。爲工商業轉機之一大關鍵。　　美國向例。每届新年。各大城必舉行汽車展覽。以備居民之選購。地城亦循例展覽。各廠家因鑒於營業競爭。特陳列今年最新式車身機件及諸多新式發明。一時五光十色。燦爛奪目。頗極一時之盛。茲特將參觀所得逐條書之於後。　　（一）展覽會之槪略　　（一）日期一九三一年一月十七日至二十三日上午十時至晚間十時。　　（二）地址地曲哀之城市大會堂（全堂佔地面三·五西畝）　　（三）陳列之家數客車與貨車。共約三十餘家。所陳列之汽車合値美金三百餘　　（四）會塲之佈置全塲裝飾華麗精巧絶倫天花板上舗以條紋花布。中配以五彩電燈並有無缐電傳播音樂。以助觀衆之游興。　　（五）觀衆之踴躍展覽期内遠近居民無不扶老携幼。以一覩新車爲快。故一星期内。觀衆竟達十四五萬人之多。雖門票售美金七角五分亦弗顧也。　　（二）新車之重要改良　　（一）自由輪自由輪（ＦreeWheeling）滬某公司譯自動吃排現無標準譯名。按前者乃譯其字意。後者譯其功用。此種機件。發源於歐洲。去秋美國汽車界始採用之。今日採用此機而出品者。計有五家即司蒂培克。林肯。赫普。畢爾斯。奥奔是也。自由輪乃一小件機械。配置於變速箱内。利用動力原理（Ｍomentum）。對於經濟與舒適。有莫大之裨益。　　（二）齒輪變速器齒輪變速器（Ｓynerojmeshb)係單結實之機械。配置於變速盒内。可直接動作。無需管理。變速時决無衝突。而吃排時聲息全無。簡便非凡。在任何速力之下。均能運用自如。增加駕駛者便利不少。通用公司産品多採用之。如别克。亞爾斯麻皮而。奥克蘭。等等是也。　　（三）前輪拖力式前輪拖力式（ＦrkktＷheel)歐洲早已風行去歲美國祗有奥奔公司沿用之。（Ｃorb）即其出品也。普通汽車全恃後輪推進。猶之中國小車。前輪拂力式猶馬車或人力車（Ｃord）車身平低。樣式雄壯。似具有極速之能力。　　（四）避光鏡駕駛汽車者。每每因强烈之日光。或迎面之汽車射遠燈。剌花眼目。以致發生意外者頗多。今林肯公司特製避光鏡二件。配置於駕駛者之前面玻璃頂上。可隨意升降。該鏡係藍色折充玻璃所製。配件雖小。但功用甚大。希望他公司亦仿效之。　　（五）金屬備輪護套昔日備輪。悉以布套護之。破壞甚易。且欠美觀。故多數公司皆製鍍鎢鵭鋼質護套。旣改良質料。復增加汽車之美觀。　　（六）水箱罩牌此乃本年添配新件。裝於水箱前面。亦係鎢鵭鍍鋼質。形似　綱。可阻空中雜物穿入水箱内。除此功用外。對於裝飾汽車首部不少。大多數高貴車皆用之。　　（七）新式登車板鑲嵌橡皮苦式登車板大都木製。外包鐵片。日久易銹。新式車板太半嵌以長條橡皮四五道。除延長其生命外。增加穏妥不少。　　（八）汽缸增加全塲陳列之新式汽車。除福特·都讓二公司及英製之奥斯汀孩兒車仍用四只汽缸外。其餘最少有六只汽缸。八只汽缸十二只汽缸。甚至有十六只者。可見進化趨勢。悉以多缸式爲優。　　（九）車價較廉今年新式汽車之車身引擎。較前堅實。售價不但不增加。而反减少數十元至數百元不等。賤價車中如福特者亦减去三四十元。互市競爭。一般觀衆。無不嘖嘖讀議嘆。　　（十）新式催速板新式改良催速板爲駕駛機中之最重要者。舊式板之面績。微嫌太小（二寸對方）。雖有副板以歇足。仍不舒適。且時有足力不匀。使車巔簸之虞。新者則較廣闊。（長五六寸）（闊三四寸）上面嵌以橡皮。可容全足。催速時。足部旣可久踏不倦。而汽車行動。亦徐徐有規。中價及高價車咸用之。　　（十一）嬰兒式車美國本無嬰兒車（ＢabyCar)去歲始有英式歐斯汀嬰兒車問世。現分銷美之各部。該公司深信營業上有相當把握。但依余觀察。則前途甚難發展。蓋此等嬰兒車並非美國社會之所要求。其所以能暫時推銷者。全賴美國人民一時之好奇心而已。一旦好奇心衰。則前途營業。難以樂觀。猶之五六年前吾國麻雀牌之風行一時也。又法國車馬特牌（Ｍathis)嬰兒車亦在陳列中。聞都讓公司現在製造中。五月間即可出品。　　（十二）電影廣告電影廣告共有兩處。一爲克雷斯勒之試車片。一爲派卡零件公司放演新發明之升車機Ｐoroat此機係配於車身下部。人不之見。需要時駕駛人搬動手杆升車機立即踏地。將後部。一輪舉起與地相距一尺許。若要移動車身。掉轉方向。或遇停塲擁擠時可運用此機。即可達到目的。隨心所欲。無往不便。如遇後胎炸壤時。可利用此機將車升起。無需用他種升舉器。尤覺省事。此機之發明。對於汽車進化中有莫大貢獻焉。現禮和大號及派克大號車。業已正式配置。余希望將來可成爲標準裝置也。　　（十三）次要改良諸次要改良中。如燦爛之油漆。卯形之射燈。方形之表板。堅厚之撞板等。及其他小件。不勝枚舉。改良中各公司仍保持夙有之美譽。如别克之雜壯。克底拉之華麗。派克之高貴。福特之廉價是也。　　（十四）福特展覽先鋒車會塲之西北隅。專關爲福特展覽先鋒車之用。按照改良次第。陳設多種。觀覽之餘。令人追想。今昔交通之不同。陳列中有上古埃及王馬車一坐。汽車芒芽時代之一缸車數輛。悉購自歐洲。美國馬曳之大棚車一輛。其中有三輛福特車。最爲特色。一爲福特九九九號跑車。該車係福特本人設計及親自手造。在一九零五年。奪得競賽香檳。次</p>

<p>之爲Ｔ式之跑車。一九一零年復奏凱旋。最後一輛乃福特之第一千五百萬號。（十五）感想參觀此偉大展覽會後。感想叢生。回憶美國開國不過百數十年。而其汽車事業祗三十年耳。由胚胎時期。沿至極盛時期。不數十年。而有今日之豐功偉績。可見其人民經營之毅力。及進取之志趣。誠可欽偑也。我國地大物博。號稱四萬萬。仍株守中古時代之生活。工未之振興。商未之進展。交通之阻碍如故。民智不開。而科學方面。尤屬故步自封。懶於進取。專賴利權外溢之舶來品。以致國困民窮。今而後希望靑年同志。協心努力。研求專門學識。以總理奮鬥之精神。負責策劃。竭力提倡。則我中華交通事業前途。始樂觀也。德國之平治汽車　　德國工藝。著稱於世。而戰後出品。視前尤大進步。即以汽車而諭。自引驚車身底盤以及車之任何部份。其設計構造。無不倍極精優。彌臻美境。故其聲譽日隆。而銷路亦益廣。其中最爲人所歡迎者。厥爲本埠圓元園路百德洋行經售之平治汽車。斯車爲德國著名平治汽車製造廠。戰後彈思竭慮。刻苦研究。精心結構而成。機械工程之精良。車身製造之堅優。固已有口皆碑。而其式樣新奇。華美壯觀。尤爲難得。德國之平治汽車司帝倍克七十九周紀念  黄影呆　　司帝倍克。亦爲汽車中之佼佼者也。而歷史之攸久。更較其他車廠爲甚。蓋司帝倍克廠自成立以來。迄今已七十九年矣。二月十六。該廠曾舉行七十九周紀念。頗極一時之盛。此次之紀念含有兩種意義。一方在紀念過去之歷史。一方在慶祝近來事業之發達。在過去之十二個月中司帝倍克所産汽車。因引擎製造之革新及進步。在汽車事業上確已佔領優勝之地位。而觀夫司帝倍克引擎改造之成功。主要原因。即係用活動及齒輪全權控制兩法也。司帝倍克車廠。其在美國也。目前雖處汽車競爭。日益緊急之時。然顯然已有穏固之地位。資本之濃厚。尤爲他廠所不及。蓋目今資本總數。已有美金一○○·○○○·○○○元。我人啓窮源歸本。回顧司帝倍克八十九年來之歷史。亦不無興味也。　　一八五二年二月十六日。有亨利司帝倍克Henry　Studebaker及克蘭姆Clem　Stndebaker弟兄二人者。在一小鎭之上、設一鐵店。資本僅六十八元。蓋已罄其二人所有矣。其初所製者。僅限於車輛上所用之鐵具。曁而信譽是隆。事業日見發達。國内各地。皆有分店。而兩弟兄亦遂因以致富爲時無幾。三弟約翰司帝倍克Jhon　Studebaker。見二兄之成功。因亦加入合作。至十九世紀末葉。司帝倍克。已一變而爲極大之車廠矣。製造精良。物質優美。所産車輛。各地人士。莫不歡迎。嗣後復隨運輸事業之進步。逐漸改良。至一九零四年。開始製造用　司令燃燒之汽車。亦即今日之汽車。觀司帝倍初創之時。資本旣少。規模又陋。焉知七十九年而後能成此偉大車廠。實出意料之外者也。如以司帝倍克新車。爲近來之最新出品而言。則有三種。即八缸車。活輪車。及六缸低價車之用活輪者。當紐約汽車展覽會開幕之時。各種新車。均有陳列。頗得來賓之贊美。而八缸新車之中。又可分出總統號牌八缸。指揮八缸。及指令關八缸等。至於六缸新車。旣用活輪。而售價之低廉。又屬得未曾有。故大受顧客之歡迎。在美國汽車市塲之上。此種新車。銷路亦最發達。蓋無論何人。經濟方面。皆有購買此種車輛之力量也。　　司帝倍克車廠。除上述各種新車而外。尙有低價運貨車。載重自一噸半至兩噸。用以轉運貨物。赤甚相宜。他和公共汽車。傷兵運送車。運柩車。偵探車。救火車等莫不應有盡有。且皆採價廉物美之政策。是故銷路之發展。皆有勝人一籌之槪。然司帝倍克之銷路發展。其中最大原因。却在有活輪之裝置而不在價格之低減。蓋此外如弓箭牌及林肯牌兩種汽車。一九三一式均採用活輪。而銷路亦較往日爲發達。足證活輪之採用。足以推廣銷路。且據最近統記。司帝倍克自去年採用活輪以來。美國各地之車輛登記。已由百分之十。一躍而至百分之十五矣。　　▲啓事　大道·影·吉人·卓·丁祖澤·融若·沛甘·悟非·三原·篔·諸君鑒。上月稿費。業經結出。乞於本月十日起。向本館會計處領取爲荷。汽車新聞部啓。</p>

<h3>Liu Xiang Orders Troops to Cease Offensive</h3>
<p>Two Lius Agree to Meet in Luzhou for Consultation</p>
<p>Deng's Troops Hand Over Defense Area of Huayang</p>
<p>(Chongqing) By the 5th, Liu Xiang's pacification army in Chongqing had successively occupied the five counties of Hechuan, Wusheng, Tongliang, Bishan, and Dazu. Chen Shunong requested surrender. To show leniency, Liu ordered the front-line troops to cease the offensive on the 6th. Li Qixiang, Luo Zezhou, and Yang Sen jointly launched a counter-offensive. It is rumored that Suining was captured by Yang's army on the 2nd. Liu Wenhui of Sichuan is mediating the Sichuan war and has telegraphed Liu Xiang of Chongqing, agreeing to meet in Luzhou on the 11th to discuss the aftermath. The Sichuan war is unlikely to escalate. (6th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deng Xihou telegraphed his representative in Beijing, stating that the decade-long chaos in Sichuan was mostly caused by selfishness. The military believes it is privately owned, leading to unlimited expansion of various units. With a limited military district, it is impossible to supply an unlimited number of troops. Therefore, if the garrison area is insufficient, it is followed by military conflict. The cycle of war is all caused by this. I am pained by the unconsciousness of past cyclical wars. To promote peace and unity, I intend to start with the individual, eliminate selfish concepts, and recognize that the military and military regions are owned by the state. Individuals cannot be selfish. Therefore, I will hand over the 11th Division, Chen Hongwen's unit, to Chairman Liu for commissioning, and return the Huayang defense area to the provincial government to set a precedent for unifying the Sichuan situation. My initiative is small, but the impact will be significant. If the goal of peaceful unification of the Sichuan situation can be achieved, I will hand over all the current defense areas and troops to benefit the people of Sichuan, which is even more beneficial than military and political unification.

<h3>Circumstances of the Suspension of Power Transmission by the Japanese Union News Agency</h3>
<p>Leaflets Slandering National Government Discovered</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomatic official said that the suspension of telegram and telephone services by the Japanese United News Agency is very reasonable from the Chinese side. The distant cause was the frequent instigation by the agency during the war last year, which the government had warned. They replied that due to obstructed communication, there were occasional false reports, admitting their mistakes and promising to be careful in recording when communication resumed. However, after the cessation of hostilities, they still did not change their ways. Most seriously, on February 3, they stirred up trouble with news of the Guangxi Incident, etc. The government protested to Japan on one hand and suspended the agency's power transmission on the other. The government acts with impartiality, so it did not suspend the power transmission of other Japanese newspapers because the United News Agency was too outrageous. Recently, Sasaki of the Union News Agency requested Japanese reporters in Beijing to submit a protest to the Japanese Charge d'Affaires Shigemitsu in the name of the Japanese Reporters Association, requesting liberation. The Japanese Charge d'Affaires has not yet forwarded it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the agency has reprinted leaflets in Shanghai, slandering our government. The leaflets were discovered in Beijing this morning. Under these circumstances, the authorities may, if necessary, deport Sasaki. (7th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Germany and Austria and the Indian Hindu and Islamic Religions</h3>
<p>The Indian nation unites its efforts to resist England. However, the conflict between the Hindu and Islamic religions in India has not been able to achieve harmony and unity. Since the end of the European War, Germany and Austria have been trying to combine the Germanic peoples. The pursuit was not permitted by the peace treaty. Now, the issue of the German-Austrian tax union has arisen, and various countries have voiced their opposition. Although the German and Austrian governments have repeatedly stated that it is limited to economic aspects and has nothing to do with politics, and does not conflict with the treaty in any way, the voices of opposition have ultimately not been completely eliminated. This is because other countries fear the union of Germany and Austria, and although they know it is only for economic reasons and does not involve politics, and they also know it does not violate the treaty, they still cannot be at ease. This is actually due to the spiritual union of the two countries. If Germany's tax union was not with Austria, and Austria's tax union was not with Germany, then with the same method and the same situation, no other country would oppose it. Not only would they not oppose it, but they might even praise and emulate it. This shows a great difference in seeking survival, unity, and division among nations. Division is looked down upon, while unity is feared. Those who are part of a nation should think deeply about this.</p>
<p>In the past, invading a country meant annexing the weak, attacking the ignorant, taking advantage of chaos, and insulting the dying, but even then, it was necessary to wait for the people to be weak, ignorant, chaotic, and dying before annexing, attacking, taking, and insulting them. Today, it is even worse. There are thousands of ways to weaken people, thousands of ways to make them ignorant, and thousands of ways to make them chaotic and dying, and then one can shamelessly annex, attack, take, and insult them. Those with a country who seek to survive must think deeply about this and take precautions.</p>

<h3>British Government Invites German Chancellor to Visit London</h3>
<p>Discuss All Issues Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Another Thunderbolt for France</p>
<p>Briand Decides to Decline Participation</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: It is reported that the British government has invited German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius to visit London in a friendly, informal manner.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th: It is reported that French Foreign Minister Briand will not attend the Anglo-German meeting in London. Although the British government invited him to visit England, Briand declined because France will be holding presidential elections. It is said that the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister may arrive in London in early May. L'Écho de Paris reports that if France accepts this invitation after the thunderbolt of the German-Austrian economic agreement, there will be unfavorable consequences.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The news of the British government inviting Brüning and Curtius to visit London has been officially confirmed here. However, the formal invitation has not yet been received. Once received, the invitation will be accepted, because it is more convenient for politicians from Britain and Germany to meet in person and discuss all issues between the two countries than a formal meeting.</p>
<p>Paris: British Foreign Secretary Henderson's speech on Britain's activities regarding the German-Austrian economic alliance is criticized by Parisians. The French say that Britain's proposal to submit this issue to the League of Nations Council is just a cunning trick. On the one hand, it forces Germany to accept Britain's delaying tactic, and on the other hand, it does not guarantee that the negotiations between Germany and Austria will be suspended. French Foreign Minister Briand has now lost considerable prestige at home because he has failed to insist on methods of opposing the German-Austrian alliance. It is now believed that Briand has lost his last chance to be elected president to succeed Doumergue. The elections will be held next month. (World)</p>
<h3>Secret Treaty Concluded Between Italy and Spain During the Rule of Primo de Rivera</h3>

<p>Purely Commercial in Nature</p>

The semi-official newspaper of Afghan King Nadir refuted the letter with rather激昂words. The Indian government, in order to please Nader, issued this order.</p>

Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone, Tokyo, 7th: Railway Minister Egi explained the private proposals of the three major investigation committees at today's cabinet meeting as follows:</p>
<p>The investigation committees are broadly divided into two types, namely the Administrative and Financial Investigation Committee and the Tax System Investigation Committee. The former is composed of two or three ministers of state and a very small number of members, while the latter is composed of a relatively large number of members, including members of both houses, as well as scholars and industrialists. A preparatory committee is established to handle the preparatory matters for the investigation committee. The preparatory committee has the following three types: (1) "Administration" is headed by one minister of state, assisted by the director of the Legislative Bureau, the chief secretary of the cabinet, the director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and several other people; (2) "Finance" is headed by the Minister of Finance, with the vice-ministers of finance, the participating officials, the director of the Budget Bureau, and the councilor of the Legislative Bureau; (3) "Tax System" is headed by the Minister of Finance, with appropriate assistants. The investigation matters should be completed in full by mid-August, and submitted to the budget after cabinet discussion in mid-September.</p>

<h3>Former US Interior Minister's Bribery Case Rejected on Appeal</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 6th: Former Interior Minister Fall was accused of taking bribes after allowing a certain government oil field to be taken over by private individuals during the term of the late President Harding.

Song Ziwen, Sun Ke, Ma Fuxiang, Kong Xiangxi, and Wang Zhengting attended, with Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Li Shuhua, Zhang Weihua, Yu Feipeng, Chen Rong, and Lu Bichou in attendance as observers. Vice President Song Ziwen presided over the meeting. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) The Ministry of Railways submitted that because of the difficulties in railway operations, the ministry had previously requested an increase in freight rates on various railways, starting with the Jinghu and Huhangyong railways, to make up for the losses. The Executive Yuan Council approved the request. Now, the freight rates for the remaining railways have also been carefully considered, and the proposed increases are as follows: 1.

Passenger and freight tickets for the Xiang'e railway will be increased by 10%; 4.

Passenger and freight tickets for the Beining, Zhengtai, Guangjiu, and Guangshao railways will not be increased for the time being. The increases listed above are very small and reflect the consideration of people's livelihood in the midst of making up for losses. Furthermore, the method of increasing freight rates is proposed to be implemented from May 1 of this year. The proposal is hereby submitted for your review and implementation. Decision: Approved. (2) Minister of Interior Liu submitted that, in order to clarify officialdom, he humbly presented the following methods in terms of examination, appointment, treatment, and rewards and punishments: 1.

(4) The Relief Commission submitted the revised organizational regulations for your review and forwarding for promulgation. Decision: To be sent to the Legislative Yuan. (5) The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Interior jointly submitted that, after being handed over for review of the case of promoting domestic goods resolved by the Internal Affairs Conference, after detailed review, it was decided to merge the original three methods into "All agencies and personnel serving in the government should, in principle, use domestic goods for the items they need, and the competent leaders should promote and supervise them to arouse the public's awareness of domestic goods. Foreign goods may be used only if there are no domestic goods available for adoption." Is the above appropriate? We hereby submit our reply for your review and implementation. Decision: To be handled accordingly. (6) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission submitted the budget for the Dalai Lama's representative reception fees and travel expenses, humbly requesting prompt approval and ordering the Ministry of Finance to allocate and issue the funds in full.

<h3>The Ministry of Interior Takes Over Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>Today (7th), Zhu Jiuying, Director of the Land Department of the Ministry of Interior, reported on the radio on the Ministry's takeover of water conservancy. He stated, "National water conservancy was originally the responsibility of the Construction Commission. Since the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee that the Construction Commission should focus on design, guiding national construction, and be directly under the National Government, and not be listed as an administrative agency, when this case was transferred to the Executive Yuan, it was decided at the Eighth Council Meeting that the water conservancy work handled by the commission should be completely handed over to the Ministry. The Ministry followed the government's order and sent personnel to take over. As of the 2nd of this month, most of the files have been taken over clearly, and a method has been agreed upon by both parties. The command and supervision of all water conservancy agencies and the issuance of funds will be the responsibility of the Construction Commission before the end of March, and will be the responsibility of the Ministry from April 1. The above is a general overview of the Ministry's takeover of water conservancy. After the Ministry takes over, regarding the incomplete designs of North China and Taihu Lake, we will urge their speedy completion. For the designs that have been completed, we will find ways to start construction and have already suggested to the central government that some funds be appropriated from the Boxer Indemnity for the construction of completed projects in North China. As for the Yellow River, the Construction Commission had previously collected and sorted out the original Yellow River plans and gradually made headway. The Ministry plans to convene a meeting of the river affairs bureaus along the river to formulate a unified governance method and actively implement it. The necessary funds have been allocated from a portion of the Boxer Indemnity and will of course be able to develop smoothly in the future. Regarding the Grand Canal, in January of this year, the National Internal Affairs Conference, based on the proposal of Zhang Honglie, Director of the Shandong Construction Department, requested the central government to establish a Grand Canal Engineering Committee. The conference resolved to have the Ministry adopt and implement the proposal. It was found in the reasons for the original proposal that the sections of the Grand Canal in Suzhou and Changzhou are silted up, and merchants are raising 500,000 to 600,000 yuan to dredge them. It can be seen that the dredging of the Grand Canal cannot be delayed. However, doing it piecemeal will ultimately be a matter of doubling the effort and halving the results. The Ministry plans to consult with the provincial governments concerned with the Grand Canal to agree on a unified governance method and establish a committee in the central government to coordinate the handling."</p>
<h3>The Collapse of the Jiangxi Red Bandits is Imminent</h3>
<p>Triumphant Reports Arrive from All剿匪 (Bandit Suppression) Armies</p>
<p>Huang Hanxiang Arrives in Pingxiang to Appease Peng and Huang</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: He Yingqin is leading all the bandit suppression armies. The first step, to eliminate scattered bandits in various counties, has been completed. The second step is now underway, involving an attack on the Communist bandits' bases in Ningdu, Guangchang, Ruijin, Shicheng, Huichang, and other places. At the same time, post-disaster management is being carried out in the major bandit areas to eliminate the root of the problem and suppress the source of the unrest. Regarding the elimination of scattered bandits in various counties, reports have been telegraphed from various units in recent days, briefly summarized as follows:</p>
<p>In the northeastern Jiangxi region, the bandit nests of Kong Shao and others have been destroyed by Ruan's troops. Minister He received a telegram yesterday from Division Commander Ruan, stating that Tang and You attacked to Mingyangguan. They encountered the Red Tenth Army, with approximately 2,000 rifles. After a fierce battle of six hours, the bandits were defeated and troops were sent to pursue them with the aim of eliminating them. In this battle, more than 400 bandits were killed, more than 30 were captured, more than 50 rifles and 6 Mauser pistols were seized, and countless propaganda materials were seized. Our officers and soldiers also suffered more than 40 casualties, etc.</p>
<p>In the southern Jiangxi region, the 19th Route Army had already recovered Chongyi, Xingguo, Ningdu, and Yudu county towns. However, scattered bandits still filled the countryside. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief ordered his troops to advance along the Xiaobu-Huangpi line for search and destroy operations. The headquarters recently received a telegram from Jiang in Ganzhou, stating that the pseudo-army commander Luo Binghui (the rebel Jingwei team leader), who occupied the area around Chongxianxu, with approximately 2,000 men, was attacked by our Zhang brigade. After a fierce battle of two hours, they were defeated. In addition to killing more than 100, many were captured, and the remaining bandits fled in disarray towards Donggu. Our army is currently in pursuit. Furthermore, Jiang Guangnai, in a midnight telegram, stated that according to a report from Ma brigade Yang regiment, more than 1,000 Red bandits attacked Xiaqiao last night. Our army met them head-on and inflicted heavy casualties, causing them to collapse and retreat. This morning, our army launched an attack on the bandits in Lianhuakeng, killing one company commander and one battalion commander of the bandits, as well as 80 to 90 bandits. The remaining bandits fled to Chang'an. This morning, they continued to pursue and suppress them in Chang'an, with the aim of completely annihilating them.</p>
<p>In western Jiangxi, Taihe, Wan'an, and other counties were previously recovered by Gong and Luo's divisions. However, Suichuan still has remnants of Li Mingrui's troops, and the Lianhua and Yongxin areas still have refugees requesting the dispatch of elite troops to suppress the bandits. Director He has already telegraphed Wang Jinyu to send troops there. The Xiushui and Tonggu areas in northern Jiangxi were originally areas where the bandits Kong Hechong and Li Shixing appeared. Yesterday, Division Commander Tan telegraphed a report, stating that according to Yue Changzhou's telegram, the Red bandits captured confessed that the bandit party would hold a mass meeting in Pingtian today. At 7 a.m., I dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them. Upon arriving near the area, they encountered hundreds of bandits carrying spears and dozens of bandits carrying guns who were gathering for a meeting. Upon seeing the arrival of the large army, they put up a brief resistance and then fled in different directions. The battalion pursued them fiercely, killing dozens of bandits and seizing dozens of spears. The large Communist bandits within Wuning have now been suppressed, and all the bandits' organizations have been destroyed. Furthermore, according to Zhu Brigade Commander Zhouwu's telegram, Kong's pseudo-Ninth Division sneaked into Luxi, Pingxiang on [day of month unclear]. They encountered our ally (Wang Jinyu's troops) and were repelled. The next day, they were defeated by Wang Jianbo's battalion at Kuiyuqiao, and fled to Cihua, where they joined forces with the pseudo-Li battalion and other bandits to attack the western flank this morning. They were then surrounded and attacked by our Deng Yi battalion and police team, resulting in the death of more than 300 bandits. The bandits have suffered repeated heavy blows and their strength is completely depleted. The remaining bandits have fled in four directions and have few bullets left, making it easy to annihilate them.</p>
<p>According to military sources, Director He has issued a second general offensive order. Zhu and Mao's main forces are still in the Huangpi-Xiaobu-Dongshao area and are already surrounded on all sides. Furthermore, the supplies of oil, salt, rice, cloth, and daily necessities in the bandit areas have reached a state of exhaustion, and there is no way to replenish ammunition. Therefore, there is extreme panic within the Communist bandits. In addition, hooligans and local ruffians, taking advantage of the Communist Party's power, have arbitrarily engaged in arson, murder, and plunder, causing the people to rise up and oppose the Communists. The Communist bandits have shown a sign of collapse. The surrender of Peng and Huang is said to be gradually becoming a reality. Huang Hanxiang has already consulted with He Jian in Hunan on all matters, and has gone from Hunan to Pingxiang to negotiate with the responsible representatives of Peng and Huang on the surrender and acceptance of pacification. Director He received a telegram yesterday from Huang in Pingxiang, stating that he would depart from Hankou to Xunyang on the second to come to the province to consult the headquarters on all matters in order to further negotiate with Peng and Huang in western Jiangxi. If so, then Zhu and Mao will not be difficult to subdue. (April 4-5)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Case of the Japanese Soldiers Killing Chinese Civilians in Hankou</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Acknowledges Compensation, Punishment of the Culprit, and Apology</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Japanese naval personnel stationed in Hankou, during field target practice, accidentally shot and fatally wounded farmer Ni Zhaomei. The Hankou municipal government has already lodged a protest with the Japanese consul. Zhou Zechun, special commissioner of foreign affairs for five provinces, also sent an official letter to negotiate with the Japanese consul. On the fourth, an official letter was received and Zhou went to the Japanese consulate to begin negotiations. The Japanese Consul General Sakane Junzo and Vice-Consul said that the Japanese navy stationed in Hankou did target practice in China this time without notifying the Chinese authorities in advance and without proper equipment, resulting in the unfortunate event of shooting and killing Ni Zhaomei, and that your country should bear full responsibility. Zhou immediately put forward three conditions: compensation, punishment of the culprit, and apology, and asked the Japanese consul to fulfill them. The Japanese consul then gave a reply, and Zhou refuted it in detail based on the facts. After two hours of debate, the Japanese consul fully acknowledged the three conditions and continued to discuss the amount of compensation. After a decision was made, Zhou retired and went to the municipal government to seek Mayor Liu Wendao's approval of the negotiation process and agreed conditions. Liu felt that it was feasible, so Zhou went to the Japanese consulate to jointly sign the agreement with the Japanese consul. He also telegraphed the details of the settlement to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification. As for the implementation of the conditions, the compensation was collected by Zhou and handed over to the municipal government, which in turn ordered Ni's family to provide a guarantee to receive it. When receiving the payment, Director Wan of the Thirteenth Sub-Bureau also signed to certify it. As for the punishment of the culprit, the Japanese consul sent a letter to the Japanese naval commander to carry it out and guaranteed that such unfortunate events would not occur again in the future. Furthermore, since our country is currently in the midst of suppressing Red bandits and it is also a busy farming season, target practice in the field should absolutely not be carried out again at this time. After the spring plowing season is over, if target practice is desired, the dates and locations must be notified to the Chinese authorities ten days in advance so that the people can be informed. As for the apology, the Japanese consul made a formal written apology to the municipal government after signing the case. (April 6)</p>
<h3>The Process of Suppressing Newspapers in Wuhan</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Wuhan branch of the National Government recently convened a joint meeting of party, government, and military officials, believing that Wuhan newspapers were complex and that reactionary elements might be mixed in to disrupt propaganda. They proposed a discussion and decided on four measures for suppression, which were handed over to the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus of the Hankou municipal government for strict enforcement. For a time, newspaper operators, with the exception of the Zhongshan and Wuhan party newspapers, the Wuhan branch of the Central News Agency, the Hubei News Agency sponsored by the provincial party department, and the Sanmin News Agency sponsored by the municipal party department, were all greatly affected. It is known that in Hankou, only six newspapers, including Zhongshan, Wuhan, Xinmin, Zhongxi, Xinwen, and Gonglun, are issued in three large sheets, with Xinmin being particularly prominent among commercial newspapers. There are more than 20 four-sheet daily newspapers, 40 to 50 three-day tabloid newspapers, and 80 to 90 news agencies, all registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. There are even more that are not registered. The Wuhan branch of the National Government believed that during this period of bandit suppression, the complex and varied opinions of the newspapers could easily provide an opportunity for reactionary factions to spread rumors. Therefore, a joint meeting of party, government, and military officials was convened to decide on suppression measures. Among the measures, special attention was paid to the three-day publications, which were all ordered to cease publication by April 1. Daily newspapers and small news agencies must pay a deposit of 2,000 yuan, and the qualifications of the organizers were restricted to graduates of specialized schools or above, or those who have passed an examination. Otherwise, they were required to stop publishing by April 10. After the Social Affairs Bureau forwarded this order to the newspapers, the four major commercial newspapers, including Xinmin, Zhongxi, Xinwen, and Gonglun, and the larger news agencies, such as the Hankou branch of the China Daily News, Zhonghua, Jingguang, Weiyan, Guangming, and Daoqun, jointly petitioned the Executive Headquarters to screen them. After receiving the petition, He sent a letter to Yang Zaichun, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the four major commercial newspapers had a long history and were not subject to suppression. News agencies also had to be dealt with carefully. On the 6th, he expressed his opinion, saying that Wuhan is located in the center of the country and is an important political, military, and commercial center. Therefore, Wuhan's public opinion is also extremely important. However, the current publication of Wuhan's tabloids and the establishment of news agencies are like bamboo shoots after a rain. Upon investigation, their records and comments are nothing more than baseless rumors and unrestrained slander, causing social unrest. If this continues, the dignity of journalists will be destroyed by these people. In addition, the disturbances by Red bandits in various regions recently have made local security particularly important. The Wuhan branch of the National Government bears the responsibility of maintaining security and suppressing Red bandits. Therefore, it must take decisive measures to prevent reactionaries. It is determined to suppress the small newspapers that spread rumors and cause trouble, and the news agencies that engage in extortion, in order to maintain local security, relieve the people's suffering, and eliminate harmful elements for colleagues who are truly working hard in the news industry. As for news organizations with solid achievements, not only will they not be suppressed, but they will also be given considerable assistance to become sound public opinion, so as to supervise the government and guide society. This is the recent process of suppressing newspapers in Wuhan. (April 6)</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression in Southern Shandong</h3>
<p>The Bandits in Mengshan are About to be Eliminated</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Han Fuju personally went to southern Shandong to command the troops in encircling and suppressing the bandits in Baodugu and Mengshan. The bandits in Baodugu, relying on the natural defenses, have been building stone walls on the top of the mountain in an attempt to resist stubbornly. Han has ordered the troops to set fire to the grass and trees on the mountain to remove the bandits' barriers, and then attack. The troops of Gu Liangmin's 22nd Division have engaged the bandits in Mengshan several times. Now, Gu's division has advanced to the north of Feixian County, not far from Mengshan. The telegram from the chief of staff of the division reporting the bandit situation is recorded below: "To Vice Division Commander Li Jinhui of the Twenty-second Division,</p>
<p>We arrived at Lanmazhuang on the east day. Today, my Xue regiment came into contact with bandits in Luoquanyu and Wanshou Palace, and Kong regiment came into contact with bandits in Shangyehua and Sanluan Village for several hours. The bandits fled in the direction of Yangshulin and Sizuo Fort. In the winter, they again came into contact with bandits in Yangshulin for seven hours. The bandits were overwhelmed and fled to Huangdou'an. In this battle, dozens of bandits were captured, more than a hundred were killed, and dozens of men and women hostages were rescued. The bandit movement is very panicked. The Mengshan area should be cleared soon. Chief of Staff Tao Qinghai Jiang."</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Red Bandits Executed in Shandong</h3>

<h3>Italian Man Sues Over the Eastern Railway Case</h3>
<p>Former Italian Consul in Harbin, Chierici</p>
<p>Seeks 330,000 in Debt from the Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Eastern Railway owes 338,000 rubles for the Ussuri Railway, and has recently been sued in the Special District Court by Chierici, the former Italian Consul in Harbin. The case is currently under trial. The origin of the matter is that from 1906, Chierici contracted with the Eastern Railway to repair the Ussuri Railway, with a contract price of millions of rubles. The repair work gradually stopped midway due to the Russian Revolution. In 1920, when the Eastern Railway calculated the accounts, Chierici was supposed to receive tens of thousands of rubles in contract price. Just as the Eastern Railway was preparing to make the payment, the value of Italian rubles suddenly plummeted. Chierici then requested that the payment be made according to the market price on the date of the contract. At that time, Chierici did not dispute the accounts listed by the Eastern Railway, and the Eastern Railway had already paid part of the money. Chierici argued that the reason for calculating according to the market price on the date of the contract was that the Chinese courts had always made judgments in this way in various cases. The Middle East Railway Bureau and the board of directors repeatedly reviewed this case. In 1927, the board of directors resolved to give Chierici 21,000 gold rubles as the price for the engineering work from 1906 to 1912. As for the contract price of 338,000 rubles for the period from 1914 to 1917, it was refused, claiming that the railway bureau had hundreds of thousands of rubles in Siberian paper money, which was a considerable loss. Chierici said that the railway bureau had accumulated a large number of kjang posts, which was voluntary, but the contract price must be calculated according to the market price on the date of the contract, because the wages of workers and materials were all paid in cash. Later, after receiving part of the money, Chierici sued the Eastern Railway in the Chinese court. Several reconciliations were carried out during this period, resulting in a delay of many years. The Eastern Railway also asked Chierici to directly sue the Soviet Union or the Ussuri Railway, but Chierici refused and appealed to the Northeast Branch of the Supreme Court. Just as the new civil law was promulgated, the railway bureau asked the branch of the Supreme Court to cancel the case on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired. Chierici then submitted a certificate from the Nanjing government proving that the newly promulgated civil law did not refer to cases that had already been sued. Therefore, the case involved the issue of legal statute of limitations due to the lawsuit itself, and another two years passed. Recently, the Northeast Branch announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment to be implemented on April 4. Whether the Eastern Railway is responsible for repaying the debt on behalf of others depends on the judgment of the court. (April 2)</p>
<h3>Situation of National Assembly Elections in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial National Assembly election was previously limited by the Provincial Office, in accordance with the election schedule, to the election of representatives of the first phase of industrial and commercial groups and professional groups, which must be elected before April 20. Therefore, the counties have been in the voting election period in recent days. The second phase of the election is for agricultural education groups and freelance professional groups. Because the establishment of agricultural education associations was slightly later, the representatives will also be elected before April 30. However, the election registers of the counties are limited to be sent to the Provincial Office before the 8th for review. Currently, more than half of the registers have been submitted to the province by the counties. Supervising Director Hu was concerned that the counties that had not yet arrived might have delays due to the deadline being imminent. Yesterday, he sent an urgent telegram to Zhenjiang and more than 20 other counties, urging them strictly. The original telegram said, "Supervisors of elections in various counties, it has been ordered repeatedly in the case that the registers of agricultural associations, education associations, and freelance professional groups should be sent to the office before the 8th of this month. If the aforementioned registers of the county are sent after 12:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the 8th, this Supervising Director will not review them, include them in the general election register, and should be punished for delaying the election administration. A special telegram is sent for notification, and you should immediately comply." It is expected that all counties may be able to send them all within the next two days. It is also heard that although most of the industrial and commercial and professional group representatives in the counties are in the election, Haimen, Donghai, Chuanzhou, and Sha counties had completed the elections yesterday and telegraphed the results to the Provincial Office.</p>
<h3>Fire in Xiaguan Extends to More Than 200 Homes</h3>
<p>A fire suddenly broke out in the Longtoufang of the Xiaohuo train department by the river in Xiaguan, Nanjing, yesterday (the 6th) at around 7 p.m. It was extinguished after burning until a little after 9 p.m. A total of 300 to 400 tile and thatched houses were destroyed, which is truly a great disaster. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The cause of the fire was Ji Qishan, a native of Bao Ying County, Suzhou, who is 32 years old and resides at No. 113 Longtoufang, Xiaguan Riverside. He has been working as a worker at the Jinghu Station in the coal port. His family of several people is still able to make ends meet. Yesterday (the 6th) happened to be the Qingming Festival on the lunar calendar. According to folk customs, it is customary to worship ancestors and sweep tombs to express filial piety. Therefore, at around 7 p.m., Ji had just finished work and returned home. While preparing dinner, a woman whose name is unknown suddenly burned paper ingots on the open space behind his house to help the souls of the dead. For a time, she failed to be careful, causing the burned ashes to be blown by the wind onto the thatched roof of Ji's house, causing it to catch fire.</p>
<p>The woman, seeing the situation, knew that she had caused the disaster and immediately fled without a trace. By the time Ji discovered it, he quickly ran out to look, and the fire had already burned through the roof and could not be saved. At that time, a strong wind suddenly rose, and the fire was aided by the wind, and its power became even stronger. It immediately spread to the neighbors on the left and right, gradually spreading, and had already become a prairie fire. For a time, thick smoke filled the air, and the fire illuminated the sky. The residents of the nearby area all helped each other, carrying the young and old, and evacuated to escape. Then, the section, Gang police and the railway bridge Wanghuotai madly sounded the alarm whistle and alarm bell, and reported the alarm separately. The number of affected households Soon, the Xiaguan Fire Brigade of the Police Department and the Xiaqiao Fire Brigade, the Catholic Church Fire Department, and others rushed to the scene one after another after hearing the news, and tried their best to put out the fire. However, the wind and fire were too strong at the time, making it extremely difficult. It was not until after 9 p.m. that the remaining fire was extinguished. It is estimated that the fire burned from No. 113 to No. 102, and from No. 9 to No. 56, No. 83 to No. 97, and No. 123 to No. 127.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>No. 140 to No. 144. In addition, there is also No. 2, which was also affected. A total of about 200 households were burned, and 300 to 400 tile and thatched houses were destroyed. The total loss is considerable.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Summary of County Administration Meetings The 102nd County Administration Meeting of the County Government resolved the following important cases: (1) Regarding the case presented by the Seventh District Office on the budget of the Security Corps, and requesting to continue to levy the mu tax for the Security Corps for three years and to include the 110th and 2nd maps of the Zhenxing Township in the district for joint levy, the resolution was to submit it to the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments of the Provincial Government for review and instructions for compliance. (2) Regarding the issue of funding for the Literacy Movement Committee and the district offices, which was previously resolved by the 96th meeting of the committee, the County Government and the Education Bureau would allocate funds equally from the county's local funds and social education funds. Now, an instruction from the Provincial Government states that the education and social education funds of each county have been included in the budget and designated for specific purposes, and it is difficult to allocate them for the use of the Literacy Movement Propaganda Committee. It should be funded entirely by the County Government. The resolution was that the county's local reserve fund is used for many purposes and cannot be allocated again. Fundraising is particularly difficult. The County Government ordered the Literacy Movement Propaganda Committee to further reduce the expenses to a limit of 600 yuan to save money.</p>
<p>Pinghu Robbery Suspect Apprehended A robbery occurred on a ship sailing from Shanghai to Pinghu last month at Tangkou, and a staff member was injured. The Water Police Chief of the First District, Xu Pucheng, arrested two robbers, Zhou Kaizhang and Wang Songlin, and suspects Tang Sanxi, Zhou Lüshi, etc., and sent them to the command headquarters on the evening of the 6th. They confessed to conspiring with others to rob the Pinghu ship at Dongwangchuan in Tangkou on March 20, and the booty was divided among them without any doubt.</p>
<p>County Government Stops Lantern Lighting in Seven Dous The Seven Dou Town has been holding folk lantern lighting entertainment for days. Magistrate Jin heard about the matter and, considering it to be within the period of rural cleansing and fearing that bandits might be mixed in to cause trouble, dispatched a police team to the countryside yesterday to stop it. However, the lantern lighting did not stop last night, so the two lantern leaders and two horse brand lanterns were taken back to Songjiang for investigation.</p>
<h3>Jinshan</h3>
<p>Defense Forces Ordered to Transfer Jinshan's banditry is the most severe in Lüxiang. In September of last year, it was robbed three times, and the district chief and bureau chief were both killed. Later, the tenth company of the 26th regiment of the Fifth Division of the National Army, led by Wen Lingshi, stationed troops to suppress and capture them, and the entire territory was secured. Now that the force has been ordered to transfer, a public banquet was held locally on the 30th afternoon, and a citizens' farewell meeting was held at 7 a.m. the next morning, with more than 1,000 people attending.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Announcement of National Assembly Representatives for Industrial and Commercial Groups Kunshan Industrial and Commercial Groups elected National Assembly representatives on the 5th at the County Government and the County Chamber of Commerce at the same time. From 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., more than 150 people went to the two places to vote. County Magistrate Pang personally went to the scene to supervise the election. The results of the ballot counting on the morning of the 6th showed that the most votes in the Chamber of Commerce were for Cheng Ganqing, Yu Xiaochuan, Zhang Shouyi, Cai Guohua, Lan Bohua, and Qian Sunqing. The next most votes were for Shen Zhiwan, Fang Weiyi, and Yang Hanxi. The most votes in the labor union were for Hui Jiyuan, Qiu Lilu, Zhang Hentian, Chen Changgeng, Cao Pinru, and Wang Jianqiu.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Election of People's Registers Submitted for Provincial Review: The county election supervisor has repeatedly received telegrams from the general supervisor urging the submission of the election people's registers from various groups for review. It is now known that the registers of the Baihe Jiangzhu Jiage Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Farmers' Association, Newspaper Reporters' Association, and Education Association, have been sent to the county government successively. After review by the county government in conjunction with the county party headquarters, they will be submitted to the province for review. Except for the registers of the Baihe Jiangzhu Jiage Chamber of Commerce, etc., which have been reviewed by the province and returned for announcement, the register of the Qingpu County Chamber of Commerce was not submitted to the province due to a delay in compilation, so it has no voting rights this time.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A Major Fire Outside Xumen Claimed Eleven Lives: Outside Xumen, south of the Jieguan Pavilion along the city wall, was originally an open space. Over the years, people from Jiangbei have successively built thatched sheds, now reaching more than 300 households. Most of them are engaged in rickshaw pulling and apprenticeship. The day before yesterday (the day before yesterday) was the Qingming Festival according to the lunar calendar. The residents of each shed household had ancestor worship and burned paper money. A woman who was three months pregnant asked her family to celebrate the festival around 11:00 AM. While burning paper money, she was careless, and the sparks from the paper money were suddenly blown by the wind onto the thatched roof. The fire spread rapidly and uncontrollably, eventually spreading to the neighboring thatched huts. For a time, the fire was blazing, and the residents fled in panic, unable to enter and retrieve their belongings. The nearby Third District of the Water Police Bureau immediately reported the fire to the city fire brigade by telephone, notifying various fire brigades to rush to the rescue. However, because the fire brigades were attending the public memorial service for Shi Jinkui, a martyr of Qingming, at Huqiu, only five fire engines went to put out the fire, allowing it to spread. The fire was finally extinguished around 12:00 PM, after consuming a total of 143 thatched households. Afterwards, due to discrepancies in the number of people investigated by the affected households, they flocked to the fire site to dig through the debris. By 5:30 PM, eight fire-scorched bodies had been unearthed. The names of the deceased were: (1) Girl Erbao, only eight months old; (1) Girl Yang Sankouzi, five years old; (1) Girl Guo Suzhen, two years old; (1) Girl Guo Hongzi, five years old; (1) Girl Zhao Qiaoyuan, five years old; (1) Grandmother Zhang, the grandmother of Zhang Xiaosheng's son, 89 years old, also her father Zhang Er'er, 47 years old, and his younger brother Zhang Erqi, 6 years old (Note: The Zhang family, three generations of grandparents and grandchildren, all perished in the fire, which was the most tragic). The local Baodi Jiang Xinfabao reported to the local court prosecutor's office to request the dispatch of personnel for inspection. The court immediately sent Prosecutor Qian for inspection at 6:00 PM that night. About thirty to forty people were burned and injured, and the head of the Third Branch, Min, sent them to various hospitals for treatment. That evening, the affected households numbered three to four hundred, all hoping for relief from charitable organizations. Surprisingly, by yesterday morning (the 7th), no enthusiastic philanthropists or gentry had come to provide disaster relief, which was very doubtful. Around 10:00 AM, three more bodies were unearthed from the fire ruins: (1) Girl Li Suzhen, two years old; (1) Wu Jinyi's mother, 64 years old; (1) Mrs. Liu, six months pregnant, 40 years old. Baodi Jiang Xinfabao also reported to the court for inspection. Subsequently, Wang Chengmo, a patrol officer of the First Branch Office, ordered the police to take Li San, who started the fire, to the Third Branch for investigation.</p>
<p>Fishmongers' Strike Under Mediation: More than 3,000 fishmongers in the Suzhou fish industry went on strike because various fish firms changed the old regulations, converting the cash code to the foreign code and abolishing the foreign liters, relying on debt. They publicly elected Wang Renfu as their representative and submitted petitions to the government and the County Chamber of Commerce for relief. The county government has now sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to mediate. The County High Chamber of Commerce sent letters to both parties on the 7th, urging each to appoint two responsible representatives to mediate.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The Zhenyu Patrol Ship Mistakenly Killed a Fisherman: Zhang Zulin, a resident of Huazhuang Town in the Fushan area, invited four or five neighbors on the 4th to drive a small boat to catch crabs near Tiehuangsha. Around 12:00 PM, the Zhenyu patrol ship stationed in Hupu was patrolling the sea. As it approached Tiehuangsha, it saw a small boat in the reeds opposite with four or five people sitting inside. The ship suspected it was a bandit ship and fired several shots from the side of the ship with rifles while continuing to advance at full speed. Unfortunately, Zhang Zulin, who was catching crabs, was hit and killed. It is now reported that the family of the deceased will request county relief.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Huiquan Mountain on Qingming Festival: Huiquan Mountain in Wuxi is known as the second spring in the world. Every year in February and March, tourists from all over come to Wuxi, shoulder to shoulder. Therefore, during this time, the city's hotels and restaurants are more than three times as profitable. Since the opening of Meiyuan in the western suburbs, tourists from all over have abandoned Huiquan Mountain and traveled to Meiyuan. In recent years, Yuantouzhu and Xiaojishan in Yuantouzhu have also been decorated, attracting a large number of tourists. The land and water routes are never quiet. This year, with the pleasant weather, even more tourists have come to Wuxi from afar. On Qingming Day, tourists were like clouds everywhere, and hotels on the road were full, which was unprecedented in recent years. Cars on Tonghui and Kaiyuan Roads honked their horns incessantly. The public buses on Kaiyuan Road broke the historical record of business, with daily ticket revenue ranging from 300 to 500 or 600 yuan, which shows how many tourists there were.</p>
<p>Singing Tanhuang Evolved into a Martial Arts Drama: The 15th district of the county (i.e., the Qingcheng City area, including Yangjiaxu and Wuxiangshang), performed Tanhuang the night before last, and there were many spectators. Yesterday, it was agreed to perform in Shenxiangshang, but people from Dongcunqiao forcibly called them away, leading to a real sword and spear fight between the people of Shenxiangshang and Dongcunqiao. It is unknown how the local rogue Zhou Rongquan had his left leg stabbed with a knife, causing profuse bleeding. The matter is currently under negotiation.</p>
<p>Adultery Case Transferred to the County Court: Feng, the wife of Pu Jirong, the owner of the Yongwanfeng cigarette shop at the entrance of Sibao Alley outside the North Gate, recently had an affair with Yang Hongkun. Pu found out about it. The day before yesterday, he pretended to go to Shanghai to purchase goods. Feng then invited Yang to her house for a secret meeting. Pu returned home and caught the two red-handed, handing them over to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who then sent them to the County Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, they were transferred to the County Court. After a hearing by Prosecutor Zhou, Pu Jirong was ordered to take back, and Feng and Yang Hongkun were detained.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Residence of the Escort Team Leader Was Robbed: The 14th Escort Team of the Railway Artillery Team of the National Revolutionary Army of the Capital arrived in Changzhou from the capital on March 14th and was stationed at Taiping Temple near Wenbi Pagoda outside the East Gate. Team Leader Guo Jinghan and Special Agent Liu Shizhang then rented a private house in Tangminfang under Taiping Bridge as their residence. On the 5th of this month, Team Leader Guo went to Shanghai on official business, leaving only Special Agent Liu Shizhang at home. Unexpectedly, around 8:00 PM, four robbers wearing gray military uniforms broke into the bedroom, seized two leather suitcases and two cloth suitcases in the room. Special Agent Liu Shizhang stepped forward to grab the leather suitcase, resulting in a stab wound to his chest. Guo's maid, Zhang, also stepped forward to hold onto the handbag tightly, but the robber stabbed her fiercely in her left waist. Zhang was injured and released her grip, and the robbers fled with the loot.</p>
<p>Winter Tax Extension Requested for Half a Month: The deadline for the Wuyi 19th year winter tax was originally scheduled for April 2nd. However, only 40% of those who paid on time did so, and the collection was not prosperous. The reason was the low price of grain, and the farmers' storage had not been sold. Director of Finance Liu Hongzhao, out of consideration for the farmers, specifically submitted a request to the Finance Department yesterday to extend the deadline by half a month. Whether the request will be approved, and a late payment penalty will be levied after the deadline, is pending instructions.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Election of Representatives from Industry, Commerce, and Civic Groups: Jiangyin began the election of National Assembly representatives on the 5th. A total of 146 electors from the Chamber of Commerce group were present. The results of the ballot count showed that Wu Shuying of Jiangyin, Qian Sunqing of Wuxi, Yu Xiaochuan of Zhenjiang, Wang Jingting of Jiangdu, Shen Zhigao of Wujiang, and Hu Yuzhang of Baoying received the most votes. On the 6th, the election of labor union groups was held, and 552 electors were present. The ballot count began around 3:00 PM, with Zhang Hentian, Hui Jizhi, Wang Ciqing of Wuxi, Chen Changgeng of Nantong, Cao Pinru of Nanhui, and Wang Jianqiu of Guanyun receiving the most votes. It was also decided that the election of representatives from the Farmers' Association would be held on the 20th.</p>
<p>Tax Collector Missing, Fate Unknown: Tang Mingyu, a grain merchant from Xinshenggang in Rugao, crossed the river south on the 14th day of the twelfth lunar month of last year to collect a loan of 583 yuan from Zhang Dechun (i.e., Zhang Zigeng), a businessman in Hugang, but was unsuccessful. He stayed overnight at Zhang's place and disappeared the next day. Zhou Xiaolu, the manager of Chen Wansheng's business, learned that Tang had been murdered by Zhang and filed a complaint with the county government. Yesterday (the 6th), Zhang Zigeng was detained, but he denied the accusations. Auditor Wu ordered him to be released on bail and summoned the plaintiff for further questioning on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Recent Situation of Clearing the Countryside in Jiangsu Province: The Jiangsu Province countryside affair was originally handled by the Department of Civil Affairs, and the deadline was the end of February. However, very few could effectively handle it. Since the establishment of the Rural Clearing Bureau, many have been allowed to extend the deadline for one month, and strict supervision has been effective, and the results have improved slightly. However, many counties have not yet completed the process and have requested an extension. The General Bureau has taken into account the facts and funding situation and has agreed to extend the deadline, but will not allow the use of provincial or local funds. Only administrative expenses can be used in each county as a warning to those who are negligent. It is heard that the most rapidly processed county in the countryside clearance work in each county is Wujiang County, followed by Jinshan. As for the pacification work related to the countryside clearance, the Jiangnan aspect is the responsibility of the Baoan Department's Director, and the Jiangbei aspect is the responsibility of the Pacification Supervisor's Office's Chief Commander Liang. Counties that cannot carry out the countryside clearance will first carry out the pacification, and then carry out the countryside clearance after the pacification is completed. Recently, in order to facilitate rapid communication, the Pacification Supervisor's Office specially dispatched Staff Officer Li to Zhenjiang to liaise with the Rural Clearing Bureau. The Rural Clearing Bureau has also hired Councilor Li to serve concurrently as a countryside clearance councilor to connect the two.</p>
<p>The Minyan Branch Director Extorted Bribes: Ma Yuebo, the chief of the Fifth Branch of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, recently demanded a bribe of ten yuan per day from the Tianchan Stage in his jurisdiction. The Provincial Public Security Bureau's inspector found the evidence and presented it to Director Chen. After verification, it was found to be true. Minister Hu of the Ministry of Civil Affairs believes that the provincial capital is related to the observance of the entire province, and now public security personnel dare to blatantly extort money in public, which is extremely illegal. In addition to dismissing the chief, he also ordered Director Chen of the Provincial Public Security Bureau to quickly transfer the branch director to the local court for severe punishment in accordance with the law, as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Election of Chamber of Commerce Representatives: The Jiangdu County Government held the election of Chamber of Commerce National Assembly representatives in the auditorium on the morning of the 6th. Representatives from various industries in the Chamber of Commerce attended, including 295 people from the urban area, 22 people from the Guazhou area, 22 people from the Daqiao area, 135 people from the Yiling area, 140 people from the Xiannv area, and 20 people from the Shaobo area. Voting began at 9:00 AM and the ballots were opened at 3:00 PM. As a result, Wang Jingting of Jiangdu received 625 votes, Yu Xiaochuan of Zhenjiang received 596 votes, Qian Sunqing of Wuxi received 523 votes, Shen Zhiwan of Wujiang received 489 votes, Lan Bohua of Tongshan received 486 votes, and Li Shengbo of Nantong received 448 votes. The second-highest number of votes was Hu Yuzhang of Baoying with 317 votes.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Kidnapper Jia Xingrong Arrested in Zhenjiang: Han Daosheng, the leader of the first team of the Gaobaoyou Patrol Team, previously captured a suspected bandit Jia Xinggui and sent him to the Sixth District of the Water Police. After interrogation by Inspector Zhao, he confessed that his brother Jia Xingrong had previously served as the captain of the local county's Fisheries Public Security Team and had kidnapped the six-year-old son of Wu Zhu of Minjiaqiao last year, extorting 3,000 yuan, and was now hiding in Zhenjiang. After obtaining the confession, Inspector Zhao dispatched detective Xu Bin to Zhenjiang to arrest Jia. He was arrested yesterday and has been sent to the district headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Transfer of Water Police Team Leader: The Ministry of Civil Affairs has now transferred Lu Shangzhong, the captain of the 15th team of the Third District of the Provincial Water Police Team stationed in Suzhou, to the province for further assignment. His vacancy will be filled by Zhang Guifang, the captain of the 25th team of the Sixth District stationed in You. Zhang's vacancy will be filled by Gao Zhongkui.</p>
<p>Chang Chong Detective Arrested: The Sixth District of the Provincial Water Police Team stationed in You received a letter from Jushangzhuang stating that a Chang Chong District Headquarters detective was extorting money in the countryside. District Chief Cheng ordered the police to arrest him. Wang Xiaoxizi was arrested yesterday and sent to the district headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Rural Clearing Expenses Still Temporarily Advanced by Local Authorities: Since its establishment, the County Rural Clearing Bureau has had no regular funding, nor any rural clearing donations or household registration donations to draw upon. It has been temporarily borrowing from the Fund Property Office. Director Zhang also believes that the office is also struggling and unable to continue to raise funds, so he specifically requested the Department of Finance to have the full amount of rural clearing expenses paid by the provincial treasury. According to the Department of Finance, the provincial government found that the treasury was extremely tight and difficult to cope with. On the 6th, it ordered the county government to temporarily borrow the rural clearing expenses from the local authorities, and then report the results after the rural clearing is completed to determine the method of repayment.</p>
<p>Haimen Requests Allocation of Zhang Deng's Property: The Haimen County Government, in accordance with the order to dispose of Zhang Deng's property, specifically consulted the Nantong County Government to allocate the Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company industry owned by Zhang Deng according to its composition to fund Haimen's education expenses.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Thatch Houses Stolen by Guests and Burned One After Another: A thatch house belonging to Xu Jiulian, a guest residing in Pulong Lane in the city, caught fire accidentally due to careless cooking at noon around 11:00 AM on the morning of the 6th. Fortunately, the neighbors on the left and right all came out to put out the fire, which was extinguished before it could spread. Also, around 1:00 PM on the same afternoon, a thatch house belonging to Jiangbei guests in the North of the Rising Sun outside the East Gate was also burned down. Also, around 8:00 PM, a thatch house belonging to a guest farmer in Xiangyi South of Dasi Bridge outside the East Gate suddenly caught fire accidentally. The fire was not extinguished in time and was completely burned down.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Patrol Officer Gambling Dismissed: Gambling is rampant in Jiaxing, and gambling incidents occur frequently inside and outside the city. They are all secretly protected by the patrol officer, so very few are cracked down on. Recently, Chen Wanli of the Guanyinge Branch Station was involved in gambling again. After County Chief Gong learned about it, he ordered the County Public Security Bureau Chief to strictly investigate and ban it. Chief Gao successively found that Patrol Officer Chen was inviting people to gamble in three private homes, profiting from it. Therefore, on the 6th, he ordered the patrol officer to go to the bureau, dismissed the patrol officer from his post and placed him under supervision, and sent him to the court for interrogation that afternoon. In court, Chen denied that he had gambling and profited from it, and said that handling public security easily incurred resentment, leading to being framed. He was ordered to be released on bail and wait for witnesses to be summoned to court for further questioning.</p>
<p>Disputes Over Cloth Donation Bureau's Arrears: When Fan Yunbai, the former director of the Jiaxing Second District Cloth Donation Bureau, contracted the donation to the Department of Finance, Zhang Liuan provided the guarantee and included the First and Third Districts. After the abolition, the total amount of arrears in the three districts reached more than 40,000 yuan. Zhang Liuan had applied to the Department of Finance to withdraw the guarantee midway, but was not approved. The arrears have not been settled clearly. Now the Department of Finance has ordered the Jiaxing County Government to recover the arrears from Zhang Liuan. However, this matter has become a stalemate, and it is unknown how it will be resolved in the future.</p>
<h3>Anhui</h3>
<p>National Assembly Elections Actively Underway: Since its establishment, the Anhui National Assembly Representative Election Office has been actively working on the elections. Recently, the Central Executive Committee telegraphed Anhui, designating Ning Kun, Fang Zhi, Wu Qiyun, and Wang Jianjin as candidates for party members from Anhui Province, and Chen Diaoyuan as a candidate for the special party department. It also set a deadline of April 15th to complete the elections. The election supervisors of each county appointed by the Provincial Rectification Committee have already set off to the six designated areas. The election office is also actively proceeding with various matters. However, the number of voters is very large, and the register needs to be printed urgently. There are very few printing presses in Wanyuan, and it is difficult to print it all at once. A special letter was sent to the Huaining County Rectification Committee, the County Government, and the Provincial Public Security Bureau to instruct the Minyan and Xinwan Duo newspapers to suspend publication for five days from the 7th to assist in rushing the printing. The Republic Daily newspaper, which is directly under the Provincial Propaganda Department, was also ordered to suspend publication for five days.</p>
<p>Business Tax Actually Levied: The Anhui Province's implementation of business tax is an important measure to offset the loss of tax revenue. The Department of Finance has announced the recruitment of 28 staff members for the collection of business tax. Recently, the commissioners have reported the establishment of offices to launch the tax. The provincial government has stipulated that the business tax in the province will be collected in forty-two-month installments each year. The first installment will start in April and end at the end of April, and all overdue taxes must be paid. At the beginning of the first phase, it is inevitable that merchants will wait and see. Yesterday, a proclamation was drafted and issued to the commissioners, earnestly persuading merchants to comply with the regulations, fill out and submit applications within the time limit, and promptly pay the first installment of taxes for this year. The county magistrates and public security chiefs of each county were also telegraphed to seriously assist the chambers of commerce.</p>

<p>Clash at the Baseball Field at 4 PM Today</p>
<p>Liaoning's Wang Changying Arrived in Shanghai Last Night to Serve North China</p>
<p>The highly anticipated National Regional Football Championship is scheduled to open at 4 PM today. The three powerful armies from North China, Central China, and East China will meet in Shanghai to compete for the championship. It is unknown which team will win the title. Today, the athletes from North China and Central China will take the lead. They will clash at the China Baseball Field starting at 4 PM. The elite soldiers of North China and the strong troops of Central China will definitely have a fierce battle when they meet. Tickets are divided into two types: one yuan and four corners. The referee is Chen Jixiang.</p>
<h3>The Lineup of the North China Team</h3>
<p>The lineup of the North China team was decided at 11 PM last night:</p>
<p>Ren Dui Zhang Dejiang Wang Changying Huang Zhimin Huang Zhenxun Zhang Guowei Zhao Qichun Xian Zhongfen Shen Chonghui Tan Baoxian Huang Yujia</p>
<p>Reserves: Zhao Yansheng Huang Zhensheng</p>
<h3>The Lineup of the Central China Team</h3>
<p>Lu Xuehai Li Pizu Cheng Guoyin Wang Yide Tang Shunhua Yu Keding Yuan Qingwu Zhao Lanquan Zhou Qingxuan Wu Shirong Xiao Bo</p>
<p>Reserves: Li Benxin Jin Huajin</p>
<h3>Liaoning Athlete Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Changying, a Liaoning defender of the North China team and a student at Northeastern University, arrived late last night around 11 PM by Pingpu train. He is also staying at the Jiande Savings Association and will be a great boost to the North China team. However, Tan Fuzhen of Fengyong University was unable to leave due to his school's refusal to grant leave. North China suddenly felt panicked about the lack of central players. It was decided last night to temporarily promote Zhang Guowei. However, if he is not competent, temporary changes will be made. There are a total of four central players in North China: Sun Sijing, Huang Zhongfu (injured foot), He Xiancheng, and Tan Fuzhen, all of whom are unable to come to Shanghai, which is very unfortunate for the North China team.</p>
<h3>The Athletes of the Central China Team</h3>
<p>The Central China team has been very unfamiliar in the past, and few know its composition. The team members who came this time are even more modest, admitting that their strength is not as good as others. In fact, there are many strong players who should not be underestimated. Here are a few to introduce. Center forward Yuan Qingwu is a student at the Wuhan University of Political Science and Law. He originally played as the right inside winger, but replaced center forward Luo Jie due to a foot injury. He is agile, commands advances and retreats, and is good at attacking and shooting. He is a fierce tiger for the Central China team's forward line. Left winger Wang Yide is a forward for the Hankou Municipal Government team and is also a top player. Defender Zhao Lanquan is stable and reliable. Right winger Xiao Bo is also said to be good. In addition, it is most regrettable that there is a Mr. Yang from Wuchang Wenhua University, an outstanding talent as a center forward, who, together with Yuan and Wang, made a perfect match. Mr. Yang was too busy with his studies and returned to Wuchang after going to Jiujiang. It is also very regrettable that Luo Jie's foot injury prevented him from playing. Therefore, North China may not be guaranteed to win.</p>
<h3>Association Replies to Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>The National Sports Advancement Association yesterday, according to the resolution of the delegation meeting the day before, telegraphed Liu Wenhui, the chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, regarding the details of the Shu Ying football team's inability to attend as representatives.</p>
<h3>A Narrative of the History of Zonal Matches</h3>
<p>Recently, figures in the sports world and football fans in Shanghai have been paying close attention to the upcoming National Zonal Football Championship. Athletes from the Central China, North China, and Northeast China zones are sharpening their swords and preparing for battle, anticipating a lively competition on the field. The streets and alleys are abuzz with discussions about it. Amidst the busy season, when beautiful women are trying on new summer dresses, a gentle breeze is blowing, and slender willows are swaying, it is the perfect time for us to admire the physique and skills of these athletes. Moreover, at a time when wars are breaking out, the past circumstances concerning zonal football are likely something that people and fans are eager to know. Therefore, we have collected materials and compiled a systematic narrative as follows:</p>
<p>In the second year of the Xuan统 reign of the late Qing Dynasty, the First National Games were held at the Nanyang Industrial Exposition grounds in Nanjing. In addition to track and field, basketball, and tennis competitions, football teams from various zones also flocked to the event. The participants included five teams from East China, South China, Northwest China, Central China, thereby forming zonal competitions in an informal way. The South China and East China teams qualified for the finals, with South China winning the championship with a score of 1-0.</p>
<p>The Second National Games were held in the third year of the Republic of China at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. The football participants included teams from the East and West regions, with the East region winning the championship.</p>
<p>After that, due to years of domestic warfare, sports and competitions were suspended for many years. It was not until the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, when the Third National Games were held in Wuchang, that zonal football competitions were resumed. Four teams participated that year, representing the East China Zone, the North China Zone, and the universities of Hubei and Wenhua. South China did not participate due to scheduling issues. As a result, East China and Wenhua qualified for the finals, with East China winning the final victory 6-1 and winning the championship.</p>
<p>In May of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, our country held the National Preliminary Tournament at St. John's University in Shanghai to prepare for the Seventh Far Eastern Games. At the same time, zonal football competitions were also held. However, only the East China and North China teams participated, held at the China Football Field on Observatory Road. A best-of-three format was adopted. In the first match, East China won 2-1; in the second match, North China won 2-0; and in the third match, East China won 4-3. Mr. Xue Yansheng of the city awarded a silver cup.</p>
<p>In addition, when the South China football team passed through Shanghai on its way to the Far Eastern Games, it also held friendly matches. Combining the above-mentioned events, whether they were held within the scope of the National Games or in connection with participation in the Far Eastern Games, they cannot be regarded as true National Zonal Championship matches. They are mentioned incidentally to provide insight into the state of football in our country in the past.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the thirteenth year, the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association was established. Recognizing the disorganization of sports in our country, it sought to revitalize and connect them. It then initiated the National Zonal Football Tournament, which was held in the spring of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China at the Shanghai Baseball Field. This marked a new era for formal zonal competitions. The South China and East China teams were the first to participate. North China was unable to attend due to the political situation, and Central China did not arrive on time. Therefore, the Southeast teams competed, adopting a best-of-three format. As a result, South China won twice in a row with scores of 8-2 and 5-1, winning the first National Football Championship. The rosters of the two teams are recorded below: (1) South China Team: Goalkeeper Lu Chuxiang, defenders Li Yuda and Wu Jinquan, center Huang Ruihua, defenders Du Yuying and Liang Yutang, center forward Huang Baisong, inside forwards Sun Jinshun and Liang Rongde, outside wingers Guangyao and Peng Jinrong, substitutes Liu Jiuyi, Zanbang, Wu Bao, Chen Huanxian, team leader Liang Zhuoru; (2) East China Team: Goalkeeper Lu Zhongen, defenders Ha Yuanzhen and Feng Yunyou, center Liang Guansong, defenders Chen Pu and Mao Zhiheng, center forward Bian Fengnian, inside forwards Li Huitang and Xu Le, wingers Chen Jinjiang and Ding Renbiankui.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the East China and South China teams continued to hold the Second Zonal Match. The East China team was summoned south and departed for Hong Kong at the same time as the Shanghai Port Team. After a fierce battle, the championship still went to South China. That year, South China was jointly represented by the South China and China associations, and the late Mr. Li Xishen, Chairman of the South China Athletic Association, personally donated a large silver cup with ten small silver shields hanging below, to be awarded as a championship trophy for the next ten years, with the name of each year's winner engraved on it as a permanent memento.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Third Tournament was held in Shanghai. The South China Zone was fully represented by the China Association, while North China managed to gather athletes with some difficulty and came south to join. Thus, the zonal tournament gradually showed signs of progress. In the three-way competition, East China first defeated South China 4-2, South China then defeated North China 9-1, and East China defeated North China 4-2. The championship was then won by East China, setting a precedent. The rosters of the three teams are as follows: (1) East China: Goalkeeper Lu Zhongen, defenders Feng Yunyou and Li Shouhua, center Liang Guansong, midfielders Chen Zhenhe and Zhu Qiu, forwards Xi Qiaosheng, Li Ningzhao, Chen Jiaqiu, Wu Yanzhang, Li Huitang, and Chen Jinjiang; (2) South China: Goalkeeper Yi Zanbang, defenders Wu Jinquan and Li Yuda, center Huang Ruihua, midfielders Liang Yutang and Lin Yuying, forwards Cao Guicheng, Li Huiguan, Liu Maosun, Jinshun and Chen Guangyao; (3) North China: Goalkeeper Nie Fuchen, defenders Gao Liangchen and Wang Changying, center Sun Sijing, midfielders Sun Guangchen and Du Qingxiang, forwards Bian Songnian, Chen Jiaju, Yu Jingchun, Du Yongwen, and Wang Yongzhu.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the zonal competition was held in North China at the request of the six zones. However, the South China team was unable to participate due to acclimatization issues. The Northeast teams competed for the championship, adopting a best-of-three format, held in Beijing and Tianjin respectively, to promote the attention of the northern masses and awaken interest in the football community. This was a good strategy for promotion. As a result, East China won twice in a row with scores of 3-0 and 1-0, retaining the championship. The rosters of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) East China: Goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan, defenders Feng Yunyou and Li Ning, center Liang Guansong, midfielders An Yuansheng and Chen Zhenhe, forwards Xi Qiaosheng, Chen Yutian, Zhang Xien, Chen Jiaqiu, Li Huitang, Chen Bingxiang, and Fu He; (2) North China: Goalkeeper Nie Fuchen and Huang Zhenzhu, defenders Xiao Difei, Wang Changying, and Du Yongwen, center Sun Sijing and Huang Zhongfu, midfielders Sun Guangchen and Ren Dui, forwards Zhou Zhaoyuan, Chen Jinjiang, Yin Shangping, Yu Jingchun, Cui Zhiyi, Bian Fengnian, Pan Zuoxin, Wang Yongjie, and Sun Zhilin.</p>
<p>In the spring of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, it was held again in Hong Kong. The North China team was unable to participate due to the long distance. In the first match between the South China and East China teams, East China scored two goals first, but South China tied the score at two each, and the match ended in a draw. Another decisive match was played, which first ended in a 3-3 draw. In extra time, each team scored one goal, resulting in a 4-4 draw. Therefore, a third final match was held, with a record-breaking 17,000 spectators. As a result, South China won 4-1. East China had excellent opportunities in the previous two matches, but failed to win and lost in the end, which was a pity.</p>
<p>This year (the tenth year of the Republic of China) is the sixth tournament, with the participation of the East China, North China, and Central China teams. The Central China team is participating for the first time, which is proof of the development of zonal football and the rise of the sports community in Central China. It is a pity that South China was unable to come to Shanghai. The outcome of the triangular confrontation will be analyzed later.</p>

<h3>Improving the National Education Plan</h3>
<p>The Central Government is Carefully Reviewing It</p>
<p>To be Implemented After the Summer Vacation This Year</p>
<p>The plan for improving and implementing national education, previously drafted by the Ministry of Education, is scheduled to be implemented starting this year, with an estimated completion in twenty years. This plan has been submitted to the Central Government for review and has been studied once by the Central Political Council on education. Because the plan is slightly inconsistent with the domestic social situation, it must be thoroughly reviewed and revised before it can be considered complete. The group is now collecting relevant materials from various sources for review and reference, and plans to implement it after the summer vacation this year.</p>
<h3>Preserving Scenic Spots and Historical Sites</h3>
<p>Local Governments Should First Designate Scenic Spots and Historical Sites for Protection</p>
<p>Designated Funds and the Establishment of a Committee to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>—Notification from the Executive Yuan for Compliance—</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that due to social unrest and the gradual weakening of the people's economy, scenic spots and historical sites in our country are not being adequately protected and are gradually deteriorating. This not only causes concern for the decline of national culture but also reduces opportunities for tourism, and the development of noble recreational habits among the public is also losing significant support. Therefore, at the National Internal Affairs Conference, it was proposed that scenic spots and historical sites in various places should be sorted out and protected by the respective provinces, cities, and counties. The conference passed a resolution, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is now known that the Executive Yuan issued an order yesterday approving the proposal and distributed it to the provinces for compliance. The main points of the measures are summarized as follows: (1) Local governments shall determine the scenic spots and historical sites within their jurisdiction that should be sorted out and protected; (2) Local governments shall designate special funds for sorting out and protecting them; (3) Local governments shall establish committees to manage them.</p>

<h3>Xu Yanzhi Sent to Study in England</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Yanzhi, styled Zijun, is from Yuncheng County, Shandong Province, and is 33 years old. He has now been approved by the Shandong Provincial Government and the Ministry of Education to be sent abroad to study in England for the second time, specializing in finance and currency. Mr. Xu graduated from National Peking University. Before the May Fourth Movement, he co-founded the New Tide magazine with Fu Sinian, Luo Jialun, and others. He was one of the most active members of the May Fourth Movement. After graduating, he passed the public expense examination and went abroad to study at the London School of Economics and Political Science, researching political philosophy for two years. At that time, he was highly respected by his classmates. During the domestic political upheaval when public funds were cut off, he once organized students at the British Embassy to form a public expense student relief committee to manage public expense study affairs. Later, due to certain events, he returned to China and traveled extensively in various provinces of North China, giving lectures everywhere. He was resented by Zhang Zongchang, who revoked his qualification for overseas study, so he could not return to England. He then lived in the countryside, living the life of a complete farmer for two years. Recently, he went to Jinan to teach. Now that he has been sent abroad for the second time, Mr. Xu, having experienced a long period of life among the people, will surely have special insights and be able to meet the needs of the people's livelihood and make great contributions in the future.</p>

<h3>Business Community Met Yesterday to Discuss National Assembly Proposals</h3>
<p>Established a Business Community National Assembly Proposal Review Committee</p>
<p>Due to the importance of the National Assembly, trade associations in the city convened a meeting yesterday to discuss proposals that the business community should submit to the National Assembly. Representatives from over sixty trade associations, numbering over eighty people, attended. Luo Qinghua and Zheng Dengqing were publicly elected as chairmen, and Sun Mingqi served as secretary. After performing the formalities, the chairman first reported, stating that: "Representatives, the reason we have invited you to this meeting today is to discuss the issue of proposals for the National Assembly. In the past, Chinese merchants, under the motto of 'business is business,' paid no attention to world affairs, let alone the affairs of our own country. But now, in the tide of the national revolution and under the invasion of international capitalism, merchants who remain unaware will inevitably be eliminated or left behind. Therefore, we must pay attention to national affairs even if we do not want to directly participate in them. Since the Fourth Plenary Session decided to convene the National Assembly on May 5th, all sectors have been energized, except for the merchants, who remain silent. If we are willing to be left behind by the times and willingly submit to the economic domination of capital, then so be it. Otherwise, we must have our say and express our views on the National Assembly, which is crucial to the future of China. The greatest significance of convening you to this meeting today lies in this. What is the National Assembly? In his will, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, 'Recently, I have advocated convening a National Assembly and abolishing unequal treaties.' The Northern Expedition Declaration also stated, 'Regarding the current situation, we advocate convening a National Assembly, the purpose of which is to plan for the unification and reconstruction of China.' Therefore, the National Assembly is convened based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. It is a major gathering of the government and the people to jointly plan for peaceful unification. It is the only key to resolving the life-and-death crisis of the Chinese nation and achieving lasting freedom from war. We must understand that the decline of Chinese industry and commerce and the backwardness of the industry are due to the aggression of international capitalism, which is certainly one reason. But the endless domestic wars, traffic obstruction, and transportation difficulties are the fatal wounds that hinder the circulation of goods and promote the failure of Chinese industry and commerce. Now that military pacification has begun and political tutelage has commenced, the central government, with a spirit of renewal, is convening the National Assembly based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to seek permanent peace and unification and to prevent war from recurring. This is of course of great importance to the future of industry and commerce. I dare say that as long as there are no more wars in China and bandits are eliminated, industry and commerce will flourish and the industry will advance after ten years. Therefore, the National Assembly, simply put, is the key to the prosperity and decline of Chinese industry and commerce and is the ladder for China to reach the highway from thorns. The central government is also well aware of the importance of the National Assembly for the development of industry and commerce, so it stipulates that the Chamber of Commerce is one of the representative groups, so that there is an opportunity to present the views of the business community, because only merchants themselves know their own pain. Since we have such a good opportunity, we should not lightly let it go. All of you are leading figures in the business community and must have good opinions to express. I hope you will express them as much as possible so that everyone can discuss them and submit them to the elected merchant representatives for proposals to the National Assembly. In addition, it should be noted that proposals for the National Assembly must not be vague or petty. If a proposal review committee can be established at today's meeting to be solely responsible for this matter, this defect may be remedied. This is a point I am reporting incidentally. As for the detailed measures, please discuss them in detail." After the report, the discussion began. (1) It is proposed that the National Government be ordered to strictly implement tariff protection policies, speed up the implementation of dumping taxes, national product incentive taxes, and find ways to stop foreign merchants from setting up factories in China, in order to maintain the domestic industry. Resolution: Passed. (2) It is proposed that the government be urged to effectively recover all concessions across the country and abolish unequal treaties. Resolution: Passed. (3) All increases in taxes and levies on merchants and the people must be implemented only with the consent of the merchants' representative bodies and the approval of the highest government. Resolution: Passed. (4) All businesses in the same industry with fewer than seven members must join the Chamber of Commerce. When there are seven or more members, they must organize a trade association. All businesses in the same industry must join legally organized trade associations. The income from expenses shall be based on the capital or operating income of the affiliated trade shops and shall be incorporated into the law. Resolution: Passed. Zheng Dengqing proposed the establishment of a proposal review committee. (1) The name is the Shanghai Merchants and People's Assembly Proposal Review Committee. (2) The number of members is nine. Ma Shaoquan, Shen Jinting, Jiang Zhigang, Ye Jiaxing, Zheng Dengqing, Sun Choucheng, Chen Songyuan, Zhu Wenqi, and Lu Fengzhu were elected as review committee members. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Hosted Osaka Inspection Group Yesterday</h3>
<p>Economic Cooperation Built on a Foundation of Equality and Reciprocity</p>
<p>A Nation That Can Abandon Privileges Is a Good Friend to China</p>
<p>The industrial and commercial inspection group organized by the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry arrived in Shanghai the afternoon before yesterday in Fujian. Yesterday morning, they toured the city, visited the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at 1 p.m., the Shanghai Municipal Government at 2:30 p.m., the Zhentai Cotton Weaving Factory at 3 p.m., and the Shenxin Yarn Factory at 4:30 p.m. At 6:30 p.m. in the evening, the City Chamber of Commerce held a banquet to welcome them. More than 50 Chinese and Japanese guests attended. During the banquet, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, which briefly stated that Osaka is the industrial center of your country, and the members of the inspection group are representatives of the entire industrial and commercial sector of Osaka. You are also scheduled to inspect various places, focusing on Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Hangzhou, all of which are densely populated and commercially prosperous areas of our country. It is expected that the results of your inspection will definitely increase Osaka's commercial gains in China. At a time when the global market is sluggish, even the United States, which is known as an advanced industrial and commercial country, has recently had as many as six million unemployed workers, according to newspaper reports. Therefore, solving the problem of surplus industrial products is the most important issue in the world. Your country is also feeling this impact at the same time, which is also an indirect motivation for your country to come to China for inspection. Our association once recalled that there is a popular term among the government and the public in your country, which is "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation." These few words can actually serve as a guide for your group's visit to China. Originally, economics has no national boundaries. The current sluggishness of the global market is partly due to the strict barriers and clear divisions between countries after the war. Therefore, to seek thorough relief, we should start with global economic cooperation. Moreover, China and Japan are only separated by a narrow strip of water and are as interdependent as lips and teeth. The close relationship is different from distant neighbors, and it goes without saying that the four words of economic cooperation should be put into practice. However, after examining the actual implementation of cooperation over the years, we cannot help but be disappointed. The most important tool for economic cooperation is the commercial treaty. The commercial treaty between our two countries expired long ago, and the renewal of the treaty has been going on for a long time without any progress. With the old treaty expired and the new treaty not yet signed, trade between the two countries is in a state of having no treaty. Without such protection, how can the commerce of the two countries develop equally? To cite the most obvious example, immigrants from your country to our country, regardless of whether they are merchants or workers, with or without a job, can enter arbitrarily without any restrictions. However, when our people travel to your country, the police can set up many rules and regulations and arbitrarily prohibit them from landing. The difficulties and delays are almost the same as the American immigration law, which your country regrets. If a new treaty is not signed, our people will not be able to freely immigrate to your country, let alone make commercial progress. The so-called economic cooperation will only become a synonym for economic monopoly. Looking back at why a new commercial treaty between our two countries has not been concluded, half of the reason is that your country adheres to its traditional thinking, believing that the content of the commercial treaty is complicated, including tax rights, legal rights, navigation rights, land lease rights, and various other issues. Once a new treaty is renegotiated based on the spirit of equality and reciprocity, the above four types of rights will inevitably change. Therefore, taking the issue of tariffs as an example, your country abandoned its right to agreement after much delay. It was the last among all countries to make a decision. Moreover, in terms of calculating the amount of reciprocal goods, what your country has granted to China is far less than what China has granted to your country, regardless of the ratio of twenty to one. All of this is inconsistent with the theory of economic cooperation that has always been advocated. As for the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction, which your country itself once regarded as something that had to be endured before it could be shaken off, it has not yet taken the lead in advocating a clear commitment to our country's proposals. Regarding the issue of concessions, it seems that the return of the Japanese concession in Hankou is still on hold. Compared with the United Kingdom's automatic abandonment of its concessions in Hankou, Jiujiang, and Zhenjiang, it is inevitably dwarfed, causing us to change our expectations for countries on the same continent. In summary, the obstacles in the new commercial treaty are all caused by the firm desire to uphold its privileges. The opinions of the government and the public in your country must be that these privileges are what have created today's commercial position in China. Once all privileges are abandoned, the commercial position in China will immediately be shaken. Therefore, it is better to hesitate and look around. In fact, this kind of mentality still stems from a failure to thoroughly understand the true meaning of economic cooperation, mistakenly believing that economic development must rely on political authority, not knowing that the prosperity of commerce between the two countries has its own proper path to follow. The various privileges mentioned above are currently only maintained by your country for China. For other countries, either these privileges have never been abolished, or they have been revised long ago due to changes in the times. However, your country's foreign trade is still making significant progress year by year and has not been hindered in any way as a result. Therefore, your country's firm desire to uphold its privileges in China and hinder the establishment of a new commercial treaty, believing that it is a guarantee for commerce in China, is not necessary in fact and is even an obstacle to economic cooperation. Now, countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Czechoslovakia either do not have privileges in China or have abandoned or will abandon their privileges. The people of our country believe that economic cooperation must be built on a foundation of equality and reciprocity. Therefore, a nation that can abandon privileges is a good friend to China. This attitude has long been announced to all friendly nations. However, because this matter concerns the century-long plan of our two countries, we are deeply afraid that the government and the public in your country may not fully understand this intention. Taking advantage of the opportunity to gather together and have a pleasant conversation, we will present our humble opinions in detail again as an aid to implementing economic cooperation. As for the wording, there may be some straightforwardness, which is because the two countries are on the same continent and share the same culture, and the relationship is extraordinary. If we are afraid of suspicion and do not speak out, it will be contrary to the meaning of friendship. Therefore, we have opened our hearts and have not concealed anything. We sincerely hope that your group will understand and accept it with an open mind. Thank you very much. Afterwards, the head of the delegation, Mr. Kurimoto, delivered a reply, and other guests also gave speeches. The banquet did not end until 11 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Toyoura Maru Collides with Jiangyu</h3>
<p>Japanese Ship Flees After Causing the Accident</p>
<p>Passengers and Cargo Have Been Transferred to Lighters in Shanghai</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese ships colliding with ships in our country and causing accidents has occurred from time to time. Disasters such as the Xinkang and Xinda Ming have been seen countless times, and negotiations have not yielded any results. Unexpectedly, another incident of a Japanese postal company ship colliding with our Yangtze River ship has occurred. After the accident, the Japanese ship secretly fled. The cause of this matter is recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>Jiangyu Launched The Jiangyu ship of the China Merchants Bureau Yangtze River Shipping Company experienced a strike due to the transfer of the head of the sailors. After the issue was resolved, it set sail for Hankou. On the evening of the fifth, the ship transported passengers and a large amount of downriver cargo from Hankou back to Shanghai. The journey was fairly smooth. At 2 a.m. on the sixth, it arrived at Anqing. The ship was heading downriver when it was unexpectedly hit by a Japanese ship. The ship's body was severely damaged and could not even sail.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Causes the Accident The Japanese Postal Company's Inland Sea Department dispatches eleven ships on the Yangtze River in our country, traveling back and forth between Hankou, Daye, and Japan's Yawata. This time, the company's Toyoura Maru ship was carrying goods from Japan to China and heading straight for the Yangtze River. At 2 a.m. on the sixth, it was late at night. The China Merchants Bureau's Jiangyu ship was about fifty li downriver from Anqing, near a place called Jianglong Reef. The Japanese ship Toyoura Maru was sailing head-on. It did not follow the navigation route and rammed straight ahead. The captain of the Jiangyu ship was shocked and sounded the horn to signal the Japanese ship to give way. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ship ignored it and continued to advance rapidly. The Jiangyu ship quickly moved to the side to avoid it, but the bow of the Japanese ship had already crashed into the stern of the Jiangyu.</p>
<p>Damage Situation The Toyoura Maru is an ocean-going ship with a large cargo capacity. The Jiangyu ship is smaller. It was unable to avoid the collision and was hit in the stern. The paddlewheel was knocked off, and the steering gear was also destroyed. If the Jiangyu had not retreated quickly, it would have been hit in the middle of the ship, and there would have been no chance of survival. After the collision, the paddlewheel and rudder of the Jiangyu were destroyed, and the ship could not move. The passengers and crew on board were greatly frightened. Fortunately, the ship's hull had not been breached, and the people's hearts were at peace. The captain dropped anchor and called for help.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Flees The Japanese ship Toyoura Maru knew it was at fault and should take full responsibility after causing the accident. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ship disregarded morality and not only did not provide assistance to the Jiangyu but also took advantage of the fact that no one knew about it in the middle of the night to turn around and leave, heading upstream. Fearing that the Jiangyu would release a boat to chase after it, the Japanese ship opened full throttle and fled upstream.</p>
<p>Rescue Situation After the Jiangyu's accident, it reported to Shanghai and requested rescue. Yesterday, the Shanghai office sent an urgent telegram ordering the Anqing branch to quickly dispatch lighters and small boats to Jianglong Reef to transfer the passengers and cargo inside the ship. Then, it was handed over to the downriver ships to tow it back to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. As the Jiangyu ship cannot be sailed and there is concern about bandits, Li Zhonggong sent a telegram to the Anhui authorities yesterday requesting them to send troops to the area to protect the ship.</p>
<p>Negotiations and Compensation Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau sent a letter to the Japanese Postal Company's Inland Sea Department based on the Jiangyu ship's telegram, demanding compensation for all losses caused by the Toyoura Maru's collision with the Jiangyu. At the same time, the bureau sent an engineer to Anhui to inspect the damage to the Jiangyu in order to prepare a list to claim damages from the Japanese Postal Company.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Invade Jiangsu and Zhejiang Waters</h3>
<p>Ningbo Fish Market Experiences Panic in Recent Days</p>
<p>All Sectors Telegraph Chairman Chiang to Find Ways to Provide Relief</p>
<p>Zhuang Songfu's Telegram Zhuang Songfu, a legislative member and deputy director of the Huai River Commission, passed through Shanghai yesterday to return to his hometown of Fenghua. Seeing that our country's fishing industry was being invaded by Japanese fishing boats, causing panic, he urgently telegraphed Chairman Chiang of the National Government, requesting ways to provide relief. The original text is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, Jun Jian, Songfu recently returned to my hometown, the Fenghua fish market, which caused panic. Japanese fishing boats have invaded the waters under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, including Yushan and Langgang reefs. The huge ships and large nets are exhausting the fishing resources, so our country's fishermen have greatly reduced their income since winter, while Japanese fishing boats are returning fully loaded. Moreover, the Japanese are using internal traitors in our country to pretend to be Chinese fishing boats, hanging our national flag and changing the names of the ships. When they are selling the fish, they use Chinese people on board to come forward, and the fishmongers in Shanghai are eager to sign contracts with them and promote sales widely. Such aggression not only leads to the loss of maritime rights, but also cuts off the livelihood of fishermen. The Yushan and Langgang reefs are the most abundant fishing areas in our country's eastern ports. The period between Qingming and the Beginning of Summer is especially the peak season for fish. Fishing boats from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian gather here, with thousands of ships fishing, and the output income is no less than 20 million. It is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In recent years, our country's fishing industry has been extremely declining. Now that it is being trampled on by Japanese fishing boats, if no effort is made to save it, millions of fishermen will be left to die. For the sake of the people's livelihood and the country, Songfu has to telegraph you to sustain the livelihood of the fishermen during the current peak fishing season, hoping that you will immediately dispatch many warships to the area to protect the livelihood of the fishermen, so as to preserve our territorial sovereignty. It will be a great fortune for the country and the fishermen. This telegram may not be detailed enough, so I am sending another telegram to inform you. Zhuang Songfu bows." In addition to telegraphing Chairman Chiang, Zhuang also telegraphed the National Government, the Ministry of Industry, and the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, requesting them to pay attention to protecting fishermen, so as to maintain the fishing industry and expand national rights.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fishermen's Telegram The National News Agency reported that Japanese fishing boats fishing across borders have suddenly increased to more than 200 this year. Hundreds of thousands of oppressed fishermen along the coast are asking the Zhejiang Shenjiamen Fish Stall Association and the Fish Industry Association to find ways to provide relief. Yesterday, the association and others jointly submitted a petition to the National Government, urging them to send warships to protect them, and to the Central Standing Committee, urging them to implement it. Now, the text of their petition to the National Government is recorded as follows: "We petition that Japanese fishing boats are fishing across borders with increasing intensity, and the people cannot bear it. We request serious negotiations to stop it, so as to protect the fixed fishing area and maintain the livelihood of the fishermen. Imperialist Japanese are manufacturing the latest fishing machines and coming to China in groups to fish across borders. At first, they used Taiwan and Hong Kong as their bases to invade our coastal fishing industry in the south. Then, they used Qingdao and Yantai as their bases to invade our coastal fishing industry in the north. Now, they are intensifying their efforts and going deep into the hinterland, using Shanghai as their sales market, rampaging in the waters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, implementing the invasion of our coastal fishing industry in the central region and cutting off the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of our fishermen. All sectors of the fishing industry have repeatedly requested the authorities to use diplomatic means to negotiate and stop it, and have also sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct fish merchants not to buy Japanese fish. Recently, the waters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have reached the first fishing season, and most of the sailboat fishermen have been devastated and trampled on. Recently, those who have requested assistance have come one after another, hanging their heads and dejected, in a very pitiful state. It has been learned that Japanese fishing boats used to be no more than thirty, but this year they have suddenly increased to more than 200, hanging our national flag and hiring our river leaders, rampaging in Shengshan, Haijiao, Sheshan, Yushan, Yang'an, and Jiangjun, extremely arrogant, tearing up our fishing gear and making a mockery of our lives. As a result, they return fully loaded, while we gain nothing. Shenjiamen is the second largest fishing ground in China, and Shengshan and Sheshan have been fixed fishing areas. If foreign ships are allowed to rampage at will for a long time, not only will all the adult fish be caught, but also the seeds of each type of fish will gradually become extinct. Fishermen are helpless, and fishing grounds go bankrupt. The entire economic invasion policy of those imperialists on the fishing industry has been completely successful due to the lack of resistance. The association and others have observed that Japanese fishing boats still do not dare to be blatant, but they take advantage of the lack of protection and the ignorance of the foolish people, so they can deceive them and display their deceitful tricks. The fact that they are falsely hanging our national flag proves this beyond any doubt. If the government authorities can provide effective protection, dispatch more warships, and patrol the waters, the other party will know that there is a guard and will surely flee and hide. Furthermore, Shengshan, Haijiao, Sheshan, Yang'an, Jiangjunmao, and Yushan have long been designated as national fishing areas, where the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of fishermen depend. We propose that within the longitude and latitude lines of the above-mentioned mountains and waters, it should be clearly prohibited for any fishing boats to enter and fish, which can both cultivate the growth of fish and prevent the evils of foreign boats. The second fishing season is approaching in an instant, and the timing is urgent. The consequences are unbearable. We are compelled to appeal beyond our authority, imploring your government to inherit the teachings of the Premier, to seek liberation for the fishermen, to overthrow imperialism, to strictly prevent economic aggression, and to dispatch more warships in the shortest possible time to patrol and protect, while at the same time issuing a clear order to permanently prohibit any fishing boats from fishing in the waters of Shengshan, Sheshan, Jiangjunmao, Yang'an, and Yushan. We await your orders with utmost anxiety and urgency. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Chiang of the National Government, Jun Jian."</p>
<h3>Beijing-Ping Aircraft to Fly on Schedule</h3>
<p>Tianjin Aircraft Left Shanghai This Morning for the North</p>
<p>The Beijing-Ping Air Route of China Aviation Corporation will officially start flying from Beijing on the morning of the 15th of this month. The arrangement of stations along the route is gradually being completed. Currently, only the installation of radio equipment at the Dongjuzi Airport in Tianjin is still under discussion. The news obtained yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sending Aircraft to Beiping The Beijing-Ping Aviation has decided that Beijing and Beiping will begin flying simultaneously on the morning of the 15th. The Xuzhou, Jinan, Tianjin, and Beiping aircraft will take turns flying once each morning. The flights will be suspended one day each week on Mondays. The Xuzhou, Beiping, and Jinan aircraft are currently stationed at the Beijing station. The Tianjin aircraft is still in Shanghai. At 9:00 this morning, the head of the aircraft team, Nie Kaiyi, etc., took the aircraft to the north. At 10:30, it arrived in Beijing. Because Mr. Nie had other important business to discuss with Wang, the Minister of Transportation, at the Ministry of Transportation, he stayed in Beijing for one day. On the morning of the 9th, it will fly from Beijing to Beiping. The aircraft will stop at the Tianjin station for one day and then fly to Beiping. The aircraft will then be stationed in Beiping. When the official flights begin, the pilots of each aircraft will be led by six Chinese pilots, including Nie Kaiyi. It is reported that the Chinese pilots have rich experience and training in flight and have been performing flight duties for many years.</p>
<p>Current Status of the Stations The stations along the Beijing-Ping route include Xuzhou, Jinan, Beijing, and Ping. In recent months, the stations along the route have been busy setting up airport buildings, workshops, and radio equipment. The Beijing, Xuzhou, and Ping stations have been completed. The workshops and other buildings at the Jinan station will also be completed soon. The radio equipment will be installed in a few days. At the Tianjin station, the installation of radio equipment has been obstructed by the French police, and there is still a problem. The Tianjin station is located at the Dongjuzi grassland, adjacent to the French military camp. The station is not located in the concession, but the French police fired warning shots, which is truly incomprehensible. The company is currently preparing to negotiate and send personnel north to contact the Tianjin Municipal Government and the Party headquarters to discuss the matter. The Post Office Issues Orders The Shanghai Postal Administration and China Aviation Corporation have signed a contract for the Beijing-Ping air mail transportation. The two parties have already signed the contract. The administration believes that the Beijing-Ping flight date is approaching, so today (the 8th) it has issued orders to the post offices along the Beijing-Ping route, preparing to handle air mail, receive and send mail, packages, and inform them of the Beijing-Ping flight departure times and mail fee standards.</p>
<p>Flights to Start on Schedule The Beijing-Ping Aviation has decided to start flights on the 15th and will not postpone them again. Initially, it will carry mail. Passenger flights will continue two months later. Although there are problems with the installation of radio equipment at the Tianjin station, which are still under discussion, it will not affect the company's route. The company has decided to start Beijing-Ping flights on schedule.</p>
<h3>Eurasia's Fourth Aircraft Flew to Beijing This Morning</h3>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation's fourth aircraft flew to the capital at 9:15 this morning. Those traveling north with the aircraft included Liang Mutang, an engineer of the company, He En, the chief engineer of the German Lufthansa Company, and a German pilot. After inspecting the Beijing airport, Liang and He instructed workers to build aircraft hangars. They will stay at the Beijing station for about two days and then take the original aircraft to Jinan for inspection and to arrange the airport. If there are no major delays in Jinan, they will fly to the Beiping and Duolun stations. Currently, Eurasia's first, second, and third aircraft are all at the Nanyuan Airport in Beiping. Li Jingcong and others are currently in Beiping, directing the airport affairs. They will be able to return to Beijing in two or three days to report to the Ministry of Transportation on the details of the test flights and to negotiate the Manchuria Airport and other matters.</p>
<h3>Progress of Preparations for Zhongshan Hospital</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Fundraising from All Sectors</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital Preparatory Committee organized the fundraising teams and began collecting donations, the teams have been progressing very smoothly. According to the original plan, it is proposed to set up 300 beds, with separate rooms for men, women, and children in each department. It is planned to have 200 beds for ordinary people, including free beds, based on the amount of donations. The hospital's purpose is to serve the general working-class patients, so that all poor and sick people have equal opportunities for treatment. The hospital's design and architecture are purely oriental in appearance, while the interior is equipped with the latest hospital facilities, striving for both spectacular appearance and practicality. There are a total of sixteen courtyards, and the largest four have already been donated. Among them, six wards have been donated, and two have already been donated. One of them was donated by a major philanthropist and designated as a psychiatric hospital. Because there are no specialized psychiatric hospitals in Shanghai, this is a ship of mercy in the sea of suffering for the sake of relief.</p>
<p>In terms of donations, Shanghai is divided into 48 teams, and there are still many teams willing to join the fundraising effort, which is very enthusiastic. The amount of donations, it is reported that the Stock Exchange Federation has committed 10,000 yuan, and the teams in other provinces are also actively working. Vice Commander Zhang of Liaoning has donated 10,000 taels, and Chairman He Xuezhu of Hubei and Mayor Liu Wendao have expressed their approval and promised to vigorously promote it. The authorities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hunan provinces have also agreed to raise funds. The local officials' concern for the people's suffering is encouraging for the fundraising prospects.</p>
<h3>Li Shizeng and Others Hosted a Banquet for All Sectors Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Please Raise Funds for the Construction of the Central Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Members of the Central Committee Li Shizeng, Kong Xiangxi, and Zhang Yuejun hosted a banquet at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club yesterday afternoon to raise funds for the construction of the Central Party Headquarters, inviting leaders from the business and financial sectors of the city, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and Yu Qiaqing, and more than 20 others. Li Yuying chaired the meeting, and Li started by stating the purpose of the banquet, saying that the construction of the Central Party Headquarters will begin soon, and asked all sectors of Shanghai to contribute enthusiastically. Wang Xiaolai then delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, promising to do their best to raise funds. The chairman asked Shanghai to raise 300,000 yuan, and as a result, half of the amount, 150,000 yuan, was pledged. The fundraising method will be mainly led by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, which will send letters to the various trade associations next week to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Zou Zuohua, Director of the Xing'an Reclamation, to Set Sail Soon</h3>
<p>Talking About the Purpose of Visiting Europe and America</p>
<p>Zou Yuelou, the director of the Xing'an District Reclamation in Heilongjiang, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago from Beijing. The reporter met with him at his hotel yesterday. Zou said that the Xing'an District is located on the border between China and Russia, with a sparse population and rich treasures. Since the establishment of the Reclamation Office, it has begun to handle transportation and defense, and initial progress has been made. After that, it will focus on the reclamation effort. However, this matter cannot be accomplished solely based on ideals, so he plans to first visit Europe and America for inspiration. He plans to leave in about ten days and will stay for about a year. He will stay in Canada and Soviet Russia for a slightly longer time, as these two places are agricultural powers. Dr. Xu Kechang, the secretary of the Northeast Border Affairs Office, is traveling with Zou. Zou is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy and has held important positions in the Northeast Army, including commander of the artillery. He is proficient in Japanese, Russian, and English. He has now given up military power to engage in reclamation, which can serve as an example for soldiers across the country. He was invited by Chairman Chiang and passed through the capital, where they had a cordial conversation. It is said that Zou's trip to Hangzhou has been cancelled, and he must set sail on the 15th.</p>
<h3>The News of Chiang Tso-ping's Departure from Germany</h3>

It is reported that all sectors in Germany, upon hearing the news of Chiang's return to China, successively held banquets to bid him farewell. Chiang's return to China is said to be for a vacation, so our country's embassy in Germany has not issued a notice. However, before his return, the foreign ministries of various European countries, the embassies of various countries stationed in Germany, and German industrial groups all sent telegrams to bid him farewell. On March 15, after all the procedures were completed, Chiang boarded a train at the Berlin Sheranzi Station to leave Germany.

<h3>Fourth Day of the Fisheries Improvement Promotion Conference</h3>

The number of visitors was still very crowded, and more than 1,800 people won gifts. The news about the conference from all sides is recorded below:</p>
<p>Temporary Meeting of the Conference Affairs Department: Due to the expansion of the exhibition area, the internal staff was insufficient, and printing and other expenses exceeded the budget. A temporary meeting was held in the office yesterday afternoon. Hou Zhaohai, Wu Huanru, Huang Wenfeng, Wang Wentai, Wang Defa, and others attended. Resolutions: (1) The duties of the internal staff were reallocated.

The original text is as follows: "It has been found that the original budget for the publicity work of our conference was 2,100 yuan, which was to be borne equally by the province, the city, and the Fisheries Experiment Station, and we have already applied for allocation. However, the scope of this publicity has been expanded, the exhibits are rich, and the printed materials are also very numerous. Moreover, most of the exhibits are transported from afar, and the journey is long, resulting in high expenses. According to the original budget, it is difficult to meet the expenses. After a comprehensive plan by the Director General of our association at the temporary meeting, the shortfall is nearly 900 yuan. It has been resolved that your department (bureau) should each increase the allocation by 400 yuan, and your station should increase the allocation by 100 yuan to make up for the shortfall. If this is not the case, please reply and allocate as soon as possible. Jiangsu Province Shanghai City Fisheries Improvement Promotion Conference."

<h3>Huang Jiahu's Statement</h3>
<p>Regarding the Slanderous Incident Involving His Wife</p>
<p>Huang Jiahu, Director General of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, recently went to Taiwan with his wife to inspect the situation of the prohibition of opium. During his absence from the country, he was suddenly slandered, saying that his wife, Ms. Bai Zhiying, was found by the Hong Kong Customs to be trafficking morphine. Rumors spread everywhere, and the truth was unclear. Mr. Huang and his wife returned to Shanghai a few days ago. In addition to submitting the course of events, the slanderous process, and the evidence obtained from the other party's slander to the Standing Committee of the Association for review, it was believed that this matter was indeed a slander. After the Association issued a statement to prove that this matter was indeed a slander, which has been published in Chinese and foreign newspapers, Mr. Huang specially issued the following statement yesterday, which is specially published as follows: "This time, my wife and I went to Taiwan to inspect the situation of the prohibition of opium. Suddenly, someone slandered my wife for trafficking morphine and being found by the Hong Kong Customs. In fact, this matter is completely unfounded. We did not go to Hong Kong this time. There is a stamp from the Keelung Police Department on our passports as proof. There are various rumors outside, and there is no way to know what is true. Some say it is about this time, some say it was last year, and some say it was two, three, or four years ago. Little do they know that my wife has never engaged in such illegal business in her life, nor has she ever been found by the Hong Kong Customs to have any illegal items. It is obviously an enemy spreading rumors to destroy my reputation. If this matter is investigated in detail, the truth will be revealed. If the other party can produce evidence of my wife's drug trafficking, and the evidence is indeed not forged or framed, my wife and I are willing to be punished. If they cannot provide solid evidence, then the other party should bear full responsibility. I have been engaged in anti-drug work for many years, offending various parties and making many enemies. I had expected to be slandered, but I did not expect that this time it would involve my wife, which shows the viciousness of the other party's methods. This time, I was almost assassinated by the enemy when passing through Xiamen, but fortunately, Chinese and foreign people provided righteous assistance to escape the danger, so I found out the other party's conspiracy and obtained many pieces of solid evidence. It can be seen that those who plot against me are deliberate, and their purpose is not only limited to my wife and me. I hope that comrades from all parties and people from all walks of life will understand the truth of the facts, and I also hope that the media will uphold justice. I have devoted myself to anti-drug work and sacrificed myself, which is not a pity. However, due to the facts, I cannot remain silent and let the other party reverse right and wrong and confuse black and white, which will affect the reputation of the anti-drug movement. The evidence of the other party's conspiracy and the names of the people involved that I have obtained will be announced to the world when necessary, pending a fair trial by Chinese and foreign people. I hereby declare."</p>
<h3>The Exposed Coffins in Wusong Are Required to Be Buried Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>There are many exposed coffins placed between various righteous cemeteries and open spaces in the towns near Wusong. The Wusong Municipal Committee Office has repeatedly ordered the Public Security 7th District Office and the 7th District 1st Sub-office to bury them, but they have not been complied with. Every summer and autumn, the stench is pungent, making people cover their noses. Tang Chengzong, a member of the Wusong Municipal Committee, believes that these exposed coffins are detrimental to hygiene. Therefore, yesterday, he again met with Zhao, the chief of the 7th district, and Zhang, the chief of the 7th district 1st sub-office, to issue a notice, ordering the people to bury the exposed coffins themselves before the 10th of this month. If they still do not comply after the deadline, they will be handed over to the Jisheng Association to hire workers to recruit and bury them in the suburbs.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Food Dyed with Pigments</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities of this city, in view of the fact that there are some shops and hawkers in the city who often dye children's food with poisonous pigments, which is harmful to children's health, is not a trivial matter. Yesterday, the Public Security and Health Bureaus jointly issued a notice, strictly prohibiting it. The notice said: "For the sake of issuing a notice, it is found that various pigments contain poisonous substances and should not be used to dye food, drink, and toys in children's mouths. Recently, it has been found that there are many shops and hawkers in the city selling colored toys for children's mouths, and there are also many colored drinks and foods, such as colored water in strange-shaped small glass bottles, which are harmful to the health of the citizens and the health of children. In addition to the Public Security Bureau issuing a notice to all districts and offices to investigate and prohibit them, a notice is hereby issued strictly prohibiting them, so that everyone knows, and it must be strictly enforced."</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Prohibits the Placement of Fortune God Lottery Stands</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the First District Party Department of this city sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting the prohibition of placing Fortune God lottery stands at the corners of roads in the Chinese area. Yesterday, Director Chen specially issued Order No. 617, notifying all district offices to investigate and prohibit them uniformly. The document said: "For the sake of compliance, the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City First District Party Department Executive Committee's public letter was approved. According to the report submitted by the subordinate 27th branch, it is submitted for the sake of submitting a request. It is found that the placement of Fortune God lottery stands at the corners of roads has recently spread to the Chinese area, which not only deceives money and fools the people, but also poses a great obstacle to the Party's efforts to break superstitions. If it is not prohibited, I am afraid that there will be no awareness of the future troubles. It is specially submitted to the 38th Party Congress for deliberation and requested that the Municipal Public Security Bureau strictly investigate and prohibit it, etc. It has been heard that the news of the establishment of Fortune God lottery stands in the Chinese area has been heard from time to time, so it is not only related to the scope of righteousness, but also a phenomenon that should not exist during the period of political tutelage. Therefore, we specially send a letter to your bureau, ordering your subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit it absolutely, etc. This order, in addition to being distributed, is hereby ordered to the district chief to comply with and order his subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit it."</p>
<h3>Beef, Mutton, and Pork Prices Increase by 20%</h3>
<p>Resolutions of the Beef and Mutton Industry Association</p>
<p>The Beef and Mutton Association of this port held a temporary meeting the day before yesterday, chaired by Chen Guanghai. The resolutions are as follows: (1) "Increase the price of beef, mutton, and pork by 20%." It is briefly stated that, at present, the price of cattle, sheep, and pigs has increased sharply, resulting in a shortage of cattle. The reason is that it is affected by the rise in prices. However, the cattle, sheep, and pigs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are becoming increasingly scarce in Shanghai, and the prices are increasing day by day. There are several reasons for the lack of cattle. In the northern part of Jiangsu, which is a prosperous area for cattle production, bandits are rampant. Cattle dealers who carry funds to sell cattle are not only robbed of their wealth, but also robbed of pigs and cattle, resulting in cattle dealers being deterred. The source of cattle is almost extinct. Usually, cattle herders are often worried about cattle being robbed because the cattle have already been robbed, so the number of cattle naturally decreases day by day. This is one reason. Shandong Province is also an important area for cattle production, and many colleagues in this port purchase and slaughter them. However, this year, Japanese merchants in Qingdao purchase beef for export, and the number of those who collude with them is increasing day by day, so the cattle in the entire Shandong Province have been searched by Qingdao cattle merchants, and they even come to Jiangsu to purchase cattle. Therefore, Shandong Province has also recently stopped transporting cattle to Jiangsu Province for sale. This is also one of the reasons for the increase in cattle prices. There are currently many unscrupulous merchants in this city, as well as in the Nanyang Islands, who purchase beef in Shanghai and transport it there for sale. The export of beef in this city was originally prohibited, but now there are unscrupulous merchants who pack the purchased beef intended for export in wooden boxes as pork and report it to the customs for inspection. The customs believe that it is pork and that there is no order to load it, so they allow it to be exported continuously, allowing it to be deceived. Butchers specially increase the price to purchase cattle in order to resist the贩运of unscrupulous merchants. This is also one of the reasons for the increase in prices. If foreign ships purchase live cattle and sheep for slaughtering on board, the number is not small. Now, with the unscrupulous merchants purchasing meat products for export, the shortage of cattle is even more difficult to bear. Colleagues are affected by the demand for cattle exceeding supply and the sharp increase in prices, so all sales should be increased according to the current price in order to slightly maintain their capital. It is allowed to implement an increase of 20% according to the加價from the 16th of this month. Chinese and foreign characters have been printed and distributed to inform Chinese and foreign customers. Advertisements have also been placed in Chinese and foreign newspapers so that everyone knows. (1) There are currently unscrupulous merchants in this city who pack beef as pork to骗运for export. We should expose their tricks and urgently ask the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs to order officials to strictly investigate and prohibit transport.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Holds Sixth Doctor Registration in Advance</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau originally scheduled to hold doctor registration once every June. Recently, the French Concession and the Public Concession both wanted to hold doctor registration in their respective locations. The authorities of the two concessions also required that those who have a registration certificate from the Health Bureau can register with the Health Office to open a business, otherwise they will be listed as being cracked down on. Therefore, in recent days, doctors in the two concessions who have not obtained a certificate from the Health Bureau have asked their respective medical groups to request remedial measures. Therefore, the groups forwarded the request to the Health Bureau, asking for a solution. Now, in order to care for all unregistered doctors, the Health Bureau has specially held the sixth registration in advance, scheduled from the 7th of this month to the end of the month, as the registration period. The Shanghai Medical Spring and Autumn Society Chinese Medicine Association and other groups notified all unregistered members after receiving the instructions from the Health Bureau yesterday.</p>

<h3>Tenants of Renshou Lane Oppose Rent Increase</h3>
<p>Renshou Lane on Beikaier Road in Hudong was taken over by the Yuniqian Law Office to collect rent in the past. It is said that the rent has been increased once. Now, the rent of the 核里is collected by the China Business Operation Company. From April this year, the rent will be increased by 30% per building. All the 体tenants in the lane are unable to bear the annual rent increase, and the location is remote and the transportation is inconvenient. The rent currently paid is already much higher than the number in the surrounding lanes, so they unanimously deny it. They sent representatives to contact the collection accounting room of the company, requesting to cancel the rent increase. It is said that the accounting room only allowed to reduce it to 20%. All the tenants in the lane were very angry because the company only knew how to increase revenue and did not care about the difficult livelihood of the tenants, which is obviously contrary to the principle of people's livelihood of the Chinese Kuomintang. They unanimously insisted that a general meeting will be held to issue a declaration and ask the party and government organs and people from all walks of life to uphold public opinion.</p>

<h3>New Dedication of the First District's Second Change of Directors</h3>
<p>Since the resignation of the former director of the Second Sub-office of the First District in Nanshi, Ma Zhenzhong, his successor was Inspector Yi Zunren. Mr. Yi is an advanced revolutionary. He assisted the Party affairs in the Municipal Party Department before. Later, because former Director Yuan was not a member of the Kuomintang, he specially extended an invitation to Mr. Yi to the bureau to facilitate consultation. This time, former Director Ma resigned. Director Chen, in view of the fact that the jurisdiction of the office is connected to the concession, and the responsibility is heavy, must have capable talents to fulfill their responsibilities. After repeated consideration, Mr. Yi is the only one. Mr. Yi took office on the 1st of this month. At the beginning of his tenure, he first rectified the traffic in the area of Minguo Road. Every day, he changed into plain clothes and went to the Yimiao area to inspect. The Yimiao area is crowded with vendors, and there are many thieves. Since Mr. Yi took office, those people have all fled far away. Therefore, recently, there has been no alarm on the Jiuqu Bridge.</p>
<h3>Yongda Electric Appliance Company Will Greatly Expand</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Huang Jiafu took over the Yongda Electric Appliance Company on Fourth Road last winter, he has strengthened the rectification and reduced the prices of various electric appliance retail and wholesale prices uniformly. Therefore, the business in this port and other ports has increased greatly. Because the original address could not meet the needs, it is said that a new, tall 洋房has been selected on Daxin Street, south of Fourth Road, and is being rushed to install day and night. It will be opened after the work is completed.</p>

<h3>Yan and Feng Appoint Fake Division Commander and Grand Guardian, Birds of a Feather Flock Together, Unexpectedly Assembling Over Two Thousand Rabble. When Yan and Feng's treasonous intentions were not yet apparent, it was heard that they possessed considerable influence, hoping to enlist them for future disturbances in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They secretly appointed him to the position of Division Commander of the Third Division. As Shu, having the nominal title of Military Protector, secretly organized a fake division, appointing fake officials. Subsequently, due to various reasons, Yan and Feng's relationship was uncertain, leading to a lack of salary disbursements. Dispersing them was also beyond their power. The most severe suffering in the eight counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang began in the eighteenth year. Formally becoming outlaws, they lived by robbery and theft, with Pig Luo A-Mei, Lu Yaosheng, and Yang Meimei as deputy leaders, commanding these two thousand-plus individuals, emerging and disappearing in Jinshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, Suzhou, Wujiang of Jiangsu Province, and Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu of Zhejiang Province, and other eight counties. Villages and towns, wherever they passed, were left in ruins. Residents and livestock were rarely spared. Over the past three years, they committed no fewer than a thousand incidents, including murder, arson, looting, and deceit, stopping at nothing. Compared to Chuang and Xian, they were truly not far behind. The local authorities had gathered the total number of cases they committed and categorized the case details. Among the more prominent ones, cases involving burning houses and killing people numbered over a hundred. Among them, the cases of the brutal killing of Guo Peng, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau of Lüxiang, and Jiang Tingyan, the District Chief, were the most shocking at the time. Robbery cases also exceeded three hundred. In their robberies, they often robbed three to five families or seven to eight households in one night, with loot exceeding a thousand gold pieces in each case. Cases involving several hundred gold pieces were beneath their consideration. A Shu once boasted that he would not bother robbing those without ten thousand strings of cash. Even if his brothers encountered impoverished civilians, they would not pass by their doors without entering. No wonder the people of these eight counties have been unable to sleep peacefully for years, holding them with piercing hatred, wishing to eat their flesh and sleep on their skin. Extortion cases reached over seven hundred, and the number of extortion cases committed by them even exceeded the number of arson, murder, and looting cases, reaching over seven hundred. Almost every well-off family in these eight counties had been intimidated by A Shu's gang. The extorted amounts ranged from hundreds to thousands or even millions. Wealthy households in the countryside, upon hearing A Shu's name, trembled even women and children, daring not to disobey. Therefore, their extortion was always met with compliance. Several bandit dens have already been raided. Last autumn, the National Government cleared out Feng and Yan, and after military pacification, it finally had the strength to address bandit suppression matters. Special elite troops were dispatched to assist the naval and land police, launching a large-scale encirclement. Within a few months, several bandit lairs were successively destroyed. More than a hundred bandits were killed in battle, and over three hundred were captured alive. Deputy leaders such as Pig Luo A-Mei have already been apprehended one after another. Now that the ringleader has been caught, this notorious gang can be said to be completely wiped out. After being arrested, he still attempted to bribe his way out. At 2 PM on the fifth, Tai Bao A-Shu was knocked to the ground by a detective from one district. When the two Chinese constables, number 913 and 1810, stationed at the post, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, the bandit leader immediately took out seventy-four yuan in banknotes from his pocket and gave it to the two constables, still hoping to buy his release. After being arrested, he was taken to the Huishan Police Station. After questioning by the head constable, it was confirmed that he was the bandit leader, and he was immediately detained. Yesterday morning, Inspector Su Changsheng was additionally dispatched to escort A-Shu, handcuffed and shackled, to the Special District Local Court for handling. When Xu Pucheng, the District Chief of Minhang, heard that A-Shu had been captured alive by his subordinates, he immediately led Deputy Captain Zhao Puzhong, Detective Captain Huan Guanlin, and other detectives to the Minhang District Office in Shanghai to welcome and take custody of him. After arriving at the court yesterday morning, Xiao Xiefen, the judge, ascended to the third courtroom and ordered the bandit leader to be brought before the court. First, Li Zhishan, the police station lawyer, stated the circumstances of the bandit leader leading his gang to disturb various counties in the two provinces, and finally stated that the inland authorities requested extradition, and the police station also expressed agreement. Next, Inspector Su reported the situation of the two Chinese constables assisting the naval police detectives in capturing the bandit, and presented the bribe money as evidence. A Shu was escorted to Minhang by a moving truck for questioning. A Shu said he had nothing to confess. The official questioned him about the confession he made at the police station and asked if it was his confession. He also made no indication. Finally, District Chief Xu personally submitted the extradition letter. After examining it, Judge Xiao approved the extradition to District Chief Xu for trial. Xu then ordered his followers to hire a car from the Shanghai Moving Company and drove to the Special Court. Captains Zhao and Huan supervised the detectives to take Tai Bao A-Shu out of the courtroom and onto the car. With the sound of a whistle, the car sped off towards the Minhang District Office. He did not take opium, and his spirit was listless. It was also heard that A Shu was deeply addicted to opium, needing to smoke seventeen yuan worth of opium every day. Since being arrested and leaving Shanghai, two full nights had passed, and he had not tasted the flavor of opium. His addiction flared up, making him suffer, so he was listless when questioned at the Special Court. Because he had no strength to quibble and knew that his crime was unforgivable, he remained silent, only saying that he had nothing to confess. Detectives caught a glimpse of A Shu's mistress for further questioning. This time, during the large-scale bandit suppression in the southern countryside, the authorities believed that although the area had been cleared, the bandit leaders had not been captured and could not be allowed to remain at large. Strict orders were given to quickly apprehend them. It was then learned that Tai Bao A-Shu and others were hiding in Shanghai. Therefore, secret agencies were organized in Shanghai, and informants were widely deployed. One day, a detective near the Dongxin Bridge caught a glimpse of A Shu's mistress, a woman surnamed Mou, walking out of a house and getting into a car. The detective immediately followed and pursued her. When they reached near Huade Road, the car suddenly disappeared. It was then known that A Shu must be hiding nearby. Immediately, a house was rented near Huade Road facing the street, and people were sent to observe from the window all day long. After arranging everything properly and waiting for three days, A Shu was never seen. It was thought that A Shu must not be nearby, and it was planned to withdraw the people waiting. Unexpectedly, on the fourth day, a detective suddenly saw A Shu walking alone on the road. He immediately rushed out to grab him, and with the help of patrolmen, he was captured. It was truly said that the net of heaven is vast, and nothing can escape its meshes. A Shu was escorted to Minhang at just past noon. District Chief Xu Pucheng questioned him. The bandit frankly admitted to all the crimes he had committed. After questioning, he was strictly imprisoned. According to an official in the district, in order to prevent any accidents, sentries would be posted at night. It was also heard that the bandit's younger brother was also detained in the district, but they were kept in separate custody and were not allowed to meet. He will not be shot, he should be beheaded. According to a detective, after Tai Bao A-Shu was captured, he confessed everything in detail at the police station, recounting his actions over the past two years, truthfully and without hesitation. During the interrogation, the head constable said to Tai Bao A-Shu, "According to your kind of rampant illegality, you must be shot." Tai Bao A-Shu replied, "According to my crime, I will not be shot, I should be beheaded." His attitude was very calm when he spoke. The case of Ye Zhongfang's enticement will be heard this afternoon, changed to the Third Court, presided over by Xiao Xiefen. There will be a lively scene in front of the court. The case of Chen Yan, the mother of the dancer Chen Xiuzhen, suing Ye Zhongfang, the grandson of Ye Chengzhong, for enticement, was originally scheduled to be heard in the Fifth Criminal Court by Feng Shide at 2 PM on the sixth. However, since the sixth was the Qingming Festival, the Criminal Court suspended the hearing and rescheduled it to this afternoon at 2 PM in the Third Criminal Court, presided over by Xiao Xiefen. It is expected that when this case opens today, there will be another lively scene in front of the court. Continued hearing of the Magic Troupe case, did Wu Aixian die in Tianjin? A letter has been sent to investigate, but there has been no reply yet. Lu Huiling, Yu Huisheng, Zhao Huiying, members of the Elixir Magic Troupe, and Lu Huiling's father, Lu Zhenxiang, previously sued Wu Caoyun and others in the Special District Local Court for the crime of obstructing freedom and extortion. After a trial, Xu Jiashi sentenced Wu Caoyun and others to 30 days of detention and a fine of 200 yuan each. Wu Caoyun and others did not accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court. After reviewing the case, Chief Judge Song determined that Wu Caoyun and others did not obstruct the freedom of Lu Huiling and others, nor did they have evidence of extortion. Therefore, on March 27, the first instance was overturned, and Wu Caoyun and others were found not guilty. Regarding the part where Lu Huiling and others enticed Wu Caoyun's younger sister, Wu Aixian (also known as Wu Huirong), to perform magic in Tianjin, and her life and death were still unknown, the police station filed a public prosecution with the Special District Court. Lu Zhenxiang and the other three were sent to the detention center of the Special District Local Court that night and escorted to the First Criminal Court the next day, presided over by Chief Judge Zhou Han. The police station lawyer, Gan Jingxian, filed the public prosecution, stating that Lu Zhenxiang and others were the plaintiffs in the first instance. After Chief Judge Song of the High Court overturned the first instance, Lu Zhenxiang and others were detained in the detention center of this court and escorted to court this morning. The police station believes that the first defendant, Lu Zhenxiang, is guilty of false accusation and intent to extort and illegal imprisonment and is prosecuting him under Article 180 of the Criminal Code. The second defendant, Lu Huiling, the third defendant, Yu Huisheng, and the fourth defendant, Zhao Huiying, are guilty of abduction and enticement and are being prosecuted under Article 257 of the Criminal Code. He detailed the circumstances of Lu Huiling and others enticing Wu Aixian and Lu Zhenxiang's false accusation, and finally said that according to the defendants, Wu Huirong (also known as Wu Ai) died in Tianjin. It is impossible to confirm whether Wu Huirong died in Tianjin, and someone must be sent to Tianjin to investigate before it can be confirmed. However, it will take at least two weeks to travel to and from Tianjin. Could the presiding judge please reschedule the case for two weeks? The presiding judge agreed. In addition to the plaintiffs and defendants who were present in court to testify, Jin Jiang, Wu Caoyun's mother-in-law, also testified. According to her testimony, Wu Aixian's mother was ill and unable to attend court, so she attended court to testify. She also stated that Wu Aixian was in school when she was abducted and heard that someone had sent a note inviting her to join the Elixir Magic Troupe to perform in Tianjin. Therefore, the Wu family did not know that Wu Aixian had been abducted until the second day when they received a letter from Wu Aixian before she left. The testimonies of the defendants Lu Zhenxiang and others were the same as before. However, Lu Zhenxiang said that the reason why his testimony in the High Court differed from his testimony in the first instance was that Wu Caoyun and others had asked someone to mediate, and because they were willing to reconcile, they changed their testimonies. After the interrogation, Lu Zhenxiang and others each paid a reliable bail and left to await trial. Yesterday morning, the second hearing was held. At 9 AM, Chief Judge Zhou presided over the hearing again. Lu Zhenxiang and others were all present, but Yu Huisheng was absent due to an affair. The plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, also sent his assistant, Wu Baotai, to court to defend. Wu Aixian's father also arrived in court yesterday, but his mother was still unable to attend due to illness. Wu Caoyun stated that there had been no reply from those who went to Tianjin to investigate and requested that the hearing be rescheduled. Chief Judge Zhou then summoned the defendants Lu Zhenxiang and others to question them one by one. Their testimonies confirmed that Wu Huirong had indeed died in Tianjin and that when she left Shanghai, she was looking after herself. The rest of their testimonies were the same as before. After the interrogation, the defendants were still released on their original bail. The case was rescheduled to be heard again at 2 PM next Tuesday. Four kidnappers in the Cai Fulin case were sentenced to death, two cars, one house on Wuding Road, and one Yong'an deposit book were confiscated. The remaining bandits were also sentenced separately. Lu Liankui, Chief Inspector of the General Patrol Room, and Inspectors Liu Shaokui, Tang Jian, and Detectives Feng Zhiming and Shang Wu, successively captured a large number of male and female bandits, including Dong Yushu and Ye Ruchun, totaling 32 people, on November 7th of last year. Many guns and bullets, as well as stolen foreign currency and other items, were confiscated. After detailed investigation, it was found that 13 of the defendants had not committed any crimes within the concession and were released or sent to other authorities for punishment. The remaining 20 men and women were found to have used weapons to kidnap Cai Fulin, a comprador of the British-American Tobacco Company, for ransom outside house number 55 and a half on Hede Road on the evening of September 18th of last year and to have committed seven robbery cases. They were sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi repeatedly opened hearings and concluded the case. Yesterday morning, the sentencing was due. The police escorted the defendants to court, and the lawyers representing the defendants Yang Anshi and Yang Li's, Fan Gang, and Zhang Jin's, Jiang Yiping, were all present to hear the verdict. However, Judge Wu Tingqi, who was supposed to preside over the trial, was on leave yesterday due to an affair, so Judge Ge Zhiqin acted as a substitute to announce the verdict. At 9:30 AM, Judge Ge ascended to the Second Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The defendants Ye Ruchun, Rong Jiannan, Zhu Rongye, and Wang Zhongmei were each sentenced to death for the crime of kidnapping for ransom. One Citroen car, one Chevrolet car, one house at 401 Wuding Road, Yonggong Company deposit book, and 1,500 yuan in stolen foreign currency, as well as 300 yuan in stolen foreign currency, were all confiscated. Dong Yushu was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, Yu Ansheng to three years, Zhang Rongfu to eleven years, Qiang Kunbei to fifteen years, and Chen Enwei to twelve years. Zhang Jin was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for receiving stolen goods, with the number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized allowed to offset one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention. Guns and bullets were confiscated. The remaining defendants Shen Xingda, Shen Yonglin, Xia Jintang, Jin Rongsheng, Rong Wangshi, Yang Li's, Zhao Xinrong, Yang Anshi, and Tang Buzai were all found not guilty. Wang Fusheng was suffering from illness, so the trial proceedings were suspended. After the verdict was announced, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stood up and requested that all the defendants who were found not guilty be allowed to remain in custody during the appeal period, which the court granted. The Sen Tai Tobacco and Paper Shop is suspected of arson. The smell of kerosene is overflowing in the neighborhood. The shop only has a small amount of inferior tobacco. However, the shopkeeper still denies arson. Zhuang Jinming, a native of Suzhou, once opened a silk factory and rented the city rooms at numbers 711 and 712 downstairs in the World Hotel at the intersection of Xizang Road and Aidoo Road to open the Sen Tai Tobacco and Paper Shop, the Qingliang Pavilion Ice Room, and the Xinfa Xing Chestnut Shop. Among them, the Qingliang Pavilion had a very large amount of fire insurance, but the rents of all the shops were in arrears, and the amount was also insufficient. At about 3 AM on the 5th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out in the Sen Tai shop. Smoke filled the air, and the smell of kerosene was in the neighborhood. Gu Aquan and Zhong Dezhang, waiters at the World Hotel, both smelled this smell. They went out to check from the front and back doors. As soon as Gu went out the back door, he saw two people rushing out of the Sen Tai shop, smashing the kerosene lamp hanging high above the shop door, and the oil in the lamp splashed everywhere, making the fire even fiercer. Gu immediately twisted these two people over to the patrolmen. After questioning, it was learned that their names were Wang Yuanda and Fang Sibao. Wang admitted that he was an employee of Sen Tai. After the incident, the head constable sent Western Inspector Whilmpson and Chinese Inspectors Cui Jinchuan and Wang Yingjie to investigate. They saw that there was only a very small amount of extremely inferior cigarettes in the Sen Tai shop, and nothing else. But the Qingliang Pavilion had a large amount of insurance, and it was obvious that they were setting the fire to claim the insurance money. Zhuang Jinming was nowhere to be found when the fire broke out. It was not until the afternoon of the next day that he returned to the shop from outside and was also arrested by the detectives. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special District Local Court along with Wang and Fang for investigation. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a public danger charge under Article 187 of the Criminal Code, and described the investigation and requested a postponement. Westerners from the Fire Brigade and Gu Aqin testified one after another, while Zhuang Jinming and his shopkeeper denied arson and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. Chief Judge Zhou ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing. An old woman in her twilight years committed suicide by taking poison while visiting her husband's grave. The tragic history is unbearable to hear. Wei Du, an old woman from Nanjing, currently lives in Caojiadu. Her husband passed away many years ago, and his remains are in the altar land in Wusong. The old woman is sixty-six years old this year and does not want her twilight years to be bad. Having lost her son and her daughter-in-law remarried and left, she is alone and her life is difficult. She often hates that she did not die sooner. At noon the day before yesterday, because it was the Qingming Festival, she carried ingots and silk to her late husband's grave and burst into loud sobs. After crying, she fell to the ground and fainted. The old woman has a nephew, Du Lianrong, who lives at 18 Hongjia Hall in Wusong. Hearing that his aunt had gone to Song to visit the grave, he went to visit her and saw that his aunt was barely breathing. He rushed her to the Seaside Hospital and determined that she had taken poison. The old woman gasped and said that before sweeping the tomb, she had taken one yuan of opium in advance, so she committed suicide in front of her late husband's grave and recounted her tragic history, which was unbearable to hear. After speaking, she died. The incident occurred at 7 PM. When the Seventh District Police Station learned of this, they summoned Du Lianrong to the station for questioning, and Du was unable to afford a coffin. Therefore, the police station ordered the local bailiff, Zhou Lansheng, to report to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Wu and others were appointed to come to the scene to confirm the death and ordered the body to be collected for safekeeping pending further instructions. The deaf-mute worker was found to have been beaten to death. The murderer, Yan Jinfang, is being severely pursued. Zhao Dumb, a native of Yancheng, 30 years old, was working as a partner with Dong Changlin, a Taizhou native, in the Japanese Osaka Wharf coal barge in Yangshupu. At 4 PM on the 24th of last month, he had a dispute with his fellow villager Ye Jinfang over work and was hit in the head by Ye with a bamboo stick, instantly killing him. The shop owner, Dong Changlin, considered the case to be related to human life and secretly coffined the body, falsely claiming that he had fallen from a height and died. He sent the coffin to the Taizhou Guild Hall. Later, Zhao's younger brother, Zhao Aiguo, learned of this and reported it to the police. The police sent detectives to investigate. The murderer and Dong had both fled in fear of punishment. Ye's wife, Pan, and shopkeeper Zhang Yangquan, were detained and sent to the Special District Local Court and were ordered to be remanded in custody, pending a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to move Zhao Dumb's coffin to the Feilun Road autopsy site for examination and verification. This has already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the police station moved Zhao Dumb's coffin to the autopsy site. The Special Court appointed Prosecutor Qian to the site. After the forensic doctor opened the coffin for examination, the case was heard in court. According to Zhao Abao's complaint, the deceased was his cousin. After the incident, his younger brother, Zhao Aiguo, came to inform him, so he reported it to the police, etc. According to Zhao Aiguo's statement, his brother, Zhao Dumb, was injured by Ye Jinfang that day and came to him, using sign language to indicate that he had been beaten in the head with a bamboo stick. He should seek justice. Questioned about Ye Pan's statement, it was the same as her previous testimony in court. Qian then ruled that the deceased, Zhao Dumb, had been struck in the head and killed and ordered the body to be coffined by his brother. He ordered the police station to strictly arrest the murderer, Ye Jinfang, and bring him to trial. A brave Western child caught a mad dog. According to the Shanghai Times, last Saturday, several Western children were playing in the garden of a Westerner on Fuxu Road. Suddenly, a mad dog burst in and bit a girl's leg. It then turned to bite a boy. Seeing that it was about to bite others, the boy ignored the pain and bleeding from his wound and rushed to catch the dog, tightly holding its throat until someone in the house heard the noise and rushed over, covering the dog's head with clothes before they were able to subdue and kill it. The boy's name is Ya Bing, a student at the Hanbi Li Western Children's School. If he had not risked his life to catch the mad dog that day, there would have been many more injured. It is reported that the boy and girl have been treated by a doctor, and there should be no danger. Pan Xitang, the bandit leader in the Liang Shaoxuan case, awaits sentencing. Liang Shaoxuan, a native of Guangdong, was planning to go out to meet a friend on September 20, 1927, when he was kidnapped in Deqing Lane, Peng Road. The police cracked the case and arrested 12 kidnappers. After a trial by the Special District Court, Zhang Guizhi, Chen Yuefu, and Ge Wenzhang were found not guilty and released. The remaining bandits were sentenced to death, etc. This has been reported in this newspaper. Among them, one of the bandit leaders, Pan Xitang, had not been convicted because the case was unclear. It was claimed that Liang Shaoxuan was still working in Meng Yu Ji Wheat Shop in Zhenjiang when he was kidnapped. Although he met the other bandits after coming to Shanghai, he did not conspire with them. In order to prove his statement, Judge Ge specially wrote to Zhenjiang. The court reopened yesterday and announced that the Zhenjiang Wheat Document had investigated and found that there was no Meng Yu Ji Wheat Shop. The police lawyer then requested that he be sentenced according to the law. Judge Ge then appointed lawyer Chen Bingxing as the designated defense lawyer, arguing that the photos found in the bandit's lair were given out of friendship and were not taken with the bandits. Although Zhenjiang said there was no Meng Yu Ji Wheat Shop, the letter only said there was no such shop, not that the defendant was not in Zhenjiang. If it is said that the previously decided bandits all recognized Pan Xitang as the bandit leader, it was because Pan Xitang had not yet been arrested at that time, in order to evade guilt and seek leniency. The police lawyer refuted it once again, and the sentencing was scheduled for the afternoon of April 14. The foster son often lives at the foster mother's house. The mother is 25 years old, and the son is 18 years old. The case of a woman enticing a minor was sent to court. Xie Jinrong, a native of Jinan, who lives at 66 Dingyuan Lane, Qiujiang Road, reported to the Second District Police Station yesterday that his son, Xie Jinxin, 18 years old this year, had been enticed into illicit relations by a woman surnamed Chen Li, who lives at 826 Fangxie Road, and that she had hidden his son in her house for her lust and had not allowed him to return home for two years. She was intending to commit adultery and enticed a man under the age of 20. Based on the principle of equality between men and women, he requested an arrest and investigation. The police dispatched officers to arrest both Chen Li and Xie Jinxin. According to Chen Li's statement, she is 25 years old and her husband is deceased. Xie Jinxin is my husband's foster son, and I am his foster mother, so it is not surprising that he lives in my house. Jinrong repeatedly tried to rape me without success, so he made this shameless false accusation. Xie Jinxin stated that he was 18 years old and did not dare to go home because he was afraid that his father would always beat him. The police deemed the circumstances of this case to be bizarre and ordered that they be escorted to the local court for interrogation. Tenants in Sanli expressed their gratitude to the mediators for rent reduction. A large silver shield was respectfully presented to Messrs. Du and Jin. Over 150 households of tenants in Li Xian, Zhi Zhong, and De Xing Sanli on the east and west sides of the Xinxin Bridge Street in the French Concession, due to the Executive Committee of the United Association, Mr. Zhou Yingshi, and others, invited lawyer Jin Yu to represent them and requested the landlord, Tongren Fuyuantang, to reduce rents. After two months of hard work and repeated negotiations, they did not hesitate to be exhausted. With the strong mediation of Mr. Du Yuesheng, a well-known figure in Shanghai, a satisfactory solution was reached. The table was extremely grateful. They learned that all the tenants had specially held a banquet at Hongyunlou at 7 PM the night before and cast several large silver shields, which were respectfully sent to Mr. Du, lawyer Jin, and others yesterday to express their gratitude. A fire broke out on the Zhenru Car Department Road. At about 1 PM yesterday afternoon, a car alarm suddenly sounded on the Zhenru Railway Station Road, saying that about ten Jiangbei thatched sheds had been completely burned down in less than half an hour. By the time the fire truck arrived, it was too late to rescue them. Fortunately, the police heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, and the order was still good. Later, a fire starter named Xu Wenshan was arrested and taken to the station for questioning, but there was no major relationship. Because there were no tiled houses nearby, there were no insured households. Chen Jingfo paints Buddhas.

The wind direction is undetermined in other coastal areas. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 65.8 degrees, and the lowest was 38.1 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 60.1 degrees, and the lowest was 55.2 degrees. Important: The Guangji Collection in Guangji, Hangzhou, respectfully presents an Effective Elixir for the treatment of rabies and snake bites. A report on the past year's situation, with added experienced diagnostic methods, and a decoction formula, respectfully announces that there are countless people in our country who suffer from rabies and snake bites every year, and there is no effective remedy. Last year, this collection respectfully presented about 3,000 bottles of Effective Elixir, including those distributed in other places. The number of people cured of snake bites is countless. There are about 100 people who have reported to this collection that they have been cured of rabies. The number of people cured by the Elixir distributed in other places who have not reported is not included. It was found that only 11 provinces in our country sent letters to request the Elixir last year, because when the newspaper was published, it happened to be a time of many events. The northeast, northwest, and southwest provinces were not yet aware of it. Now, the Elixir formula and the formulas for preparing watermelon frost and light gypsum in the formula are completely disclosed and listed below. When Guizi is three qian, seven fen, and five li, old-style waist yellow (i.e., good male essence, water-flying pure) is one liang, five qian, nine fen, and six li, rhinoceros yellow is one qian and five fen, Shangmei Western slices are three qian and three fen, Guizhou mountain taro is six qian, made-up floating gypsum is five qian and four fen, made-up Western moonstone is three qian, four fen, and five li, and made-up watermelon frost is four qian, nine fen, and eight li. The weight of each medicine must be weighed accurately, and there must be no slight deviation. First, grind each medicine into a fine powder, mix them evenly, and then grind them together and put them into a ceramic or glass bottle. Each bottle should contain one fen, and the mouth of the bottle should be sealed with sealing wax to prevent air from leaking out. If someone is bitten by a rabid dog or snake, use a silver needle to dip in saliva, then stick the Elixir to the corners of both eyes, applying it three or four times a day for three to five days. At the same time, take it orally as appropriate. For minor injuries, use five li of Elixir; for severe injuries, use one fen; for the most severe injuries, use two fen. All should be taken with thick Puhuo soup. Also, wet the wound with saliva and apply the Elixir, then apply light plaster to prevent the Elixir from falling off. The poison will be eliminated and the wound will heal in three to five days. Pregnant women should only use the eye application method and should not take it orally. Experienced Diagnostic Method: There are many prescriptions for treating rabies in our country, but they all suffer from a lack of accurate diagnostic methods. Every time, even after treatment, the poison still flares up and leads to death. This collection has, based on years of experience and reports from various parties, obtained five diagnostic methods: (1) The red streaks in the whites of the eyes disappear; (2) There is no sticky, turbid, or foul substance in the stool; (3) The urine is clear and normal; (4) Chewing raw soybeans reveals a fishy smell; (5) There is no fear of fanning with a cattail fan. If these five clear signs are present, it is known that the poison has been eliminated. Patients are still asked to pay attention to the above five items, distinguish and verify them, and report them to this collection in detail so that they can be further verified and complete success can be achieved. This is essential and highly hoped for. "Floating Gypsum Preparation Method": Select one or two liang of top floating gypsum, intend to quench it three times, then use one qian and five fen of Jingbi mustard, four qian of rhubarb, two qian of white peony, four qian of Gujing grass, two qian of Saposhnikovia divaricata, two qian of Euphorbia pekinensis, eight fen of peppermint, three qian of Yishu, four qian of Yinhu cicada slough, ten grains of Schisandra chinensis, one qian of licorice, three qian of Guishen, two qian of white chrysanthemum, two qian of Forsythia suspensa, and one fen of light alkali nitrate. Combine the above medicines and decoct a bowl of thick juice, and use it to quench the gypsum that has been calcined until red. Calcine and quench again until the juice is exhausted. The gypsum should be calcined in a silver pot over high heat (the gypsum that has already been prepared in the pharmacy has different formulas and is not applicable). "Watermelon Frost Preparation Method": Take a large watermelon, cut open the stem, dig out some of the pulp, and fill the center with one catty of light alkali nitrate. Store it in a large porcelain container. In winter, use snow water to decoct the watermelon juice thoroughly, filter out the residue, add more snow water, decoct it into a juice, and filter it through a fine cloth bag. When the weather is freezing cold, boil this juice and put it into a clean small jar. Use leafless bamboo branches to pass through the juice in the small jar, and the night frost will condense on the bamboo branches. Take it off, and it is watermelon frost. The one that has</h3>
