<h3>日本内閣改組</h3>
<p>日本之若槻内閣。今已再度實現矣。觀其閣員人選之名單。僅陸軍商工拓務三相易人而已。些三人中雖似以陸相宇垣氏之去職。關係最爲重要。然字垣之辭。不自今始去年即曾因病堅辭推薦南大將繼任。後政府多數主張。以現時正值政府與海軍紛爭之後。辭恐爲反對黨所利用。故皆極力慰留。而字垣遂亦不得不勉爲其難。今乘改組之機會而辭。可見陸相一席之易人。非於政局有何種關係。亦可知此次若槻組閣一循濱口内閣之舊非不得已必不更張者也。昨若槻在兩院議員聯合招待會中演説。謂濱口回復健康期在不遠。本黨可再迎名總裁。余之就任。不過暫時而已日本各方面對此演説。均極重視。惟以吾人觀之。濱口亦不過表示其謙誠。與决不多所更張之意耳。亦非有其他深遠之意味也。竊謂今日新内閣組成而後。首黨注意者。爲敵黨之態度如何。政友會對於若槻内閣。尚未有若何表示。使政友會而果無急劇之反對。或且有人幹旋而一反從前竸爭之態度。則日政局或能相安於一時若槻内閣可望小康。否則在此國内與國際多故之際若槻之手腕。雖稱機敏亦豈易應付之哉。</p>

<p>輔仁大學足球隊昨日下午四時與曁南大學足球隊作友誼比賽於中華棒球場、此爲該隊南來後之第三戰、輔仁表演甚佳、先攻人曁南一球、但不久連失二次十二碼、结果以一比三敗北、昨日觀者甚稀秒、中有一部份漫駡呌囂、對裁判員施以攻擊、殊失常態、亟應糾正者、記其略情如次、</p>

<p>葉德祿　房歌春（上）　祝福祥（下）　李鴻業　曹育　張之楨</p>
<h3>曁南大將不齊</h3>
<p>曁南陣線、昨日上半局、異常軟弱、後衛江善敬未來、梅　寳·羅海光·亦均受傷未　、林松發直至下半局才至、形勢乃轉、楊保森之右前衛極軟弱無能之至、有如江堤决口、洪水源源從此道而來、江善敬又缺席、故上半時倍受輔仁攻擊、下半時陳家球改朁楊位、漏巵遂壅、前鋒表演平平、可觀者戴麟經陳鎭和而已、</p>
<h3>輔仁雖敗不差</h3>
<p>輔仁表演、甚爲佳妙、觀者嘖嘖稱美、無怪輔仁失敗、有爲之咆哮呌不平者、雖然輔仁之敗、自之不愼也、前鋒聯絡甚佳、中衛堅强、守門亦安穏、後衛實爲最弱點、失球旣多、而二次十二碼、犯規甚明顯、否則雖不能勝曁南亦可打成和局、綜觀全隊工夫、當謂不差矣、</p>
<h3>輔仁破門先勝</h3>
<p>裁判員周家麒、鳴笛開賽、最初輔仁形勢、銳不可當、曁南時陷於危、以致疲命、曁南開球、輔仁張之楨截得之前送、葉德祿一脚反勾、五鋒齊進、曹育攻門、江宗錦拍出、葉德祿傳送至中、唐國樑趕上遠射、雖不中不遠矣、嗣後輔仁極優、猛攻無已、曁南乘機反舉、戴陳二人、兵力單薄、一無成就、二十分鐘之際、張之楨自右急進、内部空虚、馮運佑往阻、不得已、撥成角球、張之楨主賜、三四盤旋、房歌春一頂、江宗錦跳起來撲得、中鋒李鴻業、蹴之而進、輔仁遂以先勝、</p>
<h3>二次十二碼球</h3>
<p>不五分鐘、輔仁忽臨頭大禍、符和萱盤球猛進、輔仁門前、空洞無人、董世祚趕往救阻、操之過急、失手一推符倒於地、於是判罰十二碼、戴中鋪踢去、適中門心、王與民撲得而又失、遂成一一平手、禍不單行、輔仁又以十二碼敗、其時爲戴麟經陳鎭和董榮文三軍齊進、師行及門、崔永錫來救、手自起彈起、適中手上、戴麟經　中二碼、球自下人又中、上半時曁南反以二比一勝、下半時曁南加入林松發、軍勢大穏、十五分鐘時、戴中鋒猛政一脚、準而有力、再破敵門、曁南結果以三比一勝、</p>
<h3>觀者囂叫失態</h3>
<p>昨有一部份觀者、以輔仁連罰二次十二碼、遂大聲呌囂、攻擊裁判員、甚至有高聲謾駡者、殊爲失態之甚、犯規則處罰、明文規定、無可作僞、且運動重精神、次爲勝負、次爲友誼賽、成敗無傷大雅、兩隊極融洽之精神、或經之一呌囂、而生誤會、則呌者愛之、適足以害之、觀者又非運動專家、無得輕加無根據之評判、甚望以後、嚴加改革也、</p>
<h3>明日戰復旦隊</h3>
<p>明日下午、輔仁將與復旦大學作臨别一戰、地點在江灣、</p>

<p>是日該院大門口懸有（胡笠僧先生六週紀念會塲）十一字竹布横額。風吹雨打。墨跡已化。禮堂上。中懸于右任所贈之湖色綢幛。嵌有（華嶽歸神）四大字。旁懸張岳軍所送之輓聯。文日（六載想風徽。中原幾換滄桑劫。）（百年成契闊。大績長留天地間。）桌上供有黄紙神位一。約長尺餘。闊五寸。頭脚鑲色紅紙。上繪金蓮花。并嵌（佛光普照）四字。下書）故上將軍胡公笠僧之位）數字。位前供素菜八大四小。及茶飯各一盅。曁高脚盆八。内裝水菓乾點各四色。香燭並立。桌下置大花圈二。圈上繫林實季良四字名剌。一懸上海市市長張羣之名片。廂房内。左供茶點。爲來賓休息之所。右爲簽到處。派員管理。因發起諸人。遠在平京蘇杭各處。到者不多。會塲布置。聞係陳之碩所承辦。陳君於胡公任河南督軍時。擔任財政廳長。與其交深。故是日所述胡公行誼甚詳。大致謂公係陜西富平人。少孤。賴祖母撫養成人。有大志。憤清政不綱。於宣統元年。加入同盟會。結合渭南革合同志。以圖大舉。辛亥武昌起義。公即任新軍標統。響應於陜中。時年甫及冠。功成後。自願解甲而赴日留學。民國二年回國。被推爲征蒙司令。事阻未實現。復赴日謁總理。規畫軍事。甚爲詳盡。即以陜事相屬。回國後。迭建奇勛。病没時。年僅三十有四云云。聽乾得動容。是日因胡公親友寥落。故公祭時。不尚形式。各人隨到隨祭。張市長三時冒雨蒞會。穿西裝。披大氅。入門卸去大氅。對神位行三鞠躬禮。面有憂色。述及弔客不多。頻歎蕭條而願獨任今日之費用。輓聯中以李印泉所撰者爲最沉痛。日（感舊六年長。世事艱難君竟去）。（歸神三界外。知交零落我何堪。）蓋李君息影吳門。研究佛學。不問世事。已數易寒暑。年來親朋凋謝。平素已甚慨歎。對於故友逝世六週紀念。觸景生情。無怪其感恫不置矣。</p>
<h3>爲自殺者棒喝</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>人旣有生。疇能無死。故自呱呱堕地之時。即有渺渺還空之日。死固不必哀。且亦不足哀。佛家言槃湼。列子言仁者息。不肖者伏。吾家蒙叟云方死方生。賈誼則謂生浮死休。是則人之生於世。兩手並足以超於物類者。雖壽至百歲。而庸庸者流。醉生夢死。留此臭皮囊。徒然汚穢天壞間。亦屬倖生。先師仲尼則謚之日賊。蓋所以誅之者深已。</p>
<p>歐人有持犧牲主義。謂非提倡斯多葛學派不可以救世者。而吾國儒家亦有朝聞夕死之訓。可謂殊途而同歸。然人者生物也。一死而不可復活者也。使閱世未久。以青年之資格。而棄黄金之歲月。徒以一瞑不視。决焉舍去一身以自了。則縱脫却形骸。葆此靈魂。究之其心雖不死。而其身已死。亦復何益。</p>
<p>吾國近以人才寥落爲憂。正賴後起之英多磊落者。乘時以出。蔚爲晶光。而乃不自固結。忘其最初。甘奄忽以長逝。遽爾泯然澌滅。不知與草木同腐者。同歸於盡。又有何異。豈眞憂能傷人。而不可以須臾待也。今情天之變幻磨常。慾海之沸波何定。翻雲覆雨之交。恒二三其德者。直項背相望耳。朝爲鸞鳳。夕化鴟梟。欲渡愛河而超恨海。非庸碌者所能冀。則知人之煩悶。與吾生以俱來。雖處極不自由之境。且視爲備嘗艱苦之地。以自懺悔。否則。徒自悲傷抑鬰。而博得情死兩字。其自待抑何薄耶。</p>
<p>噫。今之自殺者。無論男女。而要之以少年爲多。欲免此流行病。吾謂當明此三要義。第一須從思慮上覺悟。第二須從物質上銷融。第三須從心理上體察。三者能明。而復加以克治之功。則人天之幸福。美滿之良緣。胥於是乎覘矣。如不互相提撕。徒見瓊渚蘭苕。空艶同心之影。瑤台桃李。莫非短命之花。而猶日環境所迫。時勢所弗許。不得不以一死自謝。不知此仍自爲之。而於人乎何尤。此余所以不能不重言以責者此也。</p>
<h3>佘山紀游</h3>
<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>松江古稱雲間。有九峯三泖之勝。九峯爲鳳凰山。薛山。（即玉屏山）佘山。辰山。（即神山即細林山）厙山。（即厙公山）機山。横山。（即横雲山）天馬山。（即干山）昆山。（即小崑山）諸山相離立。如幽人冠帶拱揖狀。雖無奇偉雄傑之觀。而清逸淡秀亦自有勝槪。其風景之優美。尤推佘山。佘山去松江縣青浦縣各十二里。在盧山東北。神山塘之東。高八十丈。周十八里。其高其大。爲他山所不及。舊傳有佘姓養道於此。成仙去。故名。春假得暇。因偕友往焉。艦舟往。及山麓。捨舟登陸。則山形如相抱然。作半園狀。有東西二山。西山一峰。東山二峰。由西山進。有竹無數。風篁翠篠。掩翳全山。稍進。山上有碧仙寺。循道上。則殿久毁。惟偏屋存。署日栖碧山房。香火殊冷落。下而更進。至於天主堂之門。門上立聖母像。入門。拾級而登。山半則禮拜堂在焉。下望。有小湖如秋葉。折而西。有三小亭。歷落而建。亭各有像。一爲耶穌懷一小兒。一爲瑪利亞。一爲耶穌掬赤心以示。稍却更上。則爲之字路。路旁盡植樹。路之兩端。各建一祠。祠中刻耶穌被難故事。凡祠十四。路逐端上行。遂逹於頂。頂方建大禮拜堂。施工已七八年。尚未竣事。堂基可畝許。凡基礎柱檻。皆以石爲之。光潔如鋗。又雕各種圖案於其上。蓋合莊嚴堅固華美而一之。故工程之浩大。他處所未覯也。詢之工人云。合頂之期。尚須二三載也。其東有天文臺。前時可以望月中作何狀。今則儀器已運赴徐家匯矣。旁有一塔。頽壞不可上。殆即秀道者塔也。至此。西山已盡。於時日向午。腹中飢。乃下。就船棚下。踞小艇中。傾瓶中醖飲之。又向山家買纔出土新筍。即就竃煮熟。略入醬油。盛以大碗。捧至艇中。衆箸畢舉。頃刻而盡。味極鮮美。便笑熊掌魚翅。徒負盛名耳。飯畢。乃登東山。縱目四顧。則田疇罫列。長河如帶。胸襟爲之一　。旣下。沿河西行。有巨石突出河畔。可坐。土人云。此陳眉公釣魚磯也。隔岸有數柳樹。柳條映水如布綱。游魚出入其間。凝觀久之。不减濠上也。大抵山中之樹。以竹爲最多。可十之八。其他柏樹榆樹檜樹銀杏樹等纔十二耳。至於宋代所建之靈峰菴。西菴。東菴。及明代所建之昭慶寺。慧日寺。宣妙寺。今皆無有矣。山之大半。皆爲教堂産。不審當時孰以售之。可嘅也。薄暮乃鼓棹返。同游者。顧造英。顧志周。顧景臯昆季。蔡晦。張德齋。費承萊。識之以爲他日鴻爪焉。</p>

<h3>印度遊記（二四）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>入夜。天氣驟冷。晨起乃着中國棉袍。同居之僧人從錫蘭來者。亦多受凉。余亦然。因錫蘭島氣候温和。不若加城之變異也。余行於市。見人披毯子。或黄或綠。以爲此人偶買毯子回家。置於肩上携之者也。及見多人皆披毯子於肩。余乃怪何買毯者之多也。而毯子均披於肩。細察之無人不披毯子。問之人。乃知此即印人之衣服。余百思不解也。若有一毯夜可蓋。畫則披之過冬。已足矣。但可惜街旁窮人尚披一層單衣。臥於地上。殊堪憐憫耳。余旣讀法顯傳。知弘佛法於中國者。不僅爲印度人。錫蘭島人得吾國貢獻亦甚大。錫蘭雖一島。而在文化交通史上占優等位置。故對錫蘭僧倍加敬重。并望其再來東士。弘揚大法。錫蘭僧正讀印度獨立運動首領甘地傳。勸我讀之。余旣感於一到印度。充滿甘地空氣。印人信服之至。過於信佛。乃一人兼政治經濟道德宗教之信仰。而并吸收之。此重要世界人物。不可不研究其大略。以告我國人也。</p>
<p>十號。余乃忙人。無暇多讀書。而甘地傳乃甚厚一巨册。凡五百八十餘西頁。其自傳而由學生譯成英文者。余盡一日夜之力。撮其在綱如下。請國民一注意焉。　　甘地自傳不必讀。一望其像片。可一目了然。乃一乞丐像。上下無衣裳。只腰間園一布巾。眞可謂眞人也已。相貎亦似一乞丐且絲毫無異。而今爲印度政教經濟運動之中心首領。豈不可怪。吾意世界聖人亦多乞丐也。佛舍王位爲乞丐耶蘇身不許帶錢。從村至村。梭格拉底赤足游化。甘地正其流耳。而加一種民族運動。遂兼政教而一之也。其自傳中多雜用梵語。亦未易讀。英名（我生經騐之信史。）The　story　of　My　Experiment　with　trnth　by　Gaudbi印度有四階級。第一爲僧侣第二爲王與官。第三爲商。第四爲農工。甘地乃第三級人民。父爲經騐之商人。而無學問。母爲敬虔之印度教徒。而甘地自幼受其乳母名拉姆罕之化念一神名日拉馬拉那Ramanama者不少也。</p>

<h3>釐市趁勢騰昂</h3>
<p>市塲槪况昨因客帮銷胃大　、人心異常挺秀、致市氣大好、尤以銀行方面作大舉之買進、因之供方讓步、厘價頓見騰貴、然銀根趨勢、祗以需胃雖有、未能暢達、故形勢仍難轉機、又輔幣中之角洋市價、亦步堅挺、蓋亦有去路也　　厘拆價格（洋厘）早市厘價以供求不埒、買氣大盛、結果昂至七錢二分七厘七毫半、較前日早市昂價又好一厘、午市續加一毫二忽半、爲七錢二分七厘八毫七忽半、開今年所未見之新紀錄（銀拆）早市白借、與前日依然相同、劃頭仍無加水、</p>

<p>紗市略堅、蓋以外棉轉漲、現紗銷路日漸起色、華北一帶辦量甚暢、川帮亦絡繹不絶、故現紗情形頗佳、大慨各方仍有發展之望、但多數心理甚平、以粗紗底貨尚厚、故賣價難以提高、對於期紗逢漲仍抛空、所以市勢依然鬆懈、毫無緊俏之狀、惟大户態度堅挺、仍無放出之念、惟有良好消息、市而未能十分向榮、不過照大勢論之、當有上漲之望、</p>

<h3>糧食　米市北堅南定</h3>
<p>閘北昨日内地到船三十餘號、而市特高粳因稀而無榮辱、中關普通各粳則走銷續活、各方購進甚殷、行情轉昂角許、市形漸趨佳象、薄稻貨少銷呆、交易寥寥、價呈平定、羊秈去胃平庸、惟特别貨帶堅外、餘則勉守原盤而已、杜埠秈到銷兩滯、市無上落、白元到源見接、客銷街銷一致沉寂、大盤則尚稱定局耳、</p>
<p>滬南昨日裏路到船二十號左右、本街銷場仍呆、常蘇各機白粳在晨初尚告喊短、旋因北訉告堅、市遂轉定、結果統統無上落、南帮薄早稻市勢呆木、祗少數去化、行情平庸、羊牡尖買氣仍靜、價格高定次削、變元陰化吊胃依然欠佳、情况始終呆弱、特頂變元開十一元三四角、</p>
<h3>北帮試辦客米</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、仍形活絡、除廣帮繼續試辦外、北帮天津等亦以該地糧銷活動、在市試辦裝往、倘能運銷合划、尚有繼續裝辦也、客元辦意尤佳、全市由北帮辦去湖南機元米二百包、價十四元零六分、江西機早一百五十包、價十元零九角七分、廣帮辦去江西機晚七十一包、價十一元二角二分、價與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>標粉市近俏遠平</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開後盤、各月份市面、呈近俏遠平之象、以洋麥報價、又較好二三角不等、全部份人心、當然帶起、不過近遠期以需要之不同、趁勢略有出人、因本月份客銷尚佳、兼以各廠現粉、目下已可抽裝、大致均照標準加七分半或一錢不等、因此市氣自然穏定、遠期因外行人心不佳、授受均少、勢成平定、惟後步如本月份再俏、遠期或須帶起一些、結果本月份較前日好一分二厘半、五月份一厘六月份不動、七月份好二厘半、八九月份不動云、</p>
<h3>期麥市平穏局勢</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平穏之局、因洋麥報價、又好二三角、觀望風色者、自趨穏態、不過目下之内地帮、因麥苗雖較往年毠遜、但此後已接近新貨時令、以洋麥之如是湧積、廠用不若往年之豐、故大致觀望、買氣反寂也、結果本月份下午未開、上午好一分、五月份較前日好二分、六七八月份好一分九月份小一分云、</p>

<h3>南北貨桃肉存稀後市看好</h3>
<p>桃肉邇來之津市價高昂、故無到來、漢口雖較廉、現市亦不接近、而路貨不多、照目下存底而論、將來恐難接新、故後市當有升無降、據漢訉辦價爲四十一兩六錢、加一切外費、反較申市爲高、此間昨市行盤售四十五兩、趨勢穏固、</p>
<h3>絲茶黄白廠經價小難暢</h3>

<h3>餘杭着手孵化蠶種</h3>

<h3>路莊珍眉法銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日來路路之珍眉綠茶、怡和錦隆等行、均因上星期發出電報、法莊業已回電需要、繼續談判結果成交五百六十餘箱、價開四十八兩至五十五兩、針眉秀眉等項、昨市均無大宗交易、祁門紅茶、銷路亦頗呆滯云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　客帮仍未開裝</h3>
<p>疋頭市面、昨日趨勢仍平、惟報關業依然罷工、故人心稍軟、蓋直貢呢直貢緞等嗣後銷路已屬有限、若再延不解决、裝去難以應市、故昨日漢口沙市等帮、前所成交者退去有一百餘件、但一部份客帮已由行家直接運往、漂布因時届當令、昨日略漲、郭子儀爲十三兩、定福君三市十一兩八錢半、福壽三星十一兩二錢半、本街頗有成交、白縐布日漸活動、昨銅判開四兩三錢半、莫干山四兩二錢、焦葉題書馬戲四兩一錢七分半、花直貢呢靜極思動、兼之存底空虚、故頗堅挺、七子開三錢七分半、兒孫福三錢七分、印花麻紗到貨日多大都售二錢六分、條子府綢現貨見缺、楊貴妃三錢七分七厘半、湖心亭三錢七分半、清官鏡三錢七分二厘半云、</p>

<h3>五金東白鐵軋缺大漲</h3>
<p>東白鐵近來交易大有雨後春草之勢、如長江路之採辦、内地帮之收買、在在均有鉅數去路、而進口則不多、因是供不敷求、人心鞏固、標準有欣欣向榮之槪、連日大阪消息、謂東洋廠家所出之貨、統被印度購去等云、致日風訉嚴緊、市氣更固、昨市每張因之漲起三四分不一、計六尺估一兩零八分、七尺一兩二錢七分、聞在後之購買者仍多、市價仍看漲風也、</p>
<h3>白鐵瓦走銷爽快</h3>
<p>近日白鐵瓦生意異常與旺、如客帮建築等均有機良好胃口、而鐵道部等亦有收買之訉、所以人心鞏固、走勢爽快、故行情有欣欣向榮之勢、刻市二十四號售十五兩七錢半、二十六號十六兩、二十八號十七兩、</p>
<h3>會司鐵軋缺飛漲</h3>

<h3>Negotiations to Recover Legal Rights</h3>
<p>The Focus of the Dispute</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Three Countries Has Changed Slightly</p>
<p>French Envoy Welile Arrives in Beijing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain important figure, the outstanding points that Britain, the United States, and France insist on regarding the abolition of consular jurisdiction are as follows: (1) Civil and criminal lawsuits in which foreigners are defendants within the concessions will not be under the jurisdiction of Chinese courts for the time being. (2) New-style courts to replace consular courts will employ foreign legal experts as advisors. When Chinese judges cannot guarantee fair treatment of the lives and property of foreigners, foreign advisors will have the power to exercise the functions of judges. (3) When the prisons in major Chinese cities are improved to be the same as the prison systems of various countries, the detention of foreigners will be generally transferred to Chinese prisons. Our country believes that consular jurisdiction must be completely abolished. (A) Cases involving foreigners and foreigners and Chinese-foreign litigation within the concessions are not allowed to be excepted. (B) New-style courts will be added in about 20 places, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Kunming, Minhou, Ba County, Liaoning, and the Special Zone of Eastern Provinces, to handle civil and criminal lawsuits in which foreigners are defendants. (C) Foreign legal experts will be hired as advisors in the new-style courts, but they must not have the authority of judges. When necessary, they can only submit opinions in writing. The above points are the focus of the dispute between the two sides. If the countries sincerely interact with each other, it will not be difficult to negotiate a satisfactory outcome for the abolition of consular jurisdiction within the next two weeks. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The UK, France, and the US have changed their attitudes slightly towards the government's automatic declaration of the recovery of legal rights, fearing that the situation will become僵hardened afterwards, and have indicated that they can discuss it further. According to diplomatic circles, the crux of legal rights is in the United States. If Envoy Wu obtains results in negotiations in the United States, the other five countries will be easily resolved, because the United States is the main country of the Washington Conference. If the United States can take into account China's friendship and implement abandonment, then other countries will not be able to use the report of the Washington Conference judicial investigation as an excuse. The people of the country should pay attention to the situation of Sino-US legal rights negotiations. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Provincial Reorganization Committee telegraphed the Central Government on the 14th, adopting decisive measures on legal rights, announcing the abolition, and telegraphing to the whole country to advocate for it. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that the Netherlands, Brazil, and Norway have agreed to discuss the measures after the abolition of legal rights, and there are no problems. Regarding negotiations with the United States, Ambassador to the United States Wu Chaoshu is in contact with US Secretary of State Stimson and has decided to reopen negotiations. Regarding negotiations with the United Kingdom, the final answer of the British government was brought to Beijing by British Counselor Tykman on the morning of the 14th. British Ambassador Lampson can arrive in Beijing on the 18th to continue discussing the points that have not been agreed upon. Regarding negotiations with France, French Ambassador Welile arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 14th and had a thorough consultation with Wang Zhengting. France has the most circuitous attitude, and the United Kingdom also has one or two points that have not yet been agreed upon. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that after the French ambassador arrived in Beijing this morning, he has not yet met with Foreign Minister Wang. The UK and France have also not put forward answers to legal rights recently.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Wakatsuki cabinet of Japan has now been realized again. Looking at the list of cabinet members, only the three ministers of the Army, Commerce and Industry, and Colonial Affairs have changed. Among these three people, it seems that the resignation of Army Minister Ugaki is the most important. However, Ugaki's resignation did not start today. He had already resigned firmly last year due to illness and recommended General Minami to succeed him. Later, the government majority argued that at this time, the government was right after a dispute with the Navy, and resignation was feared to be used by the opposition party. Therefore, everyone tried their best to persuade him to stay, and Ugaki had to reluctantly do so. Now he resigned on the occasion of the reorganization, which shows that the change of the Army Minister's seat has nothing to do with the political situation. It can also be seen that the Wakatsuki cabinet this time follows the old model of the Hamaguchi cabinet, and will not change it if it is not necessary. Yesterday, Wakatsuki gave a speech at a joint reception for members of both houses, saying that Hamaguchi's recovery is not far away, and the party can welcome the famous president again. All parties in Japan attach great importance to this speech. However, in our opinion, Hamaguchi is only expressing his humility and his intention not to make many changes, and there is no other far-reaching meaning. We believe that after the formation of the new cabinet today, the first thing the party should pay attention to is the attitude of the enemy party. The Seiyukai has not yet made any expression on the Wakatsuki cabinet. If the Seiyukai does not have a drastic opposition, or someone will mediate and reverse the previous competitive attitude, then the Japanese political situation may be able to live in peace for a while, and the Wakatsuki cabinet can be expected to achieve a small degree of prosperity. Otherwise, at this time of domestic and international troubles, even if Wakatsuki's skills are clever, it will not be easy to deal with.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Banking Community Underwrites the Haihe Public Bonds</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Haihe Public Bonds worth 4 million yuan, excluding 800,000 yuan for drawing lots and 300,000 yuan for offsetting loans, and the remaining 2.9 million yuan, have been in contact with the banking community for underwriting methods in recent days. Initially, the banking community opposed Article 7 of the underwriting contract, which originally stipulated that when necessary, in order to protect public funds, the committee or custodian can withdraw the deposited bonds or funds and deposit them in other banks. After the Haihe Reorganization Committee revised the text, the underwriting bank should report the bond ticket number to the committee for filing if it resells the public bonds to other banks, and the funds that it should deposit will be transferred to the agency in charge of repaying the principal and interest for safekeeping. The Bankers Association held a meeting on the afternoon of the 14th and agreed to the revised articles, and allocated the number of bonds to be underwritten as follows: Bank of China and Bank of Communications 1 million each, Yanye Bank, China South Bank, Jin City Bank, Dalu Bank 1 million each, Sino-French Bank, Industry and Commerce Bank 700,000, Hebei 200,000.

<p>[Japanese Allied Press, Tokyo, 14th] At 4:30 PM, Wakatsuki, Minami, Hara, Sakurauchi, and others again visited the Emperor. The Emperor first bestowed a decree of appointment on Wakatsuki, and then performed the appointment ceremony for the three ministers: Minami, Sakurauchi, and Hara. The new Wakatsuki Cabinet was thus established. Shidehara, Egi, Adachi, and other ministers were retained, and their resignations were returned. Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi, Minister of the Army Ugaki Kazushige, Minister of Commerce and Industry Tawarada Sunaoichi, and Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda Genji, were all permitted to resign. The Emperor will grant former Prime Minister and Minister of State Hamaguchi and Ugaki the treatment befitting former officials.</p>
<p>[Japanese Allied Press, Tokyo, 14th] After the inauguration ceremony, the first cabinet meeting decided to appoint Takahashi Morio as the Superintendent-General of Police and Tsugita Daizaburo as the Director of the Police Affairs Bureau. Superintendent-General of Police Maruyama Tsurukichi and Director of the Police Affairs Bureau Otsuka Koremasa were permitted to resign.</p>
<p>[Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] When Wakatsuki delivered a speech yesterday at a joint reception for members of both houses of parliament and civil administration councillors, he strongly praised the outstanding personality and strength of the former Prime Minister Hamaguchi, and continued by saying that Mr. Hamaguchi's health will recover, and the day when everyone welcomes Prime Minister Hamaguchi again is definitely not far off; he is only temporarily taking office. All parties attach great importance to Wakatsuki's remarks.</p>
<p>[I&gt;Wakatsuki: One Hundred Aspects of a New Era&lt;I]</p>
<p>[Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The giants of the Japanese financial world offered the following criticisms of the formation of the Wakatsuki cabinet: Go Seinosuke: "It is very appropriate to have Wakatsuki, who is most knowledgeable in finance, deal with the difficult financial situation. The economic world is most afraid of rapid changes, so economic policies should follow those of the previous cabinet, so the financial world will not change much either." Kushida Manzo: "This is not the time for fundamental changes in the policies of the previous cabinet, and a tight fiscal policy will definitely continue." Fujiwara Ginjiro: "It is most opportune for Wakatsuki to form a cabinet. He should not be bound by past policies and should come up with new economic policies to save the stagnant industrial world." Fujiyama Raita: "Wakatsuki will definitely be able to carve out a path for the shrinking industrial world, and I hope he will give full consideration to the congested overseas development," etc.</p>
<p>[Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Kuhara Fusanosuke, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, criticized the formation of the new cabinet, saying, "Even if the Wakatsuki cabinet is established, the political situation and the people's hearts will still be unstable. The realization of the Wakatsuki cabinet is a perverse way in party politics. Policy flaws can easily replace the leader to maintain power, and it is ultimately difficult to expect the realization of responsible politics. Only a small number of bankers and wealthy people welcome the Wakatsuki cabinet. The majority of the people are cursing the reappearance of the Minseitō cabinet."</p>
<h3>Provinces in Spain Rise Up and Declare Republic</h3>
<p>The Imperial System is Fundamentally Shaken</p>
<p>The People Rejoice Madly</p>
<p>The Republican Party Forms a Shadow Cabinet</p>
<p>The Current Government Will Be Forced to Withdraw</p>
<p>[Reuters, San Sebastian, 14th] Eibar, the industrial center of the province of San Sebastian, Spain, declared a republic this morning. The republican flag has been raised over the city hall, and city council members have notified the governor that all city councils in the province have been ordered to take over the administrative agencies, and intend to request that cities where the Republican Party holds a majority also do so.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 14th] Provinces such as Barcelona have declared a republic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 14th] The cabinet has urged the King of Spain to convene a popularly elected assembly to determine the form of the national constitution. The Prime Minister then announced that the cabinet had not resigned, but this move is tantamount to indicating its intention to withdraw.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 14th] (Everyone here seems to have become a republican overnight.) As Prime Minister Asnar said last night, the scene in the whole city last night was as great as when London received news of the relief of Mafeking in the past. Madrid in ordinary times, even during the most fanatical festivals, is not enough to compare with last night. As the excited crowds surged in demonstration, mounted militias lined the roads, enjoying the spectacle. The cafe bands all played the Marseillaise. When the marching teams passed through the streets, people from the cafes and cinemas all went out to join them, men and women danced hand-in-hand in the streets, and sang the Marseillaise revolutionary song. The marchers gathered in front of the Republican Party newspaper office singing and dancing, and the staff in the office came out to respond, and occasionally embraced members of the militia standing in the road. Many cars, with speakers standing on them, joined the march and gave endless speeches along the way. One car carried a young woman, all dressed in red, waving a red flag. As dawn broke, the marchers passed through Alcalá Street and encountered a militia team in front of the post office. The marchers cheered at the militia, who first blew bugles to give a warning, and then raised their rifles and fired into the crowd. Men and women were all thrown into confusion and scattered in all directions, and hats, clothes, money bags, and other objects were abandoned on the road in countless numbers, making it difficult to take a step, and difficult to move quickly. Several people fell to the ground in response to the gunshots, and several others were seriously injured. It was seen that a German doctor in a tram was shot and fell. The militia did this apparently because they misunderstood that the crowd was heading to the British Embassy, because, according to rumors, the King of Spain's family is currently sheltering in the embassy. This morning, everyone in Spain is asking what Alfonso is going to do. The last days of the King of Spain have arrived, but the King is known for his courage, so he may not be frightened away. This morning, the King is in the palace waiting for the Prime Minister to report the results of last night's cabinet meeting. It is heard that the cabinet members had divergent opinions during the meeting, with three expressing the opinion that the King should abdicate, while the rest advocated that the King should insist on fighting the People's Party to the end. Zamora has already been the candidate for president in the eyes of the Republican Party. Those who signed the declaration of revolution last December gathered at Chai's residence last night, and it is heard that they have formed a (shadow cabinet). The unions are currently extremely excited. Reform Party leader Aredale and other politicians have previously advocated convening a popularly elected assembly after the general election to resolve whether Spain should be rebuilt as a republic or retain the imperial system. Now they say that this approach is meaningless, because the whole country has now expressed its desire, and there is no need to do this anymore. El Sol reported that the whole country has made a firm judgment, that is, whoever attempts to restore the dictatorship is committing a heinous crime. The argument of the imperialists is that the Spanish imperial system has lasted for twelve centuries, and it is not appropriate to end it vaguely, and it should be decided by the parliament. What can be noted now is that in this election, on paper the imperialists claim victory, winning 22,130 seats in total, while the Republican Party only won 5,875 seats. However, in reality, the areas where the imperialists won are all rural towns and villages, with few residents, and controlled by local tyrants. The Republican Party has an advantage in the cities. Catalan leader Compo and Catalan Governor Puolos are now rushing from Barcelona to the capital. According to reliable but unconfirmed sources, the royal family, apart from King Alfonso, left the capital by special train at 7:00 AM this morning to Valencia.</p>
<p>[National News Agency, Madrid, 14th] The political situation is still cloudy, and a thunderstorm is about to strike. The future of the imperial system is in imminent danger. Judging from this morning's situation, Tuesday will be the day to decide its fate, or the King of Spain will abdicate to the Crown Prince, so that the imperialists can make a final struggle to save the dynasty. The King said to his close associates last night that since the people of the country are not happy with him, it is useless to linger any longer. He is prepared to eat the fruits of the election. This news was transmitted by a semi-official source and is highly valued by the outside world. However, even if the King abdicates at this time, it is still extremely difficult to say whether he can save the last days of the dynasty. Senator Zamora repeatedly declared today that the republican movement will not compromise and will fight until the King and his descendants abdicate unconditionally. The Republican Party has now formed its own cabinet, which is located in Chai's house. In the future,</p>

<h3>Second Sheet</h3>
<p>If a republican government is established, Zamora will probably become the head of state.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 13th] The Spanish cabinet met for a long time today and has approximately decided to resign. A cabinet member firmly denied that the cabinet had discussed the question of the King's abdication, and said that the cabinet's decision would be submitted to the King tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 13th] In the Spanish municipal elections, the Republican Party has won a great victory. A number of Republican Party members have now published an article in the newspaper, saying that if those in power do not heed the lessons of the past, then we Republican Party members are willing to undertake the work of restoring the Spanish Republic and bear full responsibility to the country and the country. The person who published this article is the person who signed and issued the declaration to reform and establish the republic last December. The public intends that this article is aimed at King Alfonso, and a certain newspaper claims that the King talked to a certain cabinet member, saying that the purpose of the people of the country voting for the Republican Party is concentrated on the King alone, so he thinks that he should make this matter have a clear and practical solution. According to the election results, 974 Republicans were elected and 578 imperialists were elected. Even the Republicans also recognize this victory as unexpected. [National News Agency, Madrid, 13th] The Spanish government has not yet made any statement on the current situation, and the Prime Minister only said that the country is now in the process of an important period. The Republican Party and the Socialist Party have issued a declaration stating that if the government does not withdraw in accordance with the will of the people, they will take revolutionary measures to achieve the purpose indicated by this general election. Before the declaration was issued, all parties had expected there would be intense language, but it was unexpected that they would openly express their willingness to use force to replace the current monarchy, so they were quite surprised and uneasy.</p>

<h3>Mo Dehui After Arriving in Russia</h3>
<p>Met with Karakhan Three Times</p>
<p>Formal Meeting Still Faces Difficulties</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Mo Dehui arrived in the Russian capital on the 28th of last month. When the special train arrived in Moscow at 4 PM that day, dozens of key personnel from the Soviet Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation, such as Litvinov and Karakhan, were at the station to welcome him. There were also many members of the public and newspaper reporters present. Approximately one hundred overseas Chinese residing in Moscow, holding welcome flags, enthusiastically participated in the welcome. Mr. Mo instructed the commissioners and staff who were fluent in Russian to reside in private residences, while those who were not fluent in Russian would stay at the delegation's office. That evening, at 7 PM, the Soviet Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation jointly hosted a banquet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Mo and all commissioners and staff were invited. During the banquet, Litvinov and Karakhan each gave speeches, and Mr. Mo gave a formal reply. The banquet ended around 10 PM. On the 29th, at noon, Mr. Mo visited Foreign Minister Litvinov at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formally exchange views on the meeting. They spoke for a long time. On the morning of the 30th, he visited ambassadors from various countries stationed in Russia. At noon, he visited Karakhan at the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to discuss all issues and procedures related to the formal meeting at length. No results were achieved that day. At 6 PM on April 1st, he visited Karakhan again. Karakhan stated that if the preparations could be completed in time, the three groups would proceed simultaneously, and the meeting would resume at 7 PM on April 6th in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. However, on the afternoon of the 5th, just as the Chinese delegation was ready, Karakhan suddenly sent a specialist from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the delegation's office to inform Mr. Mo to postpone the meeting for several days. As a result, the formal meeting on the 6th did not take place. At noon on the 6th, Mr. Mo personally visited Karakhan. As a result of their discussion, Karakhan stated that the issue of resumption of diplomatic relations should be discussed first, and that the trade and Eastern Railway groups would continue their discussions immediately after the resumption of diplomatic relations group opened. Mr. Mo agreed, and it was decided to hold the meeting at 7 PM on the 9th. It was necessary to hold it at night for the sake of quiet and convenience. However, according to a Moscow telegram from another source, the meeting may still not be able to take place on the 9th because the Russian side stated that our specialist commissioners had not yet arrived, and the three groups could not proceed simultaneously. It is necessary to wait for a telegram from Moscow to confirm whether the meeting can be held tomorrow (the 9th). Because Qian Tai and Xu Jianping had not yet departed, Mr. Mo directly telegraphed Beijing from Russia, urging them to come quickly. It was said that Qian and Xu originally intended to travel to Russia via Harbin on the 15th of this month, but it is not certain whether this is true. Regarding this Sino-Soviet conference, the combined discussion of trade resumption and diplomatic relations is considered to be of great importance by the people of Northeast China. In particular, merchants on the border, who have more opportunities to come into contact with Russia, believe that now is not the time. The Suifenhe Chamber of Commerce recently sent a letter to a newspaper in Harbin, refuting this matter. It is transcribed below to show one aspect of public opinion. First, it is believed that Sino-Soviet trade resumption and diplomatic relations are not yet opportune. The only thing that the Soviet Union holds that can harm our country is the Eastern Railway. Since the severance of diplomatic relations, the only thing that has been officially prohibited is that Chinese goods cannot pass through Russian territory. However, Russian goods transported to China by the Eastern Railway have never ceased. Moreover, after the Soviet Union's change of government, the entire country's commerce has been reformed into a state-run system, with forced labor, lighter costs, and cheaper prices, which is even more likely to cause our merchants to be affected by its occupation, and there is no good strategy to compete with it in the market. Without trade and diplomatic relations, perhaps Russian goods will only be sold in the Northeast. Once trade and diplomatic relations are established, Russian goods will spread throughout mainland China, and the harm will be even greater. Moreover, communist propaganda will also spread throughout our China, which cannot be stopped by regulations and decrees. And the dignified mission is also a progress for the resumption of trade and diplomatic relations. Therefore, it is impossible to combine the previous one-sided trade and imprisonment. If not, we can only negotiate the redemption of the Chinese Eastern Railway as a fundamental solution, and demand compensation for the loss of posts and the return of the assets of overseas Chinese confiscated in Russia, the sum of which is in the hundreds of millions of yuan or more, which is more than enough to redeem the road. If the above two things are successful, the Eastern Road will belong to us, and then we will establish trade and diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The power of manipulation will be in our hands, and there will be no need to worry about the danger of guests deceiving the host. )) (April 8)</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Leaves Harbin for Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Wu Tiecheng, accompanied by his staff and secretary, left Harbin for Heilongjiang at 4:05 PM yesterday (the 8th). At 10 AM that morning, Mr. Wu was invited by Chinese students of the Sino-Russian Industrial University to give a speech (Industrial Salvation) in the school's auditorium, which lasted for an hour. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by Zhong Yu, the special envoy for foreign affairs. After the banquet ended at 3 PM, he took a car to the station and rested in the VIP room. At that time, many important people came to the station to see him off, totaling about a hundred people. At 3:50 PM, Mr. Wu boarded the train, which was the special No. 5 train attached to the Eastern Railway, after the third passenger train. After boarding, Wu stood at the door and thanked everyone. The third train was originally scheduled to depart at 3:55 PM, but due to a delayed freight train, it did not leave the station until 4:05 PM. The Special Police Department dispatched an armed security team to guard the station. Wu was originally scheduled to go to Heilongjiang at 4:47 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, but after receiving a telegram from Heilongjiang, he learned that Wan Fulin had departed from Shenyang on the 6th and would not arrive in Heilongjiang until the evening of the 7th, so he delayed his departure by one day to allow Wan to wait in the province to meet him. It is said that Wu will stay in Heilongjiang for about three days and return to Shenyang via the Tao'an Road on the 12th. When he arrives in Taonan on the way, he will get off the bus to visit Wan Fulin's mother, because Wan's mother's 90th birthday was recently celebrated. Wu will also pay his respects and wish her a happy birthday. On the 13th, he will return to Liaoning, and on the 15th, he will go to Tianjin with Zhang Xueliang. In the past few days, Wu gave speeches at various schools in Harbin. At 10 AM on the 7th, he gave a speech at the First Special District Workers' School, and at 11 AM at the First Women's School. During the speech, he praised Sun Guiyun, a female athlete at the school. After the speech, he invited the school's athletes to take a group photo. In the afternoon, he gave a speech at the First Middle School. At 4 PM, he visited the Yuqingde Woolen Mill and praised the blue wool produced by the factory, saying that he would promote it as the national police uniform material after returning to Beijing. On the morning of the 8th, Wu told visiting reporters that although the Harbin Municipal Party Department had been established, the National Assembly election was imminent. If various people's organizations follow the normal procedures, first apply for permission from the Party Department, and then establish, it would be too late. Therefore, at present, they can only directly present it to the official office for filing. The Harbin municipal party affairs will be carried out by the special commissioners in the future, and a plan has been generally formulated. As for the staff, they have not yet been assigned. Old party members are already qualified, so there is no need to re-register. However, the number of people in Harbin is impossible to count. In the future, a registration procedure will be required.

<h3>Shanxi Generals Arrive in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan, Fu Zuoyi, Sun Chu, and Zhou Dai All Spoke</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Shanxi generals, Army Commander Fu Zuoyi, Division Commanders Li Fuying, Yang Yaofang, and Feng Pengzhu; Road Protection Commander Sun Chu; Artillery Training Supervisor Zhou Dai; and Liu Zhaotang, representative of Army Commander Yang Aiyuan, all arrived in the east by the Beining Railway night express train from Tianjin on the evening of the 8th. In addition, Army Commander Song Zheyuan of the Third Army, along with former Shaanxi Provincial Government Chairman Men Zhizhong, also arrived on the same train. The train arrived at Shenyang Liaoning Main Station at about 9 PM on the 9th. Deputy Commander Zhang had received a telegram from Pingjin in advance and ordered the Adjutant Office of the Frontier Defense Headquarters to prepare for the reception and sent Yang Zhengzhi, the director of the Adjutant Office, as a representative to the station to welcome them. When Fu and others arrived at Shenyang Station that day, Yang, together with Guo Fuhuan, the head of the Public Relations Section of the Deputy Civil Affairs Office, and various adjutants, went to receive them. Pang Bingxun, the commander of the Independent First Division, who had come to Shenyang to pay his respects to Zhang but had not yet returned; Rong Honglu, the commander of the Jin Garrison; Zhao Chengshou, the supervisor of the Jin Cavalry; and Bao Wenwei, the newly appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff; and Ji Yiqiao and Fu Zhan Kui, two commissioners sent by the Northeast to inspect the Jin Army (Fu returned to Shenyang the day before), and those who had friendly relations with Fu, Song, etc., all went to the station to welcome them. After the generals got off the train and exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel, they dispersed. Fu Zuoyi stayed at the Liaoning Hotel in the commercial area, Li Fuying stayed at the Lingge Hotel on Sanjing Road, and Sun Chu, Zhou Dai, Feng Pengzhu, Yang Yaofang, Liu Zhaotang, the representative of Yang Aiyuan, etc., all stayed at the Frontier Defense Headquarters Reception Office on Sanjing Road. Song Zheyuan and Men Zhizhong stayed at the Liaoning Office of the Third Army. Song's staff officer, Qin Shaowen, also came with Zhu. Song had previously established a Liaoning Office in Shenyang, and the representative in Shenyang was Bai Fengyi. At 9:30 AM today (the 10th), Song was summoned by Deputy Commander Zhang and talked for about an hour. At noon, reporters visited Song at his office. According to him, he was summoned by Deputy Commander Zhang to come from Shanxi to Tianjin. Because he caught a cold on the way, his health was not good, so he stayed in Tianjin for two days. He did not come with Commander Fu and others from Tianjin until the night of the 8th. At 9:30 this morning, he was invited by the Deputy Commander to inquire about the organization of his army and discuss the method of giving salary in the future in detail. Regarding the organization of the Third Army, it should follow the Deputy Commander's instructions and decide based on the financial situation. The Deputy Commander agreed that the salary would be allocated by the Northeast, and the method could be determined within a few days. He originally planned to stay in Shenyang for a week, but the Deputy Commander asked him to stay for a few more days and ordered him to visit the Ordnance Factory and the Aviation Command. Regarding the fact that Yang's troops of the Jin Army were stationed in Fenyang, it was due to a misunderstanding by lower-level officers and soldiers, which has now been explained and there is nothing to worry about. Finally, when asked about Feng's going abroad, Song replied that Feng's going abroad would depend on whether the central government issued a strict order to urge him. He did not hear anything else. At 5 PM that afternoon, the reporter visited Fu Zuoyi at the Liaoning Hotel again. According to Fu, the army commanders, division commanders, and commanders of Shanxi came to Shenyang to pay their respects to Deputy Commander Zhang and report on the reorganization of their troops and the recent situation in Shanxi. Because they had been ordered to be under the command of Deputy Commander Zhang, they should pay their respects and ask for instructions. There were no other tasks besides these three points. Feng's going abroad is what the Chinese people hope for, and Feng himself also intends to go abroad and is discussing the procedures with Shanxi. At present, the troops stationed in Shanxi are all national troops and there is no difference. However, there are too many troops stationed in Shanxi. In order to reduce the burden on the people of Shanxi, it is hoped that the troops will be transferred in the future. As for the fall in Jin banknotes, it has greatly affected the livelihood of the people of Shanxi. Although the provincial government now draws lots every month to cash out 500,000 yuan per month, according to the total number of issues, which is more than 60 million, it will take ten years to clear it. Therefore, the people of Shanxi hope that the central government and Deputy Commander Zhang will find a way to provide relief and approve the early issuance of the Jin Banknote Financial Public Bonds, or they must find another way. He will stay in Shenyang for about a week and then return to his defense. Chairman Shang is unable to come to Shenyang for a while, and Shang has sent a representative, Lu Xian, to Shenyang. Commander Zhao (Chengshou) will return to his defense soon. The reporter also visited Sun Chu and Zhou Dai at the Frontier Defense Headquarters Reception Office. According to Zhou Dai, the troops under his command have been reorganized into ten regiments, each with thirty-six cannons. The organization is the same as that of the Northeast, and the two inspectors, Ji and Fu, have completed the inspection. They are currently stationed in Taiyuan, accounting for half of the total number, and the remaining half are suppressing bandits in the border area of ​​Suiyuan and stationed in the Jinan area. This trip is to pay respects to the Deputy Commander, report and ask for instructions. After staying for a few days, he will return to his defense to reorganize the troops. Sun Chu said that Deputy Commander Zhang had previously telegraphed to invite Chairman Shang to Shenyang, but Shang had to wait for the cleanup due to the accumulation of Jin politics and would not come to Shenyang for the time being. He will visit Zhang and visit various military agencies before returning to his defense, and Commander Fu may have to stay for a few more days. The five people, including Sun Chu, visited the heads of various departments and offices of the Frontier Defense Headquarters at 10 AM on the morning of the 10th.

<h3>Fire at Shenyang First Institute of Technology</h3>
<p>Total Loss Estimated at 400,000</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: A fire broke out at the provincial First Institute of Technology, west of Fengyutan, in Shenyang on April 11, burning down dozens of questions in the front building and killing one firefighter. The reporter went to investigate the situation as follows: At 8:00 AM on the 11th, when the students of the First Institute of Technology were in the first class, the yamen servant suddenly saw that the chimney caught fire and spread to the reed shed. The workers in the shed ran outside, and when they got outside, they saw that the top of the two-story building was in flames. They immediately telegraphed the fire brigades in the provincial capital, the commercial port, and the chamber of commerce. At the same time, they telegraphed the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital. After a while, Xiong Fei, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, and Jiang Peihua, the inspector, led fifty members of the Public Security Team, and Wang Dashan, the head of the Fourth Branch of the provincial capital, led fifty members of the bureau and police, to the scene of the fire to maintain order. Thousands of nearby residents, both male and female, stood far away to watch. After about ten minutes, the fire brigades from various places arrived one after another to transport water and rescue, but the fire was too fierce to get close. At that time, Zhang, the captain of the fire brigade of the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital, and Wang Tinglin, a member of the fourth team of the fire brigade of the Chamber of Commerce, bravely climbed the stairs. Unexpectedly, the top of the building collapsed, and the red light shot out. Zhang, the captain of the Public Security Fire Brigade, saw that the situation was not good and jumped down from the second floor. Wang Tinglin, a member of the Chamber of Commerce Fire Brigade, was lost in the fire and fell into the fire pit. When his colleagues worked together to rescue him, he had been charred. His thighs and head were completely burned away, leaving only his body, which was unbearable to see. By 10:00 AM, the fire was getting worse and worse. Twenty-eight classrooms and libraries in the front building were completely burned down. The Provincial Party Department, which was next door to the school on the south, sent many people to guard, and prepared water dragons and fire-fighting equipment, with strict precautions. Nearby neighbors also went to the roof to guard. The fire brigade of the Japanese station and the fire brigade of the Arsenal, and the sprinkling trucks of the Municipal Office, heard the news and mobilized all of them to come to help with the rescue. When the fire brigades from all sides were busy transporting water, unexpectedly, the water truck of the fire brigade of the Arsenal was driving south from Deyuanzhan Hutong, and the water truck of the Chamber of Commerce was driving from the north, causing the two trucks to collide. Yan Youde, the driver of the fire truck of the Arsenal, broke his left leg, and the driver of the Chamber of Commerce Fire Brigade was also injured in the arm. The water truck was damaged, and the crowd pushed it away and sent the two injured people to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. By 12:00 noon, the fire had subsided slightly. All relevant parties in the provincial city came to the scene of the fire to monitor. Fortunately, all the students of the school escaped and no one was injured. According to the school's workers, the school building was built more than 20 years ago, and the project was purely old-fashioned. The chimney had been in disrepair for a long time, and smoke and fire spread to the roof of the library. The neighboring room was a chemical laboratory, which contained flammable drugs, so it exploded. According to the school's professors, the total loss is estimated at 400,000 yuan. By 6:00 PM, the embers had not been extinguished, and the fire brigades were still continuing to work hard to extinguish the fire. (April 11)</p>

In anger, Bogen had suicidal thoughts and swallowed ten boxes of red phosphorus at Hua's house in an attempt to end his life. The Hua family noticed it and sent him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, where he was rescued. Recently, Hua Budan went to the hospital to ask Bogen to pay the 5 yuan treatment fee, but failed. He then sent Qian to the Public Security Second Branch Bureau in charge. The Branch Bureau Chief refused to deal with it on the grounds of debt disputes. Later, Xu Ruirong sent Qian to the hospital for recuperation.

<h3>Zhejiang Province is Unable to Bear the Expenses of Zhejiang University</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Still Requests the Ministry of Finance to Allocate Funds</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education previously agreed that, starting in March, the National Treasury would temporarily allocate 30,000 yuan per month to Zhejiang University, and the shortfall would be allocated by the province.

<h3>Shanghai Secondary School Basketball Tournament: Shanghai Jiangwan College Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>丨56 to 31丨</p>
<p>Shanghai Middle School and Guanghua Make-up Game Not Completed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Jiangwan College High School basketball team defeated the powerful Jinan High School basketball team with a score of 56 to 31, and won this year's Shanghai Secondary School Sports Association basketball championship. How glorious! The referee was Zhang Guoxun. In the morning, Shanghai Jiangwan College led 27 to 16.</p>
<h3>Conquering All Heroes and Becoming the Overlord</h3>
<p>Qian Jingyong, the left forward of the Shanghai Jiangwan College High School basketball team, is an outstanding talent who has risen in the ranks. His shooting is as accurate as shooting a willow leaf from a hundred paces away. Feng Nianhua, the right forward, is as light as a swallow. He uses both left and right hands with ease. Li Ruchun, the center forward, is tall and upright, and excels in both guarding and shooting. Lu Zhonghui, the right guard, has a family background and is extraordinary. Sun Baoqing, the left guard, is capable in both offense and defense, a leader among them. Others, such as Huang Xinmin, Wang Gongying, and Dai Zu'en, are all top-notch talents. With such talents, coupled with the guidance of expert Wang Jinpeng, they conquered all the middle schools in Shanghai and became the overlord.</p>

<h3>With the General Gone, They Succumbed to the Wind</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Shanghai Middle School's last strong opponent was the brave and skilled Jinan. Although their talents were generally inferior, their fighting spirit was excellent. Unexpectedly, one minute into the game, team captain Cao Xuexian injured his finger and was unable to continue fighting. With his spirit gone, what could be done? In the confrontation, they were forced everywhere. However, Han Zhenyuan's throws and Yin Guiren's defense were also outstanding. Jinan Score Sheet</p>

<h3>In Deep Water and Scorching Fire, Nothing Could Be Done</h3>
<p>There were more than 500 spectators, 19 of whom were Shanghai Jiangwan College students who came to cheer for the school team. As soon as the whistle blew, applause erupted from all sides, breaking the peaceful atmosphere and starting the great battle. In the center jump ball, Shanghai Jiangwan College's Sun Baoqing chased after the shadow, accidentally hitting Jinan's Cao Xuexian's hand. It turned to Yu Wencai, who scored and returned. Although Jinan opened the scoring, Cao Xuexian was injured and left the field, which was not worth the loss. In the next center jump, Shanghai Jiangwan College's Sun Baoqing made up for his mistake and tied the score. Jinan's Han Zhenyuan casually threw the ball, which went in and came out. The viewers felt sorry for him. Feng Nianhua raised his arm and scored another point for Shanghai Jiangwan College. At this time, Jinan's morale was very strong, but they could not penetrate deep into enemy territory. Yin Guiren had no choice but to make a long shot, which hit the mark, making the score 4 to 5 (Shanghai Jiangwan College leading). Shanghai Jiangwan College reorganized its lineup, and all five players rose up. Qian Jingyong cut through the lane, and Li Ruchun rose from under the basket, scoring two consecutive goals, and their momentum suddenly increased. After that, Jinan seemed to be trapped in deep water and scorching fire, unable to extricate themselves. In the first half, Shanghai Jiangwan College had 27 points, and Jinan had 16.</p>
<h3>From the End of the Road, Another Realm</h3>
<p>Re-energized, Jinan took the lead again. Within two minutes, Gan Zhenyuan threw the ball backhand and scored, and Yu Wencai shot in from afar. Hundreds of Shanghai Jiangwan College students were celebrating a smooth journey to success, but unexpectedly encountered danger halfway, which was about to capsize the ship, and were greatly shocked and looked around in horror. Shanghai Jiangwan College's athletes, with their mission, bravely took the lead. Li Ruchun's two goals and Qian Jingyong's one goal were quickly won. Then they turned their tears into laughter and were ecstatic. But Jinan's good times did not last long, and the good times did not return. Although everyone was striving for progress, the general trend had passed, and it was difficult to recover. In the last eight minutes, Shanghai Jiangwan College replaced its substitutes and was able to fight as desired. As a result, with a score of 56 to 29, Shanghai Jiangwan College won.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Football Friendly Match: Furen Lost to Jinan</h3>
<p>The result was three to one</p>
<p>Spectators shouted out of order</p>
<p>丨Tomorrow, Furen Will Play Fudan丨</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, the Furen University football team played a friendly match with the Jinan University football team at the Chinese Baseball Field. This was the third match since the team came south. Furen performed very well, scoring one goal against Jinan first, but soon lost two penalty kicks in a row, and as a result, lost with a score of one to three. There were very few spectators yesterday, and some of them scolded and shouted, and attacked the referees, which was very abnormal and should be corrected. The summary of the situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Jinan University Lineup</h3>
<p>Liang Shutang, Chen Bingxiang (Above)</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou, Fu Hexuan</p>
<p>Jiang Zongjin, Chen Jiaqiu (Above), Yang Baosen (Below)</p>
<p>Xie Quanhe, Lin Songfa (Below), Dai Linjing</p>
<p>Yang Baosen (Above), Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu (Below), Tong Rongwen</p>
<h3>Furen University Lineup</h3>
<p>Wang Yumin, Cui Yongxi, Dong Shizuo, Cai Zhanyun, Tang Guo, Li Fenglou</p>
<p>Ye Delu, Fang Gechun (Above), Zhu Fuxiang (Below), Li Hongye, Cao Yu, Zhang Zhizhen</p>
<h3>Jinan's Generals Were Not All Present</h3>
<p>Jinan's lineup, in the first half yesterday, was unusually weak. Defender Jiang Shanjing did not come, and Mei Bao and Luo Haiguang were also injured and did not come. Lin Songfa did not arrive until the second half, and the situation turned around. Yang Baosen's right forward was extremely weak and incompetent, like a breach in the river embankment, with the flood flowing continuously from here. Jiang Shanjing was also absent, so Furen was attacked repeatedly in the first half. In the second half, Chen Jiaqiu changed to Yang's position, and the leakage was blocked. The performance of the forwards was mediocre. The only ones worth watching were Dai Linjing and Chen Zhenhe.</p>
<h3>Furen's Loss Was Not Bad</h3>
<p>Furen's performance was very good, and the spectators praised them. It is no wonder that some people roared and shouted injustice for Furen's defeat. Although Furen's defeat was due to their own carelessness, the forwards connected very well, the center back was strong, the goalkeeper was also steady, and the defenders were the weakest point. There were many goals conceded, and the two penalty kicks were very obvious fouls. Otherwise, even if they could not beat Jinan, they could still draw. Looking at the whole team's skills, it can be said that they were not bad.</p>
<h3>Furen Scored First</h3>
<p>Referee Zhou Jiaqi blew the whistle to start the game. At first, Furen's momentum was unstoppable, and Jinan was in danger, which led to exhaustion. Jinan kicked off, and Furen's Zhang Zhizhen intercepted it and sent it forward. Ye Delu made a backhand kick, and the five forwards advanced together. Cao Yu shot, and Jiang Zongjin patted it out. Ye Delu passed it to the center, and Tang Guoliang caught up and shot from afar, but it was not far off. Afterwards, Furen was very good, attacking fiercely. Jinan took the opportunity to counterattack, but Dai and Chen were weak and achieved nothing. Twenty minutes into the game, Zhang Zhizhen advanced rapidly from the right, and the inside was empty. Feng Yunyou went to stop him, but had no choice but to deflect it into a corner kick. Zhang Zhizhen took the kick, circled three or four times, and Fang Gechun headed it. Jiang Zongjin jumped up and pounced on it, and center forward Li Hongye kicked it in. Furen then took the lead.</p>
<h3>Two Penalty Kicks</h3>
<p>In less than five minutes, Furen suddenly faced a major disaster. Fu Hexuan dribbled the ball and advanced fiercely. There was no one in front of Furen's goal. Dong Shizuo rushed to save it, but was too hasty and accidentally pushed Fu to the ground. So a penalty kick was awarded. Dai Zhongpu kicked it, right in the center of the goal. Wang Yumin pounced on it but missed it, and it became a 1-1 tie. Misfortunes never come singly, and Furen lost another penalty kick. At that time, Dai Linjing, Chen Zhenhe, and Dong Rongwen advanced together, and their troops reached the gate. Cui Yongxi came to save it, and his hand bounced up, hitting his hand. Dai Linjing shot the second penalty, and the ball went down and then up again. In the first half, Jinan took the lead with a score of 2-1. In the second half, Jinan added Lin Songfa, and their military strength was very stable. Fifteen minutes into the game, Dai, the center forward, made a fierce kick, accurate and powerful, and broke through the enemy's gate again. Jinan finally won with a score of 3-1.</p>
<h3>Spectators Shouted Out of Order</h3>
<p>Yesterday, some spectators, because Furen was penalized two penalty kicks in a row, shouted loudly and attacked the referees, and some even scolded loudly, which was very inappropriate. Penalties for violations are clearly stipulated and cannot be faked. Moreover, sports emphasize spirit, followed by winning or losing, and then friendship. Victory or defeat is harmless. The extremely harmonious spirit of the two teams, if misunderstood by a shout, then the shouter's love is enough to harm them. Spectators are not sports experts, and should not lightly add unfounded evaluations. I hope that in the future, they will be strictly reformed.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow, Fight the Fudan Team</h3>
<p>Tomorrow afternoon, Furen will have a farewell battle with Fudan University. The location is in Jiangwan.</p>

<h3>A Sad Record of the Public Memorial for Hu Liseng</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The 10th of this month marked the sixth anniversary of the passing of revolutionary elder Hu Liseng. Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, Zhang Qun, Mayor of Shanghai, as well as important figures in the party and state, old friends of Hu Gong, Zhang Puquan, Yin Zhufu, Li Genyuan, etc., recalling Hu Gong's revolutionary achievements, jointly initiated a public memorial at Wusheng Zen Temple on Chongqing Road and Montauban Road to express their condolences. Hu Gong joined the Tongmenghui at the age of seventeen and dedicated himself to the revolution, and was known for his bravery. Choucheng admired him and went there in the rain. What I saw is recorded below to express my sorrow.</p>
<p>On that day, the gate of the temple was hung with an eleven-character bamboo cloth banner reading (Memorial Hall for Mr. Hu Liseng's Sixth Anniversary). The ink was fading due to wind and rain. In the auditorium, a lake-colored silk streamer donated by Yu Youren was hung in the center, inlaid with the four large characters (The Spirit Returns to Mount Hua). On the side was a mourning couplet sent by Zhang Yuejun, which read (Thinking of the style for six years, how many times has the Central Plains changed); (A century of agreement, great achievements will remain between heaven and earth). On the table was a yellow paper spirit tablet, about one foot long and five inches wide, with red paper inlaid at the top and bottom, painted with golden lotus flowers and inlaid with the four characters (Buddha's Light Shines Everywhere). Below was written the phrase (Position of the late General Hu Gong Liseng). In front of the tablet were eight large and four small vegetarian dishes, and a cup of tea and rice each. There were also eight high-footed basins, each containing four kinds of fruits and dried snacks. Incense and candles stood side by side. Under the table were two large flower wreaths, with the names of Lin Shi, Ji Liang, and Si Zi tied on the wreaths. A name card of Zhang Qun, the mayor of Shanghai, was hung on one of them. In the side room, tea and snacks were provided on the left for the guests to rest. On the right was a registration desk, manned by staff. Because the initiators were far away in Pingjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou and other places, not many people came. It was heard that the arrangement of the venue was undertaken by Chen Zhishuo. When Hu Gong was the governor of Henan, Chen was the director of the Department of Finance and had a deep friendship with him, so he described Hu Gong's deeds in great detail that day. It was said that Gong was from Fuping, Shaanxi. He lost his parents at a young age and was raised by his grandmother. He had great ambitions and was angry at the corruption of the Qing government. In the first year of Xuantong, he joined the Tongmenghui and united with comrades in Weinan to plan a major uprising. After the Wuchang Uprising in Xinhai, Gong served as the commander of the New Army, responding in Shaanxi. He was only just over twenty years old at the time. After the success, he voluntarily resigned and went to Japan to study. In the second year of the Republic of China, he returned to China and was elected as the commander of the expedition to Mongolia. The matter was blocked and not realized. He then went to Japan to see the Premier and made detailed plans for military affairs, entrusting him with the affairs of Shaanxi. After returning to China, he made many remarkable achievements. He died of illness at the age of only thirty-four. Hearing this, I was moved. On that day, because Hu Gong's relatives and friends were few, there was no emphasis on formality during the public memorial. Everyone came and paid their respects as they arrived. Mayor Zhang arrived at the meeting at three o'clock in the rain, wearing a suit and a cloak. He took off his cloak at the entrance and bowed three times to the spirit tablet, with a look of concern on his face. He mentioned that there were not many mourners and sighed frequently at the desolation, and wished to take on the expenses of today alone. Among the elegiac couplets, the one written by Li Yinquan was the most poignant, which read (Feeling the past for six long years, the world is difficult and you have gone); (Returning to God beyond the three realms, I am ashamed of the loss of my close friends). It is said that Mr. Li has been living in seclusion in Wumen, studying Buddhism and not asking about worldly affairs for several years. In recent years, his relatives and friends have passed away, and he has been sighing about it. He was deeply moved by the commemoration of the sixth anniversary of the death of his old friend.</p>
<h3>A Warning to Those Who Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Since people are born, who can avoid death? Therefore, from the moment they are born, they will eventually return to emptiness. Death is not necessarily to be mourned, and it is not worth mourning. Buddhists speak of Nirvana, Liezi speaks of the benevolent resting, and the unworthy hiding. Our Mengsou said that dying is also being born. Jia Yi said that life is floating and death is resting. Therefore, those who are born into the world, and can rise above all creatures, even if they live to be a hundred years old, and are still mediocre, living a life of drunkenness and death, leaving behind this stinking skin bag, only to pollute the heavens and the earth, are also fortunate to be born. Our late teacher Confucius called them thieves. The reason for condemning them is deep.</p>
<p>Some Europeans hold the principle of sacrifice, saying that the world cannot be saved without promoting the Stoic school. Our Confucian school also has the saying of hearing the Tao in the morning and dying in the evening. It can be said that they arrive at the same destination by different paths. However, humans are living beings, and death is not reversible. If one has not experienced the world for long, and abandons the golden years with a youthful qualification, just to close one's eyes and decide to leave oneself in order to end it all, then even if one gets rid of the physical body and preserves the soul, what benefit is there in the end, even if the heart does not die, while the body is dead?</p>
<p>Our country is worried about the lack of talent in recent times, and is relying on outstanding talents of the younger generation to emerge in time and become a crystal light. But they do not consolidate themselves, forget their original intentions, and willingly sink into a long death, suddenly disappearing without a trace. Is there any difference between rotting with plants and trees and perishing together? Is it really that sorrow can hurt people and cannot be waited for a moment? Now, the changes in the emotional world are commonplace, and the waves of the sea of desire are never stable. Those who turn clouds and overturn rain constantly change their minds. They are everywhere you look. In the morning, they are phoenixes, and in the evening, they turn into owls. To cross the river of love and transcend the sea of hatred is not something that the mediocre can hope for. Therefore, know that human troubles come with our lives. Even in extremely unfree situations, regard it as a place to endure hardships and repent. Otherwise, only be sad and depressed, and gain the words "death by love". How thin is this self-treatment?</p>
<p>Alas, suicides today, whether male or female, are mostly young people. To avoid this epidemic, I say that these three essentials should be understood. First, one must be enlightened in thought. Second, one must be dissolved in material things. Third, one must be aware in psychology. If one can understand these three and add the effort of overcoming them, then human happiness and perfect good fortune will be seen here. If we do not encourage each other, but only see the empty shadows of kindred spirits on the beautiful islands and shores, and the short-lived flowers of peaches and plums on the jade terraces, and still say that it is the environment that forces us, and the situation that does not allow us, and we have no choice but to apologize with death, do not know that this is still self-inflicted, and what is the blame on others? This is why I cannot but repeat my words to blame.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Sheshan</h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Songjiang was anciently known as Yunjian, famous for its Nine Peaks and Three Mao Lakes. The Nine Peaks are Phoenix Mountain, Xue Mountain (i.e., Yu Ping Mountain), Sheshan, Chen Mountain (i.e., Shen Mountain, i.e., Xi Lin Mountain), She Mountain (i.e., She Gong Mountain), Ji Mountain, Heng Mountain (i.e., Hengyun Mountain), Tianma Mountain (i.e., Gan Mountain), and Kun Mountain (i.e., Xiao Kun Mountain). The mountains stand apart, like reclusive scholars in ceremonial robes, bowing to each other. Although they lack spectacular grandeur, their pure tranquility and delicate beauty have their own charm. Among them, Sheshan stands out for its beautiful scenery. Sheshan is twelve miles from both Songjiang County and Qingpu County, northeast of Lu Mountain and east of Shenshan Pond. It is eighty zhang high and eighteen li in circumference, surpassing other mountains in height and size. Legend has it that a person named She cultivated the Dao here and ascended to immortality, hence the name. During a spring vacation, I went there with a friend. We traveled by boat and, arriving at the foot of the mountain, disembarked. The mountain resembled embracing arms, forming a semi-circular shape, with a western and an eastern mountain. The western mountain has one peak, while the eastern mountain has two peaks. Entering from the western mountain, there are countless bamboos. The whispering bamboos and verdant bamboo groves cover the entire mountain. Further in, there is the Bixian Temple on the mountain. Following the path up, the main hall is long gone, only the side rooms remain, inscribed with "Qibi Mountain Cottage." The incense offerings are sparse and desolate. Descending and advancing further, we arrived at the gate of the Catholic Church. A statue of the Virgin Mary stands above the gate. Entering the gate and climbing the steps, we found the chapel halfway up the mountain. Looking down, there was a small lake shaped like an autumn leaf. Turning west, there were three small, scattered pavilions, each with a statue: one of Jesus holding a small child, one of Mary, and one of Jesus showing his sacred heart. Stepping back and further up, we came to the zigzag road. Trees were planted along both sides of the road. At each end of the road, a shrine was built, each enshrining stories of Jesus's crucifixion. There were fourteen shrines in total. The road led upwards, reaching the summit. At the top, a large cathedral was being built. Construction had been going on for seven or eight years but was not yet completed. The church foundation covered about an acre. All the foundations, pillars, and thresholds were made of stone, as smooth as a mirror, and various patterns were carved on them, combining solemnity, solidity, beauty, and unity. The scale of the project was unseen elsewhere. Inquiring of the workers, they said that it would take another two or three years to complete the roof. To the east, there was an astronomical observatory, where one could previously observe the moon. Now, the instruments had been moved to Xujiahui. Next to it was a pagoda, dilapidated and inaccessible, likely the Xiudaozhe Pagoda. At this point, the western mountain had been fully explored. It was midday, and we were hungry. So, we went down, settled under the awning of the boat, sat in a small skiff, and poured wine from our flasks. We also bought freshly unearthed bamboo shoots from a mountain family, cooked them in the stove, added a little soy sauce, and served them in large bowls. Everyone eagerly ate them, finishing them in an instant. The taste was extremely fresh and delicious, making us laugh at how bear paws and shark fins were merely overrated. After the meal, we climbed the eastern mountain. Looking around, the fields were arranged in rows, and the long river resembled a belt, widening our horizons. Descending, we walked west along the river. A huge rock protruded from the riverbank, where we could sit. The locals said that this was Chen Meigong's fishing rock. Across the river, there were several willow trees, their branches reflecting in the water like a net, with fish swimming in and out. Gazing at it for a long time, it was no less captivating than on the Hao River. In general, bamboo was the most abundant tree in the mountains, accounting for about eight out of ten. The other trees, such as cypress, elm, juniper, and ginkgo, accounted for only two out of ten. As for the Lingfeng Temple, West Temple, and East Temple built in the Song Dynasty, and the Zhaoqing Temple, Hui Ri Temple, and Xuan Miao Temple built in the Ming Dynasty, none of them remain today. Most of the mountain is now church property. I don't know who sold it at the time, which is regrettable. We sailed back at dusk. The companions on the trip were Gu Zaoying, Gu Zhi Zhou, the Gu Jinggao brothers, Cai Hui, Zhang Dezhai, and Fei Chenglai. I record this as a fleeting memory for the future.</p>

<h3>Lakezhou Travelogue (1)</h3>
<p>— Shen Xingchu</p>
<p>Huzhou, also known as Wuxing, is a place where towering mountains compete in beauty, and jade waters connect to the sky. It possesses a natural, spiritual essence. The Yousheng Travel Group took advantage of the Western Qingming Festival holiday to travel together and thoroughly enjoy the scenic spots and historical sites. Here, I record a general account for future travelers to use as a reference.</p>
<p>This spring tour consisted of over six hundred people, led by Ni Ziyi. A special train was arranged to Hangzhou. Forty-three people, including the reporter Zhou Shoujuan from this newspaper, the painter Hu Boxiang, and the photographers Zhu Shouren and Guo Xiqi, also participated. We departed on a special train at 8:20 PM on April 2nd and arrived in Hangzhou at 1:00 AM. We stayed in various hotels near the train station.</p>
<p>On the 3rd, we rose at 5:00 AM, washed up, and finished breakfast. At 7:00 AM, we boarded two long-distance buses at the train station and set off. The journey from Hangzhou to Huzhou was ninety kilometers, and the bus took three hours to arrive. The local branch of our group, along with local dignitaries, led Boy Scouts and the orphanage military band to welcome us at the station. We arrived at the Central Hotel at 11:00 AM. After settling in, we had a late lunch at 4:00 PM. In the afternoon, we toured the scenic spots in the city, starting with</p>
<p>▲ Qian Garden: Commonly known as the Lu Family Garden, it was built by Lu Xinyuan in the Qing Dynasty. It was also where Dai Jitao studied. The Chinese fringetrees are dazzling. The Nine-Bend Bridge and rockeries are particularly ingenious. Next, we went to</p>
<p>▲ Lotus Manor: The villa of Zhao Zi'ang in the Yuan Dynasty. The scenery is beautiful and secluded. It is now the Yang Family Ancestral Hall. Crossing the river, we arrived at</p>
<p>▲ Shen Family Charitable Estate: The former gentleman Shen Jingxuan made a fortune exporting rice, so he established the charitable estate. His son further expanded its operations. It is surrounded by water on all sides, forming a natural setting, with a platform and the Five Old Men Stones, among other wonders. Then we arrived at</p>
<p>▲ Silk Weaving Guild: The plaque in the hall reads "Ancestor of Divine Craftsmanship." We drank tea and rested briefly, engaging in lively conversation with a mix of seriousness and humor. At 4:15 PM, we arrived at</p>
<p>▲ Yi Garden: Commonly known as the Ding Family Garden, it was founded by Ding Naiyang. It is filled with fine trees, rare flowers, bamboo fences, and flower paths, making it the best garden in Huzhou. The layout is particularly neat and luxurious. Ten large paintings of "A Hundred Beauties" by Qiu Shizhou hang on the walls, which are quite valuable. It is not usually open to the public, but our group had arranged in advance to feast our eyes. Afterwards, we went to</p>
<p>▲ Park: The park is well-laid out. Inside is the Moyao Pavilion, built by Prefect Sun Jue during the Xining era. Ancient writings and inscriptions from within the territory since the Han Dynasty are collected there for reference.</p>
<h3>Indian Travelogue (24)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The weather turned cold at night, so I put on my Chinese cotton robe in the morning. The monks from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) who lived with me also caught colds. So did I. This is because the climate on the island of Ceylon is mild, unlike the variability of Jiacheng. I walked through the city and saw people draped in blankets, some yellow and some green. I thought these people were just carrying blankets home after buying them. But then I saw that many people were draped in blankets on their shoulders. I wondered why so many people were buying blankets, and why they were all draped on their shoulders. Upon closer inspection, everyone was draped in blankets. When I asked, I learned that this was Indian clothing. I was puzzled. One blanket is enough to cover oneself at night or to wear through the winter. But it is a pity that poor people on the streets are still wearing only a single layer of clothing, lying on the ground. It is truly pitiful. I have read the Biography of Faxian and know that those who promoted Buddhism in China were not only Indians, but also people from the island of Ceylon made great contributions to our country. Although Ceylon is an island, it occupies a superior position in cultural and transportation history. Therefore, I respect the Ceylon monks all the more and hope they will come to the East again to promote the Great Dharma. The Ceylon monk was reading a biography of Gandhi, the leader of the Indian independence movement, and urged me to read it. I felt that once I arrived in India, I was surrounded by Gandhi's aura. The Indians believe in him even more than they believe in Buddha. He is a person of faith who combines politics, economics, morality, and religion. It is important to study his outline and tell my countrymen.</p>
<p>On the 10th, I was a busy person and did not have time to read much. But Gandhi's biography was a thick volume of over five hundred and eighty Western pages. It was his autobiography translated into English by a student. I spent a day and night summarizing it as follows. Please pay attention to it, compatriots. Gandhi's autobiography does not need to be read. Just look at his photograph, and it is all clear at a glance. He looks like a beggar, with no clothes on top or bottom, just a loincloth around his waist. He can truly be called a true man. His appearance is also like a beggar, with not the slightest difference. Yet now he is the central leader of India's political, religious, and economic movements. Isn't that strange? In my opinion, the world's sages are often beggars. Buddha abandoned his throne to become a beggar. Jesus was not allowed to carry money and traveled from village to village. Socrates wandered barefoot. Gandhi is in their line, but he added a national movement, thus combining politics and religion into one. His autobiography is filled with Sanskrit words, which are not easy to read. The English name is The Story of My Experiments with Truth by Gandhi. India has four classes. The first is the clergy, the second is the king and officials, the third is merchants, and the fourth is farmers and workers. Gandhi belongs to the third class of people. His father was an experienced merchant but had no learning. His mother was a devout Hindu. Since childhood, Gandhi was influenced by his wet nurse, named Ramhan, who often recited the name of the god Rama.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Approaching Swap Period</h3>
<p>The gold market situation has recovered from yesterday's low. The benchmark price on the 14th recovered from its low, but there were no special changes in the situation. Throughout the day, there were only about five taels of fluctuations. No major buying or selling occurred among the various firms due to the approaching swap period. The morning market was slightly weak because the silver market had indeed reported a decline, but there were not many buyers, so people's confidence weakened. Afterwards, it rose and fell rapidly, hovering around 720 taels, with only two or three taels of turnover. As exchange bills, both official and unofficial, showed no prosperity, the market felt peaceful. However, as foreign exchange such as the rupee recovered, sellers in the market seemed active, and the market turned downward. Later, it was priced at 716-717 taels. This morning, the outlook is expected to be slightly higher.</p>
<p>The morning opened with a drop of 2.5 taels. The May contract opened with a decrease of 2.5 taels, at 719 taels. The broad market was only down by 1/16, while the price of silver fell by 1/4, and private telegrams were reduced by 1/4. The underlying support seemed strong, and various parties were unwilling to sell. Shortly after, it fell from 20 taels to 17.5 taels. When Hengxing and others sold, and British gold was being traded between various banks at 133.75 for June, and then Holland bought at 375, and Dadesheng, Tongtaichang, Cuichang, Yongchang, and others also came to buy, it rose by 4 taels to 21.8 taels at around 9:30. The British gold quotation remained unchanged, and some retail investors sold off, immediately reducing it by a small 2 taels to 19.5 taels. At times, it increased to 20.04 taels. However, the exchange market was very calm. Magalies quoted 3.125 for June, and Sumitomo offered Japanese gold at 1.59 taels, but sellers were active on the trading floor. Tongtaichang came out again, causing the price to drop by 4 taels. At 10:00, it was 16.5 taels. Then, Yongfeng and Yuanheng bought, and hedgers sold British gold. Huabi and Taiwan bought 375, so the price of gold increased by more than 4 taels. At 10:30, it was 21 taels. Subsequently, Yuanmao Yong and Guangbang sold again, falling back by 3 taels. At 11:00, it was 18 taels. Later, it went upwards as Wanxing, Shunli, Qianchang, and Xiang came to buy. After 11:30, it was priced at 20.03 taels. Physical gold was sold for hedging, and it fell back to 17 taels. By the afternoon close, it had been raised by one or two taels because Shunli and others continued to buy, to 18.5 taels. It was again about two taels higher on the trading floor. The quoted price was still 777 taels, down about 60 taels.</p>
<p>The result was a small decrease of 5 taels. The afternoon market opened at 19.5 taels. In an instant, the Indian exchange rate rose by a small two annas, and it immediately rose to 21 taels. Suddenly, Guangbang sold, and British gold was at 133.125, and banks were willing to sell, so it retreated to 19 taels. By 2:45, there seemed to be more buyers, and it increased slightly by 2 taels. By 3:30, it was 21.2 taels. Afterwards, the Indian exchange rate returned to a large one anna, immediately decreasing by 1 tael. By 4:00, selling pressure increased sharply, and Yongfeng, Longsheng, Yuanmao Yong, and others successively sold off. However, British gold and others had no changes. However, the consensus among the industry was downwards, causing the price to fall by more than 3 taels. The fluctuations were only about 1 tael in half an hour. By the close at 4:30, it was only 16.5 taels, a decrease of 5 taels compared to yesterday (the physical gold was raised by 5 taels). The highest price for the day was 20.8 taels, and the lowest price was 16.5 taels, a difference of 5.3 taels. The physical market opened at 20 taels in the morning, closed at 18.5 taels at noon, and was 19.5 taels in the afternoon, closing at 17 taels. The quoted price was down 56-57 taels to 60 taels. The registered price was 19 taels, with a water surcharge of 15 taels in the morning and 13 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Most of the transactions were swap trades. Hengxing, Shengda, Yuanmao Yong, Yuantai, Futai, Heng, etc. all sold, while Yuanheng, Fuchang, Hengyu, Dadesheng, etc. all had receipts and payments in substantial amounts. Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Fuyu, Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Zhenchangxiang all bought in. Cuichang and Yong slightly sold off. The physical gold had very complex inflows and outflows. Because the swap period was imminent, swap trades were necessary. In the afternoon, Zhenchangxiang, Cuichang, Yonghe, and Tongtaichang all bought, while Wanxing and Shengda had both inflows and outflows. Yuanmao Yong, Qianchangxiang, Botai, and Yongfeng all sold off, but the major players were not very enthusiastic. Guangbang sold a total of 1,400-1,500 bars, shorting the market. Dalianbang sold 800-900 bars and bought 500 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British, American, and Indian silver markets all saw slight declines, and British and American exchange rates also decreased. The British-Japanese exchange rate remained mediocre for a long time, but now it has suddenly declined slightly. The Shanghai foreign exchange market is quite calm. The HSBC exchange rate, except for Hong Kong, fell by five cents, to 78.5 taels, with nothing else changing. The domestic market exchange rates for British, American, and Japanese currencies were also calm, with very little change. However, the gold market was weak, fluctuating by about 5 taels, and eventually broke below the 720 tael level. By the close, the exchange rates were not much different from the previous day. As a result, British gold hedging had a difference of as much as 40 taels, which coincided with the gold price. Chinese gold firms that had previously sold British gold were significantly impacted when they hedged back. Yesterday, trading was not smooth at various firms, and the overall trend was to sell off. About 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Fuchang and others sold off, while banks such as Holland, Taiwan, Huabi, and Korea absorbed slightly. Mitsui, Magalies, and Huabi also sold. The afternoon was even quieter. Huabi and Mac line sold slightly in Shanghai, and various firms traded tens of thousands of pounds in the forward market in the morning. There were few transactions in US dollars, and the various Japanese firms settled more than 1 million yuan. Sumitomo, Mitsui, Huabi, etc. sold. In the afternoon, Huabi did a forward Japanese-American exchange transaction at 49.4375 yuan, which was reportedly purchased by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The British exchange domestic market had very little change. The morning offering price was 1 shilling 3 pence 3125, and the buying price was 375.

<h3>Cents Market Taking Advantage of the Rising Trend</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, due to the large volume of sales by the Hakka merchants, sentiment was exceptionally strong, resulting in excellent market conditions. In particular, banks made large-scale purchases, causing suppliers to concede and cent prices to rise sharply. However, the trend of silver was that, although there was demand, it could not be smoothly met, so the situation was still difficult to reverse. Additionally, the market price of the auxiliary currency, the horned dollar, was also firm, as there was also a way to spend it.</p>
<p>Cent Lending Rates (Silver Cents): The morning cent price was high due to unequal supply and demand, with buying sentiment being very strong.

The Guangdong small dollar was 6 qian 4 fen 5 li 1 hao 2 hu half in the morning and 6 qian 4 fen 4 li half in the afternoon, resulting in an increase of half a li compared to the previous day's afternoon price. The trading volume was 195,000 horned dollars in the morning and 45,000 horned dollars in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at 370 qian cash.</p>

<h3>Securities and Government Bonds Traded 9 Million</h3>
<p>Prices Trending Higher, Fluctuations More Stable Than Before</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot trading of government bonds was slightly better than before. Most bonds saw slight increases. The total trading volume was 32,000 yuan. The futures market continued to be active, with a total volume of about 9 million yuan. As for the trend of various bonds yesterday, although the market was quite strong, the supply and demand in the market were balanced, so the fluctuations were also more stable than before.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Slightly Improving</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm because raw cotton prices have increased, and sales of current yarn are gradually improving. Sales in North China are very smooth, and Sichuan merchants are also continuously buying. Therefore, the situation of current yarn is quite good, and there is hope for further development in all aspects. However, most people have a neutral attitude because there are still thick stocks of coarse yarn, so the selling price is difficult to raise. As for future yarn, they continue to short when prices rise, so the market situation is still loose and not tight at all. However, the major players have a firm attitude and have no intention of releasing their stocks. Even with good news, the market has not fully flourished. However, judging from the overall trend, there should be hope for an increase.</p>
<p>Human Mark Trending Higher: The human mark market opened with rising American cotton prices, and the current demand news was good, so the market atmosphere became tighter, and each mark rose by seven or eight qian. As a result, each mark rose by four to seven qian to one or two. The afternoon market was flat, with near-term contracts falling by three to five qian and far-term contracts rising by one, two, or three qian. The total trading volume was 8,750 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Progress</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upwards because American and Indian cotton prices are rising, and exchange rates are still unfavorable for long positions. Japanese merchants are also shifting their focus to higher prices, resulting in a tighter market atmosphere with more buyers. However, cotton factories are showing signs of easing up on spot cotton purchases. Nevertheless, inventories across the board are low, and sentiment remains firm.</p>
<p>Han Piao [cotton standard] is rising with American cotton. The Han Piao market opened higher following foreign cotton trends, with firm prices. Prices for each month rose by twenty to thirty qian [Chinese monetary unit]. The market atmosphere was slightly calmer in the afternoon, with fluctuations of five fen [smaller Chinese monetary unit]. The total volume of transactions was 21,100 dan [unit of weight]. It was found that Shen Chang sold 1,800 dan, Chang Ji sold 700 dan, and Yuan Feng sold 900 dan. The purchases included Da Feng with 1,100 dan, Gong Tai with 1,000 dan, Heng Yi with 1,000 dan, and Chang Feng with 1,300 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Overseas Cotton Rises, Yarn Weakens</h3>
<p>American Cotton Buying Power Strengthens　Yesterday, the American cotton market situation was gloomy. At closing, it suddenly turned strong due to short covering and reactive buying. Futures rose by 13 to 16 points, and spot prices rose by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 to 4 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. The Indian cotton market situation was firm and stable. Pingguoer rose by 4 rupees, and forward contracts rose by 2 rupees. Aomula rose by 3 rupees, and forward contracts rose by 4 rupees.

<h3>Food　Rice Market Firm in the North, Steady in the South</h3>
<p>In Zhabei [northern district of Shanghai] yesterday, over thirty ships arrived from inland. The special high-quality japonica rice [Geng] was rare and unaffected by market fluctuations. Ordinary medium-quality japonica rice sales continued actively, with many parties purchasing eagerly. Prices turned upward slightly, and the market gradually showed positive signs. Demand for thin [Bo] paddy rice was slow due to scarce supply, resulting in little trading and steady prices. Demand for Yang Xian rice [Indica] was mediocre, with only special grades showing firmness, while others barely maintained their original levels. Arrivals of Dubu Xian rice were slow to sell, with no upward or downward movement in the market. Arrivals of Bai Yuan [white round-grain rice] were met with sluggish wholesale and retail sales, resulting in overall market stability.</p>
<p>In Shanghai South [southern district of Shanghai] yesterday, around twenty ships arrived in the inner port. Sales in this district remained slow. Changshu and Suzhou machine-milled white japonica rice initially showed a shortage in the morning, but the market turned steady due to news of firmness from the north, resulting in no overall price changes. The southern paddy rice market was sluggish, with only a small amount selling, resulting in mediocre prices. Buying interest in Yang Mu Jian [Indica rice variety] remained quiet, with prices remaining high and steady, but with occasional cuts. The situation with Bai Yuan [rice variety] was still unfavorable, with demand remaining weak. Top-grade Bai Yuan opened at 11.30-11.40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Northern Merchants Trialing Guest Rice [Ke Mi]</h3>
<p>The market situation for guest indica rice [Ke Xian] remained active yesterday. In addition to Guangzhou merchants continuing their trials, merchants from northern areas such as Tianjin, encouraged by active grain sales in those regions, were also trialing shipments to the market. If transportation and sales prove profitable, they may continue shipments. Interest in guest yuan rice [Ke Yuan] was particularly strong. Northern merchants purchased 200 bags of Hunan machine-milled yuan rice at a price of 14.06 yuan, and 150 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled early rice at a price of 10.97 yuan. Guangzhou merchants purchased 71 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at a price of 11.22 yuan. Prices were similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Label Flour Market: Short-term Lively, Long-term Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed a trend of being lively in the near-term but steady in the long-term. Quotations for foreign wheat were also better by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. Overall, this naturally boosted confidence. However, due to different needs between near and forward delivery, there was some slight movement in response to the situation. Because customer sales for this month are still good, and the factories are now able to process current flour, most are adding 7.5 fen or 1 qian to the standard price. Therefore, the market atmosphere is naturally stable. The forward market has little buying or selling due to a lack of confidence, resulting in steady prices. However, if this month continues to be lively, the forward market may be boosted somewhat. As a result, this month was better by 1.25 fen compared to the previous day, May was 0.01 yuan better, June was unchanged, July was 0.025 yuan better, and August and September were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Market: Steady Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, generally presented a steady situation. Because quotations for foreign wheat were again better by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, those observing the situation tended to be stable. However, domestic merchants are observing that although wheat seedlings are weaker than in previous years, the season for new goods is approaching. With foreign wheat being imported in large quantities, factory use is not as high as in previous years, so most are observing, and buying interest is sluggish. As a result, this month did not open in the afternoon, but was better by 0.01 yuan in the morning. May was better by 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day, June, July, and August were better by 0.01 yuan, and September was slightly worse by 0.01 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Rise, Transactions Quiet</h3>
<p>Unified-Brand Ice Sugar Opening Still Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market telegrams from producing areas indicated that Cuban spot sugar remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for all months were up one point compared to the previous day. Java spot and futures were also unchanged. Transactions in the public market were scarce, but the market atmosphere was quite lively. Dutch No. 24. Sales of white sugar were quiet, but the market atmosphere was firm. Ordinary goods were at 10 taels and 0.05 qian, high-quality goods were at 10 taels and 0.055 qian. Hong Kong goods were valued at 10 taels and 0.0375 qian due to their lighter weight. The market situation was quite lively. Medium white sugar No. 20 was at 9 taels and 0.095 qian, and the market was relatively flat. Japanese sugar trading was quite active because demand from the north was slightly active, and the market gradually rose. N Mark was at 10 taels 0.0325-0.035 qian, YT Mark was at 10 taels 0.025-0.0275 qian, YRO Mark was at 9 taels 0.08-0.025 qian, YP Mark was at 10 taels 0.06-0.065 qian, and J Mark was at 10 taels 0.075 qian. Buyers were enthusiastic, and asking prices were raised by another 0.05 yuan, but importers were still cautious. Unified-brand domestic goods, Jiamai Brand, opened with over forty cases, at a price of 8.02 yuan. The market was brisk.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Dried Peach Meat Scarce, Outlook Positive</h3>
<p>Dried peach meat prices in Tianjin have been high recently, so there have been no arrivals. Although prices in Hankou are lower, spot prices are also not attractive. In addition, there are few goods en route. Based on current inventory levels, it will be difficult to meet new demand in the future, so prices are expected to rise. According to Hankou telegrams, the price is 41.6 taels, and after adding all external costs, it is higher than the Shanghai market. Yesterday's market price here was 45 taels, and the trend is stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Yellow and White Filature Prices Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no improvement in the silk market in the sunning port for foreign firms. The exchange rate was tight, and overseas telegrams indicated that silk prices were declining. Although American firms were interested in yellow and white filatures, their opening prices were still low, and sales were difficult. Yesterday, only Qianli and others imported 50 bales of Shanghai white filatures, and Xinfu and others imported 17 bales of yellow filatures. Prices were generally weak.</p>
<h3>Yuhang Starts Incubating Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>The silkworm season in areas such as Yuhang and Linping in Zhejiang Province is earlier than in the Huzhou and Jiaxing areas. In previous years, eggs were incubated around the Qingming Festival, but this year, due to the cold weather, farmers in various cities and towns have only recently started incubating silkworm eggs. Most of the eggs being incubated are of the Yuhang variety, and they should all be hatched before the Grain Rain Festival.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants: Legal Sales of Zhen Mei [Precious Eyebrow tea] Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson and Jinlong in the Zhen Mei green tea market received telegrams from legal sources indicating demand. As a result of continued negotiations, over 560 boxes were sold, at prices ranging from 48 to 55 taels. There were no major transactions for items such as Needle Eyebrow and Fine Eyebrow teas in the market yesterday. Sales of Keemun black tea were also quite sluggish.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Guest Merchants Still Have Not Started Loading</h3>
<p>The piece goods market remained flat yesterday. However, the customs declaration industry is still on strike, so confidence is slightly soft. The sales of Zhigong Ni [Zhigong wool fabric] and Zhigong Duan [Zhigong silk fabric] are limited. If the strike continues and is not resolved, it will be difficult to load and ship goods to meet market demand. Therefore, merchants from Hankou and Shashi returned over 100 pieces of previously purchased goods yesterday. However, some guest merchants shipped goods directly through traders. Due to the season, bleached cloth [Piaobu] rose slightly yesterday. Guo Ziyi was at 13 taels, Dingfujun Three Markets was at 11.85 taels, and Fushou Sanxing was at 11.25 taels. There were some transactions in this district. White crepe [Bai Choubu] gradually became active. Yesterday, Tong Pan opened at 4.35 taels, Moganshan at 4.2 taels, and Jiaoye Tishu Opera at 4.175 taels. The printed Zhigong wool fabric market was very quiet, and inventories were low, so prices were quite firm. Qizi opened at 0.375 yuan, and Ersunfu at 0.37 yuan. The number of shipments of printed linen [Yinhua Masha] arriving daily is large, and most sell for 0.26 yuan. There is a shortage of spot striped Fuchou silk. Yang Guifei was at 0.3775 yuan, Huxinting was at 0.375 yuan, and Qingguan Jing was at 0.3725 yuan.</p>

<h3>Metals: Eastern White Iron Shortage, Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Recently, transactions for eastern white iron have been booming like grass after rain. Purchases from the Yangtze River Road and merchants from inland areas are large, while imports are not large. Due to the supply-demand imbalance, confidence is strong, and the market shows promising signs. According to Osaka news in recent days, all goods produced by Japanese manufacturers have been purchased by India, resulting in tight Japanese news and a firmer market atmosphere. As a result, the market price rose by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan per sheet yesterday. A six-foot sheet was valued at 1.08 taels, and a seven-foot sheet was at 1.27 taels. There are still many buyers, and the market is expected to continue rising.</p>
<h3>White Iron Sheet Sales Brisk</h3>
<p>Recently, business for white iron sheets has been exceptionally good. Guest merchants' construction and other projects have created good demand. News of purchases from the Ministry of Railways has also boosted confidence and brisk sales. Therefore, the market shows promising signs. Currently, No. 24 sells for 15.75 taels, No. 26 for 16 taels, and No. 28 for 17 taels.</p>
<h3>Company Iron Shortage, Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a shortage of 200-pound company iron, while purchases from various merchants have been exceptionally enthusiastic.

It is reported that over 400 cases have been sold.</p>

<p>Naval Review is an Annual Event</p>

Director Li (Shijia) went to Fujian to report on naval affairs and returned to Shanghai on the Wuxiang commercial ship today. (2) Lin Zhong and others are still being detained in Beijing. Whether Lin and others are suspected of involvement in the June 1st coup is being handled by the Central Committee. The Navy has no specific opinion. Moreover, Lin and others left the Navy after the coup. The telegrams sent by the ship captains this time were simply personal requests to Minister Yang. (3) The naval review is an annual event, not a special event. The reviewing officers are all directors of the ministry, including Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department, Yang Qingzhen, Director of the Military Balance Department, Lin Xianxin, Director of the Ordnance Department, Tang Dexin, Director of the Naval Affairs Department, Xu Weixiang, Director of the Maritime Affairs Department, Luo Xuhe, Director of the Management Department, and Major General Counselor Ren Guangzi.

(4) The conflict with the China Merchants Electric Tramway Company will be mediated by Mayor Zhang, who will presumably have a solution. However, the specific steps have not yet been decided. (5) The Minsheng warship is scheduled to be launched on May 5. Construction of subsequent ships is also being planned. As for the previously rumored order for a 2,000-ton gunboat from Japan, as it requires over 4 million in funding, methods of raising funds and negotiating credit terms are currently being discussed, and bidding may soon be used to make a decision.</p>

Currently, Deputy Commander Zhou Hunyuan has gone to the front lines (Nanchang). Hu plans to take this opportunity to come to Shanghai, visit Commander Xiong, and seek a good doctor to treat his leg ailment. Four years ago, the area around the knee of Hu's right leg suddenly swelled and became painful, making it difficult for him to move. He took traditional Chinese medicine for two months before being able to walk, but still felt strained and sore when sitting or standing, and found it difficult to bend freely and inconvenient to ride a horse. Recently, he noticed that his right leg was thinner, with a circumference about an inch smaller than his left leg. Doctors advised him to take Guanzhong Velvet Antler, but it was ineffective. Yesterday, he telegraphed me (Li referring to himself), asking me to place an advertisement seeking a good doctor. Anyone who can provide information on the cause and treatment of the ailment should send it to the Garrison Headquarters (Li Dezhao) and I will forward it. Whether in Shanghai or elsewhere, Hu will go for treatment. Also, Commander Xiong's leg injury is gradually recovering, and he can now walk slightly without using a cane.</p>
<h3>Zhu Tingqi Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>

<h3>International Chamber of Commerce Congress: Chinese Representatives to Depart Soon</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Representative to be Filled Concurrently by Pei Sung-sun</p>
<p>The sixth session of the International Chamber of Commerce Congress is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., on May 4th.  Our country's representatives, Mr. Pei Sung-sun, Mr. Guo Bingwen, and Mr. Li Guoqin, with the exception of Mr. Pei and Mr. Li, are already in the United States.  Mr. Guo Bingwen, currently in Shanghai, has not yet departed.  As the meeting date is imminent, it is planned that he will embark on a ship within the next few days to travel to the meeting. Furthermore, the China branch of the International Chamber of Commerce previously submitted requests to various ministries of the National Government, requesting the appointment of representatives to join the attendance.  Apart from the Ministry of Railways, which has already responded that it will not send representatives, the association received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "To the National Chamber of Commerce Federation: Your telegram is noted.  The sixth session of the International Chamber of Commerce Congress will be held in the United States on May 4th.  This ministry has telegraphed the embassy in the United States, instructing them to send personnel to participate in the attendance.  Respectfully replied, Ministry of Foreign Affairs."

<h3>U.S. National Foreign Trade Convention Scheduled</h3>
<p>This Session to be Held in New York</p>
<p>Message from the U.S. Department of Commerce</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office in Shanghai has received a telegram from the National Foreign Trade Council in New York, stating that the 18th National Foreign Trade Convention is scheduled for May 28th and 29th in New York. The Council has been established for seventeen years, and this is the first time the annual meeting is being held in New York. New York occupies an important position in foreign trade, so it is expected that this year's convention will have more participants than in previous years. The Council's Chairman, Mr. Farrell, stated in a document announcing the convening of the convention at the Commodore Hotel in New York that this session will be a good opportunity to thoroughly study the economic conditions and operations in overseas trade. The downturn in world commerce is gradually showing signs of abating, so the turning point is imminent. It is predicted that the number of representatives from the Far East attending this time will be particularly large. All representatives participating in the convention must first remit ten U.S. dollars to the Secretary of the National Foreign Trade Council in New York City as a registration fee.</p>
<h3>Japan's Trade with China in Three Months</h3>
<p>Excess of Exports Over Imports: 6 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Japanese Commercial Counselor in Shanghai received a telegram from Tokyo stating that in March of this year, Japan's export trade was worth 96 million Japanese yen, resulting in an excess of imports over exports of 31 million yen. From January of this year, the export trade in the three months totaled 293 million yen, a decrease of 107 million yen compared to the same period last year. However, due to the reduction in imported raw materials, the total excess of imports over exports in the three months was only 37 million yen. In March of this year, exports to China were worth 23 million yen, so the excess of exports over imports was 5 million yen. In the three months of this year, the total excess of exports over imports in trade with China was 6 million yuan, a decrease of 20 million yuan compared to the same period last year.</p>
<h3>German Ship "Emden" to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Verification of Foreign Passports Not Postponed</h3>
<p>Director Chen Rejects Consular Body's Advice</p>
<p>Still to be Implemented Starting May 1st</p>
<p>The consular body in Shanghai, regarding the Municipal Police Bureau's decision to implement the verification of foreigners' passports upon entry into China starting May 1st, generally believes that they have not yet received instructions from their respective ministers and have informally advised a temporary postponement of the inspection. Director Chen, after investigating, found that this matter had already been communicated to the ministers of various countries stationed in China by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their information. Now that it has been decided to implement it on May 1st, it is not appropriate to postpone it, and he has sternly rejected the advice.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau's Solicitation of City Center Designs Ends Today</h3>

It is reported that as of yesterday, many designs had already been submitted, and today is the final day.</p>
<h3>Native Cloth Industry Requests Tax Exemption for Sales Abroad</h3>
<p>Since submitting a request to the National Government and the Ministry of Finance for tax exemption and transportation permits, the Native Cloth Industry Association in Shanghai has received approval from the Ministry of Finance to issue them. However, the association yesterday reported that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs is still levying customs duties on goods transported to the South Seas Islands, Hong Kong, Dalian, Andong, and other areas where unified taxes have not been implemented, causing renewed anxiety among native cloth merchants. Therefore, they have once again petitioned the Ministry of Finance, requesting that it instruct the National Customs Administration to order the customs and tax authorities not to create difficulties in order to alleviate the hardships of merchants. The reasons stated are: (1) The customs authorities consider the transportation of goods to Hong Kong, the South Seas Islands, Dalian, Yingkou, Andong, and Weihaiwei as exports, and therefore levy taxes. They are unaware that this native cloth is entirely purchased and used by patriotic overseas Chinese. Merchants are taking advantage of opportunities to reduce costs, with a long-term vision of hoping to regain rights. If imported taxes are heavily levied when transporting goods to other foreign countries, it is hoped that our government will do its best to protect them. How can we levy taxes again when the opportunity to promote exports is ripe and exemptions have been granted? This is something that should be considered. (2) Artificial handloom households are scattered in rural areas, and yarn is purchased piecemeal. How can they obtain unified tax certificates? However, they are entirely cotton fabrics directly woven after the unified tax has been paid, which can prove that there is no taking advantage of loopholes or false pretenses. A detailed study shows that the tax has already been obtained at the root. This is something that should be considered. (3) In the old days, there were numerous customs barriers, and transit taxes were always regarded as multiple taxes. However, this artificial hand-woven cloth only paid one or two wen per bolt when transported from Songjiang and Taicang to Shanghai. After completing one passage, it could reach Xiamen directly. After the prevalence of foreign goods, native cloth was almost completely taken over. The National Government decided to promote domestic goods and approved a national uniform tax exemption. As a result, the output of various provinces has increased many times over the past. It is implementing a one-item-one-tax policy. The government attaches great importance to people's livelihood. Before the association received the order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, it followed the resolution of the National Government to regard hand-made native cloth as a major domestic product. The supply and demand sides are mostly poor people. In order to promote domestic goods and maintain people's livelihood, based on the case of the 7th year of the Republic, a general tax exemption was ordered in accordance with the standard six rules to promote sales. The taxation agency has no power to change the established case of general tax exemption. This is something that should be maintained.</p>
<h3>Egg Export Trade Will Fail</h3>
<p>United States Implements Increased Taxes</p>
<p>According to news from the egg industry in Shanghai, the much-publicized U.S. tax increase bill will be implemented on the 16th of this month. As egg products are a major export of Chinese goods, concerning the national economy and people's livelihood, it is extremely important. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward to Minister Wu in the United States, urging him to seriously negotiate with the U.S. government directly. However, the U.S. government is determined to go its own way. The industry's American counterparts telegraphed, stating that the new tax of 150% ad valorem will be implemented to prevent the import of Chinese eggs. Therefore, the egg industry is quite alarmed, so it yesterday sent another letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to urgently telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging the American Minister to cancel it before the implementation date (the 16th of this month), so that the egg product foreign trade may not be interrupted as a result.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Three Silk Weaving Factories Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xiehua Resolved Through Coordination and Mediation</p>
<p>Yuhua Both Sides Insist</p>
<p>The workers of Xiehua, Yuhua, Fenghua, and other yarn weaving factories in the Hongkou District went on strike together on the 11th to oppose the wage reductions at the Xiehua and Yuhua factories. After the Social Affairs Bureau's persuasion, they all returned to work in the factories yesterday morning. The situation yesterday is recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Xiehua Resolved: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation committee at 2:00 PM yesterday to conduct mediation. Representatives of the capital side, Chen Yunming and Zhang Zhaoqing, and representatives of the labor side, Ni Longsheng and Wei Shouchang, attended.

After a long discussion, an agreement was signed: (1) The labor and capital sides voluntarily withdrew the wage reduction dispute; (2) The factory voluntarily closes down and will clear the raw materials from today, ending within 20 days; (3) The existing warps are to be distributed equally to union members and non-members; (4) During this clearing period, the union is fully responsible for the work of union members.</p>
<p>Yuhua Undecided: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened a questioning session at 1:00 PM yesterday. Representatives of both labor and capital sides attended on time. Zhu Guilin was the chairman, and Wang Zhichin was the recorder. The labor side argued that the wage of three li and three mills per foot was decided by the Municipal Government's arbitration, so it must be based on this regulation. The capital side argued that silk weaving factories with smaller scales in the Hongkou area only pay two li and eight mills, so they insisted on not agreeing. The chairman announced that the formal convening of mediation would be rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Airmail Can Use Ordinary Stamps</h3>
<p>Starting from the 16th</p>
<p>According to a message from the Shanghai Post Office, starting on the 16th of this month, airmail can use ordinary stamps. All previous restrictions requiring the exclusive use of airmail stamps will be canceled. However, the post office has specially manufactured an envelope, which will be sold at the windows of various post offices soon, specially for mailing airmail letters. The envelope is printed in the Western style, 11 cm high and 15 cm wide. The front is printed with two horizontal and two vertical straight lines in dark blue. Above the horizontal and vertical lines, space is reserved for affixing postage stamps. The word "Aviation" is printed between the two lines. To the left of the straight line, the words "(Airmail)" are printed. If the public uses its own envelope, if the design matches this regulation, it can also be used. If Chinese old-style envelopes are used, two black lines should be added to the top of the envelope in ink. The distance between the black lines and the top of the envelope should be about one-fifth of the total length of the envelope. Within that space, the words "(Airmail)" should be written. As for postcards, printed matter, and parcels, the wrapping should also be handled in this way. If these regulations are not followed, causing the item that should have been delivered by airmail to be sent by ordinary mail, the post office will not be responsible. Starting on the same day, the airmail postage payable on all airmail parcels will still be charged at 15 cents per item per 20 cm of weight, or any fraction thereof, for every 1,000 kilometers of travel. The style of the specially made airmail envelope can be seen on the notices at various post offices.</p>

<h3>Bai Zhiying's Drug Trafficking is a False Accusation</h3>
<p>Report of the Party Department's Investigation</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that Ms. Bai Zhiying, an employee of the executive director of the China National Drug Prevention Association, Huang Jiahuishi, was discovered to be transporting morphine by Hong Kong Customs. The news spread, and all circles are paying close attention. The 18th Sub-department of the Third District of this city, because Huang Jiahuishi is a probationary party member of this sub-department, bears the responsibility and must investigate the truth in detail in order to properly deal with it. At the 29th party member congress, it was decided to send four comrades to investigate. According to the detailed report of the sub-department's investigators, it is believed that the case is entirely a false accusation, and there are documents that can be used to corroborate it. The investigation report is recorded below for public evaluation. It is found that Mr. Huang has devoted himself to the drug prevention movement for eight years. In the course of the work, it is inevitable that he will offend all parties. The enemy's conspiracy was expected long ago. Recently, he has been particularly active in protesting the monopoly of opium sales. This time, he left Shanghai to inspect the situation of tobacco prohibition in Taiwan. Because he knew the deterioration of the situation, he kept it a secret beforehand. At that time, someone visited Mr. Huang, and his family replied that he had gone to Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, two days after he left Shanghai, there was news of this matter. It is found that the passport shown by Mr. Huang clearly bears the seal of the Keelung Police Department as proof. The date of arrival and departure can be checked. After Mr. Huang stayed in Taiwan for a week, he left Taiwan and went to Xiamen. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Xiamen, he learned that he had been falsely accused to the Central Government of transporting morphine. At the same time, a Xiamen local merchant colluded with his accomplices to board the ship, using assassination methods to prevent him from declaring his innocence. Unable to clear his name, Mr. Huang received assistance from a friend and temporarily avoided it in the Gulangyu Public Concession for a few days. It was not until March 29th that he took the Taiyuan Wheel back to Shanghai. He was escorted by drug prevention personnel from Xiamen before escaping the trap. With the assistance of various parties, Mr. Huang obtained documents and photos of a local merchant, surnamed Zhang, colluding with a certain doctor to conspire to frame him and his wife. There was also a letter from a certain female American drug prevention leader, Chen, about the opponent's conspiracy plan, advising Mr. Huang to be careful. After investigation and review, the documents can indeed prove the false accusation and will be disclosed and published one by one when necessary. In order to complete the Prime Minister's legacy of drug prevention, we do not want the entire drug prevention movement to be affected by the false accusations against Mr. and Mrs. Huang. Therefore, the truth of the investigation is announced to the public, and we respectfully ask for your evaluation.</p>
<h3>Technician Certificate Renewal Deadline</h3>
<p>Extended Another Six Months</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of extending the technician certificate renewal deadline by another six months, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the competent authority in this city, has already been ordered to issue a public announcement. Now, we have obtained the original text of the Shanghai Municipal Government's instruction to the Bureau of Public Works, which is transcribed below for compliance:</p>
<p>"By order:</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 1496 states:</p>
<p>Based on the report submitted by Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry, requesting leniency for those who have exceeded the deadline and for continued extension of the technician certificate renewal deadline for national compliance, according to Articles 13 and 14 of the Implementing Regulations for Technician Registration, those who obtained certificates before the implementation of the Technician Registration Law, according to the separate regulations for technician registration of various local governments, and those who passed the technician selection examination of the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in Beijing, should apply to the competent ministry for the issuance of certificates within six months after the implementation of the new law.</p>
<p>The Technician Registration Law was promulgated and implemented on October 10, 1929. The deadline for applying for the issuance of the aforementioned registration certificates has been repeatedly extended by the former Ministries of Agriculture and Mining and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, with reasons stated and approved by the Executive Yuan, until the deadline of April 10 of this year, with a declaration that no further extensions would be granted, and this has been communicated for compliance.</p>
<p>Now, the above-mentioned extension deadline is approaching again. It is necessary to strictly follow the provisions of Article 16 of the Technician Registration Law and notify all provincial and municipal governments that those who have not registered by the deadline but are engaged in various technical affairs by delegation should be ordered to cease operations and be fined by the competent authorities to uphold the law.</p>
<p>However, the domestic reactionary forces were only recently subdued in the past few months. During the military operations, in provinces and regions affiliated with the reactionary forces, such as Shaanxi Province, which lacked a provincial government organization, official documents issued by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce were returned unopened by the post office. In provinces such as Hebei and Shanxi, after receiving official documents, they were often shelved and ignored.</p>
<p>The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, regarding Zhong Sensheng's application for technician registration, consulted the Peiping Municipal Government in April of last year to verify the documents, and only on February 17 of this year did it receive a reply regarding the verification, stating that it had been delayed due to the military situation and was only handled by the Bureau of Public Works in November of last year when clearing accumulated cases. The exchange of official documents took ten months.</p>
<p>Based on this, it can be inferred that the official documents issued by the Executive Yuan and the former ministry regarding the extension of the technician certificate renewal deadline were not followed, which was unavoidable due to the circumstances. Those who obtained certificates according to the separate technician registration regulations of the Peiping and Tianjin Municipal Governments, as well as those who hold registration certificates from other local governments or technician certificates from the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce's technician selection examination, who were engaged in business in provinces and regions within the sphere of reactionary forces, were unable to clearly understand the renewal deadline, causing delays. This is understandable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, technical personnel engaged in technical work in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces were even more unable to renew their certificates due to the widespread turmoil caused by the communist bandits. Their situation is particularly pitiable. As for other provinces and regions that were not affiliated with reactionary forces or severely ravaged by communist bandits, those who were registered and certified by local governments to engage in business were often graduates of secondary vocational schools or had no academic qualifications at all, relying solely on long-term experience to assess their service performance, which was sufficient for social needs and satisfactory. However, due to their academic qualifications not meeting the requirements of the Technician Registration Law, their applications for new certificates were often rejected. Before the expiration of the extension period, the government had not yet taken measures to ban their business operations. Once the deadline expires, they would have to cease operations immediately according to law. This would not only make it impossible for the technical personnel who were forced to cease operations to maintain their livelihoods but also cause a sudden shortage in social needs.</p>
<p>The previous approval was given to the Executive Yuan's Secretariat's official letter forwarding a joint petition from Gu Daosheng and others requesting relief, and the reasons stated were similar. After careful consideration, the Ministry is drafting relief measures to cope with the situation and take into account the facts. However, the extended deadline is approaching, and the procedures for submitting the draft for approval, promulgation, and compliance are unlikely to be completed before the deadline. Therefore, it seems necessary to extend the deadline to seek relief.</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned reasons, the Ministry requests leniency from the Executive Yuan to continue to order the extension of the deadline for issuing certificates for technicians registered with the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and various local governments for six months to show the government's concern for the people's difficulties and demonstrate its leniency and generosity.

<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in order to solicit information on the plight of industry and commerce, issued a circular to the entire country, which was published in this newspaper. It is now reported that the Shanghai Tailors' Association has submitted a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating the plight of the industry and requesting assistance. The original letter reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Respectfully replying:</p>
<p>We received your letter dated [date] which opened with: 'By order: Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Instruction No. 7044, for compliance. By order: Ministry of Industry Instruction Shangzi No. 1215, which states: 'In order to implement Xu Peihuang's proposal in the resolution of the National Industry and Commerce Conference, it is proposed that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce announce to the entire country that each industry and commerce should list its own hardships, collect them for study, and devise ways to provide relief. Furthermore, the proposal of Ju Jianyang, Director of the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau, is to instruct the chambers of commerce in various places to inform the various trades and guilds to state in detail their business difficulties or successes, as well as their hopes for government relief or assistance. The chambers of commerce should present them for discussion at each meeting to promote commercial development.'</p>
<p>The above matters have been approved at the conference, instructing us to list in detail the difficulties of our industry in order to facilitate review. Upon receiving this order, our association sent letters to various members to solicit information on their difficulties or successes. In response, the reported areas of suffering are briefly stated as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The industry suffers from the weakness of domestic production capacity, which results in the need to import most of the required materials such as woolens, leading to an annual outflow of profits, which is immeasurable. Recently, the impact on our industry has been even greater due to the high cost of gold and low cost of silver. The government should devise ways to provide relief for the problem of raw materials.</p>
<p>2.  While it is appropriate to raise import taxes on foreign goods entering our country to achieve the purpose of prohibition through taxation and to conform to the policy of tariff protection, the raw materials that our industry urgently needs are those that cannot be produced domestically and must be imported from abroad, such as fine serge and fine tweed. The government should exempt import taxes on raw materials to provide relief.</p>
<p>3.  Currently, the import of foreign goods is initially subject to heavy import taxes by customs, followed by the payment of a considerable business tax by wholesalers, and then the payment of a second business tax by retailers. It is reported that our industry also bears the highest amount of business tax. If this is the case, our industry cannot imagine how to survive. The livelihoods of workers are difficult, and the government should devise ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are related to the survival of our industry. Therefore, we should send a letter to your chamber of commerce to request that you forward it to the authorities concerned and quickly devise ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Qian Chaofu Kidnapped This Morning</h3>
<p>No News as of 3 O'Clock</p>
<p>Qian Chaofu, a native of Anting, aged 30, is the owner of Yongfeng Lumber Firm in the Lujiabang area of the South City Bund. Qian newly acquired a courtesan as a concubine named Yue'e. He kept her in a gilded cage at No. 27 Hehe Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Qian had his own car, Concession number 1797, City number 1993. Every evening, Qian would take the car to his concubine's place, always returning late at night. This was his usual habit. Yesterday evening around 9 o'clock, Qian went as usual. It was not until 12:15 this morning that he was leaving her place. The chauffeur was starting the engine, heading east from Rue Bourgeat. As they approached the corner of Avenue de la Sape, just as they were about to turn south, four kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside, brandishing pistols. They first forced the chauffeur out of the car. The kidnappers themselves drove off, taking Qian away without a trace. The chauffeur immediately rushed to inform Qian's concubine, who reported to the Songshan Road Police Station. The chief officer immediately ordered detectives to investigate. As of 3 o'clock this morning, the car had not been found.</p>
<h3>Ye Jingsan's Account of Escaping Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Treated Well During Captivity Released Calmly</p>
<p>Ye Jingsan, a tea merchant from Anhui Province, was kidnapped last Saturday morning while passing near the garbage bridge on North Suzhou Road by two bandits who forced him into a car. They drove to a remote location, where they robbed him of all the gold jewelry he had, worth about 90 taels, and held him captive for three days. Around 2 o'clock yesterday morning, he was led out by the bandits and walked for about four or five li before escaping. His losses amounted to several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Traveling Between Shanghai and Hangzhou Ye Jingsan, aged 53, is a tea merchant residing at Shenyuan Tea Shop, No. 681 Jingxing Lane, North Henan Road, Public Concession. His younger brother owns Baocheng Silver Shop in Hangzhou. Recently, due to the high cost of gold and low cost of silver, he often entrusted Jingsan to sell gold jewelry at Wu Cangmin's Wanji Pawnshop on Avenue Edward VII to earn extra profit. On the 9th of this month, Ye received a letter from Hangzhou stating that there were gold ornaments for sale, so he took a train to Hangzhou that day and returned to Shanghai the next day.</p>
<p>Carrying Gold to Exchange Ye brought to Shanghai from Hangzhou this time, gold ornaments large and small, weighing about 89 taels. On the 11th, intending to go to Wanji Pawnshop on Avenue Edward VII to exchange them, he hid the gold ornaments on his person. Who knew that while passing near the old garbage bridge on the north side of the creek, two people suddenly caught up from behind and stopped Ye.</p>
<p>Kidnapped En Route Ye, seeing that the two men were behaving strangely, knew that he was encountering robbers and tried to turn around and escape. The two men dragged and twisted Ye away. After walking a few steps, they dragged him into a car that was parked on the side of the road, immediately started the engine, and sped away. At the same time, they blindfolded Ye with a cloth. After driving for about an hour, the bandits helped Ye out of the car and hid him in a small house. He was thoroughly searched, and all the cash he was carrying was robbed. (However, because he was blindfolded, he did not know the car number.) He was detained for three days and two nights, and the food and drink provided were fairly generous. Because someone was guarding him, his eyes were tightly covered with rubber tape. He did not know the address or any details about the house.</p>
<p>Shouting Loudly It was not until about 2 o'clock yesterday morning (the 14th), in the deep quiet of the night, that the bandits still blindfolded Ye and stuffed cotton wool into his mouth. Two bandits helped him out and walked for four or five li, tying Ye to a wooden electric pole. The limbs were tied tightly. The bandits then left. When the sky dawned, Ye spat out the cotton wool in his mouth and shouted for help. Soon, two women working in a straight factory passed by and saw it as a strange thing, not daring to approach. (That place is the Zhongshan Road area north of the Fanwangdu Creek in Western Shanghai.) They walked and talked, and when they reached the vicinity of Daxia University on Zhongshan Road, a police officer from the 2nd Security Team on guard duty heard about it, immediately went to the place, and indeed saw a person tied to a pole. He freed Ye and took him back to the team, asking him about what had happened. Unexpectedly, Ye had lost his mind and was mentally disturbed, seemingly losing consciousness, vaguely mumbling. Since there were no wounds on his body, Ye was released.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Police Station Ye staggered along the way and arrived at a bustling city, then hired a streetcar to return to the shop. After his thoughts gradually settled and he became a little clearer, he told the shop about the kidnapping and robbery. Afterwards, he personally reported the kidnapping and robbery to the Huisi Police Station in charge. After receiving the report, the chief officer questioned him in detail and at about 1 p.m. immediately dispatched a western detective and Chinese detectives Zhang Bingchen and Tan Haijin, etc., accompanied by Ye Jingsan, to the place of the kidnapping on Zhongshan Road by car to investigate. After confirming that the incident had occurred, they immediately took him back to the police station to await review. However, according to Ye, on the way to the hiding place from the kidnapping location, some roads were rugged and some were flat. He traveled a long distance, about two hours, so the hiding place was difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Female Student Ma Qiwen of Labor University Attempts Suicide by Taking Sleeping Pills</h3>
<p>Ma Qiwen, a female student in the middle school department of Jiangwan National Labor University, suddenly took sleeping pills to commit suicide yesterday noon. Ms. Ma is 20 years old, a native of Yunnan, who came to Shanghai from afar to study at Labor University. She has been studying for three years and will soon graduate. Yesterday at 12:15 p.m., she swallowed a box of sleeping pill powder. The school authorities were extremely surprised when they heard the news and immediately ordered the school workers to first carry Ms. Ma on a canvas bed to the school doctor's office for treatment, and then hired a car to send her to Guangren Hospital. It was already 2:15 p.m. The female educator of the school, Ms. Liao Lianfang, registered her for special treatment. According to the doctor, the woman was initially unwilling to speak when she came to the hospital. After being persuaded by a female classmate who accompanied her, she finally told the truth that she had taken most of a bottle of sleeping pill powder. Fortunately, the drug was slow-acting, and most of it had been vomited out. Then, lavage and enema were used to inject the intestines and abdomen. One injection might save her life.</p>
<h3>Verdict in Police Prosecution of Magic Troupe Case</h3>
<p>Two Lus Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment Each</p>
<p>Zhao Huiying Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Yu Huisheng's Bail Forfeited</p>
<p>The Spirit Magic Troupe organized by Lu Huilin and others invited women Chen Huifu and Wu Huirong, also known as Wu Aixian, to Tianjin to perform magic on December 13 of last year. When the troupe invited Chen and Wu to Tianjin, Wu Huirong joined privately without the consent of her parents. However, after the troupe arrived in Tianjin, Wu Huirong fell ill and died. When Lu Huilin and the other three returned to Shanghai, Wu's elder brother, Wu Caoyun, was ordered by his mother to negotiate with Lu and others at Room 303 of the Oriental Hotel. After several hours of negotiation, they failed to reach a resolution. Afterwards, Lu Huilin's father, Lu Zhengxiang, filed a complaint with the Laozha Police Station, accusing them of obstructing freedom and extortion, and the police arrested Wu Caoyun and Wu's relatives and friends, handing them over to the Special District Local Court. Xu Jiashi questioned them twice and sentenced Wu Caoyun and others to 30 days of detention and a fine of 200 yuan each. Wu and others refused to accept the verdict and appealed. During the hearing by Song, the presiding judge of the High Court, Lu and others stated that Wu Caoyun had not obstructed freedom or extorted money during the negotiations at the Oriental Hotel. Afterwards, Judge Song overturned the verdict, acquitted Wu Caoyun, and handed Lu Huilin, Zhao Huiying, Yu Huisheng, and Lu's father, Lu Zhengxiang, over to the police for investigation. The police considered that Lu and others were suspected of false accusation and enticement and filed a public prosecution. Zhou, the presiding judge of the Special District Local Court, held a hearing. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, the third hearing was held. Additional witnesses were summoned and questioned. Only Yu Huisheng was absent from the defendants. After Judge Zhou questioned them, he allowed the lawyers of both parties to make their arguments. The prosecutor then stood up and argued that although Wu Huirong had signed a document with Lu and others when Lu Huilin and others invited Wu Huirong to Tianjin to perform magic, she did not have the consent of her parents, which constituted the crime of enticement under Article 257, which was not subject to discussion. As for the false accusation, Lu and others had confessed that Wu Caoyun had not obstructed freedom or extorted money during the negotiations at the Oriental Hotel. Although Lu and others later claimed that they changed their statements in the High Court because Wu Caoyun had asked someone to mediate, this was unreasonable. If Wu Caoyun had obstructed freedom and extorted money and the court had already ruled so, there was no reason to change their statements because the other party had requested mediation. The reason why Lu and others changed their statements was because their conscience was clear. Therefore, the crime of false accusation was also obvious. The court should judge the case according to law.</p>
<p>Judge Zhou then asked Lu and others if they had anything to say. Lu and others all replied no. Then, the verdict was announced as follows: Lu Zhengxiang is sentenced to one year imprisonment for the crime of false accusation. Lu Huilin is sentenced to one year imprisonment for the crime of enticing a woman under the age of 20. Zhao Huiying is sentenced to six months imprisonment for the crime of jointly enticing a woman under the age of 20. The trial procedure for Yu Huisheng is suspended, and his bail of 500 yuan is forfeited. During the appeal period, the two Lus were taken into custody. Zhao Huiying was released on bail of 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Creditors of Gongfa Company Dispose of Hot Spring Bathhouse and Chinese and Western Pharmacy</h3>
<p>Relevant Parties Met at Zhongshe Yesterday</p>
<p>Methods Discussed for Disposing of Hot Spring Bathhouse</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western pharmacy and hot spring bathhouse operated by Huang Chu Jiu are both affiliated with Gongfa Company. Several months have passed since Huang's death, and there is no hope of repaying the debts owed by the two businesses. Recently, the creditors hired a lawyer to sue in the Special District Local Court and requested a preliminary attachment. The Special Court approved it. The bailiff and police were dispatched to seal the properties. At the bathhouse, the manager of the bathhouse, Yan Eson, arrived with a lawyer to negotiate with the creditors, requesting a delay in sealing. The creditors agreed to extend the deadline by one day, during which all the bathhouse's assets and furniture would be entrusted to the manager and other staff, who would be liable for compensation if there was any unauthorized removal or other issues. At the Chinese and Western pharmacy, lawyer Jiang Yiping negotiated with the creditors, Tu Jin'er, and accountants Pan and Wu, also agreeing to postpone the sealing. Because the deadline was very short, it was necessary to quickly find a solution. Therefore, yesterday (the 14th), the relevant parties met at the Zhongshe in Jing'an Temple to discuss solutions. Lawyers Wu Jingxiong, Chen Tingrui, and Jiang Yiping, as well as accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang, and representatives of the creditors, attended the meeting. Lawyer Eson also represented the bathhouse manager.</p>
<p>The meeting first discussed the disposal of the hot spring bathhouse. After discussion, the creditors agreed to request the court to revoke the preliminary attachment so that the bathhouse could continue to operate. However, from then on, the creditors would send a representative to jointly manage the accounts with the bathhouse accountant on a daily basis, and all cash income would be deposited in the bank for safekeeping. This method was unanimously approved and passed. Then, they discussed the Chinese and Western pharmacy, and after much discussion, they did not immediately decide on a proper method. It was said that if it could be handled in the same way as the hot spring bathhouse, the creditors would probably not object.</p>
<h3>Pan Xitang Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Kidnapping and Ransom of Liang Shaoxuan Case</p>
<p>Pan Xitang, a native of Jiangbei, colluded with accomplices in Shanghai to kidnap Liang Shaoxuan, a Cantonese, for ransom on November 13, 1927. After the case, he fled without a trace. Recently, he was arrested by Detective Bai Zhongqi of the Huisi Police Station and handed over to the Special District Local Court for trial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhitan held a court session and ordered the bandit to be brought to court, announcing the verdict of the death penalty. After the verdict, the bandit Pan was sent back to the police station to be detained, awaiting confirmation. The Special Court will then submit the case to the provincial government for approval and execution.</p>
<h3>Zhang Taijie Dies in Prison</h3>
<p>Zhang Taijie, General Manager of the Sichuan Railway Company, was sued by Zeng Xianzhi and others, representatives of the Sichuan Railway Company's board of directors, in the winter of the previous year for embezzling millions in railway funds. He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Local Court. After appealing to the High Court, the sentence was reduced to one year. He was sent back to the Shanghai Court and sent to the Caohejing No. 2 Prison to serve his sentence. He was expected to be released from prison next month. Unexpectedly, Zhang Taijie was old and suddenly fell ill recently, suffering from asthma and phlegm. Warden Dong Changmin immediately ordered the medical officer to treat him properly. Zhang died in prison at 8 o'clock yesterday morning due to old age and weakness, unable to resist the illness. Warden Dong immediately reported to the Procuratorate of the Local Court, which sent Prosecutor Wu and inspectors to the scene to inspect and confirm. His family has been notified to collect the body. It is said that he is now very poor.</p>
<h3>Fire at Wanshou Temple in Pudong</h3>
<p>The fire started from the west side of the main hall.</p>
<p>The idols in the center remain standing.</p>
<p>Wanshou Temple, located behind the Xiaoyangjing Temple at the eastern end of Lan Nidu in Pudong, was unfortunately destroyed by fire yesterday morning due to carelessness. Two main halls were burned down, and one was partially demolished. There are rumors that a junior monk started the fire out of revenge, but this has not been confirmed. The following is a record of the investigation:</p>
<p>History of the Temple: The temple is located behind the Xiaoyangjing Temple at the eastern end of the third district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, covering an area of approximately two mu. It has a history of just over ten years since its construction. A monk named Benlai (approximately fifty years old) from Mount Putuo in Ningbo painstakingly raised funds from local devout men and women, taking three years to complete. It consists of three main halls facing south. The central hall houses over a dozen idols. The east hall is the monk's bedroom. There are three side rooms facing west, the central one also housing a large full-body Buddha statue. The north room is the incense caretaker's bedroom, and the south room stores miscellaneous items. Before the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, the temple's incense offerings were quite prosperous in all four seasons, and the abbot's income was ample. After the establishment of the municipal government, due to the crackdown on temples and the elimination of superstition, those burning incense gradually disappeared. The desolate scene of late is a stark contrast to the past.</p>
<p>Origin of the Fire: The abbot, Benlai, lacking income, set off on the eighth of this month for Mount Putuo in Ningbo to offer incense. He locked his bedroom, leaving only the incense caretaker, Yuan Lianyou, to guard the temple. Yuan was timid, so he invited a beggar named Chen Alin to sleep in the side room at night for company. Last night, the two went to bed after eight o'clock. Unexpectedly, at half past one yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the west side room of the main hall, quickly becoming uncontrollable. The patrol police at the gate of the third district immediately sounded the alarm. District Chief Zhang immediately supervised all the police officers, each carrying basins and small buckets to fetch water from the Xiaobang River to douse the flames. At the same time, the east side room of the main hall was demolished to cut off the fire line. The Pudong fire brigade also arrived and started extinguishing the fire. After about an hour of burning, the fire gradually weakened and was finally extinguished. Two main halls were burned down. Most strangely, the many idols enshrined in the center remained standing, and their silk clothing was not damaged at all. Those who came to see it yesterday were amazed.</p>
<p>What About the Junior Monk? Afterwards, District Chief Zhang ordered the police to bring the incense caretaker, Yuan Lianyou, and the beggar, Lu Alin, to the district office for questioning about the cause of the fire. Yuan, fifty years old and from Ningbo, stated that he cooked meals in the temple but did not know where the fire came from. However, it was discovered that a junior monk named Longshan, eighteen years old, had brought a woman to the temple in late December of the lunar calendar last year and did not leave at night. Benlai found them and questioned them. Longshan instead beat Benlai, so he reported the incident to the police, who sent Longshan to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Later, after Longshan was released, he tried to return to the temple, but Benlai drove him away. The two had a feud. It is unknown whether this fire was set by him as an act of revenge. The district chief then ordered the police to issue a summons for Longshan, but he could not be found. Lu Alin was deemed unrelated and released. Yuan Lianyou was escorted to the main bureau in the afternoon for further action. As no one was in charge of the temple, police officers were assigned to take turns guarding it to prevent theft.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Company of Thieves</h3>
<p>Using the "suffocation chamber" method</p>
<p>On an extremely large scale</p>
<p>The Lujiazui Water Police Station received multiple reports from the Shanghai Steamship Company stating that three boxes of Zhigong woolen fabric and two boxes of Huada woolen fabric had been stolen from the Changjiang steamer on January 8. The Tianxiang Foreign Firm reported that eleven boxes of rayon had been stolen from the Gehuasi steamer on February 6. The Yitai Company reported that seven boxes of Western feathered silk had been stolen from the Xierwupaimei steamer on March 14, worth thousands of gold coins. These were all large-scale thefts. The station ordered detectives Ge Changsheng, Cheng Yongnian, Huang Songsheng, and others to investigate. The detectives discovered that the method used in these thefts involved taking advantage of the chaos when cargo was being loaded onto the steamer to sneak into the cargo hold. After the workers finished their work and the hatch was tightly closed, the thieves believed no one could enter. Then, when the night was still and quiet, the gang hired a boat to moor alongside the steamer outside the hold and knocked on it with a secret code. The thieves inside the hold would open the hatch and steal the goods together. If they were not hiding inside the hold beforehand, those outside would not have the keys and would be unable to enter. This type of operation was called "suffocation chamber." Furthermore, this gang had organized a large-scale theft company, where all internal and external theft work was assigned by the leaders. The ringleaders were Yan Shirong, Zhang Xiaolian, Chen Erbian, Li Jinyu, and Wang Hongxi. Their theft company was located at a teahouse opened by Yan Shirong at the intersection of Wuzhou Road and Youheng Road. After the detectives investigated and confirmed this, they immediately made arrests in different locations. They apprehended thieves Chen Xiaowuzi, Wu Nailian, and Dou Xiaochezi. The others had already fled. They were taken to the Water Police Station, where Head Detective He interrogated them. The three confessed to the aforementioned weaving and theft methods. In addition to continuing to apprehend the remaining criminals, the three criminals were transferred to the local court for trial.</p>
<h3>Liang Guangcun, Comprador of Steamship, Targeted by Gunman</h3>
<p>Liang Guangcun, a 33-year-old Guangdong native, worked as a translator on the Japanese Empress steamship for the Changxing Steamship Company. Last night around eight o'clock, he went shopping on North Sichuan Road with a friend. In front of the No. 987 fruit store, a gunshot suddenly rang out behind him. A bullet hit Liang in the back. He quickly turned around and saw a person wearing a Zhongshan suit running away at full speed and disappearing in an instant. Liang was unable to stand due to the pain from his injuries. His friend escorted him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that his life is not in danger. It is also learned that Liang is a comprador on the Russian Empress steamship of the Changxing Company and was targeted by an enemy this time.</p>

<h3>Six Robbers Rob Silver Shop</h3>
<p>Lao Baosheng Xinji Lost Over Two Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Detectives Hunted Down One Robber, Others Fled</p>
<p>At 11:40 AM yesterday, six robbers speaking with a Jiangbei accent suddenly came to the Lao Baosheng Xinji silver shop at Nos. 175-177 of Bierre Road (Nanyang Bridge) in the French Concession, a double-fronted store opened by Zhang Jingle from Ningbo. Three of the robbers wore Yuan-colored coarse cloth long gowns, and three wore white-gray cotton gowns, resembling rural people. Two robbers stood guard outside, and four robbers entered the store, pretending to buy and exchange gold rings. They each drew handguns and threatened the shop assistants, forbidding them from making a sound. Two robbers jumped into the shop hall and robbed over sixty gold rings, weighing over twenty taels, and silver dollars in cash, totaling over two thousand gold. Carrying the stolen goods, they fled eastward. Shop assistant Hu Zugen chased after them, shouting "Thieves!" He chased them to the intersection of Cale Road. Inspector Jin Jiulin of the Special Agency of the French Police Station, Detective Li Yaolong, Deputy Detective Qian Yumin, Zhang Ziying, Mao Jingen, and patrol officers happened to hear the shout and rushed to apprehend them. They caught one robber on the spot, while the others scattered and fled. They immediately took the captured robber to the police station. The head detective interrogated the robber, who confessed his name as Wang Desheng from Qingjiang and admitted his involvement in the robbery. They found five dollars and a counterfeit bill from a certain bank on his person, but nothing else. The head detective believed that the robbers dared to rob in broad daylight and were extremely lawless. He ordered him to be detained for investigation and to apprehend his accomplices for joint prosecution.</p>
<h3>Wife Wants Divorce, Husband Unwilling</h3>
<p>Cai Yuexian and Sun Xilin</p>
<p>Local young woman Cai Yuexian, currently twenty years old, whose mother's family lives in Sanlintang, Pudong, married Sun Xilin of Sunjiazhai, south of Sanlintang, two years ago on December 24th of the lunar calendar, by order of her parents and through a matchmaker. Cai Yuexian has now engaged lawyer Wu Qinsun to draft a petition to the local court's mediation chamber requesting a divorce. The reason given is that she has been abused and beaten by the opposing party, Sun Xilin, leaving her covered in wounds. She was even confined to a room, tied up, and beaten, unable to move freely. Fortunately, her mother instructed her younger brother to visit her, and she was freed. In this situation, it is truly unbearable to live together. The injuries she suffered were examined by the procuratorate of your court on the thirteenth of last month, and the scars were verified. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Bingxin specially opened a mediation hearing and summoned petitioner Cai Yuexian, who recounted the previous events. She also stated that her husband beat her, so she twisted him to the police station. After questioning, the husband was fined ten dollars and released home. As a result, he resented me even more, tied me up with ropes, and beat me to the point of near death. I have no choice but to request a divorce. The official asked, "If you promise not to beat you in the future, can you not divorce?" She answered, "I only ate one bowl of porridge in four days. They said it's not worth farming three mu of land. If they marry a good one, I would rather die." The opposing party, Sun Xilin, then stated that he was 24 years old, from Nanhui, and lived in Sunjiazhai. He did not abuse her and did not want a divorce. The official asked, as both parties held their ground and mediation failed, and then instructed the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit separately.</p>
<h3>Avro Aircraft Flies to Beijing Today</h3>

<p>Shanghai Qin Wu Shi Bao said that Sassoon Foreign Firm has recently invested another two million taels to build a thirteen-story mansion at the southeast corner of the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, next to Hamilton Mansion.

<h3>Yifeng Li Rent Dispute</h3>
<p>Tenants Petition Municipal Agencies Today</p>
<p>Hua Dong She said that the houses in Yifeng Li on Jisi Fei'er Road in West Shanghai are of a sub-rental nature, so the construction is often simple and crude. It has been stopped by the Municipal Council and the Public Works Bureau several times. It was not until September that the project was completed. It was originally planned to build a three-story building, and there was a pavilion building. Later, due to the poor materials and unstable foundation, the building was rebuilt into a two-story building. However, the rent is still collected according to the original regulations, and there are no steps or drying platforms, which has caused dissatisfaction among the tenants. They have negotiated, but they have been shirked in every way. There has been no sincere reply to this day. The tenants have launched a tenant union to cope with the situation and have publicly elected representatives such as Zhu Yan to negotiate, requesting a reduction in rent and the paving of steps, the addition of drying platforms, etc. However, the landlord of the neighborhood accused the representative Zhu Yan to the Public Security Bureau of the Sixth District, and arrested Zhu and sent him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, falsely accusing him of inciting the tenants to commit crimes. When the tenants heard the news, they were greatly angered. They immediately jointly filed a petition. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also released Zhu after seeing the solid evidence. It is now heard that the tenants in the neighborhood have jointly filed a petition and have elected representatives to go to the municipal government, the social bureau, and the municipal party headquarters today to petition, requesting fairness in order to achieve the purpose of changing the rent, etc.</p>
<h3>Pretending to Use Postal Car to Transport Opium</h3>
<p>Caught by French Concession's Western Detective</p>
<p>Local Postal Authorities Thoroughly Investigate</p>
<p>Da Lu Bao said that at about 2 pm on Sunday afternoon, a Western detective of the French Police Station suddenly searched a suspicious-looking car that looked like it was used by the post office at the Taikoo Wharf. A bag of opium, weighing 300 ounces, was seized. However, the car managed to escape with the remaining two bags. The local postal authorities, believing that postal cars are not subject to inspection as a matter of course, and that the nature of this case is serious, ordered a thorough investigation on Monday. According to the police report, the car was registered with the concession as No. 15436 and with the municipal government as No. 3178. It arrived at the Taikoo Wharf at about 2 pm on that afternoon. At that time, the Wusong wheel had been docked for half an hour, and several postal cars had just loaded a large number of mails and left. Therefore, the Western detective became suspicious and secretly paid attention. Later, he saw the car stop and start in the pier three times. Finally, three bags were sent from the ship to the car. When two bags were loaded into the car, the detective hurriedly opened the third bag and found that the bag was full of opium. Just as he was about to check the remaining two bags, the driver jumped into the car and drove away quickly into the Public Concession. It is now expected that this car must be a local opium smuggling organization posing as a postal car to avoid inspection.</p>

They were sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Zhou presided over the trial. The woman stated that the package was entrusted to her by someone else, and she did not initially know that it contained opium. Li's statement was evasive.

<h3>Liwa Dance Troupe to Perform "Dance Fan"</h3>
<p>European and American sound films, in order to showcase their greatness and richness to the public, must include innovative singing and dancing, and the audience who do not understand English are fascinated by them because of the greatness of their singing and dancing.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the report in the local news section of your paper on the 12th about the strike by female workers in our factory's tin packaging department, the reports are slightly inaccurate. Our factory pays close attention to the treatment and work of our female workers. The cause of this strike was that a small number of female workers in the tin packaging department were performing poorly, affecting the quality of our products, and arbitrarily wasting materials used in the factory. Despite repeated warnings from our factory, they did not listen, and we had no choice but to dismiss them to restore order. However, these dismissed female workers used this as an excuse to incite the other well-behaved female workers to strike and cause disruptions starting on the 8th. They also seized the factory gate, threatening other female workers and preventing them from entering the factory to work. Our factory believes that these female workers' actions violated the law and immediately provided various forms of guidance and issued a notice ordering them to return to work as usual. Therefore, since the 10th, all the female workers have returned to the factory and are working as usual. As for the reported injuries to female workers and the withholding of wages, these are not true and can be easily investigated. Furthermore, our factory has not received the six demands that the female workers are said to have made, which is another misunderstanding. Our factory is deeply concerned that the public may not understand the truth of this strike, so we are making the above statement and requesting that you publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" section. We would be most grateful. Sincerely, Shanghai Sanxing Tobacco Company, April 13th.</p>

<h3>Sino-French Joint Academic Expedition</h3>
<p>— Xu</p>
<p>▲Date and Location of Departure: The Sino-French Joint Academic Expedition, comprised of twenty members and sponsored on the French side by Mr. Citroën, the General Manager of the Citroën Automobile Factory, will assemble on March 1st at the town of Périgueux, the officially agreed-upon departure point. The expedition will be led by explorer Mr. Haardt, the Commercial Director of the Citroën company, and Mr. Audouin-Dubreuil. Its objective is to traverse Central Asia.</p>
<p>▲One of the Collaborative Groups: This expedition has been two years in the making, and its scale is truly grand. It has received support from the French Geographical Society, the Museum of Natural History, the Ethnological Society, the Guimet Museum, and various other public academic organizations, making its organization even more comprehensive. It can be regarded as an unprecedented undertaking. Notably, the globally renowned U.S. National Geographic Society, with its 1.2 million members, has never before participated in any nation's academic expeditions since 1888. This time, it has changed its longstanding policy and will also collaborate with the expedition. As with naval officer Bellot's exploration of the Antarctic two years ago, Mr. Maynard was sent on behalf of the society to participate in the expedition.</p>
<p>▲Chinese Science to Be Revealed: The Chinese National Government and the Chinese Geographical Society will also take this opportunity to showcase their scientific work. Dr. Chu Minyi and five other scholars will follow the expedition and organize a Chinese academic expedition within China to continue the work of the French expedition.</p>
<p>▲A Talented and Diverse Team: The expedition staff consists of over forty individuals, comprising a mix of scholars, artists, and specialists. Accompanying Messrs. Haardt and Audouin-Dubreuil are several former French navy lieutenants specializing in surveying, secretary Mr. Gorges, Father Teilhard de Chardin specializing in archeology, zoology, and geology, painter Mr. Chekolev, Director of the Guimet Museum Mr. Hackin, zoologist Mr. Reymond, medical doctor Mr. Talaszto, and Messrs. Jouliaud, Benoist, and others.</p>
<p>▲Producing a Historical Travel Film: The expedition also has a film crew, led by film expert Mr. Sauvageot, with Messrs. Spek and Martial as deputies. They will exert their photographic artistry to produce a historical travel film of the expedition. Two empty trucks are available specifically for transporting camera equipment and sound recording devices. This crew will not only film previously unfilmed scenes of Asia but will also collect various sounds, such as songs, music, crowd noises, and natural sounds, to create an unprecedented and genuinely natural sound film masterpiece.</p>
<p>▲Citroën Vehicles for the Expedition: The expedition will use a total of thirteen vehicles, including seven six-cylinder climbing cars with trailers and six light vehicles, all supplied by the Citroën Automobile Factory and personally equipped by automobile engineer Mr. Kegresse. Two of these vehicles are exclusively for the expedition's science team, and two are for the sound and silent film crews. The medical room and kitchen also occupy two vehicles. The light vehicles will specialize in exploring high reefs and rugged roads and are equipped with a new hydraulic press. Their engines can withstand temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius and below 35 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>▲Expert Arrangements Show Skill: All the vehicles are painted white with elegant horizontal stripes. The interiors have been arranged by experts to be extremely comfortable, ensuring that the accompanying personnel do not have to sleep on hard boards. Breakfast and rest can be enjoyed under open-air tents. These tents are handmade by experts and are extremely easy to assemble and disassemble, requiring only five minutes. Even in the difficult-to-travel Asia, the expedition will not feel any hardship. This shows the completeness of the expedition's organization.</p>
<p>▲Admirable Travel Determination: As for the expedition's route, Périgueux, Beijing, and Saigon will serve as assembly points. Even extremely difficult-to-travel terrain and extremely harsh climates between Manchuria and Siberia, such as the Gobi Desert and Chinese Turkestan, will be traversed by the expedition. Their indomitable determination and spirit of moving forward are truly admirable.</p>
<p>▲French President's Encouraging Words: Despite his busy schedule, French President Doumergue was intrigued and visited the expedition to meet the members and inspect all the expedition materials. Mr. Citroën, the General Manager of the Citroën Automobile Factory, and Mr. Haardt, the Commercial Director of Citroën and leader of the expedition, served as hosts. The French President studied the expedition's travel route in detail and spent over an hour explaining it to the various members of the expedition. He also praised the expedition's various regulations, such as the collaboration methods, financial management, and organizational details. He then inspected the final storage area for the expedition's materials before returning to the Presidential Palace. Upon departure, he expressed his most sincere wishes and words of encouragement to the members.</p>
<p>▲Sino-French Expedition to Meet in Xinjiang: It is said that the Chinese academic expedition will travel from Beijing to Kashgar, Xinjiang, to meet the French academic expedition led by Mr. Haardt. Thus, the so-called Sino-French Joint Academic Expedition will finally be formed. From there, they will travel together to the Gobi Desert, passing through Chinese Turkestan.</p>
