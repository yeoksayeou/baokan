<p>時評</p>
<p>最近中國學術界之兩大年會　丨中國科學社與中華農學會丨我國科學之衰落情形旣如上述矣。然則障碍我國科學進步之暗礁爲何。一曰傳統之貧困哲學也。［君子安貧達人知命。］最足以代表我國懶惰之傳统觀念。人能而我不能。人有而我不能有。人翱翔於天空。我則輾乎泥濘。無已。則以貧困哲學自慰曰。此淺薄之物質文明也。我有高不可攀深不可測之精神文明在。孔子之飯蔬食飲水。樂亦在其中顔子之一篿食一瓢飲。而不改其樂。今人猶嘖嘖稱道。狐狸指不能到口之葡萄爲酸澀。即東方精神文明之代表。亦即表現我國貧困哲學之實例。此一觀念。傳至於今。抱僵尸而殉「道」之「衛道之士。」猶時唱其復古之高曲。厭亂之國民。復從而和之。於是人乃厭言科學而尙精。神於是科學之輪。在中國乃滯而不進。　　一曰利祿之傳統觀念也。學而懓則仕。爲我國讀書人之寳訓。惟其醉心於仕。故都致力於倖進巧取之術。置其腦與手於無用。視實際之研究爲卑不足齒。試看今日之學生。多從事於政治法律軍事。瘁其心力於做官。而不致其心力於科。學官非不可做。但官愈多則科學人才愈少。而科學乃遂無進步之時。　　一曰因襲之傳統觀念也。因襲守舊。國常自　爲美德。故昔之農作方法。今猶死守也。昔之手工業制度。今猶遺留也。指鐵道碾斷地脈。指汽笛震驚神</p>
<p>靈固守舊軌。子孫傳遞而勿衰。於新來之事物。。則槪拒不接受。和團之變局。今雖已無。義和團之思想。今則尙在。坐擁僵尸體騐其四週之新事物。於是科學之足。乃爲膠滯而未由進展。　　上述三者。乃爲國人心理上之暗礁。至於暗礁之在者。則猶不在此。我國家處於帝國主義者列强及殘餘封建勢兩重束縛之下。使社會長期停滯於封建社會廢墟之上。舊社會基礎。旣已瀕破滅新社會基礎。則無法建樹。列强一面對我肆其殘酷之剥削。殘餘之封建勢力。則一面復死其僵尸。於是我農業經濟破產。國苦貧弱。民生凋敝。雖大都市尙有表面上之繁榮。</p>
<p>但經濟之中心。則皆操之外人之手。而國内則又連年戰亂連年災變。天災人禍。相洊而來。人民救死之不瞻。更有何力以言科學。至於少數優秀之士。苦力研究。能有特見。而國家不能用。社會無所取。長才無以自見。尤有甚者。政治末上軌道。一切都無準繩。學法律者就業於商塲。學工程者被命於政治。學科學者社會不必用其科學。反之不學科學者。則多據實業界之高位。社會用才。無固定之標。準故人亦罔知所應努力。茫茫漠漠。惟衣與食之是競。得之則生。不得則死。生死之間。委之於數。國情如此。科學固安得而進步。國内要電三</p>

<p>由華人靑年男女組織</p>
<p>劇中對白完全用英語</p>
<p>西俗視十三爲不祥之數、當者避之若凂、惟恐不速、若於星期五有十三人共舉一事、則其前途之　蹬、有非楮墨所能言宣者、以十三旣爲不祥之數、而星期五又爲厄運之一日也、今滬上有中華英語劇社者、爲一班新思想之靑年男女所組織専用英語表演國劇、俾西人能深切瞭解吾國舊日之高尙文化、與社會生活之固有美德、此種演劇方法、前祗於少數學校中見之、流行未廣、未能引起之注意、故此中華語劇社、不但在上海爲首創、即以全國論、亦當推爲一種特殊之組織、是社成立於本年五月之星期五日、其中堅份子之發起人數爲十三、律以西俗、可謂否運之至、然三個月來、進行順利、大事畢舉、近且以公演名劇「西施」聞、其進取精神、殊堪嘉許、而此一班靑年男女、决非爲迷信歐西生活者、、又可斷言也</p>
<p>中華英語劇社之宗旨、在表演中國之古代文化、使西人於戲劇之中、確切認識吾國之攸久歷史、及古代之社會生活、在劇社之本身方面、則爲提高靑年人之思想、俾能隨時表白吾優美民族之特性、以增進國際間之交誼、劇中所用之詞句、對白純粹爲英語、俾西人之觀劇者、毫無隔膜之患、其首次公演已定「西施」一劇、西施爲中國女性美之代表者、久爲西人士所樂道此劇一演、行見西人之頌揚之西施者、又當一變其目光矣、</p>
<p>該社成立以來祇及三月、滬人士容多未知其性質及組織、此劇社全爲愛美性質、其宗旨已備如上述、社長爲馬家壽夫人、郭安慈女士副之、均屬海上婦女界聞人、有聲於社交者也、秘書施肇康君、司庫周翻蘋君、社員現有三十餘人、咸受高尙敎育、能操流利之英語、社中經費、由滬上著名商人及銀行家等所擔任、社員毎月亦須納相當會費、常會每半月一次、演劇無定期、國内外文學界名流贊助此社者甚衆、聞胡適博士亦其中之一也、</p>
<p>西施公演之期刻已定於十一月中、據社中重要職員稱、是劇以伍聯德夫人所著之西施一書爲藍本、劇詞對白、由周翻蘋·李時敏·馬家壽夫人·及施肇康等諸君等編著、取材審愼、劇情優美、務求與古代文化相吻合、全劇現已編竣、兩星期後、即須開始演習、已請美國歐哈拉夫人爲導演及顧問、歐夫人細心劇學、具有二十年之舞臺經騐、此劇得此能手導演、其成效之著、感人之深、當能更進一步耳、</p>
<p>斯社前途成功要爲吾人意料中事、現在雖耒將劇本公演、然聲譽所佈、已極令人注意、歐美戲曲専家對此尤爲欽仰、蓋以西人研究吾中國戲劇者每無相當之導具、此社之組織、誠一最接近之階梯、也其尤足令吾人爲該社慶者、即其所定之宗旨及所欲演之戲劇、均爲西人向所渴欲求而不能求者、故自該社成立之消息宣佈後、駐滬各外國大影片公司代表、均受總部之囑、要求向該社拍攝有聲電影、亦足見其在戲劇界所居之地位矣、</p>

<p>俵積雄（日）　　（六丨一）　邱飛海（中）</p>
<p>（三丨六）</p>
<p>（六丨四）</p>
<p>邱俵二人乃滬上網球家之巨擘亦爲中日兩國</p>
<p>國手、兩人技藝之超羣、固已有目共賞、但一年以來、各個之進境如何則頗爲一般人於所急於求知、昨日兩人各負本國代表使命、參加扶輪盃决賽之第一單打賽、爲國家增光、爭個人榮譽、出以全力、勢所必然而千餘觀衆作壁上觀者、亦豈偶然哉、大戰之、下俵積雄竟以三比一勝邱飛海、觀者視爲事實所致非賴僥倖、邱氏握手道賀良亦处嘆不及也、</p>
<p>平均見優俵氏駐防底綫左右抽擊、攻守咸能、偶然上網、亦具把握、奔跑迅速、發球有力、尤其拿手、邱氏得意之順手射擊、已不多見有時試用、良覺可畏、發球失、勁脚步遲緩、是其失敗主因、惟善用巧勁、每能以柔克剛、俵氏之甩不及也、平均比較、俵氏見優、</p>
<p>水深火熱兩英雄抱拍登塲、觀衆予以熱烈歡迎、稍稍活動、即行開戰、邱氏上塲占勢、每爲俵氏截擊、立成二比數第三局邱氏極盡技能控制全局、左右前後、隨心所欲似已回恢其初次來華時之黄金時代、掌聲不絕於耳、得意不可一世之秋也、第三局、遂成囊中物矣、惟自此次後俵氏處處占優、立陷邱氏於水深火熱之中、一氣呵成八局、第一盤六比二勝後、又以三比零占先於第二盤邱氏努力週旋、始而奪回一局、乃狂風暴雨、又驟然光臨刦後之身、不塂摧殘、後之三局、不期而然又屬俵氏之勝利品矣、第二盤六比一、俵氏再勝、</p>
<p>力挽阨運邱氏負二盤觀者危之、然邱氏神色自若、大有力挽阨運之精神、氣壯力足、　二之後、加勝二局、一再奮發無往不利、俵氏困顚於强敵手掌之下、任人蠶食、終以三比六之結果、失敗第三盤於邱氏、休息十分鐘之後第四盤開始、邱氏在零比三失敗之下、奪得勝局、觀者神飛色揚、互相告慰、第二局凈四再勝、狂呼之聲大起、似勝利在握、俵氏色變、提起精神、打成二二平數、繼而邱氏又勝一局、俵氏再平之、且超越其前邱氏予以顏色、即成四四平數、是時形勢緊張風雲變色、邱氏阨運又來、連負二局、終以四比六負第四盤、</p>

<p>（七比五）</p>
<p>江道道章町田之戰、在决賽中實佔一重要之地位、江如勝町、則中華隊雙打尙可得一機會、蓋邱兩單打旣不能全勝、則江如敗於町田、中華雖勝雙打、亦不濟事矣、故邱旣失敗、全部觀者之注意點、悉集中於江町、幸江道章於狂風險浪中、卒擊敗町田、爲中華隊、殺出一條生路、</p>
<p>把握稍差以江之資格球藝町田實非其敵手、然江於一帆風順中、連勝二盤後、竟接連大敗二盤、使日人有得勝機會、且第五盤江以五比二佔極優　時、竟讓町田追成五比五、其故非他、缺欠把握故也、發球抽球攔殺江在在勝町、更於一二兩盤、中不可佳妙表演、至於町田、純粹日本之特長、精於抽繫、富於長力、我人觀其去年之球藝與今秋突飛之進步、不禁瞠然驚偑、樬之江道章能於一蹶不振、中挽回最後之勝利、不可不曰萬幸矣、</p>
<p>風波突起町田先供球、江節節勝利、勝三局、町僅勝第四第五兩局、第一盤江以六比二大勝、第二盤江仍以有力之角球抽擊及上網欄殺、又以五比二高據上風、町田雖又得二局、江仍以六比四再勝、不料一帆風順中、驚浪狂濤、突起身前堅穩强固之根基、忽呈動搖現象、人心惶惶、不知能有一綫生機否、第三盤江以三比四落後後、竟連敗十局、以三比六失第三盤、○比六落花流水失第四盤、於是中華隊之生命、悉繫於此最後一盤矣、</p>
<p>險中獲勝第五盤開始、天色已垂垂暮矣、適邱飛海已宣告失敗江町二人、俱精力已疲、誰操勝算兩無把握、而町田則以二比○佔先、江之能否得勝、莫不面面相覻、江道章知使命之重大、精神一振竭所有餘力、猛抽重壓、連勝五局、造成極有把握之五比二勝局、然猛攻之後、用力過度、管束又差野球觸網、陸續而來、町田忽追成五比五時暮　已四合、光綫大差、</p>
<p>二人乃此薄薄夜色中爭勝負、二局經數度之平手江終得七比五最後之勝利、合計之爲三比二</p>

<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>美國動物學家及中亞細亞探險隊的領袖安徒氏。近在倫敦畫報上發表一篇關於發現今已絕跡的古代巨獸的牙齒的經過。茲迻譯如次以供考古家之研究。</p>
<p>約摸在二百萬年以前。東蒙古曾經有過一個大湖。差不多有現在的密芝根湖（lakemicbigan在北亞美利加洲。面積有二五六零零方哩）那麽。大一九二八年夏季爲中亞細探險隊所發現。當然湖水是乾枯了。祇有一點兒湖岸的痕跡可以隱約的看見我們在那兒兩個星期。地質學者歇爾君掘得一個扁平的盆子式的東西。大約十吋。長八吋寛四分之三吋厚經我們再三的研究結果。才知道那是一個牙齒。但那是什麽種類的動物的牙齒。我們還是莫明其妙。我們又繼續發掘。在三天以内。一共掘得十幾枚。</p>
<p>後來我們回到北。平轉上海。返美國經過各國的考古學家的研究。才斷定它乃是一種今已絕跡的古代巨獸的巨齒在美國又繼續不停的研究兩年。許多有名的考古學家一律確定係這類的牙齒。還不在少數。於是我們在九三零年春季又全隊回到原處去探險。</p>
<p>我們的篷帳仍駐在湖邊。在篷帳的前面遠遠的有條小河横着。在後面却是一大塊沙漠。在那兒除了小羚羊以外。並没有一個蒙古。人野狼常常成羣結隊的漫山遍野的來襲擊我們。幸而我們都有槍有一次竟給我們擊死了二三十匹野狼。其勢才稍殺。所以我們稱之爲「狼村」。但小羚羊非常有益於我們。它們的。乳我們都以爲是無上的飲料。</p>
<p>一天。我們在離篷帳六哩左右的地方。掘得六枚巨獸的臼齒。比一九二八年掘得的更要大。因此我們便斷定這兒一定是一個巨獸埋葬牙齒的墳墓。但因爲這兒並不是泥土。乃是很堅固的岩石。不要說是人掘。便是用炸藥去。炸也覺得很困難。可又不敢用炸藥。怕炸壤了我們的目的物。没法想。祇有像雕刻似的。一點兒。一點兒的把石頭敲碎。於是三百萬年前的秘密。竟給我們揭開了。</p>
<p>經過兩個多月的發掘工。作得着多量的牙齒。有的像石臼形。有的像　形。有的像匙形。並且又掘得許多的肋。骨脊椎骨。頭蓋。四肢的骨。頭我們像拼七巧板似的把它們搭成四十匹猙獰可怕的古代巨獸。（都是雄的）。其形和我們現在習見的象差不多。但其龐大的身體又遠過之。</p>
<p>在另一個地方。我們又發現很多幼小的與雌性的巨獸。據専家研究。當初這個湖没有乾枯的時候。大概有許多幼小的巨獸來飲水。不幸都失足跌下去淹。死它們的母親。爲救它們小生命。便也犧牲了自己的生命。所以雌性的也不在少數。因此又斷定它們乃是哺乳動物證之今日那兒有很多的哺乳動物。像小羚羊·狐狸·野狼以及肉食獸類。也許不十分武斷罷。</p>

<p>本年水災之慘重。與被災區域之廣闊。確爲百年以來所僅見。因之發生種種奇聞異。事類皆出人意表。頃晤一河口歸客。談及該地大水泛濫時。援起望江樓前飄流三百里之王姓三童事。尤令人聞之咋舌。脫遇迷信家。必將謂冥冥中有神呵護矣。爰記其顚末如次。</p>
<p>王姓三童者昆季本四歙縣望岡人父名建泰。操舟爲業。長子名天照。年十六。次子名天配。年十四。三子名天松。年十二。四子名天栢。祇八齡。是日因有一舊船。　於距望岡十里許之河中修理。建泰夫婦及數子均往督工。天松獨未隨往。已而建泰夫婦亦返家。天照天配天栢三人留。焉其處本爲大河支流。河面狹而淺。乾涸時多。而船身則甚大。即以本年多雨。溝澮皆盈。始能容船修理。船夥疏忽。並未繫纜。以爲此大船。泊於小河中。不虞有他也。洎薄暮。羣坐船頭納凉。天空驟變。風起雲湧。耳畔聞水聲如雷鳴。未幾。大水澎漲。儼若排山倒海。汹湧而至。船陡托起。不能自主。羣皆驚惶失措。各取櫓負而遁。不復能顧三童。三童奔下艙中。無計可施。但覺波濤湍急。船身起。伏逐水漂流。不知歷若干里。又屢次觸石。首尾均破。三童在危難。中忽得一望板。天照天配各跨一端。天栢年稚。適在中。天照天配四手相接。範天栢不墜。於是載浮載沉。任其所之。一夜之間。竟漂流至河口望江樓前。河口爲沿河市集。當漢水上。游亦泛濫成災矣。一般無頼。見上流漂來家具箱篋無算。正紛紛駕小舟。爭相撈取。遙見上流又漂一巨物來。不辨何物。大喜。以爲可得一注大財。孰意旣近。乃一望板。有三童附其上。不覺驚奇。遂援之起。送往鴻興（船行名）暫寄。爲之易濕衣。並與以食。三童漂流一夜。毫未受傷。一時聞訊往觀者甚衆。咸嘖嘖稱異。三童皆極聰明。齒牙伶俐。從容以姓名家世及遭難情形對人言。始知其竟漂流至三百里之遙云。</p>

<p>我國留法學生。逐年激增。他們研究的學科。以法學·政治·經濟爲最多。大概這種功課。比别種科學來得容易些。誰都想混幾。年得一個頭銜。回國來退可以任大學敎授。進可以升官發財。在法國得學位。並不稀奇。倘如你在研究院畢業的時候肯花幾千個佛。郎就可以請一位専門學者。代做一篇論文。那末博士·碩士的榮譽。都有希望了便是研究美術的。據說像徐悲那樣曾下一番苦功的人。就不易多得。在我（碭女士自稱）所知道的留法學生。十之六七。是荒乎其蕩的。像巴黎那麽繁華的市場。一切的一。切都富於引誘性意志薄弱的人。本來易於同流合汚。的留學生除少數篤學志士以外。竟也不自掙扎。解脫這種惡劣的環境。花天酒地。　倒於人肉市場。嫖洋妓討洋婆。的不一而足。他們幾乎忘却自身所負的使。命與國家作育人材的大計。他如一班自費。生復多方運動庚子賠欵項下的公費。名爲補助學。費實則何嘗爲讀書而爭此意外的津貼。倒是眞能専心力學的苦學生。因爲没有門路不能分潤絲毫的利益。才是困苦呢。在我個人的眼光看來。留法學生的確比留學别國的人。更來得浪漫。並不是我故意說這偏見的話。　如日本的留法學生。情形就大不相同。固然日本遣派留學。生不像中國這樣泛濫。日本學生。克勤克苦。除非爲研究一種艱深的學問。特請専家敎導。雖費多金而勿惜。否則决不浪費金錢。所以日本學生回國後。往往在科學上有發明。創製的貢獻。那絕對不是偶然的成功了。</p>
<p>我們在歐洲無論到那一國總感覺「自慚形穢」。爲的國勢衰。弱國際地位就低落得可。憐我常想同是一個人。爲什麽西洋人到中國。來都是趾高氣。揚而中國人到了歐陸。就垂頭喪氣呢。這種「自尊」與「自卑」的情緒。自己也不能解釋了。不要說我們小百姓。就是我們的外交官。也没有像外國的外交官那樣尊　這實在難怪做外交官的人。而在於政府太不顧到國家的體面。和原諒外交官的苦衷。别的不用。說單就駐外使領館的經費而言。已經積久數月。弄到山窮水盡了。一旦發生事故要呈報中。央連一通電報費都要發生恐。慌常人以爲外交官何等闊綽。殊不知身歴其境或明白底細的人。早已認外交官爲災官。使領館爲最窮的機關的了。</p>

<p>（十）满清亡於「十不」</p>
<p>吾人研究日人在我中國東北部經營之各種事業尤須注意其各部事業之思想計畫。與科學方。法蓋一切事業均須有思想計畫爲之綱領科學方法爲之推。行始克奏效或謂满清之得中國固賴有洪承疇之策劃而後世满清之亡亦亡於洪氏所預定之方略。思想之偉能甚矣哉非敷淺唯物論家所得領味者矣洪氏降清後。頗悔當時投降之孟浪。加之明室遺民假設祭壇祭奠洪承疇之爲國亡身。以激之。洪氏乃思得「十不」之計。清室不察且世世奉守爲祖宗家法十不者（一）男投女不投。男穿胡服。女仍漢妝也。（二）官投役不投官用翎頂袍褂役仍紅黑其。帽圓領其衣。保存漢制。官不如役。（三）文投武不投文官悉服满裝而武將則屆迎霜降迎喜神耀兵之時。有盔甲亭一座庋放盔甲游行於市以示不忘古制。（四）長投幼不投人至成丁。衣服冠。履遵清制而當始生之初其襁褓之衣無有不裁作道袍式。者帽則紫金之冠。鶴　之巾均漢族之遺制（五）生投死不投生時衣着一切。勉就清制範圍。而死後飾終。則棺槨枕衾。銜封儀注。無一不悉仍漢族古制。且孝子衰冠哀杖。麻衣芒鞋。儼然一有明詩。人尤足觸目驚心。令人不忘亡國。（六）紳商士庶投乞丐不投昔時每屆端午歲除令節。有等乞兒。以紙糊紗帽扮作鍾進士或財神等。向鋪戶乞錢。使人一覩漢官儀。制引動種族觀念。（七）俗家投方外不投有清一代僧道女尼。不改空門法服。（八）科甲投秀才不投雀頂藍衫。儼是漢家制。度（九）陽官投陰官不投有清一。代各郡縣城隍土地。皆仍紗帽紅袍。（十）頭投脚不投百官朝賀時。頭戴紅纓。帽雖爲清代官。員而足登方頭古靴。洪承疇氏手定十條法規。寓種族革命思想於其。中同時使满人日漸削弱。世人孜孜於逐物。未審思想之偉能。足以預定一全民族之命運也。蒙古成吉思汗軍師。元中書令耶律楚材氏。一日遇西夏人常八斤善治弓者。謂楚材。曰國家尙武。而明公欲以文進。不亦左乎。楚材答曰。治弓者尙須。匠豈治天下不用天下匠耶。余於研究中國東北部問。題深感思想計畫之確。定尤急於物質之建設。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chiang Decides on Disaster Relief Measures After Arriving in Hankou <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Water Recedes Half a Foot in Wuhan Yesterday</p>
<p>Five Pontoon Bridges Being Erected in Hankou</p>
<p>It is heard that Chiang has decided on disaster relief measures in Hankou, focusing on immediate aid and long-term solutions such as dredging the river. Chiang has also agreed to attend an expanded weekly memorial service at the provincial government on the 31st at the request of various sectors. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The water in Hankou and Wuhan receded by half a foot on the 29th. The Disaster Prevention Office has scheduled to end the evacuation of immigrants to Jiangsu and Zhejiang on the 31st, to be handled by the Emergency Relief Committee. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>He Chengjun and others convened a meeting at No. 38 Huangpi Road in Hankou, deciding on emergency rescue measures for the flood. They have requested Zhu Qinglan to borrow the latest drainage pumps from Shanghai merchants for drainage in Hankou and to go to Beijing to purchase reed sheds. They have also telegraphed the central government, requesting that disaster relief public bonds be allocated to cover the necessary materials and labor costs for repairing the ring road of Hankou and opening up tributaries of the Xiang River. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hubei branch of the Hankou Flood Relief Association has decided to erect pontoon bridges in Hankou, dividing them into five main lines: (1) Jianghan Road to Laopu, (2) Zhongshan Road to Liudu Bridge, (3) Jiaotong Road to Minsheng Road, (4) Qianhualou to Minsheng Road, (5) Minsheng Road to the China Merchants Bureau. Completion is scheduled for one week. The work in various disaster areas will be jointly handled by the Association and the Emergency Relief Committee. (29th Dispatch) After arriving in Wuchang, Chairman Chiang immediately convened a meeting with He Chengjun and others to discuss fundamental disaster relief measures. He also telegraphed orders to Hunan and Jiangxi to lift the ban on rice exports to maintain food supplies and ordered the Central Bank's Hankou branch to allocate 300,000 yuan to stimulate the financial sector. He Chengjun convened a meeting with banking representatives today and decided to extend the loan period. (29th Dispatch) The Hankou Garrison Headquarters arranged several residences for Chiang: (1) the Hubei Provincial Government, (2) the Wuhan Military Academy, (3) the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Pacification Commissioner's Office. Chiang has not resided in any of these places. On the 29th, he was still stationed on the Yong Sui warship. Zuo Duo and Wang Shi of the Provincial Party Committee, and Liu Yun and Li Yizhong of the Municipal Party Committee boarded the ship at noon to meet him, reporting on their assistance to the government in investigating the flood and relief efforts. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A major fire broke out at the Texaco Oil Depot in Hankou at 2:00 PM yesterday. Li Zilu and Mayor He personally went to provide rescue. For each person rescued by a boat, one yuan was given. It is now reported that about 30 to 40 people were killed or injured. The flames are still not extinguished. (29th Dispatch) In and out of the Hankou concessions, old brick houses have foundations gradually weakening, many are tilting, and numerous cracks have appeared on the exterior walls, which is particularly worrying. Trees are submerged, and where water stagnates, a strange odor is unbearable. Yesterday, a Chinese crew member on the Serugieks Tasdar (flag unknown) died of virulent typhoid. Chinese assistance is insufficient, and there are signs that infectious diseases may spread. (29th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Provincial Government Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang Provincial Government telegraphed the National Government, stating that this time the dyke on the Grand Canal has broken in more than ten places, large and small, flooding seven or eight counties. Chu Cang and others were unable to defend, and relief efforts were weak, causing hundreds of thousands of people to die without burial places and live without homes. The crime of dereliction of duty cannot be excused. They request severe punishment to deter negligence and to apologize to the people. Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee members Ye Chu Cang and others kowtow in grief. (29th Dispatch) The Zhenjiang Provincial Government held an emergency meeting on the 29th, chaired by Ye Chu Cang, and resolved to (1) report the dyke break and lack of defense to the National Government and request punishment, (2) telegraph all national party headquarters, governments, and organizations to request disaster relief for the people, and (3) issue a circular warning all county magistrates, bureau chiefs, and all civil servants to be diligent and conscientious in their duties and not to request leave or abandon their posts without permission, with severe punishment for violators.

<h3 id="e4">Huaian Dikes Facing Imminent Danger <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Disaster in Gao and Shao is Extremely Tragic</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan to Visit Gao and Shao Today to Inspect the Disaster</p>
<p>The Jinghe, Caodian Chahe, Fugong Dike, Zhanggong Dike, and Wanrenyuan Dike in Qingjiangpu and Huaian are all in great danger due to the breach of the Gaoyou Dike. In addition to tightly closing the east gate of the city, people are being dispatched to reinforce the dikes overnight, and ships are being requisitioned to transport to the east of the river in preparation for rescue. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Fellow villagers from Jiangsu's Yangzhou prefecture residing in Beijing are deeply grieved and anxious because Gaoyou and Shaobo have suffered a tragic submergence, and most of their family members and relatives in their hometowns have perished. They are rushing back to see their relatives and are organizing beggar groups to appeal to the authorities. (29th Dispatch) Qingjiangpu. Liang Guanying has sent personnel to investigate the flood in northern Jiangsu, reporting the findings to the central government to request relief. He has also dispatched the Quartermaster Director Niu Jiran to Shanghai to purchase film projectors and films to assist in disaster relief. (29th Dispatch) Qingjiangpu. Li Mingyang, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department, came to Huai'an on the afternoon of the 28th to investigate the water situation and returned to Gaoyou on the morning of the 29th. (29th Dispatch) Zhenjiang. Cheng Jingsheng, the executive member of the Jiangsu Flood Emergency Relief Association, arrived in Zhenjiang on the morning of the 29th with Yuan Zigu and a dozen others, carrying 30,000 yuan, dry food, and medicine, requesting the provincial government to send personnel on ships to Shaobo, Gaoyou, Xinghua, and other counties to distribute emergency relief. (29th Dispatch) Zhenjiang. The towboat dispatched from Zhenjiang on the 27th has already returned today. According to reports, only the middle section of Shaobo town remains, with breaches on both ends like sawtooths. The breach near Zhaoguan, measuring 130-140 zhang, is the largest. The sound of the water can be heard for several miles, and the waves are over a zhang high, resembling the Yangtze River from a distance. The northern city has become a large river. The breach at Yumatou in Gaoyou occurred at 1:00 AM on the 26th. That night, the police brigade demanded pay and attempted to mutiny, and prisoners escaped from jail. Gunfire erupted, and people dared not go out to reinforce the dikes, resulting in the breach. The prosperous business district outside the north gate has been completely swept away. The exact number of refugees in both places is still unknown. Over 3,000 people, mostly citizens and villagers, have been transported to Yangzhou and Zhenjiang. Many others have drifted eastward with the current. (29th Dispatch) Zhenjiang. Zhu Qinglan telegraphed Zhenjiang, stating that he will come to Zhenjiang on the 30th with Zhou Xiangxian, Cha Liangzhao, and Western engineer Stowe to inspect the disaster area in Gao and Shao by airplane. Chairman Ye has prepared a special ship to accompany them. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Disaster Relief Bonds <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<h3 id="e6">Total Amount to be Requested from Chiang <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Issuing Ten Million First is Considered More Effective</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of 80 million yuan in disaster relief bonds in Nanjing, the Legislative Yuan advocates issuing more, while the Ministry of Finance believes that the collateral is too small. If the bond amount is too large, it will not be possible to repay the principal and interest, and no one will be willing to purchase them. It would be better to issue 10 million first, and then continue to issue more after other bond collateral is released. Because the special tobacco tax is already collateral for treasury bonds, and stamp taxes on tobacco and alcohol have other fixed collateral, if too many disaster relief bonds are issued, not only will no one purchase the disaster relief bonds themselves, but it will also affect other bonds with overlapping collateral, which will damage the financial credibility of the government. At yesterday's National Government meeting, the opinions of the committee members were not consistent. Most said that the disaster is so severe, how can 10 million be distributed? They hoped that the Ministry of Finance would economize on other expenses and strive to raise funds for disaster relief. Even if 80 million cannot be issued, at least 50 million should be issued. As a result, the Ministry of Finance authorities still insisted on issuing 10 million first because collateral was not available for the time being, and promised to plan again, issuing subsequent installments of 10 million whenever collateral became available. (29th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. After this morning's Legislative Yuan meeting adjourned, Shao Yuanchong spoke with the committee members, reporting that yesterday's government meeting discussed the 80 million yuan disaster relief bond issue, and because Song Ziwen telegraphed, strongly advocating issuing according to the original plan of 10 million, the discussion was inconclusive. However, it was not submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. It is heard that a telegram has been sent to Chiang requesting instructions on the total amount to be issued. How it will be decided is unknown. Yu Youren and other committee members are also reviewing it. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. The Legislative Yuan passed the 80 million yuan disaster relief bond issue, using tobacco and alcohol taxes as collateral. (29th Dispatch) Nanjing. Song Ziwen reported to the government, stating that the American wheat loan is expected to succeed, but the collateral is insufficient to issue a large bond. Regarding the management of the fund, it is more convenient to have it managed by the current committee. Chairman Chiang quite agreed with Song's proposal and still considered the proposal to issue 10 million first to be more effective. The regulations may be announced at next week's State Council meeting. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Flood Relief Association <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<h3 id="e8">Establishes Hygiene and Epidemic Prevention Group <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Liu Ruiheng Appointed as Director</p>
<p>Nanjing. The National Government Flood Relief Committee has established a Hygiene and Epidemic Prevention Group, appointing Liu Ruiheng as Director. The group consists of four sections: administrative, hygiene, epidemic prevention, and medical affairs. An advisory committee has also been established, appointing Chinese and foreign hygiene experts as members. Concrete plans have been made for environmental hygiene, epidemic prevention, medical relief, and other matters. Since a major epidemic is expected after the major disaster in Hankou, Jin Shishan, a technical officer from the Ministry of Health, and specialist Bo Xilan Fengsheng, have been specially dispatched with a large quantity of medicine to the disaster area in Hankou on the morning of the 29th to implement the work. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. The Flood Relief Committee's affairs, files, and funds related to the flood disaster have been sorted out and will be transported to Shanghai within days to be received by the Flood Relief Association. (29th Dispatch) Nanjing. The National Government Flood Relief Committee has decided to maintain its office in Shanghai, rather than move to Beijing, for the sake of convenient internal and external liaison. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. The Flood Relief Committee transported 850 dan of bread from Shanghai on the 29th to provide relief to disaster victims in the capital. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Water Level in the Capital Gradually Falling <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing. On the morning of the 29th, the water level of the Yangtze River fell by more than a foot. The current water level of the river is only slightly higher than the city. The eight drainage pumps installed by the Municipal Public Works Bureau in Xiguan began operating on the 29th, and can discharge 800,000 dan of water every two hours.

<p>Nanjing.

The Ministry of Finance has also dispatched advisor Solarski to assist in the US. The US State Department has approved it and handed it over to the Department of Agriculture for handling. Although some in the US advocated not collecting interest for ten years, the Department of Agriculture, adhering to the US government's intention, is still considering it. Representative Rong has been negotiating with the US in recent days. Although telegrams have arrived in Beijing, the establishment still has a considerable process. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Changsha. The disaster-stricken areas in Hunan Province reach 54 counties, covering about 20,000 square Chinese miles, with 14 million disaster victims (of which over 200,000 died). Disaster-stricken arable land reaches 8 million mu, and about 7 million houses have been lost. Other grains and miscellaneous crops have suffered immeasurable losses. Except for a small part, the rest of Changsha city is flooded. However, Japanese residents have not suffered direct damage. Disaster victims throughout Hunan Province are crying for food. Although the Provincial Relief Association has requested assistance from the central government, it has only received 170,000 yuan, which is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. The severely affected counties have received only 3,000 yuan, and the lightly affected counties only 1,000 yuan. Now that the autumn harvest is hopeless, food is a concern. In addition to banning rice exports and banning brewing, the authorities are distributing seeds for planting after the water recedes. (29th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e13">The Issue of Yan and Feng Going Abroad <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Will Be Jointly Urged by Generals from Three Provinces</p>
<p>Beiping. The issue of Yan Xishan going abroad has been discussed by various important figures for days, but there is still no result. Yan's return to Shanxi coincided with Shi's raising troops, and various parties cannot help but be suspicious. Therefore, they all hope that Yan will leave early to dispel misunderstandings. Some Shanxi generals believe that Yan coming and going again seems to be unseemly. They want Yan to stay temporarily in his old home. Xu Yongchang was recommended by Li Shizeng's telegram this time and was elected Chairman of Shanxi Province. Xu Yongchang's private relationship with Yan is still strong. At the Xiehe Hospital meeting on the 27th evening, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Yang Aiyuan, Han Fuqu, Jiang Bocheng, Wang Shuhan, Yu Xuezhong, Ji Yiqiao, and others were present and discussed Yan's going abroad for a long time. Yang remained silent throughout, and Xu strongly defended Yan's non-intervention in politics in Shanxi. Repeated discussions were inconclusive. Han Fuqu still did not change his original intention of Yan leaving, insisting that Yan and Feng go abroad to avoid misunderstandings. Finally, generals from Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces will jointly telegraph to urge Yan and Feng to go abroad, so as to achieve the goal. Han will return to Jinan only after the issue of Yan and Feng going abroad is resolved. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Xu Yongchang visited Fu Zuoyi tonight to discuss the issue of Yan and Feng going abroad. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Song Zheyuan returned to Beiping from Tianjin last night and visited Han Fuqu this morning. They discussed the issue of Feng going abroad for a long time. Han and Song are both former subordinates of Feng and are actively trying to help Feng go abroad. Han will leave Beiping only after this matter is resolved. This evening, Ceng Guangxiang, Ge Guangting, Gao Jiyi, and others hosted a banquet for Han. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Wu Tiecheng said that he and Zhang Puquan were ordered by the central government to mediate the Guangdong affair and are still in progress. A peaceful resolution is not hopeless. The chairmen of various North China provinces have come to Beiping one after another and have held several meetings to seek a safe strategy for North China. The North China generals are all paying close attention to the Yan and Feng issue. The Deputy Commander and various generals all hope that they will leave Shanxi as soon as possible to dispel rumors. After the situation stabilizes, Yan can return to his hometown. He has been appointed as the Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, but the date of his inauguration has not been set. (29th)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Has Full Authority to Handle the Gansu Incident <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Telegraphs Lei Zhongtian to Stop Action. The Conflict Between Hui and Han is Not a Fact.</p>
<p>Nanjing. Regarding the Gansu coup, it is heard that the central government has ordered Yang Hucheng to handle it with full authority. Yang has telegraphed Lei Zhongtian to stop action and has sent personnel to investigate the truth. (29th Dispatch) Nanjing. The inside story of the Gansu coup is quite complicated. The Lanzhou area has long been the sphere of influence of Lei Zhongtian's newly编第十八师(New 18th Division). Lei was originally a former subordinate of Feng Yuxiang, with about 20,000 troops. When Ma Hongbin entered Gansu, he only led a portion of his troops into Lanzhou. Due to the power relationship, it was inevitably uneasy. Yang Hucheng, Chairman of Shaanxi, has telegraphed Chiang to request instructions on how to deal with it. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Someone familiar with the situation in Gansu said that the cause of the Gansu incident has been brewing for a long time and cannot be said to have erupted suddenly. However, when Ma Tingxian was entrenched in Gansu, he appointed Han Jinlu as the army commander, Zhang Yanming as the commander, Wang Zhanlin as the army commander, and Ma Tingshou as the commander. They looted and killed everywhere. After Tingxian was defeated, Zhanlin was killed by the people of Gansu in Longdong, and Ma Tingshou retreated to southern Longnan. Han Jinlu and Zhang Yanming both lost power. This summer, Ma Hongbin took office with weak military strength and reused Han Jinlu and Zhang Yanming, ordering them to recruit former troops and bandits to establish two armies. As a result, Pei Jianzhun, the garrison commander of Lanzhou, and Lu Dachang, the leader of the militia, and other former subordinates of Kong Fanlin and Zhang Zhaojia, united to oppose Ma Hongbin's recruitment of bandits. Although Lei Zhongtian was a former subordinate of Feng, this time he was not instructed by Feng. Ma Wenche is from Zhejiang and once served as the political training director of the headquarters. He has no troops. Ma is not a Muslim. His detention suggests that the Gansu incident does not contain anti-central government implications. (29th Dispatch) Nanjing. Ma Fuxiang said that the Gansu incident was purely initiated by one or two ambitious individuals. Others, such as Chen Guizhang and Lu Dachang, although their names were used in the telegram, would certainly not be willing to collude with Lei and Ma to rebel. This is a local problem and there is no possibility of expansion. The other troops in Gansu are all guarding their original defenses and have not moved. He telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday for instructions and expects to receive a reply within a day or two. The people of Gansu have suffered from natural disasters and bandits for years, and one or two soldiers have been wantonly tyrannical. It would be best for the government to select and dispatch high officials to Gansu to thoroughly investigate the truth of the incident in order to conduct a review. As for the rumors that the conflict between the Hui and Han peoples has been brewing, it is not a fact. At a time when internal and external troubles are attacking each other, he only hopes that this matter will be resolved as soon as possible so as not to harm the local people, so that this clean land will be preserved in the northwest corner, and there is absolutely no prejudice.

<p>The Executive Yuan Issued an Order to Reassure and Retain Him.</p>
<p>Nanjing. Minister of Railways Lian Shenghai has submitted his resignation. The reason is that the National Government's Budgeting Office has sent personnel to investigate various public funds handled by Sun Ke during his tenure, and many have unaccounted for amounts. Although Lian was unaware of this at the time, as the successor minister, he faces a dilemma between public duty and private friendship. Therefore, he submitted his resignation. Now, the Executive Yuan has issued an order to reassure and retain him, stating that the Minister's aspirations are loyal and pure, and he is wholeheartedly devoted to his duties, making him an invaluable choice among party members. Since succeeding as the Minister, he has supported the situation with hardship and painstakingly considered the overall situation, which has been of great benefit. Now, with military affairs roughly settled, building railways is the most important work during the military and political period. It is especially reliant on those who are familiar with the work to continue organizing and completing the plan as soon as possible. During a troubled time, it is a time of great effort. The Minister has a heavy responsibility and has always been sincere. He should not be humble. If there are any difficulties, he can report them at any time, and we will certainly help him. The government relies on him deeply and is not just offering ordinary words of comfort. He should be able to understand this intention and increase his loyalty and diligence. The request for resignation should not be considered. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<p>The Two Major Annual Meetings of China's Academic Circles Recently 丨 The Science Society of China and the Chinese Agronomy Society 丨 The decline of science in our country has already been described above. What, then, are the hidden reefs hindering the progress of science in our country? Firstly, it is the impoverished philosophy of tradition. [A gentleman is at peace in poverty and a wise man knows his destiny.] This best represents the traditional concept of laziness in our country. If others can, I cannot. If others have, I cannot have. If others soar in the sky, I wallow in the mud. If there is no other way, I comfort myself with the philosophy of poverty, saying, "This is shallow material civilization. I have a high and unfathomable spiritual civilization." Confucius ate coarse rice and drank water, and found joy in it. Yan Hui had a bamboo container of rice and a gourd of water, and did not change his joy. Modern people still praise him. The fox says the grapes it cannot reach are sour and astringent. This is a representative of Eastern spiritual civilization and an example of the poverty philosophy of our country. This concept has been passed down to this day. The "defenders of the Way" hug the corpse and die for the "Way". They still sing their high songs of restoring the past. The people who are tired of chaos follow and harmonize with them. Therefore, people are tired of talking about science and value spirit. Therefore, the wheel of science is stagnant and does not move forward in China.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is the traditional concept of fame and fortune. "Study and excel, then serve as an official" is the precious instruction for scholars in our country. Because they are obsessed with being officials, they devote themselves to the art of seeking advancement by luck and ingenuity. They render their brains and hands useless. They regard practical research as mean and unworthy of mention. Look at today's students, most of them are engaged in politics, law, and military affairs. They exhaust their minds and efforts in becoming officials, but do not devote their minds and efforts to science. Being an official is not impossible, but the more officials there are, the fewer scientific talents there are, and science will never have a time to progress.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it is the traditional concept of inheritance. Inheriting and sticking to the old ways is often regarded as a virtue in the country. Therefore, the old farming methods are still stubbornly adhered to. The old handicraft system is still left behind. Pointing to the railway as severing the veins of the earth, pointing to the whistle as startling the gods, firmly guarding the old ways, passing them on to future generations without decline. All new things are rejected without acceptance. Although the Boxer Rebellion is gone, the thought of the Boxers is still there. Sitting and holding a corpse, rejecting the new things around it. Therefore, the feet of science are glued and cannot be developed.</p>
<p>The above three are hidden reefs in the psychology of the people of the country. As for the reefs that exist in reality, they are not only these. Our country is under the double shackles of imperialist powers and residual feudal forces, which makes society stagnate for a long time on the ruins of feudal society. The foundation of the old society is on the verge of destruction, and the foundation of the new society cannot be established. On the one hand, the great powers ruthlessly exploit us. The residual feudal forces, on the other hand, revive their corpses. Therefore, our agricultural economy is bankrupt, the country suffers from poverty and weakness, and the people's livelihood is declining. Although the big cities still have superficial prosperity,</p>
<p>the economic center is in the hands of foreigners. And the country is plagued by years of war and years of disasters. Natural and man-made disasters come one after another. The people cannot even save themselves, how can they talk about science? As for a few outstanding people who work hard in research and can have unique insights, but the country cannot use them, and society has no place for them. Long-term talents have no way to show themselves. What is even worse is that politics has not been put on the right track, and everything has no standard. Those who study law are employed in the business world. Those who study engineering are assigned to politics. Those who study science do not have their science needed by society. On the contrary, those who do not study science often hold high positions in the industry. Society has no fixed standard for using talents, so people do not know what to work hard for. Vague and aimless, they only compete for food and clothing. To get it is to live, to not get it is to die. Life and death are entrusted to fate. With the country in this situation, how can science progress? Domestic Important Telegrams 3</p>

<p>The Mexicans Force Overseas Chinese to Suspend Business and Leave the Country. Mexican Officials Turn a Blind Eye</p>
<p>A National News Agency telegram from Mexico City on the 28th stated that Sino-Mexican relations are now on the verge of breaking point due to the activities of the anti-Chinese committees in the states of Sonora and Sinaloa. The Chinese Legation has received reports from various places that nearly 80% of the overseas Chinese in Mexico cannot live and do business in peace. Overseas Chinese in the states of Sonora and Sinaloa have received warnings from the anti-Chinese committees, ordering them to stop business by August 25th and leave the country by September 1st. Currently, Chinese stores in Sonora are practically completely closed, and even grocery store owners are in danger of starvation. Mexicans have banned them from transporting their inventory and do not allow them to buy food freely. It is reported that the anti-Chinese committees are preparing freight cars and plan to force overseas Chinese to board the cars and send them out of the country by September 1st. It is heard that the anti-Chinese movement in the two states is well-organized, and detailed measures have been agreed upon, but the overseas Chinese have nowhere else to go, so only a few people have left the country so far. Ambassador Xiong has made an appointment to visit the Mexican President again to continue negotiations. According to reports, when Ambassador Xiong met with the President last week, the President promised to protect the overseas Chinese, but since then, the activities of the anti-Chinese committees have intensified, and the authorities of the two states show no sign of protecting the overseas Chinese. It is said that the anti-Chinese committees are actually supported by the authorities. It is now estimated that 7,000 overseas Chinese are in a dilemma. The activities of the anti-Chinese committees have been going on for three days. The Chinese Ambassador has repeatedly negotiated, but to no avail due to the lack of real strength as a backing. The situation has become increasingly serious in recent days.</p>

<p>Conservatives and Liberals Support the Attitude of the Party Leaders. The Labor Party Appoints a Leader to Oppose the New Cabinet. Snowden is Tired of His Political Career</p>
<p>A Reuters telegram from London on the 28th stated that the Conservative Party held a meeting at 11:30 this morning, chaired by Mr. Hall, and Mr. Baldwin stated the reasons for joining the new cabinet, saying that the composition of the new government is a cooperation of individuals from various parties, temporarily united to pass proposals for saving government expenses and balancing the budget. After the goal is achieved, they will part ways again and engage in a direct struggle in the general election. He also said that the financial danger was extremely high a few days ago, and a major plan had to be decided within a few hours, otherwise the panic would be unimaginable. The chairman then put forward a motion, stating that the association supports Baldwin's decision to participate in the national government to handle current financial matters. Mr. Croft seconded the motion, which was unanimously passed. The meeting adjourned after only three hours. The Liberal Party held a meeting at 11:00 this morning, chaired by the new cabinet Foreign Secretary, Mr. Reed, who said that there is a widespread and incorrect impression that the fall in the price of English gold only hurts the rich. In fact, the poorest people suffer the most. Mr. George could not attend the meeting due to illness. He fully agreed with his party comrades on the issue of supporting the new government. Mr. Reed also read a telegram from Sir Simon, who had recently left the Liberal Party. The telegram congratulated the Liberal Party leaders for participating in the organization of the temporary government. The new cabinet Home Secretary, Mr. Samuel, spoke highly of the noble actions of Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Snowden and praised the achievements of the British Emperor as a constitutional head of state in mediating the crisis. Lord Grey, who had not attended a Liberal Party meeting since the Great War, also attended and spoke, saying that it was a pity that the former cabinet members and the majority of the Labor Party were unwilling to acknowledge the truth of the facts. In the afternoon, the Labor Party held a meeting and, on the proposal of Mr. Klein, elected former Foreign Secretary Mr. Henderson as the leader of the Labor opposition party in the Lower House. Six votes disagreed, which were cast by members of the Independent Labor Party. Former Home Secretary Mr. Klein and Commerce Secretary Mr. Gretan were elected as deputy leaders of the opposition party. Lord Sankey, who is still the Minister of Justice, unexpectedly attended the meeting. Although the opinions he expressed failed to sway the audience, the audience still listened to him quietly. The attitude of some Labor Party members in the Lower House towards the new government is still doubtful. The Socialist Party, which broke away from the Labor Party when Mr. MacDonald was the leader, is also convening a meeting to consider its future policies.</p>
<p>A Reuters telegram from London on the 28th revealed that Finance Minister Mr. Snowden had sent a letter to Prime Minister Mr. MacDonald four months ago, stating that he did not wish to be elected in the next election, on the grounds that he was old and ill, could not bear the heavy burden, and was tired of the difficult life in Parliament for forty years. Mr. Snowden is admired by all parties for his great perseverance and determination in handling affairs. This statement of separation from politics is not related to recent political developments.</p>

<p>The total amount of £80 million, shared equally by the US and France, is used to stabilize the pound.</p>
<p>A Reuters telegram from London on the 28th stated that the Ministry of Finance has officially announced that the negotiations between the British government and the US and French banking authorities on stabilizing the position of the British gold exchange rate have now decided on the following methods: The US banking group will be responsible for accepting British government US dollar treasury bonds when the British government needs them, and the total amount shall not exceed US$200 million. France has agreed in principle to lend a sum of 500 million francs, half of which is a loan from French banks and half of which is bonds issued by British banks to the French public. The loans from the above two countries are all for a period of one year. A Reuters telegram from Paris on the 28th stated that official sources said that a financial agreement between Britain and France has been reached. It is heard that France will lend £40 million to Britain, half of which is a loan from French banks and half of which is British treasury bonds with a term of one year and an annual interest rate of 4.5% issued in France. This French loan is part of a large loan of 400 million yuan lent to Britain by French and American banks. According to official documents, this loan to England was established by a French banking group under the guidance of the French government and the Bank of France. After the negotiations were completed, French Finance Minister Mr. Floret expressed his joy to the British financial commissioner, saying that the success of the negotiations can show the credibility that Britain should have in the world. A Reuters telegram from New York on the 28th stated that Morgan Company announced here that it has jointly loaned US$200 million to England with a US banking group, which will take effect immediately. 115 American banks participated in this loan. When the British government withdraws the loan, it will deposit treasury bills with Morgan Company. Financial circles here believe that the £125 million recently lent to the Bank of England has been used £26 million in the past week to maintain the gold pound.</p>

<p>Huge Crowds See Him Off at the Pier. Conflicts Erupt Between the Red Flag Society and the Kuomintang</p>
<p>Reuters, 29th, Bombay: The British Company's Rajpura Tama departed today for England with Gandhi and his entourage. The departure was thirty minutes behind schedule. Gandhi wore a homespun brown cloth, a shawl, and a small watch around his wrist. Huge crowds saw him off, all cheering. The scale was rare for Bombay. Before his departure, Gandhi told a Reuters representative that his trip was full of slim hopes, but as an born optimist, he hoped to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>Reuters, 29th, Bombay: Over a dozen members of the Red Flag Society were seriously injured today as a result of a conflict with members of the All-India Congress. The conflict occurred near the pier where Gandhi boarded. Members of the Red Flag Society carried flags with the words [Gandhi Kneels to London] [Down with British Imperialism]. Members of the All-India Congress seized and destroyed the flags and beat the flag holders with flagpoles.</p>
<p>Reuters, 28th, Bombay: Gandhi's residence was very busy today preparing for his departure to England. Gandhi's secretary, the Englishwoman Miss Slade, checked the necessary items, but the process was not complicated. Gandhi's luggage was very simple. Gandhi's group will purchase second-class tickets, and their food will consist of goat's milk, dried dates, raisins, and fresh fruits.</p>

<p>The German and Russian Foreign Ministers Have a Very Pleasant Meeting. Russian-Polish Negotiations Fail</p>
<p>A National News Agency telegram from Berlin on the 28th stated that today, the world's attention is focused on the meeting between Foreign Minister Mr. Cortez and Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Mr. Litvinov. The content is unknown, and no communiqué has been issued. It is generally believed that the German and Russian Foreign Ministers discussed the issue of mutual non-aggression and various important issues between Germany and Russia. Mr. Lee met with foreign journalists in Germany and elaborated on Soviet Russia's attitude towards Poland. Mr. Lee also mentioned the rumor that France would pressure Soviet Russia to sign a treaty with Poland, saying that Russia would never want to negotiate with Poland through a third country. As for the sudden proposal by Poland to discuss a mutual non-aggression treaty, the motives are unknown, but it has now completely failed, and there is no room for negotiation. However, the negotiations between France and Russia will not be suspended as a result.</p>
<p>A National News Agency telegram from Moscow on the 28th stated that a communiqué stated that the People's Committee has approved the report of the acting Foreign Minister, Mr. Kleistinski. The People's Committee today completely rejected the draft treaty on Russian-Polish security and mutual non-aggression proposed by Poland. It is heard that Mr. Kleistinski stated to the Polish envoy Mr. Peterk that Soviet Russia is willing to conclude a treaty based on the following three points: (1) The treaty can only be limited to Poland and cannot involve third parties. (2) Soviet Russia does not guarantee any borders of Poland, especially cannot recognize Poland's current or future demands on the Free City of Danzig. (3) If Soviet Russia is at war with a third party, Poland should strictly maintain neutrality.</p>
<p>A National News Agency telegram from Warsaw on the 28th stated that Polish newspapers expressed their great indignation at the failure of the Soviet-Polish mutual non-aggression treaty negotiations, accusing Russia of acting treacherously and pointing to Germany as being the cause. They also said that the new conditions proposed by Soviet Russia were inconsistent with Poland's interests and obligations. A newspaper said that Polish Foreign Minister Mr. Skorski will arrive in Paris on his way to Geneva tomorrow. Mr. Stone intends to strongly urge the French Foreign Ministry not to sign the Russian treaty until it has obtained adequate guarantees regarding Poland, and claimed that the Polish envoy Mr. Pei was dismissed due to his misconduct and may soon be recalled to the country.</p>

<p>A National News Agency telegram from New York on the 28th stated that the American Diplomatic Policy Association today released a report on the global silver market investigation, which was compiled by Mr. Stephen Wright. According to the report, the only effective way to restore the bank is for the major Western countries to implement a bimetallic system of gold and silver coins, or to re-mint with silver alone. It is feared that it will be difficult to significantly reduce silver production, because silver is mostly a by-product of refining other metals. The reason for the fall in silver prices in the world market is due to its loss of coinage use. As for the industrial aspect, no new uses have been seen. However, for the sake of the present, it is also inappropriate to punish those who accumulate silver for the sake of the interests of silver producers. If there is a plan to stabilize market prices, it should be carried out simultaneously with restricting production.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Telegram to All Newspapers: Jiangsu Province has suffered from torrential rains since the beginning of summer this year, causing severe flooding of farmlands in various districts, leading to the near-total loss of the autumn harvest. In addition, the Grand Canal has risen, and the sea dikes have collapsed. Disaster reports have been received from more than fifty counties, accounting for nine-tenths of the province. Unexpectedly, a hurricane suddenly arose this month, with torrential rains causing the canal dikes to be impossible to protect, resulting in the collapse of dozens of sections. Huge floods rushed downwards, turning the counties downstream along the canal into a sea, drowning countless people. Floating corpses follow the waves in an endless stream. Only the strong managed to climb onto rooftops or tree tops, crying for rescue. This unprecedented catastrophe is the worst in a century. This government</p>
<p>has dispatched numerous officials with boats, carrying dry rations, to provide rescue in different directions. Meanwhile, reception centers have been set up to provide emergency relief. However, the disaster area is vast, and the number of people is large. Relying solely on government funds for assistance is like a drop in the bucket. We hope that people from all walks of life will have compassion, donate righteous grain, and act quickly with a sense of urgency to alleviate hunger and prevent drowning. Contribute generously, either through donations or by raising large sums of money. Expand the scope of public assistance and provide aid like that of Chunren's wheat boat. This would be an act of life-saving grace, more than just providing temporary relief. On behalf of the disaster victims, we respectfully implore you. Jiangsu Provincial Government.　　Zhenjiang Telegram to All Newspapers: According to the report from the commissioner sent to Shaobo for disaster relief, fifteen sections of the Shaobo dike have collapsed. The main dam at Zhaoguan has not collapsed, but there is a gap of more than a zhang (about 10 feet) north of the dam. Currently, the water is gradually receding, about four chi (about 4 feet) below the dike. The people affected by the disaster are unwilling to leave Shaobo, and their food supplies have been lost, leaving them in urgent need of food. We still hope that all parties will continue to provide urgent relief. Officials have also been dispatched to Gaoyou, Shixing, Dongtai, Yanfu, and other counties to distribute grain. Disaster reports will be continued as they are received. Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs.　　Zhenjiang Telegram to Shenbao Newspaper for Relay to Compatriots from Yancheng, Fudong, Taixing, and Xinghua Counties in Shanghai: In recent days, the canal dikes north of the Yangtze River have collapsed in eighteen places, causing the waters of the Huai and Yangtze to rush directly into the lower reaches. In an instant, graves and houses were submerged. Floating corpses are visible everywhere. This is even worse than the Qingshuitan breach during the Tongzhi era (1862-1874). Those clinging on awaiting rescue have already been doing so for several days. Although the provincial government has requisitioned boats for rescue, it is like a drop in the bucket and of little help. We plan to implore fellow countrymen in Shanghai to quickly form groups to request relief from disaster relief organizations. At the same time, we request the government to immediately close the breaches to prevent permanent submersion and irrecoverable devastation. We earnestly pray. Disaster Relief Association of Yancheng, Fudong, Taixing, and Xinghua stationed in Zhenjiang.　　Zhenjiang Telegram Urgent: Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper to the Jiangning Fellow Association of Zhenjiang in Shanghai: The day before yesterday, there was a fierce wind and heavy rain that did not stop all night. Coupled with the sudden rise of the Yangtze River tide, the south bank of Shunjiangzhou collapsed for more than ten zhang (about 100 feet), submerging more than a dozen large and small dikes such as Dongxi and Huanyuan. Hundreds of households were affected by the disaster, with more than three thousand people affected. The number of deaths is currently under investigation. Currently, the victims are sheltering on the riverbank, exposed to the wind and dew, in extreme misery. In addition to making every effort to close the breach and provide relief, we implore our fellow countrymen to consider the disaster situation in their hometown and generously provide urgent relief so that thousands of victims can be spared from waiting for death. Then, the merit will be immeasurable. Please remit donations directly to Mr. Tao Jianming of Yulong Bank in Zhenjiang for unified distribution. With this urgent telegram, we cannot express our gratitude and anticipation. Liu Lianchen, Commander of the Seventh District Security Group, Zhenjiang County.</p>
<p>Yangzhou Telegram to All Newspapers: It is found that this flood is an unprecedented catastrophe, and Jiangsu is a province with many waters, with rivers crisscrossing and lakes scattered like stars. Overflowing torrents cause particularly severe damage. The people affected along the Yangtze River and the Huai River cannot be counted. Recently, in Shaobo Town, Jiangdu, the canal dike collapsed, and thousands more people were buried in the bellies of fish. According to a telegram from the town's business and agricultural association, Shaobo is unfortunate, with disasters occurring in succession. After the ravages of war in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), the seventeenth and eighteenth years (1928-1929) suffered severe droughts, causing families to be separated and scarred everywhere. In the nineteenth year (1930), there was finally a harvest, and we hoped to accumulate resources and recover, hoping to be rescued. Unexpectedly, Heaven did not have mercy, and this year's flood descended again, turning fields, graves, and residences into a swamp. Considering that Shaobo has suffered seven calamities of water, drought, and war, the people's wealth has been exhausted. When disaster strikes, the suffering is greater than in other towns. Our benevolent director has personally witnessed the tragic disaster in Yangzhou. On behalf of the town, he telegraphed Shanghai's charitable organizations, asking for aid and compassion. The situation in our town is already well known, so there is no need to elaborate. We hereby telegraph the director again, continuing to telegraph all parties, to provide relief funds as soon as possible, so that one day's earlier relief will alleviate one day's hardship, and save one more person's life, etc. Zhijiang (Zhang Zhijiang) is in charge of soothing this state, and it is difficult to sit idly by. We have previously telegraphed various charitable organizations to give assistance for rescue. Now, we respectfully implore on behalf of countless disaster victims, asking all charitable organizations and philanthropists to consider the plight of the disaster victims who are crying out for food and generously donate righteous grain and benevolent soup, so that these descendants can celebrate their rebirth. Then, not only will those who receive the rain and dew feel great gratitude, but also Zhijiang will sincerely pray and bow incessantly. With urgent telegrams, we cannot express our expectations. Zhang Zhijiang respectfully.</p>
<p>Yangzhou Telegram to All Newspapers: It is learned that the disaster relief personnel sent by Director Zhang Zhijiang to Gaoyou returned last night on the Junliang and Tongyu steamers, carrying more than a thousand disaster victims, who were handed over to Changsheng Temple for reception. This morning, Adviser Zhang Daorong and more than ten other officials were dispatched again, carrying ships and relief supplies to the Gaoyou area for a second round of rescue.

<h3 id="e67">All Parties Pay Attention to the Flood in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Merchants Request Maintaining Finance. The export of Zhenjiang's goods relies heavily on the counties north of the Yangtze River. The financial sector's loans are also concentrated in the north. Commercial transactions are settled three times a year, while financial transactions are settled at the end of the year. The counties north of the Yangtze primarily absorb goods and capital from Zhenjiang, followed by Nanjing and Yangzhou. The breaches at Gaoyou and Shaobo have resulted in the complete submergence of the commercial center of Gaoyou, outside the North Gate, and the entire town of Shaobo. The water in Xinghua is level with the eaves. Dongtai, Funing, Baoying, Sishui, and Yancheng are also in critical condition. If the dikes breach again, the above-mentioned areas may be unsafe. Qingjiang and Huaian counties, due to their downstream location, are likely safe. The counties affected by the disaster owe Zhenjiang merchants and financial institutions no less than several million dollars. Zhenjiang's commerce has already been in a severe decline this year. Having suffered this setback, business is undoubtedly impacted, and the loans extended are even more difficult to recover. After hearing the warnings, all merchants are showing their worries. Chairman Lu Xiaobo of the Chamber of Commerce, in view of this, yesterday made a presentation to Chairman Ye of the provincial government, requesting the provincial government to provide special maintenance for the financial sector in the disaster area, in addition to emergency relief, rescue, and accommodation. After the flood recedes, the markets in the counties and cities north of the Yangtze can be easily restored, and the losses to Zhenjiang can be reduced. Chairman Ye and the provincial committee members agreed and have promised to assist.</p>
<p>The Northern Jiangsu Water Conservancy and Post-Disaster Construction Bureau yesterday sent engineer Zhang Bin as a special commissioner for rescue, accompanied by Xiang Kaiti, Zuo Yingshi, and engineering personnel, carrying a large amount of materials, to the breaches at Gaoyou and Shaobo to block them. The Security Bureau also dispatched four companies of soldiers to assist, and they also set off together. It also ordered Dafeng and Yuhua companies to quickly dredge eight hundred zhang (about 8,000 feet) of the Zhongmao Youdong end to connect to Wangjiagang and discharge water into the sea. As for the water conservancy and post-disaster funds, the provincial government has decided to transfer 1.14 million yuan from the Guayu Provincial Highway project designated in the construction bonds to water conservancy and post-disaster, and allocate a portion to handle work relief and 500,000 yuan for the construction of the Sheyang River gate as funds for rescue and repair.</p>
<p>Shanghai Gentry Prepare to Distribute Relief. After the dike breach at Gaoyou and Shaobo, Chairman Lu Xiaobo of the Chamber of Commerce, in addition to actively raising relief funds, also telegraphed the Shanghai Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, requesting the allocation of funds for relief. Yesterday, Wang Yiting, Cheng Jingsheng, and others replied by telegram, asking to prepare ten steamboats, thirty tugboats, 5,000 catties of large cakes, 50,000 steamed buns each from Jingjiang, and 6,000 rush mats for distribution in the disaster area. Cheng Jingsheng arrived in Zhenjiang this morning and plans to personally inspect the area. It is also heard that Director Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs has urgently telegraphed Yizheng, Wuxian, Changshu, Wuxi, Wujin, and other counties to requisition steamboats and tugboats, which the respective county governments will send with officials, arriving at the province for concentration before the 28th, for use in rescuing disaster victims in the disaster area.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Yangzhou Handles Emergency Relief After Shaobo Dike Collapses <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: Responsible persons of various agencies and organizations in Jiangdu, and local people, held a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce at 10 AM on the 28th to discuss post-disaster measures. County Magistrate Chen presided over the meeting, reporting on the disaster situation along the Shaobo dike and the process of requesting funds from the province and dispatching wheels for rescue, and said that he had ordered the Public Security Bureau to seal and hire twenty civilian boats to rescue and assist in the disaster area, and to arrange the locations for reception centers: (1) Datong Flour Company outside Dongguan; (2) Changsheng Temple outside the breach; (3) Puzhao Temple outside Xuningmen; (4) Xu Gongci outside Guangchumen. Then, Dai Tianqiu reported on the disaster situation, saying that the disaster area on the east bank of Shaobo was the most extensive, and it was not easy for the boats going to rescue the disaster victims in various villages to enter the area. Efforts must be made to find a solution, and everyone was asked to donate money. The attendees pledged to donate 1,730 yuan. Then, Wu Zunyi reported that the boats had been properly contacted with the director's office. Subsequently, the method of organizing the Jiangdu Flood Emergency Relief Committee was discussed: (1) Ten people, including County Magistrate Chen and Wang Jingting, were selected as standing committee members, and twenty people, including Hu Xianbo, were selected as committee members, divided into general affairs, reception, and distribution sections; (2) Ruan Lianzhong was appointed to be responsible for salvaging corpses; (3) The meeting place was attached to the Chamber of Commerce. Afterwards, a standing committee meeting was held, and Wang Jingting and Dai Tianqiu were elected as chairman and vice-chairman to allocate responsibilities, and nine items were discussed and resolved. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Tragic Situation in Disaster Area and Relief Efforts. After the Shaobo dike collapsed, the large and small towns and villages within a radius of fifteen li (about 5 miles), as well as Qiaoye Dingjiahuo and other places, were all destroyed. In addition to waiting for rescue by climbing on roofs and trees, the corpses of men and women, as well as boxes, furniture, cattle, dogs, livestock, etc., floated on the water surface, which was shocking to see. Just in Chenjiaqiao and Jiangjiayuan and other places on the Yunyan River, which connects Shaobo and Tongxian, the boxes and utensils salvaged by the villagers were piled up like mountains. Many people, including Zhu Xiaoliuzi and others, fell into the water and drowned while trying to salvage objects. Countless floating corpses flowed from the Jinwan River into the area under the Wanfu Bridge and Yanjiabridge. Dozens of corpses have been salvaged in Yanjiabridge alone. On the 28th, the water in Shaobo Town had receded, and the depth was only up to the ankles. The number of deaths and injuries was estimated to be more than a thousand. There were even more deaths in nearby towns and villages. The floating corpses and objects in the river from Wantou to Xianzhen were like ants. Unfortunately, people were fighting to salvage objects, while the corpses were allowed to drift with the waves, and no one could take care of them. As of the evening of the 28th, more than a thousand disaster victims rescued had arrived in Yangzhou and were sent to various reception centers for resettlement. Officials, the Director's Office, the Red Swastika Society, and the Chamber of Commerce sent ships to rescue the disaster, and loaded food to distribute to the disaster area. Chairman Wang Jingting also boarded the ship northward at 4 PM.</p>
<p>Provincial Order Sealing Firewood and Straw. The county government was ordered by the provincial government to seal all firewood sheds and existing firewood stacks within the county to be used for dike construction. As a result, the fuel supply for shops throughout the city was greatly panicked, and the coal shops' profits were tenfold.</p>
<p>Investigation of Danger Areas in Northern Jiangsu. The canal dike north of the Yangtze River has been in danger in many sections due to the strong winds and heavy rain on the 25th and 26th. The investigation is as follows: (1) Six gates in three places; (2) One place at Jimaozhou, about forty zhang (about 400 feet); (3) Eight places in the southern section of Shaobo; (4) Fifteen zhang (about 150 feet) south of the Wanshou Palace; (5) More than ten zhang (about 100 feet) north of the Wanshou Palace; (6) Dozens of zhang (about 100 feet) at the Sanyuan Temple of the Sancao Gate; (7) Dozens of zhang (about 100 feet) in two places at the Hehuatang; (8) Thirty zhang (about 300 feet) north of the Laishou Nunnery; (9) A steep slope in the inner slope north of the Chenghuang Temple; (10) A steep slope in the northern part of Hehuatang, dozens of zhang (about 100 feet); (11) A steep slope in Ciajiatan, dozens of zhang (about 100 feet); (12) Part of the Longwang Temple was unloaded; (13) Dozens of zhang (about 100 feet) of the west slope of Caijiatan were unloaded; (14) The ancient Zhaoguan Dam was steep and cracked; also, the Lihuo Straight Dam at the Honghu Weiyi River section of the Huaishao section of the canal dike was breached by a hundred zhang (about 1,000 feet), and five water diversion dams were all washed away. The stone work of the Honghu Dam was also partially collapsed and is being protected.</p>
<p>Li Mingyang Reports on the Disaster in Shao and You. Li Mingyang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department, went to northern Jiangsu from Zhenjiang yesterday for inspection. He arrived in Yangzhou at about 9 PM that night and telegraphed the province, stating that, according to Brigade Commander Xu's report, more than ten sections of the Shaobo Dike had collapsed, and the entire town was flooded, with many deaths and injuries. Also, according to Chen, the county magistrate of Jiangdu, the water in Shaobo Town was several chi (about several feet) deep, and people were climbing trees and roofs, urgently awaiting rescue. Also, according to Ma Boliang, a refugee from Gaoyou who had escaped to Yangzhou, the Yu Matou Dike breached at night the day before yesterday, drowning countless people and animals. The northwest, east, and south gates of Gaoyou were blocked, and the north gate water gate was being urgently blocked. The residents' cries for help were extremely tragic, etc. In addition to instructing County Magistrate Chen to quickly find a way to rescue them, he requested that more boats be sealed and hired in Zhenjiang to carry food to rescue them, etc. It is also heard that hundreds of large and small boats along the river in Gaoyou were all stopped near the North Gate to load and unload wheat flour and grain. Due to the excessive wind and waves, all the boats suffered disasters and sank. The water in Gaoyou City is now four chi (about four feet) deep, and the disaster situation is quite serious.</p>
<p>The handling by the Pacification Office. The Jiangsu Pacification Director's Office convened an emergency meeting of senior officials last night and decided to send Councilor Zhang Ruitang, leading aides and more than fifty guards, to immediately hire two steamboats and a total of twenty-five civilian boats of various sizes, carrying more than 10,000 catties of food, to rush to the disaster area overnight to implement the rescue of the distressed people, and to telegraph General Commander Liang and the brigade commander stationed in Yangzhou to carry out the same actions, and to send teams to protect the river dikes and block the breaches to prevent them from collapsing further.</p>

<p>Cheng Jingsheng Reports on Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Decided to Elect the Association's Officers</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Northern Jiangsu Flood Relief Association held its first meeting at 10 AM on the 29th in the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce Auditorium. The attendees included Qian Shuchu, Zhou Daoqian, Sun Xingwu, Hu Jicheng, Zhang Yiyun, Zhang Zuwu, Liu Jianxing, Huo Zenghua, Cai Yunsun, Fang Shaozhi, Yang Guangyu, Yang Gongya, Xie Yuqiu, Wu Jiheng, Lu Runzhou, Cheng Futao, Zhou Zigeng, Yu Xiaochuan, Hu Jianchun, Yan Junfu, Leng Yuqiu, and Lu Xiaobo. Those present included Ye Chucang (Provincial Government), Hu Pu'an (Department of Civil Affairs), and Cheng Jingsheng (Jiangsu Flood Relief Association). Chairman Leng Yuqiu presided over the meeting and reported that the association was entrusted by the provincial government emergency meeting to handle emergency relief in various districts of the temporary Northern Jiangsu flood disaster, jointly organized by local people, and named the Northern Jiangsu Flood Relief Association. Cheng Jingsheng reported that the association had received reports of disasters in thirteen counties. Because the disaster situation in each county was extremely serious, the Jiangsu Provincial Government specifically entrusted the association to handle flood relief matters in each county. I am here in Zhenjiang this time, authorized by four organizations, the National Government Relief Committee, the Shanghai Provincial Flood Relief Association, the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, and the Jiangsu Provincial Relief Committee. The emergency relief areas are Jiangpu, Tongshan, Dongtai, Gaoyou, Baoying, Lianshui, Ganyu, Yangzhou Liyang, Jintan, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, and Liuhe. The Zhenjiang is proposed to be handled by the Northern Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, and Xinghua is recognized by Huisheng Society, Huainan, Huaiyin, Siyang and Jiangsu province are recognized by China Jisheng Association. Most of the principals have been recognized. The relief measures for You Tai are as follows: (1) Each wheel tows four civilian ships, and two people are assigned to the wheel to be in charge, and one person is assigned to each civilian ship. Food, dry food, and medicines are stored on the wheel. The number of disaster victims is determined and subsidized; (2) Organize disaster victim reception centers; (3) Please the provincial government to assign two security teams to each ship; (4) The Yangzhou transportation officer is presided over by Mr. Yuan Jimei, and the Zhenjiang transportation matters are requested to be handled by the Northern Jiangsu Flood Relief Association; (5) Please ask the provincial government to formulate disaster relief flags; (6) When disaster victims board the ship, they must register their name, origin, and age, and disclose them in the newspaper daily; (7) Select those in the disaster area where the disaster is more serious, take photos of it, send it to various newspapers, and telegraph Shanghai to borrow a set of photography films to Zhenjiang to photograph in the distressed area. Regarding the news from the distressed area, it is planned to broadcast daily on various radio broadcasting stations in Shanghai to make people in the society understand the tragic situation in the distressed area. Ye Chucang reported that the provincial government held a special emergency meeting yesterday afternoon for the flood in northern Jiangsu, and decided to organize the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, which was jointly organized by the provincial government, and invited leaders of various charitable organizations and warm-hearted philanthropists from Jiangnan and Jiangbei. The number of committee members is twenty-one. Then they promoted Leng Yuqiu and Wang Yizhong, and the five standing committee members of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, to initiate the organization of the Northern Jiangsu Flood Relief Association. The provincial government's ability is weak and its economy is limited, so this association was organized at the same time in order to concentrate relief efforts. All daily relief, accommodation, transportation, and food purchases are handled by the relief association. If funds and political power are needed, they will be handled by the provincial government and the flood relief association. The provincial government feels ashamed that it failed to prevent the disaster thoroughly before and after the flood disaster. In addition to waiting for the punishment, the colleagues will do their best to engage in rescue and relief. Hu Pu'an reported that before the dike breach in You Shao, the provincial government had resolved to allocate relief funds for rescue. Unfortunately, the funds had not yet been allocated, and a tragedy had occurred. The provincial government released dozens of small wheels and tugboats on the 27th and 28th to rescue the disaster victims. There is no definite news on the number of people rescued. In the future, the requisition of boats and the dispatch of boats will be more quick and easy if they are handled by the Northern Jiangsu Flood Relief Association. The provincial government has now ordered Nantong, Rugao, and Jiangdu to set up reception centers, and ordered Changshu, Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujin, Yizheng, Liuhe and other counties to requisition steamboats and tugboats. The ships from the above counties will arrive in Zhenjiang today and tomorrow. As soon as they arrive, they will report to the meeting. The city of Gaoyou is a vast ocean to the north, and the water inside the city is four or five feet deep. Those who died were carried away by the waves, and many of those who were alive were waiting for rescue on the levee. Next, discuss the various cases. (1) Please approve the amendment to the association's articles of association. Decision: Approve the amendment. (2) Please elect the directors of this association. Decision: Elect Leng Yuqiu, Zhou Zigeng, Zhang Yiyun, Lu Xiaobo, Wang Yizhong, Teng Ruqing, Yu Xiaochuan, Wang Jingting, Hu Xuncheng, Hu Jianchun, Hu Xianbo, Yang Guangyu, Liu Jianxing, Huo Zenghua, Xin Lixiang, Lu Jinquan, and Tan Peiyan, seventeen people, to be the directors of this association.

<h3 id="e70">Hunan Province's Flood Relief Plan <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>A total of fifty-four counties in the province were affected by the disaster</p>
<p>More than 12 million disaster victims</p>
<p>Five or six million mu of fields were flooded</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The flood disaster in Hunan Province this year is severe, unprecedented in decades. The extent of the disaster area reaches fifty-four counties, accounting for more than two-thirds of the province's seventy-five counties. More than five hundred people died from drowning, more than 200,000 houses were destroyed, and five to six million mu of fields were flooded. Four-tenths of the people in the province were affected by the disaster, with an estimated 12 million disaster victims. People from all walks of life in the province are rushing to call for relief. Therefore, flood relief is the most serious issue in Hunan Province at present. Party and government leaders have telegraphed the Central Government to list Hunan Province as a first-class disaster area and to issue urgent relief funds as soon as possible, and have telegraphed American philanthropists to ask for assistance. Meanwhile, Wang Qi and Yuan Jiapu were appointed as representatives to go to Beijing and Shanghai to solicit funds. The Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Relief Committee, and the Hunan Flood Relief Research Association are paying close attention to flood relief. He Jian has convened six meetings in recent days to formulate detailed plans to treat both the symptoms and the root causes, and they were submitted to the joint party and government meeting on the 22nd for approval and implementation. The content of the plan includes maintaining food supply, raising relief funds, and regulating food supply as measures to treat the symptoms, and implementing water conservancy as a measure to treat the root causes. It is expected that they will be implemented separately in the near future. (August 23)</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang and Soong Mei-ling Return to Nanchang</p>
<p>Anti-Red Army Operations Conducted in Divisions</p>
<p>Bounty for Bandit Leaders Increased by 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Commander-in-Chief Chiang departed Nanchang on the 16th evening aboard the warship "Chu You" for Nanjing, then Shanghai. On the 23rd, around 8 PM, he returned to Nanchang on the same ship with his wife, Soong Mei-ling. Welcoming him at the riverbank were Chief of Staff Xiong of the Headquarters, various department heads, Governor Lu of the Provincial Government, and other dignitaries. After disembarking, Chiang went directly to the Headquarters, while Soong stayed at the residence of missionary Mr. Ge Xingren of the St. James' Episcopal Church near Lingying Bridge. Yesterday, Shangguan Yunxiang, Lu Diping, Hu Zongnan, and others went to the Headquarters to request instructions on future anti-Red strategies.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the month, Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue have mobilized all their forces for resistance. From Gu Po Sha Village in Taihe, east through Yongfeng Xuqiao and Qiaotou in Xingguo, Yindu Yinkeng and Datian, Yongfeng Liangcun Junbu and Longgang Xu, Ningdu Wangpi and Xiaobu, to the Kutao Qianshan area on the southern border of Guangchang, there have been constant fierce battles between the National Army and the Red bandits. The Red bandits have suffered repeated heavy blows, so they have hidden in deep mountains and remote valleys. According to those familiar with military affairs and bandit activity, the Red bandits' strategy consists of two points: (1) Whenever they see National Army units that are weak, they concentrate their main forces in one location, hoping to seize weapons. (2) If they see that the National Army has a strong force, they absolutely avoid contact, not firing a single shot or shell. Now the National Army has seen through their tricks, so they conduct operations in units of two divisions, and at the same time construct fortifications at key points for defense, leaving the bandits no opportunity to exploit. Furthermore, the bandits' plan is to roam and harass the so-called Red areas of Yongfeng, Xingguo, Yudu, Ruijin, Huichang, and Ningdu. Therefore, their main forces, such as the pseudo-Third Army and even the pseudo-Twelfth Army, remain in the mountains along the border of the four counties of Yu, Xing, Ning, and Yong, using the treacherous mountain terrain as protection. However, the original anti-Red Army air force squadrons, the third and fifth, remain in the province; now the first squadron has also arrived in Jiangxi, with more than twenty fighter planes and more than ten reconnaissance and transport planes. They fly over the bandit areas daily for reconnaissance and bombing, forcing the bandits to hide in forests and caves to avoid their attacks. However, prolonged hiding in the mountains has cut off their supplies, leading to some fleeing and surrendering to the local National Army. The Headquarters has newly established four measures for receiving captured bandits, ordering all units to comply: (1) Reception and placement, (2) Reform through education and training, (3) Implementation of public works, (4) Attacking cities. Commander-in-Chief Chiang also telegraphed all armies, requiring strict examination of captured bandits. Those who capture the bandit leaders Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue alive will receive an additional reward of 50,000 yuan, in addition to the original reward of 50,000 yuan. Anyone in the bandit ranks who reports or identifies these leaders, leading to their capture, will be pardoned and heavily rewarded. Furthermore, according to frontline reconnaissance reports received by the Headquarters, the bandits' pseudo-Central Committee and Military Affairs Commission are both located at Bailu Xu, south of Xingguo, guarded by over 3,000 Peng bandits. After receiving this report, the Headquarters also telegraphed Chiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Chiang Dingwen in Xingguo, and Sun Lianzhong's units in Gulonggang, ordering them to jointly encircle and suppress the bandits, and dispatched multiple aircraft to bomb them, aiming to annihilate the bandits and prevent them from fleeing.

<h3 id="e74">Demonstration by Russian Naval and Air Forces: Account <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Shelling at Sanjiang Estuary and Following Our Merchant Ships</p>
<p>Reason: Direct Export of Grain</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: From August 18th to 22nd, the Soviet Russian naval and air forces suddenly stationed outside the Sanjiang Estuary for five days, causing great shock along the Songhua River ports. River steamers heading to distant ports like Heihe and Hulin mostly suspended navigation. Only yesterday did this atmosphere of terror begin to dissipate. Seeing that there was little danger ahead, merchant ships resumed their long voyages. The arrival of Russian warships at the Sanjiang Estuary occurred on the night of the 18th. On the morning of the 19th, the merchant ship "Ping An" returned from Hulin to the Songhua River and was intercepted by Russian warships outside the Sanjiang Estuary. It was searched in the middle of the river for an hour before being released. The ship returned and reported to the Jiangfang Marine Corps, learning that fourteen Russian warships were anchored at Xu'ergu on the Russian side and in the Feijiang waterway outside the Sanjiang Estuary. Six aircraft were also stationed along the riverbank at Xu'ergu. On the morning of the 20th, Russian aircraft took off and flew over the border of Fuyuan County, circling our border. The warships fired live ammunition, conducting exercises at the confluence of the three rivers. The sound of cannons boomed, and the roar of airplanes terrified the border residents, reminiscent of the catastrophe of the 18th year (of the Republic), causing widespread panic. Unsure of the Russian intentions, the customs office and the Jiangfang Marine Corps urgently telegraphed Qiqihar for instructions, and advised the Northeast Navigation Bureau not to dispatch long-distance vessels. Passenger ships scheduled to depart for Heihe and Hulin on the 20th were all suspended. On the 21st, telegraph communications between Hulin and Tongjiang were suddenly cut off, further alarming Harbin. The Jiangfang fleet dispatched the warship "Lisui" to Tongjiang for reconnaissance. On the 22nd, the warships "Jiangqing" and "Jiangtong" were ordered to sail to Fujin to provide reassurance. Government and merchant ships shortened their routes that day, only sailing to Fujin. On the evening of the 21st, a portion of the Russian fleet sailed towards Boli. On the 22nd, the "Jiangqing" and "Jiangtong" also arrived in Fujin, and public sentiment gradually calmed. Unexpectedly, early in the morning, the Russian fleet returned towards Boli. Coincidentally, the ships "Fujin" and "Tongshan" arrived at the Sanjiang Estuary simultaneously from Heihe and Hulin. A portion of the Russian fleet and aircraft headed towards Heihe, and upon seeing our merchant ships, followed closely behind in a demonstration of force, only turning back after the two ships entered our river mouth. The "Lisui" sent a telegram after arriving in Tongjiang on the 22nd, stating that the Russian naval and air forces were merely conducting a demonstration and that there were no unexpected incidents. Upon receiving this news, Harbin merchants were reassured, and Shanghai-bound ships of the Northeast Navigation Bureau also resumed sailing. Merchant ships on the Heihe route also resumed their long voyages yesterday and today. Although a portion of the Russian fleet remains at Xu'ergu, they are not taking any action. According to intelligence reports from military authorities, the reason for the arrival of the Russian fleet and aircraft is that the Russian Grain and Stone Trading Company has been purchasing grain in the Fujin area for direct export, which Harbin merchants strongly oppose. Russia fears that our authorities will issue an order prohibiting direct exports, and therefore staged a demonstration as a preliminary act of intimidation. (August 24)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Russia Purchases Grain for Export in Fujin <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Zhong Yu Reports Significant Losses to the Authorities</p>
<p>Tax Losses Alone Estimated at Four Million</p>
<p>Merchant Losses Not Yet Included</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: This year, the markets in Fujin and Wei Chuan in the lower reaches of the Songhua River are depressed. There is a surplus of soybeans and miscellaneous grains produced there.</p>
<p>The Russian state-owned trading company established the Soviet Russian Grain and Stone Trading Office in Harbin, with a branch in Fujin, and contacted local merchants to purchase soybeans and miscellaneous grains at high prices. After the Chamber of Commerce forwarded the request to the Jilin Provincial Government, the province approved it without investigation, and also eliminated the 1.5% export tax to avoid losses to the national treasury. This matter had been brewing since early spring, and by the beginning of this month, the first batch of 2 million "fu" (each "fu" being 30 catties) of grain purchased by the Russians had been realized. They hired nineteen sailboats to transport 60,000 "fu" to Xu'ergu in Russian territory outside the Sanjiang Estuary, where it was handed over to the Russian side. The Russian side then transported it by steamboat to Boli, reloaded it onto trains to Vladivostok, and then shipped it by steamboat to ports in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia for sale. Grain-producing areas along the river flocked to Fujin to sell their grain because the Russians intended to purchase 10 million "fu" and offered high prices. In the past, grain produced along the river was transported to Harbin and then distributed domestically and internationally. The economic center of Harbin relied on the distribution of local products from the lower reaches to maintain its prosperity. Since Russia implemented the export of grain, Harbin's commerce has suffered a sharp decline. Various organizations, concerned about the prosperity of the entire city, repeatedly held meetings and petitioned the government to prohibit it and abolish the export tax system. The two Chambers of Commerce listed several points, hoping to attract the attention of the Northeast government. The most important points were: (1) Because of its location in the lower reaches, Russia can freely send ships into our inland rivers. Fujin is not a commercial port, and Russia's ideology is different from ours. This is like opening the door to let in thieves. Not only can Russian goods be dumped into our country at any time, but also there is an additional channel for the import of Red ideology. (2) Allowing the Russian side to directly export grain to develop the markets in Fujin and Hua Chuan means that grain will no longer be collected and distributed in Harbin. Public tax revenue will be lost, and commerce will be severely affected. Furthermore, the specialty products of northern Manchuria are in danger of being manipulated by Russia in the future. After the Northeast Political Affairs Committee became aware of the benefits and drawbacks of this petition, it ordered the Special District Administrative Chief Executive Office to conduct a thorough investigation, and also ordered the Harbin negotiator to investigate the details. The Special Chief Executive Office has already submitted a report listing the losses suffered by public welfare donations and taxes from direct shipment of goods. Zhong Yu also submitted a special report on Russia's transportation of grain in the lower reaches. The report is as follows:</p>
<p>Cost of export via Harbin: Cost of export via Boli: Losses:</p>
<p>Fujin-Harbin freight: 0.2276 Fujin-Boli freight: 0.2176 0.1476</p>
<p>Customs duty: 0.046 Customs duty: 0.046 0</p>
<p>River donation and waterway donation: 0.0102 River donation and waterway donation: 0.0102 0</p>
<p>Dock donation: 0.027 Dock donation: 0 0.0117</p>
<p>Water police donation: 0.0025 Water police donation: 0.0025 0</p>
<p>Loading charges: 0.0343 Loading charges: 0 0.0343</p>
<p>Thread, sewing mouths, and bags: 0.0075 Thread, mouths, and bags: 0 0.0075</p>
<p>Special police donation: 0.008 Special police donation: 0 0.008</p>
<p>Insurance: 0.003 Insurance: 0.003 0</p>
<p>Harbin-?? freight: 0.2551 0.2551</p>
<p>Autonomy Donation: 0.0225 0.4225</p>
<p>Total: 0.6184 0.7617 0.4867</p>
<p>(The above is the difference per "fu," in yuan. If Russia purchases 10 million "fu" in the lower reaches, the loss in donations and taxes alone will exceed 4 million, not to mention other losses.)</p>
<p>Observing the above table, it is clear that the Jilin Provincial Government's rash approval of Russia's direct purchase of grain and stone for export in the lower reaches has caused great harm. Zhong Yu will travel to Jilin on the 24th to petition the Jilin Provincial Government. However, since the Russian side has already obtained our permission, suddenly canceling it will surely require a great deal of persuasion.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the provinces within the customs are currently suffering from a shortage of grain due to flooding, and are relying on the surplus grain of the Northeast for relief. If the surplus grain of the Northeast is seized by Russia, it will have a huge impact on our people's food supply. Our authorities must take measures to prevent this.</p>

<p>Members of the Guocui Society Continue to Provoke</p>
<p>Chinese People Not Allowed to Pass Through Japanese Residential Areas</p>
<p>Municipal Steering Committee Sends Letter to City Government Protesting Strongly</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: After the case of Japanese residents in this city murdering Chinese people, City Government Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng and Japanese Consul Hori Koichi met formally at the International Club. Both sides expressed their desire for a peaceful resolution. Our citizens also understood the situation and believed that the matter should be handled by the City Government and that no further incidents should be created, lest complications arise and cause regret. However, the Japanese acted differently, still seeking trouble everywhere, fearing that the incident would not escalate. Members of the Guocui Society continued to patrol the Xiaobao Island area with weapons every day. After 10 PM every night, Chinese people were not allowed to pass through the areas where Japanese people lived, and Chinese people mostly took detours. Last night, a peddler named Zhang mistakenly entered the area where Japanese people lived and was caught by the patrol, resulting in severe beating before being released after a long time. Furthermore, Police Officer Wang of the Sifang Xiaocunzhuang Police Station was patrolling outside last night and was seen by Japanese people. Without asking about the situation, they fired two shots at Wang. Fortunately, he was not hit. The police officer immediately returned to the station to report the incident to the headquarters for investigation. The Japanese warship "Kuma" organized a patrol team from its marine corps, all fully armed. Without notifying the municipal authorities, they secretly landed on the 24th evening and hid inside the Japanese Resident Group. They patrolled along Liaocheng Road and Liaoning Road every night, ostensibly to "protect" the overseas Chinese, but the real intention is unknown. Furthermore, the Qingdao Xinbao, a newspaper run by Japanese residents in this city, not only fabricated rumors and conducted counter-propaganda regarding this case, but also published an editorial on the 26th of this month entitled "Japanese Residents Should Advocate Proposing to the League of Nations to Return the Lease of Qingdao." The arguments made in the editorial directly disregarded our national sovereignty and provoked animosity among our people. It is reported that the City Government has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Consulate. The Municipal Steering Committee believes that the incident of Japanese residents murdering Chinese people was an organized and planned riot, and the evidence is solid and undeniable. However, after the incident, the Japanese side falsely accused the Chinese side of being instigated by the Municipal Party Department behind the scenes, creating misleading counter-propaganda in an attempt to shirk responsibility. Therefore, yesterday, they also sent a letter to the City Government requesting that a strong protest be lodged with the Japanese side. (August 27)</p>

<p>Newly Purchased Fighter and Bomber Aircraft Arrive in Nanjing</p>
<p>To strengthen its aviation capabilities, the Aviation Administration ordered six fighter aircraft from Germany and twenty bomber aircraft from the United States, which have been shipped to Shanghai. The six fighter aircraft were manufactured by the German Junkers Company, each costing 150,000 Chinese dollars, with 540 horsepower, capable of traveling over 200 miles per hour. The fuselage is entirely oil-painted in bluish-gray. The German instructor Xue Te, who is organizing the fighter squadron for the Aviation Administration, has begun flying and conducting fighter training. The twenty bomber aircraft were manufactured by the American Curtiss Aircraft Factory, each costing 130,000 Chinese dollars, with over 400 horsepower, capable of flying over 180 miles per hour. The fuselage is painted green with a red tail. They have been distributed to the seven squadrons under the Aviation Administration, with three or two aircraft assigned to each squadron. Each squadron will first send pilots to Shanghai for test flights. After they are proficient, they will come to Nanjing. Among them, the three aircraft assigned to the Seventh Air Squadron have already flown to the front lines to join the suppression of the Red bandits. The rest are still training in Nanjing. The aircraft soaring in the clouds these days are these aircraft undergoing test flights. According to Shui Qirui, a pilot of the Seventh Air Squadron, the Aviation Administration has a total of seven squadrons, with twenty-one sub-squadrons. It is now planning to expand them into seven major squadrons, each squadron divided into three companies, each company divided into three sub-squadrons, following the Japanese aviation organization system, and hopes to achieve this in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Over Two Hundred Passengers and Crew Perish Together</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The "Guangsheng" Steamship, which regularly travels between Shanghai and Hong Kong, departed from Shanghai on the 8th. On the way, it encountered a storm and sank near Fuying Island, sixty miles north of Fuzhou Prefecture. According to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s report, the "Guangsheng" Steamship carried a heavy load of soybean cakes, soybean oil, miscellaneous grains, miscellaneous goods, etc. when it departed from Shanghai. It had six Western crew members, fifty-six Chinese crew members, and over two hundred passengers. It departed Shanghai on the 8th and was scheduled to arrive in Shantou on the 11th. When it reached the vicinity of Wenzhou, it suddenly received a distress call from the "Weisheng" Steamship. The "Guangsheng" Steamship broke down and went missing. Who knew that the "Weisheng" ran aground at Nanguan Bay, but fortunately was unharmed, while the "Guangsheng" Steamship disappeared without a trace. The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. agent in Shantou and Shanghai sent the "Zesheng," "Hesheng," and "Fusheng" to search. On the evening of the 21st, the "Fusheng" reported discovering traces of a shipwreck near Fuying Island, sixty miles north of Fuzhou, with thick soybean oil covering the waves on the sea surface. Fishermen also picked up a Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. lifebuoy and rescued four Chinese and Western male corpses. In Fuying Bay, they rescued a Westerner who was tightly holding a Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. lifebuoy. Due to being in the water for too long and being battered by the waves, he was barely breathing and unable to speak. He was transported to Fu'ning Prefecture for medical treatment. The details of the "Guangsheng" Steamship's sinking will only be known after this person is able to speak. According to the "Fusheng" Steamship's report, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. employee's account, and various information obtained by the customs, it is believed that the "Guangsheng" Steamship has indeed sunk, and the location of the accident is within one mile of Fuying Island. The Shantou Post Office issued a notice yesterday stating that thirty-nine bags of mail and one hundred bags of parcels sent to Shantou on the ship, as well as letters from various places transferred from Shanghai to Shantou eight days ago, and two bags of letters from Seattle, USA, and letters from London, England, via Siberia, have not been received by the post office. It is said that the "Guangsheng" Steamship was a merchant ship of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., traveling to ports such as Hong Kong, Shantou, Shanghai, and Qingdao. The ship was 290 feet long, 42 feet wide, and 15 feet deep, built in Glasgow, England in 1902. The owner was a British man named Henry, the first mate was Mr. Bi, the second mate was Mr. Li, and there were four British chief and assistant engineers, as well as fifty-nine Chinese sailors and crew members. The ship had a capacity of 2,283 tons. This time, the entire ship sank. Among the passengers and crew of over two hundred people, apart from this Westerner, at most two or three others were rescued. The loss of cargo is estimated to be over 300,000, which is also a tragedy. (August 22)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Puyi's Concubine Proposes Divorce <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Intolerable Abuse After Nine Years of Marriage</p>
<p>Concubine's Sister Plans Escape from the Palace</p>
<p>Eastern Palace Urges Puyi to be Open-Minded</p>
<p>Divorce Expected to be the Outcome</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The deposed Emperor Puyi married in December of the 11th year of the Republic (1922), taking one Empress and one Concubine. In the 13th year of the Republic (1924), he was expelled from the Forbidden City in Beijing and hid in the Japanese Legation in the Dongjiaominxiang. The following year, he took refuge in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, first living in Zhang Garden and then purchasing Wu Guangxin's residence. His Empress and Concubine followed him. The Concubine, named Wenxiu, was seventeen years old when she married and is now twenty-five, meaning she has been married for nine years. Recently, due to intolerable abuse, she planned an escape and hired a lawyer to protect her rights. The details are as follows: According to the Concubine, in the past nine years in Puyi's household, she has had absolutely no freedom of movement and has suffered abuse. First, the Empress did not allow her to be close to Puyi, cutting off the joy of life and leaving no marital affection. Second, the eunuchs were overbearing and she had to be at their beck and call. One eunuch even said that the Emperor had no kindness towards her and that she should die quickly and that if the Emperor ordered her to die, she could not disobey. Under this kind of pressure, she felt it was unbearable. Her only remaining relative was her sister, Wen Shan, who was the daughter-in-law of a certain Second Master, namely the daughter-in-law of Old Prince Qing. In recent years, the Concubine has repeatedly considered suicide. Her sister often visited and comforted her with words of encouragement. Recently, the Concubine was forced too far by the eunuchs and took the opportunity to stab her throat with scissors to commit suicide, but she was rescued. However, since then, her sadness has intensified. The eunuchs asked the Concubine's sister to enter the palace to persuade her. Since then, the Concubine's sister has been able to enter and leave the palace with relative freedom. Yesterday (the 25th) at 3 PM, the Concubine's sister explained to Puyi and the Empress that her sister was crying day and night and took her out for a walk to relax. They took a eunuch and sat in a car. They went to the National Hotel and entered a certain room. The Concubine's sister suddenly said to the eunuch, "You go back first. The Concubine will stay here and will sue the Emperor in court." The eunuch was shocked upon hearing this. The Concubine's sister handed him a letter, saying, "This matter has nothing to do with you. You can take this letter back to the Emperor." The three lawyers that the Concubine had hired in advance also entered from outside the door. The eunuch could only retreat. The letter was written by the lawyers and requested that Puyi send a representative to formally negotiate with the lawyers. After the eunuch left, Puyi and the Concubine expressed their deep affection for each other and that there was no abuse and asked people not to misunderstand. The lawyers said that the matter has already reached this point and that the Concubine is determined not to return. If Puyi wants to reconcile, he should immediately acknowledge her complete freedom, otherwise there is no other option but to file a lawsuit in court. Last night, Puyi convened an imperial conference to discuss how to deal with the matter. Since the Concubine and her sister had left the hotel through the back door after the eunuch left, they found another safe place. (August 26)</p>
<p>Further report: After Puyi heard that his Concubine had escaped from the palace, he became very anxious. He immediately notified his permanent lawyer to contact the Concubine's lawyers and sent staff to search for the Concubine everywhere. The situation was extremely tense all night, even to the point of searching the residence of a certain Second Master. The Second Master happened to be away in Pan and had not returned. The Second Master's wife told the people who came that they were looking for the Concubine there and she was still looking for her daughter-in-law. After searching everywhere with no trace, Puyi's heart finally died. He also knew that the situation could not be reversed. According to the rules of the ancestors, the concubine should not stay away from the palace at night. The demands of the Concubine's representatives were very pressing. If he allowed her to sue, he would certainly lose. Therefore, since yesterday (August 26) morning, his attitude changed drastically, hoping that the matter would be resolved peacefully and that everything could be done as she wished. Therefore, the lawyers of both parties agreed to hold the first meeting at 6 PM yesterday to formally discuss divorce procedures. It is said that the content is not difficult to negotiate. However, the Concubine's side requested a large amount of alimony, and Puyi's side requested that there be no public statement after the settlement. These two points may be disputed. In short, the outcome of this case will definitely be a happy divorce. The meeting was held in great secrecy. It was easier to detect bandits, but it was heard that the proposed plan had been reported to Puyi by the male lawyer that night. It will only be considered final after Puyi has discussed it with the ministers. It was also heard that after the Concubine left the palace, the Empress of the Eastern Palace strongly urged the Emperor to respect humanitarianism and not to pursue the matter too much. Puyi's open-mindedness was due to the Empress's words. (August 27)</p>

<p>On July 3rd, at 2:00 AM, dozens of Koreans in Incheon's outer district threw stones at Chinese barber shops and restaurants, breaking glass and light bulbs. By dawn, rumors of a Korean riot intensified, and overseas Chinese residents flocked to the Chinese quarter for refuge. At 8:00 AM, Director Jiang of the Incheon branch office went to the police station to negotiate a cessation, and simultaneously reported to the Consulate General. At 8:00 PM that evening, Koreans suddenly gathered a crowd of approximately three thousand people, launching a major riot that plunged the entire city into chaos. Overseas Chinese men and women all fled for safety. The doors and windows of Chinese businesses were smashed by the Koreans, and the police were unable to stop them. Director Jiang and Chairman Fu of the Chamber of Commerce went to the police station, requesting that the police be armed and dispatched. The police chief declined, stating that he had not received orders from the provincial office, so he was unable to comply. Later, the rioters regrouped and advanced towards the Chinese quarter. Fortunately, the overseas Chinese jointly defended it, preventing entry. They then retreated, throwing stones at Chinese shops along the way and engaging in scattered looting. Although many overseas Chinese were injured that night, there were no deaths. Major Chinese businesses did not sustain significant losses. Though the rioters dispersed by dawn, the atmosphere remained tense. The Incheon office telephoned the Consulate General, requesting the Governor-General's office to send additional armed police. Simultaneously, they went to the police station for questioning. In the afternoon, Consul General Zhang arrived in Incheon for inspection and negotiated with the police station. The police chief claimed full responsibility. When Consul General Zhang returned to the capital, around 9:00 PM, it was reported that Koreans were again gathering crowds by beating gongs in the outer district, amassing around five thousand people. Wielding wooden sticks, iron bars, knives, and axes, they searched everywhere, smashing and destroying. All Chinese businesses in both the inner and outer districts were targeted. The rioters used merchandise to smash open doors, then shattered them with axes, cut telephone and electric wires, looted and tore up goods, and discarded them on the streets. Finally, they tied bolts of cloth and silk to tree trunks or wrapped them around utility poles. The police were powerless to protect them. The branch office, upon receiving the report, urgently telegraphed Consul General Zhang to negotiate with the Governor-General's office, as there were no large troops of soldiers and police to come to Incheon to assist. At the same time, it telegraphed the Incheon police station, urging them to earnestly protect the lives and property of all overseas Chinese in the city. At 3:00 AM on the 5th, seventeen armed police officers and military police from the capital arrived. The police were also armed. Seeing the unfavorable situation, they fired two shots into the air, and the rioters began to retreat. The Chinese quarter was heavily guarded, and fortunately, they did not break through. Two overseas Chinese residents were found beaten to death: Lian Kuishan and Li Junji. Two others, Lu Huanxin and Wang Youzhi, were seriously injured and sent to the hospital for treatment. Simultaneously, cargo trucks were urgently hired to transport overseas Chinese from near and far to the Chinese quarter for refuge, totaling approximately one thousand five hundred people. More than twenty others sustained minor injuries. On the evening of the 5th, the rioters gathered crowds of thousands around the Chinese quarter, hoping to break in. Fortunately, the police scattered them with cavalry. Fires were then set outside the city, destroying two locations. The branch office and the Chamber of Commerce sheltered approximately three thousand six hundred overseas Chinese. Starting from the 6th, the situation gradually calmed down, and overseas Chinese residents boarded the Chinese-owned "Litong" steamship and the Japanese-owned "Kyodo Maru" to return to their home country, reaching eight thousand people. The direct losses to overseas Chinese in this incident are estimated at around ninety thousand Japanese yen, and indirect losses are still being investigated in detail.</p>
<p>The Korean riot in Seoul occurred around 10:00 PM on July 3rd. Korean residents threw stones at many overseas Chinese businesses, destroying doors, windows, and glass. Any Chinese encountered on the streets were beaten. The Consulate General immediately telephoned the military police and various police stations to rigorously suppress and protect. Before dawn on the 4th, overseas Chinese merchants, farmers, and laborers from inside and outside Seoul flocked to the consulate to report that the riots were intensifying and the damage was already considerable. Consul General Zhang repeatedly went to the Governor-General's office to request the swift dispatch of armed troops and police for protection. Simultaneously, he notified various consulate branches. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce and representatives of various organizations visited various government agencies and newspaper offices, urging them to ease tensions between the Chinese and Koreans. The Consul General also sent a letter to the Korean Administrative Superintendent-General, requesting that he quickly devise a comprehensive protection plan and judiciously dispatch armed troops and police. By that time, over a thousand overseas Chinese had come to the consulate for refuge. On the morning of the 5th, refugees continued to arrive in an endless stream. That day, Sunday, the Consulate General once again presented four emergency measures to the Governor-General's office. Subsequently, a telephone response stated that Chinese residents in remote areas inside and outside Seoul could be escorted to the Consulate General for temporary refuge by the police stations. The police in each province had been ordered to be fully vigilant. Areas with a higher concentration of Chinese residents in Seoul had been instructed to provide on-site protection. The Consulate General immediately notified the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to dispatch automobiles to Longshan, Mapo, and other locations to transport Chinese residents to the consulate. On that day, the number of overseas Chinese seeking refuge was estimated to be over two thousand. On the 6th, Consul General Zhang visited the Police Bureau Chief of the Governor-General's office, requesting that he order all provinces to dispatch additional armed troops and police to suppress and control the situation. Subsequently, the Bureau Chief came to the consulate and replied that he had strictly ordered police in all provinces to be on alert. On that day, approximately three thousand six hundred overseas Chinese residents arrived at the consulate for refuge. On the 7th, various police stations dispatched police to escort more overseas Chinese residents to the consulate. As of that day, the total number, before and after, reached three thousand six or seven hundred people. On the 7th, 8th, and 9th, Zhang continued to negotiate and question the Governor-General's office. Riots in various places were still continuing. According to reports, the homes and properties of over sixty overseas Chinese families, including Xu Xiuyi and others, were destroyed. Approximately one hundred forty overseas Chinese residents, including Niu Ji and others, were injured or beaten. Over two hundred forty people, including Sun Junji and others, suffered property losses. According to the aforementioned report, the extent of losses and injuries suffered by overseas Chinese residents inside and outside Seoul was extremely severe. The accurate figures are still being investigated in detail. (To be continued)</p>

<p>County Government Convenes Disaster Relief Meeting: This year, Wuhan and other areas have experienced flooding, and Gaobao and other areas in northern Jiangsu province have also suffered disastrous levee breaches, resulting in the drowning of hundreds of thousands of people. Yesterday, during the preparatory meeting for the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, this matter was discussed. It was deemed necessary to establish a disaster relief association. The county government was appointed as the convener, and a meeting was scheduled for 1:00 PM on the 31st of this month to discuss fundraising and relief methods. The county government has already notified the leaders of various organizations and local gentry.</p>
<p>Patrol Captains Surround District Head Demanding Salary: The city and township housing police levy is collected by the district office to pay the salaries of the police in the four districts, with the county Public Security Bureau providing supplementary funding and investigation expenses. However, revenue falls short of expenditure, and the office is already in arrears of nearly two thousand gold dollars. Consequently, the payment of police salaries has occasionally been delayed by a few days due to fundraising difficulties. Today (the 29th), the patrol captains of the four city and township districts, demanding their July salaries, gathered at the county Public Security Bureau and summoned District Head Zhong, surrounding him and demanding their pay, with many accusations. The matter remained unresolved. It is reported that District Head Zhong, feeling pressured and humiliated by the crowd, immediately prepared a statement of accounts, clarifying the district office's arrears. He has submitted this statement to County Magistrate Shen, requesting his intervention, and has also proposed removing the housing police levy to avoid resentment.</p>
<p>Seawall Damage After Hurricane: The Jinshanzui seawall in this county suffered damage. On the night of the 25th of this month, a sudden hurricane arose, accompanied by torrential rain. The tide surged violently, overflowing the seawall. Giant rocks weighing thousands of pounds were blown onto the seawall surface. The intensity of the storm was unprecedented. The next day, the storm finally subsided. Inspection revealed that from the first section of Xitang to the twelfth section, 1,889 key piles had been washed away. The earthen sections had been eroded by two to three feet in various places. Stone blocks from the stone surface and slope were blown onto the seawall surface. The top beam and wall panels of the third section's cement project were also washed away. East of the Second Seawall, the outer tidal flat, spanning five to six li, where salt-making residents lived, and numerous ash fields were completely destroyed. The earthwork at the North and South Pier was eroded, leaving only a few feet remaining. The tide flowed over the seawall like a torrent. Fortunately, the patrol office supervised rescue efforts, preventing a breach. However, the authorities still need to take extra precautions to avoid the danger of an autumn flood.</p>
<p>Major Bandit Lu Yaosheng and Others Escorted to Songjiang: Bandit leader Lu Yaosheng, a subordinate of Tai Bao Ashu, and Yang Azhao, were arrested in Fengxian County. Today, the Fengxian County government dispatched police to escort the two criminals, Lu and Yang, to the Songjiang Pacification Sub-district Headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>Lu Yaosheng Requests Execution: Jiangzhe major bandit Lu Yaosheng, apprehended by the county police force, has been interrogated six times by County Magistrate Shen Qingchen and Investigator Xu Cheng, and has confessed without denial. During the last interrogation last night, the bandit confessed to having committed robbery for twenty years, and his crimes were long known. He only asked for a public execution to end his sinful life. As for Yang Meimei (the woman he kidnapped and raped), he requested that the court send her back to her parents' home, so that he could die in peace, revealing a lingering sense of regret. Regarding the cause of his arrest, he claimed that since his gang was defeated and dispersed last year, he and Chen Qunlin had been engaged in fishing off the coast of Fengxian, and had robbed two sand boats to make a floating home. He intended to hide in the desolate滩, protecting his remaining life. Unexpectedly, Chen kidnapped a hostage in Nanhui and fled first in breach of trust, leaving him with nowhere to live. He had no choice but to temporarily take refuge in Chen Guanlin's home (where he was arrested). He had planned to take Yang Meimei to Ningbo the next morning and make other plans. Now, he was suddenly arrested, perhaps by fate. County Magistrate Shen believes that the bandit's crimes are punishable by execution under the law for punishing bandits, but it is unclear whether the authority to make this decision rests with the county, so he has sent a telegram to the province for approval.</p>
<p>County Government Reports Disaster and Stores Grain: The county government is currently reporting the severity of the wind disaster and the failure of the autumn harvest, based on reports from various district offices. Today, it telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that officials be sent for inspection. On the one hand, the county government meeting ordered the Food Committee to purchase and store grain as soon as possible. It also invited local gentry and wealthy individuals, Chen Huazhou, Song (blank), Shen Menglian, and Cheng Weiyu, to organize a Food Maintenance Association, intending to raise funds and purchase 10,000 dan of rice in the shortest possible time to meet urgent needs.</p>

<p>Police and Bandits Exchange Fire, Hostages Rescued: In the area of Huamubin, Xigang, Wujiang County, over ten bandits arrived at the home of villager Li Longsheng on the 21st of this month and kidnapped Li Longsheng's sons, Li Shunlin, Li Shunshan, and Li Aqi, all three missing. On the 28th, Captain Xu of the 14th Wujiang Water Police Squad learned that the bandits were hiding the hostages on a boat in the Xinkai Road area, waiting for ransom. Captain Xu immediately led a detachment to suppress them. That night, they encountered three bandit boats with over twenty bandits. The two sides exchanged fire for a short time, sinking one bandit boat and rescuing the three hostages. The bandits fled to the northwest.</p>
<p>Fundraising by Borrowing and Collecting Rent: The Finance Bureau of the Wu County government received repeated orders from the provincial government to raise 200,000 yuan in construction public bonds. Yesterday (the 29th), it convened a meeting of bond-raising committee members and local figures to discuss fundraising methods. As a result, due to the difficulty of fundraising, it was decided to borrow and collect one month's rent from shop owners. Those with less than ten months of rent due would be exempt. Starting in September, the rent would be collected evenly over four months. The Finance Bureau would issue receipts, which could be exchanged for bonds. This rent would be borne by the landlords and would be used to aid flood victims in various townships in Wu County, with half of it retained by the provincial government.</p>

<p>Shocking News of Filial Son Killing Father: Chen Genda, a 60-year-old resident of Qiujiutu Chenjia Alley, Duomen, 16th District (Wan'an City) of this county, has always been engaged in farming. He has over ten mu of fertile land and two oxen. He is married to a woman surnamed (blank) and has two sons, Chunquan and Rongquan, both of whom are married. The brothers live separately. At the time, it was stated that the father, Genda, would be supported by the eldest son, Chunquan. However, Chunquan is inherently violent, so he often fought with his father. The day before yesterday evening, Chen Genda traveled far from home, and by the time he returned, Chunquan had already eaten dinner. Genda informed his second son, Rongquan, of the situation. Chunquan overheard this and became enraged. He rushed to Rongquan's home, verbally abused his father, and struck Genda on the head with his opium pipe, shattering his skull. Genda fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. Neighbors bandaged the wound, but Genda was old and lost too much blood. He died of his injuries yesterday. Chunquan, seeing that he had caused a disaster, said to his younger brother Rongquan, "I have killed our father. I will bear all funeral expenses. You will be responsible for the funeral expenses when our mother passes away." Rongquan, fearing his fierceness, did not argue with him and allowed him to hastily arrange the funeral.</p>
<p>Hiring Small Steamers to Rescue Flood Victims in Northern Jiangsu: This year, continuous rain has caused disasters across the country. News of the breach of Hongze Lake in Jiangsu province has also arrived. The dikes have collapsed, turning the area into a vast ocean. Residents in counties near the lake in northern Jiangsu have lost all their homes and property. Old and young alike are struggling in the water, displaced and destitute. The provincial government meeting decided to prepare measures for disaster relief, ordering counties in southern Jiangsu to collect steamers to go and rescue them. Xu Jigui, director of the local Public Security Bureau, upon receiving the order, immediately invited Mao Feng, director of the Construction Bureau, to consult with Chairman Qian Sunqing of the County Chamber of Commerce. He also summoned representatives of the Steamer Association to the meeting for discussion. As a result, the Steamer Association ordered four companies, including Licheng and Xinjiang, to allocate four steamers and attached tugboats. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, they reported to the Public Security Bureau and set off for the disaster area in northern Jiangsu to rescue flood victims.</p>

<p>Bandit Leader Who Shot His Way Out of A Robbery: The home of Liu Zhonglian in Liujia Village, Linhe River, was suddenly visited the day before yesterday by a guest who claimed to be surnamed Chen, carrying two gift packages. Liu came out to see him, but did not recognize him. As Liu was wondering, the guest opened the package and pulled out a pistol, demanding 500 yuan. Liu knew he had encountered a robber and searched all his belongings, obtaining 160 yuan. The bandit then wrote a note demanding 140 yuan in three days, and 200 yuan three days after that. The bandit was satisfied and asked for wine and food before leaving. Three days later, he personally came to Liu's house to collect the money. Three days after that, in Changlinhe Town, he summoned Liu to hand over the money. Liu then reported to Chief Ding Rui Ting, who led a team to arrest the bandit at the Ding Tea House. During interrogation, the bandit's real name was revealed to be Fei Guangnian, 22 years old. The team escorted him to the county. When they reached the Huoyan Field, a large group of bandits came to intercept them. Chief Ding fired at the bandits while at the same time shooting Fei dead.

<p>(1) Committee member Wang Yiting proposed that due to the countless deaths and desperate situation caused by the Gao Shao breaches, a discussion on how to assist should be held. The resolution was to accommodate inland disaster victims by transporting them to Shanghai in batches for easier resettlement. In addition to urgent fundraising by this association, a request should be made to the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee for adequate relief.

Representatives from Gaoyou, Dong Junde and Ji Xiaozhou, were present at the meeting to report on the dire situation in Gaoyou. The original draft of the telegram is appended below.</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram for Help</p>
<p>To the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Industry, and Jiangsu Provincial Government: We received a telegram from the Baoying Relief Association at 7:00 PM today stating that several breaches had occurred north of Gaoyou, devastating countless areas, and that transportation between Bao and Gao has been severed. They requested immediate assistance to alleviate the crisis. We were shocked. While we were discussing rescue measures, we also read a telegram from Chairman Zhang Songfu to Chairman Xu Jingren stating that the Grand Canal had breached in fifteen places, submerging Shao Bai and Gaoyou, resulting in countless deaths and no means of escape. Songfu arrived in Yangzhou yesterday and witnessed the devastation, pleading for immediate assistance. We also received a telegram from Superintendent Zhang, reporting that the commander stationed in Yangzhou had reported that Shao Bai was completely submerged and that Gaoyou had also collapsed at 2:00 PM on the same afternoon, submerging the entire city. The loss of population in the vast expanse of water could not be determined. Xinghua and other counties bordering Gaoyou, located at the bottom of the "cauldron," have also suffered. The loss of life and property is incalculable. This unprecedented catastrophe is unbearable. Currently, the afflicted people are calling for help from treetops, with corpses and debris floating downstream. Many others are left to die. Lives hang by a thread. In addition to dispatching personnel with dry rations and hiring boats to provide urgent rescue, this is merely a drop in the bucket and cannot provide universal relief. We request that you send personnel to the disaster areas to provide urgent relief to help the people. We await your orders with utmost urgency. The embankment of the Grand Canal is two zhang higher than the houses of the residents. In the event of a major flood, the counties connected to the rivers and lakes rely on the eastern embankment for protection. If the embankment breaches, the lake water, approximately 100 li wide and 500 li long, will immediately flood the counties east of the embankment, which are below two zhang in height, and all will become fish food. Historically, the nation has attached great importance to river defense plans for this reason. Now, the Grand Canal embankment has breached in more than ten places, and Gao Bao Jiang Xing Tai Dong Yan Fu and other counties will be completely submerged. Although the degree of devastation may vary, it is estimated that the total number of deaths will be no less than 200,000 to 300,000. This overwhelming disaster is unprecedented. Looking north at the disaster area, we cannot help but weep. In addition to quickly organizing rescue efforts, we dare to request that you appoint senior officials to expedite the process of plugging the breaches. At this moment, many people in the disaster area are still on rooftops and trees, waiting for rescue. The cost of accommodating the survivors will be enormous. We also beg you to quickly allocate massive funds to save these people. We submit our plea with tears. We beg you to consider it. Director Standing Committee members Wang Xia, Wang Qinglan, Cheng Jinsheng, Standing Committee members Wu Yunqi, Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Weng Yinchu, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Gongquan, Jin Houcheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Xi Yunsheng, Lu Bohong, Zhang Xiaoliang, Wang Binyan, Hu Bijiang, and Wen Lanting respectfully kowtow. The telegram to various charitable organizations is largely the same, so it is omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Urgent Telegram Urging Rescue of Disaster Victims in Jiangbei <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Charity Relief Association received telegrams yesterday from Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner Zhang Zhijiang and Central Committee member Yu Jingtan, pleading for assistance on behalf of the disaster victims. In addition, Shen Zhuowu, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Railways, also telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, urging it to instruct Dongtai and other counties to organize water disaster relief associations to rescue the people in the disaster area. The following is a transcription of the telegrams:</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang's Telegram</p>
<p>Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner Zhang Zhijiang telegraphed Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping yesterday, pleading on behalf of the disaster victims, saying, "To all relief associations:</p>
<p>This flood is an unprecedented catastrophe, and Jiangsu is a region with many waters, crisscrossed by rivers and dotted with lakes. The surge of torrential floods has caused particularly severe damage, and the number of affected people along the Yangtze River and Huai River is incalculable. The breach of the Grand Canal at Shaobo and Gaoyou in Jiangdu has resulted in the death of thousands more. According to a telegram from the Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture in the town, Shaobo is suffering from misfortune and calamities. Since the aftermath of the military disasters in 1927, it has suffered from severe droughts in 1928 and 1929, causing displacement and widespread suffering. In 1930, it finally had a harvest, and it was hoped that it could accumulate and recover. Unexpectedly, Heaven has not blessed us, and this year another flood has occurred, turning fields, tombs, and residences into marshes. Shaobo has suffered three catastrophes of drought, flood, and war, and the people are exhausted. In the event of a disaster, the suffering is greater than in other counties. Our benevolent commissioner, stationed in Yangzhou, has witnessed the devastation and understands the true situation. We have telegraphed charitable organizations in Shanghai, requesting relief and compassion. You are aware of the circumstances in our town. We implore the commissioner to continue to seek assistance from all parties and distribute relief funds as soon as possible, to alleviate the crisis and save lives. As the commissioner in charge of this region, I cannot stand idly by. I have previously telegraphed various charitable organizations, requesting generous assistance for relief. I am now making this further plea on behalf of countless disaster victims, urging all charitable organizations and kind-hearted people from all walks of life to consider the plight of the disaster victims who are starving and waiting for food, and to provide generous assistance so that they may be able to live again. This is what I, Zhijiang, will be praying for unceasingly. The telegram is urgent and I look forward to it anxiously." Zhang Zhijiang respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Yu Jingtan's Telegram</p>
<p>Central Committee member Yu Jingtan telegraphed Wang Yiting yesterday, saying, "To Wang Yiting: The flood in Jiangsu Province is a rare and severe disaster. Since the opening of the Three Dams in Guihai, Jiangbei, Xinghua, Taixian, Dongtai, and other counties have become marshes. Unfortunately, a sudden hurricane the other day caused the Grand Canal embankment to breach in more than ten places between Gaoyou and Shaobo, and millions of people in the downstream counties are in danger of drowning. Xinghua, which is located at the bottom of the cauldron, is suffering even more. I deeply admire your compassion for the farmers. I respectfully request that you send special commissioners to survey the area and provide relief, rice, straw mats, pots, and bowls to aid in the rescue. The people in the disaster area will be greatly benefited. I am pleading on their behalf, and I hope you will consider it." Yu Jingtan respectfully bows.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Gaoyou Compatriot Association's Telegram Pleading for Relief <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>"Most Urgent: Please forward to all charitable organizations. We read in the newspaper that there was a hurricane and rainstorm in Gaoyou on the 18th, and the three lakes of Hongze, Gaoyou, and Shaobo were roaring. At 5:00 AM on the same day, the Gaoyou city wall breached 50-60 zhang north of the Dangjun Tower, and the city wall south of Lujin also breached dozens of zhang. The water was fierce, and countless people died. After reading this, we are extremely shocked. We send this urgent telegram pleading for immediate assistance, saving those survivors by sending large sums of money, food, and boats to save lives. We are anxiously awaiting orders." The Shanghai Gaoyou Compatriot Association Preparatory Committee respectfully bows.</p>
<p>The Gaoyou Compatriot Association in Shanghai dispatched Ji Xiaozhou and Tong Junde to report to the Jiangsu Water Disaster Relief Association on the dire situation of the flood in Gao Shao.</p>
<p>(1) During the Qing Dynasty, the height of the Grand Canal embankment was one zhang and four chi. In the years of Daoguang 28 and Tongzhi 5, when the Qingshuitan breached, the water level in various places was only five or six chi. Now, the canal embankment has been increased to one zhang and eight chi, and temporarily added three chi, for a total of two zhang and one chi. The water level of these ten breaches is estimated to be at least one zhang and five or six chi. (2) In Gaoyou alone, according to the census report, the population is over 300,000. Adding the five counties below, the total is estimated to be around two or three million people. (3) The Gao Shao breach is unprecedented in history, unlike the gradual rise in water in the three towns of Wuhan. This water force is like Mount Tai pressing down, coming from nowhere and causing instant submersion, leaving people unable to escape, resulting in many deaths. (4) Today, our representatives are here to report, hoping that your association will quickly provide relief, have a large-scale overall plan, and also ask for help in forwarding the National Government and various charitable organizations, so that they can provide adequate relief. The representatives believe that the Gao Shao breach is a hundred times more serious than the floods in other parts of the country, and we ask your association to pay special attention and provide special relief.</p>

<p>Chairman Zhang Jia'ao's Declaration</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang Jia'ao made the following declaration on behalf of the group: "The flood situation this year is serious. This committee has now established an Accounting and Auditing Group to audit all uses of flood relief donations. In the past, when there were natural disasters, relief funds were raised by charitable organizations or allocated by the government. The situation this year is exceptionally severe. We believe that past relief efforts may not have been perfect, and we should not repeat the same mistakes. Therefore, this committee has established a special group of Chinese and foreign accounting experts to conduct examinations on all expenditures related to relief funds, so as to increase the credibility of public opinion and ensure that relief funds are used properly. We hope that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate. This group is responsible for auditing and will always handle matters carefully to ensure that donations are used effectively and not wasted."</p>

<p>Urgent Telegram from the Hankou Branch Urging Remittance of Funds</p>
<p>The Hankou Sino-Foreign Relief Association telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, saying that the association had hired several sampans to work hard to rescue the disaster victims. The disaster victims gathered on high ground are fortunate to have escaped being buried alive, but they have no food to eat, and many people are gathered in one place, with foul air and steaming heat, which could lead to an epidemic. If one person becomes infected, it could spread, so the association is anxious to transport these disaster victims to disaster relief centers to ensure their safety and prevent the spread of disease. However, the work is very tense and the funds are extremely scarce. The Shanghai association is urged to quickly remit a large sum of money.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Taizhou Branch Requesting Funds</p>
<p>The Taizhou branch telegraphed that the disaster situation is becoming increasingly serious and the victims in the flooded areas are fleeing into the city, filling all public places such as schools and temples.

<p>The Ningbo and Shaoxing Joint Rescue Association for the Hankou Disaster received a telegram from Hankou yesterday, stating that the water had receded by an inch. The Ningo-Shaoxing ship will set sail on the morning of the 29th. They also received a letter from Director Yin in Hankou, stating that the water situation here has gradually receded and that according to surveys, it is not expected to rise again. People's hearts have also calmed down a little. Apart from a portion of the villagers who have taken the ship Ningo-Shaoxing directly back to Ningbo, there are others who are watching the water situation and deciding whether to advance or retreat, and there are also those who do not intend to return to their hometown. Even after the water recedes, the spread of immunity is most worrying. The association previously sent a telegram to various agencies and organizations when the ship Ningo-Shaoxing was about to sail to Ningbo, requesting that they arrange accommodation and repatriation when the ship arrives. Yesterday, the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce replied that upon receiving the telegram, they immediately joined the Supervision Office, the Yin County Government, and the Ningbo and Yin County Public Security Bureaus to organize the Ningbo and Shaoxing Joint Rescue Association for the Hankou Disaster Yin County Temporary Accommodation Office. Personnel from various agencies and organizations have been assigned to be responsible for handling the matter, and temples such as Yanging Guanzong have been designated as accommodation centers. As soon as the two ships, Ningo-Shaoxing arrive, they will be properly received and repatriated. At the same time, Customs Supervisor Jiang of Zhejiang also sent a reply to the association. It was also heard that the Moral Society had distributed 1,000 bottles of anti-epidemic medicine and planned to transport them to Hankou on Monday to help the fellow villagers of Ningbo and Shaoxing in Hankou, entrusted to the association for transportation. It was also heard that 167 villagers from Shaoxing boarded the ship Ningo-Shaoxing in Beijing to return to their hometown. However, the number of villagers from Ningbo is not yet reported. The association will hold a standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 30th, and summons have been issued.</p>

<h3 id="e109">A Discussion on the Misery of Refugees from Mianyang <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghua ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company previously carried a large number of refugees, who are now being accommodated by the Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Health Bureau, Tongren Fuyuantang, and others at Dongting Dongshan Hall on Fangxie Road and Zhai Zhenren Temple. Yesterday, the Health Bureau sent personnel to the two places to administer vaccinations. The refugees accommodated at Zhai Zhenren Temple were from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, numbering about 50. Those accommodated at Dongshan Hall were from Zhangjiagou, Mianyang, Hubei, numbering 100. It was said that the same ship carried more than this number, as a group had already disembarked when the ship stopped at Xiaguan. The disaster victims were pale and emaciated, with sunken cheeks and bloodshot eyes, and their miserable situation was indescribable. According to Yao Guoyi, the representative of the disaster victims from Mianyang, the flood had begun in early May, and by June 17, they knew that they could no longer stay and prepared food rations. The food was running out, and they had no choice but to leave the disaster area quickly. The fields in our area could have been harvested if the water had arrived a month later, but Heaven did not bless us, and we suffered this flood, turning the ripe fields into marshes. On June 20, we fled to Hankou in small boats and were accommodated in the accommodation. The accommodation was filled due to the rising water level, so three days ago, the office issued a symbol and boarded the Jianghua ship to Shanghai. Fortunately, each family of seven or three had no casualties. When we fled from our hometown to Hanyang, we often found floating corpses on the way. We shuddered and were terrified. Now, these people are all without blood, and the children do not have enough milk because their mothers are hungry and have no food, so the children are also pale and emaciated."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Report on the Actual Situation of the Wuhan Disaster <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The First Batch of Over Two Thousand People Returns to Ningbo on the Xin Ningxing</p>
<p>The Second Batch of Over One Thousand People Departed from Wuhan Yesterday on the Yongxing Ship</p>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association, the Siming Public Hall, and other three organizations, recognizing that fellow villagers in Wuhan account for one-third of the business community, initiated an emergency relief effort for the Wuhan disaster. They have been holding meetings daily to raise funds and donate food. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Mr. Mao Heyuan and Hong Xuefan, the directors of the relief team sent to Hankou by the association, sent a letter from Hankou yesterday, providing a detailed report on the actual situation in the disaster area.</p>
<p>The Entire Team Arrived Safely in Wuhan. Our team departed from Shanghai on the Longhe ship on the 21st evening. We received a personal send-off from President Yu Qiaqing, Sun Meitang, and other fellow villagers. On the 24th, as the ship passed Nanjing, we held a meeting on board to discuss the approach. We organized the following ten sections: General Affairs Section, Documentation Section, Accounting Section, Hygiene Section, Discipline Section, Transportation Section, Liaison Section, General Affairs Section, Supply Section, and Reception Section. Each section has a section chief and several staff members. The entire team has over forty members. Hong Xuefan also serves as the chief of the General Affairs Section, and Zhang Yanling is in charge of the Liaison Section. We also agreed on various operating rules to adhere to and to facilitate relief efforts. As the ship passed Jiujiang upstream, we saw</p>
<p>Corpses Floating Down the River. Corpses, coffins, coffins, wooden houses, lumber, and appliances floated on the river, revealing the displacement and suffering of Wuhan residents. On the 25th, the ship arrived at Hankou. The local agent of the association, Yin Huichang, had pre-hired two small boats to greet the team members and transport medicines and food. A branch office was established at Yonghe Wheel, and Discipline Team leaders Xu Guanxiong and Yao Youbang, along with other team members, boarded over ten boats and conducted outreach on various streets. Within half a day, fellow villagers from Ningbo and Shaoxing gathered at the river docks. An estimated 1,500 people wished to return home by ship. Liaison Section leader Zhang Yanling contacted Chairman He of the General Headquarters regarding relief measures. The General Headquarters dispatched over ten military police officers and river police officers to protect the ship. Subsequently, because the disaster-stricken villagers could not wait any longer, the association used the pre-prepared Xin Ningxing ship in the morning of the 26th</p>
<p>Full of Fellow Villagers Returning Home. Medical care and medicine were provided on board, and no fares or tips were charged for any cabin class. As the ship was about to set sail, Directors Mao and Hong announced to the fellow villagers that they were very sorry for the late arrival of the relief and appointed Dong Xinqin, Bao Zhenfu, and two others as reception staff to accompany the ship. The fellow villagers were very grateful. The Xin Ningxing is scheduled to go directly to Ningbo. Those who transferred to Shanghai on the original ship were also not charged fares. Wuhan's weather is abnormal, and the air is full of pollutants, causing a gradual outbreak of epidemics. The association, recognizing this, established a temporary epidemic prevention clinic, headed by Dr. Xie Qigang. The clinic is temporarily located on the Yongxing ship. Each day, three to four hundred fellow villagers and non-villagers come to the clinic for treatment. Fortunately, the medicine supply is still sufficient to use. Since the arrival of the association's relief team in Wuhan, within two days, the people of Wuhan</p>
<p>Drew Great Attention. Although other disaster relief agencies have been established in Hubei Province, their spirit of dedication in rescue work is not as diligent as our association. Later, we cooperated with the National Government Relief Committee on the establishment of a shelter. The committee sent Mr. Li Zushen to Wuhan, residing at Room 4 of the Deming Hotel. Yin Huichang, Zhang Yanling, and Directors Mao Heyuan and Hong Xuefan went together to contact him. Mr. Li and Mr. Baker of the China International Famine Relief Commission were very supportive, saying that although the scope is different, the charitable nature is the same, and they are willing to help each other. Therefore, the association plans to temporarily establish a shelter for fellow villagers who are unwilling to return home and are impoverished. Starting on the 26th, the team dispatched a discipline team to take small boats to Wuhan to rescue fellow villagers from Ningbo and Shaoxing, and temporarily settled them in the Erxing ship. Unexpectedly, by the 27th, another six to seven hundred people had registered to return home. The association decided that the second relief ship, the Yongxing, would sail south on the 28th, with all fares waived. Because some team members accompanied the ship to Shanghai, it had to go directly to Shanghai. The staff members remaining in Wuhan are still actively carrying out relief work. In recent days, the water level in Wuhan has not increased or decreased. The central area is at 52.9 feet. However, the city's water and electricity supply are well managed and continue as usual, so the people are still relatively stable.</p>

<p>Due to the floods in various provinces and to maintain food supplies for the people, the Ministry of Railways has reduced freight fees. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the Jinghu and Huhu-Hangyong Railway Administrations: "Upon reviewing Article 123 of this year's National Commercial Transportation Conference, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce proposed that the fees for rice, barley, and wheat be changed from the originally designated fourth class to the fifth class to maintain food supplies for the people. This has been discussed and resolved at a meeting of the Freight Classification and Rate Committee of this ministry. It has also been promulgated to all railways by this ministry's Order No. 214, effective from August 1st of this year. Recently, continuous rains have caused severe flooding throughout the country, destroying farmland and leaving the people destitute. As the Minister of Railways deeply cares for the suffering of the people and urgently seeks to provide relief, it is now decided to maintain food supplies for the people. In accordance with Category 1 (Grains and Beans) of the Fifth Article of the Ordinary Goods Classification Table, except for eight items, including various flours, buckwheat flour, pea flour, rice flowers, rye, hemp seeds, and coffee beans, which are not produced in large quantities and are of higher value than rice and wheat, and thus do not need to be reduced in class; and except for bran and sorghum (unhulled), which are already classified as the fifth class and do not need to be reduced further, all other items, such as corn, five grains, sorghum, and wheat, will be uniformly reduced to the fifth class for fee collection. In addition to separate orders, two copies of the 'List of Reduced Classes for Coarse Grains' are attached. You are hereby ordered to comply and implement this measure, effective from September 1st of this year, and report back accordingly. This order."</p>

<p>Due to Congestion in Wireless Telegraph Service</p>
<p>The Shanghai Wireless Telegraph General Station of the Ministry of Communications responded to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the delays in Hankou-Shanghai exchange rate telegrams: "We have received your letter forwarded from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Hankou Money Industry Association, stating that exchange rate telegrams to Shanghai are often delayed and contain discrepancies, leading to misunderstandings. They requested that the telegrams be sent and received immediately. This matter concerns the commerce of both cities. To maintain market information and stabilize public sentiment, we were instructed to forward and respond promptly to the situation. Upon investigation, land lines between Shanghai and Hankou have been disrupted recently, and all telegrams are being transmitted via wireless telegraphy. Therefore, the station's telegraph service is extremely congested. In addition, urgent official and military telegrams must be prioritized according to regulations, making it difficult to address ordinary telegrams. To avoid difficulties for both parties, we suggest that all money industry associations change to using express telegrams for such telegrams in the future to facilitate information. In addition to instructing all staff members to pay attention to this matter, we are responding to the previous letter. Please inform accordingly."</p>

<p>After the strike by all ticket sellers of the British Public Bus Company, the 110 old ticket sellers resumed work in the factory yesterday. The remaining 112 ticket sellers are still continuing the strike. According to the company, they have been dismissed. The various situations yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Resumption of Work Yesterday. 110 old ticket sellers resumed work at the main factory on Kang Naot Road yesterday. Public buses on all routes were fully operational. The routes that were shortened due to the strike were also fully restored. Twelve buses on Route 1 (Jing'an Temple to Gongyuan Shooting Range), ten buses on Route 2 (Eryang Jingqiao to Gongyuan Shooting Range), six buses on Route 5 (Sanmaoge Bridge to North Railway Station), eighteen buses on Route 9 (Jing'an Temple to Electric Light Factory), and fourteen buses on Route 10 (Caojiadu to Yinxiangxiang). However, Routes 3, 4, 6, and 7 have not yet been restored because the number of returning workers is half of the original number. These routes will be restored after newly recruited ticket sellers are fully trained.</p>
<p>Resolution. The result of the negotiations between the old ticket sellers and driver representatives with the company manager the day before yesterday was unconditional resumption of work. Each ticket seller went to report for duty and was selected by the company. A total of 165 people reported for duty, and 110 were selected. The company stated that the remaining 112 have been completely dismissed and will not be rehired. However, the one hundred or so people who have not resumed work stated that they are still continuing the strike and hope to achieve final victory.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Promoting Chinese Culture: The Chinese English Drama Society <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Organized by Young Chinese Men and Women</p>
<p>All Dialogue in the Plays is in English</p>
<p>Western customs view the number thirteen as unlucky, and people avoid it as if escaping something dreadful, fearing misfortune. If thirteen people undertake a joint venture on a Friday, the prospects are so dire that words cannot describe them. This is because thirteen is considered an unlucky number, and Friday is also seen as a day of misfortune. However, in Shanghai, there is the Chinese English Drama Society, organized by a group of young men and women with new ideas. They specialize in performing Chinese opera entirely in English, allowing Westerners to deeply understand the noble culture of our country's past and the inherent virtues of our social life. This type of theatrical performance was previously seen only in a few schools, and its prevalence was not widespread, failing to attract attention. Therefore, this Chinese English Drama Society is not only the first of its kind in Shanghai, but also unique nationwide. The society was established on a Friday in May of this year, with thirteen founding members, which, according to Western customs, could be considered the height of misfortune. However, in the past three months, it has progressed smoothly and accomplished great things. Recently, it has become known for publicly performing the famous play "Xi Shi," and its enterprising spirit is highly commendable. It can also be asserted that this group of young men and women are by no means infatuated with Western life.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Chinese English Drama Society is to perform ancient Chinese culture, allowing Westerners to accurately understand our country's long history and ancient social life through drama. For the drama society itself, it aims to elevate the thinking of young people, enabling them to express the characteristics of our excellent nation at any time and to enhance international friendship. The words and dialogues used in the plays are purely in English, so that Western theatergoers have no difficulty in understanding. Its first public performance is set to be the play "Xi Shi." Xi Shi is a representative of Chinese female beauty and has long been admired by Westerners. With this play's performance, it is expected that Westerners' praise of Xi Shi will undergo another transformation in perspective.</p>
<p>Since the society was established only three months ago, many people in Shanghai may not yet know its nature and organization. This drama society is entirely amateur in nature, and its purpose has been fully stated above. The president is Mrs. Ma Jiashou, and Mrs. Guo Anci serves as the vice president, both of whom are well-known figures in Shanghai's women's circles and have a reputation in social circles. The secretary is Mr. Shi Zhaokang, the treasurer is Mr. Zhou Fanping, and there are currently more than thirty members, all of whom have received high-level education and can speak fluent English. The society's expenses are borne by well-known Shanghai businessmen and bankers, and members are also required to pay a considerable monthly membership fee. Regular meetings are held every half month, and performances are not scheduled regularly. Many famous figures in the literary world both domestically and abroad support this society, and it is said that Dr. Hu Shi is also one of them.</p>
<p>The date of the public performance of "Xi Shi" is now set for mid-November. According to important officials in the society, the play is based on the book "Xi Shi" written by Mrs. Wu Liande. The play's words and dialogues are written by Mr. Zhou Fanping, Mr. Li Shimin, Mrs. Ma Jiashou, and Mr. Shi Zhaokang. The material is carefully selected, and the plot is excellent, striving to be consistent with ancient culture. The entire play has now been completed, and rehearsals will begin in two weeks. Mrs. O'Hara from the United States has been invited as the director and consultant. Mrs. O'Hara is meticulous in drama and has twenty years of stage experience. With this expert directing the play, its effectiveness and emotional depth will be further enhanced.</p>
<p>The future success of this society is within our expectations. Although the play has not yet been performed publicly, its reputation has already attracted considerable attention. European and American drama experts particularly admire it, as Westerners who study Chinese drama often lack adequate guidance. The organization of this society is truly the closest stepping stone. What is particularly gratifying for us about this society is that its stated purpose and the dramas it intends to perform are all things that Westerners have long desired but could not obtain. Therefore, since the announcement of the society's establishment, representatives of various foreign film companies stationed in Shanghai have been instructed by their headquarters to request to film talking movies of the society, which is also sufficient to show its position in the theatrical world.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Completion of the Dike Repair in Songpu Towns is Limited to a Specific Date <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The 18th day of the lunar seventh month is the date of high tide.</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Increases Labor and Sends Personnel to Supervise</p>
<p>The dikes set up in Wusong Yunzaobang and Pudong Gaoqiao, two towns, have been in place for years and are the two main dikes to resist the tide from entering the town. A few days ago, after heavy rains in Shanghai, the tide rose, and the dikes in both towns were severely damaged by the surge. Recently, the Municipal Public Works Bureau ordered workers to repair and build them. There are more than 2,000 workers on the Gaoqiao Dike and more than 800 people in the Yunzaobang area, working to repair, build, and fill the breaches, placing a large number of sandbags between the dikes. The bureau also sent personnel to the towns to supervise the work, rushing to complete the construction within two days. Every autumn, the tide in the Huangpu River is more intense than the usual monthly tide, and the 18th day of the lunar seventh month is the day when the biggest tide of the year begins. Therefore, the bureau specially increased labor yesterday and actively carried out the construction.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Disaster Situation in Various Sands Outside Wusong Estuary is Serious <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Embankments are Completely Collapsed and the Houses are Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>More Than a Hundred Sand Dwellers Died Tragically and Countless are Missing</p>
<p>Changxing Sand, Ping'an Sand, Shitou Sand, Ruifeng Sand, Yongxing Sand, Dingxing Sand, and Chongbin Sand, which belong to the first district of Baoshan, are all small islands in the sea outside the Wusong Estuary. The total number of residents is more than a thousand, all of whom rely on farming for a living. This time, due to the hurricane and torrential rain, the angry tide rose sharply, and the embankments of each island were completely collapsed. The water depth in the flat ground was more than ten feet. Fortunately, the seawater soon receded, but eight or nine out of ten houses were destroyed, and more than one hundred farmers drowned. Countless people are missing, and the fields and crops are almost completely submerged. Those who escaped have no home to return to and are waiting to be fed. Now, after the tide, due to the lack of embankment defense, the seawater rises and recedes from time to time, and the disaster victims are trapped in the water, suffering from hunger and cold. The situation is extremely tragic. County Magistrate Zhao Enju and Wang Qingtao, the chief of the first district, immediately sent people by boat to each sand to carry out rescue and accommodation separately after receiving the report. County Magistrate Zhao also ordered Wang Decheng, the chief of political affairs and police, to investigate the disaster situation, which was extremely serious. In the past two days, more than a dozen floating corpses were successively washed to the sea embankment outside the east gate of Baoshan and outside the north fort of the fortress, all of which were collected by the charitable hall. County Magistrate Zhao and District Chief Wang urgently telegraphed the provincial hall and the National Flood Relief Association yesterday, requesting them to find ways to provide relief and release emergency relief.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Russian People Were Convicted Yesterday</p>
<p>The Russian Bik Laviskai and the Chinese Wei Xiaolan were previously charged with conspiring to impersonate officials of the National Government to order military supplies worth 1.9 million yuan from the Laifa Foreign Firm on Guangdong Road, and forging documents and seals with the intention of defrauding money. The case was uncovered, and they were arrested by the Chinese detective Ma Wenda and the Western detective Beibeining of the General Patrol Room. Attorney Ru Baoyi represented the patrol room and filed a public prosecution in the First District Court in accordance with Articles 165, 224, 234, and 370 of the Criminal Law. The Special Court had summoned the parties several times, and the details had been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the date for the verdict arrived. The patrol room attorney Ru Baoyi, the attorney Qiu Fenling representing Bik Laviskai, and the attorney Fan Gang representing Wei Xiaolan all appeared in court to await the verdict. At around 9 o'clock, Judge Xu Jiashi, the presiding judge of the criminal court, took the seat of the first criminal court and announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict stated that Laviskai was sentenced to nine months of imprisonment for impersonating a public official of the Republic of China with the intention of extorting property, and five months of imprisonment for forging documents and seals, with a total sentence of one year of imprisonment. Bik was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for jointly impersonating a public official of the Republic of China with the intention of extorting property. Wei Xiaolan was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for assisting in the intention of extorting property. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized was allowed to be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The contract, the duplicate of the contract, the bill of lading, the draft of the bill of lading, a piece of paper, and a seal were confiscated.</p>

<p>River Water Overflowed, Drowning Nineteen Farmers</p>
<p>The Social Bureau is Handling Relief for Homeless Disaster Victims</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the section of Jungong Road in the Yinhang District of Shanghai, from East Yangshupu to Jiansong Bridge, was overflowed by the tide and rain on the night of the 26th, and the riverbank of Jiansong Bridge rushed in, causing more than a thousand mu of sandy beaches outside the embankment and farmland inside the embankment to be submerged. The thatched houses on the beach were also swept away by the waves. Yesterday, it was learned that a total of nineteen people were tragically drowned. The families of others living on the beach were swept into the Huangpu River by the waves, and there has been no investigation so far. The Social Bureau, through the Yinhang Municipal Committee Office, reported the disaster relief and requested the Public Works Bureau to repair the embankments as soon as possible. As a result, the Social Bureau sent Zhou Minggang and Yan Wenkai to investigate the disaster for several days.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The First District of the County Reported the Situation of Wind and Rain Disaster <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Wu Jingqing, the chief of the first district (Minhang) of the county, reported to the county government, saying, (the above is omitted) "On the 24th of this month, a sudden gale and torrential rain came from the southeast, its momentum was turbulent and unstoppable, and it lasted for two days and nights before it subsided. It was found that the cotton was just setting bolls, and after this blow, it was almost completely scattered. Most of the rice was still in bloom, and after this catastrophe, it will also bloom without bearing fruit, and the autumn harvest is completely hopeless. As for the sheds and huts in various villages, countless were toppled and collapsed. Several houses in the town were also blown down, such as the Jin family's kitchen in Hengjing Beach, the walls of the Public Security Bureau, and the gardens along the Minyuan River. Other telephone poles and fences were also blown down a lot. After the wind and rain, the river tide rose, the water level was several feet above the ground, and the huge waves surged, causing the eastern Miaowan revetment in Min Town to be washed away for more than ten feet. The flood flooded in, causing panic among the people in the town. The sundries of each family along the river drifted away with the waves, and the boats on the Huangpu River were overturned by the waves everywhere. In the Huangpu River, the sound of crying was deafening. In summary, the magnitude of this disaster is unprecedented in history. The cotton and rice have suffered a poor harvest, and the houses have been blown down. Thinking of the people's livelihood, I feel shivering. In addition to jointly devising remedial measures with the heads of various villages and towns, and making every effort to repair the riverbank, I also submit a separate request for subsidies. Therefore, I hereby report the information, and I pray that you will consider providing relief, which is for the public convenience."</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Post Office Asks Senders in This City to Pay Attention <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Street Name Must Include the Words "Shanghai" or "This City"</p>
<p>It is heard that the Shanghai Postal Administration has noted that many streets in this city are named after foreign provinces or cities, such as Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, which are already well known to everyone, but more remote places, such as Haizhou Road, Hejian Road, Liaoyang Road, Qiqihar Road, and Qingdao Road, are still not familiar to many. When the public hands over local delivery mail, they often omit the words "Shanghai" or "This City" on the street name, which easily leads to misidentification as mail intended for foreign cities during sorting, inevitably causing delays. It is now planned to notify the public that all local delivery mail must include the words "Shanghai" or "This City" before the street name to avoid misdelivery.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Repairing a Car: Blowtorch Explosion Injures People <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>More Than Eleven People Were Injured</p>
<p>Wang Daofa, a native of Ningbo Xiangshan, rents No. 21 Annakin Road behind the Slaughter Cattle Company in the French Concession, specializing in repairing damaged cars to make a living. The day before yesterday, someone sent a blue old car to be repaired. At 8:15 last night, a worker, A, lit a blowtorch. However, the fuel used in the torch was originally alcohol, but for convenience, A replaced it with gasoline. Unexpectedly, due to excessive air pressure and the stronger firepower of gasoline, the fire tube immediately exploded, and the merciless flame shot out, flying across the road. At that time, nearby residents were just finishing dinner and were sitting on the roadside to enjoy the cool, so they could not dodge in time, and as many as eleven people were burned. Those who were not affected also ran away in panic. The order on the road was in chaos for a long time before it calmed down. After the accident, someone reported it to the patrol room. The patrol leader sent detectives to investigate. Except for one person who suffered minor injuries and went home for treatment, the other ten people were sent to the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road, two of whom were more seriously injured, and eight were sent to the Southeast Hospital on Milu Road near Nanyang Bridge for treatment. The names of the eight people are Zhang Afang (14 years old, a student at the Sino-French School from Ningbo), Li Maomao (18 years old, a printing shop worker from this city), Wei Xichu, Xiao Er'er, Wang Sanzi, Liu Shanghai, Xiao Sanzi, and Li Asi (all of whom are from Jiangbei). Among them, Zhang Afang and Li Maomao were burned on the face, so their injuries were very serious. The others were less injured than the two. After the detectives investigated the above situation, they reported it to the patrol leader, and the shop owner Wang Daofa was also detained in the patrol room to await investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Dafeng Silk Shop Files a Countersuit Against Pang Zhuqing and Luo Kunxiang <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Shen Zicha, the manager of the Dafeng Silk Shop on Hankou Road, and Jin Liquan, a salesman, were previously sued by Pang Zhuqing and Luo Kunxiang, the owners of the Jiucheng Lengji Silk Shop, in the First Special District Court for counterfeiting the Double Deer brand silk trademark. The arguments have been concluded, and the date for the verdict has been set for tomorrow. It has been noted in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that Shen and Jin have also hired four lawyers, Xu Bingcheng, Chen Tingrui, Yu Naiheng, and Pan Chenge, to file a countersuit against Pang and Luo for false accusations. The main points of the countersuit state that the countersuit plaintiffs Zicha and Liquan were previously sued by the defendants through the patrol room, accusing them of counterfeiting the Deer brand trademark in their capacity as prosecutors. During the continuation of the interrogation on July 10, the patrol room's representative lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the investigation showed that the defendants (referring to Zicha, etc.) did not have any facts of counterfeiting the trademark, nor did they have any behavior of selling trademark goods, and requested the court to approve the withdrawal of the public prosecution in this case. Judge Luo made a judgment of non-acceptance in accordance with Article 264, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. It is very clear that Zicha and others have no guilt in their purchase. However, the defendants in the countersuit actually had the intention of jealousy among their peers, and they engaged in extortionate behavior through lawsuits. They even dared to fabricate facts and file a separate lawsuit in a case that could not be self-sued. Ignoring other issues, the most important person involved in this case, Pang Chunsheng, was clearly taken home by Pang Zhuqing's son Runsan in his own car for a conversation on July 30, and has been missing ever since. Lu Jieshi, the son-in-law who went with Chunsheng, can be summoned for questioning. They now claim to be unaware of his whereabouts, which is their first false accusation. The payment fee check for 300 yuan paid by Zicha and others on April 22 was clearly made by the Jiucheng South Branch of Jiucheng, but they claim that it was a postdated check that cannot be cashed, which is their second false accusation. The Peisen Foreign Firm has been buying the Deer brand from them for four years, but they consider it an ordinary transaction. Only when the Dafeng Shop buys and sells with them do they fabricate lies and accuse them of counterfeiting, which is their third false accusation. The miscellaneous books they submitted contain a large number of payment fees from various companies. It is not only the Peisen Foreign Firm and the Boxing Foreign Firm that are both Deer brands. Anyone else can buy it, so why can't the Dafeng Shop buy it? Now they accuse them of defrauding money in a public transaction without any deception, which is their fourth false accusation. Zicha and others are small businesses and are very afraid of getting involved in lawsuits. They only filed a countersuit in accordance with Article 356 of the Criminal Procedure Law because they were being too severely persecuted and could no longer bear it. The court should declare Zicha and others innocent and investigate the defendants in the countersuit in accordance with the law. It is heard that this countersuit case will also be resolved at the same time tomorrow.</p>

<p>Lu Huang was declared innocent</p>
<p>Li Yuan, a woman from Suzhou living at No. 27 Songshan Road in the concession, previously hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Lu Huang, a local woman living at No. 802 Shunqing Lane, Qipu Road, for conspiring with Li Dwarf to forcibly rape her thirteen-year-old foster daughter, Li Guiling. Because Li Dwarf could not be found or summoned, and the warrant to arrest him has not been obtained to date, the trial proceedings for the part of Li's lawsuit have been suspended. As for the part of Lu Huang's lawsuit, she has been summoned repeatedly. The defendant hired lawyer E Shen to appear in court to defend her. The interrogation has been concluded. Yesterday morning at 8:30, Judge Feng Shide, the trial judge, announced the verdict in the second criminal court. The main text of the verdict stated that Lu Huang was innocent.</p>

<p>The Thief Not Only Stole His Suitcase But Also Violently Pushed Him into the River</p>
<p>Wu Yufeng, a native of Suzhou, is now forty years old and works as a ballad singer. Recently, he was hired by a bookshop in a foreign city. He came to Pier No. 9 in Nanshi at around 9 o'clock yesterday morning to take the Shenda steamboat to depart. Unexpectedly, after Wu boarded the ship, a thief suddenly came and, taking advantage of Wu's unpreparedness, stole his handbag suitcase. He then jumped onto a nearby rowboat, intending to escape. He had already</p>
<p>been noticed by Wu, who immediately tracked him down and jumped onto the rowboat, intending to capture him. Unexpectedly, the thief, in a moment of desperation, used his wit and, while Wu was standing unsteadily, suddenly pushed Wu hard. With a thud, Wu fell into the river. Nearby boatmen saw that the thief was so fierce and were immediately furious. They quickly surrounded him and arrested the thief. They also tried to rescue Wu ashore, who was fortunate to survive. They immediately reported to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team officers Xin Maosen, Sun Guozhong, and Fu Yu, who took the thief back to the team. During the preliminary hearing by Chief Xu, the thief confessed that his name was Chen Rongsheng, that he was 25 years old, and that he was from Pudong. He also confessed to the theft and assault without hesitation. Considering that the matter involved attempted murder for money, he was immediately ordered to prepare a document to be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Why Dress Up So Beautifully to Go to the Vegetable Market? Three Robbers Pre-Planned <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Ji Fuzhi, a 34-year-old woman from Chongming, is the owner of the Hongtai Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 3 Xin Street, Laobaidu, Nanshi. The store's business is not bad, so she lives quite comfortably. However, the woman is very vain and usually wears gold jewelry and parades around the city, which is enough to dazzle people. At 9 a.m. on the 20th of this month, Xu carried a basket to go to the street to buy vegetables. Unexpectedly, just as she arrived at the vegetable market, two robbers suddenly came. One of them immediately showed a pistol and forbade her to make a sound. Another robber immediately stepped forward and forcibly snatched a gold bracelet from her arm. The robbers fled in a hurry. Afterwards, Dong Mingde, the team leader of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, and detectives Yuan Haishan, Yu Maolong, Zhao Fusheng, and Ren Shuzhi learned that the mastermind of the case was Wu Zigen, a native of Zhenjiang who was lodging in a certain inn outside Xiaodongmen. They went to the address the day before yesterday and arrested Wu and brought him back to the district for preliminary hearing. Wu confessed that he was 25 years old and knew Ji Fuzhi. On the 19th of this month, I bought a fake pistol. I was passing by the Hongtai door and saw Ji Fuzhi cooling off. I immediately showed the pistol and pretended to shoot. Ji saw it and panicked, shouting "Don't shoot!" I smiled and told her. Then I left with the gun. Later that night, at No. 16 Taiyuanfang in the French Concession, I suddenly met Qian Jiaoqi (nickname Xiao Meitan) and Wang Sandi, whom I knew. Xiao Meitan said that he was having financial difficulties and asked if there was a way to help him. I replied that I knew a woman, Ji Fuzhi, who often wore gold jewelry when she went out. Maybe we could do a deal tomorrow. I have a fake pistol that I can also take with me. The two of them were happy to hear this. The next day, they met me at a small inn in Dadongmen. After I led them to the Hongtai door, I secretly pointed out Ji Fuzhi's face to let them recognize her. When Ji went to the street to buy vegetables, Qian and Wang went forward and snatched the gold bracelet. The money was divided and used. Now the pistol is hidden in Yanzike No. 13, Youqingli, in the French Concession. Qian and Wang often play in Taiyuanfang." They also went and arrested the two thieves Qian and Wang, and then went to Youqingli to retrieve the pistol. They were all taken back and immediately sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Deceased's Family Claims 7,200 Yuan in Compensation</p>
<p>Chen Ruigen, a native of Jiangbei, made a living pulling a rickshaw. At 10 a.m. on the 18th of this month, he pulled a rickshaw to the Zhongnan Car Repair Shop on Woer Road in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, he was hit and killed by a car carelessly driven by the mechanic Lu Ruilin. The body was examined by the prosecutor and confirmed to be true. Yesterday, the patrol room sent the defendant to the Second Special Court for questioning. First, the deceased's mother, Chen Xu, acting through a lawyer, stated that the defendant driver's negligence had been reported in detail by the patrol room and did not need to be restated. In addition to requesting strict punishment, for the private prosecution part, the deceased's mother, Xu, relied on her son for a living. Now that he has been killed in a car accident, she has no means of support. And the deceased was in his prime and could have lived for at least another twenty years. Calculated at one yuan per day, twenty years would earn 7,200 yuan. She requested to recover the full amount, etc. Lu Ruilin confessed that he had been a car repair coppersmith. He was driving a repaired car out for a test drive that day, which led to the accident. It was not intentional. He requested leniency. Witnesses Xu Guohua and Yuan Baogen, etc., also came to court to testify everything. Judge Xiong Huihua declared the debate concluded and awaited the verdict.</p>

<p>Guilty of Depriving Their Brother of Freedom of Action</p>
<p>The woman Gu Ai hired a lawyer yesterday and criminally sued in the Second Special District Court, stating that the plaintiff's husband, Gu Dingrui, i.e., Gu Apin, was summoned by his younger brother Gu Dingying and his wife Cai on the 20th of last month at 12:00 noon, and was privately tortured, hung up, and forced to write a note for 5,000 yuan. After that, the plaintiff's husband suddenly disappeared and his life and death are unknown to this day. Under these circumstances, the defendant couple actually violated Articles 316 and 318 of the Criminal Law, obstructing freedom and forcing injury. She requested that they be interrogated in accordance with the law and requested an incidental private prosecution, etc. Then the plaintiff Gu Ai said that her husband Dingrui had been summoned by the defendants and has been missing for more than a month, and there is no news of him. However, the situation of her husband being privately tortured, hung up, and forced to write a note by the defendants was witnessed and can be testified by the female servant Zhu Bao. She requested a strict investigation. Gu Dingying ·</p>
<p>Gu Ai · both claimed that it was because his brother Ding secretly sold the property jointly owned by the people, obtaining 25,000 taels of silver, and used it alone. When the property owners learned of this, they went to his brother Dingrui's father's place and told him to hand over the money for equal distribution. At that time, Dingrui had no money to hand over, so he was asked to write a note, but there was no coercion or torture. They also hired a lawyer to defend them, saying that the two crimes accused by the plaintiff had no evidence. The plaintiff's husband actually ran away because he was afraid of dividing the property. If his father had more than one million in property to divide, the plaintiff's husband would immediately come forward. What he sued was unfounded and requested a rejection. At this point, the prosecutor stood up and expressed his opinion, saying that the defendants' behavior of obstructing freedom in Article 316 was obvious, but the crime of forcing injury in Article 318 required conclusive evidence and a complaint from the person concerned before it could be established. Judge Ge immediately announced the court's judgment that the defendants Gu Dingying · Gu Ai · together were each fined two yuan for the crime of depriving collateral relatives of freedom of action by illegal means. The remaining number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized was offset against the fine at a rate of one day for two yuan. The remaining parts of the lawsuit were all innocent. The plaintiff's lawsuit in the incidental civil suit was rejected.</p>

After questioning the girl in detail, she confirmed that her stepmother had indeed beaten her, but that she was not lacking in food or clothing.

<p>Zheng Chenggong, Prince Yanping of Ming Dynasty, fought against the Manchus and opened up Taiwan at the end of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>His great achievements are worthy of being a great national hero. However, the records of his life were mostly slanderous in the official Qing Dynasty records, and the writings of private individuals were mostly based on hearsay and unreliable. Fortunately, Yang Ying, the director of the Ministry of Revenue under Yanping at that time, compiled the Veritable Records based on his personal observations, recording events year by year and month by month in detail. The records are particularly detailed on military and financial matters. Among them, Yanping's letters to the Manchus and his father, Zhilong, are full of loyalty and righteousness, and seven or eight out of ten are not found in other books, making them particularly valuable. The book was secretly treasured by Zheng's descendants for generations. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Wu Huqian, the battalion commander of Qin Wangshan's army of the Fujian Autonomous Army, obtained it in Nan'an Shijing Township, the former residence of Yanping. Qin entrusted it to Li Hanqing, the director of the Xiamen Kulangsu Private Zhongshan Library, for collation and preservation. Recently, Li obtained Qin's consent to entrust the Institute of History and Philology of the National Academia Sinica to photographically reproduce the original book, so that this credible history can be circulated among people. The original name of the book was Veritable Records of Yanping, but the institute changed it to "Veritable Records of Yang Ying, the Yanping Household Official's Conquest," and Zhu Xizu wrote a long preface to authenticate it. It has now been published, and each copy is sold for two silver dollars. All branches of the Commercial Press in various cities are acting as agents. This is also a fortunate event for national history.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I am utterly astonished to read in your newspaper about Commander Xiong donating his salary to repair roads.

I have not been involved in this matter, nor have I made any donations. Therefore, I respectfully request that your newspaper make a factual correction to maintain your reputation.

<p>Ma Yinchu Presides Over Economic Meetings, Yu Shicheng Speaks on Economic Panic</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China Economic Society held an election meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. About 50 members attended and elected He Dehui as chairman. Dai Ruru reported on the society's affairs for the past six months, and Cai Chengxin reported on the accounts. Then, ballots were distributed to elect five directors for the next term. There were 47 votes, with one invalid vote. As a result, He Dehui received 34 votes, Dai Kehai 32 votes, Zhao Jun 27 votes, Cai Chengxin 27 votes, and Wang Zhixin 22 votes. Xu Jiqing, Zhu Yinong, Yu Shicheng, Li Ming, and Yang Rumei received the next highest number of votes. Then, Ma Yinchu gave a speech on "New Economic Thoughts and the China Economic Society," advocating for cooperation between officials and the public to convene an economic conference to solve the current important economic problems. Subsequently, Li Zhaoren reported that Jiaotong University will hold its 35th anniversary celebration on December 12th of this year and will hold an exhibition for 22 days, inviting the society to participate in the exhibition. This was approved after discussion. The detailed methods for participating in the exhibition will be determined by the board of directors and a report will be submitted for further approval later this year. Then, Yu Shicheng gave a speech on the issue of American wheat and cotton loans, advocating that domestic industrialists should work with the government to guarantee the loans to facilitate regulation. The current government is only borrowing wheat to provide food for the people, but it also needs to borrow cotton to provide clothing for the people. Especially in response to this flood disaster, the whole country must be mobilized to save the disaster to alleviate the future difficulties of the national disaster relief. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau previously received a joint petition from citizens Li Keping and Liu Xuechu of Shenxing Town, Yinhang District, requesting that the private Rural First Elementary School, which had been closed, be taken over by the city to facilitate children's enrollment. After sending personnel to investigate and reply, it was found that there were many school-age children in the area, and the closure of the school did cause many children to be out of school. The closed private Rural First Elementary School has now been taken over by the Municipal Education Bureau and renamed the Municipal Rural Elementary School. Two classrooms have been temporarily set up for teaching, and Wang Renmin has been temporarily appointed as the acting principal of the school.</p>

<p>The Rotary Cup International Tennis has reached the final stage. The finals between China and Japan began yesterday. More than 2,000 spectators surrounded the China Tennis Court, and the number of people who were turned away was countless. The results of the first and second singles matches were: Xing Feihai lost to Hyotare in one to three matches, this regret will never be repaid. During the match between Zhang Daokang and Machida, when Qiu failed, the situation was two to two on average. Moreover, Machida took the lead in the fifth set with a score of two to zero. The atmosphere was tense, and unparalleled. If China loses both singles matches, the Chinese team will be finished. Fortunately, Jiang Daozhang won with a score of seven to five after five to five at this critical juncture, and won the fifth set with a score of three to one against Machida. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, China and Japan will compete in the doubles match. Whichever team wins will win the championship.

<h3 id="e175">俵氏 (Hyooji) Wins Against Qiu Feihai with a Score of Three to One <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>丨 Hyooji Sekio Lives Up to His Reputation as a Renowned Player 丨</p>
<p>(6丨2)</p>
<p>Hyooji Sekio (Japan) (6丨1) Qiu Feihai (China)</p>
<p>(3丨6)</p>
<p>(6丨4)</p>
<p>Qiu and Hyooji are both giants among Shanghai's tennis players, and also national players for China and Japan. Their superb skills are obvious to all. However, people are eager to know how much each has improved in the past year. Yesterday, both players, bearing the mission of representing their countries, participated in the first singles match of the Rotary Cup final. They gave their all to bring glory to their country and compete for personal honor, which was inevitable. The more than a thousand spectators were not there by chance. After a great battle, Hyooji Sekio surprisingly defeated Qiu Feihai by a score of three to one. The audience regarded it as a result of skill, not luck. Mr. Qiu shook hands to congratulate him, also sighing in admiration.</p>
<p>On average, Hyooji excelled in defending the baseline, hitting shots left and right, both offensively and defensively. He occasionally went to the net and showed good control, ran quickly, and had a powerful serve, which was his specialty. Mr. Qiu's favored forehand shots were not seen as often, and sometimes he tried to use them, which felt formidable. However, his serves were missed, and his footwork was slow, which was the main reason for his defeat. However, he was good at using clever force, often using softness to overcome hardness, which Hyooji could not avoid. On average, Hyooji was superior.</p>
<p>The two heroes, in a situation of "deep water and scorching fire," entered the arena holding their rackets, receiving a warm welcome from the audience. After a brief warm-up, the battle began. Mr. Qiu took to the court to gain momentum, but was intercepted by Hyooji, resulting in a score of two. In the third game, Mr. Qiu used all his skills to control the overall situation, moving left, right, forward, and backward at will, seeming to have returned to the golden age when he first came to China. Applause was endless, and he was at the peak of his success. He secured the third game. However, after this, Hyooji was superior in every way, plunging Mr. Qiu into a state of "deep water and scorching fire." He completed eight games in one go, winning the first set six to two. He then took a three-to-zero lead in the second set. Mr. Qiu struggled to cope, initially winning back one game, but then a storm suddenly arrived, like a body after being robbed and brutally ravaged. The subsequent three games unexpectedly went to Hyooji again, making him the victor. Hyooji won the second set six to one again.</p>
<p>Trying to Reverse Misfortune, Mr. Qiu lost two sets. The audience was worried about him, but Mr. Qiu remained calm, showing a spirit of reversing misfortune. He was energetic and strong. After two games, he won two more games, constantly striving forward without setbacks. Hyooji was trapped under the opponent's powerful hand, allowing himself to be whittled away. In the end, with a score of three to six, he lost the third set to Mr. Qiu. After a ten-minute break, the fourth set began. Mr. Qiu, despite losing with a score of zero to three, managed to win a game. The audience's spirits soared, congratulating each other. In the second game, he cleanly won again, causing a great shout, as if victory was within reach. Hyooji's expression changed. He perked up and tied the score at two-two. Then, Mr. Qiu won another game, and Hyooji tied it again, even surpassing him. Mr. Qiu showed his power, tying the score at four-four. At that time, the situation was tense, and the atmosphere changed. Mr. Qiu's misfortune came again, losing two consecutive games, eventually losing the fourth set with a score of four to six.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Jiang Daozhang Wins Against Machida Only After Five Sets <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>丨 Jiang Daozhang Had a Hard Time 丨</p>
<p>(Six to Two)</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang (China) (Six to Four) Machida (Japan)</p>
<p>(Three to Six)</p>
<p>(Zero to Six)</p>
<p>(Seven to Five)</p>
<p>The battle between Jiang Daozhang and Machida was crucial in the final. If Jiang won against Machida, the Chinese team would still have a chance in the doubles match. Since Qiu could not win both singles matches, if Jiang lost to Machida, even if China won the doubles, it would be in vain. Therefore, after Qiu's defeat, the attention of the entire audience was focused on Jiang and Machida. Fortunately, Jiang Daozhang finally defeated Machida amidst the rough seas and dangerous waves, carving out a path to survival for the Chinese team.</p>
<p>Slightly Lacking Control, based on Jiang's qualifications and skills, Machida was not his opponent. However, after smoothly winning two sets, Jiang suffered two consecutive defeats, giving the Japanese a chance to win. Moreover, in the fifth set, when Jiang had an excellent lead of five to two, he allowed Machida to tie the score at five to five. The reason was none other than his lack of control. Jiang consistently outperformed Machida in serving, hitting, and intercepting, and gave a wonderful performance in the first two sets. As for Machida, he displayed purely Japanese strengths, excelling in baseline rallies and possessing great stamina. When we look at his skills from last year and the rapid progress he has made this autumn, we cannot help but be amazed. In short, Jiang Daozhang was able to salvage the final victory from a slump, which can only be described as fortunate.</p>
<p>Sudden Turmoil, Machida served first, and Jiang won consecutively, winning three games. Machida only won the fourth and fifth games. In the first set, Jiang won decisively with six to two. In the second set, Jiang continued to use powerful angled shots, baseline rallies, and net interceptions, taking a commanding lead of five to two. Although Machida won two more games, Jiang still won again with six to four. Unexpectedly, amidst a smooth sailing, shocking waves and furious tides suddenly arose before him, and the firm and strong foundation suddenly showed signs of shaking. People were panic-stricken, wondering if there was a chance for survival. In the third set, Jiang fell behind with three to four, and then lost ten consecutive games, losing the third set with three to six, and the fourth set with zero to six in a devastating defeat. Thus, the life of the Chinese team depended on this final set.</p>
<p>Victory Amidst Danger, the fifth set began, and the sky was already growing dark. Qiu Feihai had already declared his defeat. Both Jiang and Machida were exhausted, and no one was sure who would win. Machida took a lead of two to zero. Everyone wondered whether Jiang could win. Jiang Daozhang, realizing the importance of his mission, rallied his spirits and exerted all his remaining strength, hitting hard and putting on heavy pressure, winning five consecutive games, creating a confident lead of five to two. However, after the fierce attack, he overexerted himself, and his control was poor. The ball touched the net one after another, and Machida suddenly tied the score at five to five. Dusk had already fallen, the light was very poor.</p>
<p>The two competed for victory and defeat in the dim evening light. After the two games were tied several times, Jiang finally won the final victory with seven to five, making the total score three to two.</p>

<p>丨 Winning the Doubles Is Equivalent to Winning the Championship</p>
<p>Today is the second day of the final. Starting at 4 PM this afternoon, Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang will fight against the Japanese pair of Hyooji Sekio and Machida. Whoever wins will win the championship. Since China and Japan have each won a group, and the last two singles matches will each win one as well, Qiu Feihai will definitely win against Machida, and Jiang Daozhang will definitely lose to Hyooji. Therefore, today's doubles match is equivalent to solving the championship. Judging from their strength, Qiu and Hyooji are evenly matched, and the performance of Jiang Daozhang and Machida will determine the outcome. In view of the crowding of spectators yesterday, the Association has set up reserved seats today, costing two yuan per seat. Scattered seats will still be sold in two types: one yuan and six jiao.</p>

<p>— Mengdie</p>
<p>The organization of an entire family consists of those who are naturally united, such as fathers and sons, brothers, and those who are united by human effort, such as mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, husbands and wives. Theoretically, those united by human effort are difficult to unite, but the easiest to unite are husbands and wives. Therefore, love is omnipotent. Those naturally united are easy to unite, but the most difficult to unite are brothers. Therefore, money is the root of all evil.</p>
<p>The maintenance of ethics is rooted in a single word: love. However, only parents' love for their children is unconditional. They do not love their children only after they are virtuous and filial. Even if they know that their children will grow up to be unfilial, they still love them. Other relationships, such as husbands and wives, are based on conditional love. There is no such thing as a one-sided relationship. Why do people love their wives more than their parents? Isn't this a reversal of priorities?</p>
<p>Everyone has their abilities and inabilities. This statement is most accurate. It shows that people's talents are not superior or inferior, but only differ in the focus of their effort. Consider the masters of Weiqi and Mahjong. They did not achieve their skills overnight. If they applied their effort to studying, then the gamblers would all be respected scholars.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Ancient Beast Teeth <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Moyi</p>
<p>Mr. Anders, an American zoologist and leader of the Central Asian expedition, recently published an article in the London Illustrated News about the discovery of teeth of extinct ancient beasts. I have translated it as follows for the study of archaeologists.</p>
<p>About two million years ago, there was a large lake in eastern Mongolia, almost as large as present-day Lake Michigan (Lakemicbigan, located in North America with an area of 25,600 square miles). It was discovered by the Central Asian Exploration Team in the summer of 1928. Of course, the lake water had dried up, and only a few traces of the lake shore could be faintly seen. We stayed there for two weeks. Mr. Schell, a geologist, excavated a flat, basin-like object, about ten inches long, eight inches wide, and three-quarters of an inch thick. After repeated study, we realized that it was a tooth. But we were still in the dark about what kind of animal's tooth it was. We continued to excavate, and within three days, we excavated more than a dozen of them.</p>
<p>Later, we returned to Beiping, then to Shanghai, and returned to the United States. After research by archaeologists in various countries, it was determined that it was the giant tooth of an extinct ancient beast. In the United States, we continued to study for two years. Many famous archaeologists unanimously confirmed that it was this type of tooth. There were quite a few. So, in the spring of 1930, our entire team returned to the original location to explore.</p>
<p>Our tents were still stationed on the lake shore. In front of the tents, there was a small river crossing in the distance. Behind us was a large desert. There, in addition to small antelopes, there were no Mongolians. Wolves often attacked us in packs all over the mountains and fields. Fortunately, we all had guns, and we even killed twenty or thirty wolves at once. Only then did their momentum subside slightly. So we call it "Wolf Village." But the small antelopes were very beneficial to us. We considered their milk to be a supreme beverage.</p>
<p>One day, about six miles from the tents, we excavated six molars of giant beasts, even larger than those excavated in 1928. Therefore, we concluded that this must be a cemetery where giant beasts buried their teeth. But because this place was not soil, but very solid rock, it was difficult to excavate, let alone for people. Even using explosives to blast it felt difficult. But we didn't dare to use explosives, fearing that it would damage our objective. There was no way to think about it. We could only chop the stones little by little, like carving. Thus, the secrets of three million years ago were revealed to us.</p>
<p>After more than two months of excavation work, we obtained a large number of teeth, some shaped like stone mortars, some shaped like , and some shaped like spoons. We also excavated many ribs, vertebrae, skulls, and bones of the limbs. We put them together like jigsaw puzzles to form forty terrifying ancient beasts (all males). Their shape was similar to the elephants we commonly see now, but their massive bodies were far beyond that.</p>
<p>In another place, we also discovered many young and female giant beasts. According to experts, when this lake did not dry up at first, there were probably many young giant beasts who came to drink water and unfortunately fell and drowned. Their mothers also sacrificed their lives to save their little lives. So, there were quite a few females as well. Therefore, it was also determined that they were mammals, which is evidenced by the fact that there are many mammals there today, such as small antelopes, foxes, wolves, and carnivores. Perhaps it is not very arbitrary.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Strange News Amidst the Flood <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Qian</p>
<p>The severity of this year's flood and the vastness of the affected areas are truly unprecedented in a century. As a result, all kinds of strange and unusual events have occurred that are beyond expectations. I recently met a returnee from a river port who talked about the Wang family's three children who drifted three hundred miles in front of the Wangjiang Tower during the flood. It was particularly shocking. If you meet a superstitious person, they will definitely say that there is divine protection in the dark. I will record its beginning and end as follows.</p>
<p>The three Wang children are brothers. Their original hometown is Wanggang, She County. Their father's name is Jian Tai, who is a boatman by profession. The eldest son is named Tian Zhao, who is sixteen years old. The second son is named Tian Pei, who is fourteen years old. The third son is named Tian Song, who is twelve years old. The fourth son is named Tian Bai, who is only eight years old. On this day, because an old boat was being repaired in the river about ten miles away from Wanggang, Jian Tai and his wife and several children went to supervise the work. Tian Song alone did not go with them. Later, Jian Tai and his wife also returned home. Tian Zhao, Tian Pei, and Tian Bai stayed there. That place was originally a tributary of a large river. The river surface was narrow and shallow, and it was often dry. But this year, there was a lot of rain, and the ditches were all full, so the boat could be repaired. The boat workers were negligent and did not tie the cable. They thought that this large boat was moored in a small river, so they did not expect anything else to happen. When it was dusk, they sat on the bow of the boat to cool off. The sky suddenly changed, the wind rose and the clouds surged. They heard the sound of water like thunder. Before long, the flood swelled up, as if overturning mountains and toppling seas, rushing in torrents. The boat was suddenly lifted up and could not control itself. Everyone was frightened and lost their heads. They each took oars on their backs and fled, no longer able to care for the three children. The three children ran down into the cabin, with no way to escape. They only felt that the waves were turbulent and the boat was rising and falling, drifting with the water. They did not know how many miles they had traveled. They also hit the rocks several times, and both ends were broken. The three children suddenly found a plank in the crisis. Tian Zhao and Tian Pei each straddled one end, and Tian Bai, who was young, happened to be in the middle. Tian Zhao and Tian Pei held hands to prevent Tian Bai from falling. So they floated and sank, letting it go where it would. In one night, they drifted to the Wangjiang Tower in Hekou. Hekou is a riverside market. The upper reaches of the Han River were also flooded. Ordinary ruffians saw countless pieces of furniture and boxes drifting from the upper reaches. They were scrambling to take small boats to salvage them. From a distance, they saw a huge object drifting from the upper reaches. They couldn't tell what it was and were overjoyed. They thought they could make a big fortune. Who knew that when they got closer, it was a plank with three children attached to it. They were surprised. So they helped them up and sent them to Hongxing (the name of a shipping company) for temporary lodging. They changed their wet clothes and gave them food. The three children drifted all night and were not injured at all. A large number of people came to see them after hearing the news. Everyone praised their miraculous escape. The three children were all very clever and eloquent. They calmly told people their names, family history, and the circumstances of their misfortune. Only then did they know that they had drifted as far as three hundred miles.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Reading Paintings at Luoyun Tower <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>The sultry heat is annoying, and staying at home is boring. I visited Mr. Zhang Linqiu's Luoyun Tower with my friend, Mr. Zhou Rongshang. Half of it is a collection room for ancient people's calligraphy and paintings, and the other half is Linqiu's personal works. Ancient paintings such as Zhao Ziang's "Water Goddess" and "Smoke Village Waiting for Ferry" have a carefree and leisurely atmosphere. I thought the most are from Qiu Shizhou, Tang Liuru, Li Longmian, and Shen Nantian. Among them, there is a horizontal scroll of "Pear Garden Incense Burning Night Celebration Picture". The layout is layered and orderly, and the brushwork is delicate and not weak. The delicate girl's melancholic expression can be vividly conveyed between the eyebrows. It is signed by Ms. Xue'e. I don't know who Xue'e is, so I asked Zhang. He said, "This is the daughter of my Zhang family's great-grandfather, Guan Yi. She married Sun Xiaolian Ziyangyue from Qiantang. This picture was made before she left the cabinet. After marriage, because she was busy managing the family, she abandoned painting, which is a pity." I also took a look at the calligraphy of Prince Chengqin, Qian Songtao, He Shaoji, Zhang Chuanshan, Liang Shanzhou, and Feng Guifen. They all created their own styles. I think the Zhang Wujin couplet is the oldest. From the Tang Dynasty to the present, the paper has not been greatly damaged, which shows the hard work of the collection. Then I went to Linqiu's personal works. Linqiu does not paint, but he writes ancient plum blossoms, snow plum blossoms, Jiaomei plums, Yingxi plums, and more than ten kinds of horizontal scroll hall pictures. And the brushwork is strange and strong, with a wild and unrestrained interest. Re-visiting his calligraphy, it is like entering the market of the five capitals, which is dazzling. Mr. Zhang's calligraphy can convey a sense of leisure and ease in the midst of vigor, so he has recently formed a wide range of ink friendships in Shanghai. (Couplets, halls, and other pieces only collect ink money of two yuan. Ruidai Hongchu of Minghua Store on Nanjing Road, Shanghai, collects them on behalf of them.) His reputation is full of the art world. When the sun set, I said goodbye and slowly walked back in the evening sun in the sound of cicadas. (No reward accepted)</p>

<p>— Yin Shouman</p>
<p>The Rongzi map in Jintan's northern town has a very high terrain, and it is adjacent to Tianhuang Dyke in the west. The river is the boundary between them. The map is high and the dyke is low, with a difference of five or six feet. Whenever it rains for a long time, the water in the map overflows into the dyke, and the fields and houses are all submerged. The people in the dyke have suffered from it more than once. Until the beginning of Guangxu, there was a rich widow named Fan in the town. She was old and had no children. She happened to hear about it and felt compassion for it. She then poured out half of her field property for the cost of building a dyke. It was managed and managed, and it was completed in three months. It was about eight feet wide and thirteen miles long. From then on, the dyke was saved from flooding. The people in the dyke felt her virtue and named it Lady Fan's Dyke. I admire Fan's enthusiasm for public welfare, so I recorded its beginning and end, so that those who read the writing can know that there are such people among women.</p>
<p>Announcement To Mr. Lü Bing: Please indicate your communication address. Send to the United Federation of Associations, No. 27 Beile Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Brief Letter I am visiting Chaozhou and Meizhou, lingering at sea, and eating irregularly. So I was affected by the frost and dew, and I suffered from the symptoms of pain in the four limbs. I could not turn around. I especially rushed to Shanghai to seek treatment from Dr. Sun Weicai of Ningbo Road in the French Concession. After Dr. Sun's several acupuncture needles, I was cured immediately. It is said that the disease is called acute rheumatic fever. People who live in warm and humid places or engage in water activities are often affected by this. It is not easy to cure with acupuncture. (Sincerely)</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The number of Chinese students studying in France is increasing year by year. The most popular subjects are law, political science, and economics. Presumably, these courses are easier than other sciences. Everyone wants to spend a few years getting a title, and then return home to become a university professor or get promoted and become rich. Getting a degree in France is not unusual. If you are willing to spend a few thousand francs upon graduation from the graduate school, you can hire a specialist to write a thesis for you. Then, you can hope to receive the honors of a doctorate or master's degree. It is said that those who study fine arts, like Xu Beihong, who put in a lot of hard work, are rare. As far as I (Miss Dang herself) know, sixty or seventy percent of the students studying in France are wasting their time. A bustling market like Paris, with everything so tempting, easily leads weak-willed people astray. Except for a few dedicated scholars, most students do not even struggle to escape this bad environment. They spend their time in debauchery, indulging in the flesh market, patronizing foreign prostitutes, and marrying foreign women, and so on. They almost forget their mission and the nation's great plan to cultivate talents. Furthermore, many self-funded students try every means to obtain public funds from the Boxer Indemnity to subsidize their tuition. In reality, they are not striving for this unexpected allowance for the sake of studying. On the contrary, it is the hardworking students who are truly dedicated to their studies who cannot share any of the benefits because they have no connections. That is the real hardship. In my personal opinion, students studying in France are indeed more romantic than those studying in other countries. I am not intentionally saying this out of prejudice. The situation of Japanese students in France, for example, is very different. Of course, Japan does not send as many students abroad as China does. Japanese students are diligent and hardworking. Unless it is to study a difficult subject and they specifically hire an expert to teach them, they will not hesitate to spend money, but otherwise, they never waste money. Therefore, Japanese students often make inventions and contributions in science after returning home, which is definitely not accidental success.</p>
<p>Whenever we go to any country in Europe, we always feel "ashamed of our inferiority" because our national power is weak and our international status is so pitifully low. I often wonder why Westerners are so arrogant when they come to China, while Chinese people become so dejected when they go to Europe. I cannot explain this feeling of "self-esteem" and "inferiority" myself. Not to mention ordinary people like us, even our diplomats are not as respected as foreign diplomats. This is really not surprising for diplomats, but the government does not care enough about the dignity of the country and does not understand the difficulties of diplomats. To say nothing else, just the funding for embassies and consulates abroad has been in arrears for months, leading to utter destitution. If an accident occurs and they need to report it to the central government, even the cost of a telegram can cause panic. Ordinary people think that diplomats are very rich, but those who have experienced it or know the details have long regarded diplomats as disaster officials and embassies and consulates as the poorest institutions.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Random Notes on a Northeast China Inspection Trip (6) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Suijiu</p>
<p>(X) The Fall of the Manchu Qing Dynasty Due to the "Ten Nos"</p>
<p>When we study the various undertakings operated by the Japanese in Northeast China, we must pay attention to the ideology, planning, and scientific methods of each undertaking. All undertakings must have ideological planning as a framework and scientific methods to promote their implementation in order to be effective. Some say that the Manchus were able to gain control of China because of Hong Chengchou's strategies, and that the fall of the Manchu Qing Dynasty was also due to the strategies planned by Hong. The great power of ideology is indeed profound, and cannot be understood by superficial materialists. After Hong Chengchou surrendered to the Qing, he greatly regretted his rash surrender at the time. In addition, Ming dynasty remnants set up altars to worship Hong Chengchou for sacrificing himself for the country, in order to provoke him. Hong then devised the "Ten Nos" strategy. The Qing court did not realize this and adhered to it generation after generation as ancestral family law. The ten nos are: (1) Men surrender, women do not. Men wear Manchu clothing, while women retain Han attire. (2) Officials surrender, servants do not. Officials use plumes and mandarin gowns, while servants still wear red and black hats and round-collared clothes, preserving the Han system. Officials are inferior to servants. (3) Civil officials surrender, military officials do not. Civil officials all wear Manchu attire, while military generals have a pavilion for armor, where armor is stored and paraded through the city when welcoming frost, greeting the god of joy, and displaying military might, to show that they do not forget the ancient system. (4) The old surrender, the young do not. People wear Qing clothes and hats when they reach adulthood, but at the beginning of life, the clothes in their swaddling clothes are all cut in the style of Taoist robes, and the hats are purple-gold crowns and crane scarves, all remnants of the Han ethnicity. (5) The living surrender, the dead do not. While alive, clothing and everything else勉强勉强 conform to Qing regulations, but after death, coffins, pillows, quilts, and other ornaments all follow the ancient Han customs. Moreover, filial sons wear mourning hats, carry mourning sticks, and wear hemp clothes and straw shoes, which are like a poem of the Ming dynasty, particularly striking and reminding people of the lost country. (6) Gentry, merchants, scholars surrender, beggars do not. In the past, during the Dragon Boat Festival and the New Year's Eve, some beggars would make paper gauze hats and dress up as Zhong Jinshi or the God of Wealth to beg for money from shops, allowing people to see the Han official ceremonies and stir up ethnic consciousness. (7) Secular families surrender, monks and nuns do not. Throughout the Qing dynasty, monks, Taoists, and nuns did not change their monastic robes. (8) Scholars of imperial examinations surrender, scholars who passed the county level exam do not. The "sparrow hats" and blue shirts are clearly of the Han system. (9) Officials of the living surrender, officials of the dead do not. Throughout the Qing dynasty, the city gods and land gods of each county and county all still wore gauze hats and red robes. (10) Heads surrender, feet do not. When officials paid tribute, they wore red-tasselled hats, though they were Qing officials, but they wore square-toed ancient boots. Hong Chengchou personally established the ten regulations, embedding the idea of ethnic revolution within them, while gradually weakening the Manchus. People are diligent in pursuing material things, but they have not considered the great power of ideology, which is enough to predetermine the fate of an entire nation. Genghis Khan's military advisor and Yuan dynasty Zhongshu Ling, Yelu Chucai, once met a Western Xia man named Chang Bajin who was good at making bows. Chang said to Chucai, "The country values military force, but you want to advance through literature. Isn't that the wrong way?" Chucai replied, "Bow makers still need craftsmen, so why shouldn't governing the world use the world's craftsmen?" In my study of the Northeast China problem, I deeply feel that the determination of ideological planning is more urgent than material construction.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Further Progress Seen in Finance and Gold Market <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>

Later, with the implementation of the factory law, some bulls took the opportunity to purchase, and the market sentiment was driven strong. Before long, the US government published its estimate, with an unexpected bumper harvest, and the world was greatly shocked. The price fell by 320 pounds, and the standard yarn suddenly revealed flaws, the market plummeted, the situation was extremely terrifying, and it fell by 5.6 taels in one day. Later, the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs actively purchased a large number of 10-count coarse yarns. The standard yarn price was 3.4 taels lower than the spot price. Some bulls absorbed a large amount of goods this month in preparation for receiving them, and the market rebounded, reaching 58 taels and 9 mace. However, a manufacturer sold out 1,000 bales of 10-count Fugui yarn, and the market price suddenly loosened. At the end of the month, it was 54 taels and 5 mace. The last transaction was a high of one tael for 1,400 bales purchased by some shorts, totaling 57 taels. The result was a delivery price of 156 taels. The goods included about 4,000 bales of 10-count Fugui, Sanyang, Honghefeng, and Hongkuixing yarns, totaling 8,050 bales. The rest were self-delivered, with Rongxing Company receiving 3,600 bales and Tongxing Company receiving 800 bales being the most. Tianlong delivered 1,000 bales, Xincheng delivered 1,450 bales, and Heshen delivered 650 bales, which were the most. The brokerage firms and bale amounts on both sides of the delivery and receipt are recorded below.</p>

<p>The price of Han Standard at the beginning of August was 6 taels and 4.5 mace, and the market was very stable. Due to the lack of underlying goods, Japanese merchants were also long. Later, due to bad news about US cotton, the rumors became increasingly tight, causing people to be weak. On August 8, the government estimate was published, with an unexpected bumper harvest, and the market price plummeted by more than 100 pounds. The world's cotton industry was in a panic. The standard cotton opened and suddenly fell by 1.56 taels. At that time, the situation in the business world was very chaotic, selling sentiment was rampant, and for a time it seemed out of control. Japanese merchants and manufacturers all said they would deliver goods. The lowest point was 32 taels and 5 mace. Then, US cotton had maintenance news, and the market price rebounded by 560 pounds. The market situation was slightly stable, and the gold price also increased. Japanese merchants also bought. On the last day of delivery, there was a turnover. The last transaction was 33 taels and 5 mace. The result was a delivery of 11,100 dan. Maoji received 2,100 dan, and Guangfeng received 1,400 dan. Guangfeng sold the most at 3,700 dan, and Shenji sold 1,500 dan. The brokerage fees and dan amounts on both sides of the receipt and delivery are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Chinese Yarn Mills Buy Large Quantities of US Cotton <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Imports of Indian Cotton Will Also Not Decrease Significantly</p>
<p>Since the sharp fall in US cotton prices, yarn mills have purchased more than 150,000 bales of US cotton in the last ten days. There have been fewer transactions in Indian cotton. Although this is due to the estimated increase in US cotton production, the price difference between US and Indian cotton has gradually become closer. Strictly speaking, the difference between the meter rate and the white cloth has been reduced to about 1 yuan 5 jiao in Japanese gold. Therefore, the low price of US cotton and the high price of Indian cotton have prompted Japanese factories to shift their strategy in spinning medium-count yarns. In the past, when spinning 20-count coarse yarn, the cotton mixing ratio was 80% Indian cotton and 20% US cotton. Now that the price difference has narrowed, the cotton mixing is bound to change. However, this will not affect the import of Indian cotton. Because of the reduced production of Hankou cotton due to disasters, in addition to being supplemented by Shandong and Tianjin cotton, which have better cotton production, it is still insufficient. Yarn mills use Chinese cotton and Indian cotton interchangeably. Now that Indian cotton is more expensive, inferior US cotton can be used as a substitute. Moreover, the trend in spinning is shifting to medium counts, so the import volume of US cotton is bound to increase.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Spot Yarn Shows a Clear Firming Trend <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market shows a firming trend. The overseas flower yarn situation has turned upwards, and the rise and fall have also shrunk, resulting in slightly better sentiment. However, the major sellers are calmly reluctant to replenish their positions, and there are many who are short due to the severe floods in various places, so the pressure is still heavy. Standard yarn was suspended for one day this month to handle deliveries, so there was less spot yarn business. There were fewer people gathering in the business premises in the afternoon, and there were very few open-market transactions. According to statistics, the various gangs only bought 300 bales throughout the day. The market was slightly firmer. Among the visiting gangs, Changsha entered 60 bales, Tianjin entered 60 bales, Guangdong entered 10 bales, the inland entered 45 bales, Sichuan entered 10 bales, the Northern gang entered 5 bales, and peers entered 100 bales. Standard cotton was suspended due to delivery, so there was no spot cotton business. However, the sentiment was firmer, because the US cotton was calm and the gold price was rising.</p>

<p>American Cotton Weak Then Strong: Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but later strengthened due to purchases by Japanese merchants and short covering. Futures rose 8 to 12 points, and spot prices rose 10 points. British cotton futures were unchanged, while spot prices fell 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 10 points. The Indian cotton market was calm and firm, with Pingor rising 0.5 rupees, Aumra rising 0.25 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rising 0.125 rupees. (Original telegram dated 28th)</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on the 28th stated that the Clement Company estimates the production percentage at 67.1%, with a harvest of 15,512,000 bales. Their previous estimate was a production percentage of 70.6%, with a harvest of 13,981,000 bales.</p>

<p>Suggestions for Cotton Field Management Likely to Fail</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 28th reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that at the beginning of the week, short covering was quite active due to increasing news of poor new cotton in the South. The result of maintaining market prices was uncertain, and hedging sales in the South were stagnant. The reason for the stagnation of hedging sales in the South is the delay in the arrival of new cotton. By the weekend, demand had turned sluggish, and market sentiment was awaiting developments. Although the legislative proposals for managing cotton fields have gained support from a state or two, it is generally expected that they will fail due to insufficient support. Currently, there are increasing complaints about the new cotton, making it difficult to predict the next government's estimate report. At the same time, short sellers hope that when new cotton arrives, hedging sales will increase, purchases will be limited, and low prices will make buyers cautious.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Grain: River-Bottom Rice Sales Slightly More Active <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the South Market, sources from various groups were seen, about twenty-odd firms. Stocks in the Puxi area are also plentiful. Market sales were more active than the previous market. High-quality Changshu and Wuxi early indica rice was particularly stable; secondary quality moved as store sales gradually picked up. Sellers disposed of their goods with the market, and handling fees increased. Nearly a thousand dan from the same group was placed on the docks, and the situation looked promising with an increase of three chi. Sales of early and late rice were extremely brisk, and the situation stabilized. Sales of imported Luzhou long-grain rice were steady, and prices did not rise or fall. Discolored rice was sluggish at two yuan, with the price decreasing by ten cents.</p>
<p>Few sources on the Suzhou River bank in Xinzha, and buying interest from various suppliers was moderate. Sales of regular and Changzhou machine-processed rice were steady. Appetite for rice from Jiangyin and Kunshan was slight, with an increase of fifty cents. Incoming shipments of early and late rice were changing hands. Zou Zhuang's group handled three thousand shi, and the situation jumped sharply by seventy or eighty cents. Some imported pointed grain, pier grain, and Luzhou long-grain rice arrived, and buyer interest was very good. Prices were stable. The glutinous rice market lacked interest, discolored rice was very stagnant, and the price was short by half a chi. Purchases of imported rice by rice merchants tightened the situation. Cargo from river factories opened with about four thousand dan.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Starch Market Fluctuates Towards Stability <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the starch market yesterday morning and afternoon, the market for each month generally showed an image of initial fluctuation followed by stability. Because August is the last day of trading, it initially traded around one qian, and then fell to two liang and nine and a half fen. However, due to the low market price, distributors from the North and South roads found it profitable to package and sell, so they were gradually buying in. The quantity was estimated to be between seven and eight hundred thousand bags. Factories also automatically repurchased and hedged into subsequent months. Therefore, sentiment improved, and asking prices gradually increased, as the fact that this month could pass seemed to give a sense of security to those who went long. As a result, this month was up seven and a half li compared to the previous day, September was up five li, October was up one fen and two and a half li, November and December were up one fen, and January was up seven and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Wheat Market: Near and Far-Term Trends Differ <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed an image of near-term weakness and long-term stability. Since August has already passed, market sentiment for September was generally weak because most factories have abundant imported wheat in stock, and production is more than sufficient. If the quality is not cheap, they will mostly wait and see, and this is one reason for the recent weakness. The far-term market was slightly up because outsiders were slightly more optimistic, and sellers were less active. However, imported wheat prices remained poor, and the overseas situation had not yet escaped the state of oversupply. It is difficult to be overly optimistic about the future. As a result, September was down two fen compared to the previous day, October was down one fen, November was unchanged, December was up one fen, and January was up two fen. The current wheat market situation remains weak and sluggish. Yizheng wheat opened at three liang and six qian and two fen, Penglai wheat at three liang and seven qian, and Shahe wheat at three liang and six qian and a half, totaling over eight hundred bags, which was handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>[P Foreign company customers are very sluggish, origin prices are high, telegrams not transferred]</p>
<p>Yesterday the imported rice market was flat, and telegrams were sent out by foreign firms, but because prices in the production areas were high, there was no response. The market was in a sluggish state, because importer appetites were very weak, and rice merchants had no interest. Local firms had goods arriving from the river bottom area, and only local firms were handling the transactions. Two firms sold 300 bags of Saigon rice at 13 yuan 8 jiao. There were no other transactions. Roll-over futures saw a small transaction of 300 tons in September at 6 liang and a half to 6 liang 5 qian 2 fen, similar to the previous market. As for the rumor that Bingchang Firm had newly purchased 200,000 "shun" in the production area, according to a letter from the firm, they stated that they did not purchase such a large amount, only a few thousand tons on behalf of customers.</p>
<p>Northern merchants have no interest in imported or locally produced goods, but are very welcome to local currency. They only dislike the lack of goods on the market, making it difficult to choose. Yesterday, only over one hundred bags of Zhongguan yuan were handled, priced at 14 yuan 2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Trends Firmer <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Taikoo Sugar Transactions Become More Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams: Cuban raw sugar price remains at 1.40625. New York futures: September 1.35, December 1.34, next year March 1.37, May 1.42. Compared to the previous telegram, near-term rebounded by four points, while the distant-term increased by one to two points. Java raw sugar price is 7.75, futures for all months are 7.625, unchanged from before. The Public Association market set prices. Although transactions of Dutch sugar No. 24 raw and white sugar are quiet, the market sentiment is quite strong. New goods are 11 liang 7 qian and a half, old goods are 11 liang 5 qian and a half. No. 20 high and medium raw and white sugar is 11 liang 2 qian, and No. 8 Dutch red sugar is 9 liang 5 qian, and No. 10 goods are 9 liang 7 qian. Market conditions are generally stable. Taikoo granulated sugar price settings have gradually become smoother, probably because demand from the North and inland Zhejiang province has slightly increased. B Mark's transaction price was 11 liang 9 qian 7 fen and a half, CW Mark 10 liang 9 qian, DY Mark 11 liang 8 qian, HM Mark 11 liang 4 qian, HX Mark 11 liang 7 qian, ○ Mark 9 liang 4 qian 2 fen and a half. The total transaction amount is estimated to be several thousand bags. There was a slight shortage of sellers, so the market outlook also showed some strength. Although inquiries for Ye Xin's No. 8 Dutch red sugar priced at 9 liang 5 qian were temporarily scarce, the market conditions were particularly firm.</p>
<h3 id="e207">North-South Goods: Orchid Seeds Open Down Four Liang <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Recently, with genuine "water goods" of orchid seeds entering the market, prices have turned weak. It is heard that local conditions have suddenly caused wind and rain, resulting in four-tenths of the crop being blown down, and the arrival date has also been delayed. Yesterday's arrivals opened down about four liang. Because a large batch of goods will arrive in Shanghai in the later period, the trend is still turning soft. The future market will shift with the quantity of goods.</p>
