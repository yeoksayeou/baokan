<h3 id="c22">萬寳山案已釀重大形勢 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>長春萬寳山韓民聚衆强闢水田一案。我方據農民籲請。迭次交涉。日方非但不理。且派武裝巡警到塲。名爲保護。實則帮助韓民挖掘。記者早料其必釀巨禍。曾略有所警告。今據日方電訊。華農與韓民已因此大起衝突。中日武警。携械馳往加入戰鬭。日方且將添派步兵聯隊援助。其形勢嚴重。已可槪見。此事本館尙未得到訪員報告。最近因何啓釁。眞相未明。惟據日方電告。謂華農五百擁到韓民部落。破壞伊通河韓民水田。乃與韓民衝突。竊謂華人性懦。未必遽以此强硬手段。對付韓民。即使如日電所傳。由華農破壞伊通河水田啓釁。其責任亦仍由韓民負担。何以故。以韓民所强挖者。爲未經批准備案未經地主同意之水田。且被日人佔用後。第一華民各農田。因水道截成兩段。農作有重大妨害。第二伊通河中流築堰堵水。使上下游民田數千晌。悉受水害。第三伊通河爲長農兩縣航運之河流。若中流築堰。將妨礎交通甚大。此種情形。已由中日兩方官廳。派員查明實在。是非眞相大白。報告文亦已披露報紙。彰彰在人耳目。華農爲自衛身家性命。並保護合法權利與航運交通計。無論如何。絶對無容許之理。自雙方會查之後。我人方冀日當局秉公處理。有以抑止韓民之行動。乃不謂仍置之不理。一任韓民之橫行。我華農至是又安能忍之再忍以坐待宰割乎。故此次之衝突。無論如何。韓民固不能辭咎。日當局亦不能却其責任。倘於此時。日方再不幡然覺悟。急速制止。而復故意張皇。派兵助戰。則是眞欲釀成巨禍。以犯世界不韙。我料日當局之用心。當不若是也。</p>

<p>路透社一日華盛頓電　美代理國務卿凱塞爾指法美間關於停付戰債之談判前胡佛總統略商之後、故其言愈屬可信、美國已由其駐法大使警告法國、如胡佛總統計畫不成、德國勢必宣佈停付戰債、果爾、則法國在今後一年中將喪失不止一○○·○○○·○○○元、法政府所建議付入國際淸理銀行之欵、應還借與德國實業而非德政府、並應可借與其他中歐諸國一節、美國指爲與胡佛總統提議相牴觸、</p>
<p>路透社一日巴黎電　胡佛總統提議中重要部份、今日午後復由法美雙方代表詳細討論、迨散會時、談判猶未完畢、明日夜間將再集議、法總理賴伐爾散會後發表文告、謂美國仍願繼續談判、而法美雙方見解仍有不同之點云、財政部長梅隆亦發出文告、說明美國之地位、其大旨與上述者相同、法内閣會議將於明晨研究梅隆來文、</p>
<p>國民一日巴黎電　美法談判竟出一般人意料之外者、即今日美國間之會議、對於胡佛計劃法國合作問題、至今尙無一定解决之方案是也、今日美國財長梅隆·大使愛治·及法國總理賴伐爾·外長白里安·財長佛蘭亭等集議二小時之久、終至未有結果而散、其原因係梅隆有一覺書送致賴伐爾、將胡佛原有計劃之宗旨動因等、一再叙述、該項覺書在法國方面認爲必須重加考瓐也、至今日會議散會時、、於明晚九時半再續議云、故現在雙方猶在猶豫之中、一切眞相自難加以預測、說者謂賴伐爾憑藉國會之後盾、與美代表處於對等相反之地位、此時萬難打銷其德國必須繼續解付無條件賠欵之主張而作讓步、然他一方面則謂法國之地位、亦絶非堅不可搖、將來如果胡佛總統堅持其計劃、即不得法國之合作、亦必實行者、則法國勢成騎虎、祇得勉强就範、後之一說、已由華盛頓方面加以否認、然終不能祛除普通人士之猜測、因華盛頓方面後有表示、謂美德等之三要點中、有二要點實爲華盛頓方面萬難讓步者云、至於法國各報現頗極呈不安之象、對於意美德三國冷嘲熱駡、不加軒輊、蓋意國日前通知德奥保加利亞三國聲明暫時放棄賠欵、以待胡佛計劃解决、法國報紙認此舉爲賣弄風情、而致損及法國之地位也、</p>

<p>日人一般之主張旣强橫如此。則在此次協商中。日方代表提案之態度。吾人已不難想見。不過目前兩方代表尙未正式集議。日方提案究若何。無法探悉。惟根據六月六日南滿代表木村理事與我方代表高紀毅氏之談話。則日方準備提出之問題。似爲（一）與日本有條約協定各路興築問題。（二）南滿路平行線問題。（三）在一區域内各路改訂運價及將來不作運價競爭問題。（四）由日本包工各路所欠日方之工程費改爲借欵問題。將來日方提案。或不止此四項。茲且僅就此四項略加預測。并加批評。</p>
<p>獨立國家。主權神聖。日人過去憑藉不平等條約。在我國内興築鐵路。侵犯我主權。吾人每一聽南滿路上嗚嗚之汽笛聲時。即已深痛主權旁落。大好山河。被人鐵蹄踏破。方亟謀廢除一切不平等條約。收回一切外國鐵路。復我主權。茲日人乃又欲以前次之眼光。視我新興之民族。時代不同環境亦殊。日人舊事重提。徒增我國惡感。可謂不智。試問日本國内。能容許他國建築鐵路否。而且日人所憑藉之不平等條約之訂立。究爲我國自願。抑出自日人之壓迫。一之爲甚。詎豈容再。第二項所謂平行綫問題。亦同爲無理要求。我方萬難接受。夫我國爲開發富源。在本國境内自修鐵道。爲橫爲縱。主權所在。任何國家。决不能干涉。何况日人反對我國建築與南滿路平行綫之唯一理由即根據淸光緒三十一年中日交涉中之會議記錄。（日人謂另有草約。實爲僞造。）記錄非正式决議、尤非正式條約。盡人皆知。何能持爲侵犯我神聖主權之理由。退一步言之。就令日人所提爲合理之要求。但所謂平行。應亦有限制。依照歐美通例。大都以路軌左右各六十哩爲限。日人</p>
<p>以漫無限制之條文。肆無理之干涉。則結果所至。除我國俯手貼耳坐看南滿鐵道網系之縱橫與我境内外。凡有興建。殆無不可以與滿鐵平行或其他橫蠻理由起而干涉。我國有鐵路。詎尙有建築之日。日人固時時以共存共榮爲口頭禪者、如茲所提。則是亟亟求滿鐵繁榮。我國鐵道衰萎矣。故所謂平行線問題。我國更絶對不能承認。上述兩項問題。就性質言。已溢出此次協商事項範圍之外。木村提出。我方代表高紀毅氏已表示拒絶接受。高氏之精明强幹。吾人實深欣慰。至於其他改訂運價與借欵兩問題。爲此次協商範圍以内之問題。我方代表自可以根據事實。鄭重協商。固無須吾人嘵嘵論列。茲爲使國人瞭然於日方提案之陰謀起見。特將木村所提四案之内容要點及其自的。表示如左。（未完）</p>

<p>麥克薛墨林之得標以及傑克夏蓋之破壞規則、根據於紐約運動會委員之主見、厥後薛墨林拒絶夏蓋第二次比賽之要求、因此紐約委員認爲不滿、改變態度毅然撤回薛墨林錦標、紐約遂無此項正式之錦標、惟公衆主張、以及世界運動界曁美國全國擊球會、均依然一致認可、</p>

<p>— 田隅老農</p>
<p>舊雨胡鶴章君。余舊交也。客歲經商鄂西。倐已一載。日昨來滬來。寓中央旅社。余聞信後。即驅車往訪。詢以宜地狀。胡君謂自赤匪竄入興山。詎宜稍遠。故市面尙稱安謐。惟赤匪中有女飛衛者。凶悍慘毒。可得而述之。</p>
<p>女飛衛之來歷　女飛衛者。即赤匪首領賀龍之妹賀英也。年祇二十餘歲。體態苗條。面目嬌好。兼之力大無窮。精射繫。擎槍突陣。彈無虚發。匪衆驚爲神技。皆懾伏。以其美而善射也。匪中僉稱之曰女飛衛。飛衛禀性陰狠凶悍殘酷。甚於賀龍。復自練女軍千人。備齋槍械。輔助其兄。蹂躪各處。被害者。不可勝數。</p>
<p>女軍服裝之怪異　飛衛所練之女軍。均係鄂湘各地煽脅相從之鄕婦。年都不滿三十歲。體格强健。臨陣致死。不亞男子。而其服裝最爲怪異。衣衫緊窄。短褲及膝。赤足草鞋。小腿上纏紅布。便行走。衣袴用黑色。便藏匿。短袴中間。裂一縫。便小遺。髮髻梳在頭頂。如茅山之遊方道人然。奇形怪狀。筆難盡述。</p>
<p>放天燈剖腹刳腸　赤匪擄得鄕人之富有者。必多方拷打。逼出藏金後。復褫其衣袴。赤身縛於樹上。用洋油浸透之棉絮。散紥全身。然後引火焚燒。謂之放天燈。或用利刃剖腹刳腸。慘無人道。</p>
<p>國軍進剿竄興山　赤匪本以鄂之施鶴。湘之慈灃等縣爲根據地。實力雄厚。自徐源泉氏任川鄂湘三省淸鄕督辦以來。疊次進攻。賀龍連戰失利。實力損失不貲。官軍銳氣正盛。女飛衛乃商諸其兄。爲保全實力計。祗得放棄該地。連夜率殘匪七八千人。越巴東秭歸。竄入興山。緣該處山嶺險峻。可以拒守。現聞徐氏爲徹底肅淸計。日内將下令進攻云。</p>
<h3 id="c100">匡廬導游 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 沈廷凱</p>
<p>橫看成嶺側成峯。遠近高低各不同。。不識廬山眞面目。只緣身在此山中。我讀了這一首宋代詩宗蘇東坡的詩。追想起十八年夏的一次匡廬淸游。細細辨着味兒。不覺得又神往了兩年間的光陰。像長江中逝水一般。宛宛流去。别的事情的回憶。又不知漂流去了多少。但是那匡廬的千巖萬壑。到處泉聲。再也漂流不去且把我的一次淸游記出來。作雪泥鴻爪可。作士女們的游程嚮導亦無不可。</p>
<p>從上海到匡廬去。可乘飛機或輪船。由滬先到了九江。再轉往目的地。但飛機雖快。多數人却不敢嘗試。輪行更要三整天可達。於是老於行旅者。就想出一條權變的行程。就是乘京滬夜快車赴京。翌晨在下關趁輪前往。則在四十小時左右中。可達九江了。</p>
<p>匡廬的中心地。當然是牯嶺。到了九江。越宿換乘汽車。（每客約一元七八角）從淸泉不斷聲中。到了半山蓮花洞。下了車。步行或肩輿上去我是乘肩輿的。一步高一步的上山。初時炎熱甚熾。後來上愈高。氣愈爽。漸漸兒不覺得熱了。望着牯嶺的洋房從綠蔭深處。顯出一角角的紅樓。再俯瞰着長江風景。眞是雄麗天成。</p>
<p>牯嶺高出海長江風景。眞是雄麗天成。帶。本爲英敎士利脫爾所經營的租借地。故設備極週。緣學校旅館病院俱樂部運動塲游泳池等。什麽都有。自我國把租借地收回了。依舊沒有减色啊。</p>
<p>若把匡廬全境的勝地。遍尋起來。眞是尋不勝尋。所以只好以牯嶺爲根據。作附近之探勝。但是我雖暢游了十餘日。而遺落的地方。更是計不勝計哩。</p>
<p>使我永遠不會忘記的印像。要算月夜游白鹿洞了。那天先到含鄱口去看雲。忽然把高峯掩着不見了。忽然又開朗起來。氣象萬千。莫可名狀。觀雲後。隨即下山。到了山脚。跟着巨大的泉流。經棲賢寺（慈航寺）到白鹿洞。觸於眼簾者。爲「名敎樂地」的一塊木牌坊。過流芳橋。進白鹿書院的大門。突聞書聲朗郎。我便感覺着昔日晦翁遺風。而今宛在呢。院旁有聯云「鹿豕與遊。物我相忘之地。泉峯交映。智仁獨得之天。」白鹿洞回來。我回到慈航寺過宿。這夜的感覺。假使比新婚燕爾。眞要快活得多。夜深了。淸風一陣陣作聲。寺鐘不斷的撞着。我轉想到浮雲人事。恨不得與古佛靑燈作長伴哩。</p>
<p>匡廬的寺觀有天池寺·東林寺·西林寺·瞻雲寺·棲賢寺·秀峯寺·慈航寺等。山峯的著名者有五老峯·香爐峯·雙劍峯·蓮花峯。犁頭峯·漢陽峯等。名勝有佛手巖·御碑亭·白鹿洞·黃龍潭·三峽澗等。</p>
<p>松樹林。爲牯嶺勝地。綿亘極長。幽靜特甚。我們散步其間。覺得山綠了。松也綠了人在叢林。似乎襯映得衣袂俱綠。面目也俱綠了尤其是對對的情侶。雙雙在林下散步。令人有只羨鴛鴦不羨仙之思。</p>
<p>末了。我希望游匡廬的士女們。於道出潯陽之際。到也有暫駐一游的價値。從潯陽的甘棠湖畔。遙對着匡廬在望。眞面目却辨不出來。此景此情。倒也耐人尋味哩</p>

<p>現在此種運動。均出發於印人。若中人能與并進。則亞洲聯絡之事甚易。即日本並無難促其覺悟。稍緩其器小易盈之野心。而共圖亞洲文明之進步。三島人民。不患無飯吃。此點殊可注意。若華人能與印人合力東聯日本。西聯回部。以恢復亞洲之眞文明。放棄狹隘之國家主義。實現中山之大同主義。未始不可先行之於亞洲。雖日本並未見得爲大礙。亦在運動耳。若夫英儒偉爾斯曾主張中美先聯邦。然後與歐洲合并。因歐洲好紛亂。太平無望。故希望太平洋上中美兩邦。爲世界大同之先導。亦可見東方文化有爲二十世紀中心之勢。眞理得最後之戰勝也。吾華應善自勉矣。</p>
<p>有二小童年才十三四歲。英語未甚懂。來余室。渴問其意。願隨余至中國。余問其父母兄弟均在印度。何以願到中國。答我甚願遊中國。我愛中國也。余出觀音像示之曰。此中國日本之女神也。家家供奉。汝應知此菩薩神通廣大矣。彼不甚懂。余曰。汝細視之。知此女神狀貌。無異汝家母親姊妹之裝飾也。彼然之。余曰。此可知印度與東亞文化之關係。在千餘前翻譯汝之經典。模仿汝之女神。占全勢力於東亞。至今盛行。汝印度如一大樹。而開花遍於亞洲也。將來汝到東方。自然歡迎。惟汝今尙年少。並英語尙未能講。俟汝長大可也。彼等悲喜交集而退。此小事勿輕忽之。可證明幼童對中國有如此愛慕。乃最好之現象也。此其哲人聞中國聞人至。相對欲泣。幼兒聞中國神遊若此。可以卜將來之關係矣。</p>
<p>一學生名沙米難打。家住戈乃克縣。甚近拘絺那。拘絺那乃佛入滅處。即說湼槃經地也。彼願導余遊其家。以觀佛湼槃處。離波羅奈並不遠。且云在彼處甚希望中國辦佛敎學校。若能辦成。印人有許多小王。亦樂於捐欵。因西人辦耶穌敎者。彼尙捐欵也。佛本印度之佛。印人當然樂於贊助佛敎。不過印人自己尙未能提倡之。望華人倡之。印人助之也。余按歐洲瑞典小邦。尙專派人至中國北方山西調取蛇種。余曾與同住。彼采各種蛇。歸瑞典丹麥小邦。而傳敎者遍地球。蓋發揚其文明爲冠冕也。今中華之大。不知萬萬佛徒作何工作。並印度佛土之恩亦不報。不亦可憐哉。願佛徒其勉旃。</p>

<p>「不要你的金，不要你的銀，奴奴只要你的心，阿呀呀！你的心……」</p>
<p>子良的心，當眞被伊要了去了，實在忍不住，便走到樓梯頭：</p>
<p>「鬧什麽？唱這種歌，你今年多大年紀了？」</p>
<p>「老身七十二歲，哈哈！」</p>
<p>「竟像一個小孩子，還不下去！」</p>
<p>說罷，回到亭子間中，夫人當眞走了，伊臨下樓的時節，把頭對亭子間裹一探：</p>
<p>「敎書匠不配欣賞藝術，」</p>
<p>一陣狂笑聲，足步聲，一齊由樓梯上下去了，聽伊往竈間裹去，大約去弄菜了，子良重整旗鼓，再動筆修改學生的作文。</p>
<p>約莫看到半篇，樓梯上就有夫人自言自語的聲音：</p>
<p>「女人是靠男人生活的，所以我月如，一刻也少不得丈夫潘子良！」</p>
<p>說話剛完，伊已踏到亭子間中，子良只見伊右手拿了戥子，戥子之中，一隻酒杯，伊面孔上，現出一種尴尬的表情來：</p>
<p>「你替我算算！照我的講義上，應當用醬油二兩；但是這是新制的戥子，和從前分量不同，怕太多罷！」</p>
<p>「嚕囌！」</p>
<p>「醬油的分量，不照講義上算好，菜弄得不好吃，我可不負責任的。」</p>
<p>子良曉得若不替伊算一算，一來，伊更不肯下去，二來，今天的菜味，又要糟了，所以用筆在紙上，算了一下：</p>
<p>「用醬油一兩六錢八分七厘半！」</p>
<p>子良故意的連小數也不略去否則說不定還要問三問四。此刻伊一聽得一兩六錢八分七厘半，也不問怎樣稱法、皺着眉頭，右手拏着戥子，左手拏着一杯醬油，下樓去了。</p>

<p>新閘　昨日西路各帮到埠約二三十號　走銷初滯後爽、蘇常厚粳在早晨極呆　價續軟化、店方進意轉淡、頂貨續疲二角、中關則反覺微挺、然非正式市面、薄稻到湧銷淡、行情又軟二三尺、杜洋尖本街問訊尙殷、來源不甚湧旺、價降近尺、壩埠尖銷化欠佳貨色有限、人心不振、故趨勢跌一角左右、客尖裝來不多、去路寥寥、價回一二角不等、糯米大盤亦告下游、全市各米一致平疲、河貨斛開不滿二千石</p>
<p>滬南　昨日米情天氣放晴、到貨三十二三艘、城鄕銷塲不振　、早稻尙有零星見抵、宿此早稻與常錫蘇同等貨到　頗聯、買氣沉寂、行情因之萎疲、大盤見短三四角、南港各薄稻本街及鄕莊帮交易極呆、故趨短二三角、杜洋尖鮮頂尙稱還可、宿次呆滯、價短近尺、陰化高缺居定、中檔賤而角化、洋米零銷不暢、鄕胃亦觀望、是以價格續小角許、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初疲繼堅之象、以芝加哥洋報價、又小五七角左右、故市氣曾一度虚疲、惟以廠抛甚寂、又以美法間之談判、尙未臻妥善、深恐金市開價、至少有一度之影響、因之人心老住、抛戶頓懈、迨至下午開盤、以廠家仍趨擯局、外行人心、益爲帶勁、兼之天津雖現銷不暢、做期貨心思者、則頗湧旺、所以市面又步呈堅挺、惟國外仍在過剩之際、如果外行硬抬過甚、又難免洋麥之抛壓也結果本月份好五厘、八月份好一分、九·十份好七厘半、十一·十二月份好一分云、</p>

<p>General Suppression Order Issued</p>
<p>Red Bandits Hoping to Defend Strongly</p>
<p>(Nanchang) On the 2nd, General Commander Chiang, accompanied by Gao Lingbai, Wang Shihe, Lin Weiwen, and others, departed from the province for Fuzhou aboard the Xin'an shallow-draft vessel. A large company of bodyguards went along. Those seeing him off at the time included high-ranking officials Lu Dipin, Xiong Shihui, Zhou Fo-hai, and others. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) He Jingwu and others, along with a large group of personnel from various places, are scheduled to depart for Fuzhou on the 2nd. Xiong Shihui and Zhou Fo-hai will remain behind. Zhou Fo-hai this afternoon represented General Commander Chiang at a welcome meeting of city merchant associations and other groups. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Nanchang dispatch: (1) The General Suppression Order has been issued. Starting on the 1st, troops from all routes suppressing bandits will simultaneously converge and advance to suppress them. Each unit must reach the location designated in the original plan each day, and the main force of the designated bandit areas must be eliminated within the specified time limit. (2) Mao Bangchu, at dawn on the 1st, led two aircraft to scout the Red areas, and saw that in Donggu, Longgang, Xingguo, Ningdu, Guangchang, Nanfeng, and Le'an, the Red bandits were hastily building fortifications, hoping to defend them strongly, and the situation was extremely tense. (3) The bandit side is still using the old method of dividing the whole into parts to avoid strength and seek weakness. (4) Seven aircraft fly to the front every morning to scout the enemy situation, and it is clear that the bandits are using a dispersed line method, with two or three hundred people acting together to create a false impression. (5) Chiang issued a proclamation to the generals and soldiers suppressing the Red bandits on the 1st, stating that the generals and soldiers should be determined to seek life in death, fulfill the duties of revolutionary soldiers, sacrifice themselves to serve the country, preserve the history of revolutionary soldiers, reward meritorious service generously, provide generous compensation for those who die in battle, fight bravely, replenish losses immediately, and punish those who fail to suppress effectively or violate the revolution with joint liability. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Xie Bin paid a visit to Chiang today to report on bandit suppression, and to seek instructions. Chiang personally drafted an order and had it distributed by air in the bandit areas, stating that only bandit leaders were to be killed, not bandit soldiers, and that the people in the bandit areas should quickly kill all the Red bandits and return to the fold, restoring their freedom and various other matters. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Provincial and City Chambers of Commerce held a banquet for General Commander Chiang today, and the entire city and county displayed flags to welcome him. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Cai Tingkai, Xie Bin, and Gu Zhutong returned to their posts after visiting Chiang. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Zhang Daofan arrived in the province on the 30th. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chiang announced on the 30th that it was forbidden to conscript laborers, force purchases, occupy civilian houses, or extort money. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The case of Korean people gathering a crowd to forcibly open up paddy fields in Wanbaoshan, Changchun. Our side, based on the farmers' appeal, has repeatedly negotiated. The Japanese side not only ignored it, but also sent armed police to the scene, nominally to protect, but in reality to help the Korean people excavate. The reporter had expected that it would definitely cause a great disaster and had given some warnings. Now, according to Japanese news reports, Chinese farmers and Korean people have had a major conflict because of this. Chinese and Japanese armed police rushed to join the fighting with weapons. The Japanese side will also send an infantry regiment to assist. The seriousness of the situation can already be seen. This newspaper has not yet received a report from its reporters on this matter. It is not clear what caused the conflict recently. The truth is unknown. However, according to the Japanese report, 500 Chinese farmers rushed to the Korean settlement and destroyed the Yitong River Korean paddy fields, which led to a conflict with the Korean people. It is said that the Chinese are weak in nature and may not use such harsh methods to deal with the Korean people. Even if it is as reported by the Japanese, the responsibility still rests with the Korean people for the Chinese farmers destroying the Yitong River paddy fields. Why? Because the paddy fields that the Korean people are forcibly digging are paddy fields that have not been approved or filed, and have not been agreed to by the landowners. Moreover, after being occupied by the Japanese, first, the farmland of Chinese people is cut into two sections due to the waterway, which seriously hinders farming. Second, building a dam in the middle reaches of the Yitong River blocks the water, causing thousands of hectares of farmland upstream and downstream to suffer water damage. Third, the Yitong River is a navigable river for the two counties of Chang and Nong. If a dam is built in the middle reaches, it will greatly hinder transportation. This situation has been clarified by officials from both China and Japan. The truth is clear. The report has also been disclosed in newspapers, which is obvious to everyone. For the sake of protecting their lives and property, and protecting legitimate rights and navigation, the Chinese farmers absolutely cannot tolerate it. Since the joint investigation by both parties, we have hoped that the Japanese authorities would handle the matter impartially and restrain the actions of the Korean people. However, it is unexpected that they still ignored it and allowed the Korean people to run rampant. How can the Chinese farmers endure it again and sit and wait to be slaughtered? Therefore, no matter what, the Korean people cannot shirk the blame for this conflict, and the Japanese authorities cannot shirk their responsibility. If at this time, the Japanese side does not suddenly realize this and quickly stop it, but deliberately exaggerates and sends troops to help in the fighting, then it is truly wanting to cause a great disaster and offend the world. I believe that the Japanese authorities' intentions will not be like this.</p>

<p>(Qingdao) Zhang Honglie, the director of the Shandong Construction Department, and others came to Qingdao to participate in the Jiaoji Railway Coal Price Parity Conference, which has been completed, and the methods have been drafted and taken to Jinan. They will be implemented after Han agrees. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, and He Siyuan, Director of the Education Department, went to Qingdao to open the Jiaoji Railway Coal Price Appraisal Committee. They returned to Jinan with Ge Guangting today. Ge said that this matter is a local administration matter, and the provincial government will form an appraisal committee to ban coal merchants from hoarding for profit. Because coal merchants transport coal to Qingdao and Jinan, the cost is as high as 11 yuan, but they sell it for 20 yuan. The entire line transports 1.1 million tons of coal annually, and 400,000 tons are exported from Qingdao. Ge also said that the Daoji extension line has now been inspected to Linqing. The Boshan extension line has been surveyed, which is more than 20 li long, and the estimated construction cost is 2 million yuan. Construction is planned. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>US Sends New Memorandum to France</p>
<p>Disagreements Remain on Four Points</p>
<p>France in a Precarious Position</p>
<p>Will Ultimately Have to Comply Reluctantly</p>
<p>Italy's Attitude is Frank and Forthright</p>
<p>German Authorities Postpone Trip to Rome</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 1st - New hope has emerged today in the US-France negotiations. President Hoover has sent a new memorandum to the French government, which was personally delivered this afternoon to French Premier Laval by US Treasury Secretary Mellon. After receiving it, Laval immediately proposed postponing all discussions until 9:30 AM on Thursday, so the French government could study the memorandum. Regarding the content of the memorandum, US Ambassador Edge has released a summary, stating that so far, the US and France have agreed on two points, but disagreements remain on four points: (1) After the general countries pay unconditional reparations to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), France wants the BIS to lend this money directly to German industrial and financial institutions, not directly to the German government. (2) Germany proposed lending US$25 million to Central European countries, but the US believes this violates the original intention of Hoover's proposal. (3) The repayment period for suspended payments differs between France and the US, but even though the US proposed 25 years, if repayments could begin in the third year, a compromise could still be negotiated. (4) The US considers the dangers worried about by France to be insignificant, believing that if all relevant countries can fully agree to accept the suspension proposal, there is no risk of damaging creditworthiness. The above four points are where the two sides have yet to agree. As for the points currently agreed upon: (1) France will suspend collecting any reparations payments from Germany for one year. (2) The US can recognize France's principle that unconditional reparations should not be suspended, as recognizing this principle will not harm the actual relief obtained by Germany.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 1st - US Acting Secretary of State Castle stated that the negotiations between the US and France regarding the suspension of war debts were conducted after initial discussions with President Hoover, making his words even more credible. The US has warned France through its ambassador to France that if President Hoover's plan fails, Germany will inevitably declare a suspension of war debts. If so, France will lose more than 100,000,000 yuan in the coming year. The US pointed out that the French government's suggestion to deposit funds into the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to be re-lent to German industries rather than the German government, and to also be lent to other Central European countries, contradicts President Hoover's proposal.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 1st - Important parts of President Hoover's proposal were again discussed in detail this afternoon by representatives from both France and the US. The negotiations were not completed when the meeting adjourned, and another meeting will be held tomorrow night. French Premier Laval issued a statement after the meeting, saying that the US is still willing to continue negotiations, but there are still differences in views between France and the US. Treasury Secretary Mellon also issued a statement explaining the US position, which was largely the same as the above. The French cabinet will study Mellon's letter tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 1st - Contrary to general expectations, the US-France talks have so far failed to produce a definite solution to the issue of French cooperation with the Hoover plan. Today, US Treasury Secretary Mellon, Ambassador Edge, French Premier Laval, Foreign Minister Briand, and Finance Minister Flandin met for two hours but ended without result. The reason is that Mellon sent a memorandum to Laval, repeatedly describing the aims and motivations of Hoover's original plan. The French side felt this memorandum required reconsideration. When the meeting adjourned today, it was announced that discussions would resume tomorrow night at 9:30 PM. Therefore, both sides are still hesitant, and it is difficult to predict the truth of the matter. Some say that Laval, backed by the support of the parliament, is in an equal but opposing position to the US representatives. At this time, it is extremely difficult to dismiss his insistence that Germany must continue to pay unconditional reparations and make concessions. However, others say that France's position is by no means unshakeable. If President Hoover insists on his plan, even without French cooperation, he will implement it, then France will be in a precarious position and will have to comply reluctantly. The latter statement has been denied by Washington, but it still cannot dispel the speculations of ordinary people, because Washington later stated that there are two points among the three key points of the US, Germany, etc., that Washington cannot concede on. As for the French newspapers, they are currently showing great anxiety, and are coldly mocking and criticizing Italy, the US, and Germany without distinction. The French newspapers believe that Italy's recent notification to Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria, declaring a temporary waiver of reparations pending resolution of the Hoover plan, is a display of affection that damages France's position.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 1st - After the Italian government announced yesterday that it was waiving the reparations owed to Italy due on July 1, it issued an important statement today, saying that Italy is determined to actively support President Hoover's plan. If Germany is unwilling to cooperate, it can be listened to, and the remaining allied countries must accept the proposal for suspension of payments.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st - When the stock exchange opened today, prices fell due to public uncertainty. In the afternoon, prices rose as rumors spread that France and the US had reached an agreement on everything in Paris.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 1st - Official sources here announced that Premier Belluzzo and Foreign Minister Curti will hardly be able to come to Italy before July and early August. It is expected that it will only be possible after President Hoover's plan to suspend debt payments is realized. As for the matters to be discussed between Germany and Italy in the future, they will be limited to the issues of international disarmament and the German-Austrian customs union.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 1st - The government has accepted the Liberal Party's proposed amendment to exempt sports grounds from land tax. This move will save the government from defeat in the House of Commons, as the Liberal Party met on June 29 and decided that if the government did not concede, it would put this amendment to a vote.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - Liberal Party's Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Viscount Allendale, has resigned due to dissatisfaction with the Liberal Party's sacrifice of its independence on the government's land tax bill.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - The issue of extraterritoriality in China and the Feetham Report was raised again in the House of Commons today. Conservative MP Locker-Lampson asked Foreign Secretary Henderson whether he could wait until the Feetham Report was presented to the House of Commons before issuing his statement on extraterritoriality. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dalton replied that the Foreign Secretary's statement must be issued when the vote on foreign affairs is put to discussion. The timing of the debate is up to the opposition party. Dalton also said that the first volume of the Feetham Report has been placed in the House of Commons library, and the second volume will also be sent to the library within the next half month, but the Foreign Secretary cannot guarantee that the debate will only begin after the second volume has been received.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - The Indian Labour Investigation Group, composed of former House of Commons Speaker Whitley and six British and six Indian representatives, today published its report, containing 357 recommendations, mostly advisory, aimed at alleviating the appalling conditions in factories not covered by factory laws, such as unsanitary conditions, the practice of corporal punishment, and long working hours. The report stated that young child laborers work 10 to 12 hours a day and earn only two annas per day. The report argued that working conditions in mines, farms, railways, and shipyards urgently need to be improved, and detailed the issue of debt bondage, stating that most workers are in debt for life, with interest rates sometimes as high as 150 percent per year. The report advocated reducing the weekly working hours from 60 to 54 hours, and limiting the working hours of child laborers to a maximum of five hours per day.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - British Prime Minister MacDonald mentioned in the House of Commons on May 26 that the Indian government's finances are strained due to the economic downturn, and the financial strain is further aggravated by the discussion of constitutional changes and the lack of certainty in incorporating guarantees of financial stability into the new constitution. Constitutional changes are difficult to make unless financial stability is guaranteed. When asked about this statement in the House of Commons today, the Prime Minister replied that there has been no financial assistance to the Indian government, and he hoped and believed that this would not happen in the future. His previous remarks were intended to dispel misunderstandings until the constitutional issue is resolved and provisions guaranteeing the maintenance of India's creditworthiness are established.</p>

<p>June 9th at the Tokyo Headquarters</p>
<p>Looking at the above table as a whole, the only claim from all levels of Japanese society is to actively invade our country. It is almost as if they regard our country as a land without people. If this is tolerable, what is intolerable? Is our country really devoid of people? If not, then aspiring men should rise up and shake their arms.</p>
<p>The general claims of the Japanese are so strong and unreasonable. Therefore, in this negotiation, it is not difficult for us to imagine the attitude of the Japanese representatives in proposing their proposals. However, the representatives of the two sides have not yet formally convened. We cannot know exactly what the Japanese proposals are. However, according to the conversation between Kimura, the director of the South Manchuria Railway, and Mr. Gao Jiyi, our representative, on June 6, the issues that the Japanese side is preparing to raise seem to be (1) the construction of railways in various routes with which Japan has treaties and agreements; (2) the issue of parallel lines of the South Manchuria Railway; (3) the revision of freight rates in a certain area and the issue of not competing with freight rates in the future; and (4) the conversion of the engineering costs owed to the Japanese side by various roads contracted by the Japanese into loans. The Japanese proposals in the future may not be limited to these four items. Let us now briefly predict and criticize only these four items.</p>
<p>An independent country has sacred sovereignty. In the past, the Japanese relied on unequal treaties to build railways in our country, infringing on our sovereignty. Every time we heard the whistling sound of the South Manchuria Railway, we deeply felt the loss of sovereignty. The great rivers and mountains were trampled on by foreign iron hooves. We are eagerly seeking to abolish all unequal treaties, recover all foreign railways, and restore our sovereignty. Now the Japanese want to view our emerging nation with the same eyes as before. Times are different, and the environment is also different. The Japanese are rehashing old things, only increasing our country's aversion. It can be said to be unwise. May I ask whether Japan can allow other countries to build railways in Japan? Moreover, was the establishment of the unequal treaties on which the Japanese rely voluntary by our country, or did it come from the oppression of the Japanese? It is too much already, how can it be allowed again? The second item, the so-called parallel line problem, is also an unreasonable request. Our side will find it impossible to accept it. Our country is developing rich resources, and it is building railways in its own territory, whether horizontal or vertical. The sovereignty lies in our hands. No country can interfere. What is more, the only reason the Japanese oppose our country building parallel lines with the South Manchuria Railway is based on the conference record in the Sino-Japanese negotiations in the 31st year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. (The Japanese said there was another draft treaty, which was forged.) The record is not a formal resolution, let alone a formal treaty. Everyone knows this. How can it be used as a reason to infringe on our sacred sovereignty? Taking a step back, even if the requirements put forward by the Japanese are reasonable, there should also be restrictions on the so-called parallel. According to European and American practice, it is mostly limited to 60 miles on either side of the track. The Japanese used unlimited articles to recklessly interfere unreasonably. As a result, in addition to our country turning a deaf ear and sitting idly by watching the South Manchuria Railway network crisscrossing our country, any construction within or outside our territory can be interfered with for the reason that it is parallel to the South Manchuria Railway or other barbaric reasons. Our country has railways, but when will it have the day of construction? The Japanese always talk about coexistence and co-prosperity, but what they are proposing now is to seek the prosperity of the South Manchuria Railway and the decline of our country's railways. Therefore, our country will absolutely not recognize the so-called parallel line problem. From the perspective of the above two issues, they have exceeded the scope of this negotiation. Kimura raised it, and our representative Mr. Gao Jiyi expressed his refusal to accept it. We are deeply gratified by Mr. Gao's shrewdness and competence. As for the other two issues of revising freight rates and loans, they are within the scope of this negotiation. Our representatives can solemnly negotiate based on the facts. There is no need for us to argue tediously. Now, in order to make the people of the country aware of the conspiracy of the Japanese proposals, the main points of the content of the four proposals put forward by Kimura and their own goals are expressed as follows.

Now that the general offensive is imminent, in addition to issuing orders to all generals by telegram regarding the combat plan, communication methods, and offensive steps, Chiang also issued an order yesterday (30th) through the General Staff Office to the anti-communist soldiers on the front line to implement the system of joint responsibility. If the division commander does not retreat, but the brigade/regiment commander retreats first, they will be killed without mercy. The same applies if the brigade commander does not retreat, but the regiment/battalion/company commander retreats. The rest can be deduced by analogy. Therefore, the military orders are strict and morale is very high. As for the situation of the bandits in the front, there have been slight changes in recent days. Except for the bandits who invaded Nanfeng, Nancheng, and Yihuang, who have retreated to the old nest of Guangchang, Ningdu, and Xingguo, the rest have retreated to the Fujian border. According to Fuzhou telegrams, a portion of Zhu and Mao's Red bandits are now searching for strong men in Guangze and Shaowu house by house, forcing them to join the Red Army and Red Guards. Those who escape are in a state of mutual support and displacement, and the situation is extremely miserable. On the western Jiangxi front, the bandits on the west bank of the Gan River are only a small group. The east bank of the Gan River is where Peng and Huang's main force is located. The front line of the bandits is still in the area of Futian, Donggu, Yaotian, Tengtian, Baisha, Gubi, and Luojiawei on the borders of Yongfeng, Jishui, and Ji'an. At the moment, the anti-communist army is preparing to pursue them. (1st)</p>
<h3 id="e54">New Regulations for Canton's Market to Underwrite Military Bonds <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Still Allowed to Use Central Bank Notes for Payment</p>
<p>Bond Commission Also Newly Determined</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Guangdong authorities issued 10 million yuan of the second phase of military bonds, they immediately drafted measures to promote sales in various ways. The largest amount was underwritten by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, amounting to 2 million yuan. However, representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have repeatedly visited the authorities, requesting changes to the sales methods to avoid embarrassment for the business community. Since the decline in the value of Central Bank notes, the Guangzhou market has been extremely sluggish. If each industry is required to sell 2 million yuan of bonds, the burden on businesses would be greatly increased. Therefore, a meeting was held recently to resolve the issue, requesting consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses, canceling the underwriting requirement, and allowing each industry in the Chamber of Commerce to freely promote sales. It also requested that the original plan be maintained, allowing for phased payments using Central Bank notes to encourage bond purchases. The financial authorities initially refused the request, insisting on full payment in silver. However, today, considering the urgent need for military funds and the difficulty in delaying bond sales, the authorities have accommodated the demands of the business community and formulated alternative measures for bond sales, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Payment with Central Bank notes: Those who subscribe within one month from June 26th (i.e., until July 26th) will be allowed to use Central Bank notes for 40% of the payment. Those who subscribe within two months (i.e., until August 26th) will be allowed to use Central Bank notes for 20% of the payment, limited to one-yuan and five-yuan notes. (2) Commission Deduction: Promoters who sell 90% of the bonds within two months (i.e., from June 26th) will be entitled to a 4% commission deduction, those who sell 80% will be entitled to a 3% commission deduction, and those who sell 70% will be entitled to a 2% commission deduction. Those who sell less than 70% or are late will not be entitled to a commission deduction. All commission deductions will be based on the amount paid. The above payment with Central Bank notes is only applicable to Guangzhou City. Other counties and cities will continue to follow the original regulations. (June 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e55">Resolution of the Tianjin Haihe River Work Stoppage <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Riverbed Silt Suddenly Rises After the Work Stoppage</p>
<p>Foreigners in the Engineering Bureau Reluctantly Concede</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: On June 7th, the employees of the Tianjin Haihe River Engineering Bureau raised seven demands, including improved treatment and increased salaries. The Bureau did not accept these demands, leading to a work stoppage. The Haihe River is located in the lower reaches of the five major rivers in North China. During floods, the Yongding River carries a large amount of sand, which is deposited on the riverbed of the Haihe River. Therefore, a special engineering bureau was established to be responsible for dredging. The recent work stoppage by the Bureau's employees has caused larger merchant ships to find it difficult to enter the port due to the sudden rise in riverbed silt. As a result, the entire city's merchants and residents recognized that the work stoppage was not a local issue but was related to the interests of North China. They appealed to the authorities to resolve the issue quickly. However, the actual power of the Haihe River Engineering Bureau is largely controlled by foreigners.</p>
<p>The foreigners in the Bureau acted as if nothing had happened. Relevant water conservancy agencies in the city also formed a mediation committee to negotiate with both labor and management. However, after half a month, the Secretary-General of the Bureau, Gambole (an Englishman), stubbornly adhered to his opinions, not only considering the employees' demands unreasonable but also denying the legitimacy of the legally established labor union. As the Haihe River deteriorated due to the stoppage of work, external criticism increased. Chairman Wang and Mayor Zhang were both in Peiping taking care of Deputy Commander Zhang, who was ill, and had not returned. The mediation authorities had to telegraph Peiping, requesting instructions on how to proceed. They soon received a telegram from Peiping, ordering the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Lu Yixian, to negotiate with the Bureau and instructing the Bureau to pay attention to the interests of Chinese employees. If unexpected losses were incurred, the Bureau would be fully responsible. As a result, the Bureau convened a meeting of directors, including the American Consul Gauss and the Tianjin Customs Commissioner Lu Jia, to discuss the matter. In the end, they agreed to accept the workers' demands, but the content was modified. The resolution was reached last night (the 29th), and the employees have all resumed work today (the 30th). The terms of the resolution are as follows: (1) The Board of Directors will prepare a list of employees dismissed by the Bureau, stating the reasons for dismissal, and submit it to the Labor Union Council. (2) The Board of Directors will prepare to grant the following temporary subsidies due to the increased cost of living: 10% for those with a monthly salary of 30 yuan or less, 8% for those with a monthly salary of 50 yuan or less, and 6% for those with a monthly salary of more than 50 yuan. (3) From March 1, 1931, after three years, the Board of Directors will re-adjust the current salary scale by 10%, depending on the situation. (4) The Board of Directors finds it difficult to advance retirement subsidies and pensions (granted to employees who served in the Bureau before January 1, 1930, upon death or forced retirement). Regarding the request to issue savings deposit receipts, the savings deposit regulations stipulate that a list is issued to each person annually, stating the amount of savings in their name and the interest due. All retirement subsidies are calculated based on the years of service before January 1, 1930. (5) From March 1, 1931, the Board of Directors will implement a method whereby the probationary period for employees promoted to higher positions in the Bureau will not exceed four months before they are officially promoted or the temporary acting position is lifted. (6) The Board of Directors is prepared to be considerate of those who have served in the Bureau for more than 20 years and wish to resign voluntarily to enjoy all benefits, but it must be known that the approval of such requests depends on the needs of the work and the financial situation. (7) When there are vacancies, the Board of Directors may give priority to employing those who were laid off from the Xihua and Beihe dredgers in 1930, but it cannot be considered a reinstatement of their original positions, but as new hires. It is also heard that although the salaries of Chinese workers in the Bureau have recently increased slightly, the difference in treatment between Chinese and foreign workers is still significant. Foreigners are paid in taels, with a minimum of 150 taels per month and a maximum of 1,700 taels. Chinese are paid in silver dollars, with a maximum of only 160 yuan per month. Currently, the local authorities and the public in the city are planning to continue to take over the Haihe River Engineering Bureau and operate it independently. (June 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Resolution of the Changsha Entertainment Tax Dispute <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>City Party Headquarters Mediates with Four Measures</p>
<p>All Theaters are Unsealed and Reopened</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Guo Fangrui, Director of the Changsha Municipal Preparatory Office, ordered all theaters to collect an entertainment tax of 5% from the audience as funding for primary school education. Theaters were unwilling to collect the tax due to the difficulty of finding change and the cumbersome procedures, requesting the Office to send staff to collect the tax directly. If theaters were required to collect the tax, it would be impossible to find change in Changsha, as there are no small coins or ten-cash copper coins. (For example, if the ticket price is one dime, collecting a tax of five li would require 28 wen, which is impossible to collect.) The result would inevitably be borne by the theater owners. The theaters already pay business tax, stamp tax, and police tax, which is a heavy burden. They requested that the entertainment tax rate be reduced to 3%. However, Guo Fangrui refused to send staff directly to collect the tax and only proposed reducing the rate to 4%. The theaters still believed that the people only have the obligation to pay taxes and no right to collect them, repeatedly requesting the government to send staff directly to collect the tax. Guo still refused and closed all the new and old theaters and cinemas in Changsha at 5:00 pm on June 25th, ordering them to cease operations. More than 1,000 people in the theater industry suddenly lost their jobs and petitioned the Party and government agencies on the 26th. On the 27th, they hosted the Changsha press at the Qizhen Pavilion, reporting on the Municipal Office's order to collect taxes and the closure of the theaters, as well as the difficulties of collecting taxes and the reasons for requesting direct collection, seeking assistance. As a result, the Citizen's Daily, Evening News, and You News all published articles criticizing the Municipal Office's inappropriate measures. The Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters also did not approve of Guo's abrupt closure of the theaters. The Changsha Municipal Party Headquarters took on the role of mediation and agreed on four measures to reduce the tax rate, sending a letter to the Municipal Preparatory Office for its consideration. Guo had no choice but to accept the measures. In addition to replying to the Municipal Party Headquarters that it would comply, it also sent letters to the police stations to unseal all theaters on the evening of the 27th. The theaters then scheduled to reopen on the 28th, and the dispute came to an end. The instructions from the Changsha Municipal Party Headquarters to the Changsha Theater Industry Association and the official letter from the Municipal Office to the police stations to unseal the theaters are recorded as follows: 1. The Municipal Party Headquarters' instructions to the Theater Industry Association stated: "Yesterday, the Association's representative, Zu Yingqi, and others submitted a request to forward a letter to the Municipal Office to reduce the entertainment tax to alleviate business difficulties. The Headquarters has formulated four measures and sent a letter to the Municipal Office for its consideration. The Municipal Office's official letter in reply stated, 'In response to your Association's letter from the Theater Industry Association's representative, Zu Yingqi, and others, regarding the entertainment tax of 5% being too burdensome, requesting a reduction, we have formulated the following measures: (1) Tickets priced at one dime or less will be exempt from tax (as Han operas mostly sell for only 16 copper coins). (2) Han operas priced above one dime will be taxed at 3%. (3) All other tickets will be taxed at 3.5%. (4) Tickets will be submitted to your office to be stamped before being sold.' We approve of this. Our office respects your Association's wishes and will be accommodating. However, each theater should submit the above request to our office for forwarding to the higher authorities for review. We are replying to you accordingly. Please inform your members to comply and strictly implement these measures. This is of utmost importance. This order." 2. The Municipal Office's official letter to the police stations to unseal the theaters stated: "Regarding the collection of entertainment tax, the Municipal Party Headquarters has taken on the role of mediation. Our office plans to submit a request to the Construction Department for forwarding to the Provincial Government for review. We have dispatched the collection director, Chen Ruizhang, to your station. Please send police to accompany him to the theaters to temporarily unseal them and resume operations. In addition to sending separate letters, we are sending this letter to your station. Please take note." (June 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Zhejiang Provincial Government Accuses Supervisory Yuan Councilor Gao Shuo <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Wulin Paper Mill Case</p>
<p>Investigation: The Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Shanghai Jingcheng Paper Company terminated the lease agreement and put the Wulin Paper Mill up for auction. The company filed a lawsuit with the Hangzhou County District Court a month ago, and a hearing has been held, but no judgment has been made. The company recently filed a complaint with the Supervisory Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan sent Councilor Gao Shuo to Hangzhou to investigate. Gao sealed the Wulin Paper Mill. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has submitted a report to the Supervisory Yuan regarding Gao's actions in Hangzhou and the auction of the Wulin Paper Mill, requesting that the official be punished according to the law and that an impartial person be sent to Hangzhou for a thorough investigation. The report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"The Supervisory Yuan sent Councilor Gao Shuo to investigate the government's auction of the Wulin Paper Mill. Upon arriving at the Construction Department to review the files, he took them away after reading them. He then came to the government to review the files and also took away some of them. This is his duty, so it should be the case. However, Councilor Gao made various absurd remarks outside, only defaming the government, and publicly told Jiang Zhicheng, the magistrate of Hangzhou County, that the Construction Department was influenced by others in the paper mill matter and that the provincial government was full of corruption. When he went to the Construction Department again, Director Shi Ying was out on official business, and Councilor Gao claimed that Shi Ying was afraid of seeing him and was hiding. Those who heard this knew he was a madman and could only laugh it off. At noon today, according to a report from the Construction Department, at 11:00 am, Supervisory Yuan Councilor Gao Shuo posted two seals of the National Government Supervisory Yuan in the machine room of the Wulin Paper Mill, dated June 26th of the 20th year, stating that all the machinery of the Wulin Paper Mill, which is the property of Zhejiang Province, was preserved. The new film of the seals has been made, please review it. We immediately sent someone to invite Councilor Gao to the government. It was the date of the regular meeting, and all the commissioners were present. We asked Councilor Gao why he sealed the Wulin Paper Mill. He said he was afraid of destroying evidence. We asked why he did not notify the government. He said he did not trust the provincial government. We asked Councilor Gao on what basis he told the magistrate of Hangzhou County that the Construction Department was influenced by others and that the provincial government was full of corruption. He hesitated and could not answer. When the magistrate of Hangzhou County was summoned, he stared blankly and said nothing. Article 2 of the Supervisory Yuan's rules for investigation states that investigators may temporarily seal off the relevant case files when necessary. Councilor Gao ignored the facts, arbitrarily slandered the government, violated the rules, and illegally sealed the paper mill. What was his intention? It is said that Councilor Gao embezzled public funds when he worked in a financial institution in Peiping. Now he has taken refuge under the National Government and should repent and atone for his past sins in this solemn place. Instead, he is repeating his old tricks, thinking that the government will be perfunctory. His ignorance is truly incorrigible. In addition to submitting a separate report on the entire case of the auction of the Wulin Paper Mill, we hereby submit a report on Councilor Gao's absurd actions in Hangzhou, requesting that you review it and punish him according to the law to deter others and uphold the foundation of the country. We also request that you send another impartial person to Hangzhou for a thorough investigation. If the investigation confirms that Gao Shuo's allegations are true, I and Construction Department Director Shi Ying are willing to carry thorns and go to Beijing to receive the most severe punishment. Respectfully submitted to Yu, the President of the National Government Supervisory Yuan."</p>
<h3 id="e58">Progress of the Longhai Western Section Construction <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>May Be Open to Wenxiang by Mid-July</p>
<p>May Be Open to Tongguan by November</p>
<p>The construction of the new section of the Longhai Western Section from Lingbao to Tongguan, a distance of 72 kilometers, has been progressing rapidly in recent months. The Lingbao Twelve-Arch Iron Bridge was completed on June 22nd. Construction material trains have now reached Chou Sang. At the same time, the tracks are being laid westward. It is heard that the Engineering Bureau has set a deadline of July 15th to open the line to Wenxiang County, about 28 kilometers from Lingbao. In addition to construction material trains, passenger tickets may also be sold. As for west of Wenxiang, because there are still many bridge arches that will take time to construct, it will be necessary to wait until early November to open the line to Tongguan.</p>
<p>The Central Government has long stipulated that the construction cost of the Tongguan to Xi'an section should be funded by the Russo-Geng indemnity. However, it is heard that the issuance of public bonds has not yet been carried out, so the funds have not yet been secured. In order to start construction urgently, the Ministry of Railways is advancing several tens of thousands of yuan per month. The Engineering Bureau has already contracted out the earthwork for the 24-kilometer section from Tongguan to Huayin. The remaining work can only be started when funds are secured. The survey team for the route re-survey is continuing to work west of Huayin and has reached Weinan. It is expected that Xi'an will be reached by mid-August. Tongguan City is located north of the Yellow River and south of high mountains, with a very dangerous terrain. It is heard that the original route was determined to run along the north bank of the Yellow River. However, due to the turbulent waters of the Yellow River and the strong bamboo brushes, the water flow is already approaching the city walls. It is no longer possible to build a road outside the city. The route has now been changed to dig a tunnel outside Jingmen City, passing through the city and emerging from the city on flat ground to reach the West Gate Railway Station. However, since this line passes through the city, more than 100 houses will have to be demolished. The families whose houses are being demolished have jointly requested a change of route. After repeated studies by the Engineering Bureau, it was considered that the demolition of houses along this line was already the minimum possible and could not be avoided in fact. Chairman Yang Hucheng also went to Tongguan to earnestly persuade the families to be demolished, and they have fully complied with the order to demolish their houses. The Tongguan tunnel through the city is 1,070 meters long and will take nine months to complete. Therefore, the Engineering Bureau has first built a temporary station outside the East Gate to facilitate passengers and merchants, so that when the tracks are laid to this point, tickets can be sold and the line can be opened. The tunnel construction does not interfere with this.</p>

<p>Return of Zhang Yu's Property Zhang Yu, a native of the county, was wanted by the former Military Affairs Commission in the autumn of 1927 for colluding with the enemy, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government was ordered to seal up his property. This year, Zhang Yu's son, Zhang Jing'an, requested the Ministry of Military Affairs to allow his father, who is old and senile, to be pardoned under the New Year's Day amnesty. "The approvals have been received, and the original case has been ordered to be revoked. A request has also been submitted to the Executive Yuan to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to return the sealed property." The Executive Yuan, based on the report from the Ministry of Military Affairs, has issued an order to approve and has submitted the case to the National Government for the record, and has ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and handle the matter. All of Zhang Yu's property in Nantong and Dongtai will be returned in full upon the provincial order.</p>
<p>Temporary Court Temporarily Difficult to Establish The Nantong Temporary Court must await a decision from the Executive Yuan.

<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs in the Fifth District: He Yousheng, a resident of Xietouqiao Village near Hengshan Bridge in the Fifth District of Wuyi County, is a moderately wealthy man. His son is deceased, leaving behind a widow with a six-year-old child, living a lonely life. Unexpectedly, more than ten bandits, each armed with firearms, broke into the house and robbed them in the middle of the night on the 30th of last month. They also forced the widow to hand over her child. The bandits then took the child and fled north with a shout, warning her not to report the incident. The victim's family is currently negotiating the ransom.</p>

<p>Gu Wangqi Safely Escapes: Gu Wangqi, a villager from Gu Gengshang in Xicang Township of this county, was kidnapped from his home by bandits in the middle of the night on the 26th day of the old lunar calendar's fourth month, and his whereabouts were unknown. There were two false reports that he had been killed by the bandits, and corpses had been found, but none could be identified, so nothing could be confirmed. However, in the middle of the night the day before yesterday, Gu suddenly and safely escaped and returned home. According to his account, the kidnappers numbered six in total and spoke with Jiangyin and Changshu accents. They carried Browning pistols. After arriving at Gu's house, they first searched and looted a large bundle of clothes, then used cloth to blindfold Gu. They ran wildly to the northwest for about three miles before getting on a boat. The boat sailed all day, and only at night was the cloth removed. The boat was then moored in reeds surrounded by water. Subsequently, the bandit leader forced him to write a letter to his family to ask for money for his ransom, but Gu claimed that he couldn't write. The bandits were furious and said that no matter what, at least 1,000 yuan would be required to release him. He was held on the boat for more than ten days under strict guard. On the night before last, there was a thunderstorm, and Gu saw that the bandits guarding him were fast asleep. He then found a way to move the boat to the shore, went ashore, and escaped in secret. It took him two days and nights to escape back to his home.</p>
<p>Kidnapping and Robbery Cases Occur Continuously: Recently, robbery cases have been occurring continuously in the countryside. Just after the arrest of Qian Hai in the Tangtou Township robbery case, two more robbery cases occurred in Huangjiadang and Baojia Township. The details are as follows: (1) The Qian Xiexing Hotel in Huangjiadang at the intersection of the Xicheng Road in the Fifth District was broken into by bandits after 2:00 AM on the night before last, and two pieces of gold jewelry, worth a total of sixty or seventy yuan, were robbed. The victim reported the incident to the 13th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which in turn reported it to the County Bureau for investigation. (2) In the Great King Temple in Baojiaqiao in the Second District, six bandits broke into the temple on the night of the 30th, pried open the door, dragged the temple caretaker Li Ada out of bed, and silenced him with threats. About two hundred yuan in clothes and silver was robbed. The district chief of the area has reported the case to the county and requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Sisters-in-law Disagree, Swallow Gold to Commit Suicide: Sun Qian, a young woman from Huangnitou outside the North Gate of this county, is 21 years old and works as a female worker in a silk factory in Dongmen. Her husband, surnamed Sun, works as a boatman. The couple's relationship is relatively harmonious, but she is unable to get along with her sisters-in-law and often argues with them. Sun Qian became depressed and unhappy, and before the Dragon Boat Festival, she rented a separate workshop to live in. However, her sisters-in-law did not allow her to live outside and urged her parents-in-law to persuade her to return. However, Qian felt that living with her sisters-in-law again would inevitably cause conflict, so she developed the idea of suicide. She swallowed a gold ring the day before yesterday, and the next day she swallowed another gold ring. The day after that, she swallowed a silver chain and a pair of gold bracelets. Finally, she secretly swallowed half a yuan of raw opium and lay down on the bed. In a moment, the poison took effect, her face turned pale, and her breathing became faint. Later, her husband noticed and immediately sent her to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. After the hospital's doctors made every effort to perform surgery, she was able to turn the corner and recover.</p>

<p>Meeting of Singing Girls Scheduled: Gong Rongzhi, a supervisor of the County Public Security Bureau, was ordered to oversee the registration of singing girls. Each singing girl is required to pay 5 jiao as a fee for the Women's Relief Institute of the Relief Institute. Parents or representatives of singing girls were notified to attend a meeting on the 3rd at the Yangfang Study in Xin Street to discuss registration and regulations, which will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor Wang Shaoquan Beaten: Xu Shizhong, who runs the Dadong Inn inside Dadongmen, hired Wang Shaoquan, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor from Beiliuxiang, to treat his sick son. The child died with blood flowing from both nostrils, and Xu believed that Wang's medicine had killed him. One day, he falsely claimed he wanted another consultation and brought Wang to the inn. As soon as he arrived, Xu closed the door and beat him severely. Wang's cries for help reached outside. Fortunately, a police officer on duty heard the cries and rushed to the rescue, breaking down the door and arresting both parties to be sent to the Second Precinct in charge, and then to the First Precinct for review and handling. The Chinese Medicine Association learned of this and immediately convened an emergency meeting of all Chinese medicine doctors in the afternoon to discuss how to respond.</p>
<p>Melon Farmers Rush to Repair the East Section of the Riverbank: The riverbank in Guazhou collapsed. Zang Liuge, the head of the Second Autonomous District in charge, supervised the people to rush to repair the western section, which was 270 zhang long. Because several dozen zhang of the eastern section between Majigang suddenly collapsed, in addition to planning to estimate the cost of 15,000 yuan for labor and materials and 5,000 yuan for digging soil and moving graves, he submitted a report to the county to be forwarded to the authorities, requesting that 15,000 yuan be raised locally, and the rest be allocated by the authorities. He also ordered district officers to beat gongs to gather three to four thousand people on the 29th to start emergency repairs in advance, using the Guanyin Temple as a temporary office, in order to prevent further collapse and protect the lives of the people.</p>

<p>A Mutiny Case from the Mouth of a Soldier: The truth about the mutiny and robbery and killing by the Provincial Security Team stationed in Xincang is still unknown. Two of the fleeing soldiers have now been apprehended in Zhangyan Town, Jiangsu Province, and sent to the Second Regiment of the Jiangsu Security for interrogation. According to Zhang Shiyong, 19 years old, from Ningbo, who joined the 9th Squad of the company as a second-class soldier in April of this year, and Fang Fengtian, from Jiangxi, 22 years old, who joined the 9th Squad of the company as a first-class soldier last year, the incident occurred because the 16th Company's First Platoon was stationed in Xincang, the Second Platoon was stationed in Xinmiao, and the Third Platoon was stationed in Yaqian. The squad leader, Hu Bin, secretly used civilian telephones to communicate information. At 12:00 on the night of June 22, Hu Bin seized the wooden-cased gun of the Third Platoon leader and tied him up with a rope. He then ordered the brothers of each squad to load their bullets, led them to Xincang, and arrived at 1:30 AM. They met with the First and Second Platoons, all of whom were under the command of the Second Platoon Leader Zhou. Zhou sent the First Platoon to monitor the Public Security Bureau, and the Second and Third Platoons to stand guard. The Fourth Platoon leader led his subordinates to the Fourth District Office to borrow military pay. District Chief Zhu refused, so Hu Bin fired a shot and injured his foot, and they obtained 300 yuan. The robbery began at 4:30 AM. It was still dark, and the pawnshops were not open. Fearing that the army would come to suppress them, they did not dare to stay long. After about half an hour, they formed a line, led by a local guide, and rushed to Zhapu, arriving at 8:00 AM in the morning. They robbed a pawnshop for about an hour, then crossed the sea by boat. The boat I was on had 34 people. The remaining two boats were behind. When they arrived in Haiyan, they were pursued and disarmed by the security force. At 3:00 PM, they arrived at the Putuo Temple in the Outer Sea Mountains and stayed for one day. At 9:00 PM on the 24th, the 34 people went to Baisha Bay together and encountered the security force again. Because it was already dark, they were able to escape. That night, they fled to Jinshan. They were just thinking of taking a ship to Shanghai when they were apprehended in Zhangyan. The silver robbed this time was all in the possession of Platoon Leader Zhou and the squad leaders. We only received five yuan in military pay, etc. The two soldiers are still detained in the Second Regiment of the Jiangsu Security and will probably be sent here within a few days.</p>
<p>Demolition Begins on the Ancient Hall of the North Temple: The Great Hero Hall of the North Temple, commonly known as the Imperial Hall, was built during the Huichang era of the Tang Dynasty, more than 1,000 years ago, and is the oldest building in this county. However, due to years of disrepair, the eaves on the north side have collapsed beyond repair. Neither the public nor private sectors have funds to repair it. The local government has now hired workers to demolish it. It is said that the Buddhist Association also supports this move. Work began on the 29th.</p>

<p>Completion of Parasitic Wasp Protection Room: Biological control is a new trend in modern pest control. Therefore, the Zhejiang Provincial Plant Disease and Pest Control Institute has designated using insects to control insects as one of the control policies. However, the results of the large-scale purchase of rice borer egg masses in Jiangzhe over the years have often been burned, resulting in the destruction of both good and bad. The parasitic wasps, which are most effective in killing rice borer eggs, are also destroyed, which defeats the purpose of pest control. Wu Fuzhen, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Plant Disease and Pest Control Institute, recognizing this, after careful planning, cooperated with the Jiaxing County Pest Control Association to build a large-scale parasitic wasp protection and experimental room in Jiaxing. It has been exactly one month since construction began, and it has now been completed. The opening ceremony was held at 2:00 PM on June 28. Director Wu personally attended, and the Jiaxing County Administrative Commissioner and members of the Pest Control Committee also attended the ceremony.</p>

<p>Police and Bandits Exchange Fire, Intercept Bandit Boat: Jiang Boxiong, the chief of the Third District of the Nanxun Water Police, received a report from civilians the day before yesterday that four bandit boats with about 30 bandits had been discovered in the Hengguqiao area outside the west shed of Nanxun. After receiving the report, the district chief ordered Guo, the leader of the 5th Platoon of the 10th Squad, to lead more than 30 water police officers to suppress and capture the bandits. When the squad arrived at Jiuliqiao, they saw the bandit boats heading east. The two sides immediately exchanged fire for about two hours. The bandits were unable to resist and fled ashore. Two bandit boats were captured, and two bandits, Duan Dejin and Duan Yongyou, were captured, and one hostage was rescued. The squad took them back for interrogation. It has been heard that the hostage is Zhu Xingsheng from Nihe Dou in Shuanglin, who was kidnapped by bandits last month. District Chief Jiang has now notified the family to come and claim him.</p>
<p>Bandits Intercept Civilian Boat: A resident of Hongxingqiao in Huzhou hired Xie Zirong, a relative, to come to Huzhou by boat yesterday to pick up his two sons who were studying at a school in this city, as the summer vacation has arrived. Unexpectedly, when passing the ferry crossing of Yangjiazhuang, about seven li from this city, two bandits, each holding a pistol, shouted for them to stop the boat. The boatman, seeing that the bandits had weapons, had to dock the boat and let the bandits get on board and search. All the cash that Xie had with him was robbed.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>I have recently received a statement from my client, Ms. Yang Shuzhen, claiming that in the "Suzhou Communication" news item published in the Outer Ports Communication column on the third page of the Shen Bao on June 4 of this year, the headline was "Hu Zhiqin Divorce Case Appealed and Settled," and the content stated that Hu Zhiqin served as a clerk in a cloth store at the age of sixteen and fell in love with Yang Shuzhen, a woman from Changzhou who lived next door to the store. Later, they rented a place to live in in Jiumudi. Hu suspected that Yang was having an affair with his friend Wang Jingfei, which led to quarrels and a breakup, and a divorce agreement was signed. Later, Hu suddenly asked Yang Shuzhen for subsidies for losses, etc. These details are not entirely accurate. The marriage agreement in this case was arranged by a matchmaker at Hu Zhiqin's request and was not a casual affair. The reason for the termination of the agreement was that Hu Zhiqin was addicted to smoking and unemployed, and had fallen in love with someone else. The statement in the news that Hu rented a house for them to live together is not true. The original report disclosing the above news occurred when she was bedridden and unable to move. Now, after a friend informed her of the situation, she feels that her reputation is at stake. Such distortion of facts is likely to cause confusion. Therefore, she has entrusted this lawyer to send a letter on her behalf, requesting a correction. I am writing this letter to request your newspaper to investigate and make the correction. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Jin Yu</p>

<h3 id="e73">Shanghai Municipal Elementary School Joint Graduation Ceremony <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau held the fourth joint graduation ceremony for elementary schools yesterday. More than 3,000 graduates, faculty, staff, and guests from various schools attended, making it a grand occasion. Zheng, Section Chief of the Municipal Education Bureau, presided over the meeting on behalf of the Director, and Zhang Angqian served as the recorder. The general situation is described below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Briefly stated that the city has a population of more than 3 million, but the city's schools and registered private elementary schools have only 2,759 graduates this time, including 1,518 graduates from city schools and 1,841 graduates from private schools. He hopes that the number of graduates from various schools will gradually increase in the future in order to achieve the goal of universal education in the city. Today's elementary school graduation ceremony held by this bureau has three meanings. The first is to make all the children understand that they have now completed national education. Elementary education is also called national education. Those who have completed national education are healthy citizens. Healthy citizens are people who are healthy in knowledge, morality, and physical fitness. They are adults, not children. After today's graduation ceremony, you, children, will be responsible, independent, and self-governing members of society, no longer dependent on parents and teachers like before. This is the first meaning of holding this ceremony, to call everyone's attention. The second is to make everyone understand that you have now completed basic education. Elementary education can also be called basic education. Elementary education is the foundation of all education, and it will be easy to gradually improve in the future. Children, you have learned the Party Ideology, Chinese, Arithmetic, Social Studies, Nature, and other courses of elementary school, and you have a foundation for all courses. You can already write, speak, read, calculate, and know about the major events of the Party and the country, the major events of the world, and the phenomena of the natural world. From now on, whether you go to work or go to school, if you want to study on your own or go to a higher-level school to study, it will be like a daily progress because you have a foundation, and you can definitely expect to be successful. This is the second point of today's ceremony to call everyone's attention. The third is to make everyone understand that you have now completed elementary education. Elementary education can also be called elementary education. Studying must follow the order and cannot be skipped. The ancients said that those who travel far must start from the near, and those who climb high must start from the low. Today, you have completed the first stage of elementary education, and you have already started to walk through the door of knowledge. From middle school to university, the future is unlimited. The beginning still cannot but start from elementary education. This is the third kind of meaning of today's ceremony to call everyone's attention. In short, the education business is no different from planting flowers. When you first entered elementary school, it was like a flower had sprouted. Every day, the educational administrative organs and the teachers of various schools worked hard to irrigate it, helping it to grow. Today, you have graduated from elementary school, just like a flower has buds. After that, you will go to school or build a career in society, and in the future, you will bloom and bear fruit. The future is bright. I urge all children to work hard.</p>
<p>Speech by the Mayor's Representative: Briefly stated that your graduation today is like a flower gradually blooming and bearing fruit. It is expected that the future will be realized and shine brightly, otherwise it will be a dark and dangerous future. At this time of great progress, the children who graduate in the future should cherish their precious youth, eliminate difficulties, and overcome the environment.</p>
<p>Chen Heqin's Speech: Briefly stated that today is one of the most glorious days for you children. It is hoped that you will be beautiful flowers and gradually full. Whether you go to school or work, you should pay attention to the word "learn." Edison's invention of science and the Prime Minister's not forgetting to read during the revolutionary period are all excellent models. As for the two words "be a person," you must also pay attention to how to imitate the Prime Minister's revolutionary spirit and studious spirit in order to contribute to society in the future. Subsequently, Li Bojun, the representative of the city school principal, and Li Yunbing, the representative of the school principal, gave speeches. Finally, the representatives of Wanzhu School, the graduate of the city school, and the representatives of Zijin School, the graduates of the private school, answered, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Labor University Students Request Continued Enrollment of New Students <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The National Labor University University Department's Declaration on the Ministry of Education's Second Suspension of Enrollment states: The laborers of the world have gradually awakened since the European Revolution, and are eager to break away from their historical shackles. Therefore, the labor movement has also occurred in China. With the development of the Three Principles of the People and the National Revolution, Chinese laborers are even more eager to obtain thorough liberation from now on. The purpose of this university is to comply with this trend of the times and to experiment with labor education and cultivate leadership talents to implement labor education. This is a well-known fact. Among the people of China, the toiling farmers and workers constitute the absolute majority. In order to complete the Chinese revolution, we must base it on the masses of farmers and workers. This is the reason why Prime Minister Sun Yat-sen first made the policy for farmers and workers, the meaning of which is to train the masses of farmers and workers to participate in the revolution, and improve their skills, strengthen their organizations, transform their lives, and enable them to obtain true liberation and complete the highest task of the revolution. This university was officially announced to be established in the autumn of the 16th year for this purpose. Since its establishment, this university has always attached equal importance to academic theory and technology and has cultivated the spirit of laborers in order to prepare to go deep into the ranks of the masses of farmers and workers. Its education system and meaning are completely different from ordinary universities. Compared with the Central Political School and the Military Academy, which train practical military and political talents, it is exactly the same. This is the special significance of the existence of this university. Although it has only been four years since its establishment, we dare not boast about how perfect the content is, and the speed of development is comparable to history. However, it can also be said to be quite gratifying. In principle, as this university, the product of the revolution, is in the process of development, the Ministry of Education, which bears the highest educational administrative responsibility of the country, should fulfill its responsibility to love and supervise it. Unexpectedly, in the autumn of last year, it was suspended from enrolling new students under the pretext of mismanagement and for the sake of rectification, causing poor children to look forward to hope in vain, and complaints can be seen on the front pages of newspapers. Its only hope is to be able to enroll new students again this year. Therefore, on the day after the enrollment advertisement was published in the newspaper, more than 800 letters requesting enrollment brochures were received. From this, it can be seen that the number of poor children who are out of school is large, and the desire to go to school is strong. Unfortunately, the enrollment advertisement was only published for two days before it was ordered to stop enrollment again in the name of rectification. It seems that this is not the original intention of the Ministry of Education to love labor education, and it is deeply alarming to all the students of this university. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Graduation Ceremonies at Various Schools <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Zhiren Yong Girls' School</p>
<p>The fourth graduation ceremony of Zhiren Yong Girls' School, located at No. 10 Seymour Road, was held at 5 p.m. on the 30th in the school's auditorium. Over 400 guests attended. Principal Xu Renyi delivered a report, stating that the school was founded four years ago, and its development has won the trust of the community. Many graduates have been admitted to Nanjing Ginling Women's College, Ginling University, and Shanghai Hujiang University. The school has now been registered with the Education Bureau and will establish a tutoring school during the summer vacation. During the summer, the library and laboratories for physics, chemistry, experimentation, and specimen instruments will be expanded. Although the achievements of the past few years have often been praised by society, they are still far from fulfilling even one-tenth of the school's plans. Next, high school graduate Mao Xiaoxiu delivered a speech in English, and Cao Ruying sang a song, captivating the audience. Following this, a speech in Chinese was given by Chen Shunying, a graduate of the Chinese language department. After this, Principal Xu delivered a speech, mainly encouraging students to have an independent spirit, so that they can talk about transforming society or coping with the environment. Her detailed and precise discussion of ancient and modern culture and modern thought was particularly exemplary for academic standards, providing students with a guiding needle as they leave the school. Finally, Principal Xu presented diplomas and dismissed the meeting. The school also held a graduation class art show the day before, performing famous plays and concerts in both Chinese and English, attracting many male and female guests.</p>

<p>Former champion Schmeling vs. Stribling</p>
<p>German Max Schmeling won the World Heavyweight Boxing Championship because American Jack Sharkey violated the rules. Time flies, and it has already been a year. Tonight at 10 p.m., German Schmeling will re-enter the boxing ring to make his first attempt to defend his controversial championship title, striving to deal with the Kiowa William Stribling. The two heroes will meet at the Cleveland Municipal Stadium in Ohio, USA, for a fifteen-round battle to compete for this year's championship.</p>
<h3 id="e83">New York Committee Changes Attitude <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Withdraws recognition; New York has no championship</p>
<p>Max Schmeling's victory and Jack Sharkey's violation of the rules were based on the opinion of the New York Athletic Commission. Later, Schmeling refused Sharkey's request for a rematch, so the New York Committee felt dissatisfied and resolutely withdrew Schmeling's championship. New York therefore has no official championship for this event. However, public opinion, as well as the world sports community and the American National Boxing Association, remain consistent in their recognition.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Schmeling's Skills Declining After Success <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Returns home in glory to enjoy happiness</p>
<p>Schmeling has fought five major battles in the past two years, four in 1929, consecutively defeating Josie Gara, Pietro Gori, Joe Nameth, and Paulino Uzcudun. After his final battle, his victory over Jack Sharkey, he held the championship, returned home in glory, and lived a peaceful and happy life. Within a year, he disappeared from the boxing ring, and his skills inevitably declined. Starting this year, he went on a performance tour of the United States to reorganize his forces.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Stribling Rises Up <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Highly acclaimed as a fierce general on the battlefield</p>
<p>Stribling is 27 years old, one year older than Schmeling, and they weigh the same, about 195 pounds each. In the past year, he defeated Phil Scott, frustrated Dave Griffith, and defeated Ansett Dicko, creating a fervent clamor. He has had 260 matches in his career, long known as a fierce general on the battlefield. He is the only good player in Kiowa, having defeated local hero Palip Makanira, so most people expect Stribling to have a good chance of winning within fifteen rounds. Given that Jack Sharkey almost overwhelmed Schmeling before his foul, Stribling may reenact this scene.</p>

<p>This competition will shake the world and is sure to be a success. The Cleveland Municipal Stadium is great and amazing, capable of accommodating 110,000 people. The future ticket revenue will be about $1.5 million. The total management on stage is by Dr. 　 Lipton. This was originally in New York's Madison Square Garden, but because the New York Committee withdrew its recognition of Schmeling's championship, it was moved here, so this great competition was able to avoid the risk of interruption.</p>

<p>London, 1st – Today's Wimbledon tennis tournament is another world for the United States. In the men's singles rematch results, both young American players won. Wood eliminated Whiteley, and Hills defeated Borotra. Therefore, the singles final is entirely American players.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Men's Singles Rematch Results <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>

<p>Wood's victory over Whiteley was entirely due to his cannonball serve, similar to Thiel's, and his high-ball crush of a thousand pounds. Once, Wood's serve crossed the net, and Whiteley's net racket even fell off, showing how heavy it was. It was exactly the same as Hills' victory over Austin yesterday. When Whiteley wanted to move forward to try his extreme angle shot, Wood returned a high ball, making a meaningful split, which Whiteley couldn't do anything about.</p>

<p>Hills also defeated French swordsman Borotra, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. In the first set, the two fought hard. In the next set, Bauer showed good signs, but in the end, Hills was unstoppable. Bauer only guarded, but still failed. Hills is only twenty years old, and winning against a veteran who has galloped on the battlefield, can it not be called a miracle?</p>

Then Cochet shook his iron arm and opened a bloody path, catching up to 3-4. In the second set, Sato's backhand and Kawa's wonderful over-the-head kill were praised by the viewers, who all hoped the Japanese would win again. However, the French caught up and instead led 3-2.

<p>Religious people say, the soul is immortal. Scientists say, matter is indestructible. And ordinary young men and women say, love is indestructible.</p>
<p>Three parts of wine are for prosperity, seven parts of wine are for moral decay.</p>
<p>Why did the ancients have to create the word "old," causing countless sages, heroes, beautiful women, and talented men in later generations to be ruined in this word "old." The vast sea, Jingwei can hardly fill, I hate it.</p>
<p>Navigating the sea of learning, there is no worry of sinking ships.</p>
<p>What the world values is not necessarily pleasing to my heart. What the world hates is not necessarily hateful to my eyes.</p>
<p>Sweeping away the watermelon peels and fruit shells on the ground, it is a great pleasure.</p>
<p>Fighting for internal strife, death is as light as a feather. Fighting for external regret, death is heavier than Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Chickens are hygienists, getting up early is creation. Crickets are elegant scholars, singing and enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>A magistrate is ashamed of receiving a salary when the people are fleeing. I wonder how many of today's public officials have such thoughts.</p>
<p>Mountains are far and passes are blocked, only dreams can pass. The earth is long and the sky is long, this love is endless.</p>
<p>The curtain ripples slightly, and the ice mat is sweet in dreams. I am ashamed as a hard worker, unable to experience it.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Talks of a Guest Returning from Western Hubei <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Old Farmer of Tian Yu</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Hezhang, my old friend. Last year he went to Western Hubei for business, and it has been a year now. He came to Shanghai yesterday and stayed at the Central Hostel. After hearing the news, I drove to visit him and asked about the situation there. Mr. Hu said that since the Red bandits sneaked into Xingshan, it is not far from Yichang. So the market is still peaceful. However, there is a female flying guard among the Red bandits, who is fierce and poisonous. It can be described.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Female Flying Guard: The female flying guard is He Ying, the younger sister of He Long, the leader of the Red bandits. She is only over twenty years old, slender, with a delicate face, and has infinite strength. She is skilled in shooting. Holding a gun, she rushes into battle, and every bullet hits the target. The bandits are amazed by her supernatural skills and are all in awe. Because of her beauty and marksmanship, the bandits call her the female flying guard. Flying Guard has an inherently sinister, fierce, and cruel nature, even more than He Long. She also trained a female army of a thousand people, equipped with guns, to assist her brother and trample on various places. The victims are countless.</p>
<p>The Strange Clothing of the Female Army: The female army trained by Flying Guard are all village women from various places in Hubei and Hunan who have been incited to follow. They are all under thirty years old, physically strong, and die in battle. No less than men. And their clothing is the most strange. The clothes are tight and narrow, the shorts reach the knees, bare feet with straw sandals, and red cloth is wrapped around the calves for easy walking. The clothes are black for easy hiding. A slit is cracked in the middle of the shorts for urination. The hair is combed on top of the head, like a wandering Taoist priest from Maoshan. The strange shapes are difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Releasing Sky Lanterns, Dissecting Abdomen and Gutting Intestines: The Red bandits must torture the rich among the villagers in various ways to force out their hidden gold. After that, they strip off their clothes and trousers, tie them naked to a tree, and soak their whole bodies with cotton wool soaked in kerosene, then set them on fire, calling it releasing sky lanterns. Or they use sharp knives to dissect their abdomen and gut their intestines, which is inhumane.</p>
<p>The National Army Encirclement and Suppression Sneaked into Xingshan: The Red bandits originally based in Shihe, Cili, and Feng Counties in Hubei, with strong strength. Since Mr. Xu Yuanquan served as the Qingxiang Superviser of the three provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan, they have attacked many times. He Long has repeatedly lost battles, and his strength has been greatly damaged. The official army's morale is high. The female flying guard discussed with her brother that in order to preserve her strength, she had to abandon the area and led the remnants of seven or eight thousand bandits overnight, crossing Badong Zigui, and sneaking into Xingshan. Because the mountains there are steep, they can resist. It is now heard that Mr. Xu will order an attack within days in order to thoroughly eliminate the bandit forces.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Guiding Tour of Mount Lu <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Tingkai</p>
<p>Looking horizontally, it is a ridge, looking sideways, it is a peak. Distant and near, high and low, each is different. Not knowing the true face of Mount Lu, it is only because you are in the midst of this mountain. I read this poem by Su Dongpo, the poet master of the Song Dynasty. Recalling a tour of Mount Lu in the summer of the eighteenth year, carefully tasting the taste, I can't help but long for the time of two years. Like the flowing water in the Yangtze River, it flows slowly. I don't know how much memory of other things has drifted away. But the thousands of cliffs and valleys of Mount Lu, and the sound of springs everywhere, can never drift away. Let me record my tour and use it as a record of a past event, or as a guide for the journey of gentlemen and ladies.</p>
<p>To go to Mount Lu from Shanghai, you can take a plane or a boat. First go to Jiujiang from Shanghai, and then transfer to the destination. But although the plane is fast, most people dare not try it. It takes three whole days to reach by boat. So those who are experienced in travel have come up with an expedient itinerary, which is to take the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing, and then take a boat to the destination from Xiaguan the next morning. In about forty hours, you can reach Jiujiang.</p>
<p>The center of Mount Lu is, of course, Guling. When you arrive in Jiujiang, change to a car (about 1.7-8 yuan per person). Amidst the constant sound of clear springs, you arrive at Lotus Cave on the mountainside. After getting off the car, walk or go up by shoulder chair. I took a shoulder chair. Step by step up the mountain. At first, it was very hot. Later, the higher you go, the cooler it becomes. Gradually, you don't feel the heat anymore. Looking at the Western-style houses of Guling, a corner of the red building is revealed from the depths of the green shade. Looking down at the scenery of the Yangtze River, it is really majestic and beautiful.</p>
<p>Guling is high above sea level. The scenery of the Yangtze River is really majestic and beautiful. It was originally a leased area operated by the British pastor Littell, so the equipment is extremely comprehensive. There are schools, hotels, hospitals, clubs, sports fields, swimming pools, etc. After our country took back the leased area, it did not diminish in color.</p>
<p>If you search all the scenic spots in the entire Mount Lu, it is really impossible to search them all. So you can only use Guling as a base for exploring nearby. But although I traveled happily for more than ten days, the places I missed were countless.</p>
<p>The impression that I will never forget is the moonlit night tour of Bailu Cave. That day, I first went to Hanpokou to see the clouds. Suddenly the peak was covered and disappeared. Suddenly it opened up again, and the weather was unpredictable. After watching the clouds, I immediately went down the mountain. When I arrived at the foot of the mountain, I followed the huge spring and passed Qixian Temple (Cihang Temple) to Bailu Cave. What touched my eyes was a wooden archway with the words "Happy Land of Famous Teachings." Passing Liufang Bridge and entering the gate of Bailu Academy, I suddenly heard the sound of reading aloud, and I felt that the legacy of Huiweng in the past is still there today. There is a couplet next to the courtyard that says, "Deer and pigs play together, a place to forget things. Springs and peaks reflect each other, wisdom and benevolence are uniquely obtained." After returning from Bailu Cave, I went back to Cihang Temple to spend the night. The feeling this night is much happier than a newly married couple. Late at night, a gust of clear wind made a sound, and the temple bell kept ringing. I turned to think about the floating clouds and human affairs, and I couldn't help but want to be a long-time companion with the ancient Buddha and Qingdeng.</p>
<p>The temples and Taoist temples in Mount Lu include Tianchi Temple, Donglin Temple, Xilin Temple, Zhanyun Temple, Qixian Temple, Xiufeng Temple, and Cihang Temple. The famous mountain peaks include Wulao Peak, Xianglu Peak, Shuangjian Peak, Lianhua Peak, Plow Peak, and Hanyang Peak. Famous places include Buddha Hand Rock, Yubei Pavilion, Bailu Cave, Huanglongtan, and Sanxia Ravine.</p>
<p>The Pine Forest is a scenic spot in Guling. It stretches for a very long time and is especially quiet. We walk among them, feeling that the mountains are green, the pines are also green, and people in the jungle seem to be reflected in green clothes and green faces. Especially the couples, walking in pairs under the forest, making people think that they only envy mandarin ducks and not immortals.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the gentlemen and ladies who travel to Mount Lu will also find it valuable to stay in Xunyang when they go out of Xunyang. Looking at Mount Lu from the shores of Gantang Lake in Xunyang, the true face cannot be distinguished. This scene and this feeling are also thought-provoking.</p>

<p>— Bin Hong</p>
<p>Wandering thoughts are like willow catkins. Turning around a hundred times, it is already a mistake in this life. Peeking at people under the curtain, caught by the wind. Where will the thousands of tendernesses go? Illness and poetry become obstacles. Small pavilion and sparse lattice, loving the moon deeply. Suddenly recalling that the waves can understand language, the hair is low and surrounded by countless mountains.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Inscription for the Play "Liu Rushi" by the Master of Small Liu Fragrance <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Song Tuo</p>
<p>Who can compare with Jing in the elegance of the old generation? It is pitiful to die a difficult death. Tender feelings are more important than group grace. Willing to fail the Qing even if it is changed to Jiangshan.</p>
<p>The shadows of Qinhuai are still in the world. Broadcast into new voices and win smiles. The joys and sorrows of Sangyu are different. Fanshan is ultimately better than Yushan.</p>

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Now this kind of movement is all started by Indians. If the Chinese people can advance with it, then the matter of Asian liaison is very easy. Even Japan has no difficulty in urging it to wake up, slightly slowing down its ambition to be small and easy to fill, and jointly seeking the progress of Asian civilization. The people of the three islands do not worry about not having food to eat. This point is especially worth noting. If the Chinese can unite with the Indians to unite Japan in the east and the Hui in the west in order to restore the true civilization of Asia, abandon narrow nationalism, and realize Sun Yat-sen's Datongism, it may not be impossible to implement it in Asia first. Although Japan does not seem to be a big obstacle, it is also in the movement. As for the British Confucian Wells, he once advocated that China and the United States should unite first, and then merge with Europe, because Europe is prone to chaos and there is no hope for peace. Therefore, it is hoped that China and the United States in the Pacific Ocean will be the pioneers of world Datong. It can also be seen that Eastern culture has a tendency to become the center of the 20th century. Truth will win the final victory. China should encourage itself.</p>
<p>Two children, only thirteen or four years old, do not understand English very well. They came to my room. Eagerly asking for their intention, they are willing to follow me to China. I asked that their parents and brothers are all in India, why do they want to go to China. They answered that I am very willing to travel to China. I love China too. I took out a statue of Guanyin and showed it to them, saying, this is the goddess of China and Japan. Every household enshrines it. You should know that this Bodhisattva is very powerful. They do not understand very much. I said, you look closely and know that the appearance of this goddess is no different from the decoration of your mother and sisters. They agreed. I said, this can know the relationship between Indian and East Asian culture. More than a thousand years ago, I translated your classics and imitated your goddess, occupying the entire power in East Asia. It is still popular today. Your India is like a big tree, and the flowers are all over Asia. In the future, you will be welcomed when you come to the East. But you are still young now, and you cannot even speak English. It can be when you grow up. They left with mixed feelings of grief and joy. Do not neglect this small matter. It can prove that young children have such admiration for China, which is the best phenomenon. This is because their philosophers heard that Chinese celebrities had arrived and wanted to cry. Young children heard that China was traveling like this, and they could predict the future relationship.</p>
<p>A student named Sami Nanda lives in Conak County, very close to Kushinagar. Kushinagar is the place where the Buddha entered Nirvana, that is, the place where the Nirvana Sutra was said. He is willing to guide me to his home to see the place where the Buddha entered Nirvana. It is not far from Varanasi, and it is said that there is a great hope that Chinese Buddhism schools will be established there. If they can be established, many small kings in India are also happy to donate money, because the Westerners who run Christianity also donate money. Buddha is the Buddha of India. Indians are naturally happy to support Buddhism. However, Indians themselves have not yet been able to promote it. They hope that the Chinese will promote it and the Indians will help it. According to me, the small European country of Sweden has even sent people to Shanxi in northern China to collect snake species. I used to live with them. They collected various snakes and returned to the small countries of Sweden and Denmark, and the missionaries spread all over the earth. It is because they are promoting their civilization as the crown. Now that China is so big, I do not know what work the millions of Buddhists are doing, and they do not even repay the kindness of the Indian Buddhist land. Is it not pitiful? May the Buddhists encourage themselves.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>After a while, there was no sound on the floor above, and Ziliang thought she was done dancing. After being disturbed by her, now that she was finished, I could get to work. But before long, the sound rose again:</p>
<p>"Drizzling rain, falling non-stop..."</p>
<p>She raised her loud throat and began to sing loudly. How could Ziliang concentrate on his work? He had no choice but to put down his pen and wait for the storm to subside.</p>
<p>"I don't want your gold, I don't want your silver, I only want your heart, ah ya ya! Your heart..."</p>
<p>Ziliang's heart was truly being taken away by her. He couldn't bear it any longer and walked to the top of the stairs:</p>
<p>"What's all the racket? Singing this kind of song, how old are you this year?"</p>
<p>"This old woman is seventy-two years old, haha!"</p>
<p>"Acting like a little kid, why don't you go downstairs!"</p>
<p>Having said that, he returned to his small room. The madam had indeed left. As she was going down the stairs, she stuck her head into the small room:</p>
<p>"Schoolteachers don't deserve to appreciate art,"</p>
<p>A burst of wild laughter and footsteps went down the stairs together. He heard her go to the kitchen, probably to prepare the dishes. Ziliang regrouped and picked up his pen again to correct his students' compositions.</p>
<p>After reading about half of one, the madam's mumbling could be heard on the stairs:</p>
<p>"Women depend on men for their livelihood, so I, Yueru, can't be without my husband Pan Ziliang for a moment!"</p>
<p>As soon as she finished speaking, she had already stepped into the small room. Ziliang saw that she was holding a steelyard in her right hand, with a wine cup in the balance pan. A look of embarrassment appeared on her face:</p>
<p>"Can you help me calculate! According to my cookbook, I should use two liang of soy sauce; but this is a newly made steelyard, and the weight is different from before. I'm afraid it will be too much!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>
<p>"If the amount of soy sauce is not calculated according to the cookbook, and the dish doesn't taste good, I can't be responsible."</p>
<p>Ziliang knew that if he didn't calculate it for her, firstly, she wouldn't go downstairs, and secondly, today's dish would be ruined. So, he used his pen to calculate on the paper:</p>
<p>"Use one liang, six qian, eight fen, seven li and a half!"</p>
<p>Ziliang deliberately did not round the decimals, otherwise she might ask questions repeatedly. At this moment, as soon as she heard "one liang, six qian, eight fen, seven li and a half," without even asking how to weigh it, she frowned, holding the steelyard in her right hand and a cup of soy sauce in her left, and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Petitions from Various Sectors: At the afternoon meeting, after completing the original agenda item 25, the Shanghai Committee Against US Sailor Atrocities and 45 other labor unions dispatched representatives carrying petitions and proposed proposals to the conference. With the permission of the presidium and the conference, they were allowed to attend and report. Representatives Zhu Ping'an, Li Yongxiang, and others successively made brief reports, as follows: Li Yongxiang, the labor representative, reported, in brief, that since the National Conference resolved on the revision of the Trade Union Law, the promulgation of the Special Trade Union Law, and the provisions for the organization of national and provincial and municipal trade unions, as well as the facilities for worker education and the relief of unemployed workers, all have been submitted to the National Government for reference and handling, but the National Government has not yet implemented them. At the opening of this conference, it is hoped that the conference will respect Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, consult the National Government, swiftly follow the resolutions of the National Conference, and strive to implement them, so that the national labor movement can be prepared. Zhu Ping'an, the representative of the Shanghai Committee Against US Sailor Atrocities, reported on the tragic cases of Gu Jingen and others, hoping that the conference would sympathize and assist, and adopt standard methods to lead the committee's progress to achieve its goals. After the petitioners finished reporting, the conference decided to change the agenda and first discuss: (1) The Shanghai Committee Against US Sailor Atrocities petitioned against the atrocities of US sailors against compatriots. At the same time, Yu Zhongbiao and other representatives from the seven districts temporarily proposed to request the Central Government to consult the National Government and order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate with the US sailors stationed in Shanghai regarding the cases of the massacre of Gu Jingen, Dai Tingzuo, etc., in order to protect national rights and protect the lives of the people. (The above two cases were discussed together.) Resolution: Passed, and the next executive committee will lead the people to actively work on the anti-imperialist movement. (2) The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and others petitioned, requesting to forward to the Central Government to consult the National Government, swiftly comply with the resolutions of the National Conference on the labor movement, thoroughly revise the Trade Union Law and the Factory Law, and add articles on the organization of national, provincial, and municipal trade unions in the Trade Union Law, promulgate the Special Trade Union Law, and earnestly implement labor education to relieve unemployed workers. Should it be appropriate, we respectfully await your public decision. Resolution: Consolidated with Case 6. After the discussion of this case was completed, the conference resumed its original agenda and continued to discuss the 26th proposal.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks: After the temporary motions were completed, Chairman Wu Kaixian delivered the closing remarks of the conference, saying in brief: Representatives, comrades, the Seventh Representative Conference has come to a close. Pleasant gatherings are not frequent, which increases melancholy. Recalling the conference period, we were instructed by the central representatives with earnest guidance, and pointed out the points to be worked on in the future. The representatives respectfully received the guidance with utmost sincerity, followed the instructions, and expressed their gratitude. The tasks of the Representative Conference can be briefly summarized in three points: (1) Review the work of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the government in the past year. (2) Elect candidates for the next Municipal Executive and Supervisory Committee members. (3) Determine the direction of future work, and discuss proposals. Regarding the first point, reviewing the work is indeed important. Our party advocates governing the country by the party, and all administrative implementations of the government should be in accordance with the party's will and主張. Officials, in particular, cannot deviate from the party's position and act recklessly. The municipal government and its bureaus, in their daily affairs, accept the party's doctrine and the supervision of the party headquarters. Now, they solemnly present reports to seek the understanding of all representatives of the city, which shows that the harmony between the party and the government is gratifying. The representatives have made resolutions on the reports they submitted with all their efforts, indicating the direction of administrative work in the future. As for reviewing the work of the party headquarters itself, it is even more important. If the party headquarters itself is not sound, it will be difficult to promote party rule and lead the people. The previous report and supervisory committee was elected by the Sixth Municipal Representative Conference and entrusted by the comrades of the city to plan and carry out the party affairs of the city. Over the past year, have all the measures been able to meet the expectations of the comrades of the city? This is what all the comrades of the city are concerned about. The representatives have come on behalf of the comrades of the city and should strictly review the work of the previous Executive and Supervisory Committee as the basis for reform in the next term. Therefore, the first task is indeed the key to the past and future of the city's party and government. The second point, election, is an annual event, as stipulated by the general charter. However, in recent years, new and old warlords have repeatedly rebelled, and the comrades in the rear are responsible for their duties, which depends on the loyal and sound comrades to take on the responsibilities. Otherwise, the consequences will still be unimaginable. Moreover, Shanghai is the base of imperialism and the concentration of all corrupt forces. If it is not a loyal and unyielding comrade who fights to the death with the environment, he will only be a prisoner of the environment. Now, the representatives use their twelve points of sight and brainpower to solemnly elect the candidates for the next responsible comrades from among the talented people, so that the entrustment has someone to bear. This is indeed half of the success. However, we should not take the election as the goal. Whether the people who are elected in the future can meet our expectations and not fail the trust of the comrades of the city still requires the comrades of the city to supervise them at any time, so that they can achieve full success. The third point, discussing proposals and determining the direction of future work, is also very important. What we see and hear every day is mostly dissatisfaction with the environment and a desire to reform it. However, limited by the distance between each other, we cannot gather ideas and benefit each other. Although the municipal executive committee and the district party headquarters and district branches have repeatedly made suggestions that can benefit the party and the country, they are indeed not as vivid and thorough as today's conference. This is enough to celebrate the conference. Now, each resolution will be executed separately as soon as it is sorted out. As for determining the direction of future work, it is the most important task of the conference. As the ancients said, "Nothing is said without preparation." Since we have solemnly elected the Executive and Supervisory Committee members, we should entrust them with the responsibility of promoting party affairs. As for how to promote party affairs, it depends on the planning of the representatives. Moreover, the conference is the highest authority in the city. Where the responsibility lies, we should, while reviewing the past, set the direction for the promotion of party affairs in the future, so that the next Executive and Supervisory Committee members can advance step by step and follow their own path. The long-term development of Shanghai's party affairs can be predicted.</p>
<p>Conference Slogans: (1) Loyal comrades unite! (2) Consolidate the foundation of our party! (3) Support our party's regime! (4) Strive for political tutelage and construction! (5) Maintain peace and unity! (6) Eliminate communist bandits! (7) Eliminate all reactionary forces! (8) Down with imperialism! (9) Long live the Kuomintang! (10) Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Conference Declaration: On July 1, 1931, the Seventh Representative Conference of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality was held in Shanghai, and after two days of deliberation, it declared its closing. During this conference, all representatives of the conference discussed the proposals and elected the committee members with a clear mind and a fair attitude. Now, we summarize the various reports and resolutions, present the main points, and state three things as the goal for the comrades and compatriots of the city to strive for in the future. We are willing to encourage each other. (1) Our party is a political group of revolutionary people based on the Three Principles of the People. In order to realize the Three Principles of the People as soon as possible and to give the revolutionary people a place to entrust themselves, the organization of our party should strive for strictness and expansion. All revolutionary people who firmly believe in the Three Principles of the People should have ample opportunity to participate in our party, and the party headquarters at all levels should do their best to absorb outstanding members from all walks of life, so that they can be led by our party to devote themselves to the revolution. In the past, our party paid great attention to this point, but people from all walks of life seemed to lack understanding of our party. The lower-level party headquarters also seemed to lack effort in recruiting party members. Therefore, there are many revolutionary people in the private sector, but our party is sighing that it is difficult to find talents, and the progress of political tutelage and construction work is also inevitably slow. Taking Shanghai as an example, Shanghai is located in a key area, and revolutionary work is complex and requires the efforts of our party. Among the three million citizens, there are also many revolutionary people who firmly believe in the Three Principles of the People. If our party can make the greatest efforts to absorb them as party members, the revolutionary force will not be as weak as it is today, and the revolutionary work will not be as lax as it is today. Therefore, the conference believes that the comrades of our party should accelerate the pace of going deep into the private sector in the future, absorb outstanding members from all walks of life, and compatriots from all walks of life should also understand our party's position and firmly believe in our party's doctrine, such as joining our party and fighting together. It is hoped that everyone will work together and work with one heart, and the political tutelage work will not be difficult to complete, and the Three Principles of the People will not be difficult to realize. (2) The realization of the Three Principles of the People depends heavily on political tutelage work. Dr. Sun Yat-sen believed that "Chinese people have been ruled by thousands of years of autocracy and have been conquered and subjugated. Once restored, without a period of political tutelage, most people have been bound for a long time. Even if they are suddenly liberated, they do not initially understand how to act. They either stick to their old habits of abandoning responsibility, or are used by others and fall into counter-revolution without realizing it." Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated that the procedure for national construction should go from the military administration period to the political tutelage period and then to the constitutionalism period. During the political tutelage period, the government should send trained and tested personnel to assist the people in preparing for autonomy in various places. Preparing for autonomy is an important task during the political tutelage period. According to the central government's policies, the city's autonomy should have started to prepare early, and the district chiefs should have been selected and appointed from the trained personnel in the city. The local autonomy of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has already started to prepare and has gradually achieved results. The conference hopes that the municipal government will quickly appoint district chiefs from the trained personnel and establish neighborhood offices within one year in accordance with Article 51 of the Municipal Organization Law, and implement the popular election of district chiefs within one year and six months. It is also hoped that the comrades of our party will follow the resolution of the Central Third Plenary Session on the political tutelage period's party affairs work plan, pay attention to the organization, publicity, and training of local autonomy, and the future of people's governance will be promising. (3) Concessions are the main base for imperialists to invade China, and they are also the source of filth and dirt in the country. They not only harm China's sovereignty, but also hinder China's development. Every Chinese citizen who breathes and lives in China wishes to recover them as soon as possible. However, in recent years, the country has been in trouble, and negotiations have been unsuccessful, resulting in empty wishes to recover them and few practical results. The imperialists have taken advantage of the situation and launched a counterattack, making a big fuss, believing that concessions cannot be easily abandoned. Recently, the Shanghai Public Concession Board hired Englishman Fei Tang from afar to study the concession issue, vainly trying to find a theoretical basis for the concession. Fei Tang's report, Volume II, even advocated that the recovery of the concession should not be within a few years, but within a few decades. When the time comes for recovery, the Chinese government should allow Chinese and foreign citizens to govern themselves and independently operate various government affairs. The Chinese government should absolutely not interfere. This kind of disguised concession system is no different from separating from the Republic of China and becoming independent. Fei Tang declared that it should continue forever. After Fei Tang's report was published, the foreigners in Shanghai told each other with color, believing that the concession system was not only required by facts, but also recognized by theory. London newspapers rushed to publish it, praising it greatly, and the concession system seemed to have gained a strong guarantee in the eyes of foreigners. Looking back at Chinese compatriots, they all seem to be indifferent. General merchants, scholars, and celebrities even take it as an honor to be appointed to the positions of the Public Concession Board, and even do not hesitate to be servile and admit that the measures they opposed to the Public Concession Board in the past were due to their position. Is it not shameful? Now, the Chinese government wants to recover the educational rights of the concession, but these people shamelessly serve on the Education Committee of the Public Concession Board, speaking for foreigners. The people of Shanghai are planning to resist the Public Concession Board with a policy of non-cooperation, but these people shamelessly take up idle positions and say yes to everything, acting as spokesmen for foreigners. "The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart, and physical death comes next." The national spirit has fallen to this point, which is very regrettable. For the sake of restoring China's sovereignty and for the sake of maintaining the dignity of compatriots, the conference hopes that the government and the people will have a fearless spirit and quickly prepare for the recovery of the concession, and use various methods of non-cooperation to strangle the imperialists to death. The conference believes that the above three matters are of great importance, so it is specially issued as a declaration, which is suspended as the goal. May our comrades and compatriots encourage each other. The Seventh Representative Conference of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality hereby declares.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Customs Ships Detained by the Navy Were Released Yesterday <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan Has Taken a Merchant Ship to Ningbo</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Ministry of the Navy ordered the Datong warship stationed in Shanghai port to detain the Jianghai Customs patrol boats. On the 30th, the warship seized four boats in the Huangpu River: Liuxing, Jinghui, Jingguang, and Jinghai. The details were published in yesterday's newspaper. However, yesterday, the First Fleet Command of the Navy stationed in Shanghai received a telegram from the Ministry of the Navy ordering the Datong warship to release the customs ships. Thereupon, the Jinghui, Jingguang, and Jinghai, the three small patrol boats anchored at the third buoy of the Huangpu River in front of the Jiangnan Shipyard, were released first at 11 AM. The Liuxing patrol boat was released at 2:20 PM. According to the First Fleet Command, the headquarters only received the telegram from the Ministry of the Navy ordering the Datong warship to release the ships. The telegram was brief and did not mention the reason. Later, reporters learned from other sources that the customs' detention of naval materials and the navy's takeover of surveying were indeed two reasons, but there were still monetary issues regarding the measurement aspect. It was said that after the abolition of the customs within 50 li, certain payments could not be allocated as before. Whether or not this is true remains to be verified. Naval Vice Admiral Chen Shaokuan took a Xinning-Shaoxing merchant ship to Ningbo at 5 PM the day before yesterday. After arriving in Ningbo, he took the Yixian warship waiting in Ningbo to Xiangshan to inspect the naval school and the torpedo source attack fleet that was in the middle of maneuvers. After the matter is completed, he will return directly to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that the Ministry of the Navy secretly telegraphed the Datong warship to detain the Jianghai Customs patrol boats the day before yesterday. Afterwards, Finance Minister Song Ziwen immediately telegraphed the Ministry of the Navy to inquire about everything. The Ministry of the Navy telegraphed the First Fleet Command stationed in Shanghai yesterday morning to release the four ships, Liuxing, etc. The Datong warship then handled the release of the four ships directly at 2 PM yesterday. Yesterday morning, Customs Superintendent Zhang Fuyun also visited Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the Ministry of Finance's office in Shanghai to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Incident of Customs Vessels Being Detained <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>A Conversation with Secretary Ding of the Inspectorate General of Customs</p>
<p>Regarding the detention of the Jianghai Customs cruiser "Liuxing" and three smaller vessels, "Jinghai," "Jinghui," and "Jingguang," by the Navy Department's warship "Datong" at Gaochang Temple a few days ago, a reporter, recognizing the significance of this matter and the lack of detailed information, visited the Inspectorate General of Customs to investigate the truth. Mr. Ding Guitang, the Chinese Secretary of the Inspectorate, provided a general overview. According to Mr. Ding, the Inspectorate General of Customs had no prior knowledge of the naval vessel detaining customs cruisers. They had not received any orders from the Ministry of Finance, nor had they received any notification from the naval authorities. After the incident, the Customs Service specifically sent a patrol engineer to visit Chen Jiliang, the commander of the First Fleet. Chen stated that the "Datong" warship's actions were carried out under the orders of the Navy Department, but the true details were still unknown. The patrol engineer thus returned without obtaining any useful information. Now, according to the conversation between a reporter from the Guowen News Agency and Vice Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, as reported in your newspaper, it is now known that the Navy Department's reasons for detaining the customs cruisers are none other than two: that the customs cruisers have infringed upon the hydrographic surveying rights and that the Navy Department's materials have been detained by Customs. However, according to what Vice Minister Chen said, this is vastly different from the facts. The Customs Service feels compelled to defend itself. It is the case that the Chinese Navy had no Hydrographic Bureau in the past, and surveys of ports along the coast were conducted by Customs to facilitate navigation. For decades, Chinese and foreign merchants have relied on this. After the establishment of the Hydrographic Bureau, key personnel in important positions were also provided by Customs. To this day, the hydrographic work of the Navy and Customs proceeds without conflict. Although, according to international practice, coastal surveying should naturally be handled by the naval authorities for the sake of national defense, the Customs Service</p>

<p>has absolutely no intention of monopolizing this authority. However, the Chinese Customs has been acting in this capacity for quite some time. If the government intends to change this to be handled by the naval authorities, the Executive Yuan should order the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Customs Service to comply. Until an explicit order of transfer from the Ministry of Finance is received, the original authority of the Customs Service will naturally continue to be exercised, and there is absolutely no room for shirking or abandoning this duty. Moreover, the Customs Service is subordinate to the Ministry of Finance and is one of the administrative organs of the Chinese government. It is not a foreign organization, nor can it be considered a non-Chinese organization simply because Customs employs foreigners. The current remarks by the Vice Minister of the Navy, which clearly consider the Customs Service to be a foreign organization, are truly shocking and deeply regrettable. Furthermore, the Hydrographic Bureau also employs foreigners such as Mr. Millers. Does that mean the bureau has therefore fallen into the hands of foreigners? In addition, the "Liuxing" is a cruiser, not used for surveying. The "Liuxing"'s duties are to patrol and repair lighthouses along the coast, yet it has been detained innocently. And the three small Jianghai Customs vessels are used for anti-smuggling, yet they have also been detained. What purpose does this serve? It is truly perplexing. As for the allegation that Customs detained Navy materials, according to Customs regulations, duty-free goods can only be released with an order from the Ministry of Finance. Without a duty-free permit, Customs cannot release materials for any organization on its own, including the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief. The Ministry of Finance has issued repeated orders on this matter, and Customs is not intentionally making things difficult for any organization. If the Navy Department is transporting materials with a permit, Customs will release them promptly without any obstruction. Because Customs is a structured and disciplined administrative organ, it is absolutely not permissible to act outside of regulations. Moreover, the "Liuxing" cruiser was detained just as it was sailing to Wusong to repair lighthouses, before it had even set out. If the lighthouses are not repaired in the future, navigation will be obstructed, or dangers may arise. Who will bear the responsibility? As for the "Jinghai," "Jinghui," and "Jingguang," they are the only three patrol vessels in the port of Shanghai. With their sudden detention, given the prevalence of smuggling in Shanghai, each day of detention means one less day of anti-smuggling efforts. Customs revenue will also be significantly affected. These are all the harms caused by the suspension of anti-smuggling efforts. In summary, Customs is a part of the Ministry of Finance, and customs vessels are public property of the Ministry of Finance. Both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Navy are national administrative organs, each with its own administrative system. Even if the Ministry of the Navy is dissatisfied with Customs, or if customs cruisers have offended the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of the Navy can negotiate with the Ministry of Finance, which can then instruct the Inspectorate General of Customs to comply. If not, they should at least consult with the Inspectorate General of Customs beforehand. Instead, without any such communication, they suddenly dispatched troops to detain customs vessels with a single departmental order. This is a truly unexpected action, lacking satisfactory justification in terms of both public reason and law.</p>

<p>Madam Guo Jingluan, wife of Cai Gongshi, telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday, stating, "To Chairman Chiang of the Nanchang General Headquarters: Respectfully submitted. On June 24th, Jingluan exhumed multiple remains of my late husband, Cai Gongshi, and other martyrs in the southwest corner of the garden behind the Jiaonan Negotiation Bureau.

<p>General Lu Xiqing passed away half a year ago. Due to the National Government's failure to finalize the details of the public funeral ceremony and the allocation of funeral expenses, the burial has been delayed until now. Because the weather is entering the hot season, the funeral arrangements committee held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided to hold the funeral service at the Hunan Guildhall on Xieqiao in Shanghai today (the 3rd) at noon, with an extremely simple ceremony. Once the details of the public funeral and the funeral expenses are finalized, the remains will be moved to Purple Mountain in Nanjing for burial.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government to Handle Negotiations</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Has Not Responded Yet</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng's Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the Western police officer shooting the Chinese police officer on Haig Road, after the Municipal Government lodged a serious protest and reserved the right to demand justice, the Municipal Council has not provided a satisfactory response. Our reporter interviewed Chen Xizeng, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, yesterday. According to Chen, this case is now entirely handled by the Municipal Government, and all evidence has been transferred. The wounded police officer, Kong Qingfeng, is still receiving treatment in the hospital, and it is still unknown whether his right arm can be saved from permanent disability. This matter concerns our national sovereignty, and all sectors should support the Municipal Government until the four objectives of punishing the perpetrator, compensation, consolation, and guarantee are achieved. Chen also stated that the incident occurred at 1:20 PM on June 24th. Upon receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched the Security Team to investigate and disarmed the Western police officer and the plainclothes Chinese detectives who were with him, and took them to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District. At 3:30 PM, Martin, the Chief Inspector of the Municipal Council, visited him at the bureau. He orally presented four demands, which Martin indicated were acceptable. Around 7:00 PM, the Western police officer and others were released. Now that there are witnesses, there is absolutely no room for denial or cover-up to evade responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Opposition to the Succession of the Opium Prohibition Bureau <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams and Letters from All Over the Country</p>
<p>Since the Central Opium Prohibition Committee adopted the method of "prohibition through taxation," the news has spread, and party branches, anti-drug organizations, and civil society groups from all over the country have protested, sending telegrams and letters. The secretariat of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has been receiving reports of opposition from all over the country in the past few days, like snowflakes flying. The statistics section of the association compiled the names of various opposing groups yesterday and continues to disclose them to show a glimpse of public opinion. (1) Party branches that continue to express opposition include the Tianjin Municipal Party Branch, the Yinxian County Party Branch, the Fuyang County Party Branch, the Changxing County Party Branch, the Yuqian County Party Branch, the Zhuji County Party Branch, the Jiande County Party Branch, the Yuyao County Party Branch, the Anji County Party Branch, the Fengxian County Party Branch, the Haiyan County Party Branch, the Xiaoshan County Party Branch, the Chongde County Party Branch, the Hangxian County Party Branch, the Zhenjiang District Party Branches, the Shanghai District Party Branches, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Branch, and the Zhejiang Provincial Party Branch. All the above party branches unanimously advocated that opium prohibition should be based on the Premier's anti-drug legacy, which should not be violated under any circumstances. (2) Civil society groups that have expressed their opposition include the All-China Lawyers Association, the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Zhejiang Journalists Association, the Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, the Hangzhou Journalists Association, the Zhenjiang Christian Association, the Guide Christian Association, and the Wujin County Congress. These groups unanimously opposed the policy of "prohibition through taxation," considering it a self-defeating measure and requesting the Central Government to rectify it according to law to appease public opinion. (3) Local Shanghai groups that have expressed opposition, in addition to 123 labor unions such as the Postal Workers' Union, include the Chinese Medical Association, the Shanghai Physicians' Association, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai YWCA, the Fujian Native Place Association in Shanghai, the Huining Native Place Association, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, the Fujian Students Association in Shanghai, the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association, the Shanghai Lizhi Society, the Shanghai Confucian Society, the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, the China Four Prohibitions Association, and the Shanghai All-Zhejiang Public Association. These groups all advocated that opium prohibition should adopt a policy of complete prohibition. The establishment of the Opium Prohibition Bureau is contrary to party principles and treaties, and it is a stain on the party and the country. They requested the Central Government to rectify it as soon as possible. It is reported that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also resolved to oppose it yesterday. (4) Anti-drug groups from all over the country, including the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association, the Hebei Provincial Anti-Drug Association, the Fuzhou National Anti-Drug Association, the Liaoning Anti-Drug Federation, the Xiamen National Anti-Drug Association, the Suzhou National Anti-Drug Association, the Taiwan Overseas Chinese Federation, the Fujian Detoxification Society, the Licheng Anti-Drug Propaganda Association, the Fengxian Anti-Drug Propaganda Association, the Yinxian Anti-Drug Propaganda Association, the Shaoxing All-Sectors Anti-Drug Movement Conference, the Yuyao All-Sectors Anti-Drug Movement Conference, the Ningbo All-Sectors Anti-Drug Movement Conference, and the Cixi All-Sectors Anti-Drug Movement Conference, all unanimously recognized that the establishment of the Opium Prohibition Bureau will render the decades of opium prohibition efforts useless. The Central Government should, based on public opinion, thoroughly prohibit it and punish those who advocate opening up opium prohibition and presiding over taxation. Their petitions are filled with tears and are truly moving. It is reported that the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association plans to collect the public opinion of hundreds of organizations and millions of people mentioned above and submit it to the Central Government for adoption.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Record of the Preparatory Meeting of the Sichuan Railway Shareholders' Association in Shanghai <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Erosion of Shareholders' Funds</p>
<p>Advocating for the Railway Ministry to Repay Debts</p>
<p>Sichuan Railway Company (formerly the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company) shareholders in Shanghai, due to the urgent need to resolve the issue of Sichuan Railway shareholder funds, and the company's lack of a formal responsible person, initiated a Sichuan Railway Shareholders' Association in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, Lu Bin was temporarily elected as chairman, and Tao Daihua was the secretary. Eighty-four people publicly elected Lu Bin as the temporary chairman and Tao Daihua as the recorder, and resolved the following key issues: (1) Regarding the attitude to be taken towards Chen Zhefu and Liu Yajue, the ineffective directors of the company, and Zeng Xianzhi, who claimed to be a representative of the board of directors, etc., who, with the qualification of two or three people, arbitrarily appointed Ni Gongwei, Zou Yunchun, Feng Lizhou, etc., as many as three general managers, it was resolved that, according to the company's articles of association and company regulations, all ineffective directors and pseudo-general managers are fundamentally denied. The association will send a letter to all shareholders in Sichuan, setting a time limit to convene a shareholders' meeting to fundamentally reorganize the company. (2) Zou Yunchun and other few people formed the preparatory committee of the Sichuan Railway Shareholders' Group in Shanghai. After four months of preparation, it has not been formally established. Recently, due to Xie Chi's relationship, they have openly accepted bribes from remnants of the Western Hills faction warlords and colluded with ineffective directors Liu Yajue and Chen Zhefu to recover the principal and interest of more than 2 million taels of borrowed funds from the Bank of Communications, to be used for buying guns and forming an army. They have now entrusted accountant Jiang Wanping to represent them. What should the association do to deal with this? It was resolved that, without the opening of a formal shareholders' meeting, no one is allowed to take this loan. The methods are as follows: (A) Telegraph to all parties, denouncing their conspiracy and crimes; (B) Petition the National Government to punish the culprits; (C) Send a letter to the Bank of Communications to stop the payment; (D) Support the reply letter from Zhong Hangsu, Wang Aoxi, Wu Zheng, etc., the standing committee members of the Shanghai Native Place Association, and Qiu Bencen, the representative of the former director Qiu He, requesting the authorities to order Xie Chi to hand over the bonds borrowed from the Bank of Communications to a reliable bank for safekeeping. (3) Regarding the 17 million yuan owed to the company by the Ministry of Railways, the time limit has expired and it has not yet been returned. What should be advocated? It was resolved to accelerate the convening of a formal shareholders' meeting to resolve the issue. Other cases were omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Advance Notice of the Cooperative Movement Lecture and Commemorative Meeting <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Date... This Month's 4th</p>
<p>Address... Sichuan Road YMCA</p>
<p>July 4th this year is International Cooperative Day. As usual, people engaged in the cooperative movement in various countries carry out extensive publicity on International Cooperative Day and hold various grand events to celebrate. Last year, our country, due to a central government circular, held a cooperative movement publicity week for seven days throughout the country, which aroused the attention of people in society at that time. One year later, the domestic cooperative cause has gradually made progress. Last October, the Chinese Cooperative Society held its second annual meeting in Hangzhou and resolved to petition the central government to stipulate the annual Cooperative Day as a Cooperative Movement Publicity Day for continuous publicity, hoping for the development and prevalence of this cause. This year, Tong Yumin of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines made the same request. Recently, the central government has issued a circular to all levels of party branches and governments, stipulating that this day is Chinese Cooperative Movement Publicity Day. The date of International Cooperative Day is the first Saturday of July each year, which happens to be July 4th this year. The Chinese Cooperative Society, in conjunction with the Shanghai YMCA, will hold a cooperative lecture meeting at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. The time is from 3:00 PM. Mr. Wang Wuying, director of the society's publicity department and professor at the Central Political School, will speak on "The Cooperative Movement in China during the Period of Political Tutelage," and Mr. Li An, deputy director of the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, will speak on "Examples of Production Cooperation." The society will also distribute various cooperative publications, including the "Cooperative Monthly" and "Cooperative Legislation Special Issue," which were recently published and contain the essential principles of the cooperation laws promulgated by advanced countries in the world. They are truly valuable references for the drafting of our country's cooperation law. People from all walks of life are welcome to attend the lecture. Also, the society's executive committee resolved to convene a gathering of Shanghai members on this day (July 4th) to celebrate. The time is 6:00 PM, and the location is the New World Hotel on Nanjing Road, where the society held its founding meeting in 1928. The double commemoration is sure to be a grand event.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Commemorative Meeting Moved to the Racecourse <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing has been doing business in Shanghai for fifty years. Friends and relatives at sea raised funds to celebrate and prepared public welfare projects. More than one hundred groups are listed as initiators, and those requesting to join continue to flock in. Hu Diansun and Hong Yanbin are in charge of the preparatory committee, with eight departments established below to assist in the grand event. Zhang Shenzhi is in charge of the documentation department, Chen Rongguan is in charge of the gift collection department, Liu Yaoting is in charge of the accounting department, Wang Xiaolai is in charge of the drama department, Fang Jiaobo is in charge of the reception department, Wu Yaqin is in charge of the general affairs department, Ma Shengxue is in charge of the banquet department, and Sun Meitang is in charge of the decoration department. The original address was the Ningbo Native Place Association, but it was feared that it would be too crowded, so it was moved to the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. Enter through Gate 14 on Mahe Road. Everyone who has a single day of acquaintance with Mr. Yu is enthusiastically contributing, both celebrating and helping the cause. Therefore, the gifts sent in recent days range from 1,000 yuan to several yuan. It is estimated that the proceeds from this meeting will be over 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Increased Fees and Taxes on Yangtze River Vessels <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Merchants Suppressing Chinese Ships</p>
<p>Customs Increases the Burden on Shipping Companies</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Freight Soars　Since the Yangtze River shipping companies have formed an alliance of six companies, foreign merchants have almost completely controlled all business-related events and price increases and decreases for fares. Although Chinese shipping companies are also members, their fleet is small and their power is weak, and they are often out of service. In reality, they are just standbys, listening to the instructions of foreign merchants. Cotton yarn exports are the largest item transported from Shanghai to the Yangtze River. The freight income is ten to four times that of ordinary goods. Therefore, foreign shipping companies compete to carry yarn, especially more fiercely than other goods. The freight for each piece of cotton yarn from Shanghai to Hankou, within 20 cubic feet, is charged at 3 taels and 6 and a half qian of silver. Yesterday, British shipping companies Jardine, Taikoo, and Japanese shipping company Nisshin, believing that foreign vessels loaded more cotton yarn than Chinese vessels, convened representatives of the six companies to a meeting at Jardine Matheson and proposed to increase the price of cotton yarn freight. In the past, one piece of 20 feet was charged, but now it is calculated as one ton of 40 feet, increasing the freight to 14 taels of silver, almost doubling the original price. This move by foreign merchants directly increases the huge income of the Yangtze River shipping companies and indirectly promotes their Shanghai-Yichang direct shipping vessels, because most of the cotton yarn goes to the upper reaches. The three foreign vessels are adding Yichang special express vessels, and this increase in the Shanghai-Hankou yarn price will make it more cost-effective for customers to reload their Yichang vessels. In effect, it will defeat the newly proposed Shanghai-Chongqing direct shipping vessels by Chinese merchants. The new freight rate has been agreed upon and will be notified to customers today. This is a fatal blow to Chinese shipping companies in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Re-争论 over Deck Tonnage Tax　The Shanghai Customs has announced that it will collect a tonnage tax of one qian of customs silver per ton of goods loaded on the deck and passageways of Shanghai's Yangtze River vessels. Shanghai's China Merchants, Sanbei, Ning Shao, Zhaoxing, and other shipping companies, as well as small Yangtze River companies operating Tongyang routes, believe that the Shanghai Customs' increased collection of deck cargo tax exceeds the scope of taxation and in fact hinders navigation and destroys the shipping industry. They convened representatives from various shipping companies to discuss at the shipping association and unanimously opposed it, stating their reasons and requesting the Ministries of Finance and Transportation to order the Customs to stop collecting it. The Ministry of Transportation has now replied, stating that the collection of the deck cargo tax is a type of new tax that the Customs intends to collect, and it seems difficult to stop. However, the procedures for collection should not hinder the voyage, and the Shanghai Shipping Association should send personnel to negotiate with the Shanghai Customs on how to facilitate it. The association notified the various shipping companies to send representatives to the meeting again to continue discussing the request for exemption. At the same time, at yesterday's meeting of the six companies to increase fees, representatives from the various Chinese shipping companies raised the issue again, requesting the British and Japanese shipping companies to join in demanding that the Customs fundamentally abolish the tax on deck cargo. It is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>Licenses for Mid-Yangtze River Vessels　Small Yangtze River vessels, namely Tongyang route vessels, operating in Shanghai include Datong, Dada, and other companies. Their ship licenses were previously obtained from the Ministry of Transportation and Customs. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government suddenly issued an instruction stating that Tongyang and other places are inland rivers of Jiangsu Province, and vessels operating there must obtain inland river ship licenses and pay ship license fees according to provincial government regulations. The various shipping companies in Shanghai believe that this duplicates the licenses issued by the Ministry of Transportation and Customs. Since merchant ships already pay tonnage dues, they should not be required to pay inland river ship license fees. It is inappropriate for both the province and the ministry to charge fees within the same area. They decided to petition for exemption.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Survey of the Magic Shoals Completed <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Ganlu, Jiaori, Jingxing and Other Ships Have Departed for Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ri Ri News Agency reported that since the Navy Department's Hydrographic Bureau planned to survey the Magic Shoals outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, it has been actively carrying out the work with all its might. Yesterday, a reporter from this agency visited Director Wu specifically for this matter. Director Wu happened to be in Beijing on official business, so a section chief met with the reporter instead. According to the section chief, the current in the Magic Shoals outside the Yangtze River is very rapid, and the work is extremely difficult due to weather conditions. This time, the Navy Department specifically dispatched survey ships such as Ganlu, Jiaori, and Jingxing to assist in the survey. All officers and soldiers worked very hard. All the engineering work was completed on the 30th of last month (June). The Ganlu and other ships also sailed back to Shanghai the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>Can Be Completed in Two or Three Days</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that the signal tower at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Pootung in the French Concession, which displays flag signals to report tide levels and weather information to benefit navigators, has been in operation for over fifteen years. The weather station is currently repairing and painting it, and it is expected to be completed in two or three days. It is reported that hurricane signals will be added thereafter. All hurricane and storm information obtained by the Xujiahui Observatory will be displayed using internationally accepted maritime flag signals to inform ships in a timely manner.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Industrial Products Must Not Be Tested by Foreigners <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Order of the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Goods Testing Institute at No. 4 Hehe Lane, Avenue Joffre, recently noted that the testing of industrial goods and raw materials has long been manipulated by foreigners, which not only spreads the secrets of our industrial technology and valuable raw materials abroad, serving as a basis for industrial competition, but also oversteps boundaries and harms national dignity. Therefore, it listed reasons for banning the practice and petitioned the Ministry of Industry to order all manufacturers across the country to ban the practice of testing industrial products by foreigners in order to uphold sovereignty. The following is an excerpt from the original order of the Ministry of Industry: (Omitted above) The points presented by Shen Xiongqing, director of the Testing Institute, are pertinent and commendable. However, it is already repeatedly ordered that industrial raw materials and goods must be tested, and the testing should be carried out by testing institutions publicly established by the state, local governments, society, or factories, to draw nationwide industrial and commercial attention. And more institutions should be established with improved equipment to build credibility and attract customers. That is why the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has established an industrial testing institute in the capital and separately informed the provincial and municipal governments of key locations, requesting them to quickly establish testing branches. It also circulated orders to major chambers of commerce, instructing all trade associations to jointly establish technical testing and research centers with similar factories to cooperate and support each other, urgently seeking to improve products and promote industrial and commercial development. Since the establishment of this Ministry, it has also continued to work towards this goal. (Omitted in the middle) And separately order the Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Yingkou Chambers of Commerce to inform all trade associations to pay close attention to the points presented by the director and rectify past mistakes to ensure strict compliance. (Omitted below).</p>

<p>If Both Sides Knew This Would Happen, Why Agree to the Engagement in the First Place?</p>
<p>The engagement dispute between Chen Zheng-fan and Zhang Rui-fen was scheduled to be heard by the Special District Court at 8:00 AM yesterday. Both parties were present, but due to incomplete procedures, a second summons is required. We have obtained correspondence between lawyers Dai Ji-en and Yuan Jing-tang, as well as four letters from Ms. Zhang herself to Mr. Chen, and publish them below.</p>
<p>Letter from Lawyer Dai Ji-en: To Mr. Chen Zheng-fan, it is stated that my client, Zhang Ren-qing, claims to have received your letter to his daughter, Rui-fen, dated December 16, 19 (details omitted). "To alleviate the suffering of both parties and maintain the happiness of both, I have already explained the matter in detail to the introducer on the 11th, and have asked them to negotiate a dissolution of the engagement with your parents." (details omitted). My client is indeed dissatisfied with your various actions. ××× has resided in my client's home for more than a year. ××× treats my client as a hostel owner, believing that a monthly payment of eight yuan is sufficient to cover everything. It is deemed advisable to dissolve the engagement with my daughter. Furthermore, regarding your residence for thirteen months, at a monthly rent of ten yuan and food expenses of twenty yuan, totaling 390 yuan, minus the 104 yuan already paid, you still owe 286 yuan. You are required to submit the outstanding 286 yuan to our office within three days for verification and sign a document dissolving the engagement, to ensure compliance. I have been entrusted to handle this matter on their behalf. Therefore, I urge you to come to this office within three days to sign the engagement dissolution document and pay the outstanding 286 yuan. Please do not delay, to avoid litigation. Sincerely, Dai Ji-en, Lawyer, March 16, 20.</p>
<p>Letter from Lawyer Yuan Jing-tang: To Mr. Dai Ji-en, it is stated that my client, Mr. Chen Zheng-fan, claims to have received your letter of the 16th of this month on behalf of Zhang Ren-qing, demanding that he dissolve his engagement with Zhang's daughter, Rui-fen, and demanding repayment of 286 yuan for room and board. He finds this deeply shocking. Since Mr. Chen and Rui-fen agreed to the engagement, their affection has been profound. In September of the 18th year, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Ren-qing invited Mr. Chen to reside in their home, providing one meal a day, with a monthly payment of eight yuan for room and board. After moving in, Mr. Chen noticed that Rui-fen, influenced by her family environment, lacked ambition, which conflicted with Mr. Chen's principles. As her fiancé, he repeatedly advised her, but Rui-fen ignored him and even worsened. Therefore, in December of last year, he wrote to Rui-fen to seek her opinion on dissolving the engagement. Rui-fen, considering their mutual affection, did not want to break up over trivial matters. They reconciled, and Mr. Chen formally retracted his previous proposal. For several months, their affection returned to its former state. Mr. Chen, considering the approaching auspicious date, actively prepared for the wedding. However, he suddenly received your letter from Mr. Zhang Ren-qing, demanding that he dissolve the engagement with Rui-fen. Both men and women have the absolute right to autonomous marriage rights, as stipulated by current laws. On what legal basis can Zhang Ren-qing demand that Mr. Chen dissolve his engagement with his adult daughter? If, unfortunately, this becomes a reality in the future, Zhang Ren-qing will be fully responsible for all the losses suffered by Mr. Chen as a result. As for the demand for repayment of 286 yuan for room and board, it is particularly base and laughable. Since both parties agreed to a monthly payment of eight yuan for room and board, all payments have been made on time, with no arrears. Now, six months after Mr. Chen moved out, Zhang Ren-qing is unreasonably demanding a large sum based on his personal opinion, which is illogical and unreasonable. The letter also contains malicious slander and reckless abuse, which are serious insults and intolerable. In addition to reserving the right to file a criminal lawsuit, I have been specially entrusted to reply. I hope you will inform your client accordingly. Sincerely, Yuan Jing-tang, Lawyer, March 28, 20.</p>
<p>Letter from Ms. Zhang Rui-fen: (First Letter) Mr. Zheng-fan, thank you for the portrait you gave me last time. A few days ago, I received a letter from Uncle Xing-qing. My father was very impressed with your character and learning. So, every afternoon at four o'clock this week, please come to my house, because my father wants to ask you a few questions. If you don't have time, you can come in the afternoon on Saturday or Sunday. I won't write much. I wish you well. The route is from the North Railway Station. Call a rickshaw to Gongxing Bridge on Baoxing Road. The fare is about ten cents. About twenty steps before crossing the bridge, you will see the sign of a pharmaceutical company. Rui-fen, 15th, (Received July 16, 18). (Second Letter) An esteemed Mr. Zheng-fan, I had the honor of reading your great work, and I am filled with admiration. From this, I know that you are a young man with great vision, profound knowledge, pure thoughts, and a bright future and fighting spirit. I was honored to have you visit my humble home the other day. I was surprised to read your letter of the 21st. Why are you so suspicious? It is only natural for my mother to ask about your family background and property. I am not talented, but I am very fortunate to have your attention. I am not boasting, but I am confident that I am better than others in housework, sewing, and cooking.</p>
<p>I specially wish you well, Rui-fen, 24th, (Received July 25, 18). (Third Letter) My beloved Zheng-fan, I have received your letter of the 16th and have been thinking about it for a day and a night. Now, I have decided to wait for you at the entrance of the Yokohama Bridge Good World at 1:00 PM this Saturday to talk. Please don't be late. Goodbye. Kiss, your sister Rui-fen, Thursday evening (Received December 19, 19). (Fourth Letter) My beloved Zheng-fan, it has been six or seven days since we parted. Why haven't you come? I know you have misunderstood something. I hope you can come to my house when you have time to talk and understand each other, so that I can feel at ease. I am afraid I will not be able to live long in this world if you treat me like this. Since you rejected me that day, I have been restless all day and cannot sleep at night. Alas, Heaven, Heaven, why don't you take my poor Rui-fen away? What is the use of staying in this world? It is better to die early and be at peace, so that people will not see a thorn in their side. Alas, Zheng-fan, Zheng-fan, I can't write any more. My heart is broken, my life is about to end. We'll talk later. Goodbye. The writing is illegible, the words are incoherent, and there are many typos. Please don't laugh. Written by the miserable Rui-fen, Wednesday evening (Received January 29, 20).</p>

<p>The Far East News Agency reports that Zhang, the wife of Finance Minister Song Ziwen, gave birth to twins, both daughters, at the Shanghai Sanatorium and Health Hospital in Huxi, Shanghai at 9:30 AM on the first of this month.

<p>A Ruffian Breaks into the Room with a Weapon</p>
<p>Arrested by Chance Encounter on the Street and Sent to Court</p>
<p>Song Wen-kui, a native of Beijing, runs the Xiangji Costume Shop at 344 Guangdong Road. His family also lives in the shop. Song has a daughter named Song Yu, who is 17 years old and quite beautiful. Fan Zhao-bing, an employee, has been coveting her for a long time, but has had no opportunity. Late at night on the 11th of last month, Fan saw that everyone in the shop was asleep, so he took a pair of sharp scissors and broke into her room, intending to take liberties with her. Song Yu woke up from her sleep, and Fan immediately took out the sharp scissors to threaten her into silence. Then he raped her. Song Yu was quite intelligent. When she was being raped, she frequently hit the wall with one hand. Her father and other employees, Liu Geng-sheng and Zhou Zheng-shan, were awakened and rushed to her room. Fan escaped through the side door and disappeared. It wasn't until 7:00 PM the day before yesterday that her father bumped into him at the intersection of Xizang Road and Fuzhou Road. He quickly shouted for his arrest and took him to the police station. Yesterday, he was brought before Judge Xu of the Special District Court for questioning. Song Yu described in detail how Fan had raped her at night with a weapon. Fan confessed that he had had relations with Song Yu in April, and that it had all happened in her bedroom. He claimed he was just going to continue their pleasure that night. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi pointed out that according to Song Yu's birth date, she was not yet 16 years old when they first had relations. This should be noted. Judge Xu then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, and Song Yu was sent to the forensic doctor for examination, pending further questioning.</p>

<p>Escorted by District Chief Xu Pu-cheng</p>
<p>After the bandit leader Tai Bao Ah-shu was brought to justice, his gang members who were arrested and are currently detained in the police station include Lu Fu-gen, Chen Ah-san, Li Wei-shi, Cao Fei-shi, and Wu Qian-shi, five men and women. The case has not yet been concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge Zhi-qin of the Special District Court held a continued hearing. District Chief Xu Pu-cheng personally went to court to request their transfer to the Jiangsu Provincial Government Security Team for punishment. It has been verified that Lu Fu-gen is actually an alias for Chen Xiang, whose name is listed in the name list of the bandit gang previously seized. Li Wei-shi is actually Zhang Ai-wen, the original name in the extradition case of Li Wen-jun. Wu Qian-shi is the wife of Tang Yi-xin, who has already been executed, nicknamed "Sister Mei." In addition, Cao Fei-shi is the mother of Tai Bao Ah-shu, and Chen Ji-san is Ah-shu's younger brother. Both are important members of the bandit gang. However, police lawyer Wang Yao-tang expressed opposition to the extradition of Chen Ah-san, stating that Chen is only 13 years old and cannot be considered a member of the bandit gang. He should be released. Judge Ge then ordered Chen Ah-san to be released and temporarily detained in the police station, pending his family's return. The remaining four men and women were handed over to Xu Pu-cheng, the First District Chief of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, to be returned for investigation.</p>

<p>After Weng Jun, the Chief of the Third District of the Qingxiang Bureau in Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province, was kidnapped by bandits, his father, Weng Jin-rong, received a letter from the bandits demanding 20,000 yuan for ransom and instructing him to go to Room 304 of the Central Hotel at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Hubei Road in Shanghai to negotiate the ransom. Weng then sent Xu Gui-fang as his representative to Shanghai. When Xu arrived in Hangzhou, he reported his mission to the Provincial Public Security Bureau.

After talking for a while, the detectives arrested Yuan as he left and took him to the police station. Xu testified that the conversation with Yuan was indeed about the ransom.

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau recently received a secret report that the board of directors of the Shengshi Yu Zhai Charity was colluding with foreign merchants, claiming creditor's rights, and attempting to auction off the charity's property immediately. The bureau believes that the charity's charitable fund assets have been submitted to the competent department by the Executive Yuan, and a notice has been issued by the municipal government prohibiting changes. Before a decision is made by the Executive Yuan, no one may dispose of the property. Therefore, the bureau has issued separate instructions to the board of directors of the Yu Zhai Charity and Zhong Ke-cheng of the China Business Company to strictly stop the auction and has reported the details to the municipal government for approval.</p>

<p>Municipal Ferry Offers Free Transportation</p>
<p>Gaoqiao City in Shanghai is a prosperous area, but mail is delivered only once a day, which is inconvenient for local residents. Since the municipal ferry began operating to Gaoqiao, the Municipal Public Utility Bureau suggested to the Shanghai Postal Administration that the number of postal deliveries to Gaoqiao be increased, with the municipal ferry providing free transportation for public convenience. It is heard that an agreement has been reached with the post office to conduct a trial period of three months, starting on July 1. The frequency of postal deliveries between Shanghai and Gaoqiao will be increased once a day, namely: (A) From Shanghai to Gaoqiao, at 7:00 AM (from October 6 to March 15 of the following year, the time will be changed to 8:00 AM) and 1:00 PM.

<p>At 6:30 AM yesterday, a duty soldier, Belford Harold, died from a bullet wound to the head on the roof of the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters at 50 Haifang Road. His left hand was still tightly gripping a rifle. First Class Corporal Christmas, who was in charge of the radio, suddenly heard a gunshot from the roof and went to investigate. He found Belford lying in a pool of blood. The deceased was 23 years old. He had attended drill with his comrades in the morning. After the drill, he said he was going back to his room to clean his gun. As a rule, guns are not loaded with live ammunition during drill. If there is a bullet in the gun, it will fire when the gun is cleaned. Therefore, it is suspected that the deceased's death was due to suicide. The remains have been transported to the International Funeral Home and will be shipped back to the United States next month for burial.</p>

First, the victim, Qu Shi-xiang, continued to recount everything. Then, Zhuang Lian-sheng, Wang Shu-you, and others testified. Their testimonies were the same as those of Ma Qu and others. Next, Western Detective Mooney testified that he investigated the case and arrived at the scene when a group of Chinese people were chasing the defendants, Monahan and Gines, to the back of the Gordon Road bar. The Chinese people threw stones and broke several windows of the club. Also, the chauffeur Tan Fu-lin described what he witnessed, which was largely the same as what Ma Qu and others said. He also said that Monahan and Ma Cheng-bu, as well as another person who had been stabbed, fought for two or three minutes before Monahan took out a knife and committed the crime. U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Waller testified that after Monahan was arrested, he initially denied stabbing anyone, but later admitted to stabbing two people. The weapon used was a small knife in an ordinary pocket. He then presented the knife as evidence and said that Monahan had a wound on his leg and several other wounds on his body. The wound on his leg was obviously caused by an iron bar. First Class Duty Soldier Burt testified that two windows of the club were broken. When the questioning was over, the presiding officer announced the adjournment. The defendant Monahan will be summoned for questioning today.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Various Industries Associations Request to Revise Business Tax Rates <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Tax Regulations Research Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Association of Various Industries recently received letters from the Shanghai Municipal Association of Department Stores, Woolen Fabric Industry, and Opticians Associations, stating that the business tax rates set by the city for these industries were quite unfair, and requested that they be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for revision. Yesterday, the association forwarded the request to the Ministry of Finance for reduction based on the circumstances. The original text of the request to the Ministry of Finance is as follows:</p>
<p>A request to request the business tax of department stores, woolen fabrics, eyeglasses, etc. in this city is unfair and should be reviewed and revised to meet the business situation.</p>
<p>It is hereby informed that the business tax rate in this city has been drafted by the Finance Bureau and approved by the State Council for submission to the Ministry of Finance. However, the business tax for all department stores, woolen fabrics, eyeglasses, etc. is still unfair. The reasons are hereby respectfully stated and submitted to the ministry for review and revision to meet the business situation.</p>
<p>(1) The nature of the business of department stores is completely the same as that of foreign goods industry and should not be inferior. According to the explanation of the Ministry of Finance No. 1946, whether the department stores in the large commercial ports are under the scope of foreign goods industry should be clearly defined. According to the nature of the department store, it is an expansion of foreign goods business and should be temporarily levied business tax as foreign goods industry. It is very clear that the draft proposed by the city for the foreign goods industry is levied at a rate of 2 per 1,000, while the department stores with the same nature are levied at a rate of 3 per 1,000. This is not only unfair, but also violates the interpretation of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>(2) Woolen fabrics, foreign fabrics, silk and satin, are all the raw materials for clothing, and most of them are operated in the same stores. The tax rates set in the draft are 1 per 1,000 for cotton fabrics and silk fabrics, and 3 per 1,000 for the woolen fabrics industry. Although most woolen fabrics are imported, it is not appropriate to levy a high tax rate on the domestic woolen fabrics industry at this time. Moreover, Article 7 of the Supplementary Measures to the Levy Tax stipulates that foreign goods and native goods shall be taxed at the same tax rate. The ministry should reduce the business tax of the woolen fabrics industry to the same rate of 1 per 1,000 as the cotton fabrics and silk fabrics industries.</p>
<p>(3) Eyeglasses are tools for eye protection. Many countries in the world list them as medicinal materials and supplies. However, the draft proposed by the city imposes the highest tax rate, as if they were luxury goods, which is not a fair approach. The ministry should reduce the business tax of the eyeglasses industry to the same rate of 1 per 1,000 as the medicinal materials industry.</p>
<p>The request has been sent to the association by the industries, and it is necessary to forward it. When the city's business tax is revised, the department stores should be taxed at the same rate of 2 per 1,000 as the foreign goods industry, and the woolen fabrics industry should be taxed at the same rate as the cotton fabrics industry, silk fabrics industry, and the eyeglasses industry should be taxed at the same rate as the medicinal materials industry at 1 per 1,000 to show fairness and conform to the business situation.</p>

(10) The minimum salary for staff should be 50 taels of silver per person, and the minimum salary for workers should be 30 taels of silver; inspectors should receive a monthly allowance of 15 yuan for Shanghai horse fees. (11) Workers should be allowed sick leave without deduction of wages. (12) Fines should not be forcibly deducted for minor reasons, and staff and workers should not be dismissed without cause; if dismissed, they should be given five years' worth of severance pay. (13) Staff and workers who have worked for one year should be given two months' worth of retirement pay upon retirement, and more will be given by analogy. (14) Temporary workers should be calculated according to the standards of permanent workers, and their wages and treatment should be the same as permanent workers. (15) Workers who have been dismissed from the union without cause should be reinstated, and their wages should be supplemented. (16) There should be no restrictions on the number of workers or the time limit for work. (17) Workers' wages should be doubled on snowy days in cold weather.</p>

(3) Regarding the previous letter requesting each section head to prepare a plan for special expenses for the purchase of necessary equipment for this year and submit it to the meeting for unified budgeting, it has been a long time and it has not been done. The resolution was to send a circular to each section, urging them to submit it within a time limit. (4) The federation's existing buildings are insufficient for use, and it is proposed to temporarily rent the third floor of the No. 1 Fire Brigade for office use from July. The resolution was to do so. (5) The federation's original fire trucks have been repaired and it is proposed to put them into operation on July 1st. The resolution was to approve it.

<p>I have just read a special dispatch in today's issue of your newspaper regarding the estimated income from the opium suppression policy. The Nanjing dispatch stated that the Anti-Opium Association's investigation revealed that there are at least five million opium addicts in China today, and that the number of people using substitutes in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Rehe actually exceeds five million. If each person pays an opium tax of 20 yuan per year, that would be a revenue of 20 million, enough to cover half of China's total military expenditure.</p>
<p>We have absolutely never made such a statement, and anti-opium organizations throughout the country would absolutely not make such a proposal. As for Nanjing, there is currently no anti-opium organization established there. We do not know the basis for this news. Our association has always advocated a policy of complete suppression and prohibition, and opposes collecting opium taxes to fund military and administrative expenses. Our position on opium suppression is based entirely on the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's anti-opium teachings. We would never consider taxing opium under any circumstances. This dispatch is simply untrue and can easily cause misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Therefore, we respectfully request that your newspaper promptly correct this to clarify the truth, and please publish the original letter as is. We would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Association</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have just received a statement from my client, Tang Genquan, stating that he read a news item in today's local newspapers about a bloody incident at the Huayanglou on Fuyou Road, implicating Genquan and others who fled to avoid involvement. This is not in accordance with the facts. Genquan was a detective in the Public Security Bureau, stationed in a district, and has always been careful and dutiful, with no misconduct. He does not know the "Little Wang" mentioned in the report, and he was not at the Huayanglou at the time of the incident. Since the incident had nothing to do with Genquan, why would he need to avoid involvement? The Second Precinct of the First District has also not investigated him. The report in the newspapers is clearly not factual and is likely to damage his reputation. He has entrusted me to write a letter to request a correction.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am writing to you respectfully to ask for a correction, as a matter of public interest.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Huang Qiying</p>

<h3 id="e163">Financial Banks Still Closed <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Financial Market Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday, banks remained closed, and the market was dull and uninteresting. The prices of foreign silver dollars in the market were also very depressed. The opening price in the morning was 7 qian, 2 fen, 6 li, 5 hao, and the closing price in the afternoon was 7 qian, 2 fen, 6 li, a slight decrease of 2 hao and 5 si compared to the previous day. The silver swap rate, however, felt higher. The morning rate was 1 qian, and the afternoon rate was 1 qian and 4 fen, due to the lack of activity in the head lining during the closure. The transaction volume for export payments was 260,000 in the morning and 715,000 in the afternoon. The transaction volume for banknotes was only 25,000 in the afternoon. The over-the-counter banknote transaction volume was 65,000 in the morning and 50,000 in the afternoon. Qianzhuang cleared over 3.8 million in foreign public bills and over 37 million in silver public bills. Remittances from various routes amounted to over 400,000. The transaction volume of small qianzhuang was 400,000 to 500,000. The morning price of small Jiangnan silver dollars was 6 qian, 4 fen, 9 li, 5 hao, and the afternoon price was 6 qian and 5 fen, an increase of 1 li compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 5,500 jiao in the morning and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon. The morning price of small Guangdong silver dollars was 6 qian, 4 fen, 5 li, and the afternoon price was 6 qian, 4 fen, 4 li, 3 hao, 7 hu and half. The transaction volume was 85,000 jiao in the morning and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were priced at 378,000 wen, a slight increase of 500 wen compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Big Silver Line Recovers to .0625 <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was July 2nd, the second day of the banks' semi-annual closing for accounting, so all Chinese and foreign banks were still closed, and there were no reports of financial exchange rates. However, a telegram from London stated that Chinese bankers had bought in after selling, and some short positions were covered. The market was flat, and the market was stable after the close. There were buyers below the listed price of .0625. Big silver lines all showed a slight recovery, such as near and far futures recovering to .0625, both at 13 pence .5625. Another telegram from New York stated that there was no change, with spot prices at 29.125 cents and private telegrams still at 29.375 cents. The market was firm. The pound rose .05125 against the dollar, to $4.86375. The dollar rose .0625 against the pound, to 4 pounds, 8 shillings, 6 pence, 32 out of 13. The dollar-yen rate remained at 49.4 yuan, and the pound-yen rate remained at 2 shillings .0375. The pound-Shanghai shilling rate remained at 1 shilling, 4 pence, 25. The Bombay spot market recovered two anna, to 44 rupees, 13 anna, and the forward market rose one anna, to 44 rupees, .08 anna, and the market was firm.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Still Circulating <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market trend is very weak, but the overseas cotton yarn situation is still firm. However, local sentiment has softened, as large households have sold, and the amount is very large, so the market atmosphere has become very loose, and retail bulls are even more panic-stricken, so the market is difficult to stabilize. As for the sellers, seeing that a certain large household has the intention of giving up, they are more courageous and throw out all together when prices rise, so the market is even weaker. However, 16-count and 20-count yarn prices are very tight, and Japanese yarn prices are rising, but coarse yarn trends are more stagnant and deeply affected. The internal situation of futures yarn is complicated, so the spot price is rising, but the standard yarn is falling, all in a confusing situation.</p>
<p>Human Biao Firm in the Morning, Weak in the Afternoon The human biao exchange opened in the morning, with the previous day's spot sales situation good, and American cotton also rising, which led to good sentiment and a tighter market. The near month rose one or two liang. Then, at the two-three plate, a certain large household sold, and the market fell sharply. As a result, each month fell three, four, five, or six qian. The market atmosphere was still soft in the afternoon, and each month fell another three or four qian. The transaction volume was 39,000 bales. Mei Ji sold 1,450 bales, Yu Da sold 1,100 bales, Heng De sold 950 bales, Xin Cheng sold 2,300 bales, and He Shen sold 1,350 bales. Tong Yu bought 700 bales, Tian Long bought 700 bales, Heng Chang bought 950 bales, Yi Yu bought 1,300 bales, and De Ji bought 700 bales. The closing prices of human biao are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Human Biao Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory Account</p>

<p>September 1588 Down 1.0 75,100 December 1601 Down 8</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Not Weak Spot yarn sales are still good. It is found that the statistics of all gangs buying throughout the day are 1,350 bales, of which 1,000 bales were bought by the same industry, a rise of 5 qian. Customer gangs bought 140 bales from the mainland, 115 bales from Sichuan, 190 bales from Guangdong, 160 bales from Hankou, 45 bales from the Northern Gang, 245 bales from Gaoyang, 40 bales from Yunnan, 105 bales from Shantou, 130 bales from Changsha, and 35 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>

<p>The cotton market is tired, but the overseas cotton market has risen slightly. However, the local sentiment is scattered due to the sluggish yarn market and the quiet demand for cotton from various factories. As a result, most people's psychology is lukewarm, but Japanese merchants have a firm attitude and have no intention of loosening, and are buying in the near month. It is found that most of the merchants in the market are throwing out in the far month, and they dare not predict the future situation.</p>
<p>Han Biao Sees a Fall The Han Cotton Exchange opened in the morning, falling by one or two qian with the yarn market. In the afternoon, the near month rose by five fen, and the far month was flat. The transaction volume was 51,700 dan. Ji Feng sold 1,400 dan, Da Feng sold 1,100 dan, Shen Chang sold 1,100 dan, and Heng De sold 1,200 dan. Geng Feng bought 1,700 dan, Da Chang Cheng bought 1,000 dan, Yuan Da bought 1,000 dan, Yong Feng bought 1,400 dan, and Gong Tai bought 1,400 dan.

<p>American Cotton Counters Short Selling Slightly Yesterday, American cotton was tired at first due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but then it was firm due to the strength of Wall Street and the covering of short positions. Futures fell by 21 to 24 points, spot prices rose by 20 points, British cotton rose by one point, spot prices rose by three points, Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by ten points, and Indian cotton market was firm due to purchases by exporters, speculators, and Japanese merchants. Pingguo'er and Bailuoxi rose by one rupee, and Aomu La fell by one rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left: (1st Day Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e168">Grain and Rice Market Rises and Then Loosens <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Xinzha Yesterday, about twenty or thirty boats arrived at the Western Road from various gangs. Sales were initially sluggish and then brisk. Su Chang thick japonica rice was extremely sluggish in the morning, and prices continued to soften. Store intentions turned weak, and top goods continued to be weak by 2 jiao. Middle customs, on the other hand, felt slightly stronger, but this was not a formal market. Thin rice arrived in abundance but sales were weak, and the market softened again by 2 or 3 chi. Du Yang tip was still actively inquired about on this street, and the source was not very abundant, so prices dropped nearly a chi. Ba Bu tip sales were poor and the goods were limited. Sentiment was not good, so the trend fell by about 1 jiao. Few guest tips were loaded, and the sales were few, so the price recovered by 1 or 2 jiao. The large plate of glutinous rice also went downstream. All rice in the city was uniformly tired. The opening of river goods was less than 2,000 shi.</p>
<p>Hunan Yesterday's rice situation was sunny, with 32 or 33 ships arriving. Urban and rural sales markets were sluggish. Early rice was still arriving sporadically. The arrival of early rice from Su, Xi, and Su, and other goods was quite frequent, but buying sentiment was quiet, and the market was therefore tired. The large plate shortened by 3 or 4 jiao. The transactions of Nan Gang's various thin rice from this street and rural gangs were extremely sluggish, so they shortened by 2 or 3 jiao. Du Yang tip was still considered acceptable for fresh tops, but the secondary tops were sluggish, and the price shortened by nearly a chi. Shadowed, high-quality goods remained fixed, while mid-range goods were cheapened and cornered. Sales of foreign rice were not smooth, and rural stomachs were also watching, so prices continued to be down a small jiao or so.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Flour Market Initially Tired and Then Strong <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed signs of initial fatigue followed by strength in various months after the opening. Because the Chicago foreign report price was about 5 or 7 jiao lower, the market atmosphere was once weak. However, because the factory throwing was very quiet, and because the negotiations between the United States and France had not yet been properly completed, there was a deep fear that the gold market opening price would have at least one impact. As a result, the sentiment remained strong, and the throwers suddenly hesitated. Until the afternoon opening, because the manufacturers still tended to reject the situation, the sentiment of outsiders was even more energetic. In addition, although Tianjin's current sales were not smooth, those who wanted to do futures were quite abundant, so the market presented a strong step again. However, when the country is still in a state of surplus, if the foreigners stubbornly raise the price too much, it is difficult to avoid the throwing pressure of foreign wheat. As a result, this month was good for five li, August was good for one fen, September and October were good for seven and a half li, and November and December were good for one fen.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Wheat Market Difficult to Get Too Good <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening of the afternoon market in various months, was initially settled due to the foreign wheat report being 5 or 7 jiao lower. However, after that, outsiders competed to cover their short positions, and the sentiment was stimulated. Although there was no market for gold prices, the opinions on the US-French war debt had not yet been approached, and speculators were also very active in preventing changes in the gold market. On average, each month was compared and calculated to recover 4 or 5 fen. Until the various plates in the afternoon, the accumulation of spot wheat was very abundant after all, and the manufacturers were indifferent and had no large-scale appetite. In this case, it was impossible to be too high (factory and merchant households had eight ships of foreign wheat in the opening price, and if this batch was transferred, people's hearts might have to change drastically), so the selling atmosphere was strong, and the market returned to a small two or three fen. After observing, because of the abundant existence of spot wheat, it is still not optimistic. As a result, July, August and September were better than one fen, October and November were better than three fen, and December was incomparable. The situation of spot wheat is still softening. The manufacturers had too thick a reserve, so they had to respond. The whole city opened 4,000 bags of Taizhou Taipingqiao Huangqiaokou Anqing Chuzhou Nanjing Liuhe Wusong Anting Penglai wheat, which was handled by Fuxin Shenda.</p>

<p>Coarse Sand White Fell and Was Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegraph, Cuban spot sugar prices rose 9.375, New York sugar futures September and December each rose three fen, and next year's March and May each rose two fen. Java spot sugar futures still did not rise or fall. The association market divided the plates, and the transaction price of 24th grade coarse sand white of Dutch sugar was up to 10 taels and 09 qian, 20th grade medium sand white was 10 taels and 04 qian and a half, and 8th grade Dutch red was 9 taels and 2 qian. Transactions were scattered, and the market was flat and tired. Japanese sugar was more active, and prices rose slightly. The transaction price of N-mark old goods was 10 taels and 08 qian and a half, YT mark was 10 taels and 08 qian, new goods were 10 taels and 08 qian and a half, YP mark was 11 taels and 1 qian and a half, new goods were 11 taels and 2 qian, J mark was 11 taels and 2 qian and a half, TM mark was 10 taels and 07 qian, YRO mark was 10 taels and 06 qian, and the market was still strong. Taikoo B mark was 11 taels and 2 qian, and later called 11 taels and 2 qian and a half. The demanding hands were very quiet. The factory plate had Meiji sugar August and September goods YT mark price of 4 yuan and 5 jiao in Japanese gold, still being sold. The new factory ETER mark was opened for sale of 5,000 bags, and the price was 4 yuan and 6 jiao. It was single August goods and had been opened.</p>

<p>Handled Directly by Guangdong Gang</p>
<p>The new Zhengzhou golden needle vegetables have now arrived in Hankou. According to a letter yesterday, more than ten pieces arrived in the first batch, and then 26 taels were directly handled by the Guangdong Gang. However, this price is estimated to require 30 taels in Shanghai, which is difficult to calculate. It is difficult to transport to Shanghai for the time being. The various kinds of golden vegetables produced in Zhenjiang will also be on the market in the middle of this month. It is found that the top stock of old goods stored in Shanghai has been cut off, and there are more secondary stocks. There are few upper and middle stocks of 18 or 19 taels, middle stocks of 15 or 16 taels, and secondary stocks of 13 or 14 taels. The market situation is flat.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market in Shanghai foreign villages, stemmed fine eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan Tunxi and other roads, Yongxing Baochang Tianxiang Jinlong and other firms, all had appetite, and transactions were quite lively. The sales plate ranged from 150 to 230 taels, and there was no increase or decrease compared to before. The ordinary fine eyebrow market is still sluggish. Only the low stock goods from Wenzhou Yushan and other roads in the whole city had a little trading, and the rest were sparse. British and French merchants still have more demand for needle eyebrow and show eyebrow items, and the market plate has not changed. Other tribute Xi pearl tea and other goods have no large transactions.</p>

<p>This year's spring tea production in Yu County has been reduced. Most of it is supplied to domestic shops and stores. The tea shops in Hekou Zhangcun Street Shangrao Foreign Village also have a considerable sales market. The remaining spring tea is scarce. Recently, the Zi tea in the county is also being picked. The out-of-stock is better than the first tea. And because the weather is balanced, the production is still abundant. However, because this year's tea shortage has been reported from all roads, the quality and taste of the Zi tea is excellent, so everyone lives for the odd goods. The market price has been raised to 70 yuan per dan. Although the Anhui and Ben bang tea dealers have been pouring in to talk about the market, they are afraid to open the scale and buy because of the high disk price, and the sales market is therefore slow.</p>
