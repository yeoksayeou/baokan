<h3 id="c56">討論兒童讀物尚仲衣 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>（再答吳研因先生）</p>
<p>讀五月十九日申報吳研因先生之文頗覺吳先生對於仲衣所發表的言論之對象不無誤解誠恐兒童敎育界諸同志受暗示而同歸於誤會故特此表白以劈疑慮至於涉及意氣之話語似在學術討論範圍之外恕不參加意見</p>
<p>一吳先生文中說『　讀了尚先生的大作空氣非常緊張好像現在中國小學敎科書充满了尚生所說的『幻想性童話』其實呢我可以用笑話安慰尚先生我們敝國的小學敎科書根本就未嘗和美國的敎科書一樣關於『幻想性童話』的材料實在不多就是國語敎科書有一些兒也是微乎其微的可是鄙人也並不以爲尚先生的言論是『無的放矢』中國的小學敎科書將來或者誤會變成美國的敎科書一樣充满了『幻想性童話一』</p>
<p>吳先生所指者是仲衣之『再論兒童讀物』一文但該文所討論的是『兒童讀物』並非專指『敎科書』</p>
<p>現在姑就坊間流行之國語敎科書論據三十册（商務之新時代一至八册新學制一至八册及中華之新中華一至七册新小學一至四六至八册）國語敎科書之檢查『違反自然現象』的材料占全部百分之二十一至於普通一般的兒童讀物此種的成分當不止此數（附帶說明美國新興的敎科書如HordyGageHrno等的讀本其中『連反自然現象』的材料却是極少讀本不在手頭未能確知其成分但就記憶所及决在百分之二十一以下）</p>
<p>二吳先生文中說『至於擁護『幻想性童話』的人呢尚先生的論文好像指定其我其實尚先生誤會了我雖茅塞未開决不致於做『幻想童話』的忠臣我方在急於要完成一種低年级充满自然新事（不避烏言獸語）的國語敎科書無睱多所討論尚祈尚先生除『烏言獸語』是否就是神怪故事而應該打破的一問題外别再發不很關於本題的言論否則不但離題太遠鄙人也不敢再和尚先生討論了在兒童敎育社討論兒童讀物的選擇時仲衣共提出九條消極標準和十條積極的標準『違反自然現豐是消極標準之一將十九條標準擁擠在三十分鐘裏却覺詩短意長不能盡所欲言所以當塲就對衆聲言『在不久的將來將另有較詳盡較精確的討論以就正於諸位『那時就擬將十九條標準分草數文『再論兒童讀物』即其一係專論『違反自然現象『的續物的前後的言論都是以兒童敎育社諸同志爲對象以供他們的參考備他們的批評的在兒童敎育社討論時固未念及吳先生及發表該文時亦不過附帶妥解答吳先生的疑問而已其主旨還是對諸同志闡發未盡之言並非專指吳先生吳先生以爲仲衣指定是他係誤會三吳先生說『倘不認清尚先生的高論以爲尚先生也反對『貓狗敎科書』則『天地日月』···</p>
<p>的敎科書或者會復活起來『</p>
<p>這段直接地不涉及仲衣但亦可借此機會鄭重聲明對於物語以及其他的違反自然現象的讀物仲衣雖是極懷疑極消極然對於兒童讀物的希望却不是要復古而是要由童話物語更進一步去求那健全無疵合乎情理不違反自然的種種讀物</p>
<p>四吳先生問『『烏言獸語』是否就是神怪故事而應該打破』</p>
<p>神怪故事之違反自然現象在其内容物語之違反自然多在其形式彼此雖有違反自然的情狀上之差别而其『違反自然現象』則一對於此類違反自然的讀物在『再論兒童讀物』文中仲衣已有坦白的表示現在姑重申一句一與其用價值可疑而含危機性之違反自然的讀物人何不用有其價值而無其危機之根據於事實和可能材料的讀物『縮其範　則可專指物語』與其用價值可疑而含危機性的物語何不用有其價值而無其危機之自然讀物</p>
<p>因爲物語之違反自然大多只在形式而不深入内容故其所含之危機性或較少於神怪故事即如仲衣在兒童敎育社討論時曾說『兒童在讀物　看見貓會講話尚有修正的機會···所以仲衣對於物語的態度較之對於神怪故事稍爲寛容但是進一步的問『爲何給兒童一種尚須修正的觀念而不直接的給他一種無須乎修正的觀念『所以現在仲衣所持的問題是』若不用鳥言獸語而能得到同樣的（或較好的）效果而同時又可免去其危機的可能（至少可以省去修正的周听）爲何一定要用烏言獸語』若說不用物語即不能得到同樣的或較好的效果法國的Fabre美國的Selon等人作品則如何以上是從原則上看去實際上呢對於兒童讀物仲衣主張將物語的數量大加删削以讓出位置給健全無疵不違反自然的自然故事和科學讀物在原則上在實際上這是仲衣的立塲</p>
<p>在兒童敎育社討論時仲衣所用之『打破』兩字是完全出於談笑的口氣用以表示對『違反自然』的消極態度和吳先生用笑話安慰仲衣相類似當日在　諸同　大都能了解用那兩字的態度若以爲仲衣不應在學衛討論中涉及談笑就此機會諸同志告疏忽</p>
<p>但無論是否『打破』仲衣對於一切違反自然的讀品確是消極確是懷疑</p>

<p>— 黄炎培</p>
<p>一人安城町便見很高很大的木牌兩方上寫碧海郡在鄉軍人會和安城町青年團日本全國都辦青年國青年團的章程雖各處略略的不同但任何巿町村没一個不辦因爲政府的命令國家的政策在這喪邊有非常重大的意義萬不許不辦他們的辦法有的規定年齡自十幾歲至二十來歲有的規定程度以某種學校畢業爲限用什麽方法使人人入團呢平常服兵役須二年青年團員只須一年半兵分上中下三等待遇循序而升但青年團員得一躍而爲上等兵所以人人願人青年團他們怎樣敎法呢（一）體格鍛鍊（二）人格訓練（三）職業訓練前邊已說遇了究竟他們爲什麽用這般大的氣力這般大的規模來辦青年團呢究竟爲什麽呢老實說罷爲的是預備打仗打誰呢傅聞是打某國入内他們爲什麽要打某國呢爲什麽牽連我國入内呢究竟爲那一件事那一片土呢願吾國人大家想一想</p>
<p>爲什麽打仗便於青年團有關係呢就爲是他們種種準備軍略呀戰衛呀軍呀軍需呀都還可以就是人口總嫌少些一個一個把性命來拚恐怕不够只有以少要勝人多許的一法兵是練過的現役軍人外有常備有續備再往下去怎樣呢如果把十幾歲至二十來歲的青年個個精練得合格做他後備的後備那就不怕了而且把這班青年全國都團結起來要灌輪什麽思想也易得要申討什麽仇敵也易得他們的用心是怎樣的深刻呀是怎樣的很辣呀</p>
<p>所以青年團還得與在鄉軍人會聯絡在一起是要前輩帶領後輩呀</p>
<p>安城的青年團以五個尋常小學做中心但高小及補習學校生徒皆得加人且不限於男女團長由町長兼任這是校長告訴我的</p>

<p>我們中國的人民輾轉呻吟於列强的壓迫之下惟原究底也莫非是鴉片戰爭種下來的禍根我們只要細細的研究林文忠公終於得不到最後勝利的緣故並不是因爲他個只缺少毅力而是没有同志可以繼續他的志願因爲没有组織的團體以致偌大的事業全仗着他個人的精神毅力去硬幹所以等到他一個人失勢之後拒毒的事業也就隨之停頓這是九十二年前拒毒運動失敗的唯一的原因也就是九十二年來拒毒運動失敗的唯一的原因我們旣然覺悟到這一層我們全國的拒毒同志便非同起團結奮鬭不可現在國民政府雖旣三令五申地嚴禁鴉片但是各省仍有許多軍人正在迫民種烟包庇運土國外的麻醉毒物仍舊不絶地秘密輸入鴉片公賣的主張仍甚　塵上我們處於這個情勢之下應該團結一致的加入國民拒毒運動做澈底禁烟的後盾使國内的鴉片毒物從此肅清大家來繼續九十二年前林文忠公的偉大志願方才不至讓這六三紀念日空空過去現在國民政府已經規定今天做禁烟的紀念日而且兩年來全國都轟轟烈烈的舉行過去這是我們全國拒毒同志唯一的紀念日我們應該越發努力的繼續林公的遺志澈底的剷除一切毒禍那末林文忠公雖然殞志而亡但日他的氣魄和大無畏的拒毒精神將要永遠留存在中國民族人人的心上他是全中國拒毒運動的急先鋒他的偉大的精神和人格是我們所應該認識的這便是六三紀念對於我們的最大的供獻謹此宣言</p>

<h3 id="c158">新聞政策 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 黃奐若</p>
<p>杜超彬著</p>
<p>新聞政策這是一個非常新鮮的名詞因爲是我國還没有人談到過我國從事新聞事業的人員對於新聞學有研究者很少而對於國際間的新聞界狀况尤多隔膜因此爲近代各帝國主義者所利用以作爲政治外交上的後盾與先鋒工具的新聞政策竟漠然不知這是非常可以痛心而危險的一件事</p>
<p>我國歷年在國際上的處處失敗都是受的列强新聞政策之虧因爲目前的所謂新聞政策正如黃天鵬先生所說已成国國際對抗的宣傅政策野心家從而利用之成爲政治的工具外交的利器如我國民國十四年被英帝國主義者造成的五卅慘案十七年被日帝國主義者造成的五三濟案以及不勝枚舉的種種帝國主義者留下的侵略的痕迹孰是孰非原屬顯明之事實然而第爲帝國主義者新聞政策的毒素宣傅顛倒黑白淆亂視聽以至未能得到公理的評判含寃莫訴我國無新聞政策的損失有若是之大爲適應民族存的要求我國需要建設健全的新聞致策是急不容缓之事正如黃天鵬先生說的有了新聞政策對外才有喉舌外人的毒素宣傅便無所施其伎俩有了新聞政策對内幼稚的報業有正軌可偱可以逐漸的發展</p>
<p>然而我國新聞敎育的發生雖雖已有了十多年的歷史但研究新聞學者所貢獻於新聞事業者却很渺小除了黃天鵬先生有了驚人的大量著作外祇有戈公振徐寳璜二先生有些貢獻此外竟没有可以稱佩的成績了過去的十多年中是在這樣的狀况之下裏步直到最近二三年來才有些蓬勃之氣象研究新聞學心得之作也如夏夜的明星一樣的穿着燦爛之衣漸漸地一顆顆地出現了現在我要介紹的杜超彬君的這本（新聞政策）便是其中炫耀着一顆呢</p>
<p>全書共分六章篇首有謝六逸戈公振黃天鵬三先生的序文對該書均有满意之批評第一章爲導言第二章爲新聞政策發凡第三章新聞政策的近狀第四章新聞政策的展生第五章新聞政策與中國第六章結語當我一章一章地讀後覺得這本書確有一讀的價值叙述旣明白立論亦正確最後指示出我國新聞業應該採取的民族主義新聞政策尤爲這書不朽之點特謹將該書的大要與價值分章介紹於讀者想關懷新聞事業者亦樂聞的罷</p>
<p>第一章導言在這一章裏他把新聞政策的意義新聞政策的重要很詳細的解釋外更把現在國際間的新聞政策歸納爲兩大類一係各國對外的新聞政策一屬其對内的新聞政策一最可注意者便是他把各國對外的新聞政策分爲三大派别</p>
<p>（一）資本主義的新聞政策以高壓爲手段以侵略爲目的</p>
<p>（二）社會主義的新聞政策不擇任何手段以侵略爲目的</p>
<p>（三）民族主義的新聞政策以和平奮門爲手段以逹到獨立自由平等爲目的</p>
<p>因爲作者明瞭於赤白二帝國主義者的目的同樣的在給予弱小民族以侵略妨害弱小民族的自由生存認爲是最不合理的新聞政策决不是以三民主義立國的我國所應採取的政策所以他肯定地說（我國被困在資本主義和社會主義的新聞政策之垓心其危狀不堪設想除開光大和發揚我們民族主義的新聞政策以外的確無抗强權的法門）並且更這樣誠懇地說（資本主義的新聞政策雖末日爲期不遠然眼前的局面仍受把持於這種勢力的掌握中……我國旣不能自外於（國際之林）我們除利用民族主義的新聞政策以抵抗此兇器外須再審度其情况詳察其機能而思有以芟之之方略這實在是對症下藥的箴言誠看我中華民族的地位是在怎樣的危險狀態之下帝國主義者的武力經濟勢力旣纷至沓來的壓迫加以他們新聞政策的毒素宣傅爲害更烈使國際問的信仰與瞭解全行喪失以至時常吃虧所以公正地宣傅事實眞相的新聞政策實是我國應該亟需建立的應該建立的新聞政策便是杜君指示給我們的民族主義的新聞政策</p>

<p>爲了自已沉醉於新聞記者的夢中當從望平街口走過時往往感到悵然的悲哀雖然聽到有人厭惡剪與刀與漿糊的生活覺得這樣消磨了記者的青春但是我們不曾沉醉於這生活中的人總是這樣的悵然這樣的悵然知道每一種事業必有其技巧除了踱過白石的房子茫然地的望着外什麽也没有熱望過因爲自已知道缺乏這樣的技術</p>
<p>跑過書店看到新聞學著作最多的黃天鵬先生又撰了本『怎樣做一個新聞記者』不厚不厚這使我的夢幻陡然地又起來新聞記者這是多麽值得人眷戀的名詞於是我買了册來這是共分九章的一册書他由新聞記者各方面來探討指示怎樣的做法</p>
<p>『新聞記者只憑了三件法實剪刀漿糊紅筆奮門了幾千載才有今日的位置現在是一枝筆當了三千毛瑟槍了』</p>
<p>這樣的描寫令人憶憬着新聞記者的生活</p>
<p>對於新聞記者的地位作者也叙述得非常切透他說</p>
<p>『新聞記者旣立於第三者的位置唯一的職務在眞確的報告一種事實的發生不必問其性質如何與自已的關係凡爲最多閱者所注意所要知道的事實都應爲忠實的記載大公無私的批評不許有或種作用存於其間因此新聞記者的地位在會社上是超越的在精神上是獨立的在記載上是客觀的『近代我國對於新聞記者的地位尚未認清許多城鎭可以說是尊敬新聞記者實是　怕新聞記者而新聞記者又有一小部濫用其權力——這實是欠明瞭新聞記者責任的緣故</p>
<p>新聞記者要引導民衆趨於正軌自然他自已要有相當的修養他所需要的是健全的身體活潑禮貌的丰度豐富的當識專門的學問冷静的頭腦熱烈的感情敏銳的服光强健的記憶力靈敏的手腕勤勉的習慣交遊的新聞鼻優美的文筆道德的涵養尊嚴的人格這確是新聞記者不能忽略的資格</p>
<p>新聞記者的責任中舉出必不可少的條件而條件中最要的是要親歷『新聞戰塲』對於社會的情形要熟識交游要廣而採訪才易『以及『明瞭正確的事實外浮有新聞的原則』</p>
<p>在本書也並不是偏單的向新聞記苛求要他有相當的資格要他負相當責任要他受相當敎育同時也注意新聞記者的待遇本書中共想出十項爲人格的獨立職業的保障位置的提高公益的設施同業的互助優待的要求法的條文出版的法則保險的預備及其他最後并說『我以上所說的是在一個新聞記者會的講話故大半記者本身爲出發點似乎與資方含有對抗的意味其實不然記者本身有完善的组合在業務必有更大的成績資方能認清這一點是勞資合作的好機會而新聞事業我信必有更大的進步『</p>
<p>正文以外尚有附綠（一）『怎樣做一個新聞讀者』其中詳述爲什麽要閱報怎樣閱報閱報有什麽好處（二）『一個新聞記者的自述『把作者從事新聞記者的生涯整個地映给人間</p>
<p>總之這本書是引導想投身新聞事業的青年以正確途徑同時也只有對新聞學有素養的人才能撰這樣明晰切要的書這是作者最新的貢獻</p>

<p>Hankou - Chiang Kai-shek, accepting the request of the popularly elected representatives from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian, telegraphed an order to all troops to eliminate the Communist bandits within a time limit and not to make hasty transfers.

They made contact with our troops and, after retaking the Hengdian and Xiaofengshan areas, launched a fierce attack in conjunction with the troops defending Tao Hua, finally defeating the bandits and lifting the siege of Tao Hua and Huang'an.

<p>Hankou - He Yingqin and others issued a circular telegram stating (the following is) for the attention of all newspaper offices:</p>
<p>"Recently, a telegram was sent to Mr. Sun Ke of Guangzhou, which read:</p>
<p>'Respectfully addressing Mr. Sun Zhe Sheng (Sun Ke) of Guangzhou: We received the Qincheng telegram and learned that you recently left Nanjing quietly for Shanghai, and now you have resolutely left Shanghai for Guangdong to participate in reactionary activities. We are extremely doubtful and surprised. Before the ninth year of the Republic (1920), you were still studying abroad, and you had not experienced the hardships of the revolution. When the late Premier was alive, some comrades suggested giving you, as a brother, more authority to gain experience. The Premier always said that an inferior horse could not bear a heavy burden, or perhaps it was a humble gesture to avoid giving you cause for complaint. Thinking about it now, we admire the Premier's impartiality and know that no one knows a son better than his father. Moreover, we believe that you are still young in the world, but summarizing your behavior, you are rich in emotion but lack reason, fond of profit but ignorant of righteousness, fickle and without a mind of your own. This is the biggest problem in your life. It has not been ten years since the Premier passed away, and in these past few years, you have sometimes secretly participated in the conspiracy of the Western Hills Conference, lingering in Shanghai without returning; sometimes you have returned to Guangdong to resume your post as the Mayor of Guangzhou, disregarding the Western Hills faction; sometimes you have supported Wang Jingwei, opposing Chiang Kai-shek, relying on the Wuhan government to confront Nanjing; sometimes you have supported Chiang Kai-shek, ousting Wang Jingwei, dividing up the Nanjing Yuan ministries, endlessly repeating and changing, becoming a habit. Therefore, it is not surprising that you have resolutely gone to Guangdong this time, even if it means engaging in counter-revolution. However, the Qin telegram stated that your determination to go to Guangdong was purely because Mr. Hu's freedom could not be restored and your actions were being monitored, forcing you to take this step. Mr. Hu resigned because of differing political views, which is a normal occurrence for politicians in terms of advancement and retreat. There is nothing strange about it. His not leaving Nanjing after resigning is because of the frequent uprisings and the lurking of reactionary forces, fearing that they would hold him hostage and force him to repeat Wang Jingwei's mistake. For the sake of stabilizing the overall situation and preserving Mr. Hu's revolutionary history, it is best to stay in seclusion for the time being. He is not a prisoner and has not lost his freedom. What is the need to restore it? Moreover, although Mr. Hu's case is a matter of individual departure, since he has been ordered by the Party, it is appropriate to seek a solution within the Party. Whether to return to his post or leave Nanjing, the comrades in the Central Government now believe that both are feasible. After we leave Nanjing, will you not be</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>drawn into the vortex of the Guangdong rebellion? Is it really a key to eliminating the Guangdong rebellion? Both sides are in the process of discussing and jointly planning guarantees. You are also one of the people who are running around mediating. Now, suddenly going to Guangdong to incite chaos is like pouring oil on a fire. Then your so-called Hu relief movement has been insincere from the beginning. The attitude in Guangdong is even more perverse and bizarre. Since the two telegrams from Chen and Jiang, all the corrupt and deteriorated reactionary factions have urged you to go to Guangdong to immediately mobilize troops and organize a false government, putting the Hu issue behind them and focusing solely on removing Chiang. It is clear that they are using this as a pretext and have other motives. If they were sincerely loving the Party and their friends, would their actions be like this? We would rather have Hu Gong die for the Party and the country than have the Party and the country die for Hu. If one or two people's gains and losses are used as an excuse to resort to arms at every turn, using any means and disregarding everything to achieve their goals, then how much do you love the rights and positions of individuals, and how little do you love the Party and the country? In the past two months, going back and forth between Nanjing and Shanghai has almost become a weekly routine for you, unimpeded. Meetings, banquets, and outings have not changed. You and your companion have often appeared together in various cinemas and tea dances in Nanjing and Shanghai, which everyone has seen. Now you suddenly say that your actions are being monitored. What exactly are you referring to? If you are not fabricating rumors and listening to ghosts in broad daylight, then if you have been monitored, I am afraid that your so-called quietly leaving Nanjing and resolutely going to Guangdong would have been impossible for a long time. In short, you are the person who advocates the most for mediating the Guangdong crisis. Now you are putting out the fire while setting it. You were also the person who repeatedly advocated for suppressing the rebels in the Central Government. Now you are personally forming a false government with the rebels. You are not afraid of supporting Tang Shaoyi and Wang Jingwei to lead the telegrams denouncing the Central Government, and you are also listed among them. Then what kind of credibility do you have? What kind of personality is left? What kind of people were Tang and Wang? Don't you know? Last year, when the Central Party Headquarters discussed punishing Wang Jingwei, you presided over the denunciation with the most force and emotion. The comrades who attended that day can still recall how you spoke. You also denounced Wang's surrender to the warlords, his loss of conscience, and his inevitable fall into eternal damnation, all because of his desire to be a leader. You also described Wang's lack of participation in important revolutionary work and his various mistakes since the 1911 Revolution in great detail. All of this came from your mouth and was published in the Party history. How long has it been since you picked up Wang Jingwei's leftovers to attack Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, calling him a dictator and slandering him as a public enemy? When you love someone, you put them on your lap; when you hate someone, you throw them into the abyss. You treat state affairs too much like child's play. Tang Shaoyi's personality is even less worth mentioning. After the Xin Chou uprising, he was ordered by Yuan Shikai to go south to negotiate peace and joined our Party, outwardly praising the beauty of supporting the Republic, but secretly colluding with Wang Jingwei and others to mobilize Party cadres and comrades to coerce the Premier into ceding his position to Yuan. The Premier was constrained by public opinion. One wrong move led to a big mistake, which ultimately led to twenty years of internal turmoil in China, and ultimately led to the Premier's inability to personally see the success of the revolution. Who created the crisis? Tang Shaoyi should be held primarily responsible. In the sixth year of the Republic (1917), the Premier led the navy south to protect the Constitution. Tang feigned to follow to Guangdong, but secretly induced the navy to leave the Premier, causing the constitutional movement to fail. In the tenth year of the Republic (1921), the Premier advocated for quickly assuming the extraordinary presidency to complete the Northern Expedition. Tang colluded with Chen Jiongming and mobilized congressmen to oppose the Premier, ultimately causing the Northern Expedition to fail. Later, Chen's conspiracy to harm the Premier was instigated by Tang Shaoyi. All of this has been seen and heard by our Party comrades and is well known to you. Tang is your father's enemy, with whom you cannot live under the same sky. We, upholding the Premier's magnanimity, have not been quick to condemn him in the past, which is enough to cause hidden pain. Now, you respect him as the leader of the false government, push him to lead the telegrams, and let him repeat the disruption of the revolution. Can the Premier's spirit in heaven not weep bitterly? Last year, the false Enlarged Conference pushed Yan Xishan to be the leader, and Wang Jingwei did not hesitate to lower himself and humiliate himself in order to follow the warlords. Critics said that the literati were unscrupulous and had lost all shame. You, who opposed the false Enlarged Conference most vehemently, have also followed in Wang's footsteps, leading Wang as an accomplice. Why have you abandoned yourself to such an extreme? We have heard that you are opposing the Central Government this time, saying that Comrade Chiang Kai-shek is a dictator, using various excuses, but knowing that you are not enough to move the masses, you advocated for a Guangdong Grand Union and the so-called old cadres uniting around the Premier.</p>
<p>We are even more deeply moved by this. The Premier was impartial and loved talent as his life. He treated all believers in the Three People's Principles equally and had no personal prejudices. You, however, are extremely narrow-minded, creating the so-called "Elder Faction" and "Crown Prince Faction," seizing power and excluding people in everything. You want to monopolize the Chinese revolution with a handful of people. In the past, any comrade who wanted to be loyal to the Premier, unless they had the backing of the so-called "old cadres" or obtained their support, would be regarded as unorthodox and subjected to various forms of restriction and sabotage. They would not be allowed to fulfill their mission. This is a common suffering experienced by most comrades and is by no means our personal opinion. It is enough to be a painful memory. Therefore, the biggest divisions in the Party in the past, such as the separation of Sun and Huang and the break between Sun and Chen, were all caused by today's self-proclaimed old cadres inciting and encouraging each other. The world only knows that Chen Jiongming was a traitor who committed heinous crimes against the Premier, but they do not know that the invisible Chen Jiongming, who boasts of being the most loyal comrade, is secretly obstructing the overall plan and undermining the revolution. There are countless such people. Over the years, this has led to disruption and disunity in the Party and fragmentation and division in Guangdong. The Premier must have had unspoken feelings and was unable to personally see the completion of the Northern Expedition and unification. He died in pain, and was it not due to the blessings of the Guangdong provincialism or the old-cadre centralism? General Chiang's ambitions are pure, his hard work is outstanding, and he has been entrusted with the responsibility of the Party and the country in a time of crisis. He has rebuilt the walls and re-raised the banner. In one year, he laid the foundation for Guangdong, and in two years, he unified the country, using the revolutionary military to promote the Three People's Principles. This is different from Muhammad, who held the Koran in his left hand and the sword in his right, relying on strength to preach his doctrine. After this battle, the life of the Party was renewed, the shattered country was rebuilt, and the Premier's legacy was carried on. His spirit did not die. This was due to the joint efforts of the Party comrades, and General Chiang's revolutionary spirit of not avoiding difficulties, not caring about slander, and never giving up was an important factor in achieving this goal. However, in recent years, the so-called old cadres who have followed the Premier have found it difficult to change their nature. Some secretly obstruct the overall plan, some publicly undermine the revolution, some actively conspire to resist, and some actively seek to tear apart and combine. Their actions are fickle and chaotic, and they use every means to cause hardship and setbacks. If General Chiang had not followed the Premier's legacy of cutting the Gordian knot and not dragging his feet, and had not applied the experience accumulated by the Premier over forty years to respond to the situation, the revolutionary cause would have been interrupted long ago, and the Chinese nation would have become communist. Now, you are trying to make General Chiang submit to your demands, follow your lead in everything, and otherwise accuse him of being a dictator and force him to step down and change course, putting the fate of the country at your whim. How ridiculous is this? Are you old cadres so arrogant and domineering that you think it is not enough to mislead the Premier and the Guangdong situation in the past, and now you want to rely on your seniority and family ties to mislead General Chiang and the entire country? All the major policies of the Party and the country are decided by the Party Congress and the National Government Council. If you insist that it is a dictatorship, then what have you been doing for years? General Chiang always submits his proposals to you for public decision. There are countless instances where his proposals have not been approved by you, resulting in delays. The files are there for you to review. It is understandable for outsiders to make irresponsible remarks, but for you to distort the facts is simply too immoral. Alas, Zhe Sheng, eliminating the Communist bandits is a matter of life and death for the Party, the country, and the people. After months of effort by the Central Government, we have already launched a large-scale encirclement, and only failed at the last hurdle. However, your so-called Guangdong Grand Union and old cadre alliance are taking advantage of the Communist Party's cover to seize the opportunity to create chaos in Guangdong, which is also to cover the Communist Party and stir up its dying embers. This is disloyal to the country. We are working hard to open the National Congress and abolish the unequal treaties in accordance with the will of the Premier. Now that the National Congress is being held in the capital, the whole country is united in accepting the Premier's teachings and recognizing the Party's right to govern, giving it legal protection. Negotiations to recover legal rights are also well underway. Before the opening of the National Congress, it was possible to sign an equal treaty, but the sudden turmoil in Guangdong caused suspicion and anxiety at home and abroad, resulting in setbacks and failures. The provisions of the will could not be realized as scheduled, which is unfilial to the Premier. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have repeatedly caused chaos in Guangdong, shedding blood near the suburbs. Wang Jingwei and Zhang Fakui used the Red bandits to create the Guangzhou Incident, causing the people of Guangdong to turn pale at the mention of it and gnash their teeth in hatred. After years of large-scale military suppression, they were gathered in one corner and their main force was crushed. You are now opening the door to welcome robbers and betraying your friends, inviting the Communists back, who have caused the Party years of hard fighting. After unification, Guangdong has been entrusted to the Guangdong comrades for years to manage, with the hope that they can recuperate and compensate for their revolutionary losses. Now, all these efforts have been in vain, and we are about to return to the past of separation and division, using one corner of the country to resist the whole country, and gathering all the corrupt and deteriorated reactionary factions in the country to feed on this corner. The consequences are unimaginable, which is disrespectful to our hometown. How can anyone who is disloyal, unfilial, and disrespectful succeed? You must be participating in this with too little wisdom. Some say that your resolute departure for Guangdong to oppose Chiang is based on various pretexts, but the important motive is purely economic. In the past two or three years, the Ministry of Railways has collected more than 20 million yuan in revenue from various railways. How it is kept and how it is used are all secret, and there is no accounting. You want to leave and turn public funds into private funds. After arriving in Shanghai and understanding the Guangdong crisis, you know that it is enough to affect the market. Then, through your foreign bank, HSBC, you speculated in public bonds. Within a week, you have already earned hundreds of thousands. Regardless of the success or failure of the Guangdong situation, you are already rich. We dare not speculate on a gentleman, but based on past events, your reputation as the Mayor of Guangzhou was bad, and during the Wuhan government era, you swept away hundreds of thousands of yuan from the Ministry of Communications and the remaining funds of the government without reporting and pocketed them. During the Nanjing Special Committee era, you used your authority as the Minister of Finance to withhold a million yuan in treasury bonds that Li Renchao was entitled to receive, demanding a share and still refusing to hand them over. All of this is based on solid evidence and is known to everyone. Therefore, this time's trip south has other purposes. The gossiping mouths may not be without reason. Over the years, the Party and the country have been in turmoil. Every time there is a political change, your pockets are filled. It is almost as if the more chaos there is, the more opportunities you have. This time's Guangdong crisis, you must be resolutely participating and unwilling to let it go easily. This has long been expected by the general public. As you are the only son of the Premier, we respect you very much and want to treat you as we treated the Premier. We do not want to expose your shortcomings and damage your reputation. However, what you have done makes your loved ones sad and your enemies happy. We only hope that those who are sincere will be more critical. We hope that you will understand our foolishness, forgive our bluntness, and make a great wish to continue to mediate so that the situation of peaceful unification will not be disrupted. Then, not only will we love and protect you as before without any grudges, but the people of the world will also be able to understand your mistakes and turn back as soon as possible, put down the butcher knife and become a Buddha. We hope that you will benefit from it. It will be fortunate for the Party and the country. The southern heat is heavy. Please take care of yourself. This urgent telegram is full of grievances and cannot express all that we want to say.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Sino-Japanese Railway Negotiations <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The reason why relations between China and Japan have repeatedly been on the brink of crisis in the past was due to the failed policy of aggression towards China by the previous Japanese cabinet. Some enlightened individuals in Japan often criticized their government, believing that if the policy of aggression was not changed, relations between China and Japan would become more estranged, and Japanese businessmen would be more affected. Therefore, they regarded the government as unwise. The fact that relations between China and Japan have fortunately eased somewhat is not only due to the change in the Japanese government's diplomatic policy towards China, but also due to the early awakening of the Japanese people's diplomacy. Now, in the midst of the global economic downturn, many countries are unable to stabilize, and China and Japan are particularly affected by this trend. Commercial decline is beyond remedy. Therefore, the people of both countries should be conscientious and discard selfish interests to overcome this difficult time together and gradually restore the good conditions of trade between the two countries. This is what sensible people between China and Japan jointly advocate. However, Japanese merchants and residents today, for the sake of the Northeast Railway issue, suddenly disregarded everything and rushed to advance towards Manchuria and Mongolia. According to a Changchun dispatch, Japanese residents in the Northeast have organized a so-called "autonomous alliance" to develop their imperial rights. A World News Agency dispatch also stated that business magnates and warlords have colluded to develop plans for Manchuria and Mongolia, demanding the independence of the South Manchurian Railway's operations. All of this is intended to oppose their government's diplomatic concessions and to quickly achieve the goal of invasion and occupation. They do not know that this railway issue should be judged based on principles of justice. The Chinese people believe that this matter greatly affects China's defense and sovereignty, and they are unanimously paying attention to the outcome of this meeting. If Japanese merchants and residents continue to indulge their ambitions and do not wake up, then the feelings of the people of both countries in the future are unimaginable. It can be said that this is extremely unwise.</p>

<p>The League of Nations Has Many Complex Affairs</p>
<p>Committees will meet 17 times this month. The Coal Mine Working Hours Conference will discuss 7 hours and 45 minutes per day. The director of the Economic Group will publish his opinions on the silver issue. Assisting our country in improving transportation is under study. According to a National News Agency telegram from Geneva on the 1st, the Secretariat of the League of Nations announced today that the League of Nations affairs this month are more complex than ever before. The committees and groups that need to meet are no less than 17. Among them, 6 will be held elsewhere. The Lunar Calendar Reform Preparatory Committee is scheduled to meet on June 8 to prepare for the convening of an international conference in October this year to adopt the new calendar of 13 months per year.</p>
<p>Reuters Geneva, 1st. The Coal Mine Working Hours Conference passed the Coal Mine Working Hours of 7 hours and 45 minutes per day with 13 votes to 15 votes today.</p>
<p>Reuters New York, 1st. The British director of the Economic and Financial Group of the League of Nations, Sulter, spoke at a reception at the Academy of Sciences here today, expressing doubts about the effectiveness of the various proposals currently available for solving the silver price issue. He said that any specialized new plan that has not been clearly determined to be feasible cannot be proposed at the meeting. The methods currently proposed have not yet been implemented. Any agreement to restrict government sales of silver or expand the use of silver in the currency system is aimed at raising the price of silver, but silver mines will therefore not be closed, and will ultimately not last long to fix the price of silver. The move to lend silver to China is also ineffective, and the proposal of a compound currency system is also difficult to expect to succeed. It is even more unfavorable if such a discussion comes from a silver conference rather than a currency conference. Furthermore, if the silver conference cannot achieve its purpose, the world will be disappointed and the price of silver will change more and more. Only the increase in the industrial use of silver and the recovery of world trade can benefit the price of silver. Those who say that the fall in the price of silver is the cause of the widespread commercial depression are actually not correct.</p>
<p>Reuters Geneva, 1st. The League of Nations Committee on Communications and Transit today expressed its satisfaction with the Chinese government's emphasis on cooperation with the Committee. The Committee has begun to study ways to satisfy the Chinese government's desire to improve Chinese waterways and reclaim wasteland. League of Nations Secretary Haas reported to the Committee on his recent visit to China and described in detail the businesses that the Committee can handle in the League of Nations' plan to assist China's reconstruction. He said that China's first need for assistance is the major transportation problems, including preventing the Huai River floods in Henan and Anhui provinces, draining the lakes where the Huai River flows into, and reclaiming the land. China's second need for assistance is the Tianjin area, because the five river mouths are all in this area and are often flooded, causing a large area of land to suffer greatly and urgently needs to be reorganized. The third thing that needs assistance is the improvement of the port of Shanghai. China is willing to have League of Nations experts to undertake the above three projects and plans to organize a technical research institution for public works under the leadership of Chinese officials.</p>

The meeting convened from 9:30 to 11:00. All the bishops of Rome attended. At the same time, rumors were spreading that the Pope intended to resign. This statement is completely unfounded. It is learned that among the matters decided at this meeting, the church's newspaper should stop publishing the Drinking Party's atrocities in order to avoid greater disturbances, but for the Drinking Party's attacks on the Pope, bishops, and pastors, they should do their best to resist. The Pope's attitude was particularly intense, saying that they could put us to death, but they could not prevent our speeches. The Drinking Party's actions are destroying the Treaty of Political and Religious Peace, so we have to protest to the King of Italy. It is even more noteworthy that the Pope's guards have all received sharp weapons, which is a rare situation in the past 60 years. Reuters Rome, 1st.

<p>More Than One Million Voters Participate in the Polls</p>
<p>National News Agency Manila, 2nd. Today, more than one million voters across the Philippines voted to elect central and provincial administrative officials. In addition to the Governor-General, Deputy Governor-General, and Director of the Audit Bureau, who are specially appointed by the US government, and a small number of officials who are selected by the Governor-General, the rest of the Philippine officials are publicly elected by the people every three years. Therefore, the Philippine government is actually in the hands of the Filipinos. In addition, there are 24 Philippine senators who are elected every six years. In addition to the two senators representing the Moro people and the mountain people, who are selected by the Governor-General, half of the remaining 22 senators will be re-elected. There are 91 members of the House of Representatives who are elected every three years. In addition to the eight members selected by the Governor-General, the remaining 83 members will also be re-elected in this election. All people over the age of 21 who are literate have the right to vote, and those who are illiterate but have property worth more than 500 pesos also have the right to vote. Although women do not have the right to participate in politics, the movement is very strong at present. The election, like the election in the United States, will take secret votes. A new political party called the Radical Party was formed in the last election. At present, its strength is growing daily and it should be able to win several seats this year. The election competition has always been between the majority party, the Nationalist Party, and the minority party, the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>National News Agency Cairo, 2nd. The Egyptian new parliament completed the repeat election last night. The current government party occupies 123 seats out of 150 seats in the House of Representatives. However, it is not surprising that this result was obtained by using tyrannical methods to force those who did not want to vote to vote. The strength of the opposition party has not been shaken, so the government's opinion is that the election results cannot be considered a government victory.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Guangzhou Consecutive Bombing Cases <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Destroyed the Provincial Government's Right Side Perimeter Wall</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Following the explosion at the gunpowder depot, the "Central Pillar," in Guangdong Province, two bomb cases occurred in the city on the evenings of May 25th and 26th. On the 25th, at 9:00 PM and 9:50 PM, respectively, there were two loud explosions originating near Central Park. Less than ten minutes separated the blasts. As a result, residents on Desheng, Hui'ai, Yuehua, Guangda, Guangwei, and other roads near Central Park closed their doors early, and shops immediately ceased night market activities. After investigation, it was discovered that the bombs were thrown under the perimeter wall on the right side of the Provincial Government on Jixiang Road. The opposite side of the wall is Hou Lou Fang (street name), which is connected in all directions. Therefore, after the explosion, the bomber escaped from an unknown location and could not be apprehended. Yuan, the director of the Desheng Police Sub-bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately led a large contingent of armed police to investigate. Simultaneously, the Public Security Bureau and the Military Police Command also dispatched teams to search for suspects in the vicinity. The military police guarding the Provincial Government also dispatched sentries that evening to prevent any accidents. That evening, all members of the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters were holding a public banquet for military and political figures at the Provincial Party Headquarters in Dadongmen. Chen Jitang, upon hearing the news, immediately instructed Military Police Commander Lin Shiqing and Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Qingyun to dispatch teams to investigate strictly. However, before the cause of this case could be determined, two more explosions occurred on Changdi Jiulixiang Heng Street at approximately 9:00 PM the following evening (May 26th). The left side of the street entrance is the former headquarters of the Sixty-third Division, and the right side is the National Garden Hall. The destructive power of the bombs there was less than that of the bombs on the 25th. The bombs on the 25th destroyed a section of the perimeter wall on the right side of the Provincial Government and penetrated the ground to a depth of about three feet. The bombs on Jiulixiang Heng Street did not destroy anything. (May 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Lu Dipin Returns to Jiangxi from Nanjing <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Lu States That the Jiangxi Bandits Have Not Been Eliminated, and the Troops Will Not Be Transferred Elsewhere. There Are Methods for Post-War Rehabilitation and Financial Relief in the Bandit Areas.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Route Army, went to Nanjing last month to attend the National Assembly and to negotiate with the central government regarding post-war rehabilitation, financial relief in the bandit areas, and future steps in suppressing the bandits. Lu believed that all matters had been settled, and since the province was in the midst of bandit suppression, it was necessary to return to the province to preside over military and political affairs. He took a boat back to Jiangxi from Nanjing on the 28th, and arrived in the province at 12:00 PM on the 30th via the Nanchang-Xun Railway special train from Xunyang. At that time, Wang , representative of Minister He, the two Department Heads, Cao, the Deputy Adjutant of the Ninth Route Army Headquarters, and representatives of various organization leaders and groups were all at Niuhang Station to welcome him. From Niuhang Station to the Provincial Government, along the Jiangzhongshan and Deshenglu areas, the Eighteenth Division, the Fifty-second Division, the Second Provincial Security Regiment, and the Provincial Security Team increased patrols for protection. After Lu crossed the river with the welcoming party, he took a car to the military camp to meet with Minister He, reported on the situation in Nanjing, and discussed the methods determined by the central government for future bandit suppression. After about an hour of discussion, he left and went to the Provincial Government, where all the members of the Provincial Government were waiting. Lu spoke to the government members, saying that he had been in charge of Jiangxi's administration for two years without any success, and the disturbances caused by the communists made it impossible to carry out any construction. Therefore, he had requested to resign from the central government during this trip to Nanjing. The central government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek encouraged him to work together during these difficult times and to fulfill his responsibilities as a party member. He had no choice but to return to Jiangxi to preside over the administration. The central government paid great attention to the bandit problem in the province and decided to devote all its efforts to eliminate Zhu Mao and other communist bandits in the shortest possible time according to the established plan. Because the communist bandits not only endanger the party and the country, but also endanger world security. Before all the bandit factions are eliminated, the troops will only be increased and never reduced or transferred elsewhere. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has consistently stated that the suppression of bandits in the province will not be affected by the Guangdong affair. After the Chen Jiang telegram was issued in Guangdong, the central government consistently advocated leniency in the hope that they would repent. If Chen Jitang and others insisted on reopening the war, causing suffering to the people and creating opportunities for the communist bandits, then the central government would quickly eliminate them. In addition, the central government approved the issuance of post-war public bonds, subsidies for administrative expenses and disaster relief, and exemptions from bearing the costs of grain and allowances for the suppression of bandits, all of which had satisfactory results. The newly appointed Director of Finance, Yang Mianzhong (formerly Secretary-General of the Provincial Government), has recently been in Nanjing negotiating with Finance Minister Song Ziwen regarding the province's relief finance and all post-war matters, and will return to the province to take office in the next day or two. After leaving the Provincial Government, Lu went to the Twenty-eighth Division's garrison to comfort Commander Gong and inquire about the battles of Donggu and Futian and the recent situation on the front lines. Gong has already gone to Nanjing from the province on the 31st to report to Chiang Kai-shek on the progress of bandit suppression in Jiangxi and to request instructions. (June 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e39">Jin Army Representative Liu Zhuoqing Arrives in Kaifeng <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Liu Claims That Feng Yuxiang Is Still in Quwo and Has Not Gone Elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Jin Military and Political Authorities Have No Need to Ally with Feng.</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Jin generals recently issued a joint telegram led by Shang Zhen regarding the Guangdong affair, expressing their attitude. Recently, they also sent representative Liu Zhuoqing to Henan to discuss ways to work together with Liu Zhi, the Director of the Expeditionary Headquarters. Liu arrived in Kaifeng on the 22nd and stayed at the Party, Government, and Military Recreation Club. According to his remarks, his mission was to express the sincerity of the Jin generals in supporting the central government. The fact that Feng Yuxiang went to Jinci was because Jinci is only thirty miles away from Taiyuan. Feng is extremely cautious and would never take risks lightly. In the past, the Jin army sent a regiment to Fenyang, which caused a big misunderstanding, showing that Feng has very little courage. Moreover, Feng is currently without people or money and is not a central figure. Although they cooperated once last year, Feng did not have a deep history with the Jin government and military authorities, so the Jin army has no need to ally with Feng. If Feng has important matters to discuss with the Jin provincial authorities, he can send a representative, why go there himself? If Feng ran to Jinci, wouldn't he be digging his own grave? Today's Jin province is under the rule of Commanders-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang. The looting and riots by Feng's troops in southern Jin may not have been Feng's troops, but bandits using his name. First, Feng borrowed 30,000 yuan from Fenyang, but the local authorities did not give it, so twelve companies of soldiers rioted, followed by a platoon. However, Feng and his subordinates do not admit it. The so-called Feng troops now are only the Song and Pang armies. Pang originally belonged to Sun Yue and was not a direct descendant. The two have unspeakable secrets about Feng. Feng himself is still in Quwo, saying that he has gone to Jiangxian, Jinci, and Wutai are not accurate. The Feng troops are stationed in Quwo, Yicheng, Gaoping, Fenyang, Qinxian, a total of six or seven counties. Sun Dianying's troops are near Yuncheng. The current difficulty in Jin province lies in military expenses. The total military expenses are about 7 million yuan per month. (May 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Jiaoji Railway Coal Merchants Resume Transportation <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Still Implemented According to the Ministry's Approved Freight Rate</p>
<p>Temporarily Give Coal Merchants a 20% Rebate</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The coal merchants' strike in Boshan and Zichuan has lasted for ten days. Yesterday, more than twenty small coal merchants at the mines, unable to withstand the losses of the strike, planned to load cars and resume operations, but were dispersed by crowds from the Coal Industry Association's Children's School in the strike group. Operations are still suspended today. Ge Guangting, the Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, went to Nanjing to request instructions on the issues of increased freight rates and Jiaoji Railway interest. He arrived in Jinan from Nanjing at 7:30 PM today (21st). When a reporter interviewed him on the train, he said that since the implementation of the Jiaoji Railway's increased freight rates, there has been a coal merchants' strike. The provincial government suspects that the railway is acting too aggressively. In fact, this case was handled in accordance with the ministry's orders. How dare the railway increase prices without authorization? Currently, the Ministry of Railways' attitude is to blame the former Director of Business for the responsibility of increasing prices. It seems that freight rates can be slightly reduced. To what extent they can be reduced is not yet known, but the ministry's orders are difficult to retract, which is quite hesitant. The Jiaoji Railway's debt to Japanese interest cannot be paid due to the sharp rise in gold prices. This is also one of the tasks of my trip to Nanjing. Because if we pay such a huge amount of interest, the railway's expenses will not be sustainable. Therefore, we asked the Ministry of Railways for additional subsidies. Although the ministry agreed to our request, whether it can subsidize us under the current central government situation is still a question. According to Tan Shukui, the Director of the Jiaoji Railway's Car Affairs Office, since the coal merchants' strike, the provincial government has been concerned about its impact on local order and people's livelihood. It has consulted with the railway authorities several times to find a solution. Because the price increase was approved by the National Government Council and the Ministry of Railways' orders, the railway did not dare to act without authorization. Chairman Han Fuju and Wang Fangting, the Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, both intended to first order the coal merchants to resume operations and then refund the amount after the price reduction was approved, but the coal merchants refused, so there was no solution. Chairman Han and Director Wang are now advocating stabilizing coal prices, stipulating the price of coal at the mines and the freight rate fairly, and prohibiting market prices from being raised and hoarding. This matter will be resolved simultaneously with the freight rate issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this evening (31st) at 7:00 PM, we received a continuation call from Ge Guangting, the Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, stating that the coal mines will resume operations from June 1st. The method is to temporarily give the coal mines a 20% rebate on the current freight rate, and the railway bureau will actually receive 80% in cash. In this way, the ministry's orders can be maintained, and the coal mines' demands have also been achieved. (May 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e41">The Business Community in Beiping and Tianjin Strongly Opposes the Production and Sales Tax <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Wang Shuchang Goes to Beiping to Request Instructions from Zhang Xueliang</p>
<p>The Beiping Chamber of Commerce Prepares for a City-Wide Strike</p>
<p>The Production and Sales Tax Bureau Actually Implements Confiscation of Goods</p>
<p>The Special Commissioner's Office of Finance Declares That It Is Not Extortion</p>
<p>The Tianjin business community, due to its opposition to the production and sales tax, previously sent Wang Wendian to Beiping to meet with Zhang Xueliang to present everything. Wang returned to Tianjin on the evening of the 28th because he did not get to see Zhang. On the morning of the 29th, he accompanied Zhang Pintai, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to meet with Wang Shuchang, the Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, who personally received them. Zhang Pintai stated that after the abolition of likin, the production and sales tax was added, which is more harmful than likin, and other provinces do not have this tax. The National Government also has no orders to implement this tax, nor has it been approved by the provincial government. If it is not abolished, merchants can only suspend business. Wang agreed to go to Beiping that night to report to Zhang Xueliang and request instructions. In the afternoon, Zhang Pintai convened a meeting of representatives from various trades in the Chamber of Commerce to report on the results of the meeting with Wang. After discussion, it was decided to send Wang Wendian to Nanjing and Zhang Pintai to Beiping to appeal separately. If they are not accepted, they will implement the second step of a city-wide strike movement in conjunction with various counties and cities. It was also decided that on the morning of the 30th, representatives would go to the Municipal Readjustment Committee to meet with Liu Butong to ask him to help find a solution, and also submit a report to the Department of Industry to appeal. However, the tax bureau, due to the merchants' refusal to pay taxes, ordered the confiscation of goods in order to force the merchants to yield. The confiscation of goods has been relentless for days. On the 29th, Yongjufeng, a shop in Xincheng Chaha Ji, entrusted Wang, a boatman, to purchase nine small coarse porcelain jars worth nine yuan. They were confiscated by tax bureau patrol officers at Ganqiao in Beiyingmen. After negotiations, a fine of two yuan was paid before they were released.</p>
<p>The opposition to the production and sales tax in the Beiping business community is intensifying. The tax bureau has also been ordered to confiscate goods and levy taxes, which has further provoked opposition from the business community, and has requested the Special Commissioner's Office of Finance to return the confiscated goods, otherwise they will implement a strike. The office had no choice but to approve a temporary suspension of collection from May 30th and return the confiscated goods. However, as of 3-4 PM on the 30th, goods were still not allowed to enter the city through Fuchengmen, Andingmen, and Guang'anmen. It was reported that the hides detained in Changxindian had not yet been returned. The Fengtai Transportation Industry Association reported that 60-70 trucks of goods detained by the association had not been returned, or may be returned today (31st). The representatives of various trades in Beiping, who had previously petitioned, gathered again at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 30th, with 500 people going to the Chamber of Commerce for a temporary representative meeting. Chairman Leng Jiaji and various representatives spoke at length, their expressions were very excited, saying that Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang has always protected the merchants, and this production and sales tax is definitely not Vice Commander Zhang's own intention, but purely the initiative of a certain person. We should die and oppose it, and some even proposed building a bronze statue for a certain person. Finally, it was decided that if the production and sales tax cannot be cancelled before June 2nd, all the shops in the city will strike on the 3rd. In addition, Gao Ziliang, Yang Jixian, Sun Kuifu, and Zou Quansun were appointed to go to Zhang's residence in Xinjian Hutong at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th to petition and visit Jing Youyan, the Special Commissioner of Finance, and ask him to quickly return the confiscated goods. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 PM. Gao and others first went to the Special Commissioner's Office of Finance at 4:00 PM. Jing stated that the confiscated goods would be returned immediately. The representatives then went to Xinjian Hutong, but because Zhang was still ill, Zhu Guangmu received them on his behalf. The representatives expressed their eagerness to meet with the Vice Commander. Zhu stated that Zhang was not fully recovered and asked the representatives to visit Ji Yiqiao, the Chief of Staff of the headquarters, first. The representatives then left. According to a letter from the Joss Stick and Traditional Medicine Guild to the Chamber of Commerce, Wanxing Incense Factory transported elm noodles from Pingxi by camel, and when they arrived at Changxindian, the tax bureau ordered them to pay a tax of 17 yuan per thousand catties. According to the old regulations, the tax was 8 jiao per thousand catties, but now it has exceeded 20 times, which is really unbearable. In addition, the Xingtai Chamber of Commerce sent representatives Liu Xiangqing, Yang Yunlong, and Jia Zhao to Beiping yesterday to cancel the production and sales tax. According to their remarks, the tax bureau ordered a person carrying two dou of soybeans into the city to pay a tax of 1 yuan and 2 jiao. The severity of this tax can be seen.</p>
<p>The Hebei Finance Special Commissioner's Office issued a statement regarding the telegram sent to Vice Commander Zhang by the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 29th: After reading the reports published in Beiping and Tianjin newspapers on the 29th of this month, the various statements made by Leng Jiaji, the Chairman of the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others in the telegram to Vice Commander Zhang regarding the production and sales tax implemented by the office under orders are deeply regrettable. The telegram stated that the production and sales tax exceeds the Chongguan tax by more than ten or twenty times. I don't know that the Chongguan tax is a unique and harsh tax in Beiping. The merits and demerits of the production and sales tax have been explained in detail by the office in Beiping and Tianjin newspapers on the same day. How can they be compared? Even the tax rates cited in the telegram contain many inaccuracies. For example, for lambskin, the production and sales tax schedule in Appendix 1 states that raw and cooked lambskins from Mongolia, Shunde, and other places are taxed at 8 fen or 1 jiao 4 li per skin, which is 8 yuan or 10 yuan and 4 jiao per hundred skins. Only Tibetan Daying lambskins, which are luxury goods, have a higher tax rate. How can it be collectively referred to as 21 yuan per hundred skins? Also, for cat skin, the same table states that the tax is 1 fen 6 li 5 per flowered cat skin and 3 fen 3 li per black and white dyed cat skin. How can it be falsely claimed that the tax is 4 fen per skin? Comparing it with the Chongguan tax, although the tax rate for luxury goods is occasionally increased, there has never been an increase of more than ten or twenty times. The fish tax, although it existed in the Chongguan tax, has been completely exempted from the production and sales tax. It is even more unknown what the basis is for the telegram's claim that the tax is now 4 yuan and 8 jiao. This is very surprising. From these various points, it can be seen that the merchants have not researched the production and sales tax rates at all, and the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce has not carefully examined them before forwarding them in accordance with the regulations. It is not necessary to delve into the fact that the office is acting under orders, but such unfounded rumors and sensationalism not only affect tax revenue, but also fear that they will lead to misunderstandings that harm public order, thereby delaying important political affairs. Who will bear the blame? In short, the country cannot stop government affairs for a day, and it cannot stop tax collection for a day. Extortion is certainly wrong, but can resistance be said to be right? Under the current financial situation in Hebei, even if the production and sales tax is cancelled as the merchants wish, what method will be used to compensate for the insufficient military and administrative expenses after the abolition of likin? Although the positions of government officials and the people are different, understanding should be consistent. Mutual tolerance and assistance are necessary to achieve success. As for the claim that willow coffins are taxed at 7% and yellow earth handcarts are taxed at 1 jiao 5 fen, if this is true, it is the illegal extortion of the collecting officials. It is hoped that the victimized merchants will report the evidence to the office by name. Once verified, they will be punished according to the law and will not be tolerated as a warning to other lawbreakers. It is also hoped that the chambers of commerce in various places will report any illegal behavior of the collecting officials of each bureau at any time, openly or secretly, without any concealment, to assist the office in handling this matter. The original intention of the office in implementing this production and sales tax is sincerely hoped that the business community will understand. (May 31st)</p>

<p>Japanese Residents in Northeast China Organize an Autonomous League</p>
<p>Merchants and Warlords Collude to Promote Independence</p>
<p>All Want to Oppose Railway Negotiations and Concessions</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Japanese residents along the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), led by Mr. Kimura, have been meeting in Liaoning for many days to discuss railway negotiations, but there has been no progress. They are deeply concerned about the threat to their imperial rights, so they specifically initiated a Northeast Japanese Residents' Representative Conference. The conference was held in Shenyang on the 22nd of this month, and 52 representatives from various regions attended. They deliberated for several days until the 24th, when they decided to organize the All Manchuria Japanese Autonomous League to solicit members and formulate rules. Japanese residents in various regions sent telegrams to join the league upon hearing the news, and there are already more than 400 members. The ten articles of the league's constitution are as follows: Article 1: This league is named the All Manchuria Japanese Autonomous League. This league is located in Fengtian, and other branches are located in various places. Article 2: The purpose of this league is to maintain imperial rights and develop the Japanese nation. Article 3: Japanese residents in Manchuria who agree with the purpose of the preceding article shall organize this league. Article 4: In order to achieve the purpose of Article 2, all necessary tasks must be carried out. Article 5: This league shall have the following officers with a term of one year. Article 6: There shall be one director, several standing directors, and several directors. Each region shall have one branch director. Article 7: Directors shall be elected by the general meeting, standing directors shall be elected by the officers' meeting, and branch directors shall be elected by the branches. Article 8: The officers' meeting shall be composed of the director, directors, standing directors, and branch directors. Article 9: The tasks of this league shall be decided by the officers' meeting and implemented by the directors. Article 10: The expenses shall be donated by league members and other parties. Mr. Ueda, the representative of the Japanese residents in Shenyang, was elected as the director. The passed resolutions were: (1) If the Chinese loan railway does not pay the principal and interest, it shall be forcibly executed or its railway shall be taken over. (2) Remove the intersections with the Beining Railway. (3) Suspend the joint operation of the Datong Railway. (The above resolutions were sent to Mr. Kimura to be proposed at the current railway conference.) (4) Oppose China's abolition of consular jurisdiction. (5) If Mr. Kimura's negotiations fail, the government must take decisive measures regarding Manchuria's railway rights. (6) Oppose Shidehara's diplomatic policy against public opinion. (7) Oppose China's collection of five import taxes on Japanese goods, such as cotton yarn, flour, matches, and tobacco. (The above was submitted to the government by Mr. Yoshida, the Director of the Fanyang Chamber of Commerce in Nanjing, upon his arrival in Tokyo.) It was also decided to notify the results of this conference to Japanese residents in various regions to pay attention and solicit Japanese residents in various regions to join the league to expand its influence. It can also be seen that the Japanese residents' ambitions are rampant. Our countrymen should not ignore it.</p>
<p>According to the World News Agency in Tokyo, recently the voices of our country abolishing consular jurisdiction have been rising, and the National Assembly has announced the denial of all unequal treaties to show our country's greatest determination to abolish treaties. Our closest neighbor, Japan, is paying close attention to this. Those who are slightly aware of the times are all discussing goodwill, while the military and commercial warlords in China are colluding with each other to actively oppose diplomatic concessions to China. The All Japan Chamber of Commerce has even resolved to petition the government on three items: opposing the abolition of consular jurisdiction and supporting Manchuria and Mongolia's rights and interests. The most powerful force in opposing diplomatic concessions to China is the South Manchuria Railway Company (SMR). It is currently conducting the Northeast Railway negotiations. The intentions of Sima Zhao are known to everyone. On the other hand, it is also trying to plan the so-called Manchuria and Mongolia development plan centered on the SMR. Its meaning is that if the Northeast authorities do not recognize the right to lay five major railways, then it plans to focus on operating the SMR to control Manchuria and Mongolia's rights and interests. Recently, the SMR has been demanding the independence of the SMR's operations from the government authorities in Tokyo. The so-called independence does not mean that it is not subject to government control, but that it does not change with the change of government. As for economic policies, it is also exempt from being controlled by government authorities. In the future, it plans to establish a supreme council to recruit former SMR presidents and powerful figures from the private sector to give the agency the power to decide on the president and operating policies. Regarding this proposal, SMR executives such as Muno Shigekuro, Yamakawa Duofu, and Nakagawa Masa left one after another to return to Japan to contact the authorities.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau was reorganized into the Highway Administration Bureau and was established on the 1st of this month. The Department of Construction appointed Huang as Director. All road maintenance stations on each section are planned to be abolished to save expenses. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Light Railway, starting from the Bian Yong River to the Jianshan section, is divided into four stations and opened to traffic on the 1st of this month, selling tickets. Passengers are very enthusiastic due to the low fares. There were two round trips on that day, and the business statistics were about 800 yuan. It is also learned that the bureau plans to add another round trip after a ten-day trial run. The ticket prices are: Riverside to Xiaoshan: 2nd class 3 jiao, 3rd class 1 jiao 5 fen; to Linpu: 2nd class 7 jiao, 3rd class 3 jiao 5 fen; to Jianshan: 2nd class 1 yuan, 3rd class 5 jiao. Xiaoshan to Linpu: 2nd class 5 jiao, 3rd class 2 jiao 5 fen. Linpu to Jianshan: 2nd class 3 jiao, 3rd class 1 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<p>The Department of Construction previously issued a notice to each county government to establish farmers' banks. The number of those established is very small, all due to the difficulty in raising funds. Director Shi specially formulated a method that the minimum amount of funds is 50,000 yuan, each share is set at 10 yuan, for a total of 5,000 shares. Each county magistrate will solicit donations from wealthy and prominent merchants in the local area. Once the capital is fully collected, various regulations for the farmers' bank will be drafted and submitted to the department for review and implementation.</p>
<p>After Wu Qiding took office as the Director of the Zhejiang Stamped Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, he reorganized all the branch bureaus and abolished the brand tax collected by each county from the tobacco and alcohol shops from May.</p>
<p>The Department of Construction promotes agriculture and is now planning to pilot public rice seedling fields to benefit farmers. It is heard that the method will be piloted by the agricultural improvement stations and agricultural cooperation experimental areas in each county, and farmers in the villages will be encouraged to widely publicize it.

It Was Once Planned to Open a Sanitation Office and Implement Methods for Excrement Removal Similar to Those in Shanghai to Eliminate Open-Air Latrines and Emphasize Sanitation. Previously, Regulations Were Drafted and Submitted to the Provincial Department for Review. Later, Because the Plan Divided the Town and Countryside into Five Roads, It Was Inevitable That the Excrement Merchants Would Dominate. Therefore, the County Public Security Bureau Jointly Planned, Taking Everything into Account. After Careful Discussion by the Town and Countryside Health Movement Committee, the Simple Regulations Were Revised and Submitted to the Provincial Department for Review. Recently, an Instruction Was Received from the Department of Civil Affairs Stating That Since the Party Has Repeatedly Reviewed the Plan and Taken Everything into Account, It Should Be Approved as Planned. After Receiving the Document, the Public Security Bureau and the First District Office Decided That, in Addition to Discussing Implementation Methods at the First District Office on June 5th, the Towns and Police Under the Jurisdiction of the First District Office Should Order the Excrement Collectors in the Area to Go to the Office for Instructions in Order to Undertake This Task. This Will Greatly Benefit the Future of Public Health.</p>

<p>The Construction Bureau Ordered the Demolition of Dangerous Buildings. Qian Tianpeng, the Director of the Construction Bureau, was aware that after the collapse of a wall in the New Suzhou Hotel in Beiju内 due to the unloading of soil by a Cheng family, a life was lost. Because the buildings of the Tianyi Chi Bathhouse in Yangshuli outside Yanmen Gate were dilapidated and about to collapse, causing great disasters, he ordered technicians and workers to go to Tianyi Chi yesterday (2nd) to forcibly demolish and rebuild it. The owner of Tianyi Chi had no choice but to suspend business and rebuild. The Lin Gong Memorial Stele Was Completed.

<p>A Boy Bitten to Death by a Loach: Zhao Genfu, a cook by trade and resident of Houqi Street outside the North Gate, had an eight-year-old son named A'er. Recently, a neighbor, Mr. Jia, dug up a gray pond in the field and caught three loaches, keeping them in a water tank. The other day, the child went to the neighbor's house and leaned against the tank to play with water. Unexpectedly, the loaches were disturbed and began to swim wildly. One of the loaches, fiery yellow in color, suddenly leaped out of the tank and bit A'er fiercely on the back of his foot. Immediately, fresh blood flowed, and he fell to the ground in pain. His father, Genfu, noticed and rushed him to Dr. Zhou Shinong Tan Shumo's clinic for treatment. However, the poison was too deep, and treatment was ineffective. He died from the poison yesterday, a truly tragic event. It is rumored that what Mr. Jia caught was not a loach but a red-banded snake. Therefore, A'er was bitten to death. Zhao Genfu plans to negotiate with Mr. Jia.</p>
<p>A Strange Homicide in Lixiang: Li Zhilin, a farmer from Lixiang, the 142nd Tu of the 16th District of this county, is 19 years old. In February of this year, he married Ms. Han, the daughter of Gong Gentang, through a matchmaker. After she entered his home, their relationship was not harmonious. On the night of April 6th of the lunar calendar, Ms. Gong stole a Gengtie (marriage certificate), eight paper sheets of field deeds, and gold and silver jewelry and fled. Her husband, upon learning this, went to his father-in-law's house to search for her but could not find her. On the 10th, her brother, A'quan, found her and brought her back, but she only returned six sheets of field deeds. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 15th, Ms. Gong suddenly fled again. Her husband searched everywhere but could not find her. The next afternoon, Ms. Gong's body was suddenly discovered in the Banyebang River. Zhilin, upon learning this, was about to report it to the county court for an autopsy. However, his father-in-law, Gong Gentang, had also learned of his daughter's tragic death and led his relatives to retrieve the body and carry it to his son-in-law's house, damaging the house in the process. Yesterday (the 2nd), Li Zhilin reported the incident to the county court. At the same time, the Tu Zheng (local head) of the area, Kuang Bo'an, also reported to the court. However, local gossip suggests that Ms. Gong was murdered by her husband. After receiving the report, the county court had Prosecutor Zhu open a court session for interrogation and ordered an official to go to the countryside today for an autopsy to gather evidence.</p>
<p>Robbery and Murder by Bandits: Zhang Gengquan, a farmer in the Beizhou Lane area of the 495th Tu of the Daidian Township in the 7th District of this county, had his new house robbed in November of last year, resulting in a loss of over 200 yuan. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 1st) at around 1:00 AM, more than ten bandits, speaking in a strong northern accent, with white cloths wrapped around their heads and carrying flashlights, sharp knives, wooden sticks, and other weapons, opened the gate of the old house. Five bandits entered to search for valuables, while the rest stood guard outside, forcing Gengquan to reveal the location of his hidden silver. Gengquan, claiming that there was no silver in the house, angered the bandits, who hung him from the beam inside the gate and beat him severely. Because Gengquan had no silver to reveal, the bandits became even more enraged and stabbed him in the Tianmen acupoint on his head with a sharp knife, causing him to bleed profusely. Because they found nothing, the bandits took two dou of white rice, thirty ducks, and some scattered clothing and fled. Zhang's sons, A'da and A'lin, learned of the incident at the new house and rushed to save their father from the beam, but he had already died from his injuries. The next day, the Tu Zheng of the area, Lu Yongru, came to the city to report to the county court. Prosecutor Zhu opened a court session for interrogation and decided to go to the countryside today for an autopsy to gather evidence for the arrest and prosecution of the criminals.</p>
<p>Boy Injured by Exploding Ammunition: Huang Rongrui, a villager in Qianqiao Town (Kaiyuanxiang) in the 4th District, is a farmer by trade and raises several oxen for plowing, so he hired a shepherd boy named Lu Hongsheng, who is 14 years old. The other day, early in the morning, Lu Hongsheng returned home after herding the cattle and went to the field to work with a hoe. Unexpectedly, there was a piece of ammunition left over from the Jiazi War (Sino-Japanese War) in the field. It was struck by the iron hoe, and with a loud bang, it exploded, sending shrapnel flying. The shrapnel pierced Hongsheng's left knee, causing blood and flesh to splatter. He collapsed in extreme pain and lost consciousness. Passersby noticed and reported it to his master, who sent the injured boy to Tongren Hospital in the city for treatment. According to the hospital doctor, the knee bone has been shattered, and he may become disabled.</p>
<p>Construction Industry Requests Exemption from Business Tax: The Wuxi Construction Industry Association, with the impending imposition of business tax and the letter from the County Chamber of Commerce urging them to quickly send responsible representatives to negotiate the tax amount with the Business Tax Bureau, convened a meeting of all members to discuss. They all agreed that the construction industry is a labor-intensive industry and should not be subject to business tax. The bricks, tiles, and wood used in building houses are all subject to business tax paid by the respective merchants. Contractors only purchase on behalf of employers and have no profit to gain. Their actual income is only a small profit from the contracting work. If the total amount of wages is used as the basis for the business tax, it will not only cause an uproar among the workers, but it will also violate the government's intention to protect workers. If business tax is levied on the purchase of materials, it would be redundant and truly oppressive. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Chamber of Commerce requesting that it be forwarded to the Business Tax Bureau and submitted to the Provincial Government requesting exemption from business tax.</p>

<p>Order from the Provincial Government: Magistrate of Jingjiang County to Postpone Relinquishing Office: The former magistrate Li Leng of Jingjiang County, after receiving an order from the Civil Affairs Department to be transferred to the position of Magistrate of Jingjiang County, handed over his duties on the 23rd and then went to Jiading and Wujin. He was originally scheduled to go to Jingjiang yesterday (the 1st) to take up his new post. However, Magistrate Wang Jiwu of Jingjiang County received a telegram from the Civil Affairs Department, No. 637, on the 30th of last month, ordering the magistrate to postpone relinquishing office and await further instructions. Magistrate Wang immediately complied with the order. It is rumored that the reason is that Li Leng has been accused of opium bribery, and the local court has scheduled a hearing for the 15th, requiring the summons of the relevant individuals Huang Bingying, Qian Zuopeng, Hu A'yu, Chen Xiangbao, Wu Shanshi, and the editor of the Cheng Qing Party newspaper, Jiang Sheng, Wang Sengru, for interrogation. In addition, Huang Bingying's case of alleged defamation has been approved for transfer of jurisdiction to the Higher Court, with the first instance to be tried by the Wuxi court.</p>

<p>Director of Wounded Soldiers Factory Explains Misunderstanding: The 11th Division stationed in Hankou has sent Zhuang Mingyuan to be the director of the Nantong Wounded Soldiers Factory. The first batch of 84 wounded soldiers has arrived. All sectors of the local community, having previously suffered from the pain caused by wounded soldiers, unanimously oppose the factory. At 8:00 PM on the 31st, Director Zhuang hosted a reception for all sectors of the community at the Nantong Club to explain the misunderstanding. He also stated that he would accommodate local public opinion and submit a report to the General Headquarters and Commander Luo. Currently, officers and soldiers are waiting in Nantong for orders. Representatives from all sectors of the community gave speeches, stating that the local area's fear of the term "wounded soldiers" has caused a misunderstanding and that there are no other intentions.</p>

<p>Chief of Police Enters Home at Night, Killing Housewife: Zhou Deshu of Wuliu, west of Meinihu, Lugang District, Rugao, owns more than 200 mu of fertile land and can be considered wealthy in the area. His wife, Zhang, is 34 years old. At approximately 9:00 PM on the 28th, Xu, the patrol captain of the 15th branch of the district's Public Security Bureau, along with five patrolmen including Li Hanzhang, dressed in military uniforms and plain clothes, carrying weapons, arrived at Zhou's house. Zhou's family was not yet asleep and heard someone knocking on the door. Zhou's wife, Zhang, fearing they were bandits, refused to open the door and told her husband to guard the windows. Seeing that no one was opening the door, the police chief and others opened fire on the door. One bullet flew through and struck Zhang in the head, shattering her skull and killing her instantly. The police chief and others then used wooden sticks to break down the door and searched the house with flashlights. Seeing Zhang lying in a pool of blood, they realized they had caused trouble and fled. Afterwards, Zhou went to the branch bureau to report the incident. Chief Shu immediately placed the five perpetrators under surveillance and reported the matter to the county bureau. After receiving the report, Chief Wang sent Inspector Qiu Bogao to the area to investigate and ordered the five perpetrators to be taken to the city for interrogation.</p>

<p>Courier for Riot Suppression Bureau Flees with Funds: Li Guisheng, a courier for the Xiaoshan County Riot Suppression Bureau, was introduced by Chen Fulin, a worker at the county government. On the 28th, he was sent to Heshangdian to deliver official documents. The county government ordered him to send 50 yuan in local self-government donations to the No. 3 district public office for verification. Unexpectedly, the courier fled with the funds. The county government was initially unaware of this until yesterday, when it received a letter from the courier stating that the money had been lost and he could not compensate for it. In addition to issuing an arrest warrant, the county government is requiring the guarantor to compensate for the funds.</p>
<p>Abduction of a Woman S Sentenced to Imprisonment: Zhang Xiudai, who abducted a woman and was arrested at the No. 1 Hotel in the Xiaoshan city area some time ago, and Wang Meiying, the woman who was abducted from Lin'an, were summoned by Prosecutor Zheng of the county court to have the Wang family from Lin'an come to claim her.

<p>Fishermen Request Exemption from Fishing Tax: More than ten fishing households, including Cao Bingxian, outside the South Gate of Xiaoshan, are suffering from poor fishing and frequent theft of fresh fish, resulting in unbearable losses.

<p>To the editors of your esteemed newspaper: We have read the article in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on May 15th regarding the arrest of Wu Jingxiu, Hua Kaihao, and others, who are jointly accused in the Xuyi and Sizhou area. The facts are generally correct. Zhang Pengchao has long been a known Communist Party member with evidence against him. During the purge of the party, he secretly returned to Xuyi and relied on the protection of Wu Jingxiu to survive in various government agencies. Later, last year, Hua Kaihao, Lu Xiaogang, and others colluded with a large number of Communist Party members and came to Xuyi to work as teachers. Party members Yang Mengjiu and others obtained substantial evidence and submitted it to the superior party department. Subsequently, the Anhui Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government separately issued secret orders to the Xuyi County Party Department and the County Government to jointly arrest Zhang Pengchao, Wu Jingxiu, Hua Kaihao, Li Xianying, Lu Xiaogang, Du Zhonghe, and eleven others and send them to the province for legal proceedings. However, the suspects fled upon hearing the news. On March 30th, Tu Jiangong, a detective dispatched by the County Government, arrested Wu Jingxiu and Hua Kaihao at the Zhonghe Hotel in the capital city and has already sent them to the province to await trial. Zhang Pengchao did not turn himself in. Furthermore, we have read a letter from Zhang Pengchao, Wu Jingxiu, Hua Kaihao, and others in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on May 23rd, which is full of false accusations and cunning attempts to escape punishment. It also claims that the County Chamber of Commerce, the County Farmers' Association, the Finance Management Office, district offices, standing troops, and various organizations sent representatives Qin Yangchen, Yang Ruchen, and others to the province to appeal their unjust treatment. This is even more absurd. The County Farmers' Association has not yet been organized. The director of the Finance Management Office was Hua Kaihao. Because no one is in charge, it is still managed by the original staff. The standing troops have already been ordered to be disbanded by the provincial government. Moreover, under party rule, which organizations would dare to betray the party and the country and secretly collude with and protect Communist Party members? Our committee has separately ordered the relevant legal organizations to thoroughly investigate whether they have sent representatives and has also reported to the Provincial Party Department and forwarded the report to the Military Law Tribunal of the Provincial Government for strict prevention of any fraudulent actions. We hereby urge your newspaper to make corrections to maintain the integrity of the party. Dong Zhong, Organizing Committee Member and Training Director.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Discussing Children's Literature by Shang Zhongyi <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Reply to Mr. Wu Yan'yin Again)</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Wu Yan'yin's article in the Shen Bao on May 19th, I feel that Mr. Wu has misunderstood the target of my remarks. I am afraid that my comrades in the field of children's education may be misled and all go astray. Therefore, I hereby clarify my position to dispel any doubts. As for any words that involve emotional disputes, they seem to be outside the scope of academic discussion, so I will not participate in them.</p>
<p>1. Mr. Wu's article says, "After reading Mr. Shang's great work, the atmosphere is very tense, as if the current Chinese primary school textbooks are full of the 'fantastic fairy tales' that Mr. Shang is talking about. In fact, I can comfort Mr. Shang with a joke. Our country's primary school textbooks have never been like American textbooks. There is not much material about 'fantastic fairy tales.' Even if there are some in the national language textbooks, they are minimal. However, I don't think Mr. Shang's remarks are 'shooting at nothing.' Chinese primary school textbooks may be misunderstood in the future and become like American textbooks, full of 'fantastic fairy tales.'"</p>
<p>What Mr. Wu is referring to is my article "On Children's Literature Again." However, the article discusses "children's literature" and not specifically "textbooks."</p>
<p>Now, let's take the commonly circulated national language textbooks as an example, based on thirty volumes (New Era, Volumes 1-8 of the Commercial Press, New School System, Volumes 1-8, and New China, Volumes 1-7 of Zhonghua, and New Primary School, Volumes 1-4, 6-8). An examination of national language textbooks shows that materials that "violate natural phenomena" account for 21% of the total. As for ordinary children's literature, this proportion is likely to be higher. (By the way, newly emerging textbooks in the United States, such as HordyGageHrno's readers, have very few materials that "violate natural phenomena." The readers are not at hand, so I cannot be sure of the exact proportion, but as far as I remember, it is definitely below 21%.)</p>
<p>2. Mr. Wu's article says, "As for those who support 'fantastic fairy tales,' Mr. Shang's paper seems to designate me as one of them. In fact, Mr. Shang has misunderstood me. Although I am not enlightened, I will never be a loyal subject of 'fantastic fairy tales.' I am currently in a hurry to complete a national language textbook for lower grades that is full of new natural events (not avoiding bird and animal language). I don't have time to discuss this matter further. I hope Mr. Shang will not make any more remarks that are not very relevant to this topic, other than the question of whether 'bird and animal language' is the same as ghost stories and should be broken. Otherwise, not only will it be too far from the topic, but I will also not dare to discuss it with Mr. Shang again." When the Children's Education Society discussed the selection of children's literature, I proposed nine negative standards and ten positive standards. "Violating natural phenomena" is one of the negative standards. Cramming nineteen standards into thirty minutes felt like the poem was short but the meaning was long and I could not fully express myself. So, I declared to the crowd, "In the near future, I will have a more detailed and precise discussion to seek correction from you all." At that time, I planned to divide the nineteen standards into several articles, and "On Children's Literature Again" is one of them. It is a sequel that specifically discusses "violating natural phenomena." My previous and subsequent remarks were all aimed at the comrades of the Children's Education Society to provide them with reference and criticism. When I discussed this matter at the Children's Education Society, I did not think of Mr. Wu, and when I published the article, I was only incidentally answering Mr. Wu's questions. The main purpose was still to explain my unfinished thoughts to my comrades and not specifically to Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu believes that I designated him as one of them is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>3. Mr. Wu says, "If we do not recognize Mr. Shang's lofty arguments and think that Mr. Shang is also opposed to 'cat and dog textbooks,' then textbooks of 'heaven, earth, sun, and moon'... may be revived."</p>
<p>This section does not directly involve me, but I can also take this opportunity to solemnly declare that I am very suspicious and negative about stories and other literature that violate natural phenomena. However, my hope for children's literature is not to return to the past but to go a step further from fairy tales and stories to seek sound and flawless literature that is reasonable and does not violate nature.</p>
<p>4. Mr. Wu asks, "'Is 'bird and animal language' the same as ghost stories and should be broken'?"</p>
<p>The violation of natural phenomena in ghost stories lies in their content, while the violation of nature in stories lies more in their form. Although there are differences in the nature of their violation of natural phenomena, their "violation of natural phenomena" is the same. Regarding this type of literature that violates nature, I have already made a frank statement in my article "On Children's Literature Again." Now, I would like to reiterate: "Instead of using literature that violates nature with questionable value and containing risks, why not use literature that has value and no risks based on facts and possible materials?" (Narrowing its scope, it can specifically refer to stories.) "Instead of using stories with questionable value and containing risks, why not use natural literature that has value and no risks?"</p>
<p>Because the violation of nature in stories is mostly only in form and does not penetrate into the content, the risks it contains may be less than those in ghost stories. For example, I once said during a discussion at the Children's Education Society, "Children have the opportunity to correct themselves if they see cats talking in literature..." Therefore, my attitude towards stories is slightly more tolerant than towards ghost stories. But further asking, "Why give children a concept that still needs to be corrected instead of directly giving them a concept that does not need correction?" So, the question I am currently holding is: "If we can achieve the same (or better) effect without using bird and animal language, while also avoiding the possibility of its risks (at least saving the trouble of correction), why must we use bird and animal language?" If we say that we cannot achieve the same or better effect without using stories, what about the works of Fabre of France and Selon of the United States? The above is from a principled perspective. In reality, I advocate greatly reducing the number of stories in children's literature to make room for sound, flawless, and natural stories and scientific literature that do not violate nature. In principle and in practice, this is my position.</p>
<p>During the discussion at the Children's Education Society, my use of the word "break" was entirely in a joking tone to express my negative attitude towards "violating nature," similar to Mr. Wu's comforting me with a joke. Everyone present that day was able to understand the attitude with which those two words were used. If you think that I should not involve joking in academic discussions, I hereby inform my comrades of this oversight.</p>
<p>But whether or not it is "broken," I am indeed negative and doubtful about all literature that violates nature.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e57">Zhang, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, Resigns Due to Four Months of Teacher Salary Arrears <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Teachers and Staff Will Strike Due to Wage Arrears</p>
<p>Zhang Daoshen, the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, has made plans for the progress of education in the province, but he is hampered by a lack of funds and cannot clear the old debt for various educational institutions. It is difficult to maintain existing businesses. He has already submitted his resignation request. I have learned that his submission is as follows:</p>
<p>For the matter of submitting a request, I, Daoshen, have been appointed by the National Government as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Education. Since taking office, I have been in office for more than five months. I have tried my best to follow in the footsteps of the previous director, to proceed according to the procedures, and to strive for improvement. However, the implementation of the plan depends on the economy. The officials of the provincial government are well aware of this. I am grateful to Chairman Zhang and Wang Cheng'ying, Director of the Department of Finance, for their consideration of education and their efforts to allocate the necessary funds. However, due to the accumulation of old debts, it is difficult to clear them. The funds for provincial educational institutions have been in arrears for as many as four months since January of this year. The requests for salary payments from various schools arrive day and night, and some even set schedules and demand in various ways. I have observed that, regarding the accumulated expenses, if their requests cannot be met, some teachers and staff who fail to understand the government's difficulties may resort to strikes and work stoppages. The impact is not only related to the future of education in this province but also enough to confuse the views of distant parties. In recent days, those who have come to the department to demand payment have been exhorted by Daofan with righteousness to make things difficult for them. However, the need for funds is imminent, and empty words are ultimately difficult to satisfy their hopes. I humbly believe that the provincial government's financial exhaustion is a fact and cannot be concealed, while the schools' salary arrears of four months of payment also feel very difficult. Daoshen clearly knows that the provincial treasury is like this and it is impossible to urge them to pay. The economic situation of the schools is the same. It is indeed difficult to deal with. Not only is it difficult to implement the new projects planned by this department, but even if we want to slightly rectify the existing businesses, we are limited by the funds that cannot be paid out on a monthly basis, and we cannot proceed. If this continues, it will be difficult to maintain the status quo. I deeply believe that education is the foundation of a nation, while economy is the source of a business. At the beginning of the political training period, we should do our best to build. However, after assessing the situation, even if we think hard about sharing the difficulties and striving to promote progress, it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. After thinking again and again, instead of being unable to develop and being hindered from proceeding, why not let the capable as soon as possible, so as to avoid misleading them? I humbly ask you to examine your sincerity and allow me to forward this to the central government to remove me from my concurrent positions. I am extremely anxious to obey orders. To the best of my knowledge, I submit this to Zhang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Zhang Daofan, Director of the Department of Education.</p>

<p>Friendship Game... Fudan Wins Jiaotong... 15 to 8</p>
<p>The Jiangda baseball game has reached the stage of close combat. In the first battle, Jiaotong defeated Jinan. In the second battle, Jinan defeated Fudan. Yesterday afternoon, Jiaotong met Fudan at the China Baseball Field. When the bell rang three times to declare war, the Jiaotong army had already stationed in the field, preparing for a bloody battle. However, news came that the Fudan players gave up their rights due to the final exam. The Jiaotong baseball team won the championship without losing a soldier or a shot. At that time, because the freshmen in the Fudan team could not participate, they temporarily invited Jiaotong to play a friendly match. After seven innings of fighting, the Jiaotong champion unexpectedly fell under the iron hooves of the new army. This is also an unexpected anecdote. In the first inning, Jiaotong scored two points with two runners returning to base between a wave of their hands. In the second inning, Fudan's safe hits came like a string of beads. By the time Jiaotong reorganized its lineup to make up for the situation, it was already irreversible. In this inning, Fudan gained seven points, and Jiaotong gained one point. In the subsequent three innings, Jiaotong prevented the enemy's progress and tried to find a way out. Under the door, they snatched three points. Unexpectedly, after a little carelessness, the Fudan army invaded again in the sixth and seventh innings, losing a total of eight points, while Jiaotong only scored two points. The result of the friendly match was 15 to 8, Fudan won.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Dust Talk from the Finger Zen Room <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>South of the Yangtze River, those who speak of Chinese medicine unanimously recommend Mr. He Jiheng of Danyang. Mr. He is over sixty years old, but he is energetic and talkative, and looks like he is in his forties. From this, it can be seen that he has mastered the art of health preservation. He is proficient in calligraphy and literature, and is a doctor who is also a Confucian. He named his residence the Finger Zen Room, meaning that the Bodhisattva manifested himself with great wisdom. The small room is the Vimalakirti's abbot, freely using his samadhi in a finger Zen machine, so he can make every move successful and become a lucky star and a living Buddha for thousands of families. I once participated in the treatment of diseases and recognized Mr. He, and I received his great favor and made a friendship that transcends age. However, we have not seen each other for several years. Last Sunday, I took my sick wife to Dancheng again. It was already dark and there was a heavy storm, so I left my wife in the inn and went alone to knock on Mr. He's door. When I opened the door and entered, we were surprised and delighted to see each other. He said that I came in the deep night and heavy storm, and my feelings were no less than those of Wang Ziyou, who visited Dai An Daikui in Shanyin on a snowy day. There were already three guests in the room, and Mr. He introduced them to me one by one, saying that they were all scholars. I smiled and said, "How can there be vulgar guests in this room?" The night rain in Bashan, the old story by the west window, the tea smoke is green, and the lamp flower is not red. Outside the curtain, I no longer know the bell ringing and the leakage is exhausted. The guests left in the middle of the night, but I stayed alone, and the secluded interest was not yet exhausted, and the high talk turned clear. Mr. He said that my country's medicine began to decline when Ye Tianshi came out, not because Ye's art was sparse, but because those who studied Ye's art were at fault. The ancient doctors were all practical and laid a solid foundation. Ye was born with a genius, but he took the path of ingenuity and took shortcuts. Like a military strategist, he was determined to win by using partial divisions and strange plans, and no longer saw the dignified drums and the upright flags. Later scholars followed the trend and changed their practices. Without Ye's cleverness, they only took advantage of his quick effects. Whether it was playing cleverness and hurting the patient's family, they had already lost the ancient people's sincere and fearless model. Every situation was getting worse, and the medical way was no longer able to be asked. I said that this theory can be applied to poetry. The existence of Ye in medicine is like the existence of Suiyuan in poetry. Suiyuan specializes in spirituality in poetry and does not take style. His theory is convenient for beginners and teaches people to use skill, but the mellow flavor before the Tang Dynasty is all gone. Moreover, scholars without his talent and who imitate his poems are more likely to flow into the disease of frivolousness. It is also like the modern painter Wu Changshuo, who opened the door of sparseness and strength for the younger generation, but nowadays there are many rough and expanded works. This is all the same as the advantages and disadvantages of Ye's medical benefits. Mr. He looked at each other and laughed when he heard the words, but the bell on the wall had already reported three times, so we cherished each other and parted and returned to Xihou to write it.</p>

<p>The old man Hai Cang read my poems and said that I am outstanding and extraordinary. How can there be no two or three people in Jiangnan who are like me? Once a fine horse comes out, they will all be defeated. How many confidants have I known in my life? (Borrowing the sentence from Hai Cang) The public said that I am happy, but the world is suspicious. Stop, stop, the world should not be suspicious. The gentleman spit out the wonders in his chest that can make you twitch your tongue and stare your eyes. He learned to read without a teacher, and the alaya consciousness is his teacher. The gentleman also has no servants or concubines, and the flower demon and tree spirit are available for driving. However, the gentleman is still a human being in the world. The gentleman knows the bitterness and suffering in the world. It is not enough to talk about birth, old age, sickness, and death. The most unbearable thing is to seek what cannot be obtained and to love and separate. What does the gentleman love? All sentient beings are like his wife. What does the gentleman seek? He only seeks to help all sentient beings ascend to the ladder to heaven one by one. The psychologist Freud heard it and said: "Although this is just a change of sexuality, the source of world culture and art lies in this." The gentleman laughed loudly and suddenly. He only saw the youthful daylight flying in the air, suddenly like a current of electricity running through all the veins, and like the smell of alcohol reaching the limbs, like a crazy tide rising and shaking the chest and armpits, like a demon snake entering and accumulating the heart and spleen, like truth and illusion, like a dream, like sorrow, like anger, like thirst and hunger. The heavenly swan and the imperial girl hid and peeped at the door, and the auspicious unicorn and the phoenix came one after another. The great bright lamp was hanging high, and the mandala flowers were piled up on the steps. Lao Zhuang Qu Song dedicated their pens and inks, and Su Huang Li Du opened their zuns and yis. The Western Shaw Bonner and the Eastern Tagore, the old servants follow left and right. The gentleman drank ten thousand zhis of pain, and the falling paper was so smooth that each word was like a flower, and each word was like the sun and the moon hanging down. The vitality of the universe was released, and then there was the gentleman's poem. Alas, then there was the gentleman's poem in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Feelings from Watching "The Sea of Regret" <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Tu Nan</p>
<p>Opium and prostitution are fierce weapons that cripple the youth's body and ruin their future. Promising citizens are destroyed by them beyond recognition. It can be said that even children with a little knowledge know the harm of these two things. However, judging from the current society, I don't know how many people knowingly commit crimes, are confused for a while, and regret it for the rest of their lives. Only when their money is exhausted and they have no face as heroes do they realize and regret it, but it is already too late. Therefore, the government has repeatedly ordered the prohibition of opium and prostitution. However, if you look at it with sharp eyes, those who prohibit it will prohibit it, and those who commit it will commit it. It is just like a piece of paper that has nothing to do with them. Some people say that it is not necessary to strictly prohibit it. It is better to collect taxes in the prohibition, which is more effective and visible. However, this is a passive method. It is better to use a kind of edification method to approach, which should be superficial and practical, so that a group of friends who are addicted can automatically realize it without knowing it. Then, although the mulberry tree is lost, there is still a corner to the east. After talking about it, I want to talk about movies. The edification power of movies is very great, and it is easier than various kinds of publicity. After watching "The Sea of Regret" recently released by the Star Film Company, I felt the above remarks. "The Sea of Regret" was originally a narrative of an old novel from decades ago, and it was also a matter of decades ago. However, the harm of being harmed by opium and prostitutes is described very vividly and deeply. After reading it, it can indeed make people wake up. The Chen Boh of the drama can be said to be too many people in the current society who have the same disease as him. After reading the result of Chen Boh's, we young people are really in great danger. People who are not deeply involved in the world, I dare to introduce you to see it, especially in the government, we should encourage film companies to produce more films of this kind, then its effect may be more practical than a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Pan Zhang Chengbo has been the Chinese manager of the Yihuo Shipping Company for decades. He is now old and unable to cope with the arduous work. He has handed over the company's affairs to Wen Lang Zhiquan. He plans to take a long-term trip to Europe and the United States. All the antiques, treasures, jewels, and furnishings purchased over the years in Chengyuan Garden at No. 2 Gelo Road will be transferred together to facilitate his departure. After arriving in Europe and the United States, if he encounters a suitable location, he will build a villa there as a place for entertaining the elderly. If he returns to China, he should run another rabbit fur coat to enjoy his remaining years. The most valuable of the items he is currently planning to transfer are the ancient bronze bells, tripods, yis, jués, and incense burners from the Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties; the incense boxes of the Qing Yongzheng dynasty; the flower vases of the Kangxi dynasty; the flower pots of the Qianlong Kiln; the white jade ruyis; the jadeite water containers; the ivory carved screens for palace use; the rosewood inlaid jade screens and hanging screens; the natural boats, mountains, water, and inserted tablets; the authentic calligraphy and paintings of famous people from past dynasties; various rosewood, shade wood, teak, and mahogany large armchairs and master chairs; natural tables, offering tables, Eight Immortals tables, antique cabinets, flower stands, piano platforms, tea platforms, marble pit beds, imported carriage materials, glass ware, cream lacquer rooms, colors, Beijing carpets, gold thread table carpets, various silverware, alum stone floor lamps, potted flowers, etc. There are all kinds of things, and those who have the same interests can go to Chengyuan Garden to take a look on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of this week.</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>In Anjo Town, I saw two very tall and large wooden plaques inscribed with "Hekikai County Reservists Association" and "Anjo Town Youth Corps". The regulations of the Youth Corps are slightly different across Japan, but every city, town, and village organizes one because it is mandated by the government and national policy, holding great significance. They are not allowed to not organize one. Some regulations stipulate an age range from teens to early twenties, while others require a certain level of education, such as graduation from a specific type of school. How do they ensure everyone joins? Normally, military service requires two years, but Youth Corps members only need one and a half years. Soldiers are divided into upper, middle, and lower ranks, progressing sequentially, but Youth Corps members can jump directly to the upper rank, so everyone wants to join. How are they taught? (1) Physical training (2) Character training (3) Vocational training. I have already mentioned that. Ultimately, why do they exert such great effort and organize the Youth Corps on such a large scale? What is the reason? To be frank, it is to prepare for war. Who will they fight? It is rumored to be a certain country. Why would they involve my country? What is the ultimate cause? What piece of land is at stake? I hope all my fellow countrymen will think about it.</p>
<p>Why is the Youth Corps related to warfare? It is because they prepare various military strategies, defense, military supplies, and so on. However, they always feel that the population is too small. If they rely on each individual to risk their lives, it might not be enough. The only way to win against a larger force is to have a smaller but highly skilled army. Besides active duty soldiers, there are reserves and continuing reserves. What comes after that? If every young person from their teens to their early twenties is thoroughly trained and qualified to serve as a reserve for the reserves, then they will have nothing to fear. Moreover, by uniting these young people across the country, it becomes easy to instill any ideology or rally them against any enemy. How profound and ruthless is their intention?</p>
<p>Therefore, the Youth Corps must also be linked to the Reservists Association, so that the older generation can lead the younger generation.</p>
<p>The Anjo Youth Corps uses five ordinary elementary schools as its center, but students from higher elementary schools and supplementary schools can also join, regardless of gender. The town mayor serves concurrently as the corps leader. This is what the school principal told me.</p>
<p>Hearing this, one might feel that the Hekikai countryside is filled with a murderous aura. Not at all! Please look at a notice at Anjo Station:</p>

<h3 id="e80">Random Thoughts on the Lake (1) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The water of West Lake has recently become incredibly polluted, unfit not only for drinking but also for washing. After drawing water, adding alum, and allowing it to settle overnight, the next morning, when boiling it for cooking, reddish crystals are immediately seen floating and sinking, almost filling the pot, which is disgusting. Therefore, I fetch water from Jade Spring day and night, but the water taken from the pond by the stele is still clear; even the water in the fish pond is turbid and unpleasant. If I were to fetch water from Tiger Spring, it would cost one yuan for every two buckets, enough for only three days of cooking. West Lake used to have a Lotus Wine Courtyard in Jinsha Ravine, where lotus flowers were grown, hence the Lotus Wine Courtyard, which was used to brew wine. Zhou Zizhi discussed moving the Lotus Wine Courtyard with Minister Zhang, writing that the Ministry of Revenue had the Lotus Wine Courtyard in West Lake for six or seven years, yielding over six million catties of lotus roots, from which the government profited over 300,000 strings of cash. Some people proposed moving it, not knowing that both wine and lotus roots require water, and good water makes them excellent, while bad water ruins them. One must choose carefully. West Lake's water was once as clear as sugar. Now, the proposed new location is near a turbid harbor, using bamboo pipes to draw river water from less than a hundred feet away, flowing with the tide. Its taste is very poor. They are unwilling to dig wells for spring water, not realizing that the source of the spring is also the tide. Furthermore, Su Shi requested permission to dredge West Lake, stating that no official wine production in the world was as large as Hangzhou's, with annual taxes of over 200,000 strings of cash, relying on the lake for water. If the lake gradually shrinks and the water does not flow properly, people will have to fetch mountain spring water from afar, costing no less than 200,000 workdays per year. This shows how important the purity of the lake water is. Even if the people of Hangzhou do not brew wine, they all buy it from Shaoxing. Yet, rinsing caps and washing feet in the lake inevitably brings criticism from all over, who all view it as if it were the Yellow River and lament that no sage is emerging. In my opinion, algae in the lake are a major cause of the sediment that makes it turbid. Only large fish can eat algae, and among fish, the longest-lived and easiest to breed are carp. Therefore, the people of Hangzhou pretend to follow the teachings of the gods and prohibit eating carp, claiming that April 8th is Buddha's birthday and encouraging people to release carp into West Lake, perhaps as a remnant of Fan Zhongyan's policy of using the ignorance of the people. Algae ash is rich in potassium carbonate. Last winter, I saw piles of it near Bai Causeway, as if someone were collecting it and drying it for fuel. If so, then using the ash as fertilizer for fish farming, or using lye made from the ash for washing clothes, is also a proper use and not a waste.</p>
<p>Willow catkins can turn into duckweed. On sunny and windless days in February, willow cotton clings to the trees, resembling a graceful maiden wearing a crane cloak by the lake. When the east wind suddenly rises, it flies across the lake, turning the entire surface white like snow. Overnight, it turns yellowish-green, floating on the water like moss. Much of the lake's turbidity is due to this. Fish accidentally eat it, only to spit it out. Jade Spring uses rice cakes to feed the fish. When the cakes float on the surface, the fish compete to eat them, often splashing around, making for an enjoyable sight. However, when willow catkins fill the water, turning it green, the fish mostly hide and only eat the cakes after they sink. The knowledge of fish is also remarkable. The Central Health Department once prohibited adding salicylic acid to soy sauce to prevent mold because it hinders digestion. Fish can protect their own lives in this way, showing that humans are not as good as birds, and certainly not as good as fish.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Gold Market Advances Eight Hundred Taels Mark <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuating unpredictably and ultimately plunging sharply. Yesterday, the gold price fell again, breaking through the 800-tael mark. The market chaos is ultimately unstoppable. The waves surge, and people are panic-stricken. The situation is particularly precarious. The overall market had a difference of eighteen or nineteen taels, ultimately plunging thirteen taels, reversing several days of consecutive gains. There were more sellers, but receipts and payments were divergent. The silver market continued to rise, opening low, then rising as buyers became active, and it was rumored that the U.S. stock market had fallen, briefly breaking through 810 taels. Afterwards, the foreign exchange rate increased by half a notch, and the domestic market also hardened, with major players dumping their holdings in a rapid retreat, falling sharply by more than ten taels. The price then suddenly broke through 800 taels, hovering around that mark. Later, selling pressure surged, and the exchange rate declined further, making the market extremely weak and in a state of rapid decline. A sharp drop of eight or nine taels was expected if the silver market continued to rise. The silver price continued to rise, opening lower. The opening price for the early July contract fell by two or three mace to 806 taels 1 mace. Because major silver firms all increased by one-sixteenth, the silver price increased by eight fen three li. Private telegrams added one-sixteenth. Shortly after, it fell again to 805 taels 5 mace.

<p>The market conditions remain good, with transactions totaling 18 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for various public bonds were such that only spot contracts were opened in the former market, while the latter market was not opened. The June futures contract was still very active, while the next month's contract was affected by the need to submit spot goods, so the market conditions continued to be quite calm. Regarding the trend of various bond prices, the buying interest was excellent in the morning, and the price increase was even stronger than the previous day, with many varieties nearly being suspended from trading due to excessive gains.

<h3 id="e86">Strong Sales of Cotton Yarn to the North <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Actual sales of cotton yarn are increasingly active. Purchasing from the Tianjin area in the north is particularly enthusiastic. Furthermore, Jinan and Xuzhou in Shandong are also active. This is entirely due to the tightening of exchange rates, preventing the import of Japanese yarn. Furthermore, the local factories in Qingdao have a severe shortage of 16-count and 20-count yarn, and prices are high. Shanghai is over ten taels. Merchants from Tianjin, due to the improved cloth business there, are shipping goods to Mongolia and Tibet for sale. Therefore, the momentum of searching for and purchasing cotton yarn in Shanghai is exceptionally strong, and several factories have had their goods emptied. They are switching to purchasing futures. However, due to high raw material prices, the factories are unwilling to sell off their stock, which shows the strength of the merchants' buying volume. In recent days, exports of cotton yarn have been approximately 30,000 bales. The current market situation is still stable because a high price puts pressure on sellers, and the political situation is unstable with overseas cotton not performing well, so there are many short sellers. However, the actual demand is extremely strong, and bottom stocks are significantly reduced. If there are no special changes in the future, the price of 167-8 taels will likely be realized one day.</p>
<p>The people's price fell and then rose. The people's price on the exchange opened lower due to the poor performance of U.S. cotton and the slight slowdown in sales of spot yarn, each falling 2-5-7 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that business was booming again in various regions, and the market suddenly strengthened, with each rising 2-3 qian. Transactions totaled 39,200 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 1,500 bales, Heshen 1,000 bales, Ruida 1,800 bales, Shenji 1,450 bales, and Xiesheng 2,200 bales. Rongxing bought 1,600 bales, Gengfeng 4,700 bales, Yichang 1,350 bales, and Xincheng 650 bales. The closing prices for the people's price are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The most active sales are spot yarn to Tianjin. The sales of spot yarn are still strong, with merchants from Tianjin being the strongest buyers. According to statistics, all regions bought a total of 4,202 bales, with fellow traders buying 300 bales. The market price rose 5 qian. Merchants from Tianjin bought 1,850 bales, merchants from the interior bought 400 bales, merchants from Sichuan bought 120 bales, merchants from Zhenjiang bought 110 bales, merchants from Youtou bought 690 bales, merchants from Shandong bought 150 bales, merchants from Qinhuangdao bought 100 bales, merchants from Guangdong bought 450 bales, merchants from Xiamen bought 120 bales, merchants from the northern region bought 100 bales, merchants from Yunnan bought 100 bales, and miscellaneous merchants bought 200 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is flat and weak. Due to the poor performance of U.S. cotton, the market is trending downward, and the gold price has also slightly declined, causing market sentiment to soften. Japanese firms are selling near-term contracts and buying far-term contracts, so the amount of new cotton purchased is increasing. According to the situation of Han Standard and various local markets, inventories are running low, and prices are likely to rise but difficult to fall. However, overseas cotton markets are trending downward, and exchange rates are firm, creating a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Han Standard Prices Fell 3-4 Qian. Han Standard prices on the exchange followed the U.S. and fell 2-3 qian in the early market. In the afternoon, the gold price slightly declined by 1 qian, and the distant market was even. Transactions totaled 60,100 dan. It was found that Xinheng sold 8,000 dan, Tianlong 1,400 dan, and Dafu 2,200 dan. Dafeng bought 3,300 dan, Changfeng 4,900 dan, and Gengfeng 1,800 dan.

<p>At the Xinzha (New Gate) rice market in Zhabei yesterday, due to the clear weather, transactions felt even more sluggish. Although there were still many people at the market in the morning, their appetite ultimately seemed sporadic. The market found it difficult to return to high prices. The top-grade, thick "geng" rice (non-glutinous japonica rice) saw no change. The middle and second grades only fell by a few cents. Rice for rice cakes and dumplings sold well, so the price rose by ten cents. The sales of early rice were minimal, and the price neither rose nor fell. "Yangdu" and "Bu" pointed rice were affected by foreign rice, and the opening price fell by five cents. Distilleries only bought a limited amount, so the overall market trended lower. According to news from the miscellaneous grain association, a Taikoo (Butterfield &amp; Swire) company steamer brought 100,000 bags of Saigon rice, priced at eleven yuan and thirty cents. Several boats were coming from the west road, and various goods from the riverside factories opened at around three dan (approximately 150 kg).</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were slightly fewer boats arriving from various routes in Shanghai South compared to before. The inventory in Pudong was also low. Transactions for late rice were stagnant and unmoved. Those looking at high prices were fixed, while those in the middle saw softness. Although the arrival of Changxi and Tongbei white "geng" rice was scarce, sales on this street were very weak, and the price was slightly lower. Sand boats bought 300 "shi" (approximately 30,000 liters) of early rice, and the price remained the same as the original price. "Bianyin yuan" and "Duyang" pointed rice flooded in, indicating a sluggish downstream market. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Nanjing train brought a carload of Anhui-Jiangxi pointed rice. Local purchases were still active, and the opening price was lowered by ten cents.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Standard Flour Plummets by Four Cents <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a uniform trend of sharp decline. The reason for this heart-stirring event was entirely due to the good weather, which was conducive to wheat harvesting. The collection in various parts of Jiangnan is in full swing, and it is estimated that it will be fully collected in another ten days. Given the current weather, there is a real hope for prolonged sunshine. Therefore, the hearts of people inside and outside the industry are changing. Even the attitude of the mainland traders, which was previously unusually firm, has recently softened. Therefore, from the opening to the close, although the factories did not have a large number of files released, those who returned were seen in layers, causing the market to be unusually dim and the price to gradually fall sharply. Judging from this, because the people's hearts have changed, we still see continued fatigue. As a result, this month fell three cents and two and a half points more than the previous day, July fell three cents and seven and a half points, August fell four cents and two and a half points, September fell three cents, October fell three cents and two and a half points, and November fell three cents and two and a half points.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Wheat Harvesting in Full Swing, Marked Wheat Plummets <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the market for wheat futures, the market for each month saw a gradual decline because foreign wheat quotes were also about four jiao lower. The price of gold had also entered the customs at eight hundred taels. Combined with the good weather during the harvest season of new wheat, the benefits were greatly realized. Therefore, the bulls in the same area dared not hold on as before. The Nanjing traders and the local traders all threw out. People's hearts were already temporarily in the air, and they took the opportunity to frantically suppress. As a result, the recent months were most affected, and the difference was more than one qian. Looking ahead, if the exchange rate relaxes again and the weather is still good, we still see signs of fatigue. As a result, this month and July plummeted one qian and one point, eight and nine months fell nine points, October fell eight points, and November fell six points.</p>

<p>The Clearing Plate Trading Is Quiet, and the Market is Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area sent a telegram stating that the current sugar price in Cuba had not changed. The New York sugar futures for September fell more than two points compared to the previous telegram, and each month fell one point. The new price for May was 151. The price of raw sugar in Java and sugar futures in June was still 8,000, and the price in July and August was 8250, which was still the same as before. Outside the clearing plate of the association market, the foreign exchange has changed to a long atmosphere, and the popularity is very equal. The need is even more scarce, but the door is still being pulled, resulting in a stalemate. Trading is very quiet. The asking price for Dutch No. 24 coarse sand white is still eleven taels and five qian, and there is no acceptance. Medium sand white, etc., are also quiet. Taikoo [DY] mark is slightly traded at eleven taels and three qian. The market is not strange. The asking price for Nissin Z mark is eleven taels and four qian, YT mark is eleven taels and four qian, YRO mark is eleven taels and one qian, SH mark is eleven taels and two qian, and the inquiries are lonely. J mark is eleven taels and eight qian and a half, YP is eleven taels and eight qian, Minghua goods are eleven taels and seven qian and a half, TM mark is eleven taels and two qian and a half, the transaction is still frequent, and the market shape is stable. There is a Hua Xin number on the market selling raw sand in spot goods of 500 bags, priced at Yuan Taels and Eight Qian. Although the acceptance is very scarce, the number is still thinking about raising it to ten taels.</p>

<p>Cocoon Production is Less Than 40%</p>
<p>The Improved Variety of Cocoons is the Best</p>
<p>In Dantu, the early first and second crops of silkworms in each market town completely failed this year.</p>
<p>The third late crop also started poorly. After the instructors ran around to take care of the silkworms, the ants began to improve after hibernation. The sunny and warm weather made the development profitable. The new crop's harvest is estimated to be less than forty percent of an average year. Only eight or nine cocoon firms have opened in the market. The opening scale has been opened for three days. The initial price of cocoons was 40 yuan. The goods arriving on the market are not strong, rising to 42-43 yuan. The quality of the cocoons is best for improved varieties, which can be sold for 45-46 yuan.</p>

<p>Highest Plate at 330 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the selection of Zhen Mei tea from Tunxi opened at the highest plate price of 330 taels by Jardine Matheson. This kind of market plate is unprecedented, but the sales of low grade Zhen Mei tea continue to be sluggish, and the selling price is more than ten taels lower than before. The green tea market has shown a trend of raising the high and lowering the low. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson, Jinlong and other firms in the Qimen black tea market also had a slight stomach, but because there were not many high grade teas, the market was gradually dwindling, and the selling plates were all falling without rising.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Piece Goods: Palatine, Gabardine and Feather Yarn Cloth Sell Well <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Palatine has been selling quite well in the market recently. Tailors of Western clothing stores have a need for high grade silk strips, selling for four taels, one qian and a half. The second grade sells for three taels, two or three qian. The Rongtai brand is three taels and eight qian and a half, Wufeng four taels and two qian, and Ningfeng three taels and five qian and a half. Solid colors are a few cents cheaper per pound. The Mitsui head number is four taels, and the second number is three taels and three or five qian. Hong Kong goods are sold by the yard for five yuan.</p>
<p>Because the weather is extremely hot, buyers are continuing to purchase feather yarn cloth. The business of selling clothing materials by the yard is also very impressive recently. The checkered goods are firm and the selling price of mercerized stripes is slightly lower. Rongtai sells for two taels and five qian, New Sassoon two taels, four qian and two and a half points, and Fair two taels and one qian. The price tag for the yard is eight jiao and eight fen. Western clothing stores also had a stomach for foreign style feather yarn cloth yesterday, but most of them were set-heads.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Hardware: Prices for Various Goods are Increased by Negotiation <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been quite quiet recently. Therefore, it is difficult to see an increase in the standards of each market. However, the repeated shrinking of foreign exchange has led to a substantial increase in the cost of each good. In order to maintain their capital, the local industry peers have negotiated and agreed to increase prices. Yesterday, the public meeting agreed that the market was 3 or 4 qian better than the previous market. For example, English steel plate, flat white iron, corrugated iron, French Western nails, etc. Therefore, the transaction has improved a lot. Although the opening market price has not yet been implemented compared to the negotiated price, it feels much stronger than the previous market. Yesterday, for example, the English steel plate was estimated at seven taels for five parts, six taels and seven qian and a half for seven and a half parts, and six taels and five qian for one point. Flat white twenty six was sixteen taels and seven qian and a half, twenty eight was seventeen taels and five qian, corrugated iron twenty four was sixteen taels, twenty six was sixteen taels and two qian and a half, twenty eight was seventeen taels, and French West nails were nine taels and three qian. It is said that a total of six or seven thousand dan were traded.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Commemoration of June 3rd Today <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Time: 10:00 AM</p>
<p>Location: Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The June 3rd Commemoration in this city has been jointly prepared by the Shanghai Special City Party Department, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association. It will be solemnly held today at 10:00 AM in the Grand Auditorium of the Tianhougong Bridge Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Previously, the Shanghai June 3rd Commemoration Preparatory Committee sent letters to various organizations in this city, requesting them to nominate four representatives to participate. All district branches and bureaus directly under the municipal government have been notified by their respective higher-level party departments and government to attend today to show their respect. The association's news is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to All Sectors: We are writing to inform you that June 3rd this year marks the 92nd anniversary of the passing of Lin Zexu. To expand publicity, our association, in conjunction with the Shanghai City Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, has decided to hold a commemorative ceremony for opium prohibition at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 AM on June 3rd. In addition to requesting the various district party departments and bureaus directly under the Municipal Government to send personnel through their respective higher-level party departments and organizations, we are writing to respectfully request that you nominate four representatives to attend and participate to show your respect and promote this cause. We would be immensely grateful. We respectfully wish you well.</p>
<p>Publicity Outline: (1) The Significance of the June 3rd Commemoration: Opium importation marked the beginning of political and economic aggression by imperialists against our country. It was also the starting point for the impoverishment of the people and the decline of the nation. Tracing back to the late Qing Dynasty, the British, disregarding humanitarianism, imported opium into the Central Plains, intending to drain our country's wealth and destroy our national vitality. Officials and scholars were unaware of its harm, and addiction became widespread, plunging people into darkness. Not only were individuals harmed by the scourge of drugs, but the country and society also suffered immense losses. Throughout the country, some even took pride in smoking opium, resulting in a century-long legacy of poison and immense suffering. Lin Zexu, realizing the British conspiracy to poison China with drugs, was determined to eliminate the scourge. Therefore, he wrote to the Qing court, vehemently denouncing its harm and taking decisive measures to deal with it. He ordered British merchants to surrender over 20,000 chests of opium and, on this day ninety-two years ago, destroyed them all at Humen, Guangzhou, to demonstrate our country's spirit of opium prohibition and deter the British merchants' audacity in spreading poison. The people were overjoyed.</p>
<p>Eradicate Evil Completely - Respectfully Inscribed by Zhang Qun</p>
<p>The British were quick to send troops, but Lin Zexu's defense was so skillful that they could find no opening. They then attacked Dinghai, Zhejiang, and other coastal areas. Local officials were negligent in their defense, leading to the loss of territory and indemnities, marking the beginning of unequal treaties and plunging our country into an abyss of suffering. The Qing court, unaware of the facts, blamed Lin Zexu for causing trouble by burning opium. Although Lin Zexu's determination to prohibit opium was not fully realized, his courageous spirit of resistance has become an immortal legacy. The National Government, to commemorate the legacy of its predecessors and encourage future generations, has designated this day as our country's Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day, requiring all agencies throughout the country to hold ceremonies. At a time when the aggression of the powers is increasing day by day and the harm of opium continues to grow, we must commemorate the fundamental starting point of the war on opium if we are to abolish all unequal treaties. (1) We should have awareness and effort. Lin Zexu stated in his memorial to the Qing court that "the harm of opium is worse than floods and fierce beasts. Future generations will never consider opium as something that does not need to be prohibited. If this scourge is not eliminated, in ten years there will be no usable soldiers and no funds to be raised. The spread of opium in the interior is like a festering sore on the human body. When a festering sore develops, it gradually produces pus. When opium comes, it gradually leads to bandits. Opium must be completely eliminated to eradicate the root of the disease." This shows that Lin Zexu's observation of the opium scourge was far superior to others. It is a pity that the Qing government was weak, its military preparedness was lax, and it was unable to fight. Moreover, officials and scholars were deeply addicted to opium, and they considered Lin Zexu's actions to be wrong, demanding compensation from Britain and suing for peace, resulting in a century of poison. Since the Republic, local warlords have guarded their own territories, collected opium taxes, forced farmers to plant opium, and protected its trafficking, unknowingly causing countless compatriots to be ruined by the black scourge. The import of foreign drugs has continued unabated. For example, according to the national customs statistics in the nineteenth year of the Republic, seized opium imports reached 32,303 pounds, morphine 1,590 pounds, and cocaine 1,260 pounds. The number of imports that were not seized is even more unknown. The amount of opium planted domestically is even harder to estimate. Today marks the 92nd anniversary of Lin Zexu's burning of opium. Looking back, the opium scourge in our country is still rampant. How can our compatriots not feel pain and vow to completely eradicate it? Fortunately, the anti-opium movement has been developing for years, and opium prohibition laws have long been promulgated. If we can unite as a nation to eliminate opium, it will not be difficult. It is essential to continue the spirit of resistance to opium of the late martyr Lin Zexu and actively participate in the anti-opium movement. Internally, we must urge the government to implement opium prohibition, and externally, we must resist the import of foreign drugs, so that we will not fail Lin Zexu's original aspiration to prohibit opium, and the significance of this commemoration will be immortal.</p>

<p>Anti-Opium Declaration, June 3rd Commemoration Day, Republic of China, Year 20: Lin Zexu's burning of opium on June 3rd is the most memorable day in our country's history, and it is also a day that all our nationals should never forget. At that time, the British were importing large quantities of opium into China, and its harm was unstoppable. At that time, Lin Wen-zhong alone had the foresight to repeatedly petition the authorities, vehemently denouncing the harm of opium with earnest words. The authorities indeed listened to him and sent him south to investigate opium. After Lin took office as the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, he ordered the British merchants residing in Guangdong to surrender their stored opium within three days. For a time, it was carried out with great force, and the British did not dare to disobey, so they had to surrender all of it, totaling more than 2.3 million catties. Lin then ordered it to be burned at Humen. It took more than twenty days to burn all of the opium. After the opium was burned, the British leader Elliot was very unwilling and sent many warships to attack Guangdong several times, but Lin Zexu defeated them all. Seeing that there was no opportunity in Guangdong, the British turned to attack Dinghai and Ningbo in Zhejiang, and then crossed the ocean to attack Tianjin, causing shock along the coast and in the capital. The officials were unable to find a way to deal with it and said that Lin Zexu had caused the trouble. Everyone spoke ill of him, and the authorities dismissed him and demoted him to Yili. The Opium War ended there. The Qing Dynasty signed a treaty with the British, paying 6 million yuan in opium indemnity and giving Hong Kong to them. From then on, opium poisoned the whole country until now. When we recall this painful history and look at the harm of opium in China, we cannot help but feel that our responsibility is great and our work is difficult. In the ninety-two years since Lin's failure, foreigners have not only continued to transport opium to China but have also jointly carried out military, economic, and cultural aggression against our country. Fellow comrades,</p>
<p>Please fill out the oath and cut it off together with the mailing address and send it to the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association at No. 4 Ganglu Road, Shanghai. We will send you exquisite anti-opium publications (please enclose 4 cents for postage).</p>
<p>Anti-Opium Oath</p>
<p>I will never plant, produce, transport, sell, or use opium or narcotic drugs, and I will strive to support the anti-opium movement. This oath is sworn on June 3rd, Republic of China, Year 2. Signature of the person taking the oath.</p>
<p>The people of China are groaning under the oppression of the powers. In the final analysis, the root cause is the Opium War. We only need to carefully study why Lin Wen-zhong did not ultimately achieve victory. It was not because he lacked perseverance but because there were no comrades who could continue his aspirations. Because there was no organized group, such a great undertaking relied entirely on his personal spirit and perseverance. Therefore, after he lost power, the anti-opium cause also stopped. This is the only reason for the failure of the anti-opium movement ninety-two years ago, and it is also the only reason for the failure of the anti-opium movement for the past ninety-two years. Since we have realized this, our anti-opium comrades throughout the country must unite and fight together. Although the National Government has repeatedly issued strict orders to ban opium, there are still many soldiers in various provinces who are forcing the people to plant opium and protecting the transportation of opium. Foreign narcotic drugs are still secretly imported continuously, and the proposal for opium sales is still widespread. Under this situation, we should unite and join the National Anti-Opium Movement to be the backing for thorough opium prohibition, so that the opium scourge in the country will be completely eliminated from now on. Everyone should continue the great aspirations of Lin Wen-zhong ninety-two years ago, so that this June 3rd Commemoration Day will not pass in vain. Now the National Government has stipulated that today is the Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day, and for the past two years, the whole country has been vigorously celebrating it. This is the only Commemoration Day for our anti-opium comrades throughout the country. We should work even harder to continue Lin's legacy and thoroughly eradicate all drug scourges. Although Lin Wen-zhong died unfulfilled, his spirit and fearless anti-opium spirit will forever remain in the hearts of everyone in the Chinese nation. He is the vanguard of the anti-opium movement in China. His great spirit and personality are what we should recognize. This is the greatest contribution of the June 3rd Commemoration to us. We hereby declare.</p>
<p>The Situation of Opium Seedlings in Various Provinces in the Past Three Years: The trend of opium seedling planting in our country from the 14th to the 17th year of the Republic of China has gradually spread from the famous opium producing provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan to the whole country. According to a survey in the 16th year, there was almost no province without opium seedlings, and many provinces competed with each other to increase production. The military and political authorities in various provinces were also in a period of turmoil. The internal war was not peaceful, so they took this opportunity to collect taxes. The people suffered greatly and complained. There were even major changes caused by the collection of opium seedling taxes, resulting in loss of life, such as the resistance of bandits in western Henan and the械鬭of villagers in southern Fujian. Many records of blood and tears can be found in past opium scourge yearbooks. The situation from the winter of 1928 to today is slightly better than before, but although the central government has strict prohibitions, most provinces have not followed them, so opium seedlings have flourished again in northern Anhui, southern Fujian, western Henan, and eastern Shanxi, and Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan are even worse. According to the continuous investigation of our association in the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, the number of opium seedlings eradicated in various provinces resulted in 36 counties implementing the eradication of opium seedlings in the 252 county reports in the 17th year of the Republic of China. In the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), 72 counties implemented the eradication of opium seedlings in the 340 county governments. A brief table can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>Province Republic of China Year 17 Republic of China Year 18 Zhejiang 3,122.0</p>
<p>Henan 2,582.3 3,782.0 Shandong 109.0</p>
<p>Jiangsu 332.4 91.2 Jilin 3,269.0 242.0 Hebei 5 7.2 Shaanxi 57.4 258.4 Hunan 3,370.0 447.0 Guangxi 7.0</p>
<p>Ningxia 13.0 117.5 Ningxia 7.515.5</p>
<p>Yunnan 688.0 846.0 Anhui 125.0 Jiangxi 1.0 Shanxi 0.0 Fujian 2.0 Gansu</p>
<p>Sichuan 70.0 Guangdong 530.0 Hubei 20.0 Heilongjiang 22.0 Chahar 258.9 Xinjiang 120.5 Statistics 21,0665 6,955.3 mu According to the above statistics, almost no province in the country does not find opium seedlings, and the number of counties that eradicated opium seedlings in the 18th year of the Republic of China doubled compared with the 17th year, but the amount of eradication decreased by 33%. The reason may be that the eradication is not strong, or both must be one. As for the planting status of various provinces in recent years, it can be briefly described as follows: (1) Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, which have become famine-stricken, believe that the famine in Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, which is rare in the past 100 years, chewing grass and cannibalizing people to fill a hungry stomach is unbearable to witness. However, the reason is that the fertile land in the three provinces is mostly planted with opium, resulting in a reduction in agricultural production and a lack of food. According to the experience of the China Foreign Relief Association, in the past, famine relief only required silver coins to be remitted to the disaster area, and food could be purchased from various provinces. Now, it is not the case. The required grains must be directly transported to be sufficient. Because these provinces usually plant too much opium, the production of food is reduced. Once a famine occurs, even if there are millions of gold coins, it is difficult to obtain a large amount of millet and wheat to save them. This is truly heartbreaking and can realize the great harm of planting opium. According to the investigation of our association, the Drug Administration Bureau of Henan Province clearly is an agency for collecting opium taxes. It was cancelled in the 17th year of the Republic of China and restored in the 19th year. This agency collects opium seedling tax of 8 to 15 yuan per mu. Opium seedlings are rarely found in counties near Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Opium is also planted in rural Luoyang. As for other counties such as Biyang, Luoning, Luoshan, Weishi, Mengxian, and Xinxiang, opium seedlings have not been eradicated in the territory. As for the planting and tax collection of opium in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, the situation is similar, but the transportation is more inconvenient than in Henan, and more opium is planted for transportation. Xia (as in the original) county in Shaanxi reported that more than 7,000 mu of land were planted with opium and paid land tax, and the land tax was more than 13 yuan per mu. The other counties can be known. In Gansu, the opium tax was 150,000 yuan last year (19th year), and it was increased by 150,000 yuan again last year (19th year). Based on this, it can be inferred that the number of opium planting should be no less. (2) Shandong, where bandits are rampant: At the time of the May 3rd Massacre, the Japanese army forcibly occupied Jinan and seized political power, resulting in the growth of bandits in the northeastern counties of Shandong Province. The opium legacy of the warlord era was taken over by the bandits to collect taxes and could not be eradicated. After the recovery of Jinan, the provincial government unified, but the vitality was lost and it was difficult to suppress bandits. Recently, although the Shandong Provincial Government issued a strict prohibition on opium planting, the government's decrees still do not reach the land where bandits and the Red Spear Society are prevalent, and the people still plant opium without fear. (3) Hubei and Hunan, which have special taxes: Hubei and Hunan provinces were originally opium-free areas, and they have never planted opium. One is that they are not afraid of this, and the other is that they do not need to seek it from afar because they are close to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Kunming. According to the survey in 1929, opium seedlings were also found, but there were very few. Because the special tax relationship between the two lakes is very large, the income from the soil tax and opium tax that passes through the Han River is very large, so the seedling tax is not levied. In this special tax area of the two lakes, the two provincial governments completely ignore the opium prohibition and do not interfere with the discovery of opium seedlings. The areas where they are found are mostly farmers who spontaneously receive bribes from local officials, but they mostly focus on the transportation of opium and do not pay attention to the planting of opium. (4) Guangdong and Guangxi, where opium prohibition has been abolished: Guangdong originally had opium donations as the largest source of income for various miscellaneous taxes, and it has not been abolished yet. The name of the Opium Prohibition Bureau also exists, and the wind of opium smoking is very popular, so the demand for opium is also very high. However, there are very few opium seedlings planted. According to the survey, it is only in counties such as Yingde, Chenghai, Lianxian, Huaxian, and Gaoming. Guangxi's land is not suitable for planting opium, so there are also few opium seedlings. The situation of the abolition of opium prohibition is almost the same as in Guangdong. (5) Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, famous opium producing areas: Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan are special areas for opium production in China. Farmers who plant opium in the three provinces do not sell all of it. A small number are kept for their own use because opium smoking has become a habit, and the demand is the same as for rice and wheat. The collection of opium tax is mostly handled by local garrison troops, and the county governments add additional subsidy donations, so there is a lot of resentment. As for the surplus opium, it is transported to Hankou in large quantities and distributed to various provinces in the country, so opium from Sichuan and Yunnan floods the market. Transportation in Guizhou is even more inconvenient. According to the survey, the reason for planting opium in the province is actually because transportation is lighter and adjusts the economy of the whole province. Because Guizhou's grain production depends on foreign demand, if there are no agricultural by-products to offset it, the economy will collapse. Transportation is difficult, and opium is easier to export, so many people are happy to plant it. The government has tacitly approved it for the sake of the province's finances. (6) Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Shanxi, where eradication is almost complete: Opium seedlings revived in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Most of the opium seedlings in Jiangsu Province were in the counties north of the Yangtze River, and in Zhejiang Province, they were mostly in the areas east of Zhejiang. In the 17th year, the Zhejiang Provincial Government strictly implemented opium prohibition and eradicated opium seedlings vigorously. People did not dare to break the law, and all those who had them were eradicated. There were occasional discoveries in remote lakes and mountains where transportation was inconvenient, but they were purely for the sake of poor rural people, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government had no tax collection. In the 19th year, the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association investigated the opium planting situation in Zhejiang. The result was that there was no opium seedling found in the 18 counties south of the Yangtze River and the 2 counties north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, and in the 13 counties in eastern and western Zhejiang Province in Zhejiang Province. As for Shanxi, it had been cleared up early in the years. The survey in the 17th year found some in Zuoyun and Yangqu counties. Jiangxi originally belonged to the opium transportation area, and very little opium was planted. The survey in the 17th year also found it only in Longnan and Yudu counties. In general, the scourge of trafficking and smoking narcotic drugs in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Shanxi is not less than in other provinces. If the opium seedlings are planted, they are more strictly prohibited than in other provinces. Even if they are found, they are rare. It can be concluded that. (7) Guandong, which is adjacent to bad neighbors: Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces have always planted very little opium. The Jilin authorities have never advocated opium planting and any opium tax, so there is no trace of it. According to recent surveys, the situation in Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces is slightly better than before, but opium seedlings are mostly found in areas with convenient transportation and lively areas. It is not known why this is the case. In the area bordering Russia in China, Russians have repeatedly violated the border and planted opium without authorization, which has repeatedly caused disputes. The Jilin opium planting survey only found a little in the forests of Fangzheng and Dunhua counties. (The following is omitted due to the loss of the original manuscript)</p>
<p>The Situation in Shanghai: The recent efforts of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to prohibit opium are due to two reasons: (1) Shanghai is the largest commercial port connecting China and foreign countries and is the hub for the transportation of drugs from the north and south provinces. (2) The concessions in Shanghai are often the escape routes for all those who commit crimes. The jurisdiction of the law and the police have not been recovered, and it is difficult to completely eliminate these situations. This situation is very complicated. The efforts of this bureau to prohibit drugs are three points: (1) Investigate and seize transportation agencies (2) Investigate and prohibit sales and smoking agencies (3) Investigate and prohibit the sowing of opium seedlings. There is no sowing of opium seedlings in Shanghai, so most of the opium cases investigated by this bureau are transportation and sales. The following is a report on the opium cases investigated and seized for transportation and sales in the full year of the 19th year and from January to March of the 20th year: In the 19th year, there were a total of 082 opium cases and a total of 1,795 opium criminals. From January to March of the 20th year, there were a total of 497 opium cases and a total of 720 opium criminals. All the above cases were transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for prosecution according to law after they were investigated and seized along with the physical evidence. Compared with the 1,678 opium prohibition cases and 2,406 opium criminals in the 18th year, it has been reduced by 24%. If this ratio is maintained, it can be completely eliminated within five years, but the concessions are an exception, so there is no considerable certainty.</p>

American Minister Johnson came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and went to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in the afternoon to meet with Mr. Pittman for several hours. Our reporter went to interview Mr. Pittman and Mr. Johnson yesterday and found that they were busy in a meeting.</p>
<p>Pittman's Talk Pittman declared that last year the US Senate passed a bill authorizing it to study the current commercial treaties between the United States and other countries and China, and to investigate the actual situation of Sino-US commerce. The Committee will make a report and make recommendations.</p>

<p>Convene an International Conference to Discuss National Silver Market Methods This report has been passed by the US Senate. Politicians and economists around the world almost universally recognize that the unnatural and tragic decline in silver prices has greatly undermined the purchasing power of more than half of the world's people, which is the main reason for the decline in world commerce. There are many ways to remedy this, but it is useless unless the governments of the world officially gather together to discuss practical methods. Our mission to China is nothing more than to study the facts and solicit opinions from the Chinese people. As for the talk of silver loans to China, Mr. Pittman should deny it.</p>

<p>Anlinde's Reception U.S. Commercial Counselor Anlinde hosted the delegation of senators at the office at No. 3 Guangdong Road yesterday afternoon, including Senators Oddie Robinson, Congressmen Dowell and Gibsen. Senator Pittman did not go. Those invited from the Chinese side included Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Bank of China, Li Fuxun, President of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Wei Tingtao of the Bank of Communications, Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, Xu Jianping, Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Guo Dehua, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Wu Jingxiong, Municipal Consultant of the Engineering Bureau, He Dekui, Organizer of the Engineering Bureau, Chen Liyan, General Secretary of the YMCA, and others. Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, will host on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Banking Circle Our reporter met with Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Bank of China, yesterday and asked about the trend of the International Silver Conference. According to the answer, the countries are still shirking responsibility for the position of the initiator of the International Silver Conference. It is still difficult to predict whether our country can assume the position of initiator. He and the US delegation of senators are only meeting for the first time, and our banking circles and the delegation of senators may not have a formal meeting. According to another source from the banking circle, the people in the banking circle do not intend to exchange opinions with the delegation of senators alone. They are now planning to concentrate the opinions of all parties and make a whole law proposal.</p>

<p>Xu Jigong's Grand Banquet Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Style of the Leader of the Japanese People's Party</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Xu Jigong, General Manager of the Great China Record Company, hosted a banquet for Mr. Miyazaki Ryusuke, the leader of the Japanese People's Party, and his wife, Ms. Byakuren, at the East Asia Restaurant yesterday afternoon. Dozens of guests from overseas Chinese and the press attended. During the banquet, Mr. Xu described Miyazaki Ryusuke's relationship with the Kuomintang and the intention of the welcome. Then, Mr. Miyazaki stood up and gave a speech, saying that he was honored to travel to China, attend the National Assembly, listen in, and visit Chairman Chiang to have a frank conversation about everything. At present, there are three factions in Japan that are the most influential. One is the extremist faction, which belongs to various labor groups. The second is the proletariat, which is the People's Party. The third is the Communist Party. The extremist faction and the Communist Party have a mutual background and the greatest potential. The proletarian party is oppressed by them, and the capitalists have no room to speak. The situation of the Chinese Kuomintang today is quite similar to that of the Japanese proletariat, so we hope that the Kuomintang will completely succeed in defeating everything and supporting the Japanese proletariat to overthrow the oppression of the Communist Party and the extremist faction. When I visited Chairman Chiang, I talked about the Guangdong incident. He said that this was an internal party dispute and he believed that it could be peaceful soon. I also said so. Finally, Huang Yanpei and others gave speeches, and the meeting did not end until 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e102">South China Shipping Resumes <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Releases Detained Ships</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Prepare to Resume Services</p>
<p>Yu Shun Released: The South China Shipping Line's "Yu Shun" ship, previously detained by the Guangdong authorities, has been approved for release, according to a telegram received yesterday by the bureau from the Guangzhou branch. The ship is expected to leave for Shanghai via Xiamen on June 2nd. However, the ship's machinery and boiler need to be repaired and cleaned before it can sail. Therefore, the China Merchants Bureau intends to have it repaired at the No. 8 Dock immediately after its arrival in Shanghai tomorrow. It will only be able to resume operations after the repairs are completed. The ship has been detained in Guangdong for a total of one month.</p>
<p>Cargo to Shantou and Xiamen: Ships to Xiamen from Shantou first unload cargo in Shantou. From mid-May, Chinese ships completely stopped going to Xiamen. The laying of mines began after May 20th, following the same procedure as in Shantou, with pilot launches only allowed to operate during the day. At night, the port is closed. As a result, Chinese ships have uniformly avoided both locations. A large quantity of miscellaneous grains purchased in Niuzhuang, Andong, Shanghai, and other places, whose shipment has been delayed, is now planned to be transported. Merchants from both regions first requested Shanghai-based Chinese shipping companies to charter British ships like the "Zhejiang" to transport the cargo from outside the ports of Shantou and Xiamen, to avoid detention. Yesterday, with the release of ships like the "Yu Shun" from Guangdong, merchants in Shantou and Xiamen changed their minds. They telegraphed the Guangdong authorities, requesting that Chinese ships be allowed to freely travel to Xiamen and Shantou without being detained, and that the restrictions on entry and exit times be followed. It is expected that Chinese ships can be dispatched directly upon their return, without the need to hire foreign ships as substitutes. It is reported that this matter is likely to be resolved, and South China shipping routes will soon be open.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Yesterday's Silk Factories Shut Down <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Three Major Reasons for Shutdown</p>
<p>Waiting for Public Bonds to Resume Operations</p>
<p>This municipality's silk factories have suffered greatly due to the sharp decline in raw silk sales to foreign firms last year, resulting in extremely low silk prices and high raw silk costs, leading to significant financial losses. Before last Lunar New Year's Eve, factories reduced shifts and stopped machinery due to lack of funds. This spring, silk merchants borrowed money from financial institutions against dry cocoon warehouse receipts to purchase cocoons and start production in order to maintain workers' livelihoods. At one point, over fifty factories resumed operations in Shanghai. However, the European and American silk markets became increasingly sluggish. Grade B silk was priced at only seven hundred and fifty to six hundred taels per bale, causing factories to lose three to four hundred taels per bale. Furthermore, the spring cocoon harvests in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were exceptionally poor. Consequently, the attitude of various manufacturers became increasingly negative, and more than twenty have announced shutdowns. As of yesterday (June 2nd), all one hundred and six silk factories in Shanghai have ceased operations, leaving tens of thousands of workers unemployed. The reasons for the shutdown are threefold: (1) Workers are demanding the restoration of previous wage levels starting June 1st. Given the current low silk prices and high raw silk costs, factory owners are already struggling to maintain the current situation and cannot bear additional burdens. (2) The spring cocoon harvests in Jiangsu and Zhejiang this year were exceptionally poor, with only thirty percent of the normal yield. The quality of the cocoons is poor, and the price is high, making it increasingly difficult to sustain silk production. (3) Financial conditions are extremely tight. Silk industry public bonds have not yet been issued, and silk factory leases are expiring. (Shanghai silk factory leases typically expire on June 1st each year.) Although six out of ten silk factories in Shanghai have renewed their leases, merchants are finding it difficult to raise capital and resume operations. Due to these three factors, all silk factories in Shanghai uniformly shut down yesterday. The resumption of work in various factories depends on the issuance of silk industry public bonds, after which about forty factories are expected to resume operations. Whether the remaining factories will resume operations depends on a bountiful summer cocoon harvest, sufficient raw material supply, and a global surge in silk prices.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Achievements of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Arrived in Manchuria Much Earlier Than Expected</p>
<p>Fixed Aircraft Routes Between Shanghai and Manchuria</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Manchuria flight operations began at the end of last month. A reporter from the Japanese "Daily News" visited the company's secretary, Sun Mutang, yesterday, who provided information on the route conditions and flight plans, as follows:</p>
<p>Triumphant News: The company received telegrams each time the plane reached a station. Four telegrams were received: (1) Nanjing, May 31st: "Eurasia 4 (aircraft number) flew north at 7:30." (2) Jinan, same day: "Eurasia 4 arrived at 10:30, departed at 10:50." (3) Peiping, same day: "Eurasia 4 arrived in Peiping at 3:15, switched to aircraft number 2, departed at 4:30 for Linxi." (4) Manzhouli, June 1st: "Eurasia arrived in Manzhouli at 10:20 due to favorable winds, circled once, landed safely. Eagerly viewed by various sectors." According to the company's schedule, the flight was supposed to arrive in Manzhouli at 12:00 noon on June 1st. However, it arrived as early as 10:20, one hour and forty minutes ahead of schedule, which was truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Fixed Aircraft Routes: The company uses aircraft numbers 1 and 2 for the Peiping-Manchuria line, because the route from Shanghai to Peiping is shorter and more stable, while the route from Peiping to Manzhouli is longer and has colder weather. Aircraft numbers 3 and 4 are used for the Shanghai-Peiping line. The engines of aircraft 1 and 2 are more powerful than those of aircraft 3 and 4. Aircraft 1 and 2 will be used to continue from Peiping to Manzhouli instead of Aircraft 3 and 4, and the same is also applicable to the transition from Manzhouli to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Returning to Shanghai Today: Aircraft number 4, which arrived in Peiping on May 31st, was replaced by aircraft number 3, which flew to Manzhouli. Aircraft number 2 departed from Manzhouli at 9:00 AM yesterday and returned to Peiping. Aircraft number 4 will then fly back to Shanghai early this morning, arriving at the Shanghai station at 1:30 PM. It is also reported that wireless telephone installations are underway at all locations, and the telephone at the Shanghai station will be completed within days.</p>

<p>Participation of Chinese and Foreign Boy Scouts</p>
<p>June 6th is the date for the citywide grand parade to prevent cholera, with the participation of Chinese and foreign Boy Scouts. Initiated by the Capital National Health Administration, the parade is jointly organized by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, the Health Bureau of the French Concession Municipal Council, the Harbor Quarantine Station, the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council, and the Shanghai British Boy Scout Association.

The illustrations are also clear and informative, showing how flies, unclean food, spittoons, and night soil buckets can transmit cholera. 300,000 leaflets have been printed for the Boy Scouts to distribute along the parade routes to the public. The slogans on the leaflets are: "Do not eat fruits contaminated by flies or filth! Do not eat raw, cold, or unboiled foods! Do not eat millet! Do not eat liangfen or arrowhead cakes! Do not eat ice cream made with unhygienic ice! Do not use natural ice! Prevent flies from coming into contact with your food! Do not overeat; eat in moderation!"</p>
<p>Fifty-Two Squads: The purpose of this parade is to raise awareness among the public about cholera prevention. The scope of the work is also wider than in previous years. The various models, flags, and slogans prepared for the parade are divided into fifty-two squads. In addition to over fifty police officers maintaining order along the route, the Boy Scouts will carry models made of paper and wood, representing filthy water, sickbeds, coffins, and clean water.

<p>Talks Before Leaving Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhou Zuomin, General Manager of Jin Cheng Bank, came south for the opening of his bank's Nanjing branch. He was then selected as a representative of Peiping to the National Assembly and attended the National Assembly. Now, he is traveling to Qingdao for the opening of his Qingdao branch. A reporter from the Continental Press went to interview him before his departure from Shanghai to inquire about the current situation. Mr. Zhou said that he is dedicated to the banking industry and his purpose is solely to develop China's commerce and finance. He has no opinions on politics and finance, as they are not within his scope. However, regarding the prosperity of Peiping, as he is also a special member of the committee, he believes that the future development of the former capital holds great promise. In the past six months alone, the population of Peiping has increased by more than 20,000 households. This is because Peiping is the most suitable place for residence, with a comfortable lifestyle, fair prices, pleasant climate, and developed education, which attracts people from all over who seek a comfortable life. In terms of education, Peiping University, Tsinghua University, and Yanjing University are all renowned institutions of higher learning, and leaders in the domestic education sector are striving to make Peiping an education center, concentrating renowned scholars and students from all over the country. Peiping occupies an extremely important position in the history of our country, with many historical sites that are valued by archaeologists and historians. Therefore, one can broaden one's knowledge in Peiping. Knowing the past allows one to predict the future. Another often-overlooked factor is that Peiping is the intersection point of our country's major railways, the terminus of the Han-Ping, Sui-Ping, and Liao-Ning railways. With the planned addition of warehouses along the various routes, Peiping can also become an important commercial center. Nearby is our country's best Longyan iron ore mine, in which an investment of 5 million US dollars has already been made in machinery alone. Those involved are actively progressing forward. To revitalize the market in Peiping, we should start by promoting local Peiping products, such as the globally renowned carpets and other famous handicrafts. If concerned individuals can work together, Peiping will not be difficult to leap into the ranks of our country's metropolitan cities.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Yangtze River Pilot Training Institute Awards Graduation Certificates Yesterday <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Navy Issues Instructions</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Pilot Training Institute, established by the Ministry of the Navy, held a certificate awarding ceremony at 2:00 PM yesterday at its location on Municipal Government Road, for the second examination in the Songhu area. The representatives from the Ministry of the Navy, including Wu Guangzong, Director of the Hydrographic Office, and representatives from various naval agencies, and over ten people attended. After the customary rituals, the Director of the Institute, She Zhenxing, delivered the opening remarks.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Director: This institute has held two certificate awarding ceremonies. The first class consisted of 249 qualified candidates, held last month. Today is the second, with a total of 79 candidates. Except for one student who needs to make up studies due to poor performance, the rest are all excellent. I am deeply gratified. Our country's pilotage rights have fallen into foreign hands, posing a great crisis to national defense. Therefore, the Ministry of the Navy is willing to spend huge sums annually to establish this institute, which bears a great mission, and you gentlemen have a great responsibility. I hope you will strive to win honor for the country.</p>
<p>Instructions from the Ministry of the Navy: The pilotage industry is of great importance to maritime power, military affairs, and commerce. Only nationals should be allowed to serve as pilots, which is a common practice in all countries. Since our country opened trade with various countries, our seaports and inland rivers have actually allowed foreigners to engage in this business, which is a case of the guest usurping the role of the host. It is painful to speak of the drawbacks. The Yangtze River basin is the heart of our country, where merchants gather and ships ply. If the leadership of navigation is taken away by foreigners for a long time, the loss of sovereignty will be the greatest. Moreover, the dangerous areas along the river are related to military secrets. If foreigners are allowed to spy at will, the danger will be even greater in the event of war. The Ministry of the Navy, in light of this, has specially established this institute to provide training, starting with the Yangtze River and gradually extending to other areas, in order to restore complete sovereignty. The pilots in the Songhu area are well aware of the above points. The Ministry has specifically appointed Wu Guangzong, Director of the Hydrographic Office, to deliver instructions at this examination and awarding ceremony. I would like to briefly state the purpose of establishing this institute and the responsibilities of the hydrographic personnel, hoping that everyone will bravely move forward and strive to actively recover the previously lost pilotage rights and take responsibility for them ourselves. This is what all patriotic compatriots should do under the rule of the party. The Ministry has high hopes.</p>
<p>Speech by the Director of the Hydrographic Office: This institute has not been established for long, and hundreds of people have already qualified in the examinations. The Director of the Institute has spent a lot of effort in promoting and guiding. The faculty is excellent, and you have been well-trained. The results of the examinations are excellent, which is commendable. The government is actively working to recover pilotage rights, and the need for pilotage talent is even more urgent. After completing your studies, you should strive to improve, seize this opportunity, work together, and quickly catch up to completely take over the pilotage rights. You have a glorious career, which is also what I hope for. After the speech, Director She presented certificates to the officers in order.</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Xin Case Support Association Announces Its Dissolution <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Following the serious injury inflicted on Mr. Xin Haishan, an employee of the Changhe Bank in this city, by a French patrolman's bullet on April 7th, a committee to support the Xin Haishan case was formed by various sectors to negotiate. Now that the French authorities have acknowledged our demands and the negotiations have concluded, the association announces its dissolution effective today. Yesterday, the association sent a special letter to the French Consul, urging him to report the resolution of the case to our government, and also prepared a document to report the details of the resolution to the Municipal Government for record. Excerpts of the original text are as follows: (1) Letter to the French Consul: "Regarding the case of the French patrolman No. 158 in your concession shooting Xin Haishan without cause on April 7th, the country was indignant. Since the incident, there has been no adequate relief measure, which has left a deep and negative impression on our friendly nations. Fortunately, after negotiations between Mr. Du Yuesheng, the Chinese taxpayer in the French Concession, and your consulate, it was agreed that in addition to bearing all medical and miscellaneous expenses for Mr. Xin's injuries, compensation for losses would be provided, a formal letter of apology would be issued, and the perpetrator would be suspended. The association has no objection to this plan. However, as this case has been formally negotiated by the government, we request that your consulate promptly inform our government of the above measures for the purpose of closure. We also hope that you will be deeply vigilant to prevent similar unfortunate incidents from happening again, so as to maintain the friendship between our nations and preserve the dignity of your country." (Omitted) (2) Document submitted to the Municipal Government: "Regarding the case of Mr. Xin Haishan, an employee of the Changhe Bank in this city, being seriously injured by a bullet fired by a French patrolman No. 158 of the French police on Yong'an Street on April 7th, the associated groups have submitted the circumstances and sent representatives to request serious negotiations. Now, after negotiations between Mr. Du Yuesheng of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession and the French Consul, the French authorities have agreed to bear all medical expenses for Mr. Xin's injuries, compensate for losses of one thousand yuan, and promise to apologize and punish the perpetrator. For the sake of peace, the associated groups have reluctantly agreed to end the matter. As the task has been completed, we announce the dissolution of the association effective today. In addition to informing the French Consul to promptly inform our government of the above resolution measures, we are submitting a document detailing the resolution to your government for record. This is for the public benefit." (3) Letter to the various groups: "Since the unfortunate occurrence of this case, we have been deeply grateful for the righteous indignation and support of all sectors. Now, after negotiations between Mr. Du Yuesheng and the representatives of the association and the French Consul, an agreement has been reached on compensation, apology, and punishment. The negotiations have come to an end. However, one hand is hard to clap, and a single tree cannot make a forest. If it were not for the solidarity of all sectors and the continuous support, it is unknown when this case would have been resolved. We are sending this letter to express our sincere thanks. Compensation and apology are only temporary measures of appeasement. Only by completely recovering the concessions can we eliminate the problems permanently. We urge our compatriots to rise up and strive for it."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Strike by Binding Workers Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The third strike by binding workers has been ongoing for five days. It continued yesterday. The following is a report of the situation from the Daily News and the New Voice News Agency:</p>
<p>Dispatching Enforcers: Yesterday morning, the union dispatched enforcement teams. Lu A'gen and Chen Qingfa were appointed as team leaders for the eastern district, Pu Jin Yuan and Feng Shaoquan for the southern district, Lu A'xiang and Lu Jianqiu for the western district, and Xue Lanxin, Shen Changjiang, Xia Songfu, Li Baolin, and Chen Zhitin for the northern district. Team members were selected from the members in various locations and were sent out to enforce order, advising workers not to take any extreme actions to prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to cause chaos.</p>
<p>Dismissal of Workers: Ma Hongji Binding Works on Zhizhi Garden Road suddenly dismissed three workers, including Zhou Xuechuan, yesterday. Zhou and others immediately reported this to the union. The reason for the dismissal is unknown. The workers will negotiate with Ma Hongji today. Mediation Today: The labor and management sides have not yet been in contact, and their attitudes are still quite distant. No one from the Social Bureau went to mediate. It is reported that mediation will begin today.</p>
<p>Workers' Declaration: Yesterday, the workers issued a declaration outlining their hardships, stating that the highest wage for workers is only seventeen or eighteen yuan, and as low as five or six yuan. There has been no increase in five years. After repeated appeals, the management initially agreed to a 10% raise, but how can this meager amount suffice? They pledge to increase wages by 40%. They have no choice but to strike to awaken the management when they give no sincere reply.</p>
<p>Binding Works Destroyed: Xinhua Yi Xin Records on East Huade Road, Shen Quan Ji on Rehe Road, Wang Quan Ji on Xiangshan Road, Xiehe Lujin Ji, and Lu Zhen Ji are still operating as usual yesterday. The striking workers found that these were breaking the strike discipline, so they went to question them. Arguments arose during the dialogue. The books in the above works that have not been completed have been vandalized. At Xinhua Yi Xin Records, there was also assault and injury to fellow workers. The guild has presented this to the party and government agencies for investigation and to uphold the hardship of businesses. According to guild sources, the striking workers each carried a bundle of incense and some even held long ingots when going to various works. It is not known what the purpose is.</p>

<p>In order to implement the Factory Inspection Law, the Ministry of Industry, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, established the Factory Inspection Personnel Training Institute. It sent telegrams to the provincial and municipal governments to recruit trainees and send them to the institute for training to meet the needs of the implementation of the Factory Law.

<h3 id="e118">Station Workers on Two Railways Request Improved Treatment <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Petition of 1,500 People</p>
<p>A total of 1,500 station workers, including switchmen, road workers, and others belonging to the Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, are all hired workers. As the cost of living has increased and it is difficult to cope, they request equal treatment. Therefore, they convened a joint petition of station workers from both railways to the Traffic Department Director and the Party and Union of the two railways, requesting that they take into consideration the circumstances and approve their request for one day of regular leave per month. This would not only allow them to rest their bodies and minds, but also to take care of family affairs. Sick leave and personal leave would decrease accordingly, and there would be no shortage of replacements for personal leave. The cost to the railway administration would be minimal, but the workers would be grateful for the benevolent policies.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Dachan Shipwreck to Be Arbitrated Immediately and Salvaged <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Obstructs Waterway, Forced to Be Salvaged</p>
<p>Arbitration Will Not Allow Further Delay</p>
<p>After the Dachan and Dahua ships collided outside of Wusong on April 14th, the Dachan ship sank. The losses of the ship have been verified by the Dahua Company, including 85,000 taels for the ship's hull, 11,000 taels for new repairs, 30,000 taels for one year of ship rental, 1,713 taels for ship equipment, 610 taels for ship crew wages, 50 yuan compensation for each of the 43 staff, totaling 1,581 and a half taels, 1,813 taels for the pensions of five deceased individuals, 1,620 taels for paid insurance fees, 12,000 taels for cargo losses, and 3,200 taels in losses at the Zhongxing Ship Rental Office, totaling over 140,000 taels. Because the arbitration has not yet been completed, the captain, first and second mates, engineers, and other crew members are still being paid monthly.</p>
<p>Arbitration in Progress: The responsibility for the sinking of the Dachan ship is said to be due to the error of the Dahua ship of Pingan Company, but Pingan is not responsible. The two sides have decided to request arbitration to determine the truth. Dahua has repeatedly urged, but Pingan has repeatedly delayed. Now, because the customs is urging a quick resolution to remove the sunken ship, Dahua has asked the shipping guild to urge Pingan Company to fulfill the arbitration. The arbitrators have been appointed by both sides, and the Shipping Association has scheduled a meeting next week to set the date for arbitration. According to the owner of Dahua, as soon as it is discussed next week, a verdict must be made and there must be no further delays.</p>
<p>Customs Salvage: Because the Dachan is sinking in a navigation channel, in accordance with Article 26 of the Maritime Law, the customs can salvage or blow it up. The customs has decided to salvage the sunken ship and has contacted the Tokyo Salvage Company. The salvage fee is 77,000 yen per day, equivalent to about 180,000 Shanghai dollars. A contract has been signed, and one-third has been paid in advance by the customs. The customs has also notified the Dahua Company that salvage will begin immediately, and the towing fee should be borne by the party responsible for the accident. Evidence of Negotiations: The Dahua Company cannot object to the salvage, but is worried that there will be nothing to base the arbitration on once the ship is salvaged and has sent a letter to customs requesting that the salvage be delayed. Customs rejected this request and replied Dahua saying that Japanese salvage technicians had been instructed to draw a picture of the ship as it sunk to prove the ship's position and damage, which will not affect the arbitration. Therefore, they will go to salvage the ship immediately.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Orders Full Refund</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has issued a letter stating that since the National Government clearly announced the exemption of fish tax and fishing industry tax, Dada Company's ships are still collecting fish tax inspection fees as before, which is a violation of the law. Therefore, the chamber specifically sent a letter to the company yesterday, ordering it to immediately stop collecting the fish tax inspection fees that have already been collected and refund them in full. Furthermore, the letter inquired as to which agency the company is collecting these taxes on behalf of, and requested that the company refuse to collect on behalf of any agency in accordance with the National Government's clear order. It also requested that the company investigate the agency that is privately entrusting the company to collect the taxes in violation of the order, so that a report can be submitted to the National Government for review.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Minutes of the Meeting of the Nanbang Rice Merchants' Association <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Nanbang Rice Merchants' Association convened a meeting of all members from various inland ports the day before yesterday at the Cuixiu Hall in the Yimiao Temple for their annual meeting. Members attending included Jin Zhongpu, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Qinsheng, Huang Shengyuan, Yang Yongyuan, Xu Yinfu, Pang Bosen, etc. Yan Xiaoquan was elected as chairman, Wang Disheng as recorder, and the meeting began with the usual formalities. The chairman then reported on the association's income and expenditure for the 19th year, followed by Xu Songda reading letters and documents from various places. Subsequently, various matters were discussed: (1) The association received a letter from the Tongli Rice Industry Association requesting the rectification of measuring rice with standard measures and postponement of the deadline. The association then forwarded the letter to the Doumi Industry Association, urging them to earnestly rectify the situation. Now, a repeated letter has been received. After deliberation, it was decided to extend the deadline by one day, making a total of three days. The question of whether to approve the extension for measuring rice with standard measures was put to a vote, and it was decided to allow an extension of one day. If rice merchants fail to measure rice with standard measures after the deadline, the salesmen and fellow inland traders, whose interests are at stake, should report to the association for strict urging. Rice merchants must measure rice with standard measures without delay. If rice merchants procrastinate, the association will notify the trade to temporarily suspend transactions to encourage them to reflect and maintain their interests. (2) The association received a letter from the Doumi Industry South Market Office requesting that inland traders ensure that the rice shipped to Shanghai is of uniform quality, with the same quality from top to bottom, and urging that hot rice not be loaded onto boats to avoid losses to both parties. The association decided that this practice, which dates back several decades, should be rectified voluntarily by inland traders to achieve effective cooperation between the domestic and foreign rice industries. The Wujiang Rice Industry Association will notify its members not to seek gains through luck and cause losses. (3) If any of our fellow traders incur losses due to the rising cost of goods in recent years, and thus find it difficult to sustain their business, and therefore submit a letter requesting an increase in commissions to supplement their income, how should we consider increasing commissions? The association decided to allow a discretionary increase of one point in the original commission, effective from June 1st. Commissions for sales made before May 31st will be settled in accordance with the previous rules to ensure clarity.</p>

<p>Li Guorui and Shen Lisheng both died</p>
<p>Sis Kotuo Quluo Arrested</p>
<p>The first battalion, first company, fourth platoon of the military police regiment stationed at the Suzhou Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway dispatched soldiers to a checkpoint at 7 p.m. the night before last, as usual, to patrol between Suzhou and Kunshan. At around 10 p.m., the first group of three soldiers, near the Weiting Station, noticed a suspicious figure pacing back and forth in front of them. The soldiers ordered the person to stop. However, it was late at night and the fog made it difficult to see clearly. Although the person stopped and raised both hands upon hearing the order, they were holding two loaded handguns in their hands, which were difficult to see from a distance. When the soldiers approached, they realized it was a Russian and were about to step forward to question him when the Russian pulled the trigger and fired four or five shots at the two soldiers in front. The two military police officers, Li Guoduan from Jiangxi and Shen Lisheng from Changzhou, were hit in vital areas and died on the spot. The military police officer behind them, upon hearing the gunfire in front, realized something had happened and stepped forward to pursue the suspect. However, the suspect had already fled. The officer immediately arranged for the two injured military police officers to be taken to Shanghai on a special night express train to Tongren Hospital for treatment. At the same time, he notified the garrisons at nearby stations to search for the suspect. At dawn yesterday morning, a Russian named Sis Kotuo Quluo was apprehended at Weiting in Kunshan and was considered a major suspect. He was immediately taken to the regimental headquarters for interrogation. The two injured soldiers died in the hospital yesterday afternoon due to their severe injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Careless Handling of Chemical Products at China Merchants Wharf <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Two Laborers Scalded</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 2nd), the China Merchants Wharf on Broadway had the Java Company's ship, Jema, unloading a large number of dangerous chemical products, such as sodium and caustic soda. At about 10:30 a.m., as the last item was being brought ashore, a box suddenly exploded, immediately spreading to the chemicals on the wharf. Flames soared and were impossible to approach. The warehouse and the ship were also affected. Although the crew and laborers poured water to extinguish the fire, it only made the fire worse. When the Fire Brigade arrived upon receiving the report, they used yellow sand, charcoal ash, and oil to extinguish the fire. It took fifteen minutes to extinguish the fire. During the firefighting, two laborers were scalded. One suffered severe burns on the head, arms, and body, while the other suffered minor burns. The scalded laborers were identified as Huang Yi, 34 years old, and Qu Jinwei, 23 years old, both from Jiangbei. They were sent to Tongren Hospital by the Hongkou Fire Brigade for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Li Guojun's Daughter Sues for Divorce from Her Husband <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Her Heartfelt Complaint is Moving</p>
<p>The Court Will Convene a Hearing Soon</p>
<p>Li Guojun, the granddaughter of the late Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang, has a daughter, Jia Zheng, who married Zhang Jin, the son of a Qing Dynasty General Zhang. Li and Zhang were originally old relatives, as Li Hongzhang's sister also married into the Zhang family, and Jia Zheng's aunt also married into the Zhang family. Because of the two generations of old relatives, Jia Wei was betrothed to Zhang Jin when she was five years old by her parents. They married in Shanghai on the 26th day of the eleventh lunar month in the 17th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the Zhang family's business was declining, and Jin Jiang was addicted to opium. Jia Zheng expressed her dissatisfaction, so her parents persuaded her and promised to give her a dowry of 20,000 yuan, with 8,000 yuan used to buy clothes and jewelry, and 12,000 yuan deposited in the bank to collect monthly interest to cover living expenses. After the marriage, Zhang Jin Jiang lived with his wife's family at No. 710 Xianyi Lane, New Chongqing Road. Last year, his father-in-law, Li Guojun, passed away, and Jin Jiang planned to take his wife back to their ancestral home in Hefei to take care of family affairs. The departure was scheduled for January 19th of this year, but Li expressed her dissatisfaction and left home on January 16th. At the same time, she was suffering from illness and was hospitalized. However, as a weak woman with no ability to earn a living, she found it difficult to make ends meet. Therefore, she filed a petition with the Special District Court, requesting that her stepmother, Jia Zheng, who was born out of wedlock, be given the 12,000 yuan deposited in her name by her father. The court held a hearing on the matter, but the case remained unresolved because both sides held different views. After Zhang Jin Jiang learned of his wife's whereabouts, he also filed a petition with the court, requesting an order for them to live together. A hearing was held in the mediation chamber on May 27th. The defendant, Li Jia Zheng, was unable to attend due to illness and was represented by lawyer Ge Zhaoji, who stated that the defendant had left home on January 17th because she could not bear the plaintiff's abuse. Furthermore, the plaintiff had used obscene language to insult the defendant on the second night of their marriage (the plaintiff had said that he had seen the defendant's face as a prostitute standing on the street in front of the Xian Shi Company's door). The defendant was mentally devastated by this insult and requested a divorce. The judge examined the statements and ruled that mediation was not possible. Therefore, Li Jia Zheng, through lawyer Ge Zhaoji, again submitted a petition to the Special District Court yesterday, requesting a divorce. The petition was written in parallel prose style, written by Jia Zheng herself and revised by the lawyer. The petition stated that the defendant had many bad habits and did not provide for her support. Because mediation failed, she was suing for divorce. The petition stated: "I, a daughter of the famous Li clan, was betrothed to the Zhang family in my youth. Obeying my parents' orders and relying on the matchmaker's words, I looked forward to growing old together for a hundred years and had been married for three years. I have continued my studies, understand etiquette, treat my husband as an elder, and attend to family affairs diligently. I hoped to sing and follow in harmony, to compose good poems, and to have a harmonious family. How could I know that my husband, Zhang Jin Jiang, is of base character and perverse disposition, regarding money as dirt and addicted to gambling like life itself. He calls out at the gambling table and uses the opium den as his bedroom, indulging without awakening, neglecting his duty to provide for me. I have tried to dissuade him with kind words, but he resents my loyal advice. I rise early and sleep late, only to suppress my anger. My husband squanders his wealth, using my dowry to seek pleasure. He indulges in gambling and opium, but when his money is exhausted, he is unable to satisfy his desires. His reputation diminishes, and he becomes angry and resentful. His words are violent, like a mad dog. He comes and goes freely, like a wild horse that has escaped its reins. Even over the smallest matters, he becomes angry and violent, abusing me to the point of whipping me. Alas, even if I do not die of hunger and cold, I will die from the beatings. I am not a blade of grass or a tree, who has no heart. All who hear of this are saddened, and all who see this are grieved. Thinking of this, my heart is broken, and my mind is shattered. Because I have been humiliated too much and cannot bear to endure it any longer, I requested mediation for divorce on the fifteenth day of May. My husband did not appear and even fabricated false statements to sue me in court, concealing his own faults and blaming his wife for absconding. His heart is lost, and he has abandoned reason. There is no possibility of living together again. Although we are husband and wife in name, we are like enemies. Such an evil family is like being in hell. The laws of the country are strict and do not allow the abuse of wives. Justice is clear and should be sought from the authorities. I would rather freeze and starve to death than be beaten and humiliated. I beg you, Your Honor, with your clear judgment and iron face, to uphold justice and protect human rights. Therefore, I humbly submit this petition, requesting Your Honor to summon Zhang Jin Jiang to court and order a divorce, so as to uphold the laws of the country and respect women's rights. Your merit will be boundless, and your kindness will be deeply appreciated." It is said that the court has accepted the petition and will summon both parties to court for a hearing soon.</p>

<p>Four Seriously Injured, Two Minor Injuries</p>
<p>Boy Wang Sikai Crushed to Death</p>
<p>More than twenty south-facing bungalows on Zhongxing Road, east of the Dayang Bridge in Zhabei, were old and dilapidated. The landlord, Lu Quanfu, originally rented them to a Chen from Jiangbei to build houses. Now, the land has been sold to Hui Ji Xing Construction. Because Chen's lease has expired, all the dilapidated bungalows have been demolished one after another. However, the house at No. 1917, where Xie Mao Chen Kee Rice Store was located, was not relocated until yesterday. The store was temporarily opened opposite the Tanzhiwan Security Corps. It was planned that once the new building was completed at the original site, the store would be moved back. Unexpectedly, at about 2 p.m., before all the assets had been completely moved out, the Jiangbei children in the vicinity rushed in to pick up copper coins. With a crash, the house suddenly collapsed, and those inside were unable to escape in time and were either injured or crushed to death. A total of four people were seriously injured: Zhou Peishan, 53 years old, Wang Xiaoxianzi, 12 years old, Xiao Xiaobao, 12 years old (all male), and Han Cuilan, 16 years old (female).</p>
<p>The four people above were all rescued by the First Section Fire Brigade and sent to Pushan Hospital for treatment. However, those with more serious injuries may be in danger of losing their lives. Two people were slightly injured: Zhu Yinhua, 14 years old (female), and Chen Xiaolaohan, 11 years old (male). A boy named Wang Sikai, 12 years old, was crushed to death. The Fourth District Public Security Bureau has ordered Wang Shaoting, the land security officer of the Taiyang Temple police station, to report to the Shanghai Local Court today for an autopsy. It is said that the deceased child's father is named Wang Wenbin, 42 years old, and his mother is Ms. Xu. He has an eight-year-old sister and is from Yancheng, residing at No. 1933.</p>

<p>Plans to Return to Shanghai in Three Years</p>
<p>In recent years, adventurers traveling around the world passing through Shanghai have used cars, airplanes, sailboats, bicycles, walked, or rode horses, which is already common. Recently, two adventurous Russian youths among the foreign residents in Shanghai, inspired by the trend, have embarked on a grand endeavor to walk around the world. They departed at 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning, planning to return to Shanghai in three years. They are only carrying a unicycle with a car tire to facilitate pushing. The two, named Borovsky and Hiles Xing, are both strong athletes in the Russian community. Their planned route is to start from Shanghai and follow the railway line to the capital, cross the river to Tianjin, Beijing, and Shenyang, and then take the route through Korea to Japan and the Philippines. Then, they will return to the Asian continent, enter Europe via India, walk across the United States, and return to Shanghai, with the aim of strengthening their bodies and increasing their knowledge.</p>

<p>Liang Chengyu, a detective from the Second Squad of the General Inspection Office of the General Inspectorate, was suspected in the case of the robbery of 50,000 yuan worth of morphine from the home of Li Liansheng at No. 439 Male Lane, Chongqing Road. He was arrested by the police and reported to the Special District Local Court. After repeated court hearings, as previously reported, yesterday afternoon was the date scheduled for the verdict. The police escorted Liang to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. Judge Ge Zhiqin ascended the bench and declared Liang Chengyu not guilty. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, requested that the defendant remain in custody during the appeal period. Liang's lawyers, Ye Fukan, Yuan Yang'an, and Peng Jie, requested bail. As a result, bail was not allowed, and he was temporarily returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Chen Yadao and Others Appeal the Case of Selling Military Arms and Opium; Hearing Concluded <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yadao, Tang Lunpu, Wang Liding, and others from Ningbo traveled between Shanghai and Hankou to sell military arms and opium. The police investigated and seized four Mauser pistols and 300 yuan in banknotes from Tang Lunpu. Wang Xiaopu, a suspect, was also taken into custody. The Special District Local Court sentenced Wang Xiaopu not guilty, Chen and Tang to eight months imprisonment, and Wang Liding to six months imprisonment. The military arms were confiscated, and the banknotes were returned. However, Chen and Tang were not satisfied and hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Song Yuan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Higher Branch Court, along with judges Gao and Ye, held a hearing. The appellant Chen Yadao claimed that he had not privately sold handguns with Tang Lunpu, nor had he handed handguns to Wang Liding. As for the opium receipt seized from him, it was for a transaction between Hankou and Yichang and was not brought to Shanghai for sale. Tang Lunpu's statement was similar to Chen's. Wang Liding stated that the Mauser pistol seized from him was brought by Qiu Qiansheng, who had a feud with Chen Yadao and others, so he falsely implicated them after being arrested. The Western detective handling the case reported on the investigation process. Then, the debate began. First, Shen Xingxia, the lawyer representing the appellants, stated that the original trial's conviction of the appellants was based entirely on Wang Liding's statement obtained during the police investigation. However, the reliability and admissibility of the statement needed to be examined. The lawyer also presented two facts that blamed the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case for negligence. From this, he inferred that Wang Liding's statement might also be wrong. Finally, he requested that the judge carefully consider the various points mentioned in the statement. Gan Jingxian, the police lawyer, and the prosecutor then made their arguments. The presiding judge then declared the debate concluded and scheduled a public verdict. Chen Yadao and others were returned to police custody.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Hotel and Restaurant Industry Requests Repeal of Increased License Fees <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association Sent a Letter to the Public Works Department Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We have received a letter from the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association, which quoted Public Notice No. 4081 of the Public Works Department published on the 3rd of this month regarding the license fees for hotels and restaurants. In accordance with the resolution passed at the recent annual meeting of taxpayers, the new fees will be implemented from July 1st, with the fees for the first, second, and third classes being 100, 150, and 100 taels per quarter, respectively. The Chinese-operated restaurants in the Public Concession have been paying food and wine taxes in accordance with the department's regulations, and the department has issued licenses. Now, the department's notice only mentions restaurants and does not specify whether Chinese restaurants are subject to the revised regulations. It also states that it is in accordance with the resolution passed at the annual meeting of taxpayers, but it is not known whether this annual meeting of taxpayers includes your association. Such ambiguous language is not enough to inform the public and facilitate compliance. Therefore, we have attached a copy of the department's notice for your review and declare that the Chinese-operated restaurants unanimously deny bearing this heavy tax and earnestly request your association to argue on our behalf and continue to follow the old regulations. Furthermore, it is not known whether the restaurants mentioned in the notice refer only to those operated by foreign merchants or include both Chinese and foreign businesses. It is also not known whether your association has made a resolution on the annual meeting of taxpayers. We hope you will provide a reply." While this was being processed, the Shanghai Lower Hotel Industry Association also sent a letter, stating: "Public Notice No. 4081 of the Public Works Department, published on page 19 of the second issue of the Public Works Department's Chinese Gazette, dated April 30th of this year, states: 'Notice is hereby given that the department has decided to revise the license fees for all hotels and restaurants to be collected from July 1, 1931. The approved fee schedule is as follows: hotels, per quarter, first class 300 to 500 taels, second class 200 to 300 taels, third class 100 to 200 taels,' etc. Although it does not explicitly state whether it applies to Chinese or Westerners, it undoubtedly applies to all hotels in the concession. The quarterly license fees paid by our industry in recent years to the Public Works Department have been at the rates of up to 200 taels for first class, up to 90 taels for second class, and up to 60 taels for third class. Such tax rates are already excessive and do not match our business income. The Public Works Department is not unaware of the declining state of the hotel industry in the concession, which is on the verge of collapse. Therefore, they should find ways to reduce the tax burden to allow hotel merchants to recover slightly. However, instead, they suddenly increase the fees by five or six times, which is disappointing. At the beginning of this cooperation between the concession authorities and the citizens, all reforms should be carried out with the consent of both Chinese and Western taxpayers. If this move has not been agreed to by your association or passed, our industry cannot bear it. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to send a letter to the Public Works Department immediately, requesting the repeal of the fee increase notice and continue to collect fees at the old rates. Thank you for your public service."

<p>Situation After Cancellation of Contractor</p>
<p>The pig pre-slaughter inspection fee was previously handled by a contractor, who charged 10 cents per pig. Now, the city government has decided to take over the operation itself and collect the fee at the original rate, after notifying the public. From the first of this month, the Municipal Finance Bureau will issue fee certificates, and merchants can purchase certificates at any time. The Municipal Health Bureau will carry out the inspection based on the fee certificate held and then issue an inspection form. It is said that after the implementation yesterday, the north and south meat merchants have purchased more than 1,000 inspection fee certificates from various tax collection offices. The rumor that no certificates were purchased yesterday is not true.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Appeal of Stallholders at the Eight Immortals Bridge Market <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Request to Reduce Taxes and Licenses</p>
<p>The stallholders at the Eight Immortals Bridge Market sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, stating: "We respectfully submit this letter because we have previously sent a letter requesting your council to reduce the stall fees at the Eight Immortals Bridge Market. Because the reasons are complex, we fear that the previous letter was not detailed enough, so we are submitting another letter to explain the situation. We believe that your council has spent so much money and effort building the grand Eight Immortals Bridge Market for the sole purpose of revitalizing the vegetable market and increasing tax revenue. The stallholders also regard this as their only hope. However, since the announcement of the stall fees at the Eight Immortals Bridge, most of the large buyers have gone elsewhere, believing that the stall fees are so high that the selling prices must be higher. Therefore, they have all agreed to avoid the Eight Immortals Bridge Market. This is the first reason why the stallholders are affected. After the above situation has formed, the stallholders, because sales are not widespread, dare not import large quantities of goods. The burden is already heavy, so they cannot help but raise prices slightly. How could they know that sales would become increasingly scarce and goods would become increasingly scarce? At that time, even if they want to cut prices to attract customers, they are unable to do so. This is the second reason why the stallholders are affected. Because the stallholders are affected by this, those who are eager to find another way to make a living are gradually withdrawing from the Eight Immortals Bridge Market because the fees elsewhere are cheaper and sales are better. The remaining stallholders in the market feel increasingly lifeless. This is the third reason why the stallholders are affected. In summary, the stallholders are in a difficult situation and have no way to save themselves. They are forced to implore your council to follow the new example of reducing fees at the Public Concession vegetable market and temporarily reduce the fees to maintain the stallholders' initial livelihood. As for whether the vegetable market can prosper after the fee reduction, it is still another question. Some people may use the method of restricting the average number of donated licenses to adjust. Although the intention is good, it is still difficult to predict whether there will be any disadvantages. Even if it can be hoped to be successful, it cannot be done in a short period of time. Therefore, in order to alleviate the current difficulties, the stallholders propose that your council resolutely reduce the stall fees at the Eight Immortals Bridge Market first. Once the stall fees are reduced, the number of stallholders will inevitably increase. The Eight Immortals Bridge Market is solidly built, and the stallholders know that it is a long-term foundation. They only stay away because the fees are too high. If the stall fees are reduced, the enthusiasm of stallholders to apply will be expected. Although the above is not a comprehensive plan, it is enough to maintain the local area. We still ask the inspector to weigh the importance of the matter and implement it in advance, hoping to revitalize the market and benefit the people. We cannot express our respect and wishes enough." The representatives of all stallholders at the Eight Immortals Bridge Market, Wei Chunquan, Yu Ade, Chen Yunqing, Zhu Asan, Zhang Shaofu, Jin Xueqi, Zhu Yuxing, Cai Zhongfang, Wu Guanda, Song Xiaomao, etc., respectfully submit this letter to Mr. Fan Erdi, Inspector of the French Municipal Council.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Yongmei, a respected gentleman of Shanghai, recognizing the urgent need to promote and improve traditional Chinese medicine, invested a large sum to build a three-story Western-style building in the French Concession's South Chu Jia Bridge area to open the Wang Yuandao National Medicine Store. Preparations have taken over a year, and the interior decoration is quite luxurious. Mr. Gu Youyu, a prominent figure in the pharmaceutical industry with extensive knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine, has been hired as the store's manager. Consequently, the selection of raw materials is of the highest quality, especially the sliced medicinal herbs, pills, and powders, which are innovatively prepared using scientific methods. To ensure the quality of its products, the store has established a factory in Shanghai's western suburbs specifically for manufacturing. Additionally, a glue factory has been established on the banks of West Lake in Zhuzhou to prepare donkey-hide gelatin and other animal glues. Furthermore, seasonal fresh herbs are grown in the Longhua customs-free zone. The scale of this store's operations and the completeness of its facilities mark a new chapter in the history of the traditional Chinese medicine industry. It is reported that the store's official opening and business operations today are sure to be prosperous.</p>

<p>The Jiande Savings Association has been established for over a decade. Its original purpose was to improve society by promoting frugality and guiding savings. It is fundamentally different from other commercial savings associations. However, due to the name's emphasis on "savings," it is easily misunderstood by the public. Therefore, the committee convened last month to revise the articles of association in accordance with the Civil Code and renamed it the China Jiande Association, effective July 1st. Before that date, all member benefits and savings will be handled in accordance with the old regulations to maintain credibility. Notices have been widely distributed. In accordance with the new regulations, an election was held for the first board of directors on May 31st, with public counting of ballots at the association. The following twenty-five individuals were elected as the first board of directors: Wang Xiaoquan, Wang Yiting, Yang Xianfen, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Bingqian, Zhong Ketuo, Wang Binyan, Guan Ji'an, Hu Huisheng, Chai Yousheng, Feng Yunchu, Lu Fengzhu, Tu Kaizheng, Xia Yinggeng, Chen Gengyu, Chen Zhaoqi, Chen Zhongying, Zhang Yanling, Wang Gongkuan, Tan Yongye, Liu Huogong, Feng Bingnan, Hang Shijun, He Wuliang, and Chen Fukang. It is reported that Lan Ting and Tao Gongchen, among others, are the five alternate directors. The process of electing officers is currently underway.</p>

<p>Mr. Zheng Manqing recently traveled to Japan to participate in the Sino-Japanese Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting, as previously reported in this newspaper. While the exhibition featured many fine works collected by connoisseurs from both North and South China, there were also numerous contemporary pieces. The works from the South were generally considered superior to those from the North, while the Japanese works were relatively few. Empress Dowager Shōwa attended the exhibition and spent three hours viewing the pieces, expressing considerable appreciation. She selected four paintings for purchase, two from the North (one by Chen Baochen, Grand Tutor, and one by Zhou Yang'an) and two from the South (one by layman Zhang Honghui and one by Wu Zhongxiong). Furthermore, the Empress, princes, dukes, generals, and other dignitaries also visited the exhibition in succession. The Japanese government's emphasis on art is evident. They offered high praise for the works of the faculty and students of the Chinese Art Academy. Wang Yiting, Zhou Xiangyun, Wang Jiezhou, and others have already returned to China. It is reported that Manqing went to Osaka for a meeting and, eager to return to the academy, did not stay long. He returned to Shanghai yesterday aboard the Nagasaki Maru, where the entire faculty and student body lined the riverfront to welcome him, creating a grand scene. It is said that Manqing's travel diary from his Eastern journey will be published soon.</p>

<p>Happy Day, Longevity is Not Difficult</p>
<p>One Must Understand the Four Secrets to Health</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Education Center, in order to promote traditional morals and clarify local customs, held its second Grand Gathering of Elders yesterday afternoon at one o'clock. Prior to the event, the center printed pamphlets, registration forms, and distributed them to the district chiefs of the county, asking them to invite elders on their behalf. Simultaneously, advertisements were posted and oral announcements were made. As a result, a total of one hundred and thirty-eight elders, both men and women, from various districts arrived, leaning on canes and sticks. It was a grand occasion, welcoming over three hundred members of the public, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere. The venue was set up at the entrance of the center, with four colorful arches inscribed with "Sharing Extended Lifespans." On either side, the national flags and party flags fluttered in the wind. Upon entering, one reached the venue, with the slogans "Respect the Elderly as You Would Your Own Parents" and "Promote Traditional Morality" prominently displayed on the four walls. Two rows of long tables arranged in an "I" shape were set up for the elders to sit at. The stage was equipped with wireless telephones, phonographs, string and bamboo musical instruments, and other entertainment devices, demonstrating great thoughtfulness. The meeting began at half past one in the afternoon, with the center staff and students from the village normal school performing traditional Chinese music to welcome the guests. After the opening ceremony and formalities, Director Jin delivered the opening address, followed by welcoming speeches from Superintendent Zhu and District Chief Wu. Then, elder Tang Jundao delivered a speech on the harms of opium, gambling, alcohol, and lust. Chen Lianchen spoke on the importance of family education. Shen Yuebo, not accustomed to public speaking, asked Director Jin to convey his health-preserving experiences on his behalf, mainly focusing on four key points: (1) eat less, (2) moderate desires, (3) wake up early, and (4) exercise more and worry less. He also offered practical instructions on local customs and the promotion of traditional Chinese morals. In addition to opening the wireless telephone for audience participation, special refreshments were prepared. The First District Public Office and the cooperative attached to the center purchased high-quality towels and distributed them to all the elders present, creating an atmosphere of compassion and warmth in the quiet and bright countryside. The elders were full of energy, and the cheers resounded until after five o'clock, when the event ended with great satisfaction. It is reported that the ages of the participants were mostly above fifty, with the oldest being ninety-four years old.</p>
<h3 id="e142">One Man Killed in "Eating Tea and Settling Disputes" <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Qian Yutang, a Shaoxing native who sells pickled vegetables in Chongde Alley, West Coal Ash Road, in the southern part of the city, had two guests at his home the other day. Xu Amao, a neighbor who had a feud with Qian, came to Qian's door and cursed loudly, calling Qian a "turtle with open eyes" and saying that he took in male prostitutes for money. Qian found the words very offensive and argued with him. Since both parties had some rogue qualities, they agreed to "eat tea and settle disputes" at Ximen the next day (i.e., the afternoon of the 1st). At that time, each side gathered more than thirty people to reason with them. Someone intervened to mediate and ordered them to disperse and discuss it again to avoid causing trouble. As a result, a group of people could not cause trouble in the teahouse in the city, so they flocked to the front of Chang Le Teahouse in Wansheng Bridge outside Ximen and fought each other. Zhu Acai on Qian's side was beaten, seriously injured, and fell to the ground unconscious. The two sides, seeing that they had caused trouble, began to flee, but the Second District Police Station was close by. After receiving the news, it immediately ordered the chief police officer to arrive at the scene and arrest Xu Amao and eleven others injured by Xu: Yuan Aquan, Wang Yaoquan, Fu Afang, Shen Xinhe, Cao Dagui, Cao Dachun, Wang Amao, Yuan Ashi, Wang Guofan, and Zhao Axin. In addition, Qian and five others on Qian's side, Wang Ali, Xu Agou, Liu Xiaoshang, and Yuan Jinrong, were taken to the station along with the injured Zhu Acai. The others had fled. It was confirmed that Zhu Acai was seriously injured and was immediately sent to the Southeast Hospital of Nanyang Bridge for treatment. Unfortunately, the injury was so serious that he died at night. Yesterday, the Second District Police Station transferred the 16 people to the local court for detention and ordered Dong Jianqing, the 13th district bail, to report to the hospital for an autopsy. Prosecutor Zhao and others were commissioned to come to the scene and found that Zhu Acai died of injuries sustained during his lifetime, ordering the family to collect the body and wait for legal action.</p>

<p>Zhu Zishan, a 13-year-old boy from Jiangbei, who lived in a flat in Tan Jiaqiao, Zhabei, made a living selling fruit. Yesterday morning at around 10 a.m., he was carrying a basket into the city when he was suddenly struck by a sedan-style car driven by Tang Yongyan, a large construction merchant, at the intersection of Bazilu. The license plate was number 4583. The child was knocked to the ground, and his head was severely injured. The case was investigated by Chinese constables Nos. 2383, who recorded the car's license plate number. The injured child was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment but died at 5:30 p.m.</p>

He was immediately taken back to the police station, where the station chief questioned him about his origins. However, the child's speech was not very clear, and it was impossible to know his name and address. He was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for placement.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Detective Society's Detective Suspected of Extortion <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Previously, a Westerner established the Shanghai Detective and Security Association and set up branches in Qinghefang, widely advertising that its mission was to investigate cases on behalf of merchants and hire bodyguards, etc. Therefore, it hired a number of detectives. Later, due to internal disagreements, a lawsuit was once involved, which was reported in the newspaper. After the lawsuit was over, the association became silent, and everyone suspected that it had disappeared. However, only the Qinghefang branch disappeared, while the general office still exists, currently managed by Portuguese national Tarsha, who is responsible for everything. The detectives hired are of mixed quality. Many of them misunderstand the nature of the association as being equivalent to a public detective agency. Therefore, they also pose as detectives, swindling and oppressing, doing everything possible. Naive people do not understand the situation and dare not resist even if they are exploited. Xu Wenlian, a Tongzhou native currently residing at 41 Huishan Road, has been working as a detective for the association and specializes in fraud. The day before yesterday, at 3 p.m., he suddenly broke into the home of Yang Fuqing, a Taizhou native residing at 1514 East Jiaxing Road, accusing Yang of running a brothel privately and demanding 50 yuan. Yang and his wife, Xu, worked as servants at a certain Japanese residence and were familiar with Xu, so they refused to be intimidated. Xu actually took out the private handcuffs he was carrying and forcibly handcuffed Yang, claiming to take him to the police station. While walking along the road, he encountered Chinese constables No. 2771. Fearing exposure, Xu quickly removed the handcuffs. The constable had already seen it and inquired about the situation, arresting Xu and taking him to the Harbin Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court. Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned the police station's lawyer, who charged Xu with extortion, fraud, and obstruction of freedom, and presented the handcuffs as evidence. Yang Fuqing and his wife first recounted the course of events. Then, the police station presented Tarsha's written statement, claiming that the defendant was indeed a hired employee of the company, but that everything was non-compliant. Xu Wenlian blamed it on being drunk and requested leniency through his lawyer, Fan Gang. Judge Xiao sentenced him to two months in prison and confiscated the handcuffs.</p>

<p>Department Store Industry: The Department Store Trade Association, in order to oppose the Shanghai Municipal Government's regulations on business tax rates, sent a letter to the Tax Rules Research Institute, stating: "In the June 1st newspaper, it was reported that the Shanghai Municipal Business Tax Preparatory Office passed the 56th item of the city's business tax rate, reducing the tax rate for foreign goods to 0.2%, and the 59th item, reducing the tax rate for department stores to 0.3%. The imbalance and disparity are unfair. According to the June 2nd newspaper, the Hankou correspondent reported that the Ministry of Finance's Tax Letter No. 1946 opened to explain that the regulations on business tax should clearly define the scope of whether department stores in major commercial ports belong to the foreign goods industry. Based on the nature of department stores, they are actually an expanded business of Beijing-Guangzhou foreign goods. Therefore, business tax should be temporarily collected in accordance with the Beijing-Guangzhou foreign goods industry, etc. Therefore, the tax rate stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Government is obviously contrary to the Ministry of Finance's interpretation. Such discriminatory treatment is unfair, and our association can hardly recognize it. We hereby send a letter to request that the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau quickly revise it for public convenience."</p>
<p>Northern Goods Industry: The Northern Goods Trade Association was officially established on June 2nd. A general meeting was held on the second floor of the industry's market on Zhonghua Road.

<p>Shen Xinbai, a secret investigator stationed in Shanghai by the Central Party Headquarters, was familiar with a detective from the Ningbo Public Security Bureau. Last month, the detective came to Shanghai from Ningbo and entrusted Shen with secretly investigating the whereabouts of bandits, saying that Xian Sheng, the 13-year-old son of Chen Yunkun, a resident of Beilongshan Town, Ningbo, had been kidnapped by bandits. It was heard that Shen was hiding at sea and asked for a secret investigation. Shen then instructed his nephew, Shen Zhenguang, to pay attention at all times. On the 27th of last month, Zhenguang told his great-uncle that he had learned that he had met Wang Farong, a Shaoxing native, on the way, who was forced to go to the Tongshang Hotel and write a letter to Chen Yunkun in Longshan, informing him that the child was now in Shanghai and that he could quickly send someone with 50,000 yuan to Shanghai to redeem him. The contact point was the Waibaidu Bridge, otherwise he would be torn up. He knew that these people were the bandits in the case. Therefore, after writing the letter, he returned and reported to Shen Xinbai, who reported it to Lu Xiang, the captain of the Detective Team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. After investigating and confirming that the bandits and their accomplices were hiding in two locations, 1026 North Chengdu Road and 4 Rongyangli, Wuding Road, they began at 10 a.m. the day before yesterday to dispatch detectives to the New Gate Police Station and first went to North Chengdu Road to arrest five people, including Wang Farong, his mother Wang Shen, his wife Wang Zhang, his cousin Wang Huabin, and his brother-in-law Zhu Xiaoquan. Then they continued to Wuding Road and arrested Wang's concubine Wang Wu and Wang Jinshun. The whereabouts of the hostage were still unknown. Yesterday morning, the group of men and women were sent to the Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Tingqi conducted the trial. Shen Xinbai and his grandson came to the court to testify. After Lu Captain requested extradition for trial, Judge Wu questioned Wang Farong and others and ordered that the seven bandits, men and women, be handed over to Lu Captain to be taken to the Ningxian Local Court for trial in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3 id="e158">News Policy <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Huanruo</p>
<p>By Du Chaobin</p>
<p>News policy—this is a very fresh term, because no one in our country has ever discussed it. Among those in our country who are engaged in the news industry, few have researched journalism, and they are even more ignorant of the situation in international news circles. Therefore, the news policy, which is used by modern imperialists as a backing and vanguard tool in political diplomacy, is completely ignored. This is a very painful and dangerous thing.</p>
<p>Our country's repeated failures in the international arena over the years have all suffered from the news policies of the great powers. Because the current so-called news policy, as Mr. Huang Tianpeng said, has become a propaganda policy for international confrontation, which is then used by ambitious people as a tool of politics and a weapon of diplomacy. For example, the May 30th Massacre created by British imperialists in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the May 3rd Jinan Incident created by Japanese imperialists in the seventeenth year, and the countless traces of aggression left by imperialists. The truth of the matter is self-evident, but because of the toxins of imperialist news policies, the propaganda has turned black and white upside down, confusing the public, so that a fair judgment cannot be obtained and grievances cannot be redressed. The loss of our country without a news policy is so great. In order to adapt to the requirements of national survival, it is imperative for our country to build a sound news policy. As Mr. Huang Tianpeng said, with a news policy, we will have a voice to the outside world, and the toxins of foreigners' propaganda will have nowhere to work; with a news policy, the immature newspaper industry at home will have a correct path to follow and can gradually develop.</p>
<p>However, although the emergence of journalism education in our country has had more than ten years of history, the contributions of journalism scholars to the news industry are very small. Apart from Mr. Huang Tianpeng's amazing amount of writings, only Mr. Ge Gongzhen and Mr. Xu Baohuang have made some contributions. Besides these, there are no achievements that can be admired. The past ten years or so have been in such a state, lingering until recently, in the past two or three years, when there has been some vigorous atmosphere. Works on the experience of studying journalism have also appeared like stars in the summer night, wearing brilliant clothes, one by one. Now, the book (News Policy) by Mr. Du Chaobin that I want to introduce is one of the most dazzling.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into six chapters. At the beginning of the book, there are prefaces by Mr. Xie Liuyi, Mr. Ge Gongzhen, and Mr. Huang Tianpeng, all of whom have satisfactory criticisms of the book. The first chapter is the introduction, the second chapter is the origin of news policy, the third chapter is the current situation of news policy, the fourth chapter is the development of news policy, the fifth chapter is news policy and China, and the sixth chapter is the conclusion. After reading it chapter by chapter, I feel that this book is indeed worth reading. The narration is clear, the arguments are correct, and finally, the nationalistic news policy that our country's news industry should adopt is particularly the immortal point of this book. I would like to introduce the main points and values ​​of the book to readers chapter by chapter. I think those who care about the news industry will also be happy to hear about it.</p>
<p>The first chapter, Introduction. In this chapter, he explains the meaning and importance of news policy in great detail. Furthermore, he summarizes the current international news policies into two major categories: one is the news policy of various countries towards foreign countries, and the other is their news policy towards domestic affairs. The most noteworthy thing is that he divides the foreign news policies of various countries into three major factions:</p>
<p>(1) The news policy of capitalism, which uses high pressure as a means and aggression as a purpose.</p>
<p>(2) The news policy of socialism, which uses any means to achieve aggression.</p>
<p>(3) The news policy of nationalism, which uses peaceful struggle as a means to achieve independence, freedom, and equality.</p>
<p>Because the author clearly understands that the purposes of the red and white imperialists are the same, which is to give aggression to small and weak nations and harm the freedom and survival of small and weak nations, and believes that it is the most unreasonable news policy, it is definitely not the policy that our country, which is founded on the Three Principles of the People, should adopt. Therefore, he affirmatively said (Our country is trapped in the core of the news policies of capitalism and socialism, and its dangerous situation is unbearable to imagine. Apart from carrying forward and developing our nationalistic news policy, there is indeed no way to resist the powerful). And he said even more sincerely (Although the doomsday of the news policy of capitalism is not far away, the current situation is still in the hands of this force... Since our country cannot be outside of (the international community), we must use the news policy of nationalism to resist this fierce weapon, and we must also examine its situation in detail and carefully observe its functions, and think of ways to eliminate it. This is really a prescription for the right disease). It can be seen in what a dangerous state the position of our Chinese nation is in. The military and economic forces of the imperialists have come one after another to oppress us, and the toxins of their news policies are even more harmful, causing the loss of faith and understanding in the international community, so that we often suffer losses. Therefore, a news policy that fairly propagates the truth is what our country should urgently need to establish. The news policy that should be established is the nationalistic news policy that Mr. Du pointed out to us.</p>
<p>To be a mouthpiece for one's own nation and a tool for all the weak nations in the world to resist.</p>
<p>The second chapter, The Origin of News Policy. This chapter is further divided into three sections: one is the formation of news policy, the second is the elements of news policy, and the third is the merits and demerits of news policy. The formation of news policy is due to the rise of capital imperialism and the rapid progress of propaganda tools in scientific evolution. Therefore, the author said, "The poisonous flames of capital imperialism are rampant, and the sin is undeniable, but as a result, culture is progressing day by day, and people's wisdom is opening up day by day. The newspaper, which is the social teacher, is also prospering along with it." As for the elements of news policy, the author wrote this way: "The elements of news policy can be broadly said to be words and language, but strictly speaking, they can also be analyzed into several items such as being biased, unfaithful, and untrue." The author believes that "subjective emotional records in news writing and supplementary descriptions containing functions in language" are elements of news policy, because news policy must have subjective or functional opinions added. Because it has subjectivity and function, it is inevitable that there will be "partiality and bias," "unfaithfulness and untruthfulness," "partisanship," "fabrication of news," "inciting discord," "suppressing reason," and "painting clouds and supporting the moon" and other phenomena. Therefore, examples are given of the news issued by various news agencies under the control of the great powers. To sum it up in one sentence, it is nothing more than "selfishness." As for the merits and demerits of news policy, the author only refers to the news policy of the imperialists. The so-called merit refers to the help that the imperialists have gained from the news aggression policy, "so that their acquired irrational rights can be preserved, and the terrible doomsday will be postponed... It can even cover up their atrocities of massacring small and weak nations, causing the anti-revolutionary upsurge like a raging fire to decline." This is meritorious to the imperialists themselves. The so-called crime refers to the imperialists' use of this insidious and vicious news policy to control the small and weak nations in the world, making them unable to extricate themselves and blinding the ears and eyes of the international community, so that the cries of the small and weak nations cannot gain the sympathy of people from various countries, but instead regard the imperialists' tyrannical oppression as an appropriate arrangement. This is what the author considers to be the crime of news policy. However, it does not mention the nationalistic news policy that helps the small and weak nations that are oppressed in the depths of misery, which is a shortcoming of this chapter.</p>
<p>The third chapter, The Current Situation of News Policy. This chapter is divided into two sections. The first section explains the effects of the implementation of news policies by countries such as Britain and France at the beginning of the European War, "making Germany deeply hated by the people of the world before it suffered military defeats, and had to shoulder the notorious name of the culprit." Therefore, after the end of the European War, the great powers further used the conspiracy of their imperialist news policies to oppress the small and weak nations as much as possible. In order to make it easier for readers to understand the current situation of the news policies of the great powers, there is a detailed description of the recent international situation. The second section describes the tragic situation of various imperialists' news policies conquering small and weak nations and the increasingly popular and serious resistance of the awakened small and weak nations. Therefore, the news policies of the great powers will no longer be able to use their tricks and will face the doom.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter, The Prospects of News Policy, starts from the collapse of the Red and White</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The collapse of the two imperialisms and the "trustification" of the news industry prove the defeat of the great powers' news aggression policies. Furthermore, from "the Soviet Russia of communist countries falsely advocates the name of a news revolution policy and secretly conspires to confuse communist ideas" and "the news revolution policy rashly marches forward with a single will regardless of the conditions of its peers and society," it proves the unsuitability of the socialist news revolution policy. Moreover, from "No matter what nation, if it wants to survive on today's earth, it must have a strong and unyielding national characteristic and spirit. Otherwise, without the plunder of imperialism, it will be eliminated by natural selection. Therefore, the awakened nations have seen through this point and are focusing on cultivating the national spirit, and as for the news industry, they also advocate that it must be able to represent their national spirit as the best," it shows that the rise of the news self-reliance policy of nationalism is necessary and inevitable. Furthermore, according to the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People, the Great Harmony world, it explains that the news industry is advancing towards the trend of "news equality policy."</p>
<p>The fifth chapter, News Policy and China, explains that the underdevelopment of our country's news industry is caused by "internal factors" and "external factors," which has led to a cluster of crises in the future of the country and is still spreading with redoubled efforts. Based on the past undefeated experience, the first step in developing our country's news industry is to eliminate or break through the shackles of the news policies of the great powers. The most important methods are "promoting journalism education," "organizing a national news agency," and "self-manufacturing of printing tools." The narrative is correct and clear. Here is a brief summary.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter, Conclusion, explains the two aspects of the news industry's longitude and latitude. Finally, because "Our country is a giant among the weak and small nations, and the 1.134 billion oppressed people in the world are eagerly awaiting our country's rescue," it is determined that the news policies of imperialism and socialism are not the news policies that our country should adopt. At present, we must take on the responsibility of promoting the news self-reliance policy of nationalism.</p>
<p>The value of this book can be glimpsed from the above introduction of each chapter. The narration is clear and the arguments are correct, giving readers a very clear concept. As for the concise and sophisticated writing, it is even more so. The most brilliant and most suitable point for the current needs of our country in the entire book is that it proves from theory and facts that our country's news industry should adopt the news self-reliance policy of nationalism. Those who are interested in engaging in the news industry and who care about the news industry should have a copy at hand, which will be able to give you a lot of benefits in your career and knowledge. The publisher of the book is the Journalism Society of Fudan University, and the general sales office is the Guanghua Bookstore on Fourth Road. All major bookstores in various provinces and cities across the country also have distributors.</p>
<h3 id="e159">How to Be a Journalist <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Pingren</p>
<p>By Tian Lu, published by the United Bookstore</p>
<p>Because I am immersed in the dream of being a journalist, I often feel a pang of sadness when I walk past the entrance of Wangping Street. Although I have heard people hate the life of scissors, glue, and paste, and feel that this wastes the youth of a journalist, those of us who have not been immersed in this life always feel this way. This kind of sadness knows that every career must have its skills. Apart from pacing past the house in Baishi and looking blankly, I have never eagerly desired anything, because I know that I lack such skills.</p>
<p>When I passed by the bookstore, I saw that Mr. Huang Tianpeng, who has the most works on journalism, had written another book, "How to Be a Journalist." It's not thick, and this made my dream suddenly come back. Journalist—what a term worth cherishing! So I bought a copy. It's a book divided into nine chapters. He explores and instructs how to do it from all aspects of a journalist.</p>
<p>"Journalists have only relied on three things—scissors, glue, and red pen—to struggle for thousands of years to have today's position. Now, a pen is worth three thousand Mauser guns!"</p>
<p>Such a description reminds people of the life of a journalist.</p>
<p>The author also describes the position of a journalist very thoroughly. He said,</p>
<p>"Journalists are in the position of a third party. The only duty is to truthfully report the occurrence of a fact, regardless of its nature and its relationship with themselves. All facts that are most noticed and wanted to be known by the most readers should be faithfully recorded and impartially criticized, and no intention is allowed to exist in it. Therefore, the position of a journalist is transcendent in the company, independent in spirit, and objective in record." In modern times, our country has not yet recognized the position of journalists. In many cities and towns, it can be said that they respect journalists but are actually afraid of journalists, and a small part of journalists abuse their power—this is really due to a lack of understanding of the responsibilities of journalists.</p>
<p>If journalists want to guide the public to the right track, they must naturally have considerable self-cultivation. What they need is a healthy body, a lively and polite demeanor, abundant knowledge, specialized knowledge, a calm mind, ardent emotions, keen eyesight, a strong memory, agile wrists, diligent habits, a newsworthy nose for association, beautiful writing, moral cultivation, and a dignified personality. These are indeed qualifications that journalists cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Among the responsibilities of a journalist, the author lists the indispensable conditions, and the most important condition is to personally experience the "news battlefield," to be familiar with the situation of society, and to have extensive connections so that interviewing is easy, as well as to "understand the correct facts and have newsworthy principles."</p>
<p>In this book, it is not just demanding that the journalist have considerable qualifications, bear considerable responsibilities, and receive considerable education. At the same time, it also pays attention to the treatment of journalists. The book imagines ten items for the independence of personality, the protection of the profession, the improvement of position, public welfare facilities, mutual assistance among colleagues, preferential treatment, legal provisions, publication rules, insurance preparation, and others. Finally, it says, "What I said above is a speech at a journalist association, so it seems to be based on the journalists themselves and seems to have an antagonistic meaning with the capitalists. Actually, it is not. If the journalists themselves have a perfect organization, there will be greater achievements in the business. If the capitalists can recognize this point, it will be a good opportunity for labor-capital cooperation, and I believe that the news industry will have greater progress."</p>
<p>In addition to the main text, there are appendices (1) "How to Be a Journalist Reader," which details why to read newspapers, how to read newspapers, and what are the benefits of reading newspapers, (2) "An Autobiography of a Journalist," which shows the author's entire career as a journalist to the world.</p>
<p>In short, this book guides young people who want to enter the news industry in the right way. At the same time, only those who have a background in journalism can write such a clear and essential book. This is the author's latest contribution.</p>

<p>Speed is About 99% of the Speed of Light, Able to Increase the Body's Resistance to Fungi</p>
<p>New York News: The world's largest X-ray machine, known as the world's largest, will be installed in the New York Hospital. Previous X-ray machines were limited to 200,000 to 300,000 watts. This new machine has a power of 900,000 watts. The electricity emitted by it travels at a speed of 184,000 miles per second. Its speed has the greatest speed in the universe, about 99% of the speed of light. The bulbs used in this machine are two, each with a length of 12 feet and a diameter of 20 feet. The power of light can pass through a 3-millimeter copper plate and penetrate 4 inches of iron, and the X-ray photography is clear. When used on the human body, the temperature inside the human body rises to 107 degrees Fahrenheit. With this high temperature, fungi will be extinct. However, whether malignant fungi such as tuberculosis and cancer will all be extinct has not yet been determined. The University of X-ray Medicine is currently conducting careful research and experiments on this. In addition, the effect of this machine is to increase the number of white blood cells at this high temperature to create a substance that resists fungi in the body.</p>
