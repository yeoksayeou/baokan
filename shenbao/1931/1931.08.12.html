<p>在這生産落後的中國、最要歡迎的，是實業家。在這外侮紛乘决心自救的中國，尤其要歡迎實業家，實業家是到處受人歡迎的，可是在産源豐富利未開發的地方，尤其要表示熱烈的歡迎。目下提倡殖邊事業的，都注意着西北地方，開發西北問題，在中國今日發展産業的策略上，確有研究的價值。所以西北的官民，最近感到財才的兩乏，都在熱烈的歡迎我們實業家，在工商半月刋三卷四號上，載着陜西建設廳，歡迎實業家一文，便是一個很好的證據，特爲摘要如下：</p>
<p>陜西土厚山高，藴藏至富，若延長之石油，若鎭安之銅鐵，若神木之番　，若鎭坪之石棉，若商縣之筆鉛，若横山之石板，能韓郃澄白同官永壽之煤炭，皆歷經中外人士之探訪調查，認爲含量最富而最有希望。陜民無偌大資本，僅以人力採取些微，以求蠅頭之利，不亦大可惜乎？關中棉花，推爲國産第一，涇渭流域，無處不宜植棉，而八百里間，曾無一新式巨大之紡織廠，以容納此原料，而衣被西北。使多數無告民衆、仍過其啼饑號寒之生活，不亦大可哀乎？牛羊牧畜，陜北最蕃，皮毛骨角，誰能利用？森林山貨，陜南最多，巖壑幽深，誰爲轉輸？龍門水力，拔山撼樹，利用發電，誰爲之創？米麥豆菽，無地不宜，該廠精造，誰爲之基？凡此種種，均陜西有利之事業，亦西北文明之發端。本廳職司建設，責在造産，睹刧後之餘灰，心驚巧婦，想來日之大難，思摹愚公，省庫空虚，旣無財以億中，民生疲憊，擬借資以成全。現備開鑛設廠之法，敬候被髮纓冠之救，對於有志實業之同胞，極表歡迎，如有心切富國志願投資者，請即指定，一項事業，或農或林，或工或礦，逕向本廳垂詢，自當詳細答復，即有親臨陜境，從事調查者，竭誠歡迎。</p>

<h3 id="c23">緊急之民食問題（二） <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>目前民食問題之嚴重。昨評旣已言之。然嵵眧何而後可以解决此嚴理問題。如何而後可以打破前途之大難。記者以爲應積極實施治標治本兩種方法。請先言治標。</p>
<p>一曰各省市縣應設立糧食委員會也。目前中央已有民食委員會之設立。但各省情形複雜。調查旣苦難周到。計劃亦感鞭長莫及。故各省縣市。應分别設立糧食委員會。切實調查各當地人民之消費量。現有食糧積儲量收穫量。及此次水災之損失量等。報告中央俾中央得按照各地實情。統籌全局。同時并秉承中央之指導。管理各當地之糧食支配·運輸·及價格等。以實現中央全部之政策與方案。二曰予糧食運輸上以充分之便利也。糧食運輸。稅吏之需索旣繁。舟車之運費亦高。每每由甲地運至乙地。加上稅捐與運費。價即昻增。飢民無力糴買。無補實際。故茲後各地轉運糧食。應豁免稅捐。并予以交通上之便利。使飢民得蒙受實惠。三曰禁止各省遏糶。奸商囤積·及糧食出口也。每值荒歲。各省對於食糧。即嚴分畛域。不准流通。致全國盈虚。不能調劑。瘠肥各别。益以毫無心肝之奸商。但求牟利。更落井下石。故意囤積多量之糧食。居奇昻糶。縮小升斗。剝削飢民。或更將其他雜糧轉運出口。售之外洋。此皆直接於民食有莫大影響。宜懸爲厲禁。四曰應吸收東北剩餘大豆及洋米也。東北大豆。産額極富。近年銷路鈍滯。屯積尤多。宜急予吸收。分配各省。又洋米亦應廣爲吸收。以資補助。五日應限制消耗也。米榖釀酒。消耗最多。據日本農學博士山崎百治之計算。我國之米。消耗於釀酒者。年約三千萬擔。小麥高粱等之消耗量。年亦達一千萬擔以上。此糧食之消耗者一。普通富裕之家。但求飲食之可口。對於碾米。力求精白。米之滋養部分。槪歸耗費。而損失碎米尤鉅。此糧食之消耗者二。又據調查報告。我國米之遭虫鼠菌損害者。年約在一千萬擔以上。此糧食之消耗者三。前者之消耗。政府應嚴厲禁止。而後兩者之消耗。亦應普遍勸導。并敎導人民以改良倉庫及儲藏之法。以减少鉅量之消耗。凡此五者。比治標之急救法也。</p>

<p>（三）港灣　（甲）大連港灣。（乙）旅順港。（丙）安東港灣。（丁）甘井子裝煤埠頭。此種港灣事業。爲滿鐵之命脈。亦即爲我國有鐵道之致命傷。葫蘆島港灣竣工何時。吾人實無日不企首以待。</p>
<p>（四）鑛山　（甲）撫順煤礦含有煤量在九億噸以上。（乙）烟台煤礦。煤量在二千萬噸以上。（丙）撫順重油礦。（關係日本工業與國防至大。）（丁）鞍山鐵礦。埋藏量達三億噸。（戊）復州之粘土。（已）旅順及龍頭大孤山之硅石。（庚）大石橋之苦士石。（辛）海城之滑石。凡此礦産。皆日人一手經營。日人得此多量之煤鐵。國内工業遂高枕無憂。迨重油岩發現。海軍又得一鉅大之助力。嗚呼我有煤鐵。任人攘奪。槍炮製成。復持以對我射擊。掠奪新權利。事之可痛。寗更逾此。言念及此。直不知淚泗之何從。</p>
<p>（五）農業　（甲）農事試騐塲。公主嶺設有總塲。另有熊岳城分塲。（乙）湯岡子亞爾加地試騐地。（丙）鄭家屯試作農塲。·（丁）鳳凰城烟草試作塲。（戊）長春·鐵嶺）遼陽·安東都設苗圃。近更擬增設擴充。以期壟斷東省農業。　農事試騐塲分種藝·農藝化學·病理昆蟲·畜産·園藝·養蠶·林業等各科。舉凡農業之氣温·擇地·耕種·肥料·昆蟲·選種·收穫·用途等。畜牧之種類·選種·疾疫等。以及農業畜牧業思想之普及。無不試騐研究。實行不遺餘力。而成效亦最大。近且與東洋拓植會社。集資五百萬。設立東亞勸業株式會社·專對於日韓人經營水田事業貸給資金。嗟乎。以日人之竭力經營。我東北大好農田·其將終不免於被人芸矣。</p>
<p>（六）電氣　共經營有大連·奉天·長春·安東·撫順·鞍山等地電氣事業。現已由南滿洲電氣株式會社獨立經營。</p>
<p>（七）旅館　滿鐵沿綫主要各地。都設有大和旅館。大連郊外之星浦。設有海濱旅館。旅館以在大連·奉天·者最爲完美。自一九二八年起。始移歸南滿洲旅館株式會社經營。</p>
<p>（八）瓦斯與窰業　經滿鐵會社培植穏固後。於一九二五年始脫離該會社。由南滿洲瓦斯會社與大連窰業會社獨立經營。</p>
<p>（九）助成其他各種會社　如南滿洲製糖會社。東亞勸業會社。春長交易所等。共三十餘會社。</p>
<p>（十）調查機關　該會社設有調查課。東京支社設有東亞經濟調查局。哈爾濱事務所。設有調查課·</p>
<p>（十）（一）出版圖書及定期刋物　内有許多秘笈。外國人不能購得。</p>
<p>（十）（二）其他地方設施　（甲）敎育設施費共一千二百萬餘元。營口·長春·遼陽·各有商業學校·撫順有工業實業所。熊岳城公主嶺各有農業學校。他如滿洲醫科大學。滿洲敎育專門學校。南滿洲工業專門學校。而中小學尤多。同時并津貼國人自辦學校。如瀋陽同文商業學校等八校。（乙）衛生設施有大連醫院。公主嶺居留民病院。遼陽鐵嶺等處陸軍醫院。安東營口兩處同仁醫院。吉林東洋醫院。此外設立公醫地點共有十二處。大連設有衛生研究所。（丙）警備設施。沿綫都有警備警消防警等。</p>
<p>吾人觀乎上述事業。條理萬端。無不包羅。其自謂具備國家諸機能。誠非虚語。蓋日人自攫得南滿鐵路及安奉鐵路而後。即無異於一隻鐵腕、遠自日本海中伸入我東北腹地。一切政治的經濟的勢力。即隨之以俱來。迄於今日。已根深蒂固。牢不可拔。吾人但聽南滿路上之汽笛聲。有如厲鬼之嘶鳴。此嗚嗚之嘶鳴中。實含有無限威脅與迫害之殺伐聲。國人其一止步傾耳聽。</p>
<p>割我土地。侵我主權。攘奪我寳庫。而日人乃更時時自炫其功。半澤玉成在外交時報上曾著論云。「……甚於此種關係爲一切之施設經營。滿蒙有今日之發展與隆昌者。實爲二十餘年之長歲月。二十餘億萬之投資。日鮮人百數十萬之努力所生之結晶品也」國人聽此。感想何如。</p>
<p>（五）南滿鐵道對於我國之迫害</p>
<p>南滿鐵道對於我國之迫害。就上述之滿鐵會社經營之事實而觀。即可覘知其大槪。今請作更進一步之分析。</p>
<h3 id="c64">（一）經濟的迫害 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>（甲）鐵道營業　一九二九年南滿路本線及支路之收入。共爲一二二·○三·七四二日元。得純利七四·八九○·二三五日元。即如一九三○年我東北自有九鐵路總收入爲六四·八八九·六三六元。而南滿路號爲較往年减收四分之一。其收入亦達九一·三○七·三五九日元。此鉅大之收入皆攫自我國鐵道。換言之。即鐵道營業給予我國之損失也。次之滿鐵對於我國之鐵道投資。共爲二二○·七八八·八六四日元。年息有七釐者。有五釐者。我國每年付出息金。爲數至鉅。而鐵道則大半實際操日人之手。任其支配。事事務求於日方有利。日方之利。即我方之損失。此一筆鉅大之損失。直無法算清。復次凡我國每次計劃建築新路線。日方輒多方阻撓使我計劃不得實現。其直接間接影響於我鐵道之營業及地方之開發者。損失尤鉅。</p>
<p>（乙）工商業營業　如電氣·製鐵·工廠·船舶·旅館等事業。直接奪取我利權。間接阻撓我工商業之發展。給予我國之損失。爲數至多。</p>
<p>（丙）各種礦業　如撫順之煤與重油。鞍山之鐵。皆爲無價之寳。此種損失。自直接間接兩方面言之。尤非數目字所能計清。</p>
<p>（丁）農業　如森林之開採。土地之收買。稻田之經營。食糧之取得。其影響我國民生計。損失亦多。</p>
<p>（戊）販買軍火及鴉片毒物　日韓浪人藉南滿路便利之交通及保護。販買軍火及鴉片毒物。入我内地。一面吸收我現金。一面更破壞我國民經濟。陷我國民生計於貧且弱。我國所受之損失。尤鉅且深。</p>
<h3 id="c65">（二）政治的迫害 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>（甲）附屬地　所謂附屬地。本爲鐵路用地。原光緒二十二年清廷與帝俄所訂立之東省鐵路公司合同中第六條有云。「凡該公司建造經理防護鐵路所必需之地。又於鐵路附近開採沙土石塊石灰等項所需之地。若係官地。由中國政府給予。不納地價。……或一次繳清。或按年向地主納租。由該公司自行籌欵付給。……由該公司一手經理。准其建造各種房屋工程。並設立電線自行經理專爲鐵路之用。」根據此條。則鐵路用地之取得與處理之權限。極爲顯明。凡鐵道必需之地。或由我官地給予。或由我民地租予。但皆必得我國之承認。决不能任意侵佔更絶無所謂「附屬地」其物者。而日本自繼承南滿路後。即巧立鐵路附屬地之名目。更統稱安奉路爲南路支線。無限侵佔鐵道兩側之我國士。計蜿蜒我東省南部一千九百四十餘里。（南滿幹線及其他支線）已無異於進攻我東省之防守戰線。而其兩側更擁有三十五萬二千餘畝之鐵路用地。（根據一九二九年統計調查）目前各路增築雙軌。兩旁界石。更時常向外移動。日事擴張。蠶食不已。侵佔之面積更難佔計。至於車站佔地之面積。逐年擴張。侵佔之畝數。尙未調查。但其數目字之鉅大。當更足令人咋舌。此日人違背昔日中俄所訂合同。侵佔我土地。給予我國之迫害也。</p>
<p>（乙）所謂附屬地之司法行政與警權根據中俄所訂合同第五條有云。「凡該鐵路所用之人。皆由中國政府設法保護。……所有鐵路地段命。盜。詞訟。等事。由地方官照約辦理。」則鐵道用地内之司法行政警察等權。槪爲中國自主。彰彰明甚。而日人則違棄條約。一律不容我國聞問。此蜿蜿我東省南部一千九百四十餘里之廣大面積。即無異禁地。即無異於日本國士。包庇罪犯。欺凌我國人民無所不用其極。鐵輪碾處。山河易色。我版士内任人横行。此日人違背合同。侵佔我司法行政警權。給予我國之迫害也。</p>
<p>（丙）武裝鐵道　滿鐵之沿線。都築有砲台。無線電台等。并有種種軍備之設施。而沿線駐軍更復不少。即如安奉路沿線所有之砲台。大小共有七十七座。平均每隔八里。即有一座。如此積極之軍事設備。武裝鐵道。其用心蓋可想見。至於皇姑屯之暴行。「鬼門關」（即三孔橋。爲遼寗省城與鐵道以北必經之孔道。）之兇惡·則更尤其小焉者耳。（未完）</p>

<p>商震出發前之障碍</p>
<p>孫楚等搗亂之狡謀</p>
<p>北平通信、自石友三叛變之初、駐晉各軍、究持若何態度、亟爲舉國所注意、當石部行將潰滅之際、太原市上、忽有倒商之空氣、凡此種種、事前事後、均與大局有甚大關係、茲經多方探訪、乃得悉個中眞象、爰略述以告國人、</p>
<p>當石友三叛變尙在醖釀之際、風傳晉軍各將領、皆與有聨絡、迨石部動員、石果派代表王毓秀黃廣源於七月二十三四兩日到并、下榻於孫楚家中、同日晉軍將領、即召集秘密會議、除商震外、凡晉系將領、全部列席、并邀宋哲元到會、祗以關防嚴密、會議内容不詳、事後微聞因宋哲元無明確表示、晉將領乃暫持冷靜態度、石代表怏怏而返、及二十七日、徐永昌自平返并、晉系各將領、又數度集議、一時太原市上、謠言復起、後聞所以未敢遽動者、實以宋哲元與石友三過去之歷史關係、不願與石合作、又以商震部之高鴻文黃光華兩旅、堅持反石態度、爲其主要之原因、</p>
<p>在此種情形之下、晉主席商震、已奉電令、着即率部出關討石、藉减少戰爭時日、時商震部除高黃兩旅外、尙有楊效歐部之周思誠一旅、商震旣决計遵令出兵討石、乃表面上一言不發、每日省府公餘、即赴郊外新闢之高爾夫球塲作球戲、以示鎭靜、迨至午夜、則積極作出軍准備、准備旣妥、商氏乃分訪各將領、說明受命出發意旨、各將領中、無主張者有之、擁護中央者有之、利用商氏出關而覬覦其地位者有之、甚至陽示贊成而陰謀阻撓、以期置商氏於死地者亦有之、惟對商氏出兵問題、表面上一致贊助、并經公同决定、隨商氏出發之部隊、除高黃周三旅及原駐汾陽之趙協中團而外、並指定警備軍一旅·砲兵一團·騎兵一團、歸商震指揮、益以同時受命出動之高桂滋一師、合計約三萬人以上、先頭部隊爲原駐井陘之高鴻文旅、經於七月二十九日動員、三十一日下午三時、商震亦由太原出發督師、直取石莊正定、</p>
<p>據聞當晉軍進佔石莊時、石部初不知晉軍實際情况、張慌逃竄、時北路保定方順橋一帶、戰事正酣、石碜一方在前線指揮、忽接後方報告、謂商震率晉軍佔領石莊、乃異常驚恐、適前方又復不利、當即下令退却、離開平漢線、向東潰竄、其實商部到石莊者、不過兩旅一師、後方部隊、則多爲别部晉軍所阻撓、如周思誠旅已由長治開動、爲楊效歐所阻、趙協中團、已由汾陽到達文水、又爲孫楚所阻、皆折回原防、警備軍及周玳所屬之砲兵、更坐視不動、在晉之航空隊、并爲李服膺軍隊包圍繳械、不得赴前方助戰、即三十二軍後方軍用品、亦被截留、使當時石友三調一旅之衆回援石莊、則戰事勝敗、尙未可料也、</p>
<p>當徐永昌自平回并時、太原即有徐將繼任省府主席之說、迄商震率隊出發、省府主席、照例由財廳長仇曾詒代理、乃晉將領孫楚李服膺等、欲擁徐以自重、始擬假借全體名義、電請中央命徐主晉、繼以内部意餐不一、乃轉而假借民意、於是始有八月四日太原市政公所之各界談話會、及五日下午中山公園之公民大會、</p>
<p>八月四日之市政公所談話會、由孫楚李服膺等、出名邀集各界代表出席、開會時由馬駿主席、報告商氏主晉無若何成績、决議發起於五日下午開公民大會、主要份子、爲馬駿高步靑張漢傑李服膺李潤發等、公民大會通過議案、如反對私調晉軍、反對提取現欵、反對警備軍出省、請徐永昌暫維持晉省軍政等等、所謂調兵提欵、意在攻訐商氏、實則商震調兵、係奉中央明令、至軍隊開拔費、則全係領自副司令部、並未動用省欵、或謂商氏在井陘曾獲有晉將領通石之文件、孫楚等恐商震戰勝歸來、對若輩有以裁制、又恐中央或因此而予以懲處、故倡門羅主義、拒絶商之軍隊出晉回晉、以便私圖、四五兩日、太原市上、軍用汽車運載軍用品不絶、可以證明孫楚李服膺等、確有軍事准備、惟晉軍内部、意見旣不一致、且南懼宋哲元之乘機相襲、故此時表面上仍似鎭靜、惟省黨部對於公民大會、認爲反動、已請省府設法制止、并將反動情形、電告中央矣、</p>

<p>漢口通信、武漢慘罹水災、迄今九日、水勢仍繼續增漲、各隄搶險、異常忙碌、排除積水、亦已施工、茲將連日情形、分誌如左、</p>
<p>襄江兩水續漲　武漢江水、平時約深三十餘尺、此次水災發生、逐日有漲無減、全市被淹後、江水深至五十尺零一寸、六日續漲一寸、七八兩日漲五寸、九日又漲寸許、共計五十尺零八寸、實超過從前紀錄、據海關報告及某工程師談話、如漲至五十尺零二十寸、其患將更不堪設想、市民創鉅痛深、聞此消息、甚爲惶恐、除富有者已紛紛離漢外、一般貧民、多無路可逃、惟有垂涕怨天而已、詎在此危急之際、而重慶來電、謂該處又突漲二丈四尺、岳州來電、亦謂漲水丈餘、襄陽自三日至六日漲水一丈、六日至九日、繼漲六尺、已同時東下、會流武漢、查江水各處均滿、故來勢頗緩、然巨量之水、江不能容、必又溢至岸上、武漢水災、蓋方興而未艾也、</p>
<p>分區搶救堤防　武漢堤防、因失於培修、向不甚固、此次水勢較大、故各堤皆呈險象、除丹水池單祠汀等堤業已潰决外、其餘各堤、隨時有潰决危險、如武昌通湘門外之賽湖堤、八日上午、上中段發現内裂、約長十丈、危險萬分、橋基亦漏水甚多、幸材料應手、員伕努力、當即打椿塞袋、轉危爲安、武豐堤大堤口一帶、品江茶樓後面、八日發現洞口、流水如注、亦經施工堵塞、又徐家棚上碼頭堤身、因水浸過久、内帮被冲、發現裂痕甚長、須打椿一排、計長一里、方能保固、現已派工三百名、日夜施救、至荒五里堤·靑山堤·等處缺口、亦已用沙包堵塞、漢口方面·皇經堂皮子街一帶、及太平洋肥皂廠·橋口·因襄水過猛、沙包已特别加高加厚、啞甲山東滑角險處、　家磯缺口、均在搶修中、此外張公祠堤、九日發現四洞、亦堵塞停妥、當無危險、防險處爲專責起見、特將武漢劃分、武昌由水利局主辦、建設廳會辦、漢口由市政府主辦、水利局會辦、俾各負責施工、</p>
<p>排除街市積水　漢市積水甚深、以小划爲交通利器、欵乃之聲、終日不絶、防險處爲早日恢復交通、决定築堤排洩、承辦者爲漢興昌營造廠、自七日起開始築堤、三日之間、老圃中山路特三區各地、已築成三百餘處、俟完全築成、再行排水、該處昨又令催該廠、加工趕築、謂倘逾限不能完工、災情擴大、商民損失益鉅、一切賠償責任、定惟該廠是問云云、武昌方面、雖未遭淹没、而積水之處甚多、經武昌城垣防水事務所、用機排洩、山後雲家橋文昌門一帶、九日業已排盡、山前平期門一帶、定十一日動工、</p>

<p>平漢交通近况　平漢路交通、因北段軍事、南段水災影響、中斷月餘、現北段軍事、已告一段落、而南段水勢、尙繼續增漲、路局路商、均蒙重大損失、該局委員長黃振興、極力計劃、於諶家磯江岸、暫僱輪船三艘、接渡旅客、輪渡開行時刻、原定每日上午七時三十六分、惟以南北交通初復、旅客甚多、所備火輪、不敷載運、爲避免旅客擁擠計、每一艘滿載、即先開行、並改定每晨每輪運送二次、其諶家磯以北火車、俟旅客送到登車後、始行開駛、直達信陽、以與九十二次混合列車、或二次特别快車啣接、直達北平、</p>
<p>建議疏濬長江　行營主任何成濬、以此次水災、雖係上游水量過多、而長江壅塞、不能盡量容納、亦爲最大原因之一、欲求一勞永逸、非從事疏江不可、聞已電請行政院、撥發庚欵一部、動工疏濬、以免沿江各省、再遭水患、又據防險督辦徐源泉氏語記者、疏江建堤、均爲治本工作、將來均須切實注意、目前則只能注重治標、現在各處險工、培修頗固、如水不再漲、當無危險、萬一仍如七八兩日、則尙屬可慮、據余觀察、現時交秋令、水勢或不再漲、但余無論如何、當始終盡力防範、人定未嘗不可以勝天也云云、（八月十日）</p>

<p>船已難望救出</p>
<p>旅客全部救起</p>
<p>買辦落海身死</p>
<p>此次海面發生颶風、上海各公司沿海輪船、均皆停航、而英商怡和洋行之南華班輪威升號、自香港來滬、因遇大風、在厦門外海面觸礁失事、船身損壞、已誌昨報、昨經記者赴各方面調查、得悉船已進水、而搭客則已救起、今日或可來滬、茲將續訊、分誌如下、</p>
<p>遇險情形　威升輪自港粤各埠、運載貨客來滬、在十日上午、船到厦門外海面、地名南灣（譯音）時、即遇海面颶風、船主霍希士爲安全起見、乃向該南灣海峽避風、詎料浪大水激、輪底觸入暗礁上、船底爲礁石觸破四大洞、海水即冲進船内、輪體下陷、形勢十分危險、</p>
<p>求救經過　該輪失事時、船主以直接發電、不能通達、乃先發到甚隆、再由基隆轉電滬港兩行、請予派船助救、滬行得報、急先發電基隆、請就近派輪往救、而香港總行得訊後、便令在港之恒生、駛赴南灣救援、</p>
<p>旅客救起　恒生開到南灣時、威升輪大艙已經浸水、行將下沉、以一時難以拖救出淺、祇得由恒生輪、放舢板船下海、到威升輪畔、將該船内全部搭客船員、完全救上恒生輪、然後開來上海、今日或可抵滬、</p>
<p>買辦落海　在威升失事之際、海面風浪極大、船上買辦一人、適由艙内出外、在甲板上、被海中打來一個大浪、該買辦竟被捲入海中、屍體尙無下落、雖由該船海員等、設法打撈、迄未獲得、</p>
<p>船身損失　查威升輪爲怡和南華班内之優級海輪、載重近三千噸、今次自香港廣東、經汕頭來滬、載來客貨頗多、據昨日該行電訊、總計船身貨物、及公私物品等損失、至少在百萬左右、</p>

<p>神怪武俠小說害人</p>
<p>預定計畫到峨嵋山</p>
<p>前夜出走不知何之</p>
<p>店主焦灼去者渺渺</p>
<p>今春三月、滬上有年方十餘齡之童子五人、看破紅塵、聨袂赴峨嵋山學道、一時傳爲奇談、幸其中一童年幼膽怯、不慣苦行、思家心切、時刻啼哭、卒爲其兄送之回家、而各童之家屬、亦於此時四出探尋若輩下落、旣見此幼童返來、其餘四人、亦即因循尋獲、修道雄心、遂爾未竟、諸童廻念前塵、或尙引爲憾事乎、不謂天下事無獨有偶、本埠又有五童迷戀吞劍吐丸騰雲駕霧之武俠邪說、結伴訪仙、入山學道、五童者均係學徒階級、衣衫不週、旅費無出、登程前各將衣衫質去、用資挹注、其最足令人發噱者、各童居然於首途之日、焚香燃燭、對神宣誓、如有畏葸不前、返悔食盟者、必遭天譴、五人行動如是、其中毒神怪邪說之深、可以想見、若輩於前晚出走、至今杳無音訊、身後亦了無長物、足資其店主之紀念、祇在破麻袋中、尋出「電影連環圖畫火燒紅蓮寺」二十餘小冊、此種圖文並重之武俠書、大槪即五童嚮道之出發點、敎育當局、對此種神怪參半之民間讀物、似宜加以切實之注意也、</p>
<p>五個學徒臭味相投　學道訪仙之五個伴侣、均係年約十七八歲之學徒、領袖陳鶴祥、年十九歲、洋雜貨店學徒、依次而下爲王連富·年十九歲·張賜官、年十九歲、張耀奎、年十八歲、耀生·年十七歲、以上除張耀奎外、均係甬籍、王連富·張賜官·爲楊雲興沙發作塲之學徒、地址在北山西路德安里八弄一百五十三號、張耀奎係北京路一七九號楊榮興木器店學徒、耀生則在雲笙泰沙發作塲學業、故此五人者、可謂年齡相仿、環境相同、思想方面、極易同趨一途、其中識字程度、當以陳鶴祥爲較高、故其求知亦要切、灌輸學道邪說、端在斯人、</p>
<p>亭子樓客指點羣徒　陳鶴祥前在厦門路寳興洋雜貨店學業、近因别圖發展、寄居於其友余鶴鳴處、余業草帽、其所住者、即楊雲興之亭子樓也、職是之故、乃得連富·賜官·耀奎·躍生·等各道侣時相過從、而楊雲興·楊榮興·及雲笙泰之店、又係楊雲笙一人所開者、於是此五個學徒見面聚談之時乃大多、加以時值炎夏、深夜納凉最是談講神怪之好機會、於是此一幕求道怪劇、從此醖釀成熟矣、此亭子樓房客陳鶴祥、胸中少識之無、又得談神說道之印象、平日最喜閱讀劍仙武俠等神怪小說、若封神榜、西游記·七劍十三俠·江湖奇俠傳·等、大都爛熟胸中、而於煉丹劍俠等法術、又爲心折、故開言閉口、莫不帶三分神怪之態、見王連富張賜官等兩人、即亂道明方謶誘以神怪之說、故三人若過未半月、王張兩學徒即由陳鶴祥之領導、而受武俠神怪之邪說洗禮、其第二步即由彼等傳染於張耀奎·耀生·兩人、從此五童同道、共冶於神怪一爐、</p>
<p>道童登程奇形怪狀　最近半個月來、五人之態度大變、行動乖秘、時相私議、如討論重大事件然者、五人中本以王連富爲最長、陳鶴祥次之、而王·陳（兩人又最莫逆、故此一小小團體中、乃奉兩人爲首領、而呼之曰老大老二、意即大世兄是也、陳老大除沉醉於神道中外、近又憂心國事、對於萬鮮慘案、大爲不平、間常口中喃喃、摩拳伸腿、詔其四徒、隠欲以神仙武俠救國諸童旣漫淫於火燒紅蓮寺等一類小說、大爲附和、亟欲入川求道、即於前日下午一時、羣在大門口對神宣誓、當時適有一學徒路過、隠聞其時爲「不願出發者、當被雷殛火焚、等語、至傍晚六時、此一行求仙道童、即在德安里總弄口會齊出發、據目擊者言、各童奇形怪狀、頗堪解頣、老大王連富、身穿白斜紋短衫褲、面有黑痣爲記、二世兄陳祥鶴、汗衫短褲、手執油紙扇、道貌儼然、老三張賜官、以藍布短衫褲爲道裝、一足穿破緞鞋、一足穿破布鞋、聞係臨行倉卒、致有此象、老四張耀奎、裝束如上、下着白帆布破跑鞋、口操江北音、爲其特徵、耀生年最幼、内雙眼特大爲殿軍、身穿洋紗衫褲、五君於夕陽西下、暮色倉茫中、一去不返、</p>
<p>店主焦灼四出尋訪　五童行後、店主因莫名其妙、以爲逃匿、焦灼莫可名狀、四出尋覓、不知下落、據謂此求道之五學徒、屢謂欲往四川峨嵋山去訪仙修道、並自陳伊之方針如下、由滬出發、步行至南車站、搭火車往杭州、如其地有名僧大俠、可以勾留者、即常住其地修仙、否則决計入川、訪仙人於峨嵋山、店主等初以爲戲語、不足介意、孰知竟成事實、五童旣去、同伴尋若輩遺物、一無所得、凡可質錢之衣衫、均已當去、充爲旅費、所餘者祗神怪小書數十冊、爲店主所痛心疾首者也、</p>

<p>— 絜非</p>
<p>今夏余附讀勵志社暑期學校。僦居中山門外國民革命軍遺族學校。該校　居四方城南崗上。當紫金山麓。中山陵巍然臨校左。風雨晨昏。東挹山色。北仰聖蹟。輒不勝其高山景行之思。爰記其梗槪。以誌鴻爪。</p>
<p>建築一瞥　該校籌備於民國十七年十一月。次年三月開學。十九年十二月男女分校。女校移城内羊皮巷。男校新建築已落成者大小凡三十六幢。費二十五萬元。皆古式平房。以中山堂位置中央。其餘諸屋。成衆星環拱之勢。若執信院。若伯先院。若克强院。皆其最著者。</p>
<p>學生生活　該校學生多陸續入學者。及今爲數逾四百人。其籍貫凡占十七省。北至綏遠。南達廣東。其中以湘籍爲最多。約占三分之一。江·浙·皖·等省次之。其年齡最大者二十。最小者五齡。其較長者。衣服皆躬自洗滌。凡一切費用咸免收。而課業生活用品。且多由學校發給。初發者爲被·褥·衣服、及箱·碗·等什物、續發者則有鞋·襪·肥皂岈　粉·牙刷·手巾等。由舍務課按月發給。並月給零用三元。然多存儲銀行。親戚贈品。亦以果餌·衣服·文具爲限。無休假。學生除特别事故外。終年留居校中。良以其父兄身爲國殤。家鮮蓋藏者。比比也。</p>
<p>親愛精誠　該校以親愛精誠爲校訓。拆爲八大目標。生活勞動化。行爲紀律化。精神平民化。體格武士化。思想科學化。興趣藝術化。組織社會化。學校家庭化余居之旣久。彌覺其中人頗能努力奉行云。</p>
<p>農村中心　該校校長爲蔣介石先生。敎務主任史襄哉先生。一坐而言起而行之士也倡農村敎育至力。思以該校爲農村中心。向外推廣。故該校初中。衹設農科。有農塲五百畝。蔬菜之屬。多學生躬自墾植。原田每每。綠蔭處處。朝夕採擷。以供服餌。尤其餘事也。</p>
<p>名人聨語　中山堂中懸黨國名人聨語甚多。胡漢民先生聨曰。「撫仁人烈士之遺。無德不報。進童齔少年於學。有志竟成。」戴傳賢先生聨曰。「莫忘賢父兄取義成仁。此日讀書須刻苦。要學大丈夫立身處世。他年努力衛邦家。」何應欽先生聨曰。「有廣厦千萬間。喜同坐春風。樂育英才資國用。願吾黨二三子。莫閒過白日。進修德業繼前賢。」仁者藹然之言。固令人感佩興奮無已也。</p>
<p>風景清新　該校居陵園範圍内。故大道盡闢。新舍遍植。而松柏成吟。藤蘿翳景。繁花滿畦。芳草盈澗。每令人渺然盡陂澤山林之思。當夫日出於東山之上。月曜乎夕城之間。對北　之陵園。迎南至之薰風。此景此情。一挈二三該校幼生。與話當年父兄躍馬殺賊時事。當又不勝其凄清動魄之情。躍然乎中懐矣。</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>松江天馬山。亦有奇塔一。高凡九層。迄於今僅有塔心。不可攀登其山。一望而知爲千年古塔。更奇者。此塔之最下二層。已有極大之裂縫。全塔作十五度傾圮之狀。而壧十年來。卒未倒場。旁有銀杏樹一株。幹可數抱。固老樹也。此樹之　枝。均向塔作彎曲狀。即嫩枝微葉。莫不同樣向北而面塔。於是一般鄉愚。咸謂此樹有神。而塔之不倒。亦有賴於樹之支撑云。此塔此樹。要不失爲奇物。因誌之。</p>

<p>昨晤陵海空軍總司令行營黨政委員會募賑專員譚延輝君於紅十字會。譚君甫由贛來。所述情形。足資記述。想亦關心時局者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>分别治理　贛省共有八十一縣。遭共匪蹂躙者有四十三縣之多。自蔣總司令親往剿共後。即組織陸海空軍總司令行營黨政委員會。素負聲望者爲委員。有匪各縣。克復後不受江西省政府節制。而歸該委員會統治。故刻下江西全省。屬於省政府管轄者。僅三十八縣。屬於委員會指揮者。已有四十四縣。（因原有四十三縣中有一縣地方遼闊已闢爲兩縣）分别治理。成效卓著。</p>
<p>三日一飛　蔣總司令此次赴贛。抱「有我無匪有匪無我」之决心。每次訓諭官長。即以此二語勵其前進作戰。因某團長畏縮不前。曾重懲以儆各師。因是軍心堅定。勇往直前。故所嚮披靡。蔣總司令雖駐節南昌。但關於前綫情况。瞭如指掌。每隔三日。必乘紅色飛機。飛往前方。親查陣綫。并面授機宜。各軍官長。因是甚爲感奮。左右僉謂飛機往來。頗爲觸目。時值盛夏。主席應稍休養。蔣總司令則謂爲將領應與士卒同甘苦。爲國盡瘁。軍人天職。仍照常三日一飛。</p>
<p>萬鍼穿心　前十八師師長張輝瓚慘死情形。已見各報。頃在共匪中招獲親見張師長被難之小匪。所述有外間所未悉者。據云張師長被獲後。匪勸其投降。不從。乃以鐵圈穿於鼻孔。牽而游街。并令其親信之差弁笞以皮鞭。誘以重利。張仍不從。訊以目的何在。據云祇期面見總司令。雖死何憾。匪笑謂之曰。可以辦到。乃令小匪往購縫衣之鍼十餘包。并佐冷水一碗。迫張吞服。張謂生不能面見總司令。死後望將遺骸送往。則死亦瞑目。匪允其請。乃將鍼吞服。少頃。面現白色。隨地亂滾。以手指心。慘不忍覩。蓋舊小說中所謂萬箭穿心。不過如是。匪視其死。乃割其首。置於板。放入河中。隨流而下。并笑指張首。謂現在可往見爾之總司令矣。其殘忍有如是者。</p>

<p>八號余到印度後。與印度各方面人接洽及·觀察。思想一變。一由印度文化及人士之要求。而知將來全亞洲民族文化刀合爲一大聨邦。再與美洲聨絡。成太平洋東亞聨邦。此不過時間問題决定演成此局。英儒偉而士已先言之。并云世界統一必在通中語與英語之民族。可謂智者。此計劃。多年前余有此觀念。而今受印人士之要求。須决定行之。二觀察甘地之運動與印度人生活。知改造社會。尤其在中國社會。印度之精神生活與精神運動之心力。甚適且於中國人之采取·若以之解决中國社會問題甚易。因文化分子有相近之點。蓋印度爲一大樹。而佛敎爲其一枝。東亞沐佛化數十矣。精神生活甚重。非俄國人之比也。三與回敎人接觸。知亞洲西南部之大勢力。乃在回敎。東至陜甘。西至歐洲。决不可輕視宗敎。不知其習慣心理。無從聨絡也。大抵宗敎問題。在歐美不在爲口頭禪。己成斜陽落日。即在亞洲回印關係十分之六七。全在宗敎。因嗜好不同。而起衡突。馬克司學說决不足以解决之。如印度人稱牛與回人衝突。毫無經濟上關係。純是習慣思想不同。請列寗到印度。不能强印度人食牛肉·至死不可變也。食牛肉而坐皇帝。印人决不爲也。此可見習慣信仰可變更生活。生活非全靠物質。即回耶二敎均有可采取者。日本武者小路新村。有佛徒及耶徒可證也。</p>
<p>沙彌語余。俄國制勝。由於地理。中國地理不如俄國。易受帝國主義之侵略。然則中國若不采取俄國制。而欲聨合全亞。則非比較研究中部之印度。化與西南部之回化。與東亞日本暹緬等之佛化。而合成一大聨邦不可。以立於歐聨美聨俄化三大之間矣。吾於印度化有所得。欲至土爾蔡皮斯研究回袄諸敎化風俗。必大有所得。尙未得往也。但若住印度人地方研究回化。印人不喜。即讀其書。印人亦不表同情也。民族心理之差如此。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>一宿無話。到得明天，小夥計就依着老闆娘的話，起了一個早，趕到鐵路飯店，守在門口，只等小榮出來，好喚他回去。</p>
<p>到了九點半鐘，果然瞧見小榮是同着那個漂亮的女人揚揚地從裏面走將出來了。小夥計就閃在一旁，等到他走出門來，却出其不意地走到　面前高聲地說：「老闆娘請你去！」</p>
<p>小榮一看是小夥計，心裏非常不高興，只是碍着丁小姐，不好發作，却做得輕描淡寫的說道：「知道了丨停一回我自己會來的，你先去吧！」他一面說，一面就向前走去，連頭也不回一回。</p>
<p>小夥計本來是不放他走的，後來一想，旣然小榮說停一回自己會回來，也就罷了。他就自顧回去覆命，眼看着小榮同了那個女人笑盈盈地走得遠了。</p>
<p>丁小姐就問：「方才來喚你的是誰？」</p>
<p>小榮做着鄙夷不屑的神情說：「又有誰呢？蘇州地方，我們的窮親戚窮朋友委實太多了，一聽得我從上海咽來，無非又要尋我借錢想法子啊！」說罷，又冷冷地笑了一聲。丁小姐也很相信。</p>
<p>小榮一想，停一會還是回去走一躺好，免得他們再來糾纒不清。一面又想，住的旅館非搬一處不可，免得再給他們尋到了。所以他就對丁小姐說：「我們到虎邱去玩了之後，回來京得搬一個旅館，否則難免我那些窮親戚窮朋友們又來尋我借錢想法子呢！」</p>
<p>丁小姐也覺得不錯。</p>
<p>眞的，從虎邱玩了因來，他們就從鐵路飯店搬了出來，住到了東吳旅館去；一面就吩咐着鐵路飯店的茶房，說是回到上海去了。</p>
<p>搬了旅館之後，他就打算回家去走一躺對丁小姐只說是「到方才那個來請他的親戚家裏去一會，大槪半小時就得咽來的。」</p>
<p>於是，他居然帶着憤怒的神情回到了自己的家中，走到裏邊，只看見他的父親和母親都一聲不響地坐着：他們看見小榮回來了，他的父親就立將起來。</p>
<p>「小榮！你倒舒服、！也不自己想想，你是什麽樣的一個人？」他拍着桌子氣吽吽地說。</p>
<p>小榮不響，居然還冷笑了一聲·</p>
<p>「你告訴我！那個女的是誰？我呌你到上海去是用功讀書的，不是呌你去吊膀子軋姘頭的！你告訴我，那個女的是誰？」他說話的聲音益發響了。</p>

<p>— 葛祥榮</p>
<p>這幾天天氣悶熱、昨天傍暮、我洗罷了澡、穿了短衣褲、拖了拖鞋、揮着一柄蒲扇、大邁步從屋内奔出來、揣了隻小竹椅、在後門坐定、享受着爽身的微風、</p>
<p>坐了祗一刻、對面馬路階沿上、人聲忽然嘈雜起來、我目光隨着聲處望去、看見一個人力車夫、正在指手劃脚的向着一羣各色人等的圍觀者訴述、旁邊站着一個西婦、那車夫邊說邊對着那西婦、用了講英文的語氣音調、嚷着、「銅錢、銅錢、」</p>
<p>我那時爲好奇心所驅使、又爲這事看去好像還帶些國際色彩似的、怱怱走入人叢中、一探究竟、原來是那個西婦、從法租界辣斐德路雇了他的車子、一直拖到我家所住的靜安寺路慕爾鳴路轉角來、這樣長的一段路、祗給他十六個銅元、似乎太少了、所以這個人力車夫啊啊不休的、想向她再加幾個、</p>
<p>一般的圍觀者、都以爲這等瑣事、原是司空見慣的、</p>
<p>有的呌他「媽媽虎虎」、</p>
<p>有的說「自己不好、喜歡拖外國人、平日我們喚他們的車子、理都不理、祗要外國人用手一招、他們就會興奮起來、兩臂一振、拚命的拖着空車到外國人跟前、陪笑伺候着、這種就呌好敎訓哩、」</p>
<p>有的略表同情說、「十六個銅元、拖這許多的路、未免太便宜了、」</p>
<p>大家七嘴八舌、亂表意見、莫衷一是、可是具體的解决方法、一個亦說不出、</p>
<p>這時候、那個西婦、呆立了多時、忽然衝出重圍、我急向她所衝的方向望去、看見來了個雄糾糾手挾小棒兒的外國兵、戴了頂夾扁帽兒、帽後沿拖了二根短飄帶、帽頂上一個紅球兒、很像我們所戴的瓜皮帽上的紅頂子、上身的軍衣、倒亦平常、下面可不對了、幾色的摺褲、上面又加上些怎麽小鏡子呀、馬　呀、脚上皮鞋上、包着包脚布、在未知道這是蘇格蘭的特殊裝飾的人們見了、一定會覺得些奇怪的、當時那西婦趨上前去、向他嘰嘰咕咕說了幾句後、我一聽大槪是一種反宣傳性質的話、那兵不問其他、一敬人力車夫、就是二小棒、一面還操着極難聽的中國話道、「看啥物事、去、去、」唬散一羣的圍觀者、他自己讓那西婦走在他前面、一路去了、我覺得這大槪就是他們唯一的天職、所謂「保護僑民」吧、</p>
<p>那個人力車夫、吃了一嚇後、見那外國兵去得遠了、口中咕囉着「利利媽媽、不講理的、洋鬼子、」虧他還把一顆腦袋一振、舌頭一伸、自顧自道、「嘿、老子怕他麽、」我一想、他上一句話是弱小民族的吭聲吧、下面的一句就是弱者的自慰語了、</p>
<p>當時一般圍看者、一哄而散、幾個胡調朋友、還笑嚷着、「要亡國了、要亡國了、」</p>
<p>我的貴隣居、那位平日愛說大話的王裁縫、原來他亦在着、聽了兩位胡調朋友的話、立刻擺出他那付自滿蔑人的姿勢、咕唸道、</p>
<p>「亡國、亡國、中國會亡嗎、你知道四川峨嵋山上有幾位仙師劍俠未下山呢、嘿、」</p>
<p>他自顧自還要往下說、却被一個孩子硬拖着去了、</p>
<p>我正在没好氣、呆立想着、忽聽得一個穿着極漂亮的西裝朋友、埋怨他的同伴道、</p>
<p>「密司脫王你怎會連這些事都要瞧個究竟、方才拖你不肯走、好了、不要再躭擱了、巧浦、巧浦、」</p>
<p>他那同伴一笑隨了他走去、我的目光隨着他們看去、見他們怱怱散步、跨入對面那個滿裝着紅綠燈、有穿白衣的西崽和含笑露臂的外國買票女子的小考而夫球塲去了、</p>
<p>我呌一聲慚愧、自言道、「這是摩登靑年的一千九百三十一年風行的新遊玩藝兒呀、莫怪那一個要這樣的急不及待了、」</p>
<p>當時我嗒然的走過這邊來、還没到後站嫬見隣居屋簷下、一羣小孩子、圍着那個王裁縫、都嘻哈個小嘴兒、十分得神有在聽王裁縫講「西遊記」故事、眞的坐得端端正正、目不轉睛的辨着味道兒、比在小學校中聽先生講書時、好像座位上生釘的不安神情、要强得多哩、還有幾個連家人喚吃夜飯、回着等一歇、我見了、一禁再來個慚愧、「不差、兒童敎育、」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Welcoming Industrialists: Pan Yang'an <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In China, a nation lagging in production, the most welcome are industrialists. In China, particularly now as it faces foreign aggression and is determined to save itself, industrialists are especially welcome. While industrialists are generally well-received, they should be greeted with particular enthusiasm in regions abundant in resources yet undeveloped. Currently, proponents of borderland development are focused on the Northwest. Developing the Northwest has genuine value for research in today's Chinese industrial development strategy. Therefore, officials and citizens in the Northwest are acutely aware of the lack of both funds and talent, and are eagerly welcoming our industrialists. A very good example of this is the article welcoming industrialists published by the Shaanxi Construction Bureau in the third volume, fourth issue of the "Industry and Commerce Semi-Monthly," excerpts of which are provided below:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province boasts fertile soil and high mountains, with extremely rich resources. For example, the petroleum in Yanchang, the copper and iron in Zhen'an, the alum in Shenmu, the asbestos in Zhenping, the graphite in Shangxian, the slate in Hengshan, and the coal in Neng, Han, He, Cheng, Bai, Tongguan, Yongshou—all have been explored and investigated by Chinese and foreign experts, who consider them to be very rich and promising deposits. The people of Shaanxi lack substantial capital, and only use manpower to extract small amounts for meager profits. Is this not a great pity? The cotton in Guanzhong is considered the best in the country. The Jing and Wei River basins are suitable for cotton planting everywhere, but there is not a single modern, large-scale textile factory in the eight hundred *li* area to use this raw material and clothe the Northwest. This leaves the majority of helpless people to continue living lives of hunger and cold. Is this not extremely lamentable? Shaanbei is the most abundant region for raising cattle and sheep. Who can utilize the hides, fur, bones, and horns? Southern Shaanxi has the most forests and mountain products. Who will transport them from the deep ravines? The water power of Longmen is capable of uprooting mountains and shaking trees. Who will create a hydroelectric power plant? Rice, wheat, beans, and soybeans are suitable for planting everywhere. Who will lay the foundation for building factories to produce them? All of these are beneficial industries for Shaanxi, and are also the beginning of Northwest civilization. The Bureau, responsible for construction, has a duty to create production. Witnessing the remaining ashes after the calamity, we are alarmed like a skilled woman; anticipating the great difficulties of the future, we emulate Yu Gong. The provincial treasury is empty, lacking funds to invest; the people's livelihood is exhausted, planning to borrow capital to accomplish it. We have now prepared methods for opening mines and establishing factories, and respectfully await rescue from those with disheveled hair and crowned heads [referring to people from all walks of life]. We extend a very warm welcome to fellow countrymen with ambitions in industry. If anyone is sincerely committed to enriching the country and willing to invest, please specify a project, whether agricultural, forestry, industrial, or mining, and inquire directly with this Bureau. We will provide detailed answers. We wholeheartedly welcome those who personally come to Shaanxi to conduct investigations.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Urgent Problem of People's Food (II) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The seriousness of the current food problem has already been stated in yesterday's commentary. But how can we solve this serious problem? How can we break through the great difficulty ahead? The reporter believes that we should actively implement both palliative and fundamental measures. Let us first talk about the palliative measures.</p>
<p>First, each province, city, and county should establish a food committee. Currently, a Food Committee has already been established at the central level. However, the situations in various provinces are complex, making thorough investigation difficult and plans difficult to execute effectively. Therefore, each province, county, and city should separately establish a food committee to thoroughly investigate the consumption of local people, the existing food reserves, the harvest amount, and the amount of loss in this flood, and report to the central government so that the central government can coordinate the overall situation according to the actual conditions of each place. At the same time, it should also follow the guidance of the central government to manage the local food distribution, transportation, and prices, so as to realize the central government's overall policies and plans. Second, provide sufficient convenience for food transportation. Food transportation involves complex demands from tax officials and high transportation costs for boats and vehicles. Often, when goods are transported from place A to place B, the price increases due to taxes and transportation costs, and the starving people are unable to purchase it, which does not help in reality. Therefore, tax exemption and convenience in transportation should be granted for the transfer of food in various places, so that the starving people can benefit practically. Third, prohibit provinces from restricting grain sales, unscrupulous merchants from hoarding, and food exports. Whenever it is a famine year, provinces strictly divide their territories for food and prohibit circulation, causing the country's surplus and deficit to be unable to be adjusted. The fat and lean are different. In addition, unscrupulous merchants with no conscience only seek profit and deliberately hoard large amounts of food to raise prices and exploit the starving people, or even transfer other miscellaneous grains for export and sell them overseas. All of these have a great impact on the people's food and should be strictly prohibited. Fourth, absorb the surplus soybeans and foreign rice from the Northeast. The Northeast is extremely rich in soybean production. In recent years, sales have been sluggish and there has been a lot of hoarding. It is necessary to urgently absorb them and distribute them to various provinces. Foreign rice should also be widely absorbed for subsidies. Fifth, consumption should be restricted. Rice is mostly consumed in winemaking. According to the calculations of Japanese agricultural scientist Yamazaki Hyakuji, about 30 million *dan* of Chinese rice are consumed in winemaking every year, and the consumption of wheat, sorghum, etc. also reaches more than 10 million *dan* per year. This is one area of food consumption. Ordinary wealthy families only seek delicious food and strive for the finest white rice when milling rice. The nutritious part of the rice is consumed and wasted, and the loss of broken rice is even greater. This is the second area of food consumption. Also, according to investigation reports, more than 10 million *dan* of Chinese rice are damaged by insects, rats, and fungi every year. This is the third area of food consumption. The government should strictly prohibit the former consumption, while the latter two consumptions should also be universally advocated, and people should be taught to improve warehouses and storage methods to reduce the huge amount of consumption. All five of these are emergency measures to treat the symptoms.</p>

<p>Wheat Market Also Trends Downward</p>
<p>Guomin Newspaper New York, 10th - Since the US Department of Agriculture estimated a bumper cotton harvest, New York cotton prices fell sharply today, opening 130 points lower per pound. There was a slight recovery at noon, and at closing, the near-term price was 6.90 cents, down 11.5 points per pound from Saturday's 8.05 cents. The decline in the far-term price was similar. Such a sharp drop in the cotton market alone has not been seen since 1859. Although some brokers believe that even if another 1,500,000 bales are added to the already huge surplus of cotton, it will not cause the market to weaken unexpectedly, the general opinion in the exchange is that the cotton market is bearish. Unless there are natural disasters or insect plagues in the coming weeks that reduce the cotton harvest, or securities rise sharply, or European financial and economic recovery is evident, it will be difficult to raise cotton prices for a while.</p>
<p>Guomin Newspaper Washington, 10th - After the sharp decline in cotton prices worldwide today, merchants were still in shock. The US Department of Agriculture released another negative message. According to estimates on August 1, the US wheat harvest this year is expected to be 894,000,000 bushels, an increase of 25,000,000 bushels from the July 1 estimate and an increase of 31,000,000 bushels from last year's harvest. Based on this statistic, the US surplus wheat at the end of next year is expected to reach a huge 315,000,000 bushels. The impact of this news on the global market will only be known tomorrow, as it was released late. Currently, everyone is paying close attention.</p>
<p>Guomin Newspaper New York, 10th - Today, the New York securities market was affected by the sharp drop in cotton prices, coupled with expectations that some railroads would reduce dividends, most securities prices fell. The commodity market is also bearish.</p>
<p>Guomin Newspaper London, 10th - Today, the British market was greatly affected by the decline in US cotton prices. At the closing in Liverpool, the near-term price of US cotton was 3.58 pence, compared to 4.28 pence last Saturday. Egyptian and Indian cotton also fell accordingly. After the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester cotton exchanges, prices fluctuated greatly due to the unexpected event. The price gradually stabilized in the afternoon, once falling to 3.50 pence, the lowest price in 30 years. It is estimated that the value of cotton in stock in the UK fell by 30 million pounds in one day, which can be described as a rare phenomenon. Due to the sharp fall in cotton prices, there were no transactions in the Manchester cloth market. According to opinions from key figures in the textile industry, the Lancashire cotton industry will be greatly affected because merchants will stop importing goods unless the market price shows an upward trend. Many people have already canceled orders placed last week.</p>
<p>Guomin Newspaper Mumbai, 10th - Today, the Mumbai cotton market was greatly affected by US cotton, with prices falling sharply. The closing price for Bengal in December and January was 117 rupees, compared to 127 last Saturday. The price for Kangra in December and January was 130, compared to 146 last Saturday. The price for White Luo Zhi in July and August was 141, compared to 158 last Saturday, and the price for April and May was 152, compared to 169 last Saturday.

<p>Extremists Deny Involvement in Bombing Case</p>
<p>Authorities Offer Large Reward for Arrest of Mastermind</p>
<p>Guomin Newspaper Berlin, 11th - Today is the anniversary of the promulgation of the Republican Constitution in Germany. The German government held a National Day celebration in the National Assembly Hall. President Hindenburg, members of the Federal and Prussian Cabinets, and the diplomatic corps attended, filling the hall. First, the Huth Song was played, followed by a speech by Finance Minister Dietrichs, urging the country to unite and overcome the current crisis with calm. Then, Chancellor Brüning delivered a short speech, shouting "Long live the Republic" three times. Then, the President personally inspected the guards in the square in front of the National Assembly. The ceremony ended.</p>
<p>Guomin Newspaper Berlin, 10th - The final result of the referendum is that a total of 10,155,331 votes were cast on Sunday. 9,793,603 votes were in favor of dissolving the Prussian Parliament, and the rest were against it. The coalition government of the Social Democratic Party, the Catholic Church Party, and the Democratic Party was able to continue to hold power until the expiration of the current term of the Prussian Parliament in April next year.</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 10th - German President Hindenburg today issued an emergency order revising the publication law on which the Prussian government relied last week to force newspapers to publish a rebuttal to the public referendum. In the future, it will be necessary to wait for the approval of the central government before newspapers can be forced to publish government declarations, and the limit is 500 words.</p>
<p>Guomin Newspaper Berlin, 10th - The public opinion aroused by the referendum and the serious riots in Berlin and other places remained very intense on Sunday. In the evening, it was rumored in political circles that the Federal Government was considering banning the Communist Party and its affiliated organizations, as well as all Communist or quasi-Communist newspapers and publications. This news could not be confirmed this evening. However, according to the official opinion, the Communist Party can be banned, but the Communist Party members in the central and local parliaments cannot be declared illegal. These people will inevitably become the backbone of the new movement. Throughout the day, police patrolled the area near Brüpple-Kreuz, where two police officers were assassinated. Armored vehicles with machine guns and searchlights were stationed at key intersections at night, because rumors circulated that communists planned to attack the police force. The editorial department of the Communist Party's newspaper "Rote Fahne" was thoroughly searched by the police this morning, and a carload of documents was seized. It was subsequently closed down. At the same time, the police suddenly arrived at its printing department, seized the extra edition that was being printed, and burned it completely. The authorities will offer a large reward to apprehend the murderers of the two police officers, but the mastermind has not yet been apprehended. Several suspects have been proven innocent and released. It is now believed that the murderers are members of the Red Front Fighters League, which is a quasi-Communist organization that was ordered to be dissolved two years ago, but is still working in secret.</p>
<p>Guomin Newspaper Berlin, 10th - The Federal Authorities and the German Railway Administration have jointly offered a reward of 100,000 marks (5,000 pounds) for the apprehension of the thugs who destroyed the Basel-Berlin special express train with a bomb. Although more than 100 detectives have been working hard to investigate the case, no clues have been obtained. It is believed that this case must have been committed by political fanatics. It was previously rumored that the purpose of this conspiracy was to kill Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius, but officials considered this nonsense because everyone knew that the two leaders left Rome on Saturday and only needed to check the train timetable to know that the two leaders were not on the bombed train. The shell casings found near the scene have been studied and it is known that the bomb was very powerful and must have been made by an expert. Several newspapers even claimed that the shape and color of the bomb were the same as those used in several riots in northern Germany last year. The headquarters of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party have both issued declarations denying involvement in the case, firmly stating that their party members would never resort to such a tactic.</p>

<p>Telecommunications Tokyo, 11th - At 11:30 PM last night, there was a considerably strong earthquake in the Tokyo area, but it was slow. People in Osaka and Nagoya also felt the earthquake, but there were no casualties.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Hamamatsu, 11th - At 10:33 PM last night, there was a violent earthquake with horizontal movement in the Hamamatsu area. The pendulum stopped, and the power lines were cut. The tremors were equivalent to those at the time of the Great Kanto Earthquake. The epicenter was near the lower reaches of the Ooi River. However, there was only a weak earthquake in the Tokyo area.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Naha, 11th - The Miyako Islands in Okinawa Prefecture have been hit by a storm since the 8th. At 1:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, there was a sudden heavy rain, which caused 70-80% of the more than 13,000 houses on Miyako Island to collapse. Five people died, and many were injured. At the time, one motorized ship capsized and two drifted away. Damage to crops also reached 50%. The maximum wind speed in the Yaeyama Islands also reached 28 meters, but the damage was relatively minor.</p>

<p>(III) Harbors: (A) Dalian Harbor; (B) Lushun Harbor; (C) Andong Harbor; (D) Gan Jingzi Coal Loading Pier. These harbor projects are the lifeline of the South Manchuria Railway and also the mortal wound of our national railways. When will Huludao Harbor be completed? We truly look forward to it every day.</p>
<p>(IV) Mines: (A) Fushun Coal Mine contains more than 900 million tons of coal; (B) Yantai Coal Mine contains more than 20 million tons of coal; (C) Fushun Heavy Oil Mine (extremely important to Japanese industry and national defense); (D) Anshan Iron Mine has reserves of 300 million tons; (E) Fuzhou Clay; (F) Silica in Lushun and Longtou Dagushan; (G) Brucite in Dashiqiao; (H) Talc in Haicheng. All of these mineral resources are operated solely by the Japanese. With so much coal and iron, Japan's domestic industry can rest easy. The discovery of heavy oil deposits has also provided a great boost to the navy. Alas, we have coal and iron that others seize, and then use to make guns and cannons to shoot at us, plundering new rights. There is no greater sorrow than this. Thinking of this, I cannot stop the tears from flowing.</p>
<p>(V) Agriculture: (A) Agricultural Experiment Station, with a main station in Gongzhuling and a branch station in Xiongyuecheng; (B) Tanggangzi Yargedi Experiment Land; (C) Zhengjiatun Experimental Farm; (D) Fenghuangcheng Tobacco Experimental Farm; (E) Nurseries established in Changchun, Tieling, Liaoyang, and Andong. Expansion is planned to monopolize agriculture in the Eastern Provinces. The Agricultural Experiment Station is divided into various departments such as crop cultivation, agricultural chemistry, pathology and entomology, animal husbandry, horticulture, sericulture, and forestry. They spare no effort in experimenting and researching everything related to agriculture, such as air temperature, site selection, cultivation, fertilizers, insects, seed selection, harvesting, and uses, as well as the types, seed selection, and diseases of livestock. They also focus on popularizing agricultural and livestock farming ideas. The results are the greatest. Recently, they cooperated with the Oriental Development Company to raise 5 million yuan and establish the East Asia Encouragement Company to provide funds specifically for Japanese and Korean individuals to engage in paddy field cultivation. Alas, with the Japanese vigorously managing things, our excellent farmland in Northeast China will eventually be cultivated by others.</p>
<p>(VI) Electricity: They operate electricity businesses in Dalian, Fengtian, Changchun, Andong, Fushun, Anshan, and other places. It is now independently operated by the South Manchuria Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>(VII) Hotels: Major locations along the South Manchuria Railway all have Yamato Hotels. A seaside hotel is located in Star Beach outside Dalian. The hotels in Dalian and Fengtian are the most perfect. Since 1928, they have been managed by the South Manchuria Railway Hotel Company.</p>
<p>(VIII) Gas and Pottery: After being nurtured and stabilized by the South Manchuria Railway Company, it was separated from the company in 1925 and independently operated by the South Manchuria Gas Company and the Dalian Pottery Company.</p>
<p>(IX) Assisting Various Other Companies: Such as the South Manchuria Sugar Manufacturing Company, the East Asia Encouragement Company, the Chunchang Exchange, and more than 30 other companies.</p>
<p>(X) Investigation Agencies: The company has an Investigation Department. The Tokyo branch has the East Asia Economic Research Bureau. The Harbin office has an Investigation Department.</p>
<p>(XI) Publishing Books and Periodicals: Many confidential documents are not available for purchase by foreigners.</p>
<p>(XII) Other Local Facilities: (A) Educational facilities cost more than 12 million yuan. Yingkou, Changchun, and Liaoyang each have commercial schools, Fushun has an industrial vocational school, and Xiongyuecheng and Gongzhuling each have agricultural schools. There are also the Manchuria Medical University, the Manchuria Educational College, the South Manchuria Industrial College, and many primary and secondary schools. At the same time, they also subsidize schools run by Chinese, such as the Shenyang Tongwen Commercial School and eight other schools. (B) Health facilities include Dalian Hospital, Gongzhuling Resident Hospital, Army Hospitals in Liaoyang and Tieling, Tongren Hospitals in Andong and Yingkou, and Jilin Dongyang Hospital. In addition, there are a total of twelve public medical locations. There is a Health Research Institute in Dalian. (C) Security facilities include police and fire brigades along the railway line.</p>
<p>Looking at the above undertakings, we can see that they are meticulously organized and all-encompassing. It is no exaggeration to say that they possess all the functions of a state. Since the Japanese seized the South Manchuria Railway and the Anfeng Railway, it has been like an iron fist extending from the Sea of Japan into the hinterland of our Northeast. All political and economic power has come with it. To this day, it has become deeply rooted and unshakable. We only hear the whistle of the South Manchuria Railway, like the wailing of a vengeful ghost. This wailing contains the sound of endless threats, persecution, and slaughter. Countrymen, stop for a moment and listen!</p>
<p>They carve up our land, infringe upon our sovereignty, and plunder our treasures, yet the Japanese constantly boast of their achievements. Hanzawa Tametsuna wrote in the Diplomatic Times: "... Regarding this relationship, all facilities and operations have allowed Manchuria and Mongolia to develop and prosper today. It is the crystallization of more than twenty years of long years, more than twenty billion investments, and the efforts of hundreds of thousands of Japanese and Korean people." What are the feelings of the people of our country upon hearing this?</p>
<p>(V) The South Manchuria Railway's Persecution of Our Country</p>
<p>The persecution of our country by the South Manchuria Railway can be roughly discerned by observing the facts of the South Manchuria Railway Company's operations mentioned above. Now, please allow me to conduct a more in-depth analysis.</p>
<h3 id="e64">(I) Economic Persecution <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(A) Railway Business: In 1929, the total revenue of the South Manchuria Railway's main line and branch lines was 122,037,442 Japanese yen, with a net profit of 74,890,235 Japanese yen. In 1930, the total revenue of our nine railways in Northeast China was 64,889,636 yuan. Although the South Manchuria Railway claimed a 25% reduction compared to previous years, its revenue still reached 91,307,359 Japanese yen. This huge revenue was seized from our national railways. In other words, it is the loss that the railway business gave to our country. Secondly, the total investment of the South Manchuria Railway in our country's railways is 220,788,864 Japanese yen. Some have an annual interest rate of 7%, while others have an interest rate of 5%. The amount of interest we pay each year is enormous, while the railways are largely controlled by the Japanese, allowing them to dominate. Everything is done to benefit the Japanese side, and the benefit of the Japanese side is our loss. This huge loss cannot be accurately calculated. Furthermore, whenever our country plans to build new routes, the Japanese often obstruct them in every way, preventing our plans from being realized. The direct and indirect impact on the operations of our railways and the development of the local areas is an even greater loss.</p>
<p>(B) Industrial and Commercial Operations: Businesses such as electricity, iron manufacturing, factories, ships, and hotels directly seize our interests and indirectly hinder the development of our industry and commerce, causing enormous losses to our country.</p>
<p>(C) Various Mining Industries: Such as Fushun coal and heavy oil, and Anshan iron, are all invaluable treasures. The loss of these, from both direct and indirect perspectives, cannot be calculated with numbers.</p>
<p>(D) Agriculture: Such as the exploitation of forests, the purchase of land, the operation of rice fields, and the acquisition of food, have a great impact on our people's livelihood, resulting in many losses.</p>
<p>(E) Trafficking in Arms and Opium: Japanese and Korean ronin use the convenient transportation and protection of the South Manchuria Railway to traffic in arms and opium into our mainland. On one hand, they absorb our cash, and on the other hand, they further destroy our national economy, plunging our people's livelihood into poverty and weakness. The losses suffered by our country are even greater and deeper.</p>
<h3 id="e65">(II) Political Persecution <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(A) Attached Lands: The so-called attached lands were originally railway land. Article 6 of the contract between the Qing government and Imperial Russia in 1896 for the Eastern Provinces Railway Company stated: "All land necessary for the construction, management, and protection of the railway by the company, as well as land needed for the excavation of sand, soil, rocks, and lime near the railway, if it is government land, shall be granted by the Chinese government without payment of land price... or paid in one lump sum, or rent paid to the landowners on an annual basis, which the company shall be responsible for paying... the company shall be responsible for managing and is permitted to construct various buildings and projects, and to establish and manage its own telephone lines for railway use." According to this article, the power to obtain and handle railway land is extremely clear. All land necessary for the railway shall be granted by our government land or rented from our civilian land, but all must be recognized by our country. It is impossible to arbitrarily occupy it, and there is absolutely no such thing as "attached land." However, after Japan inherited the South Manchuria Railway, it cleverly established the name of railway attached land and collectively referred to the Anfeng Railway as the southern branch line, infinitely occupying our country's land on both sides of the railway. It winds through more than 1,940 li in the southern part of our Eastern Provinces (South Manchuria Main Line and other branch lines), which is no different from invading our Eastern Provinces' defense line. It owns more than 352,000 mu of railway land on both sides (according to the 1929 statistical survey). Currently, the double tracks of each route are being expanded, and the boundary stones on both sides are constantly moving outward, expanding day by day. The area of land occupied is even more difficult to estimate. As for the area of land occupied by the stations, it expands year by year. The number of mu occupied has not yet been investigated, but the magnitude of the number should be even more staggering. This is the persecution of our country by the Japanese violating the contract signed between China and Russia in the past and occupying our land.</p>
<p>(B) So-called judicial administration and police powers in the attached land: Article 5 of the contract signed between China and Russia stated: "All personnel used by the railway shall be protected by the Chinese government... All matters of life, theft, lawsuits, etc., in the railway section shall be handled by local officials in accordance with the contract." The judicial administration, police, and other powers within the railway land are all autonomously controlled by China, which is extremely clear. However, the Japanese abandoned the treaty and did not allow our country to inquire about anything. This vast area of 1,940 li in the southern part of our Eastern Provinces is no different from a forbidden zone, no different from Japanese territory. They use every means to harbor criminals and bully our people. Wherever the iron wheels roll, the mountains and rivers change color. People are allowed to act lawlessly in our territory. This is the persecution of our country by the Japanese violating the contract and occupying our judicial administration and police powers.</p>
<p>(C) Armed Railway: Along the South Manchuria Railway, there are gun emplacements, radio stations, and other military facilities. There are also many troops stationed along the railway. For example, there are a total of 77 gun emplacements, large and small, along the Anfeng Railway. On average, there is one every eight li. The intention of such active military equipment and armed railway is conceivable. As for the atrocities of the Huanggutun Incident (where Zhang Zuolin was assassinated) and the ferocity of "Guimenguan" (Three-Arch Bridge, the only passageway through the holes that were built north of the Liaoning provincial capital and over the railway), they are even more minor incidents.

<p>Wu Kaisheng Appointed Minister to Switzerland and Representative to the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 24th National Affairs Meeting on the 11th. Li Shuhua, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Zhengting, Liu Ruiheng, and Wang Boqun attended. Zheng Hongnian, Chen Shaokuan, and Zhang Wohua were present as observers. Chairman Wang Zhengting presided over the meeting. Matters discussed: (1) Chairman Jiang of Nanchang stated that he had received a telegram from Director He of the Hankou Camp stating that the dikes in Wuhan had collapsed, causing a severe flood. He requested disaster relief. In addition to replying that the Yuan and departments had been asked to handle the disaster relief, a request was made to investigate and handle the case. It was resolved to hand it over to the Ministry of Interior and the Relief Committee. (2) The Ministry of Interior presented a matter regarding the Qinghai Provincial Government's request to cancel the positions of Qinghai Tusi, convert all land originally requisitioned by the Tusi to be collected by the county government, grant each Tusi an annual amount for support, consider the circumstances, and give a suitable title. The proposed measures were reviewed and deemed appropriate. It was requested to be approved as requested and submitted to the National Government. Resolution: Approved as proposed and submitted to the National Government. (3) The Ministry of Education proposed that textbooks for primary schools in the Mongolian leagues and banners were extremely lacking, especially textbooks for national language. The Ministry had compiled eight volumes of Chinese-Mongolian bilingual primary school national language textbooks and planned to print and distribute 10,000 copies for use in various leagues and banners, which would require national currency of 10,000 yuan for printing and paper materials. It was requested that funds be allocated from the national budget for Mongolian and Tibetan education expenses for the 20th year of the Republic. The question was whether this was appropriate and a public decision was requested. Resolution: Approved.

(6) It was resolved to promote Wu Kaisheng to Minister to Switzerland. (7) It was resolved that Jiang Zuobin, the representative to the 12th General Assembly of the League of Nations, was unable to attend due to being transferred to Japan as Minister. It was requested that Wu Kaisheng, the Minister to Switzerland, be appointed as representative. (8) The Rehe Provincial Government presented a matter regarding the issuance of disaster relief reserve funds. After complying with the order and transferring it to the civil and financial departments for handling, they subsequently reported that the disaster relief reserve funds were related to important policies for disaster preparedness. It was proposed that from the 20th year of the Republic, 2% of the province's regular budget revenue should be spent as disaster relief reserves. In addition, the original number of management committee members was set at five. In addition to the heads of the civil and financial departments as ex officio members, a request was made for instructions on whom to appoint. The Provincial Government Committee had decided to designate Tan Guohuan, Li Shuchun, and Zhang Yiting as members of the Rehe Provincial Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee. A request was made to the Executive Yuan to approve and appoint them after obtaining the resumes of each member. Resolution: Approved as appointed. (9) It was resolved that Jian Youwen, counselor of the Ministry of Railways, had requested resignation. It was requested that it be approved, and Wang Wenhuan was appointed to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Commands the Troops</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Shanxi Situation After the Punishment of Shi Yousan <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Obstacles Before Shang Zhen's Departure</p>
<p>Sun Chu and Others' Cunning Schemes to Make Trouble</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: From the beginning of Shi Yousan's rebellion, the attitude of the troops stationed in Shanxi was of great concern to the entire country. When Shi's forces were about to collapse, there was suddenly an anti-Shang atmosphere in Taiyuan. All these events, before and after, had a great impact on the overall situation. Now, after many inquiries, I have learned the truth and will briefly describe it to the people of the country.</p>
<p>When Shi Yousan's rebellion was still brewing, it was rumored that the Shanxi military generals were all in contact with him. When Shi's forces mobilized, Shi sent representatives Wang Yuxiu and Huang Guangyuan to Taiyuan on July 23 and 24, staying at Sun Chu's home. On the same day, the Shanxi military generals held a secret meeting, with all Shanxi generals present except for Shang Zhen. Song Zheyuan was also invited to attend. Because the security was tight, the content of the meeting is unknown. It was later heard that because Song Zheyuan did not express a clear position, the Shanxi generals temporarily remained calm, and Shi's representatives returned disappointed. On the 27th, Xu Yongchang returned to Taiyuan from Beiping, and the Shanxi generals held several meetings. Rumors arose in Taiyuan for a time. It was later learned that the reason they did not dare to act rashly was because Song Zheyuan did not want to cooperate with Shi because of their past history. Also, the main reason was that the two brigades of Gao Hongwen and Huang Guanghua under Shang Zhen's command insisted on opposing Shi.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Shanxi Chairman Shang Zhen had received a telegram order to lead his troops out of the pass to punish Shi in order to reduce the duration of the war. At that time, in addition to Gao and Huang's brigades, Shang Zhen also had Zhou Sicheng's brigade under Yang Xiaoou's command. Shang Zhen had decided to comply with the order to send troops to punish Shi, so he did not say a word on the surface. Every day after official business at the provincial government, he went to the newly opened golf course in the suburbs to play golf, showing that he was calm. Until midnight, he actively prepared for the military departure. Once the preparations were completed, Shang Zhen visited the generals, explaining his intention to depart under orders. Among the generals, some did not advocate it, some supported the central government, some coveted his position by taking advantage of Shang's departure, and some even pretended to agree but secretly tried to obstruct him in order to put Shang to death. However, they all superficially supported Shang's deployment of troops. It was decided that in addition to Gao, Huang, and Zhou's brigades and Zhao Xiezong's regiment stationed in Fenyang, a security army brigade, an artillery regiment, and a cavalry regiment would be assigned to Shang Zhen's command. Together with Gao Guizi's division, which was also ordered to mobilize, the total was more than 30,000 people. The advance troops were Gao Hongwen's brigade, originally stationed in Jingxing. They mobilized on July 29, and at 3 pm on the 31st, Shang Zhen also departed from Taiyuan to command the troops, heading straight for Shijiazhuang and Zhengding.</p>
<p>It is said that when the Shanxi army occupied Shijiazhuang, Shi's forces initially did not know the actual situation of the Shanxi army and fled in panic. At that time, the battle was in full swing in the Baoding Fangshunqiao area on the northern route. Shi Chen, who was commanding on the front line, suddenly received a report from the rear stating that Shang Zhen had led the Shanxi army to occupy Shijiazhuang. He was extremely frightened. As the front line was also unfavorable, he immediately ordered a retreat, leaving the Pinghan Railway and fleeing eastward. In fact, only two brigades and one division arrived at Shijiazhuang. The rear troops were mostly obstructed by other Shanxi troops. For example, Zhou Sicheng's brigade had already departed from Changzhi but was obstructed by Yang Xiaoou. Zhao Xiezong's regiment had arrived in Wenshui from Fenyang but was obstructed by Sun Chu. Both were forced to return to their original defenses. The security army and the artillery under Zhou Dai sat idly by. The aviation team in Shanxi was surrounded and disarmed by Li Fuying's troops, unable to go to the front line to assist in the battle. Even the rear military supplies of the 32nd Army were intercepted. If Shi Yousan had mobilized a brigade to return to Shijiazhuang at that time, the outcome of the battle would have been unpredictable.</p>
<p>When Xu Yongchang returned to Taiyuan from Beiping, there was already talk in Taiyuan that Xu would succeed as chairman of the provincial government. When Shang Zhen led the troops to depart, the chairman of the provincial government was usually represented by Qiu Zengyi, the director of the Finance Department. However, the Shanxi generals Sun Chu, Li Fuying, and others wanted to support Xu in order to strengthen themselves. They initially planned to use the name of the entire province to telegraph the central government to order Xu to lead Shanxi. Later, due to internal disagreement, they turned to borrowing public opinion. Thus, there was a forum for all sectors of society in the Taiyuan Municipal Government on August 4 and a citizen's meeting in Zhongshan Park on the afternoon of the 5th.</p>
<p>The forum in the Municipal Government on August 4 was convened by Sun Chu, Li Fuying, and others, who invited representatives from all sectors of society to attend. At the meeting, Ma Jun, the chairman, reported that Shang Zhen had not achieved any results in leading Shanxi, and it was decided to launch a citizen's meeting on the afternoon of the 5th. The main figures were Ma Jun, Gao Buqing, Zhang Hanjie, Li Fuying, and Li Runfa. The citizen's meeting passed resolutions such as opposing the private deployment of Shanxi troops, opposing the withdrawal of cash, opposing the security army leaving the province, and requesting Xu Yongchang to temporarily maintain the military and political affairs of Shanxi. The so-called deployment of troops and withdrawal of cash were intended to attack Shang. In fact, Shang Zhen deployed troops under the clear order of the central government, and the expenses for the troops' departure were all taken from the deputy commander's headquarters and did not use provincial funds. It is said that Shang Zhen had obtained documents of Shanxi generals colluding with Shi in Jingxing. Sun Chu and others feared that Shang Zhen would win and return, restricting them, and feared that the central government would punish them for this, so they advocated the Monroe Doctrine, rejecting Shang's troops from leaving and returning to Shanxi in order to privately plot. On the 4th and 5th, military vehicles transporting military supplies were nonstop in Taiyuan, which proves that Sun Chu, Li Fuying, and others did have military preparations. However, the opinions within the Shanxi army were not unified, and they feared Song Zheyuan's opportunistic attack, so they still seemed calm on the surface at this time. However, the provincial party department believed that the citizen's meeting was reactionary and had asked the provincial government to find ways to stop it, and reported the reactionary situation to the central government.</p>

<p>Statistics Show More Than 7,000 of Shi's Troops Arrive in Shandong</p>
<p>Han Fuqu Plans to Send Personnel to Verify and Reorganize</p>
<p>Circumstances of Zhang Huanan and Others' Arrest in Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: Since Shi Yousan's defeat, the remnants of Shi's forces have been arriving in Shandong for acceptance and resettlement. So far, more than 7,300 people have arrived in Dezhou. (1) Zhang Xichang's cavalry brigade has only 300 people left due to combat losses. (2) The Special Service Brigade and rear garrison soldiers, totaling more than 3,000 people, did not participate in the war and have complete firearms. These two units departed for Linyi early on the 7th to await verification and reorganization. (3) The three brigades of Ge Kaixiang, Wang Shudian, and Zhang Guogan, totaling 3,000 people, arrived in Dezhou last night. The last to arrive on the 8th was Wang Guocheng's brigade, totaling more than 1,000 people. It was originally expected that more than 10,000 people could arrive, but they were intercepted by the Northeast Army in Zaoqiang, so only the above number remained. Tang Bangzhi led the three brigades of Ge Kaixiang, Wang Shudian, and Zhang Guogan to continue to Linyi for verification and reorganization early on the 9th. Wang Guocheng's brigade was also scheduled to depart for Linyi in the afternoon of the 9th to gather. After gathering, verification and reorganization will be carried out. Cao Fulin returned to Jinan from Dezhou at 2:30 pm today by armored train to report to Han Fuqu and request the dispatch of personnel for verification. According to Cao's conversation, the total number of Shi's troops arriving in Shandong is 8,000 to 9,000 people. In addition to the cavalry brigade and special service brigade that arrived earlier, the two brigades of Wang Xinde and Zhang Guogan, which arrived later, departed from the Doufu Lane of Qilipu in Dezhou today for Linyi, temporarily led by Shi's Chief of Staff Tang Bangzhi and Division Commander Liang Fangqi. After arriving at the destination, they will await verification. The number of those who will arrive later is still unknown, but it is believed that most of them are scattered teams, etc.</p>
<p>Important personnel from Shi Yousan's headquarters also arrived in Dezhou one after another. Several division and brigade commanders have arrived, rested briefly in Dezhou, and came to Jinan with Cao Fulin today. According to a special report from Dezhou, the province supplemented the supplies of Shi's troops after they arrived in Dezhou and issued military uniforms to give them a chance to rest. They then gathered in the designated area. The defeated soldiers have now changed out of their green military uniforms and put on gray ones, looking brand new and no longer in a state of embarrassment. However, because they have not been reorganized, they have not yet worn symbols. Where they are stationed, the words "某 Brigade 某 Unit" are posted high outside the door, still using the previous 13th Route Army name. It was originally scheduled that the defeated soldiers who arrived on the 4th, 5th, and 6th would depart for Linyi Gaotang for gathering on the 7th, but for the past two days, there has been non-stop heavy rain, which has prevented them from departing as scheduled. Also, this morning (the 9th), Cheng Xixian and Hu Shaowu came to Jinan from Dezhou. According to Cheng, there are already 10,000 of Shi's troops in Dezhou. This morning, they departed from Dezhou for Linyi.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the provincial government reported that Shi Yousan's Chief Advisor Zhang Huanan (former Chief of Staff of Liu Zhenhua), Army Commander Zhang Xuecheng, Ning Xingyuan, and others had sneaked into Jinan. Zhang Huanan stayed at the Jinshui Hotel at the northern end of Weier Road, and the other five people stayed at the Huayang Hotel across from the Jinshui Hotel. Han Fuqu ordered the city government to arrest Zhang and others because he was ordered to accept Shi's troops, and all officers and soldiers should go to Linyi, the designated area, to await verification and reorganization and must not stay in Jinan. Mayor Wen Cheng Lie supervised Wang Kairu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and the director of the first branch bureau of the commercial port, leading many secret service teams to make arrests. The Jinshui Hotel was opened by the Japanese. Initially, they said that Zhang Huanan did not live in the hotel, and then said that he had gone out, refusing entry. Later, Wen Cheng Lie went to see Nishida, the Japanese consul, to negotiate. Nishida sent the chief of the Japanese police station, and only then was Zhang Huanan captured. The chief of the Public Security Bureau and the chief of the Japanese police station escorted him to the Public Security Bureau by car on the same day and then transferred him to the provincial government for surveillance. When they arrested Zhang Xuecheng and others at Huayang, they only captured Ning Xingyuan, Wen Jianfang, and four others. Zhang Xuecheng had gone out on the night of the 8th and had not returned, so he was not captured.

<h3 id="e71">The Power of Annihilating Bandits in Southern Jiangxi <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Thousands of Red Bandits Annihilated by Bombing in Liantang Liangcun</p>
<p>Red Bandits Fleeing Westward Surrounded Between Xingguo and Taihe</p>
<p>Commander Tan's Troops Recapture Bandit Nests in Tianbao and Xiaoyao</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The area of Xingguo and Yudu in Southern Jiangxi, along with the Yushan and Xueheling mountain ranges, are winding and long, with layers upon layers of peaks and treacherous terrain. Red bandits hide within, familiar with the terrain, sometimes lurking, sometimes fleeing, sometimes scattered, sometimes gathered, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The forces sent to annihilate the bandits must climb mountains and cross ridges, carrying provisions and weapons, making military maneuvers extremely difficult, and thoroughly suppressing them is inherently not easy. However, reconnaissance aircraft can scout bandit tracks and bomb bandit nests, as well as facilitate communication and contact between various armies, yielding great results. For example, when the right and left wings recently advanced to the vicinity of Shaxi, the bandits laid a large-scale ambush, with a small force at the front. If aircraft had not detected the true situation, notified Hao Menglin's units, and coordinated the attack, not only would it have been difficult to recapture Shaxi, but the bandits might have taken advantage. The red bandits, fearing the power of aircraft, besides hiding in deep mountains and dense forests, often come out at night and hide during the day, not daring to move rashly. At the beginning of this month, the main forces of the bandit suppression army, such as Cai Tingkai, Zhao Guantao, and Chen Cheng's units, besieged Xingguo via Donggu, Fangshiling, and Tongguwei, while pursuing the red bandits who were fleeing westward from Yudu and Xingguo towards Taihe. Over 10,000 remnants of bandits, previously lurking in the mountains dozens of miles southeast of Donggu, attempted to flee eastward to Ningdu via Diancun and Xiecun on the border of Xingguo and Yudu, to attack the rear of the bandit suppression army. Simultaneously, scattered bandits in the Liantang (north of Xingguo, south of Donggu) and Liangcun (east of Donggu, south of Yongfeng) area also gathered and fiercely attacked the local garrison, counterattacking Donggu, and harassing the rear of the armies in Xingguo and Yudu. Fortunately, aircraft detected this, notifying the armies on the borders of Yongfeng, Xingguo, Yudu, and Ningdu to be alert, and concentrating air power to heavily bomb the bandits. The air and land forces coordinated their operations, and finally defeated the more than 10,000 bandits, killing thousands. The headquarters recently received a telegram from the front lines, stating that over 10,000 remnant bandits in the Liangcun and Liantang area were hiding in deep mountains and remote valleys, taking advantage of opportunities to harass our rear. On the third of this month, they gathered and descended the mountain, attempting to flee eastward. Our aircraft detected them and immediately dropped dozens of bombs, and notified nearby garrisons to be on alert. On the afternoon of the fourth, the bandits indeed fled eastward towards Liangcun and Lianxu, engaging in a fierce battle with our army for a full day and night. The bandit army suffered heavy casualties and gradually became unsustainable. By the evening of the fifth, the bandits still made a final desperate attempt, but Commander Jiang Dingwen personally led his troops to attack their rear, and finally dispersed the bandits. In this battle, approximately 3,000 bandits were killed, and 2,300 rifles were captured. According to a telegram from the aviation team at the front, scattered bandits near Liangcun and Liantang attempted to attack our garrison, but were severely beaten by the armies and dispersed. Our aircraft concentrated firepower to heavily bomb the bandits on the fifth, sixth, and seventh, dropping over a hundred 120- and 160-pound bombs each day. Yesterday, according to telegrams from various armies, there were over 400 bandit corpses in the river滩 near Yuexi, and bandit corpses were scattered all over the mountains ten miles southeast of Liangcun, numbering approximately six or seven hundred. In the vicinity of Liaocun and Laicun (between Ningdu and Yudu), there were also over 400 bandit corpses, all killed by our air force bombing, with blood and flesh splattered everywhere, creating an unbearable stench. The counterattack by the scattered bandits in Donggu completely failed. Our army, in addition to sending a part to suppress the bandits in Yudu, sent another part to pursue the main force of the red bandits fleeing to Taihe from Xingguo. It is reported that the Shangguan Yunxiang's Third Route Army, advancing to Yudu, is currently fiercely attacking Yudu City. The aviation teams in Ji'an and Linchuan are flying to the city to drop bombs and bomb the bandits, dropping several hundred bombs in total, killing a large number of bandits. It is rumored that Yudu City has already been captured, and Zhu Mao's bandit units are fleeing from Tantou and Liren to Ruijin and Huichang. According to another message, the bandits north of Yudu, when the bandits from Liangcun and Liantang fled eastward, also launched a counterattack northward towards Gulonggang, attempting to encircle the bandit suppression army. Shangguan Yunxiang's troops surrounded the bandits and are in the process of disarming them, while the scattered bandits in the Yinkeng and Xianxia area were taken care of by the right wing army. Shangguan has made contact with Zhao and Chen's units. As for the bandits fleeing westward, after losing Xingguo, they gathered in the area of Guping, Guancheng, Shacun, and Longxi between Xingguo and Taihe, attempting to steal across the Gan River and attack Jixi from the side, to enter Yongxin and Suichuan. However, our Luo Lin and Gong Bingfan's two divisions are stationed on the east bank of the Gan River, from Ji'an to Taihe and Wan'an, with tight defenses, making it difficult for the red bandits to cross. At the same time, the Zhao, Chen, and Cai's armies that recaptured Xingcheng are advancing westward from Xingguo, and will encircle and attack the bandits with Luo Gong's divisions, planning to annihilate the bandits in the plains of Yanxi Ferry, Darui, and other places.</p>
<p>Moreover, the headquarters received a telegram from Commander Tan Daoyuan of the army, stating that the 149th Brigade advanced to the vicinity of Tianbao and Xiaoyao on the Fish Day, defeating the bandit's fake Ninth Division guard camp and three or four large detachments, and occupied the two bandit nests. Over a thousand bandits were killed, and the fake labor union and grain association chairmen Cai Han and Liu Qibi, along with dozens of bandits, were captured alive. Their leaders have been executed on the spot, and the remnant bandits have scattered and fled to the border of Tonggu and Wanzai. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Shao Lizi Arrives in Jiangxi from Beijing <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Reports to Chiang on the Negotiations with Shi</p>
<p>Releases a Statement to Reporters</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Headquarters, arrived in the province from Beijing on the 8th and paid his respects to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, reporting on his trip to meet with Han and Ma to resolve the Shi department issue, and the attitude of the northern generals in supporting the central government's bandit suppression. Chiang expressed great satisfaction. On the 9th, Chiang sent his adjutant-general He Jingwu to host a banquet at the Provincial Residence to welcome Shao and Li Jinglin, and invited Chairman Lu and other dignitaries to attend. It is heard that Shao will stay in the province for a few days before going to Lushan to recuperate, as Shao has recently suffered from bronchitis and needs rest. Shao spoke to reporters in the city, with the main points divided into three: (1) On previous orders from the Commander-in-Chief, I went to Ji'nan to discuss the issue of maintaining public order in the north with Chairman Han. The result was very satisfactory. When Shi Yousan mutated, Han spared no effort to repeatedly advise and guide him, but Shi insisted on his own way, resulting in a complete resolution within ten days. (2) I left Ji'nan on the 5th and arrived in Beijing on the 6th. After staying overnight, I came to Jiangxi. Yesterday, after arriving in the province, I reported the trip to Ji'nan to the Commander-in-Chief. The Commander-in-Chief ordered Chairman Han to clean up the Shi department's escape to Shandong, and Han will surely abide by the intention and properly handle it with the north and south armies. (3) The Jiangxi bandit suppression is progressing extremely smoothly. Chairman Chiang is determined to eliminate the remnant bandits in various places in the shortest possible time. Guangdong and Guangxi, at a time when the great achievement of bandit suppression is about to be completed, have unexpectedly sent troops to Hunan and Jiangxi, and incited Shi Yousan's rebellion, which is tantamount to supporting the bandits. However, with the elimination of the Shi department, Guangdong and Guangxi will certainly not dare to advance rashly, so Chiang is temporarily ignoring this and is still focusing all his efforts on bandit suppression.

<p>Wuhan Flood</p>
<h3 id="e73">He Chengjun Asks to Dredge the Yangtze River <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Expresses That Man Will Conquer Nature</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wuhan has suffered a severe flood, and today marks the ninth day. The water level continues to rise, and the rescue of the dikes is extremely busy. The removal of accumulated water has also begun. The situation in recent days is divided and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Xiang River and Han River Continue to Rise: The Yangtze River in Wuhan is normally about thirty feet deep. After the flood occurred, it has been rising daily without decreasing. After the entire city was flooded, the river depth reached fifty feet and one inch. It continued to rise one inch on the 6th and five inches on the 7th and 8th. On the 9th, it rose another inch or so, totaling fifty feet and eight inches, which exceeds the previous record. According to reports from the customs and talks with an engineer, if it rises to fifty feet and twenty inches, the disaster will be even more unthinkable. The citizens are deeply wounded and feel great pain. Hearing this news, they are very frightened. Besides the wealthy who have left Wuhan in droves, the general poor have nowhere to escape and can only weep and complain to heaven. Unexpectedly, in this critical moment, a telegram came from Chongqing, stating that the water level there had suddenly risen by twenty-four feet. A telegram from Yuezhou also stated that the water level had risen by more than ten feet. Xiangyang has risen a foot from the 3rd to the 6th and continued to rise six feet from the 6th to the 9th, and it is simultaneously flowing eastward, converging on Wuhan. After inspecting the river, all sections are full, so the influx is quite slow. However, a huge amount of water cannot be contained by the river and will surely overflow onto the banks. The Wuhan flood is just beginning and has not yet reached its peak.</p>
<p>Zoned Rescue of Dikes: Wuhan's dikes have not been well-maintained and are not very strong. This time the water level is relatively high, so all the dikes are showing signs of danger. Besides the Danshuichi, Danci, and Ting dikes that have already collapsed, the remaining dikes are in danger of collapsing at any time. For example, the Saihu dike outside the Tongxiangmen gate in Wuchang showed internal cracks in the upper and middle sections on the morning of the 8th, about ten zhang long, which was extremely dangerous. The bridge foundation also leaked a lot of water. Fortunately, materials were readily available, and the workers worked hard, immediately driving piles and stuffing bags, turning the danger into safety. A hole was found in the Wufeng dike near the Datiukou area, behind the Pinjiang Tea House, on the 8th, with water flowing like a waterfall. Construction was also carried out to plug the hole. Also, the dike body at the Shangmatou wharf in Xujiapeng was immersed in water for too long, and the inner side was flushed away, revealing a very long crack, which requires a row of piles, a length of one li, to consolidate. Three hundred workers have been dispatched to rescue day and night. The gaps in the Huangwuli dike and Qingshan dike have also been blocked with sandbags. In Hankou, the sandbags in the Huangjingtang and Pizijie area, and the Pacific Soap Factory and Qiaokou area have been specially raised and thickened due to the excessive surge of the Xiang River. The dangerous corner of Yajiashan Donghuajiao and the Jiashaji gap are also being repaired. In addition, four holes were found in the Zhanggongci dike on the 9th, and they have also been blocked properly and are not dangerous. For specialized responsibility in the disaster prevention department, Wuhan has been divided, with Wuchang being organized by the Water Conservancy Bureau and co-organized by the Construction Department, and Hankou being organized by the Municipal Government and co-organized by the Water Conservancy Bureau, so that each is responsible for construction.</p>
<p>Removing Accumulated Water from Streets: There is very deep water in Hankou, and small boats are a useful means of transportation. The sound of oars is endless all day long. The Disaster Prevention Department has decided to build dikes for discharge in order to restore traffic as soon as possible. The contractor is the Hanxingchang Construction Company. Since the 7th, they have started building dikes. In three days, more than 300 locations in Laopu, Zhongshan Road, and the third district have been built. After the construction is completed, drainage will be carried out. The department also urged the factory yesterday to speed up the construction, saying that if the deadline is exceeded and the construction cannot be completed, the disaster will expand, and the merchants will suffer even greater losses, and all compensation responsibilities will be asked of the factory, etc. In Wuchang, although it has not been flooded, there is a lot of accumulated water. The Wuchang City Wall Waterproofing Office is using machines to discharge the water. The area of Yunjiaqiao and Wenchangmen behind the mountain was completely drained on the 9th. Construction is scheduled to begin in the Pingqimen area in front of the mountain on the 11th.</p>
<p>Actively Providing Disaster Relief and Disease Prevention: The emergency relief association considers this disaster to be particularly severe and there are many refugees. It has been distributing emergency relief in various ways for days, saving many lives. Because the weather is hot, there are fears of an epidemic, and doctors have been sent to administer medicine and vaccinations in various places. However, because the relief funds are limited, it is not easy to sustain. Telegrams have been sent to various parties, requesting to raise relief funds, and asking officials of various agencies to donate their salaries. They are still afraid that it will not be enough, and they have also asked the Pinghan Railway Bureau to add 300,000 yuan, and the special tax and unified tax bureaus to add 200,000 yuan to support the effort. As for collecting floating corpses and burying floating coffins, the conference has also decided to hand it over to the Goodness Hall Joint Office. Many floating corpses have been recovered in recent days, and all have been placed in thin coffins. The recovered floating coffins, totaling more than 200, were transported by barge to Hanyang for burial on the 9th.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Pinghan Transportation: Pinghan Road traffic has been disrupted for more than a month due to the military situation in the north and the flood in the south. Now the military situation in the north has come to an end, but the water level in the south is still rising. The railway bureau and road merchants have suffered significant losses. The director of the bureau, Huang Zhenxing, is making great efforts to plan, and has temporarily hired three steamboats to pick up passengers at the Chenjiajiang shore. The departure time for the ferry was originally scheduled for 7:36 am every day. However, since north-south traffic has just resumed and there are many passengers, the prepared trains are not enough to carry them. To avoid crowding, each ship will depart as soon as it is full, and it has been rescheduled to carry twice per ship every morning. The train north of Chenjiaji will depart after the passengers arrive and board, directly to Xinyang, to connect with the 92nd mixed train or the second special express train, directly to Beijing.</p>
<p>Suggestions to Dredge the Yangtze River: He Chengjun, Director of the Expeditionary Headquarters, believes that while the flood was caused by excessive water volume upstream, the Yangtze River's blockage and inability to fully accommodate the water was also a major factor. To seek a permanent solution, it is necessary to dredge the river. It is said that he has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting an allocation of Gengkuan funds to start dredging, so as to avoid further flooding in the provinces along the river. According to Xu Yuanquan, the director of disaster prevention, dredging the river and building dikes are fundamental solutions, and they should be seriously considered in the future. At present, we can only focus on addressing the symptoms. The current dangerous projects are being well-repaired, and if the water does not rise again, there should be no danger. If it is still like the 7th and 8th, it is still a concern. According to my observation, now that it is autumn, the water level may not rise again, but no matter what, I will do my best to prevent it, and man may not be able to conquer nature, etc. (August 10)</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Yellow River Water Level Rises Sharply Due to Rain <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Jinan has been experiencing continuous rain for days, and the upstream of the Yellow River has also had heavy rain recently, causing the water level to rise sharply in Liuzhuang Zhukou in the upper reaches of Shandong and Sunjia Damazhuang in the lower reaches, posing a dangerous situation. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, has urgently telegraphed the provincial government to report. The original telegram reads: "To Han Jun, Chairman of Shandong Provincial Government: Recent continuous rain has caused the Yellow River water level to rise daily. In Luokou, it has suddenly risen by two feet and two inches in the past two days, with the water level reaching eight zhang, nine feet, and two inches above sea level. All sections are also experiencing rising water levels, creating a dangerous situation. The situation in Liuzhuang Zhukou in the upper reaches and Sunjia Damazhuang in the lower reaches is particularly dangerous. Fortunately, the spring compartment funds this year have been set and the arrangements are thorough. If the sky clears and the water does not continue to rise, there may not be a major danger. I have telegraphed to all general and branch sections and the responsible personnel to pay attention to protection, hoping to ensure safety. Respectfully reported, please release your concerns. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, respectfully." (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">After the Opening of the Three Dams on the Grand Canal <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Disaster Situation in the Counties of the Li-Xia River</p>
<p>Ordinary People Cry in Pain and Pray to God</p>
<p>Representative Yao Attempts Suicide by Taking Medicine</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since the Grand Canal water level rose in Jiangsu Province and the Cheluo, Nanguan, and Xin dams were opened successively, the counties of Yanfu, Taidong, and Xinghua have become a vast ocean and a swamp. The news received is described as follows:</p>
<p>Yancheng: After the news of the dam opening arrived, the people in each district were panicked because the county had very little early rice, and the middle and late rice were completely hopeless. The town of Shagou in the west of the county was completely submerged, with water three feet deep in the houses. The sound of crying shook the sky, and there was no place to move to. It is heard that the villages and towns in the county that have not been submerged are preparing for rescue methods.</p>
<p>Funing: The dam water has reached the county, and most of the cotton fields and miscellaneous grains are completely hopeless. The situation in the southwestern part of the county, where there is a part of the rice fields, is the same as in Yancheng.</p>
<p>Taixian: The part of the county above the dam has become a swamp due to the overflowing of the rivers and lakes. The part below the dam has been affected by the opening of the Grand Canal dam, and the fields, houses, and rice have all flowed eastward. The general farmers have nowhere to move and are waiting for death.</p>
<p>Dongtai: The Wanggang and Zhugang in the county have not been dredged for a long time, and the discharge of water into the sea is extremely slow. This year's rainfall is very heavy, and the entire territory has sighed and collapsed. Suddenly, I heard that the canal dam was opened, and the sigh of the fish was chilling. The hard work of the villagers throughout the year was completely hopeless, and they burned incense and cried, praying for the protection of heaven. Their foolishness is pitiful, and their hearts are pitiful.</p>
<p>Xinghua: The terrain of the Li-Xia River, Xinghua and the western part of Yancheng are the lowest. When the canal dam is opened, the county suffers the brunt. The autumn harvest, which has been lacking for a long time, has completely sunk in three or four days. The public does not want to live, so they blame the weakness of the dam protection representative, gather thousands of people, plan to set fire to destroy the representative's house, and kill him. Fortunately, the county government tried its best to stop it. It is heard that Yao, the representative of the Chamber of Commerce, committed suicide by taking poison during the disturbance, and is still in danger of life.</p>
<p>Guangdong Aviation Office</p>
<h3 id="e76">Discovery of a Plot to Blow Up Aircraft <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>After the incident was revealed, staff officer Gu Shangying was shot</p>
<p>Zheng Yuming and Ye Zhaoxiong are detained on suspicion</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has been actively preparing for military affairs recently, and the air force is about to depart on orders. Unexpectedly, an incident of plotting to burn aircraft occurred within the air force, which has attracted great attention from the public. It is found that Gu Shangying, a lieutenant colonel staff officer of the Guangdong Aviation Headquarters, graduated from the 5th infantry class of the Huangpu Military Academy. He is a native of Wuhua County, Guangdong. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, when Zhang Huichang was the director of the 8th Route Army Aviation Office, he served as an attachment to the student team of the aviation school, and was promoted to captain of the aircraft protection team. In August of the 18th year, he was promoted to captain of the protection team. Later, Zhang Huichang went to Beijing to take office as the Director of the Aviation Administration, and the Director of the Guangdong 8th Route Army Aviation Office was promoted by Huang Guangrui. After Huang took office, he transferred Gu to serve as a lieutenant colonel staff officer in the Aviation Office in April of this year. When Guangdong Province announced the mutiny, Huang Guangrui, the director of the Aviation Office, paid attention to Gu's actions. On July 30th, Gu was suddenly arrested by Huang Guangrui. According to rumors from outside, Gu suddenly asked the director of the Aviation Office for three weeks' leave in early July to return to his hometown of Wuhua to visit relatives. Hu Hanxian, the chief of staff of the office, suspected that Gu's family had always been in the province, and that it was suspicious for him to ask for leave to return home, so he secretly sent someone to follow him. Therefore, Gu's every move was known to his entourage. After Gu asked for leave, he took a boat to Shantou and sent a letter to the Aviation Office from a hotel, saying that he would return home as soon as he arrived in Shantou, hoping to dispel the suspicions of his colleagues. However, after Gu sent the letter, he secretly took the original boat elsewhere. About a week later, he returned to Guangdong on the original boat. After Gu returned to Guangdong, he did not go to the Aviation Office to cancel his leave, which made him more suspicious. On the morning of July 30th, Wang and Wu, the platoon leaders of the 123rd platoon of the 3rd squadron of the aircraft protection team stationed in the hangar, reported to Secretary-General Wu Qi of the Aviation Headquarters, saying that staff officer Gu Shangying had mobilized them to burn the aircraft with kerosene, and had chosen 4 am on the 31st to start the operation, stating that they would be given 500 yuan each, and that there would be a huge reward of 250,000 to be distributed after the event was completed. The Secretary-General ordered the three platoon leaders to use a trick to lure Gu. The three platoon leaders agreed with Gu to meet and discuss at a residence in Renheli, Xiaobei Branch. At that time, the Aviation Department sent the platoon leaders to supervise the plainclothes team and several soldiers, and informed the Gang Police in advance. They went to the residence in Renheli to surround and capture Gu. Gu noticed the situation in the house and immediately ran out of the house, but was captured near the Dongyue Temple and taken to the Aviation Headquarters. Wu, the Secretary, interrogated him, and Gu admitted to the mobilization without denial. After the interrogation, he was handed over to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for custody, and the audit department of the bureau examined the whereabouts of his instigators. Later, it was learned that Gu was instigated by a certain person related to the former Huangpu Military Academy. A certain person set up a secret agency in Hong Kong, specializing in mobilizing this matter. If he succeeded this time, he would be filled with a regimental leader's vacancy and receive a reward of 200,000 yuan. After he was ordered, he received 50,000 yuan and deposited it in a bank in the province as mobilization expenses. Nearly 2,500 yuan has been used, etc. On the 2nd, the Public Security Bureau received a secret order, ordering Gu to be executed immediately. Chen Qingyun, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, comforted Gu and said that if there was a will, he could write it down immediately and hand it over to his family. At this time, Gu knew that he was about to be executed, so he drank half a bottle of foreign wine. Then, four inspectors from the Public Security Bureau escorted Gu to the suburbs to be shot. Since the Gu case occurred, the Air Force Headquarters was still afraid that there were accomplices hiding inside, so from the evening of the 30th, the guards of all airports and hangars were taken over by the military police. At the same time, special certificates were issued to personnel in the department. Later, those who did not wear special certificates were not allowed to enter the hangar. At the same time, the Air Force Headquarters believed that the aircraft protection team, the 3rd squadron mobilized by Gu this time, had been reported by the platoon leaders Lin Yinsheng, etc., but the squadron leader Zheng Yuming and the team attachment Ye Zhaoxiong had not noticed it in advance, and they were suspected of being involved in this case. The squadron leader and the team attachment were detained together, and on the 2nd, they were transferred to the military police for custody, waiting for the Air Force to interrogate them. After the squadron leader, etc. were detained, Mai Genqi, the squadron leader of the 2nd squadron of the aircraft protection team, was appointed to serve concurrently as the squadron leader of the 3rd squadron.

<h3 id="e77">Japanese Manipulation of Qingdao Salt Industry <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yuan Lichen Plans to Abolish the Sino-Japanese Qing Salt Agreement</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong has always been known as a famous salt-producing area, with excellent salt quality and abundant production. At present, only Changlu in the country can compete with it. However, due to the old salt law, there were fixed lead banks and fixed sales channels. Therefore, the use of salt in Shandong Province was supplied by Yanjiaogou, Wangguan, Jinkou, Shijiusuo, and Taoluo and other salt-producing areas. The salt produced in Qingdao had no way out. During the Japanese occupation of Qingdao, the salt production was completely sold to Japan. Japan relied on Qingdao for most of its industrial salt and edible salt, because Qing salt had light taxes. If other places needed a tax of one dime, Qing salt only needed three cents. Light taxes mean cheap prices. When Qingdao was taken over, many useless salt fields were temporarily expanded by the Japanese, and our country paid 3 million yuan to redeem them. A Sino-Japanese Qing Salt Agreement was also established, stipulating that the Qingdao salt area must supply Japan with at least 1 million dan (100 jin per dan) and at most 3.5 million dan per year. However, since the takeover, the Japanese have never bought 2 million dan, and the prices are very low. On the one hand, they actively expanded the salt fields in the Kanto Prefecture to boycott Qing salt, resulting in Chinese salt merchants operating Qing salt accumulating salt like mountains without a way out. Due to treaty relations, they had to prepare for the Japanese, suffering unbearable losses. When Zhang Zongchang was in Shandong, he held Qing salt domestic sales, but it was opposed by inland salt merchants and failed to implement it. As a last resort, he designated ten counties under the jurisdiction of Guide Prefecture in Henan Province and two counties of Su and Wo in Anhui Province as Qing salt lead banks. However, the area has been repeatedly affected by wars, and sales have been poor. As of this year, Qingdao salt merchants such as Yongyu Company have lost millions of yuan. This year, the salt in the Japanese Kanto Prefecture is priced at eight corners per dan, and Qing salt is taxed seven cents less, so the price should be seven corners and three cents. However, the Japanese only offer six corners and zero forty. It is now August, and the Japanese still do not purchase salt at the set price. This is a deliberate strategy by the Japanese. They will wait until the end of the year when the salt merchants are in urgent need of money, and then offer a cheap price to purchase, forcing the salt merchants to sell. Moreover, the Japanese have a very clear understanding of the salt industry in Shandong Province. They know exactly how much each dan of salt costs, so the prices they offer often make the salt merchants laugh or cry. In the end, due to economic pressure, they have to sell cheaply to the Japanese. After Yuan Lichen, the new salt transport officer, took office, he personally went to Qingdao to inspect and convened all the salt merchants to study the matter. Yuan believed that in order to save Qing salt, the unequal Sino-Japanese Qing Salt Agreement must be abolished, and Japan should not be supplied with salt. Instead, another way out should be found for Qing salt in the salt-deficient areas of Henan Province, benefiting merchants and convenienceing the people, and enriching the country's taxes. Otherwise, the Qingdao salt industry will be completely bankrupt in the future. Yuan also said that the sacks for transporting salt are extremely coarse and are also foreign goods. This product is not made of hemp, but of a kind of Indian product similar to reeds. Recently, someone invented that our country's rice straw can also be used to make bags. If this is promoted, it can also reduce waste. (August 9)</p>

<h3 id="e79">Opening of Appeal in Assassination Case <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Fast News: The case of Xu Zhuoran of Fujian, a member of the National Government, being assassinated, after being transferred from the Hangzhou County Local Court for jurisdiction last year, the four suspects, namely Ye Caizhen, Chen Yanxiang, Chen Delin, and Lin Luo, were escorted to Hangzhou for interrogation. They were indicted separately on charges of premeditated murder. After repeated trials by criminal court judges, it was deemed that there was insufficient suspicion of murder, and Ye Caizhen, Chen Yanxiang, and Chen Delin were all declared not guilty. Lin Luo was sentenced to four years in prison for the crime of possessing military weapons privately. Chen Huaming, the prosecutor in charge of the case, was dissatisfied and filed a public prosecution with the High Court. The trial opened yesterday (11th) at 8:00 AM. The defendants were summoned to court. The plaintiff, Xu Zhuoran's wife, Xu Ye, and the defendants Ye Caizhen, Chen Delin, Chen Yanxiang, and Lin Luo were all brought from the detention center. Five witnesses, Huang Jinyan, Xie Shizhen, Xu Mulin, Guo Hua, and Zou Chun, also appeared. The presiding judge, Xie Hongen, and clerk, Zhou Zhonglian, took their seats. Due to the lack of proficiency in the Min dialect, female clerk Tang served as the translator. Ye Caizhen, Chen Delin, Chen Yanxiang, and Lin Luo were interrogated once, and their testimonies remained the same as before. Then, witnesses Huang Jinyan and Xie Shizhen were questioned. Chen Xiang, Zhang Jichang, and Liu Zhi, who were escorted from Min the day before and were related to the case, were interrogated. Chen Xiang was considered to be more suspicious. As it was getting late, the defendants were ordered to be taken into custody and await the next scheduled hearing. As for the main culprit, Lin Min, he was captured by the stationed troops in Tong'an on June 19th. After being urged by telegram, he has not yet been escorted to Hangzhou. One account states that Lin Min's death was certified by the Xiamen Siming Court Tong'an Judicial Office. The person captured this time is actually another person named Zhang Meng. The truth remains to be verified.</p>

<p>Robbery by Bandits at the Junction of Suzhou and Changshu: Six Lanes, Xiangcheng Luo Township, Yuanhe District of this county, which borders Suzhou, was suddenly raided on the 7th by more than 20 bandits speaking with a Hakka accent. They were armed with rapid-firing guns and other weapons and arrived on two boats from Yangcheng Lake. After arriving in the town, they fired shots as a show of force and robbed the homes of Gong Yupeng, Gong Shoupeng, and four other pharmacies, injuring Shoupeng's elderly mother and two seven-year-old children. The losses amounted to a considerable sum of six to seven thousand yuan. The 1st Precinct of the 7th Public Security Sub-bureau of nearby Wu County sent a patrol leader and four police officers to suppress the bandits, but they were unsuccessful due to their weak force. The bandits then sneaked into Shanglongjing Town and robbed the home of resident Gu A'gen, resulting in a loss of over one thousand yuan. The bandits then fled into Yangcheng Lake. The injured members of the Gong family were sent to Suzhou Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Electricity Plant Users Agree on Response Measures: The electricity plant in this county has been out of power for quite some time due to damaged machinery, causing significant losses to users. The Electrical Users Association convened a general meeting of all users on the 8th. Approximately 50 representatives from merchants and other users attended, chaired by Shao Yufan. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Cao Shiliu, Shao Yufan, Xu Junhuai, Zhou Junlu, and Ping Dingcheng were designated as authorized representatives of the users to negotiate with the company; (2) The plant should compensate for the losses incurred during the power outage; (3) Measures should be taken to prevent future power outages; (4) Streetlights should have a dedicated line for nighttime lighting; (5) Opposition to the "preferential approval" system and, in accordance with the Ministry of Communications' order, the cost per character should not exceed 24 cents; (6) Existing discounts should not be canceled; (7) Electricity bills for July should be deferred until the representatives have negotiated. All cases were passed. Furthermore, the power plant has purchased a new machine from Shanghai and resumed full city lighting on the 9th. From the date of the power outage to the resumption of lighting, a month has elapsed.</p>
<p>Business Tax Below Contracted Amount of 20,000 Yuan: The business tax in this county has been contracted to the County Chamber of Commerce for 50,000 yuan per year and the investigation and collection have begun. However, the tax amount investigated in the various townships and towns is only 30,000 yuan, falling short of the contracted amount by as much as 20,000 yuan, making it a difficult situation. It is proposed to return to government management. On the afternoon of the 8th, a meeting of various trade guilds was convened to discuss the matter. The result was that the capital and turnover of each store should be strictly investigated. If it is insufficient to meet the contracted amount, the various guilds should share the burden. The outstanding provincial funds should be raised and paid by the various trade guilds in advance. From today onwards, the collection will still be carried out by the County Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Notorious Bandit Zheng Ming Escorted to Changshu: Zheng Yushan, the notorious bandit who has already been executed, his son Zheng Ming, who is only in his twenties, is extremely fierce and serves as a commander among the pirates. Since his father Yushan was arrested and executed, Ming has often harassed the coastal areas of this county, claiming to avenge his father. Therefore, the coastal residents have no peaceful days. On the 5th of this month, Chief Zhu of the Detective Team received a telegram from the Shanghai-based detective, stating that the notorious bandit Zheng Ming had been arrested in Shanghai. After Zhu reported to Director Yin, he led police officers and detectives to Shanghai to escort him back on the 6th. The bandit Zheng had been sent by the Shanghai Concession Police to the Special District Court, which sentenced him to five years in prison. Therefore, the county's request to escort him back was denied. Subsequently, Director Yin of the Public Security Bureau and Chief Zhu of the Detective Team explained the situation to the court president, who finally agreed. Thus, at around 6 PM on the 8th, Zheng was escorted to Changshu. After landing, Zheng was handcuffed together with another bandit and walked along the main street into the city to the Public Security Bureau. Zheng Ming was wearing a white Xiangyun yarn long gown, silk trousers, white socks, and plain canvas shoes, appearing quite luxurious and neat. When asked by reporters about his bandit experiences, Zheng stood up and replied that he had indeed committed the Western Ocean, Hecun, and Lugongqiao cases. Wang City is where I grew up, so I have never harassed it. As for joining the bandits, it was only in July of last year, and it has not even been a year. At this point, he pointed to the person handcuffed together with him and said, "This is my best friend, Hu Peilin, but he has never committed crimes with me. This time, he was arrested because I couldn't endure the torture in the police station and confessed that Hu could testify for me, which resulted in him being implicated." Then he sat back on the bench, fanning himself and wiping his sweat, with a very calm attitude. Later, he said to Chief Zhu, "It's quite restrictive to be handcuffed together. Can we be handcuffed separately? Now that I'm here, I have no other thoughts, only waiting for the verdict." Zhu agreed and removed the handcuffs. Zheng then took off his long gown and handed it to Chief Zhu for safekeeping, saying that he would still need to wear it during the trial. After speaking, he stretched out both hands and allowed them to be locked. At this point, the detectives were still testing whether the handcuffs were tight. Zheng then moved his hands slightly and said to the detective, "You can tighten the insurance a bit more." Then he stretched out both feet and asked for shackles to be added before entering the detention center. His attitude was calm and collected, which is evident from this. He will be briefly interrogated and then transferred to the County Justice Office for questioning on the 10th.</p>

<p>Ministry of Electricity Requests Relief for the Silk Industry: The Wuxi silk industry, due to business failures last year, jointly submitted a request with the silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to the government for approval to issue 8 million yuan in public bonds to provide relief to the silk industry. 4 million yuan was to be used to address the root cause, reorganize sericulture, and 4 million yuan was to be used to provide relief to the factories and encourage silk exports. Starting from May 20th of this year, the customs office would collect 30 yuan per bale as a public bond fund when exporting raw silk. It has been a year since the request for relief was submitted last year, and the factories have been responsible for repaying the public bond fund for three months. However, the approved public bonds have not yet been issued. The factories are eagerly waiting for them, and many of them have already lost all their capital last year and are owed more to Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) than their share capital. Due to the hope of relief from the public bonds, they have had to find other ways to scrape together funds and勉强(barely) start work, hoping to use the public bonds to repay the Qianzhuang. This was originally a measure of drinking poison to quench thirst. Unexpectedly, this year's spring silkworm cocoon harvest was greatly reduced, and the summer silkworm cocoons were completely destroyed due to the flood. The factories are already facing a shortage of raw materials, and the European and American silk markets are also trending downward, with sluggish sales. The factories are in a dire situation. However, the labor union is demanding the payment of wages for work stoppages on commemorative days, urging them as urgently as fire. The factories, in this situation of being unable to laugh or cry, have specially submitted requests to the County Government and the County Chamber of Commerce for relief through the trade association. The Chamber of Commerce has approved the letter and telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the approved silk industry public bonds be immediately ordered to be issued by the responsible department, without further delay. With the selling price of the factories not covering the cost and a severe shortage of raw materials, it is inevitable that they will not be able to sustain themselves. They can only save expenses, reduce costs, and avoid further complications. Please promptly devise relief measures and reveal the direction, so that they can follow.</p>
<p>Freight Rates for Rice, Flour, and Cocoons Still Follow Special Prices: The freight rates for grains, flour, and cocoons in Wuxi were previously set at special prices by the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. Unexpectedly, the Traffic Department recently issued a notice to cancel them and charge freight according to the new regulations. Cocoons were changed from first class to second class, and rice and wheat were changed from fourth class to fifth class, while flour remained in fourth class. However, based on the current special prices, there is a considerable increase. It has been decided that the new regulations will be implemented starting from the 10th. The grain, cocoon, and flour associations telegraphed to request that the previous special prices be maintained. Otherwise, they would have to use waterway transportation by the wheel bureau (shipping company). The Traffic Department approved that the special prices would still be charged and telegraphed the Wuxi Railway Station to inform them.</p>
<p>After the Collapse of the Building at the Middle East Theater: It has been learned that the building of the Middle East Theater on Dongxin Road outside Guangfu Gate in this county suddenly collapsed the day before yesterday, injuring more than 60 spectators. Yesterday, Wang Xiezhong, the head of the Second Public Security Sub-bureau in charge of the area, considering the case to be related to the collapse of a building causing injury, ordered the police to summon Yao Ganshi, the representative of the theater's shareholders, Li Huanwen, the manager, and Guo Yulian, the carpenter who built the building, to the bureau for a preliminary hearing. Yao Ganshi stated that the construction of the Middle East Theater was a joint venture, and he was only a representative. The collapse of the building was due to both natural causes and poor construction. Therefore, he has turned over the carpenter Guo Yulian to the bureau for filing. As for the main cause of the collapse, there is a report that he would like the bureau to investigate in detail. Li Huanwen stated that he rented the theater from Yao Ganshi. The collapse of the building should be the responsibility of Yao Ganshi and has nothing to do with him. Guo Yulian stated that the house was built last year, with a total of twelve rooms. He is not in charge now and is unable to bear all the responsibilities. Wang Jun reviewed the statements and prepared a document to be transferred to the General Bureau for review. As for the injured, 26 people, including Zhang Zhongquan, went to Tongren Hospital for further examination yesterday. Among them, Wang A'le's injuries were the most serious.</p>
<p>Inheritance Dispute Between Wife and Concubine in Court: Yu Ziming, a deceased wealthy man in Yangshuyuan, District 16, first married Hu as his wife but had no children. Later, he married Bian as a concubine. After Ziming's death, it was discussed by relatives and decided that Wen Zai, his nephew, would be adopted as his heir according to Ziming's will. All the inheritance would be divided according to shares. However, Yu's concubine Bian gave birth to a posthumous child named Yi Gen, who is now three years old. Therefore, there were disagreements and conflicts in the family. Recently, Bian filed a complaint with the County Court, claiming that her son Yi Gen had been harmed by Hu, who had hidden arsenic in longans and gave them to Yi Gen to eat. There were also witnesses Kuang Juming and Kuang Renpei who testified. According to the complaint, Prosecutor Du summoned both parties to court yesterday and opened a hearing. The longans were sent to the Labor Hospital for testing. The results showed that the longans contained a substance similar to arsenic poison. Therefore, Yu Hu was ordered to be taken into custody, and Yu Bian and others were ordered to return.</p>

The couple were quite loving. Unexpectedly, Agou suddenly joined the army two years ago and has not been heard from since. Jiang is in her youth and unaccustomed to sleeping alone, so she was seduced into adultery by Ge Daliu, a local ruffian, and the scandal spread. This year in June, Agou returned home after being discharged from the army. The adulterer and adulteress felt uneasy, so they planned a poisonous scheme. The day before yesterday, while Agou was fast asleep, they suddenly held a sharp knife and stabbed him in the throat. Agou shouted in extreme pain, and his forehead was also injured by the knife, alarming the neighbors. The adulterer and adulteress were tied up together and sent to the County Government for questioning.</p>

<p>Unprecedented Flood in Hundreds of Years: Since the opening of the Guihai Three Dams in this county, the four townships outside the dikes have been breached by the dam water, inundating countless fields and drowning many people and livestock. It is now heard that the Cheluonan Dike was also breached by the dam water last night. Although gongs were sounded to alert people to rush to the rescue, it was too late. The dike has over ten thousand acres of farmland and over a thousand households, all of whom perished. Currently, the disaster victims from the breached dikes are gathering on the mounds in the Gao Miao Dike, numbering about two to three thousand people. The situation is extremely miserable. Residents of the city are buying dry food and hiring boats to send to them in an endless stream. The water is very high in the Huxi area, and the fields have been completely inundated. The towns of Minjiaqiao and Songjiaqiao are seven to eight feet deep. The general disaster victims without clothing or food are in imminent danger. Floating corpses are everywhere, making it unbearable to witness. The Gaoyou Red Cross Society has dispatched staff member Zhang Shihao, hired several large boats to cross the lake for rescue, and set up a Huxi refugee shelter in the City God Temple in the city. This county has suffered this unprecedented disaster, which has not been seen in hundreds of years. The County Party Department, due to this year's flood causing disaster and the people's livelihood having been destroyed, has telegraphed the Provincial Party Department to forward to the Central Relief Committee for relief.</p>

<p>Tragic Situation of Flood in Huaiyin: Huaiyin County, connected to Huai'an in the south and bordering the south bank of the Grand Canal in the north, since the breach of the Fugong Dike 60 miles south of the county seat on the 2nd of this month, the Hongze Lake water has flowed north. Except for the area of six or seven and a half fang in Huai'an territory, the surrounding area of over a hundred miles has been inundated, with countless deaths of people and animals, and houses and fields washed away. By the 5th, the water had risen to the Gaosheng Bridge, Futian Temple, and the southern end of the South Gate drill ground in Huaiyin. Not only is there no hope for the autumn harvest, but everyone is in danger in terms of their lives. Today (6th), disaster victims outside the South Gate have moved into the city. Those who are unable to move are gathering to repair the old earth embankment barracks on the drill ground to prepare for moving in. As for the residents along the Grand Canal on the north side of the city, they have been completely flooded and have moved to the city walls to live. Coupled with the incessant rain, they have nowhere to return. The situation is unprecedentedly tragic. The firewood and rice merchants have greatly increased prices due to inconvenient transportation and cut-off supplies. However, the river water is still increasing. The future disaster is still unknown. The Liang Guanying troops stationed in Huaiyin and Huai'an counties are currently repairing dangerous works in various places such as Matou, Yangzhuang and Qingjiang in Huaiyin, Ma'tou, Yangzhuang, and Qingjiang, because of the increased water flow and incessant rain. In addition to the Independent Regiments of Pistol, Special Service and Artillery stationed in Huaiyin being assigned to Huai'an, the 96th Brigade stationed in Huai'an is also repairing the dangerous works because the county town is low-lying and the river embankments are less than one foot above the water surface. If there is a storm, or the water continues to rise, the lives and property of the entire city will be at the mercy of the water. The area of 20-li Fort south of the county seat is particularly important. Therefore, Brigade Commander Wang Xiuchen personally supervised his subordinates, the 286th Regiment and the Special Service Team, to go to repair. At the same time, he still sent detectives along the canal to scout. The people of Huaiyin are all grateful.</p>

<p>Parricide Case Culprit Captured: Lu Deyuan, a tailor from Shiyantou outside the East Gate of Pinghu, was beaten to death by his son A'long. The culprit was on the run and had not been captured. It is now learned that A'long had fled to Fan Erhe's house, a bankrupt household in Xinfeng Town, under the jurisdiction of Jiaxing County in the West Township. It was then learned of by Pinghu County Government. The law enforcement officers were ordered to go to Xin and join the local water and land police to apprehend him. He was seen by chance in the West Market. The culprit immediately jumped into the river and hid at the bottom. Because he was very good at swimming, he almost escaped. Fortunately, he was caught and apprehended by the local fishermen and brought back to Pinghu. After a thorough investigation by Judge Song, A'long confessed that his deceased father was addicted to alcohol and physically weak and had fallen to his death. The judge saw that he was constantly denying it, so he asked him why he had fled after his father's death, which clearly showed his guilt. Moreover, it was found that he had injuries on his body, which were indeed caused by being beaten to death before his death, and there was no room for evasion. A'long was ordered to be taken into custody pending investigation and verification.</p>
<p>Impersonating Recruitment Director Arrested: Wang Yi and four others from West Gate Street in Pinghu were playing Majiang at the home of a Mr. Lu when Zhang Jianhong, who claimed to be the recruitment director from Haiyan, broke in and arrested them and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for punishment. Zhu Yan, the recruitment director of Yanping (Haiyan and Pinghu) heard about it and arrested Zhang and sent him to the General Office in Hangzhou for legal action.</p>

<p>Dr. Sven Hedin Praises Sino-Foreign Scientific Cooperation</p>
<p>According to Swedish dispatches, Dr. Sven Hedin has been giving speeches throughout Sweden, vigorously promoting the positive results of the Sino-Swedish Northwestern Expedition. He particularly praised the contributions of the Chinese members. He stated that when the cooperation agreement was signed with China four years ago, many foreigners in Beiping were skeptical, believing that long-term expeditions by Chinese and foreign members would inevitably lead to conflict. However, Dr. Hedin resolutely accepted all the conditions requested by China, and the smooth progress over the past four years has been deeply satisfying. He believes that any future explorations in China must first obtain the strong assistance of Chinese scholars. Hedin also mentioned that the Beiping Committee for the Preservation of Antiquities provided generous assistance to the expedition, offering strong guidance regarding the organization of the expedition's Section C and its dealings with central or local Chinese officials. As for the Sino-Swedish members, they were on good terms and treated each other with sincerity. Although minor misunderstandings were inevitable, they quickly dissipated upon explanation, without hindering the progress of the expedition. Hedin expressed great admiration for the work of the Chinese members, stating that the value of their contributions would become even more evident after the expedition's findings are organized and announced. He noted that Dr. Yuan Tongli was an especially rare scholar, with extensive knowledge and diligence. He served continuously for four years, making significant discoveries in paleontology, geology, archeology, and topography. His discovery of dinosaur footprints north of the Tianshan Mountains, east of Urumqi, in 1928, was an unforgettable achievement. These dinosaurs were previously unknown, and Dr. Yuan named them "Tianshan Dinosaurs." He also praised paleontologist T.H. Ting and archeologist Huang Wen-pi, who were both young and eager to explore the west. Huang's topographical surveys of Loulan and Lop Nor were particularly insightful and profound, earning Dr. Hedin's praise. Furthermore, Li and Liu, who had a deep understanding of meteorology, are now studying in Germany. Hedin believes that they will make significant contributions to world science. He also admired Professor Xu Bingchang, the leader of the Chinese members, for his extensive knowledge and humble demeanor. In addition, there was Mr. Chen, a crystallographer and astronomer who accompanied Dr. Nils in his exploration of the Lop Desert; Mr. Hao, who accompanied Dr. David Haman in his exploration of botany in Sichuan and Gansu; and two Chinese students who accompanied Dr. Aldemar Haude in his exploration of meteorology in Mongolia. All were young, eager to learn, and made significant contributions. However, he noted that it was unfortunate that one member from both the Chinese and Swedish sides died during the expedition. Hedin expressed his deepest gratitude for the diligent assistance of the National Government and the Beiping Committee for the Preservation of Antiquities. He also mentioned that Mr. Forke Bergmans had previously discovered Han Dynasty bamboo slips in Ejin Banner (transliteration). In 1930, Hedin proposed to China that these slips be translated by Professor Bernard Karlgaen of Sweden. China agreed, but the professor stated that he would only accept the task with the assistance of Chinese scholars. Therefore, it was decided that the translation of these slips would be a Sino-Swedish collaboration, with Professor Karlgaen representing the Swedish side and Professor Liu Fu (transliteration) representing the Chinese side. The complete collection of slips is stored in Beiping. The clearest slips will be photographed and sent to Switzerland, while the original slips will remain in Beiping for Professor Liu Fu to translate. Subsequently, the two professors will each present the results of their research separately at a joint conference in Beiping or Gothenburg, Sweden, to continue their research. This work is very difficult and time-consuming, requiring at least several years to complete. However, its completion will undoubtedly open a new and unprecedented era in Sino-Swedish academic history. This project originated from Dr. Hedin's proposal and China's approval, which is why Dr. Hedin always mentions this matter in his speeches, elaborating on it to express his heartfelt joy.</p>

<p>Since the Zhujing filicide case occurred, various entertainment venues in the city have been competing to produce and perform plays based on it. The city's Education Bureau, considering the case to be related to morality, has repeatedly and strictly banned such performances, and they have finally disappeared. However, while the city is in the midst of this ban, the Public Education Center organized by the Education Bureau of Jinshan County suddenly adapted the entire case into a play and performed it. Upon hearing this news, the city's Education Bureau immediately sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education requesting that it be banned. Approval has been received, and the Jinshan County Education Bureau has been strictly ordered to stop the performance immediately and destroy the script of the play.</p>

<p>The education community of Wuxian, feeling that the director's measures were inappropriate, sent telegrams of petitions, as reported in this newspaper. We now understand that the school principals held a meeting at the Education Association yesterday, requesting that the association suggest assistance from the provincial representatives' conference. Regarding the Education Bureau, they also plan to send a letter requesting three points: (1) The budget for the 1931 school year should be appropriately increased according to the funding standards of the 1929 school year to maintain the education of the entire county.

<p>The President of the U.S. Welcomes Chinese Students, Hosted by the Student Association Last Month</p>
<p>The Global Chinese Students' Association at No. 95 Kad Road has been organizing study abroad receptions for more than 20 years. They regularly communicate with Chinese student associations in various countries. Yesterday, they received a letter from the Chinese Students' Association at the University of Illinois in the United States, stating that the association can send people to welcome Chinese students upon their first arrival in the United States. The original letter is transcribed as follows: Greetings, it has been found that Chinese students studying in the United States often encounter difficulties in finding accommodation and completing admission procedures upon arriving at their designated schools for the first time, due to unfamiliarity with the place, customs, and habits. Such suffering is experienced by most students, except for a very small number who can entrust acquaintances to take care of them. In view of this, our association has specially requested that in the future, whenever you encounter students who plan to study in the United States, please immediately inform the president of our association, Li Jiashan, or the chairman of the Liaison Committee, Liu Chuanshu (both located at 112 W University Ave, Urban, 111, USA) before they board the train for the school upon arriving on the American shore, and tell them when they will board the train, from where, which route they will take, and when they expect to arrive. Our association will send people to the station on time to meet and take care of them, in order to alleviate the suffering of those who come from afar and to fulfill our responsibilities. We have always admired your association's utmost concern for the study abroad community, and we believe you will be happy to support us.</p>

<p>This Month on the 16th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Swimming Association is working hard to train in preparation for the upcoming City Sports Meet so that they can attend the National Games. The committee recently convened a meeting, and Ms. Song Shujia proposed that instructors should fulfill their obligations. As it is difficult to find instructors, it is impossible to meet the demand with just Mr. Yu Binqi. The only solution is to set specific times and ask him to guide on one hand, and ask others to guide on the other hand. The entire committee passed the proposal, and it was resolved that the temporary times would be 5:30 PM to 8:00 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 6:00 AM to 8:30 AM on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, at the Hongkou Swimming Pool, and that Mr. Yu would continue to work hard for the time being. It was also proposed to go to Qingyang River for practice on the 16th (Sunday). As the association is organized by members of the academic community, transportation will be specially arranged. The cost of the round-trip ticket and meals will be only one dollar. Those who wish to participate, regardless of gender, are welcome to register at the China Products Trading Company, No. 141 Guizhou Road, or at Ms. Song Shujia's office at the Shanghai Bank.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Rice Price Nearing 20 Yuan <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Price Control Fails, Price Rises Another Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>High-Quality White Rice Sells for 19.5 Yuan per Stone</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Bean Trade Association previously held a meeting and decided that the highest price for white rice should not exceed 17 yuan per stone, with lower grades priced accordingly. The situation was reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. Retail rice shops in Zhabei became panicked and rushed to buy rice. Yesterday, they secretly raised prices in what was called an "unofficial market," with top-grade white rice rising to 19.5 yuan. An investigation revealed that the retail rice shops had previously been wary of stockpiling rice due to the hot and humid weather, fearing insect infestation and grain damage. Now that autumn has arrived, their rice reserves are depleted. Moreover, due to the heavy rains and floods in the interior, the supply of rice has become scarce. In previous years, even when rice prices rose, various types of imported rice were available as substitutes. This year, however, aside from a small amount of Saigon rice and machine-milled rice (also known as Min Dang rice), the rest is domestically produced. Yesterday, no rice arrived at the docks. All the rice boats had arrived in the previous few days, and the boat owners were hoarding their goods, unwilling to sell them cheaply. Under these circumstances, the shops had no choice but to secretly raise prices and compete for rice in order to supply the market. The rice prices from yesterday are listed below, generally showing an increase of about one yuan per stone compared to the previous day. Glutinous rice increased by 1.2 yuan. The details are as follows: Highest grade white rice: 19.5 yuan per stone (the above is the purchase price, the selling price must be 20 yuan, and so on). Next grade: 18.8 yuan. Next grade: 17.5 yuan (i.e., third-grade white rice). Early rice: 17.4 yuan. Pudong new rice: 17 yuan. Bian Yuan glutinous rice: 16.7 yuan (previously sold for 15.5 yuan). Imported Xian rice: 17.5 yuan. Next grade: 17 yuan. Du Xian rice: 17.5 yuan. Next grade: 17 yuan. Ke Xian rice: 15.5 yuan. Next grade: 14.5 yuan (the above are all domestically produced). Machine-milled rice: 16.5 yuan. Saigon rice: 15.4 yuan per 200 pounds (equivalent to one stone, previously sold for 10.02 yuan) (the above are imported rice).</p>

<p>Design Committee Meeting The Anti-Japanese Association's Design Committee held its fourth committee meeting yesterday at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce meeting room. The attending committee members included Li Quanshi, Li Wenjie, Zhu Wenqi, Xu Yongzuo, Chen Songyuan, Que An , Feng Yixian, Zhou Jingshen, Ma Shaoquan, Kui Tingfang, and fifteen others. Li Wenjie was elected as chairman, and Xue Guangqian as recorder. Matters reported: (1) A total of 31 opinion letters were received, summarized into 21 categories and included in the discussion items. (2) Xue Guangqian was appointed as the secretary of the association, and Hu Jingan as the clerk. Next, matters resolved: (1) The executive committee submitted that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Dyeing and Weaving Industry Federation had initiated an automatic fundraising campaign to establish a yarn factory, which was approved and filed for record. (2) For essential industrial raw materials, all industries should voluntarily organize raw material factories and levy an industrial fund within two months. Before the factories are established, the association will review requests from the industry associations and temporarily issue passes for those that are indeed essential industrial raw materials, provided that the fund is levied and held in trust. This fund will be transferred when the industry establishes its factory. (3) The association has received many letters from the public offering opinions, and should publish acknowledgements in the newspaper. (4) In the future, when factories need to continue to determine essential raw materials, they should apply through the trade associations or national goods groups to prevent abuses. (5) The association should send telegrams to party departments and chambers of commerce across the country to promptly organize anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese aid associations. The above five proposals were all passed and recommended for adoption and implementation by the executive committee. (6) The proposal to formulate a five-year industrial plan as a comprehensive plan for a complete economic severance with Japan was passed. Li Quanshi, Xu Yongzuo, and Kui Tingfang were appointed to draft the plan. (7) The proposal to elect standing committee members of the association was approved. Li Wenjie, Zhu Wenqi, and Lu Qisheng were elected as standing committee members. (8) The proposal to temporarily hold meetings once a week due to the busy work of the association was approved.</p>
<p>Do Not Use Japanese Seafood The Design Association suggested sending a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to advise all industries not to use Japanese seafood. The letter stated: "We are writing to inform you that seafood is largely imported from Japan. According to customs records, the annual import volume is alarming, with tens of millions of dollars in profits flowing out. We use our hard-earned money to allow the Japanese to manufacture weapons to kill our compatriots. Thinking of this is heartbreaking. Just imagine that the Japanese arbitrary violence in Korea, even if it is not delicacies, must be bloody. If you recall the corpses of the dead overseas Chinese compatriots all over the field, even if it is as beautiful as jade food delicacies, it is difficult to swallow. Our Association is entrusted by people from all walks of life to uphold the ambition of lying down and trying courage, and vigorously implement economic severance with Japan, and vow to make the final struggle. Since Japanese seafood is not a necessity of daily use, it can be refused without using it. Donating the subtle sweetness of the teeth and cheeks to save the madness of the collapse, its benefit to the anti-Japanese movement is not fresh and rare. Correspondingly, please check and transfer it to the relevant industry associations, and follow it together. I am deeply looking forward to it. "</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions from All Sectors The Anti-Japanese Association issued a notice yesterday stating: "Since the establishment of the association, we have received many valuable opinions from people from all walks of life, which can be used as a guide. We are deeply grateful. Some people have also visited the association to give advice, which is even more heartwarming, patriotic and enthusiastic. In the future, if there are any opinions on anti-Japanese aid to overseas Chinese and reforms to the association's measures, please send them to us to benefit the association and promote the anti-Japanese movement."</p>

<p>Two District Party Departments</p>
<h3 id="e120">Telegram of Condolences to the Soldiers Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The people of all circles in this city have repeatedly heard that wherever the national army's banners point, the evil spirits disappear, and everyone is jumping for joy and sending telegrams of condolences. The following is a telegram sent by the two district party departments:</p>
<p>District Party Department To Commander-in-Chief Chiang and all the soldiers suppressing the bandits: The red bandits are rampant and spreading disasters. The three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are full of devastation. The production in the disaster area has been completely destroyed, and the social economy is on the verge of collapse. The severity of the harm is known to everyone. Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang has risen up with divine might, mobilized various armies, and launched a major attack. He personally took the lead and supervised the troops, and the soldiers followed orders and achieved success. The people were saved from fire and water, and the common people were saved from hanging upside down. The great achievements will last forever, benefiting the masses and contributing to the party and the country. We send a telegram of condolences to express our admiration. Shanghai Special City District Executive Committee bows.</p>
<p>Fourth District Party Department To Commander-in-Chief Chiang of the Nanjing Land, Sea, and Air Forces and the soldiers at the front: The country is in great difficulty, and the red bandits are rampant, slaughtering, burning, and looting, which is tragic and inhumane. In particular, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces have suffered the most, and millions of lives are in dire straits. It is unbearable to witness and unbearable to hear. Fortunately, you and the brave and hardworking soldiers have embraced the spirit of fearlessness, disregarded the summer heat, led the troops to conquer, planned strategies, and dismantled the rebels. Wherever the banners pointed, the red spirits disappeared, and victories were reported one after another within half a month. The red bandits will be wiped out soon. When the good news came, the whole country was celebrating. I hereby send a telegram of congratulations and express my condolences. The Fourth District Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City bows.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Opposition to the Swiss Consul's Shielding of Communists Continues <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The opposition from all sectors of society in this city to the case of the Swiss consul shielding communists is becoming increasingly fierce. The following are declarations of opposition from various sectors:</p>
<p>Caojing and Fahua Two District Farmers Associations At present, the red bandits are rampant, which is not only enough to avoid harming the life of the country, but also enough to destroy social stability. They disregard humanity, kill people, set fires, and poison living beings, which is not only hated by the people of our country, but also intolerable to the world. At the time when our government is actively suppressing the red bandits in Jiangxi, Hunan, and other places, fortunately, with the soldiers' efforts and the people's efforts, the red scourge is gradually disappearing. However, the communists lurking in various places are always thinking about moving. Shanghai is located in a strategic location and has long been the focus of attention of the red bandits. Furthermore, the concession can be used as a talisman, so most of the important figures of the red bandits live in it to plan their inhumane killing work. On June 16 this year, Noulens, the leader of the Eastern Department of the Third International, and his wife were arrested together, and hundreds of important evidences were copied out, including the plan to command the Red Army to fight and the use of poison gas. It is shocking to hear. When the criminal was sent to court, Noulens confessed to being a Belgian, and his wife confessed to being French. After inquiring, the two countries did not have such people. The Second Court Judge Song interrogated and ruled that the Garrison Headquarters should bring up the case. However, the Swiss consul sent a letter to the police station, admitting that the criminal was a Swiss national and opposed the extradition. After investigation, the criminal's language was contradictory and the situation was false. Moreover, the criminal did not register with Switzerland and had no Swiss passport. It is obvious that he has no nationality and is not Swiss. However, the Swiss consul dared to do this, which shows the absurd fact of shielding the Communist Party. The members of this association hereby give a serious warning, if you do not repent, and are willing to be a tiger , we will request the government to sever diplomatic relations and deport you, and we will not tolerate it. We hereby declare, Caojing District Farmers Association and Fahua District Farmers Association all bow.</p>
<p>First District Party Department The weakness of our country is due to the generous gifts of imperialists. In the era of imperialism, imperialists forced various unequal treaties with military force. After the establishment of the Republic of China, they used tricks to use warlords to kill each other and take advantage of them. However, the sinister and treacherous of this white imperialist is not as good as today's red imperialist under the wings of the Soviet Union. Thinking about the conspiracy to seize the party's power sixteen years ago to try to occupy it, and after the Qing Dynasty, the riots and occupations in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, etc., everything can make people shudder and split their eyes, and feel heartbroken and painful. Today, the suppression of the red is successful, and the giant Kui (Noulens and his wife, the leaders of the Communist Party in the Eastern Department) is arrested, and the people are celebrating. However, the Swiss Consulate suddenly willingly acted as a slave for Red Russia, falsely claiming nationality. It is impossible to predict the intention, and the absurdity of the action is no more than this. Destroying international credibility and fueling the red scourge in China is responsible. I hope that the people of the whole country will rise up to be the backing of the government, urge the government to inform the Swiss Minister, correct and impeach, and announce it to the world, so that the negotiations will be victorious and the giant Kui will be executed. The people of the whole country are very fortunate, and I hereby declare, the First District Executive Committee bows.</p>
<p>Eighth District Party Department The scourge of the Communist Party is worse than water and fire, and all countries in the world regard it as a public enemy. This time, Noulens and his wife, the leaders of the Eastern Department of the Communist Party, were arrested in the Shanghai Public Concession on June 16, and hundreds of important reactionary evidences were copied out, the most of which were the plans to command the Red Army to fight and the methods of using gas. When the criminals were arrested, Noulens claimed to be a Belgian national, and his wife claimed to be a French national. Later, the authorities sent telegrams to Belgium and France to inquire, and there was no such person. Therefore, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent a letter to the Second Branch of the Special Court for extradition. The criminals knew that their crimes could not be concealed, so they did not hesitate to spend a lot of money to bribe the Swiss Consul in Shanghai. On the 8th of this month, the case was brought to court, and it was admitted that the criminal was a Swiss national. Judge Song of the Second Court of the Special Zone ordered the representative of the Consul to produce evidence of nationality, but nothing was obtained. It can be seen that the Swiss Consul was completely drunk by the magic of money. It is so hateful that he dares to come out and shield the Communist Party, regardless of public law and regardless of the world. All my compatriots should vow to fight to the death and rise up to resist. I hereby declare.</p>

<p>Celebration Held at the German Consulate</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the promulgation of the German Constitution, and the German expatriates in this city held a passionate celebration. The German Consul General Baron Collenberg received congratulations at the consulate at 11:30 a.m. and treated the guests. Many Chinese and foreign officials and businessmen attended.

<h3 id="e123">Navigation News After the Typhoon Passed <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The wind in this city weakened slightly yesterday. The Jianghai Customs believed that the typhoon had passed and that there was no danger on the sea, so it ordered the Pudong flag station to lower the warning ball and allow ships to leave the port. It was found that the typhoon had not had a major impact on this city. The information is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Imports Greatly Reduced Yesterday, all the Jianghai ships that were sheltering from the wind on the way were unable to sail. At the same time, there were typhoons in Fuzhou and Qingdao, so only four foreign ships and one sea ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Even the Yangtze River ships did not arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ningbo Ships Arrived The Shanghai-Ningbo ships were suspended due to the typhoon the day before yesterday. As the wind gradually subsided yesterday, there were no ships coming from Shanghai-Ningbo, so there were no exports. However, yesterday afternoon, the China Merchants Sanbei Company received a telegram from Ningbo stating that the Xinjiang, Tianning, and Xinglun ships had decided to leave Ningbo for Shanghai and are expected to arrive today. The Shanghai-Ningbo ships will operate as usual today.</p>
<p>Nanhua Ship Sailed Yesterday afternoon, the wind weakened slightly. The Swire Company's North and South Ocean ships, Xinjiang and Fengtian, sailed in the afternoon, first to Wusong. If the sea was calm, they would go directly to export. In case the waves were still huge, they would moor in Song and wait to export today. Therefore, a total of twenty-four ships sailed out of the Huangpu River yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Change of Director of the Observatory <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Meier He Hosts a Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>Father Laoh, Director of the Xujiahui Observatory, has now retired and will be succeeded by Father Qi. Mr. Meier He, the Chief Commissioner of Customs, hosted a banquet for the two fathers at his residence last night (11th). Minister of Finance Song Ziwen and Director of Customs Zhang Fuyun did not attend due to business. Others present included French Consul General Gan Ge Lin, Customs Commissioner Laufut, Customs Patrol Supervisor Hill Meng, Howard, editor of the North China Daily News, Zhang Zhuping, manager of the Shen Bao, Dong Xian Guang, manager of the Continental Daily, and He Bo Si Ge Lin. Chief Commissioner of Customs Meier He delivered a speech, roughly saying that the cooperation between the Xujiahui Observatory and the Customs has been going on for more than a day, so the retirement of Father Lao this time is a matter of special attention in the Customs. Former Chief Commissioner of Customs Hede established meteorological stations in various customs in 1869, which was the beginning of scientific research. He intended that the area covered by each meteorological station along the river and sea should not be less than 20 degrees of latitude and 10 degrees of longitude, so that valuable meteorological reports could be recorded. As for the cost, in addition to the purchase of instruments, little was given. At that time, the Chinese Customs' observation of meteorological stations was of great value to the scientific community, and it was especially beneficial to the navigation community in the Eastern seas. This is generally recognized. Over the years, the Xujiahui Observatory began to observe meteorological periods and collect valuable statistics. In 1879, a typhoon passed through Shanghai, and its momentum was very strong. The Xujiahui Observatory accurately predicted the direction of the typhoon. Customs Patrol Supervisor Peishi Pi, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and various shipping companies contacted the Xujiahui Observatory and requested it to establish a meteorological station and issue forecasts on a regular basis, so that the public could be aware of the movement of typhoons in Chinese waters. Later, under the guidance of the fathers, it gradually developed. In 1896, Father Lao became the director of the Meteorological Department of the Xujiahui Observatory. Except for two sick leaves in the middle, he held an important position for a long time until last year. Since the death of Father Yalgui, Director of the Manila Observatory, Father Lao is the most famous typhoon expert in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Meier He Hosts a Banquet for the New and Old Directors of the Observatory, with Father Lao Sitting in the Middle and Father Qi on the Left <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>He has contributed a lot to the shipping industry in the Far East and human society, which is worthy of admiration. Father Lao is a world-renowned scientist and mathematician, who has used his life's experience and knowledge to serve mankind and fulfill his obligations purely and without any reward. This is something that we deeply admire. Because Father Lao's forecasts on storms are reported at any time, many ships have been preserved, so the shipping industry must be deeply grateful to him and bless him together. I am very honored to take this opportunity today to praise the father's achievements and thank him for his warm assistance. We are very sorry for the father's departure, but we are also happy for the gain of the successor. The new father will be able to fulfill the duties of Father Lao and maintain the reputation of the Catholic Church with great satisfaction and excellent results. We can foresee. On the one hand, we hope that Father Lao will have unlimited happiness in the future, and on the other hand, we wish the new father success and are willing to continue to cooperate with the Observatory, not only as an obligation, but also as a right to be enjoyed. Then, Father Lao delivered a reply, roughly saying that he was very ashamed and grateful for the praise from Chief Commissioner of Customs Meier He. His only achievement was to be in office for a long time and to do his best to implement the plans of the two previous fathers, Dan and Xue, and to follow the rules. Over the past 50 years, he has received a lot of support from the Customs. Now, on behalf of myself and the Observatory, I would like to thank Chief Commissioner of Customs Meier He and the Customs. If our station did not receive the support of the Customs, the two concession authorities, the Chamber of Commerce, the Telegraph Bureau, and the shipping company, it would not have been possible to achieve such results. Former Chief Commissioner of Customs Hede, various Customs Commissioners, and various Patrol Supervisors have all generously helped and had a very harmonious relationship with our station. The reason why China can have a complete meteorological station and satisfactory results is that we must thank them for establishing storm reporting stations along the coast and transmitting signals to various places. From Niuzhuang to Shantou, all rely on their strength, and the gradual improvement of the signals will be adopted by various countries in the world, and they have also contributed a lot. I have been in office for many years, and once I leave, I cannot help but be moved. However, there is no need to worry about the successor. The new father has helped at our station for 12 years, which is enough to prove his ability. He is deeply convinced of the importance of this position, and is the same as me, and during my vacation, his management is also very satisfactory. In the future, he will be able to continue to maintain the achievements of the past, so the new father's succession to this position is worthy of celebration. I am very grateful for the welcome from Chief Commissioner of Customs Meier He, and I would like to thank you on his behalf.</p>
<p>French Concession Taxpayer Meeting</p>
<h3 id="e126">Inauguration of Supervisory Committee Members Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Request Reduction of Housing Tax by One Percent</p>
<p>Should Increase Chinese Directors and Reorganize Merchant Corps</p>
<p>The French Concession Taxpayers' Association of Chinese held its second inaugural meeting of the Supervisory Committee yesterday at 4:00 PM. Committee members Jin Liren, Gong Jingyan, Dong Kechang, Shang Mujing, Wei Tingrong, Zhu Shengmao, Cheng Zhusun, Tong Lizhang, Shen Zhongjun, Xie Qianggong, Li Huailiang, Xu Xiuting, Qu Zhenhua, Bei Zairong, Chen Dezhang, Lu Bohong, Tao Leqin, Pan Zhaobang, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng (representing Shang Mujing), Xu Caicheng, Huang Jinrong (representing Gong Jingyan), Yuan Ludeng, Lou Hongjun, and 24 others were present. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Inauguration of Committee Members After all the committee members entered the room and took their seats, the entire group stood up and saluted the party's national flag. The committee members then bowed to each other and were officially inaugurated.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings The meeting was presided over by Cheng Zhusun and Shang Mujing, with Tong Lizhang as recorder. First, Cheng Zhusun reported on the past negotiations with the French Municipal Council regarding the increase of Chinese directors and committee members. He stated that previously there were only three Chinese directors, appointed by the French Consul-General. After the association raised its request, the number was increased to five, and nine Chinese committee members were added, all formally elected by the association. However, among the nine committee members, only three were able to participate in the meetings of various groups, while six remained unassigned, which was as good as a formality. Therefore, the association must continue to actively negotiate. Regarding the association's financial issues, after the charity fair held in 1927, there was a surplus of over 17,000 yuan. After continuous expenditures, there was still a remaining balance of over 3,000 yuan. A detailed report is being printed and will be distributed soon for verification. In addition, all proposals will be discussed separately. Next, Shang Muqin reported on (1) a letter from Chairman Du Yuesheng, requesting to resign from his position as chairman because a Chinese director could also serve as chairman of the association; (2) that future association affairs should be handled by the chairman on a daily rotating basis; (3) that he hoped that all committee members would conscientiously take responsibility for their duties to facilitate progress. Next, committee members Yuan Ludeng, Xie Qianggong, Tao Leqin, and Qu Zhenhua expressed their opinions, which were all incorporated into the proposals for discussion.</p>
<p>Resolutions (1) On the resignation of Chairman Du, it was resolved to retain him, and Qu Zhenhua, Zhu Shengmao, Xu Xiuting, Li Weiliang, Tao Leqin, Ye Weizhai, and seven others were nominated as representatives. (2) Regarding the proposal to reduce the housing tax, it was resolved to reduce the tax from the previously stipulated 1.4% to 1.3%. Given the current prosperity of the market and the increase in housing construction, the Municipal Council's revenue has also increased. The previously retained one percent of the tax should be promptly implemented and reduced, with collection still at 1.2%. (3) Regarding the proposal to improve the tax collection method, it was resolved that in the future, if the rent is in silver, the tax should be collected based on the silver amount to ensure fairness. (4) Regarding the continued request to increase the number of Chinese directors, it was resolved to increase the number of Chinese directors based on the proportion of Chinese and foreign taxes to ensure equality, and to negotiate with the French Municipal Council after consulting with the Chinese directors first. (5) Regarding the request to reorganize the merchant corps, since the cessation of the Sino-French Volunteer Corps, the association has repeatedly requested the French authorities to reorganize the merchant corps. The French authorities had agreed to the organization, but it has not yet been realized. The association should continue to urge its implementation. (6) Regarding the proposal to prioritize the employment of Chinese in the French Concession public service, it was resolved that since the Public Concession's practice of prioritizing the employment of Chinese in its offices had yielded good results, the association should write to the French authorities to follow suit. (7) Regarding a citizen's inquiry about whether the French Municipal Council's new purchase of land in the western district was necessary, it was resolved to report after a detailed investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Urging the Reopening of the National Products Market <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, regarding the case of the Municipal Council's order to close the National Products Market, had previously sent a letter of inquiry but has not received a reply. Yesterday, they sent another letter urging a response, stating: Regarding the case of the Municipal Council's emergency disposition of the National Products Market on June 9th, this association sent a letter of inquiry on June 12th, asking two questions of the Municipal Council. As of February, a reply has not been received. The two questions asked in the letter were very simple: Whether this emergency disposition was an act that undermined the principle of the rule of law in the Public Concession and constituted an act exceeding the scope of power conferred by the fundamental law. It seems that the Municipal Council intends to avoid the matter by not replying. Although this association cannot guess the reason, it extremely disapproves of the principle of the rule of law in the Public Concession being undermined by this kind of act. Therefore, please investigate the above-mentioned letter and provide a clear reply to prove whether the Municipal Council has undermined the principle of the rule of law. To the Director of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Wei Sheng Steamer Ran Aground Off Xiamen <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Ship Is Unlikely to Be Salvaged</p>
<p>All Passengers Rescued</p>
<p>The Comprador Fell into the Sea and Died</p>
<p>Due to the hurricane at sea, all coastal steamers of various companies in Shanghai were suspended. The Wei Sheng, a Southern China steamer of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., was sailing from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Due to the storm, it ran aground off Xiamen, causing damage to the ship, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, a reporter investigated the matter and learned that the ship had taken on water and the passengers had been rescued. They may arrive in Shanghai today. The follow-up report is as follows:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Accident The Wei Sheng was carrying cargo and passengers from the ports of Hong Kong and Guangdong to Shanghai. On the morning of the 10th, when the ship arrived at Nanwan (transliteration) off Xiamen, it encountered a hurricane at sea. For safety reasons, the captain, Mr. Hoxhis, decided to seek shelter in the Nanwan Strait. Unexpectedly, the waves were large and the water was turbulent, causing the bottom of the ship to strike a reef. The reef punctured four large holes in the bottom of the ship, and seawater rushed into the ship, causing it to sink, creating a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Rescue Efforts When the ship had the accident, the captain tried to send a direct telegram, but it could not get through. He first sent it to Jilong, and then Jilong relayed the telegram to the Shanghai and Hong Kong offices, requesting them to send ships to help rescue. The Shanghai office received the report and immediately telegraphed Jilong, asking them to send a ship nearby to rescue. After the Hong Kong headquarters received the news, it ordered the Heng Sheng, which was in Hong Kong, to sail to Nanwan to rescue.</p>
<p>Passengers Rescued When the Heng Sheng arrived at Nanwan, the main cabin of the Wei Sheng was already flooded and was about to sink. Because it was difficult to tow it out of the shallows at that time, the Heng Sheng had to lower lifeboats into the sea to rescue all the passengers and crew members of the Wei Sheng and then sailed to Shanghai. It may arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Comprador Fell into the Sea During the Wei Sheng accident, the wind and waves at sea were extremely strong. A comprador on the ship happened to come out of the cabin and was on the deck when a large wave hit him. The comprador was swept into the sea, and his body has not been found. Although the crew members of the ship tried to search for him, they have not been able to find him.</p>
<p>Ship Damage The Wei Sheng is an excellent ocean liner in the Jardine Matheson Southern China fleet, with a load of nearly 3,000 tons. This time, it carried a large amount of cargo and passengers from Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Shantou to Shanghai. According to the telegram from the company yesterday, the total loss of the ship, cargo, and private goods is at least around one million.</p>

<p>However, Two Transfers Are Required</p>
<p>The China Travel Service received a telegram from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway stating that traffic on the Pinghan Railway has fully resumed since the 5th. However, two transfers are required: one at Guangshui Donghuangdian for reloading and one between Hankou and Jiaji for ferrying. However, first and second-class tickets south of Xinyang cannot be sold until the railway notifies them.</p>

<p>The Inspector General of Customs's Talk</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, a report stated that the Jianghai Customs refused to allow the Naval Ministry's aircraft factory to retrieve aircraft engine and other parts shipped from England, causing dissatisfaction among the Naval Ministry authorities with the Jianghai Customs. A reporter from this newspaper met with Mr. Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, yesterday and talked about the matter. According to Mr. Maze, the Customs has always complied with the special regulations promulgated by the National Government regarding the reporting of military equipment, aircraft, and other national goods. For those that require tax exemption, it is necessary to request approval from the Ministry of Finance, which will then instruct the Customs to verify and exempt the tax. Only then can the Customs release the goods tax-free. The Customs itself has no right to exempt or detain any goods without reason. Although the aircraft parts, etc., reported by the Naval Ministry's aircraft factory held a passport approved by the National Government for import, the Customs had not received an order from the Ministry of Finance to exempt the tax. The factory had also not submitted a tax exemption passport from the Ministry of Finance for verification. Therefore, the Customs was unable to allow the tax-free retrieval of the goods. Therefore, the Customs had no intention of deliberately creating difficulties in this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Telegrams Received by the Red Cross Society Appealing for Relief <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>All About the Flood...Millions of Refugees</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received telegrams appealing for relief yesterday, which are summarized as follows: (1) The Liyang Red Cross Branch: The flood in Liyang is similar to that of the Daoguang twenty-ninth year of the Qing Dynasty. At this time of intertwined military and famine, there is no clothing, food, or shelter. What will the future hold? The branch's summer hospital opened as scheduled on the twenty-fourth of the previous month and was expected to last for three months. Now, due to the flood, the people are even more miserable, and it is even more important for the hospital to continue to extend its term. It is hoped that the head office will do its best to provide assistance to do more charity for the local area and reduce the suffering of the local area. We are anxiously awaiting orders. (2) The Bengbu Red Cross Branch: To the General Office of the Chinese Red Cross Society in Shanghai, recently, a telegram was received from the branch office in Guzhen, reporting that continuous rain has caused a disaster, and the waters are raging. Along the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, the fertile fields in Guzhen and Nansu areas are flooded, and the deaths are piled up. The refugees are crying everywhere. Guzhen is a remote and poor place. After this catastrophe, there are no less than tens of thousands of homeless and foodless disaster victims who are crying for help. The cries move the heavens and the earth. It is indeed an unprecedented disaster. The branch office witnessed the tragic situation and had to report the truth. We beg you to forward it to the head office, send personnel to investigate, and provide disaster relief. We are anxiously awaiting orders. It has been found that this continuous rain has caused disasters all over the country, and the disaster situation along the river in Anhui is even more severe than in other places. For example, the towns and counties in northern Anhui, such as Lingbi, Nansu, Wuhe, Sixian, Yingshang, Shouxian, Huoqiu, Zhengyang, and Huaiyuan, stretch for more than a thousand miles, and are all flooded. The water and the sky are the same color. Even entire families have been drowned and no one has escaped. There are countless people who have no clothing or food and have starved to death. It seems that tens of thousands of lives have no way to survive. Since ancient times, there has never been such a catastrophe. Recently, we have received successive letters and telegrams from various parties, crying for help, and filled with tears. The branch office witnessed it and was heartbroken. It is difficult to turn back. It is our responsibility to rescue and relieve disasters. In addition to convening all members to rush to raise funds, we hereby report the situation and earnestly request that your office send personnel to investigate and provide disaster relief to help the catastrophe. We are anxiously awaiting orders. (3) The Jinshi Chamber of Commerce in Hunan: Unfortunately, Jinshi has been occupied by the Red Bandits twice, and the people have suffered a great catastrophe. The property loss amounts to tens of millions. Now that the banditry has yet to be cleared and the refugees have not yet returned, unexpectedly, on the sixth of the month, there was heavy rain, and on the seventh, mountain torrents broke out. The entire city's business area has become a swamp. Moreover, the water was fierce and steep, and it rose more than ten feet in just half a day. All the houses, goods, food, tools, and appliances were washed away and soaked, causing huge losses. Moreover, the embankments in the nearby areas were all washed away. Only one or two out of ten of the city's embankments remained. The fields, houses, livestock, and belongings were submerged and washed away, and the sight was everywhere. Thousands of people were also drowned and starved. The water receded slightly on the ninth, but rose again on the tenth, lasting for eight days. There is no hope for the autumn harvest, and it is unbearable to say. The extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster situation are unprecedented since Jinshi was established. Man-made disasters and natural disasters have continued one after another. Alas, our great catastrophe, how can we bear it? Now, refugees are everywhere, sitting and waiting for death. The faces are thin and the bodies are weak, which is heartbreaking. In addition to the county government convening various public legal groups to meet and organize an emergency relief association to call for rescue, the weather is now extremely cold and the rain is incessant. Looking ahead, we are worried. Jianxun and others have weak abilities and cannot handle the aftermath well. Seeing this strange tragedy, we dare to tell our sorrows. We implore you to quickly issue emergency relief to help the relief. We also hope that philanthropists from all walks of life will treat us equally and donate generously. The benevolence and righteousness of the people will be remembered forever. I respectfully send this telegram to appeal urgently. The Chairman of the Jinshi Chamber of Commerce in Hunan, Chen Jianxun, and all the public legal groups in Jinshi, bowed together. (4) The Wukang County Relief Association: Since the beginning of summer in this county, mildew rain has occurred from time to time, and water has accumulated in the ditches. It has been difficult to plant everywhere in the low-lying areas. Unexpectedly, starting from July 23, there was a torrential rain that lasted for six days and nights. Mountain torrents rolled down, and lake water flooded upwards, overflowing the dikes and banks, collapsing and unloading. The fields and crops in the four townships were almost completely submerged, and the number of collapsed houses was countless. It is also difficult to count the number of drowned people and animals. The high ground along the mountain has only revealed a few seedling tips to this day. The scorching sun has been steaming for days, and the seedlings have withered and rotted. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and the disaster victims are trapped and have no way to complain. For this reason, we telegraphed to request that you find a way to provide relief to maintain the people's lives and benefit the disaster victims. The telegram is anxiously awaiting orders. The Wukang County Relief Association bowed.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 4:00 PM, the Shanghai Preparatory Committee for the Jiangxi Emergency Relief Association held a joint meeting of the Presidium and Economic Committee, attended by Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Qin Runqing, Zhang Gongquan, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Peiyuan, and others. Chairman Wang Yiting reported that on the 8th, he received a telegram from Commander Xiong Shihui, instructing that the association be handed over to the Jisheng Association. On the 8th, he transferred the 204,331.5 yuan in relief funds and received a receipt. Now, the Jisheng Association has received a telegram from Commander Xiong Shihui, returning the funds, and the Red Cross Society refuses to accept them again. How should it be handled? It was agreed that it should be temporarily deposited in the Bank of China to await discussion. Wen Lanting proposed that after receiving the telegram, the association should send the full amount of relief funds to the Jisheng Association within one hour and obtain a receipt. A draft was immediately prepared to be published in the newspaper. Chairman Wang Yiting requested that the publication be delayed temporarily. Now that the handover procedures have been completed, how should it be handled? It was agreed that although the funds have been transferred, other printed materials, utensils, seals, and stamps should be sealed up and kept until Mr. Wang Yiting convenes a meeting to handle them.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Telegram from the Fellow Countrymen's Association Appealing for Flood Relief <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Countrymen's Association in Shanghai yesterday sent a telegram to the Nanjing Disaster Relief Committee, the Shanghai Preparatory Committee for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces, the China International Famine Relief Commission, and other charitable organizations appealing for flood relief, stating: Unfortunately, our Sichuan has been plagued by disasters. Alas, our children are asking the heavens without a word. Last year's drought had already spread across ninety counties, and this flood has submerged more than a thousand miles. How can we bear the pain of the semi-dead and semi-alive people? We cannot bear to finish reading the hometown news, where every word is a tear. We lament the disturbances of war, which have reduced the fields to ruins. Since the drought has brought disaster, how can the waves run rampant? Without Li Bing, who will prevent the great river? Du Yu cries in vain and cannot escape the great catastrophe. Waves are three feet high on the ground, sweeping away homes. The Yangtze River overflows along both banks, turning half of it into a swamp. The disaster is especially severe in Pengshui, Xiushan, and Kai County in eastern Sichuan, Guyi, Junlian, and Hejiang in southern Sichuan, Yingshan in northern Sichuan, Quancheng, and the Beijiang River basin in central Sichuan. Thousands of families have been destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of people are wandering without food or shelter. With the jackals in the province running rampant, it is difficult to call on help. Listening to the refugees crying, our hearts are torn apart. The conference has always been concerned about hunger and drowning, and our Sichuan is happy to rely on benevolence and kindness. We hope that the righteous grains will be delivered early so that the disaster victims can be saved. If we can get flesh and bones, we can raise all beings from hell. We will definitely embroider with colored silk and burn incense on Mount Emei. We earnestly appeal and ask you to give alms. We hereby send this telegram and beg you to understand. The Sichuan Fellow Countrymen's Association bowed in truth.</p>

<p>After the resumption of work in the printing industry in this city, the Social Bureau summoned them yesterday for questioning in order to mediate the treatment conditions. Representatives from the Ming Printing Industry Association, Zhang Yixin and Chen Bingxi, and representatives from the Printing Industry Union, Qu Shoukan and Wang Yaoquan, attended. The meeting was presided over by Zhang Shuye of the Social Bureau, and recorded by Wang Zhiqin. The labor side demanded that wages be paid for the three days of shutdown and that methods be found to mediate the treatment conditions as soon as possible. The capital side stated that the shutdown was caused by the workers' automatic change to 80 hours and refused to pay wages. As for the conditions, they must be discussed with the entire industry before negotiations can take place. After repeated guidance from the chairman, it was decided that the capital side would temporarily pay wages for the three days of shutdown. Regarding the treatment conditions, the capital side was required to consult with the entire industry and respond within one week. After the response, a mediation committee will be convened to formally mediate.</p>

Chairman Zhang Zhijiang discussed and resolved the following important cases: (1) General Manager Wu Shan reported that Vice President Jiang Zungui passed away due to illness on August 5. In addition to sending staff to mourn and send wreaths, and flying the flag at half-mast for three days in mourning, the position of Vice President represents the President, performs duties, and leads the outline, which is very important. A member should be appointed to take over. Also, Executive Director Ouyang Guangsheng and others have no representatives to attend the meeting, which does not meet the legal requirements. According to the order of the election in 1929, Zhang Zhijiang, Niu Yongjian, Wang, and Xiang Kangyuan should be successively appointed to replace them. It was resolved and approved. All welcomed the new directors to take office and unanimously elected Director Zhang Zhijiang as the chairman. Director Zhang, as chairman, represented Chairman Wang Zhengting to preside over the meeting and proposed the following cases: (1) The Association's Road Exhibition was previously scheduled to open on September 12 by the Executive Committee. The number of rooms currently rented out, the amount of rent collected, and the progress should be reported by Cao Yunxiang, the chairman of the Exhibition Committee. Cao Yunxiang stated that the venue was contracted by Tao Fuxi and construction has started and is scheduled to be completed in three weeks. Admission tickets have been issued and buyers are very enthusiastic because of the special gifts of 30,000 yuan. Chairman Wang came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and was specially invited to meet and arrange a tea party for the executive committee, committee members, and celebrities from China and abroad to report on the preparations and connect feelings. Wang agreed to do so. When the date is set, Wang will coordinate with Vice Presidents Kong and Zhang and Chairman Zhao Jinqing to attend the speech and lead the way. (2) The Association's annual final accounts and budget are usually pushed by four executive directors to collect books and conduct detailed reviews. Mr. Jiang Boqi was originally one of the review committee members, but he is now vacant and another member should be nominated for review. It was resolved and nominated Mr. Xiang Kangyuan as a review committee member and scheduled to work with Zhu Shaoping, Yin Ruli, and Shen Zhongjun. (3) Report on Zhao Xien's letter of resignation. The chairman advocated a reply for retention, and all agreed. (4) Chairman Wang, represented by Yang Xiaotang, proposed to hire Wu Shougon, a former court judge, as a consultant for the Association's legal department. It was resolved and hired. After the meeting adjourned at three o'clock, Yang Xiaotang, Zhu Shaoping, Wu Shan, and Xu Shiying, represented by Qi Yueqi, took a car to inspect the construction of the exhibition venue on West Aixian Road. The venue covers an area of forty or fifty acres and is very large in scale. Mr. Jin Shipai, the West Director, supervises the project on the spot at all times and is very meticulous and busy.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Five Children Seek Immortality and Leave <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Harm Caused by Divine, Strange, Martial Arts Novels</p>
<p>Planned to Go to Mount Emei</p>
<p>Ran Away the Night Before, Destination Unknown</p>
<p>Shop Owner Anxious, the Departed Nowhere to Be Found</p>
<p>Last spring, in March, five boys in Shanghai, each just over ten years old, saw through the vanity of the world and together set off for Mount Emei to study Daoism. This became a popular anecdote for a time. Fortunately, one of the boys was young and timid, unaccustomed to hardship, and deeply homesick, crying constantly. Eventually, his elder brother sent him home. Meanwhile, the families of the other boys were also searching for their whereabouts everywhere. Upon seeing this young boy return, the other four were also eventually found. Their grand ambition to cultivate Daoism thus remained unfulfilled. Do these boys perhaps still regret their past actions? It is unexpected that such things happen more than once in the world. Recently, five more boys in this city, infatuated with the heretical martial arts tales of sword swallowing, pill spitting, and cloud soaring, formed a group to seek immortals and enter the mountains to study Daoism. These five boys were all apprentices, with insufficient clothing and no travel expenses. Before setting off, they pawned their clothes to raise money. Most amusingly, on the day of their departure, each of the boys burned incense and lit candles, swearing to the gods that anyone who showed cowardice or regret would be punished by heaven. Such actions reveal the depth of their poisoning by divine and strange heresies. These boys ran away the night before last and have not been heard from since. They left behind no possessions for their shop owner to remember them by, except for twenty-odd small volumes of "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" in comic book form, found in a broken sack. These martial arts books, with both pictures and text, are likely the starting point for the boys' pursuit of the Dao. Education authorities should pay close attention to such semi-divine, semi-fantastical popular reading materials.</p>
<p>Five Apprentices with Similar Interests, a Group of Five to Study Daoism and Seek Immortality: All were apprentices aged around seventeen or eighteen. The leader, Chen Hexiang, was nineteen years old and an apprentice at a foreign goods store. The others, in order, were Wang Lianfu, nineteen years old; Zhang Ciguan, nineteen years old; Zhang Yaokui, eighteen years old; and Yao Sheng, seventeen years old. Except for Zhang Yaokui, all were from Ningbo. Wang Lianfu and Zhang Ciguan were apprentices at Yang Yunxing's sofa workshop, located at No. 153, Lane 8, De'an Lane, North Shanxi Road. Zhang Yaokui was an apprentice at Yang Rongxing's furniture store at No. 179 Beijing Road. Yao Sheng was an apprentice at Yun Shengtai's sofa workshop. Thus, these five were similar in age and background, and their thoughts easily converged. Chen Hexiang was likely the most literate among them, so his thirst for knowledge was more acute. He was the one who instilled the heretical ideas of studying Daoism.</p>
<p>A Lodger in a Pavilion Led the Disciples: Chen Hexiang previously worked at Bao Xing Foreign Goods Store on Xiamen Road. Recently, seeking better prospects, he lodged with his friend Yu Heming. Yu worked with straw hats and lived in Yang Yunxing's pavilion. Therefore, he was able to associate frequently with his Daoist companions Lianfu, Ciguan, Yaokui, and Yaosheng. The stores of Yang Yunxing, Yang Rongxing, and Yun Shengtai were all opened by Yang Yunsheng. Thus, these five apprentices had many opportunities to meet and talk. Moreover, it was the height of summer, and late-night gatherings to escape the heat provided ample opportunity to discuss divine and strange matters. Thus, this strange play of seeking the Dao gradually matured. Chen Hexiang, the lodger in the pavilion, had little knowledge but was impressed by the talk of gods and Daoism. He loved reading divine and strange novels such as sword immortals and martial arts stories, including "Investiture of the Gods," "Journey to the West," "Seven Swords Thirteen Knights," and "The Marvelous Adventures of Jianghu," which he knew by heart. He was fascinated by the magic of alchemy and swordplay, so his words and expressions were always tinged with the supernatural. When he saw Wang Lianfu and Zhang Ciguan, he confusedly spoke of the Dao and used divine and strange tales to lure them. Thus, within half a month, the two apprentices Wang and Zhang were led by Chen Hexiang and baptized by the heretical teachings of martial arts and the supernatural. The second step was their contagion of Zhang Yaokui and Yaosheng. From then on, the five children shared the same path, all immersed in the cauldron of the supernatural.</p>
<p>Daoist Children Embark on Their Journey in Peculiar Attire: In the past half month, the five's attitude changed drastically. Their actions became secretive, and they often discussed matters privately, as if deliberating on important events. Among the five, Wang Lianfu was the eldest, followed by Chen Hexiang. Wang and Chen were particularly close, so the two were revered as leaders within this small group and called "Elder Brother" and "Second Brother," meaning elder sworn brothers. In addition to indulging in Daoist beliefs, Chen, the "Elder Brother," also worried about national affairs. He was greatly indignant about the Wanzai Massacre and often muttered, clenched his fists, and stretched his legs, vowing to save the country with divine immortal martial arts. The children, already immersed in novels like "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple," readily agreed and eagerly sought the Dao in Sichuan. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 1 p.m., they gathered at the entrance to swear an oath to the gods. At that time, an apprentice happened to pass by and overheard them saying, "Anyone unwilling to depart shall be struck by lightning and burned by fire." At 6 p.m. that evening, this group of Daoist children seeking immortality gathered at the entrance of De'an Lane and departed. According to eyewitnesses, the attire of each child was peculiar and worth amusement. The eldest brother, Wang Lianfu, wore a white twill short shirt and pants, with a black mole on his face for identification. The second sworn brother, Chen Xianghe, wore a undershirt and shorts, holding an oiled paper fan with a solemn Daoist appearance. The third brother, Zhang Ciguan, wore a blue cloth short shirt and pants as Daoist clothing, with one foot in a torn satin shoe and the other in a torn cloth shoe, reportedly due to a hasty departure. The fourth brother, Zhang Yaokui, was dressed similarly, wearing torn white canvas sneakers, speaking with a Jiangbei accent, which was his distinctive feature. Yaosheng, the youngest, had large, double-lidded eyes and brought up the rear, wearing a foreign gauze shirt and pants. The five gentlemen disappeared into the setting sun, never to return.</p>
<p>Shop Owners Anxious, Searching Everywhere: After the five children left, the shop owners were baffled, believing they had run away, and were indescribably anxious, searching everywhere for their whereabouts. It is said that these five apprentices seeking the Dao had repeatedly said they wanted to go to Mount Emei in Sichuan to seek immortals and cultivate Daoism, and they outlined their plan as follows: departing from Shanghai, walking to the South Railway Station, taking a train to Hangzhou, and staying there to cultivate immortality if there were famous monks or heroes. Otherwise, they would resolutely enter Sichuan to seek immortals on Mount Emei. The shop owners initially thought it was a joke and did not take it to heart. Who knew it would actually happen? After the five children left, their companions searched for their belongings but found nothing. All clothing that could be pawned had been pawned to pay for travel expenses. All that remained were dozens of divine and strange books, which caused the shop owners great heartache.</p>
<p>Ye Zengshou Kidnapping Case</p>
<h3 id="e145">Ye Must Appear in Court <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Without His Presence, the Case Cannot Be Clarified</p>
<p>Judge Instructs Ye's Wife to Inform Him</p>
<p>Two Men from Mazhuang Have Been Released</p>
<p>Ye Zengshou, owner of the Zhongfu Import and Export Company at No. 17 The Bund, was kidnapped on the morning of the 4th of last month, at 10:30 a.m., while accompanied by his third concubine, Mrs. Ye, as they were leaving their residence at No. 369 Yulin Road in his private car, license number 4529, intending to visit a doctor on North Sichuan Road for his eye ailment. Just as he boarded the car, he was abducted by kidnappers who sent a letter demanding a large ransom. Ye has since been released, and the Hua detective Wang Xichang of the Bund Police Station has arrested two kidnappers, Xu A'gen and Chen Xingjiang. The Public Security Bureau has also detained two accomplices, Ma Deda and Zhuang Zhangsheng, who have been sent to the police station and transferred to the First District Court for interrogation. These details were reported in this newspaper yesterday morning. Judge Feng Shide presided over the continued trial in the Second Criminal Court. Ye Zengshou did not appear, but his wife, Mrs. Ye Fu, appeared with her legal representative, Lawyer E'sen. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police station presented the case, stating that Xu A'gen and Chen Xingjiang were being prosecuted under Articles 1 and 2 of the Regulations for Punishing Kidnappers. On July 20th, at 9:45 a.m., detectives from the Bund Police Station arrested the defendants Xu A'gen and Xu Rongfu at No. 160 North Shanxi Road. Xu Rongfu has since been released. Chen Xingjiang was subsequently arrested at No. 32 Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan. The other two, Ma and Zhuang, were detained by the Public Security Bureau. Xu and Chen were involved in the kidnapping of Ye Zengshou. After kidnapping Ye, they took him to Zhangjiajiao in Jiangwan and hid him in Chen Xingjiang's house, with Xu A'gen and Chen Xingjiang responsible for guarding him. After ten days, Ye was released for a ransom of ten thousand yuan. Xu stated at the police station that he received one hundred yuan, and Chen received thirty yuan. The police station has been unable to find any connection between Ma Deda and Zhuang Zhangsheng and the kidnapping case. The house in Jiangwan belonged to them, and they rented it to Chen Xingjiang, so the police station is not prosecuting Ma and Zhuang and requests their release. Mrs. Ye Fu stated that after her husband, Ye Zengshou, was kidnapped on the 4th, she received a letter from the Water Police Department on the 14th, stating that Ye had been released. She then went to Hangzhou to meet him. Ye is currently recuperating in Putuo and dares not return to Shanghai, so he is not present today. Judge Feng stated that Ye must appear in person to clarify the case and instructed Mrs. Ye to have her husband surrender himself next time. Otherwise, a subpoena would be issued, and if he refused to comply, he would be arrested. The chauffeur, Mei Guigen, testified that on the morning in question, he was driving to the intersection of Yulin Road and Sheng Road when three robbers suddenly appeared, brandishing guns. Two were in front, and one was in the back, ordering him to be silent. When the car reached Baoding Road, the robbers forced him and the third concubine out of the car. He then reported the incident to the first concubine, who reported it to the police station. Xu A'gen testified that he did not go with them when Ye Zengshou was kidnapped. Afterwards, someone asked him to go and guard the hostage at Chen's place in Jiangwan. The hostage was in Room 26, and there were four guards. After about ten days, he heard that Ye had been released for a ransom of ten thousand yuan, negotiated by a man named Uncle. Afterwards, he went to the Zhongnan Restaurant in Dapuqiao in the French Concession, where Uncle gave him one hundred yuan. Chen Xingjiang testified that on July 3rd, an Uncle came to his place and wanted to rent a house for a few days, which would be returned soon. He then rented Room 26 next door. The next day, three people entered and stayed for eight or nine days before leaving. Later, Uncle gave him twenty yuan. Judge Feng verified the testimonies and ordered Xu and Chen to be detained for another fourteen days for further interrogation. Ma Deda and Zhuang Zhangsheng were investigated by the police station and found to have no criminal suspicion and were granted release.</p>
<p>Granddaughter of the Late Sheng Sues for Inheritance</p>
<h3 id="e146">Sheng Aichen's Estate <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Sues Mao Zengnian, Sheng Yuyou, et al.</p>
<p>Requests the Return of the Embezzled Inheritance</p>
<p>Sheng Rong, 35 years old and married to a Wang, granddaughter of the late Qing Dynasty Grand Guardian Sheng Xingsun, recently hired three lawyers—Xu Bingcheng, Chen Tingrui, and Li Zuyu—at the First District Court to sue Mao Zengnian, Sheng Yuyou, Sheng Enyi, and others for jointly embezzling her inheritance, along with related civil claims. The court has approved the summons and scheduled the trial for the 15th of this month. The plaintiff's complaint is recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding the defendants' joint embezzlement of the inheritance, the plaintiff requests the court to impose criminal penalties according to the law and to make incidental civil claims. The plaintiff was born to Sheng Kuichen, the eldest son, and adopted as a daughter by her third uncle, Sheng Aichen. In 1919, Sheng Aichen passed away from illness, leaving no children. At that time, only Sheng Aichen's concubine, Madam Gong, the plaintiff's stepmother, and the plaintiff were present at his bedside. The plaintiff personally witnessed the encoffining and performed all the rites expected of a filial child, including wearing mourning clothes, carrying the staff, buying water, and embracing the body into the coffin. The defendant Sheng Yuyou was the son of the defendant Sheng Enyi, who was residing in Beijing at the time. Later, the grandmother, Madam Zhuang, chose Yuyou to be Sheng Aichen's son. At that time, he was still young and did not come to Shanghai for the funeral. Later, Yuyou came to Shanghai with his birth mother but never lived with Madam Gong. The plaintiff then married Wang Jiuli. On the afternoon of May 18th of this year, when Madam Gong passed away, the plaintiff and her husband happened to be in Hangzhou. Upon hearing the news, they rushed back, wore mourning clothes according to custom, and in her grief, did not attend to the inheritance. All the funeral rites for Madam Gong, including the seven-day rituals, the funeral procession, and the temporary placement of the coffin, were overseen by the plaintiff. According to custom, the son-in-law's family must organize the fifth seven-day ritual, which the plaintiff also did. For the sixth seven-day ritual and the funeral procession, the plaintiff and her husband led their children to escort the coffin to the Yongshan Hall in Suzhou. On August 2nd, after the completion of the funeral, they returned to Shanghai and learned that the newspapers had published a notice that Sheng Yuyou had sued the defendant Mao Zengnian (Madam Gong's cousin) for theft, but the case was dismissed. After further investigation, the plaintiff learned that the defendants Sheng Enyi and Yuyou, along with his birth mother, had taken advantage of the chaos of the funeral to secretly withdraw Madam Gong's valuable jewelry from the safe deposit box in the Siming Bank. Furthermore, the clothes, gold, and silverware left behind were also sealed off, intending to embezzle the plaintiff's share of the inheritance. Therefore, Mao Zengnian wanted to take advantage of the situation and hid six passbooks from Madam Gong's accounts at the Siming Bank, the Shanghai Bank's Kadlu Road branch, and the Wuzhen account, totaling one hundred thousand yuan, along with a seal. Yuyou and his birth parents urged him to hand them over, which led Sheng Yuyou to sue Mao Zengnian for theft. However, they did not dare to proceed with a public trial, and Yuyou withdrew the lawsuit. The collusion between them is evident. Both parties originally intended to harm the plaintiff's right to inheritance and embezzle her share. First, they quarreled over the uneven distribution of the spoils, and then they secretly divided the spoils and settled the lawsuit. Such ghostly behavior is a joint act of embezzlement, violating Article 356 of the Criminal Code. In addition to reserving the right to sue Sheng Yuyou's birth mother, the plaintiff urgently requests the court to approve the summons of the defendants for questioning, impose criminal penalties according to the law, and, based on the incidental civil claims, order the defendants to hand over all of Madam Gong's embezzled inheritance, so that the plaintiff may receive her rightful share according to the law, to uphold justice and protect her rights.</p>

<p>Luring from Within the Silk Factory</p>
<p>Hiding the Beauty in the Hotel</p>
<p>Ms. Wu, the aunt of Sun Wu, a woman from Funing, lives at No. 9, a bungalow on Taiyang Temple Road in Zhabei. Sun Wu, 24 years old, was married to the son of Sun Huaizhao. She disappeared in the first month of this year. Despite searching everywhere, there was no news of her until six months had passed. On the 3rd of this month, Ms. Wu's daughter, Zhu Wu, 19 years old and married to Zhu Bixi, also disappeared. Ms. Wu then sent out scouts everywhere. The day before yesterday, a rickshaw puller named Cao suddenly saw Zhu Wu looking out the window at the Huaxing Hotel near the North Railway Station. He remained calm and returned to tell Ms. Wu. Together with her nephew Wu Yuchen, they rushed to the hotel room. They pushed open the door and found not only Zhu Wu inside but also Sun Wu, who had been missing for half a year. It turned out that Zhang Qide had killed two birds with one stone, enjoying both sisters. Sun Wu and Zhang Qide had become acquainted at a silk factory, and he had seduced her to run away together, as if they were husband and wife. Zhang learned that Zhu Wu was young and beautiful, and wanting more, he took Sun Wu to the yarn factory. He then seduced Zhu Wu to leave and live with him at the Huaxing Hotel, where he had sexual relations with both sisters, sharing the pleasure equally. Due to the recent heat, they were cooling off on the balcony, which led to their being seen. Unintentionally, two cases were solved at once. Zhang Qide was also apprehended at the time. The police were called and arrested him at the First Precinct of the Fifth District. Yesterday, he was sent to the District Court for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Rectifying Privately Run Ferries <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Limiting All Ferries to Rebuild New Ferries and Docks</p>
<p>Adding City-Run Ferries Until Compliance</p>
<p>The privately run ferry between Qichangzhan on Pudong and Weisaigong Pier on Puxi has been taken over by the Public Utilities Bureau since the 10th of this month. Previously, on July 29th, the Public Utilities Bureau received a phone call from the River Police of the Jianghai Customs, stating that "The ferries prepared by the Zhenxing Company between Qichangzhan on Pudong and Weisaigong Pier on Puxi are narrow and old. Every day, from 6 to 7 a.m. and 5 to 6 p.m., thousands of workers cross the river, resulting in several drowning deaths. Today, a small ferry used for towing was loaded with several times the number of passengers allowed by the customs license. The port police of the Customs enforced the ban, ordering a portion of the workers to go ashore first in order to load them in batches to avoid repeating the past mistakes, which led to verbal conflicts and fights. The situation with the ferries of the Fuxing Company is similar. However, if we revoke the licenses and order them to stop running, traffic will be disrupted, and workers will not be able to cross the river. If we allow them to continue operating, the ferries will be in violation of regulations every day, with unthinkable consequences. Managing the ferries is the responsibility of the municipal government. Could your ferries take over the service to maintain transportation?" The bureau immediately sent staff to conduct an on-site inspection with the River Police of the Jianghai Customs, recognizing that the ferry crossing was important and in need of urgent remediation. In order to protect travelers and maintain transportation, the bureau decided to operate the ferries while ordering the companies to build new-style ferries and proper docks within a reasonable period of time, and only after the inspection is passed would they be allowed to resume operations. The bureau then reported to the municipal government for approval on August 1st, which was approved on August 4th. Preparations were immediately started, the Qichangzhan pier on Pudong was slightly renovated, and the city ferries No. 6 and No. 7 were transferred to begin service on August 20th. All related agencies are requested to assist. On August 8th, the Fuxing and Zhenxing companies were ordered to build formal docks and new-style ferries according to the city's ferry regulations within eight months of receiving the notice, otherwise, the service would be taken over by the city. Furthermore, since only one company is allowed to operate each ferry crossing, they were ordered to merge into one company through negotiation. It is also reported that the city-run ferry will still charge each passenger four copper coins, and the service will run from 4:45 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. daily.</p>
<p>Representatives of Shipping Companies</p>
<h3 id="e150">Requesting a Wider Definition of Wharf Shoreline <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of shipping companies from Puxi, including Xing Zhigang, yesterday jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Land Bureau, requesting a wider definition of the wharf shoreline and asking the municipal government to register the case in order to build docks and benefit transportation. Various businesses along the Punan area have mainly relied on inland shipping for trade with the countryside. The Wanyu, Gongyi, Dongjiadu, and Jinan Guild Hall wharves have historically been used by ships from the five counties of Puxi, Songjiang, Fengxian, Shanghai, Nanhui, and Chuansha. During the seventh year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, the Shanghai merchants Deyi, Daheng, Wanxiang, Senmao, Hecheng, and Wanyu petitioned the Shanghai County Magistrate Huang regarding the berthing of ships, requesting the erection of stone tablets at the wharves to allow berthing in perpetuity. The tablets still exist today, with clear inscriptions that can be easily verified. The petitioners are now concerned that the wharf shoreline is gradually being occupied by the ferry bureau. They previously petitioned the Port Authority, which replied that the bureau was currently planning a comprehensive public wharf in the Punan area to ensure that merchants would not face any problems with existing wharves. The ships berthed at the area between Jinan Guild Hall and the Wanyu wharf are all over forty meters long, with an average of fifty to sixty ships arriving daily (a list of shipowners is attached). The wharves are narrow, and latecomers must line up far into the river, unable to dock, and passengers and goods cannot be unloaded. Ships from neighboring towns arrive and depart with the tide, and they do not stay overnight. Those who fear missing the tide carry their goods on their backs, risking their lives to walk on the uneven wooden rafts, and are prone to falling, a hardship that those who have not experienced it cannot imagine. This is because the defined shoreline is narrow, causing this danger. The petitioners believe that wharves and roads are equally important. The Jinan Guild Hall and other wharves are well-known wharves in Punan and the commercial center of the area. Thousands of people rely on them every day, and tens of thousands of dollars worth of goods are transported daily. Furthermore, the annual ship tax revenue is considerable. The bureau is in charge of the shoreline along the river and should define the measurement of the wharves to maintain transportation and benefit traffic. Therefore, the petitioners jointly petition your office, hoping that you will review and approve the petition, send staff to remeasure and define the shoreline of the Wanyu, Gongyi, Dongjiadu, and Jinan Guild Hall wharves, and register the case with the municipal government to build docks and prevent others from encroaching on the land. This would not only benefit the people of the five counties in Puxi but also the future of Punan's commerce. The petitioners eagerly await your decision.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Methods for Strictly Suppressing Bandits and Kidnappers <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Advising Citizens to Assist</p>
<p>The Police Department of the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council, in order to curb crime, is offering rewards for information and advising residents to assist in the investigation and arrest of criminals, for the benefit of detection. A proclamation is hereby issued stating that when Chinese residents within the concession encounter extortion, threats, robbery, and other such incidents, they often offer considerable resistance. As a result, such cases have gradually decreased. However, lurking bandits are still a potential threat in the long term, and optimism is not warranted. Such criminals are timid as mice and only use intimidation to prevent victims from resisting, allowing them to act as they please. If victims were to resolutely offer courageous resistance, they would be powerless. Currently, the concession has over five thousand well-trained and armed detectives who are either spread out on the roads or stationed in police stations. Once a warning is received, they can be dispatched immediately. When the public is in danger, they only need to sound a whistle to call the police or go to a nearby police station to report the incident. This is a beneficial and cost-free option, so why not take advantage of it? The detectives are public servants of the people, supported by public funds, and serve society. They only need opportunities to engage in investigation and arrest, and they will naturally be enthusiastic and committed to their duties. Members of high society who are aware of suspicious or criminal individuals in their vicinity can report directly to the police station or submit a written report. The heads of the police stations will keep these reports strictly confidential and make every effort to investigate. For confidential matters, individuals can report directly to the head of the Criminal Division at his office or by mail to Room 331, No. 331 Henan Road, Municipal Council. Robbers and kidnappers are organized into gangs and hold optimistic views. Their first step is to instill fear in the public. Those who carry out the acts are often instructed by others, and those who instigate the crimes are familiar with social conditions. This is almost always the case in kidnapping cases. Therefore, wealthy families must be cautious about hiring servants and partners and making friends. If someone is unfortunately kidnapped and someone comes forward to negotiate the ransom, the family must pay special attention to the person and consult with friends who have had similar experiences. It may be possible to discover that these people are accomplices from previous incidents. Kidnappers are well aware of the fearful psychology of the hostage and do not hesitate to repeatedly exploit their relatives and friends. Although criminal gangs may temporarily evade the law by taking risks and seeking fortune, they will inevitably be caught one day. Therefore, they are more worried about their schemes being exposed than the victims. If the victims can provide information to the police station, these criminals will not be able to escape the law. Those who carry out the kidnapping are merely puppets who are blinded by small gains and forget the greater harm. They are not worthy of attention. After the criminals are caught, the victims should be bold and testify in court to provide evidence so that they can be severely punished according to the law. If anyone conceals the details of the kidnapping, they will only embolden the criminals and even bring harm to their relatives and friends. The leaders of the criminal gangs often pretend to be members of high society, indulging in extravagant spending on wine, women, gambling dens, and brothels, using ill-gotten gains to squander. When their money runs out, they have no choice but to find a suitable person among their friends to sacrifice and seek ways to recoup their losses. Regarding the ransom, if the police station is consulted in good faith in advance and cooperates fully, using money as bait to lure the criminals into capture, it cannot be considered illegal. However, most victimized families do not understand the situation and are unwilling to truthfully report the ransom negotiations to the police station, even fabricating lies in an attempt to escape guilt. This is tantamount to aiding the evildoers, leading to the misfortune of their relatives and friends, and must be considered illegal. Any landlord who directly rents a house to a criminal gang, or indirectly through a sub-landlord, is also in violation of the law, as their intention is to make money and they lack a sense of public good. Landlords and sub-landlords have a responsibility to society to cooperate with the police station to reduce crime and ensure local peace. Otherwise, even the best police station in the world will not be able to fully function without the adequate assistance of the public. The Chinese often encourage their children with the saying, "Everyone should sweep the snow from their own doorstep and not worry about the frost on other people's roofs." Therefore, most Chinese are unwilling to interfere in the affairs of others. However, for the sake of public peace and tranquility, all residents of the concession have a shared responsibility to maintain local law and order. Although the concession has repeatedly cracked down on major thefts and punished the perpetrators according to the law, there have recently been occasional cases of armed robbery. This is due to the public's lack of a spirit of mutual assistance. The methods for assisting the police station can be divided into the following three points: (1) Robbers usually enter through the front and back doors due to the negligence of servants. It is best not to let strangers or suspicious individuals enter after dark. (2) Few victimized families sound the alarm or call for help. It is difficult to report to the police in the presence of robbers or because they are unable to do so. However, once an alarm is sounded, the robbers will flee in terror. This shows that robbers are not brave people, and they dare to act as they do because the residents are cowardly and allow them to rob and plunder. If the victimized family does not make a sound, the detectives will have no way of knowing that a robbery has occurred and will have no opportunity to catch the robbers. Therefore, if residents are unfortunately robbed, they should immediately sound the whistle, ring the gong, call for help, etc., to attract the attention of neighbors and detectives so that they can come to their aid. (3) If a neighbor encounters a robbery, they should sound the alarm, call the police by telephone, or follow the robbers and wait for an opportunity to report to the police and arrest them in the spirit of mutual assistance. Residents of the concession, in order to reduce theft and assist the police station, should not leave windows open, leave clothes on the drying rack, or leave bicycles unattended on the side of the road. Furthermore, do not allow criminals and suspicious individuals to loiter in playgrounds, markets, public trams, automobiles, and parking lots, as they often mingle in these places to steal items from pedestrians' pockets or grab women's jewelry and purses. If such incidents occur on the road, it is advisable to report them to the police as soon as possible. There is also a type of social pest that often appears at train stations, hotels, teahouses, theaters, and gambling dens, specializing in deceiving the ignorant and soliciting gamblers for gambling dens. These people first use enticements, and those who fall into their trap will lose all their assets. These pests are not only found in this city but also in major cities around the world. As long as these people are not imprisoned, new disasters will emerge endlessly, and countless people will be harmed. The public must pay close attention to the above-mentioned issues and provide assistance in a timely manner to gradually eliminate the bandits in the area so that merchants and residents can live and work in peace. This is of utmost importance. The Police Department has sufficient rewards available. In the future, anyone who comes forward with reliable and confidential information, regardless of age or gender, will be given appropriate rewards to encourage them once the information is verified. This proclamation is hereby issued. July 29, 1931, Police Chief Mao Ding.</p>

<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Famous gardens often have scabby walls. Famous flowers are easily broken.</p>
<p>Opening the south window in summer, splashing ink to create freehand flowers and plants, is incomparably pleasant.</p>
<p>The prescriptions of quack doctors are no different from the death warrants of demons.</p>
<p>Struggling under the oppression of life knows neither cold nor heat.</p>
<p>Women, regardless of beauty or ugliness, all consider adornment as their second life.</p>
<p>In civilized lands, those who die unnaturally must be more numerous than in uncivilized villages.</p>
<p>A flower or a blade of grass in front of the courtyard has its own charm. There is no need for thousands of acres of gardens. A book in the room has its own ancient charm. There is no need for ten thousand scrolls on the shelf.</p>
<p>One's heart should not be blinded by wealth. One's will should not be disturbed by wine.</p>
<p>When writing letters for others, even if you exert your full strength, only nine-tenths of your talent will be seen.</p>
<p>Those whose footprints do not reach dance halls and swimming pools are definitely not modern figures.</p>
<p>People in Wu call the leader of thugs "red old man". In fact, the term "red old man" was used in the capital during the Song Dynasty to insult soldiers. It can be seen that proverbs must have origins, but repeated transmission and misinterpretation inevitably leads to loss of original meaning.</p>
<p>The principles of the world are cyclical. Therefore, what is new becomes old after a long time, and what is old becomes new again.</p>
<p>The sunlight is to be feared, so it is covered with curtains. Therefore, curtains are the staunch defenders against the sun.</p>
<p>Striving is the spirit of ambition. Humility is the virtue of scholars.</p>
<p>Reading in winter and summer, touring in spring and autumn: this is the only blessed person in the world.</p>
<p>Emptying the wastepaper basket brings great comfort to the heart.</p>
<p>The ancients banned opium to show concern for worthy people. Today's ban on opium achieves the effect of rejecting poison.</p>
<p>Illness can be cured, so one should seek treatment when sick. Poverty is incurable, so worrying about poverty is not as good as accepting it.</p>
<h3 id="e168">A Record of the Capital's Orphans' School <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Fei</p>
<p>This summer, I attended the Lishi Society's summer school and rented a place at the National Revolutionary Army Orphans' School outside Zhongshan Gate. The school is located on the southern hill of Sifang City, at the foot of Zijin Mountain. The Zhongshan Mausoleum stands majestically to the left of the school. With the wind, rain, morning, and dusk, one can embrace the mountain scenery to the east and admire the sacred monuments to the north, and cannot help but think of the high mountain and great conduct. Therefore, I record its outline to mark my fleeting visit.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Architecture: The school was prepared in November of the 17th year of the Republic of China and opened in March of the following year. In December of the 19th year, the boys' and girls' schools were separated. The girls' school moved to Yangpi Lane in the city. The new buildings for the boys' school have been completed, with a total of 36 large and small buildings. They cost 250,000 yuan. All are old-style bungalows, with the Zhongshan Hall located in the center. The remaining buildings form a constellation-like surrounding. Zhixin Courtyard, Boxian Courtyard, and Keqiang Courtyard are the most prominent.</p>
<p>Student Life: Most of the school's students are admitted successively. To date, there are more than 400 students. Their native places span 17 provinces, from Suiyuan in the north to Guangdong in the south. Among them, those from Hunan province are the most numerous, accounting for about one-third. Jiang, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces are next. The oldest is 20 years old, and the youngest is 5 years old. The older ones wash their own clothes. All expenses are免收免收. Moreover, most of the school provides the study and living supplies. The first issue is quilts, bedding, clothes, and utensils such as boxes and bowls. The subsequent issues include shoes, socks, soap, tooth powder, toothbrushes, and towels, which are issued monthly by the dormitory affairs department. A monthly allowance of three yuan is also given, but most of it is deposited in the bank. Gifts from relatives are limited to fruits, clothes, and stationery. There are no holidays. Students stay in school all year round except for special circumstances. This is because their fathers and brothers were national martyrs, and their families rarely have possessions.</p>
<p>Love, Sincerity, and Integrity: The school takes "Love, Sincerity, and Integrity" as its motto, which is divided into eight major goals: making life laborized, making behavior disciplined, making spirit egalitarian, making physique martial, making thought scientific, making interest artistic, making organization socialized, and making the school familial. After living there for a long time, I realized that the people there were quite capable of striving to practice it.</p>
<p>Rural Center: The principal of the school is Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. The director of education is Mr. Shi Xiangzai, an advocate of rural education who acts on what he says. He intends to use the school as a rural center to promote outward. Therefore, the school's junior high school only offers agricultural courses. There is a farm of 500 acres. Students cultivate most of the vegetables themselves. The fields are lush and green. They harvest in the morning and evening for their meals. This is just an extra activity.</p>
<p>Famous People's Couplets: There are many couplets by famous people in the party and country hanging in Zhongshan Hall. Mr. Hu Hanmin's couplet says: "Comforting the descendants of benevolent martyrs, no virtue can repay their sacrifice; advancing children and teenagers in learning, aspirations will surely be fulfilled." Mr. Dai Chuanxian's couplet says: "Do not forget that your virtuous fathers and brothers took righteousness and achieved benevolence. You must study hard today. You must learn to be a great man and establish yourself in the world. You must strive to defend your country in the future." Mr. He Yingqin's couplet says: "Having thousands of mansions, happily sitting together in the spring breeze, happily nurturing talents for the country's use; may our comrades not waste their time, but cultivate virtue and follow the example of their predecessors." The kind and benevolent words are indeed inspiring and make people feel endlessly admired.</p>
<p>Fresh Scenery: The school is located within the mausoleum area, so the main roads are fully opened, new houses are planted everywhere, and pines and cypresses sing, wisteria and vines shade the scenery, flowers fill the fields, and fragrant grass fills the valleys. This makes people feel as if they are in a vast swamp and forest. When the sun rises above the eastern mountain and the moon shines between the evening cities, facing the mausoleum to the north and welcoming the warm breeze from the south, taking two or three young students from the school, and talking about the events of their fathers and brothers riding horses to kill thieves, one cannot help but feel a sense of sorrow and excitement in one's heart.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Strange Pagoda on Tianma Mountain <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>There is also a strange pagoda on Tianma Mountain in Songjiang. It is nine stories high. To this day, only the core of the pagoda remains. It is impossible to climb the mountain. One can tell at a glance that it is an ancient pagoda of a thousand years. What is even stranger is that the lowest two stories of the pagoda have extremely large cracks. The entire pagoda is tilted at a 15-degree angle. However, for the past ten years, it has not fallen. Next to it is a ginkgo tree, with a trunk that can be embraced several times. It is an old tree. The branches of this tree all curve towards the pagoda. Even the tender branches and leaves all face north towards the pagoda. As a result, ordinary ignorant villagers all say that this tree is magical, and that the pagoda has not fallen because of the support of the tree. This pagoda and this tree are indeed strange objects. Therefore, I record them.</p>
<h3 id="e170">A Record of Recent News from Gan River <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met Mr. Tan Yanhui, a disaster relief commissioner of the Party and Political Affairs Committee of the Commander-in-Chief of the Land, Sea, and Air Forces' Headquarters, at the Red Cross. Mr. Tan had just come from Gan. The situation he described is worth recording. I think it is also what those who care about the current situation would like to hear.</p>
<p>Separate Governance: There are a total of eighty-one counties in Gan Province. Forty-three counties have been ravaged by the Communist bandits. After Commander-in-Chief Chiang personally went to suppress the Communists, he organized the Party and Political Affairs Committee of the Commander-in-Chief of the Land, Sea, and Air Forces' Headquarters. Those with established reputations serve as committee members. Counties occupied by bandits are not subject to the control of the Jiangxi Provincial Government after their recovery, but are governed by the committee. Therefore, at present, only thirty-eight counties in the entire Jiangxi Province are under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government. Forty-four counties are under the command of the committee (because one of the original forty-three counties was vast and has been divided into two counties). Separate governance has achieved remarkable results.</p>
<p>Flying Every Three Days: Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to Gan this time with the determination to "have me without bandits, or have bandits without me." Every time he instructed officials, he used these two sentences to encourage them to advance and fight. Because a certain regimental commander was timid and did not advance, he was severely punished to warn the various divisions. As a result, the military's morale was firm and they moved forward bravely. Therefore, they were invincible wherever they went. Although Commander-in-Chief Chiang was stationed in Nanchang, he was fully aware of the situation on the front lines. Every three days, he would take a red airplane to the front to personally inspect the battle lines and give instructions in person. The various military officers were therefore very inspired. Everyone said that the airplane's comings and goings were quite eye-catching. It was the height of summer. The Chairman should take a break. Commander-in-Chief Chiang said that as a general, he should share the joys and sorrows with the soldiers and do his best for the country. It was the duty of a soldier, so he continued to fly every three days as usual.</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Needles Piercing the Heart: The tragic death of Zhang Huizan, the former commander of the 18th Division, has been seen in various newspapers. Recently, a small bandit who had personally witnessed Commander Zhang's death was captured among the Communist bandits. What he said contained details that were not known to outsiders. According to him, after Commander Zhang was captured, the bandits tried to persuade him to surrender, but he refused. They then pierced his nostrils with iron rings, dragged him through the streets, and ordered his trusted officers to whip him with leather whips. They lured him with great profits. Zhang still refused. When asked what his purpose was, he said that he only wanted to meet the Commander-in-Chief. Even if he died, he would have no regrets. The bandits laughed and said that it could be done. They then ordered the small bandit to buy more than a dozen packages of sewing needles and a bowl of cold water, and forced Zhang to swallow them. Zhang said that since he could not meet the Commander-in-Chief in life, he hoped that his remains would be sent to him after his death. Then he would die in peace. The bandits agreed to his request. They then forced him to swallow the needles. After a while, his face turned white, and he rolled around on the ground, pointing at his heart. The scene was too horrible to look at. The so-called ten thousand arrows piercing the heart in old novels was nothing more than this. The bandits watched him die, then cut off his head, placed it on a board, and put it in the river to float downstream. They laughed and pointed at Zhang's head, saying that he could now go and see his Commander-in-Chief. Their cruelty was like this.</p>

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>After arriving in India on the 8th, I had contact and observations with people from all walks of life in India, and my thinking changed. First, from the requirements of Indian culture and people, I learned that in the future, the national cultures of all Asian nations will be combined into a large federation. Then, connecting with the Americas to form the Pacific East Asian Federation. This is only a matter of time to decide to evolve this situation. The British scholar Wei Ershi had already said it, and he also said that world unification must be in the hands of nations that speak Chinese and English. He can be called a wise man. I had this idea many years ago. Now, I must decide to implement it because of the requirements of the Indian people. Second, observing Gandhi's movement and the life of the Indian people, I learned that transforming society, especially in Chinese society, India's spiritual life and the spiritual power of the spiritual movement are very suitable and easy for Chinese people to adopt. Because cultural elements have similar points. India is a large tree, and Buddhism is one of its branches. East Asia has been bathed in Buddhist culture for decades. Spiritual life is very important. It is not comparable to the Russian people. Third, contacting Muslims, I learned that the great power in southwestern Asia lies in Islam. From Shaanxi and Gansu in the east to Europe in the west, one must not underestimate religion. Without knowing its habits and psychology, there is no way to connect. In general, religious issues are no longer a cliché in Europe and the United States. It has become a setting sun. Even in Asia, the relationship between Islam and India is 60% to 70% religious. Conflicts arise because of different hobbies. Marx's theory is definitely not enough to solve it. For example, Indians call cows and conflict with Muslims. There is no economic relationship. It is purely a difference in habits and ideas. Please put Lenin in India. You cannot force Indians to eat beef. It is unchangeable until death. Indians will never become emperors if they eat beef. This shows that habits and beliefs can change life. Life does not depend entirely on matter. Both Islam and Christianity have things that can be adopted. The Japanese Mushanokoji New Village has Buddhists and Christians, which can be proven.</p>
<p>The novice monk told me that Russia's victory was due to its geography. China's geography is not as good as Russia's. It is easily invaded by imperialism. Then, if China does not adopt the Russian system and wants to unite all of Asia, it must compare and study India in the central part, Islamization in the southwest, and Buddhism in East Asia, Japan, Siam, Burma, etc., and synthesize a large federation. It stands between the three major federations of the European Federation, the American Federation, and Russia. I have gained something from Indianization. I want to go to Turchai to study the cultural customs of Islamic and other religions. I will definitely gain a lot. I haven't been able to go yet. But if you live in an Indian place and study Islamization, Indians don't like it. Even if you read their books, Indians will not express sympathy. The difference in national psychology is so great.</p>

<p>— Yao Suifeng</p>
<p>Nothing happened overnight. The next morning, the clerk followed the landlady's instructions, got up early, and rushed to the Railway Hotel, guarding the door, just waiting for Xiao Rong to come out so he could call him back.</p>
<p>At half past nine, he indeed saw Xiao Rong walking out of it with that beautiful woman, looking proud. The clerk hid aside, and when he walked out the door, he unexpectedly walked in front of him and said loudly, "The landlady invites you to come!"</p>
<p>When Xiao Rong saw it was the clerk, he was very unhappy, but he was embarrassed to explode because of Miss Ding. He acted lightly and said, "I know! I'll come back myself in a while. You go first!" As he spoke, he walked forward without even turning his head.</p>
<p>The clerk originally didn't want to let him go, but then he thought that since Xiao Rong said he would come back himself in a while, he would let it go. He went back to report, watching Xiao Rong walking away with that woman, laughing.</p>
<p>Miss Ding asked, "Who was that who called you just now?"</p>
<p>Xiao Rong made a contemptuous expression and said, "Who else could it be? There are too many poor relatives and friends of ours in Suzhou. When they hear that I'm coming from Shanghai, they just want to borrow money from me!" After saying that, he gave a cold laugh. Miss Ding also believed him.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong thought that it would be better to go back in a while to avoid them coming to pester him again. He also thought that he had to move to a different hotel to avoid them finding him again. So he said to Miss Ding, "After we go to Tiger Hill to play, we have to move to a different hotel when we come back, otherwise my poor relatives and friends will inevitably come to borrow money from me again!"</p>
<p>Miss Ding also thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>Really, after playing at Tiger Hill, they moved out of the Railway Hotel and stayed at the Dongwu Hotel. He also told the tea boy at the Railway Hotel that he had returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>After moving hotels, he planned to go home. He only told Miss Ding that he was "going to visit a relative's house who had invited him just now, and he would be back in about half an hour."</p>
<p>So, he actually returned to his home with an angry expression. When he walked inside, he saw his father and mother sitting there silently. When they saw Xiao Rong coming back, his father immediately stood up.</p>
<p>"Xiao Rong! You're having a good time! Don't you even think about what kind of person you are?" He slapped the table and said angrily.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong didn't say anything, and actually gave a cold laugh.</p>
<p>"You tell me! Who is that woman? I told you to go to Shanghai to study hard, not to pick up girls! You tell me, who is that woman?" He said, his voice getting louder and louder.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Gold Bar Low Then High <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Market conditions seem unstable. Yesterday, the 11th, the gold price fell and then rose again, with turbulent waves, advancing and retreating from time to time. There were a total of fifteen taels of fluctuations throughout the day. Industry intentions were vague, and measures were beyond reach. The situation was precarious, resulting in a further rise of four taels. Major players had different demands for supply, but the buying sentiment in the after-market was excited, with bulls increasing their positions and bears rushing to cover. Despite a slight dip in the silver market, it was not taken seriously. Moreover, the European market initially weakened but then strengthened, almost causing gold prices to open lower. While foreign exchange was stable, the afternoon session turned to within 771 taels to outside of 775 taels. The after-market turned from stable to high, likely because exchange rates became increasingly strong. The market suddenly surged, soaring by more than ten taels, exceeding the 80-tael mark again, showing unmatched momentum, but it remains unpredictable.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Reverses to Low. The market opened at 9:00 AM, dropping five taels and one mace to 772.5 taels. Large silver bars contracted by a quarter. Public and private telegrams indicated silver prices were down 3/8 of a cent, but Citibank's buying interest remained strong until after the closing bell. Sellers were very active on the floor, with Wanxing, Shunli, and others initially selling off, causing prices to drop to 771.8 taels. Subsequently, Yuánmàoyǒng, Tóngtàichāng, Yuánchūn, and others bought in. Additionally, initial British gold was at 625, later calculated as 5625, thus rising to 775.4 taels. Afterwards, Yuánxìng, Yǒnghéng, and others came to sell, causing a retreat of three taels. It was also learned that British gold listings would not change, while American gold increased by 125, briefly reaching 772.5 taels, then quickly rising to 774 taels. However, Chāngshēng, Yǒngcuì, Chāngyǒng, and others sold off. It was rumored that speculator Mr. Wu also unloaded, temporarily suppressing the price to 770.07 taels. Despite stable British gold prices, the market reversed and rose again. Fúchāng, Hónglì, Chūnyuán Yǒng, Dàlián groups, Tàichāng, and others agreed to buy, causing a surge of five taels, with some fluctuations of one or two taels up and down. At 10:20 AM, it was at 775.5 taels. Bǐngxìng, Yǒngfēng, Qiánchāngxiáng, and others were active in selling, causing a drop of more than four taels. At 10:30 AM, it was at 771.3 taels, as August and September British gold could settle at 5625. Later, Yǒnghēng, Zhìfēng Yǒng, and others bought in, adding three taels. However, there were no major changes. From 10:00 to 10:30 AM, it was at 4 taels and 4 mace. Afterwards, it was learned that Indian exchange rates were low in the near term but rising in the long term, immediately dropping more than two taels to 772 taels. Subsequently, Yǒnghēng and others bought again, raising it by three taels. At noon, it was at 775 taels. At closing, it returned to 773.5 taels, as the Dàlián group continued to sell, with advertised prices still calculated at 819 taels, a discount of 45-46 taels to over 48 taels. The noon closing was at 45-46 taels.</p>
<p>After-Market Gradually Shows Upward Trend. The after-market opened at 773.4 taels, with fluctuations of one tael and zero mace, but little trading. When Indian exchange rates increased slightly by one anna, the gold price retreated from 773.6 taels to 772 taels. After 2:15 PM, buyers seemed more diligent, raising it by two taels. By 3:30 PM, it was around four taels, with British gold fluctuating around 625. Suddenly, the exchange market tightened, with banks trading among themselves at 5625. Industry players began to scramble, with Yuánxìng, Yǒngfúyú, Chéngfēngyǒng, Zhìfēngyǒng, Yǒnghéngyú dà, and speculator Mr. Luo, among others, aggressively buying. In just half an hour, it soared six or seven taels, exceeding 80 taels by almost 4:00 PM. With British gold settling at only 4375, another five taels were added. By 4:10 PM, it reached 85.5 taels, almost as if it were leaping a thousand feet. However, sellers, such as Qiánchāngxiáng and the Dàlián group, continued to sell, suppressing it again by four and a half taels to 81 taels, then pulling it up again by more than two taels to three and a half taels. At the 4:20 PM closing, it was at 81.6 taels, a continuation of the four-tael increase from the previous day. The maximum price for the day was 85.5 taels, the minimum price was 770.07 taels, a difference of 14.8 taels.</p>
<p>Spot Now Maintaining Its Position. The spot price was 2.3 taels in the morning, 4 taels at noon closing, 4 taels in the afternoon, and 81.5 taels at the closing bell. Advertised prices were discounted by 46-47 taels to 33-34 taels, with the final price at 37 taels. Before bookkeeping, the pre-market was 772 taels to 774 taels, and the after-market was 80 taels to 82 taels. The water top-up was 772 taels in the morning and 80 taels in the afternoon. The spot price of the silver bars only increased by 9.5 mace. Yíngfēnghéng sold several hundred taels of futures to the Dàlián and Tiānjīn groups and bought back three to four hundred taels, sold by various firms from other locations, while the market is holding its position.</p>
<p>Inconsistent Entries and Exits. Furthermore, industry trading on the floor seemed complex. Statistics show that Yuánmàoyǒng, Yǒnghēng, Hónglì, Tóngtàichāng, Yìfēngyǒng, Xìnhēng, and others all bought in, while Wànxīng and Bǐngxìng sold more than two thousand bars. Héngyú, Fúyú, Yǒngfēng, and Chāngshēngyǒng all sold out. Shùnlì, Dàdéchéng, Zhìfēngyǒng, Yuántài, Yuánchūn, Sēnchāngyǒng, Chūnyuányǒng, and Fútàihēng had quite active trading in and out. Mr. Wu slightly sold off. In the afternoon, Yuánmàoyǒng, Dàdéchéng, Yuántài, Yuándàyǒng, Fútàihēng, and others bought and sold intermittently. Chéngfēngyǒng, Yǒnghēng, Fúyú, Zhìfēngyǒng, and Yuánxìngyǒng yuánchéng had strong buying interest. Cuìchāngyǒng, Qiánchāngxiáng, Shùnlì, and Wànxīng all had sales. Those locking in shillings were selling. The Dàlián group bought a total of one thousand several hundred bars and sold a total of more than three thousand bars. The Guǎng group still had no transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Cotton Yarn, The Yarn Market Trend Is Still Unstable. <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was stable in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The trend is still unstable. Because the world cotton industry is deteriorating, many people are selling, but most buyers are unwilling to take a heavy loss because the decline is too severe. Therefore, the pre-market is still stable, but there is a lack of buying. There are gradually transactions of crude yarn from the Yunnan group in the current yarn market, but there is a lack of large amounts. In the afternoon, because the price of American cotton was quite cheap and raw cotton was trending down, the bulls closed their positions, and the decline intensified. The future situation is still difficult to determine. The September price has already broken through the 50-tael mark.</p>
<p>The Man-Mark was Stable in the Morning and Fell in the Afternoon. The opening of the Man-Mark pre-market was stable, and the profit-taking parties shorted. The prices for various months rose by 3, 4, and 6 mace. In the afternoon, due to the weakness of raw cotton, the bulls sold off, and the market price fell sharply. The prices for various months fell by 2 taels to 2 taels and 6 mace. At closing, there were more shorts, and the market rebounded slightly. The total transaction volume was 75,850 bales. It was found that Tianlong sold 3,050 bales, Mingde sold 1,250 bales, Rongxing sold 1,500 bales, Shenchang sold 1,000 bales, Yicheng sold 2,100 bales, Xiesheng sold 1,250 bales, Deji sold 1,750 bales, Shenji sold 1,500 bales, and Changfeng sold 2,450 bales.

<h3 id="e181">The Reason for the Continued Weakness of the Cotton Market. <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Indian Cotton also Shows a Sharp Decline.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants are Selling American Cotton at Reduced Prices.</p>
<p>The cotton market initially stabilized and then fell, because Indian cotton also showed a sharp decline, and foreign merchants were selling American cotton at special reduced prices in the market. However, the factories have no absorption because they view the world trend as weak and the situation is very pessimistic. Therefore, the cotton market is extremely weak, and the future is still difficult to stabilize. The Japanese merchants are still closing their long positions, and the Flower Mark is bound to see a price of 32 taels.</p>
<p>The Han Mark is Still Weak. The opening of the Han Mark pre-market was due to the disastrous fall in Indian cotton, and the sentiment was not good, but retail investors were short covering. The prices rose by 5 fen to 1.5 qian. In the afternoon, because the price of foreign cotton was extremely cheap, and a large number of open positions were being made, people's hearts suddenly became empty, and the prices fell by 4, 5, and 6 qian. The total transaction volume was 168,600 dan. It was found that Changfeng sold 7,800 dan, Ruiyuan sold 4,400 dan, Yuanchang sold 3,200 dan, Deji sold 3,500 dan, and Tianlong sold 4,500 dan. Yichang bought 4,600 dan, Xinheng bought 7,000 dan, Mingde bought 3,000 dan, Dafeng bought 3,500 dan, and Gengfeng bought 5,000 dan. The Han Mark closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>American Cotton's Downward Trend is Ferocious and Extraordinary. Yesterday, American cotton initially fell due to government reports favoring short positions and bad news from Liverpool. It later rebounded slightly due to some short covering. It is estimated that futures fell 109 to 114 points, and spot fell 115 points. British cotton futures fell 71 to 73 points, and spot fell 78 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell 85 points. Indian cotton was weak due to American cotton reports favoring short positions and sales by European exporters. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell 13.25 rupees, Ola fell 19.75 rupees, and Bairuoxi fell 21 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (10th telegram).</p>

<p>South Market. The sources from various groups amount to about ten or more, but the stock in the river is also scarce. Due to the thin stock in urban and rural stores, coupled with the sharp increase in the price of Xinzha, the desire to buy is increasingly urgent, but it is still not enough for distribution. Therefore, the market atmosphere is tense. As for the market prices of various goods, under the supervision of all sectors, fearing that complications will arise, the association still assesses and opens the prices. Not much Dongxin indica rice has arrived, and the price has increased by half a yuan. Foreign rice arrived today on the 2nd. The go-downs for out-of-town groups and this street are still lively, and the price has increased again.</p>
<p>Xinzha. The sources from various groups amount to ten or more. The rice merchants' association openly assesses and evaluates the prices. Top-quality thick indica rice is scarce, and the go-downs are mostly in the central region. The market prices for top-quality goods are uniformly at 17 yuan. The shape-changed yuan and thin indica rice are still in high demand from tea shops, and the situation has surged by about one yuan. The new indica rice is on par with the South Market.</p>

<p>Flour Transactions Return to Full-Day Trading Starting Yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month once again presented a soaring phenomenon. Because the quoted prices of foreign wheat rebounded by 4, 5, 6, and 7 jiao, the people outside the industry were exceptionally excited. The highest price for this month was 2 taels and 1 qian and 9 fen. The deferred months also rose by 2-3 fen. However, after the second session, the market suddenly fell because it was rumored that a large factory had another large order of foreign wheat, rumored to be six or seven ships, with the combined price for bulk cargo being only 4 taels, 2 qian, and 4 fen. Therefore, the factory wharves were dumping, and actual sales were also returning for profit, falling by 2-3 fen from the highest price for the deferred months. Until the afternoon opening, due to the reversal in the morning, people's hearts were not very good at first. Soon, the market rebounded step by step due to short covering and the consistent absorption from the inland areas. Throughout the day, because there were several ups and downs in the market, both buyers and sellers were exceptionally lively. The total transaction volume reached 3.115 million packages, setting a new high record since the establishment of the exchange. As a result, this month rose by 1 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day. September and October rose by 2.5 li, November did not move, and December and January each increased by 5 li. The Flour Exchange has resumed full-day trading starting yesterday, with auctions opening at 10:00 AM and 2:30 PM.</p>

<p>Spot Trades Open at 2,100 Packages.</p>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, the market situation for each month still showed a tense phenomenon. The highest price for this month reached 4 taels, 2 qian, and 3 fen. The deferred months also increased by 3-4 fen. However, afterwards, because of rumors of continued orders for foreign wheat, people's hearts had turned stable. Until the afternoon opening, due to the confirmation of the continued orders for foreign wheat by the factories, and the traders also finalized two ships of bulk cargo, with one ship at 4 taels, 2 qian, and 7 fen and one ship at 4 taels, 3 qian, and 2 fen, the selling became more active. The long positions of a certain major player also smoothly exited while the market was still strong. As a result, they all fell back. It is estimated that this month fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day, September and October fell by 3 fen, November fell by 1 fen, and December fell by 3 fen. The spot wheat market is stable and slightly brisk, with 2,100 packages of wheat from Kaizhitang, Shuangfeng, Hengtang, Danyang, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, and Zhenjiang, etc., being handled by Huafeng Fuxin.</p>

<p>Small Octopus Sales Sparse, Market Weak</p>
<p>Ningbo Dried Baby Octopus: Old goods have already been sold through. According to reports from Ningbo, this year's new goods harvest is significantly less, not even half of last year's. Therefore, incoming goods are very scarce. A few days ago, mountain traders transported over a thousand catties, selling at 52 to 55 taels. Demand is very brisk, with Zhenjiang and Changzhou merchants buying up all the stock.</p>
<p>Small Octopus: The new goods from various mountains are plentiful. Therefore, the supply is abundant. However, the business of the merchants has not yet taken off, so the inventory in the market is increasing day by day, and the market situation is declining. Currently, peddlers are offering large pieces at 33 taels, high-quality at 27 taels, and ordinary at 26 taels. The market is weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firms' silk market remained sluggish. There has been no improvement in the European and American silk telegrams. Although domestic silk merchants have shown some interest in Shanghai white filature silk, the quantity is limited. Only Wei Cheng and others imported ten bales of Shanghai white filature silk, and Samsung and others imported twelve bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices remained stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign firms' tea market, green teas such as Chun Mee, Needle-like, Hyson, and Gunpowder from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, and other areas were in high demand. Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Tientsin Trading, and other major foreign firms were eagerly searching and buying as much as possible because they received urgent telegrams from overseas and learned that this year's tea crop had been reduced. High-quality Chun Mee from Wuyuan's northern villages has already been offered at 170 to 180 taels. Goods from Tunxi, Shexian, and other areas have also been offered at 110 to 120 taels, an increase of more than ten taels compared to before. For Gong Xi tea, Russian firms and assistance associations are offering 55 to 56 taels. Bai Tou Zhuang and China Tea Company are also continuing to purchase, and the market has risen by four or five taels. The green tea market is showing a trend of stability.</p>

<p>Since the boycott of Japanese goods, the piece goods market has been very quiet. Domestic products are in short supply, so any available goods are quickly purchased, making it difficult to find sufficient quantities. Trading in the market remains stagnant. In the Hankou area above Wuhu, anti-Japanese associations have been established, completely halting the sale of Japanese goods. Hankou, having suffered from floods, has seen sluggish demand. Since last week, Sichuan merchants have transported a significant amount of Japanese piece goods, leading to an oversupply. Starting yesterday, there have been fewer buyers. The Tianjin and Shandong merchants have been somewhat active since the stock market crisis ended, transporting over a thousand pieces of satin, moon velvet, and serge. As Yunnan and Guangdong have not yet joined the boycott, there has been some re-export trade. Fine twill domestic goods, which are mainly sold to Guangdong merchants, have been affected by this, causing prices to rise and then fall. Fine cloth is very scarce, while coarse cloth is no longer as firm and expensive as before. Nine-pound cloth is around 5.1 taels, while thirteen-pound Double Horse, Horse Dog, and Double Eagle cloths are around 6.65 taels. Western goods have benefited from previous boycotts of Japanese goods, but this time they have not shown any improvement, mainly due to the extreme shortage of ordinary goods.</p>

<p>Fuan Company in Xiaodongmen declares: Our company is the only large department store in the southern city. Our business has always been prosperous. Recently, the original location of our silk and foreign goods department was insufficient, so it has been moved to the second floor and greatly expanded. The various foreign sundries departments have been relocated to the storefront, and new-style glass display counters have been installed. The display of goods is extremely eye-catching. It is said that the arrangement is already in place, and a summer sale will be held soon.</p>
<p>Daxin Silk and Satin Store at the corner of Shilu Sanmalu declares: Our store has always had a fashion department, gathering famous designers to study fashion styles. We pay close attention to women's summer shirts, believing that the current popular styles lack aesthetic concepts. Therefore, we have created a new style that does not require shoulder straps. The price is quite low, selling for only two yuan and eight jiao. Furthermore, our store will hold a one-week anniversary sale in September. At that time, we plan to publish a special issue for circulation. We have now started soliciting essays and designs. Those with excellent works will receive generous gifts to assist with their artistic interests. Detailed rules have been set for this essay solicitation. If you want to request a copy, you can attach a one-cent postage stamp and send it directly to our store.</p>
<p>Guanshengyuan Main Store on Nanjing Road declares: Our company has recently decided to give away 50,000 glass cups within three days, from the 7th to the 9th of this month, to reward customers who purchase fruit dew, in order to enhance their interest in purchasing. The method is that for every large bottle of fruit dew or two bottles of the second size purchased, one cup will be given as a gift for mixing the dew. In the past two days, our main store, the old store in Jiumu, the Henan Road branch, the Fada Malu branch, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market branch, and Guannan in Penglai Market have all been giving away the gifts. It is said that two-thirds of the gifts have already been given away.</p>
<p>Fushou Pharmacy at the intersection of Simalu and Wangping Street declares: The Tu Xue Wan Quan Jiao (All-Around Hemoptysis Cure) sold by our pharmacy has great efficacy and has long been praised by users.

It is scheduled to be publicly screened at the Beijing Grand Theater in this city starting August 23rd. At that time, there will surely be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>— Ge Xiangrong</p>
<p>The weather has been sultry these past few days. Yesterday evening, after I finished bathing, I put on short clothes and pants, slipped on my slippers, and waving a palm-leaf fan, strode out of the house. I took a small bamboo chair and sat down at the back door, enjoying the refreshing breeze.</p>
<p>I had only been sitting for a moment when the sounds of people suddenly became noisy on the steps across the road. I followed the sound with my eyes and saw a rickshaw puller gesticulating and talking to a group of onlookers of various kinds. Standing next to him was a Western woman. As the puller spoke, he shouted at the Western woman in an English-speaking tone, "Money, money!"</p>
<p>At that time, driven by curiosity, and because the matter seemed to have some international flavor, I hurriedly went into the crowd to find out what was happening. It turned out that the Western woman had hired his rickshaw from Route Lafayette in the French Concession and had been pulled all the way to the corner of Jing'an Temple Road and Route Muir Ming, where I lived. She had only given him sixteen copper coins for such a long journey, which seemed too little, so the rickshaw puller was making a fuss, trying to get a few more.</p>
<p>Most of the onlookers thought that such trivial matters were commonplace.</p>
<p>Some called him "mama huhu."</p>
<p>Some said, "It's your own fault. You like to pull foreigners. Usually, when we call their rickshaws, they don't even bother with us. But as soon as a foreigner waves his hand, they get excited, shake their arms, and desperately pull their empty rickshaws to the foreigner, smiling and serving them. This is called a good lesson."</p>
<p>Some expressed slight sympathy, saying, "Sixteen copper coins for pulling such a long way is too cheap."</p>
<p>Everyone was talking at once, expressing different opinions, but no one could come up with a concrete solution.</p>
<p>At this time, the Western woman stood there for a long time, and suddenly rushed out of the crowd. I quickly looked in the direction she was rushing and saw a burly foreign soldier, carrying a small stick, wearing a flattened hat with two short streamers trailing from the back, and a red ball on top of the hat, much like the red button on our melon-skin hats. His military uniform was ordinary, but what he wore below was not right. He had multi-colored pleated pants, with small mirrors and horses attached to them. People who didn't know that this was a special Scottish decoration would definitely find it strange. At that time, the Western woman went up to him and chattered a few words, which I heard were probably words of counter-propaganda. The soldier, without asking anything else, gave the rickshaw puller two small blows, while saying in extremely bad Chinese, "See what thing, go, go." He scattered the crowd of onlookers and led the Western woman away, which I felt was probably their only duty, the so-called "protecting overseas Chinese."</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller, after being startled, saw that the foreign soldier had gone far away, and muttered, "Lili mama, unreasonable, foreign devil." Fortunately, he shook his head and stuck out his tongue, muttering to himself, "Hey, am I afraid of him?" I thought that the previous sentence was the sound of a weak nation, and the following sentence was the self-comforting words of the weak.</p>
<p>At that time, the general onlookers dispersed in a rush. Several joking friends laughed and shouted, "The country is going to perish, the country is going to perish."</p>
<p>My esteemed neighbor, that Wang tailor who usually loves to boast, was originally there too. Hearing the words of the two joking friends, he immediately struck his complacent and contemptuous pose, muttering,</p>
<p>"Perish, perish, will China perish? Do you know how many immortal masters and swordsmen on Mount Emei in Sichuan have not yet come down the mountain? Hey!"</p>
<p>He was about to continue speaking, but was dragged away by a child.</p>
<p>I was in a bad mood, standing there thinking, when I suddenly heard a friend in a very elegant Western suit complaining to his companion,</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, how can you look into these things so closely? I just dragged you and you refused to leave. Alright, don't delay any longer, golf, golf!"</p>
<p>His companion smiled and followed him away. I followed them with my eyes and saw them strolling quickly and stepping into the small golf course across the street, which was full of red and green lights, with white-clad waiters and smiling foreign ticket girls with bare arms.</p>
<p>I exclaimed in shame, and said to myself, "This is the popular new game of the modern youth of 1931. No wonder he was so eager to get there!"</p>
<p>At that time, I walked away dejectedly. Before I reached the back, I saw a group of children under the eaves of the neighborhood house, surrounded by that Wang tailor, all smiling with their small mouths, listening to Wang tailor telling the story of "Journey to the West". They were really sitting straight and attentive, tasting the story better than they listened to the teacher in the small school, as if they were sitting on nails, much better than the uneasy look they had in class. There were even a few who, when their family called them to eat dinner, replied that they would wait a moment. When I saw this, I felt ashamed again, "Not bad, children's education!"</p>
