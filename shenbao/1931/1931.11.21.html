<p>白里安與中日代表會商</p>
<p>（巴黎）日本今日聲稱、日人生命財產縱似獲有保障、日本亦將維持滿洲之軍事佔據、此言旣出、國聯乃忽遇其有史以來之最重大危局矣、國聯冀覓解决滿洲時局之嘗試中、現似不復有拖延或從容考慮之餘地、衆料明日必將决定國聯會章第十六條、連其全部懲戒辦法在内、應否援用之緊要問題、日本此項宣言、今日午後由芳澤牒送白里安、時局全部爲之驟變、和平解决竟已絕望、日本對其最近一牒中、切實聲明非俟對華直接議定新條約、追認現有各條約、並承認日本所提五項基本要點後、日本不撤退在滿洲軍隊、縱在滿日人生命財產似已得安全保障、日本猶將維持其軍事佔據、因覺南京政府乃國民黨、即實質上反日機關之傀儡、毫無權力以保障佔據地之秩序也、日政府不能接受施博士關於尊重條約之宣言、因日政府不認此宣言載有日本所需要之保障也、日牒又謂日政府不能承認　　黑省戰事仍在進行中⊙白里安建議派遣中立委員團⊙津市昨又有便衣隊擾亂治安⊙四全代會討論對日問題⊙（見國内要電）意外長格蘭第離美返國⊙（見國外要電）銀行業公會電白里安請主持和平⊙汪伍鄒電京發表外交主張⊙（見本埠新聞）</p>

<p>行政會若干重要會員所擬中日談判與日本撤兵同時並行的程序之提議云、日本此種哀的美敦　提出後、衆認國聯已遇絕對無可轉圓之餘地、國聨會章第十一條下所有之解决途徑、業已用盡、今唯一可能者、在考慮可否根據會章第十五條有何進行耳、會章第十五條固予行政會以較大的發動範圍也、不幸第十五條在實際上牽涉第十六條所規定懲戒辦法之執行、行政會準備負此責任否乎、不無疑問、如不負之、則行政會之干涉、簡直流產矣、今日午後事態劇變之後、明日行政會非公開會議遂展至午後四時、更無明日舉行公開會議之問題、白里安於分别接見芳澤與施肇基後、本定於六時半與道威斯晤談、但待至七時半、道威斯猶未有暇、因道氏方發電話與美政府接洽也、雖道威斯在電話中之談話、外人莫能知其性質、然以意揣之、無非報告新發展、並請求訓令耳、外間有德代表蒲洛與英代表西門在巴黎提出國聯會章第十五條之謠言、柏林聞之、今日發出官塲否認文、謂德國對於滿洲問題、不欲改變其絕對保留與中立之政策云、大約明日之行政會、將爲最後一次之非公開會議、英代表甚主張公開、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）白里安接見芳澤與施肇基、而道威斯亦見松平與施肇基、故白道二人今晨將會商以覓一共同政策、道威斯與國務卿史汀生在電話上作長時間之商榷後、今晨將有全權代表美國發言、觀於史汀生之言論、似美國亦猶國聯、未必準備改易其和解與勸告之方針、昨日日牒維持滿洲軍事佔據之聲明、已澄清空氣、國聯會遇有一種直截了當之事局、解决或較易成功、不過此種解决、非南京所樂聞也、今日午後之行政會會議、甚屬緊要、惟英代表西門刻未在巴黎、决議或須延緩、中代表所將援用之會章第十五條、規定國聯可派員實地調查任何事態、故國聯調查團殆爲可成立恊定的解决之唯一機會、法報反因日本此牒、而作更大樂觀、小巴黎人報謂日代表團在過去二十四小時内已有極可注意的進步、以促成此問題之美滿解决云、（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）美參議員華爾希今日在此間發一意見書、提議對日經濟封鎖、爲處理東三省事件之適當方法、以爲目下黑省戰事、不久勢將釀成眞戰爭、一旦中日宣戰後、日海軍必封鎖中國海口、此舉將有妨美國商務、是故與其釀成日後戰事、不若美國此時即取嚴峻行動、解决中日爭執之爲愈、按華爾希爲民主黨員任參院外交委員會委員、平日對於政府常有激烈抨擊、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<h3>道威斯表示不欲列席國聯</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　道威斯返旅館時、向美國報館記者宣稱、余之使命、係與各國代表合作、以期解决滿洲爭端、美國係非戰公約簽字國、亦嘗簽訂華盛頓九國條約、對於此項條約所載之高尙目的、深望其能逹到、對於中日爭端、並望能照上項條約所定原則、予以解决、行政院現有之辯論與調解方式、即屬解决爭端之道、而有美國代表在塲、實亦有裨於行政院之任務、美國非國聯會會員、其對於關係盟約實施之討論、參加實爲不公、且可使行政院爲難、雖然國聯會欲爲滿洲恢復和平、凡所努力、美國極端表示同情、要之美國對於此案、必當保留其判斷曲直之自由也云云、（二十日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省聲稱、日本不反對駐英美大使道威斯之出席巴黎國聯行政會、但保留日後提出美代表參加行政會法律問題之權瘧（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>出淵通知美國務院</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日日大使出淵訪史汀生、保證日軍俟黑軍馬部全敗後、即將擊退齊齊哈爾、但基有意外事件發生、則或有延長佔據時期之必要、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日大使出淵昨通知國務院、俟馬占山軍隊完全失敗後、日軍即退出齊齊哈爾、聞國務院人員接此通告、面呈惶遽之象、出淵又謂此事發生、殊可扼腕、但日軍進攻出於自衛云、參院外交委員長波拉對客發言、謂渠確信日本欲統治滿洲、（二十日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>蔣主席决心收回失地</h3>
<p>自九月十八暴日實施武力不宣而戰之後。吾人早已料知日人已具久踞我東北。以遂其所大欲之决心。同時更早已料知待助於人。終無以抗制日軍繼續擴大之暴行。今則果　。錦州之襲擊。天津之煽亂。齊齊哈爾之佔領。以及國聯之敷衍遷延。日人之强横狡辯。皆足以證明事態已逹到最嚴重之地步。我國家民族已臨到忍無可忍待無可待之最後時機。　　處此最嚴重之地位與最後之時機。我政府應如何當機立决。人民早已有同一之意志。迫切之呼籲。其應以有效之手段。濟國際公理正義勸告之窮。并維護我民族生存之正當權利。决然奮起。驅逐踞我领土之暴軍。收復我陷落之疆土。此蓋爲我負有捍衛國家之重責之將士應盡之天職。亦即我全體人民萬口同聲之公意。</p>
<p>九月十八變。我擐甲執戈之將士。竟毫無抵抗而節退却。使暴軍横闖直衝如入無人之境。此笙怯弱畏葸放棄責任之表示。實爲我全國將士之大辱。使我古國之民族精神。頓淪於黯淡無光。黑省主席馬占山。今日之所以博得我全體民衆之欽敬愛戴。雖婦人孺子亦推崇備至者。此無他。以馬之能盡其衛國守土之責而已。人民在今日所希望於我政府我全國將士者無他。亦惟盡責而已。克盡其責。即爲人民之政府。人民之武力。即爲人民所推崇愛戴。</p>
<p>據前日蔣主席在四全大會演說。謂已具北上收回失地之决心。昨日大會復正式通過訓令蔣主席即日北上收回失地之决議。全國人民聆此悲壯之演說。與斷然之决議。蓋無不投袂而起。準備犧牲一切以爲我政府之後盾。同時更無不深致同情於我政府今日之最後决斷。挽救我民族生命於埀危。</p>
<p>吾人敢斷言處於今日公理不彰。正義銷沉之日。依人立國。斷無倖存之理。惟自助乃能致人助。亦惟自助乃能自救。盟約之遵守。和平之呼籲。力竭聲嘶。而日軍暴行且日益擴大。盟約無靈。公理埋没。此時而尙不斷然奮起。以嚴正之手段。作有效之抗制。乃坐視日人之踞我東北半壁山河。以發揮其帝國主義之野心。以推進其大陸政策。以危害全人類之安寗。則不僅我民族之淪亡可立而待。而坐縱强暴。加裁制。且貽全人類以無窮之患。爲全人類之罪人。故吾人對於蔣主席决意北上收回失地之宣示。與四全大會之决議。謹以無限之熱忱。表示擁護。盼望立即實現。國脈危殆。存亡之機。繫此一舉。全國人民都當急起準備。以男兒之熱血。衝向戰地。持公理正義與强暴作拼生死之肉摶戰。</p>

<h3>日政府贊同國聯派調查團</h3>
<p>聲稱此爲日本重要讓步</p>
<p>（東京）官場今日否認日本行須中國承認五項基本要點、然後始允派員赴滿調查之消息、謂日本已無條件依允調查團之遣派、此爲日本重要讓步、日本所擬妥恊辦法、原爲兩重性質、即國聯須派出調查團、並須令中國根據五點開始直接談判是、嗣覺中國未能依允、故放棄第二建議、但日本雖可在中國承認日本五點以前贊成派員調查、然日本並無放棄必欲中國最後承認此五點之意、日政府主張調查團須有日代表加入、亦不反對中代表加入、並主張調查範圍包括調查反日運動、中國擔保生命財產之能力、及中國不尊動條約等事、至於在滿調查、應集中於日本撤兵意見如何合理之問題、日官塲又聲稱、日本僅欲在滿洲成立永遠和平與秩序、此　與陳友仁政策相合、陳固主張解除滿洲　武主義、並驅除軍閥云、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）白里安頃向行政院及日本代表團提出建議、主張遣派中立委員團、對於滿洲情狀、并對於保護外僑安全及尊重條約中國所能盡力之程度加以調查、本日夜間芳澤已向東京請示、現正等候訓令、此項建議尙未送逹中國代表團、（十九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）　今日此間日大使署聲稱、日政府已致文法外部、拉受國聯委員會赴東三省調查提議、並願俟諸國聯委員調查閲畢以後、但今日觀察國聯形勢者深慮日本此種撤回要求之宣言、未免已遲月、恐仍未必能助成東三省事件之解决慮中國將不能同意在撤兵以前派遣國聯調查委員也、至若中國接受此議之後、則委員人數、聞理事會擬派六人、美法英德荷及南美籍各一人、美籍擬請潘興上將、法籍則在貝當衛格諸人中任請其一、暫時撤回中國必須承認五項基本原則之要求、今晨九時三十分白里安即邀國聯辦事大員討論日本來文、嗣記者詢諸國聯中人、但對於日本之新貢獻、不願有所評論、僅稱、現須勸說中國政府接受日軍未撤兵前派員調查之計劃、至理事會之討論、亦必仍舊集中於中國要求之撤兵問題、此次日本未嘗明定撤兵日期、但願在事勢可能上、絕不遲延從事撤兵云、今午白里安邀芳澤至外部相晤、芳澤未往、旋有電話致白里安、道逹遲延之歉忱、（二十日國民電）</p>

<p>第一、日軍之非法駐紮東省、實搆成最大之侵略行爲、其他因駐軍而發生之零星侵略行動、尤不勝枚舉、日人雖屢稱日守備隊有沿南滿路駐紮儺、但事實上日守備隊護路、旣無法律根據、更無條約規定、一觀一九○五年十二月二十二日在北京簽字之中日條約、即可明瞭、按該約中國僅承認將俄國按照日俄和約第五欵·及第六欵、允讓與日本之一切權利槪行允諾、未及其他、同時一九二二年華府會議紀錄、亦有明顯之證明、在華會時日代表旣不能證明南滿駐兵有條約上根據、僅以日本在滿駐兵爲事實上需要之言相搪講、其理屈詞窮、已可想見、</p>
<p>在兩月以前、日本南陸相宣稱、日本有權在南滿路沿線每啟羅米突駐兵十五人、據彼之估計、南滿路全線應駐軍一萬六千五百人、但在事實上、除九月十八日以後、由日本派來之軍隊不計外、計在南滿路沿線者、有混成師一萬四千七百六十人、守備隊五千四百人、憲兵分遣隊二千五百六十人、飛機五十二架、駕駛官兵一千一百一十人、路警二千五百人、及分駐各日領署之日警察三千餘人、故除日領署之警察及路警不計外、日本計在東三省駐有大軍二萬三千人、爲戰事之準備、</p>
<p>第二、各日領署設立警察、實屬非法、中國方面雖屢經抗議、俱無效果、查日領署設警、爲中日衝突最大之原因、而因設警引起之中日糾紛、以民國五年之鄭家屯案爲最重要、下列一段、爲民國五年中國政府於解决鄭家屯案時對日本要求設警答覆書中之一節、今日中國政府對於日本此種侵略行爲之態度、仍未變更、故仍引用之以說明中國政府之態度、一查鄭家屯案、外交部宣言書中答復日方要求之第二點、謂關於派駐警察官事件、中政府答復謂、一九一五年五月二十五日所締之新約規定、凡約中所述及一切在南滿洲及東内蒙古之日本臣民、應服從中國警察法令納税、是由治外權所發生之問題、已預爲之</p>
<p>備、日本公使雖或確實聲明、此項日本警察决不干涉中國地方行政及警察權、然在中國領土駐　日本警察、將於中國主權之精神、及形式上均有妨碍、且於中國人民方面致生誤會、有損兩國友善之關係、至現在滿洲已經設置之日本警察駐紮所、曾由中國政府及地方官吏迭次抗議、日本不理中政府之抗議、違法駐紮警察官於鄭家屯、（鄭家屯爲中國領土、去鐵路培界甚遠、）中政府經派員考查、確信該日本警察官之舉動、即此次不幸之衝突之直接原因、中政府絕對不能承認日本在南滿洲設立警察駐紮所、且更抗議、請日本將已經設立之警察駐紮所撤除、」</p>
<p>日方對外謂中國違反條約、對中國要求尊重一九一五年之中日條約、而其自身竟未顧及其在東三省自行設立並無任何法律根據之警察、第三、日本在東三省之侵略行爲、實不勝枚舉、茲將比較重要之事件列下、以揭露日人之野心、計（一）殘害華人、如本年五月二日遼陽米雙英被日警於毒打後用煤油灌焚而死、（二）濫捕並殺傷我國官吏、如（甲）十八年九月二十三日、日本兵騷擾鐵嶺茶園、不服我警勸阻、並殺傷警察、更繳我警隊之械、（乙）同年一月二十七日、日警署長包圍本溪縣府、擄去縣長、並搗毁我國官署（三）包庇奸民、如十九年十二月、日警包庇韓人販運嗎啡等違禁品、搗毁我營口警所、此外又有日商人不遵檢查、搗毁我安東海關等情事、（四）擅在重要城鎭或近郊、作戰鬥演習、危害居民、傷損禾稼、每年有數十起、（五）違約侵害我國軍運、如民十四年冬無故禁止中國軍隊在沿南滿綫二十里行動、（六）干涉内攻、如（甲）在鐵道沿綫非法課税、並妨碍我國税權、如印花税營業税之柴專賣税等、悉受阻碍、（乙）侵奪郵電並礦權、如沿南滿路綫、設立郵局、擅設商用電報電話無綫電及長途電氣供給、置中國抗議於不顧、（丙）擾亂金融、如朝鮮銀行擅自發行不能兌現及在日本國内無法價資格之金票一萬二千四百萬元、正金銀行發行銀幣鈔票五百萬元、并在南滿沿線名埠、擅設交易所、操縱金融、及特產買賣、并放縱日本浪人鑄造及行使僞幣、（丁）侵佔土地、并擅開溝渠、私築堤壩、妨害農田水利、在瀋陽通遼各地、均迭有此等行爲、最近萬寳山事件、則尤其最著者、（戊）破壞交通、如十八年六月二十七日、日本武裝軍警拆毁我北</p>
<p>寗鐵路、又民國十六年、吉海鐵路興築時、南滿鐵路拒絕運料、及路成又不許與吉長路接軌、（己）妨害市政、如民國十四年瀋陽整理市衢、凡日人建築、不允退讓、反藉端要挾、阻止測量及放寛諸計畫、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>吳大澈以名翰林一躍而開藩。再躍而撫湘。曾一度練兵新　。故有知兵之虚名。輕　緩帶。雅歌投　。居然自命爲</p>
<p>風流儒將也。迨甲午變起。吳　纓出師。幕府中都吳下知名之士。陸蓮夫吳倉碩翁印若沈肖均等咸　致之。師駐錦州。每日與僚屬魏光　等。飛　醉月。掃雀呑雲。悠然自得。若不知强敵之在前也。文告中有本帥有七擒七縱之能。日曾有三戰三北之兆。對仗雖工。而近於誇。　者早知其驕必敗也。時前鋒已有小接觸。與大營相距尙有數十男。一夕倭奴用探海燈遙燭。而砲聲隨之。聲震百里。吳倉碩適奉差　騎帶從弁十餘騎。巡視各營。聞砲聲墮馬。大呼中電砲。疲不能行。從弁挾之歸。病臥數日。急請假養疴。遄歸滬上。遂不復往。陸廉夫於軍書旁午之餘。猶調脂研黛。揮翰寫山水花卉小幅。好整以暇。時人咸服其有鎭定功夫。翁印若最爲幹練。短服戎裝。每夕奔馳數十里。時獲倭偵。嚴加訊問。始知敵軍之奸謀。得以生還。　不幸中之大幸也。而日人之恨翁。幾如眼中釘。假使當時無翁在。　　致全軍俱墨矣。</p>
<h3>訪馬占山將軍記</h3>
<p>— 得經</p>
<p>客歲憑曾因事遍游黑省。至呼蘭訪馬占山將軍。將軍駐紥該縣。商民有口皆碑。頌讚將軍之功德。時爲黑省騎兵混成第一旅旅長。（黑省無師軍之組織）初訪未見。因將軍外出。一日余步行途中。遙望一馬車奔馳而來。及近。互相注視。彼見吾所着服裝。知前訪未遇之友。即停車啓窗招呼。連說歉甚歉甚。並以手示車座曰。請來請來。余殊驚異。遂與將軍併肩而坐。逹其寓所。</p>
<p>將軍年約四十餘。身材不高。面目清瘦。談吐磊落。然亦含有文士風。兩目奕奕然。精光四射。令人不敢正視。小鬍横伏唇上。暗示其英武與威嚴焉。</p>
<p>翌日宴客。將軍延余上座。敬禮如上賓。以致余手足失措。莫知所爲。將軍一一介紹諸同席。並代余說明來意。余神色稍舒。後過往較密。則政治軍事經濟地理無所不談。言及中東之役。則感慨嘆息。一語數頓。若不勝其悲憤者。</p>
<p>將軍之識見卓絕。尤非常人所及。對於莫德惠使俄事。曾有以下之議論。「莫君任中國代表。爲交涉中東路事。固屬佳事。莫君對國際情形不甚明瞭。未免美中不足。然其特長足補其缺點而有餘。第一莫君處事老成持重。審愼度理。不輕浮。不誇張。不專權。不妄作决斷。凡事請示中央而辦理。第二莫君處事不畏强權。刀斧加之而不屈。貨利誘之而不動。莫君有此二長。中東路交涉事。雖不能勝利。而亦不至於定辱國之條約。如清時之崇厚輩也。」</p>
<p>一日。復至將軍寓所會談。家人言。出外就浴。余至浴室。問堂倌曰。馬將軍安在。堂倌以目示余。則見將軍正浴畢理裝。余欲代付浴鈔。將軍正視。遂分付而返。後又在齊齊哈爾謀一面。余即回滬。今將軍以孤軍抗日。大義凛然。尤令予感懷不置焉。（移酬援黑）</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>英國的女子偵探隊英國女子麗蓮史多雷女士。Miss　LilianStorey近在利物浦Liverpool地方組織一個女子偵探隊。以與當地的盜賊作戰。全隊的女子。都須機警而奮勇。具有大無畏的精神。務使盜賊不能在利物浦立足而後已。據史多雷女士對人說。「我部下的偵探們。必須有合格的身體。并擅長拳術。遇了强暴之徒。便可對付他們。不致以女子而示弱。伊們并須會開機脚車。以便一遇事故。立即飛快的出發。而他們的格言是「看一切。聽一切。沈默無語。而懷疑一切的人。」此隊現已成立。將來利物浦的强盜惡賊。恐將聞風而逃了。</p>
<p>警察世家　英國利定Reaingd地方。有一位警官。在警界中服務了二十八年。最近因年老而退休了。最有趣的。他呱呱墮地時。就在警察署中。他的父親。祖父。兩位伯伯。一位哥哥。和一位妻弟也都是警界中人。這眞可稱爲警察世家了。</p>
<h3>暴日刦去之四庫全書</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>此次暴日於九月十八日佔我東北之後。東北精華。損失殆盡。而我國四千餘年文化歷史上最有價值之四庫全書。向保藏於遼陽者。亦被暴日刦去。我國文化。於此遂不復完全存在。四庫全書。修於遜清翰隆時。内分經史子集四大部。各部分類。共分四十四類。全書計三千四百六十種。修書時歷盡艱苦。適逢天下太平之秋。方有此成績。緣起於大興朱竹君。奏請開四庫全書館。清高宗用其說。總纂官一席。本擬屬之朱氏。後因事未果。乃由河間紀文逹公曉風主之。紀貫澈儒籍。旁通百家。凡六經備注得失。諸史異同。子集分支派别。以及詞曲醫卜之類。岡不抉奥提綱。溯源竟委。每書仿劉向曾鞏例。作提要冠之簡首。評騭精審。識力在王仲寳阮孝緒之上。復以是時。帝王之權力。令各省督撫會同學政等。通飭所屬。加意購訪。除坊肆所售之舉業時文。及民間無用之族譜尺牘屏幛壽言編刻唱酬詩文瑣屑無當者外。隨時採集。彙送京師。歷時十年之久。得書數十萬種。古今書藉。可謂網羅殆盡。襄理其事者。有副總纂陸錫熊及編纂陸費墀戴震王念孫吳錫琪等百餘人。皆一時知名之士。當時欲以聚珍版刊印。卒以費鉅未果。乃招成手抄。抄者逹一千五百人。閲時九載。方成七部。全書字字工整。無錯誤脱落之弊。此一千五百人。抄後皆簡爲各省知縣。以爲酬庸。書修廣一律。字皆工楷。歷時十三年餘。工程浩大。無與比擬。今在瀋陽者。共計七萬五千八百五十餘卷。盡被暴日運去。嗚呼。此眞國際之大盜矣。</p>
<h3>名園觀光記</h3>
<p>— 馬孟容</p>
<p>近年吾國人士深知園藝農業之可貴。亦頗從事經營。最見成續者。當推江灣上海種植園。該園主人爲虞洽卿先生之長公子順恩君所主辦。規模宏大。予久耳而未嘗一覩爲快也。昨日主人與其介姊澹涵女士同邀往觀。予近因筆墨之債纍纍。苦少休息。亦願偷間半日。一領略秋郊清景。主人又邀徐朗西·謝公展·張時敏·江一平·樓辛壺·張紅薇·王師子·鄭　靑·余威丹·諸同道。及男女來賓共三十餘人。傍午集該園之雪廬。餐後。主人導觀全園。計分菊花洋卉盤栽蔬果苗木雞塲等部。時屆冬初。風霜雖厲。而菊花猶能凌寒競艶。琪　挺然不撓之氣槪可尙矣。佳種可二百餘。不備記。洋卉悉置暖室内。有康納薰百餘種。香色均佳。雛菊月季花亦均百餘種。海堂日來紅及他草花亦都百餘種。暖以熱汽。可經冬開開花不絕。茶花爲敝地（永嘉）特產。佳者一本能開花十餘色。價值百餘金。該園招敝地花匠管理之。此花在上海不易種。可别樹一幟焉。盤栽向爲倭人所專擅。輸出不貲。主人有盤栽百餘種。極古雅不易得。佳者值千金。較倭品有過之。亦挽回利權之一也。最足注意者。厥爲養雞塲。飼有意種美種及本國種數百羽。食料通風取暖均用科學方法。故能肥碩繁滋。又有養雞箱電孵汽孵等箱。均以重價購自外國。現均可仿造而價特廉。河濱飼白鴨一羣。羽毛鮮美。解自呼名。可愛也。覽畢。返室休憩。澹涵女士雅擅書畫。譽重藝林。即出紙筆屬爲揮寫。遂與公展辛壺師子紅薇　靑時敏合作菊花桃柳雞鴨數幀。各分題一幀似主人留念。予戲筆作雛雞。　　欲動。岫雲女士見而索去。又主人知予能畫蟹。因屬再寫墨蟹一幀。時已薄暮。主人折菊贈别而散。家君亦喜種植。以資頣養。故家園花木殊夥。數年未歸。蒼松欲老。黄花笑人矣。記畢爲之黯然。（却酬）</p>

<h3>鄕下人又到上海（二十三）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>「那些野雞，自身旣如此可憐，又是害人的東西，怎麽不禁止呢？」鄕下人提出了這個問題。</p>
<p>「誰去禁止他們呢？你要知道此地是租界，歸外國人管理，本來租界以外，就没有那種拉客的野雞。」</p>
<p>「那末當野雞的究竟是中國人，被外國人看了，也失了我們中國人的面子，中國人也不能同外國人說說，請他們禁止的嗎？租界裏住的全是中國人，一點兒權柄也没有的嗎？」鄕下人覺得有些看不慣。</p>
<p>「中國人自然也可以說說。不是也組織了納税華人會嗎？還有董事咧，委員咧；照例是那種傷風敗俗，害人害己的事，應該禁止的。」</p>
<p>「那末怎麽不禁止呢？」鄕下人又進了一步。</p>
<p>「這個我也不知道。他們那些大人先生，事情很忙，誰還顧到那些小事情。再者，他們也决計不會去打野雞，打野雞的，就應該受那生花柳病的懲罰。還有一說：倘然把站馬路的野雞都禁止了，使馬路上靜悄悄，打露天茶園的人，就要覺得無趣。專門治花柳病的醫師們，要少做不少的生意，門可羅雀，也不是民生主義咧。一那位朋友，覺得話講得太多了，恰恰那邊走過巡捕來，怕招了人家的忌，便向鄕下人說了一聲：「再會。」走開去了。</p>
<p>鄕下人雖没有找到了他的外甥阿木林，可是他的肚子裏，轆轆作響，五臓殿裏有些兒起了恐慌了。他想：這時候跑到了梅蘭坊，到他外甥那裏去，只怕他們已經喫過了夜飯。鄕下人是不喜歡打擾人家的，還是外面找一個飯館子，把肚皮醫飽了以後，再到人家去，較爲妥當點。不然，空着肚子，到人家去，人家問：「吃過了！吃過了！」却是肚裏餓得咕哩咕哩亂呌，也覺得犯不着。</p>
<p>他有過一次經騐：從前也是在馬路上，覺得肚子餓了，他要尋一家飯店，喫飽他的肚子。他看見一塊很大的招牌，寫着某某飯店，他便貿貿然跑進去了。誰知進去一看，却是一間一間的臥室，很講究的牀，很華麗的被褥，還有很標　的女人。人家問他來做什麽？他說是來吃飯的丨人家把他推出來，說我們還以爲你是來開房間睡覺的，喫飯到别處去。他還給人面紅頸赤的爭論了半天，說你們招牌上不是明明寫着什麽飯店，什麽飯店嗎？</p>
<p>經騐告訴了他，上海的所謂飯店，是同女人睡覺的，不是吃飯的。</p>

<h3>外滙步趨疲途</h3>
<p>金業中扒塞各異</p>
<p>昨日英美印銀市均稍見漲、惟市面以平復堅而匯兌仍趨小勢、殆匯豐掛牌已放長二檔、計英金半辨士、爲一先令八辨士七五、美金長七五、計三十二元半、香港加零六二五、爲七十六兩九三七五、其餘均亦趨硬、至於銀行實際交易之價、初平後鬆、復後轉萎、午後尤頽、然複什之態、結果比前晚、計英金長二五、美金長五六二五、而標金跌風甚猛、實因時局紛擾之影響、並傳國聯有對日依會章辦理之說、故匯市跟隨鬆折也、金業中交易不鮮、惟扒塞異趨、計英金約成交十餘萬鎊、美金六七十萬元、各行對做者不少云、</p>

<h3>英美銀價又見微長</h3>
<p>昨據倫敦電訊、大條銀近期未有伸縮、遠期回長一二五、同爲十八便士零六二五、脚地中國略有買進、遠期市面平穏、收市後市况較堅、美國因缺乏賣户報告、所做交易價在掛牌價二五之上、又接紐約電訊、美銀價亦回長六二五、計現貨三角零三七五、英對美降去八七五、爲三元七角六分二五、美對英降去一分一二五、爲三元七角六分一二五、英滬先令仍爲一先令九便士七五、孟買現貨加大十安那、爲五十八羅比十四安那、遠期亦升十一安那、計五十九羅比零二安那云、</p>
<h3>厘拆緊鬆依舊</h3>
<p>昨日銀根與前日上午市大都相仿、銀拆市價早市爲三錢三分、午市爲三錢五分、劃頭加水一錢八九分、銀行掛牌一錢三分、洋厘晨軟午俏、早市爲七錢二分四厘七毫半、午市爲七錢二分五厘、較前日午市激昂一毫二忽半、做出匯劃票欵、早市一百十一萬、午市一百三十萬零一、鈔票早市六萬、午市二萬、塲外鈔票早市十一萬五千、午市八萬五千、銀行交易、早市互市八十五萬、午市六十五萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百七十餘萬、鈔票進出一百二三十萬、錢莊洋公單收解五百七十餘萬、銀公單收解四千三百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百四十餘萬、銀劃頭欵收解三百五十餘萬、各路匯欵收解五十餘萬、拆票交易從前有六七百萬、現在僅四百餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百三十餘萬、銀行收解消息、華商收解票欵二百十餘萬、外商收解票欵一百五六十萬、各種貨匯税雜諸欵收解七百八九十萬、特欵收解二百三四十萬、押欵交易五十餘萬、進倉七十萬、出倉四十萬、小錢莊交易六十餘萬、江南小洋早午兩市均爲六錢四分八厘、較前日驟小三厘七毫半、緣買氣衰殆、市價乃落、交易早市四千角、午市三千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢四分七厘八毫七忽半、午市突又轉昂二厘半、爲六錢五分、結果較前日早市反昂一厘、交易早市十六萬角、午市九萬角、銅元改縮一千文、爲三百七十八千文、交易二萬九千餘串、</p>
<h3>證劵日陷龍江後公債復猛跌</h3>
<p>下降逹二三元左右</p>
<p>昨日各債券市况、現貨雖開出多種、成交依然稀少、其貨跌價甚烈、交易益旺、惟以零星進出爲多、大户仍鮮鉅額成交、查各債券市價之變動情形、黑省失陷、已爲事實、市人鑒於日人之不顧國際信義、步步進迫、羣慮中日國交、終將破裂、蓋國聯會雖集議多日、而咸意存觀望、故一般人均頗悲觀、人心益呈虚弱、雖金融業方面態度鎭定、絕鮮售出、終以市上需要冷淡、零星售出則殊活潑、各債價在上午一致續跌一元左右、後市形勢益覺緊張、市上有國聯形勢惡化、致　出交易益盛、初拍編遣裁兵時、勢尙和緩、旋跌勢忽見轉烈、使非某方有相當收進、則二○關統税等、恐將被迫而跌至限價停拍、結果較前日除九六關税整六等穏定外、　遣裁兵跌逾一元、二○關捲統税跌逾三元、餘亦跌二元以上、觀債市形勢、現因人心不安、趨勢極混亂、雖各價現已跌至低度、恐仍未許樂觀也、計現貨交易共八千元、期貨前後市合計一千三百六十六萬元、内統鹽税二○關各二百餘萬元、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市零落不堪</h3>
<p>國難如斯…投機無意</p>
<p>紗市甚疲趨勢渙散、因黑垣被暴日搶佔、人心異常激憤、多數均垂頭喪氣、無意營業、故拍開黑板占多數、市氣極其閑散、現紗銷路仍滯、各帮以銀根奇緊、生意甚缺云、</p>
<p>人標價黑板居多　人標前市開盤、以時局不佳、形勢甚軟、各跌一·二錢、午後各月微漲一·二·三錢、全日成交統計一萬一千六百包、查賣出大手孚八百包、恒益一千○五十包、公泰三百包、買進信誠六百包、長豐七百五十包同餘五百包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市微俏</h3>
<p>棉市略堅、以本月份收貨者雖缺、而交貨者亦少、市氣又硬、遠月亦被其帶起、但現棉各廠絕無問訊、因外棉早已吸飽、目前無需用之必要、所以大勢極其軟化、</p>
<p>漢標有空户抵補　漢標前市開盤、以外棉趨疲、人心軟化、各跌一錢二三盤稍漲、結果張五分至一錢、午後空頭抵補、各月漲一錢五分至二錢五分、全日成交統計四萬一千七百担、查賣出源大一千四百担、益成一千六百担長豐一千四百担、信誠七百担、買進明德三千担、天隆一千三百擔、餘昶二千二百担、茲將收盤價列左、漢標收盤價漲跌存賬數</p>

<h3>外棉一致報跌</h3>
<p>昨日美棉初因多頭了結而疲、收盤時一部份空户抵補、趨勢略堅、計期貨跌二至四磅音、現貨跌五磅音、英棉期貨跌三至五點、現貨跌十五點、埃及棉現貨跌二十五點、印棉因歐洲出口商賣出而軟、計平果爾跌三·五羅比、奥姆辣跌三·二五羅比、白羅縘跌四·五羅比、原電錄左、（十九日電）</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市緊而復軟</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源仍稀、而浦存亦薄、城鄕店銷尙未見爽、實　時局緊張、銀根受軋、人心平淡、成交較昨轉遜、故市面亦屬不固、是以厚新粳行情就告下落、薄早二稻貨雖零星、銷塲本街轉細、寗胃還可、市價平庸洋杜尖到銷二淡、市氣榮辱、陰化到積無多、零交　選頂料而已、　胃不甚貪取、市况亦轉平平、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日蘇州河畔共到五十餘艘、本街絕無變化、蘇常中關貨價疲二角、大盤較南市爲和平、溧陽宜興等貨、存底不厚、店胃稀少、盤面帶鬆之象、　種飛來鳳來貨略接、鄕莊帮最活、行情咸起角許、洋杜尖及埠尖稍有到埠、零銷雖清、市形坐定、</p>
<h3>洋客秈實銷清淡</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、初承前日市氣、形勢甚佳、但本客辦胃甚淡、市面乃無繼續上漲、統市祗開小絞二百包、價十元○二角、又台州中關白米一百五十包、價爲十元、其他均無成交、期貨洋行續抛、市面亦居平軟、祥茂洋行新抛一月份小絞一千噸、英華司交貨、價四兩七錢半、回蘢貨則有小絞四月份一百噸、價五兩○七分、一號西貢二月份三百噸、價五兩四錢半、統由本街收進云</p>
<h3>麥銷行將停頓</h3>
<p>標準近平而遠穏</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、大致呈近平遠穏之象、近期因交割又近、業外多頭又須了結、在外銷轉寂之中、麥市當鮮騰逹之望、惟遠期因洋麥報漲四五角、人心略振、然交易甚寂、觀後步恐須入停頓之局矣、結果本月份及十二月份小一分、一月份好二分、二三月份好三分、四月份好二分云、</p>
<h3>粉市在觀望中</h3>
<p>昨日粉市又轉穏定之局、以洋麥報價轉漲四五角左右、金市亦呈盤旋、無大上落、因此買賣雙方、均見沉寂、以國難方殷、業内外人心、不免惴惴、如果對日絕交、漲音固多、跌亦不免、蓋洋　麥之來源、因受打擊、但南北洋之實銷、亦必阻滯、人心之觀望、未始無因也、結果本月份較前日微好二厘半、十二月份好二厘半、一二月份好五厘、三月份好二厘半、四月份好五厘云、</p>
<h3>糖市劃盤糖市又復轉落</h3>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訊、古巴現糖價仍一·三七五、紐約期糖明年三月份一·二二、比前電未有升、五月份一·二五、跌一分、九月份一·三五、亦無變更、爪哇現期糖依然無升降、公會市塲劃盤交易岑寂、買氣凋零、市形復轉萎弱、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價爲十兩、磨細砂白十兩零零五分、二零號中砂白九兩八錢、趨勢平定、太古糖僅B嘜十一兩五錢、略有成交、餘均相持中、號盤成交仍靜、昨報鶴松冰開價實爲八兩四錢、附此糾正、</p>
<h3>閘北貨同安圓來源銳减</h3>
<p>同安桂圓、今庚出產本極歉薄、故首盤開價甚昂、入後漸漸見低落、查現市比最高價已降去四五兩之譜、故近期到輪來貨鋭减、據函訊地頭、存底亦稀、以申市比擬、確須虧耗、此後如申市不能轉機、則來源勢必告乏也、</p>
<h3>絲茶路莊珍眉英銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日來路莊之珍眉綠茶、交易續盛、全市計由怡和恊和同孚錦隆等行、買進屯溪珍眉珠茶、共逹一千五百餘箱、市盤較前數月無變動、婺源高等珍眉、天裕恰和等行、亦均有電報發出、惟貢熙一項、錢莊仍在觀望中、白頭行家、亦無人問及、市况至爲沉靜云、</p>
<h3>油市新貨將到之柏油市</h3>
<p>今庚柏油漲風、實開從來未有之新紀錄、當夏秋之交、聲勢地盛、漢口名重荆售至三十八兩、　城油三十四兩、較往年增高一倍、製燭淘家以身本高昂、均改變方針、以火油精爲喪、而柏油爲表、故柏油用塲因是大减、存貨雖薄、奈其銷塲更清、致中秋後竟至無人問訊、價格即覺高而可危、迨至浙路金華蘭溪等處產地新貨已見、而杭州行家存積尙有一二千件、漸入恐慌狀態、各行均派人四處推銷、無非跌價不可、乃當彼此競銷之際、價格之一落千丈、不喻而知也、兩句之間蘭溪平砠柏油每砠由四十元、跌至二十四元、此種跌風、亦爲市上所無、近日因跌之過猛、似有一步可站、而漢市亦起跌風、最近一週内跌去四五兩、據昨日漢函所報、津市油開二十二兩、麻城油無市、大約尖貨亦祇二十二三兩而已、朱洪名重荆一週前曾開過二十八兩、照近日比較、最大不過二十四兩足矣、滬上號家存貨將罄、新貨未有到過、半月後則鄰近浙西之禾本當可到滬矣、惟禾本貨品最良、價亦最高、不能與蘭柏一槪而論也、</p>
<h3>煤炭煙煤統屑走銷呆滯</h3>
<p>各種烟煤統屑、近日來因絲廠停工、走銷呆滯、且　路客帮廠家、購進亦懈、市場交易、更覺呆頓、售價亦難起色、昨日做開、白谷囤統三百十八噸、價十四兩、博山統三百噸、價十一兩二錢半、北票屑二百五十噸、價十兩云、</p>
<h3>五金各貨標準一落千丈</h3>
<p>時局混沌…客銷停滯</p>
<p>鈒根暗緊…貨主放</p>
<p>五金市情、邇因時局混沌、各帮採辦均不懈各貨標準亦因人心不固、似有一落千丈之勢、如平白鐵·瓦楞鐵·馬口鐵·新洋元·三角鐵·新鉛絲·新鐵絲·靑鉛·點錫等、無一不在江河日下之勢也、况銀根暗緊、致一般内幕緊迫之同業、莫不在私自放盤而求售、因是前途趨况、一時　不易樂觀也、</p>

<h3>太古漢陽輪在厦海遇盜刧掠</h3>
<p>盜匪誤會有鉅欵在船</p>

<p>無現欵大失望　匪首以槍抵二副之胸、逼令將船内所載之大批現洋、如數交出、否則開槍、當時由二副向盜匪述明本輪並未裝有現欵、所載盡爲貨物、匪猶不信、該二副允將艙單交閲、以資取信、匪徒至此、始知已誤登輪船、頓現失望之色、但已經騎刧、豈肯即此罷休、乃將各船員驅禁一室、便開始刦掠、</p>
<p>刦旅客掠貨件　匪衆在失望之餘、遂開始實行搜刧、先向船内乘客逐一搜刧、凡屬所帶之銀錢衣飾、均被刧奪一空、匪衆心猶未足、復打開貨艙、將所載貨物内之較貴重者、亦被搬去若干件、損失細數、現在尙未得知、搜刧竣事、各匪乃解放舢舨、運取贓物、下海而逸、</p>
<p>船主電告港滬　海盜逃後、被禁閉之船主船員、始經得出、重加整理、立即用無線電報告香港總行、述明在途遇盜、復由港行轉電來滬報告、現在漢陽輪已往厦門、惟電報簡單、未得被刧之銀錢貨物述明、至行刧時有無傷人、而盜去時曾否帮架旅客、亦未言及、昨日滬行已去電詢問、其詳細情形、今日或可得知矣、</p>

<h3>張立暘立時君訊</h3>
<p>（於處置封存日貨辦法問題）</p>
<p>請國民注意勿自己毁壞最後的武器存亡生死關頭在此一點</p>
<p>閲上海市商會議决處置封存日貨辦法一則、不覺非常疑懼、夫繳納實業基金、固爲提倡國貨之一種方法、顧因此而可公然出賣日貨、並無毅然抵制日貨之决心與期限、如是、不特將有奸商發生舞弊情事、抑且使抵制日貨、無形消滅、茲將管、見所及、容與各界一商榷焉、（一）限進貨時期之早晚、定繳納基金之多寡、此種辦法、表面上似甚完備、但實際、前後所進之貨、决難以分别其時期、（假使某商店於七月分進日貨五打、八月分進五打、現除出售外、尚餘四打、試問用何法定其時間、而責其繳納基金、）鄙意以爲、所封日貨、不必分列時間、至少一例務須繳納實業基金百分之三十、使該種日貨之賣價、比國貨昂貴、於是奸商不能圖利、買客亦趨買國貨、如是、日貨可以根本抵制、而國貨可以無形推廣銷路也、（二）對於九月十八日以後所進日貨、鄙意以爲此種日貨、當然係喪心病狂之奸商所進、應處相當懲罰、即將其貨交市商會、定期公賣、售得之欵、除三成發還商人、一成作爲開支、其餘六成、掃數充作基金及捐賑水災之用、藉資懲戒、（三）對於夏季日貨、銀錢二界、共同組織一特種押欵機關、欵項由銀錢同業、按各行莊資本之大小比例、出若干數、匯交該押欵機關、通告各商號、將夏季日貨、向該押欵機關抵押、其抵押貨欵之折扣、由銀錢及商號、三方面派人組織一委員會、以審定之、如是、則使一般商號、不致有銀錢週轉不靈之虞、總之、吾人際此倭奴日形横蠻之秋、萬不可再使仇貨得在滬上成爲普徧而公然出售之貨物、抑更有進者、吾人一方面固念應顧商人之困難、對於已進日貨在相當犧牲中、使其出售以調劑金融、而對於奸商乘機圖利一點、尤應格外制裁而監督之、</p>
<p>（覆）此問題值得鄭重研究、國民對日最後之武器、就是抵貨、抵貨之有效無效、全視此問題虚置之適當與否、試將關於處置封存日貨種種方法、就歷來所采用、以及近人所擬議、一一列舉而評論之、如下、（一）焚毁、此法取快一時、雖有激起一般人注意的效力、然於經濟上損失最大、萬不可行、（二）公賣、在抵制初期、將宣告抵制以前的存貨、依相當手續、用此方法、本亦未嘗不可、所慮者、此端一開、奸商儘可於宣告抵制以後、私進混充、遂開舞弊之門、直等於自己取消抵制、故此法必須十分愼重、且旣宣告抵制、當然勸人勿買勿用、而於公賣時、乃又准買准用、自相矛盾、如何說得去、（三）向外國銷賣、此法當然妥當、但貨品各有銷路、彼此不同、此法究有多少可能性、尙待研究、（四）由慈善機關收買而給予災民、此法雖可使一般人視日貨爲災民所服用、不認爲珍貴品、但貨品是否合災民所需用、慈善機關有無相當購買能力、此法究有多少可能性、亦是問題、（五）待抵制完了時發賣、此爲高中暇君所主張、歷次抵貨至完了時、恰予國以大批輸入補充的好機會、惟此法可以杜塞彼的來源、而商民所負之損失、亦僅抵制時期貨本的利息、（六）半年後集中公開發賣、（七）有限制的分期發賣、（八）責繳實業基金、使加重貨價而發賣、前兩法亦爲高中暇君所主張、認爲不得已時折衷辦法、後一法即爲張君來訊所主張、雖然面面顧到、但一方勸人勿買勿用、一方又准買准用、此自相矛盾之一點、仍無法解决、（九）組織押欵機關、使商人得以存貨押欵、延至抵制完了時發賣、此爲中暇君及張君來訊所共同主張、最爲圓滿、惟銀錢兩業、願否組織此機關、是否可能、亦待研究、中暇君將押欵一法、附於半年後發賣一法之後、張君主張限於夏季所進日貨、自較易辦、以上種種、所有處置方法、大約全在於此、希望主持抗日救國團體、就五六七八九各法中、斟酌采用、吾人所應絕對反對者、爲私賣與無條件的公賣、使兩月來全國同胞呼號奔走之功、壞於一旦、從此吾國併最後之武器、而破壞凈盡、此何等痛心事、願吾全國國人趕快起來、一致反對、</p>

<h3>檢閲</h3>
<p>— 默言</p>
<p>西風緊緊地向我們襲擊、秋雨油油然下在我們身上、天上密佈着灰色的陰雲、整個氣象都浸在糢糊迷漫的朝霧中、滿帶着在戰壕裏和敵人肉搏的情境、</p>
<p>這時候、是早晨七點鐘、兩百多灰色軍服的同學都齊集在大雨滂沱水積成溝的操塲上了、立在水裏、有什麽要緊、身體整個被濕透、更不足爲奇、現在、正應該鍜鍊我們的身體、造成强有力的國民呀、我們毫不懼怕、氣慨昻昻地雄糾糾的立着、立着、西風的襲擊、秋雨的毒打、早已算不了什麽一回事、爲國家、爲民族、什麽都應該忍受、現在的鍜鍊正是將來翦除倭奴的準備、我們一聲不響的默立着、等待大隊長的動員令、看這情形似、乎不久就要出征前線和倭奴殊死於沙塲的神氣、</p>
<p>演習了一翻閲兵式、便是「稍息」的時候、長官在計議着、我們小兵也借這「稍息」的時間來偷偷地私語、</p>
<p>丨丨我們已在大雨裏立了半個多鐘頭、還不見出發、究竟今天檢閲不檢閲呢　　丨丨我們整個的身子都已經被無情的秋雨摧殘了、那有不去之理、就是不檢閲、我們也要出去遊行示威的、至少、總可以給一般民心受些感動、</p>

<p>「一，二·一……」隊長在隊側鎭壓着我們的步伐、校旗號聲在前面領導我們前進、一路上男男女女的同胞們都用驚異而敬佩的目光注視着我們整個都雨濕透了的身體和齊整的步伐、我這様想着、至少、他們總有一些感動吧、</p>
<p>我們到西門公衆體育塲時、八點鐘都還没有到、除少數的辦事人外、只有幾個跟着我們隊伍後面進來的觀衆、</p>
<p>一片廣大的體育場上、滿是濘滑的廣場上開步、立正、稍息、</p>
<p>吹着冷風、淋着苦雨、餓着肚皮、立在汚泥上、身子冷得發抖、雨珠兒一點點從帽沿上滴到嘴邊、鼻樑上、我嚥着一口口冷的唾唌、心裏浮動着恐怕有不檢閲的紛慮、</p>

<h3>在酒樓上</h3>
<p>— 澄</p>
<p>「澄、英文不要讀了、佈告板上寫着英文先生事假呢、」彬一走進敎室門、就高興的喊着「萸今天請客、她專誠的差我喚你……」</p>
<p>「眞的、萸請客、在甚麽時候、」我驚喜的問着、打斷了彬的話、</p>
<p>「就在這時、他們已在校門外候你了、」彬拉着我、往外就跑、</p>
<p>「你們怎這様的粗心、私出校門、給舍監先生看見了、不是要扣分的嗎、我立刻停了步、急争的說、</p>
<p>「她在生病呢、昨晚八時睡起、到現</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>在還在被窩中、」彬說完、跑得更快了、這時我們已看見了萸和雲兩人、</p>
<p>「澄、我方才忘了通知你了、害得你跑得這様急、」萸現出温和的笑、緊握着我的手說着、</p>
<p>我們出了校門、折了兩個彎、就到了我們所要到的地方、我們大踏步的走上樓、靜悄悄的、人很少、我們揀了一間有二個中年的似外地來的婦人的隔璧一間坐下了、堂倌拿了一張紙、呌我們點菜、彬說、「不要點其麽菜、去炒幾盆麵好了、」我們都很讚成、勸萸不要點菜、但她仍堅執着問我們喜歡吃甚麽、我們不理她、她就點了五盆菜、三盆炒麵、交給堂倌了</p>
<p>我們方吃到一半、很喧閙的來了三四個學生模様的西裝少年、坐在我們間的外邊、時時探頭望我們、大談着、LoveLouer</p>
<p>雲輕聲的說、「我把門帘掛下來好嗎、不知怎的、我一見他們就要發怒」、她恰巧對着門坐的、「讓他去、我們自管自吃好了、」雲旁邊的一個說着、</p>
<p>我們一些不客氣的大嚼着、不多久、差不多都吃完了、一邊談着、一邊等着堂倌來算賬、一會、他進來了、一手拿着手巾、一手拿着一張寫滿了英文字的紙給我們說「這是那邊幾位先生給你們的、他們說你們不必付了、因爲他們把你們所應付的、已寫在他們的賬上了、」</p>
<p>萸大聲的說、「是不是四元六角三分」、「是……四元六角三、」他點着頭、殷勤的說、</p>
<p>萸在皮篋中拿出一張五元的鈔票、丢在桌子上說、「拿去、這是我們付的錢、」她氣忿忿對堂倌說後、微嘆着回頭和我們說、「回去吧、特别的滋味好的菜没吃倒吃到了些怪現象、悔氣不悔氣」、</p>
<h3>宣傳</h3>
<p>— 秋</p>
<p>「秋、學校裏要組織宣傳隊了、咱們組織一隊罷、」</p>
<p>一個上午、我正在房間寫一篇小說「從軍」、還不曾寫上兩千字、槐忽然跑進來說了這麽一句話、</p>
<p>這事情我是早就知道了的、昨天本想集一隊人到鄕下去宣傳、後來爲了另外一點重要事情、所以就没有實行了、經槐這麽一說、我才又記起了這回事、這時我只責駡自己、把這救國的工作竟置之腦後、於是、我馬上放了筆、把稿子塞進抽屜、回話他說、</p>
<p>「好的、你已經組織好了嗎、有没有到幹事會去寫過名字、要是没有弄好、我們得趕快才是、」</p>
<p>「早已組織好了、我們一小隊一共十個人、都是我們自己熟人……」接着他便把許多名字往下說了、</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>一切都預備好了、十個宣傳員也已經招集齊、於是、我們便一齊向校門出發、我們的宣傳地點是寳山、</p>
<p>到寳山去我已經非止一次、但上回我去寳山在路途上總談些關於女人的事、說密司×如何好、密司如何壞的許多無聊話、或者談些朋友們當中許多戀愛的故事、但這一回却不然了、一路談的都是此次國難大事以及國際情形、我們每個人都預料這次事件的結果、十個人的意思完全不同、十個人就有十種不同的觀察、但我們大部分時間還是談着宣傳的材料、如何才能彀使人動聽、才能喚起民衆的許多話、我們又支配過宣傳的人、排好了談話人的次序、我因爲平常不愛說話、所以就没有被排入前五名、我覺得很僥倖、但同時又覺得很漸愧、</p>
<p>在談話中我們是很容易的到了寳山了、寳山城裏依然和以前一様的寂靜、不同的是在牆上和電桿上多了許多抗日的標語、</p>
<p>我們的計劃是打算在茶店裏作宣傳的地點、預料茶店一定有着有閒的小百姓在喝茶、然而、事實竟使我们失望了、我們走過了二個茶店都只有兩三個人冷清清的坐着、在街道上、依然是不像縣城一様的寂寞、</p>
<p>於是、我們便只好一言不發地回來、幾個長於宣傳的朋友這時的失望、我們是可以想像的了、</p>

<h3>Defeat of the Japanese Pursuit Team at Tsitsikhar Area</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Personally Leads Troops in Fierce Battle with Chinese Army</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Tianjin Aiding Plainclothes Thugs to Create Disturbances Again Yesterday</p>
<p>League of Nations Receives Japanese Note, Situation Increasingly Perilous</p>
<p>Fourth Plenary Session Orders Chiang Kai-shek to Go North and Recover Lost Territory</p>
<h3>Ambush of Japanese Cavalry at Linjia Village</h3>
<p>More than 70 Japanese Soldiers Killed by Our Army</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Currently Underway in the Taian Town Area</p>
<p>(Harbin) This morning at 4:00 AM, over a thousand Japanese cavalry pursued the Heilongjiang Army and were ambushed and defeated at Linjia Village, suffering heavy casualties. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the evening of the 19th, Ma Zhanshan retreated to Linjia Village near Tsitsikhar and ordered the Taian Town militia and police to lay in ambush in the mountains and forests, with 500 cavalry concealed near the Xiaochezi River to await the pursuing enemy. At about 4:00 AM, the Japanese cavalry arrived, and the ambush was sprung, with a fierce attack from three directions, killing two lieutenants, one sergeant, and over 70 soldiers. The Japanese army dared not advance further and retreated. This afternoon, over 3,000 Japanese infantry and artillery troops pursued to Taian Town, engaging in fierce fighting with our forces. 500 militiamen from Baiquan have gone to reinforce. The Japanese army used heavy artillery bombardment, the sounds of which can be heard in Heihe. The northern section of the Tsitsikhar road has been occupied by the Japanese army. One regiment of Japanese cavalry is stationed at the Tsitsikhar station. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Jiang Army definitely has no connection with the Soviet Union. Supplies of provisions and ammunition are insufficient, gasoline is lacking, transportation is unreliable, and tanks, armored vehicles, and anti-aircraft artillery are especially scarce. The defeats of Han and Liang during the Sino-Russian conflict in the 18th year [of the Republic, 1929] occurred on the same day (the 17th and 18th). This is because the ground was frozen everywhere, allowing tanks and armored vehicles to move easily, making defense impossible. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Harbin telegrams, order in Buhei [Tsitsikhar] is extremely chaotic. A local maintenance committee has been established by Liu Junwei. The provincial government's radio station has been moved to Keshan. The reclamation army and Ma Zhanshan's troops are currently still engaged in battle with the Japanese army. Zhang Haipeng has not arrived in Heihe [Tsitsikhar]. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan is currently directing operations at Tarhar, 30 miles north of Tsitsikhar. The battle is still raging. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Reports that the Japanese army is pursuing the remnants of Ma Zhanshan's troops towards Keshan are viewed with suspicion in political circles, as official reports received have not mentioned the war having expanded so far. News this morning of Japanese aircraft annihilating Ma's army at Hailong is also highly doubtful. According to recent military reports, Japanese aircraft only dropped bombs at that location, scattering Ma's army but not annihilating it. Furthermore, Japan officially denies that Japanese aircraft attacked Tsitsikhar with bombs. Minister of War Minami submitted a war report at a cabinet meeting this afternoon, stating that Ma Zhanshan appears to have retreated to a location 25 miles northeast of Tsitsikhar. Minister Minami also stated that the Japanese army will withdraw from Tsitsikhar within a few days and expressed the opinion that since the Chinese Eastern Railway has not been damaged or endangered, the Soviet Union will likely not take action. According to an official report from the Ministry of War, Chinese officials are currently maintaining order in Tsitsikhar. News reports also state that the Japanese consul and Japanese residents who fled to Harbin on November 14th have returned to Tsitsikhar. The number of casualties on both sides from the battle near Nenjiang on Wednesday is still unknown. It is rumored that the battle at Sanjianfang was the most intense, with 44 Japanese soldiers killed and 55 wounded. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) No official reports have been received regarding the situation in Tsitsikhar and its outer river areas, as the field radio accompanying the army is not functioning properly, and the telegraph lines between Taonan and Nenjiang are frequently cut by bandits. However, telegraphic communication between Shenyang and Angangxi is obstructed. The headquarters of Commander Honjo claims that since the Japanese army advanced north, a large number of Chinese soldiers have gathered in Tongliao. The Third Cavalry Brigade seems to be almost entirely in that area. There are almost no Japanese soldiers in western Manchuria, so there are fears that incidents may occur. A portion of the Japanese mixed brigade from Kwangasaki has arrived here via Korea. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Heihe Military and Government Institutions</h3>
<p>(Harbin) This afternoon, the headquarters of the Japanese Second Division moved to Heihe. The Border Defense Office, Provincial Government, Finance Department, Heilongjiang Official Bank, and Industry Department are all occupied by Japanese army brigade and regimental headquarters. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) After the Japanese army occupied Heihe, merchants and civilians who had not managed to escape mostly stayed indoors. All those walking the streets all day are Japanese soldiers. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese army displayed cannons in the streets of Heihe, demonstrating to the populace. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Heilongjiang Provincial Government Moves to Keshan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to Harbin telegrams, Tsitsikhar was occupied by the Japanese army at 7:30 PM on the 19th. The provincial government has moved to Keshan. All provincial government agencies are being transferred from the Tsitsikhar road to Keshan County. Ma Zhanshan is currently reorganizing his troops and setting up defenses in the Tarhar area. Telegraph and telephone communications between Harbin and Tsitsikhar are still open. The Buhei Chinese radio station has not yet stopped operating. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Jinghui Still in Harbin</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Jinghui was originally scheduled to go to Heihe at 3:00 PM today, but he did not go at that time and will go on the 21st. However, it is also heard that Zhang is still unwilling to go. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Harbin city is still peaceful and uneventful today. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Harbin telegrams, the Japanese army, having realized its planned goal of entering Tsitsikhar, has taken the first step of forcing Heilongjiang Province to declare independence. On the 19th, they forced Zhang Jinghui to go to Heihe under the guise of maintaining order and, on the other hand, forced him to declare independence. In reality, all military and political power remains in Japanese hands. Their conspiracy is highly noteworthy. It is heard that Zhang was abducted to Heihe on the 19th. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Haipeng Sends Troops to Fiercely Attack Japanese Army in Taian</h3>
<p>(Harbin) In order to reclaim his territory of Taonan, Zhang Haipeng sent his two sons to lead troops in a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Taian. The battle was extremely intense on the evening of the 20th. 2,000 Japanese soldiers rushed back from Angangxi this afternoon to reinforce. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Encounters Critical Situation</h3>
<p>Japanese Representative Yoshizawa Sends Note to Briand</p>
<p>Insists on Direct Negotiations Before Withdrawing Troops</p>
<p>Dawes Awaits New Instructions from His Government</p>
<p>Public Meeting Postponed Yesterday</p>
<p>Briand Confers with Chinese and Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>(Paris) Japan today claimed that even if the lives and property of Japanese people are guaranteed, Japan will maintain its military occupation of Manchuria. With this statement, the League of Nations suddenly encountered the most significant crisis in its history. In its attempt to find a solution to the Manchurian situation, the League of Nations now seems to have no room for delay or leisurely consideration. It is expected that tomorrow, the critical question of whether or not to invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Charter, including all of its punitive measures, will be decided. This Japanese declaration, delivered by Yoshizawa to Briand this afternoon, caused a sudden change in the entire situation, and a peaceful resolution seems to have become hopeless. In its latest note, Japan clearly stated that it would not withdraw its troops from Manchuria until a new treaty is directly negotiated with China, reaffirming existing treaties and recognizing the five basic points proposed by Japan. Even if the lives and property of Japanese people in Manchuria seem to be guaranteed, Japan will still maintain its military occupation because it believes that the Nanjing government is a puppet of the Kuomintang, which is essentially an anti-Japanese organization, and has no power to guarantee order in the occupied territories. The Japanese government cannot accept Dr. Shi's declaration regarding respect for treaties because the Japanese government does not believe that this declaration contains the guarantees that Japan requires. The Japanese note also stated that the Japanese government cannot recognize... The battle in Heilongjiang Province is still ongoing. Briand suggests sending a neutral commission of inquiry. Plainclothes thugs again disturb public order in Tianjin yesterday. The Fourth Plenary Session discusses the issue of Japan. (See Domestic News) Foreign Minister Grandi unexpectedly leaves the United States and returns home. (See Foreign News) The Bankers Association cables Briand to preside over peace. Wang, Wu, and Zou send a telegram to Beijing expressing their diplomatic stance. (See Local News)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>...the proposal by some important members of the Executive Council that Sino-Japanese negotiations proceed concurrently with the withdrawal of Japanese troops. With this Japanese ultimatum, it is believed that the League of Nations has encountered an absolutely impossible situation. All avenues of resolution under Article 11 of the League of Nations Charter have been exhausted. The only possibility now is to consider whether anything can be done under Article 15 of the Charter. Article 15 does indeed grant the Executive Council a greater scope for action. Unfortunately, Article 15 practically involves the execution of the punitive measures stipulated in Article 16. Is the Executive Council prepared to assume this responsibility? There is doubt. If it does not, then the intervention of the Executive Council will simply be aborted. After the dramatic change in events this afternoon, the non-public meeting of the Executive Council tomorrow has been postponed to 4:00 PM, and there is no question of holding a public meeting tomorrow. After separately receiving Yoshizawa and Shi Zhaoji, Briand had planned to meet with Dawes at 6:30 PM, but Dawes was still unavailable until 7:30 PM, as he was on the phone consulting with the US government. Although the nature of Dawes' conversation on the phone is unknown, it can be inferred that he was reporting on the new developments and requesting instructions. Rumors outside suggest that the German representative Pruesse and the British representative Simon proposed Article 15 of the League of Nations Charter in Paris. Upon hearing this, Berlin issued an official denial today, stating that Germany does not wish to change its policy of absolute reserve and neutrality regarding the Manchurian issue. It is expected that tomorrow's Executive Council meeting will be the last non-public meeting. The British representative strongly advocates for a public meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Briand received Yoshizawa and Shi Zhaoji, and Dawes also met with Matsudaira and Shi Zhaoji. Therefore, Briand and Dawes will confer this morning to find a common policy. After a long discussion on the phone between Dawes and Secretary of State Stimson, a plenipotentiary representative will speak on behalf of the United States this morning. Judging from Stimson's remarks, it seems that the United States, like the League of Nations, is not necessarily prepared to change its approach of reconciliation and advice. Yesterday's Japanese declaration maintaining its military occupation of Manchuria has cleared the air. The League of Nations has encountered a straightforward situation that may be easier to resolve, but this resolution is not what Nanjing wants to hear. The Executive Council meeting this afternoon is very important, but the British representative Simon is currently not in Paris, so a decision may have to be delayed. Article 15 of the Charter, which the Chinese representative will invoke, stipulates that the League of Nations can send personnel to conduct on-site investigations of any situation. Therefore, a League of Nations commission of inquiry is almost the only opportunity for an agreed resolution. French newspapers, on the other hand, are more optimistic because of this Japanese note. Le Petit Parisien said that the Japanese delegation has made very significant progress in the past 24 hours towards a satisfactory resolution of this issue. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, Briand separately received Matsudaira and Yoshizawa, and also held long discussions with Shi Zhaoji and Dawes. The attitudes of both countries involved have become clear. It is generally hoped that a public meeting can be held after the Executive Council receives Briand's report. Simon has now returned to London and has been replaced by Sir Cecil. Sir Cecil had requested a public meeting, but Briand advised him to wait, saying that a public meeting should be held only after everything is completely clear. Private conversations this afternoon may make everything clear. Sir Cecil, who is known for his directness and shocking statements, said that he would demand to speak at the next public meeting and that, at this time, since the League of Nations covenant is not being respected, everyone should be responsible for doing their job, and the Executive Council should also have a clear attitude. Sir Cecil echoed Simon's approach, saying that the Executive Council has two paths to follow: to adopt a policy of appeasement to avoid change, in which case the authority of the Executive Council will gradually be lost; or to be brave and resolute and not be afraid of failure, even though failure is inevitable. He weighed the importance of the two paths and preferred to follow the second one. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>US Democratic Senator Suggests Economic Blockade Against Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) US Senator Walsh issued an opinion here today suggesting that an economic blockade against Japan is the appropriate way to handle the Manchurian incident, believing that the current fighting in Heilongjiang Province will soon escalate into a real war. Once China and Japan declare war, the Japanese navy will inevitably blockade Chinese seaports, which will interfere with American commerce. Therefore, rather than allowing the war to develop in the future, it is better for the United States to take stern action now to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Walsh is a Democrat and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he often fiercely criticizes the government. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Dawes Expresses Unwillingness to Attend the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Paris) When Dawes returned to his hotel, he declared to reporters from American newspapers: "My mission is to cooperate with representatives of all countries in order to resolve the Manchurian dispute. The United States is a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and has also signed the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. It deeply hopes that the noble goals stated in these treaties can be achieved. Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, it also hopes that it can be resolved according to the principles established in the above-mentioned treaties. The current methods of debate and mediation by the Executive Council are ways to resolve the dispute, and having an American representative present will indeed contribute to the mission of the Executive Council. The United States is not a member of the League of Nations, and its participation in discussions related to the implementation of the Covenant would be unfair and could embarrass the Executive Council. Although the League of Nations wants to restore peace to Manchuria, the United States expresses its extreme sympathy for all its efforts. In short, the United States must retain its freedom to judge the right and wrong of this case." (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Japan does not object to the attendance of the League of Nations Executive Council in Paris by US Ambassador to Great Britain Dawes, but reserves the right to raise legal questions regarding the participation of US representatives in the Executive Council in the future. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Raises Serious Questions to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Paris) Dr. Shi himself has raised five questions, asking the League of Nations Executive Council to answer: (1) Does the League of Nations Charter have any effective power? Should the League of Nations not invoke Articles 15 and 16 of the Charter to effectively curb Japanese actions? (2) Is the Kellogg-Briand Pact effective? Should Japan be allowed to use force to carry out its policy of aggression? (3) Is the Nine-Power Treaty effective? Should joint action not be taken to remedy the situation? (4) Should Japan be allowed to abuse the Japanese concession in Tianjin, using it as a base for activities that endanger Chinese security? (5) Is Japan's seizure of salt taxes not an act of directly undermining the Chinese government's financial system? (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Calling Aggression Self-Defense</h3>
<p>Debuchi Informs the US State Department</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Japanese Ambassador Debuchi visited Stimson and guaranteed that the Japanese army would retreat from Tsitsikhar after the Heilongjiang army under Ma Zhanshan had been completely defeated, but if unexpected events occur, it may be necessary to extend the period of occupation. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador Debuchi informed the State Department yesterday that the Japanese army would withdraw from Tsitsikhar after Ma Zhanshan's troops were completely defeated. It is heard that the staff of the State Department looked apprehensive upon receiving this notification. Debuchi also said that this event was regrettable, but the Japanese army's attack was an act of self-defense. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Borah stated publicly that he was convinced that Japan wanted to control Manchuria. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>US to Discuss the Northeast Incident</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, US Secretary of State Stimson, Under Secretary of State Castle, and Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division Hornbeck discussed the Northeast incident for a long time. The three men could hardly conceal their anxiety about the situation in the Far East. Afterwards, when someone asked Stimson about Briand's suggestion that the United States decisively invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact to effectively resolve the Sino-Japanese problem, Stimson was unwilling to answer. However, people in the State Department said that it was not yet entirely impossible to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact at this time, because there had not yet been any complaints of Japan or China violating the Pact. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Measures Taken by Our Government After the Fall of Heihe</h3>
<p>Requesting the League of Nations for Emergency Action</p>
<p>Presenting a Serious Note to Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) With the Japanese army occupying the capital of Heilongjiang Province and other places while the Executive Yuan was in session, it is heard that our government has requested the League of Nations for emergency action and, at the same time, has presented a serious note to the Japanese government. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Special Foreign Affairs Committee stated that news of the violent Japanese army's large-scale invasion of Heilongjiang and the fall of Tsitsikhar has been confirmed by official telegrams. General Ma Zhanshan led his troops to retreat to a place thirty miles north of Longhe, awaiting reinforcements and launching a counterattack. The Committee convened a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 7:00 AM this morning and resolved to immediately send a telegram to Representative Shi in Paris, reporting to the League of Nations and filing an emergency protest. The Committee also had a thorough discussion on how our country should respond to the violent and barbarous measures of Japan. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Continue to Extract Salt Surplus</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Changzhou telegram: The local maintenance committee and administrative council are dominated and controlled by the Japanese. In the future, the salt surplus will continue to be extracted by the local maintenance committee. The local maintenance committee has begun to withdraw funds from various institutions, and no bank or firm dares to resist. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Determined to Recover Lost Territory</h3>
<p>Since the violent Japanese launched an undeclared war with military force on September 18th, we have long known that the Japanese are determined to occupy our Northeast for a long time in order to fulfill their great desires. At the same time, we have long known that relying on others for help will not be able to resist the continued expansion of the Japanese army's brutality. Now, this is indeed the case. The attack on Jinzhou, the instigation of unrest in Tianjin, the occupation of Tsitsikhar, and the League of Nations' perfunctory procrastination and the Japanese's stubborn sophistry are all sufficient to prove that the situation has reached the most serious point. Our country and nation have reached the final moment when they can no longer tolerate or wait.</p>
<p>Faced with this most serious situation and final moment, how should our government make decisive decisions? The people already have the same will and urgent appeals. It should use effective means to remedy the failure of international public justice to offer advice and to defend the legitimate rights of our nation's survival. It should resolutely rise up, expel the violent army occupying our territory, and recover our fallen land. This is the duty of the soldiers bearing the heavy responsibility of defending the country and the public opinion of all our people who speak with one voice.</p>
<p>In the September 18th incident, our soldiers in armor and holding weapons actually retreated without resistance, allowing the violent army to rush in and charge straight as if entering an uninhabited land. This cowardly and timid abandonment of responsibility is a great shame to our soldiers and has plunged the spirit of our ancient nation into darkness. The reason why Ma Zhanshan, the chairman of Heilongjiang Province, has won the admiration and love of all our people today, and is even highly respected by women and children, is simply because he was able to fulfill his duty of defending the country and its territory. What the people hope from our government and our soldiers today is simply to fulfill their duty. Fulfilling their duty makes them the people's government and the people's armed forces, which will be admired and loved by the people.</p>
<p>According to Chairman Chiang's speech at the Fourth Plenary Session a few days ago, he has the determination to go north to recover lost territory. Yesterday, the congress formally passed a resolution instructing Chairman Chiang to immediately go north to recover lost territory. All the people of the country, hearing this tragic speech and decisive resolution, cannot but rise up and prepare to sacrifice everything to be the support of our government. At the same time, they cannot but deeply sympathize with our government's final decision today to save our nation's life from imminent danger.</p>
<p>We dare to assert that in today's world where public justice is not manifest and justice is declining, there is no hope of survival for a country that relies on others. Only self-reliance can lead to help from others, and only self-reliance can save oneself. The observance of treaties and the call for peace have been exhausted, but the Japanese army's brutality has only increased. Treaties are ineffective, and public justice is buried. At this time, if we do not resolutely rise up to make effective resistance with rigorous measures, but instead sit idly by as the Japanese occupy half of our Northeast, developing their imperialist ambitions, advancing their continental policy, and endangering the peace of all mankind, then not only will the demise of our nation be imminent, but also the condoning of violence, the lack of sanctions, and the bequeathing of endless trouble to all mankind will make us criminals to all mankind. Therefore, we express our support with unlimited enthusiasm for Chairman Chiang's declaration of his determination to go north to recover lost territory and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session. We hope for immediate implementation. The fate of the country is in danger, and the opportunity for survival depends on this one action. All the people of the country should immediately prepare, charging towards the battlefield with the hot blood of men, and engaging in a deadly hand-to-hand combat with violence, holding up public justice.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Agrees to League of Nations Sending an Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Claims This is an Important Concession by Japan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Government officials today denied the news that Japan required China to acknowledge five basic points before agreeing to send personnel to Manchuria for investigation, saying that Japan has unconditionally agreed to the dispatch of the investigation team. This is an important concession by Japan. The solution originally proposed by Japan had two aspects: the League of Nations should send an investigation team, and China should begin direct negotiations based on five points. Later, Japan realized that China could not agree, so it abandoned the second suggestion. However, although Japan can support sending personnel for investigation before China acknowledges the five points, Japan has not given up its intention to have China ultimately acknowledge these five points. The Japanese government insists that Japanese representatives must be included in the investigation team, and does not object to the inclusion of Chinese representatives. It also insists that the scope of the investigation should include investigating anti-Japanese movements, China's ability to guarantee life and property, and China's failure to respect treaties. As for the investigation in Manchuria, it should focus on the question of how reasonable the opinions on Japan's troop withdrawal are. Japanese officials also claimed that Japan only wants to establish lasting peace and order in Manchuria, which is in line with Chen Youren's policy. Chen firmly advocates the elimination of militarism in Manchuria and the expulsion of warlords. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Briand recently proposed to the Council of the League of Nations and the Japanese delegation a suggestion to send a neutral committee to investigate the situation in Manchuria and the extent to which China can do its best to protect the safety of foreigners and respect treaties. Fang Ze has telegraphed Tokyo tonight for instructions and is awaiting orders. This suggestion has not yet been delivered to the Chinese delegation. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador Fang Ze on the 19th evening to acknowledge the League of Nations' dispatch of investigators. Regarding the composition of the investigation team, it is rumored that in addition to the four permanent council members (Britain, France, Germany, and Italy), the United States, China, and Japan will also join. As for the investigation methods, they will be assigned separately, with military affairs attributed to France, treaties to Britain, and economic relations to the United States. (Japan United News Agency dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news from this morning's Daily Telegraph, the result of recent talks in Paris by League of Nations representatives is the complete agreement of France, the United States, Britain, and Germany that considering economic or military sanctions against Japan on the Manchurian issue is absurd. Therefore, the League of Nations' consideration will clearly not proceed with the flawed draft resolution considered in October, but will lean towards urging China and Japan to begin direct negotiations as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) There is slightly more optimism here this afternoon because Fang Ze has received instructions from Tokyo and there is a turning point in the issue of sending personnel to Manchuria for investigation. The Japanese government is earnestly preparing to agree to the League of Nations sending personnel for investigation, but China must first acknowledge the five basic points. Japan is making this concession, but it is not giving up the five points. However, the issue of acknowledging the five points is now postponed. This intention will be delivered to Briand before the administrative meeting this afternoon. It is heard that the Japanese now have a proposal to support the abolition of militarism in Manchuria, which has attracted much attention. Several Japanese documents were received this morning, in which the Japanese defended their occupation of Qiqihar, promising to withdraw their troops after the purpose of the advance has been fully achieved. Japanese troops can withdraw to Taonan or Zhengjiatun. If the Chinese do not use the Chinese Eastern Railway for strategic purposes, the Japanese army can strictly respect the Chinese Eastern Railway. There is also a piece denying that the Japanese participated in Puyi's restoration movement. It is said that Puyi escaped from Tianjin during the riots, and the Japanese authorities initially knew nothing about it. The Japanese also released statistics on banditry in Manchuria from September 18 to November 15, totaling 964 cases. (National Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Japanese Embassy here stated that the Japanese government has sent a document to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accepting the League of Nations' proposal to send a committee to investigate the three northeastern provinces, and is willing to wait until the League of Nations committee has read the investigation report. However, observers of the League of Nations situation today are deeply concerned that Japan's declaration of withdrawing its request may be a month late and may still not help resolve the Manchurian incident, fearing that China will not agree to send a League of Nations investigation committee before the troop withdrawal. As for the number of committee members after China accepts this proposal, it is heard that the Council plans to send six people, one each from the United States, France, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, and South America. It is planned to invite General Pershing from the United States, and one of Petain and Weygand from France. The temporary withdrawal of the requirement that China must acknowledge the five basic principles, Briand invited senior League of Nations officials to discuss the Japanese letter at 9:30 this morning. Later, reporters inquired with people in the League of Nations, but they were unwilling to comment on Japan's new contribution, only saying that it is now necessary to persuade the Chinese government to accept the plan to send personnel for investigation before the Japanese army withdraws its troops. The Council's discussion will also still focus on China's demand for troop withdrawal. This time, Japan did not explicitly stipulate a date for troop withdrawal, but hoped to withdraw troops as soon as possible when the situation allows. This afternoon, Briand invited Fang Ze to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet, but Fang Ze did not go and sent a phone call to Briand to express his apologies for the delay.

<h3>Japan Warns Russia, Soviet Russia Drafts Reply</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to news from Riga, the Russian government has decided not to respond to Japan's friendly warning. Japan said that if Soviet Russia</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>advances troops into northern Manchuria, it will cause a tense situation. However, the Russian government believes that the talks between the Russian Foreign Minister and the Japanese Ambassador to Russia are sufficient to prove the neutrality of Soviet Russia. This statement has not yet been officially confirmed. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Japanese Ambassador Hirota today delivered to the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee the Japanese government's reply to the Russian government's warning on the 14th. The main content is as follows: (1) This military action of ours does not harm the Chinese Eastern Railway. If your country does not allow Ma Zhanshan's army to use the Chinese Eastern Railway in the future, our army will never endanger the railway. (2) If the Russian government sends troops into Chinese territory in the name of protecting the Chinese Eastern Railway, unexpected disputes may arise in the future. (National News Agency dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news from Riga, citizen congresses are now being arranged in various industrial zones of Soviet Russia to protest Japan's policy in Manchuria. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Russian officials are very indignant at Japan's reply, believing that Japan's cold reply, saying that if any accidents occur, China and the Chinese authorities will be responsible, is tantamount to a challenge to the Soviet Union. It is heard that Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov, after discussing with the Communist Party and government leaders, will draft a stern reply to be delivered to Japanese Ambassador Hirota within this week. It is said that the content will focus on the fact that China and Russia have not yet restored diplomatic relations, and Russia cannot negotiate with China on this point. It will also remind Japan that Soviet Russia has twice declared complete neutrality, and there is no need to make another statement at this time. In addition, the fact that the Japanese government published the reply before it was delivered to the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee, which is a loss of international etiquette, will also be a special focus. It is heard that the Russian government has instructed the ambassador to Japan, who is on leave returning home, to rush back to his post. (National Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A certain member of the Chinese delegation told the Associated Press this morning that Japan has already regarded the Nine-Power Treaty as a mere scrap of paper and has also sent a note to Moscow, warning the Soviet Union not to protect its own borders. This action is tantamount to directly telling the United States to leave the Pacific. (National News Agency dispatch of the 20th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents in the Yuguan and Qinhuangdao Areas Deliberately Show Panic</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan, Japanese people have recently worn dozens of sets of Chinese clothes, and Japanese soldiers armed patrols are frequent. It is suspected that their intention is because Japan will not withdraw its troops on the 16th, and they are deeply afraid that the Chinese side will cause resentment and take action, so they are making this tasteless disturbance. Our authorities have verbally notified Japan that before Sino-Japanese relations have completely broken down, Chinese authorities will resolutely protect Japanese residents and hope they will not be alarmed. However, it is not yet known whether the Japanese have other intentions. The authorities have ordered strict precautions. (Special Telegram of the 20th)</p>

Vice Chief of Staff Ninomiya will arrive in Shenyang within the day to handle the military affairs of the attack on Jiang. The Suzuki Composite Brigade landed in Busan and passed through Andong to the northeast. The increase of a division of troops in the Kwantung Leased Territory will be realized. The Japanese troops in Shenyang are consolidating their forces, and the military defenses of the Jiliu River are becoming increasingly tight. They are also contacting and buying off bandits. The lifeline of the Northeast is almost completely lost. (Special Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Near the Jiliu River, the Japanese are hiring Chinese people, carrying them to Shenyang to work every morning, and ordering the workers to change into military uniforms in the evening and carry them back to their original places, in order to show the large number of Japanese troops coming to China.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Tianjin Assist Rioters in Causing Disturbances Again</h3>
<p>Sudden Gunfire Broke Out Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Whole City Immediately Imposed Special Martial Law</p>
<p>Security Teams Deployed to Search and Suppress</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Opened Fire with Machine Guns to Disrupt</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 2:00 p.m. on the 19th, Japanese Vice Consul Tajiri, accompanied by Japanese military staff officer Yamabu, went to the Public Security Bureau, requesting to inspect the defense situation beyond 300 meters again. The bureau sent personnel to lead the inspection for a week. Their intentions were not good and were suspicious. As dusk fell, rumors became rampant. Some said that plainclothes teams would riot at night, and some said that two Japanese ships had already sailed from Tanggu to Tianjin. The municipal government urgently telegraphed Tanggu for inquiry and received a negative reply. Thereupon, it ordered the city police to arm themselves and be on alert. After 8:00 p.m., several Japanese soldiers invaded Chinese territory, appearing and disappearing in the southern city area, spying on our defense line and provoking us by firing shots. Our side did not return fire. We blocked the southeast corner of the city and the dismantled defense objects in the southern city. After 10:00 p.m., Japanese armored vehicles came to the southeast corner of the city to demonstrate. The night passed peacefully. On the morning of the 20th, our side dismantled the defense objects in the southeast corner of the city and the southern city again. Unexpectedly, at 11:30 a.m., distant gunfire broke out. The citizens heard the sound and fled in panic. The whole city immediately imposed special martial law. All trams were stopped, and the Jin'gang Bridge was ordered to be pulled open. It was later learned that 40 to 50 plainclothes teams were found in the area of Guang Kai White Bone Pagoda in the southwest corner of the city. The 16th and 19th squadrons of the Security Team were sent to suppress them. During the fierce fighting, Japanese soldiers fired several rows of machine guns from the direction of the Hai Guang Temple to disrupt the situation. Citizens in the French Concession also panicked upon hearing the sound. French soldiers rushed to the outside of the Qiang Zi River to be on guard. By 1:30 p.m., the plainclothes teams were unable to resist. Seven were captured, and the rest scattered. At 2:00 p.m., traffic was restored. At 3:00 p.m., one person was shot and beheaded in front of the Provincial Government and the head displayed to the public. After 4:00 p.m., the road was cut off to pedestrians. (Special Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At noon on the 20th, a plainclothes team fired a shot outside the gate of the 7th Detachment of the Security Team stationed in the southeast corner, shattering the glass window but not injuring anyone. During the fierce fighting between the Security Team and the plainclothes team in the White Bone Pagoda area, a stray bullet killed a passerby and injured a rickshaw puller, Zhang Wenzong, whose left leg bone was shattered. After 6:00 p.m., there was intermittent gunfire in the Hai Guang Temple area again. (Special Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<h3>Rioters Beheaded in Ping</h3>
<p>Li and Ma, Two Major Criminals, to Be Escorted to Ping Soon</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two rioters were beheaded and their heads displayed to the public in Tianjin today. The Garrison Command's notice stated that the Public Security Bureau had successively sent to the command two spies, Tian Yugang, and arsonist Han Tingyun. After interrogation, Tian Yugang confessed to acting as a spy for the plainclothes team, spying on military intelligence, and plotting a riot. Han Tingyun confessed to setting fire in Tianjin on the night of the 13th of this month, clapping his hands as a signal to start the riot, etc., without denying anything. Ma Longzhang, the fake deputy commander of the rioting plainclothes team in Tianjin, was escorted to Ping last night at 1:00 a.m. and handed over to the Military Law Office of the Deputy Commander's Headquarters for interrogation. Li Dasen, the fake commander of the plainclothes team captured in Tianjin, will also be escorted to Ping for interrogation today or tomorrow. (Special Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Dasen, the commander of the plainclothes team captured in the French Concession on the 19th, has been extradited to the Public Security Bureau. It was originally scheduled to be escorted to Ping together with the fake deputy commander Ma Longzhang on the afternoon of the 20th, but due to the riot of the plainclothes team, it was changed to the 21st to be escorted to Ping.

<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram: Puyi arrived in Shenyang from Dalian on the 16th with a group of more than 30 people, including Jin Liang, Zheng Xiaoxu, and other restorationists, as well as a dozen or so defeated division commanders. Most of them stayed at the Wang residence on Siwei Road, secretly discussing the process. Puyi requested two points: (1) To obtain the support of various countries; (2) Not to become the second Korea. Although the Dragon Flag has been prepared, it is still difficult to realize it for the time being. Puwei went to Dalian on the 15th. Puyi's guards are being organized and trained in the Dongda Camp and Beida Camp in Shenyang. Doihara is still in Dalian. (Special Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Japanese news, the organization of independent states in Manchuria and Mongolia has been unanimously decided by Yuan Jinkai, Yu Chonghan, Kan Zhaoxi, and others. Regarding the system issue, recently, the advocacy of adopting democracy is quite strong. However, for an independent state, it is necessary to have the approval of the Manchus, who account for the largest population in the Northeast, and to be able to absorb Mongolia, so that there is hope of forming a new situation. In order to meet these conditions, it is generally believed that Puyi is more suitable. However, Puyi's ascension to the throne is not a restoration, but the establishment of a new regime based on local autonomous organizations. Puyi's title may be president or other similar title, which has not yet been determined. At the moment, autonomous organizations are being formed everywhere, and the autonomous organizations will petition to form a new country. Then, the autonomous organizations will elect representatives to convene a national conference to formulate a constitution and elect Puyi as the head of the new country. The cabinet will be elected from the members of the Local Committee, and several people around Puyi will also participate. If this statement is true, then the issue of the Northeast independent state centered on Puyi will change from an empire to a republic. (Special Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Public Opinion in Various Countries</h3>
<p>London The Manchester Guardian published an editorial attacking Japan's current Manchurian policy. It said, "The League of Nations is meeting in Paris, but on the surface, it has not achieved any results. At this time, the Japanese army has defeated General Ma's troops. What is strange is that the World War has just ended, and Japan is striving to establish a protectorate in Manchuria, laying a fuse for future wars. How can the League of Nations tolerate this? The Chinese government has proposed that once the Japanese army withdraws, the Sino-Japanese dispute will be submitted to arbitration or direct negotiations with Japan. However, Japan has disregarded this and occupied strategically important locations until it can be confident that its so-called legitimate rights are respected. Those who take Japan's side should consider whether Japan must occupy Manchuria before holding negotiations or submitting to arbitration, implying that unless coercive methods are used, Japan's interpretation of treaty rights will not be recognized by China or approved by the international court. If the League of Nations approves of this kind of action, the impact will be that any small country that wants to protect its own rights must not rely on the League of Nations and should adopt the old method of forming alliances with large countries. How can this be?" (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The current situation is still attracting attention from the press. Most</p>
<p>criticize the League of Nations. The French newspaper "Liberté" said that the League of Nations' persuasion was ineffective and Japan has obviously won. The Administrative Council is not prepared to adopt an oppressive plan, and can only succumb to the accomplished facts. The "Paris Times" and "Débats" still advocate sending a League of Nations committee to Manchuria to investigate and guarantee Japan's treaty rights, as a way to solve the difficult problem. The opinion of the responsible parties in France is probably similar to this. The "Times" pointed out that this is the only way out that has not yet been closed, believing that the League of Nations committee should monitor the restoration of order in Manchuria, and the Japanese army should give up the occupied areas when the situation permits. The German "Algemeine Zeitung" commented on the Japanese army's capture of Qiqihar, saying that Japan has conquered the three northeastern provinces, and declared to the world that war can be waged without worrying about the League of Nations. The League of Nations is timid, pretending that there is no war between China and Japan. The League of Nations shares the responsibility for China's loss of the three northeastern provinces.

<h3>Russian Newspaper Comments on Japanese Army's Occupation of Heihe</h3>
<p>Suspects Japan and France Have Concluded a Secret Alliance</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Russian newspapers commented on the fall of Qiqihar, and there are renewed claims that France is secretly assisting Japan. It is believed that according to news from the border of the three northeastern provinces, the Japanese army has made preparations to spend the winter in Heihe. If Japan did not receive the assistance of at least one major country, it would not have such a tyrannical attitude. The "Pravda" even said that Japan's current policy is sufficient to indirectly confirm the claim of a secret Japanese-French alliance, because France obviously hopes that Japan will win completely and turn the three northeastern provinces into a base for imperialist policy, so it indirectly helps its success.

<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth Plenary Session passed a resolution urging Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government to go north to recover lost territory. It is reported that Chiang plans to depart within a week or so, first to Kaifeng and Jinan, then to Beiping. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The delegates of the Fourth Plenary Session, recognizing that Japan’s armed invasion of our Eastern Provinces is related to the life and death of the nation, organized a Special Committee on Japanese Affairs during the first assembly to discuss response strategies. After several meetings, a general consensus was reached. During the sixth assembly on the 20th, the committee specially appointed Dai Chuanxian to report to the assembly, and two draft resolutions were formulated, which were unanimously passed by the assembly. The report's original text and resolutions are recorded below: Since Japan’s armed occupation of our country’s Three Eastern Provinces territory, the League of Nations has twice resolved that Japan withdraw its troops within a time limit under the observation of neutral country representatives. The Chinese government has fully fulfilled the obligations assigned by the resolutions. Japan not only disregards international public opinion, but also increasingly engages in conspiracies and violence. On one hand, it instigates various rebellious movements. On the other hand, it continues to advance north with armed forces, expanding the area of its occupation. This has forced a small number of Chinese troops in Heilongjiang Province to engage in legitimate defense. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. During the reconvening of the League of Nations, Japan further occupied Qiqihar by force, and the occupied area has been further expanded. The authority of international institutions to guarantee justice is in danger of succumbing to Japanese power. All international agreements on which countries around the world rely to maintain peaceful survival are about to fall into ruin. In order to protect the survival of the nation and international justice and world peace, this assembly solemnly makes the following resolutions: 1. Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government of China, in the legitimate defense against the Japanese army’s offensive, is not only protecting the territory of China but is also protecting the existence of international justice and world peace. That is, he is sacrificing to uphold the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and all international agreements. This assembly solemnly calls upon the member states of the League of Nations and the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty to pay true attention to the sacred obligations they bear. 2. This assembly believes that the policies and measures taken by the National Government, both internally and externally, since the Japanese invasion of the Three Eastern Provinces have been truly loyal to the country and the nation. It now solemnly resolves that this assembly shall grant the National Government full authority to take all necessary and legitimate self-defense measures regarding the defense of national sovereignty and protection of territorial integrity. It hopes the National Government will continue to strive for the preservation of national survival and world peace with greater dedication. This assembly is willing to lead all party comrades and unite the people of the entire country with a well-organized and disciplined spirit, working together with the government to make active efforts, and sparing no sacrifice, to be the government’s support in spirit and in material resources. This assembly further appeals with utmost sincerity to the people of the entire nation that our country’s struggle is not isolated. All countries in the world that uphold justice and peace sympathize with our country. Even the people within Japan who advocate fairness cannot but regard the policies pursued by their warlords as harmful to others and to themselves. If the people of our entire nation maintain their unity, consistently resolve to protect the survival of the nation and international justice and world peace, trust the government, and strive to struggle, then final victory will ultimately be ours.

<p>Telegram from the Guangzhou Extraordinary Conference: Addressed to all provincial and municipal party headquarters, and forwarded to all levels of party headquarters, newspaper offices, and organizations: Our Party is a group for revolutionary national salvation. For forty years, it has led the people in implementing the Three Principles of the People, seeking to overthrow imperialist aggression externally and eliminate the accumulated evils of warlord dictatorship internally. The greatest goal is to establish a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, to promote the Great Harmony of the world. This is known to all. In recent years, inheriting the legacy of the Leader, we vowed to launch the Northern Expedition, complete unification, and hoped to implement political tutelage to gradually transition to constitutional governance, so that the great cause of national construction could be achieved early. However, with the rapid development of military affairs, the development of democratic forces has failed to keep pace. As a result, party affairs have been plagued by endless disputes, politics have been dominated by increasingly severe dictatorship, construction has not been seen, internal wars have been frequent, coupled with the latent growth of communist bandits, disasters have repeatedly struck, and the people have been plunged into ever-deepening and hotter water. This is what causes our Party comrades to have their hearts and livers torn apart and feel boundless grief. Because of the threat of dictatorship, internal affairs have not been rectified and foreign insults have surged. Recently, there has been a major upheaval in the East Province due to the wanton actions of a powerful neighbor, with the loss of territorial sovereignty unrecovered and national crisis is profound. Destruction is imminent. Our Party comrades believe that they have an unshirkable responsibility and must save themselves. In the past, comrades eliminated the communist scourge, overthrew the dictatorship, and established an Extraordinary Conference. For half a year, they have struggled with peaceful efforts to save the Party and the country from imminent collapse. Their lonely endeavors and painstaking efforts are witnessed by the world. Today, the national crisis is in full swing. All Party comrades already know that without renewed unity, there will be no way to complete the revolutionary cause and navigate the great disaster in the coming days. Therefore, peace talks are underway to jointly discuss the aftermath, seeking unification in diplomacy, revival in party affairs, and thorough reform in politics and military affairs. Fortunately, in the past month, bearing the expectations of the people and the understanding of comrades, a path to resolving disputes has been found. The Fourth National Congress will be used as a common and unified resolution to end the fragmented remnants of the past and jointly seek solutions to the current national crisis. All our comrades, if they are sincere to the Party, will impeach and punish themselves and sacrifice their prejudices. If they are loyal to the country, they will go through fire and water without hesitation. This is truly inspired by the great spirit of the Leader, and the new life of the Party and the country will be eternally entrusted to it. From now on, with one heart and one mind, we will work together, seek construction internally, and resist powerful neighbors externally. Every moment is critical and allows for no懈怠. I urge all compatriots and Party comrades across the country to strive together. - The Extraordinary Conference of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attack Our Flank Defense Line</h3>
<p>Attacks on Tangchi and Mushroom Creek Fail</p>
<p>Over Two Hundred Enemy Soldiers Captured by Our Troops</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: On the morning of the 14th, around 5:00 AM, Japanese troops, with a squadron of cavalry artillery, outflanked from the front, bypassed Daxing, Sanjianfang, and Hongshiyingzi, and attacked the left wing of our army's third defense line. This defense line, located thirty-five li from Ang'angxi, was guarded by one battalion of the Shali Bu regiment of the First Cavalry Brigade, Wu Songshan's unit, with relatively weak forces. The Japanese army intended to take advantage of the gap to attack and break through this defense line, cutting off the communication between our army's Daxing and Sanjianfang defense lines. Our army immediately counterattacked. By around 6:00 AM, two Japanese aircraft, again providing cover for over seven hundred infantry, artillery, and cavalry troops, fiercely attacked our army's defensive positions. In addition, several heavy artillery pieces, from the direction of Hulu Creek, fired in support, with shells landing in the trenches, causing dust and smoke to rise several zhang. The Japanese army then took the opportunity to advance fiercely. The aircraft dropped bombs on our artillery positions to prevent our artillery from firing in response. The Japanese troops in the Jiangqiao area advanced towards Daxing Station, using more than ten artillery pieces to bombard our first and second defense lines, restricting our army's movements. After 7:00 AM, the position of the Third Battalion of our Fourth Cavalry Regiment, was unable to maintain its position due to the Japanese army throwing hand grenades and sweeping with hand-held machine guns. The soldiers were unable to stand in the trenches and retreated to the right wing. The Japanese army took the opportunity to rush into the trenches, using a tank to suppress our army. Our army's right wing also showed signs of wavering and was unable to consolidate its defense line. It was then supported by a mortar and flat trajectory gun company,</p>
<p>The enemy troops were slightly repulsed, but the left-wing trenches had been seized by the enemy, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Fortunately, the Tu Quansheng regiment of the Independent Eighth Cavalry Brigade, Cheng Zhiyuan's unit, arrived from Manchuria. Upon hearing of the emergency at the front, they immediately disembarked at Ang'angxi, and the entire regiment was ordered to charge thirty-five li. The soldiers bared their chests and shouted as they rushed forward, their voices resounding throughout the fields. The Japanese army was awestruck. The Sha regiment received reinforcements, and their morale was boosted. They immediately launched a fierce attack from the trenches. The Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated in panic, with many captured alive or killed by our troops. After 8:00 AM, the Japanese army retreated in defeat, and our army reorganized its defense line, jointly guarding the area by the Tu and Sha regiments. The guard regiment of Ma Zhanshan's unit was also transferred to the Mushroom Creek area, serving as a cavalry outpost. At 10:15 AM, a large Japanese force returned to attack, again attacking our flank at Tangchi and outflanking our rear. The force was increased to over two thousand men, supported by six aircraft, with cavalry, infantry, and artillery divided into left and right-wing teams, launching a large-scale encirclement of our defense line, personally commanded by Brigade Commander Changgu. The intensity of the attack was greater than in the morning, and they repeatedly used machine guns to cover their advance close to our army's trenches, but they were bravely defeated by our troops.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Repelled, and because their planes were afraid of our artillery fire, their bombing became inaccurate, so our army was not afraid. Subsequently, heavy mortars were used to bombard their densely packed formations, which was effective, and the enemy lines were scattered. At 11:40 AM, they retreated and fled again. In the two fierce battles, our soldiers did not eat or drink, nor did they consider it苦, and they all regretted not killing more enemies. The front was calm for half a day. Around 11:00 PM, the fighting started again. First, dozens of Japanese soldiers crawled into our Tangchi defense line in the dimness. They started firing artillery from a distance of one thousand meters from the trenches. At five hundred meters, the soldiers fixed bayonets, formed groups of one hundred men, and rushed towards the trenches in dozens of groups, but they were repulsed by our army's machine guns and mortars. Many enemy soldiers died. They charged again at 1:00 AM, but were still unsuccessful, so they switched to artillery fire. After 2:00 AM, suddenly a hand grenade squad of over one hundred men rushed close to where our cavalry horses were, throwing bombs violently, wanting to blow up our horses, causing them to panic and disrupt the defense line. Our cavalry could no longer endure this and bravely rushed out of the trenches, grabbing their horses and mounting them. Without waiting for the officers to give orders, they charged out in different directions. Just then, Ma Zhanshan's guard regiment arrived from Mushroom Creek. This regiment, during the fierce battle at Daxing and Sanjianfang on the 7th, lost contact and was surrounded by the enemy for a day and a night. Many soldiers died. Generally, they wanted to avenge the previous仇, bravely taking the lead in breaking the enemy's line. The Japanese infantry and artillery lost contact, unable to support each other from beginning to end, and fled in panic. Our cavalry commanders Sha Li Bu and Tu Quansheng, each leading their respective units, encircled them with their two wings. The infantry and cavalry launched a fierce attack, killing countless enemies. Most of them fled in disarray. Over two hundred men did not have time to escape and were captured by our army, disarmed. The fighting stopped after 3:00 AM, and our army was able to rest. In this battle, our army pursued the enemy twelve li, and then deployed a line of defense in that area, connecting with the first and second defense lines. As for the captured military equipment, it included two field artillery pieces, five hand-held machine guns and machine guns, over two hundred rifles, seventy战刀, and other military equipment. Chairman Ma Zhanshan ordered that a reception center be set up in the provincial capital for the captured Japanese soldiers, and that they not be mistreated. Ma himself arrived at Ang'angxi from the provincial capital at 2:00 PM today to arrange everything. During the fierce battle, Regiment Commander Sha Li Bu was hit in the left leg by a stray bullet, but it was not very serious, and he was transported to Harbin for treatment in the evening. This morning, a newly formed independent mixed cavalry regiment arrived from Suihua County, passed through Harbin, and headed to the front. This regiment was a strong force for suppressing bandits in the eastern wilderness of Heilongjiang Province. After arriving at the front, our army's strength became even greater. The Japanese consul in Heilongjiang, Shimizu Hachihyakuichi, because our army was fighting against the Japanese army, led over sixty侨民 out of the provincial capital on the evening of the 15th to avoid the fighting. Ma Zhanshan ordered the negotiators to persuade him to stay, but Shimizu did not dare to live in the provincial capital again and insisted on leaving. Ma instructed him to sign a note according to diplomatic procedures, but Shimizu evaded this by claiming that he was going to Harbin to handle personal affairs and refused to comply, so there are no Japanese in Heilongjiang at the moment. Yesterday, representatives of a certain organization in Harbin went to the front to慰劳 the troops. They personally heard soldiers say, "We are fighting for the country, and we will have no regrets even if we die in battle. We don't need people from the country to comfort us." Among the wounded soldiers was a certain adjutant who was seriously injured during the night battle on the 14th. The soldiers around him wanted to carry him back to the rear, but the adjutant shouted, "No, you hurry up and give me a shot to end it. The enemy's attack is very intense, and you must not reduce the defense force because of me." The soldiers did not listen and forcibly carried him away with four people. The adjutant shouted to stop them until he lost strength and fainted. Other officers and soldiers are fighting with the determination to die, so it is unlikely that the violent Japan will be able to take Heilongjiang Province until the Heilongjiang army runs out of ammunition and food, and it will not be as easy as occupying Liaoning and Jilin.

<h3>Japanese Warships Intrude into Fuzhou's Inner Harbor</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Issues Evacuation Certificates to Japanese Nationals</p>
<p>Fujian Provincial Government Declares Martial Law on Land and Sea</p>
<p>Fuzhou's Public Sentiment is Aroused, Situation is Tense</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the Japanese army invaded and occupied Northeast China, the Japanese government has also dispatched warships from Taiwan to station in Fuzhou and Xiamen. Sailors occasionally go ashore and parade, and the local society has felt deeply uneasy. On the 13th of this month, two more Japanese warships sailed from Taiwan to Fuzhou. One is the "Nashi," a destroyer, and the other is the "Enoshima," a shallow-water gunboat. Together with the "Yuzura", a destroyer stationed in Fujian, there are now three Japanese warships in the Min River. Their officers and soldiers take steamers from Mawei every day and bring luggage (all in wooden boxes, the contents of which are unknown) to the Taikang landing site and move it to the Japanese consulate in Cangshan. The military and police agencies are paying attention to the investigation of their bizarre whereabouts. On the morning of the 14th, the "Enoshima" shallow-water艇 suddenly wanted to enter Taikang. Upon hearing the news, the provincial government believed that Taikang belonged to Fuzhou's inner harbor. In the past, foreign warships could only sail to Mawei. The Japanese warship's action was obviously disrupting the security of the provincial capital. They immediately ordered the Min Customs Tax Office and the Postal Administration Director to stop it first and not to lead the harbor. Meanwhile, Chen Peikun, a member of the provincial government, and Chen Ming, the secretary, went to the Japanese consulate to protest to the Japanese consul, Tamura Sadaichi. The Japanese consul agreed to let the warship remain at its original location and not move for the time being. Chen then withdrew. Unexpectedly, at 3 p.m. on the 15th, the warship suddenly sailed into Taikang without any warning and berthed in front of the Fan Chuan Pu Min Customs Pier. Japanese nationals and Taiwanese living in Fuzhou were issued evacuation certificates by the consulate as proof of boarding Japanese warships and ships in case of emergency. Seeing this situation, the air suddenly became tense. In order to maintain security, the provincial government immediately issued a temporary emergency martial law order. The First Brigade of the Marine Corps was in charge of the defenses of Taiqiao South (i.e., south of Taikang), Cangqian Mountain, Fan Chuan Pu, and Guanyin Well. The 56th Division of the Army was in charge of the defenses of Qiaobei (i.e., north of Taikang), Daqiaotou, and Nanmendou. The First Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army was in charge of the defenses inside the city. Important locations were all guarded by sentries. The Taikang coast</p>
<p>The layout is particularly严森. The soldiers on guard are all实弹. Travelers going up and down the land and water must not pass without inspection. At 10:00 p.m., traffic will be cut off. That night, telegraphs were sent to Xiamen Yanping to transfer the Chu Tai warship and Liu Heding's division and Jiang Yan's brigade to the province to consolidate the provincial defenses. The Chu Tai has already arrived in Taikang on the evening of the 16th and berthed in front of the Zhongzhou Naval Public fearing, about thirty余丈 away from the Japanese艇. It is reported that Jiang's brigade was stationed in Shunchang, Jiangle, and Shaowu. A regiment can be dispatched to the province first within days. The people's sentiment in the provincial capital is extremely aroused. On the afternoon of the 16th, the anti-Japanese associations from all walks of life in the provincial capital and the anti-Japanese federations of various schools sent representatives to the provincial government to petition, requesting a serious negotiation with the Japanese consul to order the艇 to withdraw from Mawei by a certain date, and scheduled to convene a joint meeting of anti-Japanese groups on the afternoon of the 17th to discuss countermeasures.

<h3>Japanese Provocations in Hankou Continue Unabated</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Under the serious Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation, the Japanese military and civilians in Hankou are actually actively preparing for military operations, causing anxiety in the society. In recent days, it has become even more severe, which can be described in two points: First, the Japanese residents. Since the Japanese residents from Sichuan, Hunan, and Henan have concentrated in Hankou, the number of people has increased day by day, and the strength has gradually expanded. The unscrupulous people took the opportunity to provoke, which is even worse than before. They rampage through the streets, and passers-by look at them sideways. There is also the so-called "Great Federation of Residents in the Yangtze River Basin" which issued a declaration. The wording is absurd, roughly saying that the Chinese in the Yangtze River Basin are extremely hostile to the Japanese residents. They vandalize Japanese houses during the day and rape Japanese women at night. The boycott of Japanese goods has shaken the Japanese economy to its roots. The only way for the Japanese to defend themselves is to ask the Japanese government to negotiate with the Chinese government as soon as possible to ban anti-Japanese movements, and to advocate that the "Three Northeastern Provinces Incident" be directly negotiated by the Chinese and Japanese governments, without interference from third parties. This not only slanders the Chinese, but also despises the League of Nations. In addition, Sato Xiu, an economic reporter from the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, was specially dispatched to Hankou to investigate the situation in Hankou. The Hankou Nichi Nichi Shimbun, the Naval Intelligence Department, and the consulate provided materials. In addition to military preparations, they also used propaganda tactics to spread their rumors and confuse the public. The second is the Japanese military. The Navy is commanded by Commander Shiozawa, the Army is commanded by Military Attaché Morioka, and the Youth League is commanded by Chairman Ishikawa. They hold parades from time to time. It is reported that Shiozawa is planning to order all sailors from various艦艇 to land completely within days to practice various formations. Ordinary military meetings are held once a day at the Marine Corps Department, and special meetings are held on the Atake舰. The ordnance repair shop has been established for several days and is now preparing to set up a military hospital. As for the troops carrying weapons and patrolling the streets, it is even more commonplace. (November 19th)</p>
<h3>Ironclad Evidence of Japan's Violation of Treaties</h3>
<p>Regarding Japan's fabrication of facts in various countries and its malicious propaganda against China in order to deceive the world and arouse public opinion's sympathy for Japan, a certain important person of the National Government issued the following statement yesterday:</p>
<p>"It is Japan's usual practice to fabricate facts and distort the truth. Currently, the government has seized a part of incomplete diplomatic documents from Shenyang and other important northeastern towns occupied by the Japanese, and compiled the facts of Japanese aggression into a book to prove Japan's ambitions in the Northeast. Recently, Japan's anti-China propaganda in Paris, New York, and other places has achieved partial success. Now it has been launched on a large scale, even accusing China of not complying with the treaties to confuse the world, but in fact, in recent years, everyone in the Northeast has done everything possible to provoke incidents, and the blame should be borne by Japan. The following points can be seen at a glance:</p>
<p>First, the illegal stationing of Japanese troops in the East Province constitutes the greatest act of aggression. Other sporadic acts of aggression arising from the stationing of troops are too numerous to mention. Although the Japanese have repeatedly claimed that the Japanese garrison has the privilege of stationing troops along the South Manchurian Railway, in fact, the Japanese garrison's protection of the railway has no legal basis, nor is there any treaty stipulation. This can be clearly understood by looking at the Sino-Japanese Treaty signed in Beijing on December 22, 1905. According to the treaty, China only recognizes and accepts all rights that Russia allowed and granted to Japan in accordance with Article 5 and Article 6 of the Treaty of Portsmouth, and nothing else. At the same time, the records of the Washington Conference in 1922 also provide clear proof. At the China Conference, the Japanese representative could not prove that there was a treaty basis for the stationing of troops in South Manchuria, and only used Japan's stationing of troops in Manchuria as a factual need. His argument was weak and his words were exhausted, which can be imagined.</p>
<p>Two months ago, Japanese Minister of the Army Minami declared that Japan had the right to station fifteen soldiers per kilometer along the South Manchurian Railway. According to his estimation, the entire South Manchurian Railway should have a garrison of 16,500 soldiers. But in fact, excluding the troops sent by Japan after September 18, there are 14,760 soldiers in the mixed division, 5,400 soldiers in the garrison, 2,560 soldiers in the military police detachment, 52 aircraft, 1,110 pilots and soldiers, 2,500 railway police, and over 3,000 Japanese police stationed in various Japanese consulates. Therefore, excluding the police and railway police of the Japanese consulates, Japan has a large army of 23,000 stationed in the Three Northeastern Provinces to prepare for war.</p>
<p>Second, the establishment of police by various Japanese consulates is illegal. Although the Chinese side has repeatedly protested, it has had no effect. The establishment of police by the Japanese consulates is the biggest cause of Sino-Japanese conflicts. The most important Sino-Japanese dispute caused by the establishment of police was the Zhengjiatun case in 1916. The following paragraph is from a section of the Chinese government's reply to Japan's request for the establishment of police when resolving the Zhengjiatun case in 1916. The Chinese government's attitude towards this kind of Japanese aggression has not changed today, so it is still cited to illustrate the Chinese government's attitude. "Upon investigation, the second point of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration on the Zhengjiatun case, in response to the Japanese request for the dispatch of police officers, the Chinese government replied that Article of the new treaty signed on May 25, 1915 stipulates that all Japanese subjects mentioned in the treaty in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia shall obey Chinese police laws and pay taxes. The problem arising from extraterritoriality has been prepared for in advance. Although the Japanese Minister may have explicitly stated that this Japanese police will never interfere in Chinese local administration and police power, stationing Japanese police in Chinese territory will hinder the spirit and form of Chinese sovereignty, and will cause misunderstandings among the Chinese people, which will damage the friendly relations between the two countries. As for the Japanese police stations already established in Manchuria, the Chinese government and local officials have repeatedly protested. Japan has ignored the Chinese government's protests and illegally stationed police officers in Zhengjiatun (Zhengjiatun is Chinese territory, far from the railway boundary). The Chinese government sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that the actions of the Japanese police officers were the direct cause of this unfortunate conflict. The Chinese government absolutely cannot recognize the establishment of Japanese police stations in South Manchuria and protest, requesting Japan to dismantle the police stations that have already been established."</p>
<p>The Japanese side tells the outside world that China has violated the treaty and requires China to respect the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1915, but it has not considered that it has established police in the Three Northeastern Provinces without any legal basis. Third, Japan's acts of aggression in the Three Northeastern Provinces are too numerous to mention. Here are some of the more important events to reveal Japan's ambitions: (1) harming Chinese people, such as Mi Shuangying in Liaoyang being beaten by the Japanese police and then burned to death with kerosene on May 2 this year; (2) arresting and injuring our officials, such as (A) on September 23 of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Japanese soldiers harassed the Tie Ling tea garden, disobeyed our police's persuasion, injured police officers, and confiscated the police team's weapons; (B) on January 27 of the same year, the Japanese police chief surrounded the Benxi County government, kidnapped the county magistrate, and destroyed our government offices; (3) harboring traitors, such as in December of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese police harbored Koreans who were trafficking morphine and other contraband, and destroyed our Yingkou police station; in addition, there were also Japanese businessmen who did not comply with inspections and destroyed our Andong customs, etc.; (4) engaging in combat exercises in important towns or suburbs without authorization, endangering residents and damaging crops, there are dozens of cases every year; (5) violating the treaty and infringing on our military transportation, such as in the winter of the 14th year of the Republic of China, prohibiting Chinese troops from moving within 20 li along the South Manchurian Line without cause; (6) interfering in internal affairs, such as (A) illegally levying taxes along the railway line and hindering our tax rights, such as stamp tax, business tax, and firewood monopoly tax; (B) encroaching on postal and telecommunications and mining rights, such as establishing post offices along the South Manchurian Line, setting up commercial telegraphs, telephones, wireless telegraphs, and long-distance electrical supply without authorization, ignoring China's protests; (C) disrupting finance, such as the Bank of Korea issuing 124 million yuan of gold bills that cannot be cashed and have no price qualification in Japan, and the Zhengjin Bank issuing 5 million yuan of silver coin banknotes, and establishing exchanges in famous ports along the South Manchurian Line without authorization, manipulating finance, special product transactions, and condoning Japanese浪人 to cast and use counterfeit currency; (D) encroaching on land and opening ditches and building dams without authorization, hindering farmland water conservancy, there have been such acts in Shenyang and Tongliao, and the recent Wanbaoshan incident is the most prominent example; (E) destroying transportation, such as on June 27 of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Japanese armed police dismantled our Beining Railway, and in the 16th year of the Republic of China, when the Jihai Railway was built, the South Manchurian Railway refused to transport materials, and after the road was completed, it was not allowed to connect with the Jichang Road; (F) hindering municipal administration, such as when Shenyang整理市衢 in the 14th year of the Republic of China, Japanese buildings were not allowed to retreat, but instead took the opportunity to blackmail, hindering measurement and relaxation of plans.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Provincial Order from Xia Zexian to Strictly Investigate and Handle: Xia Zexian, a communist in southern Pudong, was arrested by the water police for gathering people to resist rent, etc., and sent to the Provincial Provisional Military Tribunal for interrogation. He was declared innocent and ordered to be released on bail by the county. Now, people in Jinshan County say that the suspect is a remnant of the executed gangster A Shu, and a major criminal who robbed Shen Shaoyu's family and the Fei surname girl in Zhangze Town, and a reward was offered by the bandit suppression headquarters for his arrest. They have requested that his release be postponed, and the residents Chen et al. have presented an instruction to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that Xia Zexian has been offered a reward for his arrest by the Jin Song Jia Ping Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and should be severely punished to appease the people. The county has been ordered to investigate and handle the case. Therefore, Gu Jiezhong, a merchant in Zhangze, presented a request to the county for bail, but County Magistrate Shen rejected it.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Exhumation and Bone Examination in the Taiping Bridge Murder Case: Qian Binglin, the son of Qian Jincai, the owner of a noodle shop in Taiping Bridge Town, was beaten to death by Xu Boren and his son, who opened a sesame cake shop in the same town, and the body was abandoned in the river on June 19 of this year. At that time, the father of the deceased, Jin Cai, reported that Binglin had died by drowning and requested the local court to waive the examination. When the deceased's brother Bingcheng returned home from Shanghai, he learned of the previous situation and filed a petition with the local prosecutor's office requesting a thorough investigation and exhumation. After receiving the petition, the local court arrested the Xu father and son the other day and transported the coffin to Suzhou. Yesterday (20th) morning, the coffin was exhumed in the wasteland west of the North Temple in Pingmen. However, the corpse had rotted, so the rotten flesh was shaved off, and it was decided to steam the bones for examination today, but red scars have been found on the back of the head.</p>
<p>Merchants Request Postponement of Confiscation of Japanese Goods: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Conference decided that all stores must seal up all Japanese goods before the 24th of this month, and a general inspection will be carried out on the 25th. However, merchants from various industries have registered the Japanese goods they have stored. If they are confiscated, it will affect their capital, so they have requested the Chamber of Commerce to ask the Anti-Japanese Association to postpone the implementation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>County Party Headquarters Negligently Destroyed – The county party headquarters of our county suddenly announced a fire accident at approximately 8:00 PM yesterday (the 19th). The alarm was immediately sounded, and various fire brigades arrived to extinguish the blaze. The fire burned for about an hour before it was put out. Fortunately, all the important documents of the Party Committee were in the outer office and were rescued without damage. However, it is regrettable that the fire broke out during a tense period of work and the selection of county representatives to the congress, destroying all the proposals and documents for the congress. It is said that the cause of the fire was very unusual and not due to electrical causes.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Park Hotel: A Chronicle of a Couple who Died Together – On the afternoon of the 16th, a male and female traveler arrived at the Park Hotel in the city. They claimed to be from Shanghai. The man's name was Gu Jinsheng, and the woman was named Cai. They stayed for three days, laughing and talking intimately. On the morning of the 19th, the tea server noticed that the door of their room was still closed, and the male and female guests had not yet risen. He knocked on the door and called out, but there was no response. He opened the window and climbed in to find the two people sleeping with their necks intertwined, already dead. He rushed to report to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who in turn reported to the Procuratorate of the County Court, requesting an investigation. Yesterday morning (the 20th), Prosecutor Du of the Procuratorate, accompanied by a forensic officer, arrived at the scene to conduct a formal investigation. The investigation revealed that both the man and woman had died from opium poisoning before death. However, the man, Gu Jinsheng, had deep rope marks around his neck, his eyes were closed, and his tongue protruded from his lips. His face was purple and blue, and his hands were tightly clutching a green belly band around his neck. It appeared that after the poison took effect and he was in agony, he strangled himself. After the investigation, coffins were ordered to be prepared for burial, pending identification by family members from Wuxi. The deceased had mailed a registered letter to Gu Xiutang in Songjiang at 2:00 PM on the 18th, and a regular letter, which they did not allow anyone to see. It seems the deceased was likely from Songjiang.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Robbery and Injury at the River Bridge – At approximately 10:00 PM on the night of the 18th, in Heqiao Town, Wuyi County, more than ten armed bandits suddenly arrived and robbed three grain stores in the town: Yufengsheng, Tongxinchang, and Gongshuntai.

<h3>Yixing</h3>
<p>Kidnapping and Murder Case in Yixing – On the night of the 5th of this month, several passenger boats were moored on the beach in the Puxu Marsh of the Northwest Bridge Lane Market in Yixing. The residents mistook them for merchant ships and were not suspicious. Unexpectedly, at around 7:00 PM that night, bandits broke into the home of Xu Zhennan, a resident of Puhan Village, by destroying a wall. They brandished guns to intimidate and plunder at will, causing significant losses. Before leaving, they kidnapped a nephew and demanded a ransom of 16,000 silver dollars. Moreover, at the home of Gao Changyun, a resident of Yinju Village along the Shou River, 18 miles from Yangxiang Town, a bandit boat suddenly docked at the shore at 8:00 PM on the night of the 10th of this month. Upon hearing the sound of iron spears, people inside immediately fled and ran to the village to call for help. The bandits blocked the gate and fired into the house with box cannons. Gao Changyun's third son resisted with a hoe, but was shot in the abdomen and died on the spot. Another person was injured and is currently receiving treatment, but his life is not in danger.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Yin Derong's Home Robbed and Burned by Bandits – Yin Derong, a farmer in Shajiabin, Guoxigowan, in the southwest of this city, was a modestly wealthy man. Several days ago, several bandits armed with guns and weapons stormed into his home and robbed him of his clothes and cash. Unsatisfied, the bandits sent a letter the next day demanding a large sum of money. Yin ignored it because he had no money. Unexpectedly, at around midnight on the 17th, thirty to forty bandits, each carrying guns and weapons and carrying flammable materials, suddenly arrived in the village and set fire to it. As a result, Yin Derong's home and five neighboring homes were burned, destroying more than twenty rooms. Yin Derong and his family were alerted and fled to the back, fortunately avoiding being kidnapped. It is said that Yin's losses amounted to about ten thousand silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Public Continues to Oppose Salmon – On the afternoon of the 17th, a patriotic worker, He Shichang, posted slogans near the salmon sales points set up by the Tongfuchang and Hengtai fish shops in Tianhou Temple in the city, urging people not to buy Japanese fish. Zhou Yongzhao, the manager of Tongfuchang, instigated his associates to beat He Shichang. Now, it is learned that patriotic citizens, fearing that Tongfuchang would continue to sell salmon, gathered at the sales point yesterday morning to monitor. The director of the sales point, Xiang Lianseng, arrived arrogantly and declared to the public that he would sell salmon, even if it was Japanese fish. The public was outraged and beat and insulted Xiang. Fortunately, the police intervened to prevent him from being killed. At 1:00 PM, five to six hundred people went to the county government to petition, demanding punishment for Xiang. At around 7:00 PM in the evening, over four hundred people held a meeting at the Qingnianhui Auditorium and resolved: (1) to file a lawsuit against Zhou Yongzhao, the manager of Tongfuchang, and others for instigating associates to injure He Shichang; (2) to send representatives to request assistance from various schools and to petition the press for justice; (3) to demand that Chen Jilv, a lawyer, and Xiang Lianseng voluntarily resign from Anli Foreign Company; if the lawyer disregards public opinion, a letter should be sent to the Law Society to revoke his membership. Furthermore, in the port of Ningbo, there were originally eleven companies selling salmon, including Tongfuchang. Now, it is learned that apart from Tongfuchang and Hengtai, the other nine companies, such as Xiangyuan, Yuankang, Yuansheng, Daxing, Yongzheng, Hengsheng, Wantai, Dingfeng, and Guangrun, fearing that the salmon might be mistaken for Japanese fish and cause public misunderstandings, jointly sent letters to various newspapers yesterday, declaring that they would not continue to sell the salmon.</p>
<p>Crew Members Kidnapped from the Xinning Steamer Have No Funds for Ransom – After the Xinmi steamer was robbed in Xiashan a few days ago, the purser, Liu Zhonghao, and others were kidnapped and their whereabouts are unknown. It is now learned that Liu's family received a letter from Liu Zhonghao and others from the bandits' lair yesterday. Liu Zhonghao demanded a ransom of 15,000 silver dollars, and Pan Youting, Zhang Jinmu, Chen Azhu, Tong Meigao, and Xiaolang, each demanded 10,000 silver dollars. After receiving the letter, Liu's family asked the shipping company to prepare the ransom. The company responded that it had always been the policy to provide a discretionary amount for comfort in the case of crew members encountering natural disasters and misfortunes, but it was not responsible for other obligations. Furthermore, due to the unrest in the current situation and the sluggish business, they had no ability to raise the funds. The families pleaded with them, but to no avail, and had to return home in tears, resigning themselves to fate.</p>

<h3>Wuhan YMCA Promotes Education for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>This year's floods in the Yangtze River region have affected millions of people. Although the floodwaters have receded, there are still a large number of displaced disaster victims. Leaving aside other places, in the town of Wuhan alone, the number of disaster victims seeking refuge has reached over 100,000 by the end of October. These disaster victims are mostly distributed in the shelters in Wuchang and Hanyang. They are destitute and homeless, and their plight is extremely miserable. Although they have temporary food and shelter, and their bodies are somewhat rested, their spiritual suffering is profound due to their illiteracy and ignorance. The YMCAs in Hankou and Wuchang, recognizing this situation, have connected with local people to initiate temporary education for disaster victims to provide relief. To guide the work, they previously sent a letter to Dr. Fu Ruoyu, a Shanghai expert in mass education, inviting him to Wuhan to assist with the project. Dr. Fu has already arrived in Wuhan a few days ago and has developed a large-scale plan for temporary education for disaster victims in Wuhan, which has already begun. The goal is to enroll 2,000 disaster victims and provide them with three months of temporary education in order to enable people to read and write and receive the basic education that citizens cannot lack. The 2,000 people will be divided into twenty schools, taught in the five shelters in Hongshan, Heshan, Qianjia Street, Meizi Mountain, and Fuyuan Street. Currently, they are contacting schools, hiring teachers, compiling teaching materials, and recruiting students. It is expected that classes will begin soon. As for the expenses, in addition to the funds allocated by the YMCAs in Hankou and Wuchang, the Hankou Shanghai Bank has donated 2,000 silver dollars for use.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Educational Funding is Exhausted</h3>
<p>The Department of Education Issued Half a Month's Salary for September Yesterday</p>
<p>The financial situation in Zhejiang Province was previously in dire straits, causing the Director of Finance, Wang Chengying, to travel to Beijing to resign. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek persuaded him to stay, he withdrew his intention to resign. After Wang returned to Zhejiang, he simultaneously arranged for the issuance of military and political expenses for the previous month and proposed to the provincial government a 25% salary reduction. As for educational funding in Zhejiang Province, it had only been issued up to August. September and October were both in arrears and had not been issued. This time, the Department of Finance allocated a small amount of money to the Department of Education. It is said that the Department of Education issued a notice yesterday, stating that all provincial schools will first be issued half a month's salary for September. As for the various venues and institutions, due to their accumulated savings, which can be transferred and moved around, the salary has not yet been issued.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Propaganda Teams from Universities Outside the City Are About to Depart</h3>
<p>Chongming District Set Off Today</p>
<p>Other Counties Can Be Completed Within Days</p>
<p>The propaganda department of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association of university students in this city has scheduled the first expanded propaganda campaign outside the city, divided into six districts. It is reported that the schools assigned to Chongming District include China Public School, Tongji University, Central University Medical School, Merchant Marine School, and Shanghai Art College. They decided to depart at 9:00 AM today. Except for Tongji University, which sent a 40-member commando team, each of the other schools sent 10 representatives, totaling over 70 people, carrying various propaganda materials. They also plan to hold costumed speeches in the area to awaken the general public. Those going to the Yangzhou District for propaganda include Guanghua University, Faculty of Law and Political Science, Shanghai Art College, Jiaotong University, Hujiang College, and Tongde Medical College. All seven schools will also depart next Monday. The others assigned to the Songjiang District, the French Bay District, the Qingjiangpu District, and the Changzhou District are all scheduled to depart within the next period. As soon as preparations are complete, they will set off. The following is a letter from the association's propaganda department to local organizations requesting assistance: "Dear Sir/Madam, This association is holding its first expanded propaganda campaign outside the city, with a focus on rural areas. We have assigned the following schools to carry out propaganda work in your county and are sending this letter specifically. We hope that you will provide assistance. Sincerely,"</p>
<h3>Various Schools Donate to General Ma to Support the Anti-Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Fudan University: After the Fudan Anti-Japanese Association resolved to have faculty, staff, students, and school workers donate to the military expenses of Ma Zhanshan, chairman of Heilongjiang Province, the school's accounting office entrusted the Bank of China to remit over 2,000 silver dollars to Harbin to be transferred to Chairman Ma, as a sign of their meager contribution.</p>
<p>Tongji University: The Tongji University Anti-Japanese Association in Wusong suspended classes for the past two days and departed to raise funds and conduct expanded propaganda in Wusong, Baoshan, Zhabei, the South City, and the concession areas. It is reported that the results were quite good.</p>
<p>Datong University: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of students at Datong University in this city remitted 200 silver dollars on the 14th to support Ma Zhanshan's military expenses. Yesterday, all departments of the university departed to raise funds to support the Northeast Army, divided into forty-eight teams. They returned in the evening, collected the donation boxes, and the Anti-Japanese Association requested President Cao to open the boxes in public. The total was over 1,000 silver dollars. Now that Heilongjiang has fallen, there is no way to remit the funds, and the Anti-Japanese Association has resolved to temporarily deposit the funds in the Shanghai Xinhua Bank. Once Ma Zhanshan's army is settled, or if there is a second person like Ma, the funds will be remitted immediately. At the same time, all the students were filled with righteous indignation over the fall of Heilongjiang, which was entirely due to the lack of reinforcements and ammunition. They resolved to telegraph the Executive Yuan of the National Government, as follows: "To the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing, Ma Zhanshan has fought bravely against the Japanese in isolation for several weeks, but the government has never issued a clear order to send reinforcements. He was left to exhaust his supplies and ammunition, and Heilongjiang fell. How can those who are responsible for defending the territory of the Republic of China explain themselves? Tens of millions of silver dollars are spent on military expenses each month, but is there really no power to assist Ma? Zhang Xueliang has yielded to Japan with both hands. He abandoned Han Guangdi before, and now abandons Ma Zhanshan. Wan Guoliang has absconded with over ten million in public funds. Can the government simply ignore this? Diplomacy should be approached from all sides. Now, Shi Zhaoji has been uniquely delegated to negotiate amidst four-sided songs, which is unlikely to succeed. Will anyone be responsible for the Republic of China in the future? Please announce this clearly immediately. Respectfully, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of students at Datong University."</p>
<p>Jiaotong University: On the 19th, all of Jiaotong University departed to give speeches and raise funds, divided into eighty teams. Donations from all walks of life were very enthusiastic. Fang Zhenwu, former chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, donated 500 silver dollars alone. Furthermore, four female students from the school, Li Xuan, Wu Shiying, Shao Zhuoran, and Mao Zhican, have joined the Southeast rescue team and departed for Heilongjiang to rescue wounded soldiers. Their loyalty and courage are truly outstanding.</p>
<p>Minli Middle School: All the students of Minli Middle School, grieved by the rampant behavior of the violent Japanese, gathered all the students in the school's playground at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. All wore military uniforms and paraded in formation in the Xiaodongmen area of the South City, shouting slogans such as "Down with Japanese imperialism," "China is about to perish, compatriots, quickly save the country," and "Please declare war on Japan immediately by the central government."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Education Bureau Ends Fundraising for Flood Relief in Various Schools</h3>

Red Team's Xu Kepei, with continuous assistance from Dong Xiaopei, scored four points. Green Light soared upwards, soon leading with a score of 14 to 4.

However, the good times did not last, and Green Light once again took the lead, winning the first half by six points. From the beginning of the second half, the Red Team's momentum was smooth, taking the lead. Xu Kepei and Dong Xiaopei performed excellently. For Green Light, Guo Zhihong and Huan Huanzi were considered the best performers. At that time, the Red Team had a strong momentum of catching up from behind, but ultimately failed with a score of 26 to 30 due to the lack of time.</p>

<h3>Memories of Dailiang</h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>Wu Dache, starting as a Hanlin scholar, jumped to become a Provincial Treasurer. Then jumped again to pacify Hunan. He once drilled new troops. Hence, he had a false reputation for knowing military affairs. He was casual and relaxed, enjoying songs and banquets. He even considered himself to be a romantic scholar-general. When the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 broke out, Wu took command. Many famous scholars from Jiangsu and Zhejiang were in his staff, including Lu Lianfu, Wu Changshuo, Weng Yinruo, and Shen Xiao, who were all invited. The army was stationed in Jinzhou. Every day, he would enjoy the moon and drink with his staff, such as Wei Guangjun, indulging himself as if he did not know that a strong enemy was in front of him. In his proclamations, he wrote that "This commander has the ability to capture the enemy seven times and release them seven times," and that "There had been signs of three battles and three defeats in the past." Although the rhetoric was skillful, it was exaggerated. Those who knew the situation knew that his arrogance would lead to defeat. At that time, the vanguard had already had minor skirmishes with the enemy, and the main camp was still dozens of miles away. One night, the Japanese used searchlights for long-distance observation, and the sound of cannons followed. The sound shook for hundreds of miles. Wu Changshuo was on an official mission, leading a dozen or so guards to inspect the various camps. Upon hearing the sound of the cannons, he fell from his horse, shouting that he had been hit by an electric cannon. He was exhausted and unable to move. His guards carried him back. He was bedridden for several days and urgently requested leave to recuperate. He quickly returned to Shanghai and never went back. Lu Lianfu, amidst the busy military affairs, still mixed rouge and ink, wielding his brush to paint small landscapes, flowers, and birds. He was calm and collected. People admired his composure. Weng Yinruo was the most capable. Dressed in simple military attire, he would ride dozens of miles every night. He often captured Japanese spies. Through strict interrogation, he learned of the enemy's treacherous plans. He was able to return alive, which was a great stroke of luck amidst misfortune. The Japanese hated Weng as if he were a thorn in their side. If Weng had not been there at that time, the entire army would have been wiped out.</p>
<h3>A Visit to General Ma Zhanshan</h3>

<p>Last year, I traveled extensively through the Heilongjiang province for business. I visited General Ma Zhanshan in Hulan. The merchants and residents of that county all praised General Ma Zhanshan's merits and virtues. At that time, he was the commander of the 1st Mixed Cavalry Brigade of Heilongjiang Province. (Heilongjiang Province did not have a divisional army organization.) At first, I was unable to meet him because the General was out. One day, I was walking when I saw a horse-drawn carriage rushing toward me. As it approached, we looked at each other. He recognized my clothing and knew that I was the friend who had visited him earlier. He stopped the carriage, opened the window, and greeted me, repeatedly apologizing. He pointed to the seat in the carriage and said, "Please come in, please come in." I was surprised and sat next to the General. I arrived at his residence.</p>
<p>The General was about forty years old. He was not tall, with a thin face and a straightforward manner. However, he also had a scholarly air. His eyes were bright and piercing, making it difficult to look directly at him. A small mustache lay above his lips, suggesting his bravery and dignity.</p>
<p>The next day, he hosted a banquet. The General invited me to take the seat of honor, treating me as a distinguished guest, which made me feel awkward and unsure of what to do. The General introduced me to all the other guests and explained my purpose. My mood relaxed slightly. Afterwards, we became closer and discussed politics, military affairs, economics, and geography. When he spoke of the Middle East Incident, he sighed with emotion, pausing after each word, as if he was overwhelmed with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>The General's insight was exceptional, beyond the reach of ordinary people. Regarding Mo Dehui's mission to Russia, he had the following views: "It is good that Mr. Mo is serving as China's representative to negotiate the Middle East Railway issue. However, it is somewhat unfortunate that Mr. Mo is not very knowledgeable about international affairs. However, his strengths more than compensate for his shortcomings. First, Mr. Mo is mature, prudent, and careful in his dealings. He is not frivolous, exaggerated, autocratic, or rash in making decisions. He consults the central government before handling everything. Second, Mr. Mo is not afraid of strong powers. He will not yield even if threatened with axes and blades, nor will he be swayed by money and benefits. With these two strengths, even if the Middle East Railway negotiation cannot be victorious, it will not lead to a treaty that humiliates the country like the Chonghou generation in the Qing Dynasty."</p>
<p>One day, I went to the General's residence again to talk. His family said that he had gone out to take a bath. I went to the bathhouse and asked the attendant, "Where is General Ma?" The attendant pointed me in his direction. I saw the General finishing his bath and getting dressed. I wanted to pay for his bath, but the General stared at me, so I told the attendant to pay and left. Later, I met him again in Qiqihar. I returned to Shanghai. Now that the General is resisting Japan with a lone army, his righteousness is awe-inspiring, which makes me feel deeply moved. (Transfer funds to support Heilongjiang)</p>
<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>British Women's Detective Squad A British woman, Miss Lilian Storey, recently organized a women's detective squad in Liverpool to fight against local thieves. All the women in the squad must be alert and brave, possessing a spirit of fearlessness. They must ensure that thieves cannot gain a foothold in Liverpool. According to Miss Storey, "The detectives under me must have qualified bodies and be proficient in boxing. When they encounter violent criminals, they can deal with them, so they will not appear weak because they are women. They must also be able to drive motorcycles so that they can quickly set off immediately in the event of an accident. And their motto is, 'See everything, hear everything, remain silent, and suspect everyone.'" This squad has now been established, and it is feared that the robbers and villains of Liverpool will flee upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Police Family In Reading, England, there is a police officer who has served in the police force for twenty-eight years. He recently retired due to old age. Interestingly, he was born in the police station. His father, grandfather, two uncles, one brother, and one brother-in-law were also members of the police force. This can truly be called a police family.</p>
<h3>The Siku Quanshu Robbed by Brutal Japan</h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>After brutal Japan occupied our Northeast on September 18th, the essence of the Northeast was almost completely lost. The most valuable Siku Quanshu in our country's more than four thousand years of cultural history, which was stored in Liaoyang, was also robbed by brutal Japan. Our country's culture is therefore no longer fully complete. The Siku Quanshu was compiled during the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty. It is divided into four major sections: Classics, History, Philosophy, and Literature. Each section is classified, totaling forty-four categories. The entire book includes 3,460 types. The compilation of the book was extremely difficult. It coincided with a time of peace and prosperity, which made this achievement possible. It originated with Zhu Zhujun of Daxing, who requested the opening of the Siku Quanshu Library. Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty adopted his suggestion. The position of chief compiler was originally intended for Zhu, but it did not materialize. It was then presided over by Ji Xiaofeng, the Duke of Wen Da of Hejian. Ji was thoroughly versed in Confucianism and understood all schools of thought. He fully annotated the gains and losses of the Six Classics, the similarities and differences in the various histories, the branches and schools of philosophy and literature, and even subjects such as poetry, medicine, and divination. He thoroughly grasped the essence, summarized the key points, and traced the origins and consequences. For each book, he followed the example of Liu Xiang and Zeng Gong, creating an outline to be placed at the beginning of each volume, with precise and insightful comments. His knowledge and insight were superior to those of Wang Zhongbao and Ruan Xiaoxu. Moreover, using the power of the emperor at that time, he ordered the governors and provincial educational commissioners of each province to instruct their subordinates to carefully purchase and search for books. Except for the examination essays sold in workshops, as well as useless family trees, letters, screens, congratulatory speeches, and insignificant compilations of poetry from folks, they were to collect and send them to the capital at any time. Over a period of ten years, hundreds of thousands of books were obtained. It can be said that all ancient and modern books were gathered. Those who assisted in this task included the deputy chief compiler Lu Xixiong and the compilers Lu Feichi, Dai Zhen, Wang Niansun, Wu Xiqi, and others, totaling over a hundred people, all of whom were famous scholars of the time. At that time, it was intended to be printed using movable type, but it was not possible due to the high cost. Therefore, skilled scribes were hired. There were up to 1,500 scribes. It took nine years to complete seven copies. The entire book was written with neat and correct characters, without any errors or omissions. After completing the writing, these 1,500 people were all appointed as county magistrates in various provinces as a reward for their hard work. The books were uniformly bound, and all the characters were written in regular script. It took more than thirteen years, a grand project unparalleled in history. Now, the copy in Shenyang, totaling more than 75,850 volumes, has all been transported away by brutal Japan. Alas, this is truly a great international theft.</p>
<h3>A Visit to a Famous Garden</h3>
<p>— Ma Mengrong</p>
<p>In recent years, people in our country have deeply realized the value of horticulture and agriculture, and they have also engaged in these industries. The most successful example is the Shanghai Planting Garden in Jiangwan. The owner of this garden is Shun'en, the eldest son of Mr. Yu Qiaqing. It is grand in scale. I had heard about it for a long time and wanted to see it for myself. Yesterday, the owner and his sister, Ms. Danhan, invited me to visit. I have been burdened by writing debts recently and have had little rest, so I wanted to steal half a day to enjoy the scenery of the autumn countryside. The owner also invited Xu Langxi, Xie Gongzhan, Zhang Shimin, Jiang Yiping, Lou Xinhu, Zhang Hongwei, Wang Shizi, Zheng Qing, Yu Weidan, and other friends, as well as male and female guests, totaling more than thirty people. Around noon, we gathered at the Xue Lu in the garden. After lunch, the owner led us to see the entire garden, which is divided into departments such as chrysanthemums, foreign flowers, potted plants, vegetables and fruits, seedlings, and chicken farms. Although the wind and frost were severe as it was the beginning of winter, the chrysanthemums were still able to compete in beauty, defying the cold. Their noble and unyielding spirit is admirable. There are more than two hundred varieties, which I cannot record in detail. The foreign flowers are all placed in warm rooms. There are more than a hundred varieties of Kanas, all of which have good fragrance and color. There are also more than a hundred varieties of daisies and monthly roses. There are also more than a hundred varieties of begonias, Japanese red, and other herbs. They are heated with steam, so they can bloom continuously throughout the winter. Camellias are a specialty of our local area (Yongjia). A good one can bloom in more than ten colors and is worth more than a hundred gold. The garden employs flower farmers from our local area to manage them. This flower is not easy to grow in Shanghai, so it can be a unique feature. Potted plants have always been dominated by the Japanese, and they are exported at a high price. The owner has more than a hundred varieties of potted plants, which are extremely antique and not easy to obtain. Good ones are worth a thousand gold, surpassing the Japanese products. This also helps to recover some of our rights and interests. What is most noteworthy is the chicken farm. It raises hundreds of birds of various breeds, including improved breeds, American breeds, and native breeds. Scientific methods are used for feeding, ventilation, and heating, so they are able to grow fat and reproduce prolifically. There are also chicken coops, electric incubators, and steam incubators, all of which were purchased from abroad at high prices. Now they can all be imitated and the price is especially low. There is a flock of white ducks raised by the river. Their feathers are beautiful, and they can understand when called by name. They are lovely. After the tour, we returned to the room to rest. Ms. Danhan is skilled in calligraphy and painting, and her reputation is highly regarded in the art world. She immediately took out paper and brushes and began to paint. She then collaborated with Gongzhan, Xinhu, Shizi, Hongwei, Qing, and Shimin to create several paintings of chrysanthemums, peaches, willows, chickens, and ducks. Each of them titled a painting to leave to the owner as a souvenir. I playfully painted a chick, which seemed to want to move. Ms. Xiuyun saw it and asked for it. The owner knew that I could paint crabs, so he asked me to paint a black crab. It was already dusk. The owner broke off some chrysanthemums to give us as farewell gifts and we dispersed. My father also likes to plant flowers and trees to maintain his health, so there are many flowers and trees in the garden. I have not returned home for several years. The ancient pines must be old, and the yellow flowers must be smiling. After finishing writing, I feel sad. (Reject payment)</p>

<p>— Jingheng</p>
<p>The Chronology of Japanese Aggression Against China and Various Massacres, compiled by Mr. Moyi, lists the cruel and brutal acts of the Japanese government, its military, and its citizens against our country.

<h3>Villager Arrives in Shanghai Again (23)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>"Those 'wild chickens' (prostitutes), being so pitiable themselves, and also harmful to others, why aren't they prohibited?" the villager raised this question.</p>
<p>"Who will prohibit them? You must know that this place is the concession, managed by foreigners. Originally, outside the concession, there were no such soliciting 'wild chickens'."</p>
<p>"Then the 'wild chickens' are ultimately Chinese. If foreigners see them, we lose face as Chinese. Can't the Chinese talk to the foreigners and ask them to prohibit it? Are all the residents in the concession Chinese with no authority at all?" The villager felt somewhat disapproving.</p>
<p>"The Chinese can certainly talk. Wasn't the Chinese Taxpayers Association organized? There are also directors and committee members. As a rule, such things that are harmful to morals, harming others and oneself, should be prohibited."</p>
<p>"Then why aren't they prohibited?" the villager went a step further.</p>
<p>"This I don't know. Those bigwigs and gentlemen are very busy. Who has time to care about such small matters? Besides, they would certainly not go after 'wild chickens'. Those who go after 'wild chickens' should suffer the punishment of contracting venereal disease. There's another saying: if all the 'wild chickens' standing on the roads are prohibited, making the roads quiet, those who frequent open-air teahouses will find it uninteresting. And the doctors who specialize in treating venereal disease will have less business, their doors will be deserted, which isn't in line with the principle of people's livelihood. " That friend, feeling that he had said too much, just as a patrolman walked by, fearing attracting unwanted attention, said goodbye to the villager and walked away.</p>
<p>Although the villager had not found his nephew A Mulin, his stomach was rumbling, and his five internal organs were starting to panic a little. He thought: if he went to Meilanfang to his nephew's place at this time, they would probably have already had dinner. The villager didn't like to bother people. It would be better to find a restaurant outside, fill his belly, and then go to their place. Otherwise, going there on an empty stomach, and people asking, "Have you eaten? Have you eaten?" while his stomach was growling loudly, would be inappropriate.</p>
<p>He had an experience once: he was also on the street, feeling hungry, and he wanted to find a restaurant to fill his stomach. He saw a large sign that said "So-and-so Restaurant," and he rushed in. Who knew that when he went in, it was a series of bedrooms, with very elaborate beds, very luxurious bedding, and very beautiful women. People asked him what he was there for. He said he was there to eat. People pushed him out, saying they thought he was there to rent a room and sleep, and to go eat somewhere else. He even argued with them for a long time, his face and neck red, saying that the sign clearly said "So-and-so Restaurant."</p>
<p>Experience had taught him that the so-called "restaurants" in Shanghai were for sleeping with women, not for eating.</p>

<h3>Gold Standard Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Significant Fluctuations with Further Drop of Twelve Taels. Yesterday, the decline of the gold standard intensified. Its volatility was boundless, its momentum unstoppable, and its situation perplexing. Throughout the day, there were twenty-two taels of fluctuations, ultimately with a further drop of twelve taels. People were unusually anxious. The market was oversupplied. The silver market rose slightly. Initially, it opened steadily, but then both official and unofficial exchange rates weakened. Dealers' buying and selling were uncertain, but the atmosphere was not good and the trend was downward. There was only a rotation of three or four taels. At noon, it weakened further, with a sharp drop of ten taels. The market outlook was precarious. Rumors circulated that the League of Nations, seeing the growing strength of violent Japan and its occupation of Heilongjiang Province, was planning to sever economic ties with Japan, causing people to feel weak and selling pressure to spread, so the price almost plunged thousands of miles. Suddenly, it broke through 640 taels, and the exchange rate followed suit.</p>
<p>Gradually Weakening in the Morning: From the early morning, it rose by 3 taels and 7 qian, reaching 653 taels and 5 qian. The near-term rate did not change much, and the forward rate rose by one-eighth. The silver price increased by 8.6 fen, but buyers outnumbered sellers. Fuyu, Tongtaichang, Yuankangxiang, and others were all buying. General retail short sellers also came to cover their positions. It continued to rise to 58 taels. News then came that the silver price privately telegraphed an increase of three-quarters of a cent. The large-denomination currency was firmly grounded, so people's hearts turned downward. Dadecheng, Tongtaihang, Yuchang, Fuchang, and others unanimously sold off. Moreover, the US dollar weakened immediately, with the spot rate at 33.625 yuan, and banks bought several million yuan. The British pound closed at 19375, so the gold price fell by ten taels, to only 48 taels. At that time, retail investors and others bought in. Chengjin and Hua Bi were trading US dollars for this month at 33.5625 yuan, which then increased to 52.5 taels. The British pound rate was revealed to have increased by half a penny, and the US dollar by 75, only retreating to 51 taels. At that time, HSBC absorbed US dollars for January at 33.625 yuan, and various banks traded with each other at 33.5 yuan. Subsequently, the forward rate was taken over by Datong at 4375, and Yu Dafu, Fuchang, Dadecheng, and others dragged it upward, so the price jumped by five or six taels, reaching 56.5 taels at 10 o'clock. Gradually, it became slightly sideways, with only one or two taels of fluctuation. After 10:30, selling pressure became very strong. Yuan Mao, Yong Yifeng, Yong Tongfu, Yu, and others sold off. Mai Bank bought US dollars for March at 6875, then 75. By 11 o'clock, it had fallen to 45 taels. A moment later, it seemed that there were more buyers. Qian Changxiang, Yu Da, and others bought in, and it gradually rose. At noon, it was 50 taels and 5 qian. At this time, the US dollar was trading at 625. By the time of closing, it was still suppressed to 47 taels, and the listed price was changed to 739 taels, a deduction of about 90 taels.</p>
<p>The Aftermarket Falls into a Dangerous Situation: The aftermarket opened at 47.5 taels. Tongtaichang bought in, raising it to 50 taels. Then Daxingyong and the Guangdong banks sold off, immediately cutting it down by more than 4 taels, and with the addition of 14 annas to the Indian exchange rate, it fell to 45 taels and 6 qian. Later, Yuan Mao Yong and others bought in, and Mitsui bought British pounds for January at 195625. Mai Bank bought US dollars for March at 33.75, and also bought British pounds for March at 19.5, so the gold price was seen to rise again. Tongtaichang's buying intention was still strong, reaching 51 taels after 3 o'clock, with only a fluctuation of more than two taels in between. Subsequently, it was heard that HSBC was selling US dollars at 8125, and it was rumored that rioters were still causing disturbances in Tianjin, and the situation was tense, so people panicked suddenly, and the market went downstream sharply, retreating to 45 or 6 taels. At 3:30, news suddenly came that the League of Nations was imposing severe sanctions on Japan, and the situation became dangerous again. Various firms tended to sell off. The market was in a state of misery and decline, with a sharp drop of 10 taels, breaking through 40 taels. At 4:10, it suddenly became 36 taels, and the British pound could be closed at 195625, and the US dollar even reached 34 yuan. However, at that time, the Guangdong banks took the opportunity to buy in, raising it by more than 4 taels in a rush, to 40 taels and 5 qian. By the closing time of 4:30, it was 38 taels, a decrease of 11.8 taels compared to the previous day. It was then traded at 8 or 9 taels to 7 and a half taels, endlessly. According to the record, the maximum was 58 taels and the minimum was 36 taels, a fluctuation of 22 taels during the day. The closing price for goods in the morning market was 52.5 taels, the afternoon market closed at 48 taels, and the afternoon closed at 9 taels and 38.5 taels. The listed price was deducted by more than 100 taels. The registered price was 50 taels to 47 taels in the morning and 41 taels to 38 taels in the afternoon. The water supplement was 50 taels to 41 taels. The exchange rate was increased by 6 taels.</p>
<p>Disorganized Speculative Intentions: Transactions on the table were varied. According to statistics, Qian Changxiang, Yu Da, Richang, Wanxing, Xie Kang, and Cuichangyong were all buying. Fuyu, Hong Kangyong, and Tongtaichang advanced first and then retreated. Shunli and Dadecheng sold more and bought less. Fuchang, Yuantai, Yuanchun, Yuhe, Longsheng, Daxingyong, Futai Xiang, Sen Changyong, and Dakang had quite a lot of ins and outs.

However, the complex state of affairs resulted in an increase compared to the previous night, with the British pound increasing by 0.25 and the US dollar by 0.05625. The drop in the gold standard was severe, due to the impact of the turbulent situation, and rumors circulated that the League of Nations would handle the situation with Japan in accordance with its charter, so the foreign exchange market followed suit and weakened. Transactions in the gold industry were not uncommon, but the squeezing trends were different, with about 100,000 pounds of British pounds and 600,000 to 700,000 yuan of US dollars being traded, and many banks trading with each other.</p>

Transactions were 4,000 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao at noon. Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 qian, 4 fen, 7 li, 8 hao and 7 hu in the early market, and suddenly turned higher by 0.0025 at noon, to 6 qian and 5 fen, resulting in a reverse increase of 0.001 compared to the previous day's early market. Transactions were 160,000 jiao in the early market and 90,000 jiao at noon. Copper coins were reduced by 1,000 wen, to 378,000 wen, and more than 29,000 strings were traded.</p>
<h3>Securities Fall into Longjiang and Public Bonds Plunge Again</h3>
<p>A Decrease of About 2 to 3 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market situation, although spot goods were opened in many varieties, transactions were still scarce, and the price of goods fell sharply, and transactions were more active, but mostly in small amounts, and large households still rarely had large transactions. Checking the changes in the market prices of various bonds, the loss of Heilongjiang Province has already become a fact. People in the market, seeing that the Japanese disregard international integrity and are pressing forward step by step, generally worry that the national relations between China and Japan will eventually break down. Although the League of Nations has held meetings for many days, they all intend to wait and see, so most people are quite pessimistic, and people's hearts are becoming increasingly weak. Although financial institutions are calm and rarely sell off, the market demand is cold, and retail sales are particularly active. The prices of various bonds uniformly continued to fall by about one yuan in the morning. The situation in the aftermarket felt even more tense. There was a worsening situation in the League of Nations on the market, resulting in more transactions. At the initial auction for demobilization and troop reduction, the situation was still moderate, and then the downward trend suddenly turned fierce. If some party had not made considerable purchases, then the 20 Customs Consolidated Tax, etc., would probably be forced to fall to the price limit and stop the auction. As a result, compared with the previous day, except for the stable 96 Customs Tax and the sixth-class tax, the demobilization and troop reduction fell by more than one yuan, the 20 Customs Consolidated Tax fell by more than three yuan, and the rest also fell by more than two yuan. Looking at the bond market situation, it is now in a state of extreme chaos due to people's anxiety. Although the prices have now fallen to a low level, there is still no room for optimism. The total transaction volume of spot goods was 8,000 yuan, and the total amount of futures transactions was 13.66 million yuan, including more than 2 million yuan for the consolidated salt tax and 20 Customs Tax.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Raw Cotton Markets are Miserable</h3>
<p>National Disaster Such as This... No Intention of Speculation</p>
<p>The yarn market is very tired and the trend is scattered. Because Heihe was seized by violent Japan, people are extremely angry, and most are downcast and have no intention of doing business, so most of the bids are made on the blackboard, and the market atmosphere is extremely idle. Currently, the sales of yarn are still sluggish, and various groups say that the money market is extremely tight and business is very lacking.</p>
<p>Most Prices are Bid on the Blackboard: At the opening of the previous market, due to the poor situation and very soft market conditions, each fell by 1.2 qian. In the afternoon, each month rose slightly by 1, 2, or 3 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 11,600 bales. It was found that the large sales were Fuyu with 800 bales, Hengyi with 1,050 bales, and Gongtai with 300 bales. The large purchases were Xincheng with 600 bales and Changfeng with 750 bales, with Tongyu with 500 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price: Increase/Decrease Balance,</p>
<p>January 1520, .25, 80,002</p>
<p>February 1540, Up 1, 74,300</p>
<p>12th day 1529, Up 1, 59,350</p>
<p>March 1545, 62,400</p>
<p>January 1535, 2, 73,700</p>
<p>April 1544, Down 1, 37,600</p>
<p>Money Market is Tight and Spot Sales are Sluggish: Sales of spot yarn are average. It was found that the total number of bales bought by various groups throughout the day was 660 bales. 130 bales were bought by the same industry. The market is weak. Among the client groups, Jiangxi bought 35 bales, the mainland bought 550 bales, Guangdong bought 20 bales, the northern group bought 35 bales, and miscellaneous groups bought 40 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Slightly Brisk</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly firm. Although there is a shortage of goods received this month, there are also few deliveries, and the market atmosphere is firm, which also drives up the distant months. However, there are no inquiries about spot cotton from various factories, because foreign cotton has already absorbed its fill, and there is no need to use it at present, so the overall trend is extremely softened.</p>
<p>There are Short Sellers Covering in the Han Bid: At the opening of the previous market, due to the weakening of foreign cotton and the softening of people's hearts, each fell by 1 qian. 2-3 plates rose slightly, and as a result, the price rose by 5 fen to 1 qian. In the afternoon, short sellers covered their positions, and each month rose by 1 qian and 5 fen to 2 qian and 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 41,700 dan. It was found that the large sales were Yuanda with 1,400 dan, Yicheng with 1,600 dan, Changfeng with 1,400 dan, and Xincheng with 700 dan. The large purchases were Mingde with 3,000 dan, Tianlong with 1,300 dan, and Yu Chang with 2,200 dan. The closing price is listed on the left: Closing Price of Han Bid: Increase/Decrease Balance</p>

<p>January 3175, 15, 211,100</p>
<p>April 3,70, 15, 142,500</p>
<p>Factory Stomachs are Filled with Foreign Cotton: Spot cotton trading is very sluggish. The source is estimated to be 900 bales of Yaohua.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 32.50, Shenxin Entered 300 Pieces of Spot Goods for Delivery to the Factory</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Unanimously Reports a Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially tired due to the completion of long positions, and at the close, some short positions were covered, and the trend was slightly firm, with futures falling 2 to 4 pound notes and spot goods falling 5 pound notes. British cotton futures fell 3 to 5 points and spot goods fell 15 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell 25 points. Indian cotton softened due to sales by European exporters, with Pingguoer falling 3.5 rupees, Aomula falling 3.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi falling 4.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left: (Telegraph on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Grain and River Down Rice Market is Tight and Then Soft</h3>
<p>South of Shanghai: Yesterday, the source of goods from various groups was still scarce, and the stock in Pudong was also thin. Sales in urban and rural stores have not been smooth. In fact, the situation is tense, the money market is tight, and people are indifferent, so the transaction volume is worse than yesterday, so the market is also unstable. Therefore, the price of thick new japonica rice has fallen, and although there are scattered thin early indica rice goods, the sales market is shrinking, and Ningbo rice is still acceptable. The market price is mediocre. Foreign dujian rice sales are sluggish, the market rises and falls, the yin rice has little accumulation, and only top-quality materials are traded in retail. The stomach is not very greedy, and the market situation is also turning average.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, a total of more than 50 ships arrived on the Suzhou River. There was no change in this street. The price of goods from Suzhou, Changzhou, and Zhongguan was 0.2 yuan weaker. The large plate was more peaceful than the South City. The stocks of goods from Liyang and Yixing are not thick, and there are few store stomachs, so the market surface has a loose image. Some Phoenix and Lai Lai goods are connected, and the rural groups are most active, and the market prices are generally rising. Foreign dujian and bujian slightly arrive at the port, and although retail sales are clear, the market form is settled.</p>
<h3>Foreign Guest Indica Rice is Actually Sold Sluggishly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign guest indica rice market situation, initially inheriting the previous day's market atmosphere, was very good, but the stomachs of this guest office were very weak, so the market did not continue to rise. Tongshi only opened 200 bales of small grain, priced at 10.02 yuan, and 150 bales of Taizhou Zhongguan white rice, priced at 10 yuan, and there were no other transactions. Foreign firms continued to throw futures, and the market was also flat and soft. Xiangmao Foreign Firm newly threw 1,000 tons of small grain for January, delivered by Yinghua Company, priced at 4 taels and 7 qian and a half. The returned cargo has 100 tons of small grain for April, priced at 5 taels and 07 fen, and 300 tons of No. 1 Saigon for February, priced at 5 taels and 4 qian and a half, all of which were received by this street.</p>
<h3>Wheat Sales Will Soon Come to a Halt</h3>
<p>The Standard is Nearly Flat and the Distant is Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market generally presented a nearly flat and distant stable image. In the near term, because delivery is approaching again, and more long positions outside the industry need to be closed, the wheat market is unlikely to take off in the midst of quiet external sales. However, in the long term, because the price of foreign wheat has risen by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan, people's hearts have been slightly shaken, but transactions are very quiet. Looking at the next step, it is feared that it will enter a standstill. As a result, this month and December were down 0.01, January was good 0.02, February and March were good 0.03, and April was good 0.02.</p>
<h3>Flour Market is in Waiting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market turned to a stable situation again. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat rose by about 0.4 to 0.5 yuan, and the gold market was also fluctuating without major ups and downs, both buyers and sellers were silent. Because the national disaster is serious, the hearts of people inside and outside the industry cannot help but be uneasy. If relations with Japan are severed, there will be more ups, but declines will also be unavoidable. The source of foreign wheat will be hit, but the actual sales of the north and south oceans will also be hindered. The people's waiting is not without reason. As a result, this month was slightly better than the previous day by 0.0025, December was good by 0.0025, January and February were good by 0.005, March was good by 0.0025, and April was good by 0.005.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Fluctuations: Sugar Market Turns Down Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from production areas indicated that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.375. The price of New York futures sugar for March next year was 1.22, unchanged from previous reports; May was 1.25, down one point; and September was 1.35, also unchanged. The spot price of Java sugar remained unchanged. Trading in the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Association market was sluggish, and buying interest was weak. The market showed signs of weakening again. The transaction price for Dutch No. 24 coarse white sugar was ten taels, finely ground white sugar was ten taels and five cents, and No. 20 medium white sugar was nine taels and eight mace, showing a stable trend. Only the B mark of Taikoo sugar had some transactions at eleven taels and five mace. The rest were holding steady. Trading in the classified market remained quiet. Yesterday's report that Hoksung Ice Sugar was quoted at eight taels and four mace was indeed incorrect, and this correction is appended.</p>
<h3>Reduced Supply of Tung On Longans in Chapei</h3>
<p>The production of Tung On dried longans this year was very poor, so the initial offering price was very high. Afterwards, it gradually declined. It is noted that the current market price is already down by about four to five taels from the highest price. Therefore, the recent arrivals have been sharply reduced. According to letters from the producing area, the remaining inventory is also scarce. Compared to the Shanghai market, losses are certain. If the Shanghai market cannot improve, the supply will inevitably be exhausted.</p>
<h3>Brisk Sales of Zhen Mei Tea from Country Estates to England</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhen Mei green tea from country estates continued to be traded briskly. It is estimated that Jardine Matheson, Hsieh Ho, Tong Fu, Jin Long and other firms in the city purchased over 1,500 boxes of Tunxi Zhen Mei pearl tea. The market price remained unchanged compared to previous months. Tian Yu, Qia He, and other firms also sent telegrams for higher grades of Wuyuan Zhen Mei. However, the Qianzhuang (money shops) are still watching the Gongxi (tribute tea) item, and no one from the Whitehead (experienced) tea firms is asking about it. The market situation is very quiet.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Market: New Arrivals Imminent</h3>
<p>This year's asphalt price surge has set a new record, unprecedented in history. The momentum was strong during the late summer and autumn. Hankou's famous Chongjing brand was sold for thirty-eight taels, and Cheng City oil for thirty-four taels, double the price of previous years. Candle manufacturers, burdened by high costs, have changed their strategy, using kerosene as the core and asphalt as the coating. Therefore, the asphalt market has been greatly reduced. Although the inventory is low, the sales volume is even lower, resulting in no inquiries after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The price is perceived as high and unsustainable. As new goods from producing areas such as Jinhua and Lanxi in Zhejiang Province appeared, and merchants in Hangzhou still had one to two thousand pieces in stock, a state of panic gradually set in. Various firms have sent people to promote sales everywhere, and price reductions are inevitable. In the midst of this competitive selling, the prices plummeted. It is understood that Lanxi Pingzhu asphalt has fallen from forty yuan to twenty-four yuan per burden. This kind of price drop is also unprecedented in the market. Recently, because of the excessive drop, it seems to be stabilizing. The Hankou market has also started to decline, falling by four to five taels in the past week. According to yesterday's Hankou report, Tianjin oil is offered at twenty-two taels, and Macheng oil has no market, with high-quality goods probably only at twenty-two or twenty-three taels. Zhu Hong's famous Chongjing brand was once offered at twenty-eight taels a week ago, but compared to recent prices, it is at most twenty-four taels. Shanghai firms are about to run out of stock, and no new goods have arrived. In half a month, the Heben asphalt from the nearby western Zhejiang area should arrive in Shanghai. However, Heben goods are of the best quality and the price is also the highest, and cannot be compared with Lanxi asphalt.</p>
<h3>Coal Market: Stagnant Sales of Bituminous Coal Dust</h3>
<p>Various types of bituminous coal dust have recently experienced sluggish sales due to the closure of silk factories. Moreover, merchants from railway and road construction companies have also reduced their purchases, making market transactions even more stagnant. Sales prices are also difficult to rise. Yesterday's prices were: Baigu Tuntong 318 tons, priced at fourteen taels; Boshan Tuntong 300 tons, priced at eleven taels and two mace and a half; Beipiao dust 250 tons, priced at ten taels.</p>
<h3>Hardware Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Chaotic Situation... Stagnant Sales</p>
<p>Tight Credit... Merchants Unload Stock</p>
<p>The hardware market is currently chaotic due to the situation, and the purchases of various trades are slack. Hardware prices are also showing a tendency to plummet due to the unstable sentiment. Items such as plain galvanized iron, corrugated iron, tinplate, new foreign silver dollars, angle iron, new iron wire, blue lead, and tin are all declining. Moreover, the tight credit situation has forced some merchants with internal financial pressures to privately unload their stock to seek sales. Therefore, the future trend is not optimistic for the time being.</p>

<h3>All Sectors Express Views Amid National Crisis</h3>
<p>Various Proposals for Internal and External Affairs</p>
<p>Since the fall of Heilongjiang, public sentiment has been greatly shaken. Yesterday, various sectors made proposals on internal and external issues, which are summarized as follows.</p>
<h3>Wang, Wu, and Zou Telegraph Beijing, Expressing Diplomatic Proposals</h3>
<p>Instructing Shi Zhaoji to Persist in Demanding Japan's Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Treaty Issues Should Not Be Discussed</p>
<p>Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaochu, Zou Lu, and others telegraphed Beijing representatives Cai Zimin, Chen Zhenru, Wu Tiecheng, and others, saying: Zimin, Puquan, Jingjiang, Shiceng, Zhenru, Tiecheng, esteemed sirs, reports state that the League of Nations Council met in Paris on the 18th of this month, and the Chinese representative Shi and the Japanese representative Yoshizawa had different interpretations of the Sino-Japanese Treaty. We have not received any news from you regarding diplomatic matters. We do not know if the above is accurate. If it is true, we believe that abandoning the insistence on Japan's troop withdrawal and discussing the Sino-Japanese Treaty is the biggest mistake. Japan's invasion of our territory is undeniably their fault. We demand that the League of Nations order them to withdraw their troops, and world opinion is in sympathy with us. Therefore, not only are we justified in this matter, but world opinion also clearly understands our justification. As for the Sino-Japanese Treaty, the history is complex, and Japan is cunning. Although we are justified, world opinion may not clearly understand our justification. Japan deliberately raises the treaty issue to cover up its invasion issue, diverting the world's attention. This is indeed a clever move for Japan. Why should we also fall into their trap, listen to their instructions, and discuss the treaty with them? Some say that Japan proposed five basic principles as conditions for troop withdrawal, and one of the five principles concerns the Sino-Japanese Treaty. Therefore, our country's representative cannot but discuss the treaty with them. This is not true. The role of the League of Nations is to maintain world peace. When two countries have a dispute, country A, no matter how justified, may not use force against country B. It must first submit the case to the League of Nations for resolution. This is the League of Nations' greatest role in maintaining peace. There was a precedent six years ago that completely coincides with the current Sino-Japanese incident. In October 1925, Greece and Bulgaria clashed, and Greek troops invaded Bulgarian territory. The next day, Greece appealed to the League of Nations. On the same day, Aristide Briand, President of the League of Nations Council, before the Council met, sent telegrams to both governments, asking them to immediately withdraw their troops. Two days later, when the Council met, the Bulgarian representative spoke, discussing the merits of the case. Briand forbade him from speaking, saying that the issue at this time was troop withdrawal, not the merits of the case. At the same time, the Council asked the governments of both countries to issue orders for troop withdrawal within 24 hours and to completely withdraw their troops to their original defenses within 66 hours. France, Britain, and Italy sent military officers nearby to report on the troop withdrawal situation. As a result of the Council's handling of the matter, the Greek troops completely withdrew within six days. Afterwards, when the Council met, the Greek representative said that the Greek troops were dispatched in self-defense. The President of the Council, Aristide Briand, corrected him, saying that this kind of thinking was extremely dangerous. If all countries used defense as an excuse, then incidents would often escalate and become unmanageable. The role of the League of Nations is precisely to make all countries resort to the League of Nations instead of resorting to force when they have disputes. This incident is sufficient to prove that the League of Nations will fulfill its peaceful mediation duties for those who appeal to the League of Nations. The situation of the Greek-Bulgarian incident is exactly the same as the current Sino-Japanese incident. However, in that incident, the two representatives wanted to discuss the merits of the case on the Council floor, and the President of the Council forbade them from speaking before the troop withdrawal, and corrected their inappropriate arguments after the troop withdrawal. However, in this invasion of our territory and massacre of our soldiers and civilians, not only were the troops not withdrawn within six days, but after two months, they continued to advance. On the Council floor, not only was there no deadline for troop withdrawal, but also the merits of the Sino-Japanese Treaty over the past decades were studied. It seems that the League of Nations' handling of the Greek-Bulgarian incident is completely different from its handling of the Sino-Japanese incident. We believe that our country's representative should cite the Greek-Bulgarian precedent in the Council and request Aristide Briand, the President of the Council who presided over the Greek-Bulgarian incident last time, and the current President of the Council who is handling the Sino-Japanese incident, to handle the current Sino-Japanese incident with the same methods and means. When our country's representative encounters the presentation of the Sino-Japanese Treaty or other issues, they should refuse to discuss them and declare that the Chinese representative's authority is only to discuss troop withdrawal and cannot talk about other matters. It was resolved at the meeting in Shanghai some time ago that the policy and principles regarding diplomatic incidents should be discussed at this meeting, and the negotiations should be carried out by the Nanjing government. The response to the League of Nations should have been the responsibility of the Nanjing government. However, at this critical moment, we dare to elaborate in detail on what we can see and ask the person in charge to adopt and implement it. That is what we hope for. We respectfully wish you good health. Wang Zhaoming, Wu Chaochu, Zou Lu, November 20th.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Resolves Various Important Cases</h3>
<p>Telegraphing the League of Nations to Implement Article 16 of the Covenant for Sanctions</p>
<p>Requesting the National Government to Defend Itself with Force and Strengthen the Diplomatic Corps</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its 20th Executive Committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Over twenty people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jite, Yuan Lvdeng, Gu Xinyi, Pei Yunqing, Luo Qinghua, Wen Lanting, Jiang Zhigang, Lu Qisheng, Lao Jingxiu, Cheng Xiechun, Wu Zhihao, Lu Wenshao, Fang Jiaobo, and others. Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting. After the customary formalities, Secretary Yan Esheng read the minutes of the last meeting and various important documents. The following cases were then discussed: (1) Discussing the proposed standard for detaining Japanese goods. Economic severance is a powerful weapon for our country to deal with the violent Japanese, and detaining Japanese goods is a means to implement economic severance. The two are mutually supportive. However, the detention of goods should have standards, otherwise it will be unrestricted, which will only harm merchants and is not appropriate. Should the Chamber of Commerce invite experts to study the standards for detaining goods? Resolved: To be handled by the Committee for Implementing Economic Severance. (2) Discussing the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau's order to prohibit raising the prices of domestic goods and the organization of a Domestic Goods Evaluation Committee. Resolved: The Standing Committee will designate candidates for the Domestic Goods Evaluation Committee and issue a notice to the city's business community to comply with the order. (3) Discussing sending a telegram to the National Government and the League of Nations to express views on the current situation. Resolved: Passed. (The telegrams are attached below.) Also, telegraphing the Chambers of Commerce of various provinces and cities to advocate the same. (4) Discussing the proposal by Committee Member Luo Qinghua to raise funds for war preparation against Japan. Resolved: To issue a notice, and the Standing Committee will draft and implement detailed measures.</p>

<p>To Mr. Aristide Briand, President of the League of Nations Council in Paris: The League of Nations' two resolutions generously granted Japan a deadline for troop withdrawal, but have not been implemented. Regarding the steps that should be taken in accordance with the charter, we believe that the League of Nations has been extremely patient, giving Japan a chance to reform itself. For the sake of respecting the League of Nations, the Chinese people have endured unlimited sacrifices for two months. However, Japan not only has not withdrawn its troops, but also captured Heilongjiang on the 19th and recruited traitors to help create a Manchurian-Mongolian Empire under Japanese protection. We believe that peace in the Far East will fall into an unsustainable state. We hope that the League of Nations can fulfill its responsibilities, exert its greatest effectiveness, order Japan to withdraw its troops immediately, and stop all its violent actions. If Japan does not comply with public opinion, Article 16 of the Covenant should be implemented for sanctions. Otherwise, the Chinese people will believe that the League of Nations is powerless and will only urge the government to implement the right to national self-defense, regardless of any sacrifice. At that time, the incident in the Far East will not be China's fault. We hope you will be wise. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce (official seal).</p>
<p>To the National Government in Nanjing: Heilongjiang has fallen, and the border troubles are deepening. The northeastern provinces are about to be lost forever. The 20th Executive Committee meeting of the Chamber of Commerce has resolved to instruct Minister Shi to propose to the League of Nations the implementation of Article 16 of the Covenant to impose sanctions together. At the same time, the National Government should quickly seek self-defense, take over the defense area with force, and improve the organization of the diplomatic corps. It should promptly appoint a responsible foreign minister and urge the ambassadors stationed in various countries to take office quickly to negotiate for the country to save it from peril. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce (signed).</p>
<p>Circular telegram to the Chambers of Commerce of various provinces: To the Chambers of Commerce and organizations of various provinces and cities: Liaoning and Jilin have been lost, and Heilongjiang has fallen after them. The deadline for troop withdrawal has long passed, and the Japanese army's atrocities are even more rampant. Unless the people of the whole country have great determination to urge the government to rise up for self-defense, it will not be enough to save the country from peril, recover the defense area, improve the organization of the diplomatic corps, promptly appoint a responsible foreign minister, and urge the ambassadors stationed abroad to take office quickly to negotiate for the country. Please advocate the same and call out together. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce (signed).</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Does Not Support Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>Guangdong Representatives Telegraph Request for Investigation: The Guangdong representatives telegraphed the Guangzhou National Government yesterday, saying: To the Guangzhou National Government: General Ma Zhanshan is fighting against Japan with a solitary army, fighting bravely and unyieldingly. His loyalty and courage are commendable. However, the solitary army in the remote border area is difficult to sustain for long. Nearby generals have not heard of any rescue. Please find a way to provide practical assistance immediately. Zhang Xueliang is responsible for the defense of the northeastern border, but he lost Liaoning and Jilin to the three characters of "non-resistance." Now he is not saving Heilongjiang. Please order his dismissal and investigation. Zhaoming, Shu, Lu, Hao.</p>
<p>Zou Lu's Personal Telegram of Accusation: Zou Lu, representative of Shanghai and Guangdong, sent a telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping yesterday regarding the loss of Heilongjiang Province, saying: To Mr. Hanqing: Last year, I went to Shenyang twice and met with you many times. I once wrote to advise you that your life was unregulated, your orders were irregular, you indulged in pleasure and dissipation, and your political life would be at most three years, or at least one year. Unless you work hard to improve, you will surely harm yourself and the country. I was very happy and comforted to receive your reply accepting my advice. Later, I heard that those who were using you were increasingly tempting you, and you became increasingly arrogant and complacent, worsening the situation. I knew that the northeastern provinces would inevitably fall into greater danger because of this. This summer in Dalian, I once wrote to advise you to send the entire army out of the pass to strengthen the defense, but you did not accept my advice, which led to the violent Japanese invaders seizing the opportunity to invade and occupy. You and your father have been responsible for the defense of the northeastern border for more than ten years, commanding hundreds of thousands of troops, but you lost the provinces of Shen and Ji in a single day. According to the meaning of the duty of a guard, you should have already dealt with yourself. However, I heard that you are still indulging in pleasure and dissipation, and you are not planning to recover the lost territory. You have not heard of any assistance to General Ma's emergency. Now Heilongjiang Province has been lost again. The territory of several provinces has been ruined by you. For the sake of the national discipline, for the sake of the national indignation, for the sake of international prestige, you will surely have to apologize to the people of the country in order to be considered a real man. I know that our friendship is shallow and I should not speak so deeply, and I know that honest words are always harsh, but I cannot help but give my final advice. I hope you can deal with it well. Zou Lu, Ge.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Telegraphed Briand Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting him to Preside over Peace</p>
<p>The Banking Association of this city sent a telegram to Mr. Aristide Briand, Chairman of the League of Nations in Paris, yesterday (November 20th), which read: To Mr. Aristide Briand, Chairman of the League of Nations in Paris: The League of Nations has been striving for peace on the Manchurian issue, and we admire it immensely. Japan is invading with force, hoping to seize rights, and is plotting to establish a Manchurian independent local government, directly destroying Chinese sovereignty. If it is not sanctioned, it will inevitably lead to war. We hope that you will preside over peace, so as to avoid China's division. The world's practical interests depend on it. Shanghai Banking Association, Ge.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Fourth Army Requests to Join the Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei Knows His Determination</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui Will Surely Fulfill His Promise</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth Army, telegraphed both the Ning and Guangdong sides the other day, requesting to join the war to kill the enemy. Yesterday, reporters from various news agencies visited Wang Jingwei at his residence to ask for his opinion. According to the discussion: (Reporter asked) How did the delegation respond to General Zhang Fakui's telegram requesting to go to Heilongjiang to help Ma fight against Japan? (Answer) Our country should regard Japan's current atrocities as a blatant robbery. On the one hand, we should defend ourselves properly, and on the other hand, we should call for help from our neighbors. This is the right and obligation that the country should have. Ma Zhanshan was able to wash away the great shame of so-called "non-resistance" with a solitary army, which is enough to win back the personality of the nation. I have been through thick and thin with Zhang Xianghua for a long time, and I have always known his loyalty, courage, and righteousness. Recently, I have been visiting him in Shanghai frequently, and I know that his determination is not just for today. All the officers and soldiers of the Fourth Army can also have the same determination as Zhang Xianghua. I dare to say that he will surely fulfill his promise, not only to strengthen the momentum of Ma Zhanshan's army, but also to make the soldiers of the whole country rise up in succession. Now, on the one hand, it is necessary to wait for the approval of the Guangzhou government, and on the other hand, it is necessary to wait for the Nanjing government to allow it to pass without obstruction. Therefore, Xianghua's telegram was sent to the delegations of both sides. I dare to believe that the delegations of both sides will be happy to make it happen.</p>
<h3>Responses to Zhang Fakui's Request to Join the War</h3>
<p>(Telegram 1) Shen Bao to the Comrades of the Whole Country: The national crisis is urgent, and the Japanese bandits are deep. General Ma Zhanshan has already shown his bravery with a solitary army, and Comrade Zhang Fakui has requested to join the war to provide assistance. We are pained by the non-recovery of the party's foundation, and we are even more saddened by the impending national demise. How dare we not overcome all difficulties and sacrifice everything to follow Comrade Zhang Fakui to assist the army of Ma Zhanshan and Zhang, and not recover the territory, even if we die at the gate of the country. We are sharpening our swords and waiting, and we will not forget the three households of Chu and will be the five hundred of Tian Heng. The national crisis has not been relieved, and the party's foundation has not been recovered. We sincerely express our words and hope to be heard. China National Party Alliance for the Protection of the Party and National Salvation. (official seal).</p>
<p>(Telegram 2) Shanghai Shen Shi News Agency to all newspapers: We recently sent a telegram to Mr. Hu Zhantang Wang Jingwei in Shanghai, which read: Dear sirs, Yesterday, I read General Zhang Fakui's urgent telegram requesting assistance to Heilongjiang. His loyalty to the country is evident in his words. He is worthy of the history of the Iron Army and can demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. The righteousness you have established is admired by the whole world. You are veterans of the party and the country, and you are the hope of the people of Beijing and Guangdong. You will definitely not sit idly by and watch the nation perish, and be the same as those who advocate non-resistance and become cheap captives of a conquered country. You should quickly transfer the Fourth Army to the Guangdong government, and go to Chahar via Changyue, Xunping, and Zhangsui to attack the rear of Taonan and relieve the siege of Nenjiang. Even if you cannot eliminate the ugly captives and recover all the lost territory, you will be able to punish the rebels and revitalize the spirit of our country. All the expenses for departure and supplies will be happily donated by our patriotic compatriots. I hope you will follow public opinion and make a decisive decision to save the nation from peril and maintain its existence. I sincerely ask for your unanimous request to save the nation from disaster. Wu County Dou Bao Weekly Society (signed).</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang to Go North</h3>
<p>Standing at the National Front Line</p>
<p>Recovering Lost Territory and National Rights</p>
<p>Various Circles Send Telegrams in Support</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, who went to Beijing to attend the Fourth National Congress, telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce earlier because General Ma Zhanshan's isolated army was fighting hard to defend the territory for the country. He asked the chamber to quickly work with the banking and money industries to raise funds and remit them. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce immediately raised and advanced 10,000 yuan and announced the fundraising. As of yesterday, more than 33,000 yuan had been raised. At the same time, a telegram was sent back to Wang, informing him of the fundraising progress and requesting him to promptly request the central government to send reinforcements. Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter and telegram from Wang from Beijing, the original texts of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang's Reply Letter: Respectfully opening, I have just received your telegram with respect and full understanding. Fellow members of the business community have gathered funds and remitted them to Heilongjiang to support General Ma Zhanshan. Their enthusiastic contributions are second to none. Their patriotic enthusiasm is deeply admired. As entrusted, I have earnestly requested the central government to send a large army to provide substantial assistance. I have already made a factual petition and request you to release your concerns. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Wang Yansong, respectfully. November 18th.</p>
<p>Wang's Reply Telegram: To the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: Your telegram regarding the factual petition has been received with full understanding. The central government deeply appreciates the donation to assist Heilongjiang. The request to promptly send a large army to substantially assist Ma has also been adopted. Chairman Chiang has also expressed his determination to achieve unity and actively confront Japan. He is about to go north, stand at the national front line, recover lost territory, and protect national rights. Especially conveyed, Wang Yansong respectfully greets you.</p>
<p>Tea Room Workers' Union Telegram: The Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Tea Room Workers' Union telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday, saying: To His Excellency Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government: The Japanese bandits are wreaking havoc and invading our Northeast. Deputy Commander Zhang possesses an army of 100,000 soldiers and bears the heavy responsibility of defending the territory, but he lightly speaks of non-resistance, allowing thousands of miles of land to be lost in a single day, setting a precedent unprecedented in the founding of the nation and leaving endless humiliation to the nation. Now the violent Japanese are again pouring all their efforts into attacking Heilongjiang, relying solely on our General Ma to bravely resist with a small force. His loyalty and greatness will shine through the ages. However, the isolated army in a remote corner was defeated due to running out of ammunition and reinforcements. Qiqihar fell, and Heilongjiang Province was lost. The bad news has arrived, and tears of blood have gushed forth. The national newspaper reported that Your Excellency has resolutely decided to go north and serve the country. Upon hearing this news, I was deeply moved and wept. I still implore Your Excellency to promptly travel north, command the large army, rescue Heilongjiang, and implement military force to recover lost territory, using the spirit of iron and blood to protect our land. Our union is willing to lead all its members to wholeheartedly support you and vow to be your rearguard. In this urgent telegram, I am filled with indignation and eagerly await the good news. The Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Tea Room Workers' Union respectfully greets you.</p>
<p>Unified Society of Reason and Religion Telegram: The Unified Society of Reason and Religion telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang of the Nanjing Army, Navy, and Air Force, saying: The national crisis is at hand, and the sparks of national salvation are emerging. Liaoning and Jilin have already been lost, and Heilongjiang is following suit. The Northeast territory is about to be completely lost. The disastrous news has spread, and the people are heartbroken and indignant. Loving the country is loving oneself. Your Excellency's saving the country is saving the nation, which is fulfilling your duty. Now that Your Excellency has reported to the Fourth Plenary Session your intention to go north and save the country, the whole country is in admiration. Your Excellency's loyalty to the party and the country demonstrates your determination to coexist with the nation. Our society has always believed in this and has never questioned it. We earnestly hope that with the spirit of fighting to the death, you will quickly save the nation from danger. Relying on this one action, our society is willing to lead thousands of societies of reason and religion and hundreds of thousands of members, based on the principle that everyone is responsible for the survival of the nation, to be the government's rearguard. The urgent telegram expresses the utmost expectation. Zhang Yichen, Honorary Chairman of the Shanghai Unified Society of Reason and Religion, and all committee members respectfully greet you, with seals.</p>
<p>Wuben Girls' High School Telegram: Teachers and staff of Wuben Girls' High School telegraphed Chairman Chiang, saying: To His Excellency Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government: Recalling that you raised the banner in Shaoguan and swore to start the Northern Expedition, pacifying the rebels and eliminating the communists, with the spirit of great fearlessness, continuing the legacy of the Premier, settling the chaos, the whole world admired you. Recently, the violent Japanese invaded and occupied the Eastern Provinces. Everyone shared the same hatred of the enemy and was indignant. Ma Zhanshan resisted the Japanese with an isolated army, fighting hard for weeks, but running out of food and reinforcements, the northeastern border regions fell into the hands of the violent Japanese. The people of the whole country are even more indignant. To recover lost territory, the government has long established a policy, which is the time for soldiers to serve and for you to repay the country. We beg you to quickly send troops to resist and consolidate the territory, and do not sit back and delay again, causing damage to the overall plan. The Japanese conspiracy, Puyi's ambitions, and all actions should be closely monitored, and it should be declared to China and foreign countries to clearly deny them. The atmosphere at the League of Nations meeting is tense, and if rights and interests are damaged, we must strive for them. Since the opening of the plenary session, these issues have been discussed, and we hope that you will make a decisive decision and face the national crisis together. The people should remain calm, and the government should have a long-term plan. Otherwise, the ambitions of the violent Japanese will become increasingly blatant, and the tragedy of national subjugation is imminent. On the day we heard about the fall of Heilongjiang Province, all the teachers and students of our school were filled with righteous indignation and cried out in grief, vowing to save the country from destruction and fulfill our duty. We present these weeping words and beg for your consideration. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Shanghai Municipal Wuben Girls' High School respectfully greets you.</p>

<h3>Women's National Salvation Alliance Commemorates Compatriots Who Died in the Disaster</h3>
<p>Telegraphs Soong Ching-ling and Others, Requesting the Announcement of Six National Salvation Plans</p>
<p>Li Guanfang, Huang Shaolan, and Others Give Enthusiastic Speeches</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., the Shanghai Women's National Salvation Alliance held a memorial service for compatriots who died in the internal chaos and foreign aggression in the five-story building of the Women's Bank. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Scene at the Meeting: Attendees included representatives from Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School, the Women's Political Participation Association, the Women's Temperance Association, the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School, Huiqun Girls' High School, the Law and Politics College, the Shanghai North Public School, Daozhong Girls' School, the Women's Relief Association, the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association, Huahua Middle School, Guangzhao Girls' Elementary School, Qinye Girls' School, Cihang Midwifery, and Shanghai Girls' High School, totaling approximately 300 people. The atmosphere was very tense. There were more than 100 pairs of elegiac scrolls. Among them, the elegiac couplet written by Ms. Li Guanfang, director of the Women's Education Monthly of the Guangxue Association, was tragic in tone, stating: "With teeth and tongue still remaining, the youth should emulate Zhang Suiyang and Yan Changshan and rise up; with the heart suffering from illness, the Fourth Plenary Session hopes to bring along the ancient Bian Que and Qin Yihuan to alleviate it." The elegiac couplet from the Women's National Salvation Alliance stated: "Alas for the turbulence in the Central Plains, the masses are sacrificed." Ms. Wang Xiaoying wrote: "Seizing land and fighting for cities, exterminating enemies and destroying bandits, sacrificing oneself for righteousness, donating one's life for the country." The Liangjiang Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association wrote: "Protect our rivers and mountains, complete our nation, lead the way, all you martyrs, repel those mad bandits, kill those Japanese devils, who else will follow?" The Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School wrote: "Loyalty and bravery are the best in the three armies, let him have strong armor and sharp weapons, only the righteous army is invincible, fight to the death on the battlefield, so that the strong neighbors and stubborn bandits know that the Chinese people have people."</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: The chairman of the meeting was Mao Wang Ruizhu, and the recorder was Zhang Zhixue. After the meeting began and the rituals were performed, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, briefly stating that today's memorial service is for compatriots who suffered from floods in the interior of the country and disasters in the Northeast. Their deaths were mostly unnatural and were the most pitiful and tragic in the world. This also means that the government has neither the responsibility to protect them nor the strategy for national defense, resulting in so many innocent deaths. How can we not be heartbroken? Today's meeting is to mourn the dead on one hand and encourage the living on the other, etc. Next, Ms. Huang Shaolan, principal of Bowen Girls' High School, and Ms. Li Guanfang gave lengthy, enthusiastic, and sorrowful speeches.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: Next, Ms. Yang Xizhen, principal of the Chinese and Western Girls' School, presented flowers, and the entire audience observed three minutes of silence to mourn the dead compatriots. Then, Ms. Li Guanfang was invited to speak, briefly stating that today's meeting can be said to be unprecedented. Today, we are mourning the dead compatriots and thinking about how to save the country. In the past, on the day of national subjugation, women could only die with it. Now, men and women have equal rights, and no one can shirk responsibility. Now, the country is in danger of imminent collapse. We must know that in the first war with Japan, we had to win. Victory would raise our country's position, but even if we were defeated, we could still exist. Brave men must take up guns and go to the front line, sacrificing themselves for the country. Women must also take on the responsibility of rear support, cooperating and working together. We must do our best wherever we can. Even if we have no weapons, we still have tongues to shout with. Everyone must know that the Qing Dynasty did not fall to revolution but to words. Therefore, the people of the Republic of China are not afraid of having no soldiers. As long as they have pens, there is hope. Therefore, before the anti-Japanese work of boycotting Japanese goods, there is still much work to be done. Everyone must think of ways, have determination, and cooperate. The most important thing is not to rely on the League of Nations but to lie down and taste the gall ourselves. Everyone must know that the so-called gall now is not really gall but just a few minutes of restraint like the suffering of being examined as a student. We have never tasted gall. Now that the Northeast has fallen, it is like the former Korea falling. In the future, the Central Plains will also fall. How can we willingly endure the pain of national subjugation? My compatriots only have determination and do their best for the country, preparing to dedicate themselves to the country, etc. Next, Ms. Huang Shaolan spoke, roughly stating that we should understand that the current national government is our national government. We, the people, should take responsibility and supervise the government. Today, men and women have reached an equal status, and we must not give up our responsibility as women. The five conditions proposed by Japan this time, the most important of which is to permanently stop the anti-Japanese movement. Even if the national government can recognize it, we cannot recognize it and vow not to live a life of slavery, etc. Then, Mr. Zhu Qingbo and Ms. Liu Shuzhao, a representative from Daxia University, were invited to speak (details omitted). Finally, everyone shouted slogans and dispersed. In addition, in the name of the Great Alliance, telegrams were sent to Song Qingling, Soong Mei-ling, Zhang Mojun, and other committee members, requesting the government to announce a national salvation policy. The original telegram is as follows: To the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, transferred to Soong Ching-ling, Soong Mei-ling, Zhang Mojun, and other committee members for your consideration. The National Government did not send troops to aid Ma Zhanshan, causing the people to be disappointed by the loss of territory. Today's memorial service for compatriots who died in the internal chaos and foreign aggression is filled with grief and indignation. We urge the government to announce a national salvation policy to reassure the people. Seal of the Women's National Salvation Alliance.</p>
<h3>Opposing the Lifting of the Ban on Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Seventh District Party Department Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>The Seventh District Party Department issued a declaration opposing the lifting of the ban on Japanese goods, stating: "The Japanese invaders are oppressing us, and the whole country is indignant. Anyone with a conscience cannot but plan to resist. Economic severance is the only effective way to achieve national shame. We should carefully plan and formulate measures and resolutely implement them to achieve practical results. However, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's measures for disposing of and sealing Japanese goods, as determined by the Committee for Implementing Economic Severance with Japan, are not only unsuitable for the above requirements but also contain many errors, which are infuriating to read. Now, we will point out the errors. For example, the first measure determined by the committee states: 'Those who have registered with the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association and have been verified will be stamped piece by piece by the committee, given a sales permit, and allowed to be sold.' If it is carried out as determined, then how can we talk about severance? The act of boycotting exists in name only. Because before each boycott of Japanese goods, merchants, seeking profits, often rush to import large quantities of Japanese goods early. Now that unlimited sales are allowed, there is no need to worry about the supply of enemy goods to the market for several months. By the time the stock is almost exhausted, the boycott will disappear invisibly, and then a large amount of enemy goods can be imported. This is why the statistics of the Japanese export trade show us that before the boycott, the import of enemy goods to us must increase greatly, and after the boycott stops, the import of enemy goods to us must also increase. Roughly speaking, the actual amount of enemy goods dumped is not affected by the boycott at all. Now, we are still repeating the same mistakes. This is the first error in this measure. Furthermore, the so-called 'stamping piece by piece by the committee' in the same measure is also prone to malpractice. Because there is no one to supervise during sales, and the stamps are difficult for ordinary people to distinguish, it can create an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to seek profit by forging stamps and pushing as many enemy goods as possible. This is another error in this measure. Furthermore, the third measure, 'Goods handled in accordance with Article 2, which have been verified by the committee or the industry association, and have been issued a sales permit, are allowed to be sold,' and the fourth measure, 'Goods imported after September 18, if they have a pass from the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association, are allowed to be sold; otherwise, they will all be sent to the committee, and the committee will sell them publicly on a regular basis, and 60% of the proceeds will be returned to the merchants,' it is even more incomprehensible why the traitors are treated so favorably. Since the Japanese atrocities have begun, and the announcement of the economic severance with Japan is to implement severance, how can there be such erroneous regulations? It is truly incomprehensible. Moreover, this measure for disposing of and sealing Japanese goods should be decided and implemented by the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, but the committee has handled it without authorization, which is suspected of undermining the anti-Japanese cause. Are you, the gentlemen of the Committee for Implementing Economic Severance with Japan, so fond of money that you do not know that there is a nation and a country? Do you also know who the Eastern Provinces have fallen to, and have you heard the cries of those who are suffering from national disasters and displacement? Have you also considered it with your children and grandchildren? If you do not think of this but seek copper stench, then you are traitors to the nation, and everyone has the right to punish you. We deeply hope that all citizens will rise up and correct it."</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Asks to Prohibit the Use of Japanese Matches: The Sui Sheng Matches are indeed Japanese goods. The Anti-Japanese Association issued a notice yesterday prohibiting citizens from using them. The notice stated: "For the purpose of notification, the case of the Anti-Japanese Association seizing the red lead powder transported by the Sui Sheng Match Company to Zhenjiang has been investigated by the association. According to the report, the goods are indeed Japanese goods, but the company is a Sino-Japanese joint venture, and the Japanese control the power. The owner is Kenshiro Ueda. The goods are transported by the Sui Sheng Company to the Zhenjiang factory for manufacturing, and the factory is the Sui Sheng Manufacturing Factory. The 21st Standing Committee of the association has decided to notify all citizens not to use the matches produced by the Sui Sheng Company. Therefore, we hereby notify all citizens to prohibit the use of matches produced by the Sui Sheng Company. This is of utmost importance."</p>

<p>Chinese Medicine Association Notifies Members Not to Use Japanese Medicine: The Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association notified all members yesterday, stating: "Respectfully opening, the Japanese bandits are wreaking havoc and occupying our three provinces. The national crisis is imminent, and the country will be destroyed soon. Anyone with blood cannot but be furious. In addition to the positive aspects being organized and carried out by government agencies and anti-Japanese organizations, our association is also organizing battlefield rescue teams. In the negative aspects, in order to fulfill our national duty and protect the lifeline of the country, we should use domestic goods as much as possible and especially abstain from Japanese goods. It has been found that Chinese herbal medicine such as Fang Tong Cao (i.e., Sichuan Tong Cao) and Zi Bei Chi are completely Japanese goods. Except for Fang Tong Cao, which can be replaced by our domestic Geng Tong Cao, Bei Chi can be discarded and not used. Other Japanese goods are still under detailed investigation. Once they are found out, we will continue to notify you. In addition, the prescription paper you use should be stamped with the eight characters 'Boycott Japanese Goods to Save the Country' to encourage patients to take consistent action."</p>
<p>County Party Department Distributes Map of Japanese Aggression: In order to make all sectors understand the actual situation of the violent Japanese invasion of our Northeast, the Shanghai County Party Department has purchased hundreds of copies of the Map of Japanese Aggression of Our Northeast from the Ri Xin Yu Di Xue She at No. 19 Baolong Fang, Albert Road, and distributed them to all levels of schools in the county for application. The maps are now being sent to the district offices for distribution, and schools have been notified to collect them.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchant's Printed Workers Went on Strike Yesterday: The Chinese Rubber Printing Company (Color Printing) in Gao Lang Qiao, Pudong, is operated by the Japanese, employing more than 300 Chinese male and female workers. The treatment is poor, and the wages are low. Recently, due to the East Province incident, the Japanese were angry at the Chinese people's firm anti-Japanese stance and greatly oppressed the Chinese workers. Yesterday, they dismissed more than 110 male and female workers and set up machine guns in the factory. All the workers were furious at the sight and went on strike yesterday afternoon. It is said that they will hold a general meeting at 9 a.m. today at the address of a certain cotton weaving workers' union to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Yesterday There Were Two Telegrams of Condolence to Ma</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Association of Unemployed Soldiers: The Association of Unemployed Soldiers telegraphed Ma Zhanshan, saying: "To President Ma of Heilongjiang, Keshan: The violent Japanese are pressing the border, and the general is resisting with an isolated army, fighting for the glory of the country, the personality of the people, and the magnificence of the rivers and mountains. Your divine power has been spread far and wide, and the whole world admires you. Although you are outnumbered and temporarily retreating to Keshan, we still hope that you will encourage your brave soldiers and defend the defense line. We are ashamed to be soldiers, and although we are unemployed, our hearts are with the border. We should go to the front line and share the life and death of the country.

<h3>Japanese Illegally Arrest Overseas Chinese Returning Home</h3>

<p>The Japanese ships Nagasaki Maru and Rokko Maru, which sail between Japan and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai one after another yesterday afternoon from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. and were berthed at the Huishan Wharf. However, when the ships berthed, several secret agents claiming to be from the Japanese Consulate, holding photos, inspected Chinese passengers one by one, claiming that they were following a telegram from the Japanese government stating that a large number of Chinese who were promoting anti-Japanese sentiment were arriving in Shanghai by ship, and instructing them to carefully inspect and compare the passengers to arrest them. As a result, one person was arrested on the Nagasaki Maru and four people, including Wang, were arrested on the Rokko Maru. Although they argued with reason at the time, the Japanese agents were armed with pistols and sharp blades, and the situation was fierce. The arrested people, intimidated by their power, had no choice but to follow them.</p>

<h3>The Great Xia University Student Donation Team Was Brutally Beaten and Arrested by Japanese</h3>
<p>Four Teams Were Humiliated and Beaten by Japanese Patrols</p>
<p>Release Was Secured Through Negotiations with the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The donation teams from various universities in this city, which set out the day before yesterday to raise funds to be remitted north to aid General Ma Zhanshan, included over a thousand students from Great Xia University. Yesterday, they divided into teams to solicit donations. Unexpectedly, four teams of students from the university were brutally beaten and arrested by the Japanese Marine Corps patrol. As a result, over a dozen students were injured. The circumstances are recorded below:</p>
<p>Route Robert　Yesterday afternoon, over ten Great Xia University students were soliciting donations along Route Robert when several Japanese patrolmen, driving by in a car, suddenly accused the students of insulting the Japanese. They got out of the car and brutally beat the students, who all scattered and fled. As a result, one student was illegally arrested by the patrolmen and taken to the nearby Japanese-owned Toyota Textile Factory (where a Japanese patrol team is stationed). Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau dispatched a patrol officer to negotiate, and the Public Security Bureau also contacted the Japanese side by telephone, eventually securing the student's release.</p>
<p>Connaught Road　Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, over twenty students from the Great Xia Education Institute, including Yan Linrong, were soliciting donations at the intersection of Connaught Road and the Chinese Concession. A Japanese military transport vehicle passed by. Over thirty Japanese soldiers in the vehicle immediately ordered the driver to stop, jumped out, intercepted the Great Xia University students into two groups, beat up six or seven students in one group, and arrested one student. They then crossed into the Chinese territory and beat up the other group of students. The students scattered and fled and reported to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, which dispatched a patrol officer to negotiate with the Japanese, eventually securing the release of one student.</p>
<p>Caojiadu　Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a Japanese patrol team drove to the intersection of Caojiadu and the Chinese Concession. Seeing Great Xia University students soliciting donations in the Chinese territory, the Japanese patrol team stopped the car, crossed the border, and drove forward to drive away and beat up the students. One student was beaten and injured and arrested and taken to a certain Japanese textile factory nearby. Great Xia University students petitioned the municipal government, requesting the Public Security Bureau to negotiate, and the student was released.</p>
<p>Xinzha Road　In the Xinzha Road area, Great Xia University students were also soliciting donations along the road. Yesterday afternoon, a Japanese patrol team passed by and brutally beat them, arresting five or six students and handing them over to the Xinzha police station, claiming that the students had made insulting remarks. The police station detained all the students. It is reported that they have been released.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Expresses His Views　Yesterday (November 20) at 5:00 PM, over twenty representatives from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association of university students in this city and five representatives from Great Xia University students went to the municipal government to petition regarding the incident at 2:00 PM this afternoon when Japanese Marine Corps soldiers drove away our donation students in front of the Shanghai West Connaught Road Bus Company and took a Great Xia University student to the branch of the Japanese-owned Toyota Textile Factory. Mayor Zhang personally received them, inquired about their intentions, and immediately informed them that the municipal government had received a report of the incident and had already had the Public Security Bureau negotiate the return of the arrested students and send them back to the university. The representatives expressed their satisfaction but requested the municipal government to seriously negotiate for (1) compensation, (2) an apology, and (3) a guarantee that such incidents would not occur again in the future. Mayor Zhang replied that he would investigate and handle the matter and hoped that the circumstances at the time would be reported to the municipal government in writing so that they could be used as a basis for negotiation based on the facts. The representatives also asked how the security of this city would be guaranteed. Mayor Zhang replied that the Municipal Government Public Security Bureau was of course responsible for the security of this city, and the Garrison Command also bore the same responsibility. Moreover, Mr. Chen Mingshu, newly appointed by the Central Government as the Commander of the Songhu Garrison, and the 19th Route Army, part of which had already arrived in Shanghai yesterday, with the cooperation of the military and police to maintain it, the security of Shanghai could be guaranteed without worry. The representatives also asked whether they would resist if an unfortunate incident similar to Shenyang occurred in Shanghai. Mayor Zhang replied that they would certainly do their best to take legitimate defense methods and would never abandon their responsibilities. The representatives were all satisfied. Mayor Zhang also earnestly said that students are important members of the intellectual class and have the responsibility to lead the masses. All patriotic movements should strictly abide by order and not overstep the boundaries, and should not cause disputes with unconscious actions. In particular, it is necessary to strictly prevent reactionary elements from using public opinion or using the name of school students to take the opportunity to make trouble. The municipal government expresses great sympathy for the patriotic movement, but it must ban overstepping behavior. If everyone can do their best to jointly maintain the security of Shanghai, each should bear their corresponding responsibilities to prevent accidents, then the security can be believed to be permanently maintained, and there will be no other worries. The representatives then happily left.</p>
<h3>Jinan Airplane Accident Shanghai News</h3>
<p>Two Pilots Killed</p>
<p>Xu Zhimo Also Died</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Jinan aircraft, flying the Beijing-Ping Line, crashed in the vicinity of Dangjia Village, Jinan, on the 19th due to fog. The aircraft was completely destroyed, and the pilot Wang Guanyi, co-pilot Liang Bitang, and passenger Xu Zhimo all died simultaneously. The reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited the company and the Xu residence yesterday. The collected information is recorded below:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Accident　The Jinan aircraft departed from Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 19th, carrying over 40 pounds of mail, piloted by pilot Wang Guanyi and co-pilot Liang Bitang, with only Peking University professor Xu Zhimo as a passenger, intending to go to Beiping. The aircraft arrived in Xuzhou at 10:10 AM and continued flying north from Xuzhou at 10:20 AM. The weather was very good at the time. Unexpectedly, when the aircraft arrived near Dangjia Village, 50 miles from Jinan, it suddenly encountered dense fog and could not advance or retreat, causing it to crash into a mountain top and overturn. The aircraft body caught fire, and the oil spilled everywhere, causing a raging fire that could not be stopped. Pilot Wang Guanyi, Liang Bitang, and passenger Xu Zhimo all died simultaneously.</p>
<p>Handling the Aftermath　After the incident, it was discovered by the Tianjin-Pukou Railway police, who immediately reported it to the stationmaster. The stationmaster then notified the company's Jinan office, which in turn telegraphed the company. After receiving the telegram yesterday morning, the company immediately dispatched American pilot An Lissen by plane to Beijing, and then transferred to the Tianjin-Pukou train to rush to the scene of the accident to investigate the truth in order to handle the aftermath. The company also notified the Xu residence. The Xu residence, on the one hand, let the company handle the aftermath on its behalf, and on the other hand, had Mr. Zhang Gongquan, a relative of Xu, send personnel from the Central Bank to handle everything.</p>
<p>Company Losses　The Jinan aircraft was a Stinson-type aircraft, purchased from the United States in the 18th year by the Rong-Hu Aviation Administration, with 350 horsepower and a speed of 90 miles per hour. It was only fitted with a new engine this year and had just completed test flights two months ago. Unexpectedly, it encountered heavy fog and crashed, the parts were completely destroyed and could not be repaired. The loss, excluding mail, totaled more than 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Xu's Brief History　Xu Zhimo was quite famous in the literary world and is currently a professor at Peking University. He took the Beijing-Ping Line aircraft to Shanghai last week to visit his wife, Ms. Lu Xiaoman. The couple's affection was extraordinary. After only five or six days, he hurriedly planned to return due to the mess of teaching affairs. Unexpectedly, he suffered this disaster. When the company's news was conveyed to the Xu residence, Ms. Lu once fainted. Xu lived with Ms. Lu's mother, the old Mrs. Lu. According to what the old Mrs. Lu told people, Xu's taking the aircraft was because the company's guarantor, Mr. Jun Jian, quickly arranged for him to take it, and the ticket was also given by the company. When she said this, she also seemed resentful.</p>

<h3>Flood Relief Association Solicits Donations from Major Landlords</h3>
<p>Unable to Bear Watching Flood Relief Efforts Still End in Filling Ravines</p>
<p>The Shanghai Association for Raising Emergency Relief Funds for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces, with Xu Shiying, Zhang Zhijiang, Wang Zhen, Zhu Qinglan, Huang Qinglan, Qu Yingguang, Ye Kaixin, Li Zuyu, Wu Zhihao, Wu Yunzhai, and others as signatories, sent letters to major landlords in this city, saying: "Respectfully, disaster has struck China, and floods have caused havoc. The Yangtze, Huai, and Yellow Rivers have successively burst their banks, resulting in countless deaths and homes reduced to ruins. Moved by conscience and doing our best, we have established this association for nearly four months. Fortunately, with the energetic support of various places and sectors, we have managed to make donations that are like giving a penny for a life. All donations, relief goods, and the situation of distribution and allocation to various provinces and cities have been published in newspapers for your information. However, the disaster area is too wide, the disaster situation is too severe, and the number of victims is too large. Emergency relief has been difficult to provide comprehensively. With the arrival of severe winter, wind and cold are intertwined, and hunger and cold are intertwined, making the suffering even worse. Alas, our victims, if not rescued, will surely die, and delayed rescue is also death. If we do not quickly raise huge funds and urgently distribute them, there will be nothing left. The association's provincial relief workers have dedicated themselves to entering the disaster area, witnessing the tragic situation with their own eyes, and repeatedly reporting through letters and telegrams, face-to-face reports, every word a tear, unable to bear hearing. Furthermore, local groups and people in the disaster-stricken areas have successively reported, painfully describing their suffering, making it even more unbearable to hear. After repeated meetings and discussions, everyone agreed that anyone with blood and breath cannot sit idly by and watch their compatriots freeze and starve to death. To thoroughly relieve the disaster, we should continue to lend a helping hand. Therefore, the association has decided to rush to provide winter relief to save the dying victims. Unexpectedly, the violent Japanese are running rampant, extinguishing humanity, sharing the psychological burden of saving the country with the psychological burden of saving the disaster, and saving the disaster is slackened. Strength is divided and weakened, and the mind is shaken and disintegrated. However, we believe that in this time of internal and external troubles, we still adhere to the principle of saving the country by saving the people first. As long as there is a breath, this determination will not waver. Moreover, since this association is a people's organization, how can it be without end, and not to the end, and make the rescued victims still fill the ravines? How will we face the previous donors and show the spirit of mutual rescue of our nation? Therefore, at the fourth plenary meeting of the executive committee on the 14th of this month, we all agreed that the victims' lifeline depends on this association. No matter how difficult it is, we must not be discouraged in the slightest, so as not to cut off the victims' chance of survival. Therefore, we jointly decided to appeal to major landlords to donate one or two months' rent to save the surviving people after the catastrophe. Check rent assistance to aid relief, has long been the major landlords initiate and promote, its donated one month to two months, after the festival has been published in newspapers thanks, benevolent voice broadcast, far and near with admiration. Although the input will have priority, good is not divided early and late, the same path to the same goal, success is one. We know that you are compassionate and tireless in giving, and we are especially dedicated to writing to plead for your help, and beg to pay it to this association in advance, so as to complete the disaster relief work, but also for you to create immeasurable merit. Mercy is in sight, looking forward to benevolence."</p>
<h3>Taikoo Hanyang Ship Robbed by Pirates in Xiamen Waters</h3>
<p>Pirates Mistakenly Believed There Was a Large Sum of Money on Board</p>
<p>Dressed in Western Suits to Blend into the Ship</p>
<p>When No Cash Was Found, They Plundered Passengers</p>
<p>The Exact Amount of Losses Has Not Yet Been Ascertained</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship, which sailed from Shanghai to Xiamen and Guangzhou, was attacked by pirates en route, resulting in huge losses. The pirates attempted to rob the ship, mistakenly believing that it was carrying a large sum of money, so they disguised themselves as passengers and hid in the various cabins, and then started at the destination. The reporter went to various parties yesterday to describe the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Transporting Huge Sums of Money Sparked Pirate Intentions　Since the 19th of last month, Shanghai's money industry has shipped a large amount of cash, over 5.8 million yuan, to Dalian Bay, all entrusted to the Taikoo ship agency. The last batch was transported on the 16th of this month, totaling 2.85 million yuan, which was loaded onto the Zhejiang ship to Dalian, and over 600,000 yuan was loaded onto the Ganzhou ship to Yantai, all boarded at the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession. When the huge sum of money was loaded onto the ship, it was seen by pirates, who then conceived the idea of robbery. The robbery of the Hanyang ship was caused by this. The ship company, after transporting it six times, all were safe and sound, so they were calm and did not mind.</p>
<p>Three Ships Departed Together　The Zhejiang, Ganzhou, and Hanyang ships were all parked in one place, head to tail, and loaded goods at the same time. The Ganzhou ship sailed on the 16th, and the Zhejiang and Hanyang ships both left Shanghai on the 17th. The three ships had different export routes, the Ganzhou and Zhejiang went to the North Sea, and the Hanyang was to South China. The pirates coveted this huge sum of money and planned to rob it, so they disguised themselves as passengers and mixed into the ship to plunder it. Unexpectedly, they mistakenly boarded a ship, and the huge sum of money was preserved.</p>
<p>Robbed in Xiamen Waters　The Hanyang ship left Shanghai on the morning of the 17th. The pirates had already disguised themselves as passengers and mixed into the ship. This time, there were 15 pirates boarding in Shanghai, each carrying a pistol. Moreover, the attire of the bandits was very beautiful. They were all wearing fashionable Western suits and living in various cabins, so no one suspected them. On the afternoon of the 19th, when the ship arrived at the outer harbor of Xiamen, they saw that the destination had arrived, and with a shout, each came out of the cabin, holding guns to the cabin, first occupying the main roads, and then monitoring the master, second deputy, and drivers, etc., and the bandits forced the crew to hand over the huge sum of money transported in the ship.</p>
<p>Greatly Disappointed with No Cash　The bandit leader pointed the gun at the chest of the second deputy and forced him to hand over the large amount of cash carried in the ship, otherwise he would open fire. At that time, the second deputy told the pirates that the ship was not loaded with cash, and all were goods. The bandits still did not believe it. The second deputy allowed the manifest to be read to gain trust. At this point, the bandits realized that they had boarded the wrong ship and showed disappointment, but since they had already robbed it, how could they give up? So they drove the crew into a room and began to rob.</p>
<p>Rob Passengers and Loot Goods　In disappointment, the bandits began to search and rob, first searching and robbing the passengers in the ship one by one. All the money, clothes, and ornaments they brought were robbed. The bandits were still not satisfied, and reopened the cargo hold, and took some of the more valuable goods. The number of losses has not yet been known. After the search and robbery, the bandits released sampans, carried the stolen goods, and escaped into the sea.</p>
<p>The Master Telegraphed Hong Kong and Shanghai　After the pirates escaped, the detained master and crew were finally able to come out, reorganize, and immediately reported to the Hong Kong head office by radio, stating that they had encountered robbers on the way. The Hong Kong office then telegraphed to report to Shanghai. Now the Hanyang ship has gone to Xiamen, but the telegram is simple, and the money and goods robbed are not stated. It also does not say whether anyone was injured during the robbery, and whether the passengers were kidnapped when they were taken away. Yesterday, the Shanghai office has sent a telegram to inquire, and the detailed situation may be known today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Rogues Gathered to Forcefully Demand Scrap Iron</h3>
<p>The Inspection Office Extremely Tolerant</p>
<p>Fortunately, No Disputes Occurred</p>
<p>The Zhabei Inspection Branch and Custody Branch of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Inspection Department on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, detained the scrap iron sold by the Japanese-Chinese Textile Factory to Xiangchang Foreign Firm after anti-Japanese personnel inspected it on the Huangpu River on the 17th of this month. Because this item was quite suspicious, it actually contained other dangerous functions. At that time, the detained scrap iron was stored in the Zhabei branch on Zhongxing Road, pending disposal. After this incident occurred, the Japanese in charge of the sale of scrap iron were not satisfied. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they gathered with 30 or 40 Japanese rogues, some wearing Western suits and some wearing Chinese clothes, holding wooden sticks and other items, and rushed to the Zhabei branch. First, one Japanese person went inside to negotiate with the staff of the branch, demanding the return of the detained scrap iron. He was aggressive. Because the staff in the office did not agree, the Japanese asked for it again and again, but to no avail, so he left angrily, and then accompanied three Japanese people to enter and forcefully demand the detained scrap iron, with an even more forceful attitude. Seeing that the situation was not good, the office secretly reported to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, and the bureau sent many police officers to the office. At this time, the Public Security Bureau also received news and telephoned the Japanese Consulate, informing it of the details. The police station of the consulate immediately sent two officials to accompany the police officers of the Public Security Bureau. When they arrived, many people had already dispersed. Only four Japanese people were left. The police officers of the Public Security Bureau and the two officials of the Japanese consulate accompanied the four Japanese people to the Fifth District, and after inquiring about the truth, the names of the four Japanese rogues were Changze Guoyi, Hosoya Nara, Nakamura Kinichi, and Nakamura Ryokichi, all residing at No. 60, Xingyefang, Shigaota Road. The officials of the Japanese consulate sent them to the Japanese consulate for disposal, so no major dispute occurred. The Public Security Bureau also hopes that the Japanese consulate must advise the Japanese people that if they encounter the Anti-Japanese Association mistakenly detaining Japanese goods, they must report to the Japanese consulate, and the Japanese consulate will negotiate with the Chinese side, and there must be no illegal actions.</p>
<h3>Record of the Interrogation of Ten Bandits Plotting to Kidnap Zhang Long's Grandson</h3>
<p>One Bandit Once Kidnapped Xi Lusheng</p>
<p>Acquitted After Appeal</p>
<p>Now Involved in a Kidnapping Case Again</p>
<p>The Police Request the Court's Attention</p>
<p>Doctor Zhang Zhu San (aka Zhang Xingruo) is the grandson of the late cold disease specialist Zhang Longzhai. His clinic has always been located in the Xin residence at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Wenzhou Road, and his life is quite prosperous, so he has been coveted by bandits, who intended to kidnap Zhang Zhu San and extort a huge sum of money. At the beginning of this month, Fei Dang repeatedly rented the Zhongnan, Dongnan, Hongxiang, and other hotels for secret meetings to prepare for the kidnapping. It was then decided to take action at 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month. At that time, the bandits and the room No. 2 of the Hongxiang Hotel were the gathering place, and at 3:00 PM, they sent party members Wang A Liu, Zhu A Si, and someone A to the Dongxin Motor Vehicle Shop on Haig Road to rent car No. 12419. The driver, Shi Zhenxiang, drove through the Zhongshan Road and Hongqiao Road near Zhabei. Wang and others took out guns to threaten and drove Shi off the car to supervise. On the one hand, Zhang A Mao, a bandit who had been waiting there, drove to the vicinity of the Zhang residence and stopped the car to wait, and sent Li Mengfei to take charge of guarding. The rest of the bandits were waiting in the Hongxiang Hotel, waiting to set off. The above sections are all predetermined plans of the bandits. It was unexpected that the matter was not secret and was learned by the detectives of the Gordon Road Police Station. Therefore, at 3:00 PM on the 9th, Huatanchang Shen Chongli, tanmu Zhang Liang, Liu Chunshu, Baotang Pi Shaochang, Li Wenhan, Xitan Ke Laofu, Kaina Tai, etc. went to the Hongxiang and Zhang's residence and Zhongshan Road, etc., and arrested ten bandits, Yu Changyou, Li Aqi, Wang Depu, Zhang Juxian, Li Mengfei, Zhang A Mao, Chen Hongsheng, Wang Zhifang, Wang A Liu, Zhu A Si, etc. Zhu, at that time, tried to resist arrest and was shot in the chest by the detector and is now in the hospital. The car driver Shi Zhenxiang was rescued, and three pistols, 24 bullets, a pair of black glasses, white cloth hemp rope, etc. were seized and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Feng Minde sat in the criminal court for the second hearing. The plaintiff Zhang Zhu San did not arrive, and the defendant Yan Gang lawyer defended him. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang rose to describe the above situation in detail, and said that the eighth defendant, Wang Zhifang, whose original name was Chen Baotai, was previously related to the kidnapping of HSBC comprador Xi Lusheng and was arrested and sent to your court at the same time as his party members Shi Jinde, Li Wenbing, etc. The case was also tried by your judge, and Chen was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, and Shi and Li were sentenced to death and executed by shooting. Chen was dissatisfied with the judgment and filed an appeal. As a result of the appeal, Chen was declared innocent and released. Now he has committed a kidnapping case again, and should be noted. There is also a letter of extortion found in the Hongxiang Hotel that has not been sent out, which is covered with the stamp of the Garrison Headquarters and the envelope of the Headquarters. It was found that the stamp and envelope were forged. Now the Headquarters sent personnel to the case, which can prove that. Then the supervisory officer of the Headquarters, Xu Pengfei, voted to say that he had received a letter from the police station, saying that someone had forged the Headquarters' envelope stamp, so I went to the police station to check, and it was indeed forged, so today I came to the case to testify on the order of the Headquarters, and presented a photo of the official envelope of the Headquarters. Then, according to the representatives of Zhongnan, Dongnan, Hongxiang, and other hotels, except for the defendants Chen Hongsheng, Wang A Liu, and Zhu A Si, the rest had been to various hotels. According to the car driver Shi Zhenxiang, the car was rented by Wang A Liu, Zhu A Si, Wang Zhifang, etc., and he was driven off the car and monitored with a gun. After Judge Feng verified the confession, he questioned the defendants briefly. Because it was dusk, he ordered a change of date for the next hearing. The defendants were still remanded to the police station.</p>
<h3>Murder of Husband Appeal Case Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yang Changlin was unable to fully express himself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhu Zhang presented an expert report.</p>
<p>Zhu Shisheng, the owner of the Nanyang Department Store at 100 Yangzhou Road, had a dispute with his wife, Zhu Zhang, on July 24th of this year. The argument escalated into a physical altercation, resulting in injuries that led to his death. After a trial in the First Special District Court, his wife, Zhu Zhang, was sentenced to life imprisonment. Dissatisfied with the original verdict, Zhu Zhang appealed. The Higher Branch Court heard the case once on October 20th. However, due to incomplete witness testimony, the hearing was adjourned and rescheduled for yesterday. Meanwhile, lawyers Lin Yingqing and Chen Zemin were commissioned to submit supplementary grounds for appeal. Yesterday, Judge Song Yuan opened the court. Zhu Fusheng's daughter, Zhu Fuying, was summoned to testify. She stated that she was a local, 31 years old, and married to Zhang Xinglin. Zhu Zhang was her stepmother. Her fourth sister died of illness on the ninth day of the sixth lunar month, and the funeral was held on the tenth. She and her husband went to the funeral together. Upon returning, they learned that her parents had fought, and her father was unable to speak, lying upstairs with injuries. His hands and feet were bruised and purple. Because he couldn't speak, they didn't talk. She didn't see her mother calling a doctor, and was told that he was beyond help. After repeated requests, her mother finally said that sending him to the hospital might save him. They sent him to the hospital at 2:00 AM that night, but he died the next day. She accompanied her father to the hospital, but her mother didn't go. Next, Zhu Shisheng's second daughter, Zhu Hemei, testified that she was 24 years old and married in Yinxiang Township. She only learned of her father's critical condition a day later. When she returned home, her father often wept and told her that he was often beaten by Zhu Zhang. This time when she arrived home, her father was already in the hospital and unable to speak. Her mother was not by his side to take care of him. Witness Yang Changlin testified that Zhu Zhang was his aunt. At that time, he was helping at Zhu Shisheng's house due to the death of his daughter. Around 5:00 PM that afternoon, while having dinner, the couple suddenly started arguing. Zhu Zhang grabbed Zhu Shisheng's right hand, and Zhu Shisheng immediately fell. The judge asked why he fell, but Yang mumbled and couldn't answer. He couldn't answer no matter how many times he was asked. Asked how he knew to shout for help, he mumbled and couldn't answer. Asked if the couple had fought, he answered no. He continued that after this, the couple went outside to the store. Subsequently, witness Zhang Changsheng testified that Zhu Zhang was his sister. When he saw Zhu Shisheng and his wife fighting, he immediately stepped forward and held his sister, then advised them to stop. The judge asked if he heard Zhu Shisheng shouting for help. He answered no. Asked if he saw him fall, he answered no. At this point, students Chen A’tu and Zhou Yuansheng, who were in the store at the time, were summoned for questioning. Because there were seven people specifically eating at Zhu Shisheng's house that day, it was necessary to summon them all to testify. The court ordered that they all be summoned, and the hearing was rescheduled. At that time, Chen Zemin, the lawyer representing Zhu Zhang, presented a doctor's expert report to the court. The report stated that a stroke, or cerebral hemorrhage, causes the afflicted person to become confused within minutes of falling, with rigid limbs or intermittent convulsions, slow pulse, deep breathing, and lowered body temperature. This can last from several hours to several days. In milder cases, it is necessary to wait until the blood in the brain is absorbed before consciousness gradually returns, or disability occurs, such as paralysis. It is impossible to walk within ten days. Furthermore, after an injury to the testicles, the scrotum will definitely swell. If the testicular tissue is also damaged, the tissue and blood vessels will definitely be broken and ruptured, and a bluish-purple color will appear on the outside of the scrotum, which is evidence of bleeding from the tissue. If it appears red and the testicles are slightly swollen, it is definitely a pre-existing condition and not evidence of injury. Furthermore, those suffering from gonorrhea often have complications such as epididymitis, characterized by swelling of the testicles and redness of the scrotum.

<h3>Bidding for Road Earthwork Project in Downtown Area</h3>
<p>Xiehe Civil Engineering Company Wins the Bid</p>
<p>Since the completion of the first land reclamation in the downtown area, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has been actively preparing for the construction of roads in the area. The road project includes 22 roads with a total length of over 12,400 meters. The earth used for filling will be extracted from the Qiujiang River, requiring over 90,000 cubic meters. The bidding was opened publicly at the Bureau yesterday (20th) at 2:00 PM. The Municipal Government sent Commissioner Wang Shaozhai to supervise the proceedings. Ten bidders participated, including Zhao Lianqi, Zhang Ruiji, Xinji, Taichang, Li Runji, Zhu Kuiji, Heji Yisi Xideji, Dongfang Construction Company, and Xiehe Civil Engineering Company.

<h3>Jiaodong Disaster Relief Association Continues to Remit Relief Funds</h3>
<p>The National Flood Relief Committee of the National Government received a telegram from the Yantai Jiaodong National Flood Relief Association, remitting another 10,000 yuan in relief funds. The original telegram is as follows: "To the National Flood Relief Committee of the National Government, Central Bank of China, Shanghai.

<h3>Zhabei Standard Clock Restored to Original Condition</h3>
<p>Stopped Twice Due to Line Contact</p>
<p>The five electric standard clocks installed by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities in the Zhabei District have been praised for their convenience since their commissioning on October 10th. On the 16th of this month, a sudden malfunction caused all of them to stop. Upon receiving the report, the Bureau immediately dispatched technicians and representatives from the Siemens Company, which installed the clocks, to investigate. They discovered a strong voltage in the lines, indicating that the clock lines had come into contact with strong electric power lines. They immediately sought out the point of contact and first disconnected the wires on Gonghe Road, restoring the standard clock at Hengfeng Bridge. The next morning, they continued their investigation and learned that the intersection of Dongqiujiang Road and the electric light line was the point of contact. The two clocks at the intersections of Qiujiang Road and Baoshan Road were both burned out. They immediately replaced them with spare clocks and calibrated them in sequence. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 18th, they received reports that all the clocks had stopped again. They immediately dispatched personnel to reorganize and restore them to their original condition. According to investigations, the city's electrical wiring is extremely complex and prone to contact with the standard clock lines. Although the lines are covered with insulated sheathing, the sheathing's insulation effect is lost due to rain. Moreover, the lines are long and difficult to find, causing the clocks to stop for two days. It is now known that the Bureau has discussed safety measures with Siemens to reduce the chances of malfunctions. The standard clocks are currently still in the trial period. It is reported that the Bureau of Public Utilities will only formally accept them after the trial results are satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Anhui Native Place Association Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Requesting the Dismissal of Chen Diaoyuan</p>
<p>The Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai has spared no effort in handling disaster relief this time, and its appeals for relief have been very effective. However, Chen Diaoyuan, the chairman of the provincial government, has disregarded disaster relief efforts and often obstructed official disaster relief funds. For example, 300,000 yuan of urgent disaster relief funds allocated by the National Government have been withheld to this day, delaying the lives of disaster victims, to an unknown extent. Moreover, under the pretext of disaster relief, he has forcibly imposed public bonds, levied rice taxes, provincial road surcharges, and cigarette taxes, among other harsh policies, which have long been resented by the people of Anhui. The association has recently received letters and telegrams of complaint from various counties throughout the province, too numerous to list. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the Central Fourth Plenary Session to refresh politics, they convened an emergency meeting of fellow provincials yesterday to discuss jointly petitioning the Central Government with fellow provincials inside and outside the province to dismiss Chen Diaoyuan, in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Anhui.</p>

<h3>Intelligence Department of the Deputy Commander's Headquarters Defends Wan Guobin in a Telegram</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, received a telegram from the Intelligence Department of the Deputy Commander's Headquarters in Beiping, stating: "To Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: We have read the report on November 14th stating that the current funds of the Jiangsheng Guangxin Company have been taken away by Wan Guobin. After investigation, before Zhang Haipeng led the rebel army to attempt to occupy the provincial capital of Longjiang and declared independence, some local bullies in Heilongjiang advocated opening the city to welcome this scourge. At that time, Wan Guobin resolutely opposed the public opinion and insisted on resisting, thus preventing Zhang Haipeng's rabble from seizing Jiangsheng. After fleeing in disarray, those local bullies gnashed their teeth at Wan and fabricated rumors, using false Japanese newspapers to slander him. In reality, Jiangsheng is a poor area, and the Guangxin Company is known to be financially strapped. How could there be millions of dollars in cash for someone to seize? Moreover, since Chairman Ma took office, Wan Guobin has been planning and coordinating tirelessly. We dare to present the facts in detail and report them in a special telegram, so that right and wrong will not be reversed and loyalty and rebellion will be distinguished. We hope that you will not hesitate to speak up and clarify the matter on his behalf. We eagerly await your response. Intelligence Department of the Deputy Commander's Headquarters."</p>

Later, overseas Chinese came back to the country in groups and organized the Sanmen Bay Overseas Chinese Inspection Group. After inspecting the bay, they felt at a loss for what to do. Mr. Chai Lianfu actively reached out to make connections and joined the company, and the overseas Chinese also expressed deep sympathy and volunteered to invest and cooperate. Therefore, the company needs to be reorganized and should expand its organization for development. A special meeting of new and old promoters was called to implement the reorganization and solicit opinions to facilitate progress. It was requested to publicly decide on how to reorganize and the deadline for collecting shares. C. It was resolved to reorganize the preparatory committee again. The deadline for paying the shares was set before the end of November of this year. A notice would be issued on the 19th.

<h3>Standard for Dismissal of Store Employees</h3>
<p>National Medicine Industry Association Notifies Compliance</p>
<p>The National Medicine Industry Association of this city notified its members: "Regarding the matter of notification, disputes between labor and capital are deeply related to the development of industry and commerce. Frequent disputes often lead to a sharp decline in business, and even closure or bankruptcy, which we often hear about. The Central Training Department, in view of this, has stipulated standards for the dismissal of store employees and has ordered the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to inform the provincial and municipal governments to instruct their respective industrial and commercial groups to comply with them. The dismissal of employees in our industry has also been inconsistent, leading to conflicting opinions and difficult resolutions. In the future, we can comply with the Ministry's order to resolve the dismissal issue. Therefore, we attach the standards for the dismissal of store employees and hope that you will comply with them. We hereby notify you." The original text of the standards is recorded below: "(1) Standards for the Dismissal of Store Employees. (1) A company or firm may dismiss its employees under any of the following circumstances: (1) The company or firm closes down entirely. (2) The company or firm genuinely reduces its business or partially suspends operations. Employees dismissed under the preceding paragraph should be given priority for re-employment when the company or firm returns to its original state. (3) A company or firm may dismiss its employees under any of the following circumstances: (1) The employee suffers from a serious illness certified by a doctor and is unable to work after a three-month leave granted by the store owner. (2) The employee has a mental illness and loses their normality, certified by a doctor, and is unable to work. (3) The employee suffers from tuberculosis, venereal disease, leprosy, or other infectious diseases, certified by a doctor, that cannot be cured in a short period of time and that are harmful to public health. (4) The employee is sentenced to criminal detention or more. (5) The employee smokes opium or other substitutes. (6) The employee gambles or visits prostitutes and abandons their duties, despite three warnings from the store owner. (7) The employee discloses trade secrets that should be kept confidential, causing significant losses to the store owner. (8) The employee engages in other businesses without the store owner's permission, which hinders the operation of the store. (9) The employee leaves their job without the store owner's permission more than three times in a month. (10) The employee embezzles store funds without reason, exceeding two months' salary, and is unable to repay them within a deadline set by the store owner."</p>
<h3>Tobacco Exchange Industry Association Requests Exemption from Business Tax</h3>
<p>Document Presented to the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Tobacco Exchange Industry Association yesterday sent a document to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government and the Municipal Government, stating: "Regarding the request for a certificate of exemption from business tax, which is currently being rejected by the Municipal Finance Bureau, we hereby earnestly request your esteemed officials to review and interpret the matter, and to order an exemption to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and comply with the legal system. Upon investigation, the tax-exempt scope of the Business Tax Law promulgated by your ministry includes those who have already paid tobacco and liquor license taxes. This is also in accordance with Article 8 of the Municipal Government's Business Tax Regulations, which does not explicitly mention taxation. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Office for the Collection and Payment of Business Tax on Behalf of Others previously instructed us to fill out a form for verification, and we were approved to submit our reasons and request the issuance of a tax exemption certificate. We subsequently received a reply from the office stating that it had requested instructions from the Municipal Finance Bureau. Soon after, we received a notice from the Municipal Finance Bureau citing the second half of Article 3 of your ministry's interpretation, stating that businesses that sell goods and also operate tobacco and liquor should still be subject to business tax. However, our industry mainly deals in tobacco, and other items are sold as a sideline. Your ministry's interpretation of this case is extremely clear, and the National Government and the Municipal Government have not listed tax rates for this. The bureau's interpretation is piecemeal and its reasoning seems insufficient. Therefore, we are submitting a document requesting your esteemed ministry to review and interpret the matter, and to order an exemption to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and comply with the legal system. This would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to Song, Minister of Finance; Zhang, Mayor of Shanghai."</p>

<h3>Letters to the Newspaper</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Mr. Editor of the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper,</p>
<p>Greetings. Since the flooding disaster in our homeland in August, which has affected more than a dozen provinces, overseas Chinese compatriots have heard the news and have risen up to organize fundraising efforts. Our association members also staged a theatrical performance on the evening of September 1st to raise donations, obtaining 5,000 yuan in national currency. On the 3rd, we wired the funds through the Andah Bank in this city to Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, entrusting him to forward the funds to appropriate domestic disaster relief organizations, in the hope that those affected by the disaster would receive practical assistance. Unexpectedly, in mid-October, we received an official letter from the "Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce" stating that the funds had not been received. However, as the letter did not bear the president's signature or seal, our association was unable to ascertain the facts. We have contacted the bank, but have yet to receive confirmation. Therefore, we boldly write to your newspaper, requesting that the original letter be published so that the Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Yu can request the funds from the bank and forward them to the disaster area. The disaster situation is like a fire, and rescue is as urgent as war. Your newspaper is the leader of public opinion in our country. We trust that you will grant our request for this public service. We wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jiang Cangjiang, President of the Jinjiang Association of Surabaya, Dutch East Indies</p>

<p>29th Day, 10th Month, Year 20 of the Republic</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Chief Editor of the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper,</p>
<p>I have recently read the report published in your newspaper on November 18th regarding the China-America Banking Corporation, which involves me, and I am extremely astonished. I am involved in military and political affairs and have never engaged in business, nor have I ever set foot near that company. Ma Zhichao resides and works in Shanghai, and his path is different from mine, and we do not conspire together. This is well known. Many friends have asked me about this, and fearing misunderstandings, I have made a solemn statement in the newspaper that I have no connection with the company, which is a matter of common knowledge. As for Li Henian's service in that company, it was not brought about by me. How can this be falsely accused? I respectfully request that your newspaper grant a correction so that right and wrong can be distinguished and the facts can be clarified. I cannot express enough my hope.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Ma Xiaojun, bowing in respect.</p>
<p>November 20th</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhang Liyang's Immediate Message</h3>
<p>(Regarding the issue of how to deal with sealed Japanese goods)</p>
<p>Please, Citizens, Be Aware: Do Not Destroy Our Last Weapon! The Moment of Survival is Here!</p>
<p>After reading the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's resolution on how to deal with sealed Japanese goods, I felt very apprehensive. Contributing to an industrial fund is, of course, a way to promote domestic goods. However, if this allows for the open sale of Japanese goods without a firm resolution or deadline for boycotting them, it will not only lead to unscrupulous merchants engaging in fraudulent practices, but also to the de facto elimination of the boycott. Here are my observations for discussion with all sectors: (1) Determining the amount of the industrial fund to be paid based on the time of import seems comprehensive on the surface. In reality, it is difficult to distinguish between goods imported at different times (e.g., if a store imported five dozen Japanese goods in July and five dozen in August, and now only has four dozen left for sale, how can we legally determine the time and require them to pay the industrial fund?). I suggest that sealed Japanese goods should not be classified by time, and that at least 30% of the value should be paid into the industrial fund, making the sale price of those Japanese goods more expensive than domestic goods. This would prevent unscrupulous merchants from profiting, and buyers would tend to buy domestic goods, fundamentally boycotting Japanese goods and implicitly promoting the sales of domestic goods. (2) For Japanese goods imported after September 18th, I believe that they were obviously imported by heartless and insane merchants, and should be subject to appropriate punishment, i.e., the goods should be handed over to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for public sale on a fixed date. Of the proceeds, 30% should be returned to the merchant, 10% should be used for expenses, and the remaining 60% should be used for the fund and for donating to flood relief, as a means of punishment. (3) For summer Japanese goods, a special pawn institution should be jointly organized by the banking and money sectors. Funds should be contributed by the banking and money industries in proportion to the capital of each firm, and remitted to the pawn institution. All merchants should be notified to mortgage their summer Japanese goods to the pawn institution. The discount rate for the mortgaged goods should be determined by a committee organized by representatives from the banking, money, and merchant sectors. This would alleviate the concerns of merchants about insufficient financial turnover. In short, at this time of increasing barbarity from the Japanese invaders, we must not allow enemy goods to become commonly and openly sold in Shanghai. Furthermore, while we should consider the difficulties faced by merchants, allowing them to sell their goods in a certain sacrifice to adjust finances, we should also impose extra sanctions and supervision on unscrupulous merchants who take the opportunity to profit.</p>
<p>(Reply) This issue deserves serious study. The last weapon of the nation against Japan is the boycott. The effectiveness of the boycott depends entirely on whether this issue is properly handled. Let's list and comment on the various methods of dealing with sealed Japanese goods that have been adopted in the past and proposed by people recently, as follows: (1) Burning. This method provides temporary satisfaction, and has the effect of arousing public attention, but results in the greatest economic loss and should not be done. (2) Public Sale. In the initial stages of the boycott, it is not impossible to use this method for existing inventory before the boycott was announced, following appropriate procedures. The concern is that once this is opened, unscrupulous merchants can secretly import and mix in goods after the boycott is announced, opening the door to fraud, which is tantamount to canceling the boycott. Therefore, this method must be very cautious. Moreover, after announcing the boycott, people are naturally advised not to buy or use them, but at the time of public sale, buying and using are allowed, which is self-contradictory. How can this be justified? (3) Selling to foreign countries. This method is certainly appropriate, but different goods have different sales channels. How feasible this method is remains to be studied. (4) Purchase by charitable organizations and distribution to disaster victims. This method may make people view Japanese goods as being used by disaster victims, and not as precious items. However, whether the goods meet the needs of disaster victims, and whether charitable organizations have sufficient purchasing power, this method is also a question. (5) Sale after the boycott is over. This is advocated by Mr. Gao Zhongxia. In previous boycotts, the end of the boycott provided a good opportunity for the country to import a large number of supplements. Only this method can block their source, and the losses borne by merchants are only the interest on the cost of goods during the boycott. (6) Concentrated public sale after six months. (7) Limited phased sale. (8) Requirement to pay an industrial fund, making the goods more expensive to sell. The first two methods are also advocated by Mr. Gao Zhongxia, considering them a compromise when necessary. The latter method is advocated by Mr. Zhang in his letter. Although it takes care of all aspects, the self-contradictory point of advising people not to buy or use while allowing buying and using cannot be resolved. (9) Organizing a pledge institution to allow merchants to pledge their goods and postpone sales until the end of the boycott. This is jointly advocated by Mr. Zhongxia and Mr. Zhang in his letter, and is the most satisfactory. However, whether the banking and money industries are willing to organize this institution, and whether it is possible, remains to be studied. Mr. Zhongxia attaches the pledge method to the method of selling after six months, while Mr. Zhang advocates limiting it to Japanese goods imported in the summer, which is easier to handle. All of the above methods of disposal are roughly here. It is hoped that the organizations leading the anti-Japanese national salvation will consider adopting methods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. What we should absolutely oppose is private sale and unconditional public sale, which would ruin the efforts of compatriots across the country in the past two months, and destroy our country's last weapon completely. What a painful thing this is! I hope that all our fellow countrymen will quickly rise up and unanimously oppose it.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>— Mo Yan</p>
<p>The west wind attacks us tightly, the autumn rain falls oily on our bodies, the sky is densely covered with gray clouds, and the whole scene is immersed in a hazy and diffuse morning mist, full of the situation of fighting hand to hand with the enemy in the trenches.</p>
<p>At this time, it is seven o'clock in the morning, and more than two hundred students in gray military uniforms are gathered in the playground covered in heavy rain and puddles of water. Standing in the water is not important, and it is not surprising that the body is completely soaked. Now, we should be tempering our bodies and creating strong citizens. We are not afraid, and we stand tall and heroically. The attack of the west wind and the beating of the autumn rain are nothing. For the country, for the nation, we should endure everything. The training now is preparation for cutting off the Japanese invaders in the future. We stand silently, waiting for the mobilization order of the battalion commander, looking as if we are about to go to the front line to fight the Japanese invaders to the death on the battlefield.</p>
<p>After practicing marching drills, it is time for "At Ease." The officers are discussing, and we soldiers also take this "At Ease" time to whisper secretly.</p>
<p>"We have been standing in the heavy rain for more than half an hour, and we still haven't left. Are we going to inspect today or not?" "Our whole bodies have been ravaged by the merciless autumn rain. There is no reason not to go. Even if we don't inspect, we will go out for parades and demonstrations, at least to move some people's hearts."</p>
<p>"That's right, we are just standing here, enduring cold and hunger, being ravaged by the wind and battered by the rain, sacrificing in vain. It is meaningless not to set off. If we are going to sacrifice, we should sacrifice with value and meaning."</p>
<p>"Indeed, a valueless sacrifice is foolish. If we are not fools, we must have a meaningful sacrifice."</p>
<p>"If we expose our wet bodies to the public, at least some people will be moved. Even if it is asking for help, there should be some sympathy."</p>
<p>"Especially the inspection in the heavy wind and rain can better express our national character and the spirit of the youth volunteer army. If the Japanese invaders saw it at this time, they would be frightened, their faces would turn blue, their limbs would convulse, and they would run away without daring to make a sound."</p>
<p>"Sacrificing for the motherland is indeed valuable..."</p>
<p>"Attention," the battalion commander's command is issued, and our conversation stops immediately.</p>
<p>Then, the first battalion is in front, followed by the second battalion, and they set off for the inspection site: the West Gate Public Sports Field.</p>
<p>"Kill, kill, kill..." This is the only sound coming from under our feet, suppressing our hearts. My heart seems to be throbbing, not out of fear, but out of great emotion. Ah, this sound is so solemn, great, and vivid. Saving the motherland, avenging the motherland, winning glory for the motherland, and the final victory seem to be buried and latent in this tragic sound full of murderous intent. Compatriots of the motherland, we should continue this great and tragic killing sound to painstakingly temper ourselves. As long as we temper ourselves to have copper-like muscles, iron-like bones, fire-like emotions, blood-like hearts, strong will, fearless spirit, indomitable determination, and strong citizens, aim our guns and fight to the death with our enemies in the final battle, our motherland will not perish.</p>
<p>"One, two, one..." The squad leader is suppressing our steps on the side of the team. The school flag is leading us forward. Along the way, male and female compatriots are watching our whole bodies soaked in the rain and our neat steps with surprised and admiring eyes. I think, at least, they should have some emotion.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the West Gate Public Sports Field, it was not yet eight o'clock. Apart from a few staff members, there were only a few spectators who followed our team in.</p>
<p>On the vast sports field, the muddy square is full of opening steps, standing at attention, and at ease.</p>
<p>Blowing in the cold wind, getting wet in the bitter rain, standing in the mud with an empty stomach, our bodies are shivering with cold, and raindrops drip from the brim of our hats onto our mouths and the bridge of our noses. I swallow mouthfuls of cold saliva, and there is a fear in my heart that there will be no inspection.</p>
<p>We did arrive too early, but this can better show our spirit. After standing there for about half an hour, the review stand began to be set up, and the staff were busy moving around. It seems that the inspection will not be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock, all the schools that were to be inspected in the Fourth District arrived on the field one after another. How gratifying this is. All the schools can hold the same fearless spirit and determination as us, braving the rain to participate in the inspection, full of energy and heroic. Especially the female compatriots, also bathed their entire delicate bodies in the heavy wind and rain to temper themselves, and their feet were also stained by the mud. They endured hardship and hard work, resolutely held the spirit of saving the country, and sacrificed for the motherland, which made us even more admirable. The evils of the Chinese nation have been completely washed away in this hot meeting place. This is the glory of the motherland. In the near future, our motherland will have saviors.</p>
<p>The inspection began, and our school was in charge of the overall command.</p>
<p>First of all, the commander-in-chief summoned the volunteer army of each school to the front of the review stand, performed the necessary rituals for the meeting, and then the inspection officer came down to inspect. Because the ground was too slippery, the marching in review of each school was not performed. Then, the commander-in-chief ordered each school to freely participate in the performance. The platoon training of our school was not bad, and the battlefield rescue of the women's rescue team was also very impressive. Later, there were also speeches by representatives, with calm and passionate attitudes, and the words were enthusiastic and moving. "...Today is a symbol of our enthusiasm mixed with rain. I hope that in the future, on the battlefield, we will mix our blood with rain, defeat Japanese imperialism, and defeat all imperialism that oppresses weak nations..." These few sentences are deeply imprinted in my heart. In short, the spirit of this inspection is admirable and admirable. I only hope that in the future, no matter what we do, we can continue to work hard with this spirit. Our motherland will have a day of rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Around eleven o'clock, after the chairman announced the adjournment, we still marched back to school in teams one after another.</p>
<p>"Kill, kill, kill..." We seem to be advancing on a long journey.</p>
<p>The rain is still falling, and our whole bodies are already soaked through even more. Our numb legs have regained their activity. "One, two, one..." The squad leader is suppressing our steps. Along the way, male and female compatriots are watching our whole bodies soaked in the rain and our neat steps covered in mud with surprised and moved eyes. I think, if all the compatriots of the motherland have the fearless spirit of the Fourth District Inspection today, and persevere to the end, our motherland will never perish.</p>
<h3>At the Restaurant</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>"Cheng, don't study English, the bulletin board says the English teacher is on leave," Bin shouted happily as he walked into the classroom. "Yu is treating us, she specifically asked me to call you..."</p>
<p>"Really, Yu is treating us? When?" I asked in surprise, interrupting Bin's words.</p>
<p>"Right now, they are already waiting for you outside the school gate," Bin pulled me and ran outside.</p>
<p>"How can you be so careless, leaving the school without permission? If the dorm master sees you, won't you be deducted points?" I stopped immediately and said anxiously.</p>
<p>"She is sick, she went to bed at eight o'clock last night and is still in bed now," Bin said, running even faster. At this time, we had already seen Yu and Yun.</p>
<p>"Cheng, I forgot to inform you just now, causing you to run so fast," Yu said with a gentle smile, holding my hand tightly.</p>
<p>We left the school gate, turned two corners, and arrived at our destination. We strode upstairs, quietly, with very few people. We picked a room next to one with two middle-aged women who seemed to be from out of town and sat down. The waiter took a piece of paper and asked us to order. Bin said, "Don't order any dishes, just stir-fry a few plates of noodles." We all agreed and advised Yu not to order dishes, but she insisted on asking us what we liked to eat. We ignored her, and she ordered five dishes and three plates of fried noodles and gave them to the waiter.</p>
<p>We had only eaten halfway when three or four students who looked like young men in suits came in very noisily and sat on the outside of our room, constantly craning their necks to look at us, talking loudly about "Love Louer".</p>
<p>Yun said softly, "Should I hang the curtain down? I don't know why, but I get angry when I see them." She happened to be sitting facing the door. "Let them go, let's eat our own food," someone next to Yun said.</p>
<p>We were eating rudely, and before long, we had almost finished eating. We were talking and waiting for the waiter to come and settle the bill. After a while, he came in, holding a towel in one hand and a piece of paper full of English words in the other, and said to us, "This is from the gentlemen over there. They said you don't have to pay because they have written what you should pay on their bill."</p>
<p>Yu said loudly, "Is it four yuan, six jiao, three fen?" "Yes... four yuan, six jiao, three," he nodded, saying courteously.</p>
<p>Yu took out a five-yuan bill from her leather bag, threw it on the table and said, "Take it, this is the money we paid." She said angrily to the waiter, then sighed slightly and turned her head and said to us, "Let's go back. We didn't eat any particularly tasty dishes, but we did encounter some strange phenomena. I regret it."</p>

<h3>Propaganda</h3>
<p>— Autumn</p>
<p>"Autumn, the school is going to organize a propaganda team, let's organize one too!"</p>
<p>One morning, I was in my room writing a novel, "Joining the Army," and hadn't even written two thousand words when Huai suddenly ran in and said this.</p>
<p>I had already known about this. Yesterday, I wanted to gather a team to go to the countryside to promote [our cause], but later, due to another important matter, it wasn't implemented. Huai's words reminded me of this matter again. At this moment, I only blamed myself for putting this nation-saving work out of my mind. So, I immediately put down my pen, stuffed the manuscript into the drawer, and replied,</p>
<p>"Good, have you already organized it? Have you registered the names with the council? If not, we must hurry."</p>
<p>"It's already organized. Our small team has a total of ten people, all acquaintances of ours..." Then he went on to say many names.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Everything was prepared, and the ten propagandists were gathered. So, we set off together towards the school gate. Our propaganda destination was Baoshan.</p>
<p>I had been to Baoshan more than once, but the last time I went to Baoshan, on the way, we always talked about women, saying how good Miss × was, how bad Miss was, and many other trivial things, or talked about many love stories among friends. But this time, it was different. We talked all the way about the major national crisis and the international situation. Everyone had predictions for the outcome of this event. Ten people had completely different ideas; ten people had ten different observations. But most of the time, we talked about the propaganda materials, how to make them appealing, and how to arouse the masses. We also assigned roles to the people who would be promoting [our cause], and arranged the order of the speakers. Because I usually don't like to talk, I wasn't ranked in the top five. I felt very fortunate, but at the same time, I felt very ashamed.</p>
<p>In the conversation, we easily arrived at Baoshan. The city of Baoshan was still as quiet as before. The difference was that there were many anti-Japanese slogans on the walls and telephone poles.</p>
<p>Our plan was to use the teahouses as propaganda locations, anticipating that there would be idle ordinary people drinking tea. However, the reality disappointed us. We passed two teahouses, and there were only two or three people sitting there quietly. On the streets, it was as lonely as it wasn't a county town.</p>
<p>So, we had no choice but to return in silence. The disappointment of several friends who were good at propaganda at this time, we can imagine.</p>
