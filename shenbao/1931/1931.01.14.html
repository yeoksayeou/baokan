<p>以前世界之事件不過各國國內之事及各國相互間之事各國國內之事關於一國而止大抵不至重大也各國相互間之事由各國之政府與政府交涉所謂國際交涉也自來留心世界之大勢者每於此以推求之今則不然除各國政府間交涉外又有各種會議之集合與黨派之分途不以國界不以業務與國際政治錯綜離合無一定式故今日之談世界情勢斷不如以前之簡單而易明了且於人之關係外又有經濟之關係故徒知一二端而欲斷世界大局者不可能之事也</p>
<p>試舉一例以言以前各國政府與政府間而情勢險惡即有開戰之可能故欲斷定世界之戰爭與和平但觀各國政府間之交涉而可知今日不然即兩國政府而欲開戰或迫於國內之情形而有所不許或由於經濟之壓迫而有所不能牽制既多自不能如以前之便利故世人欲研求世界情勢者不當與前同其眼光也</p>

<p>說明改　院長與設立五組之本意</p>
<p>中央大學十二日上午十一時在伯明堂舉行本年第一次總理紀念　到敎職員學生五百餘人由校長朱家驊主席行　如　丶主席報告略謂丶兄弟到校以來今天才參加第一次紀念週以前兄弟就職的時候適逢年假開始丶沒有很多和大家見面的機會今天借這個機會丶把學校裡面應該向人宗報告的地方作一個簡單的報告（一）本校行政組織丶向來與國內各大學略有不同丶大槪多分敎務與事務兩部一面有評議會一面有教務會議同時一面設總務處或事務處一面設教務處自從大學條例頒布以後丶各校組織多須改變本校匠設秘書事務敎務三處每處設處長一人大學條例雖無明文規定究竟應該設幾處但是照條例看來丶敎務事務兩者則可以打成一片丶不必分離前張校長將三處合併丶改設一總務處這與入學組織條例的原意沒有不同丶就事實上說﹁事務應敎務而生丶不必以事務分離而獨立丶﹂所以事務應該力求簡單斷不能過於側重就是前有的五處也不必獨立丶所以校務就由註冊文書出版庶務會計五組來辦理也就夠了旣可以增加辦事效率丶又可以節省行政經費丶將來再加設秘書長一人丶以總其成丶這種組織就更完善了這　計劃丶兄弟在就職之前就决定了的並不是出於何人的要求前幾天看見報紙上載有這項消息說是由本校同學建議的丶這全與事實不符不過有同學曾經來問過我關於本校行政組織的問題丶我把我的决定告訴過他罷了我希望各同學多在學術上做工夫對於校務丶兄弟自當負責謀本校的發展丶至於各組卡任丶現在都已聘定都是受過　深教育富有學識而能辦事的人並目不兼別的職務都各有專資丶追行一切自然很順利的丶（二）　學校的院長有已經向張校長辭職的經兄弟再三挽留因種種關係不能打消辭意且有久經辭職而離　的兄弟挽留無效只得另行聘請現已請得郭心崧先生來代理法學院院長莊澤宣先生扣任敎育學院院長丶工學院院長陳懋解先生本已辭職數　經兄弟再三挽留他已允許在繼任院長未經聘定之前暫行繼續負責丶農學院院長　秉文先生因爲不能脫離上海的職務早已辭職赴滬丶現請　希先生繼任其餘各院各有更動名院長都是有高深學問的知名之士丶諒來大家都是知道的丶（三）還有一點丶要咐帶報告的關於經費問題當然是大家平常很關心的一種事件本校經費丶財部和江蘇省向來都是照發而目比其他各機關提前發放丶結欠的經費幷不多這可見政府維護敎育的至誠丶不過本校因爲建築及其他設備等等積欠很多丶　怕是　幾十萬丶因爲前任的交代還沒有完竣丶不能十分明瞭丶第一步先要把債務整理清楚丶一切的建設才能夠着手計劃漸次進行丶今天先把以上的幾點和諸位講講丶以後見面的機會很多丶校中一切丶再行隨時報告大家</p>

<p>付之一笑·海·客　　法官（問一個犯了購博罪的婦人）丨你可是夜夜到賭場中去的麼。　　婦人丨並不是夜夜去的。昨夜小姊妹們拉我去看看。纔去了一次。實在這還是第一次哩。　　法官丨那麼姑念你是初犯。從寬發落你好好的冋去。以後不許再賭。　　婦人（熟視法官的臉。帶着笑說。）丨謝謝你。老爺。我原知道越是面孔難看的人。他的心腸越好。　　甲著作家丨西方的著作家。往往將他所着的書。和他的愛妻相比。乙着作家丨爲甚麼。甲著作家丨就是表示珍愛的意思。乙著作家丨但是我的著作雖多。却不敢和我妻相比。甲著作家丨爲甚麼。乙著作家丨因爲我一向並不珍愛我的著作。況且我的著作。中正和平。從不駡人的。而我妻駡起我來。却是特別的厲害。乞人丨先生。我兩天沒有吃東西了。求你做做好事。賞我三十銅元。吃一碗光麵慈善家丨吃一碗光麵。二十銅元儘夠了。怎麼要三十銅元。乞人丨因爲我吃麵時。向來要喝十銅元的高梁的。記孔老三  碧筠　　崑山縣城內西北隅。有馬鞍山。以形名。亦稱玉山玉峯。則以產奇石。　　晶瑩如玉之故。配以良工雕琢之座。供之几案。殊勝靈璧。以峯勢玲瓏。色澤瑩潔。皆非靈璧所得而有焉。縣以崑山名。本取義於崑岡產玉。而玉峯遂爲縣之別稱。﹁按江西有玉山縣。舊屬廣信府。故崑山多稱玉峯。少用玉山之名。然曩年書院固稱玉山。今城區又稱玉山市。﹂山石之奇。榮冠全邑矣。魏邴原有云。登山采玉。入海求珠。若采玉峯之玉。則當云入山采玉。蓋非鑿山之至深處。不可得而采也。最近擅斯技者。爲孔老三。旣采得。猶等璞玉。新人日行·天·虚·我·生　　與陳萬運君及其子女飲於樓外樓·酒酣戲以流星逐月·月乃大明·因與法輪有約·驅車往訪不値·繞湖一匝·歸而作此·以示小翠·　　一月三日天氣新。西湖水邊多灑人。自朝至午晴且雨。暖風拂面如當春。埀髫女兒抱狐氅。桃花靧面生酒雲。銀鐺小隊青　馬。畫帳扁舟白練裙。終冬楊柳不落葉。山色空漾水天接。斜陽倐忽放晴光。絕似西施開笑　微波瀲灔生五色。海市蜃樓驚瞬息。西竺猶停靉霴雲。東山已見團圞月。湖濱火樹開銀花。環湖樓閣三千家。水邊燈影攅如蝟。市上人聲沸似蛙。爲循南陌尋春約。來乘西泠油壁車。驅車特訪虎跑水。入寺待烹龍井茶。平平山路坳且折。欲入山門偏不得。旣無佛印來招提。惟有泉聲相應答。古人秉燭誇夜游。今宵恰好月當頭。參禪莫說夢中夢。拚醉重登樓外樓。君不見南屏山下彌陀院。提早來還隔年願。煌煌玉燭生春暉。簇簇香烟騰寶篆。人間已自改新年。天上豈甘仍舊貫。玉泉靈隱鄂王墳。夜半鈿車聲不斷。未知南宋觀燈節。能否依稀如此夕。春申江上縱繁華。若比西湖應不及。我有詩懷無可說。獨上高樓弄長笛。月光如水還如雪。汝輩不來眞可惜。（小翠欲待有雪始求故云）　　則加以雕琢之功。審勢取意。別具匠心。孔老三又擅特長。至欲使其色澤瑩潔如玉。更需長時期之手續。蓋千百年深錮在沙土中。一旦欲還其原有之色譯。談何容易。聞孔老三以研究之心得。先將浮淺沙土。用水冲盡。繼以秋海棠之梗與葉。搗爛入甕。即以此沙土已凈雕畢工之石。浸於甕中。亦有時間之限度。旣及度。取出。以水冲滁。曬於日中。旋曬旋浸。旋浸旋曬。每曬一次。其色略變。不知需幾何次而後光澤瑩然。原有之美質現。治石之功。始克告成。其高大盈二尺者。可易銀百兩。略遜者。數十兩。最小數寸者。亦可得十餘兩。孔老三深染烟霞之癖。以故貧無立錐地、而嘯傲自若。積產千金。不如薄技在身。斯言信不虛也。今孔老三已作古人。如斯長技。目前尚無得傳靈秘之人。蓋鑿入山之深處。濕毒熏蒸。至難抵抗。以故孔老三面部常有晦色。而身上瘡痏。且不斷也。人有他業。都不願爲之。上述云云。余在航船。聞城友張君言之甚詳。故一一錄之。以告愛玩崑石之人。果有所藏。須加倍護惜。蓋此後出品。暫告斷絕也。一玩物之成。其難已如是。語時。同舟有薛君者。喜滑稽。問張君。孔老三是否去年捐館。曰然。薛君笑曰。斯正孔老二停止春秋二祭之時。老二老三。同觸煤頭。可云難兄難弟。張君戲問。然則孔老大何如。薛君曰、你問孔方兄麼。自銅元局開。把他打倒。至今久不見面。老大通神。乃亦如是下臺。故知曲阜中衰也。老三雖有美玉於斯、烏能更求善價而沽諸哉。聞者大笑。舟中之岑寂都破。邊福耕出殯記和鷗　　名飛行家邊福耕君。無錫前洲邊家巷人。於去年十二月九日八時。駕熊式輝等往九江。不料機觸桅桿。與美人貝爾。墜地殞命。噩耗傳來。舉鄉嗟惜。邊之棺柩。於二日由申回籍、擇於五日爲出殯之日。素車白馬。極稱悲壯。爰拉雜記之如下。　　邊君生前。勝友如雲。故素幢對聯特多。堂中懸有遺像。奕奕如生、棺柩因鄉間俗例。死亡在外。已過接位之期、不能放置家內。不然。鄰閭將以惡言相凌。故祇得拱棚於道士官浜沿河、靈前置以王伯羣及航空公司諸親友之花圈。　　邊君年少英俊。儉誠可嘉。待人接物。尤和藹可親。存年衹二十有三。當入殮時。其父母哭之慟。夫人石紀梅女士。一慟幾絕。最難堪者、邊君尚有年邁祖母。巴黎物語（三）六曾寄於巴黎　　第二天晚上約安和伊的朋友。那淫賣婦。並新出獄的威廉和酒店主入布察朗等在國立劇場觀劇。當演了一半停着休息的時候。威廉和布察朗同出劇浣坐着汽車飛馳着。經過許多街道停在一家商店面前。幾個人一齊進去了。隨後拿着一些皮貨出來。但不幸遇着一個警乒用手鎗截住了。並且狂吹警笛呌人來帮助。趁着警察不注意的一刹那。盜匪中之一個開鎗將警察打死了。等到別的警察到來時。盜匪己經逃遠。但督察官湯姆呌人把載着盜匪飛奔的汽車夫抓來　　當劇塲的下半部戲開演時。威廉和布察朗已回到約安和伊的朋友的身邊。　　湯姆用着種種方法。最後畢竟使汽車夫供出殺人犯是威廉。以後湯姆又想法打破威廉的避罪口實（Ａｉｂｉ）。　　結局經過種種變化。湯姆終於找到了那將要逃走的盜犯。但當他拚命追趕時。盜匪拚命逃走。想跳過屋頂沒有跳着。失足向無底的虛空跌下了。　　我摘述這影片的情節。並沒有掩飾劇中的種種因襲部分。我們在這影片裏面可以發現許多小巧的穿揷。這些穿揷雖狠庸俗。但却永遠使人興舞。這片中不過是導演者隨便組成的狠自然的社會寫眞。經過十年的努力和摸索。美國電影業者能夠製出這樣驚人的質樸而又明快的影片。成績總算不錯了。看過避罪口實後。我差不多想到只有這種不著名的沒人看的影片反眞能表出最高的電影藝術。許多以佈景或明星號召的無意味影片。頂多不過熱鬧一兩年便完了。反不如這種不著名的片子。由一個無名的導演者嚴肅而用力的將一羣爭鬥的人類活躍的表現在銀幕上。倒反而永遠有一看的價值。　　我希望以後能夠在拉丁區的小電影館多遇到幾個這般精粹的影片。適逢九十。耳目失聰。愛孫之慘死。初尚未之知。是日聞人聲嘈雜。乃叩問何故。家人知不能隱。告以始末。一時老淚縱橫。厥狀尤慘。　　是日往送者。親友共五百餘。而無錫東門救火會及航空公司同人。本往弔唁。其父因家境關係。未以出殯日期告。故未往弔送。靈柩於午前十一時出發。素車白爲。盛極一時、最有精彩者。爲白軍一隊。均身帶縞素、沿途觀者。莫不爲之欷歔惋惜。墓塋在前洲之北。唐家村背後。從此一坏黃土。爲其最後之歸宿地矣。說燈謎飯牛翁　　燈謎一名文虎。一名商燈。又名春燈、更曰庾詞。原始於春秋亥有二首六身。厥後漢末孔融隱互其辭。至六朝始盛。明末揚州綠楊城郭問。士民富饒。馬蒼山創爲廣陵十八格。如會意。諧聲。典雅。傳神。碑陰。（又名拆字）徐妃。捲簾。壽星。（又名白頭格）粉底。（又名皂靴）蝦鬚。燕尾。比干。（又名剖心）鈎簾。釣魚。含沙。鴛鴦。（又名遙對格）碎錦。廻文等。此十八格中以會意典雅捲簾鴛鴦碑陰爲正宗。捲簾尤稱奧妙。餘若諸聲比干蝦鬚燕尾之類。祇可偶一爲之。聊資點綴閙熱。不豋大雅。名手不爲也。遜清乾嘉時代。海宇昇平。文人好事。江以南。揚州外。知蘇松常杭嘉湖各府屬。湖山秀麗。文章淵藪。每値新春歲首。騷壇墨客。烏衣子第。往往於華堂深處。肆筵設席。張燈懸謎。鬥角鈎心。爭相誇耀。而謎底以西廂相。水滸人混。聊齋志目。四書五經。用食物。方言古諺。花藥蟲魚。先賢今哲。三百千。（三字經百家姓千宇文唐詩詩品市店牌號。早巷名稱種種齊備。是謂全燈。倘無西廂水滸聊目。則謂半燈。懸半燈者。引爲奇辱。難免打虎將說笑。所以不掛燈則已。掛燈則必全燈也。心上溫馨（三）（四）（九）  包天笑　　第十六回殷勤問字翠袖謁先生慷慨談兵青樓宴女傑　　那時候席上笑語風生。。本來大家都是熟明友。。無所顧忌。。只有這位任佩眞女士。。却是生客。。伊好像擠不下去。。只得主人家和伊敷衍。。因問問在前兩革命軍興的當兒。。任先生是如何的努力。。如何的爲女界奮與。。也算爲女界中爭一線曙光。。任佩眞歎了一口氣道。。中國自來的積習。重男輕女。。一時豈能改變。。這呌做積重難返。在革命的時候。。儘管說得好聽。。過去以後。。就沒有那一回事了、你睢近幾年來。。從前所謂革命偉人的。。那一個不是三妻四妾。。要是我們女人。。偶然自己有了丈夫以後。。外面再去軋了一個姘頭。。就要被人睡駡。說伊是不規矩。。怎麼男子儘可以討姨太太。。女子便不許討姨老爺呢。。左詩晨聽了不覺哈哈笑道。。姨老爺三字。。倒也新頴。。任佩眞接着說道。。那年子我們爲了女子參政權的事。。和宋初仁大鬧。。不是你們報紙上都登出來的嗎。。甚而至於我們用武力解决。。湯君英打了宋初仁一記巴掌。。後來宋初仁的遭暗殺。。是被女人打了。。觸了霉頭。。其實這是沒有的事。。耶是一般人故意張大其詞罷了。。湯君英是湖南人。。宋初仁也是湖南人。兩人本是同鄉。。加着湯君英的性子急得很。。三言兩語。。便激烈起來。言語之間的衝突。。却是有的。。因爲宋初仁說。。中國來教育不發達。。婦女知識幼穉。。一時不能有參政權。。況且這一次革命。。女子也沒有什麼功勞○。我們的一班姊妹中。。湯君英的性子最激烈。。伊說怎麼把我們女人一筆抹煞。。試問你身從何出。。你說我們在此次革命中。。沒有功勞。我們也組織了女子革命軍。。隨軍出發。至於說身臨前敵。。也有好多軍。。不曾身臨前敵。。這次革命是天與人歸。。我們雖不敢貪天之功。。但總也有我們女界一份子呢。。左詩晨道。。任先生們當初組織的女子革命軍。。我曾經看過一張照片。。見諸位女士。。都穿了男子的軍裝。雄糾糾。。氣昻昻的煞是威武。。就只身軀總比男子短小一點兒。。那是生理上的關係了。。不重我見你們都戴了軍帽。。後面也沒有垂着辮子。。這頭髪問題。。如何解决。。任佩眞道。。我們有幾位都把頭縱髪剪掉了、以身報國。。還顧恤幾根頭髪嗎。。不過有幾位沒有剪的。。只好盤在軍帽裏面。。那倒不生問題。。只是背着那支槍走路。。實在覺得有些累墜。。正是　　吳宮誰教美人戰。漢水先成娘子軍。。　　未知後事如何。且聽下回分解。。</p>

Those who demobilized 10,000 people would receive 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, those who demobilized 20,000 people would receive 90,000 to 100,000 yuan, and so on.

<h3 id="e21">Complex World Trends <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>In the past, world events were only domestic affairs of each country and affairs between countries. Domestic affairs of each country only concerned one country and generally were not very important. Affairs between countries were negotiated by the governments of each country, which were called international negotiations. Those who paid attention to the general trend of the world used to infer from this. Now it is not the same. In addition to the negotiations between the governments of each country, there are also gatherings of various conferences and divergent paths of parties, which are intricately intertwined with international politics regardless of national boundaries and business, without a fixed pattern. Therefore, today's discussion of the world situation is definitely not as simple and clear as before. In addition to human relations, there are also economic relations. Therefore, it is impossible to judge the overall situation of the world by simply knowing one or two things.</p>
<p>To take one example, in the past, if the situation between the governments of various countries was dangerous, there was a possibility of war. Therefore, if one wanted to determine the world's war and peace, one could know it by observing the negotiations between the governments of various countries. Today, it is not the same. Even if two governments want to start a war, they may be prevented by the domestic situation or unable to do so due to economic pressure. There are many constraints, so it cannot be as convenient as before. Therefore, those who want to study the world situation should not have the same perspective as before.</p>

<p>The Federal Structure Committee Releases its Report</p>
<p>Acknowledging that All Authority Rests with the British Parliament</p>
<p>The Governor-General is Responsible for National Defense and Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th. The report prepared by the Indian Federal Structure Committee contains important proposals regarding the federal constitution. At today's meeting of the committee at St. James's Palace, Sir Sankey read the report, which suggested (1) vesting executive power in the Governor-General representing the British crown, (2) empowering the Governor-General to appoint and dismiss cabinet members who would assist the Governor-General, and (3) requesting that the Governor-General form a government, the duration of which would depend on the confidence of the legislature. The committee largely acknowledged that all Indian authority and responsibility have always belonged to the British Parliament, and that India's desire to recover all authority and responsibility cannot be achieved overnight. During the transition period, the Governor-General should be responsible for national defense and foreign affairs, as well as relations with the Indian princely states outside the federal scope and certain specified matters. The report also stated that the Governor-General should act freely, bear responsibility himself, and have the necessary power to implement his decisions. In the event of constitutional breakdown, the Governor-General must have full power to maintain the British Crown's government.</p>

<p>The Government Forcibly Implements Arbitration</p>
<p>The Communist Party Openly Encourages Protest</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th. The decision by the Ruhr labor dispute arbitration committee to reduce wages by 6% has been unanimously rejected by both mine owners and worker representatives. However, the German government announced tonight that this decision is binding on both parties. It is reported that although the Social Democratic Party trade union and the Christian Party trade union strongly oppose this move and do not want to strike and suffer severe punishment, the Communist Party is openly protesting. It has convened a meeting of worker representatives, attended by representatives from 130 mines, totaling 1300 people. On the spot, it was unanimously decided to form a unified miners' union. This union, under the influence of the Communist Party, will naturally be extremely radical and fight against the government. Today, the Berlin Daily commented on the labor strife, saying that while the Ruhr incident appears to be merely a dispute over wages, a closer look reveals that it is a competition of power among the current government, the reactionaries, and the revolutionaries. Labor strife in the United Kingdom and elsewhere is purely economic in nature, while Germany carries the political odor of a triangular competition. The battle has only just begun, and there are already hundreds of thousands of combatants. In the future, millions of short-term employees and 4.5 million unemployed workers may successively join the battle.</p>

<p>In reality, it is insufficient to alleviate the silver market.</p>
<p>Observations of the Japanese Banking Community</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 13th. In order to prevent the fall in silver prices and overcome the world's economic downturn, there is talk of an Anglo-American-Canadian banking syndicate organizing a large loan to China, with the loan being in cash. The Bank of Japan and the Yokohama Specie Bank have the following observations on this: (1) While stabilizing silver prices can increase the purchasing power of silver producing countries and countries using silver coins, China is the largest consumer of silver. If it holds such a large amount of silver, the demand for silver may decrease, which may lead to a future decline in silver prices. (2) On the one hand, silver syndicate theorists advocate restricting the sale of all silver ingots held by the Indian government in order to reduce the world's silver supply. However, it is doubtful whether India will be willing to make this huge sacrifice. (3) Although gathering silver ingots by forming a silver syndicate would be very beneficial to the struggling silver producers in the western states of Canada and the United States, the three-nation banking syndicate would only be helping these silver producers and spending a lot of money (such as the various expenses involved in buying silver and granting loans). This is something that the countries have not considered. In addition, authorities in Japanese financial circles are highly skeptical of the prospects for the silver syndicate's loan to China.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 13th. The regular cabinet meeting was convened at the Prime Minister's residence at 10:30 this morning. First, Acting Prime Minister Kijuro Shidehara declared that Prime Minister Hamaguchi had not been able to attend the Diet even after the recess had ended, so he had asked me to continue acting. I reluctantly agreed. In the past, when Baron Kato Takaaki was ill, Mr. Wakatsuki (the Home Minister) acted as Prime Minister and was subsequently appointed Prime Minister after Baron Kato's death. The circumstances are different this time because Prime Minister Hamaguchi will be able to attend the Diet soon. Therefore, in the meantime, I hope that all cabinet members will provide guidance and help so that we can overcome the difficult Diet. Minister of the Army Ugaki Kazushige replied that cabinet members will certainly cooperate and help, so he hoped that Shidehara would continue acting until the Prime Minister could attend in person. Interior Minister Adachi Kenzo also replied that although there were various rumors from young Diet members, they were merely theoretical. The Diet would unanimously unite to support Acting Minister Kijuro Shidehara. Please do not be concerned. Thereupon, all cabinet members officially approved Kijuro Shidehara to continue acting.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Replied to the Hankou Chamber of Commerce: Acknowledged by all Provincial and Municipal Chambers of Commerce and Newspapers. A telegram was recently sent in reply to the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, your telegram has been received. The abolition of likin and all taxes similar to likin was implemented on New Year's Day this year. The various provincial and ministry-affiliated customs bureaus have also complied with the deadline and completed the closure as recorded. The abolition of evil taxes is indeed an important policy of the government, but bearing the burden of taxation is also a duty that citizens should fulfill. Taking from the people has always been a principle. Without rice, even the cleverest cook cannot prepare a meal. Now that military affairs have just been settled and construction is in full swing, the treasury is empty, and resources are exhausted. As your telegram mentions, it is necessary to seek alternative means of compensation for state finances. The facts are such; there is no need to hide them. If the general public is ignorant of common sense and misunderstand each other, thinking that after the abolition of the likin, trade and commerce will henceforth be free from taxation, or even using the guise of representing groups, ostensibly forming alliances with merchants while secretly undermining the national economy, they are not only pests of society but also criminals of the party and the state. The four points listed by your association are intended to support the reform policy and are not without merit. They are kept for reference. The Ministry, in charge of finance and taxation, is in the process of gathering Chinese and foreign experts to study appropriate methods for establishing consumption and business taxes, and will present them to the government for approval and implementation, in order to jointly consider both national finances and the people's livelihood. Hubei Province is the founding place of the revolution, and Hankou is a major commercial port of the nine provinces. Your association leads the merchants, and has always understood the greater good. It is hoped that you will vigorously promote this to achieve a common understanding. This is what is greatly hoped," and so on. This telegram is specially disseminated for your information.

<p>The Executive Yuan held its eighth council meeting on the 13th, attended by Jiang Zhongzheng, He Yingqin, Wang Boqun, Liu Ruiheng, Liu Shangqing, Ma Fuxiang, and Sun Ke. Chairman Jiang Zhongzheng presided. (A) Matters Reported: (1) A total of 28 work reports were submitted by various ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments. (B) Matters for Discussion: (1) The Ministry of Interior reported that it had approved the Henan Provincial Government's response to the Zhengzhou and Kaifeng Municipal Governments, which had been resolved by the Provincial Government to abolish them. It also included the reasons for the abolition and requested that it be forwarded for review. After reviewing the reasons stated for abolishing the Zhengzhou and Kaifeng Municipalities, they were deemed to be justified. It was requested that it be reviewed and forwarded to the National Government for approval and implementation. Resolution: Forward to the National Government for approval to abolish them. (2) The Ministry of Industry reported that it had been instructed to review a case in which the Henan Provincial Government reported that the Zhengzhou Municipal Cotton Brokerage Tax could not be abolished and requested that the Finance Department continue to collect it as before.

<h3 id="e74">Song Ziwen Discusses Plans After Abolishing Likin <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Unified Tax and Special Taxes Unified as Central Revenue</p>
<p>Tax Bureau Staff Transferred from Customs Chinese Staff to Fill Positions</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Minister of Finance Song Ziwen came to Tianjin to discuss subsidy tax measures after the abolition of likin with Zhang Xueliang and the northern authorities. Yesterday (the 9th), he spoke with Zhang and financial personnel for a long time. A reporter visited Song today, and according to Mr. Song's account, the general outline of all the facilities after the abolition of likin is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Song first stated that he had not been to the north for more than two years. The finances of the northern provinces have been very chaotic after the war, so he came to inspect them in person and meet with Deputy Commander Zhang and financial personnel to discuss all measures after the abolition of likin. Rumors that he came here for the post-war settlement of the Northwest and the disbandment expenses of the Northwest armies are actually incorrect. The Northwest issue is handled directly by Commanders-in-Chief Jiang and Zhang, and does not require his participation. The subsidy tax after the abolition of likin in the north will be implemented in accordance with the methods stipulated by the central government. However, how to establish bureaus for collection, and where to set up tax bureaus for collecting certain goods, can only be decided after investigation. Deputy Commander Zhang is very decisive in implementing the abolition of likin. Seeing his telegram urging the northern provinces to implement it, such revolutionary measures are admirable. The income from subsidy taxes after the abolition of likin in the northern provinces still cannot make up for the original amount, and the difference will be subsidized by the central government. Currently, all provinces across the country have uniformly complied with the order to abolish likin, and their replies have all arrived at the ministry. The subsidy tax collection method is also uniformly handled in accordance with the provisions of the central government. The subsidy tax consists of two types: unified tax and special consumption tax. The unified tax is levied on five types: cigarettes, wheat flour, matches, cement, and cotton yarn. The first two types have been levied for a long time, and the three types currently being levied are relatively easy to handle. Personnel can be dispatched to the place of production to collect taxes. The tax items listed in the consumption tax are nineteen types. The outside world often misunderstands that with so many tax items, its harshness is not far from likin. In fact, this is not the case, because in implementation, bureaus are set up to collect taxes on major products based on the production conditions of each region. Not every province sets up tax bureaus one by one according to the items listed in the tax items. Therefore, in practice, the tax to be levied in each province is only three or five items. Taxes cannot be levied in areas where they are not produced. In summary, that is, for one type of goods, no matter where it is located, those who have paid taxes can circulate throughout the country without being taxed again. One item, one tax. Those who collect cocoons will no longer collect silk. However, after the abolition of likin, the finances of both the central and local governments are very difficult, and the people should understand this. The soaring price of gold has also made the national economy very difficult, and the central government should carefully consider the gains and losses and formulate new tax rules. The new tax rules for consumption tax and business tax have been submitted by the ministry to the Legislative Yuan for review and promulgation. The reporter asked what would be used as the basis for collection before the new tax was promulgated. Song replied that there may be a slight pause during this period. Some outsiders have criticized us for abolishing likin rashly without sufficient preparation in advance, not knowing that if everything is considered and discussed calmly, there will never be a day for implementation. Therefore, we had to implement it resolutely with the means of cutting the Gordian knot. The reporter also asked how the central and local finances would be divided in the future. Song replied that business tax and stamp tax are local revenue, while unified tax and special consumption tax are central revenue. When local government expenses are insufficient, they will be subsidized by the central government. The Unified Tax Bureau and the Special Tax Bureau are directly under the Ministry of Finance. Before the financial commissioners are abolished, they are supervised by the commissioners. After they are abolished, they are supervised by the Tax Affairs Administration and the Customs Administration. The personnel required by the tax bureaus are all transferred from various customs Chinese staff to fill the positions. Those who are insufficient will be recruited through examinations. The recruited personnel will have a probationary period of six months, and will be awarded positions based on their performance after the period expires. The reason for transferring customs Chinese staff is that they have been trained and are familiar with the rules. After the transfer, the preferential conditions they received in the customs will still be maintained. The appointment service rules and preferential treatment methods for tax bureau staff will also be formulated in accordance with customs precedents. The failure of the likin system was mostly caused by the staff of the likin bureaus. Whenever a new director is appointed, the staff will be changed accordingly, leading to acts of greed and dereliction of duty. After the system is reformed, this malpractice can be swept away. The reporter asked whether the 60 million yuan cigarette public bond has been issued and whether it will be used as a subsidy after the abolition of likin. Song replied that the bonds are still being issued, but not to compensate for the loss of likin. The disbandment of the army and the payment of salaries to the armies attached to the Second Group are all paid from this fund. When asked whether there have been any contacts with foreign countries who are willing to lend money to our country, Song said that the United States is willing to lend money to our country because it has a surplus of domestic silver production. Lending to our country is a way for them to save themselves and does not benefit our country much. When asked whether it is true that regular customs within fifty miles still collect export goods tax, Song said that since the implementation of the new tariff, there have been fewer foreign goods coming in and exports are not very prosperous, so it is being collected temporarily. When asked whether the minister had discussed with Chairman Yan the issue of Shanxi's plan to issue post-war public bonds, which was previously rejected by the central government, Song said that this is one of the Northwest issues and is under the control of Deputy Commander Zhang, and he has no need to contact Chairman Yan. The issuance of public bonds is a major issue and should be considered carefully. When asked whether Chairman Jiang intends to come to the north or go to Shaanxi, Song said that Chairman Jiang is very busy with government affairs and may not be able to spare time for a while. It is heard that Mr. Song will stay in Tianjin for two or three days and will not go to Shenyang. (January 10)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Jiangxi Province's Finances After Abolishing Likin <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Local Annual Income Short by 1.7 Million</p>
<p>Education Treasury Bond Fund Also Not Secured</p>
<p>All Levels of Agencies Reduce Staff and Streamline Administration</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the Jiangxi Provincial Government was ordered to abolish likin, it immediately submitted the matter to the 340th provincial affairs meeting and the tenth temporary meeting on New Year's Eve for discussion and implementation. It was resolved that: (1) A reply to the central government should be submitted, and the abolition of likin should be strictly implemented, and a telegram should be sent to support the central government's abolition of likin. (2) The likin in this province had already been classified as Jiangxi's revenue by the central government's standard for dividing national and local taxes, and the Jiangxi Financial Commissioner should be instructed to implement its abolition. (3) Various local taxes similar to likin should be immediately ordered by the Finance Department to investigate and abolish them separately, and alternative subsidies should be planned and submitted for approval. Currently, various special tax bureaus and consumption tax bureaus in Jiangxi Province were closed on New Year's Eve last year. In the past, the Nancun Municipal Special Tax, Jiangxi Autonomous Special Tax, and 55% surtax on cigarettes and alcohol attached to likin have all been abolished. Recently, Huang Bozhong, member of the Provincial Committee and Director of the Finance Department, proposed to the provincial government that the taxes and levies in Jiangxi Province similar to likin have been abolished in accordance with the Ministry's telegram. It is estimated that local income will be reduced by 970,000 yuan annually. The livestock tax is currently being consulted with the Ministry of Finance for a reply. If it also needs to be abolished, the annual local revenue will be reduced by more than 1.8 million yuan. However, the revenue from the business tax, in addition to offsetting the original tooth tax of 100,000 yuan, is only 100,000 yuan in actual income. The statistical deficit is more than 1.7 million yuan. It seems that the provincial government should transfer to the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the provisions of Item C of the Yuan Decree, and allocate the funds for subsidies to maintain the current financial situation in Jiangxi Province so that local administration will not be interrupted. It is heard that the provincial government has decided to send members Xiong Yuxi and Chen Zanyu, director of the Salt Transport Bureau, to Beijing to ask Chairman Jiang and Finance Minister Song for instructions on subsidy measures. In addition, the salt tax has been classified as central revenue, and local surcharges on salt have also been abolished. This item is also a major source of revenue for Jiangxi, amounting to about 5 million yuan annually, and is designated for education funds and repayment of treasury bond funds. Since it has been abolished, the education treasury bond fund has been fundamentally shaken. Each treasury bond of one yuan is now worth less than the South Corner, and the education sector is sending letters and telegrams asking for remedies because education funds are not secured. The Provincial Education Federation has also telegraphed to request Director Jiang of the Education Department, who is inspecting Yiyang, to return to the province to properly plan measures. The Education Department has also sent Section Chief Deng to Beijing to ask for instructions on everything. It is found that the finances of this province are due to the fact that the communist bandits are all over the territory, and the income is less than two-tenths of the budget, resulting in arrears of several million yuan in political expenses. Various agencies have not been paid for four or five months. The solar New Year's Eve already feels like the end of the road, and the circulating coupons have fallen to 80%, and the common people are crying out in pain. After the abolition of likin, the difficulties can be imagined. Currently, the Finance Department, in addition to sending people everywhere to collect grain, all agencies have adopted a tight policy, reducing staff and streamlining administration. Even the municipal government, due to the abolition of municipal donations, has reduced its administration by two-thirds and laid off many employees. The rest of the agencies will also carry out large-scale layoffs and pay cuts. Public officials are all in danger of being dismissed. (January 12)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Zhang Xueliang Discusses China's Peaceful Unification and East Asia <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In response to a request from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun of Japan, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang wrote an article entitled "China's Peaceful Unification and East Asia" before the Lunar New Year, which was published in the newspaper's New Year's Day special issue in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Readers can see Zhang's latest views on the domestic and international situation. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>"At the end of the 19th year of the Republic of China, a reporter from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun of Japan asked for a preface for the New Year's Day supplement. The letters were frequent, and I could not elaborate. Let me briefly describe what I have been thinking about in response. Since the Republic of China, there have been frequent turmoil and disorder in the political situation. It is not enough to revive itself internally, and it does not benefit friendly countries externally. It has only burdened itself with failures, and I am very ashamed of it. This is not to mention. However, national turmoil is something that should be experienced in the process of political evolution. In this process, it is impossible to be completely perfect in handling internal and external affairs. What can be comforting is that our people, who are in the midst of glory and decline, have never changed their integrity of peace and honesty. Although they are gentle, they do not eat others. Although they are strong, they do not spit others out. Even in this process of turmoil, those who seek peace and eliminate chaos have always been consistent. The completion of this unification took less than ten days. Xue Liang's clever telegram was only an occasional trigger. The centripetal force and love that have been accumulated and condensed still come from the people's self-awareness. It is by no means something that can be done by one hand or one foot. For example, the central government did not make excessive demands when the peace talks were first concluded, but showed leniency. Yan and Feng did not fight to the bitter end, but stopped fighting on their own. All of this is enough to prove that the root of peace of our people is deeply rooted in people's hearts. Although the disputes between brothers may occasionally undergo changes, the clear waves and autumn waters will eventually lead to tranquility. Is it not a generous measure and a common creation? Is the virtue of humility the same as the original nature?</p>
<p>Moreover, looking at the historical examples of China and the West, the cause of governance and peace cannot be separated from armor and soldiers. Only Mencius has the saying that those who do not like to kill people can unite the world. However, it is only a theoretical suspension, thousands of years away. He actually fulfilled his previous words. Peaceful unification is really a precedent. If we can expand this path, then the way to attract peace and pacify the world is not only to make up for the previous shortcomings, but also to be the initial foundation of the Great Harmony. Japan and China are separated by a strip of water, dependent on each other. Those who share the same race, the same script, the same politics, and the same religion have been around for thousands of years. Therefore, their feelings of love are not very far apart. The friendship of sharing weal and woe should also be more important than other countries. Now that China has initially unified the world and a grand foundation has just been opened, we should work together to achieve prosperity. As a brotherly country, Japan is close in affection and adjacent in territory. The so-called congratulation of the emperor's crown and the congratulation of neighbors are naturally very different from ordinary people. Moreover, the lips and teeth are closely connected, and the interests are shared. Politics, education, and culture are closely connected. What is especially needed and cannot be separated is the issue of supply and demand between the two countries.</p>
<p>In general, China's exports are mostly necessary for Japan, and the sales of Japanese industries are concentrated in China. Therefore, China's governance and chaos, prosperity and decline are related to Japan. Assuming that from now on, China's fields and products will become more abundant day by day, its supply and demand from Japan will be boundless, and Japan's national wealth will gradually increase. If, on the contrary, there is continuous turmoil and all industries are depressed, then it will be reversed. The shortage of Japanese commodities and raw materials will directly affect people's livelihood and indirectly affect its national power. This is evidenced by the fact that the decline in silver prices this year has affected the business districts of neighboring countries, which is even more obvious. Therefore, China's peace invisibly guarantees Japan's prosperity. The prosperity of China and Japan will enable East Asia to maintain its safety. This key is not very related to any political or cultural issues. In short, economic conditions are the key to the mutual needs and shared prosperity of the two countries, and this key is not something that both parties can have on their own. It must be achieved with a corresponding attitude of mutual assistance, and it cannot be maintained without failure. This is what Xue Liang dares to firmly believe. In terms of the current world situation, various places in Asia are very easy to become the focus of contention among various countries. After the European War, scholars often regarded one end of China as the second Balkan Peninsula, which is enough to cause the world to be uneasy again. Although their words may not be very accurate, and whether or not they are willing to be slaughtered depends on themselves, the seriousness of the East Asian issue seems to be undeniable. Therefore, to achieve world peace, the first step should be to seek it in East Asia. How to realize and maintain East Asian peace depends on whether Japan and China can implement friendship. The so-called friendship is not in verbal propaganda, but in actual performance. The past gaps and constraints between the two countries, as well as the future doubts and obstacles, should be frankly believed and permanently resolved. I hope that people from both countries will further ensure their mutual stability and bear the responsibility for peace in East Asia. This is not only for the benefit of East Asia, but also for the needs of the world. This is also the sincere hope of Xue Liang for the efforts of the sages of both countries." (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Handling of Counter-Revolutionary Suspects in Bengbu <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Communist Shi Yuyao Escorted to Headquarters for Interrogation</p>
<p>Other Arrested Persons Temporarily Released on Bail</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Last month, the Bengbu military police successively arrested 14 suspected counter-revolutionaries at the Second Provincial Rural Normal School in Bengshan, Bengbu. After an interrogation by the military law office of the Anhui North Garrison Headquarters, the arrested Dean of Studies Hou Mengxuan, Dean of Student Affairs Xie Juemin, and others confessed that only the actions of students Shi Yuyao and Yang Chonghan seemed suspicious. On December 11, the anniversary of the Communist Party's riot in Guangzhou, Shi and Yang went out without asking for leave and did not return until late. In addition, they requested the issuance of uniforms and incited a wave of unrest. When the military police inspected, Shi Yuyao burned books in the kitchen. The military judge then brought Shi Yuyao and Yang Chonghan for questioning. The two firmly refused to confess and were sent back to prison. Garrison Commander Shu Lihuang, in order to get to the bottom of the matter, ordered Jiang Yangzheng, director of the military law office, to go to the school with the military judge and adjutant to investigate. After two investigations, and verifying the opinions of all parties, it was confirmed that Shi Yuyao was indeed suspected of being a counter-revolutionary. The military law office checked the case file of the communist Shen Chaoxian, which was presented by Song Shike, commander of the Third Detachment, and found letters from Jiang Yigong (aka Jiang Chuanzheng) and Jiang Mengping (aka Jiang Chuanhe), students of the Second Rural Normal School, to Shen.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>In the middle, Shi Yuyao also added his own words. After the investigation was completed, Shi Yuyao was interrogated five more times, and the evidence and documents obtained from the investigation were proved one by one. After repeated rebuttals, he finally did not deny it. Shi confessed to joining the Communist Party and taking on propaganda work, and confessed that he was introduced into the party by Ding Zhengfang from Liu'an. Ding was short and stocky, with a face full of pimples, and his hair was pointed. He was about 20 years old. He also personally wrote three reports (the text is very long and contains words of wishing to repent). The garrison headquarters, believing that Shi had confessed to joining the Communist Party, presented Shi and the entire case file to the Nanjing Headquarters for interrogation a few days ago. As for the Communist Party member Ding Zhengfang, who was confessed, he has been separately ordered to be wanted. The other people, such as Hou Mengxuan, Xie Juemin, Wang Baosheng, Yang Chonghan, Zhu Wenhao, Tong Xiemin, Zhou Guangmo, Xu Zenglin, Cheng Xiangfu, Weng Fenglan, and Zhan Zhao, were interrogated repeatedly, but no suspicion was found. They have all been temporarily released on bail, pending the handling of the headquarters. However, Jiang Chuanzheng and Jiang Chuanhe are still being held in the garrison headquarters. Whether they are suspected or not will be determined after a clear investigation. (January 9)</p>
<h3 id="e78">British Economic Investigation Group Arrives in Hankou <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The British Far East Economic Investigation Group, which came to China to investigate commerce, arrived in Beijing last month, and then went north to Liaoning. The group members Sir Alan, Greening, Dax, and Nais, after traveling from Liaoning to Tianjin, transferred by train south and arrived in Beijing on the 3rd of this month. They changed to the Ruhe wheel and came to Hankou with Mr. Mir, the British Consul in Ningbo. They arrived at the wharf at 3 pm on the 9th. The Hankou Municipal Government sent Pang Shengzhong, chief of the Fourth Section of the Secretariat, together with representatives from the General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, the Landlords Association, the Cotton Industry Association, and the United Yarn Factory Association, as well as British Consul General in Hankou, Mr. Balang, and overseas Chinese businessmen, to welcome them at the wharf. The British Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce held a special banquet on the afternoon of the 10th and invited local commercial leaders to accompany them. After the banquet, Alan and others took cars to inspect the Hankou riverside and prosperous streets for a week. The Hankou Municipal Government, the General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, the Landlords Association, the Cotton Industry Association, the United Yarn Factory Association, and other organizations held a banquet at the Bankers Association on the 11th to discuss opinions on Sino-British trade. The tour schedule was also set to start on the 11th, visiting the First Yarn Factory and major factories in Wuhan. On the 12th, they visited the Hankou Municipal Government, the Jianghan Customs, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the Salt Affairs Audit Office. On the 13th, they rested. On the 14th, they left Hankou and returned to Shanghai. According to Sir Alan, a member of the group, the investigation in China was briefly as follows: "Our group came to China purely to investigate your country's commerce in order to seek mutual development between China and the United Kingdom. After arriving in Shanghai in December last year, we immediately entered Beijing and went to the Northeast Provinces and Tianjin for investigation. We were very satisfied along the way. Currently, eight members of the group, including Sir Thomas, are still staying in the Northeast Provinces and will go to Shanghai in the next few days. We can only stay in Hankou for a few days. On the 27th, we will go to Hong Kong from Shanghai with Thomas and others, and return to the country via Canada. After our group returns to the country, we will strive for mutual development in commerce between the two countries." (January 10)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Plans for Suppressing Bandits and Purifying the Countryside in Henan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Proposed by Liu Zhenhua and Li Mingzhong</p>
<p>Draft Outline of the Plan for Suppressing Bandits and Purifying the Countryside to be Implemented in Henan Province by Liu Zhenhua and Li Mingzhong: (1) For this bandit suppression and countryside purification, it is proposed to divide each county in the entire province into districts and implement them simultaneously. Major bandit gangs will be the responsibility of the military to suppress, while scattered small bandits will be the responsibility of the county magistrate to supervise and order the police and militias to eliminate. At the same time, countryside purification will be implemented simultaneously with the suppression of bandit gangs and the elimination of scattered bandits to eliminate the source of bandits. (Explanation) Bandit suppression is a temporary measure, while countryside purification is a fundamental solution. The two are mutually necessary and dependent and should be implemented immediately without interruption. Simply suppressing bandits without purifying the countryside is not enough to eliminate the source of bandits. If countryside purification is not implemented immediately during bandit suppression, or if it is not carried out simultaneously in all counties of the province, then they will simply flee from one place to another, making it difficult to eradicate them completely. Therefore, this article places special emphasis on simultaneous implementation throughout the province to achieve complete success. (2) The military's bandit suppression areas will be divided based on the situation of bandit strongholds and the necessities of military operations. Remaining scattered bandits and countryside purification areas will be divided into four districts based on the old circuits. (Explanation) Military bandit suppression is a special operation for temporary treatment, so it seems appropriate to divide the area according to the needs of the situation to facilitate it. As for the elimination of scattered bandits, countryside purification, and the general operation throughout the province, it seems appropriate to utilize the interconnectedness of the county boundaries and the customary cooperation in defense and suppression over the years to achieve cooperative results. Therefore, it is proposed to use the old circuits as the areas. (3) All matters related to the division of bandit suppression areas and the allocation of troops shall be presided over and convened by the director of the Kaifeng Field Headquarters, with the resident Henan pacification supervisors and military officers meeting to formulate specific regulations, and each shall be responsible for suppression within their respective areas. (4) All matters related to the division of countryside purification areas and the handling of countryside purification shall be handled by the chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, who will make overall plans and notify the responsible officers and pacification supervisors to consult with the chairman and supervise the implementation within their respective areas. (Explanation) According to the provisions of Article 6 of the Countryside Purification Regulations, the director-general of the Countryside Purification Bureau in each province shall be concurrently held by the chairman of each province. Also, according to the provisions of Article 7 of the Provisional Organization Regulations of the Pacification Supervisor's Office, countryside purification matters shall be implemented by each supervisor in consultation with the provincial government to supervise its subordinates. Hence, the proposal of this article. (5) All troops that do not participate in bandit suppression shall be transferred by the director of the Field Headquarters to suitable locations for training. (6) The director of the Field Headquarters shall strictly prohibit all troops stationed in Henan from hiring or appeasing bandits. (7) The bandit suppression strategy shall focus on encircling and exterminating them. When encountering fleeing bandits who must be pursued, the director of the Field Headquarters shall notify the officers in charge of bandit suppression in each area and the troops in neighboring provinces to intercept them separately, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. (8) The methods for joint military suppression and the regulations for police and militia cooperation in suppression, arrest, and defense shall be formulated separately by the director and the chairman and shall be notified to all bandit suppression troops and ordered to all county magistrates. (Explanation) The bandit gangs' entrenchment and the scattered bandits' escape often exploit gaps at the junctions of areas to evade capture. It is insufficient to prevent their spread without emphasizing the joint suppression by the military and the coordinated actions of the police and militias. Therefore, it is specifically requested to clearly define the joint suppression methods and various regulations for application. (9) In addition to handling the organization of the countryside purification organs in accordance with the Countryside Purification Regulations, it is proposed to establish several inspection commissioners within the General Bureau, divided by district, stationed in suitable locations in each district, to promptly supervise and inspect the areas where bandit gangs are entrenched. The provincial government may also allocate several countryside purification commissioners to each bandit suppression troop so that they can immediately promote countryside purification after bandit suppression to avoid delays. (Explanation) After the bandit gangs are eliminated, the military's power should be used to immediately foster local righteousness and expedite urgent tasks in countryside purification, such as searching for escaped bandits, inspecting firearms, and investigating household registrations. The situation in areas where bandit gangs are entrenched is different from that in other ordinary counties. Relying solely on the county magistrate to concurrently handle these matters amidst his busy schedule is insufficient to meet the urgent needs. It seems appropriate for the provincial government to allocate several experienced personnel to each troop to supervise the local officials and gentry to implement them diligently to avoid perfunctory and dilatory practices. (10) In addition to handling the procedures for implementing countryside purification in accordance with the Countryside Purification Regulations, it is proposed to pay special attention to dissolving all improper local organizations through persuasion and coercion, as stipulated in Article 25 of the original regulations. Furthermore, the province's security regiments should be organized in accordance with the county security regiment regulations. (Explanation) The province's countryside purification methods, such as investigating household registrations, implementing mutual guarantee and joint responsibility among neighbors, inspecting firearms, and handling funding, rewards, and punishments, have been clearly defined in the Countryside Purification Regulations and will not be repeated here. However, it has been found that there are numerous small, improper organizations in various counties, such as various types of heretical societies, whose situations are pitiful. Not only are they unable to defend themselves, but they also cause chaos. Special attention should be paid to dissolving them properly through persuasion and coercion to eliminate the source of chaos. As for the province's security regiments, they have been repeatedly reorganized and utilized by the stationed troops in recent years, resulting in inconsistent organization and numerous abuses. They have not been guided onto the right track. It now seems appropriate to strictly adhere to the National Government's county security regiment law, reorganize them, and implement the method of joint guarantees by squad leaders and joint guarantees by all households in the same squad to establish a foundation for social stability. (11) When implementing countryside purification and registering household populations, it is proposed to simultaneously compile autonomous regions such as districts, townships, towns, neighborhoods, and villages in accordance with the County Organization Law, as stipulated in Article 19 of the Countryside Purification Regulations, to assist in the implementation of political tutelage. (Explanation) It seems that this countryside purification should be truly implemented. When investigating household registrations, the various levels of autonomous regions should be compiled simultaneously in accordance with the County Organization Law to achieve a permanent solution and establish a reference for future implementation of political tutelage. This is the first fundamental plan for governing Henan. According to the provisions of Article 2 of the County Organization Implementation Law, Henan Province should complete county organization by August of the 19th year. However, military affairs have repeatedly arisen in recent years, resulting in delays. Now that military affairs have been resolved, it is possible to take advantage of this large-scale countryside purification to carry it out incidentally so that it can be completed as soon as possible and avoid the labor of repeating it in the future. It seems to be the same as the work of conscription and rewards. (12) The Provincial Government shall formulate methods for handling the surrender of bandits who surrender their weapons to avoid death and the surrender of innocent people who have been coerced, and shall properly formulate separate regulations for post-disaster relief and resettlement in areas severely affected by bandits and for recruiting refugees to resume new cultivation and implement them separately. (13) The Provincial Government shall write and disseminate popular propaganda to arouse the public's sympathy and assistance for bandit suppression and countryside purification. Publications that persuade various types of heretical societies shall also be widely compiled and disseminated to awaken the confused and stubborn. In order to increase the efficiency of bandit suppression and countryside purification, appropriate deadlines for bandit suppression and countryside purification shall be formulated separately with reference to the regulations and taking into account local conditions for joint compliance.

Zhang Zhijiang first led the entire group in holding a memorial week, and then the presidium chairman Ma Yinbing chaired the discussion of the proposals as follows: A. Search and Suppression Group: (1) The Supervisor's Office proposed that countryside purification and search and suppression must be carried out simultaneously, and it is proposed to urgently implement rewards and punishments to invigorate the decadent and show encouragement. Resolved: Passed. (2) Proposed method for implementing the surrender of bandits. Resolved: Passed in principle. The surrender regulations will be submitted to the General Headquarters for approval after they are finalized before implementation. (3) Zhenjiang County proposed that the Supervisor's Office's subordinate teams be drawn to be stationed in Zhenjiang Shangdang Baoyan Gaozi and other places to prevent and suppress bandit disasters in order to strengthen provincial defenses and secure people's homes. (4) Jiangning County proposed to eliminate bandits in Maoshan Jiufeng Mountain and along the Yangtze River. The two cases were merged and resolved: The Security Department will allocate considerable troops nearby to be stationed in Shangdang and other places to engage in prevention and suppression. (5) Zhenjiang County proposed that the Supervisor's Office's subordinate teams each form guerrilla squads to supervise the local security regiments to search bandit dens at any time in order to purify the source of bandits. Resolved: Each county shall specially report to the Supervisor's Office to designate appropriate troops to assist the county magistrate in handling matters when needed. (6) Rugao County proposed that the pacification policy should focus on Xuzhou and Huai'an in order to purify the source of bandits and avoid their proliferation. Resolved: Handed over to the Supervisor's Office for handling. (7) Rugao County proposed that Jiangyin should be pacified in order to cut off the source of bandit weapons. Resolved: The Supervisor's Office shall order the port water and land police teams to strictly search to prevent the source, and shall also inform the Shanghai Municipal Government to order a uniform ban. (8) Rugao County proposed that the sea area should be pacified in order to maintain the livelihood of fishermen. (9) The Jiangsu Agricultural Department proposed to join the Civil Affairs Department and the Security Department to find ways to eliminate pirates and protect fishermen. The two cases were merged and resolved: The Supervisor's Office will join the Provincial Government in requesting the General Headquarters to allocate the navy to assist in the suppression within a time limit. (10) Xiaoxian County proposed to allocate a part of the troops directly under the Pacification Supervisor's Office to be stationed at the junction of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan provinces to eliminate bandit gangs on the border so that the local area can be permanently relieved of pain. Resolved: Passed in principle. (11) Jurong County proposed that the pacification troops should choose to be stationed in key areas after the search and suppression in order to facilitate the holding of countryside purification. Resolved: Passed in principle. (12) Liang Guanying proposed that bandit suppression should concentrate forces. Resolved: The Supervisor's Office will handle the matter according to the reports of the counties regarding how to allocate bandit suppression forces. (13) Liang Guanying proposed that the Provincial Government should be requested to issue a notice to the local authorities under its jurisdiction to actively assist the bandit suppression troops. Resolved: Passed. (14) Funing County proposed to set up shallow-water naval vessels for the Huaihai River to replace the water police sentinel ships for water and land patrol. Resolved: The counties concerned should jointly submit a special report to the Provincial Government for handling. (15) Baoying County proposed that before the establishment of the salt farm Gao Bao Huai Xing six counties' dike water patrol team, troops should be allocated to be stationed in the important passes along the dike to prevent blockage. Resolved: Passed. (16) Suqian County proposed that the stationed troops should be ordered to assist the local administrative officers in handling countryside purification. Resolved: Merged with the Countryside Purification Group for discussion. (17) Suqian County proposed that the 95th Brigade should be stationed in Suqian for a long time to eliminate bandits. Resolved: If the county needs it, the county magistrate should submit a special report to the Supervisor's Office for approval. (18) Suqian County proposed that the bandits captured in Jiangbei should still be handled in accordance with the previous bandit suppression regulations. Resolved: Merged with other groups for discussion. B. Countryside Purification Group: (1) Tongshan County proposed that the Xuzhou's Fengxiao Tongpei and five counties' joint defense zone should expedite the countryside purification. Resolved: Passed. The Provincial Government will forward it to the five counties to expedite the handling. (2) Jiangsu Evening News suggested that the gentry who reward countryside purification should be rewarded. Resolved: Passed. The specific regulations will be sent to the Provincial Government for formulation and implementation. (3) Jingjiang County proposed to formulate methods for purchasing civilian-held firearms and regulations for punishing those who hide them without reporting. Resolved: Seriously inspect civilian-held firearms, no need to buy them. Those who hide them without reporting shall be treated as privately storing military firearms. C. Self-Defense Group: (1) Tongshan County proposed that the security regiments of each county should be thoroughly reorganized and trained in order to strengthen the public's military force and eliminate bandit disasters. Resolved: Passed. D. Post-Disaster Group: (1) The Construction Department proposed to request the Supervisor's Office to draw troops to dig out the shallow sections of the Li Canal in order to help farmers and enrich people's lives. Resolved: The method of drawing soldiers to dig out the shallow sections of the Li Canal is very good. However, whether the pacification troops can be drawn should be determined by the Supervisor's Office and then discussed with the Construction Department. (2) The Agriculture and Mines Department proposed to carry out land reclamation to eliminate salt bandits and pacify Jiangbei. (3) It also proposed to make suggestions for pacification and post-disaster and request public decision to assist in the progress. The two cases were merged and resolved: Regarding the reclamation of land by soldiers, this is a fundamental method to eliminate the source of bandits. However, this matter is of great importance, and the Supervisor's Office should be requested to join the Provincial Government in formulating regulations and organizing a pacification and post-disaster committee to discuss in detail. As for planning the establishment of branches of the Farmers' Bank, promoting the operation of cooperatives, promoting new agricultural tools, and distributing superior seedlings, the Supervisor's Office should be requested to order its subordinates to be responsible for protection and assist in the promotion at any time. E. Other Groups: (1) The Supervisor's Office proposed to pacify the Taihu Lake area. (2) Wuxian County proposed that bandits have been harming the Taihu Lake and other places for a long time, and military institutions should be established on the east and west mountains of Dongting to be responsible for prevention and suppression, and to surround the bandit areas on all sides to eliminate them in one fell swoop. The two cases were merged and resolved: Passed in principle. The detailed method will be discussed and handled by the Supervisor's Office and the Provincial Government.</p>
<p>After the proposals were resolved, the closing ceremony was held at 6:00 PM that evening. Zhang Zhijiang delivered the closing speech, and Hu Pu'an, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, also gave a speech. After the speeches, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Merchants Request Reduction of Electricity Fees The Jiaxing merchants Huamei and Fang, etc., believe that the electricity rates charged by the Bingming Electric Light Company are much higher than those in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Moreover, power outages occur frequently, which is not what a public electric utility should do. Therefore, they jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department, County Government, and County Construction Bureau yesterday, ordering the company to implement reductions.

Although the land and water police arrived after hearing the alarm, the robbers had already escaped without a trace. In an area guarded by land and water police, robbers calmly arrived and plundered to their fill, which is not only chilling but also encourages theft. Where can the safety of the entire county be entrusted? Therefore, they telegraphed President Jiang of the National Government and the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, strictly ordering local officials to quickly investigate and apprehend the robbers within a set deadline. They also requested that local officials be held responsible for strengthening the prevention of local security and public safety in the future.</p>

It repeatedly petitioned the provincial government and the central government for abolishment to reduce the burden on citizens. However, the central government, considering the special circumstances of Ningbo, did not approve the abolishment. Because the suffering of citizens could not be alleviated as long as the municipal government was not abolished, it continued the movement to abolish the city in December of last year, jointly petitioning the provincial government to dissolve the city. It is now learned that the provincial government approved the abolishment of the Ningbo Municipal Government at the 366th provincial affairs meeting, to be taken over by the Yin County Government, and ordered the municipal government to complete the closure before the 15th of this month.</p>

After the establishment of the municipal government, the city and county were governed separately, and it was renamed the Ningbo Municipal Public Security Bureau. According to reliable provincial sources, after the provincial government abolishes the Ningbo Municipality, considering Ningbo's importance as a major trading port and the extreme importance of public security, it plans to merge the municipal and county public security bureaus and rename it the Ningbo Trading Port Police Department. It will also adopt the organizational structure of the Capital Police Department, renaming the district offices as the First Bureau, Second Bureau, etc., for unified command.

<h3 id="e93">National Central University's First Memorial Week This Year, Zhu Jiahua Reports on School Affairs <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Explaining the Purpose of Changing the Academy Deans and Establishing Five Groups</p>
<p>Central University held the first Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week of this year at Boming Hall at 11 AM on the 12th. More than 500 faculty, staff, and students attended. The meeting was presided over by President Zhu Jiahua. The chairman's report stated briefly: "Since I arrived at the school, this is the first time I have attended the Memorial Week. When I took office, it coincided with the beginning of the annual holidays, and I did not have many opportunities to meet everyone. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief report on the aspects of the school that should be reported to everyone. (1) The administrative organization of our school has always been slightly different from that of other universities in China. It is roughly divided into two departments: academic affairs and general affairs. On the one hand, there is the Academic Council, and on the other hand, there is the Academic Affairs Meeting. Similarly, on the one hand, there is the General Affairs Office or Administrative Office, and on the other hand, there is the Academic Affairs Office. Since the promulgation of the University Regulations, the organization of various schools must be changed. Our school has established three departments: Secretariat, Administrative Affairs, and Academic Affairs, each with a director. Although the University Regulations do not explicitly stipulate how many departments should be established, it seems from the regulations that Academic Affairs and Administrative Affairs can be integrated and need not be separated. Former President Zhang merged the three departments and changed them to a General Affairs Office, which is not different from the original intention of the admission organization regulations. In fact, 'administrative affairs arise from academic affairs and need not be separated and independent from administrative affairs.' Therefore, administrative affairs should be simplified as much as possible and should not be overemphasized. Even the former five offices need not be independent. Therefore, school affairs are handled by five groups: Registration, Documentation, Publication, General Affairs, and Accounting. This is sufficient to increase efficiency and save administrative expenses. In the future, a secretary-general will be added to complete the organization. This plan was decided before I took office and was not based on the request of anyone. A few days ago, I saw a news report saying that it was suggested by students of our school, which is completely untrue. However, some students did ask me about the administrative organization of our school, and I told them my decision. I hope that all students will work hard on academics. I will be responsible for the development of the school. As for the appointments of each group, they have now been hired and are all people with in-depth education, rich knowledge, and the ability to handle affairs. They also do not hold other positions and have their own expertise. Things will naturally go smoothly. (2) Some of the deans of the academies have already resigned to President Zhang. Although I have repeatedly tried to retain them, they cannot dismiss their intention due to various reasons, and some have been resigning for a long time and have left. I had no choice but to hire others. I have now hired Mr. Guo Xinsong to act as the dean of the Law School, and Mr. Zhuang Zexuan to act as the dean of the Education School. Dean Chen Maojie of the College of Engineering had already resigned several times, but I repeatedly asked him to stay, and he has agreed to temporarily continue to be responsible before the appointment of a successor. Dean Bu Bingwen of the College of Agriculture resigned and went to Shanghai because he could not separate himself from his duties in Shanghai. Now, I have invited Gu Xiyu to succeed him. Each of the other colleges has different changes of which the various deans are all well-known scholars with profound knowledge, and I think everyone knows that. (3) There is one more point to report, which is about the issue of funding. Of course, this is a matter of great concern to everyone. The Ministry of Finance and Jiangsu Province have always allocated funds to our school, and the funds are disbursed earlier than to other agencies. The outstanding funds are not much, which shows the government's sincerity in maintaining education. However, our school owes a lot due to construction and other equipment, perhaps several hundred thousand. Because the handover of the previous administration has not been completed, it is not very clear. The first step is to sort out the debts, and then all the construction can be planned and gradually carried out. Today, I will first talk to you about the above points, and there will be many opportunities to meet in the future. I will report everything in the school to everyone at any time."</p>

<p>Held on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of This Month</p>
<p>Concurrent Agricultural Exhibition</p>
<p>Wuxi Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute has a tradition of holding an achievement exhibition once every semester. This allows outsiders to observe, teachers and students to interact and improve, and contribute to public education, agricultural education, and academics. This kind of exhibition has been held twice, with remarkable achievements that have been widely praised. It is now learned that the opening date of this semester's exhibition has been set for the 16th, 17th, and 18th of this month. The organization of the exhibition is divided into three departments: building affairs, exhibition list, and performance. Specialists have long been appointed to be responsible for the preparation. The collection of exhibits can be roughly divided into seven categories: 1. Administrative system charts of the institute; 2. Plans, reports, publications, etc. of each department (including each experimental agency and internship group); 3. Student grades and internship work reports; 4. Public achievements of each experimental agency and internship group; 6. Personal works and essays of teachers and students; 7. Others. In terms of dynamic aspects, it is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 16th, a public performance at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, a performance by students of the institute at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th, and an awards ceremony at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th.

<p>Funds Peking University's Innovation Program</p>
<p>Giving 1 Million Yuan Over Five Years, Peking University Also Contributes 1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation held its fifth regular meeting in Shanghai on January 9th. The details of the meeting were seen in the newspapers the other day. Today, the Honorary Secretary of the Foundation, Mr. Hu Shih, gave a speech, revealing that among the motions of the meeting was a case to donate 200,000 yuan annually to Peking University for a period of five years, specifically for the purpose of hiring research chairs and special professors, which is the most important event in domestic higher education in recent years. The following is a record of Mr. Hu's speech. At this meeting, the American director, Mr. Gu Lin, proposed that the Foundation contribute 200,000 yuan annually from the fiscal year of the 20th year of the Republic to the National Peking University for a period of five years, specifically for the establishment of research chairs and special professorships. The conditions and purpose are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Foundation and Peking University will each contribute 200,000 yuan annually, for a total of 400,000 yuan, as a special fund for a period of five years.</p>
<p>(2) The uses of this fund are five: (A) Establishment of research chairs, each with an annual salary of 6,000 to 9,000 yuan; (B) Establishment of special professorships, each with an annual salary of 4,800 to 6,000 yuan; (C) Each chair and professorship is accompanied by a corresponding book equipment fee; (D) Establishment of scholarships to assist hardworking and talented students; (E) Establishment of scholarships to reward students who have achieved success in research for advanced research at home or abroad.</p>
<p>(3) The above-mentioned research chairs and special professors must devote themselves to academic research and guide students in academic research, and must not hold any paid or unpaid teaching or administrative duties outside the school. After the new president of Peking University, Mr. Jiang Menglin, agreed to the motion, he submitted it to the fifth regular meeting of the Foundation. Director Jiang requested to recuse himself to avoid suspicion. After a long discussion, the following motion was unanimously passed: "The proposal to cooperate with Peking University to establish research chairs and special professorships is approved in principle, and the Executive Committee of the Foundation will negotiate with the President of Peking University to formulate detailed measures and contract clauses and submit them to the next annual meeting for formal decision." The intention of the above cooperation method is to designate a university with historical significance to pilot a fundamental remedy for university education. Today's university education has three major difficulties: 1. The salaries of professors are too low. The monthly salary of a professor at a national university is not as high as that of a section chief in the government. The highest monthly salary of a professor at Peking University is only 300 yuan, so everyone is doing side jobs to support themselves. 2. The funding for schools is not fixed. Poor scholars do not dare to rely on the salary of a school for a living. 3. Seventy to eighty percent of the school's funding is used for salaries, leaving no money to purchase books and equipment. Therefore, even if there are specialists, they cannot concentrate on advanced academic research. The above method is intended to raise professors' salaries, guarantee the stability of funding, and fully expand the equipment of books and instruments. With one move, all three difficulties can be resolved.</p>
<p>According to the estimation of the original proposer, after this case is established,</p>
<p>Nine research chairs with an average annual salary of 7,000 yuan can be established,</p>
<p>Fifteen special professors with an average annual salary of 5,400 yuan,</p>
<p>Fifteen scholarships of 200 yuan per year,</p>
<p>Fifteen scholarships of 600 yuan per year,</p>
<p>Twelve scholarships of 10,000 yuan per year for graduate students studying abroad,</p>
<p>The above five items total about 176,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The remaining 200,000 yuan will be used to purchase books and equipment and reorganize libraries and laboratories. Over five years, a total of 2 million yuan will be dedicated to improving academic research. Although the pilot project is limited to Peking University, its influence will surely awaken universities across the country to catch up and compete with Peking University in academic pursuits. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Orders Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to inquire whether to ban graduates of unregistered private schools from serving as teachers in municipal schools. After the Ministry of Education received the report, it instructed the bureau yesterday (12th): "It is understood that Shanghai and its nearby areas have a large number of graduates from normal schools. The selection of teachers for elementary schools should be based on those who are qualified. Graduates of unregistered private schools must not be employed as elementary school teachers unless they have passed the examination. Those who have been approved for registration by the bureau but have not been formally examined should be inspected and identified at any time. Those who have not been registered should not be registered again in order to emphasize the qualifications of teachers and prevent abuses. This order."</p>
<h3 id="e101">Ministry of Education's Attitude Toward the Student Unrest at the Private Anhui High School in Shanghai <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Private Anhui High School experienced a student unrest. The Shanghai Education Bureau sent personnel to investigate the truth and submitted it to the Ministry of Education for review. After the Ministry of Education received the report, it instructed the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday: "It is understood that the Shanghai Private Anhui High School experienced a strike, and reactionary words were found in leaflets and newspapers. It is said that it was caused by a group of teachers and students colluding with each other. The school has expelled Xu Meishou and other students who caused trouble. The students gathered to the school to destroy it, which is extremely illegal. Since Xu Meishou has been arrested, he should be brought to justice for interrogation. The Public Security Bureau should be transferred to pay attention to the actions of the teachers and students who instigated the unrest in the school at any time to avoid further incidents. However, after investigating the report of the school principal Li Zhenya on the cause of the unrest, he only said that a small number of ambitious teachers directed a small number of students to organize a revolutionary student association in the school, post reactionary slogans, and organize a strike committee to welcome representatives of the Shanghai Revolutionary Student Union to the school to openly preach and coerce a strike. What excuse did the teachers and students use to stir up the unrest? The school principal did not mention it in the report and completely attributed the responsibility for the unrest to others. Based on the meaning of self-reflection, he is too negligent and the report lacks detailed facts. According to the investigators sent by the bureau, the teachers of the school claimed that the students pointed out that the school's equipment was inadequate, and that instruments and books were missing. The current principal is purchasing them. It is clear that the cause of the unrest in the school is also there. Teaching instruments such as books and instruments must not be lacking and should be prepared at the beginning of the opening. Even if the unrest has another background, it is undeniable that the school is poorly managed. The Ministry believes that dealing with the unrest is one matter, and rectifying the school is another matter. The teachers and students who instigated the unrest must not be leniently tolerated, and the school with derelict school affairs must not be allowed to be tolerated. The Shanghai Private Anhui High School has not been filed with the Ministry. If the management situation is like this, the principal should bear the responsibility. The bureau should investigate the situation of the school. If it is simple, corrupt, and difficult to rectify, it should be ordered to close down to avoid misleading the youth and emphasizing education. The handling situation should be reported."</p>

<p>More than 30 pirates disguised as steerage passengers</p>
<p>Forcing the ship to Red Sea Bay as it approached Fuzhou Port</p>
<p>Holding the radio operator's room at gunpoint</p>
<p>Robbing goods and kidnapping passengers and four crew members</p>
<p>There are the most pirates along the Nanyang route, and cases of robbing merchant ships often occur. The Nanhua steamers of British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson in Shanghai have already implemented the addition of armed guards stationed on the ships for protection. The China Merchants Bureau is also planning to increase the number of guards stationed on Nanyang steamers, but it has not yet been implemented. The Xinming steamer was robbed again in the Min Sea, goods were robbed, and passengers were kidnapped, resulting in huge losses. The details of the incident are reported as follows:</p>
<p>The reason for the robbery: The Xinming steamer of the China Merchants Bureau was originally a North China special run, but this time, due to the freezing of North China, it was reassigned to the Fuzhou run. The ship departed from Shanghai on the 9th with many passengers and goods. When the ship departed from Shanghai, more than 30 pirates disguised as steerage passengers boarded the ship to Fujian. Although they were inspected at the time, no weapons were found. There was no movement when the ship left Wusong. On the afternoon of the 10th, the Xinming steamer had arrived at the outer port of Fuzhou. The captain was about to sail into the port of Min when, unexpectedly, these more than 30 pirates disguised as passengers swarmed out of the lower deck, each holding pistols and boxes, and wearing identifying marks on their bodies. The bandits divided into several groups, one group rushing to the captain's room, the radio room, and the driver's room, and the other group guarding all the crew members. Then they proceeded to rob.</p>
<p>Forcing the ship to Red Sea Bay: The bandits detained all the crew members in one place and ordered the helmsman not to enter Fuzhou Port but to sail to Red Sea Bay. Red Sea Bay is the junction of Shantou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, and pirates had already sent pirate ships to wait there. At this time, the entire ship was controlled by bandits, and the driver dared not resist, so he had to sail to Red Sea Bay. There was a radio on board, and the radio operator tried to send a distress signal during the robbery but was beaten and stopped by the bandits. Therefore, the robbery went smoothly all the way, and there were several warships nearby, but the crew members could not ask for help.</p>
<p>Searching and robbing goods: The search and robbery began in the middle of the night on the 10th, first robbing the money on the ship, and then searching the passengers' belongings. When they arrived at Red Sea Bay, it was already the morning of the 11th. After the money and goods were robbed, the cargo holds were also opened. The valuable goods loaded on the ship, such as textiles, wool, cotton yarn, and imported miscellaneous goods, were all robbed from the upper decks and placed on the deck. When the ship arrived at its destination in Red Sea Bay, the pirate ships were already waiting there. The bandits placed the robbed items one by one on the lifeboats of the Xinming steamer, put them into the sea, and transferred them to the pirate ships. The bandits also went with them.</p>
<p>Passengers kidnapped: When the bandits left the ship, they still felt that the robbed money and goods were not enough, so they kidnapped passengers Chen and Zhong from the large dining room and two passengers from the officer's cabin together on a sampan and押into the pirate ship. The ship's inspector Jiang was also robbed along with them. It was said that each person had to pay 50,000 to 100,000 yuan to be redeemed. Wang Binghou, the director of the Fuzhou branch of the China Merchants Bureau, was also on board to Fuzhou. He temporarily pretended to be a low-level crew member and was spared from being kidnapped, which was also fortunate.</p>
<p>The captain wired the Shanghai Bureau: After the bandits left, the captain and others were released by the passengers and inspected the losses. They immediately sailed the ship to Xiamen and sent two telegrams to the Shanghai General Bureau, reporting that the Xinming steamer was robbed on the night of the 10th, sailed to Red Sea Bay, and then the bandits left the ship, robbing two passengers surnamed Chen and Zhong from the special-class room, as well as two officer's cabin passengers whose names are unknown, and an inspector from the business department. A lifeboat was also robbed. The rest of the crew members on the ship were all safe. Now the ship's food supply is cut off. They are going to Xiamen first and ask the General Bureau to telegraph the Xiamen branch to provide food. At a minimum, the ship needs enough coal and food to go to Fuzhou so that it can be replenished after arriving in Fujian.</p>
<p>The General Bureau's thorough investigation: Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Bureau received the second telegram, knowing that the Xinming had arrived in Xiamen, and the General Administration immediately telegraphed the Fuzhou and Xiamen branches to fully supply the Xinming with food and fuel. At the same time, the two branches and the captain of the Xinming were ordered to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and the amount of damage. A telegram was also sent to the Xiamen Navy, requesting them to send warships to pursue the pirates as soon as possible to maintain commercial navigation. After the local newspapers received this shocking report yesterday, many passengers went to the bureau to inquire. Although there was no detailed report on the amount of loss, it was at least between 200,000 and 300,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Eurasia Aviation, which was planned by the former Beijing government, was finally organized last year when seven ministers of the Ministry of Communications and Schmidt, the representative of the German Lufthansa, signed a contract. The Ministry of Communications also sent Shuang Qing and Mo Yong to Europe to inspect telecommunications and aviation administration and to discuss the Eurasia Aviation issue. They have now returned home via Siberia and arrived in Beijing on the 7th. They met with Minister Wang to report everything and came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday for a short rest. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met Mr. Mo at a certain place yesterday and talked in detail about Eurasia Aviation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Returning from inspection: I (Mo himself) was assigned to go to Europe with Mr. Shuang Qing to inspect telecommunications and aviation administration. I attended the International Radio Conference in Belgium at the end of September last year. In addition, I went abroad for eight months to discuss Eurasia Aviation. Excluding the two months for traveling, I spent four months inspecting telecommunications and aviation administration and attending the Radio Conference, and the rest of the time in Germany discussing Eurasia Aviation. This time, I returned home via Siberia and arrived in Beijing on the 7th. I came to Shanghai on the 9th for a short rest.</p>
<p>Situation in Europe: The economic situation in Europe has been quite alarming recently, especially with the most unemployment in Germany. Since Germany's defeat in the war, it has had to pay reparations of 250 million marks every year, which will increase every year until it is paid off in 1960. The German government has no definite income to offset this. Commerce is controlled by Jews. What the Germans rely on is only the development of machinery. The competition among countries is also very fierce, so factories with less capital have difficulty maintaining themselves. There are more than 3.5 million unemployed people. Next year, the railway income will be increased by 100 million by raising ticket prices, and the tax income will be 150 million. On average, people have to bear more than 20% of their income. The high cost of living can be imagined. This is my second trip to Europe, but I feel that the business of Europe has improved a lot compared to previous years. Even in Germany alone, the invention of machinery in aviation administration and telecommunications is amazing. We should catch up as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Eurasia Aviation: The original agreement for Eurasia Aviation stipulated three lines: one line going abroad from Xinjiang to Germany, one line going to Germany via Mongolia and Siberia, and one line going from Manzhouli. The Russian government has not yet fully agreed. However, this section of the route is handled by Germany. This is entirely a matter for the German Lufthansa and the Russian government, and our country does not need to interfere too much. There is a Soviet-German joint venture airline, Tai Luoluofu 脱航空 Company, between Moscow and Berlin. The Russian government has also established a national airline from Moscow to Irkutsk. If the Russian government cannot fully agree to the Sino-German Aviation Company's passage through Russia, then Sino-German mail transport between Manzhouli and Moscow may be handled by the Russian National Aviation Company, and the Moscow-Berlin section may be handled by the Soviet-German joint venture airline. Mr. Furansk, the manager of the Masha Company, plans to go to Russia in person to discuss this matter. If the negotiations go smoothly, it will only take three or four days to go from Beijing to Berlin.</p>
<p>Test flights are imminent: We have ordered four aircraft from Lufthansa in Germany. One aircraft can be shipped before February 10, and the remaining two aircraft can arrive within a month. We have also hired four pilots, one mechanic, eight technicians, and one person familiar with business, for a total of fourteen people, who will come to China in two batches. The first batch will arrive on February 1, and the second batch will arrive on March 1. All four aircraft have been carefully inspected and selected by Lufthansa and ordered from the German National Aviation Testing Institute, which has issued certificates. The pilots have also been selected and approved by the German Ministry of Transport, which has issued certificates. All four aircraft are land-based and can carry both passengers and cargo. Two aircraft are W33 models and two are Fr models. As soon as the aircraft arrive, test flights will be conducted in Manzhouli.</p>
<p>Calling a board meeting: Minister Wang believes that Eurasia Aviation needs to be opened urgently, and the Sino-German Aviation Corporation should be organized and established as soon as possible. It has been decided to convene a board meeting of the Chinese Aviation Corporation within this week and to urgently telegraph Schmidt, the representative of the German Lufthansa, who is staying in Beijing, to attend the meeting. It is said that the Chinese side of the board will be Wei Yiduan, Liu Shufan, Shuang Qing, Cong, etc., for a total of six people. On the German side, there will be a senior executive of the German Post Boat Company, Boer  Chen, Ban Gaofu, the most 洋行 businessman at the time, and Feng Xike, the senior executive of the Siemens 洋行. It is said that the board will discuss taking the Sino-German route through Harbin and Shenyang and has invited representatives from the Northeast to attend the meeting and consider opinions. It is said that one seat on the board will be held by Minister Wang and Vice Minister Wei Yifu, and the vice-chairmen will be the German representative Schmidt and the representative from the Northeast.</p>
<p>Organizing the company: The company is divided into three groups: operations, aviation, and finance. The heads of the operations and finance groups are Chinese and have been internally designated as Shuang Qing and Lin Tianlan. The deputy head of the aviation group has been internally designated as Mo Yong. The list of German heads and deputy heads has not yet been released and will be decided at this board meeting. The company will be temporarily established in Shanghai and will be moved to Beijing in the future. It is said that for the safety of passengers, mail, and staff, the company has decided to propose insurance at the board meeting. It is said that the company's new aircraft are all made by the Junkers factory and cost 40,000 to 50,000 marks each (one mark is approximately equal to one yuan in Chinese currency) and are extremely comfortable.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Business Conference to be Held Tomorrow on Two Railways <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The venue is at the Jiande Savings Society</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, in order to develop business and facilitate passengers and merchants, have specially convened representatives from chambers of commerce and various industries along the two railways to hold a business conference. The preparatory procedures have now been completed, and the conference will be held from tomorrow. The news of the conference is recorded below.</p>
<p>The process of preparation: Since Liu Weizhi, the director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, concurrently took charge of the affairs of the two railways, he realized that the two railways connect to the major trunk lines of Jinpu and Longhai to the north, reach Shanghai, the only seaport for international trade, to the east, and adjoin the provinces of Min and Anhui to the southwest. Moreover, the areas they pass through are densely populated and rich in products. According to their geographical situation, if the freight business is reorganized, there will be extraordinary progress. He had the intention of convening a business conference, but due to the outbreak of military affairs, various industries were suspended, and the railways were also busy with military transportation, so he had no time for this, and the matter was put on hold. After the end of the military affairs last winter, merchants eagerly hoped for the improvement of transportation, and the railway bureau also urgently needed to reorganize railway affairs. Therefore, it was felt that the business conference was of great importance to both the railway bureau and the merchants and could not be convened sooner. Therefore, it was decided to convene this conference to discuss and obtain results, which could be used as a standard for the development of transportation on the railway or submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and implementation. After this matter was decided, the director sent Zheng Baozhao, the director of the car affairs department of the two railways, to organize a preparatory committee with the director of the general affairs department to prepare everything. It was stipulated that all matters such as proposals and the hiring of representatives should be handled by the car affairs department, and all matters such as reception and general affairs should be handled by the general affairs department. It is said that since Zheng Baozhao, the director of the car affairs department, took on this matter, in addition to supervising the section chiefs and section chiefs to prepare proposals for discussion at the conference, he also sent letters to hire representatives from various industries and transportation experts to attend. By the end of last year, all the procedures had been completed. It was originally scheduled to be held on the 5th of this month, but due to requests from representatives from various foreign ports for postponement, it was changed to tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's conference: The railway bureau estimates that the number of attendees at this conference will be more than 200. The railway bureau does not have a suitable venue inside, so it has specially borrowed the Jiande Savings Society on Fusheng Road. A special commissioner has been assigned to start arranging the venue, which is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM tomorrow.</p>
<p>Representatives who have registered: It is said that the railway bureau has hired about 50 representatives from various cities and counties outside Shanghai, about 80 representatives from various industries and institutions in Shanghai, and about 10 transportation experts, for a total of about 140 people. Yesterday, dozens of representatives from outside Shanghai had registered. It is expected that all the representatives who have been invited will be able to attend the meeting as scheduled tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hotel rentals: The railway bureau believes that the representatives from various foreign ports who are coming to Shanghai to attend the conference may not be familiar with the situation in Shanghai and will feel inconvenient in terms of accommodation. Therefore, it has specially rented the centrally located, air-clean, and hospitable Central Hotel for the representatives from various foreign ports to stay at will, in order to fulfill its reception duties.</p>
<p>Classification of proposals: According to Zheng Baozhao, the director of the car affairs department of the two railways, as of yesterday, a total of 183 proposals have been received. They have now been classified according to the nature of each proposal into three categories for discussion in three groups in the future, namely: (1) station affairs group, issues such as loading and unloading goods and requesting cars; (2) freight rate group, freight issues for various goods; (3) transportation group, vehicle distribution issues. Among the three categories, the station affairs group has the most proposals.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Dramatic Increase in Japanese Imports of Chinese Cotton Yarn <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Due to the sharp decline in silver prices, our country's exports of cotton yarn to Japan have recently been increasing daily. According to reliable sources, Japanese merchants have ordered more than 4,000 bales of cotton yarn from China this month. This cotton yarn will soon be shipped for export. If the current market price remains unchanged, Japanese cotton cloth merchants will order a large quantity of cotton yarn. In the first half of last year, the number of Chinese yarn exports to Japan averaged about 100 bales per day. By autumn, due to limited production by Japanese textile factories and a sudden increase in the demand for cotton cloth, Chinese yarn exports to Japan showed a lively atmosphere. Exports in September totaled more than 250 bales, increased to 800 bales in October, and decreased again to [blank] bales in November. In early December, Japanese yarn factories in the three eastern provinces [Manchuria] ordered a large quantity of Chinese yarn. In recent years, the Chinese and Japanese textile industries in the three eastern provinces have made great progress in actual production.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Chinese Refuse to Buy Japanese Fish <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Invites Fish Merchants to Advise</p>
<p>Claims Japanese Fishing Boats Are Not Fishing in Chinese Waters</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau to Make Concrete Representation</p>
<p>The Japanese Daily News reports that 32 Japanese fishing boats are fishing in the coastal waters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in our country. The fact that they are overstepping their authority and infringing upon our interests is obvious and has attracted the attention of all sectors of our country and government authorities. The fish merchants in the 16th Pier area of Nanshi in this port, driven by patriotism, unanimously refused to sell Japanese fish a few days ago. Japanese fish merchants were greatly alarmed because the fish caught by the 32 fishing boats that crossed the sea to fish are all sold in Shanghai, with monthly transactions exceeding 400,000 yuan. Moreover, due to the crowding of fishing boats in Dalian and other places in Japan, the price of fish has gradually fallen. If Shanghai refuses to sell Japanese fish, future development will be hopeless, and they will suffer an immediate blow. Therefore, three days ago, the Japanese Consul in Shanghai invited the managers of fish shops in the 16th Pier area to the consulate to advise them, saying that the 32 fishing boats were not fishing in the coastal waters of China, and that all the fish stalls that came to Shanghai to sell fish were caught in the ocean. He asked that they continue to sell fish as usual. The managers of the fish shops did not respond and left in silence. However, in fact, they still do not sell Japanese fish. The Social Affairs Bureau of this city believes that the Japanese fishing boats go to the sea to fish and sell fish in Shanghai, which competes with the market and is greatly detrimental to national sovereignty and the Chinese fish industry. It is said that there will be concrete representations, approximately: (1) convening a meeting of the Ice Fresh Fish Merchants Association of this port to discuss and resolutely refuse to sell Japanese fish; (2) the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines had previously formulated regulations stipulating that any domestic merchants who operate their own fishing boats to catch fish must first apply to the local government, report to the provincial government, and then report to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines for registration and licensing before they can implement their operations. Although the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines has now been merged into the Ministry of Industry, the effect of the laws and regulations still exists. The Japanese fishing boats fish in the coastal waters of our country without obtaining the permission of our government and without the approval of the Ministry's order, which violates the laws and regulations of our government and goes against international conventions. Therefore, this incident should be raised by our government in serious negotiations. In addition, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, and the Jiangsu Fisheries Experimentation Institute have jointly launched a fisheries improvement propaganda meeting to expand publicity on the improvement of the Chinese fish industry and the opposition to Japanese fishing boats fishing across the sea. It is expected to be held in the middle of next month.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Details of Commander Xiong's Resignation <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The resignation of Xiong Shihui as commander of the Fifth Division and garrison commander of Songhu has been reported in previous newspapers. Xiong has been stationed in Shanghai twice, for a total of three years. He seems to have made no notable achievements in protecting the local area, which is his duty. However, stationed in this place where Chinese and foreigners live in mixed residence and where the trails of bandits and communists can be found, and at a time when the country is facing many difficulties, the rear has remained safe during the three times the central government has used troops. Xiong has also put in a lot of effort. It is said that Xiong, with the end of military affairs and the completion of unification, is very willing to leave Songhu and unload this heavy responsibility. Before taking a plane to Jiangxi, he personally presented to Commander-in-Chief Chiang his resignation from all his posts, and guaranteed that Hu Zuyu would succeed him as division commander. The Commander-in-Chief, because the majority of the Fifth Division had been led by Deputy Division Commander Hu Zuyu to northern Jiangxi to suppress bandits, and Xiong had no time to take care of it, seemed to agree to Xiong's resignation as division commander. At that time, Chiang was going to Jiangxi and intended for Xiong to go with him to preside over the affairs of the headquarters. Unfortunately, Xiong fell and was injured, which greatly disappointed Chiang. During the New Year, Chiang came to Shanghai to see Xiong's illness, and Xiong again personally presented his resignation, which was comforted and retained. Xiong finally feared that it would hinder his duties, and sent another telegram to resign, and entrusted Secretary-General Shao to submit it on his behalf. Now, he is only allowed to resign from his position as division commander, which seems to be the predetermined arrangement. As for Xiong's appointment as Vice Minister of Military and Political Affairs, it is said that this was only discussed before Xiong went to Jiangxi. The telegram of Xiong's resignation and the Commander-in-Chief's reply are found below for supplementary publication: (1) Xiong's telegram: Nanjing Commander-in-Chief Chiang Junjian Jian, Confidential, I was injured in this plane crash and need time to recover. The positions I hold as commander of the Fifth Division and garrison commander of Songhu are all important. The vacant position has been suspended for a long time, and there are many fears of delaying matters. For this reason, I am sincerely requesting your seat to approve my resignation from all my posts, so that I can rest and recuperate. If my illness recovers soon, then my future body will be used to serve the country. I cannot express my exhaustion while lying in bed waiting for orders. Sincerely, Xiong Shihui Koutou, Yu Yin. (2) Chiang's telegram: Shanghai Commander Xiong Tianyi Brother Xun Jian, I have read your telegram, Songhu is a place where Chinese and foreigners live in mixed residence, and there are many communist spies. Relying on your vigilance and maintenance, I am deeply pleased. Now, although you are injured in a plane crash, you will soon recover. Hu Zuyu is approved to succeed as commander of the Fifth Division, so that he can be solely responsible for the task. As for the position of garrison commander of Songhu, I still request you to assume it, so that you can maintain stability and recuperate with peace of mind. In addition to another order, I will reply to you, Chiang Kai-shek Zheng Can Yin.</p>

<p>Hui firmly resigned, the headquarters has appointed the commander of the deputy division and commander of the 13th brigade, Hu Zuyu, to be promoted, which has been noted in yesterday's newspaper. Now it is known that Hu himself is still leading the team stationed in southern Jiangxi to suppress bandits. Because the Fifth Division headquarters is located in Shanghai, he will come to Shanghai to officially take office. According to news from the garrison headquarters yesterday, Mr. Hu has not sent a telegram recently, and the date of his taking office in Shanghai has not been scheduled.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Provisional Municipal Conference of the Municipal Government <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government held a provisional municipal conference on December 19th, 1930. The attendees were Yu Hongjun, Xu Pei Huang, Sun Baorong, Zhu Yan, Tang Naikang, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Yi, Yuan Liang, Hu Hongji, Huang Boqi, and Xi Dingmo. The observers were Qian Yongming and Xu Fu. The chairman was the Mayor and the secretary was (Yuan Shenglu). (A) Matters for Report. (1) Report of the Chairman. The construction of the central area of this city is the only large-scale project to implement the Great Shanghai Plan. Since the 123rd Municipal Conference on July 5th of last year and the 124th Municipal Conference on July 12th of the same month passed the decision, the Municipal Central District Construction Committee was established to actively plan and proceed within the time limit. Over the past year, the facilities that should have been in place within the time limit have already achieved considerable results. However, since this matter involves the construction of people's lives, and the stone is awaiting the lifting, it is difficult to expect it to be implemented soon without a complete and concrete plan and a determination of the steps to be taken. Therefore, the Municipal Conference was convened to discuss the points that should be discussed in the implementation plan of the Municipal Central District Plan prepared by Director Shen of the Public Works Bureau, and the two Chairmen Yu of the Construction Discussion Committee of this Government and the Chairman Xu of the Municipal Bank were invited to participate in the discussion to ensure that there is a unified implementation plan and to determine the steps to be taken in order to proceed quickly. (2) Director Shen of the Public Works Bureau represented the opinions of the members of the Municipal Central District Construction Committee (the detailed text is printed separately). (B) Matters for Discussion. (1) Discuss the points that should be discussed in the implementation plan of the Municipal Central District Plan. It was resolved that the original proposals 1 and 2 should be discussed together. The Secretary-General Yu, Director Shen, Director Pan, Director Huang, and Director Tang were designated to contact various financial enterprises to negotiate and determine a plan, and to request the National Government for record. Regarding the third item of the original proposal, it was resolved to continue issuing municipal public bonds to carry out the construction of the central area, and to establish an organization committee by Chairman Xu, Chairman Yu, Vice Chairman Qian, Director Tang, and Director Zhu to plan and proceed. Chairman Xu was to convene the meeting. Regarding the fifth item of the proposal, it was resolved that the municipal government's houses should still be built according to the original plan, and the remaining bureaus should temporarily adopt temporary buildings. The construction cost should be limited to 500,000 yuan, and July 7th, 1931 was set as the date for the groundbreaking ceremony for the municipal government's houses. Regarding items 6, 8, and 9, they were deleted, and the remaining items 4, 7, and 10 were all passed in accordance with the original proposal. The articles are listed below. 4. The land for the construction of the municipal government should be acquired in advance so that it can be leveled for construction, and tree planting and etiquette can be held there in 1931. 7. Regarding the opening of a new commercial port, please hire experts to prepare a detailed plan in advance and designate a large part of the second phase of municipal public bonds to be used for the initial construction of the port. 10. In order to develop the central area of the city, incentives should be adopted, and the relevant bureaus should prepare separate plans for further discussion.</p>

<p>Temporary Measures After Expiration of Old Agreement</p>
<p>The telephone agreement between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company in the concession expired on December 17th of last year. However, this type of agreement was made between the former Ministry of Communications and the old company. Now that the old company has been sold, its validity has naturally been lost long ago. Therefore, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has repeatedly submitted reports to the Ministry of Communications and specially consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the old company. However, the so-called old shareholders and old company have been dispersed since the sale. Although the new company once submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to sign a new agreement, the Ministry of Communications firmly refused on the grounds that the establishment of the new company involved infringing upon our sovereignty and naturally could not be regarded as a counterparty. Therefore, it has been delayed until now without any positive measures. It is now heard that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Municipal Public Utility Bureau have jointly discussed a temporary measure to negotiate with the telephone company in the concession, which is to temporarily operate the Chinese concession telephone service under the old agreement during this period. Once the conversion of the Chinese telephone system to automatic machines is completed, all telephones in the concession that are installed in the Chinese territory will be removed. This measure has now been submitted by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to the Ministry of Communications for approval.</p>

<p>To be Held in China This Year</p>
<p>Preparations for the Chinese Branch</p>
<p>The Pacific International Academic Society, originally named the Pacific International Relations Discussion Group, has already held two general meetings and will be held in China this year. The location of the fourth general meeting is generally in Peiping [Beijing]. The Chinese branch of the society is located in Shanghai and has already begun preparing for the meeting. Yu Ri was appointed as the Executive Director, Zhao Jinqing as the Deputy Executive Director, and Fang Jiaobo, Wang Yunwu, Zhu Jingnong, Liu Hongsheng, Yu Qingtang, Xu Xinliu, etc. as the Executive Committee members. Liu Dajun was appointed as the Research Director, and He Lian, Pan Guangdan, He Dequan, Zhou Shouyi, Tao Gong, Zhang Yunhai, etc. as the Research Committee members. Chen Liting was appointed as the Chief Secretary. The Pacific International Academic Society was first initiated by important leaders in the commercial and academic circles of Honolulu. The first general meeting was convened in Honolulu from July 1st to 15th, 1925. A total of 112 representatives from nine countries, including China, Japan, the United States, Korea, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and the Philippines, attended the meeting. The Chinese branch also gathered public organizations in Shanghai in February of the same year and elected more than 30 committee members to organize the Chinese Preparatory Committee. After the opening of the first general meeting, the Chinese branch was established. The second general meeting was held again in Honolulu from July 25th to 29th, 1927. That year happened to be the beginning of the Chinese political upheaval, and the issues discussed at the meeting mostly focused on Chinese politics. The United Kingdom also joined the meeting that year. The third general meeting was convened in Nishikyo, Japan from October 28th to November 9th, 1930. There was a lot of research on Chinese issues, and the Chinese representatives invited the fourth general meeting to be convened in China this year. The society was initiated by the people of the countries along the Pacific Ocean. Its purpose is to discuss the crux of international issues among the countries along the Pacific coast in the capacity of individual citizens. The society's organization is a committee system. Its highest organ is the General Committee of the Pacific International Academic Society, which is composed of one representative jointly recommended by the participating countries. The branches in each country are organized by the committees elected by each country. In addition to holding a general meeting every two years, the society also focuses on research and publication, and specially hires famous domestic experts to actively engage in it. The projects that are currently underway are: "The Current Situation of Our Country's Industry" by Nankai University in Tianjin, "The Utilization of Our Country's Fields and Acres" by Jinling University in Nanjing, "The Investment Situation in Our Country" by Liu Dajun, Director of the Statistics Department of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, "The International Relations of the Three Eastern Provinces" by Yenching University in Peiping and Nankai University in Tianjin jointly, "Our Country's Diplomatic Problems" by Bao Mingqian of Peiping University and Xia Jinlin of Guanghua University in Shanghai jointly. The above-mentioned research is always written into papers by those in charge for reference at the general meeting.

<p>Will Return to Xunyang After Resting in Shanghai for Two Weeks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reports that four Catholic priests and five nuns who were abducted in Ji'an, Jiangxi on October 4th of last year arrived in Shanghai on Sunday (11th) afternoon on the Nanjing steamer after being rescued from the Donggu bandit's lair by government troops two days before Christmas. It is said that the treatment in the bandit's den was quite good. These bandits and communists are under the command of Peng Dehuai and Zhu De. In the first month, the priests and nuns were assigned to care for the wounded in the Red Army Hospital on Qingyuan Mountain (transliteration). The hospital was in a pagoda with limited facilities and many wounded. In early November, they were transferred to the Red Cross team and set off with the bandit army. In the next five weeks, they trekked through the mountains, which was extremely difficult, especially for the women. On December 12th, the bandits abandoned them in a mountain cave near Donggu, and no one guarded them anymore. The weather was very cold at that time, and they only had withered grass to keep warm, and there was not much food left. The situation was conceivable. Finally, on December 23rd, they caught a glimpse of a team of soldiers on the horizon crossing the ridge. At that time, they knew that government troops were chasing the bandits, but they did not know what kind of troops were coming. They ventured to the nearby hilltop and waved a Red Cross flag to summon them. Soon, four people came forward, and after learning that they were the 18th Division of the Provincial Army, they were rescued. They then took a gunboat to Zhangshu Town, and then took a car to Nanchang, and then took a boat from Jiujiang to Shanghai. They have now been resting in Shanghai for two weeks and will return to Jiujiang to inspect the situation in the interior of Jiangxi Province, and then go to preach again.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Real Estate Association Letters Fei Xindun <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>1.  Water Supply Contract</p>
<p>2.  Concurrent Salaries of Employees</p>
<p>3.  Allowing Dog Racing Tracks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the Director General of the Shanghai Public Concession Board yesterday, stating, "Dear Mr. Fei Xindun, Sir, since you assumed the position of Chairman of the Shanghai Public Concession Board and now Director General, all your measures, whether meritorious or sinful, will be judged by the public. There is no need to repeat them. However, our association is driven by the concept of public interest in three major events in your political achievements, and it is like a bone stuck in the throat. It seems that it is necessary to urge you to pay attention. Please forgive us for being frank. (1) The contract signed with the British Shanghai Water Company did not pay enough attention to the interests of taxpayers, namely (A) the guaranteed interest rate is too high, (B) the right to issue bonus shares, (C) the company's property, namely the water supply equipment, is given to the shareholders, (D) in addition to the guaranteed interest rate, the shareholders can be given bonuses again, (E) the capital is calculated in gold. Therefore, taxpayers have not been able to enjoy the benefits of public monopoly undertakings today, but have suffered the damage of increased burdens. (2) Destroying the good habits of the Public Concession Board by appointing paid employees as representative directors of the British Shanghai Water Company, and it is said that this matter was requested by the company, which is even more suspicious. (3) Allowing the establishment of dog racing gambling tracks, which has caused great harm to the public. The Public Concession Board is now facing major difficulties in banning them. If it had been given careful consideration that day, and the interests of the public had been carefully weighed, there would have been no such mistakes. Although you, as the representative of the Public Concession Board, are not legally responsible for the above three major events, (1) and (3) have harmed the citizens and trapped the Public Concession Board. The second event has created suspicion of bias on the part of the Public Concession Board towards the water company, and the long-standing good habits have been destroyed. The responsible parties should express their responsibility. Because we love you deeply, we cannot help but speak frankly, and we especially want to advise you against acting rashly and violating public anger, which are the ancient precepts that politicians should take as a great warning. We respectfully wish you a happy new year. The Shanghai Real Estate Association, January 13th, 1931."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Foil Industry Association Appeals for Fellow Traders <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Please Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Telegraph Finance Ministry for Sympathy</p>
<p>The Foil Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Urgent, To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Sir, In order to relieve the suffering of merchants and the people, our government implemented the cessation of Likin [internal transit tax] from January 1st, 1931. Under orders, the sea was filled with joy. According to the original plan decided by the Five Provinces Likin Cessation Committee, tinfoil should be subject to a special consumption tax in the place of production. After one tax, it can be circulated freely throughout the country without being taxed again. However, according to a telegram report from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, the new regulations have not yet been announced, and tinfoil has stopped loading and shipping. The news came, and we were greatly shocked. This city's tinfoil shops handle a large amount of tinfoil, all of which depend on Shaoxing for supply. Transportation has been suspended for more than ten days. The existing stock is exhausted, and new goods have not arrived. Letters and telegrams have been sent to urge, but there is no solution. The market is tense, and people are panicked. Looking back at all industries, goods can continue to be loaded and shipped without being affected by the cessation of Likin. Only our foil industry is restricted, and the source is cut off. We are shocked and uncertain. If this continues, all the foil shops in the city will inevitably have no goods to sell and will close down one after another. We have always admired your association's leadership of the merchants and your responsibility to relieve the suffering of merchants and the people. We respectfully request that you report the situation to the Ministry of Finance and ask for sympathy for the merchants' difficulties, and lift the tinfoil ban, and allow the goods to circulate freely together with the goods of other industries, so as to stabilize business and reassure the people. We are waiting anxiously for orders. The Shanghai Municipal Foil Industry Association Preparatory Office bows, Yuan."</p>

<p>Social Bureau Bans Obscene Books</p>
<p>On December 9 of last year, the Municipal Social Bureau discovered that local newspapers were carrying advertisements for the book "Love Tide" published by the Xinzhi Bookstore. Fearing that it would be detrimental to public morals, it notified the newspapers to stop running the advertisements and instructed the bookstore to submit the book for inspection. Subsequently, the bookstore submitted the book to the bureau, which sent it to the relevant department for review. It has now been reported that the book is divided into three volumes, A, B, and C. Volumes A and C do not contain obscene content, but Volume B contains accounts of lewd activities, which are indeed detrimental to public morals and are in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the city's regulations on banning prohibited advertisements in newspapers. After review, there was no objection. The bureau ordered the bookstore to recall and destroy all copies of "Love Tide" B that had been sent out, and sent personnel to the bookstore to retrieve 13 copies of "Love Tide," which were destroyed in public. The bureau also sent letters to various newspapers to prevent the book from being sold through advertisements in local and out-of-town newspapers and harming young people.</p>
<p>University Student Ni Guangxun Still Missing</p>
<p>Ni's Wife Due to Give Birth Any Day</p>
<p>Ni Guangxun, a graduate of Chih Tze University, left his wife without saying goodbye in the autumn of last year. It has been four months since then. Details were previously reported in the newspaper. His wife, Fan, who was six months pregnant, gave birth to a son last month and now has two sons and two daughters. However, Ni's whereabouts are still unknown. Although his wife has asked people to search for him everywhere, there has been no news. Fan previously submitted a petition to the city's Women's Association, suspecting that Ni's sister was concealing information, requesting the association's assistance to avoid being unable to rely on living expenses in the future. The association sent letters to Ni's sister and brother-in-law, ordering them to come to the association for questioning. However, Ni's sister ignored them. Now that Fan has given birth, it is said that Ni's sister, due to the persuasion of many people, is willing to give Fan 1,000 yuan to sever the relationship with Ni. However, Fan is demanding 4,000 yuan, so the matter has not been resolved yet.</p>
<p>Xihufang Housing Association Opposes Rent Increase</p>
<p>The houses in Xihufang, Ximen Road, French Concession, belong to a Chinese man named Shen. They were built only three years ago. Now, because the landlord suddenly increased the rent, the tenants rose up in protest upon hearing the news. On the one hand, based on the order of the French Consul General to ban landlords from increasing rent, they sent a letter to the accountant of the building, Da Li, to persuade the landlord to automatically cancel the rent increase. On the other hand, they sent letters to the Chinese Taxpayers Association and other organizations, requesting assistance, which was very firm. It is said that they have organized an association to deal with this matter. All the tenants insisted that not only would they not recognize the rent increase, but also because the rent was already higher than that of neighboring areas, they would submit a petition for rent reduction.</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>It has already been determined that Shen Jiazhen and Pan Zhenya, tenants of the neighborhood, will be representatives to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Guangfuli Rent Increase Lawsuit</p>
<p>New Sassoon Increases Rent Again and Again</p>
<p>The tenants petitioned for exemption. The Guangfuli real estate on Guangdong Road is owned by New Sassoon, a British company. It was renovated and completed in 1925. The rent was already high. The monthly rent for a three-story house was 122 taels, 80 taels for a two-story house, and 40 taels for a one-story house. Unexpectedly, in August 1928, the foreign firm again notified the tenants to increase the rent: an additional 15 taels per month for a three-story house, 10 taels for a two-story house, and 5 taels for a one-story house. Otherwise, they would have to move out. At that time, all the tenants wanted to settle the matter and endured the pain of paying the increase, but unanimously declared to the owner that the rent would not be increased again within five years. Only two years later, on August 1 of last year, New Sassoon broke its promise and increased the rent again by 20% of the original amount: an additional 9 taels per month for a one-story house, 18 taels for a two-story house, and 27 taels for a three-story house. The tenants believed that the owner was greedy and increased the rent again and again, wanting to drive the tenants to their deaths.</p>
<p>It was difficult to bear the burden. The tenants jointly organized a tenants' association and elected representatives to negotiate with New Sassoon, asking them to consider the difficult business situation and cancel the rent increase, and continue to collect rent at the original amount. The foreign firm refused the request and stopped collecting rent. The tenants expected that they would use the excuse of unpaid rent to file a lawsuit. They deposited the rent due in the Zhongnan Bank every month. As expected, they were sued for unpaid rent in the Special District Local Court. Yesterday, the tenants hired Liang Bohua as their lawyer to appear in court to state the reasons for requesting exemption from the rent increase, asking the court to order the plaintiff to continue to collect rent at the original amount and bear the litigation costs. The plaintiff's lawyer claimed that the rent increase was due to the high land price. Judge Xu instructed that the verdict would be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Xue Family Property Dispute Settled</p>
<p>Xue Baorun, a wealthy paint merchant living in the Xiahui Road area of the French Concession, died of illness last year. Because Xue had an concubine outside and Xue Gu Qiaolin gave birth to a son named Baobao, he hired a lawyer last year to file a complaint in the French Concession Court against his legal mother, Sun, and brothers, Jiasheng, Gengsheng, and Yansheng, for seizing the property. At the end of last year, Judge Gong ordered a summons for questioning. However, because the defendant's lawyer's defense procedures were not yet complete, he requested an extension of one week for another summons. It is now known that this case has been mediated by friends of both parties, and a settlement was reached with more than 100,000 yuan as the settlement condition. Yesterday, the lawyers of both parties completed the notarization procedures, and the case is now concluded.</p>
<p>Doctor Yu Chang Sued for Abandonment by His Wife</p>
<p>Shen Zhi, attorney, said they do not know each other.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheng Zhu, represented by an attorney, filed a criminal lawsuit in the French Concession Court, claiming that she was previously married to Sheng Yuchang, but was now abandoned by her husband and requested compensation for alimony. Yesterday, a summons was issued, but neither plaintiff nor defendant appeared in court. The defendant's lawyer argued that his client, Sheng Yuchang, did not know the plaintiff and had never married her, so the accusation was very strange and requested that the case be dismissed. The judge ordered that both parties be summoned to court for further questioning.</p>
<p>Framing Someone by Planting Stolen Goods Backfires</p>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wang Honggui from Jiangbei has been unemployed for a long time and has been wandering in Shanghai, associating with bandits and developing bad habits. Recently, he has been intimidating and extorting honest people among his fellow villagers in the Yangshupu area. On the evening of the 20th of last month, because his neighbor Zhao Heizi refused to be extorted, Wang Honggui took a piece of worn clothing and placed it outside Zhao's door, trying to lure Zhao's 15-year-old son, Hongbao, to pick it up in order to carry out his cunning plan of framing Zhao Hongbao for stealing clothes. The Yangshupu Police Station sent detectives to investigate and found out the truth, releasing Zhao's son and arresting Wang. He was sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng interrogated him. Yesterday morning, he was sentenced to six months in prison. Harming others harms oneself. It can be said that he brought it upon himself.</p>

<p>Zhang Ajing Rescued After Jumping into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Zhang Ajing from Songjiang worked as a coppersmith in an electric tram company. Because he had no family in Shanghai, he stayed at his sister Gu Zhang's house at No. 9 Hede Road, North City. However, Zhang and Ajing had incompatible personalities and often quarreled. A conflict broke out again over a trivial matter a few days ago. Ajing was so resentful that he suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. He took a car to the Santai Wharf in the South City and jumped into the Huangpu River. With a loud splash, he sank to the bottom of the river. Fortunately, Ma Longyun, a watchman at the 17th post, heard the sound and immediately rushed to rescue him. After being rescued ashore, he was frozen due to the severe cold and became unconscious. After receiving medical treatment and resuscitation, he was taken to the First Precinct of the First District. The police chief sent the police to Zhang Gu's house to notify her to come to the station to claim him.</p>
<p>Wife Leaves and Never Returns</p>
<p>Husband Files for Divorce</p>
<p>Xu Jianting, a 51-year-old tea server at the Xujiahui Catholic Church, recently hired Xu Zuoliang as his lawyer to sue his wife, Xu Gu, in the Local Court for taking their two daughters and fleeing without a trace, requesting a divorce. This morning, Judge Ding Ruku opened the court for trial. The defendant's address was unknown, so a summons was not issued. Xu Jianting's attorney, Ren Enji, appeared in court. Xu Jianting testified that he had been married to the defendant for more than 20 years and had two daughters and one son. He worked at the Catholic Church and was unable to go home often. The defendant had been unfaithful in recent years and had improper behavior. In February 1928, she took the two daughters and fled with all their clothes and jewelry. He had searched everywhere without success and had requested the court to issue a public notice, but there was still no news. The defendant had been away from her husband for more than one or two years, which showed that the relationship between husband and wife had been broken. Moreover, the defendant often borrowed money from his friends and relatives, and creditors often came to him to demand repayment. He was really burdened and had to request a divorce. The judge then invited prosecutor Wu to the court to state his opinion, saying that the defendant Xu Gu had been away from her husband for more than two years, and there was no longer any affection between husband and wife. He asked the presiding judge to rule according to law. The lawyers for both parties stood up to debate each other. The judge then declared the debate in this case closed and adjourned for judgment.</p>
<p>Wall Collapses and Injures Pedestrian</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:20 p.m., the street-side wall of the stone-frame houses at Nos. 6 to 11 Tongde Lane, Bansongyuan Road, Nanshi, collapsed due to years of disrepair. Ren Wenhui, a Wuxi native living nearby in Peixin Lane, was passing by and had his right leg seriously injured. The Gaochangmiao Police Station of the Second District sent police to investigate.

The Wang District Chief of the Second District reported the case to the Inspectorate by telephone and ordered the landlord to be brought to the station for investigation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Bank Sues Liquidators</p>
<p>Arising from Failure to Distribute Funds Equally</p>
<p>After the Zuitian Restaurant went bankrupt, lawyers Wu Chengyu and accountant Huang Rixin were hired to jointly liquidate the assets. The creditors, upon hearing the news, all reported the debts owed by Zuitian to the liquidators. Wu and Huang acknowledged the debts and said that after Zuitian was sold and the proceeds were received, the funds would be distributed to the creditors proportionally. Later, Wu and others repeatedly invited the creditors to meetings. The Hongkou branch of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, as a creditor, was owed more than 5,739 yuan in overdrafts. The branch sent representatives to attend each meeting, and Wu and Huang did not object to this debt at first. However, after Zuitian's assets were sold and the proceeds were collected, only 30% of the small debts were paid in full. The branch inquired with the liquidators, who initially did not respond. Later, they claimed that the branch's debt was guaranteed by someone else and that the liquidators were not responsible for this debt. The branch did not agree and hired lawyer Qian Baohe to sue Wu Chengyu and Huang Rixin in the Special District Local Court, requesting that they be treated the same as other creditors and be repaid 30% of the debt, totaling 1,731 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 li. If there were no remaining funds in the liquidation to pay, the defendants should be held liable for compensation in accordance with Article 184 of the Civil Code, and the two defendants should submit the liquidation accounts in full for verification. If there were any remaining funds, they should be distributed proportionally according to the amount of debt to protect the rights. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong specially opened the Seventh Court for trial. The defendants did not appear, and each hired a lawyer to appear in court to defend them. First, the staff of the Hongkou branch of the Shanghai Bank presented account books to prove the amount of debt and the repeated attendance at meetings. Then, the lawyers of both parties debated one after another. Judge Xu adjourned the court for judgment on the 19th of this month.</p>

(1) Reports from Standing Committee members (a) Report from representatives to the petition to Suzhou regarding the process (with report). (b) Report from representatives to the petition to Zhejiang regarding the process (with report). (2) Proposals from the Standing Committee: The Shanghai Lawyers Association requested the association to appoint members to review the income and expenditure report for the second half of 1930. Resolved to appoint Commissioner Wang Hai to handle the matter. (3) The association previously received a letter from Commissioner Jin Zongcheng requesting an explanation regarding the distribution of company reserves. The matter was forwarded for explanation. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued Instruction No. 338 stating that the Executive Yuan had issued Instruction No. 2 regarding the use of company reserves. The association was ordered to take note of this. Resolved to copy and forward the information to member Jin Zongcheng for reference. (4) The association previously found that the Shanghai Trust Company's opening advertisement used the term "accounting services" under its business scope. The Accountants Act does not stipulate that trust companies can also perform accounting duties. A letter was sent to correct this. A letter was received from the company stating that it had been corrected in various newspapers. How should this matter be handled? Resolved to send another letter stating that the advertisement was a drafting error and that the error had been corrected in the newspapers. However, it was found that the company's glass windows and printed materials still contained the term "accounting services." Another letter should be sent requesting that it be corrected uniformly. (5) Commissioner Wang submitted the income and expenditure report for December for review. Resolved to approve and attach it to the Inspection Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Prevention and First Aid for Coal Gas Poisoning <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Notice from the Municipal Health Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau issued a notice saying: Citizens, this Bureau has heard that tragic incidents of death from coal gas poisoning frequently occur in this city. In the past, similar tragedies often occurred in places like Beijing. Later, with experience, people learned prevention and first aid methods, and this harm has been greatly reduced. This Bureau now specially explains it to everyone: (1) Causes of poisoning: Coal balls or coal blocks emit a gas called carbon monoxide when they are not burned to a very bright state. This gas is colorless and odorless, making it often difficult to detect. If inhaled in large quantities, breathing will become rapid, the face will turn red, and one will feel dizzy and confused, as if drunk. Severe poisoning can lead to death, and even mild cases can cause illness for several days. (2) Prevention methods: When burning coal or charcoal in a room, be sure to install a chimney or exhaust pipe. If there is no chimney or exhaust pipe, it must be burned in a well-ventilated area outside the house until it is very bright before moving it indoors. The same should be done when adding coal. Also, when coal is burning indoors, one or two of the windows along the ceiling must be opened to allow air circulation and exchange between the indoor and outdoor air. It is best not to burn coal at night while sleeping. If it is still burning, the doors and windows must not be tightly closed to prevent ventilation. In short, when burning anything in a room, be sure to allow the outdoor air to circulate and exchange fully with the indoor air. People in the room should also go outdoors often to relax. (3) First aid for poisoning: If someone unfortunately suffers from coal gas poisoning, quickly move them to a well-ventilated area, loosen their clothes, and perform artificial respiration. The method is as follows: Loosen the poisoned person's clothes, lay them flat, and raise their back with pillows or other objects to allow their lungs to expand. Stand behind their head, slowly lift the poisoned person's arms forward, extend them overhead, and then slowly lower them to the sides of the ribs, gently pressing down. Repeat this process until the poisoned person wakes up. After waking up, it is still necessary to seek medical treatment to recover to health, otherwise, hidden diseases may develop, so be careful. It is best to provide first aid while quickly seeking a Western doctor for examination. The above is very basic knowledge, but because some people do not understand it, tragic news of death from coal gas poisoning often occurs. This notice is intended to remind everyone to pay attention at all times and not be careless. This is a special notice.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Explosion at Dada Tobacco Factory Causes Disaster <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Many Workers Scalded</p>
<p>Due to Carelessness of the Watchman</p>
<p>At the Dada Tobacco Factory at 35B Tangshan Road yesterday afternoon, an explosion occurred in a steam boiler, injuring twelve male and female workers, who were all sent to the hospital for treatment. Among them, the female worker Wang Xia suffered burns to both eyes, and there is a risk of blindness. The other workers are not seriously injured. The cause of the accident and the injuries of the workers are recorded below.</p>
<p>Steam Boiler Explosion: The steam boiler that caused the explosion was used to heat and mix spices when making cigarettes. It was installed downstairs in a tin-covered room. Recently, the factory has been very busy manufacturing cigarettes for other companies. Because the contracting party sent their own workers to watch over the steam boiler, yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, the watchman left the room to talk to someone. It turned out that a long time passed, and he did not return, causing the heat inside the steam boiler to become excessive and unable to escape. It exploded upwards. By the time other workers noticed and came forward to help, it was already too late. The steam cover rose, broke through the floor boards, and affected the workers in the tin-covered room.</p>
<p>Worker Injuries: After the floor boards were broken through, three workers were injured and fell to the ground. However, the male and female workers working in the spice room downstairs were also largely affected because they could not escape. Most of them suffered from being hit by hot water or objects on their heads, faces, ears, and eyes. The workers in the tobacco silk room were also largely affected. In total, twelve male and female workers were injured, three of whom were on the upper floor, and the rest were working downstairs. After the accident, the factory reported it to the police, who used vehicles to send the workers to Renji Hospital and Guangren Hospital for treatment. One of the female workers, Wang Xia, 27 years old, suffered the most severe injuries to both eyes. Other male and female workers, such as Lu Jiebin, Shen Ayou, Shen Yinmei, and Zhou Weng, suffered injuries to their waists, legs, faces, and other parts, but were not seriously injured. Four people were in Tongren Hospital, and the rest were in Guangren Hospital.</p>

<p>Discovered After Arriving in France</p>
<p>Chen Yaotang's Crime is Unpardonable</p>
<p>Chen Yaotang, a Qingtian native residing at 4 Qingxuefang, Yimiaonei, claims to be in the remittance business, specializing in remitting money for fellow villagers going abroad, but secretly colludes with crew members of French postal ships to smuggle passengers (smuggling passengers means bribing crew members to hide fellow villagers in the cabin to go abroad). A month ago, eleven fellow villagers bribed a crew member of a certain French ship to hide in the cabin to go to France. Because the wharves in Shanghai were heavily guarded and there was no opportunity to take advantage of, he first sent the fellow villagers to Hong Kong to board the ship. Unexpectedly, after arriving in France, the French detectives discovered that the eleven Chinese had no passports and immediately detained them in the police station. They confessed that Chen Yaotang had contacted the crew members to arrange for them to be hidden in the cabin to go to France for half the fare. The French police went to arrest the crew members, but they had already fled. The French police then requested the Minister to France, Gao Lu, to send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Government, ordering the Municipal Public Security Bureau to quickly arrest and severely punish Chen Yaotang, who was smuggling passengers, to prevent ignorant and foolish people from being deceived and ending up stranded in a foreign country. It is reported that the Municipal Public Security Bureau, after receiving the order, has arrested Chen Yaotang and is dealing with him severely.</p>

<p>Four More Cases in the Past Two Days</p>
<p>In the past two days, four more ship accidents occurred in the Huangpu River. They are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tugboat Collides with and Damages Coal Ship: At around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a coal ship hired by Kai Ping &amp; Co., loaded with 50 tons of coal, was sailing north in the Yongjiang South section. When it reached Longmao Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, it was suddenly hit by the Taikoo Company's Zhuting tugboat, damaging two masts, the front and rear beams, and the deck, causing a loss of over 70 yuan.</p>
<p>Huge Wave Sinks Paper Boat: Xi Jinsheng, a runner for the Xiexiang Public Customs Brokerage Firm, ordered boatman Xi Kunquan to load 32 pieces of paper at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday and sail to the vicinity of Osaka Wharf in Pudong. At that time, a tugboat from Dala Company sped past, causing a huge wave that sank the paper boat. It soon floated to the surface, but the paper was ruined.</p>
<p>Large Ship Sinks Small Ship: The Nissin Company's Daikichi Maru ship arrived in Shanghai at 6:00 PM the night before last and reached Osaka Wharf in Pudong. When anchoring and turning around, it accidentally hit the Chengtong small ship moored at the wharf, causing the entire ship to take on water and sink to the bottom. Yesterday, the ship's captain, Zhou Chaosheng, reported the incident to the Water Police Station for record, so that he could claim compensation from the company of the ship that caused the accident.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Extension for Closure of Two Greyhound Racing Tracks <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Reply to the Municipal Council Still Pending</p>
<p>Representatives of the Shanghai Times newspaper visited Mr. McBain, the Chairman of the Ming Garden Greyhound Racing Track, and Mr. Evans, the secretary of the Shen Garden Greyhound Racing Association. Both stated that they had not yet drafted a reply to the Municipal Council's letter ordering them to stop holding greyhound racing events within the Public Concession by March 31st of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Ratepayers' Association Requests Immediate Closure of Greyhound Racing Tracks <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Regarding the ban on gambling within the Concession, this Association has sent repeated letters to your Board since 1928, requesting strict prohibition. In our letter of October 25th last year, we stated that the prohibition of gambling should begin with the closure of the greyhound racing tracks. We now see in the Western newspapers of the 10th of this month that your Board's ban on the large-scale greyhound gambling tracks will be delayed until March 31st of this year. Furthermore, the sites of these greyhound gambling tracks must contribute funds to relocate the tracks, and the employees of each track must be considered if they have difficulties. This is incomprehensible. It is evident that your Board is actively working to prohibit gambling and illegal entertainment venues that cause all kinds of evils, but a satisfactory solution has not been reached. However, it is not easy. However, your Board's current difficulties in closing the large-scale greyhound gambling tracks are self-inflicted. If your Board had not allowed the Greyhound Racing Association to establish large-scale greyhound gambling tracks in the first place, this kind of difficulty would never have occurred. Considering the current deterioration of Shanghai society and the implications in the declaration of a certain police chief in New York City, those responsible for allowing the establishment of large-scale greyhound gambling tracks should bear at least some moral responsibility. Furthermore, if the gambling tracks are deemed harmful to the public interest, they should be closed immediately. Otherwise, allowing the gradual theft of one chicken per day will become allowing the theft of one chicken per month. Contributing funds to relocate the sites and providing solutions to the difficulties of the track's employees is akin to rewarding organizations that engage in activities that harm the public interest, which is not something that municipal authorities should do. In the world, is there any municipal authority that knowingly allows those who harm the public interest to extend the period of harm? We hereby send this letter, hoping that you will take it into consideration. In terms of law and reason, the large gambling tracks should be closed immediately so that they no longer harm the public interest."</p>
<h3 id="e146">Municipal Public Works Bureau Urges Removal of Coal and Charcoal from Wharf <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Enforcement Will Be Carried Out After Deadline</p>
<p>There are Chai and charcoal shops such as Gonghe Xing, Hong Ji, and Qia Ji on the pier bank of Wharf Nos. 5, 6, and 7 of the South Shanghai Wharf in this city. Initially, they all subleased the gaps in the head from Dada Company to store firewood and charcoal. Due to overloading, the pier bank is gradually collapsing and the situation is very dangerous. In addition, the firewood and charcoal shops stack goods as high as the roof, which affects the appearance of the wharf and fire prevention. After the former port authority took over Dada Wharf, it ordered them to move. As the merchants expressed their difficulties, a special extension was granted until the end of 1930. Now that the wharf management matters have been transferred to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the merchants have reapplied for renewal of the lease. The Bureau has rejected the application and has set a deadline for all of them to move out. If they fail to do so, the Public Security Bureau will be notified to enforce the removal in order to ensure the safety of the embankment.</p>
