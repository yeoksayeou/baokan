<h3 id="c79">胡佛主張緩付戰債之研究彬 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>自從一九一八年歐洲大戰結束以後。戰債與賠欵。立即成爲全歐洲政治經濟上極形嚴重極易重起糾紛之重大問題。協約國爲求彌復大戰中所受之損失丶其惟一方法。自惟有取償於戰敗之德國。而德國戰時旣巳竭盡國力。戰後復須担負一千三百餘萬萬馬克之鉅大賠欵。勢固萬有所不能。故德國雖爲圖存國脈。於凡爾塞和會上忍痛承認一切條約。承認一切賠欵。願榨取舉國人民之血肉。以平復協約國之忿恨。換來奄奄一息之國脈。但國家經濟根本破産。國内實業陷於停頓。至血盡皮枯。督責雖急。而榨取無方。違背和約丶停付賠欵。自是必然。</p>
<p>然而停付賠欵。又决不爲事實所許。一則以協約各國亟欲彌復戰時之損失。再則各國戰時對美所欠之戰債。年須還本付息。不容遲緩。此種戰債之償還。自亦惟有取自德國之賠欵。賠欵無着。則戰債亦隨之無法償還。以故賠欵與戰債。在表面上雖無若何關係。尤以美國極力否認其聯銷關係。聲言不能同意把賠償問題與各政府閒的債務併爲一談。但就實際言。則無法否認其爲一循環債務。關聯至密。賠欵與戰債問題一日不得正式解决。歐洲經濟即一日無法復興。而國際閒風雲更一日不得平息。爲求度過此種難關。而一九二四年之道威斯計劃（Dawes　Plan)。以及一九二九年之楊格計劃(YoungPlan）。乃應運而産生。自道威斯計劃進而爲楊格計劃。協約國對德之榨壓。乃愈趨於科學化與合理化。數年來德國人民榨取血肉以付賠欵。美國安坐而收還戰債。雖勞逸各别。甘苦各異。但尚相安而無事。乃不幸邇年以來。世界經濟恐慌。漸達頂點。國際巿塲。日趨萎縮。物價低落。農産過剩。因以造成全世界之不景氣。德國受此影響。復呈窘狀。而前之所設科學化合理化之楊格計劃。至此乃又發生動摇。事實上賠欵問題與戰債問題。又將哄動歐洲之整個局面。而且德國經濟不得蘇息。亦直接影響歐洲各國經濟不得恢復。及全世界經濟普遍不振。問題之嚴重。吾人自可想見。究應如何設法補救。吾人亦正方拭目以待各國政治家之良圖。乃在此嚴重時機。一向對於與賠欵問題有相互關係之戰債問題。壁壘森嚴。表示不願提及之美政府。近日忽由總統胡佛宣佈緩付戰債一年。此種主張雖尚未經國會正式通過。但將來之能得正式通過。殆無可疑。胡氏之意。蓋欲假此一年之餘力。俾各國以休養生息。謀經濟之復興。及世界之繁榮。以挽救資本主義國家之厄運。同時爲謀人亦即所以自謀。美國雖豪富爲世界冠。但以國際巿塲萎縮。生産過剩。失業人數遞增。亦巳陷於窘境。謀世界經濟之復興。即無異於爲本國打破難關開闢生路。故此種主張。自能博得一般人異口同聲之好評。吾人爲欲明瞭戰債與賠欵之相互關係。並推測胡氏主張之將來結果。則對於賠欵與戰債問題。實有舊事重提。一度迥溯之必要。</p>
<p>○○○○</p>
<p>歐洲和議告竣。凡爾賽和約正式簽定。德國舉國人民。乃一時陷入無可躱避之惡運。依照凡爾賽和約之規定。德國對於協約國人民及其財産。因德國在陸上空中以及海上侵犯所受之一切損失。應負賠償責任。同時協約國共同組織之賠償委員會。復於一九二一年四月二十七日宣佈其應納賠欵總額爲一三二·○○○·○○○·○○○金馬克。最後併入比利時戰債。改定總額爲一三六·○○○·○○○·○○○·金馬克。繳付條件。爲德國每年須向協約國交付二·○○○·○○○·○○○金馬克。外加出口貿易所得百分之二十六。及一定數量之煤炭及其他原料。此種額數及條件。協約國於一九二一年五月一日以哀的美頓書威迫德國承認。左手要錢。右手要命。德國在威脅之下。自不得不唯命是聽。計自和約簽字之日起至一九二二年終。德國共繳賠欵八·○○○·○○○·○○○金馬克。但剜肉補瘡。勢何能久。德國以財力萬分枯竭。於一九二二年終。終於無力再付。翌年一月。法比聯軍。遂取斷然處置手段。進佔魯爾。德國亦消極抵抗。實行停付一切賠欵。相持六月。德國旣以經濟組織根本破壞。勢愈不支。法比兵力榨取。亦終無所得同時以國際情勢之變更對於賠欵問題之重新處置。乃爲各國同一之要求。於是有名之道威斯計劃乃應運産出。</p>
<p>道威斯委員會係於一九二三年由賠償委員會派定。其主要任務即爲重新估量德國之賠償能力。及繳付賠欵之方法。計劃擬定。於一九二四年四月提交賠償委員會。同年六月。經各協約國政府於倫敦集會正式採納。</p>
<p>道威斯計劃之特點。爲將賠欵問題提出政府漩渦。另放經濟組織之上。根據德國賠償能力。以决定每年應納賠欵之數目。不强迫德國應付若干。但問德國能付若干。而榨壓方法。亦以恢復德國經濟能力爲取得賠償之條件。不專事羅掘。置德國於水盡山窮。委員會估量德國之經濟能力力。决定德國應納賠欵之標準年額（Standard　Ammety)爲二·五○○·○○○·○○○金馬克。將德國歲計從新改組幾項歲收與德國中央銀行一併置於協約國監督之下。鐵路及其他大工業。都擔負繳納賠欵之責。每年德國籌得欵項。即繳付駐德賠欵總監。另由匯化委員會（TransferCommittee)轉匯各債權國丶</p>
<p>道威斯計劃之實行。顯然爲協約國榨壓德國方法之進步。一方面德國經濟確得昭蘇之機。他方面又能在國外借得較多之債。轉匯賠欵。不至感受困難。故由一九二四年九月一日起。至一九二九年三月止丶德國繳付賠欵約共爲六○○·○○○·○○○金馬克。初無遲誤。</p>
<p>然而道威斯計劃固亦不十分完善也。道威斯計劃之産生。賠欵問題雖能得局部之解决。但（一）該計劃雖曾規定德國應納賠欵之標準年額。但未規定應納之賠欵總額。標準年額究應繳納若干年。亦無明文規定。前途茫茫。德國賠欵將永無償清之日。德國自旦夕不安。（二）道威斯計劃實行。罄德國之財政金融鐵路工業。都受協約國嚴厲監視。不能自主。亦爲德人所極爲不滿。（三）德國一面竭力繳納賠欵。而萊茵河流域之駐軍。仍不撒退。此不僅令德國時感威脅更令其深感領土主權破碎之痛。而道威斯會議中。對於此種政治問題。亦絶未顧及。或且視爲勒索賠欵之唯一有効方法。缺點旣多。受害國家自亟謀修改。故修改賠欵計劃新專家委員會。於一九二九年二月十一日終於在巴黎正式集會。而有名之楊格計劃乃又應運産出。新專家委員會之性質。與道威斯委員會初無二樣。但其工作較之道威斯委員會則尤爲困難。蓋道威斯委員會工作僅限於規定德國應納賠欵之標準年額。而新委員會則須根據德國之賠償能力並顧及協約國經濟之需要。以决定德國應納賠欵之總額。顧及協約國經濟之需要一問題。即巳極端繁難。協約各國。因戰債關係。國情旣異。要求亦殊。稍不如意。即起爭論。故工作進行極艱委員會自二月二十一日開會。經過四個月之研究討論。乃能根據財政經濟實况。并考慮賠欵問題中之政治因素。擬定賠欵新計劃。即所謂楊格計劃。</p>
<p>楊格計劃所擬定之要點。即（一）組織國際銀行爲經理賠欵之機關。（二）規定賠欵之總額爲三八·○一七·○○○·○○○金馬克。分配賠欵年額（見附表（一）（二））並確定繳欵期間爲五十九年。（三）規定各債權國間分配賠欵之比率。（見附表（三））（四）規定賠欵年額之搆成。並廢除巳往一切財政上與工業上之擔保監督。（五）取消盛旺指數（Index　ofProseprizy）</p>
<p>楊格計劃較道威斯計劃不同之處。即（一）賠欵總額及繳欵期間之確定。（二）盛旺指數之取消。（三）德國財政獨立之取得。（四）賠欵之商化。（五）國際銀行之創設。此外道威斯計劃中於德國有利之點。如匯化條欵。如實業折抵賠欵辦法都繼續保留。總之楊格計劃爲彌補道威斯計劃之缺點。一面剥取德人之血肉。一面又不讓德國立即陷於無法應付。其榨取方法之科學化與合理化。殆亦費煞苦心。戰敗之國。遂如爼上肥肉。任人宰割。固屬可哀。而債權國之步步進逼。絲毫不肯放鬆。帝國主義之猙獰面目。至此亦巳暴露無餘遺矣。楊格計劃擬定之後。實行此計劃之海牙會議乃於同年八月召集。此次會議最關重要。蓋會中討論之問題。不僅限於經濟與財政兩問題。而且含有政治問題。經多次之爭執。與往覆之商討。除英國於賠欵項内每年補加三千六百萬金馬克外。全部楊格計劃。概接受實行。道威斯計劃之任務。遂於一九二九年八月三十日告終。而楊格計劃即自同年九月一日起開始實行。同時撤退萊茵河駐軍之政治問題。至此亦始得到正式之解决。</p>

<p>敎育丶是和日光與空氣一樣的東西丶無論誰都可以攝取丶不容任何人獨占的丶但是丶事實上丶敎育的恩惠丨否丶受敎育的自由權丶往往被一部分人所占有換些話說就是現世的敎育制度丶過于形式化丶忽視社會經濟的情况丶遂致自修獲得初中實力的人丶往往因無一形式文憑不能入高中研攻獲得高中實力的人往往因無高中畢業證書丶不能人大學反之富族子弟丶掛名大學丶混混數年丶即可獲得學士碩士的榮位丶我們置身敎育界的人丶仔細考察起來對於現在的形式化的敎育制度丶真正的不滿童丶</p>
<p>這種感想丶不柦我們會發生丶帝國主義的日本敎育學者丶也有同一的感想丶所以他們乘此次日本敎育部改革學制的際丶發了不少的言論丶建議於日本敎育部當局丶</p>
<p>據本月二十二日東京電通社電丶日本敎育部于三十一日午後開會討論丶參酌各方面的意見丶大英斷的將該國學制大改革丶其内容大綱是丶</p>
<p>一丶學校只分爲小學中學大學三階級丶</p>
<p>二丶許可自由入學丶</p>
<p>三丶爲不能入學校的人起見設夜間青年學校丶</p>
<p>四丶撤廢各學校入學資格丶施完成敎育丶</p>
<p>右列敎育案丶趕今年秋間作成細案丶提出該國文政審核會請其通過實施丶</p>
<p>我們知道「敎育」是先發生于富裕階級丶智識分子丶大多數时無生活的憂的丶所以討他們制定的世界各國的敎育制度丶十分形式化丶自然而然的使車富裕階級的子弟丶不易得沾敎育的恩惠丶但是現在的時代巳成民衆本位的社會丶爲竟實全民的實力計丶應該使全民有受敎育機會丶而形式化的體育制度丶應該首先改革丶帝國主義的日本丶貴族與平民的階級尚存在的日本丶事事崇拜西洋的日本丶尚知大英斷的舉行學制大革命丶（一）撤廢各學校入學資格丶許可有實力者即可自由入學（二）爲不能入學校的人計丶設夜間青年學校丶那末共和政體的中華民國萬民平等的中國民國丶事事革命化的中華民國所得的敎訓怎樣呢丶我以爲我國敎育當局當注意丶</p>
<p>一丶不宜完全模仿西洋的敎育制度丶</p>
<p>二丶撤廢各學校入學資格丶以實力爲本位丶許可自由投考相當學校入學丶</p>
<p>三丶各級學校加辦夜間班</p>

<p>謝使與達賴交厚惜未至而死</p>
<p>戰事起於細故民心歸附中央</p>
<p>前隨國府特派專員謝國樑氏出使西藏考察回國之缅甸興商華僑日報主筆譚雲山君丶自於本月二十日到滬後丶巳準備今日離滬晋京丶譚君以國府專使謝國樑氏在途逝世丶將代謝氏向國府報告一切丶譚君於離滬前丶曾與新聲社記者談西藏最近狀况及旅藏經過甚詳丶兹分誌其所談各節於后丶</p>

<p>譚君謂丶謝專使之奉命赴藏丶初僅偕其子同行丶至缅甸之眉苗時丶謝使因子患病丶死於眉苗丶感隻身之不便丶且年歲又高丶極思得一助手丶旋由北平法源壽法師介紹余（譚君自稱）與之前往丶於去年十一月初丶過喜馬拉雅山時丶謝即生病丶行二十餘日丶拉薩達賴喇嘛聞訊丶派人迎接丶於將抵拉薩之前一日丶謝氏即因病重而長逝丶接至拉薩後丶達賴與謝使舊交頗深丶故舉行喪禮頗隆重丶謝使逝世後丶遂由余負考察及宣達中央意旨之責丶余計在拉薩居住約三月丶因交通不便丶又被達賴所派護衛暗中監視丶故未他游丶至二月十五離拉薩丶三月十三丶回抵印度加里格達丶在印度計游兩月丶至五月十八丶回缅甸仰光丶六月一日離仰光丶十三日到香港丶十六日由港換輪來滬丶二十日抵埠丶現巳准於明二十五日晨或明晚乘京滬火車晋京丶向國府報告云丶</p>

<p>藏方本無政治之可言丶蓋藏人迷信喇嘛丶以致政敎不多丶政權盡操於喇嘛之手丶故名爲「僧侣政治丶」現掌其權者丶即爲駐前藏首府拉薩之達賴喇嘛丶其權利之範圍甚大丶並無法律之限制丶凡事隨其所欲丶達賴之下丶雖有藏王丶但爲一有名實之官職丶且爲達賴喇嘛之姪丶王之下有四「加龍」（即大臣之意）丶四加龍亦不分别職權丶僅爲執行達賴喇嘛之一切命令而巳丶民國十一年以前丶前藏爲達賴統治丶後藏爲駐日克則首府之班禪喇嘛所統治丶現班禪被逐出丶於是前後藏盡歸達賴一人管轄矣丶</p>

<p>軍事方面丶以前西藏本無正式訓練之軍隊丶不過近幾年來丶因受世界科學進化之影響丶始有正式軍隊之組織丶然亦爲數不多丶統計全藏正式軍隊丶不過六千餘人丶掌此兵權者丶按藏文名詞之意丶爲一總辦丶其下共有十三戴璋丶即十三營之意丶每一戴璋丶計軍隊約五百人丶此外尚有民軍及喇嘛軍丶可隨時調動或招集丶彷彿徵兵制度丶國家之預備兵與後備兵丶至其軍械之來源丶多由於英·印·日·俄·等處運入丶雖拉薩首府丶亦有機器局之設立丶然規模甚小丶每年可出來福槍二三十支丶其内部組織丶只一漢人爲工程師丶兼敎授藏人製造槍械等丶</p>

<p>交通方面丶因藏地多山丶故行旅非常不便丶鐵路之築造丶除英人在大吉嶺所設之印藏鐵路丶直達亞東者外丶餘亦無任何鐵路郵局電報局等丶除由拉薩至江孜者丶屬於西藏丶及由江孜至印度邊界者丶屬於英國外丶其餘各地丶並郵電等設備亦無之丶遇有公文等機關函件丶則仍倣傚古時驛站法傳遞丶現拉薩至江孜丶再至亞東丶亦有長途電話之設立丶其管轄權丶仍與郵電同丶</p>

<p>藏人除篤信喇嘛丶削髮爲僧丶及從事游孜外丶鮮有從事營商者丶故其商業勢力丶大部份仍屬川滇兩省人丶而該兩省之中丶尤以回敎人爲最多丶以業茶及綢緞爲主丶茶葉一業丶印度人雖亦間有經營者丶然茂人多不歡迎丶以其習慣喜嘗華茶也丶至英人在藏者丶經濟勢力毫無丶由印度輸入該地者丶以布疋傢具煤油及酒類爲多丶輸出者以羊毛牛皮麝香等丶中央方面丶在藏並無關稅征收機關之設施丶惟柏格里地方丶達賴設有抽稅機關祗抽出口稅丶不征進口貨稅丶</p>
<h3 id="c174">奇異風俗 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>藏人至今猶迷信頗深丶男人多喜充喇嘛丶其不削髮爲僧者丶多弟兄數人合娶一妻丶因之種族方面丶頗受影響丶喪事分天地水火四種辦法丶天葬最普通丶係將死尸以利刀解分之丶然後運至深山或野外丶供鳥獸之分食丶地葬極少丶遇有因瘟疫傳染病而死者丶方施行之丶水葬多行於貧窮無力之人丶火葬則專爲喇嘛用丶人民服裝丶有官職者丶多衣清時老舊之官服丶飲食一項丶日常多食粘粑丶混以酥油丶粘粑係以青稞磨粉而炒熟之丶調以酥油與茶混製之物丶名曰酥茶丶譚君謂此物風味頗佳丶余在藏時丶即以之代飯丶余且頗喜食之丶言時並出粘粑粉示記者</p>

<p>當余在拉薩時丶西康戰事巳發作丶其起因即如報上所載之細故丶此事如專視達賴一人之態度丶表面似乎尚好丶但其暗中據有獨轄全藏及西康之野心丶然察其一般人民心理丶則全部傾向於中央丶且極希望國府有相當辦法丶使與國内相聯絡丶至外傳内中有英人指使等情丶據余個人觀察丶恐未爲事實丶蓋英人在藏丶並無若何勢力丶達賴亦善於利用之丶現英軍之在西藏者丶僅亞東五十名丶江孜五十名丶且非純粹英軍丶多爲尼帕爾軍隊丶經濟勢力丶亦甚薄弱丶僅如以上所叙由印度輸入之商品而巳丶其每年貿易數目丶雖不確知丶然依一般情形看來丶爲數亦不大多云丶</p>

<p>豫鄂一帶。匪禍蔓延。烽烟過處。田疇爲墟。其刦奪之慘。視贛南無多讓焉。小民旣粒食無收。難以果腹。不得巳爲出省求乞計。襁褓筐承。盡村以行。頒白者負戴於道路。周游丐食。以延殘喘。是曰難民。鄉鎮之間。時有此類難民過境。雖省府文告皇皇。母許其入境。然難民之來。不絶猶是也。有司者遇難民來。亦祇得循例資遣。强壓過境。供給約每百人需二三十金。其數目由代表者向當局面議訂定。如論價然。事雖麻煩。然舍此亦另無善策以處置。某日。唯亭鎮上復有難民至。予以好奇心起。前往一睹其狀。爲數約七八十人。均河南祀縣籍。由崑山來。將西行者。駐於鎮之東。有鳩形鵠面者。亦有膚色豐腴者。其中貧富至不一。時方支蓆爲廬。拾磚作竈。作小住計。公安局購存之稻草。爲之要奪一空。無如何也。蓋供應稍不遂意。在在有意外之虞。中有三五人。穿嗶嘰袍。御上等呢帽。約指燦爛者爲隊中領袖。其服用頗奢。嗜烟酒。南棗之核。龍眼之　。狼藉滿地也。時方見其煑鱔。不去腸。整條油煎。熟後撕食之。則腸與骨俱去矣。反稱江南人食繕必先除腸爲多事。貧瘠者則菜色滿面。日望頒糧以果腹。其苦樂殊不匀。亦有出白布求巿者。布不類豫産。不能細究其來歷若何。好事者詢其家鄉情形。則云羣匪累刦無厭。剥削不得者。輒肆虐殺以洩憤。於是妻離子散者有之。横填溝壑者有之。其慘狀令人不忍卒聞焉。</p>

<p>六月十三日。滬巿敎局。假務本女中舉行巿立小學演說競賽會。由該局秘書岑有常主席。張仰高王晋琦協助辦理。男女來賓踴躍參加。衣香鬢影。花枝招展。盛極一時。撮記一二。以誌不忘。</p>
<p>穿紅著綠　演講員年皆十齡左右。所穿衣著。類多新製。衣料紅綠居多。良以兒童心理吻合原始民族。偏愛光帶二端諸色。鮮艶奪目。如赴喜宴然。男生有服西裝者。上自領帶。下至革履。十分考究。張君謂日本某大學學生。講義書本可不携。而照鏡擦鞋布等不可不備。吾國小學生西裝漂亮。可與日本大學生並駕齊驅。然日本大學生大而不學。吾國小學生則學而不大。</p>
<p>女子優勝　决賽結果。計取五名。此五名優勝者。女子占四。按諸過往歷史。亦均女生第一。女子語言學能力。似優於男子。美敎育家商代克Thorndike調查兩性心智異點。女勝男者爲删字試騐。拼字。國語。外國語。觀是女子語言能力。可見一斑。</p>
<p>評判三點　演說成績。較前益多進步。尚文西成等學生。亦甚得體。間有欠佳者。評判陸費伯鴻當塲指導一點。（一）演說係演說。不可如背書。此後記憶大意。不必拘拘於字句。則自流利。（二）態度多半不自然。有如演劇。有如口角。有如山東人賣拳。此後應動中靜。靜中動。力求活潑自然。自可操勝。（三）口音不正確者殊不少。「神」讀如「成」。「律」讀如「立」。「模」作「駡」。「孫」作「沈」。不一而足。隨時留意。當可改良。</p>

<p>— 高文棲</p>
<p>吾紹自莫潤薰長公安局以來。查禁烟賭娼。極爲認真。而對於破除迷信。尤雷厲風行。不遺餘力。近日更大捉黄老相公。（紹人最信奉之神名）及藉神歛錢之女巫。於是死菩薩活菩薩。盡遭逮捕。其事甚趣。誌之如后。</p>
<p>菩薩竟成階下囚　紹興黄老相公之祠宇。隨地皆有。而以青甸湖蔣家漊石堰頭等處。尤爲著名。每歲黄老誕辰。鄉人爲菩薩祝壽。演劇賽會。異常熱鬧。莫局長以此種迷信舉動。不特勞民傷財。且易滋事端。爲根本劇除計。特派警將青甸湖蔣家漊石堰頭三處之黄老相公偶像。拘拿來城。暫押城隍廟内。此尊嚴之菩薩。竟一變而爲階下囚矣。</p>
<p>原來是饕餮菩薩　昌安街婦人王氏。近忽自稱有神附體。能爲卜休咎。家中供一紅神位。上書「吳氏先繼母大人之位」荒謬怪誕。殊堪發嘘。其鄰婦宋氏。向之叩吉凶。王氏僞託神言。謂不出百日當死。倘能出米五斗。甲魚一個。桂圓蓮子各二斤。供神大嚼。當可禳解。宋氏信以爲真。即如數予之。事爲公安局所聞。即派警將該婦拘去。此饕餮菩薩食未到口。先嘗鐵窗風味。</p>
<p>菩薩也知收號金　東浦許某之妻。亦假稱有神附身。能治疾病。初時凡往求治者。祇須香燭一副。後以求者漸衆。乃謂菩薩現巳懸壺行醫。須酌收號金兩角。以示限制。繼又增至四角。近則竟增至一。元每日收入。雖名醫亦自歎弗如。人均以活菩薩相呼。且有送贈匾額者。而許妻猶貪婪無厭。復向人募化。爲神塑像。結果竟被騙得六七百元。村人蔡某。見而涎之。欲向許妻分肥。許妻不允。蔡遂報告警署。謂其藉神歛錢。於是此懸壺行醫之活菩薩。亦被捕入獄。聞將科以詐欺取財之罪云。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>十三日在大學講演。由敎長阿納查Amavanatha　Tha主席。學生質問。多有奇語。約經二小時。此處發見新材料。研究戰爭心理。據敎授某君云。家養之猴。一公猴十餘母猴。公猴性惡。有時將母猴殺死。此小歷史確足比天方夜譚之亞拉伯回王每夜進一妃。天明則殺之之故事。即此可證明戰爭罪惡。雄性爲根本。馬克司以唯物史爲根據者。殊未完全也。不能變雄性貧富平等。世界尚難太平也。此生物敎授告我之意。彼欲反對我學術云。即世界男女合作。亦難免鬥爭。然其舉例乃適證明雄性之惡。雖兩性有所不愛。與雌交後。乃殺之。與英女飛力布證明雄貓殺子之例。同一有力。均證明雄性生理爲戰爭根本。愈益堅固矣。按猴性在動物中爲馴良者。而雄性之惡如此。無怪在日本東京每晨閱報丶東京一帶。日日有殺妻案也。則雄性爲戰爭之本審矣。</p>
<p>十四在回敎理門Rehmen處開辯論會。十餘敎授博大律師等。均回人。辯論甚久。結果理門律師任組織委員。均承認余之主張而簽名。回敎有著作家母拉亞爾氏Misrza　Shuifaxze贈余其所著穆罕默英文傳。及穆氏敎言二本。彼甚盼中人能譯之。按中國回敎可蘭經。甚難覓。北京西門有回敎書店。亦無此經。其有英文者價三十元。太貴矣。今各處英文回敎書多撰於耶敎人之手。或難盡信。今觀母拉亞爾之穆氏傳述其妻凱地佳爲一寡婦。其招穆氏爲夫也。巳爲第三丈夫。穆氏悟道時。確經凱地佳承認乃發表共傳其敎。又凱氏年四十。穆二十五始結婚。經二十五年。凱六十五死去。穆年五十。始用兵力傳敎。可證明回敎之力。實得自女人。凱在世時。尚未用兵傳敎也。故回敎待女人尚不薄。不過其俗爲健門之俗耳。本意並非壓制女性者。又回在沙漠俗本多妻。據云凱氏死後。穆氏始娶多妻。但亦不過數妃。較之中國皇帝妃以千萬計者。亦不算多也。余所見各地回敎人。思想亦甚新。且運動力强。將來蔚然勃興。乃在意中。未可量也。回人執行之力。遠過印人。印人好談論空想。而懶於行。此其大短也。回敎人因知中國有回敎徒。對華人亦殊親善。</p>

<p>子良見伊在自巳濃睡的時候，要來妨礙他的睡眠，不免有些不快，即忙用自巳的右手，把月如一推，再把自巳的身體，做一個操場上「向左轉」的動作，便旋身向外牀，用手把被拉起一點，蒙了頭，打算重睡了，他曉得今天時候還早咧。</p>
<p>子良這麽一來，總算把夫人避開了，那知一忽兒夫人到他的脚的一頭去了。夫人把他脚上的被一揭，子良覺得脚上冷，便把腿一縮；不料右脚底裏又是一陣奇癢，他要想逃避時，脚巳經不能動，被夫人一手捉住了。</p>
<p>他這時候十分生氣，急忙把被一揭，自巳坐將起來：</p>
<p>「做什麽？」</p>
<p>子良怒目而視，向笑嘻嘻的夫人問着。其時夫人巳經放手，只見伊右手拿着一個刷牀的板刷，左手的手背，掩着嘴邊，笑個不住。板刷是方才刷脚底的。　　「今天是星期日，你還不放我多睡一下麽？」</p>
<p>月如不答，兀自對子良笑。</p>
<p>「我昨天晚上，過了十二點鐘才睡的，你不想想？還要來胡鬧！」</p>
<p>子良說時，把一隻還在身上的被角，也對裏牀一擲，怒容滿面，向着這坐在牀心的夫人，夫人笑得更厲害了；</p>
<p>「清早起來，就做出這副鬼臉來，被你嚇也嚇壞了，你快到水盂裏去照照你這副尊容！」</p>
<p>子良聽了，又好氣，又好笑。伊平日駡我小頭鬼，今天索性呌我到水盂裏去照面孔了。</p>
<p>「人家丈夫對老婆，何等的和顔悅色；只有你，一天到晚扮鬼臉！」</p>
<p>月如繼續說着。</p>
<p>「你不高興睡，你只管起來，下樓去！我要睡咧。」</p>
<p>「不行！夫妻是要生同衾，死同穴的，我巳起身，不和你同衾了，你也應當起來啊！」</p>
<p>「胡鬧！」</p>
<p>「胡桃？還有棗子咧！」</p>
<p>正誤　廿四日第七行「節頸」乃「頭頸」之誤。</p>

<h3 id="c286">美國公路上之設置 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 學遷</p>
<p>歐美諸邦。其汽車事業之進展。當然以美國爲首屈一指。即其公路上之設置。亦當然以美國爲最有秩序。蓋對於道路之闊度丶車輛之行列。標誌之作用。行人之方便諸犖犖大端丶莫不有一定之規則。而爲路容之整齊基礎也。兹分别述之如次。</p>
<p>公路闊度　美國公路。在近城巿及聯絡大城巿間之大路。另有規定。其普通道路。祗備來去兩行車輛行駛。其初車輛較小。速度不大。故調查其闊度。在一九一八年前所建築者。以一六英尺爲最多。亦有狹至一四英尺者。旣而汽車製造。日益增大。行車速度。亦日加快。於是在一九二○年以後所築公路。多以一八英尺爲標準。一九二八年以後。尤多定爲二畫英尺爲標準。此項標準。各省雖有不同。而所定闊度。一省之中。或亦不能一律。惟車輕最大闊度。大都限於八英尺。因之在曲線處。每多加寛丶且在公路與公路交加處。亦有規定。於一百英尺或二百英尺以内。加寛若干尺。以備車輛停候之用也</p>
<p>車輛行列　普通公路。其闊度在二○英尺或二○英尺以内。祇備兩行列丶在大城巿間之公路。則有三行列。以至六行列不等丶每一行列。在緊要地點或轉角處所。多在路上劃清黑色界綫一條。以示區分。亦所以使車輛易於認别。不至互撞矣</p>
<p>車務概况　美國公路。在東部諸省。車務最繁。其重要大道。每日汽車經過數目。常在一萬輛以外丶其最熱鬧與繁忙之通衢。每日竟達二萬五千輛之多。至在南部。情形更有不同。車務較稀之地。每日汽車經過數目。至多或達五千輛。至少則僅五百輛。細考其車輛種類。私人載客汽車。約居百分之九十。載貨與公共汽車丶衹居百分之十而弱。公共載客汽車。僅全數百分之一二。此種現象。實與歐洲大異。如英國重量載貨汽車。居車務中之重要位置。惟美國對於汽車之大小。其闊度限制爲八英呎。至其重量。至其重量。各省各有規定之標準。大抵限於每英寸橡皮輪闊度之載重。而對於全車之載重。無一定之限制。故重載汽車。有設置三軸。而每軸配置四個橡皮輪者。美國公路上行駛之汽車。其橡皮輪多屬空心丶實心橡皮輪甚少見用。所謂與歐洲大異者此也。此外鐵輪橡皮。尤少概見。其他慢行車輛。如人推車馬車等。多行於鄉村道路。大路上殊見絶少。豈人力與馬力。交通規律上或有所限制歟。</p>
<p>交加設置　所謂交加設置者。即公路與鐵路交加點之設置是也。在昔公路與鐵路。均在同一水平上交加。雖有栅欄之設置。然事變發生。不可勝數。現在交通較繁之公路。對於鐵路交加。多以路爲天橋或地道之設置。以爲適宜妥善。其費用大抵各半分担。即公路與公路交加之處。亦多使上下隔離。不惜巨大之設置費。以謀交通之安全。此爲美國近年來之極大進步。不過普通公路與鐵路平交者。仍屬大多數。將見有逐漸改良之希望矣。</p>
<p>標誌作用　美國公路所竪立之標誌。有兩種作用。一爲指示性質。一爲警告性質。屬於指示作用者。如國道號數。省道號數。離城里數。左右轉灣。及他路聯絡等。皆白地黑字之牌。屬於警告作用者。如鐵路交加。變曲。線斜。坡度。及經過學校等。則用黄地黑字之牌。至於遇有特殊事項。如路滑或有阻等。則尤多爲醒目之標誌。如滬上防止車輛之肇禍。行人之遇險。則有馬路如虎口。當中不可走。即其證例。但亦無一定之方式也。</p>
<p>行人方便　美國公路上。往往有油站之設置。以備供給燃油滑油及壓氣。公家則沿途於相當地點。設備電話。俾行人得以隨時隨地。可以與友朋戚族通話丶查比利時國最爲完善。每隔一公里。即有一公共電話。且每二百公尺。即豎一桿。標明距電話有若干公尺。但美國地大路多。恐不易如此辦理也。又有便所之設置。亦所以利便行旅。至於人民方面。則有住宅於公路之旁。每歡迎遊客蒞止。故於宅前亦竪立標誌。倘因誤時而欲中途進膳住宿或洗浴者。莫不感其便利。且有又於宅旁建築小木屋多椽。高懸榻位。每偶宿止。取費美金一元。頗有賓至如歸之象。是亦其國民性富於情感之表現也。</p>
<h3 id="c287">法國汽車大增 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 沛甘</p>
<p>近有特來克氏於紐約泰晤士報中著一文。略謂法蘭西於一九三零年中。汽車之銷數。執全世界各國之牛耳。即美國亦不能與之並論。此種發達現象。實爲汽車界中未之前見者云丶又據「美國汽車」雜誌載稱。去年法國之額外汽車註册。增加一七八·○○○輛。美合衆國則祇一二六·○九四輛而巳。若以百分率之增加而言。則上進又屬可觀。法蘭西之增加率爲百分之十三·五。美國爲○·五。</p>
<p>一九三零年底法美英等十二國之新車註册數。列表如次。</p>
<p>法蘭西　　　一七八·○○○輛</p>
<p>美合衆國　　一二六·一○○輛</p>
<p>大不列顛　　　八三·七○○輛</p>
<p>德國　　　　　四九·七○○輛</p>
<p>加拿大　　　　四五·六○○輛</p>
<p>意大利　　　　二八·○○○輛</p>
<p>阿根廷　　　　二一·七○○輛</p>
<p>比利時　　　　一七·七○○輛</p>
<p>荷蘭　　　　　一七·○○○輛</p>
<p>新西蘭　　　　一六·○○○輛</p>
<p>南非洲　　　　一四·六○○輛</p>
<p>瑞士　　　　　一四·三○○輛</p>
<p>法蘭西所感受之經濟困難·實較别國爲淺·故於一九三零年中·尚能出其餘緒。努力於汽車事業之進展。凡其成就。祗能於十分富裕開化之邦求之者也。馬匹脚踏車及牛車等。現仍通行於法蘭西之城巿及鄉間。且其所佔之位置。亦殊重要。但此所謂汽油推進之「人類之友」。到處能見其勢力之澎漲也。</p>
<p>目下法人中每二十八人得佔汽車一輛。實爲歐洲特殊之紀錄。但與美國之每四·六人得汽車一輛者。尚覺瞠乎其後。坎拿大及新西蘭以人口與汽車相比。一爲七·五人。一則爲十人。</p>
<p>法蘭西之現在情形。與一九一七年時之美國情况相同。其時美國每二十八人方得汽車一輛也。或有人曰。再隔十四年後。法蘭西人能每人得一汽車否。答者曰此則尚需較長之時間也。</p>
<p>法蘭西人三之二係農夫。耕種爲業。守舊成性。凡汽車運貨車及曳車等之利益。渠等借重尚須待之他日。故今日之汽車銷售商。多于大城巿中尋其主顧也丶巴黎城中所有之汽車。共佔全法國汽車七分之一。分計之每十九人即得汽車一輛也。</p>
<p>以全數之汽車而論。法國所有之汽車較次於英國。但以今年而論。則法蘭西之汽車將居於美國之次矣。一九零年法國所有之汽車增加數。較英多九五·○○○輛。等於一九三一年能增五八·○○○輛者。則又能壓倒其次矣。今以五國汽車銷數最巨者列次。</p>
<p>一九三零年一月</p>
<p>美合衆國二六·六九一·○○○</p>
<p>大不列顛　一·五五八·○○○輛</p>
<p>法蘭西　　一·五○○·○○○輛</p>
<p>坎拿大　　一·二一五·○○○輛</p>
<p>德意志　　　　六五九·○○○輛</p>
<p>一九三零年四月間法蘭西國會所通之稅則。對於汽車微稅增加甚多。故於美國之海外貿易亦受稅則之影響甚鉅。此點可於正月二之進出口報告覘之。一年之前法蘭西境内之出産約少去百分之二十。客車出口正二兩月跌去百分之十二又半。進口之數則爲六九·二</p>
<p>美國進口商。現仍繼續在巴黎城中。費去巨量之金錢。陳列車樣以供衆覽。此係一種純粹之廣告性質。福特汽車仍在境内裝配成車。其所用之法國原料亦日就增加。據去年常年報告中稱。福特車因新稅率而增加之成本祇漲百分之四而巳。零售之價絲毫不加。</p>
<p>美國國民汽車商會歐洲代表約翰老倫士。方自波羅的海岸諸國。作六星期之旅行返歸巴黎總部。其所考察者爲德意志·波蘭·愛斯篤尼亞·臘脫維亞·立陶宛諸國。老氏報告各處均有起色。與其出發時各人之觀察預料。截然不同。並云「德之製造汽車用件者。巳增多其工作之計劃於夏季。一反從前低削之策。各處需要日有起色」云云。</p>

<p>— 范</p>
<p>浙省自設立公路局以來丶對於築路通車之規劃。進行不遺餘力。早爲全國各省之冠。兹將巳通車之各路近况丶略述於後。</p>
<p>蕭紹段　蕭紹段爲省道之濫觴。係盧子嘉督浙時化兵爲工所築丶通車以來丶業逾五載。該段爲杭紹線之東段。路綫起自西興江邊。迄於紹興之五雲門。蕭紹兩縣丶物産富庶。人口繁多。地方生活較爲充裕。經最近二年之整頓。營業逐漸增加。現每日營業平均約一千三百餘元。各路段中之營業。以此段爲冠。</p>
<p>拱三段　拱三段爲杭紹之南段。銜接蕭紹段者·爲浙東浙西之中樞。錢塘江運河之咽喉也。起自江干之三郎廟。迄於拱宸橋。於十七年八月通車。通車後旅客稱便。營業即甚發達。乃因十八年夏。西湖博覽會期内。持有游券者。即可免費乘坐。故全段營業。完全犧牲。資五月之久。車輛及營業損失十萬餘元。嗣後逐漸整理。始復舊觀。近則更爲發展。每日營業平均約六百元。惟該段所經地點。均係杭巿中樞。精華所萃。故短途乘客頗多。惟分站過少。民衆頗感不便。如能多設分站。非但營業可以發達。於民衆必更爲便利也。現以巿區遼闊。民衆之需要。當不僅此一綫。擬添闢路綫。加增車輛。杭巿工商事業。均可獲益不少。尚有支綫六湖一段。係自湖濱達六和塔者專供游人乘坐丶春秋兩季。較爲發達。此外有電影專車。爲便利電廠用户。觀覽電影而設。</p>
<p>杭長路　杭長路爲京杭國道。浙省之一段。自杭巿達本省邊境之長興縣境。祇以江蘇部分。路面尚未建築完竣。不能直達首都。營業尚未完全發達。且因通車未久。民衆於乘坐輪船。汽車尚未習慣。且中間尚有一段商辦公司所專利。營業方面。亦頗受影響。現每日平均收入約六百餘元。再該路杭莫一段。係直達莫干山者。專爲夏季中外人士往來而設。爲便利旅客起見特與滬杭甬鐵路計有聯運辦法。舉辦尚見成效。要之京杭通車如能早日實現。則營業之發達。正未可限量也。</p>
<p>鄞奉段　鄞奉段起自寗波巿。迄於奉化。爲浙東交通之重要路綫。本段所經地點。生産豐富。除載客以外。兼辦貨運。以爲工商發達之助。自十八年五月通車以來。逐漸發展。現在每日收入平均約五百餘元。全線之中。尚有支線數條未築。如能一一完成。則交通旣更便利。營業自益興盛也。</p>
<p>杭平路　杭平公路。於十九年四月通車。現巳直達乍浦。尚有乍平一段。正在趕築。不久亦可通車。該路路綫。多循海塘而行。且係土路。一遇天雨。不得不停車。以致營業頗難發展。每日收入平均僅幸二百餘元。現在對於該路。正在設法改善之中。如全綫路面能早日完成。則營業不難發達也。</p>
<p>杭昌路　杭昌路爲浙皖要道。交通極爲重要。惟自杭州至餘杭。餘杭至臨交兩段。巳由商辦杭餘餘臨兩公司承築。路局所築。僅自化龍至昌化爲止。便利行旅起見。十九年九月自化龍至藻溪。先行通車復有十月一日。自藻谿起至於潛續行通。車。於昌一段。約月内可以通車。現以路綫所經。均爲僻邑。行旅不多。每日收入平均五十餘元。將來浙皖全線。一經通車。則往來兩省者。不必繞道。營業前途。自可蒸蒸日上也。</p>

<h3 id="e44">France Has Not Yet Replied on the Deferred Payment Issue <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The reason why the American plan for deferring debt payments is not yet optimistic is that France's reply has not yet been decided. France's hesitation on the deferred payment plan is due to the fact that, on the one hand, the budget deficit caused by the deferral must be made up for, and the reason for domestic opposition is also this. On the other hand, there is a desire to maintain the Young Plan, fearing that the unconditional deferral of compensation will affect the Young Plan, so it is still hesitating and cautious. Both of these are indeed very important to France and have their own difficulties. Therefore, it would not be the most appropriate method to pressure France diplomatically and economically, as suggested by the Washington telegram, to force them to comply. This could even lead to disputes. However, this matter is related to the overall global situation, and France will certainly try its best to contribute to this beautiful effort to maintain the world economy. The key still lies in the problem between Germany and France. The German Prime Minister sent a radio message to France yesterday, asking to frankly exchange opinions on the German-French problem, saying that Germany is prepared to cooperate to achieve President Hoover's goal. This is indeed the most essential method. If the two countries can frankly exchange opinions and seek cooperation, the solution will be easier than other methods. However, France is concerned about affecting the Young Plan, and Germany has long expressed its desire to revise the Young Plan as a question that will inevitably be raised in the future. If the deferred payment issue is discussed together, the opinions will be even more difficult to approach. Therefore, in order to fulfill the US President's proposal, it is only necessary to declare that this measure is an exception, unrelated to the Young Plan, and that whether the Young Plan should be revised will be discussed in the future. Then the deferred payment problem today will be easily resolved. Whether the key to this matter lies here can be understood by observing the French government's reply tomorrow.</p>

<p>President Hoover has been inquiring about the opinions of all elected members of the 72nd New Congress regarding the suspension of war debts, either through face-to-face talks, letters, or telegrams. As a result, no one has expressed opposition so far. Even the opposition party's Senators Harrison and Costigan have replied that they support it. Currently, there is some disappointment here with France's attitude. It is expected that after being subjected to diplomatic and economic pressure, it will not be difficult for them to change their mind and comply. There were meetings in the White House, the State Department, and the Treasury Department today. The stock market's rising trend has slowed down slightly.</p>

<p>France's reply to President Hoover regarding the suspension of war debts is currently being drafted.

According to reliable sources, the French government's reply will take the form of an answer, aiming to protect the Young Plan from being affected.</p>

<p>The French government's reply to President Hoover will not take final form until after today's cabinet meeting. However, French Prime Minister Laval briefed the US Ambassador to France on the gist of the French reply last night. Diplomatic circles believe that the French reply will insist on continuing to pay the unconditional compensation under the Young Plan annually. However, France is prepared to send this money to the Bank for International Settlements, which will lend it to the countries in Central Europe most affected by the economy. France is also prepared to make up for the resulting shortfall in the French budget. The French government will inevitably postpone its domestic reconstruction plans.</p>

<p>Since the Hoover Plan occurred, French Foreign Minister Briand's power has become increasingly weak. The whole country believes that the Foreign Minister knew nothing about it beforehand. After the matter occurred, he was panicked and at a loss. An immeasurable number of questions have been raised in the parliament, and it is expected that there will soon be a fierce debate. Furthermore, given the current attitude of the parliamentarians, the government's future is extremely dangerous. As for Briand himself, he still does not consider this a failure and is making every effort to advocate that France should consider the common interests of France and the whole of Europe and unconditionally recognize the entire Hoover Plan as soon as possible. The rest of the cabinet members still insist that there should be considerable reservations.</p>

<p>The US government has not yet received official news of France's proposed response. However, Secretary of State Stimson has stated that the method of suspension is not a matter of quibbling and should be passed urgently. If the French response greatly alters the President's original proposal, Washington will definitely not welcome it. Treasury and Federal Reserve officials held several meetings today, leading to speculation that the US may provide loans to the German National Bank. At the request of the US Undersecretary of the Treasury, the French embassy's financial attaché has telegraphed Paris to collect information on various payments under the Young Plan. At the same time, officials firmly stated that they will not use diplomatic pressure to force France to accept the suspension plan.</p>

<p>A report has just come from Washington stating that according to the US interpretation, President Hoover's so-called suspension of debt includes Germany's unconditional annuities. Therefore, the domestic French public opinion that previously claimed to have obtained information from official sources that the unconditional annuities in reparations are a separate issue has now been refuted by Washington's clear explanation. At the moment, the German government is receiving petitions from all over the country, requesting that the savings from the suspension of reparations be used to reduce the burden of taxes, which are arriving like snowflakes. However, the cabinet unanimously stated that the money saved after the implementation of the Hoover Plan should be used to build and consolidate national finances. This opinion has now been broadcast to the country by Premier Brüning via radio. Brüning also stated that Germany's rulers are willing to work hard with the people of the country to live up to the expectations in President Hoover's ideals. However, the success of this matter largely depends on the cooperation between Germany and France. If there are differences of opinion between the two countries, then the politicians of the two countries should be responsible for mediating them. Brüning also said that he is eager to have a friendly and sincere conversation with French politicians, like the conversation with Guttchiers, so that various misunderstandings and issues that easily cause misunderstandings between the two countries can be resolved at the negotiating table.</p>

If unconditional reparations are also included, it would be a major issue for France.

Foreign Minister Shidehara replied that if the countries related to the Hague Eastern Reparations Agreement request Japan to express its attitude, it will naturally determine its final attitude. Although it has not actively expressed its will at this time, it deeply understands France's position. The Italian Ambassador also visited Vice Minister Nagai one after another today to inquire about the Japanese government's opinion.

<p>Because Austria wants to obtain French economic assistance, France has sought to impose various harsh conditions and demand Austria's acknowledgement. At the moment, the outline of this matter has been announced in full by Social Democratic Party leader Bauer at the party's meeting today. Bauer said that on the day former Prime Minister Ender resigned, France sent an official letter demanding that Austria abandon the customs treaty concluded with Germany. Austria must request the League of Nations to send someone to investigate Austria's current economic situation, and must declare in advance that Austria must acknowledge whatever recommendations the League of Nations has. In the future, all treaties concluded by Austria with other countries that affect the current state of European politics or economy must be notified to France in advance and obtain its permission. Bauer said that if these conditions are acknowledged one by one, Austria will become a vassal of France. Fortunately, the Bank of England provided timely relief by paying an unsecured loan of 150 million Austrian schillings to the Austrian bank, which allowed Austria to overcome the difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Telegram from Peng Jiqun, Director of the Huludao Port Authority <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>To all newspapers and the people of all circles: Since the construction of Huludao Harbor, Jiqun has been serving as the Director of the Port Authority and concurrently as the Chief Engineer to supervise all the projects of the contractor, the Dutch Harbor Construction Company. I have been trying my best to maintain this great construction undertaking, which is related to the foundation of the country, and I have a heavy responsibility. I can only earnestly urge them in order to live up to the government's responsibility and the people's ardent hopes. However, since the Dutch company started construction last year, it has only sought its own benefit and disregarded the contract. It has delayed the project in various ways and simplified the materials. It has also treated the workers harshly, causing repeated disputes. There are too many errors to list. This office has repeatedly warned and urged them to improve. The files are piling up, but to no avail. Jiqun's responsibility lies in not daring to conceal the company's wrongdoing, and not daring to delay the port project for a long time. I would like to present to the people of the country a detailed account of the company's cunning development and various erroneous acts, focusing on the major ones: (1) The delay of the port project. According to the work schedule attached to the contract, the number of projects that the company has failed to complete on time each month is very large. As of the end of May this year, the production of concrete blocks is more than 8,800 cubic yards short, the placement of concrete blocks is more than 5,200 cubic yards short, the rubble project for the dam foundation is more than 11,000 cubic yards short, the backfilling is more than 3,500 cubic yards short, the deepening work is more than 115,000 cubic yards short, and the work wharf is more than 24,000 cubic yards short. The completion of this port project was originally scheduled for five and a half years. The company's performance in the first year is like this, so the future results can be known. This is the company's breach of contract and delay of the project. (2) The extraction of inferior stone materials. The solidity of the port project depends on the quality of the concrete blocks, and the quality of the concrete blocks depends on the quality of the stone. This office previously found that the company's use of inferior stone materials from Dongshan had a non-trivial impact on the port project. Therefore, at a meeting in Shenyang on January 24 this year, it was resolved that both parties would continue to select better stones. When this office found a sufficient amount of good stone according to the regulations and notified the company to use it, the company ignored it and insisted on using all the inferior stone from Dongshan. This is a blatant violation of the resolution, regardless of the port's interest. (3) Wanting to take the sand field more than ten kilometers away without paying. According to Article 11 of the contract, the contractor must pay for the sand and stone more than ten kilometers away from the No. 1 benchmark on the island, whether it is owned by the government or private individuals. Now that the company is using sand from Aijiatun, which is more than ten kilometers away from the island, it should pay the sand price according to the contract. The company even wanted to take it without paying. At first, it did not reply to the sand owner's price request, and then suddenly stopped the work of using sand, and instead demanded that this office guarantee that it could transport the sand as usual. It must be known that the sovereignty is involved, how can it be taken by force? The responsibility lies in not allowing cunning concealment. This is disregarding the contract and only seeking profit. (4) Treating workers harshly. The company has always treated workers harshly. It recruits them from thousands of miles away, promising to pay for their travel expenses. If they are not needed, they are immediately dismissed and the contract is changed. How dare these ignorant workers compare themselves? However, if they stay, there is no work to do, and if they return, it is difficult to raise travel expenses. They can only be seen walking on the streets, begging people. The company will never give them the return travel expenses according to the contract unless they come to this office to apply. Even when hiring, they also impose various restrictions. For the fixed wages, they either reduce them for no reason or deduct them on the pretext. For example, the wages of Russian Imushen Shechiji have not been paid in full to this day, which can be seen in general. Workers are forced by life to listen obediently. As for dangerous work, the company does not send personnel to guide them, and uses cooks with no skills to act as drivers, resulting in tragic deaths. The number of workers who have suffered deaths and injuries in this year is almost every month. The number of casualties is as high as dozens of people. The company does not pay attention to the prevention beforehand, nor does it comfort the wounded or bury the dead afterwards. This office has repeatedly negotiated with the company, but the company has not given a proper reply, resulting in many complaints and unresolved cases. This is the harsh treatment of workers that violates humanity. In short, the company's various erroneous acts and the lack of sincerity in the progress of the project are as described above. Jiqun's duty lies in not being able to remain silent. Recently, it has been found that the construction of Zhongshan and Haizhou ports is imminent, which is related to national construction. If contractors are still recruited, their past behaviors must be carefully assessed to avoid errors. In addition to Jiqun being responsible for this port project and doing his best to urge them to reflect on themselves and improve as soon as possible or take appropriate measures, I would like to report this by telegram.

<h3 id="e79">Mr. Hoover Advocates Studying War Debt Relief <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Since the end of the European War in 1918, war debts and reparations have immediately become extremely serious political and economic problems throughout Europe, prone to renewed disputes. The Allied powers, seeking to recover from the losses suffered in the war, saw their only method as obtaining compensation from defeated Germany. However, Germany had already exhausted its national strength during the war, and after the war, it had to bear huge reparations of over 130 billion marks. It was naturally impossible for Germany to meet these obligations. Therefore, to preserve its national vitality, Germany painfully accepted all the treaties and reparations at the Versailles Conference, willing to squeeze the flesh and blood of its people to appease the anger of the Allied powers and obtain a fragile lifeline. However, the national economy was fundamentally bankrupt, and domestic industries were at a standstill. Even with urgent demands, there was no way to extract resources when blood and skin were exhausted. Violating the treaty and suspending reparations became inevitable.</p>
<p>However, suspending reparations was unacceptable in practice. Firstly, the Allied powers were eager to recover their war losses. Secondly, the war debts owed to the United States required annual principal and interest payments, allowing no delay. The repayment of these war debts could only come from German reparations. If reparations were not secured, war debts could not be repaid either. Therefore, although reparations and war debts seemed unrelated on the surface, especially as the United States strongly denied any connection, stating it could not agree to combine the reparations issue with intergovernmental debts, in reality, it was impossible to deny that they were a circular debt closely linked. Unless the reparations and war debt issues were formally resolved, the European economy could not recover, and international tensions would not subside. To overcome this difficult situation, the Dawes Plan of 1924 and the Young Plan of 1929 emerged. From the Dawes Plan to the Young Plan, the Allied powers' exploitation of Germany became increasingly scientific and rationalized. For years, the German people were squeezed to pay reparations, while the United States sat back and collected war debts. Though the labor and leisure differed, and the experiences were bitter, they coexisted peacefully. Unfortunately, in recent years, the global economic panic has reached its peak. The international market has shrunk, prices have fallen, and agricultural products are oversupplied, causing a global recession. Germany has been affected by this, presenting a difficult situation again. The scientific and rational Young Plan has been shaken. In fact, the reparations and war debt issues are about to stir up the entire European situation again. The inability of the German economy to recover directly affects the recovery of the economies of European countries and the overall global economic slump. The seriousness of the problem is self-evident. How to remedy it is something we are waiting to see the wise plans of politicians. At this critical moment, the U.S. government, which had always maintained a strict barrier against mentioning the war debt issue, which is related to the reparations problem, has recently announced through President Hoover a one-year moratorium on war debt payments. Although this proposal has not yet been formally approved by Congress, there is little doubt that it will be in the future. Hoover's intention is to use the remaining strength of this year to allow countries to recuperate, seek economic recovery, and promote global prosperity, to save capitalist countries from their plight. At the same time, helping others is helping oneself. Although the United States is the wealthiest in the world, it has also fallen into a difficult situation due to the shrinking international market, overproduction, and increasing unemployment. Promoting the recovery of the global economy is no different from breaking through the difficulties and opening up a new path for the country. Therefore, this proposal will naturally win unanimous praise from the general public. To understand the relationship between war debts and reparations and to predict the future results of Hoover's proposal, it is necessary to revisit the old issues and trace them back once.</p>
<p>○○○○</p>
<p>The European peace conference concluded, and the Treaty of Versailles was formally signed, plunging the German people into an inescapable misfortune. According to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was liable for all losses suffered by the Allied people and their property due to German aggression on land, in the air, and at sea. At the same time, the Reparation Commission, jointly organized by the Allied powers, announced on April 27, 1921, that the total amount of reparations to be paid was 132 billion gold marks. Finally, including the Belgian war debt, the total amount was revised to 136 billion gold marks. The payment terms were that Germany had to pay the Allied powers 2 billion gold marks annually, plus 26% of export trade income, and a certain amount of coal and other raw materials. The Allied powers forced Germany to accept this amount and these conditions with an ultimatum on May 1, 1921. Germany, under threat, had no choice but to obey. From the date of signing the treaty to the end of 1922, Germany paid a total of 8 billion gold marks in reparations. However, using one's flesh to heal a wound could not last long. With its financial resources extremely depleted, Germany was unable to pay any further at the end of 1922. In January of the following year, French and Belgian forces took decisive action and occupied the Ruhr. Germany also resisted passively, suspending all reparations payments. After six months of stalemate, Germany's economic structure was fundamentally damaged and became increasingly unsustainable. The French and Belgian forces' extraction efforts were ultimately fruitless. At the same time, due to changes in the international situation, a reconsideration of the reparations issue was a unanimous demand of all countries. Thus, the famous Dawes Plan came into being.</p>
<p>The Dawes Committee was appointed by the Reparation Commission in 1923. Its main task was to re-evaluate Germany's ability to pay reparations and the methods of payment. The plan was drafted and submitted to the Reparation Commission in April 1924. In June of the same year, it was formally adopted by the Allied governments at a meeting in London.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the Dawes Plan was to remove the reparations issue from the government vortex and place it on the economic structure. It based the annual amount of reparations to be paid on Germany's ability to pay, not forcing Germany to pay a certain amount, but asking how much Germany could pay. The method of exploitation was to restore Germany's economic capacity as a condition for obtaining reparations, not just plundering Germany to the point of exhaustion. The committee assessed Germany's economic capacity and determined the standard annual amount (Standard Ammety) to be 2.5 billion gold marks. It reorganized Germany's budget, placing several revenue streams and the German central bank under the supervision of the Allied powers. Railways and other large industries were responsible for paying reparations. Each year, Germany raised funds and paid them to the Commissioner General for Reparations in Germany, who then had the Transfer Committee convert and transfer the funds to the creditor countries.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Dawes Plan was clearly an improvement in the Allied powers' method of exploiting Germany. On the one hand, the German economy did have a chance to recover. On the other hand, it was able to borrow more debts from abroad and remit them for reparations without experiencing difficulties. Therefore, from September 1, 1924, to March 1929, Germany paid a total of about 6 billion gold marks in reparations without delay.</p>
<p>However, the Dawes Plan was not entirely perfect. Although the emergence of the Dawes Plan partially solved the reparations problem, (1) although the plan stipulated the standard annual amount of reparations to be paid by Germany, it did not stipulate the total amount of reparations to be paid. There was no clear provision for how many years the standard annual amount should be paid. The future was uncertain, and Germany would never be able to pay off the reparations. Germany was constantly uneasy. (2) With the implementation of the Dawes Plan, Germany's finances, banking, railways, and industry were all under the strict supervision of the Allied powers, unable to be independent. This was also extremely dissatisfied by the Germans. (3) While Germany was making every effort to pay reparations, the troops stationed in the Rhineland were not withdrawn. This not only made Germany feel threatened at all times but also made it deeply feel the pain of the fragmentation of its territorial sovereignty. The Dawes Conference did not consider these political issues at all, perhaps viewing it as the only effective way to extort reparations. With so many shortcomings, the affected countries were eager to amend it. Therefore, a new committee of experts to amend the reparations plan finally met formally in Paris on February 11, 1929. The famous Young Plan came into being. The nature of the new committee of experts was no different from that of the Dawes Committee. However, its work was more difficult than that of the Dawes Committee. The Dawes Committee's work was limited to stipulating the standard annual amount of reparations to be paid by Germany, while the new committee had to determine the total amount of reparations to be paid based on Germany's ability to pay and taking into account the economic needs of the Allied powers. Considering the economic needs of the Allied powers was an extremely difficult problem. Due to war debt relations, the national conditions of the Allied countries were different, and their demands were also different. Slight dissatisfaction would lead to disputes. Therefore, the work proceeded with great difficulty. The committee met on February 21 and, after four months of research and discussion, was able to formulate a new reparations plan based on financial and economic realities and considering the political factors in the reparations issue, the so-called Young Plan.</p>
<p>The main points of the Young Plan were: (1) to organize an international bank as the agency for managing reparations; (2) to stipulate the total amount of reparations as 38,017,000,000 gold marks, allocate the annual amount of reparations (see attached tables (1) and (2)), and determine the payment period as 59 years; (3) to stipulate the ratio of distribution of reparations among the creditor countries (see attached table (3)); (4) to stipulate the composition of the annual amount of reparations and abolish all past financial and industrial guarantees and supervision; (5) to abolish the Prosperity Index.</p>
<p>The differences between the Young Plan and the Dawes Plan were: (1) the determination of the total amount of reparations and the payment period; (2) the abolition of the Prosperity Index; (3) the acquisition of German financial independence; (4) the commercialization of reparations; (5) the establishment of an international bank. In addition, the points in the Dawes Plan that were beneficial to Germany, such as the remittance clauses and the method of offsetting reparations with industrial products, were retained. In short, the Young Plan was to make up for the shortcomings of the Dawes Plan, extracting the flesh and blood of the Germans while not allowing Germany to immediately fall into a situation where it could not cope. The scientific and rationalization of its exploitation methods took great pains. The defeated country was like a piece of fat meat on the chopping board, left to be slaughtered. It was indeed sad. The creditor countries' step-by-step pressure and refusal to let go revealed the hideous face of imperialism. After the Young Plan was formulated, the Hague Conference to implement the plan was convened in August of the same year. This conference was extremely important because the issues discussed were not limited to economic and financial issues but also contained political issues. After multiple disputes and repeated discussions, except for the UK adding 36 million gold marks to the reparations annually, the entire Young Plan was accepted and implemented. The task of the Dawes Plan ended on August 30, 1929, and the Young Plan began on September 1 of the same year. At the same time, the political issue of withdrawing troops stationed in the Rhineland was formally resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Record of Chairman Chiang's Visit to Jiangxi <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Changing to the Jiangkun Warship at Hukou to Enter the Province</p>
<p>He, Lu, Chen, and Sun Jointly Went to Qiaoshe to Greet Him</p>
<p>Summoning He and Others That Night to Inquire About Everything</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang arrived in Jiangxi on the 21st of this month by the Yongsu Warship from Nanjing to suppress bandits. According to the estimated itinerary, he should arrive in the province on the afternoon of the 22nd. On the afternoon of that day, at 1 PM, heads of various agencies and leaders of various groups, wearing welcome badges, gathered at the Niuhang Station outside the city to welcome him. However, for the sake of security, the Provincial Government temporarily notified various agencies by telephone that there was no need to send representatives to participate. As for the security situation, from the Niuhang Station through Zhongshan Road to the Hundred Flowers Islet headquarters, troops were deployed by the Headquarters of the National Government Guard Division, the Garrison Headquarters, and the Provincial Public Security Bureau. Soldiers stood guard every five steps and sentries every ten steps. Patrol officers shuttled back and forth. At 2 PM, the headquarters received a telegram from Jiujiang stating: "Chairman Chiang stayed overnight in Anqing last night, summoned Chairman Chen and various division commanders, inquired about the military and political situation in Anhui Province, and gave instructions. He set sail at dawn this morning, passed Xiaogushan at 8:30 AM, stopped for one hour, and arrived at Hukou at 10 AM, stopped for 30 minutes, and then sailed on, etc." According to this itinerary, after the Yongsu Warship arrives in Xunyang, Chairman Chiang will disembark and transfer to a special train on the Nanzun Road to the province, and should arrive at 4 PM on the 22nd. However, to avoid the hustle and bustle of welcomes and send-offs from all walks of life in Jiujiang, Chairman Chiang took the waterway to the province and did not need to change trains. However, after entering the Gan River from Hukou, the waterway is not deep, and it is difficult for the Yongsu to navigate, so he changed to the Jiangkun Warship to sail up the Gan River. At this time, the welcoming personnel who had been waiting for a long time at Niuhang Station and outside the city changed to the Southeast Hotel along the river for rest, while He Yingqin, Lu Dipin, Chen Mingshu, Xiong Shihui, Sun Lianzhong, Tan Daoyuan, Gong Bingfan, Han Deqin, etc., took the Asian small steamer downstream at 2:30 PM to greet him at Qiaoshe Town. At 4 PM, the Jiangkun arrived at the town. He, Lu, and others boarded the ship to pay their respects, first performing a military salute, and then shaking hands with each other. Later, as it was already evening, Chairman Chiang took the Asian steamer to the province with He, Lu, and others. Earlier, at around 5 PM, the military and police authorities received a telegram that Chairman Chiang had passed Wucheng, and immediately ordered the military and police responsible for security to close traffic on Zhongshan Road, Yanjiang Road, etc. No one was allowed to pass, and even those with welcome permits were not allowed to move freely. Therefore, only armed military and police could be seen weaving back and forth on the road. At 11:30 PM that night, Chairman Chiang arrived at the shore with He and Lu in the bright moonlight and glittering lights. At that time, the military and police raised their guns, the military music played loudly, and the slogans of welcomes from all walks of life and the booming of the salutes mixed together. After disembarking, Chairman Chiang took a car to the headquarters to reside. Those who came with him and the welcoming personnel also took more than 20 cars and sped away. After resting briefly at the headquarters, Chairman Chiang summoned He Yingqin, Xiong Shihui, Chen Mingshu, Sun Lianzhong, Chen Cheng, and other important generals at midnight to inquire about everything. He and others also gave a brief report on the bandit suppression matters. The rest have not yet been received. It is heard that Chairman Chiang is scheduled to convene a military conference in the coming days to discuss and decide on the liaison and combat methods, advancement steps, and all issues of the various departments, to achieve a consistent suppression of the Red bandits.

<p>Anqing Correspondence: The counties of Lu'an and other places in Anhui Province have long suffered from the Red disaster, and the people have been displaced and are in urgent need of rescue. Chen Diaoyuan, the commander-in-chief of the General Reserve Corps and the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, recently had the intention of touring. He first ordered Li Jun, the chief adjutant of the headquarters, to inform the Wuda and Anzhen steamer companies to raise fire and be ready to depart, and ordered them to listen to the command of Chen Guiqing, the head of the Public Relations Section of the corps. At 9 AM on the 23rd, Chen reported at the standing meeting of the Provincial Government that he would go to the Hefei and Lu'an areas today (the 24th) to inspect military affairs and requested that the chairman be publicly elected as his proxy. After deliberation, it was decided to publicly elect Zhu Xi, the Provincial Committee member and director of the Civil Affairs Department, as the proxy and report to the central government. At the same time, he ordered the Guard Regiment of the Provincial Government to allocate two companies, led by Adjutant Gu Peilin, to be responsible for security. At around 10 PM that night, Chen left the Provincial Government and went to the Hong'an Pier outside the Xiaonanmen to board the Wuda steamer and set off for Wuwei. It is expected to stay in Wuwei for one day, then transfer to the Hefei and Lu'an areas to inspect defense and supervise the suppression of the Red bandits to eradicate them as soon as possible. The date of returning to the province is still difficult to predict. Those who went with Chen were Bai Baoshan and the corps' councilors Li Yanqing, Fan Minqing, Zhu Tongxun, Lin Bacui, Chen Jiucou, Li Hanqing, the chief of the Medical Department Yang Guangpu, the chief of the Quartermaster Department Li Fengqing, staff officers Yao Jiangong, Chen Hongshou, adjutants Chen Guiting, Gu Peilin, and Du Zuyu, a member of the Ordnance Department. All the accompanying staff and guards took the Wuda and Anzhen steamers at the same time and set off. (June 24)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Hunan Province Investigates and Prohibits the Entry of Jiangxi Bandits for Trade <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Cutting off the Supply of Various Supplies to the Red Bandits</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Hunan Provincial Clean-up Command stated that Jiangxi bandits often send bandit-transformed farmers and workers, under the guise of small-scale trade, to secretly carry gold and silver to Hunan to purchase cloth, food, and various supplies. In this way, not only do the Red bandits rely on this for supply and infiltration into the hinterland to spy on military information, affecting the clean-up, but it is also extremely important. Yesterday, a special order was issued that all merchants from neighboring provinces are not allowed to enter the country, and even genuine merchants inside and outside the province are not allowed to be greedy for private gain and transport goods to help the bandits. The order reads: "It has been found that the Red bandits in Jiangxi Province, due to our army's large-scale encirclement and suppression, are extremely short of food, supplies, and military supplies. To prolong their survival and spy on information, they send bandit-transformed farmers and workers from Yongxin, Lianhua, and other counties, under the guise of small-scale trade, to secretly carry gold or cash to Hunan to purchase cloth, food, handheld electric lights, Western medicine, printing presses, sewing machines, and various supplies. They carry them in baskets and carts, one after another. In this situation, not only do the Red bandits rely on this supply and attempt to make a dying struggle, but they also infiltrate into the hinterland to spy on military information, which is of utmost importance to the future of the clean-up. The headquarters previously received reports and learned about the previous situation, and also received a report from the You County Security Corps that the county had discovered the facts of bandit merchants transporting goods. It is necessary to strictly ban it to facilitate the suppression. Hereafter, bandits and merchants from neighboring provinces will not be allowed to enter the country for trade. Those who have already entered the country must investigate the circumstances and deal with them separately. Even genuine merchants inside and outside the province are not allowed to be greedy for private gain and transport goods to help the bandits. Within the province, the military and police chiefs in the provincial capital are ordered to order their subordinates to investigate at any time. Special attention should be paid to the Yongxin Wharf and the Dajin Wharf. Outside the province, the clean-up troops, the county chiefs, and the security corps are ordered to handle the matter conscientiously and without negligence. In addition to the separate orders, the chiefs are ordered to record the orders and post announcements in the thoroughfares and strictly order their subordinates to comply with them. The date of receiving the documents and the handling situation should be reported for verification. This order."</p>

<p>Japanese-Owned Dongtuo Company Loses Lawsuit</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The lawsuit between the Jinan Telephone Company and the Japanese-owned Dongyang Tuozhi Co., Ltd. over debt was heard by the High Court on the 16th of this month, and the end of the debate was announced. At 2 PM today (the 22nd), the High Court pronounced judgment in the Civil Division Two. The presiding judge Yu Jianshu, Judge Yi Xin, Ding Yikui, and clerk Yan Huaqi attended the court. Yoshi Tianzhen, the agent of the appellant Dongtuo Company, did not attend due to business and temporarily re-entrusted Gao Gang Qianji (Japanese) to attend as an agent, as well as Yan Chenghan, the agent of the appellant Telephone Company. After the court opened, the presiding judge Yu Jianshu first asked Gao Gang Qianji his age, address, occupation, and reasons for acting as an agent, and then stood up to announce the verdict, read the main text of the judgment, and stated to the appellant that if he did not agree with the judgment, he had 26 days to appeal to the Supreme Court, otherwise it would not take effect, and then adjourned the court. The main text of the judgment is recorded below: "The original judgment on the defendant, Jinan Telephone Company, jointly and severally repaying the plaintiff, the Japanese-owned foreign company, 420,000 yuan in principal and its interest, and bearing the litigation costs, is all changed.

<h3 id="e84">Shandong Provincial Government Decides to Establish Xiangfang County <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Located at the Intersection of Lintan, Fei, and Yi Counties</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zhang Weicun and others from Tancheng County previously stated that the intersection of Linyi, Tancheng, Fei, and Yi counties has always been an area where bandits frequent. Because the distance between them and the county seat is far away, the county government has a sense of being out of reach. Therefore, they submitted a report to the provincial government, intending to add a new county, named Xiangfang. After deliberation by the provincial government, it was handed over to the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Bureaus for joint survey. At today's (23rd) standing meeting of the provincial government, it was decided to approve the establishment. The proposal reads: "The Secretariat reported that Zhang Weicun and others submitted a case for the establishment of a county at the intersection of Lintan, Fei, and Yi counties. After repeated surveys, please send personnel to prepare as soon as possible so that the new county can be established as soon as possible to conform to public opinion. Please make a public decision." Attached is the report of Zhang Weicun and others: The intersection of Lintan, Fei, and Yi counties has always been an area where bandits frequent. Previously, a report was submitted requesting the establishment of a new county. The Civil Affairs Bureau sent personnel to survey in the past, and the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Bureaus jointly surveyed afterward, all believing that it was necessary to establish a county seat. The Lin City area is more than 100 li west from Yi County, more than 100 li north from Fei County, and nearly 100 li southeast from Tancheng. It is more than 80 li northeast from Lin Yi, the closest. The political forces have the difficulty of being out of reach. It is not enough to increase the county seat to deter them. In a blink of an eye, the green gauze tent is rising again, and it will be a time for bandits to be rampant. The citizens are concerned about their lives and property, and earnestly request that personnel be dispatched immediately to prepare so that the new county seat can be established as soon as possible to avoid burning, looting, and displacement, and to conform to public opinion."

<p>Fire Erupts at Jewish Synagogue in Daoli</p>
<p>Eleven Firefighters Injured or Killed</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: At 4:20 AM on the 18th, a fire carelessly broke out at the Jewish synagogue on Paotai Street in Daoli. The fire initially was not large, but tragically, eleven firefighters were injured or killed in the line of duty, making it the most devastating firefighting incident in Harbin's history. The facts are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e87">Before and After the Fire <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Jewish synagogue was built over a decade ago, and its beams and pillars were decaying, no longer able to bear heavy loads. However, due to years of renovation, its exterior still appeared to be a well-maintained structure. Recently, the synagogue contracted workers to paint its exterior, and the golden-yellow walls shone brightly and beautifully. The work was still unfinished when, unexpectedly, around 4:00 AM on the 18th, a fire suddenly broke out inside, sending smoke and flames into the sky. The First Fire Brigade of the Municipality spotted the fire and immediately dispatched a team. As the synagogue was a tall, three-story building with a hollow interior and no place to climb, the fire originated between the ceiling and the roof, making it difficult to extinguish. Therefore, the fire continued to burn despite extended efforts. At 4:30 AM, the Second Fire Brigade of the Municipality and the Police Fire Brigade received the news and arrived to help, working together to put out the fire. By around 6:00 AM, the fire had subsided.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Tragedy Occurs <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>At this time, the synagogue roof was still emitting dense smoke and flames. Russian and Chinese members of the First and Second Fire Brigades climbed onto the roof using ladders. They used axes and hooks to break open the roof tiles, hoping to locate the source of the fire. Unfortunately, the interior of the roof was partially destroyed by the fire and unable to bear the weight. With a loud crash, the entire roof collapsed, causing over ten Chinese and Russian firefighters working on the roof to fall from a height of over forty feet into the synagogue's interior. Simultaneously, the roof exploded, and broken beams, shattered pillars, and debris fell down, crushing the firefighters below. The remaining embers continued to burn. Firefighters working outside witnessed the disaster and immediately risked their lives to enter and rescue their comrades.

<p>Li Ashou, a carpenter at the Yeqin Yarn Factory outside the Dongmen, was delivering lunch to the Yongyu Silk Factory when he had a quarrel with Wang Yucheng, a factory guard. He was beaten to death by the guard and Song Ada, a rickshaw puller. After the various labor unions organized a support association, the support association held an executive committee meeting the afternoon before last and resolved the following: (1) Request the county party headquarters to uphold justice; (2) Request the county court to handle the Li case quickly and detain and prosecute Wu Xilin, the principal offender who instigated the murder; (3) Request the county government to dismiss and punish Wang Weixin, the chief of the Public Security Third Branch Bureau, for neglecting his duties and treating human life carelessly; (4) Request the Party, government, and judicial organs to investigate the case of bribing public opinion and seriously warn all sectors; (5) Telegraph all labor unions in the country to request unanimous support; (6) Telegram the central government to pay attention to the safety and security of workers' lives and to restore the vertical organization of labor unions.

Chief Prosecutor Zhou Erkai received them. After the representatives explained the purpose of the petition, Chief Zhou said that the case was of great importance and he had ordered the detention center to stop Wang and Song, the two murderers in custody, from meeting with relatives and friends. The court will open this Saturday and summons have been issued. If Wu Xilin does not arrive by the deadline, he will be summoned for detention or put on the wanted list. In short, he will be dealt with in accordance with legal procedures and will never be let go. The representatives thought it was satisfactory and resigned. After reporting to the workers, they continued to go to the county government to petition. County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia met them in Wenxitang. After the representatives submitted the petition face-to-face, they requested that Wang Weixin, the chief of the Public Security Third Branch Bureau, be dismissed and investigated. County Magistrate Pan accepted the petition and promised to send a letter to the county court prosecutor's office to inquire whether Wang Weixin should be dismissed and brought to justice for questioning. He will then review and handle the case in a fair and impartial manner. Please pass this on to the workers and wait for news.

<p>Fan Qingyuan, the chief driver of the Shengyu Silk Factory in Nanqiao Town, Yangming Township, Section 3 of Xiyi, has been managing twelve cars in the factory this year. He has repeatedly oppressed the female workers on weekdays, and the female workers have had to let him do whatever he wants in order to make a living. Recently, Fan has extended the working hours by more than 40 minutes per day, so some female workers were unwilling. They had staged a strike a month ago. Later, the labor union sent staff to the countryside to mediate and the matter was settled. However, the female workers of the factory went on strike for the second time the day before yesterday, saying that they would not work if Fan was in office and that they would resume work on the same day if Fan left office. Their attitude was very firm, and they made slogans and shouted together, "Down with Fan Qingyuan!" The reason for the strike was still due to the extended working hours. Manager Gao Shufang of the factory came out to settle the matter, and the staff of the silk factory labor union tried their best to persuade the female workers. As a result, the chief driver Fan Qingyuan voluntarily resigned. The working hours are still the same as before, and the female workers are satisfied and agreed to go to work as usual yesterday morning (24th).</p>

On the 23rd, Wang Xiaowu, the chief of the First Section of the Public Security Bureau, Gu Yuanlai, the chief of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and Jiang Wenzu, a member of the County Reorganization Committee, were dispatched to persuade them. The most important point that the workers requested was to refer to the example of the transfer of the former Dalun Yarn Factory to the Dacheng Yarn Factory, dismiss the workers, and pay each of them four and a half months' wages. The transfer and reorganization will take at least two or three months. The living conditions of the workers during this shutdown period should also be taken into consideration. However, according to the intentions of Committee Member Jiang and others, the severance pay should only be limited to those who do not continue to work. However, despite repeated persuasion, there was still no solution. Factory owner Rong Ersheng in Wuxi heard the news and said that the amount requested was too large and could not be approved. He will personally come to Changzhou to handle and resolve the matter within the next few days.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 rickshaw pullers in Nantong have been on strike against donations for three months because the Construction Bureau has not repaired the roads but has increased the rickshaw donations.

<p>Madame Chen Jiang, a widow from Jiangdu living at No. 5 Jiangjun Lane in the city, has no inheritance, only a daughter named Ruiying, sixteen years of age. The mother and daughter depend on each other to make a living, which is insufficient, so their relative, Jiang, provides assistance. Previously, due to the provincial capital moving to the town, Jiang opened Hengda Cigarette and Paper Store opposite the gate of the Civil Affairs Office to be close to his relatives. Because the store was small, Madame Chen Jiang prepared their meals daily, and her daughter delivered them. Over time, Xie Shaoqing, who worked as a clerk in the Education Office, saw Ruiying's beauty and became infatuated with her. He would flirt with her on the way, but the girl was unwilling to accept his advances and dared not refuse him, so she tried to avoid him. On the 7th of this month, Xie Shaoqing, unable to fulfill his desire for a long time, discussed the matter with his ten sworn brothers to devise a plan. That evening at ten o'clock, taking advantage of the quiet and dark, they invited Li Zhicai, Zhu Jianqing, Zhao Chunsheng, Zhang Chengzhi, and others to wait for the girl at the entrance of Baota Lane. When they saw her arrive, they stuffed a cloth into her mouth and dragged her to Wang Gengyun's house in Masi Lane, threatening her in every way, intending to marry her immediately. The girl refused, preferring death, but Xie Shaoqing and others forcibly gang-raped her. The girl was young and weak and could not withstand the violence, and fainted several times. Her mother waited until late at night and, seeing that her daughter had not returned, went to the store to inquire and learned that she had disappeared, and was heartbroken. Her relative, surnamed Jiang, had the girl's picture taken overnight and made multiple copies, which he presented to various military and police agencies, requesting investigation and arrest. Later, Deputy Officer Dong of the Security Department learned of the matter and negotiated with Xie and others to release the girl. After she told her story, everyone who heard it was outraged. Her mother hired someone to report the situation to the court prosecutor's office, which immediately issued arrest warrants. Court police officer Lu Fusheng arrested Xie Shaoqing, Xie Zhicai, Zhao Chunsheng, and Zhu Jianqing and brought them to court for questioning. Madame Chen Jiang testified as described above, while Xie equivocated. They were immediately detained. The details are still under investigation, and therefore cannot be fully disclosed at this time, but the prosecutor is conducting a thorough investigation and will severely punish them.</p>

Unexpectedly, the next day, the pawn ticket was used for Western goods. Xu reported this to the military police inspection team, which transferred the case to the Public Security Bureau. After strict interrogation, Zhang was evasive. He only handed over the pawn ticket. Later, fake symbols and collar badges were found. Because the matter involved impersonating an official and defrauding money, he was handed over to the Hangzhou District Court yesterday afternoon along with witnesses for detention and trial.</p>

<p>The 16th company, 4th battalion, 7th regiment of the provincial security team stationed in Xincang Town in the eastern district of Pinghu and divided a platoon each to Yaqian and Xinmiao towns nearby, staged a mutiny. Company commander Guo Bin usually managed his troops strictly. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 AM on the 23rd, the soldiers from the two platoons stationed in Xinmiao and Yaqian secretly gathered in Xincang, tied up Company Commander Guo, and then went to the district office to demand 100,000 yuan in pay. District Chief Zhu Chenguang claimed that he was raising the money with local figures, so they forced him to go to the residence of Zhou Guiting, a local gentleman, and Ma Qibin, a standing committee member of the district party headquarters, to discuss a solution. Zhou Guiting took the opportunity to escape. Ma and Zhu were then injured by the mutinous soldiers. They then went to the Public Security Bureau to rob six guns and released seven bandits, including Jiang Lairong, instructing them to loot the entire town. The greatest losses were suffered by Xia Wanchang's jewelry store and Chongyu Money Exchange, totaling approximately 17,000 yuan. After looting, they went to Sancha River to loot the weapons of the local defense corps. They discovered that the local force was prepared, and their attack was thwarted, with the result that the local defense corps seized eleven rifles. At around ten o'clock, the mutinous soldiers looted two foreign goods stores in Huxiaoqiao Town and cut the telephone lines in the east market. In the afternoon, they went to Zhapu Town, first going to the chamber of commerce to demand money without success. They then guarded the four city gates, first looting the weapons of the Public Security Bureau, and then looting house by house. The Guangji pawnshop on West Gate Street suffered the greatest losses. All the rich merchants on the north and south river beaches were spared no loss. After looting, they swarmed to the seawall outside the south gate to seal ships and wait for the tide, preparing to escape by sea. On the morning of the 23rd, the various agencies in the county seat received the news and telegraphed the 7th Regiment Headquarters in Jiaxing and the Provincial Government and Security Department in Hangzhou. By 5:00 PM, two companies of security troops and several naval police ships had arrived from Jiaxing to pursue and arrest the mutineers. The naval police had already captured the mutineers Li Ronglin and a special commissioner on the afternoon of the 23rd and found several stolen goods on them, which have been sent to the local clearance bureau for disposal.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Great Revolution in the Japanese Education System and the Lessons for Our Country by Ma Zongrong <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Education is like sunlight and air, something that everyone can take and no one can monopolize. However, in reality, the benefits of education, or rather, the freedom to receive education, are often occupied by a few. In other words, the current education system is too formalized and ignores social and economic conditions. As a result, those who obtain the equivalent of a junior high school education through self-study are often unable to enter high school because they lack a formal diploma, and those who obtain the equivalent of a high school education are often unable to enter university because they lack a high school diploma. On the other hand, the children of wealthy families can enroll in university, drift through for several years, and obtain bachelor's or master's degrees. We in the education field, after careful examination, are truly dissatisfied with the current formalized education system.</p>
<p>This feeling is not unique to us. Imperialist Japanese education scholars also have the same feeling. Therefore, taking advantage of this reform of the school system by the Japanese Ministry of Education, they have made many statements and suggestions to the Japanese Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo Dentsu News Agency dispatch on the 22nd of this month, the Japanese Ministry of Education held a meeting on the afternoon of the 31st to discuss and consider various opinions, and radically reformed the country's school system. The main points of the reform are:</p>
<p>1.  Schools are only divided into three levels: elementary school, middle school, and university.</p>
<p>2.  Free admission is permitted.</p>
<p>3.  Night schools for young people are established for those who cannot attend school.</p>
<p>4.  The entrance qualifications for each school are abolished to implement complete education.</p>
<p>The above education plan will be finalized this autumn and submitted to the Cultural and Political Review Committee for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>We know that "education" first arose among the wealthy class and intellectuals, most of whom had no worries about life. Therefore, the education systems formulated by them in various countries around the world are very formalized, naturally making it difficult for the children of the poor to receive education. However, the present era has become a society based on the masses. In order to achieve the strength of the entire people, all people should have the opportunity to receive education, and the formalized sports system should be reformed first. Imperialist Japan, a country where the classes of nobles and commoners still exist, a country that worships Western things in everything, still knows how to radically carry out a revolution in the school system: (1) Abolish the entrance qualifications for each school, and permit those with real ability to freely enroll; (2) Establish night schools for young people for those who cannot attend school. So what lessons can the Republic of China, a republic with equality for all people, a Republic of China that is revolutionary in everything, learn? I believe that our country's education authorities should pay attention to:</p>
<p>1.  It is not appropriate to completely imitate the Western education system.</p>
<p>2.  Abolish the entrance qualifications for each school, base everything on ability, and permit free application to the corresponding school.</p>
<p>3.  Add night classes to all levels of schools.</p>

<p>The Qinghua University turmoil has dragged on for many days. According to a senior official of the Ministry of Education, external observations of the Qinghua incident are often inaccurate, leading newspapers to often use words such as mediation. In reality, this matter only involves handling and not mediation. Because President Wu is appointed by the government and has been explicitly retained to continue to be responsible. Even with the professors, they are only providing opinions, and the power to make decisions rests with the government. The Ministry of Education's handling of this matter has already been clearly pointed out in two points when President Jiang Menglin was telegraphed with the intentions: the regulations that have been revised cannot be changed, and the president should continue to serve. President Wu is still in Beiping handling school affairs as usual. The Ministry of Education still hopes that the professors can dispel misunderstandings so that school affairs can proceed and quickly return to normal. As for Mr. Qian Changzhao going to Beiping, Chairman Jiang instructed the Ministry of Education to send him to investigate, because the situation reported in the northern newspapers was too complicated, so Mr. Qian was sent to take a look in order to facilitate handling, etc.</p>

<p>Eight Middle Schools and One Normal School</p>
<p>Previously, the faculty and staff of various provincial middle schools in Zhejiang Province, dissatisfied with the Director of Education Zhang Daofan, planned to collectively demand salaries and strike. Zhang, upon hearing the news, submitted his resignation and went to Beijing alone to avoid their criticism. The faculty and staff of various provincial middle schools, in the name of the Zhejiang Provincial Middle School Faculty and Staff Federation, telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting the prompt appointment of a worthy successor. After Zhang was retained by the provincial government and the central government and returned to Zhejiang to take office, the Ministry of Education considered the federation's interference in educational administration to be highly inappropriate and consulted with the Zhejiang Provincial Government to stop the federation's activities and order its dissolution. It is now known that the Department of Education has made considerable changes to the principals of various provincial middle schools. Except for the principals of the Sixth Middle School and the Medical School, who requested to resign and were retained, the principals of the First, Second, Third, Seventh, and Eighth Middle Schools remain the same, while the others have been reassigned. The Department of Education announced yesterday the appointment of Ye Suzhong as the principal of the Provincial Senior Middle School, Shen Qida as the principal of the Provincial Fourth Middle School, Shen Jinxiang as the principal of the Provincial Fifth Middle School, Sun Yunxia as the principal of the Provincial Ninth Middle School, Wang Yuhuan as the principal of the Provincial Tenth Middle School, Zhao Zhongsu as the principal of the Provincial Eleventh Middle School, Huang Tongyi as the principal of the Provincial Xianghu Rural Normal School, and Sun Jianwen as the principal of the Second Division of the Provincial First Middle School (i.e., Girls' Middle School). In addition, at the request of the municipal government, Tong Mengsheng was appointed as the principal of the Hangzhou Municipal Junior Middle School. Furthermore, the Hangzhou Middle School, which is currently under preparation, held its second board meeting yesterday and elected Chen Zhongming as the principal of the school.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second week of the Wimbledon tennis tournament. After the rain, there were even more spectators than the first day. Women gathered, dressed in bright colors, around the center court. When Austin (Austin is the hope for British singles) entered the court in his school uniform, the crowd cheered for his victory.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Strong Player Sato Loses <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Sato Hyotaro received a blow to the head yesterday in the second week, far from matching Austin. Austin's serve was as heavy as a shot, passing over the net like a hurricane. Sato could not resist his shots, Sato could only desperately defend the baseline, only passing it once or twice when Austin defended the net. Austin touched the net several times. In the end, Sato Hyotaro had no choice but to resign himself to fate. The scores were six to one, six to three, and six to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Two of the Five Japanese Players Eliminated <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Two of the five Japanese players were eliminated yesterday, Sato Hyotaro and Aoki. Aoki lost to Whiteley. The first set was fought to five to five. Aoki's weakness was fully exploited by Whiteley, so he lost. The difference in size between Sato Jiro and Rochus was almost astonishing. Rochus was exhausted from running around, while Sato moved around like a mouse from east to west. Sato constantly heavily drew back and quickly ran to the net, smashing with all his strength. Kawachi, only seventeen years old, was greatly praised for defeating Snowie yesterday.</p>

Many other female players imitated them and competed without wearing socks. Although the women's clothing conference has no explicit regulations, such dress has existed for several years, and the conference has informally expressed its disapproval.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Western Constable from Cross-Border Precinct Injures Chinese Police Officer on Haig Road <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Arising from Minor Account Disputes</p>
<p>Will Become a Serious International Negotiation</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Kong Qingfeng, a police officer from the Second Precinct of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau in Xujiahui, was shot and injured by Western Constable Harcott from the Jing'an Temple Police Station at the home of an American named Smith at 858 Haig Road. Haig Road is a road built by the Municipal Council beyond its boundaries. Police jurisdiction is in our country's hands, and it is under the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. This matter arose from a debt of thirty-five dollars, which was originally very trivial, but Smith was ignorant of the facts, leading to this unexpected incident. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e153">Debt Outstanding for Eight Months <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>An American named Smith, who works for an advertising company, lives at 858 Haig Road, which is numbered 25 in the Chinese area. In November of last year, he ordered three pairs of children's trousers and one coat from the Meidi Tailor Shop at 1934 near Jiaotong University on the same road, totaling thirty-five dollars. After the goods were delivered, Smith did not pay the debt. The shop owner, Yang Zhiqing, repeatedly demanded payment for eight months without receiving a penny. On the 14th of this month, Yang went to collect the debt again, as the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching. Smith reluctantly gave him a check from the Meifeng Bank, dated the 17th of this month, for thirty dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Check Bounces <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the check, Yang Zhiqing of the Meidi Tailor Shop used it the next day at the Tongxingxiang Cloth Shop in Xujiahui to pay a bill. Subsequently, it was transferred to other households. However, the last person holding the check was refused payment when they went to the bank to cash it. The check was then returned to Yang Zhiqing. Yang considered the bounced check to be worthless, so he went to Smith's place the day before yesterday to reason with him and demand the old debt. At that time, Smith's attitude was tough, refusing to exchange the check or pay the debt, making unreasonable arguments, pushing Yang out the door, and even beating and scolding him.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Report to the Public Security Bureau <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>At around 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Yang, along with Mao Fengxi, who opened a leather shoe shop nearby, went to return the check and demand payment. At that time, Smith was not home, but his wife received them, falsely telling Yang and others that she would go to the bank to withdraw the money and pay the debt, and then drove away in a car. Yang knew things were not good, so he reported the information to the nearby police post, who reported it to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. Director Liu Yunfang then dispatched two police officers, Kong Qingfeng and Yan Lunxing, to investigate the situation and mediate.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Armed Western Constable Arrives <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>After leaving the house, the Western woman went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report an emergency, bringing an armed Western constable and a Chinese detective to the house. Two police officers from the Second Precinct of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, Kong and Yan, were ordered to go there. However, as soon as they entered the door, disaster struck.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Western Constable Suddenly Opens Fire <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The person sent by the Jing'an Temple Police Station was Western Constable Harcott, number 14. After Chinese policeman Kong Qingfeng entered the door, without asking any questions, Harcott pushed him out with force and immediately raised his gun and fired two shots. The second shot hit Kong in the right arm. Kong retreated with injuries and no longer advanced, immediately reporting to the station. Director Liu considered the situation to be serious and led several police officers to the scene to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Both Constables Disarmed <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>When the Director of the Second Precinct of the Sixth District arrived at the scene, the Sub-District Director of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, Sterbal, the Area Director of Area B of the Municipal Council Police Department, Weirather, the Area Detective Chief Clough, and the American Consul also arrived one after another. After negotiations by Director Liu, the offending Western constable was taken back under guarantee by the head constable, and both pistols were unloaded and taken to the station. Smith's debt was paid on the spot.</p>
<h3 id="e159">A Long Gun Found During Search <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese police also found a long gun in Smith's home, with a bullet in the chamber that had not yet been ejected. It was said that Smith had raised the gun and made a shooting motion at the time. Since there was no municipal gun license, it was taken back to the station along with the Western constable's and the Chinese detective's pistols.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Situation is Very Serious <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>At the time of the incident, the Jing'an Temple Police Station dispatched a large team of armed Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. At the same time, the Second Squad of the Police Corps stationed in Fahuazhen, upon learning of the situation, also sent dozens of car patrol teams and machine gun teams to the scene to maintain order. Traffic was cut off for a time, and the situation was serious. Director Liu considered the matter to be of great importance and reported it to the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Chen, by telephone. Director Chen then personally went to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District in Xujiahui. Later, Western Detective Chief Clough and Head Constable Sterbal, along with Director Chen, repeatedly discussed the matter and guaranteed medical expenses, so the matter was resolved soon, and the storm temporarily ended.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Post-Incident Negotiations <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that Director Chen, for the sake of prudence, intends to propose four solutions: (1) Compensation for medical expenses, (2) A formal apology to the authorities, (3) A guarantee that unfortunate incidents will not occur again in the future, and (4) In the future, all actions by the personnel of the concession police station, including Chinese and Western constables, on roads built beyond the boundaries must not be taken without the permission and formal notification of the Public Security Bureau of the relevant district.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Municipal Finance Bureau Schedules Collection of Business Tax <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Regulations Have Been Reported to the Ministry for Record</p>
<p>The Municipal Business Tax has been in preparation by the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, which established a preparatory office. The draft of the business tax collection regulations, implementation rules, and tax rate tables were all drafted by the preparatory office, which invited representatives from the Chamber of Commerce to participate in discussions and agreed to begin collection on July 1. The preparatory office has now submitted the revised drafts to the Municipal Finance Bureau, which has forwarded them to the Municipal Government for submission to the Ministry of Finance for record. The original consultation and drafts are disclosed below:</p>
<h3 id="e163">Consultation <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government consults the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Regarding the matter of consultation, according to the report of Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau and Director of the Business Tax Preparatory Office, 'Reporting the submission of the draft of the Municipal Business Tax Collection Regulations and Implementation Rules and Tax Rate Table for review and approval.' It is found that the business tax, according to Article 9, Section 3 of the Municipal Organization Law, is a type of municipal financial income. The Ministry previously ordered preparations to be made, considering Shanghai to be the most prosperous commercial area in the country, as well as a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, its situation is very different from other provinces and cities. If the planning is not thorough, the handling will be difficult. Therefore, since the establishment of this office, the drafting of all regulations has carefully considered the situation in Shanghai and made prudent considerations in order to facilitate future implementation and avoid conflicts. Now, with reference to the Ministry of Finance's 'Outline and Supplementary Measures for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces,' we have separately drafted three drafts: 'Municipal Business Tax Collection Regulations and Implementation Rules' and 'Curriculum Standards Tax Rate Table,' and have repeatedly invited representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Yansong, Fang Jiaobo, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Wenqi, Chen Songyuan, etc., to participate in discussions, jointly discuss, and revise the original tax rates, regulations, and implementation rules according to different situations. The tax rates have been reduced as much as possible, and the collection methods have also been simplified as much as possible in order to facilitate implementation. The drafts have now been completed and submitted to the Ministry for review and registration for the sake of public convenience.' Accordingly, the draft is enclosed and submitted to the Ministry for review and registration, sincerely wishing for public cooperation. This consultation is to the Ministry of Finance."</p>

<p>Registers Were Separately Completed and Returned to the Capital to Report on Their Mission</p>
<p>Liu Guangyan, a section chief specially dispatched by the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Li Dexuan, a clerk, arrived in Shanghai to inspect the Wusong Fortress. Yesterday morning, at approximately 8:00 AM, they traveled by car from Shanghai to Wusong and proceeded to the fortress. They were received by Commander Deng Zhenquan, who immediately ordered Chen Yuwen, commander of the South Shitou Battery; Wu Changqing, commander of the North Battery; Shi Ze, commander of the Lion Grove Battery; and Gu Ding, commander of the garrison battalion, to assemble their respective troops in preparation for inspection. Subsequently, Teng Jushou, the chief of staff of the headquarters, and Zhu Song, the officer on duty for the</p>

They then proceeded to the garrison battalion to inspect the infantry, after which they returned to the headquarters for lunch. After lunch, they continued to the Lion Grove Battery for inspection and then went to the Sanguantang to survey the general gunpowder depot. Upon completion of the inspection, they separately filled out the registers and, at approximately 5:00 PM, returned to Shanghai by the same vehicle to return to the capital and report on their mission.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Domestic Cotton Production Statistics for the Past Five Years <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Fields Totaling 37,593,012 Mu</p>
<p>Cotton Production Totals 8,800,956 Dan</p>
<p>丨Investigation by the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association丨</p>
<p>Since 1919, the Cotton Production Statistics Department of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association has dispatched personnel to the cotton-producing provinces and regions within the country to conduct on-site investigations of cotton production. These investigations have continued for twelve years without interruption. In recent years, due to considerable cooperation with the leading cotton farms and cotton industry organizations in various provinces and regions within the country, progress has gradually been seen. In 1930, the Association completed its investigation and final estimation of domestic cotton production (including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces). The findings were published, revealing a total of 37,593,012 mu of cotton fields and 8,800,956 dan of seed cotton produced. The final estimated figures for cotton fields and production amounts for the past five years are listed below for comparison:</p>
<p>Year　　　Cotton Fields (Unit: Mu)　　　　　Production Amount (Unit: Dan)</p>
<p>1930　　37,593,012　　　　　8,800,956</p>

<p>1926　　27,349,727　　　　　6,243,385</p>
<p>The figures for 1928 and 1929 have been revised and therefore differ from the previously published numbers. Detailed figures for each province can be found in the China Cotton Production Statistics published by the Association.</p>

<p>Lamenting Xie’s Close Relationship with the Dalai Lama, but His Death Before Reaching Tibet</p>
<p>The War Originated from a Minor Incident; the People’s Hearts Return to the Central Government</p>
<p>Tan Yunshan, the chief writer for the Xing Shang Chinese Overseas Newspaper in Myanmar, who formerly accompanied Xie Guoliang, a special envoy dispatched by the National Government, on a mission to Tibet for investigation, has been preparing to leave Shanghai for Nanjing today after arriving in Shanghai on the 20th of this month. Mr. Tan will replace Mr. Xie in reporting everything to the National Government, as Special Envoy Xie Guoliang died en route. Before leaving Shanghai, Mr. Tan spoke in detail with a reporter from Xin Sheng She about the latest situation in Tibet and his experiences in Tibet. The details of his talk are recorded below in separate sections:</p>
<h3 id="e169">Journey to Tibet <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Tan said that Special Envoy Xie's mission to Tibet was initially undertaken only with his son. When they reached Maymyo in Myanmar, Xie's son fell ill and died there. Feeling inconvenienced by being alone and being advanced in age, he greatly desired an assistant. Subsequently, Master Shoushi of Fayuan Temple in Beijing introduced him (Mr. Tan referring to himself) to go with him. In early November of last year, while crossing the Himalayas, Xie became ill. After traveling for more than 20 days, the Dalai Lama in Lhasa heard the news and sent people to greet them. One day before arriving in Lhasa, Mr. Xie died of his serious illness. After arriving in Lhasa, the Dalai Lama had a deep old friendship with Xie, so the funeral was held with great ceremony. After Xie's death, I was responsible for the investigation and conveying the intentions of the central government. I stayed in Lhasa for about three months. Due to the inconvenience of transportation and being secretly monitored by the guards sent by the Dalai Lama, I did not travel elsewhere. On February 15th, I left Lhasa and on March 13th, I returned to Calcutta in India. I traveled in India for two months. On May 18th, I returned to Yangon in Myanmar. On June 1st, I left Yangon, on the 13th, I arrived in Hong Kong, and on the 16th, I transferred to a ship to Shanghai, arriving on the 20th. I am now scheduled to take the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Nanjing on the morning of the 25th or tomorrow evening to report to the National Government, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Political Overview <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Tibetan side has no politics to speak of. The Tibetans are superstitious about lamas, so politics and religion are not separate. Political power is entirely in the hands of the lamas, hence the name "monastic politics." The person currently in power is the Dalai Lama, who resides in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. His power is vast and unrestricted by law. He can do whatever he wants. Beneath the Dalai Lama is the Tibetan King, but this is an official position in name only and is also the Dalai Lama's nephew. Below the King are four "Kalons" (meaning ministers). The four Kalons also do not have separate responsibilities, they merely execute all orders of the Dalai Lama. Before 1922, Tibet was ruled by the Dalai Lama, and Tibet was ruled by the Panchen Lama, who resided in Xigaze. Now that the Panchen has been expelled, both Tibet are ruled by the Dalai Lama.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Military Situation <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>In military affairs, Tibet had no formally trained army in the past. However, in recent years, influenced by the world's scientific advancement, a formal army organization has begun. However, their numbers are still not large, with an estimated total of just over 6,000 soldiers. The person in charge of these forces, according to the Tibetan term, is a Director-General. Below him are thirteen "Daizhang," meaning thirteen battalions. Each Daizhang has approximately 500 soldiers. In addition, there are civilian soldiers and lama soldiers who can be mobilized or recruited at any time, similar to a conscription system, with national reserves and auxiliary forces. The source of their military equipment is mostly from England, India, Japan, Russia, and other places. Although Lhasa, the capital, also has a machinery bureau, it is small in scale and can produce only twenty or thirty rifles each year. Within its internal organization, there is only one Han Chinese as an engineer who also teaches Tibetans how to manufacture firearms.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Transportation Facilities <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>In transportation, travel is very inconvenient due to the mountainous terrain of Tibet. Other than the railway set up by the British in Darjeeling that reaches Yatung in Tibet, there are no other railways, post offices, telegraph offices, etc. Except for the route from Lhasa to Gyantse, which belongs to Tibet, and from Gyantse to the Indian border, which belongs to Britain, the rest of the region has no postal or telecommunications facilities. Official documents and correspondence are still transmitted in the same way as the ancient post station system. There is now a long-distance telephone line from Lhasa to Gyantse and then to Yatung. Its jurisdiction is the same as the post and telegraph.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Commercial Situation <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Aside from those Tibetans who devoutly believe in lamas, shave their heads to become monks, and engage in nomadic life, few engage in commerce. Therefore, the majority of its commercial power still belongs to people from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, especially Muslims, who mainly deal in tea and silk. Although Indians occasionally engage in the tea business, Tibetans generally do not welcome them, as they are accustomed to drinking Chinese tea. The British have no economic power in Tibet. The goods imported from India are mostly cloth, furniture, kerosene, and alcohol, while the exports are wool, cowhide, musk, etc. The central government has no customs collection facilities in Tibet. However, in the Pagri region, the Dalai Lama has set up a taxation agency that only collects export taxes and not import taxes.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Strange Customs <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Tibetans still hold deep superstitions. Many men prefer to become lamas. Those who do not shave their heads to become monks often have several brothers sharing one wife. This affects the ethnicity. Funerals are divided into four types: sky, earth, water, and fire. Sky burial is the most common, where the corpse is dissected with sharp knives and then transported to remote mountains or wilderness to be eaten by birds and beasts. Earth burial is rare, only used for those who die from epidemics or infectious diseases. Water burial is mainly for the poor who cannot afford other options. Fire burial is exclusively for lamas. Regarding clothing, officials often wear old Qing Dynasty official attire. In terms of diet, they mainly eat tsampa mixed with butter. Tsampa is roasted barley flour mixed with butter and tea, called butter tea. Mr. Tan said that this item has a good flavor. When I was in Tibet, I used it as a substitute for rice. I also liked to eat it. While speaking, he showed the reporter tsampa flour.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Other Recent News <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>When I was in Lhasa, the Xikang war had already broken out. The cause was the trivial matter reported in the newspapers. If one only looks at the Dalai Lama's attitude, it seems good on the surface. However, he secretly harbors the ambition to exclusively control all of Tibet and Xikang. However, observing the general public's sentiment, they all lean towards the central government and hope that the national government will have appropriate measures to connect them with the country. As for the rumors that there are British people instructing them, according to my personal observation, this may not be true. The British have no significant power in Tibet. The Dalai Lama is good at using them. The British troops in Tibet are only fifty in Yatung and fifty in Gyantse, and they are not purely British troops, mostly Nepalese troops. Their economic power is also very weak, only the goods imported from India as described above. Although the annual trade volume is not known for sure, judging from the general situation, the number is not very large.</p>
<p>The Revival of the Chinese Domestic Goods Market is Near</p>
<h3 id="e176">### Yang Zhao Yun's Protest Results <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>After the closure of the Chinese Domestic Goods Market, Yang Zhao Yun, the president of the Special District Local Court, repeatedly questioned the Public Works Department (工部局) and personally visited Fei Xindun (費信惇), the supervisor of the Public Works Department, to protest and requested that they must handle matters according to legal procedures in the future. Now, we have obtained two recent letters between the court and the Public Works Department, which are hereby disclosed. Since the Public Works Department has the sincerity to resolve this case and acknowledges that the previous measures were due to misunderstanding and expressed regret, the date of the Chinese Domestic Goods Market's reopening should not be far away. (Public Letter from the Shanghai Special District Local Court) Dear Sirs, regarding the case of your department instructing the police to forcibly close the Chinese Domestic Products United Market, this court sent a letter on June 12 inquiring about the details of the matter, but has not yet received a reply. Now, the United Market has submitted a petition stating that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, due to the entertainment section's equipment issues, did not file a suit with this court for a hearing and judgment beforehand, but abruptly sent police to order the suspension of business and sealed off the entire market, prohibiting employees from entering and exiting, which is illegal and exceeds their authority, requesting relief. If the entertainment section of the market violates the regulations, it is a violation of regulations and should be litigated to this court for clarification and handling according to the law. Now that your department has closed the market without going through this procedure, it is difficult to consider it legal. Accordingly, we request your department to investigate and order the complete withdrawal of the police guarding the market, allowing the market to operate as usual. If there are legal issues, your department's representative lawyer can still file a lawsuit with this court according to the law, and this court will naturally handle it according to the law. In the future, if there are similar incidents, please still follow the legal procedures to avoid disputes and clarify jurisdictions. We also hope to receive a reply. Sincerely, Yang Zhao Yun, President of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department. (Reply from the Public Works Department) Dear Sir, received your letter of June 22, regarding the Chinese Domestic Goods Market, requesting that this court follow legal procedures for cases of violation of regulations, as per usual practice. There are many misunderstandings in this case, which is truly unfortunate. Now, representatives of our department and the Domestic Goods Market have negotiated and agreed on appropriate measures to handle the aftermath with careful consideration. Sincerely, Fei Xindun, Supervisor of the Public Works Department, to Yang, President of the Shanghai Special District Local Court. June 23.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Committee Letter Requesting Assistance <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Products Market Negotiation Committee sent letters to various assistance groups yesterday, stating: Respectfully, the Chinese National Products United Market was abruptly illegally closed by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession on June 9, and the various unfortunate incidents of assaulting and arresting employees are presumably well-known. We are deeply grateful for the righteous assistance of the members of your esteemed association. The most essential part of the negotiation process is that on June 19 and 20, Mr. Yu Qiaqing (虞洽卿) notified representatives from both sides to talk at the City Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Wang Xiaolai (王曉籟), in his capacity as temporary chairman, certified that the reports of the representatives from our association, Hong Yan (洪雁), Li Weicheng (李維城), and Chen Weixin (陳維新), were completely true, and recognized that the Public Works Department's closure of the market in batches was a major mistake, which shows that justice will eventually triumph over power. Now, our association has separately sent letters to our government regarding the Public Works Department's violation of the agreement and infringement of legal rights, raising protests, and has also decided on seven measures to seriously negotiate with the Public Works Department to protect the safety of Chinese taxpayers. We are immensely grateful.</p>

<p>The National Products Market Negotiation Committee decided to send committee member Dong Ousun (董歐蓀) to the Lawyers Association today to prepare for legal negotiations regarding the illegal arrest and assault of market employees by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession. Chairman Zhang Zilian (張子廉) was also elected to go to Beijing within days to appeal. In addition, all the manufacturers in the market and all the employees of the entertainment and business departments have been unable to find a concrete solution since the market was illegally closed by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession on June 9, which is already half a month ago. It was specifically decided to hold a general meeting in the Daxijing (大京班) hall of the market at 10:00 AM today to discuss future methods for dealing with the Public Works Department and the livelihood issues of employees and manufacturers.</p>

<p>Talks by Responsible Personnel from the City Finance Bureau</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th), it was reported that the City Finance Bureau would implement measures to deal with Japanese residents who resist paying taxes, stating that if Japanese residents do not pay property taxes beyond the deadline, the water supply would be cut off. Reporters from various newspapers specially visited the responsible personnel in charge of the bureau regarding this matter. According to the response, the case of Japanese residents in Pudong not paying city property taxes is still under negotiation and has not yet reached the stage of strict enforcement. Furthermore, the president of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce had already conveyed to the Finance Bureau yesterday that the Japanese residents in Pudong have agreed to pay property taxes and are only waiting for the various Japanese companies to consult with their head offices in Japan and receive a reply before they can pay accordingly. Approximately, this case can be completely resolved within two or three weeks, they said.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Communist Zhang Qian Arrested <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Subversive Publications Found</p>
<p>Accomplices Not Captured</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM the night before last, detectives from the Putuo Road police station arrested a man named Zhang Yimin (張逸民) on Robison Road. Zhang is from Hubei. According to his own statement, his real name is Zhang Qian (張潛), 32 years old. Yimin is his alias to avoid attention. He holds some kind of position in the Third District Committee established by the Communist Party in Hubei, with a monthly salary of 30 yuan. He was sent to Shanghai for secret activities two months ago, residing at No. 111 Kangnuotuo Road in the Chinese area. The 200 subversive leaflets he carried were ordered by an accomplice named Luo to be brought to Robison Road and handed over to someone wearing a woolen scarf. However, he waited for a long time and did not see that person. He heard that Luo is currently residing in Wuding Lane, Wuding Road. The police chief immediately ordered detectives to search Zhang's residence. Under Zhang's bed, they found two subversive publications, "Road to Light" and "International Monthly," and a letter. They then went to Luo's residence, but Luo had already escaped beforehand. The search yielded nothing else. Yesterday morning, Zhang was escorted to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Judge Gao held a court session for interrogation. After the police lawyer presented the case, detectives Zhang Youming (張有明) and Zhao Fuhai (趙福海), and Western detective Hua Tuo, successively reported the process of capturing the defendant and submitted the leaflets, books, and letter to the court for review. Zhang Qian, when questioned, reversed the statements he made at the police station, saying that he came to Shanghai from Hubei this time to apply for admission to Jiangnan School, and that the leaflets he had found on the road, and the books in his residence belonged to a friend named Zhuang. Judge Gao then ordered the defendant to be remanded and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>83 Bixun Road, French Concession</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reported that Minister of Finance Song Ziwen (宋子文) found his private residence at 203 Juperlais Road in the French Concession too small and unsuitable for living. He came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning at 7:00 AM and entrusted the Shanghai Moving Company to move all the furniture to 83 Bixun Road in the French Concession. It is found that the house is the property of the Jianghai Customs, formerly occupied by Mei Weiliang (梅維亮) of the Shanghai Customs. Now that Mei has been transferred to the Qingdao Customs, his family has also moved to Qingdao, and the house has become vacant. Since the house has many rooms and the area in front of the door is surrounded by lush trees, creating shady lanes and fresh air, which is suitable for residential hygiene, Song has moved his private residence there.</p>

<p>Tang Huixuan (唐惠玄), a doctor of economics, previously reported to the police that his wife, Zou Aizhen (鄒愛貞), had an affair with Chen Genwei (陳根偉), and the police were dispatched to arrest Zou and Chen and send them to the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate for investigation. Zou immediately filed a lawsuit against Tang for bigamy and false accusation. The lawsuit between them has lasted for nearly a year, and the newspapers have broadcast it, and society has talked and laughed about it. Now, Zou Aizhen's request for divorce from Tang Huixuan is still in progress at the Shanghai District Court. Tang has moved to the Public Concession, so he did not appear in court within the city. He also hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an (袁仰安) to file another petition with the Special District Court, requesting mediation for divorce and asking Zou to hand over the two children born to them so that he could take them back to raise. The mediation petition stated that Tang Huixuan married Zou Aizhen in the United States in October of the Republic of China Year 12. At that time, Tang was a professor in the United States. In Year 15, Zou returned to China first with their two children because she was weak after childbirth and lacked care. Tang gave Zou approximately $4,000 USD, earned from years of hard work, to take back. After arriving in Shanghai, Zou lived with her mother and sister on Zhonghua Road and purchased land in Longhua. The remaining funds were deposited in the bank. The following year, Tang returned to Shanghai from the United States and lived with Zou, with affection as before. Later, Tang went out to work and was separated from her from time to time. Then, a person named Chen Genwei falsely recognized Zou's mother as his godmother and was able to live with Aizhen, and an affair occurred. In August of the year before last, Tang returned from a business trip and felt that Zou's attitude towards him had completely changed and that she was becoming increasingly intimate with Chen. He knew there was something wrong, but out of years of love, he couldn't bear to break off with her abruptly and tried to persuade her to repent gently. Later, he left Shanghai again to work, continuously sending more than 3,000 yuan for living expenses. Last summer, he returned from Guangdong, but Zou refused to live with him and behaved as if she was a couple with Chen, which was truly unbearable. He reported to the First Section of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the police were dispatched to Zou's house to arrest Zou and Chen and hand them over to the Shanghai District Court for repeated interrogations. Later, Tang followed advice and withdrew the charges, while Aizhen sued Tang for bigamy and false accusation. As a result, the judgment was rejected, and the lawsuit ended. Tang once visited Zou's house on Zhonghua Road, but did not meet with Aizhen. However, Aizhen at this time filed a petition with the court for divorce from Tang. When the court was convened, Tang had moved to the Public Concession and had not received the summons and did not appear. He also wanted to meet Aizhen and see the children, so he sent a letter to Zou's lawyer asking for her address, but he did not receive a reply. Now, it has been learned that Aizhen has moved from Zhonghua Road to 1269 Lafayette Road. Tang does not know who the house belongs to and is not in a position to visit casually. However, because Aizhen had previously committed adultery and then falsely accused him, their relationship is over, and it is impossible for them to be husband and wife again. Tang is willing to sacrifice all the property he has left with Aizhen, but only asks to be granted a divorce to relieve his mental pain. Aizhen has another love, so it will be difficult for her to fulfill her maternal duties to the two children, and she should also be asked to hand them over to Tang for guardianship. Both parties want a divorce, and the goal seems to be the same, but they have filed lawsuits in two courts, and the jurisdiction is questionable. It is expected that there will be a debate on this issue when the court opens in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Pudong Will Have Tap Water <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Water Plant...Under Preparation</p>
<p>Artesian Well...Under Construction</p>
<p>The Laiyidu area of Pudong is gradually developing, and the residents' drinking water is either transported from the Huangpu River or drawn from the soil wells, which is unsanitary and often causes epidemics. In view of this, the municipal government has ordered the municipal public works bureau to prepare a tap water plant with funds of more than 200,000 yuan. It has been reported that the bureau has surveyed the area of Taoyuan Residence on Youlong Road, Laiyidu, as the site of the plant and is currently acquiring private land for construction. However, the construction of the water plant will take at least one year. In order to respond to the urgent need, the bureau has also submitted a request to the municipal government to first drill an artesian well on the vacant land opposite No. 106 Laiyidu Main Street. The project has been contracted to the Tianyuan Machine Drilling Bureau for 2,600 yuan, and a license has been issued for construction to begin. For the water plant, it is planned to first build a water tower, which has also been priced separately by various manufacturers, so that when the well drilling project is completed in the future, the well water can be pumped into the tower first and then sent to users to supply water.</p>

<p>Ferry Fees Confiscated...Additional Fine Levied</p>
<p>Liu Shiqi (劉士琦), the ferry operator of Tanjiadu in the Wusong River, had previously been approved by the Municipal Public Works Bureau to increase the ferry fee from one copper coin to two copper coins per passenger. However, from February 10 of this year, he illegally increased the fee to four copper coins per passenger. The local residents then reported to the Public Works Bureau, requesting severe punishment. The bureau sent personnel to investigate and found that the ferry operator was ignoring orders and increasing the burden on the public, which was hateful. With the approval of the municipal government, the ferry operator was ordered to confiscate all the illegally increased ferry fees from February 10 to May 21, calculated at 15,000 copper coins per day, for a total of 515 yuan, and to pay an additional fine of 50 yuan, which will be submitted to the bureau and transferred to the municipal treasury as a warning to others.</p>

<p>License Suspended for Three Months Due to Violations</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau found that the Minghua Water Pipe Engineering Company had repeatedly undertaken water supply equipment installations in new buildings in the First District of the Public Security Bureau and the aircraft manufacturing plant in the Jiangnan Shipyard without first reporting to the Inland Water Company for water connection, which was a violation. In addition, the use of cardboard instead of rubber for the water pipe joint fasteners was even more inappropriate. Furthermore, the owner of the store, Yang Yaonan (楊耀南), was working at the Shanghai Water Company and had no time to take care of the store's affairs, allowing employees to work illegally outside, causing endless harm. It is reported that the bureau will impose a three-month suspension of the license in accordance with the city's water supply regulations. During this period, the company is not allowed to operate in the city. The company has now complied.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Reasons for Delay of Pinghu Ferry <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Due to Mutiny of the Xincang Local Defense Corps</p>
<p>The early ferries running between Pinghu and Shanghai, according to regulations, should have departed from Pinghu at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 24th) - the Shanghai-Pinghu company's ferry, and at 9:00 AM - the Minnan company's ferry. However, neither ferry had arrived in Shanghai by those times. The two companies were worried about accidents along the way and were about to call Pinghu to inquire. Just then, the Shanghai-Pinghu company received a telegram from the Pinghu company reporting that yesterday (the 23rd), in Xincang Town, about two miles from Pinghu, a mutiny of the local defense corps occurred, with approximately four to five hundred people. They wantonly looted and harassed, and most fled via the Zhapu sea route, while a small part scattered. The authorities, in order to search for the mutinous soldiers, ordered the ferries to temporarily suspend operations. It was said that the two Pinghu ferries were scheduled to depart for Shanghai simultaneously at 11:00 AM. Later, in the afternoon, the ferries of the two companies arrived in Shanghai simultaneously. According to passengers, the delayed departure was due to the Xincang mutiny.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Failed Robbery Disguised as Holiday Gift-Giving <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Female Thief Confesses Details</p>
<p>Male Thief Ding Amao Also Arrested</p>
<p>At Hu Baoli's residence, number 23, Third Tai Wharf, South City, in February of this year, a group of bandits suddenly arrived. Among them was a woman who, under the pretext of delivering a holiday gift, attempted to enter and rob the house, but failed. The detectives of the First District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered that the female thief in this case was named Zhao Xiaomei, and she was currently hiding in a small inn on Baochang Road in the French Concession. They went to the address the day before yesterday and arrested the female thief Zhao Xiaomei. During the preliminary interrogation, Zhao Xiaomei, also known as Hainü, confessed that she was 29 years old, from Zhenjiang, and previously lived at the Youche Wharf in the South City. In October of last year, she met Ding Amao, who lived in Xuejiabang in the South City, on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. Later, as they were attracted to each other, they stayed together for several nights in the Changfa Inn. Amao had many friends he knew outside, including one named A Lin, who lived near Xieqiao outside the West Gate, and a short man with the surname Zhang who lived in Pudong. These two often came to the inn to play. Around December of the lunar calendar last year, they moved to the Tianfa Inn. A man surnamed Wu, with pockmarks on his face, came to the inn with an unfamiliar person. Wu suggested that as the end of the year was approaching, they were burdened with debts and needed to find a way to get through it. He said that he had learned that Hu Baoli's family at Third Tai Wharf had considerable savings, and they might as well go there together to do some "business" to find a way out. Everyone agreed at the time. So, at about 2:00 PM on the 24th of that month (i.e., in February of this year), they gathered at the 16th Pier in the South City. There were seven people, including Zhao, Amao, Wu Mapi, and Big Head. Because Amao knew too many people in the South City, he did not go with them. Wu Pima wore a short blue cloth shirt, tied a cloth apron around his waist, and carried two pistols. At that time, Zhao first bought a basket of oranges at a fruit shop for one yuan and a box of sponge cakes at a candy store for four jiao and took them to Hu's house. Unexpectedly, after entering, just as they were about to start, they were suddenly discovered, so in a hurry, they threw the oranges and cakes into Hu's courtyard, then exited the gate and ran away</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>They fled to Dongjiadu and took a car back to the inn. They then went to the address to arrest Ding Amao. He confessed that he was 31 years old, from Ningbo, and worked as a tea boy on the Xinjiangtian steamboat. His testimony was the same as Zhao Xiaomei's. Because the case involved robbery, they were ordered to prepare documents and transfer them to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Trial of the Ren Zhennan Fraud Case <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>In the case of lawyer Ren Zhennan, who was accused of fraud by Zhuang Chunpu, the local court filed a public prosecution. Ren hired lawyers Jin Yu and Xue Jiaqi for defense. When Zhuang Chunpu was accused of bigamy by his mistress Wang Lianxiang in the French court and entrusted the defendant, it was stipulated that the public fees were two hundred taels of silver, and it was stated that there would be no other additional demands. The defendant made defenses and appeared in court several times, but Zhuang did not appear in court. It was the fourth court hearing, and Zhuang did not appear in court several times. Zhuang hesitated at first, and the defendant strongly advised him because of the court's prestige. He reluctantly appeared in court and was ordered to pay a bail of 20,000 yuan and be held in custody without bail. His wife, Zhuang Li, blamed the defendant for not having urged her husband to appear in court beforehand and demanded a refund of the public fee, which was refused. A week later, she pleaded with the court to reduce the bail to 10,000 taels. After leaving the court, Zhuang Li pressed the defendant to find a guarantor, but he had no such responsibility and refused. A few days later, she invited hooligans to the office to make trouble, demanding 5,000 yuan in compensation for reputational damage, threatening that they could take people away and bring them back. They reported to the police before leaving. The witnesses she cited, Qian Yumin and others, were her relatives and could not have the value of witnesses. A check for 500 yuan borrowed from Han Tianmin and described by Qian Yumin was a Shanghai Bank check, but the investigation court inquired with Shanghai Bank and found no account names related to anyone in this case, which was obviously a lie. They requested to be found innocent. The case was handled by Judge Qian Chengjun of the Criminal Court. He immediately subpoenaed and opened the fifth court hearing at 2:00 PM yesterday. The official asked Ren Zhennan, who confessed that he was 24 years old, from Guangdong, lived at 16 Beile Road, graduated from Aurora University, returned from studying in France, and registered as a lawyer in June of last year. He asked if he knew Zhuang Chunpu and Zhuang Li. He answered that he did not know them before. He asked who came to ask for a lawsuit. He answered that Qian Yumin asked Gu Gongda to ask for it. He asked what was the matter. He answered that a mistress Wang Lianxiang hired lawyer Zheng Yuxiu to sue for bigamy in the French court. He had already hired lawyer Fei Xizhen and asked me to appear in court. The public fee was 200 taels. He asked if there was another 500 taels of public fee. He answered no. He asked if there was a settlement of 4,500 yuan. He answered no. He asked where the 200 taels were paid. He answered that there was a receipt in the office. He appeared in court twice in February, once in March, and recently once. He asked which day Zhuang Chunpu was detained. He answered the third court. He asked why he was suing him. He answered that because he did not appear in court twice, and the third time he was persuaded to go to court and was detained, he resented me and framed me. At this point, he asked Zhuang Li, who confessed that she was 40 years old, from Ningbo, her husband Zhuang Chunpu was a land broker, lived at 10 Guangyuli, Qialu Road, and Wang Lianxiang was his mistress. He asked if they were still mistresses. She answered no. Later, she filed a lawsuit in court. He asked what she accused him of. She answered abuse. He asked what else. She answered that she didn't know. He asked how she knew Ren Zhennan. She answered that Qian Yumin and Gu Gongda introduced her. He asked which day. She answered February 9. He asked where. She answered the China Hotel. He asked why she didn't go to the office to hire a lawyer, but went to the hotel. She answered that Qian Yumin saw Ren Zhennan in the China Hotel on the 10th. Her husband, herself, Qian, and Gu were all present. Gu said the lawyer could settle the matter, so on February 12, he first paid 500 taels, then 1,000 yuan in banknotes for the first time, 3,000 yuan in banknotes for the second time, and a 500 yuan check for the third time, totaling 4,500 yuan. He asked what it was for. She answered that it was said that lawyer Zheng wanted 4,500 yuan for settlement fees. He asked where the money came from. She answered that it was borrowed from friends, pawned, and mortgaged. He asked if the third payment was a Shanghai Bank check. She answered yes, it was borrowed from Qian Yumin. He asked why she wanted to go to the Ningbo Fellow Association to sue. She answered that she was afraid her husband would be detained. He asked when her husband was detained. She answered February 13 of the lunar calendar. The official said that today's case was slightly inquired about, and a further trial will be conducted for verification. He ordered both parties to leave.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Detective Team Captures Nine Bandits <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Public Security Bureau detectives Jiang Jinxiang, Zhang Jinzhou, Han Jingxiang, Zhang Shaoming, Wang Zian, Gao Zihua, Zhang Yingpin, Wu Zuowen, Ning detective Zhang Ruizhi, Zhao Huai'en, Zhang Mingxiang, female detective Xia Xiuying, etc., were inspecting pedestrians in the 16th Pier area at about 10:00 AM yesterday. When they checked near the entrance of Tie Mao Nong, they suddenly noticed more than ten burly men sitting in the Tianbao Garden teahouse, gathered around a table drinking tea. When they saw the detectives, they all looked flustered, and their behavior became more suspicious. The detectives rushed in and checked them. No prohibited items were found on the people present. Finally, a loaded pistol, seven bullets, and a magazine were suddenly found on the stool where one person was sitting. They arrested the men, totaling nine, and immediately took them back to the team. Captain Lu interrogated them one by one. The person carrying the pistol confessed that his name was Liu Zijin, and the others confessed that their names were Li Chunhe, Wang Xiaosizi, Yang Yougen, Chen Yongyuan, Wang Changzhen, Su Chaojiang, Zhu Jifu, and Liu Wanfu. Among them, Liu Zijin, Li Chunhe, and Wang Xiaosizi directly admitted that they were invited by their accomplice Kong Laosi to rob the piglet merchants coming to Shanghai from Jiang'an. After Captain Lu obtained the confession, he ordered the original detectives to step up the pursuit of Kong Laosi, the leader. He also submitted the situation to Director Chen, who praised the team leader for his effective leadership in repeatedly solving kidnapping and robbery cases in recent days, in order to encourage them in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Demolition of the Tall Flagpole in the Temple of the Queen of Heaven <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>In the Temple of the Queen of Heaven on North Henan Road in this city, there used to be a pair of tall flagpoles. Now, due to years of decay, the whole body is shaking, and it is about to destroy houses and injure people. The Third District Party Department of this city believes that these flagpoles are remnants of the feudal system, and they are fundamentally shaking. Demolition is necessary to eliminate bad habits and ensure safety. Therefore, on the 15th of last month, they submitted a report to the Municipal Executive Committee, which forwarded it to the Municipal Government for demolition. Then, the Municipal Government and the Municipal Public Works Bureau jointly sent personnel to the temple to inspect and also agreed that it should be demolished. Therefore, on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 22nd), they sent personnel to lead craftsmen to demolish the flagpole.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Conviction for Forced Confession of Theft <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yougen, a cook at Tongchang Restaurant at 423 Zhabu Road, suddenly wore new shoes and socks. When he delivered food to the Central Leather Shoe Store on North Sichuan Road, the store owner found 57 yuan missing from the drawer of the account table. During a strict investigation, he saw that Xu's shoes and socks were new and suspected that Xu had stolen the money. He threatened him to a secluded place, used private torture, and forced him to write a confession of theft. Afterwards, Xu filed a complaint through his employer to the police station, who arrested the shoe store owner Zhang Sansan and the accomplices Shen Hehai, Zhu Axiao, and the suspect Zhou Qifa, and sent them to the Special District Local Court. The fortune teller who wrote the confession was summoned to testify. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng opened the court and sentenced Shen Hehai to eight months in prison, Zhu Axiao to six months in prison, and the confession was confiscated. Zhang and Zhou were acquitted and released.</p>

It is estimated that it will take about a month to complete. As for the total amount of income and expenditure, according to the budget for the 18th year, the total income of the city is about 7 million yuan, and the expenditure is about 6.5 million yuan. However, in fact, since the Municipal Government has reorganized various tax revenues, the income has exceeded the budget for the 18th year. However, the expenditure also cannot but exceed the budget of 6.5 million yuan due to the increase in prices of all construction materials and temporary payments, etc. However, the comparison of the two items of income and expenditure is roughly offset, with little profit or loss. As for the budget for the 20th year, it is now being submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. It is expected that the income for the 20th year will again… the amount can reach about 8 million yuan. On the expenditure side, it must be determined after the Executive Yuan approves it. The saying that the budget income for the 20th year is more than 6.5 million yuan and the expenditure is more than 7.6 million yuan is completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Huangpu Bridge Construction <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the construction of a bridge over the Huangpu River, the sponsors have repeatedly requested approval from the Municipal Government. Recently, they have also sent draft contracts for review. But in principle, the government should support the people's initiation of bridge construction. However, whether there is a need to build a bridge over the Huangpu River, the financial resources for bridge construction, and whether the soil on the east and west banks is suitable for bridge construction are all very important. Moreover, the Municipal Public Works Bureau's ferry system has gradually become complete. Whether it is really necessary to build another bridge, the Municipal Government has always held a cautious principle on this issue. In addition to sending personnel for detailed investigation, whether to approve it will be submitted to the Municipal Affairs Conference for detailed discussion and decision within days.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Silk Industry Hopes for Early Issuance of Public Bonds <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Although the 8 million yuan Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry public bond has been promulgated and implemented, it has been delayed due to unresolved distribution issues. Silk factories generally believe that this public bond is issued to rescue the silk industry. Now that the actual benefits of the rescue have not been obtained, and the factories have already exported, the Jianghai Customs has levied a special tax of 30 yuan per dan from the 20th of last month to be allocated to the public bond fund. In that case, the factories have suffered harm before receiving benefits. As the new silk is on the market, the work of each factory should be intensified. Now, due to the lack of both funds and raw materials, they have been suspended one after another. Last time, when the spring cocoons were on the market, the public bonds could not meet the urgent needs. Now that the summer cocoons in Zhejiang are about to be launched, there is still no definite date for the issuance of public bonds. Therefore, there is widespread resentment. The other day, the manufacturers all questioned Chairman Shen of the Shanghai Silk Factory Association, leaving Shen speechless. While they were questioning, they suddenly received a notice from the Special Committee for Relief Public Bonds, stating that the Fifth Committee Meeting would be held on the 29th of this month (i.e., Monday) at the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to discuss the fundamental solution for public bonds. Chairman Shen promised to discuss the matter with the members at the due date and issue the bonds earlier.</p>

<p>Petitioning the National Government to Reject the Requests of Liu Xiang and Others</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai recently stated that the Sichuan Post-War Supervisor Liu Xiang requested to issue 20 million yuan of Sichuan Post-War Public Bonds, and the Sichuan Provincial Government Chairman Liu Wenhui requested to issue 20 million yuan of Sichuan Provincial Public Bonds, which the people could not afford. They raised objections. On the one hand, they petitioned the National Government to reject the requests of the two Lius. On the other hand, they telegraphed the two Lius, asking them to withdraw the concluded agreement, and telegraphed all agencies, organizations, and Sichuan fellow associations abroad to oppose it. The reasons are as follows: (1) Sichuan has suffered severe disasters in recent years, and commerce has also been depressed. People are displaced and suffering, and they cannot afford this heavy public debt. (2) Although the two Lius claim that the issuance of public bonds is for post-war reconstruction, in fact, there is no legitimate use, but to create civil wars in Sichuan, and the people have no obligation to bear it. (3) The two Lius have the most defense zones in Sichuan and have plundered a lot. Since they do not reduce tariffs and raise funds freely, the military and political expenses are not insufficient. Why do they still need to issue public bonds? (4) The stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol tax raised are used to offset the public bond fund. In fact, the tax revenue in the defense zone of the two Lius is not much, and it has already been used as a pledge when borrowing from the people. The fund is not much. (5) If the public bonds requested by the two Lius are approved, the Sichuan armies will inevitably follow the example. If the central government does not approve, they will also issue them freely, and the people will be unbearable. The full text is more than two thousand words, and the narration is very detailed.</p>

<h3 id="e215">The Truth about the Merger of the Zhaoshang Bureau Navigation School <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Talk by Secretary Bao Gongfan</p>
<p>Recently, it was heard that the Navigation School run by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was to be merged into the Wusong Merchant Marine School. The students of the school were quite alarmed and had a school protection movement. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency went to the Bureau yesterday to visit Secretary Bao Gongfan. According to his talk, the content of this matter is quite detailed. The summary is recorded as follows: Wei Jun said that when Commissioner Guo took office, he had no intention of closing the navigation school. Later, after carefully examining the contents of the school, the academic equipment, and the training of talents, he found that they were not very complete, and it was not registered. The fundamental position was very empty. After the students graduated and went out to serve, whether there would be no difficulty in obtaining a license from the Ministry was still questionable. Therefore, Commissioner Guo, out of consideration for the students' technical training and service prospects, had the intention of merging with the Wusong Merchant Marine School. The navigation students will have to board ships and take on the responsibility of driving, and bear the heavy responsibility of the lives and property of the whole ship. All countries in England and Japan are very serious about running this school and do not allow any shortcomings. In case of rough manufacturing, the students themselves are also very dangerous and not only delay the shipping industry. The Wusong Merchant Marine School was originally run by the old Ministry of Communications of Beiping. Many graduates of the school served in the Bureau, and many have been promoted to shipowners. The achievements are still excellent. In the autumn of the 18th year, the school was restored and was of national nature. The old scale was still there, and the funds were taken from the tonnage tax fees of various shipping companies, so there was no shortage of funds. Therefore, the management was quite perfect. The merger of the Bureau School into the school is the most appropriate. It is very convenient for students' academics and future service and licensing. It is heard that the Bureau has strongly requested a merger in the first session last year. The motivation was due to this. However, the students oppose the merger. The reason is that the students must pay fees uniformly after the merger, and it will be difficult to find a way out in the future. But they do not know that ship service must be based on skills and licenses as a prerequisite. Those who graduate from the Bureau School but are not proficient in skills and have incomplete licenses, even if they want to be cited, are allowed by law. On the contrary, those who graduate from merchant ships and meet the conditions will still be cited and sent to the students of the Bureau for the recruitment of talents. There is no distinction between internal and external barriers. In addition, the problem of following the internship, etc., within a school, there is no reason for two kinds of treatment. Moreover, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is now a state-owned agency, and it is easy to blend in with the Ministry of Communications. The Bureau has already submitted a plan to the National Government for approval. How should it be handled in the future, and it must be decided after the approval is returned. However, Commissioner Guo will definitely plan for the students' aftermath.</p>

<p>Nanjing Mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen Construction Office Director, Mr. Xia Guangyu, is a senior figure in our country's engineering field. Recently, it was reported that his name was listed among the founders of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, and he was even elected as a director. He specifically sent a letter of refusal and also wrote to the Chinese Engineering Society, stating everything. The original letter is recorded below: Respectfully, Guangyu participated in the Chinese Institute of Engineers as a member and initiated the merger of the Chinese Engineering Society and the Chinese Engineering Society. The merger was unanimously approved by both societies, and I was also recommended as one of the drafting committee members for the new constitution of the merged society. I am currently working hard with representatives from both societies to ensure the early establishment of the new society. However, some friends in Shanghai have newly formed a Chinese Institute of Engineers without obtaining Guangyu's consent beforehand. They mistakenly used fabricated information. Guangyu has already sent a special letter to the association, stating the reasons and resigning from both membership and directorship. Now, I am enclosing a copy of the original letter for your review and request that it be published in the society's journal to dispel your doubts. I would be most grateful. Respectfully addressed to the Chinese Engineering Society, Xia Guangyu.</p>

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e228">Fei Tang Report, Volume II (8th Installment) <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Abstract Translation of Parts Four and Five</p>
<p>The report also mentions the issue between the Municipal Council and the National Government regarding the exercise of the right to collect taxes in the International Settlement, as well as the agreements concluded between the Municipal Council, representing the National Government, for the implementation of the Stamp Tax Ordinance and the Consolidated Tobacco Tax Ordinance in the International Settlement. These two agreements have led to a satisfactory resolution of all long-standing difficulties concerning the collection of taxes. The sole basis for this resolution is the mutual recognition by the National Government and the International Settlement Municipal Council of their legitimate interests. Taxes legally collected by the National Government elsewhere, if they are collected in the International Settlement, should not infringe upon or interfere with the Municipal Council's right to collect taxes under the Land Regulations. The existence of the International Settlement should not prevent the National Government from collecting such taxes in the International Settlement. On the other hand, if the Municipal Council's position in exercising its own taxing powers is not impaired, and its administrative powers in the International Settlement can also be effectively guaranteed, then the issue of applying any tax ordinances to the residents of the International Settlement must be determined by the Municipal Council in consultation with the relevant Chinese authorities. If an agreement is reached to apply such ordinances, then the taxes collected in the International Settlement in accordance with the ordinance should be collected by members of the Municipal Council and not by external agents. The fact that agreements of this nature can be concluded for the two taxes mentioned above seems to indicate that the tax issues that have caused so much difficulty in the past now have a good prospect of being resolved. The following recommendations are made for the future: (1) The functions of the Municipal Council. A. The general and exclusive nature of the International Settlement Municipal Council's administrative powers should be defined in comprehensive and clear terms. B. In addition to the general powers granted by Article 11 of the Land Regulations, which allow the Municipal Council to enact by-laws "to improve the administration and ensure better order," the Municipal Council must also have the power to enact by-laws specifically for the implementation of all or part of Chinese laws and regulations within the International Settlement. However, these laws and regulations may be restricted in accordance with the clear needs of the International Settlement's special circumstances. (2) Approval of the by-laws enacted by the Municipal Council. Organize a new body, including: A. Representatives of the consuls of the countries stationed in Shanghai; and B. Personnel appointed by the Chinese government, to exercise the power to approve by-laws currently vested in the consuls and ministers of treaty powers. This body should consist of six or nine people, with Chinese representatives accounting for at least one-third. The approval by a majority of six or nine people should be the final decision. (3) Cooperation between the Municipal Council and the Chinese government authorities. A. The Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Government should have formal and direct contact. Cooperation between the two sides should be based on mutual recognition and respect for their respective exclusive powers within their jurisdictions. However, with regard to roads outside the boundary, flexible arrangements may be made as needed. For matters of common concern to both regions, both sides should strive to agree on a common policy. B. In addition to the general cooperation referred to above, efforts should also be made by both sides to jointly organize and maintain a number of joint institutions to serve the common interests of both regions, thereby developing closer cooperation. If the French Concession authorities are also willing to support this plan, then all of Shanghai will be under the jurisdiction of a body organized by representatives of the three concerned regions. (4) Collection of taxes. Future issues that arise in the International Settlement from the implementation of Chinese laws and regulations regarding the collection of taxes should be handled in accordance with the reasons mentioned above. The outline of such agreements should be the same as the agreements concluded for the implementation of the Stamp Tax Ordinance and the Consolidated Tobacco Tax Ordinance. Additional comments were then added, providing explanations and examples for the above recommendations. Regarding the second recommendation under the heading of cooperation, further suggestions were made as follows: Closer cooperation among the three administrative regions of Shanghai seems most appropriate in public health matters. It is specifically recommended that a fully equipped isolation hospital be established for infectious diseases and a sanatorium be established for tuberculosis. This facility can also be considered an urgent measure for the common benefit of all of Shanghai. Joint efforts by the authorities in each district to meet this common urgent need will be of great benefit. Any suggestions on this point are only of a hypothetical nature, as the Hospital and Nursing Services Committee organized by the International Settlement Municipal Council is currently under investigation, so this suggestion is even more hypothetical. The hypothetical suggestion that I want to put forward is to find a way to organize a joint hospital committee by representatives of the three districts to establish and maintain isolation hospitals and tuberculosis sanatoriums. The income required by the joint committee should be contributed separately by the districts concerned, in proportion to their tax revenue sources. The initial step in establishing this institution seems to be to first establish a joint advisory committee to study the issue of the need for such hospitals and sanatoriums in all of Shanghai. The joint advisory committee is also organized by representatives of the three districts, and its task is to make recommendations regarding the number, size, and location of the hospitals to be established, and to submit a budget of the required expenses. If the plan proposed by the advisory committee is approved by the authorities concerned, an executive committee can be organized in the same way to act on its behalf. The responsibility of the executive committee is to implement the plan and supervise the established hospitals. Estimating the sources of tax revenue that can be collected in each district as a standard for each district's contribution inevitably involves some difficult issues at this time, as there is no unified valuation system in each district. However, it is not impossible to estimate their approximate numbers as a fairer basis for comparison. Any distribution of economic responsibility, whether based on population or on the number of people treated in each district's hospitals, will result in the amount contributed by each district being proportional to the need and not to the resources. The intention of requiring contributions from the authorities in each district in proportion to their resources is to recognize that districts with greater financial resources should bear the responsibility of assisting districts with less financial resources, and to recognize that resisting the various diseases that this plan seeks to address is for the common benefit of all of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Letters</p>
<p>Respectfully, I recently read the news item "Municipal Chamber of Commerce Mediates Dock Donation Issue" in your newspaper's local news column on the 20th of this month. Some of the details are slightly different from the facts. It was found that the cotton cloth industry wanted to add the dock donation to the out-of-town merchants. When the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting on the same day, we stated at the time that in terms of purchasing coarse cloth in large quantities alone, the consolidated tax currently collected is one cent and three li and nine hao per bolt, while the cotton cloth industry charges out-of-town merchants an additional one cent and five li. In addition to the consolidated tax that should be paid, there is a surplus of one li and one hao, while the dock donation is two li and four hao. Therefore, according to the total amount, the cotton cloth industry, in addition to paying the consolidated tax and dock donation on behalf of the out-of-town merchants, still has an unexpected fee of eight li and six hao per bolt. As such, in the item of the dock donation, the out-of-town merchants calculate it according to the customer's rate when purchasing goods. All donation fees should be the responsibility of the cotton cloth industry to pay. Therefore, we made every effort to state this intention at the meeting on the same day, but your newspaper omitted it. It concerns the responsibility of the representatives, and we respectfully request that this letter be published in the letters column. Respectfully addressed to the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Wang Xinfu, Sun Jiechen, and Ji Chun, representatives of the Andong, Yantai, Harbin, and Longkou out-of-town merchants, June 23rd.</p>
<p>Respectfully, according to Yang Changguo of the Shanghai Branch of the Nanjing Chongshan Hall, the news item "Chongdaotang Frauds Money with Ghosts and Spirits" published in your newspaper's local news column on the 21st of this month, the reported situation does not match the facts. It was found that Chongdaotang's main hall is located in Nanjing and is dedicated to abstaining from opium, treating illnesses, distributing clothes and rice, and providing general relief to the people. It is purely a charitable organization that has been investigated and approved by the Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and registered, and has been issued License No. Yi 62 on file. In order to promote good deeds, the main hall has set up a branch hall in Shanghai, which has been approved and registered with a license issued by the main hall, License No. Yi 62 on file. The branch hall is subject to the jurisdiction of the main organization. Therefore, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, the branch hall reported to the Municipal People's Training Association for approval and registration, and at the same time, is proceeding with the registration procedures with the Social Affairs Bureau. Among those who have given up opium addiction in the hall, three or four hundred people have succeeded and left happily in the past two years. If there were any fraudulent activities, it would not be allowed by society, and the victims would never remain silent. The facts are all there and cannot be concealed with a few words. As for the people who give up opium addiction, it is only natural that they are grateful and willing to donate to promote their cause because they have gotten rid of their old illness. This is true for all charitable organizations. It is inaccurate to refer to it as fraudulently taking money. Although a police officer from the first precinct of the Public Security Bureau came to inquire about the situation the day before yesterday, he was informed of the details and shown the registration certificate, and he was immediately relieved. There was no mention of ghosts and spirits possessing people or punishing people. It must be inaccurate hearsay. You are requested to send a letter on our behalf to correct it in order to clarify the truth, etc. Special delivery, respectfully request your newspaper to publish it in the news column to correct it. Thank you very much. Respectfully addressed to the editor, Lawyer Yang Changchi, June 24th, 20th year [of the Republic].</p>

<h3 id="e230">A Picture of Displaced Refugees <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Huai Bing</p>
<p>In the areas of Henan and Hubei, the scourge of bandits is spreading. Wherever the flames of war pass, the fields are in ruins. The misery of the looting is no less than that in southern Jiangxi. The common people have no harvest and cannot fill their stomachs, so they have no choice but to seek relief by begging outside the province. Infants are carried in baskets, and entire villages travel together. The elderly carry burdens on the road, begging for food to prolong their lives. These are called refugees. Between towns and villages, there are often such refugees passing through. Although the provincial government's proclamations are grand, they are not allowed to enter the province. However, the arrival of refugees continues unabated. When officials encounter refugees, they can only follow the usual practice of providing assistance and forcefully preventing them from crossing the border. The supply requires about two or thirty yuan per hundred people. The amount is negotiated and determined by the representatives with the local authorities, as if pricing. Although the matter is troublesome, there is no other good way to deal with it. One day, more refugees arrived in Weiting Town. Out of curiosity, I went to see their situation. There were about seventy or eighty people, all from Si County, Henan, and came from Kunshan. They were about to go west. They were stationed in the east of the town, some emaciated, some with plump complexions. The rich and poor among them were very different. At the time, they were supporting mats as huts and picking up bricks to make stoves, planning a short stay. The rice straw purchased and stored by the Public Security Bureau was looted. There was nothing they could do. If the supply was not satisfactory, there was always the danger of accidents. Among them were three or five people wearing serge robes and superior felt hats, with glittering rings, who were the leaders of the team. Their clothes were quite luxurious. They were addicted to cigarettes and alcohol. The pits of jujubes and the shells of longans were scattered all over the ground. At the time, I saw them cooking eels, without removing the intestines, frying the whole strips in oil. After they were cooked, they tore them apart and ate them, then the intestines and bones were removed. They said that it was too much trouble for the people of Jiangnan to remove the intestines before eating eels. The poor were full of despair and looked forward to receiving food to fill their stomachs. Their joys and sorrows were not evenly distributed. Some also came out to sell white cloth. The cloth was not like the products of Henan. I could not investigate the source of the cloth in detail. Those who were interested asked about the situation in their hometown. They said that the bandits had repeatedly looted without restraint. Those who could not be exploited were often brutally killed to vent their anger. Therefore, there were those who were separated from their wives and children, and those who were buried in ditches. The misery was unbearable to hear.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Elementary School Speech Contest <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>On June 13th, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau held a municipal elementary school speech contest at Wuben Girls' Middle School. The contest was presided over by the secretary of the Bureau, Cen Youchang, and assisted by Zhang Yanggao and Wang Jinqi. A large number of male and female guests participated enthusiastically, with fragrant clothes, beautiful hairstyles, and colorful flowers. It was a grand occasion. I will record a few things to remember.</p>
<p>Dressed in Red and Green: The speakers were all about ten years old. Most of the clothes they wore were newly made. Most of the materials were red and green. This is because children's psychology is in line with the primitive peoples, who prefer colors that are bright and eye-catching, as if attending a wedding banquet. Some of the male students wore suits, from ties to leather shoes, which were very exquisite. Mr. Zhang said that a student at a certain university in Japan may not bring his lecture notes and books, but he must have a mirror and shoe-shining cloth. The suits of our country's elementary school students are beautiful and can be compared with those of Japanese university students. However, Japanese university students are old but do not learn, while our country's elementary school students learn but are not old.</p>
<p>Girls Excel: In the end, five winners were selected. Four of these five winners were girls. According to past history, the first place has always been a female student. The linguistic ability of girls seems to be superior to that of boys. The American educator Thorndike investigated the mental differences between the sexes. Girls were better than boys in word cancellation tests, spelling, national language, and foreign languages. From this, the linguistic ability of girls can be seen.</p>
<p>Three Points for Judging: The performance of the speeches has improved more than before. Students such as Shang Wenxi and Cheng, etc. were also very appropriate. In the event of any deficiencies, the judge Lu Feibo provided on-the-spot guidance on one point. (1) A speech is a speech, not just reciting. In the future, remember the main ideas and do not have to stick to the words. Then it will be fluent. (2) Most of the attitudes are unnatural, like acting in a play, like arguing, like Shandong people selling their fists. In the future, there should be movement in stillness and stillness in movement. Strive for liveliness and naturalness, and you can win. (3) There are quite a few people whose accents are not correct. "Shen" is read as "Cheng". "Lv" is read as "Li". "Mo" is made as "Ma". "Sun" is made as "Shen". There are many more. Pay attention at all times and you can improve.</p>

<p>— (Du Juan)</p>
<p>The world today is indeed too boring and too dull. Therefore, most pessimistic people want to end their lives by committing suicide and escape to another world. But the boredom and dullness of another world may be even worse than this world. By the time you want to escape back, it will be too late.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Interesting Anecdotes About Arresting Bodhisattvas <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Wenqi</p>
<p>Since Mo Runxun became the head of the Public Security Bureau in Shaoxing, our city has been extremely serious about investigating and prohibiting opium, gambling, and prostitution. Moreover, they have been vigorous and exerted every effort in eradicating superstition. Recently, they even arrested Huanglao Xianggong (the most revered deity in Shaoxing) and female shamans who used deities to collect money. Consequently, both "dead" and "living" Bodhisattvas have been arrested. The matter is quite amusing, so I record it as follows:</p>
<p>Bodhisattvas Actually Become Prisoners — The shrines of Huanglao Xianggong in Shaoxing are found everywhere, with those in Qingdian Lake, Jiangjia Lou, and Shiyantou being particularly famous. Every year on Huanglao's birthday, villagers celebrate the deity's birthday with operas and temple fairs, which are extraordinarily lively. Director Mo believes that such superstitious activities not only waste people's money and resources but also easily cause trouble. To fundamentally eliminate these issues, he specially dispatched police to arrest the Huanglao Xianggong idols from the three locations of Qingdian Lake, Jiangjia Lou, and Shiyantou and bring them to the city, temporarily detaining them in the City God Temple. These venerable Bodhisattvas have thus been transformed into prisoners.</p>
<p>Turns Out They Were Gluttonous Bodhisattvas — A woman surnamed Wang from Chang'an Street recently claimed to be possessed by a deity and able to predict good and bad fortune. In her home, she enshrined a red deity tablet inscribed with the absurd and bizarre phrase "The position of the late Mrs. Wu, the stepmother, is continued." Her neighbor, a Mrs. Song, consulted her about her fortune. Mrs. Wang, falsely claiming to speak on behalf of the deity, said that she would die within a hundred days unless she offered five dou of rice, one turtle, and two jin each of dried longan and lotus seeds for the deity to devour. Mrs. Song believed it to be true and immediately gave her the requested items. This matter came to the attention of the Public Security Bureau, which promptly dispatched police to arrest the woman. This gluttonous Bodhisattva did not get to eat the offerings but instead tasted the flavor of a jail cell first.</p>
<p>Bodhisattvas Also Know to Collect Consultation Fees — The wife of a Mr. Xu from Dongpu also falsely claimed to be possessed by a deity and able to cure illnesses. Initially, those who sought treatment only needed to offer a set of incense and candles. Later, as the number of seekers increased, she claimed that the Bodhisattva was now practicing medicine and required a consultation fee of two jiao to show respect. This was subsequently increased to four jiao, and recently, it was increased to one yuan. Her daily income surpassed even that of famous doctors, causing them to sigh with envy. People called her a "living Bodhisattva," and some even sent her inscribed plaques. However, Xu's wife remained greedy and insatiable, and she solicited donations to create a statue for the deity. As a result, she swindled six or seven hundred yuan. A villager named Cai, seeing this, coveted the money and wanted to share the spoils with Xu's wife. Xu's wife refused, so Cai reported her to the police station, accusing her of collecting money under the guise of a deity. Thus, this "living Bodhisattva" who practiced medicine was also arrested and imprisoned. It is said that she will be charged with the crime of obtaining money through fraud.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 13th, I gave a lecture at the university, chaired by President Amavanatha Tha. The students asked many strange questions, which lasted about two hours. New materials were discovered here regarding the study of war psychology. According to a certain professor, a family of monkeys consists of one male and over ten females. The male monkey is vicious and sometimes kills the female monkeys. This short story is comparable to the Arabian Nights tale of King Shahryar, who took a new wife every night and killed her in the morning. This proves the evils of war, with the male being the root cause. Marx's materialistic view of history is incomplete. Unless male wealth and power are equalized, the world will be difficult to pacify. This is what the biology professor told me. He wanted to oppose my scholarship. Even if men and women cooperate, conflict is unavoidable. However, his example proves the evil of the male. Even if he does not love the female, he kills her after intercourse, which is similar to the example cited by the Englishwoman Felipu of male cats killing their kittens. Both powerfully prove that male physiology is the root of war, which I find increasingly convincing. Monkey nature is considered gentle among animals, yet the evil of the male is such. No wonder in Tokyo, Japan, every morning the newspapers report cases of husbands killing their wives. Thus, the male is indeed the root of war.</p>
<p>On the 14th, I attended a debate at the home of the Muslim scholar Rehmen. Over ten professors and eminent lawyers, all Muslims, participated. The debate lasted a long time. In the end, Lawyer Rehmen was appointed as the organizing committee member. All acknowledged my argument and signed their names. The Muslim author Misrza Shuifaxze presented me with his two books: an English biography of Muhammad and Muhammad's teachings. He hopes that someone in China can translate them. Finding a Quran in Chinese is very difficult. The Muslim bookstore in Ximen, Beijing, does not have one either. The English version costs thirty yuan, which is too expensive. Many English books on Islam are written by Christians, which may not be entirely reliable. In Misrza's biography of Muhammad, his wife Khadija is described as a widow who had been married twice before. She proposed to Muhammad, who was then her third husband. When Muhammad was enlightened, Khadija recognized and publicized his teachings. Khadija was forty years old and Muhammad was twenty-five when they married. After twenty-five years, Khadija died at the age of sixty-five, and Muhammad, at fifty, began to spread his teachings through military force. This proves that the power of Islam came from women. During Khadija's lifetime, military force was not used to spread the religion. Therefore, Islam does not treat women poorly, but its customs resemble those of the Qedarites. The original intention was not to oppress women. Moreover, the custom of polygamy among Muslims in the desert states that Muhammad only married multiple wives after Khadija's death, and even then, it was only a few, compared to the thousands of concubines of Chinese emperors. The Muslims I have met in various places have very modern ideas and strong organizational skills. Their future rise is to be expected and immeasurable. Muslims are more effective than Indians in execution. Indians are fond of talking and fantasizing but are lazy in action. This is their great shortcoming. Muslims, knowing that there are Muslims in China, are particularly friendly to the Chinese.</p>
<p>Fiction: Rotary Club</p>
<p>[P???&gt;</p>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Ziliang was somewhat displeased that she was disturbing his sleep while he was sound asleep. He quickly used his right hand to push Yue Ru away and then turned his body in a "left turn" motion, as if on a parade ground. He turned towards the outer bed, pulled the quilt up a little, covered his head, and planned to go back to sleep, knowing that it was still early.</p>
<p>Ziliang's actions managed to keep his wife away for the moment, but who knew that in a short while, his wife had gone to the foot of the bed. His wife lifted the quilt off his feet. Ziliang felt the cold on his feet and retracted his legs. Unexpectedly, he felt a strange itch on the soles of his right foot. He wanted to escape, but his foot was already unable to move, as it had been grabbed by his wife's hand.</p>
<p>At this point, he was very angry. He hurriedly threw off the quilt and sat up:</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>Ziliang glared and asked his wife, who was giggling. At that moment, his wife had already released his foot and was holding a bed brush in her right hand, covering her mouth with the back of her left hand, laughing non-stop. The bed brush was the one she had just used to brush the soles of his feet.</p>
<p>"Isn't it Sunday today? Can't you let me sleep in a little longer?"</p>
<p>Yue Ru didn't answer, but continued to laugh at Ziliang.</p>
<p>"I didn't go to sleep until after twelve o'clock last night, haven't you thought about that? And you still want to come and fool around!"</p>
<p>As Ziliang spoke, he threw the corner of the quilt that was still on his body towards the inner bed, his face full of anger, towards his wife who was sitting in the middle of the bed. His wife laughed even harder.</p>
<p>"You get up early in the morning and make such a scary face. You're frightening me! You should go to the water basin and take a look at that face of yours!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Ziliang was both annoyed and amused. She usually scolded me for being a stingy ghost, and today she simply told me to go to the water basin and look at my face.</p>
<p>"Other people's husbands are so gentle and pleasant to their wives; only you are making scary faces all day long!"</p>
<p>Yue Ru continued.</p>
<p>"If you don't feel like sleeping, just get up and go downstairs! I want to sleep."</p>
<p>"No! Husband and wife are supposed to share the same bed in life and the same grave in death. Since I've gotten up and am not sharing the same bed with you, you should get up too!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense? There are also walnuts and dates!"</p>
<p>Correction: In the seventh line of the twenty-fourth issue, "section of the neck" should be "back of the neck."</p>

<p>Financial Gold Margin Continues to Weaken</p>
<h3 id="e235">Another Drop of Ten Taels and Nine Qian <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 24th, the gold margin showed weakness again. The situation was chaotic, with considerable fluctuations. The force of its rises and falls was unstoppable. Throughout the day, a total of thirty taels were traded, resulting in a drop of more than ten taels. People were alarmed. However, large investors dumped their holdings. Although the silver market also fell, it was unaffected. Indeed, the slight decrease in silver from America was the case. Thus, it initially opened lower, but then buyers became more aggressive, especially the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, whose buying interest was still good. It once briefly broke through the 750 tael mark. Unexpectedly, selling positions followed one after another. And seeing that foreign exchange turned from strong to tight, with quotations remaining unchanged, a storm suddenly broke out. It fell sharply, plummeting nearly thirty taels. Afterwards, the atmosphere eased again. Because foreign exchange trended flat, banks still had inquiries, and it re-emerged outside thirty taels. In short, the state of affairs was confusing, making it difficult to handle. The evening market had no bills due to it being Wednesday, so there was no large bill trading on the table. However, the price was extremely complicated, hovering above thirty taels. Large bars may rebound slightly this morning, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Low Opening Immediately Appears <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>From the early opening at 742.5 taels in August, it immediately dropped by 1.5 taels. It almost reduced 9/16ths tael for large bars, but the silver price only dropped 5/8ths tael, and private telegrams only reduced by 1/2 tael, so people’s sentiment was flat. However, the European market was still stable. Because buyers were not smooth, Citibank intended to sell, so goods initially traded at 46 taels, and then depreciated by 6 or 7 taels. Around nine o'clock, buyers here became active, with Wanhsing Shunli, etc., purchasing. And HSBC, etc., first absorbed August English gold at 1875, and immediately jumped to 50 taels and 5 qian. Unexpectedly, speculators and various firms sold one after another, and because English gold at 1875 was difficult to sell, it suddenly weakened and plummeted 8 or 9 taels. However, there were occasional rises and falls of 4 or 5 taels. Subsequently, banks bought English gold at 3125, so when the provisional rate was announced, it was 39 taels, and the listed price did not change. Then, because hedging firms came to enter, it immediately added 3 taels. Instantly, the selling sentiment was heard to be strong. Bingxing, Tianyuyong, Yongqian, Changxiang, Dadecheng, Hengyu, etc., all came to sell. As for English gold, various banks bought and then loosened. Then it was actually 13.5 to 13.5625, and the gold price plummeted outside of 20 taels. At 10:00, it ultimately was 21 taels. However, there were extremely few transactions at this price, and it immediately rose back 2 or 3 taels. Yuanmao, Yongda, Dalian, Bangyuan, Taifu, Taiheng, Hsingda, etc., came to enter. Only a quarter of an hour later, it jumped more than 11 taels, to 32.5 taels. Banks mutually traded July-August English gold at 4375 to 0.5 pence. Datong absorbed September at 0.5 pence. Afterwards, the market was extremely chaotic. From 10:30 to 10:45, there was a hidden reserve of 7 or 8 taels, and people's hearts were confused and uncertain. After that, Qianchangxiang, Daxingyong, etc., bought, and banks absorbed August-September English gold at 375 to 4375, so it was raised more than 10 taels again, to 38 taels at 11:30. It then suppressed again to 34 taels. It closed at 37 taels at noon, with the situation extremely unstable and unpredictable. The quoted price was calculated to be 790 taels and 2 qian, a squeeze of around 50 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Peaceful Afternoon Scene <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Afternoon trading opened at 38.5 taels, and the Indian exchange telegram added 7 anna. It then retreated to 32.5 taels. There were then rises and falls of 3 or 4 taels, but trading was very small. Subsequently, Wanhsing Shunli and Items, etc., came to purchase. And hearing that the Indian exchange returned a little, 4 or 5 anna, people's hearts were refreshed, and it immediately added 5 or 6 taels, to 38 taels after 2:30. Then there were many sellers, but the quantity was not large. Shunli, Wanhsing, and a certain customer, etc., were selling, and it fell 8 or 9 taels, to only 29 taels at 3:30. In between, there were advances and retreats of 3 or 4 taels. At this time, Bingxing, etc., bought in, and added 3 taels, to 32 taels. Suddenly, because the Indian exchange reported a large increase of 12 anna, it was then suppressed to 29.5 taels. After 3:45, it had broken out of 30 taels, and small households, etc., were chasing in, and the market atmosphere seemed stable. At 4:00, it was 34 taels, and then decreased to 31.5 taels. At the 4:30 closing, it was calculated to be 33 taels and 1 qian, a drop of 10 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous day. According to the integrated market, the highest price was 750 taels and 5 qian, and the lowest price was 21 taels, a difference of 29.5 taels. Items early market was 44.5 taels, noon closing was 36 taels, afternoon was 37.5 taels, and the closing price was 3 taels and 8 qian. The quoted price was 50 to 60 taels, the recorded price was 40 to 37 taels, and the additional water was 40 to 36 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Mixed Transactions at Various Firms <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>According to statistics, the following firms were mainly buying: Yuanmao Yong, Yuan Kangxiang, Hengxing, Yuantai, Fuyu, Wanxing, Shunli, Futaiheng, and Tong Taichang. The following firms were mainly selling: Yuanxingyong, Bingxing, Cuichangyong, Qianchangxiang, Tong Fengyu, Yuda, Hengyu, Hongxing, Tianyuyong, and Longsheng. Dadecheng and Zhifengyong bought and then sold. Hengxing Yuan first sold and then bought. Mr. Wu sold. In the afternoon, Yuantai, Wanxing, Yuanmao Yong, Shunli, Futaiheng, Yuanxingyong, and Bingxing all bought. Tong Taichang, Yongfeng, and Yuan Kangxiang all sold. Zhifengyong, Yuanheng, Yuancheng, and Senchangyong had occasional buying and selling. Guangdong firms bought more than 500 bars, and Dalian firms bought a total of 5,000 bars and sold a total of 2,000.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Foreign Exchange Chinese Merchants Continue to Dump <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Market Conditions Loosen</p>
<p>Yesterday, British and American silver markets both reported declines. However, the market was still stable, almost as though the Shanghai market was unmoved. The HSBC listing was no different from the afternoon modification the day before, only Hong Kong decreased by 0.75, calculated at 80 taels 0.025. As for the domestic market, the British, American, and Japanese exchanges were initially firm, then declined in the morning, and returned to flat at noon. Gold market was high and then low, then turned flat again, with considerable fluctuations. So people’s hearts were confused. At noon closing, compared to yesterday, the exchanges seemed to loosen. British gold increased by 1.25, American gold by 3.125, and Japanese gold decreased by 0.0175. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, there was usually no market. The Chinese Merchants’ Gold Industry was still inclined to dump, and then hedge turn tickets. The English gold approximately achieved 400,000 pounds, and bank buying interest was not weak. American gold still did not have many receipts and disbursements. Japanese gold also had no inquiries.</p>
<h3 id="e240">British Exchange <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>

<p>The cent market during this week has been slightly lively, with prices slightly higher than last week. The prices have risen in measured steps, but sales are not very smooth, so the momentum will ultimately lead to flatness and it will probably be difficult to hope for a major improvement. As for the silver, its condition is firm and soft, without any consistency. As a result, it can only stabilize.</p>

<p>Drastic Changes, Resulting in a Significant Drop</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt futures market was very lively. Buyers and sellers were very active. Important bonds came in and out very enthusiastically. Only spot markets were sluggish. The market demand was still strong in the former market. Although there were large sales from a certain party, the supply and demand were balanced and the market price continued to rise. The initial market in the latter market was slightly weak, but the fluctuations were very small. The market atmosphere suddenly turned weak at the closing. Selling surged, and the decline in bond prices suddenly intensified. For example, reorganization, troop reduction, 19 customs, charitable, and 20 rolled, etc., all fell quite a bit. As a result, only the full six, customs duty, 96, etc., remained strong, while troop reduction, 19 customs July futures, 19 charitable June futures, and 20 rolled futures all plummeted by 1.89 yuan. The others also fell slightly by 1.45 yuan. This was an expected reaction after several days of successive increases. It is estimated that the spot transaction for the whole day was only 3,000 yuan, and the futures transaction was nearly 28,000,000 yuan, of which 20 customs accounted for more than 10,000,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Summary Is Still Slightly Lower</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, but the trend was relatively calm. Because actual sales were not smooth. However, purchases were very enthusiastic in the past few days. After a large number of transactions, there must be a period of calm. Therefore, although business was slow, the stock was still short in various factories. The spot yarn market was still able to maintain its price. However, the tag yarn was weakened by the short selling of large accounts, which caused the sentiment to weaken, and spot yarn sales were stagnant. Generally, small amounts were frequently showing signs of unease, so the market trend gradually declined. However, according to the actual situation, there should be no such decline. Although the silver price was up, the price of goods had soared. Compared with the two, the price of the spot yarn was still cheap. Therefore, the export trade with Japan was continuous. The Shenxin Factory again sold 800 bales of 16-count and 20-count "Ren Zhong" yarn.</p>

<p>The cotton market rebounded after falling, but the trend is still flat. This is because spot cotton trading is sluggish, and gold prices are also fluctuating, causing confusion and uncertainty.

<p>Yesterday, the source of goods from various guilds was thirty to forty numbers. Sales were sluggish. The market for Changshu thick japonica rice continued to decline, with Central Gate goods shrinking by about 0.2 tael. The market situation showed a further decline. Thin rice arrivals were weak, and prices fell by 0.1 to 0.2 tael. The outflow of foreign Du Jian rice was limited. River stocks gradually increased, and buying interest was subdued. A small amount of Ba Ba Jian rice arrived, with some separate dismantling. Production news continued to soften, and prices shortened by a fraction. Customer Jian rice was cheaper, so store owners were still eager, but the situation only slightly eased. Foreign rice sales were small, only about a half foot. Trading was not active. White Yuan arrivals were strong daily, and prices fell by 0.1 to 0.2 foot.</p>

<p>Yesterday, about 30 boats arrived in the Huangpu River. Sales in this street were minimal. The declining trend of thick japonica rice intensified, with a large decline of about 0.2 tael. Foreign Du Jian rice was greatly affected by foreign rice, and sentiment was extremely soft. Because foreign rice goods were similar to Lu Jian rice, sales were scarce, shortening by 0.1 to 0.2 tael. Thin rice such as Qingjiao, Sisong, and Liantang arrived continuously. Inward purchases from all parties were weak, and prices fell with the general trend by 0.2 to 0.3 tael. Early rice sales were brisk, with some trading. The market price must be tired by about one foot. Glutinous rice was sold as it arrived, and the price did not rise or fall.</p>

<p>Prices Fall Two Fen in Each Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market again showed a declining and weak trend. Foreign wheat quotations fell sharply by about 0.6 to 0.7 tael. Domestically, the Xisu guilds had frequently absorbed supplies due to the scarcity of new wheat arrivals. However, this year's wheat harvest varied in quality, so observations differed based on the quality of the harvest. In terms of actual sales, due to the large harvest in the north, they decreased compared to previous years. Yesterday, due to the decline in foreign wheat quotations and the surge in arrivals in Wuxi, prices also weakened. For a time, selling pressure steadily increased, and prices fell for both near and far months. Looking at future trends, with actual sales being very quiet and new wheat arrivals surging, prices will likely fall further. As a result, this month fell by 0.0075 tael compared to the previous day, July fell by 0.015 tael, August fell by 0.0225 tael, and September, October, and November each fell by 0.02 tael.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, due to foreign wheat quotations falling by 0.6 to 0.7 tael, the sentiment of steadfastly holding on to prices could not [be maintained]. Arrivals had reached ten thousand bags, unlike the silence of a few days ago. Because Shanghai factories were mostly watching, only Wuxi factories were selectively buying high-quality goods, so prices also did not increase, tending towards a downward trend. Given this situation, sentiment was weak, and selling was prevalent. Looking ahead, if arrivals from both local and foreign ports continue to surge, prices will likely fall further. As a result, this month fell by 0.03 tael compared to the previous day, July fell by 0.03 tael, August and September fell by 0.05 tael, October fell by 0.04 tael, and November fell by 0.05 tael. In the spot wheat market, because standards weakened and large factories were still watching, the situation for mid-quality goods was very bad. Yesterday, Penglai wheat opened at 3.65 tael, Shuangfeng wheat at 3.75 tael and 3.72 tael. Only Huafeng allocated 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign silk market, prices suddenly trended upwards. It was found that Japanese silk prices in the New York market had risen sharply in unison. Shanghai white factory silk prices were transferred electronically, not weak, but the increase was not high. Because the costs of Chinese merchants were relatively high, transactions were still difficult to reach smoothly. Yesterday, Qianli and others bought 50 bales of B-grade Shanghai white factory silk, and prices rose sharply by 10 to 20 tael.</p>

<p>Farmers in the Pingyao, Changleqiao, and Jinjianong areas of Yuhang are experiencing a good summer silkworm rearing season this year. Unfortunately, due to the difficulty of purchasing silkworm eggs and the prevalence of mixed breeds, the hatching was not easy. After receiving the silkworms, the weather was sunny and warm, and everything went well. However, after the third molt, there were continuous rainy days, and the weather suddenly became cold and hot, causing changes in the silkworms. Some were abandoned. Although it is sunny now, it is still overcast and cold, and the silkworms' development is delayed. The early batches have entered the major molt, and molting is uneven.</p>

The market situation for Luxhuang Zhenmei green tea remained desolate. Zhongguan goods such as Baochang and Tongfu slightly increased their inventory. Chinese merchants were still mostly unwilling to relax on tea with better production methods. However, in terms of the overall tea market trend, the green tea market has already shown an unfavorable trend.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Sugar Market Selling Off Dutch Red Sugar Transactions Are Quite Active <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Sugar Slightly Firms After Falling</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market telegrams stated that the current Cuban sugar price was still 1.34375, the New York futures price for September was 1.31, and the price for December was 1.40. There was no change compared to the previous telegram. The price for March next year was 1.46, down 0.02, and the price for May was 1.52, down 0.01. The prices for current Javanese sugar and futures for all months were 8.125, with only current sugar and June up 0.125 compared to before, and the other months also lacking fluctuations. The association marked Dutch sugar at 24 coarse sand white, but buying interest was very quiet. The opening asking price was 11.4 tael, and the 20 medium sand white was 10.08 tael, with very few buyers. After the Japanese sugar market opened strongly, prices suddenly trended downwards, but the exchange rate recovered strongly, so sentiment slightly stabilized, and market prices stabilized. The N mark price was 10.095 tael, the YT mark was 10.09 to 10.025 tael, the SH mark was 10.0725 tael, the YRO mark was 10.06 tael, the YP mark was 11.03 tael, the TK mark was 10.113 tael, the TM mark was 10.08 tael, and the TK mark was 10.095 tael. The later market was asking 11 tael, and transactions were active. The market shape was quite pretty. Taikoo 0 mark was 8.95 tael for 25 Wen, and the opening was very scarce. The Hao Pan ice flower green was originally asking 10.04 tael, and the market saw it as slightly flat. The Cun Hao of Mianhu red sugar has been cut off, and demand is still strong. The market shape is extremely pretty. The dumping of Dutch red sugar, Liji opened 200 tons of number 8 goods to be shipped in July, with a price of 5.15 Dutch guilders. At the same time, Huaxin and Shunquanlong opened 200 tons each to be shipped in August and September, with a price of 5.075 guilders each. The market surface is flat but not surprising.</p>
<p>Piece Goods and Gold Markets Plunge, Prices Turn Downward</p>
<h3 id="e264">Local Factory Cloth <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market saw mixed rises and falls. Light-weight coarse cloth was quite strong due to the lack of spot goods. 11-pound Three Deer rose to 5.675 tael, Ren Zhong to 5.45 tael, and 9-pound cloth uniformly went out of customs at 5 tael. Mao Ying had to be 5.15 tael, and Wufu 5.1 tael. Ningbo and Wenzhou guilds were quite active in purchasing. Fine cloth plunged due to the plunge in the gold market, and the northern guilds' inward demand turned stagnant, so it had already turned from rising to falling. Blue Chicken was 7.575 tael, Color Ball was 7.75 tael, Yanghe was 7.7 tael, and Blue Double Fish was 7.75 tael. Yesterday, only sporadic additions were made in this street. Fine twill was still stable.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Eastern and Western Piece Goods <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>The market situation was greatly affected by the ups and downs of the gold market. The guilds of Tianjin, Sichuan, Changsha, etc., which were unusually active before, have now uniformly taken a wait-and-see attitude. This street has had little purchasing recently, resulting in a sudden drop in actual sales and a weakening of sentiment. Fortunately, the continuous rise of Sanpin has kept prices in check. Yesterday, Zhigong woolen cloth all slightly fell, with Moganshan Lieyan and others at 0.38 tael, Sanyou Tu at 0.345 tael. Fine bombazine fell more sharply at Huxinting, with a small decline of about 0.0075 tael. Yuanyang yarn also followed its decline. Dianqiuxiang, Shuangtonglu, and Hanshansi all fell by 0.025 tael. Only fine cloth and bleached cloth rose.</p>

<p>The lotus bag branches produced in Guangdong have been harvested somewhat this year, but due to the small quantity, the purchasing price is very high. Yesterday, the Beishi merchants rushed to transport four boxes, which were already shown as samples. The color was good, but the sweetness was inferior. It was heard that the cost must be 45-46 tael. Because the counteroffer from the traders was too far off, no deal has been made yet.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Metals, Garden Galvanized Wire Imported in a Steady Stream <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Since the ordnance factories and military supply offices purchased garden galvanized wire last week, the local stock has been depleted. The standard rose sharply by 0.07-0.08 tael, and the highest price per bundle was estimated at 5.75 tael. However, local industry insiders, seeing that the source of Western goods was not being followed up, have switched to handling Eastern goods, so the import of Eastern garden galvanized wire is incessant. It is heard that over the last three days, arrivals have reached as many as 5-6,000 bundles, and subsequent shipments continue to arrive, so spot goods in the market may have a surplus in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Another 300 Tons of Ribbed Steel Bars Arrive <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to oversupply, the market for ribbed steel bars has been weak. The standard is only estimated at 95 tael per ton, a successive decline of 2-3 tael compared to before. But the large number of arrivals has caused the market to decline further. Yesterday, Western warehouses at each port had arrivals of over 300 tons, and the market situation was even more sluggish than before.</p>
<h3 id="e269">1/4-Inch Nails, New Goods Have Arrived <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>There has been a shortage of 1/4-inch nails for many days, so the general purchasers in the market are eagerly awaiting them. The price has risen successively from 13 tael to 14.5 tael. Later buyers have almost been unable to get goods. In the past two days, new goods have arrived from various foreign firms such as Jiecheng, Kong Shimmei, and Zuishi. Therefore, customers who need this product are all elated. It is heard that over 200 barrels were sold on the market yesterday, with prices estimated at 14.25 tael, which is already 0.025 tael cheaper than before. In addition, the market situation for 4, 3, 5, and 6-inch [nails] is [missing text], so the price [missing text].</p>

<h3 id="e286">Establishment of American Highways <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Qian</p>
<p>Among the European and American nations, the advancement of their automobile industries is naturally led by the United States. Likewise, the establishment of their highways is most orderly in the United States. For major aspects such as road width, vehicle lanes, the function of signage, and pedestrian convenience, there are definite rules, forming the basis for the neatness of the roads. These are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Highway Width　American highways have separate regulations for major roads near cities and those connecting large cities. Ordinary roads are only designed for two lanes of traffic. Initially, vehicles were smaller and speeds were lower. Therefore, surveys of road widths showed that those built before 1918 were mostly 16 feet wide, with some as narrow as 14 feet. As automobile manufacturing increased in size and driving speeds increased, highways built after 1920 were mostly standardized at 18 feet. After 1928, the standard was often set at 20 feet. Although these standards vary by state, the specified widths may not be uniform even within a single state. However, the maximum width of a vehicle is generally limited to eight feet. Consequently, curves are often widened, and regulations also exist for highway intersections, widening the road by several feet within 100 or 200 feet to allow for vehicle waiting.</p>
<p>Vehicle Lanes　Ordinary highways with a width of 20 feet or less only have two lanes. Highways between large cities have three or even six lanes. At key locations or corners, black boundary lines are often painted on the road to indicate separation, making it easier for vehicles to identify lanes and avoid collisions.</p>
<p>Overview of Traffic　Traffic is heaviest on American highways in the eastern states. Major roads often see more than 10,000 vehicles per day, with the busiest thoroughfares reaching as many as 25,000 vehicles. The situation is different in the southern states, where traffic is lighter, with daily vehicle counts reaching up to 5,000 at most or as few as 500. Examining the types of vehicles, private passenger cars account for about 90%, while freight and public buses account for only slightly more than 10%. Public passenger vehicles make up only 1% or 2% of the total. This phenomenon is significantly different from Europe, where heavy freight vehicles hold an important position in traffic. However, in the United States, vehicle size is limited to eight feet in width, and each state has its own weight standards, generally limited to the load per inch of rubber tire width, with no fixed limit on the total vehicle load. Therefore, heavy-load vehicles often have three axles, each with four rubber tires. Automobiles traveling on American highways mostly use hollow rubber tires, with solid rubber tires being rare. This is another significant difference from Europe. Furthermore, iron-rimmed rubber tires are rarely seen. Other slow-moving vehicles, such as handcarts and horse-drawn carriages, mostly travel on rural roads, being rarely seen on major highways. Could there be restrictions on human and animal power in traffic regulations?</p>
<p>Intersection Arrangements　The so-called intersection arrangement refers to the arrangement at the intersection of highways and railways. In the past, highways and railways intersected at the same level. Although there were barriers, accidents were countless. Nowadays, highways with heavier traffic often use overpasses or underpasses for railway crossings, considering them more suitable and safer. The costs are generally shared equally. Even at highway intersections, separations are often made, sparing no expense to ensure traffic safety. This is a major recent advancement in the United States. However, most ordinary highways still intersect with railways at the same level, with the hope of gradual improvement in the future.</p>
<p>Signage Function　Signage erected on American highways serves two purposes: indicative and warning. Indicative signs include national highway numbers, provincial highway numbers, distances to cities, left and right turns, and connections to other roads, all using white signs with black text. Warning signs, such as railway crossings, curves, slopes, and school zones, use yellow signs with black text. For special circumstances, such as slippery roads or obstructions, even more conspicuous signs are used. For example, in Shanghai, to prevent vehicle accidents and pedestrian hazards, there are signs that read "Roads are like a tiger's mouth; do not walk in the middle," but there is no fixed format.</p>
<p>Pedestrian Convenience　American highways often have gas stations for refueling, oiling, and air compression. Public facilities provide telephones at reasonable intervals along the route, allowing pedestrians to communicate with friends and family anytime, anywhere. Belgium is the most comprehensive, with a public telephone every kilometer and a pole every 200 meters indicating the distance to the telephone. However, the vastness of the United States may make this difficult to implement. There are also restrooms to facilitate travelers. On the private side, residences along the highway often welcome tourists to stop. Signs are erected in front of homes, and those who wish to dine, lodge, or bathe midway due to lateness will find it convenient. Moreover, small wooden cabins with multiple eaves are built beside the houses, with elevated beds, costing one U.S. dollar per night, creating a home-away-from-home atmosphere, reflecting the emotional nature of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Sharp Increase in French Automobiles <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Gan</p>
<p>Recently, a Mr. Teck wrote an article in the New York Times stating that in 1930, France led the world in automobile sales, surpassing even the United States. This development is unprecedented in the automotive industry. According to "American Automobiles" magazine, France's additional car registrations increased by 178,000 units last year, while the United States only increased by 126,094 units. In terms of percentage increase, the progress is even more remarkable, with France increasing by 13.5% and the United States by 0.5%.</p>
<p>The number of new car registrations in twelve countries including France, the United States, and the United Kingdom at the end of 1930 is listed below:</p>
<p>France　　　178,000 units</p>
<p>United States　　126,100 units</p>
<p>Great Britain　　　83,700 units</p>
<p>Germany　　　　　49,700 units</p>
<p>Canada　　　　45,600 units</p>
<p>Italy　　　　28,000 units</p>
<p>Argentina　　　　21,700 units</p>
<p>Belgium　　　　17,700 units</p>
<p>Netherlands　　　　17,000 units</p>
<p>New Zealand　　　　16,000 units</p>
<p>South Africa　　　　14,600 units</p>
<p>Switzerland　　　　14,300 units</p>
<p>France has experienced less economic difficulty than other countries, allowing it to continue its efforts to advance the automotive industry in 1930. Such achievements can only be found in highly affluent and civilized nations. Horses, bicycles, and oxcarts still travel in French cities and villages and occupy an important position. However, the "friend of humanity" powered by gasoline can be seen expanding its influence everywhere.</p>
<p>Currently, there is one car for every 28 people in France, a remarkable record in Europe, but still far behind the United States, where there is one car for every 4.6 people. In Canada and New Zealand, the ratio of people to cars is 7.5 and 10, respectively.</p>
<p>France's current situation is similar to that of the United States in 1917, when there was one car for every 28 people. Some may ask whether the French will have one car per person in another fourteen years. The answer is that it will take a longer time.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the French population are farmers who are conservative and slow to recognize the benefits of trucks and trailers. Therefore, today's car dealers mostly seek customers in large cities. Paris alone accounts for one-seventh of all cars in France, with one car for every 19 people.</p>
<p>In terms of the total number of cars, France has fewer cars than the United Kingdom. However, this year, French car sales will be second only to the United States. In 1930, France's car sales increased by 95,000 units more than the UK, and if it can increase by 58,000 units in 1931, it will surpass the UK again. The top five countries with the highest car sales are listed below:</p>
<p>January 1930</p>
<p>United States 26,691,000</p>
<p>Great Britain　1,558,000 units</p>
<p>France　　1,500,000 units</p>
<p>Canada　　1,215,000 units</p>
<p>Germany　　　　659,000 units</p>
<p>The tariffs passed by the French Parliament in April 1930 significantly increased taxes on automobiles, greatly impacting U.S. foreign trade. This can be seen in the import and export report of January 2. Domestic production in France decreased by about 20% a year ago, and passenger car exports fell by 12.5% in January and February. Imports accounted for 69.2%.</p>
<p>U.S. importers continue to spend large sums of money in Paris to display car models for public viewing. This is purely for advertising purposes. Ford cars are still assembled in France, and the use of French materials is increasing daily. According to last year's annual report, the new tariffs only increased the cost of Ford cars by 4%, and the retail price remains unchanged.</p>
<p>John Lawrence, the European representative of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, has returned to Paris headquarters after a six-week trip to the Baltic states. He examined Germany, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Lawrence reported that there are signs of improvement in all areas, contrary to initial observations and expectations. He said, "German manufacturers of automobile parts have increased their work plans for the summer, reversing previous reduction strategies. Demand is improving everywhere."</p>

<h3 id="e289">New Information on Zhejiang-Wuxi Road Administration <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Qian</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province Handles Joint Transportation on the Hangzhou-Pinghu Route The Zhejiang Construction Department, noting the increasing development of the province's highway system and the surplus in various road sections, along with the promising traffic conditions, has approved a joint transportation venture between the Provincial Highway Administration and the Hangzhou-Pinghu Road Company to benefit long-distance travelers. The proposed measures have been revised and are now being issued, with instructions for all joint transportation revenue to be reported monthly. The following are ten provisional measures extracted from the joint transportation plan between the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration and the Hangzhou-Pinghu Automobile Company for the Hangzhou-Penggongling route: (1) This Administration, to facilitate long-distance travelers between Xiaohe and Hangzhou's Lakeside and Penggongling and Xiaohe, will temporarily provide one passenger car to operate between Xiaohe and the Lakeside, exclusively handling joint transportation with the company at the Xiaohe station. (2) The company will receive the Administration's Xiaohe-Lakeside tickets and luggage tickets for distribution and sale at each station. The Administration will also receive the company's tickets and luggage tickets for each station and the joint transportation tickets between Xiaohe and Penggongling for sale at the Hangzhou station. (3) The Administration and the company will settle ticket revenues every ten days, with each settling in cash and temporarily waiving handling fees. (4) The joint transportation passenger car will operate eight round trips daily, with its schedule aligned with the company's schedule. (5) If the company's schedule changes, it must promptly report to the Administration for revisions. (6) Children between four and ten years old and military police in proper attire and official insignia may purchase half-price tickets. If half-price tickets are sold improperly, the loss must be compensated by the salesperson. (7) Luggage transported through the Xiaohe-Lakeside section must be handled in accordance with the Administration's luggage regulations. (8) The duration of the joint transportation is not fixed and may be canceled at any time if the Administration deems it unnecessary. (9) These measures will take effect on the date of approval by the Construction Department.</p>
<p>Wuxi Changes and Widens City Streets The regulations for widening streets in Wuxi City were previously drafted by the County Construction Bureau, approved by the Construction Department, and submitted to the County Political Conference for revision and adoption for temporary use. They have been announced in newspapers, and the county has submitted them to the Construction Department for approval. Recently, Construction Department Director Sun, finding the regulations still inadequate, specifically instructed the County Government to revise them jointly with the Construction Bureau. The original order stated, "Received and noted. Upon reviewing the submitted regulations and maps for widening city streets, there are still inadequate aspects. The main purpose of widening city streets is to facilitate the majority of pedestrians and accommodate vehicle traffic. Examining the submitted street plan, except for the Guangfu Gate or Chong'an Temple section, which has already been widened, the entire city's routes remain winding, and the maximum width generally does not exceed twelve meters. The main east-west and north-south arteries of the city have frequent pedestrian traffic and should have wide sidewalks to avoid crowding. The width of the sidewalks should be at least one and a half meters, totaling three meters on both sides. With a street width of eight meters, removing three meters leaves only five meters for vehicles, which is insufficient. Furthermore, the ratio of sidewalk width is also inappropriate. It must be understood that widening existing streets should not only consider current needs but also anticipate future needs, achieving a one-time widening to avoid the loss of repeated demolitions. The city's east-west and north-south directions should have one straight through-line in each direction. Obstacles within the routes should be removed during the widening, and the width, including sidewalks, should be twelve meters. Immediately comply with these instructions and direct the County Construction Bureau to revise separately, resubmit them to the County Political Conference for approval, and submit them to the Department for record. Other secondary streets and lanes should be reduced accordingly based on needs. Submit another case for approval."</p>
<h3 id="e290">Recent Conditions of Zhejiang Province's Highways <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Highway Bureau in Zhejiang Province, it has spared no effort in planning and implementing road construction and traffic, leading the country's provinces. Here is a brief description of the recent conditions of various roads that have been opened to traffic:</p>
<p>Xiaoshao Section The Xiaoshao section is the origin of provincial roads, built by Lu Zihai when he governed Zhejiang, converting soldiers into laborers. It has been open to traffic for over five years. This section is the eastern part of the Hangzhou-Shaoxing line, starting from the Jiangbian in Xixing and ending at the Five Clouds Gate in Shaoxing. Xiaoshao counties are rich in products and have a large population, with a relatively affluent local lifestyle. With recent improvements over the past two years, business has gradually increased. Currently, the average daily business is approximately 1,300 yuan, making it the leader among all road sections.</p>
<p>Gongsang Section The Gongsang section is the southern part of Hangzhou-Shaoxing, connecting the Xiaoshao section, serving as the central hub of eastern and western Zhejiang and the throat of the Qiantang River Canal. It starts from the Sanlang Temple in Jianggan and ends at the Gongchen Bridge. It opened to traffic in August of the 17th year. After opening, passenger convenience and business developed rapidly. However, in the summer of the 18th year, during the West Lake Expo, ticket holders could ride for free, completely sacrificing the section's business for five months, resulting in vehicle and business losses of over 100,000 yuan. It gradually recovered after reorganization. Recently, it has further developed, with average daily business of approximately 600 yuan. However, the section passes through the central area of Hangzhou, where the essence is concentrated, resulting in many short-distance passengers, but there are too few branch stations, causing public inconvenience. If more branch stations could be established, it would not only develop business but also greatly benefit the public. Currently, the city area is vast, and the public's needs are not limited to this line. There are plans to open new lines and increase vehicles, which will greatly benefit Hangzhou's industrial and commercial enterprises. There is also a branch line to Liuhu, connecting the Lakeside to the Liuhe Pagoda, specifically for tourists, which is more developed in spring and autumn. In addition, there is a movie special bus, set up to facilitate power plant users to watch movies.</p>
<p>Hangchang Road Hangchang Road is a national highway between Beijing and Hangzhou, a section of Zhejiang Province, stretching from Hangzhou City to Changxing County, bordering Jiangsu Province. Due to the incomplete construction of the Jiangsu section, it cannot directly reach the capital. Business has not fully developed, and because it has not been open for long, the public is not yet accustomed to taking steamships and automobiles. Furthermore, a section is exclusively franchised by a commercial company, affecting business. Currently, the average daily income is approximately 600 yuan. Furthermore, the Hangmo section directly reaches Mogan Mountain, specifically for Chinese and foreign visitors in the summer. To facilitate travelers, joint transportation arrangements have been made with the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, which has been effective. In short, if the Beijing-Hangzhou road can be completed soon, business development is unlimited.</p>
<p>Yinfeng Section Yinfeng Section starts from Ningbo City and ends at Fenghua, an important route for eastern Zhejiang traffic. The section passes through areas rich in production, also handling freight transportation in addition to passengers, to aid in industrial and commercial development. Since its opening in May of the 18th year, it has gradually developed. The average daily income is now approximately 500 yuan. There are several branch lines on the entire line that have not yet been built. If they can all be completed, traffic will be more convenient, and business will naturally flourish even more.</p>
<p>Hangping Road Hangping Road opened to traffic in April of the 19th year. It now reaches Zhapu directly. The Zhapu-Pinghu section is still under construction and will soon be open to traffic. The road mostly follows the sea dike and is an earthen road. It must stop operating when it rains, making it difficult to develop business. The average daily income is only about 200 yuan. Efforts are currently being made to improve the road. If the entire road surface can be completed soon, it will not be difficult to develop business.</p>
<p>Hangchang Road Hangchang Road is a key route between Zhejiang and Anhui, with extremely important traffic. However, the Hangzhou-Yuhang and Yuhang-Lin'an sections have been contracted to the commercial Hangzhou-Yuhang and Yuhang-Lin'an companies. The Highway Bureau's construction only extends from Hualong to Changhua. To facilitate travel, it first opened the section from Hualong to Zaoxi in September of the 19th year and then continued the line from Zaoxi to Qianshan on October 1st. The Changhua section is expected to open to traffic within a month. Currently, the routes mostly pass through remote towns with few travelers. The average daily income is only about 50 yuan. In the future, once the entire Zhejiang-Anhui line is open to traffic, travelers between the two provinces will not have to detour, and the business prospects will naturally improve steadily.</p>
<h3 id="e291">StudeBaker Sales Are Booming <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>Since the Hengmao Automobile Company of this city became the manager of Studebaker automobiles, the business has developed rapidly, taking on a thousand-mile-a-day momentum. In the recent week, buyers of the company's automobiles include Mr. Lin Kanghou, who purchased a six-cylinder Studebaker sedan, Mr. Yu Zhendong, who purchased an eight-cylinder Commander sedan, and Mr. Zhu Yicai, who purchased an eight-cylinder Director sedan. Since purchasing, all have praised the economy and durability of the vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="e292">Ford Sheng Tractor Road Construction Demonstration <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>As shown in the picture, a portion of the road construction equipment using the Ford Sheng tractor was photographed outside the Ford Manager's Office, Henry Automobile Company, in Nanjing. During the National Conference, this type of tractor was used to demonstrate various road construction and agricultural tasks in Nanjing. At that time, thousands of people flocked to see it, marveling at its ingenuity.</p>

<p>— Xian Liang</p>
<p>— London Newspaper Exhibition</p>
<p>On May 14th, the newspaper exhibition organized by Leder opened at the headquarters of the Institute of Journalism in London.</p>
<p>The exhibits include various British newspapers from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. These newspapers from the past three centuries were collected by Mr. Andrews, the honorary curator of the London Institute of Journalism library. His collection this time is extremely rich, and the British public has indeed helped him a great deal. They generously participated in the exhibition with those very old newspapers and historically important records. Among them, the records of the trial and execution of Charles I are particularly valuable.</p>
<p>Many valuable ancient newspapers from Henry Hill are also very important exhibits in the exhibition. Henry Hill is the general manager of the British Hill Company. However, his valuable exhibits arrived late for the exhibition, and most of the visitors did not have the opportunity to appreciate them.</p>
<p>From those exhibits, many important records of newspapers can be found—</p>
<p>In 1588, the Spanish Armada's invasion of England was indeed the impetus for the emergence of newspapers. The appearance of the Armada itself was communicated throughout the country by beacon fires. At the same time, some writers reported news of the war through correspondence. Anyone who paid these writers could receive their correspondence.</p>
<p>Printed newspapers only officially became a tool for disseminating news when the "Thirty Years' War" broke out, but there was no fixed publication schedule.</p>
<p>On August 2, 1622, Nathaniel Butter published "Weekly News," which was the initial creation of a regular newspaper. "Weekly News" is still published today, but it has been changed to the words "God's Help."</p>
<p>On December 20, 1636, a woodcut picture called "The Strange Out-pouring of Fire" was published. This was the beginning of newspapers with pictures.</p>
<p>On March 11, 1705, The Daily Courant was published, which was the pioneer of daily newspapers.</p>
<p>In 1721, the first evening newspaper, The Evening Post, appeared.</p>
<p>In 1722, the oldest morning newspaper, The Morning Post, was published. Three copies of it are on display in the exhibition, and it is still being published in England today.</p>

<p>A Twenty-Member Committee to Investigate and Research</p>
<p>New York News: The American Chamber of Commerce has now notified various local chambers of commerce to each recommend around fifteen experts to form committees, separately establishing departments for commerce, agriculture, and finance, etc., to thoroughly research methods for economic recovery. So far, committees have been organized for agriculture, urban development, domestic distribution, as well as nine departments such as finance, foreign trade, insurance, manufacturing industry, natural resources, production, and commercial associations. A total of twenty committees will be formed before the Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting in New York on June 26th and 27th. The International Chamber of Commerce also strongly supports this movement and is working together to promote it. Such a large-scale investigation into economic conditions and research into methods for economic recovery is a pioneering endeavor, and the initiators have high hopes for achieving results, it is said.</p>

<p>Restricting the Military Force of Colonial Police</p>
<p>Geneva News: The Council of the League of Nations plans to convene a conference on colonial issues in February of next year. The purpose is to find ways to restrict the use of all military weapons by police officers in various colonies. In recent years, the national liberation movements in colonies around the world have become increasingly fierce, and many are collaborating with the Third International. The Third International is using colonial national liberation movements to promote communism. The increase in colonial communism is due to the excessive oppression by the ruling countries. In view of this, the League of Nations plans to convene a conference to restrict the military weapons used by colonial police and to require each member state to report on the status of its colonies annually, it is said.</p>
