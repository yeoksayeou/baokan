<h3>世界之减俸潮流</h3>
<p>日本之官吏减俸經過重大之風潮政会堅持於上官吏不得已而屈服乃得告一段落焉今日柏林電德政府爲財政艱難故將發布緊急命令除加重所得稅及各種稅率外官吏及公家服務人員之薪資亦將减低是德國之减俸亦將實行據德報意見謂人民生活程度將驟降失業人數將驟增思想將愈趨激烈恐因此促成重大之政潮則德國之减俸勢亦將不能無事惟在國家艱危之際政府果爲維持財政上正當用途不得已而爲此者則非特官吏具愛國之心不敢强硬反抗即人民稍增負担亦終必勉强承受而後已也</p>
<p>更據世界社消息歐美各國先後實行减俸政策意國於去年十二月起官吏俸給减去一成二年俸高者减去三成半英國雖未正式减俸但依財長提案由各總長公議於二月起减俸一成大法官則贊成二成其他若比利時若波蘭若阿眞廷均已有减俸之議即澳洲各州中亦有减俸者可見减俸已爲通行世界之舉蓋各國同在財政困難之情况下人民負擔旣增無可增則官吏亦應稍加負擔以共甘苦故各國倡議减俸官吏皆無敢顯然反抗者日本雖經兩度反抗而亦終於實行故可知官吏减俸之潮流更將盛行於世界</p>

<p>乙組東吳晏成各四十八分成績相並錦標發生問題大會雖决議由接力之勝利者得但東吳以不合規則批議結果仍照大會决議執行由晏成得之然事後思之晏成亦頗險矣</p>

<p>胡庶華演詞略謂兄弟自當選爲本市出席代表後即覺才力淺薄不克勝任但覺此種事情實爲義務故亦不敢推却但此次大會提案有一定範圍瑣細者槪不討論故所决議者都屬犖犖大業現在對於這種議决案應當有三種運動即廢約運動守法運動建設運動廢約應有三種方法（一）喚起國内民衆（二）聨絡世界上以平等待我之民族（三）敬告帝國主義者國内之主持正義人道之人士使表同情於我們俾容易達到目的約法亦已擬定但必須民衆一致遵守方能發生效力現在兄弟就將約法中關於民衆所要曉得的幾點約略報告一下希望以後時時刻刻加以注意建設是訓政時期中最重要的工作也是要達到憲政時期唯一的過程希望各位民衆遵照約法規定的程序帮助政府來做工作最後我們對於烟禁一定要嚴厲施行蓋欲强國必先强種也云云</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>情田之花無論寒暑四時不萎</p>
<p>情海中之波浪往往織成悲恨之紋</p>
<p>恨綺愁羅不如蓬門畫眉此中可見情之眞諦</p>
<p>旅程中有情侣爲伴每覺舟車之速率加倍</p>
<p>赴情侣之約雖乘飛機猶嫌其遲</p>
<p>人生半世在牀上故被褥不得不適體</p>
<p>情人之言雖輕微聽之亦如清夜之鐘</p>
<p>人之有男女猶物之有水火水火旣濟乃可應用以水澆火火乃立熄以女馭男馴如綿羊此現代各業之所以盛行女職員歟</p>
<p>男子之娛樂在妓院女子之娛樂在寺觀所以和尙與妓女其價值相等</p>
<p>情之化學雖化學博士尙不能分析之</p>
<p>鬼不論其有無能說便佳情不論其有無說便不佳故持佛之言情不如東坡之談鬼</p>

<h3>記李登演誦</h3>
<p>— 絜非</p>
<p>比國誦演家李登Liten近銜比敎部命來華考察敎育初抵海上即小試新聲於光華大學曾售三元一座之票價頃來首都中大敦請獻技更允自由聽誦考演誦於中國爲創舉故一時中外人士聞風嚮往</p>
<p>李氏高年而豐貌謙撝而特立一望即知爲不待粉墨便足以游獻人間者是日凡演誦法國名詩劇西特cid等二十四闋繼續兩小時而聲容自若凡哀歡悲喜呌嘯叱咤强弱疾徐舒歌曼語莫不於耳目口鼻兩手之間活現其情其所誦大而風雲雷霆與夫愁人思婦百蟲之吟鳥獸之號靡不於其聲中傳之若乃豁然長嘯則門窗每振振作聲使聽者悚然醒瞿然驚恐奮而莫知所措其感人如此李氏其至情人耶</p>
<p>絜非曰誦演亦猶中國之獨脚戲乎其肖情不使人有片刻之感雖久而仍如在繞梁間也詩人戲劇家始能之亦惟知音者而後始得其樂也</p>
<h3>古城顧曲雜記</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主自平寄</p>
<p>楊小樓自去年由滬回平後精神頗佳余抵平後此老連演冀州城拿高登盜御馬刺慶忌諸名劇而生平最爲得意且從未演過这「法門寺」（飾趙廉）亦居然與「挑華車」同時演唱此種良緣眞所謂祗可倖遇而不可强求者也據小樓告余渠於鬚生戲當年曾下過一番苦工除法門寺業已貼演外尙有「全部四郎探母」一劇亦爲傑作現正從事整理不久亦須與顧曲諸君相見於氍毹之上果爾則平人士之耳福眼福爲不淺矣</p>
<p>余叙岩自前歲演第一舞臺義務戲「一門忠烈」以後從未登臺一演好曲之士無不興此人不出其如蒼生何之感據余所知叔岩嗓子依然如昔惟高音亮音未免稍差至所以不登臺之故尙有其他種種特殊原因並非專爲嗓子不佳也此次蓓開高亭來平收音對於叔岩並抱有極堅實之决心自抵平後經各方之種種探討熱度因以大減而叔岩爲保持身價起見對於代價問題當然亦不肯稍予變通致結果由積極一變而爲消極此二公司之所以未灌余音之眞相也</p>
<p>坤伶聲勢以雪豔琴爲最健其次當數杜麗雲麗雲近來對於藝術方面確有極神速之進步其嗓音寬而且亮並有極甜潤之水音不如其他坤伶之尖銳細窄刺耳難聽也上星期四五兩夜在開明演「四郎探母」及「貂蟬」探母夜因大雨大風上座不免稍減貂蟬係王瑤卿新編佳劇故未到開演時間而樓上樓下俱已宣告客滿其魔力誠不小是夜瑤卿親自在場指示跑進跑出至形忙碌余問其辛苦否瑤卿笑曰只要徒弟出風頭辛苦一點算得什麽聞者皆爲之軒渠不已</p>
<p>華慧麟亦大進步余觀其「頭二本虹霓關」及「鴻鸞禧」「寳蓮燈」三齣以鴻鸞禧爲最滿意因慧麟身段嬌小態度活潑固宜於花旦劇者也</p>
<p>雪豔琴之戲有二種成分在内小雲其表蘭芳其骨不但唱好做好而其「身段」「臺步」「武工」「舞姿」「扮相」念白」等等亦無一不好無怪聲勢煊赫而無人與敵也余嘗謂雪六之戲在現時已足與四大名旦抗衡再事精研或有更美善之一日余之所望於雪六者至深且切幸雪六再鼓餘勇日進不懈俾爲坤伶界開從來未有之新紀錄焉</p>

<h3>黄海環遊記（一八）</h3>
<p>— 黄炎培</p>
<p>一九一七年我遊日本參觀東京高等工業學校校長手島精一郎年七十多了知我提倡職業敎育狠殷勤地招到他家　對吾說你們中國居然提倡職業敎育麽吾們日本但知提倡爲資産階級幫助殖産的實業敎育那裏顧到爲勞動家解决生計問題的職業敎育呀我老了你們好好去幹將來大衆總有覺悟的一天哩我聽了大感動以後時常通信不到幾年老人下世了他的遺墨我還鄭重地保存着這番到日本老人墓木已拱了可是職業敎育郤成爲最時髦的一名詞幾幾乎有全國敎育職業化的趨勢不出老人的預料</p>
<p>講到敎育問題小學學生年齡還小大學呢學生比較的還能自己解决就是中學上海俗話「尶尬」透了從前謬誤的見解說中學是養成社會中堅人物的——這就是當時日本敎育家的曲解難道大學畢業反不配做中堅人物嗎有的只認中學做大學的預備而没有顧到中學畢業生中間至少過半數力不能升學的怎樣安放呢就爲中學制度没有定得妥當弄得大多數中學生畢了業没有辦法——在這種不不合理的敎育方針底下大學生畢了業也没有辦法但尤其是中學生——以致對於思想問題平空添出無數强有力的響應者日本到了最近看破了這點恍然大悟首從中學制度上痛快地改革把中學分做兩下一是預備就職業的各種課程都依他職業上的需要不用說了一是預備升學的但也規定有若干時間擔任料理自己生活或學校公共生活的工作呌做作業科他們中學鹇制的要點在養成社會生活上適切有用的知能獨立自主的精神愛好勤勞的習慣（參看三月七日本報）這新制就從四月一日起實行的呀</p>
<p>他們還在那裏鼓吹小學注重職業陶冶還不够要把義務敎育從六年延長到八年使受强迫職業補習敎育</p>
<p>他們用政府的力量辦各地靑年團普及全國着重三點第一體格鍛鍊第二人格訓訓練第三就是職業訓練呀</p>
<p>他們的女子職業狠發達凡交通機關商業機關行政機關的助手祗須女子能做的都讓給女子可是他們一方面用化學來解决烹飪問題絶對的接受科學更絶對的接受世界思潮一方面還是保存他們的木屐和背包决没有自己感覺落伍引爲慚愧回看吾們中國但論女子頭部己不勝若干度浛桑之感呀</p>

<h3>未來世界（四）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>我心裏又想隔壁人家講話我若不用心去聽就是當面講着也是充耳不聞我試用心傾聽愈聽愈遠在數十里外的輪船激水聲音我就聽得清楚因北想到這一條船裏的景象無不歷歷在目我又試把一杯清水加點顔色給人嘗嘗說是黄酒那人初說不是我用一個「他心通」的强力拿我的「心電曲去吸引他認定這是美酒自己試嘗一口覺得其味甚美嘖嘖不已於是再呌他嘗他也辨出滋味來了我知道他的心已經和我一樣彷彿磁鐵似的起了作用於是我呌他看雲我說像什麽他也認可是什麽了再進一步我就把五十年後新世界有聲影片告訴他說明我這心電作用比那影片中的電學還要進步問他看過那影片没有他說還未看過我就在粉壁上憑空一指呌他用心注目而視居然視而能見再呌他傾耳而聽居然聽而能聞後來他把所見所聞去告訴朋友那朋友原是看過這影片的他說一點不錯奇怪極了馬上趕來要我傳授心法我就因此收了許多學生成立了一個心電專門學校在這現在世界之中你所想的未來世界科學上的進步不知比我現在的心電學怎樣你可回講一點兒給我聽聽我於是不慌不忙的疊起兩個指頭來向他一指道你有這個軀殻留在世界上仍是累贅得很我想未來世界的人類進化一定能彀取精棄滓彷彿化學藥品一般只把所含的精提煉出來把那渣滓棄了一個人的精神如果能彀提煉出來一定可以脫離軀殻和封神榜上的哪叱一樣可用蓮花來做化身但是用着蓮花來做賦形的物質還是落了下乘譬如由蝦蟆取用蟾酥你用麵粉去吸收他這麵粉有何用處仍是一個無用的贅疣人的身體就和吸收蟾酥的麵粉一樣不過是最初一步的賦形物因爲蟾酥容易揮發不得不用麵粉來賦形以便久存所以人生之初不得不有軀殻彷彿和裝氣體的鋼筩一樣等到實用氣體的時候把裏面的液化氣體完全放了出來作爲用途之後這鋼筩也就無用正和人的精神完全用到事業上去了之後這個軀殻也就無用</p>

<h3>北行散記</h3>
<p>— 安平</p>
<p>十八　西山</p>
<p>這次在北平頂可引爲遺憾的是没玩透</p>
<p>雖然家裏來信說没玩透也好因爲這樣所以留下一個北平必須再去的印象但這祗是一種安慰到了北平又爲什麽不玩一個爽快呢自然那根本因爲一切人事都是不可逆料了誰知道到了北平覺得住在北平一年半載也好的我後來又會在半天之内一個心血來潮又跑回了江南呢</p>
<p>因爲想在北平住久自然不忙好來不必一次吃玩况且冬天正刮風冷得使人没一絲勁淘伴們也說待太陽更暖的時候一起出去玩吧樹梢上染上一些新綵不更有勁嗎這些話自然都對就是自己也不願北國的景色第一次就給了我壞印象所以耐性住下讀一些書想玩不忙</p>
<p>是我到北平後第一個好天的那一天我想上故宫博物院去走一躺那時正是舊歷新年故宫以半價的票子開放七天這自然也是呌我想就去的理由但是一位朋友說他家有故宫的免票不用趕這半價的便宜待過兩天一起去吧這位朋友是一個愛玩的人說不去故宫於是說上西山西山是他們玩厭的但興緻却仍然和我一樣好那就古怪去是一起五個人加上五個　夫和五匹牲口就那麽算一隊帶了些乾糧先是經過頣和園又是玉泉山一路和暖的微風撫摩着我們驢是（老爺驢」跑不上但反正讓心在暢爽中洗一個澡也好有時也還有意跨下來牽着牠走過一個缺口或山坡這些全比騎在驢背上爲更有趣</p>
<p>西山頂有名的是所謂「八大處」但我得聲明我並没到理由是因爲太遠玩西山是偶而在高興中實現的事我們先到碧雲寺</p>
<p>碧雲寺這塊地方極好我們一直走上那以前曾經停放過總理的靈柩的大石室這石屋眞高形勢也好從大門跑上石屋得有十幾次的階沿每闪是幾十級所謂石屋自然四面都是石頭砌成的四週雕刻着無數的佛像石屋頂上還有五個塔我不想去形容它因爲我相信你必定在什麽照片上看見過的四週没有窗祇一扇門門鎖着我們不能進去屋頂上的塔似乎該從屋子裏面設法上去屋子還走不進自然更没有理由去想爬上塔頂去了</p>
<p>石屋的後面就是山山高像椅子的靠背山上有南邊不曾見的白皮松我該怎樣來寫出我對於看見了這白皮松的喜悅呢我想你可以想見在一片油綠裏掛着無數條的銀鍊眞是銀子一般的白耏　天有光彩我想如其是月夜該更有詩意樹是了不得的高人在那樣幽深的樹叢中徘徊一回是神仙的事樹的後面是山明靑灰色這些都使白皮松更其使人愛的</p>
<p>碧雲寺出來上香山寺這兒有好的樹有像中山公園裏的那樣好的樹的神調上熊希齡的雙清别墅裏去坐一回也不是十分好的地方不過安靜是它的特色</p>
<p>香山回來上臥佛寺臥佛寺裏有臥佛是不消說得的有臥佛的那座殿門是鎖上的所以要鎖上是因爲好去開爲什麽要去開呢理由極其簡單如此可以開口要香錢没有錢是不興的我想在西方的極樂西界裏也得有錢才可以極樂這話給佛家信徒聽了必定會不願意但是　　辦法事實這樣和尙是有名的吃四方的似乎正惟因爲有名便彷彿四方是應該給他們吃的了</p>
<p>臥佛身上披着一幅極大的圍綢說是慈禧太后做的還有無數雙鞋子是預備給臥佛用的所以其大無比</p>
<p>這座寺是破敗不堪的但是寺後的小小的山坡上看來其引人入勝則仍一北平的寺院的好看就在其　色之彩耀　許多景緻是看不到顔色的但在北平就例外比如樹是靑的屋是綠的房子是紅的或黄的還有牌樓等等什麽顔色的東西你看來便是什麽顔色北平的瓦大體上都是琉璃瓦發光有亮這自然是好看的最出色的一原因</p>
<p>回來天色還未現出薄暮在路上大家拼命的抽着驢子要它奔張君從驢背上摔下了地於是從放縱的空氣裏大家的心又變成嚴肅到頭他雇了一輛洋車先回寓我們仍然的那樣的笑談在路上忘了朋友的不幸</p>

<p>Chinese Nationalist Party</p>
<h3>Letter to the Compatriots of the Whole Country</h3>
<p>Determined not to neglect two basic tasks</p>
<p>"Suppressing the Communist Bandits and Implementing Construction"</p>
<p>Nanjing, May 30th, The Central Standing Committee passed the Chinese Nationalist Party's Letter to the Compatriots of the Whole Country, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Since our party eliminated the reactionaries and quelled the rebellion last year, it resolved at the Fourth Plenary Session to convene a National Assembly to implement the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. After six months of preparation, the meeting was held as scheduled on May 5th. National representatives from all over the country, from Mongolia and Tibet to overseas, with their fervent belief in the Three Principles of the People, jointly decided on the great plan for national construction at this grand meeting. The proposals at the meeting were extraordinarily enthusiastic, and especially the acceptance of all the Premier's teachings, the formulation of the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage, and the abolition of unequal treaties, were expressed with a full hall of enthusiastic spirit representing the unanimous will of the whole country. Our party is even more convinced that the program of the National Revolution and the construction of the Three Principles of the People are completely in line with the demands of the people of the whole country, and that the Premier's lifelong desire to present the party's propositions and expect the people to thoroughly understand and support them has now reached the point where the people of the whole country not only have a thorough understanding but also share the determination to work hard. This is truly inspired by the spirit of struggle of the Premier and the revolutionary martyrs for decades, and it is also a guarantee for the inevitable success of the great cause of national construction, which is enough to inspire us to rise up. After the National Assembly, the work of revolutionary nation-building has completely entered a new stage. Now that the Provisional Constitution for the period of political tutelage has been formulated, the theories, systems, and all the regulations of the National Construction Program carefully created by the Premier, which were previously only the responsibility of our party to promote and implement, have now become a common creed for the people to abide by. The fundamental spirit of the Provisional Constitution lies not only in stipulating the manner in which political power and governance power are exercised but also in defining the work that the government and the people should share during the period of political tutelage. From now on, the speed of the completion of political tutelage and the success or failure of the cause of nation-building, its glory or disgrace, the people of the whole country will truly share with our party. As far as our party and the government are concerned, if we cannot actively complete the political tutelage and construction to meet the needs of the country, then the responsibility we bear to the people of the whole country is even greater than the responsibility in the moral sense. It is true that after the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, the responsibility of the people is heavier, and our party must supervise the government to concentrate its efforts and actively and vigorously advance the work of political tutelage and construction, and its responsibility is also heavier. From the process of the National Assembly, to gauge the true demands of the national will, there is reason for our party to rejoice, that the policy of political tutelage and construction decided by our party since the Third National Congress and the policy outline of governance focusing on stabilizing order and cultivating the strength of the people decided by the Fourth Plenary Session are completely in line with the true public opinion of the whole country. And what is even more alarming for our party is that the needs of the internal and external environment no longer allow our party and the National Government to delay or neglect the political tutelage and construction and the stabilization of people's livelihood in the slightest. The most important resolutions of the National Assembly: externally, to abolish unequal treaties in order to realize China's complete equality and freedom; internally, the implementation of construction and the suppression of communist bandits are even more urgently demanded by the whole assembly, and they are willing to exert all their strength to see success. It is true that if China does not complete the work of political tutelage and nation-building as soon as possible, it will not be able to extricate the country from danger and difficulty and lead the country to freedom and equality. And if we want to complete the work of political tutelage and nation-building as soon as possible, then the first thing we must do is to eliminate the communist bandits who are the greatest scourge to the nation, and the second thing we must do is to implement various political and economic constructions. Only these two things are related to the rise and fall, survival and death of the country and the nation, and we should concentrate our efforts to seek common solutions regardless of the dangers and difficulties of the environment. The reason why the work of political tutelage, construction, and bandit suppression in the past has not achieved rapid success is partly because the government and the people have not yet been able to cooperate closely, and partly because the repeated uprisings of reactionaries have caused many obstacles. Before one wave subsides, another wave rises again. The government is already exhausted from removing obstacles, and the reactionaries take advantage of this to hinder the great plan of construction, which has caused our party and the government to often delay the basic work because of the need to take care of the symptoms. Now that the people of the whole country have clearly accepted the teachings of the Premier Sun Yat-sen and are determined to work with our party to save the country and survive, then our party can only dedicate itself to the country and the people by concentrating its efforts and striving forward, regardless of the environment, and always actively engaging in the basic work of suppressing communist bandits and implementing construction, without wavering, without slacking, without partiality, and without digressing, in order to surely achieve the goal and not fail the expectations of the people. It should proceed smoothly and without any setbacks. It is necessary to exhaust intelligence and loyalty, and catch up quickly to achieve it. If the inevitable obstacles and difficulties are unavoidable, it must also be met with redoubled hard work, struggle, courage, and vigor. The expectations of the people, the demands of the country, and even the observation of the international community have made it impossible for our party to delay or stop the current basic work, and there is no need to worry about anything else. The greatest scourge to the nation is the communist bandits, so all those who echo the communist bandits or cooperate with the bandits to contain the work of bandit suppression are enemies of the country. The most urgent demand of the whole country is to complete the political tutelage and construction, and the foundation of political tutelage and construction lies in peace and unity, so all actions that endanger peace and undermine unity are also naturally enemies of the country. The difficulties and obstacles that the National Revolution has repeatedly suffered in the past were partly due to the individualism and feudal ideas, and partly because the revolutionary goals could not tacitly agree with the true demands of the general public, and their success or failure was often contrary to the hopes of the reactionary elements who were intent on undermining the country. Now that the great cause of the revolution has penetrated the hearts of the people, and the completion of political tutelage has become the urgent demand of the whole country, and the destruction of the reactionary groups of the past is an obvious example. If there is a little conscience to distinguish between right and wrong, they should not go astray and forget to return. If they are recklessly disregardful and willing to be enemies of the interests of the country and the people, then the people have thoroughly recognized the meaning of nation-building and should not sit idly by and watch the overall plan of the country being obstructed. Our party should also supervise the government to cut down the current obstacles. However, there are those who want to repeat and clarify that we will never neglect the basic work of progress because of any difficulties. This is what the National Government and the people of the whole country should understand together. Any country in the world, when it is striving for rejuvenation and starting nation-building, will inevitably go through countless difficulties, and the longer the history and the more complex the environment, the more difficulties it will encounter, and the greater the achievements will be. All things that grow that are not afraid of the destruction of wind and hail and still flourish must be those that are full of vitality and have a solid organization. The construction of the Three Principles of the People will surely achieve final success. On the occasion of the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, we express the meaning of our party and announce it to the whole country, and we hope that our compatriots will work together to encourage each other.

<p>Central Executive Committee</p>
<h3>Admonishing Deng Zeru and Others</h3>
<h3>Willing to settle right and wrong in the future with a peaceful mind</h3>
<p>Nanjing, May 30th, The Central Standing Committee passed the following telegram to Deng Zeru and others: Guangzhou, Central Supervisory Committee member Deng Zeru, Comrade Gu Yingfen, Central Executive Committee member Sun Ke, Comrade Li Wenfan, Comrade Liu Jiwen, and transferred alternate committee member Chen Jitang, Comrade Chen Ce, Comrade Lin Yunhai, Comrade Deng Qingyang, all be informed. The comrades have been separated from the Central Government for not long, and there are many worries and doubts. At first, the sincerity of family blame has actually entered the trap of petty opportunists, giving the enemy a gap. They want to stop but cannot. Looking up to the gods, how can they not feel pain? The Central Government has been through thick and thin with the comrades for a long time, and the friendship is like brothers. Even if there are violations, we still hope to shake hands. Therefore, since receiving the telegram on the 30th, every time we receive a message, we are moved to tears. We are worried about the country and the loss of discipline, and we are also worried about the difficult environment of the comrades. Brief letters are constantly sent, and people are on the road, calling for peace and not hesitating to be exhausted. This is known to the whole country and understood by the whole people. However, rumors on the road make the situation more thorny. The Communists and other counter-revolutionaries actually want to place the comrades on the hot stove and draw half the wall to entertain themselves. This is not only not allowed by those who love the country and the party, but also not allowed by those who love the comrades. We are silent. The Premier entrusted the responsibility of the National Revolution to all party members. The National Congress of Representatives is produced by all party members. The Central Executive Committee is produced by the National Congress of Representatives. Chiang Kai-shek is elected by the Central Executive Committee as the Chairman of the National Government. According to the laws and regulations, the system is clear. Moreover, the National Assembly has been opened, and the Provisional Constitution for the period of political tutelage has been established. The progress and retreat of Comrade Chiang cannot be directed by a few people. This meaning is very clear and there is no need to elaborate. The Central Government can understand the illegal and irrational accusations of the comrades, saying that it is a temporary impulse and there is another reason. However, although the flaws of white jade can still be polished, the oriole is behind, how can it be avoided? This is what the Central Government is thinking about for the comrades. There are two ways to maintain a political group: one is to believe in each other in peacetime, and the other is to abide by discipline. Now, those who get along with the comrades gather suddenly and seem very happy for a while. However, recalling peacetime, there are people like Feng Dao, people like Li Chuang, and people like Shaozheng Mao. How many of the comrades can think of those who believe in the teachings of the Premier, adhere to the doctrine, and are consistent from beginning to end? The comrades went south to join the rabble. Their strength is not enough to control the arrogance and the law is not enough to benefit the rebels. They stare blankly and accompany them to paint the wall every day. Their pain is already difficult to express. Moreover, they have suspected of violating the Provisional Constitution and destroyed the guarantee of party discipline. Their progress and retreat are lost. It is worse than bandits and ends in misfortune. This is also what the Central Government is thinking about for the comrades. The great trouble of China is the communist bandits. The armies of Hunan and Jiangxi have been encircling them for a long time, and they are gradually searching and suppressing them. The destruction can be expected. However, since the change in Guangdong, the red energy has revived, and Wang and Zhang have echoed each other. The monument of great catastrophe has been destroyed, and the mouth of the Long Dyke will burst. If it is small, it will rot in Guangdong. If it is large, it will endanger the whole country. Who is the person who led the wolf into the house? Who is responsible for releasing the tiger from the cage? Comrade Chiang Kai-shek was ordered to suppress the bandits, and he has been working hard day and night. He has a definite plan, and the clearing can be expected soon. However, the comrades around him actually want to steal the arrogant robbery and use old tricks to relieve the siege of the communist bandits. If they do not wake up here and plan for the country, then the disaster of floods and beasts will be difficult to make, and the disaster of national extermination will be completed. The spirit of the Premier and the mouth of the world will not want to forgive the comrades, and the comrades' happiness in their will and their care in the chicken worms are also there. We hope that they will be thoroughly enlightened and not cause irreparable disasters due to a single mistake, and not destroy the long and glorious history due to a temporary impulse, and not lose the courage to turn back due to the bad environment, and not be swayed by villains and shake the goal of the revolution. The Central Government is willing to share the beginning and end with the comrades and has no prejudice. But considering that the party and the country have heavy responsibilities and the urgency of the matter, we specially sent a sincere telegram to advise. The Central Government adheres to the teachings of the Premier Sun Yat-sen and the entrustment of the whole country, and believes that only by urging the National Government to actively suppress bandits can we stabilize social order and clear the obstacles of political tutelage. A dispute between comrades and a temporary mistake, we are willing to settle right and wrong in the future with a peaceful mind. The comrades work together to encourage each other. The Central Executive Committee, 30th (31st dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, the Central Government sent a telegram to Xiao Focheng and others, saying: Comrade Xiao Focheng of Siam, Comrade Lin Zichao of Honolulu, Comrade Chen Yaoyuan, Comrade Li Xiehe of Shanghai, and Comrade Ma Xingqiao, all be informed. The Guangzhou comrades have misunderstood and abused the issuance of telegrams, arousing disputes. I am afraid that the comrades do not know the details. Now, a telegram to persuade the Guangzhou comrades is sent for your information. The text says: (The text is the same as the telegram to Comrade Deng Zeru, etc.). Please comrades cooperate in persuading them. We cannot express our longing. The Central Executive Committee, 30th (31st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhu Peide's Reply to Sun Ke</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Zhu Peide replied to Sun Ke by telegram on the 31st, saying: I just read the telegram from Qin and began to have doubts. Looking back at my brother's performance in Shanghai, his expressions were all to uphold unity as his duty and to resolve peacefully as his path. Even when he boarded the ship, he still took it upon himself to mediate. I deeply admired him, thinking that party affairs depended on him. However, after arriving in Guangdong, there was suddenly this telegram, which seemed to be from two different people. If it is really a hijacking, then the words are insincere and should not be discussed in depth. Otherwise, the telegram refers to nothing more than two points: one is that all the meetings of the Central Government are not a reflection of true public opinion, and the other is that the repeated civil wars are all due to one person. All the meetings of the Central Government have been participated in by my brother. If this is denied in one example, then in what way can the true public opinion be expressed? As for the repeated rebellions, the person who caused the trouble is using the heart of seizing power to carry out the reality of annexation and separatism. When the punishment was imminent, my brother agreed to fight against it. The form of it began to appear. Now he is defending it and setting up words to help the attack, as if he is even worse than the rebels. One person's body is contrary to this. According to the usual remarks, I suspect that it must not be his original intention. Moreover, the country is divided and the difficulties are increasing. Now that unity is achieved and peace is realized, the resolutions of the National Assembly are after the resolutions of the National Assembly. Fortunately, the Premier's teachings can be seen and implemented by the people of the whole country. Now Gu Chen and others are willing to be the leaders of the Rong and disregard the peace and unity supported by the people of the country. How is he different from the person who caused the trouble in the previous battles? Moreover, the communist bandits have not been quelled. At this time of suppression, anyone with a human heart should support the Central Government so that it can fully quell the great disaster. Now, on the contrary, he wants to subvert the central government, shake the foundation of the country, and weaken the morale of the soldiers in the front line, disrupting the unfinished work of the Central Government. He is only afraid that the communist bandits will be cleared and help them grow. The fate of the country will not be cut off and will be hastened. If the communist disaster is completed and the Divine State is destroyed, those who are happy to throw it away will not hesitate to see the vast Yu Ji become a bloody mess. It is even more unbearable to see the Mausoleum of the Purple Mountain handed over to the hands of 口口. This is what our party members cannot bear to say, and it is what the people of the country should fear deeply. All these righteous categories are known to the wise and virtuous. I hope that my brother will deeply remember the disasters and not fail his original intentions, uphold unity, and preserve discipline. Not only will the country benefit from it, but the spirit of the Premier in heaven will also be a model for it. Brother Zhu Peide bows. (31st dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Global Trend of Salary Reduction</h3>
<p>Japan's civil servants' salary reduction has gone through a major storm. The political associations insisted on it, and the civil servants had no choice but to yield, so it came to an end. Today, the Berlin telegram states that the German government will issue an emergency order due to financial difficulties. In addition to increasing income tax and various tax rates, the salaries of civil servants and public service personnel will also be reduced. The German salary reduction will also be implemented. According to the German newspaper's opinion, the people's living standards will plummet, the number of unemployed will increase sharply, and the ideology will become more radical. It is feared that this will promote a major political storm, and the German salary reduction will not be able to do nothing. However, in times of national crisis, if the government is doing this because it is necessary to maintain the proper use of finances, then not only do civil servants have a patriotic heart and dare not resist strongly, but also the people will have to bear a little more burden.</p>
<p>According to the World News Agency, European and American countries have successively implemented salary reduction policies. Italy reduced the salaries of civil servants by 10% from December last year, and those with high annual salaries were reduced by 35%. Although the UK has not officially reduced salaries, according to the Finance Minister's proposal, the salaries were reduced by 10% from February after consultation with the heads of various departments, and the Chief Justice supported 20%. Other countries such as Belgium, Poland, and Argentina have also considered salary reduction, and some states in Australia have also reduced salaries. It can be seen that salary reduction has become a global practice. Because countries are in the same financial difficulties, the burden on the people has increased and cannot be increased, so civil servants should also bear a little more burden to share the hardships. Therefore, civil servants in countries that advocate salary reduction dare not clearly resist. Although Japan has resisted twice, it finally implemented it. Therefore, it can be known that the trend of civil servant salary reduction will become more prevalent in the world.</p>

<h3>Party-Religion Conflict Escalates</h3>
<p>Government Orders Closure of Church Institutions</p>
<p>Pope Prepares to File Diplomatic Protest</p>
<p>Rome, 30th (Reuters): The Italian government has issued an order to close all Catholic institutions and offices in Rome. Police have now entered the premises to seize various documents. The government claims that this measure is purely temporary due to recent disturbances and therefore does not conflict with the treaty between Italy and the Vatican. The leaders of the church institutions, seeing the police action, only took out the church flags and religious instruments before going to the Vatican to discuss everything with the Pope.</p>
<p>Rome, 30th (Reuters): The Italian government has instructed the provincial governors to close Catholic institutions in the country as they see fit, and the Roman Catholic Church has also instructed the bishops to personally guide the Catholic Church in their territory to implement the Party's teachings. The Pope is now preparing to file a diplomatic protest with the Italian government against the anti-religious actions of closing Catholic institutions. Cardinal Lega, who was previously ordered to go to Bahia as the Pope's representative to attend the 100th anniversary of St. Anthony on June 11, has now canceled his trip. The Vatican's emphasis on the current situation can be seen from the cancellation of the Holy Communion Congress to be held in Rome this week.</p>
<h3>Spanish Currency Price Falls</h3>
<p>There is a trend to follow in the footsteps of the German currency after the war</p>
<p>Constant outflow of gold</p>
<p>Public panic increases</p>
<p>Madrid, 30th (National): The price of the Spanish currency "Peseta" has fallen, which is quite similar to the slump of the German Mark after the war. As a result, the government is very panicked. Although various methods have been taken to maintain it, the effect is minimal. The reason for the currency depreciation is said to be due to the outflow of gold, because the transfer of gold out of the country by the rich and the church has not stopped until now. However, the stricter the government ban, the more the people's doubts increase, and the price of paper money becomes lower and lower. The restriction on foreign exchange in banks also affects a part of the financial industry.</p>
<h3>Indian Muslims Hate Each Other</h3>
<p>Conflicts break out again on both sides</p>
<p>The second round table meeting is postponed</p>
<p>Solve social disputes first</p>
<p>Campole, 30th (Reuters): Religious festivals here led to conflicts between Muslims and Hindus. Yesterday, 4,000 Muslims tried to crowd into the Hindu residential area and were dispersed by the police. Today, the two sides fought each other again. The police were forced to open fire, wounding 11 Muslims and 3 Hindus. One Muslim and one Hindu died. People were shocked. All yarn factories and shops were closed, and pedestrians were prohibited from traveling on the road at night.</p>
<p>London, 30th (National): The Round Table Conference convened by Britain to draft the Indian Constitution has been postponed because India can solve its own social problems before holding the Round Table Conference. There are disputes between Hindus and Muslims in India, so Gandhi should be responsible for resolving them as soon as possible, otherwise Britain will use the minority committee organized by the first Round Table Conference to mediate the disputes.</p>
<h3>German Authorities Will Visit Britain</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (National): According to news from England, when German Prime Minister Bruning and Foreign Minister Cortis go to England, the Hamburg mail ship they are on will be welcomed by the British government sending the cruiser Vingisde to sail on the ocean surface to accompany it into the British port to show its grandeur. The agenda of the meeting was reportedly not predetermined, because the meeting was an informal conversation. British Prime Minister McDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson and Naval Minister Alexander will attend. The newspapers generally regard this move as extremely important.</p>
<h3>Germany Strictly Reduces Politics</h3>
<p>Save financial difficulties</p>
<p>Emergency order to be issued soon</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (National): The German cabinet will soon issue an emergency order, which has been submitted to the cabinet for discussion by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance today. The general idea is that although the level of domestic life has been declining day by day, the difficulties of the country have not yet reached the end. After this, the financial situation of the country will gradually improve. The content of the order has not yet been announced. According to the newspaper, the people's burden may increase from now on. In addition to the existing heavy taxes, a surtax will be added to the income tax, and the tax rate will range from 1% to 6%. The new tax will be named emergency tax. The salaries of officials and public service personnel will also be reduced. The taxes on sugar, cigarettes and gasoline will also be increased. The subsidies for wounded soldiers will be reduced by 30%. The country will also strictly reduce politics. All the savings from all parties can reach 940 million marks. In addition to offsetting the shortage of budget, there are still 200 million marks left for emergency expenses. The domestic newspapers have not yet made specific comments on this, but the general opinion is that the people's standard of living will be reduced unprecedentedly, the number of unemployed people will increase, and the people's thinking will gradually become intense, which may promote a major political tide. Furthermore, the subsidies obtained by European war wounded soldiers have been very small, and now even this must be reduced, which is really unfortunate.</p>
<h3>Conference on Restricting the Manufacture of Poison</h3>
<p>Representatives of various countries have different opinions</p>
<p>Geneva, 30th (National): The Opium Conference discussed today the methods of managing the sale of drugs. Representatives of various countries have very different opinions. Some advocated that each country should manufacture the drugs it needs for medical and scientific purposes in its own country. Countries such as Belgium, Poland, and Turkey stated that they have already established factories manufacturing these drugs in their territory. The German representative said that the amount of addictive drugs produced in Germany has now been reduced by half.</p>

There is special equipment in the driver's cabin to automatically adjust the air pressure.</p>
<p>Innsbruck, 31st (National): Professor Picard, who ascended to the sky by balloon, told reporters that he did not want to do a second experiment because he had a family and could not sacrifice himself for science. He had previously ascended because he did not know the danger, but now he has tasted it.</p>

<h3>Promulgation of the Provisional Constitution Declaration</h3>
<p>Hoping the people will unanimously and wholeheartedly support it</p>
<p>And hoping the people will assist the government in suppressing bandits</p>
<p>The Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China was promulgated on June 1st. The National Government has issued a clear order today (the full text of the Provisional Constitution has already been seen in previous reports). The declaration of the National Government's promulgation of the Provisional Constitution is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>The government, adhering to the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, under the guidance of the Chinese Kuomintang, bears the mission of building the Republic of China and completing the National Revolution. For six years, we have diligently worked. Recalling the early days of its establishment, it coincided with a time of great difficulty and danger. At that time, the Premier had just passed away, and the efforts of our party only extended to the corner of Guangzhou. Domestic warlords and foreign imperialists colluded in every way to hinder the success of the National Revolution, and relentlessly suppressed the revolutionary forces. The government's foundation was not solid and its strength was insufficient. It only relied on a spirit of perseverance, ambition, and resilience to fight against stubborn enemies. It was finally able to eliminate Yang Ximin and Liu Zhenhuan in the shortest time, removing the threat from our core, and then pacified the East River and unified the two Guangdong provinces. In July of the fifteenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1926], the preparatory work was completed, and the oath was taken to march north. In April of the sixteenth year [1927], Nanjing was established as the capital. By the end of June of the seventeenth year [1928], Hebei was secured, and on New Year's Day of the eighteenth year [1929], the national emblem of the Blue Sky with a White Sun fluttered throughout the country. Examining the reasons for the completion of unification, it relied on the loyalty, bravery, and self-sacrifice of the officers and soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army to achieve such success and invincibility. It also relied on the ability of our entire nation to distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil. They deeply hated the warlords and wanted to perish with them, while welcoming the National Revolution with food and drink, fearing to be left behind. The speed of the warlords' collapse was a major reason for this. As the Premier said, "Those who combine military force with the people are invincible." Unfortunately, although unification was achieved, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Fakui, Tang Shengzhi, Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, and others, in order to achieve their personal ambitions, followed in the footsteps of the warlords, held onto their troops, and rebelled against the central government. This government had no choice but to use military force to suppress them. Although the successive rebellions were quelled, the number of officers and soldiers who died in battle and the people who were displaced and suffered was countless. The destruction of material construction and the loss of public and private property were even more immeasurable. After the completion of unification, the people still had to make such sacrifices and endure such pain. Thinking of this, my heart is truly filled with guilt. Now, fortunately, the military affairs have come to an end, and the people have the opportunity to rest and recuperate. The country can enter the path of political tutelage. The government, in accordance with the late Premier's will, convened a National Conference in the capital to seek a long-term solution for the country's stability and security. Past measures were limited by the environment and may not have met the people's expectations. I was afraid of being blamed by the national representatives. However, the National Conference understood our loyalty, excused our circumstances, and did not blame us but instead encouraged us. They expressed extreme trust in the government. The government is even more vigilant and vows to move forward bravely, implement its original intentions, complete the entire National Revolution, and finish the great task of national construction.</p>
<p>The most important task of the National Conference was to formulate the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China. The government, in accordance with the resolutions of the National Conference, today promulgated the Provisional Constitution throughout the country. The Provisional Constitution will also take effect today. This Provisional Constitution was formulated by representatives of the entire nation and is the fundamental law for the period of political tutelage. Whether peaceful unification can be maintained, whether national interests and the people's welfare can be obtained, whether political tutelage can be completed, and whether constitutional government can be realized all depend on whether the Provisional Constitution can be implemented without hindrance. Therefore, the government will supervise civil and military officials to abide by and implement the Provisional Constitution. Those prohibited by the Provisional Constitution will not dare to overstep, and those urged by the Provisional Constitution will not dare to slacken. I also hope that all our people will understand this meaning, cultivate the habit of abiding by the law, and foster the spirit of the rule of law. Unanimously support this fundamental law of the country with all their strength. Those who dare to destroy the Provisional Constitution and take the opportunity to seek personal gain will certainly be sanctioned by the government in accordance with the law without any favoritism. All the people should also regard them as public enemies and not show any leniency. Moreover, this applies not only to the Provisional Constitution but also to all resolutions of the National Conference, which the government will solemnly implement, and all the people should also sincerely support them.</p>
<p>To achieve the early completion of political tutelage and the early realization of constitutional government, national stability and the people's ability to live and work in peace are prerequisites. The greatest obstacle to national stability and the people's ability to live and work in peace today is the Red Bandits. The Red Bandits, nurtured by Red Imperialism, seek to harm the survival of our entire nation. Their intentions are insidious and their crimes are serious, even more so than those of Huang Chao and Li Zicheng. In the past three years, the national army has been forced to quell rebellions and has had no time for other matters. These bandits have been able to take advantage of this opportunity to grow in strength day by day, spreading to provinces such as Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, where the suffering is especially severe. People are killed in fields, blood flows in rivers, cities are turned into ruins, and thousands of miles are reduced to scorched earth. This unprecedented catastrophe is heartbreaking to describe. If the Red Bandits are not wiped out, not only will the revolutionary work be unable to proceed, but the life of the nation will also be cut short. Since the military suppression was completed, the government has devoted all its efforts to the work of bandit suppression, gathering a large army in Jiangxi and Hubei, adopting a strategy of encirclement to cut off their roots and overturn their nests. The National Conference has also earnestly encouraged the eradication of the Red Bandits. This government should be even more cautious, urging the generals and soldiers to eliminate the miasma as soon as possible. I also hope that all our people will work together with one heart to assist the government in eliminating the Red Disaster. During this period of national bandit suppression, those who harbor ulterior motives, collude with bandits, or outwardly pretend to be virtuous while secretly obstructing the work of bandit suppression are traitors to the country and the nation. The government is determined to eradicate evil and eliminate all traces of it. All our people must not show any leniency to allow the flames of banditry to grow.</p>
<p>The greater the achievements of any cause in the world, the more obstacles there will be. Historical examples are readily available. The goals of the Three Principles of the People's revolution are so far-reaching that they cannot be matched by the revolutions of any other country. Therefore, the difficulties and obstacles in the revolutionary process are naturally incomparable to the revolutions of any other country. The government bears the heavy responsibility of revolution and national construction. In the past six years, we have already experienced all kinds of hardships. Future difficulties may be even greater than in the past. However, the government will never harbor any fear or hesitation because of the difficult and arduous environment, nor will it show any compromise because of the attacks and sabotage of a few troublemakers. We vow to follow the late Premier's spirit of fearlessness and strive to accomplish this unprecedented and great revolutionary undertaking. We will not hesitate to take on any grievances or sacrifices that are beneficial to the country and the revolution. In the past, even in the era of autocracy, there were pure officials who devoted themselves to the utmost until their death. How can the republican country of today not have public servants who devote their loyalty and life to the country? If we do not do so, the government will not be able to live up to the heavy trust placed in it by the party and the eager expectations and trust of all the people, nor will it be able to face the spirit of the late Premier in heaven. May all our countrymen take this to heart. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>General Order to Celebrate the Provisional Constitution</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Government issued instructions to its directly affiliated agencies to celebrate the Provisional Constitution, stating: "To order compliance with the matter, the Central Executive Committee's letter No. 405 stated that June 1st is the date of the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution. The whole country should hold grand celebrations and take a day off. All sectors should hang flags to mark the occasion to commemorate it. The case has been decided by the 141st Standing Committee meeting of the Council to send a telegram to all levels of party headquarters for compliance and to specifically request the government to circulate it to all agencies inside and outside the capital for compliance. This order should be complied with and forwarded to all subordinates for compliance with this order."</p>

<h3>Expression on Guangdong Affairs</h3>
<p>The National Government will issue a declaration to announce its attitude towards Guangdong</p>
<p>The Central Government deeply loves peace and is now focusing all its efforts on suppressing bandits</p>
<p>Daily News reporter interviewed Central Committee member Shao Lizi yesterday on Guangdong affairs and made the following Q&amp;A: (Q) I heard that Chairman Chiang will issue an important declaration on Guangdong affairs on June 1st. Can you briefly tell me the content? (A) Although this is the case, I heard that this article was published in the name of the National Government, not drafted by myself, and I do not know the content. (Q) Does issuing a declaration mean condemning and attacking? (A) As far as I know, it is not like this. Generally, it is to declare the National Government's attitude towards the Guangdong Incident to show the people of the country. (Q) What is your opinion on the Guangdong situation? (A) Although the Guangdong government has been established, its internal structure is also very complicated. The Central Government is still seeking a political solution and hopes to avoid breaking peace and will never attack resolutely. However, it is difficult to say whether war can be avoided. I think we should be calm about the Guangdong situation and hope that they will realize it on their own. This morning, the Central Government convened a temporary standing meeting and decided to send a telegram to the five Central Committee members in Guangdong to give loyal advice. Now the Central Government is still concentrating its military power and striving to severely suppress the Red Bandits in the three provinces to avoid the bandits from succeeding. (Q) Is the transfer of Xu Yuanquan's troops to Hunan a military action against Guangdong? (A) No. After the Central Army goes deep into the front to suppress bandits, there must be sufficient strength in the rear to strengthen the morale of the army. Moreover, it is necessary to add troops to garrison the recovered areas. (Daily News)</p>

<p>Cai Yuanpei Mr. Cai Yuanpei returned to Beijing from Shanghai yesterday and gave a speech to the press, saying, "I (referring to himself, Cai) stayed in Shanghai for many days to mediate the Guangdong affairs and have just returned to Beijing. After Puquan (Zhang Ji) went to Guangdong, he received a telegram saying that he would return to Beijing to report. He did not mention the Guangdong affairs. I met Liangchou (Wang Chonghui) in Shanghai. He hoped for peace from the beginning to the end. The various factions that are incompatible with each other are gathered together in Guangdong this time. On the surface, it looks very lively. In fact, they are purely emotional and regional thinking groups. They are combined for temporary interests and do not have any major claims in the positive aspect, so their unity is not strong. Now, the hope of the whole or the people is for peaceful reunification and the elimination of the Red Bandits, but their (Guangdong's) actions are creating opportunities for the Red Bandits everywhere. This is completely against the demands of the people. The Central Government loves peace and is consistent from beginning to end, and is still urging them to realize their mistakes with a sincere attitude. At present, it is focusing all its efforts on suppressing the Red Bandits to relieve the suffering of the people, and it will not affect the suppression of bandits due to the Guangdong affairs."</p>
<h3>Fang Shengtao's Speech on Guangdong Affairs</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence The Provincial Government held its 139th weekly memorial service for Premier Sun Yat-sen on the 25th. Fang Shengtao gave a speech on Guangdong affairs as follows: "Deng Zeru, Gu Yingfen, Lin Sen, and others opposed the Central Government in the name of the four supervisors. If this causes a war, it will just create an opportunity for the Red Bandits. All issues between the Central Government and comrades in the party can be discussed openly and properly. However, Gu and others rashly sent this telegram, imitating the tone of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang to attack the authorities. It is found that the four supervisors also opposed Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. Now they are picking up their leftovers. The points that they rely on as excuses are not only worthless, but also prove that Deng and Gu have forgotten the position of the supervisors. Guangdong is the birthplace of our party. Chen Jitang is responsible for guarding the territory. The Central Government entrusts him with an important mission. At a time when the Red Disaster is rampant, Chen should fulfill his duty as a revolutionary soldier, uphold the party's aim of suppressing the Red Bandits, and safeguard the late Premier's legacy of peaceful reunification. Looking at Chen's actions now, it is tantamount to fueling the flames of the Red Bandits. Various parties have sent telegrams to warn Chen and advise him to pull back from the precipice because the Red Bandits are already trapped layer by layer and can be eliminated with a finger. I hope that he can suddenly realize that he can eliminate the disaster of the Red Bandits to eliminate the endless legacy of our country and preserve Chen's past history of the party. This is a critical moment, and Chen can choose for himself." (May 26)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun's Talk After Returning to Hankou</h3>
<p>Five Points Published to Reporters</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence He Chengjun, Commander-in-Chief of the Wuhan Garrison, left Hankou at the beginning of the month to go to Beijing to attend the National Conference and report to Chairman Chiang on the suppression of bandits in Hunan and Hubei and to discuss the reorganization of the Hubei Provincial Government. Now that his mission in Beijing has been completed, he took a postal plane from Beijing on the 29th and returned to Hankou. He arrived at the port at 3:00 PM. All agencies and groups did not receive the news in advance, and due to the heavy rain, only Xu Yuanquan, Fan Shisheng, Xiao Zhichu, Chen Guangzu, and other members of the Chu Garrison attended the event. After getting off the plane, He went to the garrison to meet with Xu Yuanquan, Fan Shisheng, Xiao Zhichu, Wang Guangzong, and others to inquire about the recent bandit suppression situation in western and northern Hubei and agreed on a plan to completely eliminate the remnants of He Long's bandits, which was ordered to be implemented by his subordinates. Then, he met with He Hengfu, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Huang Wenzhi, Zhou Xingtang, and other members. He promised to respect public opinion and earnestly handle the requirements of He and others to instruct the garrison to eliminate the Red Bandits. Finally, he met with reporters and gave a speech, which was divided into five points: (1) The Guangdong incident is not a problem. When I left Beijing, I heard from He Yaouzu, Adjutant General, that Mr. Zhang Puquan had sent a telegram to Beijing saying that he had returned to Hong Kong from Guangzhou and would transfer to a ship to return to Beijing to report on the mediation process. It is said that many generals in Guangdong have realized their mistakes, and the Central Government has also decided on a solution, which will not affect the overall situation. (2) The provinces in the north are extremely stable. Deputy Commander Zhang and the generals in the north unanimously support the Central Government's peaceful reunification. (3) The suppression of bandits in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi will continue to be carried out by the original pacification troops according to the plan, and the bandit suppression work will not be affected by the Guangdong affairs. The local people do not need to worry too much. (4) The date of the new committee members of the Hubei Provincial Government taking office will be decided after consultation. The financial problem will be determined by the Finance Department. The Central Government's financial aid to Hubei of 300,000 yuan can also be remitted within a few days. (5) The issue of reforming the Wuhan Municipal Government will be decided at the next meeting of the Central Political Council. Roughly speaking, the municipal government will be abolished and a municipal committee will be established, which will be under the jurisdiction of the provincial government and will be organized by members from the provincial government and the Hankou Chamber of Commerce and other agencies.

<h3>Martial Law Implemented in Shantou Waters</h3>
<p>Attention to Chinese and Foreign Merchant Ships Coming to Shantou</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence After the change in the political situation in Guangdong Province, the people here still hope for peace, but the provincial government has prepared for military affairs. On the 25th, Huang Jian, the captain of the Guangzhou mine team, arrived in Shantou on the Dasima ship, bringing fifty 500-pound electric mines. On the 26th, he went to the sea outside Mayu to survey the situation and placed several mines in the center of the entrance channel. A letter has been sent to the consulates in Shantou today. From now on, all foreign merchant ships entering the port should know that the line from the southeast end of Deyu to Queshipai is a security line. Ships leaving the port should know that the line from the northwest end of Masha to the south end of Nanshan is a security line. Foreign merchant ships and warships, whether entering or leaving the port, must sail slowly when they reach the security line from the 28th onwards to pass through the security zone, and it is stipulated that the time for each ship to enter and leave the port is from 6:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. If there are questions on the guard post, they must be answered clearly in flag language to avoid misunderstandings and dangers.</p>
<p>Another report: Guangdong Province pays extreme attention to the sea routes. The coast from Haifeng to Shantou, where ships can dock and land, is guarded by marines, and it has been decided to place mines in Shantou, Shanwei, Aotou, Jieshi, and Jiazi. Guangzhou dispatched a ship on the 24th to cooperate with the Dasima ship to Shantou to place mines. It was decided to transfer Huang Renhuan's brigade to guard the upper reaches of the Han River and transfer two divisions of Zhang Gui's army to garrison Pingyuan and Jiaoling. A part of the Guangzhou Air Force will come to Shantou within three days. The landline from Shantou to Shanghai was not open on the 25th. (May 27)</p>
<h3>Gao Shuxun's Troops Defeat Bandits in Zhongcun</h3>
<p>Over 3,000 Bandits Killed, Over 1,000 Captured</p>
<p>Kong Bandit Attacks Wanzai, Repelled</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence The 25th and 27th divisions of the 26th Route Army under Sun Lianzhong contacted the 6th Route Army Mao Division, which attacked Ningdong Hucunba from Guangchang, after advancing to Luokou in Ningdu and besieged Ningcheng, the Red Bandit headquarters. Seeing that the government troops were advancing fiercely from the east, the Red Bandits moved their main force to the west to avoid the reality and take advantage of the weakness. Seeing that Zhu De and Mao Zedong had moved west, Sun and Mao's troops followed them to find their main force, surround them, and attack them severely. According to the news from the front, Gao Division of Sun's troops advanced to Zhongcun, the border between Ningdu, Yongfeng, and Le'an, on the 20th and encountered 30,000 to 40,000 Red Bandits. They fought fiercely from morning to night, blood and flesh fighting each other, and finally repelled the Red Bandits, killing over 3,000 bandits and capturing over 1,000. The remaining bandits fled in all directions. On the 21st, at dawn, the Red Bandits gathered the remnants and tried to counterattack, but they were eventually discouraged and retreated to the west. Mao Division of the 6th Route Army advanced to Dabu in Ningdu on the 25th and fought fiercely with the bandits for a day, killing more bandits and seizing more spoils. Lu Xiaochen, Hu Zuyu, and other divisions have recently been advancing from Guangchang and Nanfeng to Ningdu to increase their forces. Zhu De and Mao Zedong did not dare to spy on the east bank of the Gan River anymore.</p>
<p>The Communist bandit Kong Hechong's troops disturbed the northwest of Jiangxi and recently took advantage of the Red Bandit Li Can's attack on Yichun to surround the Wanzai County seat in three directions. They were repelled by the military police. The provincial government received a telegram from Xiao, the magistrate of Wanzai, on the 26th, saying, "The Red Bandit Kong Hechong commanded his fake 16th Army with more than 2,000 rifles, three times the number of people, and attacked the county seat on the morning of the 26th. Our garrison Zhu Brigade and Yi Regiment and the county police force were all commanded by Regiment Commander Yi to launch a fierce counterattack, engaging in fierce battles in the eastern, northern, and southern suburbs. The Red Bandits charged dozens of times, but they did not succeed. The Red Bandits were defeated and fled at noon. Our army captured more than 300 rifles from the Red Bandits and killed 50-60 bandits, capturing 70-80 alive." (May 28)</p>

<h3>Discussing Railway Negotiation Issues</h3>
<p>Planning to Jointly Organize a Monitoring Group</p>
<p>Shenyang City Investigating the Number of Rubles to be Redeemed for the Road</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence The Sino-Japanese Railway Negotiations are expected to open at the end of this month. Recently, Gao Jiyi is still staying in Tianjin and has not returned, while Japanese representatives Kimura and others are still waiting in Dalian for Gao to return before coming to Shenyang. Therefore, it is expected that the opening of the negotiations will be within the first ten days of June. The Liaoning Provincial National Diplomacy Association believes that the negotiations are of great importance to national rights and the people's lives. It convened an emergency meeting and decided to jointly organize a monitoring group with all sectors of society to promote the victory of diplomacy.

National rights are at stake, and the people's lives are at stake. We must unite and monitor to avoid being in a failed position. Our association, etc., has scheduled a joint meeting of all groups at the Youth Association at 2:00 PM on the 29th of this month (Friday) to discuss all matters.

<p>Northeast</p>
<h3>Establishing Joint Anti-Communist Measures</h3>
<p>Strictly Searching Entering Chinese and Foreign Individuals</p>
<p>A Harbin dispatch reports that recently, Northeast authorities discovered a Communist Party cell in Suifenhe. Captured members confessed that the Third International was directing international Communist activities along the borders of Manchuria, Suiyuan, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, aiming to create local terror. Upon receiving this information, the Border Defense Commander-in-Chief's Office immediately drafted ten anti-Communist joint measures and issued them to military and political organs in various regions.

(2) In provincial capitals, commercial ports, and county towns, local military, police, and inspection offices or defense battalions and police stations are responsible for carefully inspecting the luggage and packages of entering Chinese and foreigners to prevent Communist Party members from infiltrating. (3) Along waterways and land transportation routes, stationed route-protecting troops, railway police, and water police officers are responsible for inspecting the luggage and bags of entering Chinese and foreign travelers. (4) In provincial capitals, county towns, commercial ports, brothels, and hotels, military police and police officers will take shifts to inspect Chinese and foreign merchants daily, thoroughly questioning them to prevent Communist Party members from hiding. (5) Regulations will be established for rewarding and punishing officials for anti-Communist efforts, with rewards and punishments based on the number of Communist cases solved.

<h3>The Resolution Process of the Kailuan Coal Mine Labor Strike</h3>
<p>The Dispute Between the Railway and the Mines is Also About to be Resolved</p>
<p>A Tianjin dispatch reports that the Kailuan labor-management dispute mediation committee was established on May 14th. Later, at the request of the management, it moved to Tianjin for handling. On the 21st, representatives from both sides held their first meeting at the Industry Bureau. The management representatives present were Zhao, Assistant Manager of the Mining Bureau, and Berlin, Engineer. The labor representatives were Zhang Yutang, representing the surface workers, and Ni Changsheng, representing the underground workers. Ding Zhanmei and Guo Shaoyi represented the Industry Bureau, and Lu Tan represented the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, totaling seven people. Initially, the management intended to dismiss the workers' demands and instead propose a general discussion, avoiding the term "wage increase." Instead, they suggested calculating a "work efficiency bonus" based on the amount of coal produced each month, with three cents per ton, and an annual bonus of 15 yuan per person for surface workers. However, the labor representatives strongly opposed this proposal and insisted on discussing each item of the workers' demands individually. If the management indicated acceptance or opposition, they could simply respond directly without using other methods. As a result, the four meetings produced no results as both sides adhered to their respective positions. Finally, the management agreed to discuss each item proposed by the labor representatives separately. Ding Zhanmei, chairman of the mediation committee, found the time spent on debates between the two sides uneconomical. On the 25th, they switched to individual consultations, convening the management in the morning and the labor representatives in the afternoon, both at the Industry Bureau. They planned to reconvene representatives from both sides to resolve the issue when their negotiated terms were close. This approach proved effective over several days. As of yesterday (the 28th), a complete compromise had been reached. The main content is that wages will be increased by eight cents per worker across the board. The treatment for surface workers will include an annual bonus of 15 yuan. Regarding allowances, compensation, savings, and consolation money, the management will formulate regulations for submission to the Industry Bureau for approval after the new factory law is implemented. The management acknowledges that the facilities of the workers' children's school and the mine's hospital can be improved. The contracting system will initially abolish the second-tier contracting system, with workers directly contracting. The first-tier contracting system will be abolished after the registration procedures for surface workers are completed. Currently, the mine is acknowledging the agreed terms and must send a telegram to the board of directors in London for approval. A reply is expected around tomorrow, and both parties will sign the agreement at the Industry Bureau next Monday (June 1st). Thus, this major labor strike can be considered completely resolved. It is reported that after the wage increase, the mine's annual expenditure will increase by approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan. The workers stated to the management that the price of lump coal has increased by 40 cents per ton this year, which can result in an annual profit of more than 3 million yuan, and that the direct producers are these hard-working workers, and that the management will not suffer any losses.</p>
<p>The dispute over overdue fees between the Beining Railway and the Kailuan Mining Bureau was recently resolved after multiple meetings at the Beining Railway Bureau, attended by Chang Ji, Chief of the Accounting Department of Beining, Chen Shaoyun, Chief Auditor, Bo Lie, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Mining Bureau, and Luo Xuchao, Secretary-General. A general agreement has been reached for Kailuan to pay 1.15 million yuan as a settlement. The Railway Bureau has already requested instructions from Gao Jiyi in Beiping. The mediation was facilitated significantly by Hu Ruoyu, the mayor of Beiping. (May 29th)</p>
<h3>Further News on the Military Conflict in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>The Situation in Quanzhou is Approaching a Conclusion</p>
<p>The Situation in Xinghua Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch reports that the conflict between the troops of Chen Guohui and Gao Weiguo in Quanzhou, Southern Fujian, and the troops of He Xianzhu and Lin Jizeng in Xinghua has been previously detailed. After Gao Weiguo's defeat in Heshi and retreat to Fushan Yao, Chen Guohui dispatched Chen Peiyu's regiment in three routes to attack. Gao burned down the Shuangyang bus station and several bridges, firmly resisting. He also asked local gentry to negotiate with Chen's troops, who stated that the first step was for Gao to withdraw from Fushan Yao before halting the fighting, and the second step was for Gao to surrender his troops before ceasing the war. Gao refused, and Chen launched a general attack on the 22nd. Gao also fired back from the blockhouse, and the fighting was intense. On the 24th, Gao's blockhouse was destroyed by Chen's troops, and over a hundred soldiers were killed. Gao retreated at night, and Chen's troops occupied Fushan Yao early on the 25th. With his base lost and heavy casualties, Gao had no strength to fight and sent his chief of staff, Su Lixiu, to meet with Chen Peiyu to request surrender. Chen sent troops to escort Su to Heshi to meet with Chen Guohui. After negotiations, two conditions were established: (1) Gao Weiguo is willing to go to Nanyang, but Chen Guohui must protect his family property. (2) His troops, led by Gao Yangluo, will be incorporated into Chen Guohui's command and transferred to Honglai. Chen telegraphed the Security Office about the negotiation process yesterday to request instructions. The war in Quanzhou is nearing a conclusion. As for Xinghua, after Lin Jizeng retreated to Dazhen, He Xianzhu dispatched Lin Chunting's troops to garrison the county seat. Lin Jizeng asked someone to negotiate with He Xianzhu, offering to surrender three companies' worth of guns in exchange for a ceasefire. He demanded that he surrender all of them, which Lin refused. The two sides broke down, and Lin attacked the county seat from Dazhen on the evening of the 21st. Lin Chunting was unprepared, and the troops advanced to the city walls, breaking through the east, west, and south gates. Fortunately, Chen Meixiong's troops, dispatched by He Xianzhu from Putian, arrived in Xianyou and joined forces with the garrison troops to repel Lin's troops. On the 23rd, the Security Office, based on He Xianzhu's telegram, dispatched the Huang Maohe regiment and Xue Lvxin battalion of the 1st Marine Brigade stationed in Fuzhou to Xianyou via Yongtai on the 24th. They also sent staff member He Xinjun to Xinghua to meet with He Xianzhu to investigate the truth of the incident. (May 28th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Judgment on the Putang Dispute Case: After the Tongshantang Putang property was established as autonomous, it was handed over to the former Municipal Office for management. The original business operations continued without any differences. During the tenure of General Manager Min of the Municipal Office, the Songjiang-Jinshan-Qingpu Land Bureau strongly claimed that the Putang was government property and abruptly put it up for sale. The Municipal Office filed a case to stop it, but it was ineffective. Consequently, Lu Qing'an and others bid for the property and collected rent from various farmers, and applied to the county government for land registration and tax collection. However, the farmers generally believed that the property had been passed down through generations and did not recognize the ownership rights of Lu Qing'an and others, and continued to pay rent to the Municipal Office. The disputes had been ongoing for years, and although mediation was attempted, it was ineffective. After the reorganization of the District Office, Lu Qing'an and others hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the county government, requesting confirmation of their ownership rights. After repeated judgments, they were not satisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent it back for retrial. The civil court of Songjiang County Court repeatedly held hearings to investigate, and the legal representative of the District Office, Zhong Taishi, hired lawyer Chen Qiushi to defend and present various legal and factual points to refute the claims. They also summoned Putang tenants to testify, believing that the facts were clear. After the debate, a judgment was made to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit in the Putang dispute case between Lu Qing'an and the District Office. The litigation costs of this case were to be borne by the plaintiffs, Lu Qing'an and others.</p>

<p>False Fire Alarm at Zhongnan Theater: The entertainment scene in the county has been desolate for a long time. After the success of the Huaxing Cinema in the park last year, entertainment venues have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. This year, several new ones have been established, including the Wuxi Grand Theater, the Zhongnan Grand Theater, and the Xinguang Grand Theater. Among them, the Zhongnan Grand Theater is the largest in scale, followed by the Wuxi Grand Theater. Their daily business is also quite good.

Yesterday morning, Shen Ada, a villager, rented the boat from Wu Sanhe to sell silkworm cocoons in Pinghu and moored it outside the Gongyi pig shop in Dongmen. Xu happened to pass by and recognized the boat without error. He immediately called the police and impounded the boat and brought Shen Ada to the bureau. After Xu filed a request with the Public Security Bureau for investigation, the bureau ordered Lu A'kui and Wu Sanhe to come to the case. The inspector questioned them, and Xu Shiming explained the previous situation. Wu Sanhe confessed that he had bought the boat from Lu A'kui. Lu claimed that the boat was seized while intercepting salt smugglers last year and sold by the team headquarters. The inspector asked why the team headquarters had not issued evidence of the public sale of the boat. He ordered Wu Sanhe to produce the evidence of the team headquarters selling the boat.

<p>Rescued Meat Ticket Escapes by Jumping into River: On the evening of the day before yesterday, at around 9 PM, five bandits armed with pistols suddenly broke into the home of Xu Rongming, the village chief of Renli Joint Village near Baiqiao Liang in Yin County, Ningbo. Xu Rongming was unable to hide and was beaten, suffering injuries to his left arm and both feet. When Wan Liqing, a neighbor, heard the alarm and went to help, he was shot in the abdomen. The bandits then forced their way into the inner room and kidnapped Rongming's son, Shunpin. While en route, Shunpin noticed the bandits' vigilance had slightly relaxed. He immediately jumped into the large river in an attempt to escape. The bandits, due to the darkness of the night, were unable to find him and fired over ten shots into the water, none of which hit their target. When the bandits saw pursuers approaching, they abandoned their hostage and fled. Shunpin was thus able to survive, which is indeed fortunate.</p>

<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Careless Silk Reeling Crushes Two Children to Death: Xiang Shoubing, a resident of the Waisha area near Changhe Town in the western part of Xiaoshan, is a farmer with a reasonably good financial situation. This year, due to a large decrease in silkworm production and low cocoon prices, he hired workers to reel silk. However, on the morning of the 27th, an accidental spark ignited the straw shed, and flames spread rapidly. Because the area is sparsely populated, there was no one to help extinguish the fire. In an instant, the brick walls collapsed, crushing and killing two children, both around five or six years old. It was a truly tragic event.</p>
<p>Ruihe Bank Receives Another Threatening Letter: The Ruihe Bank in Xiaoshan city has received several threatening letters.

<h3>Games Award New Records</h3>
<p>Jinan, 30th Telegram: The conference gave special awards to all those who created new records in order to promote them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Men's Track and Field Results</h3>
<p>Team First Place Group A: Lie, Group B: Yan Cheng, Group C: Suzhou Middle. All Track Events Completely Break Suzhou Records</p>
<p>The results of the first day of the Suzhou Men's Track and Field competition were good. The second afternoon, the competition continued. The details are described as follows:</p>
<h3>New Provincial Record</h3>
<p>Completely Broken in Group B Track Events</p>
<p>Although the results of the Group A competition were good, no new records were found. Dongwu's Gu Shuxun vaulted to 3.23 meters at the Four Games due to a foot injury. Zheng Xueru, the champion of the 1500-meter long-distance race, is originally good at running 10,000 meters, so this was just a small test of his skills. In Group B track events, all except the high and low hurdles broke provincial records. Cheng Jinguan is truly extraordinary.</p>
<h3>Championship Problem</h3>
<p>Result Still Yan Cheng Wins</p>
<p>In Group B, Dongwu and Yan Cheng each had 48 points, so there was a problem with the championship. Although the conference resolved that the winner of the relay would get it, Dongwu argued that it did not comply with the rules. As a result, it was still executed according to the conference resolution, and Yan Cheng won. However, in retrospect, Yan Cheng was quite dangerous.</p>
<h3>Sword Gifted to Martyrs</h3>
<p>The conference gifts were countless silver tripods and silver cups. After the meeting, the awards were given by Huang Zhenwu, the commander of the military police regiment, and each one returned with satisfaction. According to the awards, the javelin and discus given by Le Yi Girls' School were the most special. When the awards were given, they were all regarded as "beauties give to heroes, swords given to martyrs," which was the most appropriate. The sun set on the mountain, and it finally came to an end.</p>
<h3>Overall Team Scores</h3>
<p>Group A: Field Events 1st: Cheng Lie 38 points, 2nd: Red Lion 34 points. Track Events 1st: Red Lion 50 points, 2nd: Cheng Lie 37 points.</p>

After about ten seconds, the aircraft leapt into the air and circled the sky. It flew higher and higher. At first it was still distinguishable, but then it became as small as an invisible dragonfly. Everyone applauded and cheered, and because the weather was clear and the air pressure was not low, the results may exceed expectations.

<h3>Ma Chaojun Travels East</h3>
<p>Planning to Transfer to Hong Kong to Visit Europe and America</p>
<p>A Statement Regarding the Guangdong Telegram</p>
<p>Ma Chaojun, former Minister of Training of the Central Government, resigned due to illness and came to Shanghai for recuperation. The Central Government has appointed him as a special commissioner for labor inspection in Europe and America. On the afternoon of the 30th, Mr. Ma and his wife took the Japanese mail ship Asama Maru to the east. He will stay in Japan for a while and then transfer to Europe and America for inspection.</p>
<p>According to the New Sound Society, Mr. Ma's residence on Tangshan Road told the New Sound Society reporter that Commissioner Ma will disembark in Kobe and travel to Tokyo. He will stay there for about two days, and then take the original ship to the United States via Yokohama. He will stay in the United States for several months, and then go to France to inspect the labor conditions of various countries. Before his departure, Mr. Ma saw that his name was listed in the Guangdong telegram, and he telegraphed Guangdong to declare that it was difficult to recognize without his consent. According to those close to Mr. Ma, Mr. Ma has a deep historical relationship with Hu Hanmin and is a Cantonese. However, he believes that the actions of the Guangdong committee members this time are detrimental to the overall situation and create opportunities for the Red Bandits, which he does not agree with. Therefore, he has to go abroad. As for Wu Zhihui's remarks about the guests, it is a misunderstanding that Mr. Ma is related to the Guangdong Incident.</p>

The results of the talks have been reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a second meeting will be held after receiving instructions from Nanjing. The details are not yet ready for publication.</p>
<p>National Assembly</p>
<h3>Representatives Gave a Speech in the Special District Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Party Department of the Third District of this city believes that although the National Assembly has concluded, all the resolutions must be achieved through the joint efforts of the people and the government. Therefore, according to the resolutions of the District Propaganda Conference, it convened a meeting of all the people in the district the day before yesterday evening, inviting the representatives of the National Assembly and Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the secretary of the National Assembly, to give a speech. More than 500 representatives from various groups attended. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman's Opening Remarks: After opening the meeting and performing the rituals, and commemorating the May 30th martyrs, Chairman Sun Mingqi delivered the opening remarks, stating that today is the day when the Party Department of the Third District of Shanghai convened a meeting of all the people in the district to respectfully invite the representatives of the National Assembly of this city and Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the secretary of the National Assembly, to give a speech. We see the enthusiasm of the people attending today's meeting and know that the people of this district already have a deep understanding of the National Assembly. We know that the National Assembly is an important meeting to ensure peace and unity during the period of political tutelage and the beginning of the people's participation in the government. Now this extremely important meeting has come to a very successful conclusion. However, the plans agreed upon at the meeting still require the joint efforts of the people and the government to achieve. For example, the Provisional Constitution (約法) passed by the meeting will be promulgated on June 1st. After the promulgation, the rights and obligations of the people to the government and the rights and obligations of the government to the people must be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Constitution. Therefore, before the implementation, the content of the Provisional Constitution should be clearly understood. Otherwise, we will not know the law or violate the law without knowing it. Therefore, the first meaning of convening this meeting in this district today is to make the people in this district have a clearer understanding of the Provisional Constitution. Secondly, before the opening of the National Assembly, the people of the whole country unanimously demanded that the National Assembly automatically abolish all unequal treaties. Now the National Assembly has automatically announced the abolition in accordance with the will of the people. However, how to prevent our Chinese nation from being invaded and oppressed by imperialists after the abolition, and how to make our international status increase day by day also requires the concerted efforts of the people to act as the backing for the government's diplomacy. Especially the people in this district, because this district is located within the scope of the concession, the suffering from unequal treaties is even deeper. The May 30th Massacre six years ago today, when corpses were lying on Nanjing Road in this district, was the fact caused by unequal treaties. The second meaning of convening this meeting in this district today is to make the people in this district get the way to strive for the abolition of the treaties. However, the significance of convening this meeting in this district is not limited to this simple meaning, but roughly it is nothing more than this. There are a total of five representatives attending the National Assembly in this city, namely Hu Shuhua, Wang Yansong, Wu Kai, Hou Dazhuang, and Chen Guansheng. We invited these five gentlemen and Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the secretary of the National Assembly, one by one in advance. However, as a result of the invitation, Mr. Wang and Mr. Wu could not attend due to business trips to Beijing, and Mr. Hou and Mr. Chen could not come because of other important official duties. Only Mr. Hu and Mr. Pan arrived today. Mr. Hu's and Mr. Pan's knowledge and morality have already made us extremely admired, and they have made very important contributions in the National Assembly. Now that Mr. Hu and Mr. Pan are willing to come and teach us, it is really an honor for the people of this district. After we listen to the speeches of Mr. Hu and Mr. Pan, we will definitely have a very clear and concise way to move forward together in the future. Now we will first ask Mr. Hu Shuhua to give us instructions.</p>
<p>Hu Shuhua's speech roughly stated that since the speaker was elected as a representative of the city to attend, he felt that his talent and ability were shallow and he could not do the job. But he felt that this kind of thing was really an obligation, so he did not dare to refuse. However, this conference has a fixed scope of proposals, and trivial matters are not discussed. Therefore, the resolutions are all major undertakings. Now there should be three kinds of movements for this kind of resolutions, namely, the abolition of treaties, the observance of laws, and the construction movement. There should be three methods for the abolition of treaties: (1) Arousing the people in the country (2) Connecting with nations in the world that treat us equally (3) Informing the imperialists of people in the country who uphold justice and humanity, so that they can express sympathy for us and make it easier to achieve our goals. The Provisional Constitution has also been drafted, but it must be observed by the people in order to have an effect. Now the speaker will briefly report on a few points in the Provisional Constitution that the people should know, and hope that you will pay attention to them at all times in the future. Construction is the most important work during the period of political tutelage, and it is also the only process to reach the period of constitutionalism. I hope that all of you will follow the procedures stipulated in the Provisional Constitution to help the government do its work. Finally, we must strictly implement the prohibition of opium, because if we want to strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the race.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan's Speech: Today, the Party Department of the Third District invited the representatives of the National Assembly of Shanghai to give a speech here. Just now, Mr. Hu Shuhua has given a detailed report. The speaker is not a representative, so there seems to be no need to attend, but the Party Department of the Third District repeatedly invited us, using a "dragging the husband" policy to achieve its purpose. But the "dragged husband" is difficult to have good skills, and I hope you will forgive me for this point. After the National Assembly is closed, Mr. Hu has given detailed instructions on the points that we should strive for, so-called "observing the Provisional Constitution and striving for construction." If we can earnestly do it, China will be able to realize the country of the people, by the people, and for the people in a few years. Chairman Jiang repeatedly stated at the opening of the National Assembly that our country has three years of "rest and recuperation" and three years of "education." All construction work during the six-year period of political tutelage must be completed as scheduled. Before the opening of the National Assembly, the general public thought that today the country is governed by the party, and the Kuomintang takes over the important tasks of the country. The public can ignore it. However, after the opening of the National Assembly, the status and concept of the public has changed and should change. Because the representatives of the National Assembly, in addition to the representatives of the Party Department, the remaining representatives are selected from agricultural, industrial, commercial, and freelance professional groups. Regardless of whether the representative is a party member or not, they are all in the capacity of representatives of the public groups to attend the organization of the National Assembly, and officially passed the provision that the Kuomintang's period of political tutelage is six years, and the party is responsible for training the people to exercise the four powers, and according to the party's guidance to build the Republic of China. Therefore, in the future, the Kuomintang's governance of China is not boasting and proclaiming itself as the only political party to govern China, but the public has a formal letter of entrustment to the Kuomintang to handle, and the Provisional Constitution passed is a formal letter of entrustment to the Kuomintang to handle all major state affairs. The responsibility of the public is not only to formally entrust the state affairs to the party at the time of the National Assembly, but also to supervise whether the party can earnestly follow the Provisional Constitution formulated by the public itself in the future, so the center of gravity of the National Assembly's mission is not at the opening, but after the closing. The major event is like a marriage. The opening of the National Assembly is like the wedding ceremony of the bride and groom. The groom is the party, and the bride is the representative. The closing of the National Assembly is like the end of a great happy event, but the true meaning of marriage is not in holding a wedding ceremony, but in shouldering the mission of racial life extension after marriage. Assuming that there is still no fat and healthy new life born ten months or one year after the marriage, the marriage will inevitably lose its true meaning. Why is the National Assembly not like this? In the National Assembly, in addition to the unequal treaties, the trend of education is determined, the Prime Minister's will is accepted, and the construction procedures are determined, etc. Each resolution has been passed, and a happy great undertaking has come to an end. However, after ten months or a year, in other words, after six years of political tutelage, whether a healthy and fat baby can be born as scheduled is indeed a serious problem. In other words, whether the constitutional government can be successfully completed after six years of political tutelage is a problem. If the party can devote itself to the mission entrusted by the people, and the people can relentlessly supervise the government and train themselves, then the realization of political tutelage is definitely not difficult. It is as if the party and the people have married and a fat and healthy new life is born. Therefore, the center of gravity of the National Assembly is not in the marriage, but after the marriage. How can we achieve satisfactory results after the closing of the National Assembly? We should pay close attention to and study that the bride has difficult labor and easy labor during pregnancy. The key lies in whether the bride can cherish her body, pay attention to her morals, and be cautious in her daily life and diet after pregnancy. Political tutelage is also the same. If the party can work hard to shoulder its mission and the people can devote themselves to training themselves, then the realization of political tutelage is definitely not difficult. However, there are also more than ten months of pregnancy without labor, and twenty months without labor. Although it is an extraordinary event, it is not unseen. Political tutelage is now stipulated for six years. Taking 1929 as an example, there are still four years left. The political tutelage can be completed and the constitutional government can begin in 1935. But no one can guarantee whether the constitutional government can be completed as scheduled by 1935. Some say that the Kuomintang hopes to deny and extend the life of its political tutelage. Otherwise, try to find the difference between political tutelage and constitutional government to understand. The key to political tutelage and constitutional government lies in whether local autonomy can be completed. If the population census is clear, the land survey is completed, the police guard is properly handled, and the people's four powers can be skillfully exercised, then the completion of political tutelage is definitely not difficult. Otherwise, sixty years is not enough, and six hundred years is not enough. The meaning of stipulating six years of political tutelage is to enable the general public to select officials and formulate laws. The Provisional Constitution states that "the people shall follow Article 8 of the National Reconstruction Program. A county must strive to complete local autonomy. After local autonomy is completed, the people can exercise the four powers of election, recall, referendum, and initiative in accordance with Article 9 of the National Reconstruction Program." If the people of this county do not complete local autonomy, they will never be able to realize the constitutional government. Therefore, assuming that the local autonomy of Shanghai can be completed as soon as possible, then a neighbor can elect a neighborhood chief, a community can elect a community chief, a village can elect a village chief, and a city can elect a mayor. The citizens of Shanghai have the ability to govern Shanghai, which is also to interfere in the politics of the central government and the whole country. If, after six years, the citizens of Shanghai are still treading water and have no way to use the four powers, then the proposals will be in vain and the construction will be empty. The constitutional government will have no hope of realization. Therefore, local autonomy is the only major work after the closing of the National Assembly. Otherwise, it is just empty talk and empty construction. The important resolutions of the National Assembly are passed one by one, but they are of no use to state affairs. It is hoped that the country will work together to establish schools and build roads and other local autonomy work as the only major plan. Everyone should do their best to help the central and local overall plans, and then strive for the realization of individual construction that can be realized. Local autonomy can be completed, the important resolutions of the National Assembly can be implemented, and a fat and healthy baby will be born here. The purpose of the period of constitutionalism and the National Assembly will be achieved, and our country will be permanently stable. Today, the Party Department of the Third District "dragged the speaker." I respectfully offer my humble opinions to the citizens of this city, hoping that they will work hard. Finally, the municipal representative Zhou Hanmei gave guidance, and the chairman gave a reply and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Guangxin Compatriots Please Send Troops to Suppress the Communists Quickly</h3>
<p>The letter from the Shanghai Fellow Association of the seven counties of Guangxin, Jiangxi, to the authorities of Beijing and Jiangxi is as follows (Excerpt): I have just received a report from the Shanghai Fellow Association of Yanshan stating that Fang Zhimin, a Red Bandit from eastern Jiangxi, led his troops to the border of Fujian a month ago to plunder. Recently, they have returned to the old nest of Hengyi and Rao. They have successively plundered Guangfeng and Yangkou, etc. As a result, the seven counties of Qian and Rao have fallen into the storm again. Thousands of people are displaced every day. Wang Mingui, a bandit from Qian and Shilu, has been extremely vicious. Recently, he has joined forces with Zou Qi, the leader of the Red Bandit from Xiamei, Chong'an, Fujian, to lead more than a thousand people from Qian to plunder Shidu on May 10th. On the 15th, the bandit mountain police team of Zixi ambushed the police and encountered them in Sunjiaqiao. Unfortunately, the difference in numbers was too great, and the bandits were used as a cover. The evil atmosphere has caused the cottages to be ruins. Qian is a small isolated city with limited strength. The defense area is very broad. Now it is in the midst of a blazing fire. The situation is critical and difficult to delay. The city is a vital passage for the Min, and the bandits coveted it. Once it falls into their hands, there will be no clean land in the seven counties of Guangxin. The fellows were shocked and terrified when they heard this bad news. They specially reiterated the recent situation and earnestly requested that troops be added and suppressed quickly, and that the provincial governments of Min and Zhejiang be notified to encircle and suppress on three sides. If the jumping clowns are not enough to be settled and the delay is allowed, then the tens of thousands of people in our department will have no chance of survival. Sparks ignite the plains, which the wise fear. Try to look back at your hometown, and few will not be turned into desolate weeds. Heaven and man are forced, and the virtuous are compassionate. Earnestly team up the words and ask for your understanding. The Shanghai Fellow Association of the Seven Counties of Guangxin, Jiangxi, respectfully</p>

<h3>Peide Female Student</h3>
<h3>Lin Lin Suddenly Arrested</h3>
<p>Accused of Having Reactionary Suspicions</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Did Not Provide Evidence</p>
<p>Released on Bail by Two Stores</p>
<p>Lost Freedom for Only Four Hours</p>
<p>Lin Lin, a female student from Hunan Province studying at Peide Girls' School and the Vincent English School, was suddenly arrested on the morning of May 30th and immediately sent to the Special District Local Court for questioning. The City Public Security Bureau sent inspectors to the court, accusing the female student of having reactionary suspicions and requesting extradition. However, Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, opposed the extradition, stating that the City Public Security Bureau had not provided conclusive evidence. As a result, the judge Wu Tingqi ordered the female student to provide guarantee from two stores to leave the court, and to be available for recall. If the female student failed to appear when summoned, the guaranteeing stores would be fully responsible. The City Public Security Bureau will be ordered to provide evidence for further verification. Therefore, the student was only detained in the waiting room for a short time before being released on bail. The details of her arrest are described as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Lin is from Changsha, Hunan Province, and is only nineteen years old. Her father, Lin Rutang, only had two daughters. Lin Lin is the eldest daughter and has a younger sister who lives with her parents at No. 6, Mawang Street, Changsha City. Lin Lin has a cousin who is a professor in Shanghai. Therefore, she came to Shanghai last April and entered Peide Girls' School and Vincent English School to study English. She currently resides in Puyili, Avonyi Road. She is quiet, gentle, frugal, and unpretentious, and has not been infected with the habits of fashionable female students. The arrest was caused by Zhu Baohua. Zhu is also a young student. Last month, an employee of the City Party Department found out that Zhu was affiliated with the Communist Party and was spreading rumors against the National Assembly. Because his residence was in the Public Concession, he informed the City Public Security Bureau to secretly go to Zhu's residence on Avonyi Road with the police station to arrest Zhu. A lot of reactionary evidence was found and handed over to the Special District Local Court for approval. The City Public Security Bureau then transferred him to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for research and implementation. It is heard that Zhu has been sent to Nanjing for interrogation. Recently, the City Public Security Bureau carefully reviewed the evidence obtained and found a letter mentioning that Lin Lin and a Wang Mou echoed Zhu Baohua and secretly held meetings in rooms specially opened in Shenzhou Grand Hotel, New Hotel, and Qinghe Hotel. It also stated that Lin Lin and Wang Mou were husband and wife. The City Public Security Bureau sent inspectors to find out Lin Lin's address and the school she attended. They went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to request assistance in arresting her on the afternoon of the 29th of last month. The police chief believed that it was not convenient to arrest her because the class had not yet been dismissed. Therefore, the date was changed to 7:30 AM on the morning of May 30th. More Chinese and foreign detectives and inspectors were sent to Lin's residence to arrest Lin. A search was immediately started, but no reactionary evidence was found. She was then sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court at 9:00 AM. Two of Lin's classmates went to the court to listen to the hearing. However, the so-called Wang Mou was not arrested. Later, Judge Wu questioned Lin Lin, and Lin Lin explained the process of coming to Shanghai to study and said that when she arrived in Shanghai, her cousin welcomed her at the dock and lived in her cousin's residence. She had never lived in a hotel, and there was no one named Wang among her classmates and acquaintances. She did not know who Zhu Baohua was, and she was still an unmarried girl. How could there be a husband and wife relationship? Therefore, she believed that this was a false accusation and she could not admit it. Her attitude was calm and she showed a slight smile. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, also opposed the City Public Security Bureau's request for extradition because the evidence was insufficient, saying that the City Public Security Bureau's inspector said that it was related to Zhu Baohua's case. Zhu has now been sent to Beijing, so why not submit the letter found? Without evidence, she cannot be taken away. However, if it is proven that the defendant has reactionary behavior, the police station will not allow such people to stay in the concession. Judge Wu asked the inspector a few questions and made the above decision. He also asked Lin Lin if she could find two stores to guarantee her. Lin immediately agreed and ordered the handling detectives to escort her to the bail office. She was released on bail shortly after, and she was deprived of her freedom of movement for only four hours from the time she was arrested to the time she left.</p>

<h3>Shen Jun Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Apparently Due to Perceived Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Leaving Behind a Newly Styled Suicide Poem</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month, at 5 PM, a young man in a Western suit checked into a room upstairs at a certain hotel on Avenue MacMahon in the French Concession, claiming his name was Bao Zhujun, 21 years old, from Fujian. The hotel clerk registered him accordingly in the ledger. He paid the room fee and went out. He returned to the hotel at midnight, and after a short while, went out again to bathe. He returned to the hotel late at night, around 2 AM, and went to bed, telling the room attendant to wake him up at 2 PM the next day. After saying this, he closed the door and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, due to perceived stimuli, he suddenly became weary of life and committed suicide by taking poison. The next afternoon, at 2 PM, the room attendant knocked on the door, but there was no response. After a long silence, he took the key to open the door, but the door was bolted from the inside. He then climbed in through the window and found Bao dead on the bed, his body cold, with fresh blood and saliva foaming from his mouth, and blood stains all over the bedding and pillow. He had only taken off his upper garment; his trousers and leather shoes were still on. On the table in front of the bed was a teacup with remnants of opium paste and sugar. The door was hooked shut from the inside with a copper hook he had purchased. The room attendant was greatly alarmed and opened the door to inform the hotel clerk, who reported it to the police station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate, and it was determined that he had committed suicide by swallowing opium paste mixed with sugar. Several letters were found in his pocket, one addressed to Shen Qinhao, the principal of Shanghai Art University, stating that he was committing suicide due to insurmountable economic problems. He requested that the remaining funds in the school be handed over to Xie Tengfei, a fellow townsman. He instructed the hotel to notify Xie Tengfei, a fellow student at the Quanzhang Middle School on Longhua Road. All the letters were signed Shen Jun. Another paper contained a newly styled suicide poem:</p>
<p>Life is inherently meaningless,</p>
<p>Why bother?</p>
<p>Leaving behind lasting regret after death,</p>
<p>Might as well stop.</p>
<p>It was written with a fountain pen. The other letters were from friends. The detectives carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. They also notified Shen and Xie at the addresses in the letters to come and identify the body. Shen was out, but Xie Tengfei and two fellow townsmen went to the funeral home and identified the deceased as Shen Jun, 21 years old, from Zhao'an County, Fujian Province, a student at the Shanghai Art University on Rue Grosse, who was a boarder. His parents and brothers were all in his hometown, and he had no relatives in Shanghai. Bao Zhujun was a pseudonym he used before death. Based on the situation, the detectives reported to the police chief. On Saturday morning, the French Concession criminal division reported to Judge Zhu of the French Court, who came to the scene to examine the body and take his seat in court. Xie Tengfei stated that he was willing to take care of the funeral arrangements, and the room attendant, You Hongquan, testified to the circumstances of the discovery. The judge ruled that Shen Jun had committed suicide by swallowing raw opium, and since his family was far away in Fujian, his fellow townsman Xie Tengfei was allowed to contact the Fujian Association to arrange for the funeral. The police took photographs of the body for record-keeping. After the examination, Xie arranged for clothing and a coffin to be prepared, and the body was temporarily placed in the association hall, awaiting the arrival of his family from Shanghai for the funeral.</p>
<p>Pingpu Express Through Train</p>
<h3>Resumption of Original Schedule Starting Today</h3>

<h3>Record of the Establishment of the Rongji Great World</h3>
<p>The Rongji Great World, sponsored by Mr. Huang Jinrong, held a general meeting of all committee members and staff at the Republican Hall of the Great World at 11 AM on the 30th (the day before yesterday) and officially announced its establishment. About several hundred people attended the meeting. It is reported that the company's organization has Huang as the chairman and economic committee member, and the other committee members are Min Caizhang, Bao Qinxuan, and more than ten others. The supervisory committee members are Gu Wuwu, Tang Jiapeng, and Jiang Zhuoyun. On that day, Huang, as chairman, delivered a speech and elaborated on the history of the Great World's founding, its future business goals, and implementation measures. All applauded in agreement. Here is the text of the speech: I am grateful to the colleagues of the Rongji Victory Company for electing me as the chairman and economic committee member. I am deeply ashamed of my limited abilities, but I hope that all colleagues and staff of this company will work together with one heart and mind, each doing their duty diligently, with business as the primary focus. From now on, I intend to revamp the entertainment and refresh the senses, with the goal of increasing the number of tourists as the first priority, so that the many tourists can enjoy this land and that business will flourish. I, in my weakness and incompetence, am ill-suited for this onerous task, and I rely on the assistance of my colleagues in the company. If there is no one, Xiang, who is an experienced wheelwright, will surely be able to supervise effectively. If there is Cai Zhang, he can be described as skilled and experienced, and I deeply rely on him. Cai Zhang should be responsible for overseeing all matters and assessing performance, and he can also respond appropriately to external relations. Other entertainment sections are also deeply pleased to have talented people who will certainly be able to fulfill their responsibilities. Looking to the future, I am willing to work together with my colleagues.</p>
<h3>Detailed Situation of the Construction of the Continental Commercial Building</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Trust Department of the Continental Bank sent a letter to this newspaper, stating: "Respectfully, yesterday's local news in your newspaper had an article titled 'Overview of the Layout of the Continental Commercial Building,' which detailed the situation of our department's construction of the Continental Commercial Building on Nanjing Road. Your newspaper's concern for commerce is greatly appreciated. Our department should submit a summary of the construction plan to reciprocate your newspaper's optimistic outlook on its success. Our department's commercial building covers a total area of over nine mu, bordering Nanjing Road to the north, Jiujiang Road to the south, and Shandong Road to the east, including the entire Hotel Lane, which has historical significance. A T-shaped road opens inside, with very wide entrances to the north, south, and east. This road, together with the sidewalks on both sides, is 30 feet wide. Along the road are double-front shops, 48 in total, about 20 feet wide and 50 feet deep, 19 feet high, with a mezzanine. There are two elevators at the north entrance and one elevator each at the south and east entrances. There are also seven cement staircases. The second, third, and fourth floors have a total of over 160 double-room shop locations. The fifth and sixth floors are used as office space. The central part facing Nanjing Road has a total of eight floors. The Shandong Road corner, including the tower, has a total of nine floors. The roof can be equipped with a music pavilion, an open-air dance floor, a small golf course, etc., for the higher entertainment of general customers, but without noisy facilities such as theaters and variety shows, in order to maintain a quiet and elegant atmosphere. Various electric light advertisements are installed around the roof. The entire building is constructed with reinforced concrete, designed and drawn by architect Zhuang Jun and supervised by Gongji Construction Factory. It is estimated that it can be completed by the end of the year. Our department's plan is specifically to supply various industrial and commercial retail departments and sample rooms. Either a single room can be rented, or several rooms can be rented together, according to the convenience of the tenants, embodying the spirit of division of labor and cooperation. It also provides equal opportunities for industrial and commercial enterprises with medium-sized capital to gather together, and customers can freely choose from a variety of goods after entering. In the future, our bank will set up a branch office in a prime location on the second floor to serve the shops, collect and disburse funds, and provide loans according to the business conditions of each shop. In terms of layout, we strive for artistry; in terms of management, we strive for rationality. However, this matter is of great importance, and everything is in its initial stages. We have established a Continental Commercial Building Preparatory Office to plan and organize, and our department's deputy manager is overseeing its completion. Currently, it is attracting the attention of various industrial and commercial enterprises from near and far, and dozens of people come to inquire about renting every day. Our department, in order to create a complete system, is still planning the regional allocation of various industrial and commercial enterprises. We have already registered the tenants who have decided to rent, and once the plan is completed, we will publicly disclose and allocate the rentals separately to meet the expectations of all parties. If your newspaper publishes this letter, we welcome guidance from all walks of life to complete Shanghai's unprecedented cooperative commercial building, which will not only be our department's honor."</p>
<h3>Another Case of Child Abuse</h3>
<p>Eleven-Year-Old Girl Covered in Injuries</p>
<p>Charity Association Rescues Her from Hell</p>
<p>Zhuang Aqin, a local resident of 2021 Xietu Road, Longhua, and his wife, Zhuang Zhao, adopted Zhou Yuting's fourth daughter as their adopted daughter, named Xinzhen, through a relative's introduction three years ago. Initially, they treated her with affection, but later, when Zhuang Zhao gave birth to her own daughter, she arbitrarily abused the adopted daughter, Xinzhen, forcing her to do all the hard labor. If she didn't perform to her satisfaction, she would beat her with sticks or strangle her, resulting in injuries all over her body. Someone reported this to the Chinese Child Welfare Association at 20 Museum Road, asking for help. After receiving the report, the association sent staff member Zhang Yueru to contact Section Chief Wang of the Second District Police Station. Section Chief Wang then dispatched police officer No. 1134 to investigate on site with Zhang. The results of the investigation matched the report completely. The left temple of her head was pierced with a small stool, her left wrist was broken with a stick, and her body was covered with strangle marks. Zhang filled out a detailed investigation form for record-keeping, photographed the injuries, and took the involved parties and the girl, Xinzhen, to the Second District Police Station. The police station handed Xinzhen over to Zhang to be temporarily cared for in the Shanghai Child Welfare Training Institute established by the association. The involved parties were sent to the police station to be severely punished as a warning to others.</p>

<h3>Candle Prices to Rise Again Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Association has repeatedly received reports from its members that the source of paraffin wax continues to soar, more than doubling since the last batch of goods arrived. Although prices have already been raised, the current cost of goods is causing excessive losses, and members have requested a meeting to re-determine the selling price in order to maintain business. The association held a general meeting of members at the Baohui Hall on Ninghe Road the day before yesterday. More than sixty members attended, and Shen Jiezhang was elected chairman. After discussion, the wholesale price was set at 50 yuan per dan and the retail price at 58 cents per catty, starting today. All members must not secretly increase or decrease prices in order to ensure uniformity. If anyone violates this rule, once reported, personnel will be dispatched to investigate and immediately impose penalties according to the regulations. In addition to issuing a notice, an advertisement will be published in the newspaper to show seriousness.</p>
<h3>Reclamation Bank Seeks Advertisements for Vacant Land</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the China Reclamation Bank's business has been greatly developed.

The drawings have been prepared by Tonghe Foreign Firm. Once the old materials are demolished, construction will begin immediately. This location is a lively area of the city with constant vehicle traffic. It is heard that the bank will be seeking advertisements for the vacant land. Those who wish to undertake this can contact the bank's real estate department at 144 Ningbo Road.</p>
<h3>Record of the Annual Shareholders Meeting of Datong Bookstore</h3>

<h3>Two Prisoners Commit Assault in Jail</h3>
<p>Each Sentenced to Three Additional Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>In the Public Works Department West Jail (Tilanqiao), it is the established rule that every morning at 5 AM, all prisoners in the jail should go to the square outside the prison and line up to walk around once. This is because prisoners spend all day in confinement and their muscles and bones are not stretched, which is harmful to their health. Therefore, they are allowed to exercise in the early morning light and absorb fresh air, which is a good way to benefit their health and strengthen their bodies. However, on the morning of the previous Saturday, while the prisoners were engaged in this walking exercise, Gu Shunfang, a native of Suzhou who was sentenced to six years of imprisonment, and Lu Hanming, a local who was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, suddenly each grabbed a small, sharpened blade and violently stabbed Liu Yuqing, a Ningbo native in the same line, in the head, right eye, and other parts. Liu was caught off guard and immediately bled, cried out in pain, and fell to the ground. The Indian guards monitoring the square arrested Gu and Lu and found two small knives on the ground. They were taken to the Huishan Police Station, and Liu was sent to the hospital. The doctor diagnosed that although the injury to his right eye could be treated, he would inevitably be blind in the future. After applying medicine, he was taken to the Special District Court along with the prisoners. Lu confessed that he did not know Liu at first, but after entering the prison last autumn, he learned about him. Because Liu often forced him to send letters to his family to get money for him to use, otherwise he would violently beat him. Therefore, he was filled with resentment and did this. Gu's confession was evasive, while Liu denied extorting money. After questioning, Judge Feng sentenced the two prisoners, Lu and Gu, to three additional years of imprisonment for the crime of assault, and the knives were confiscated. The police took the three prisoners back to the West Jail for confinement.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Male Corpse Found in Sewer</h3>
<p>Face Blurred, Body Decayed</p>
<p>The sewer inside Lane 60, Rue Grosse, French Concession, was recently clogged, so workers were hired to dredge it on the day before yesterday. At 5 PM, an unidentified male corpse, already decayed, was found in the sewer. The workers were greatly alarmed and reported it to the police station, which dispatched detectives to notify the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home to send undertakers to retrieve the body. It was found to be about 30 years old, naked on the upper body, wearing blue cloth trousers, barefoot, with short hair that appeared to be newly shaved. There was a hemp rope around the neck, the tongue protruding an inch, the skin blackened, and the face blurred, making it difficult to identify. The corpse was decayed and smelled terrible. It appeared that he had been strangled to death and thrown into the well to cover up the crime. The detectives reported to the police chief. The corpse was carried to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy, and the stench filled the air. Due to the hot weather, hygiene was a concern, so the police station reported to Judge Zhu of the French Court yesterday morning to examine the body. Since no relatives were found, the funeral home was ordered to provide a coffin, collect the body, and transport it to the Pudong cemetery for burial, pending identification by relatives. The police station ordered the detectives to investigate and arrest the murderer.</p>
<p>Car Accident Death</p>
<h3>Tao Weibiao Case Awaits Review and Judgment</h3>
<p>Tao Weibiao, a 63-year-old Cantonese restaurant accountant, was suddenly hit and killed by car No. 2910 driven by car driver Chen Afu on the evening of the 19th of last month at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Zilai Street, because the car was heading west and did not have time to avoid him. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. On the day before yesterday, the police station summoned all those involved to the French Court for questioning. First, the chief of the vehicle affairs office reported the previous situation. Chen Afu confessed that on that night, he was driving to that location and saw the deceased suddenly rush out from south to north, causing him to be unable to stop the car, resulting in the accident. Then, witnesses Qu Yu, Qu Gu, and Chen Ziyuan testified to the circumstances of the accident. According to the plaintiff, Tao Deng, the wife of the deceased, the lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that the accident was caused by the defendant's driver driving too fast and not honking the horn. It has been proven that he is undeniably at fault and should be investigated. Regarding the private prosecution, the deceased was an accountant in the restaurant and earned at least 100 yuan per month. His wife and children, a family of several people, depended on him for a living. Now that he has tragically been killed in the accident, they have no way to support themselves. Although the deceased was 63 years old, he was in good spirits and could have lived for at least another five years. At 100 yuan or more per month, he could have earned 6,000 yuan. Since his death, the family has spent 1,000 yuan on funeral expenses, totaling 7,000 yuan. They requested that the defendant be ordered to pay the full amount in compensation. The defendant's lawyer, Di Baike, argued that he remembered that the plaintiff's lawyer, Fei, had also represented a car accident case once before, in which he argued that the deceased was only 40 years old and that if he was 60 years old, he could live for at least 20 more years. Now, in this case, the deceased is already 63 years old, and Fei suddenly claims that he could live for at least five more years, showing that Fei's words are inconsistent. As for the public prosecution issue, it was raining that night, and the defendant's car was traveling there when the deceased was not careful and bumped into the defendant's car fender, resulting in injuries and death. It was his own fault, and the defendant was not at fault. He requested that the case be dismissed. The Chinese and Western officials announced the end of the debate and awaited review and judgment.</p>
<h3>Copper Treasure Gambling Den Cracked on Feihong Branch Road</h3>
<p>Cao Amao Openly Taking Commissions, Luring People to Gamble</p>
<p>Inspector Yang Receives Bribes of Seven Yuan Per Day, Disregarding Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>Chief Chen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has repeatedly received secret reports in recent days that someone has privately set up a copper treasure gambling den inside No. 33, Feihong Branch Road, in the jurisdiction of the Fifth District, Third Precinct, Zhabei, and that Inspector Yang of that precinct is protecting the gambling in exchange for bribes. He requested that personnel be dispatched to arrest them quickly. Chief Chen was furious upon hearing the report. He thought that the inspector, holding such an important position of public security, should have maintained his integrity and self-respect. How could he dare to privately accept bribes and allow people to openly gamble? This was a disregard for laws and regulations. If he was not severely punished, how could he enforce discipline and warn against corruption? He immediately secretly ordered Detective Captain Lu Ying to handle the matter properly. Lu, upon receiving the order, at about 5 PM on the day before yesterday, accompanied Deputy Captain Liu Huai, squad leaders Wu Xiufeng and Qi Haitain, detectives Gao Juchuan, Wang Yao, Zhang Xinlong, Han Jingshang, Wu Zuorong, Liu Pinqing, Yang Liancheng, Liu Enyu, Gao Huanian, and secret agents Jiang Jinxiang, Cui Youkuan, and Ye Rongsheng to the address to make arrests. They arrested 17 gamblers on the spot, including Fu Aifeng, Han Afa, Ye Changsheng, Bao Shansong, Xu Baosheng, Zhou Atang, Gao Sifu, Huang Baoshun, Yuan Ahai, Yin Alai, Qin Shaoliang, Ma Abao, Gu Shanqi, Hua Zixiang, Ni Lianer, Yu Heshang, and Xu Ruqing. They also confiscated all the copper treasure gambling equipment, 33 chips, two coin boards, 256 cents in small foreign currency, 8 cents in large foreign currency, and 4,390 copper coins. They also took the landlady, Zhou Chen, into custody. After separate interrogations yesterday, Fu Qingfeng, Gao Sifu, Yin Alai, Qin Shaoliang, Gu Shanqi, Hua Zixiang, Ni Lianer, and Yu Heshang all confessed to gambling. Han Afa, Bao Shansong, Huang Baoshun, Yuan Ahai, and Xu Ruqing also admitted to being accomplices. Ye Changsheng, Xu Baosheng, Zhou Atang, and Ma Abao claimed that they went to visit friends and were arrested along with them. As for Inspector Yang accepting bribes, it was true that he received seven yuan per day. Chief Chen was furious upon hearing this and ordered that the inspector be arrested immediately and await investigation and punishment. He also ordered the arrest of Cao Amao, the head of the gambling den, and that he be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Fell from a Car and Died</h3>
<p>Li Jianxiang, 28 years old, worked as a laborer at the Dachunghua Rubber Shoe Factory on Xujiahui Road. At 2 PM yesterday, he was riding in the factory's delivery car to Qipan Street. The car was traveling on Avenue Foch. It is unknown how, but Jianxiang jumped off the car and was injured, losing consciousness. He was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment but died at 3:10 PM. His body was transferred to the coroner's office to await examination.</p>
<h3>Where Did the Seven Thousand Yuan Come From?</h3>
<p>The Traveler Carrying the Money Actually Escaped</p>
<p>Director Zhao of the Songhu Garrison Command Station Inspection Office at the North Railway Station recently inspected a traveler whose hand-held leather bag looked suspicious. He immediately searched the bag and found a large number of banknotes inside. When he asked the traveler where he was taking the large sum of money and how much it was, the traveler could not explain the amount of money, could not say what it was for or where he was taking it, and could not give an address in Shanghai. His story was suspicious, so he was taken to the office. Upon checking the banknotes, there were a total of 7,000 yuan. Because there was no detention center, he was about to hand him over to the Longhua Command, but the traveler took the opportunity to escape without a trace. It is reported that Director Zhao has reported to the Command for review.</p>
<h3>Two People Injured in a Fight</h3>
<p>Starting with Teasing Women</p>
<p>At about 9 PM last night on Nanshan Road, Zhabei, workers from the Jiangbei and Anhui gangs gathered for a fight, causing a chaotic scene and a loud uproar. The Zhongxing Road police station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, sent police officers to disperse the crowd and reported the situation to headquarters by telephone, requesting additional armed police officers to go to the scene of the incident and arrest the perpetrators. Ten people were arrested and taken to the station. It is claimed that the incident started because of teasing women. The plaintiffs were laborer Yin Da and leather craftsman Yin Deng, and Yin Da's wife, Yin, was the one who was teased. However, when the police arrived at the scene, the main culprits had already fled. Only Anhui natives Wang Aliulu and Chen Wencai were arrested. The injured Yin Da and Yin Deng were sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>The Standard City Ruler of Baoquan Crafts Factory</h3>
<p>Baoquan Crafts Factory is a giant in the manufacture of measuring instruments and has been popular among the public for its production of meters and other instruments, surpassing imported products.

<h3>Zheng Baozhao's Letter to Traffic Department Colleagues</h3>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways: Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Director of the Traffic Department of the two railways, previously resigned from the Ministry of Railways. Although Director Luo and Director Liu, along with the Beijing-Shanghai Traffic Workers' Union, sent telegrams to persuade him to stay, Mr. Zheng had other high-level opportunities and could not be forced to remain. The handover was completed clearly yesterday. Mr. Zheng was deeply grateful for the retention efforts of his colleagues and sent a letter of thanks, roughly stating: "Baozhao is resigning from his railway duties to pursue a career in banking. I am deeply grateful for everyone's kind retention efforts. Since joining the railway, I have served for six years, starting as an intern and gradually rising to become the Traffic Section Chief. Later, I was transferred to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Traffic Department as Chief, and then transferred to the Pinghan Traffic Department as Deputy Director. Last year, I was transferred to the Ministry as a Specialist and then returned to this railway as Deputy Director of the Traffic Department. During these years, I have always regarded the railway as the most promising and interesting career, and I have worked diligently to contribute to the railway industry. I have not hesitated to accumulate resentment. Recently, Mr. Chen Guangfu of Shanghai Bank has not abandoned me and given me the opportunity to learn, so I am inspired to follow and work hard. I hope that everyone will understand my unavoidable hardships. During my time on this railway, I have worked with everyone with sincerity and love, but there are inevitable mistakes. I hope you will forgive me. Finally, I want to tell you that the only way for the railway to improve and develop is through commercialization and popularization. This is my definitive statement. Baozhao is leaving and will be engaged in the banking industry for the rest of my life. I hope everyone will work hard to love the railway and realize the country's purpose of operating the railway for the convenience of the people. I sincerely offer this to you for your consideration."</p>
<h3>Procedures for Reporting Livestock and Product Exports</h3>

When exporting the above livestock products abroad, a certificate of inspection from the Commodity Inspection Bureau must be presented. All declaration forms for these goods must also be submitted at the same time as the certificate. Live animals for slaughter are exempt from inspection and are therefore not listed in the above table. All merchants are to be informed of this notice."</p>
<h3>Navy to Send Ships to Protect Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Plan of the Overseas Chinese Industry Promotion Association</p>
<p>Lin Xianqi, Chairman of the Nanyang Business Society of Java and Representative of the Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies stationed in Shanghai, received an order from the Central Ministry of Navy the other day, stating that a request was received to quickly dispatch ships to protect overseas Chinese and to levy taxes to raise the necessary funds.

<p>It is reported that the procedures of the Overseas Chinese Industry Promotion Association can only be officially announced after the articles of association are finalized.

<p>Cigarette Factory Association</p>
<h3>Expression Regarding Export Taxes</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, inviting experts to study</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday regarding the difficulty in implementing the newly revised cigarette export tariffs and requested a temporary suspension and a detailed study by experts: "To the Honorable Ministers of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: Upon careful discussion by both Chinese and foreign businesses, the newly promulgated cigarette export tariffs are not only unhelpful to national revenue but also cause domestic cigarette factories to lose export business and help the development of factories in Hong Kong, Nanyang, and Dalian. Considering the national economy and the people's livelihood, we believe this is unacceptable. We request a temporary suspension and a detailed study by experts so that both national taxes and commercial conditions can benefit. We are greatly concerned." A letter was also sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating: "We have examined the newly revised export tariffs, which state that a 7.5% tax must be levied on cigarette exports. We believe this is unacceptable because our national industry is in its infancy and the people's livelihood is declining. We rely on promoting exports as much as possible to increase trade. Chinese cigarette sales to Siam and various ports in Nanyang have recently made rapid progress, and we should maintain the existing business and strive to develop a grand strategy. If a 7.5% export tax is levied, it will be easier for the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company of the Chinese Merchants and the British-American Tobacco Company of the foreign merchants, which have branch factories in Hong Kong, and the East Asia Tobacco Company of the foreign merchants, which has factories in Dalian, to transport and sell their products. The remaining businesses in Shanghai will lose their profits. This is regrettable. Furthermore, in terms of tax revenue, if cigarette exports stop due to the tax, the raw material import tax will also be affected. After repeated multiplication and division, it is difficult to ensure that the loss is not inevitable. This will not benefit the national revenue and will only harm the export business. This is precisely what our association believes is unacceptable. We hereby request that your esteemed association quickly submit a request to the Ministry of Industry, taking into consideration the difficulties of businesses and providing protection, and quickly submit a report to the National Government with the aim of promoting domestic products and temporarily suspending the cigarette export tax. We also request a detailed study by experts to maintain industry and enrich the people's livelihood. We hope to maintain our public relations."</p>

<h3>White Lectures on Scientific Management</h3>
<p>Invited by the Industrial and Commercial Management Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its ninth luncheon discussion meeting yesterday at the United China General Assembly. Professor Chen Da of Tsinghua University was originally invited to speak on "The Practical Problems of Labor Legislation." However, due to the arrival of Mr. R.W. Brure, director of the American Taylor Association and expert in scientific management, Professor Chen Da introduced him to give a speech instead. Those present included Chen Da, Guo Bingwen, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yunwu, Hu Shuhua, Guo Le, Li Zhaohuan, Pan Xulun, Cai Zhengya, Pan Yangyao, Ren Shigang, Zhao Shutong, Xu Chao, Zheng Yuanxing, Zhao Yuxi, Li Shengbo, Chang Bicheng, Ji Jiannan, Tao Leqin, Wang Yinqiao, Shen Yanmou, Wu Yun Chu, Sheng Zhuoshan, Cao Yunxiang, etc. President Kong was absent due to official business, and Guo Bingwen was elected chairman. After the meal, Secretary-General Cao Yunxiang of the association reported on the training institute for industrial and commercial management personnel. After detailed discussion, it was temporarily postponed due to economic reasons. Next, the chairman introduced Mr. R.W. Brare, who said in his speech: "I came to Shanghai this time to investigate the businesses run by Christianity in the East. I am very honored to be invited by your association to meet with industrial and commercial leaders. Unfortunately, the time is short and I have no time to examine the industrial situation in your country in detail. Scientific management not only focuses on reducing costs and increasing production, but also takes into account the coordination of supply and demand. After adopting scientific management, industry in our country has indeed become increasingly developed, but we have paid little attention to the sales aspect, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand and inevitable accumulation of goods, which still leads to economic downturns. This trip to the East makes me realize that economic issues have a major relationship with the international community, which cannot be solved by one country alone. In the future, I hope that the people of China and the United States will understand each other and work together to increase the interests and friendship between the two countries." The guests and hosts parted happily at 2:30 PM.</p>

<p>Ningbo Native Place Association</p>
<h3>Actively Handling Two Important Cases</h3>
<p>The Chen Jinguan Death Case In November 22nd of last year, Chen Jinguan, a native of Ningbo, was injured and killed by a car number 2343 driven by Japanese man Setsugoka in Yangshupu. The Ningbo Native Place Association has sent a letter to the government requesting negotiations, and the Yin County Party Department has also sent a letter to the Shanghai City Party Department requesting assistance. The Japanese side only agreed to pay 50 gold yuan in compensation. The members of the association were deeply dissatisfied because the Japanese man, relying on consular jurisdiction as a shield, trampled on the Chinese nation and disregarded justice. It was decided to send another telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting serious negotiations, and to ask all sectors of Shanghai to provide sympathy and assistance in order to uphold justice.</p>
<p>The Zhoushan Ship False Accusation Case The Zhoushan ship of the Zhoushan Shipping Company, which operates between Shanghai and Zhoushan, departed from Shanghai for Zhoushan on the 29th day of the fifth lunar month in the 17th year of the Republic. A Taiwanese passenger, Zheng Xingyao, suddenly suffered from acute cholera. The crew members immediately provided emergency treatment, but his condition worsened after the ship left Shipu Wharf and he died before reaching Haimen. People in Haimen falsely accused the ship's personnel of beating him to death and instigated his family to sue in the Linhai Court. The Ningbo Native Place Association sent Dong Xinqin to Shipu and Haimen to investigate the incident and collect various evidence to confirm that he died of illness. After returning to the association and reporting, the Ningbo Native Place Association sent a letter to the Linhai Court to provide proof. After three years, the court sentenced the ship's purser and tea waiter for criminal behavior. The Ningbo Native Place Association believed this was a wrongful injustice and sent a letter to the Supreme Court to provide proof in order to seek redress.</p>

<h3>A Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Holding to Buddha</p>
<p>The flowers of the field of emotion never wither, regardless of the season.</p>
<p>The waves of the sea of emotion often weave patterns of sorrow and resentment.</p>
<p>Resentful brocade and sorrowful silk are not as good as a woman with painted eyebrows in a humble home. The true essence of emotion can be seen in this.</p>
<p>Having a lover as a companion on a journey makes one feel that the speed of the carriage or boat is doubled.</p>
<p>When going to meet a lover, one still feels it is too late even when traveling by airplane.</p>
<p>Half of one's life is spent in bed, so the bedding must be comfortable.</p>
<p>Even slight words from a lover sound like a bell on a clear night.</p>
<p>The existence of men and women is like the existence of water and fire. Only when water and fire are in harmony can they be used. Extinguishing fire with water causes it to cease immediately. Using a woman to tame a man makes him as docile as a sheep. This is why female employees are so prevalent in modern industries.</p>
<p>Men's entertainment is in brothels, and women's entertainment is in temples. Therefore, monks and prostitutes are of equal value.</p>
<p>Even a chemistry PhD cannot analyze the chemistry of emotion.</p>
<p>It is good to talk about ghosts, whether they exist or not. It is not good to talk about emotion, whether it exists or not. Therefore, holding to the Buddha's words about emotion is not as good as Dongpo's talk about ghosts.</p>
<h3>Recording the Affairs of Wang Meiqu</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"Old friends are like falling yellow leaves, making one feel increasingly lonely." This is a line from Shen Qinqi's poem. After reciting it, I suddenly received news of the death of Wang Jun Meiqu, which made me feel unwell for several days. I met him at a Mengyu gathering in the past and we immediately became friends. Afterwards, we frequently corresponded. When I compiled a collection of novelists' sayings, he honored me with a preface. Although it contained many flattering words, our like-mindedness naturally flowed from the paper and ink. Reading it today makes me feel even more regret. Jun was kind and benevolent, and his grace extended to others. He often said that charity should not be limited to wealth. Even a simple gesture or word from us poor scholars is enough to relieve people from difficult situations. However, everyone is afraid to do it. Once, Jun was traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou on a third-class train. When the train passed Jiaxing, an elderly woman sitting nearby was anxious and distraught, as if she was looking for something but could not find it. Jun asked her what was wrong. The woman said that she did not know where she had lost her ticket and had no money to spare. If she could not produce a ticket, she would not be able to leave the station in Hangzhou. She burst into tears. Jun felt deep sympathy for her, but his own pockets were also empty and he could not help. After thinking for a moment, he generously tore off a corner of his own ticket and gave it to her, saying, "If the ticket inspector is kind, it should be enough to get you through the station." The woman said, "How can I receive such a favor and cause you hardship?" Jun explained again and again, and the woman finally accepted it gratefully. When they arrived at the station and got off the train, a station employee was responsible for collecting tickets at the gate. The woman presented her ticket and passed through the gate. Jun followed behind her. The station employee stopped him and said, "The ticket has already been handed in. Don't interfere with public affairs." The station employee angrily demanded to see his ticket. Jun said, "I am old and have traveled extensively. I have been subjected to the same kind of difficulty in the past, so I have taken precautions and tore off a corner of my ticket as identification. The remaining corner is still in my pocket and can be matched." The station employee checked the ticket and indeed found a missing corner. When he matched it, it fit perfectly. The station employee apologized and released him. Jun smiled secretly to himself. His kindness was like this, and his wisdom was just an added bonus.</p>
<h3>Recording Li Deng's Recitation</h3>
<p>— Xie Fei</p>
<p>The Belgian recitation artist, Li Deng (Liten), recently came to China with a commission from the Belgian Ministry of Education to study education. He gave a small preview in Shanghai upon his arrival at Guanghua University, where tickets were sold for three yuan each. Now he has come to the capital, Nanjing, and has been invited by Zhongda University to perform, and has even agreed to free recitations. Recitation is a pioneering endeavor in China, so people from both China and abroad flocked to it after hearing the news.</p>
<p>Mr. Li is old but has a dignified appearance, is humble but independent. One can tell at first glance that he is someone who is already enough to dedicate himself to the world without needing makeup or props. On that day, he recited twenty-four excerpts from famous French poems and plays, such as "Le Cid", for two consecutive hours, and his voice and appearance remained natural. All emotions, whether sorrow, joy, sadness, excitement, scolding, strong or weak, fast or slow, gentle singing or slow speech, were vividly expressed through his ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and hands. His recitation, whether of wind, clouds, thunder, or the laments of sorrowful women, the cries of hundreds of insects, or the roars of birds and beasts, were all conveyed through his voice. When he let out a sudden long howl, the doors and windows would shake, causing listeners to be startled, frightened, and at a loss for what to do. His ability to move people was like this. Is Mr. Li the most devoted lover?</p>
<p>Xie Fei said, "Is recitation like the single-person plays of China? Its imitation of emotions does not allow people to have even a moment of doubt, and even after a long time, it still feels like it is lingering in the rafters. Only poets and playwrights can do it, and only those who truly understand music can find pleasure in it."</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Opera Appreciation in the Ancient City</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master from Ziping</p>
<p>Since Yang Xiaolou returned to Beijing from Shanghai last year, his spirits have been quite good. After I arrived in Beijing, this old gentleman continuously performed famous plays such as "Jizhou City," "Taking Gaodeng," "Stealing the Imperial Horse," and "Assassinating Qingji." What he is most proud of and has never performed before is "The Fa Men Temple" (playing Zhao Lian). He is even performing it at the same time as "Picking Hua Che." This kind of favorable opportunity can only be encountered by luck and cannot be forced. According to Xiaolou, he put in a lot of hard work in his early years on bearded roles. In addition to "The Fa Men Temple" which has already been performed, there is also the play "The Complete Four Lang Visits His Mother," which is also a masterpiece. He is currently working on arranging it and will soon meet with opera enthusiasts on stage. If that is the case, then the people of Beijing will have a feast for their ears and eyes.</p>
<p>Since Xu Shuyan performed the charity play "A Family of Loyal Martyrs" at the First Stage two years ago, he has never performed on stage. All opera lovers cannot help but feel that it is a pity that such a person is not performing. According to what I know, Shuyan's voice is still as good as before, only the high and bright tones are a little worse. The reason for not performing is still due to other special reasons, not just because his voice is not good. This time, Beikai High Pavilion came to Beijing to record, and they had a very firm determination regarding Shuyan. After arriving in Beijing, after various explorations, the enthusiasm was greatly reduced. And Shuyan, in order to maintain his status, of course, was not willing to change the price issue at all, so the result changed from positive to negative. This is the real reason why the two companies did not record Shuyan's voice.</p>
<p>Among the female performers, Xue Yanqin has the most vigorous momentum, followed by Du Liyun. Liyun has made rapid progress in the artistic aspect recently. Her voice is broad and bright, and she also has an extremely sweet water sound, unlike the sharp, narrow, piercing, and unpleasant voices of other female performers. Last week, on Thursday and Friday nights, she performed "Four Lang Visits His Mother" and "Diao Chan" at the Kaiming Theater. The performance of "Four Lang Visits His Mother" was slightly reduced due to heavy rain and wind. "Diao Chan" is a new and excellent play written by Wang Yaoqing, so the upstairs and downstairs were already declared full before the performance started. Its magic power is truly not small. That night, Yaoqing was personally on the scene, directing and running in and out, looking extremely busy. I asked him if he was tired. Yaoqing smiled and said, "As long as my disciple is in the limelight, a little hardship is nothing." Everyone who heard this laughed out loud.</p>
<p>Hua Huilin has also made great progress. I watched her "The First and Second Volumes of Rainbow Pass," "Hongluan Xi," and "Baolian Deng." I was most satisfied with "Hongluan Xi" because Huilin is petite and lively, which is suitable for roles in comic plays.</p>
<p>Xue Yanqin's performance has two kinds of elements in it: Xiaoyun on the surface, and Lanfang in the bones. Not only does she sing well and act well, but her "posture," "stage presence," "martial arts," "dance," "makeup," and "recitation" are all good. No wonder her momentum is so strong that no one can compete with her. I once said that Xue Liu's performance is enough to compete with the Four Great Dan in the present era. If she continues to study diligently, there may be an even better day. My hopes for Xue Liu are deep and earnest. I hope that Xue Liu will continue to muster her courage and make progress every day, so that she can create a new record in the world of female performers that has never existed before.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Special Issue on Round Fans</h3>
<p>— He Tieshan</p>
<p>In spring and autumn, one needs a cane and sandals; in winter, one needs a brazier; in summer, one needs a fan. When the time comes, those in need will be abundant and not be separated. Those in need are abundant, so reforms are advanced. Sandals were advanced once, and leather shoes came into existence. Sandals were advanced once, and guests in sandals were waited for. The brazier is roaring, and electric light is sparkling. The luxurious homes of party members are vastly different from the simple homes of the poor. Objects compete to be new and different every day. Only the round fan remains unchanged, sticking to the past and wilting. Occasionally, one or two strive for novelty, imitating the peacock fans of the Polib country, or imitating the jade handles of King Nankang, or chasing after the gold flowers of King Wuyue, or imitating the flying white script of Emperor Taizong. But the five-cornered and six-piece fans are made and abandoned in a whirl. My friend Sun Jun Xueni was worried about this, so he used his ingenuity and presented beautiful thoughts. He looked up at the bright moon for inspiration, took the rule and circle as the degree of the round body, sought the slender simplicity of Yi and Luo, tailored the wonderful creation of Hehuan. Its material is pure and fine, its style is new and exquisite, and its quality is light and beautiful. Its style is elegant and popular. He stole three thousand feet of Jieyu's skillful patterns and cut out twelve patterns of dragons and phoenixes hidden in the pleated silk of Goose Creek. Giving them is the same as pheasant feathers. In the past, Zhiduo said in a verse that the sun and moon are square and round and five hundred yojanas in size, but what we see now is only like a fan. I will imitate it and say that I will buy ten thousand pieces of Nanjing silk, thinner than cicada wings and lighter than swallows, and cut out a round of the moon from the horizon to give to a beauty to cover half her face.</p>
<p>Art Notes 1 Recently, the Sino-Japanese Art Exhibition was held in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. There were two hundred or so pieces of work from our country, and Yu Shaoshou's ink bamboo painting was bought by the Japanese Empress Dowager for a large sum of money. Jin was formerly the Legal Department of Longyou, and his reputation was outstanding. In his spare time after retirement, he studied metal and stone engravings and was especially skilled in calligraphy and painting. He has published books such as "Record of Painting Methods" and "Descriptive Bibliography of Books and Paintings." This time, his ink bamboo painting was submitted to the Japanese art exhibition, and Chinese and foreign viewers all praised it. (Zizai)</p>
<p>Art Notes 2 Famous painters Wang Yiting, Zhang Yuguang, Xie Gongzhan, Ma Wanli, Qian Huafu, Liu Junran, Ma Daiyun, and thirty others will hold a collaborative fan exhibition at the Shuyi Society at the intersection of Sanma Road and Yunnan Road, starting from the 30th. There are more than three hundred exhibited paintings, and they will also create paintings for guests on the spot at very low prices. (Qi)</p>
<h3>A Journey Around the Yellow Sea (18)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>In 1917, I visited Japan and visited the principal of Tokyo Higher Technical School, Seichiro Teshima. He was over seventy years old and knew that I advocated vocational education. He warmly invited me to his home and said to me, "Do you Chinese actually advocate vocational education? We Japanese only know how to advocate industrial education that helps the capitalist class develop production. We don't care about vocational education that solves the livelihood problems of the working class. I am old, so you go and do it well. One day the masses will wake up." I was greatly moved when I heard this. Later, we often corresponded. Within a few years, the old man passed away. I still solemnly preserve his calligraphy. This time I went to Japan and the old man's grave was already overgrown with trees. However, vocational education has become the most fashionable term, and there is almost a trend of vocationalizing the entire country's education, which is not beyond the old man's expectations.</p>
<p>Speaking of education issues, elementary school students are still young, and university students are comparatively able to solve their own problems. It is middle school that is the most "awkward" - to use a Shanghai colloquialism. The former erroneous view was that middle school was to train the mainstay of society - this was a misinterpretation by Japanese educators at that time. Does that mean that university graduates are not fit to be the mainstay of society? Some only recognize middle school as preparation for university and do not consider how to place middle school graduates, at least half of whom cannot afford to go to university. It is because the middle school system has not been properly defined that most middle school graduates have no way out - under this unreasonable education policy, university graduates also have no way out, but especially middle school students - so that countless powerful responders are added to the ideological problem for no reason. Recently, Japan has seen through this point and suddenly realized it, and has decisively reformed the middle school system. It has divided the middle school into two parts: one is to prepare for various occupations, and all courses are based on the needs of the occupation, needless to say, and the other is to prepare for university, but it is also stipulated that a certain amount of time be devoted to managing one's own life or school public life, which is called work subjects. The key point of their middle school system is to cultivate the knowledge and skills necessary for social life, the spirit of independence and self-reliance, and the habit of loving labor (see the Japanese newspaper of March 7). This new system will be implemented from April 1st.</p>
<p>They are also advocating there that it is not enough to emphasize vocational education in elementary school, and that compulsory education should be extended from six years to eight years to make it subject to compulsory vocational supplementary education.</p>
<p>They are using the power of the government to run youth leagues in various places, which are popular throughout the country, focusing on three points: first, physical training; second, personality training; and third, vocational training.</p>
<p>Their women's occupations are very developed. For traffic organizations, commercial organizations, and administrative organizations, all assistant positions that women can do are given to women. However, on the one hand, they use chemistry to solve cooking problems, absolutely accepting science and absolutely accepting world trends. On the other hand, they still preserve their wooden clogs and backpacks and never feel outdated or ashamed. Looking back at our China, it is said that the women's heads are already feeling too much mulberry and hemp.</p>

<h3>The Future World (4)</h3>
<p>— Tian Xuwo Sheng</p>
<p>I thought in my heart again that if I didn't pay attention to what the people next door were saying, I wouldn't hear them even if they were talking face to face. I tried to listen attentively, and the more I listened, the further I could hear. I could clearly hear the sound of the ship stirring the water dozens of miles away. Therefore, I could see the scene inside the ship in my mind. I also tried to add some color to a glass of water and let someone taste it, saying it was yellow wine. At first, the person said it wasn't. I used the power of "telepathy" to attract him with my "heart electricity" and make him believe that it was fine wine. He tried a sip himself and felt that it tasted very good, so he praised it repeatedly. Then I asked him to taste it again, and he could also taste the flavor. I knew that his mind was already working like mine, as if a magnet had taken effect. Then I asked him to look at the clouds and I asked him what they looked like, and he also recognized what they were. Taking it a step further, I told him about the sound films of the new world fifty years from now, explaining that my telepathy was even more advanced than the electricity in those films. I asked him if he had seen those films. He said he hadn't seen them yet. I pointed to the powder wall in the air and asked him to focus his attention and look at it. Surprisingly, he could see it. Then I asked him to listen attentively, and surprisingly, he could hear it. Later, he told his friends what he had seen and heard. Those friends had seen those films and said that it was exactly right, and they were extremely surprised. They immediately rushed over to ask me to pass on the secret. Therefore, I took in many students and established a telepathy school. In this present world, I don't know how the progress of science in the future world you imagine compares to my current telepathy. Can you tell me a little about it? Therefore, I slowly raised two fingers and pointed them at him, saying, "It's still a burden to have this body left in the world. I think the evolution of mankind in the future world will definitely be able to extract the essence and discard the dross, as if it were a chemical medicine, only refining the essence it contains and discarding the dross. If a person's spirit can be refined, it can definitely break away from the body and be like Nezha on the Investiture of the Gods, who can use lotus flowers to create an incarnation. However, using lotus flowers as the material for the shape is still inferior. For example, if you take toad venom from a toad and use flour to absorb it, what is the use of the flour? It is still a useless wart. A person's body is just like the flour that absorbs toad venom, but it is the first step in the formation. Because toad venom is easy to volatilize, flour must be used to form it so that it can be preserved for a long time. Therefore, at the beginning of life, one must have a body, just like a steel cylinder that contains gas. When the practical gas is used, the liquefied gas inside is completely released for use, and then the steel cylinder is useless, just as a person's spirit is completely used in their career, and then this body is useless."</p>

<h3>Last Week's Gold Market Was Terrifying</h3>
<p>New Records Were Repeatedly Discovered</p>
<p>The Final Statistics Rose by Thirteen Taels</p>
<p>Monday (May 25) Due to the Western holiday, banks were closed, so the gold market was also closed for one day. The next day, the large telegraphic transfer rate rose by 1.25 shillings, with the exchange rate contracting by one rank (because the large telegraphic transfer rate had contracted by 3.125 on the 25th). The domestic market also held firm. However, as prices continued to rise, the gold market opened eight taels higher at 802.5 taels, then 05 taels. Later, due to heavy selling, it fell to 797.8 taels. However, as Wu and others chased after purchases, it once rose to 805.1 taels. However, the Guangdong trading house Hengxingsheng sold heavily, falling more than six taels. Only four to five taels were traded in the afternoon, once reaching 796.5 taels. Later, news spread that the United States had sold silver, and sentiment suddenly rose, jumping ten taels to close at 807 taels, which was a new high price, an increase of twelve and a half taels compared to last Saturday. On Wednesday, the large telegraphic transfer rate rose by 1.875, and the silver price increased by 1.25 shillings. The gold market immediately opened lower at 802 taels, then fell slightly to 798.5 taels. However, due to large purchases by major players, it unexpectedly rose to 809.3 taels. However, Hengxingsheng heavily sold off, selling about 4,000 bars, so at noon it plummeted nine taels to just over 800 taels. The afternoon was relatively calm, with only three to four taels of fluctuation. It closed at 803.9 taels, a small decrease of 3.1 taels compared to the previous day. The next day, the large telegraphic transfer rate fell again by 1.25, and the silver price fell slightly by 0.25. The British exchange rate contracted by half a rank, but the domestic market strengthened from weakness, resulting in different trends in the open and secret markets. Some traders suddenly dumped shillings, and the gold price initially opened firmly at 809 taels, then 12 taels. Afterwards, the situation became turbulent. It was rumored that a certain bank and major player Yufeng Yong sold heavily, causing a sharp downturn, plummeting more than ten taels to just 795 taels. It calmed down slightly at noon, but finally fell to 787.5 taels in the afternoon. The falling trend did not stop until it closed at 89 taels, a huge drop of 14.9 taels compared to the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 24.5 taels throughout the day. The next day, the large telegraphic transfer rate increased by 1.875, and the silver price increased by 3.75. Therefore, the shilling exchange rate increased by one rank, but contrary to the previous day, the domestic market strengthened from weakness. Traders first sold and then purchased, truly opening loose and secretly tightening. The gold market initially opened slightly lower at 786.5 taels, then fluctuated up and down. It once fell to 83.3 taels. Later, due to purchases by major players such as Wu and the tightening of the exchange market, it unexpectedly rose ten taels. At noon, it was 795.8 taels. The afternoon fluctuations were huge. As a result, it broke through 800 taels to 03 taels, and closed at 02 taels, a rebound of thirteen taels compared to the previous day, with a difference of 20 taels. On Saturday, the gold market started strong but ended weakly. It once reached a new high of 818 taels, which had never been seen before. However, the waves were turbulent, fluctuating by four to five taels at a time, with a difference of 11.5 taels. People were panicked and it was difficult to predict. The supply and demand of major players differed. It opened fifteen and a half taels higher at 817.5 taels in the morning because the large telegraphic transfer rate contracted sharply by 4.375, the silver price was 8.75, and the private telegram rate was 81.5. Therefore, sentiment was high and reached eighteen taels. Later, due to sales by the Dalian trading house and Wu, it plummeted seven taels. The shilling quote was 811 taels. Although the listed price contracted by half a rank (3.75), the US dollar was 75 days of gold plus 4.5 points, but it did not move. It then retreated from 12 taels to 09.5 taels. Later, due to the activity of buyers, the shilling only closed at 2 pence 9.3 minutes for fifteen taels. After that, the cashiers of various houses were erratic, so there were more than five taels of fluctuations. Until noon, the exchange rate tightened, resulting in a setback. The shilling could be settled at 2 pence 0.625 minutes. As there were still many sellers on the table, it suddenly retreated to 806.5 taels, then rose again by 2.5 taels. The noon closing was 807.5 taels, still an increase of 5.5 taels compared to the previous day. The maximum difference in half a day was 18 taels, and the minimum was 06.5 taels, a difference of 11.5 taels. The listed price was changed to 853.8 taels, with a discount of 40 taels before and after, then 46 or 47 taels. According to the trading statistics of various houses, Daxing Yongyu and Da Cuichang Yongbingxing were all buyers. Tong Taichang Shunli Wanxing Yuancheng Qian Changxiang and Yuan Heng Fuchang were all sellers. Zhifeng Yong sold and then bought. Speculator Wu sold first and then bought, trading about 4,000 bars. The hedging houses frantically purchased yuan orders, so they issued notes to the Dalian trading house, selling more than 5,000 bars in total and buying one thousand and several hundred bars. The Guangdong trading house made a small number of transactions. The high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets and exchange rate premiums are listed below:</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Over the Past Two Days</h3>
<p>Rates contracted the day before yesterday, but rebounded yesterday.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (30th), according to a London dispatch, both China and India were selling silver, but supply was scarce. After the market closed, conditions were calm. Large bars of silver contracted to 43.75 for near-term delivery and 3.75 for far-term delivery, both at 12 1/8 pence. In addition, a dispatch from New York reported that the US silver price also contracted by 0.875, with spot prices at 26 cents. Bombay spot prices were slightly down by 3 annas, calculated at 42 rupees and 0.09 annas. The Shanghai tael shilling contracted by 0.25 to 1 shilling and 2.25 pence. As for yesterday, a London dispatch stated that a few short positions were covered, and the market was calm. Large bars of silver rebounded by 0.0625 for both near-term and far-term delivery, both at 13 1/8 pence. There were no reports on US silver prices and US-to-British, Japanese, or Shanghai exchange rates due to the Flag Day holiday. The British-to-US and Japanese-to-British rates did not change. The Shanghai tael shilling increased by 0.125 to 1 shilling and 2.375 pence. Bombay was slightly down by 2 annas, calculated at 42 rupees and 0.07 annas.</p>
<h3>Year-End Clearance Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed. As usual, the market was quiet. However, it was also the end of the month, a major settlement period, so money houses and various clearings were quite busy, and market transactions were somewhat better than on a normal Sunday. The morning price for foreign exchange was 7 mace, 2 fen, 9 li. The afternoon price was 7 mace, 2 fen, 8 hao, 6 si, 2 hu, 5 lei, a slight decrease. The morning and afternoon rates for fragmented silver were unchanged at 3 fen, a decrease of 0.2 fen compared to the previous day. Exchange transactions totaled 880,000 in the morning and 635,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes were only transacted in the afternoon for 30,000. Outside the market, banknote transactions totaled 120,000 in the morning and 65,000 in the afternoon. Money shops received over 1.8 million in silver certificates and cleared over 5.3 million in silver. Clearings from various routes totaled over 400,000. Transactions at small money shops totaled over 300,000. In the auxiliary currency market, the morning price for Jiangsu small silver was 6 mace, 5 fen, 6.5 li, and the afternoon price was 6 mace, 5 fen, 6 li. Morning transactions totaled 5,000 jiao, and afternoon transactions totaled 4,500 jiao. The morning price for Guangdong small silver was 6 mace, 4 fen, 7 li, and the afternoon price was the same. Morning transactions totaled 65,000 jiao, and afternoon transactions totaled 30,000 jiao. Copper cash totaled 378,000 strings.</p>
<h3>Silver Fragmentation Amount for May</h3>
<p>Due to sluggish silver supply and demand and ample capital, the daily silver fragmentation rate has been relatively loose. As a result, the total silver fragmentation amount for the entire month of May was only 1 liang, 1 mace, and 2 fen. The average daily fragmentation was only 3 fen and 7.34 li, which is more than 6 mace less than in April, an increase of onefold. In this case, the bottom line for interest rate negotiation is still less than the fixed short rate. It is generally expected that the board of directors will decide tomorrow to keep the total at 2 liang and 95 kou.</p>
<h3>Bond Prices Declined Sharply Last Week</h3>
<p>Over 10.8 Million Traded in Four Days</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange Increased Margin Requirements to Curb Speculation</p>
<p>Last week, except for Friday when the market was closed for settlement, Thursday was also closed for a day due to the large settlement amount and busy business. Therefore, the market was only open for four days during the entire week. However, despite being around the end-of-month settlement period, bond prices experienced significant changes, and market conditions became increasingly tense. As a result, the bond market was more active than before. The first two days of the week each saw transactions reaching 26-27 million. Although May contracts were no longer being auctioned on Wednesday in preparation for settlement and July contracts had not yet opened, only June contracts were being traded, the transaction volume still reached over 30 million. On the last day of the week, the exchange increased margin requirements to ensure safety and curb speculation. As a result, although July contracts had opened, transaction volume was slightly lower than before, totaling over 24 million. The total was 108,685,000 yuan, only a decrease of over 25 million yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, the 20-year Customs bonds were the most active, accounting for 23.445 million yuan. The 20-year Disbandment bonds were second, at 20.045 million yuan. Disbandment bonds totaled 19.025 million yuan, 1919 Customs bonds totaled 16.075 million yuan, 1919 Welfare bonds totaled 12.74 million, and Reorganization bonds totaled 11.105 million yuan. Others were relatively inactive, such as Customs bonds at 2.0696 million, 96 bonds at 2.405 million, and 6% Consolidation bonds at 1.855 million. 1919 bonds totaled 5,000 yuan. Spot transactions totaled only 20,000 yuan. The trend of various bonds last week was characterized by a significant sell-off by Guangdong merchants due to the serious situation. Sellers were unusually active, and market conditions were more tense than before. The sharp decline in bond prices was unprecedented since the Feng Yuxiang coup. On Monday, various bond prices fell by a significant 2-4 yuan. On Tuesday, they fell again by 1-2 yuan. The decline was even more severe on Wednesday, with major bonds falling sharply and auctions being suspended. Although prices rebounded briefly on the morning of the last day of the week, they soon continued to fall, resulting in a more exhausted market. According to statistics, the market price of 20-year bonds for June fell by over 10 yuan compared to the previous week, and other bonds also continued to fall by about 7-8 yuan. In light of this situation, the exchange decided to increase margin requirements to ensure safety and restrict the bond market. The future of the bond market is uncertain due to the issuance of new treasury bonds, and it is difficult to expect a rebound in the short term. However, the market may become slightly calmer. The following is a statistical list of the high, low, and price differences of various bonds in the past four days:</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton Trend Upward</h3>

British and Indian cotton markets were closed. On the 30th, both US and British cotton markets were closed. The Indian cotton market was firm due to purchases by brokers and exporters.

<h3>Hangzhou Silk Cocoons Nearing Suspension of Weighing</h3>
<p>Late-season cocoons are becoming scarce, regardless of price. Cocoons from Hangzhou, Linping, Gaosi, Sanbao, Nanshan, Hushu, Xiecun, Liangzhu, and other upper and lower areas are experiencing harvests that are less than those of the early season. The second crop of silkworms is almost entirely abandoned. The total cocoon production is only about 40% of normal. Over ten cocoon merchants have been weighing for more than ten days. Due to the scarcity of goods on the market, cocoon merchants are nearing suspension of weighing. The volume received by various businesses is only about 30% of previous years. Cocoon prices are at a high of 54-55 yuan and a low of 42-43 yuan, with an average of 48-49 yuan.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silk Prices Continued to Weaken Last Weekend</h3>
<p>New York down 5 to 10 cents, Lyons down 4-5 francs. Overseas silk prices continued to weaken last weekend. Due to continued contraction of foreign exchange rates and the lower price of Japanese silk compared to Chinese silk, silk mills are abandoning Chinese silk in favor of Japanese silk, resulting in sluggish sales. In New York, Huangbai Filature fell 7-10 cents per pound, Kangchien Filature fell 5-6 cents, and Grey Filature fell 5 cents (US dollars). In Lyons, Filature fell 4-5 francs per kilo, while Kangta Filature and Grey Filature fell 3-4 francs.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan New Tea Prices Trending Upward</h3>
<p>The earliest new tea picking in Wuyuan this year was in Beiyuan, and the best quality tea also came from Beiyuan. Therefore, before the opening of the market, various businesses focused their attention on this route. After the opening of the market, it was almost entirely purchased within a few days. As of today, the only new tea in Beiyuan that has not been sold is late-season tea from Tuochuan Yuan. All other areas have no leaves left. Various merchants are scrambling to buy tea because their stocks are not full. Merchants from Tunxi also rushed over yesterday, but half of the new tea has already been snapped up by tea traders, who are holding onto it for speculation. As a result, both merchants and traders are feeling regretful. Today, prices in various areas opening for sale are set at 58-60 yuan in Baimu Duan, Shuimo, Huangcun, and other areas. Prices in Dongxiang, Jixi, Longwei, and other areas are set at 60-75 yuan. Prices in Nanxiang, Nanyu Tan, and Nanwuli are set at 40-43 yuan. Market prices have increased by 5-6 yuan compared to the previous day and are still expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Market Coarse Sugar and White Sugar Increase Sharply by Two Mace</h3>
<p>Refined Sugar Also Rises Significantly</p>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from the producing areas stated that due to it being Sunday, there was no delivery to the association. The market price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse and white sugar was firm. Demand for rock sugar was very strong, and the market price increased sharply. The transaction price for high-quality TK goods reached 11 taels and 6 mace, and the price for ordinary goods was 11 taels and 4 mace. Trading was active, but supply was very short, increasing sharply by 2 mace compared to the previous day, and the market was very strong. Imports and exports were extremely busy, and the price of Z sugar was 11 taels. The price of 5-point TK was 11 taels and 3 mace, the price of new goods was 11 taels and 3.5 mace, the price of TM was 11 taels and 2 mace, the price of YRO was 10 taels and 9 mace, the price of J was 11 taels and 7 mace, and the price of YP was 11 taels and 7 mace. The market was also brisk, with signs of further price increases.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Market in Hongjiang Sees Sharp Price Increases</h3>
<p>Rumors of Obstruction in Xiangxi</p>
<p>The production area of Hongjiang tung oil is in Xiangxi, and transportation takes a long time. Recently, rumors have circulated in the market that transportation is being obstructed in Hunan province for some reason. As the summer season is the peak sales season for Hongjiang tung oil, domestic merchants have not prepared sufficient stocks. With the source of supply being obstructed, people inevitably panic, resulting in brisk trading and a market rebound. However, Hongjiang merchants are concentrated in Zhenjiang, so merchants in this port have been rushing to Zhenjiang to purchase goods for days, but have reportedly been unable to fulfill their needs. Prices have already risen by 5-7 mace. Market sentiment has been very tense in the past one or two days, and the momentum is still growing. The price of Zheng brand oils such as Jichang and He has already been sold for 26 taels and 7-8 mace, Yang Hengyuan secondary Hong is 21 taels, Qing Yuanfeng is 21 taels and 8 mace, and Xiang Taifeng, Jifeng, and Ying are all 21 taels and 4 mace. According to industry insiders, it is expected that the price will increase by another liang.</p>

<h3>Northern Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— Anping</p>
<p>18. West Mountain</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing about this trip to Beiping is not having explored it thoroughly.</p>
<p>Although letters from home say that it's good not to have explored it thoroughly because it leaves the impression that Beiping must be visited again, this is just a consolation. Why not have a great time in Beiping when you're already there? Of course, the fundamental reason is that all things are unpredictable. Who knows, after arriving in Beiping and feeling that it would be nice to live there for a year and a half, I might suddenly have a whim and run back to Jiangnan within half a day.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to stay in Beiping for a long time, I naturally wasn't in a hurry to eat and play everything at once. Besides, winter was windy and cold, making people feel listless. My companions also said that we should go out and play together when the sun is warmer and the treetops are dyed with some new colors. Wouldn't that be more fun? Naturally, these words were all correct. Even I didn't want the northern scenery to give me a bad impression on my first visit, so I patiently stayed and read some books, not rushing to play.</p>
<p>On the first good day after I arrived in Beiping, I wanted to take a trip to the Palace Museum. At that time, it was the Lunar New Year, and the Palace Museum was open for seven days at half price. Naturally, this was also a reason for me to want to go. But a friend said that his family had free passes to the Palace Museum, so there was no need to rush for the half-price discount. We could go together in a couple of days. This friend was a fun-loving person. When I said I wasn't going to the Palace Museum, he suggested West Mountain. West Mountain was something they were tired of, but their enthusiasm was still as good as mine. So, strangely, we went. There were five of us, plus five grooms and five animals. We formed a team, brought some dry food, and first passed through the Summer Palace and then Jade Spring Mountain. The warm breeze caressed us along the way. The donkeys (old men donkeys) couldn't run fast, but at least it was good to let the heart wash itself in exhilaration. Sometimes, we would intentionally dismount and lead them over a gap or a hillside. These were all more interesting than riding on the donkey's back.</p>
<p>The most famous thing on West Mountain is the so-called "Eight Great Sites," but I must declare that I didn't go. The reason is that it was too far. Playing on West Mountain was something that was realized occasionally in a moment of joy. We first went to Biyun Temple.</p>
<p>Biyun Temple is in a very good location. We walked all the way up to the large stone chamber where the Prime Minister's coffin had once been placed. This stone room is really tall and has a good layout. To run up to the stone room from the gate, you have to climb more than a dozen flights of stairs, each with dozens of steps. The so-called stone room is naturally made of stone on all sides. Countless Buddhist images are carved around it. There are also five pagodas on the roof of the stone room. I don't want to describe it because I believe you must have seen it in some photo. There are no windows around, only a door. The door is locked, and we can't enter. The pagodas on the roof seem to be accessible from inside the room. Since we can't even enter the room, there's even less reason to think about climbing to the top of the pagoda.</p>
<p>Behind the stone room is a mountain. The mountain is high, like the back of a chair. There are white bark pines on the mountain that I had never seen in the south. How should I write about my joy at seeing these white bark pines? I think you can imagine countless silver chains hanging in a patch of oily green. They are really as white as silver, and the sky is radiant. I think it would be even more poetic on a moonlit night. The trees are incredibly tall. Wandering in such a deep grove is a divine experience. Behind the trees is a mountain, light grayish-blue. All of this makes the white bark pines even more lovable.</p>
<p>After leaving Biyun Temple, we went to Xiangshan Temple. There are good trees here, as good as the trees in Zhongshan Park. It's not a particularly good place to sit for a while in Xiong Xiling's Shuangqing Villa, but tranquility is its characteristic.</p>
<p>After returning from Xiangshan, we went to Wolfo Temple. It goes without saying that there is a reclining Buddha in Wolfo Temple. The door of the hall with the reclining Buddha is locked. The reason for locking it is to make it easier to open. Why open it? The reason is extremely simple: so that they can ask for incense money. You can't be blissed out without money. I think that in the Western Paradise, you also have to have money to be blissful. The Buddhist believers will definitely not like to hear this, but it's a fact. The monks are famously well-fed, and it seems that they are well-fed precisely because they are famous and because it seems that everyone should give them food.</p>
<p>The reclining Buddha is draped in a very large silk cloth, which is said to have been made by Empress Dowager Cixi. There are also countless pairs of shoes, which are prepared for the reclining Buddha to wear, so they are extremely large.</p>
<p>This temple is dilapidated, but the small hill behind the temple looks so attractive that it is still one of the best-looking temples in Beiping. The beauty of Beiping's temples lies in their color. Many scenes don't show colors, but Beiping is an exception. For example, the trees are green, the roofs are green, the houses are red or yellow, and the arches are all the colors you see. The tiles in Beiping are mostly glazed tiles, which shine and are bright. Naturally, this is one of the most outstanding reasons why they are so beautiful.</p>
<p>We returned before dusk. On the way, everyone whipped their donkeys desperately to make them run. Zhang Jun fell to the ground from the donkey's back, and the hearts of everyone went from unrestrained airiness to solemnity. In the end, he hired a rickshaw to go back to the residence first. We still laughed and talked on the road, forgetting our friend's misfortune.</p>
<h3>Jida to Hold Party Principles and National Language Speech Competition</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The Jida Party Principles and National Language Speech Competition has been organized and established by the school authorities for several years. It is held twice a year (once each semester). At the beginning of each semester, the school first sets the date of the competition, and then students from each college freely register to join. This is a good way to study party principles and practice public speaking. The school authorities always prepare many prizes before the competition to reward the winning students. Therefore, the students of the school regard this as a good opportunity to practice public speaking, and the number of people who register to participate each time is large. The school has now set June 1 as the date for this semester's competition and May 28 as the registration deadline. Students of the school have been enthusiastically registering at the training office recently, and it is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
