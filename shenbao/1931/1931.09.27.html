<h3 id="c8">異哉日政府之聲明書（二） <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>（三）日政府第三點聲明。謂「日軍實行目的而後。立即撤回鐵道附屬地内。」佔據瀋陽吉林等地。「並非軍事佔領。」佔據營口税關管理四鄭瀋新等路。及日軍出動長春以北與間島亦非事實。日政府此種聲明。直如掩他人之耳而盜鈴耳。第一日暴軍自十八晩暴行發生。侵佔我瀋陽而後。即肆其暴行。如火如荼。攻城掠地。正在積極發展中。所謂「立即撤回鐵道附屬地内。」如非日政府自欺欺人。則此種聲明。適足以證明日人之心虚不敢承認事實。第二實施暴力。侵我主權。略我城市。屠我軍民。更換易旗幟。任命官吏。開始徵税。佔地面積達千五百方里。儼然視爲征服地。而猶曰此非「軍事佔領。」或者日人以爲必儘量發揮其軍人之暴性。恣意屠殺。使我領地内人烟絶跡。而後可謂爲「軍事佔領」耶。此事實之足以擊破日人之狡辯者四。</p>
<p>聲明書中之第四點。謂「日政府已訓令满洲駐屯軍司令官派一部軍隊出動吉林。係欲除去對满鐵側面之威脅。一俟目的達到出動部隊即歸還長春。」然而微之事實。則我軍自日暴力發動。即一退再退。絶無抵抗。日暴軍四出。節節進逼。誰爲威脅。誰爲進攻。事實具在。世界共見。退一步言。抿日政府聲明。亦已言「一俟目的達到。出動部隊即歸還長春矣。」而今茲事實則又何如者。吾人不辯。日人之聲明。豈遂能掩蔽事實之眞相。此爲事實之足以擊破日人之狡辯者五。</p>
<p>聲明書中第五點謂「日本對於满洲並無何等領土之野心。自不待言。要使日本臣民。能安心從事和平事業。能以資本勞力得參加開發地方之機會而已。」徵之事實數十年來。日人在我東北經營工商事業。早已旁若無人。甚且我國之工商業及金融。皆在其壟斷操持之下。瀋陽城外所謂南满車站之繁榮。日人各種企業之發達。我國人幾曾加以干預。所謂日本臣民不能安心從事和平事業。及以資本勞力參加開發地方者。究何所指。反之。歷來我國敷設鐵道。日人即横肆干涉。自有完成東北鐵道網系之計劃以後。日人更積極破壞阻撓。務使其不能實現。東北爲我國土。我自起開發。日且無理干涉。而謂我能干涉日人之參加開發。其誰信之。尤有進者。日人爲欲使其臣民得安心從事於和平事業。能以資本勞力參加開發地方。遂不惜實施暴力。佔領我土地。屠戮我人民。東北究爲何國之主權。豈日人能參加開發。我國及不能開發耶。此爲事實之足以擊破日人之雄辯者五。</p>
<p>總之。日本政治。刧於暴力。對内對外。都以少數軍閥之意志爲從違。此次暴行。日政府或初未之知。軍閥自由行動之後。日政府乃從而欲加以掩飾。辭窮理絀。乃不得不横肆狡辯。對内旣政權旁墮。對外則信義全失。而且乘人之危。不宣而戰。旣爲蹂躪公理。抑亦違背國際公法。此種至大之恥辱。日政府亦不惜爲少數軍閥一肩担承。日暮途窮。無理狡辯。直使天昏地暗。日政府固尚有國際信義耶。嗚呼。又何言哉。</p>

<h3 id="c91">爲日本暴行敬告敎育界（二）舒新城 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>第一努力工作　昨日某中校敎師來談及近日學生興奮極了、不僅不能安心求學、且發現擾攘現象、激烈者甚至立刻要投筆從戎、這種情形當是各校所共有、也是中國所以不亡的原素、不過大家要知道、雪恥是要有方法的、絶不能憑一時之氣去亂動、在這種大難的時候、凡屬不必要的事業（如全國運動會）金錢（如奢侈費）固然當停止節省下來、而必要的正當事業與正當支出、則絶不能商省、我們要知道雪恥是我們國民經常職務的一種臨時義務、在此時、我們要盡國民之責、當然不能不負擔此種義務、然而絶不可把經常的責任放棄去專盡此種義務、倘若大家都因爲要負此義務而將其他的職務放棄、則國計民生便將立成問題、所以我們一切國民都當於努力雪恥之外要儘量各事其事、同時於努力各事其事之中、切實謀雪恥之道、學生現在的天職是求學、則一切學生均當從今日起、忠於所學、以爲雪恥的基本、萬不可因爲一時的興奮、將應盡的天職放棄、也不可埋頭書齋、置國事於不問、多少年來「求學不忘救國救國不忘求學」</p>
<p>的口號、今日的敎育界應切實指導學生爲事實之表現、</p>
<p>第二準備實力　日本在現在之所以敢於以横暴的手叚侵略我國、是由於我國力不能勝好、而好自持力能勝我我們要抵禦她絶不是空言所能濟事、應得有切實的力量去對付、這力量可以分爲三種、</p>
<p>一物力我國海通而後、因不平等條約的束縛與國際資本主義的壓迫、生産日就衰落、經濟力遠不如人、所以满蒙的大好河山、不能自己經營、甘讓日人爲我代庖、在現在、我們固然要竭力謀抵抗之方、同時更要顧到將來的永久問題、敎育的責任、不僅是謀一時的補救而當謀國運的昌盛、所以我以爲今後的敎育界應注意下列的幾件事、</p>
<p>甲、經濟絶交這是間接增加物力的方法、以這種消極方法來增加物力、本是痛心的事情、然而在現在却是易行而有效的辦法、還值得敎育界對於學生及民衆努力宣傳切實提倡、</p>
<p>乙、提倡科學這好像是一種遠水不救近火的不急之務、但現在物力之增加、無論是農業品、工藝品、戰用品都是發源於科學、日本之所以有今日之國力、也要受賜於科學、倘若我們的敎育家、在開始改行新敎育制度的時候就努力於此國富至少也要比現在厚一點、然而現在如何、我以爲旣誤於前、不可再誤於後、急起直追、還來得及、須知中國絶不只有對付這次問題就完事、終究要永久立國於世界之上、則現在的亡羊補牢、實是必要、</p>
<p>丙、增進生産知識及技能我國生産衰落、自然是受了國際經濟侵略與不平等條約束縛的影響、而敎育上之專重統治知識、不注意生産知識之灌輸與生産技能之培養、也是很重大的原因、我們要抵抗日本、國内生産與經濟、在平日至少要能自給、庶幾一旦有事、可以從事緊縮、以其餘力與之角觸、倘若平日自顧不暇、遇事更無辦法、這種增加生産的責任、敎育界應從今日起切實與政治家實業家共同分担起來、對於以後的敎育方針、要以增加生産爲唯一旨目、一切學校均當以勞作爲前提、於生産技能的訓練之中、灌輸其生産知識、本此方針持續數十年、以增進國家富力、遇有復仇的機會、自可從實際上與之抵抗二·體力我國國民之體力素有東亞病夫之誚、學校雖亦有所謂體育科目、但除去少數的錦標運動而外、對於體格上之一般訓練、實少有所注意、國民體育之設施尤爲缺乏、日本人的高度重量、平時不及我國人、而其耐勞耐苦進取有爲之精神則遠過於我國民、我要自衞、和平無望、自不能不出於武力解决之一途、武力雖包括軍備上之種種設施、但運用此種設施的是人、我國無論在那方面要求與日本對抗、都非有健全體魄的國民不可、現在的學校敎育對於體育至少當注意下列各事</p>
<p>甲·體格鍛鍊方法有三、一是以各種體操、對於身體各部爲基本鍛鍊養成其耐勞習苦之能力、二是利用各種運動養成青年的武士道的精神、三是實施體格檢查以防止糾正青年之戕賊身體乙·軍事訓練募兵制度終不能存在於世界、要禦外侮、終不能不實行徵兵制、現在中等以上學校本有軍事訓練一科、只以視爲具文、遂少效果、此後除照原有辦法切實進行外、並須擴充其範圍、至於小學、更當於一般學校中採用軍事管理的精神、以期養成有規律的國民、</p>
<p>兩、釐訂體格標準各級學校均當根據現在國民及歐美各國人民的體力、釐訂標準、以後凡體力不及格者、平時不予升級、畢業時不予畢業、　種　　體力的方法、有些敎育家也許以爲未免人　罷、　而中國三十年來不重視體力的軟敎育、却不可以這硬法成之、</p>

<p>暴日以武力强佔我遼寗、吉林以後。全國同胞。一致鼓動悲憤的懷抱。抗日的决心。負起救國雪恥的責任。在此千鈞一髮的時候。大家起來。起來喚醒國魂。挽救汪瀾。誰都認爲目前最急切的工作了。我們的身家性命。可以犧牲。抗日救國。義無反顧。這五六天來。全國同胞。奔走呼號。奮勇當前的氣慨。和禦侮報仇。步伐齊一的方策。可知人心不死。國事尚可有爲。上海市民。於昨日上午十時。假公共體育場開市民大會。到會人數的踴躍。可以說開空前未有的紀錄。觀察羣衆憤激的心理。沸騰的熱血。更覺得有組織有團結的力量。才是偉大與可貴。主席團都是各界各業的領袖。共有七十二人之多。這十幾萬人。在主席團領導之下。有這麽嚴整的秩序。誠然不可多得。可惜事先佈置會場的負責者。似乎太不負責了。連輕而易舉的無線電播音機。也没有裝置。所以主席台上的演說和提案。能有幾個人聽見。距離少遠的無數羣衆。簡直是弄得不知所云。在許多團體之中。工商界居多。郵務工會的救國義勇軍。不脱緣衣本色。個個精神抖擻。甚爲可敬。</p>
<p>總之此次國難。無論宣戰與不宣戰。公理得伸不得伸。我們非充實自己的力量不可。充實的方法。不止一端。努力生産·注重科學·多讀書報·鍛鍊體魄。而最緊要的便是丨不買日貨丨我更希望同胞們。從今日起。服用國貨。减省消費。人人學做堅苦奮鬥布衣生活的甘地。</p>
<p>。尚有各省之土産鑛物。其中以貴陜爲最多。貴州一省。所産鑛物。計有鉛銅錫鐵等等。陜則多石油。上海市列室有二。中有大上海圖說。與夫市政府財政局模型。美輪美奂。彷彿似古宫大殿即依此模型而觀。建設之努力。已可知其大概矣。</p>
<p>路市展覽會。顧名思義。當以道路之建設。及一切需用各品爲主體。故汽車及築路之機械。皆羅列會中。尤以汽車爲應有盡有。若福特奧司汀克雷斯勒道奇等。無不以其最新式之車輛陳列·式樣之美。機械之美。各有所長。觀者得能細加考察。汽車之機械。自易明瞭。際此建設時期。汽車之需用最繁。不可不注意也。</p>
<p>會中有二點。最應注目。一爲陜西所産之石油鑛。一即遼寗迫擊砲廠所出品之國産載重汽車。車中機械。無一非廠内所造。乃我國汽車之第一輛出品。前日。海上道奇福特等汽車公司之工程師。曾細加分析。皆謂較之舶來品。有過無不及。惜日人不顧國際信義。現已佔我東省。迫擊砲廠被毁。幾載心血。遂付東流。未始非一絶大打擊也。願國人速起圖之。陜西石油。出産甚多。以他日建設就緒。汽車之用途殊廣。若專仗運入石油。其漏巵不堪設想。故亦爲一最堪注意之一點。</p>

<p>李先生近來也回家得狠早了，但是夫婦的感情，七前更壞，李夫人屢次和他談話，他總是待理不理，並且常常和傭僕吵閙，一會兒嫌飯菜不好，一會兒又嫌臉水太熱，李夫人也耐着不說什麽。他近來對於家用，一些也不管，李夫人也不問他要，只把自己賺來的薪水貼着使用。在以前伊還能把心廛鬱積的和陳先生談談，現在因爲陳夫人常在家裏，爲避嫌起見，也難得到陳先生屋子裏去坐談，白天在辦公室裏，大家都忙着辦事，又不便多談。往常他們到公司與出公司的時候，總慢慢地步行，一路的有說有笑，現在他總匆匆地雇了街車代步，更是不便談話，伊心裏更是惆悵，覺得男子究竟靠不住，像他這麽温和誠慤的人，也會變心，眞敎人想着心酸，但是伊又想：我和他並没有什麽深切的關係，他是我丈夫的一個朋友，自已也有妻子兒女，現在他妻子又歸了心愛他·他不再和我接近，他是狠不錯，如何可以怪怨他。我假使再去膩着他，那是我的不是了。伊想到這裏，只怨着自己的命運，每天心裏，總是悽苦着一天一天的瘦了下來。</p>
<p>在這時陳先何嘗瞧不出來，也爲伊惆悵着，但是他認爲無能爲力，他只慶幸自己恢復了家庭的愉快生活。他不敢向李夫人問什麽，也不敢向妻子談及李夫人，更不願去勸李先生，但希望把自己的身子，從是非中拔出來。</p>
<p>但是朋友之中，也漸漸知道了這些情形，對於李先生夫婦的不睦，都疑心陳先生搗的鬼。他們每天共出共進，寫字檯是兩對面的，這一間辦公室裏，又只有他們兩個人，自從伊進了公司辦事，夫婦之間更隔膜，都足以證實陳先生有侮辱李先生的名譽，侵越李先生的權利。這些話。陳先生自己是不曾知道，但是外面已閙得狠厲害了。</p>
<p>有一天陳夫人把聽來的話，告訴了陳先生，並且勸他自己謹愼些。</p>
<p>他想敎經理把李夫人辭掉，但是替李夫人想想，眞是可憐，又不能下這辣手；想自己辭職，另外到别處去找一個事做，免得和李夫人每天在一塊兒，但是急切之間又找不到相當的地位，自己的生活狀况，又是一天也不能賦閑的，他眞躊躇極了。</p>

<p>The Administrative Council Has Announced Its Adjournment</p>
<p>No Longer Mediating the Eastern Provinces Incident</p>
<p>(Geneva) Yesterday, Arita received a document from the Japanese government, which was delivered to Lele, the acting chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, this morning. The special committee of the Administrative Council for the Manchurian Incident then held a closed-door meeting in the morning, and in the afternoon, the Administrative Council held an open meeting to consider the Manchurian situation based on the official document from the Japanese government. The atmosphere in the meeting hall was tense, reminiscent of the Administrative Council's discussion of the Corfu incident between Italy and Greece in the past. Today, the glass hall was filled with journalists, League of Nations personnel, and spectators with admission tickets. When the meeting began, ordinary matters unrelated to the Manchurian Incident were dealt with quickly, such as the difficult issue of financial reorganization in Austria-Hungary and the proposal to establish an international agricultural mortgage corporation. Then, the Manchurian issue was mentioned. Chairman Lele spoke first, expressing satisfaction with the tone of the Japanese note, stating that the Japanese government was very eager to ensure a peaceful resolution of the negotiations between China and Japan, and that the majority of the Japanese troops had been withdrawn to within the South Manchurian Railway area. The small number of soldiers currently stationed in Shenyang, Jilin, and other places as a precaution would be withdrawn as soon as the situation permitted. The Administrative Council was pleased to read this. The Administrative Council then discussed this issue for two hours, with the Chinese and Japanese representatives exchanging heated arguments. Arita stated the Japanese government's determination to withdraw all troops from the occupied territories as soon as possible and defended the sincerity of the Japanese government's decision to implement this policy. Shi Zhaoji refuted his remarks and reiterated China's request to send a neutral committee to monitor the Japanese troop withdrawal. The British representative, Cecil, then spoke, attempting to ease the atmosphere, saying that he deeply hoped that the Administrative Council had achieved the objective stipulated in Article 2 of the League of Nations Covenant, that member states must submit their disputes to the League of Nations and act in accordance with the League of Nations' rulings. He believed that both parties could now resolve the matter peacefully themselves, but if that was impossible, the matter could be brought before the Administrative Council again. After the Chinese and Japanese representatives each read documents regarding the current situation, Shi Zhaoji stated that China absolutely placed itself in the hands of the League of Nations, while requesting the League of Nations to ask Japan to immediately withdraw its troops from the occupied Chinese territories. Although the Chinese people nationwide had deep resentment towards the Japanese, since the Japanese military actions of September 19, Japanese people in China had never been disturbed, demonstrating the Chinese government's authority over its people. Arita replied that the Japanese government had responded to China's accusations in its note to the League of Nations. Cecil criticized the Japanese note, saying that in his opinion, sending troops to occupy territory to protect the lives of nationals was an extremely dangerous method. He requested that the Administrative Council instruct a neutral committee to conduct an on-site investigation of the matter. Lele concluded the meeting, saying that the Administrative Council now considered both sides of the dispute to be resolving it in good faith. He believed that Japan would expedite its troop withdrawal and was pleased to hear the Chinese government's promise to protect Japanese people in areas where troops were withdrawing. At this point, Lele announced an adjournment in order to consult with colleagues and allow members to re-examine the issue. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese representative, Minister Shi Zhaoji, declared angrily at the League of Nations Council today that direct negotiations with the Chinese government were absolutely impossible at a time when the Japanese military was forcibly occupying Chinese territory. Shi's remarks were made after Japanese representative Arita notified the Council that Japan did not see the need for the League of Nations to intervene in the Eastern Provinces incident or send an investigative committee, and that the Japanese government was only willing to negotiate directly with China. As a result, Shi was extremely indignant, and his voice even trembled. After sending the aforementioned note, Japanese envoy Arita sent a new note reiterating that Japan had no intention of occupying Chinese territory. The League of Nations Council convened an open meeting at 5:00 PM today. Chinese representative Minister Shi declared that China was unwilling to negotiate directly while the Japanese military was forcibly occupying territory, and reported to the Council that China would assume responsibility for protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents in the area as soon as the Japanese military withdrew from the occupied territories. The Chinese government's ability to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents was clearly demonstrated by the fact that Japanese residents in areas not occupied by the Japanese military were living in peace and security. These Japanese residents had not been disturbed because they were under the protection of the National Government. He also stated that China today placed its country completely at the disposal of the League of Nations, without any reservations. Japanese representative Arita also gave a speech at the Council, stating that the Japanese government was prepared to begin direct negotiations with China immediately in order to reach a satisfactory resolution. He believed that the situation in Manchuria and the relations between China and Japan had progressed to the point where it was possible to abandon China's original proposal and replace it with direct negotiations. After the Japanese representative sent the new note, Minister Shi reiterated his request that the League of Nations order the Japanese military to withdraw to its original locations prior to the 18th of this month, and proposed the establishment of a committee composed of representatives from neutral countries to investigate the situation and date of the Japanese military's withdrawal in Manchuria, in order to report the withdrawal situation to the League of Nations Council. The League of Nations has been greatly troubled since Japan rejected mediation. Now, with the speeches of the Chinese and Japanese representatives, it has been placed in an even more difficult situation. Therefore, people in the League of Nations are greatly disappointed and reluctantly acknowledge that Japan has dealt the League of Nations a major blow. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>London. Today's Times editorial congratulates the League of Nations Administrative Council for the good work it has done in resolving the Sino-Japanese conflict, but states that there is clearly a danger that League of Nations action may encourage Chinese leaders to resist Japan's internationally recognized rights in South Manchuria. It also states that if the Chinese government mistakes sympathy for protection and does not seriously seek a general solution with Japan, then its plan will fail. (Reuter, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">How Strange is the Statement of the Japanese Government (2) <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(III) The third point of the Japanese government's statement states: "After the Japanese army has achieved its objectives, it will immediately withdraw to the railway-affiliated areas." The occupation of Shenyang, Jilin, and other places "is not a military occupation." The occupation of the Yingkou Customs Office, the management of the Sizheng, Shenxin, and other railways, and the dispatch of Japanese troops north of Changchun and to Jiandao are also not facts. This statement by the Japanese government is like covering one's own ears while stealing a bell. First, since the outbreak of violence by the Japanese army on the evening of the 18th, the invasion and occupation of Shenyang have been followed by wanton acts of violence, like wildfire. Attacking cities and seizing land are actively being developed. The so-called "immediately withdrawing to the railway-affiliated areas" - if the Japanese government is not deceiving itself, then this statement is enough to prove that the Japanese are nervous and dare not admit the facts. Second, using violence, infringing on our sovereignty, seizing our cities, and massacring our soldiers and civilians, changing flags, appointing officials, and starting to levy taxes, the occupied area reaches 1,500 square miles, which is clearly regarded as conquered land. And yet, it is said that this is not a "military occupation." Perhaps the Japanese believe that it is necessary to maximize the brutality of their soldiers, arbitrarily slaughter, and make the territory desolate before it can be called a "military occupation"? These are four facts sufficient to refute the Japanese sophistry.</p>
<p>The fourth point in the statement says: "The Japanese government has instructed the commander of the Kwantung Army to dispatch a part of the army to Jilin, in order to remove the threat to the side of the South Manchurian Railway. Once the objective is achieved, the dispatched troops will return to Changchun." However, according to the facts, since the launch of violence by the Japanese army, our army has retreated again and again, without any resistance. The Japanese army is moving in all directions, pressing forward step by step. Who is threatening whom? Who is attacking whom? The facts are there for the world to see. Taking a step back, the Japanese government also said, "Once the objective is achieved, the dispatched troops will return to Changchun." But what is the current situation? We will not argue. Can the Japanese statement conceal the truth of the facts? This is the fifth fact sufficient to refute the Japanese sophistry.</p>
<p>The fifth point in the statement states: "Japan has no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, needless to say. It only wants to enable Japanese subjects to engage in peaceful business with peace of mind and to have the opportunity to participate in the development of the area with capital and labor." In fact, for decades, the Japanese have been engaged in industry and commerce in our Northeast as if there was no one else around. Even our country's industry, commerce, and finance are under their monopoly. The prosperity of the so-called South Manchurian Railway Station outside Shenyang City and the development of various Japanese enterprises - have we ever interfered with them? What exactly is meant by the claim that Japanese subjects cannot engage in peaceful business with peace of mind and participate in the development of the area with capital and labor? On the contrary, whenever our country lays railways, the Japanese have been wantonly interfering. Since there was a plan to complete the Northeast railway network, the Japanese have been actively sabotaging and hindering it, so that it cannot be realized. The Northeast is our country's territory, and we will develop it ourselves. Japan is unreasonably interfering and saying that we can interfere with Japanese participation in development. Who would believe it? What is even more advanced is that in order to enable its subjects to engage in peaceful business with peace of mind and to participate in the development of the area with capital and labor, Japan has not hesitated to use violence to occupy our land and slaughter our people. Whose sovereignty does the Northeast belong to? Is it that only the Japanese can participate in development, and our country cannot? This is the fifth fact sufficient to refute the Japanese eloquence.</p>
<p>In short, Japanese politics are hijacked by violence. Both domestically and internationally, the will of a small number of militarists is followed. The Japanese government may not have known about this violence at first. After the militarists acted freely, the Japanese government then tried to cover it up. When it ran out of words and reasons, it had to resort to sophistry. Domestically, the regime is falling to the side, and internationally, credibility is completely lost. Moreover, taking advantage of people's danger, it waged war without declaring it. It has not only trampled on justice but also violated international law. The Japanese government does not hesitate to shoulder this great shame for the sake of a small number of militarists. With its back against the wall, it resorts to unreasonable sophistry, making the world dark. Does the Japanese government still have international credibility? Alas, what else can be said?</p>

<p>(Moscow) Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov again had a lengthy conversation with Japanese Ambassador Hirota today. The contents are unknown. Political circles are doing their utmost to deny the rumors circulating in London and Paris that the Soviet Russian authorities are preparing to send ten regiments of infantry and cavalry, as well as tanks and fighter planes, to the Manchurian border. With the exception of the government newspaper, Soviet Russian newspapers have uniformly attacked the brutality of the Japanese army. For example, Pravda published a long article commenting on the Manchurian Incident, stating that Japanese imperialists have decided to use violence to occupy the territory of other countries and become the masters of that country. Military occupation of Manchuria is nothing more than an attempt to completely seize the three eastern provinces. The Japanese authorities should bear full responsibility for this kind of behavior. The so-called beautiful names of "legality" and "self-defense" are not enough to conceal this important fact. The newspaper then discussed the actions of the League of Nations regarding this incident, saying that the League of Nations has once again exposed itself as an organization that invades and oppresses small and weak nations. The League of Nations' policy on this incident is self-abandonment, the most shameless thing, and is exactly the same as in the past when dealing with important issues. Japan and the imperialists who manipulate the League of Nations are actually birds of a feather, colluding and dividing China, and do not really want to avoid war. The newspaper also commented on the attitude of the United States, saying that the United States is busy preparing for a world war in the Pacific. The declaration issued by the Washington government, recognizing that Japan's military actions have not violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact, is simply nonsense. The so-called concern of the United States about Japan's aggressive actions is nothing more than that American capitalists are uneasy seeing Japan destroying China and turning it into a Japanese semi-colony.

The Red Army has been divided and gathered in various places east of Chita. Japanese people along the Chinese Eastern Railway are withdrawing in droves, and many women and children in Harbin are going south. It has also been determined that Japan had previously sought the Soviet Union's opinion on Japan's dispatch of troops, and the Soviet Union said it had no opinion, but it actually harbored deep intentions. The Japanese Consul in Harbin, Oohashi, went to various places such as Chita and Boli to investigate military intelligence. It is also confirmed that the Third International and the Japanese Communist Party hope that the war will expand. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) The Japanese military occupation currently extends to Xinmin, Yingkou, Andong, Zhengjiatun, Taonan, Jilin, Yanji, Dunhua, and various cities along the South Manchuria Railway, seemingly with the Twenty-One Demands as the scope. There are rumors of incidents in Huludao, but they have not been confirmed. The news from Jinzhou is unclear. There are no incidents along the Chinese Eastern Railway, Suifenhe, Manchuria, or along the Heilongjiang River. Oohashi, the Japanese Consul in Harbin, went to Vladivostok, Boli, and Chita for negotiations, only returning on the 23rd. He must have obtained Soviet Russian consent beforehand. The Russians claim that the Japanese army will not infringe on the Chinese Eastern Railway and will not interfere. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Strategies for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Shi discussed that it is not necessary for students in Shanghai to strike. Slogans and slogans do not help the facts. Internal encouragement should be given, which will become stronger over time. The calmness of the educational circles in Beiping and the attention of the industrial circles in Shanghai to internal affairs these days can be regarded as progress. For several days, he discussed with various parties the plan to deal with Japan. First, economic severance will promote their reflection, because what the Tokyo warlords and a few capitalists have done must not be approved by cotton weaving merchants in Osaka and the Kanto area. For our country, unless the Northeast restores its original state before the 18th, it must not negotiate with it. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Americans in Beijing</p>
<h3 id="e32">Observe the Manchurian Incident <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An American in Beijing discussed that the one-sided reason given by the Japanese for forcibly occupying Fengtian and Jilin is that diplomatic security guarantees the occupation. In fact, it is the strong bullying the weak. Since the Russo-Japanese War, Japan has always wanted to occupy Southern Manchuria. If it were not for the fairness of the countries, the Japanese army would have occupied it 20 years ago. As the price of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan has already obtained the entire territory of Korea, and has more benefits from the South Manchuria Railway and the leased territory of Lushun and Dalian. Southern Manchuria's land should naturally respect Chinese sovereignty, and all countries hold this view. During the European War, when countries did not have time to look east, Japan suddenly proposed the Twenty-One Demands, forcing China to recognize them. At the Paris Peace Conference, Japan requested a resolution to the Manchurian issue, but there was no decision for a long time. At the Washington Conference, based on the integrity of sovereignty and the independence of territory, Japan also has no way to think about the territory of Southern Manchuria. In the past, the new banking consortium agreement initiated by the United States wanted to make Manchuria's railway industry international investment. Although Japan made a reserved proposal to exclude Manchuria and Mongolia, the countries did not express approval or disapproval. Therefore, the previous Manchurian issue was that countries all adopted a policy of not allowing Japan to swallow it alone. Therefore, China's proposal to the League of Nations and the countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact should be able to obtain a considerable victory. However, in fact, the various places have been ravaged by Japan, and the people are suffering a great immediate loss. However, China has its own position in terms of justice. It also said that the League of Nations has no backing, so it can only make big things smaller and small things disappear. It is probably impossible to rely entirely on the League of Nations for a thorough solution. The League of Nations can only grant China the principle of winning the lawsuit.

<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association of All Circles in the Capital telegraphed to the League of Nations: "During this time when our country is suffering from floods, Japan violated human sympathy, destroyed international law, and invaded our territory, occupying various places in our three provinces and slaughtering our people.

We firmly believe in the existence of fairness and justice in the international community. Therefore, we especially telegraphed to your council, requesting that, in accordance with the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Japan be ordered to withdraw its troops immediately and be responsible for compensating for the losses, and that the culprits be punished to warn the stubborn and strengthen the credibility of your council.

We are telegraphing to Deputy Commander Zhang, saying that the Japanese are using pretexts to send troops, expel our officials, and destroy our barracks. They are now openly occupying our Shenyang, while the consul uses the excuse that he cannot directly stop it. Their attempt to provoke internal chaos has failed, and they are now using violence to occupy our key points in order to continue their long-standing ambition to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. Such wantonness and brutality, disregarding international credibility and being willing to destroy East Asian peace, we will never tolerate as long as we have a breath. Please, Your Excellency, consult with the central government and make a decision as soon as possible. We are military personnel and have a responsibility to defend our country.

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: There is talk that Japan will follow in Britain's footsteps and abandon the gold standard, but this has not yet been confirmed. Although the Minister of Finance claims that Japan has no need for this, the rumors are still very strong. It is rumored that Japan will soon transport 70 million yen worth of cash to the United States to supplement the reserves in New York, because since Britain suspended the gold standard and the Manchurian Incident occurred, Japan's gold reserves in New York have already been depleted.</p>

<p>Telegram from Hangzhou: To all newspaper offices, transferred to all military and civilians across the country, Jian. I recently sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Nanjing, which reads: "Extremely urgent. To the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Nanjing, Jian. The brutality of the Japanese has been fully exposed. The nation and the people are in imminent danger. We earnestly request a declaration of war against Japan. The officers and soldiers of this division vow to be at the forefront, defending the country and resisting foreign aggression. Military service is the duty of a soldier. Please allow us to serve to the death. We beg your decision." The national crisis has arrived. We hope that everyone will rise up together, unite sincerely, eliminate the traitors, reverse the tide, and strive for the survival of the nation. We cannot express enough our expectations. The Special Party Headquarters of the Second Division of the National Government Guard Army of the Chinese Kuomintang, respectfully.</p>
<p>Telegram from Yantai: To all newspaper offices, Jian. Having read the successive telegrams from the Central Executive Committee and Deputy Commander Zhang, as well as telegrams from all parties, we are shocked to learn that the Japanese army has suddenly and violently seized our important locations such as Shenyang, Yingkou, Changchun, Taonan, and Jilin in recent days, slaughtering our officials and people, burning our institutions, and committing extreme acts of cruel murder and plunder. When the terrible news came, our eyes cracked and our hair stood on end. We grieve for the loss of the nation and fear the sinking of China. Anyone with blood would feel the same. At this critical moment, to save the misery of national subjugation, we must eliminate prejudices, quickly cease infighting, unite in spirit, and jointly resist the insult of the sword and axe. With bare hands, we can fight tigers, and the three households will eventually destroy Qin. Gentlemen, revolutionary pioneers, pillars of the party and the nation, your great plans and far-sighted considerations have likely been observed early. Although political views may differ, there is only one goal of saving the country. We value the difficulties of the times and are deeply concerned. Our feelings are urgent for saving the nation and we cannot remain silent. We dare to sincerely telegram and request an immediate cessation of the fighting. We must share weal and woe and work together in harmony, turning swords into ploughshares and establishing the party and the nation. Perhaps the gods will bless us and we will not be invaded by foreign races. The motherland and China must not forget the difficulties of its creation. We offer our words with tears and hope you will consider. Liu Zhennian, Commander of the 21st Division of the Army, and all officers and soldiers respectfully bow.</p>
<p>Telegram from Xinxiang: To all newspaper offices, Jian. The Japanese imperialists, in order to implement their policy of aggression in Manchuria and Mongolia, are actually committing barbaric acts, suddenly attacking our three northeastern provinces, massacring our soldiers and civilians, arresting officials, and destroying our arsenals, airfields, and various fortresses. Now, they are increasing their troops and advancing westward, threatening the entire country. The nation is in imminent danger. Anyone with blood cannot be afraid. We hope that all comrades in arms across the country will rise up together, determined to perish with the Japanese and launch a desperate attack. If we endure humiliation and die, it is better to fight and die. Our blood is boiling, and we are eager to volunteer. We would rather have our blood splashed on the Japanese and die in battle. We hope that the entire country will have this determination, fight against the enemy with one heart, and that the country will have a glimmer of hope. In haste, we wipe away our tears, and we are unable to express ourselves in words. The Preparatory Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the 65th Division of the Army respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Telegram from Zhengding: To Shen Bao, transferred to all fathers, elders, brothers, and fellows across the country, Jian. Japan has occupied our territory, disregarding the League of Nations Covenant and disrupting peace in East Asia. The hatred between China and Japan is irreconcilable. All of our compatriots, at this time of crisis, should unite and gather strength to fight Japan to the death. If the Central Government advocates a declaration of war, our party, government, military, and academic circles in Xingtang are willing to donate our salaries. The merchants and people of the entire county will do their best to help provide war funds. If we can eliminate these Japanese invaders, we will not hesitate to bankrupt our families. A grain of rice in the vast ocean, but we hope that everyone will be of one mind and build a strong fortress. We are eagerly awaiting orders. The Emergency Meeting of All Sectors of Xingtang County on Japanese Invasion of Northeast China respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Telegram from Jiaozuo: To Shen Bao, transferred to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Nanjing, Jian. Japan has invaded and occupied our territory for no reason, massacred our people, which cannot be stopped by appeasement, nor can it be quickly resolved by begging for help from friendly countries. We should concentrate the nation's strength and use force to drive the Japanese troops out of the country as soon as possible. The teachers and students of our school are temporarily providing support. We would rather be ghosts who died in battle than be slaves of a subjugated nation. All faculty, staff, and students of Jiaozuo Institute of Technology in Henan respectfully bow.</p>
<p>Telegram from Xiaogan: To all newspaper offices, public appreciation. The fresh blood of May Thirtieth has not yet dried, and the Wanbaoshan Incident has occurred again. The Japanese imperialists are using every means to plot against us. But reading the newspapers, we see that the Japanese imperialists are still incorrigible, sending tens of thousands of troops to forcibly occupy various important locations in our three northeastern provinces, and have continued to advance aggressively. Judging by their intentions, they want to destroy our nation. Our Central Government has been patient to this point, and can no longer tolerate it. We vow to fight the Japanese imperialists to the death. The survival of the nation depends on this one action. It is critical and fleeting. We hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together, arm themselves against Japan, and be the government's support. We should know that if the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? If the country is lost, where will the family be? Moreover, power and justice cannot coexist. If the Japanese imperialists are not eliminated, the crisis facing China will become more urgent. We would rather be shattered jade than an intact tile. The future of the nation may have a chance. We deeply hope that you will take action immediately. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Conference of All Sectors in Xiaogan County respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Telegram from Manila: Shen Bao, transferred to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, party, military, and government agencies in all provinces across the country, organizations, newspaper offices, and compatriots at home and abroad, public appreciation. The Japanese invaders are rampant, and the world is in common hatred. The overseas Chinese in Manila held a large meeting, and the people were indignant, vowing to perish together. It is unanimously believed that if we retreat an inch, the enemy will advance a foot. The beautiful rivers and mountains are about to perish. Therefore, it is unanimously advocated that we earnestly request the Chairman of the National Government, military and government officials in various places, and all armed comrades to actively fight against Japan and jointly wipe out the shame of Luyang. The duty of overseas Chinese lies in this. No matter what sacrifice is made, we are willing to be the support. The Philippine Overseas Chinese Conference respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Telegram from New York: Shanghai Newspaper Association, transferred to all compatriots across the country, public appreciation. The Japanese bandits occupied Manchuria, killed civilians, and violated our sovereignty. The country is in danger. Please unite and resist with force, and engage in economic sanctions.

<p>Invading and Seizing Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, and Siping Street</p>
<p>Bombarding Our Barracks with Intense Artillery Fire</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Since the night of the 18th, Japan has been implementing its policy of forcibly seizing Manchuria and Mongolia by force, using several divisions to occupy Shenyang, Siping Street, Changtu, Changchun, and other places, capturing key figures in the Northeast's civil and military institutions, and shooting senior frontier officials. The Jinan Massacre is being re-enacted in the Northeast. From the morning of the 19th until I, a humble writer, drafted this dispatch, news from both South and North Manchuria remains cut off. The 30 million people of Northeast China are entirely reduced to the state of slaves of a conquered nation. The details I have gathered are as follows:</p>
<p>First Attack on the Beida Camp: At 9 PM on the evening of the 18th, the artillery regiment of the Japanese garrison in Shenyang, in the name of its commander, telephoned the Northeast Border Defense Command, claiming that Chinese troops from the Beida Camp were dismantling the Liu Changjiang Railway Bridge and damaging the South Manchuria Railway Line near Wenguantun (30 miles from Shenyang), and that the Japanese army was outraged and would take free action. As the responsible personnel of the Border Defense Command were preparing to respond, the Japanese side cut off the phone line. At 10:30 PM, the 41st and 43rd Regiments of the 2nd Division of the Japanese Army, along with an artillery regiment and a hand-held machine gun squad, totaling over 20,000 troops, launched a fierce attack on the Beida Camp outside Shenyang, surrounding the camp's earthen fortifications. They bombarded it with artillery and strafed it with machine guns. Another detachment threw bombs into the camp. The barracks were struck by artillery fire, and a great fire broke out. The sounds of gunfire and artillery were like a continuous string of pearls. The defending soldiers, numbering less than two battalions, were unprepared and, due to prior orders from their superiors, had no intention of resisting and were attempting to withdraw from the camp. However, the Japanese soldiers surrounded the camp and opened fire head-on, resulting in a pile of corpses. By 12:30 AM, the soldiers who had not escaped surrendered. The Japanese army then occupied the entire camp and used bombs to destroy important machinery in the mortar factory. As the Japanese army wreaked havoc, the sound of artillery was heard both inside and outside the city walls. Residents of nearby villages were awakened from their sleep and fled in terror, carrying children and seeking grandchildren, barefoot and bare-backed. The elderly, women, and children cried out on the road, a scene of utter misery. Leaders of the Northeast Border Defense Command and other important institutions, upon hearing the news, were preparing to convene an emergency meeting when a large contingent of Japanese troops attacked from the West Station, Sujiatun, and other locations at 3:05 AM, first occupying the commercial district, confiscating the firearms of the police at various stations, capturing the police, and forcing them to transport ammunition and carry heavy objects. The artillery regiment used artillery to attack the city, destroying important buildings such as the Drum Tower on the north and south sides of Siping Street, the Governor's Office, and commercial areas. Buildings collapsed, and fires raged, visible for dozens of miles. At 3:50 AM, Japanese troops entered the city, occupying the Northeast Border Defense Commander's Office and other important institutions. All communication facilities, such as telephones and telegraphs, were seized. Therefore, after 3 AM, news from Liaoning and Ning'an was cut off. After occupying the city of Shenyang, the 2nd Division of the Japanese Army established its headquarters in the Border Defense Command. At the same time, the headquarters of the Kwantung Army and the Military Police Headquarters were moved to the commercial district. After 5 AM, the Japanese army began to occupy the arsenal, searching for military police and confiscating firearms. They set up artillery in Mawaluwan in the commercial district, bombarding the city to suppress resistance. The residences of leaders of various institutions were placed under surveillance, and they were placed under house arrest, cutting off communication between key figures. Liaoning has completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. At 7 AM this morning, Yingkou was also occupied by the Japanese army, which stationed heavy troops from the army and navy. The 19th and 20th Divisions of the Japanese Army stationed in Korea, upon receiving news of the 2nd Division's occupation of Shenyang, were ordered to advance along the Anfeng Line. At 1 PM on the 19th, its advance unit, the 77th Regiment, arrived at Longshan. The five regiments of the Japanese garrison stationed in Liaoyang, Fushun, and Haicheng also began to move towards Shenyang on the evening of the 19th.</p>
<p>Zang Shiyi and Rong Zhen Captured: Rong Zhen, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Border Defense Commander's Office, and Zang Shiyi, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government, were captured by the Japanese army and imprisoned in the Shenyang Concession. Many other leaders of the Northeast Political Committee, Transportation Committee, and various departments and bureaus were also captured. At 7 PM on the 19th, the Japanese army, with a division and two regiments, a field artillery unit, and a machine gun unit, totaling over 30,000 troops, surrounded the Dadong Camp and the Aviation Department, the airfield, and launched artillery attacks. The Dadong Camp originally housed over 10,000 troops, but due to orders not to resist, they retreated to villages more than ten miles east of the city. The airfield, being at night, could not avoid the attack and had over 30 aircraft destroyed by artillery fire. During the intense Japanese artillery fire, the Dadong Camp and the Aviation Department were completely set ablaze. By the morning of the 20th, the fire had not been extinguished. All the essence of the Northeast over the past decade has been destroyed by fire. At noon on the 19th, General Honjo, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, along with about thirty key personnel of the headquarters, arrived in Shenyang and established a headquarters in the commercial district. At the same time, he issued a public notice to reassure the people, stating that the incident was entirely caused by the humiliation of the Japanese national character by Chinese ambitious warlords and had nothing to do with the general public. He urged everyone to continue their business as usual and threatened to arrest and execute those who spread rumors. He also ordered the garrison to be stationed in various military districts, with the machine gun squad and the entire 2nd Division stationed in the city and the commercial district. The Haicheng garrison brigade and the artillery regiment were stationed in the Beida Camp, the 29th Regiment was stationed in the Dadong Camp, and the 16th Regiment was stationed in the Aviation Department. A 30-mile radius around the city was designated as a restricted area, extending from Wenguantun in the north to Huanggu Village in the west, Sujiatun in the south, and Suanlihong Village in the east. Trenches were dug, and sandbags and barbed wire were piled up in the city and the commercial district, prohibiting entry and exit. The 390,000 residents of Shenyang were all silenced like cicadas in winter, hiding indoors, afraid to go out, fearing massacre by the Japanese army and Japanese ruffians. Siping Street, between Changchun and Liaoning, where a part of Zhang Haipeng's brigade of the Liaoning Army was stationed, was also disarmed by the Japanese army on the morning of the 19th. Siping Street and the area along the Sitol Road were also seized by the Japanese army. The Jinzhou telegraph lines were cut by the Japanese army, and fifty miles of the Beining Road between Huanggu Village and Xinmin was destroyed. Therefore, communication in the Northeast has lost its flexibility.</p>
<p>The Ferocity of the Japanese Attack on Changchun: At 5:10 AM on the 19th, the Japanese garrison in Changchun and the 2nd Battalion of the Gongzhuling garrison, the two regiments of infantry of the Taniguchi Brigade, and an artillery unit were divided into two groups and launched a fierce attack on the artillery battalion of Li Guilin's 8th Brigade of the Jilin Army in Nanling, Changchun, and the two infantry battalions in Kuanchengzi. Battalion Commander Fu of the artillery battalion risked his life to question the Japanese army but was arrested and shot by the Japanese army. The soldiers were furious and resisted from the fortifications. From morning to evening, the Japanese army continuously attacked with fierce artillery fire. Of our 300 soldiers, almost four-fifths of the entire battalion were killed. The survivors lost their ability to resist and were disarmed. The Japanese army then burned 200 barracks and grain stores. At the same time, the three infantry battalions in Kuanchengzi were disarmed without resistance. At 3 PM, the Japanese army presented three conditions to the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office: (1) Release Hao Yongde; (2) Voluntarily surrender police weapons; (3) The Japanese army will maintain order in the city. The Municipal Preparatory Office refused, and the Japanese army used artillery to bombard the city streets. The busiest streets were destroyed by artillery fire, and the fire was intense. The Japanese army also surrounded the Diplomatic Office and the County Government, set fire to them, and abducted Zhou Yuping, the head of the Municipal Affairs Office, Xiu Changyu, the head of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Sun Peichen, the head of the Special Police Department of Kuanchengzi Station, and dragged them into the streets and shot them. County Magistrate Ma Zhongyuan and Lu Qi, head of the County Public Security Bureau, were abducted. After 8 PM, part of the Japanese army moved into Wanbaoshan and destroyed 30 kilometers of the railway between Changchun and Yijianbao. All the Russian railway staff in the two stations of Changchun and Kuanchengzi were abducted, beaten, and looted. Chang Zunyi, the sixth section chief of the railway police, was whipped, his body covered with scars, and forced to provide supplies. Two railway staff members and two switchmen were shot and killed for refusing to allow the Japanese army to confiscate station equipment. The Japanese flag was once hung between Changchun and Kuanchengzi. On the night of the 19th, artillery fire was still faintly heard at Mishazi Station (over a hundred miles from Changchun). All passenger and freight trains between Harbin and Changchun only ran to Yaomen Station (200 miles from Changchun). Telegrams and telephone lines were cut off after 10 PM on the night of the 19th after being taken over by the Japanese army, cutting off news. The Japanese army built a light railway overnight from Changchun to Yijianbao, and the troops seemed to be heading towards Harbin.</p>
<p>Russia Increases Troops Outside Manchuria: It seems that the Japanese military action has the understanding of Soviet Russia. The Japanese Consul in Harbin, Ohashi, is still staying in Boli and has not returned. Kuznetzov, the Russian Vice President of the East China Railway, returned from Dalian early on the 18th, presumably having reached an agreement with the Commander of the Kwantung Army in Dalian. Therefore, in the incident on the 19th, the Japanese soldiers only stopped at Changchun. However, according to a telegram from Manchuria, over 10,000 Soviet Russian troops have arrived at Dawuli outside Manchuria, riding in several train carriages. The locomotives are firing up, appearing to be entering our territory to seize the right to protect the East China Railway. The Headquarters of the Railway Protection Army here has ordered the border troops to pay extra attention and report at any time. Also, Orlov, the Russian Consul in Harbin, visited Zhong Yu, the diplomatic representative, on the 19th, asking him to pay attention to protecting Russian nationals and the traffic of the East China Railway, implying that Russian troops would enter. Today, Matsumoto, a secretary from the Japanese Consulate in Harbin, went to the Diplomatic Office to declare that the Japanese army would never enter Harbin. However, the communication facilities south of Changchun have been taken over by the Japanese army, so the truth can only be based on general reports and the East China Railway's telegrams. The only external communication facility in the Northeast is a radio station in Harbin. The station is a shortwave machine and does not communicate directly with Tianjin, Shanghai. On the evening of the 19th, due to the urgency of the matter, it had to work all night to communicate with Shanghai. On the morning of the 20th, it was able to communicate with Beiping again. Official reports from all parties rely on this only remaining machine, but it can only communicate at 6 PM every day, and news telegrams are squeezed out by official reports. On the evening of the 19th, Orlov, the Russian Consul in Harbin, visited the Japanese Consul and had a long secret talk. On the morning of the 20th, the Japanese army at Changchun Station received a telegram from the Japanese Consul in Harbin, removed the Japanese flag, and only allowed Russian personnel to enter the station to work and repair the damaged tracks. Traffic is expected to resume during the day. On the evening of the 19th, the Harbin Chief Executive's Office convened a meeting attended by the leaders of various institutions, deciding on measures to protect the city and its foreign residents. The Chief Executive's Office immediately issued the following instructions: "It has been reported since the morning of the 19th that Japanese troops are taking free action in Liaoning, Changchun, and other places. Communication facilities have been destroyed, and news is cut off, making the truth unclear. This port is a mixed settlement of Chinese and foreigners and is an international market. Local security is of great importance. Therefore, this office convened a meeting today with various institutions and chambers of commerce to discuss ways to maintain security. Coincidentally, the Changchun Telegraph Bureau and the Harbin Telephone Bureau sent a telegram, which Director Xu read to the audience. The telegram stated that in the Changchun Incident, our army, except for two battalion commanders who died and the artillery regiment which retreated to Xinlizhi, 40 miles from Changchun, all military and police agencies have been disarmed. Changchun is still maintained by the Public Security Bureau and is still peaceful. Post-incident arrangements are being negotiated. Therefore, the situation in Changchun is tending towards peace, and all matters should gradually be resolved through negotiation. The rumors circulating outside are mostly untrue. After this meeting, the military and police agencies will be fully responsible for maintaining order in this port. All merchants and residents must maintain their businesses and not lightly believe rumors or cause disturbances that damage the financial system. In addition to separate instructions, this order is hereby issued to the Chamber of Commerce to immediately notify all merchants to comply. Chief Executive Zhang Jinghui." (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Shenyang Has Become a Dead City <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>British and American Businesses Have Japanese Military Revoke Restrictions</p>
<p>Chinese Bankers Are Negotiating Business Opening Matters</p>
<p>Shenyang Residents Fleeing Have Exceeded 100,000</p>
<p>Demei Evening News, Shenyang, 25th: Several British and American businesses here have jointly petitioned the Japanese military authorities today to allow merchants and residents to resume business. The signatories include Citibank, HSBC, British American Tobacco Company, Arnhold Trading Company, Jardine Matheson, Ewo Trading Company, Asiatic Petroleum Company, and others. Their intention is to request the Japanese military commander to lift various restrictions so that large Chinese banks can open for business. With the closure of large Chinese banks, domestic and foreign trade has completely stopped. Yesterday, Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Bank of China, arrived here from Shanghai to negotiate this matter with the Japanese, but the outcome is unknown. Currently, Shenyang can be said to be a dead city in terms of business, except for retailers of food and daily necessities. The only activity seen today is the movement of Japanese troops and the departure of refugees from the city. Shenyang has a population of 400,000, and according to today's statistics, those who have fled to other places have exceeded 100,000. The streets are filled with various vehicles loaded with furniture and luggage, leaving the city in an endless stream. Chinese officials and police have long since fled, and there is not a single person who can negotiate with the Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Fall of Changchun <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Launch Surprise Attack at Dawn</p>
<p>Over 1,000 Innocent Chinese Soldiers and Civilians Killed or Wounded</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: Various groups of the South Manchuria Japanese Autonomous League held repeated meetings, actively advocating using the Nakamura Incident as a pretext to exert pressure by force and implement the occupation of Manchuria. They repeatedly telegraphed for troops, unable to wait. The result of the meetings of Japanese officials and civilians in Changchun was that they strongly advocated that the issue must be resolved by force. As a result, on the 18th and 19th, Liaoning and Changchun were completely occupied by the Japanese army. The following is an investigation into the Japanese army's pre-attack preparations and the attack itself:</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Pre-Attack Preparations: Kanakawa Nakazo, commander of the 3rd Brigade of the Japanese Army stationed in Changchun, and Brigade Commander Taniguchi Terugo believed that since the Japanese military in Shenyang had already launched an attack, the Japanese military in Changchun should also respond simultaneously. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 18th, at 4-5 PM, they distributed pamphlets calling up reservists to assemble and await orders, but our side was unaware. At 9-10 PM, they used city buses to secretly transport Japanese residents and property to the concession, with a dozen or so buses shuttling back and forth, but our side did not notice. Around midnight, to conceal their actions from the Chinese, the Japanese army used a dozen or so fire trucks to secretly transport over 200 large guns and distribute them to Japanese police (Japanese police do not normally carry guns). The rest were distributed to Japanese merchants, and reservists were summoned to await orders to depart. At 12:50 AM, Japanese military police received secret orders from Kanakawa and Taniguchi to deploy troops to guard all areas from the Dongda Bridge to the West Park, from the south to the Park Yashima Bridge, from the north to Erdaogou Sanbuguan, and the South Gouyan area of the Middle East Railway Station, and to deploy ambushes and sentries in the nearby sorghum fields. Armed police were stationed at all key intersections, patrolling and guarding. By 2 AM on the 19th, the military deployment was complete, and at 3:35 AM, the order for a general attack was given. At 4 AM, the artillery roared, and death was everywhere.</p>
<p>Attack on the Erdaogou Barracks: Taniguchi, commander of the 3rd Brigade of the Japanese Army stationed in Changchun, acting on the orders of Commander Kanakawa, at 3:35 AM on the 19th, commanded the brigade's 4th Regiment Commander Oshima and others to lead a detachment of about 350-360 soldiers, carrying 4 machine guns and 2 landing guns, to attack the headquarters of the 3rd Battalion of our Northeast Army in Erdaogou. After the Japanese soldiers arrived, they first set up guns and cannons in front of the camp, and then surrounded our battalion headquarters. Fu Guanjun, commander of the 3rd Battalion of our army, had received a telegram from Commander Xi Dai of the Jilin Border Defense Command on the night of the 18th, stating that if the Japanese army attacked, they should not resist and should retreat completely, awaiting a negotiated settlement. Because of the order, they did not resist. Japanese soldiers first surrounded the 3rd Battalion. A certain Japanese military officer broke into the camp to meet Battalion Commander Fu. Fu asked what he wanted, and the Japanese officer said he wanted to disarm them. Fu replied that they could retreat, but they would not disarm. Unexpectedly, the Japanese military officer suddenly drew a pistol and shot Battalion Commander Fu dead on the spot. At this time, the Japanese army outside the camp opened fire, strafing with machine guns. Japanese soldiers on both sides attacked with rifles, and the ambushes to the south and outside opened fire simultaneously, attacking our Erdaogou Station and the 3rd Battalion headquarters. When the soldiers of our 3rd Battalion saw that Battalion Commander Fu had been shot dead, they began to resist. The Japanese army took advantage of our unpreparedness and the order to retreat, and the 3rd Battalion soldiers were naturally no match. From 4:11 AM, the attack began, and the artillery fire only subsided at 8:22 AM. As a result, all the soldiers of the 3rd Battalion were disarmed. In addition to Battalion Commander Fu being shot dead by the Japanese military officer on the spot, 80-90 soldiers of the 3rd Battalion were killed, 40-50 were wounded, and 260-270 civilians were killed by Japanese artillery fire. On the Japanese side, over 30 were killed and over 10 were wounded. The auditorium of the 7th Middle School of the Special District of the East Province was destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, the roof was blown off, and over 20 student dormitories were also destroyed. Few of the school's buildings remained. 30-40 students were killed, and over 20 were wounded. The Middle East Railway police were all disarmed by the Japanese army. The surviving students of the 7th Middle School were also placed under surveillance and house arrest, and were not allowed to enter or leave. Both telephone and telegraph lines were also cut by the Japanese army, cutting off news. Detailed figures for the dead and wounded could not be verified. However, all military, government, police, and educational institutions in Erdaogou were occupied by the Japanese army, and troops were stationed there to guard them, prohibiting people from passing through. This is the true picture of the Japanese army's attack on Erdaogou.</p>
<p>Occupying the Nanling Barracks: Kanakawa, commander of the 3rd Brigade of the Japanese Army, and Brigade Commander Taniguchi, using the 4th Regiment and the garrison to attack Erdaogou, was as easy as turning over a hand. However, the Jilin army had a large number of troops stationed in Nanling, numbering over two regiments, and they were deeply afraid that their forces were weak and difficult to conquer. Therefore, they telegraphed for part of the Japanese Marine Corps garrison in Fanjatun and Gongzhuling, about 350-360 soldiers, to assist in attacking Nanling. After receiving the order, the troops arrived in Changchun on the 5 AM South Manchuria train. Under the command of Brigade Commander Taniguchi, about 150-160 soldiers from the 4th Regiment and part of the garrison attacked our Nanling Barracks from both sides. Mu Chun Chang, commander of the 19th Artillery Regiment of the Northeast Army in Nanling, and Ren Guodong, commander of the 671st Regiment, had both received orders to retreat. When the Japanese army advanced, they thought it was a live-fire exercise and did not report or prepare. At this time, most of the officers and soldiers were asleep. When the Japanese army opened fire and attacked fiercely, they realized something was wrong, but our army had no time to retreat. At that time, a detachment of the Japanese army, numbering several dozen soldiers, jumped over the rear camp wall and stabbed soldiers with bayonets and short knives, killing everyone they saw and shooting them. As a result, our officers and soldiers were unable to resist, and dozens were killed on the spot. The rest of the troops retreated in the east, west, and south directions. Seeing our troops retreating, the Japanese army used field, mountain, and mortar guns to provide cover for the general attack and strafed and shot with machine guns. Our infantry regiment's guns and cannons were not lost, but the armory had been locked by the clerks, and all the ammunition was stored inside. It was reported that it was destroyed by the Japanese army, and a large number of guns and ammunition were looted. From 5:11 AM on the 19th, the general attack began. During the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th hours, as the soldiers of the artillery and infantry regiments of our side were retreating, and as the farmers on Nanling Street were fleeing, the Japanese army's artillery and machine gun fire was extremely fierce. This was the period when our soldiers and civilians suffered the most casualties. Seeing our soldiers retreating, the Japanese army still supervised its troops to pursue, attacking from all sides and intercepting from all directions, shooting everyone they saw, regardless of whether they were soldiers or civilians, without exception. This was the first period when our soldiers and civilians suffered the most casualties. By 11-12 o'clock, all of our soldiers had retreated to the Jichang Station east of the river, the Yujia Oil Mill south of the city, and the Diaojia Yamaguchi area. Only a small number of soldiers remained, and because they had no time to retreat, they were trapped in the camp and resisted with their lives. The Japanese army's artillery and machine guns continued to attack fiercely. The soldiers of our army who were trapped in the camp were all buried in the Japanese artillery fire. The artillery fire gradually subsided until 1:20 PM, and all parts of our Nanling camp were completely occupied. At 2:53 PM, a cavalry detachment of the Japanese army arrived from Datun Xiaozhan to reinforce the front, numbering about 170 soldiers, carrying 4 machine guns and 2 cannons. The artillery fire immediately intensified. In addition to destroying our army's camp headquarters, the cavalry and infantry jointly attacked our ammunition depot. In fact, our soldiers guarding the depot had already withdrawn. The Japanese army knew this, but deliberately used artillery and gunfire to attack. Nearby villagers' houses were destroyed by Japanese artillery, and countless fleeing farmers were killed. This was the third period when our farmers suffered the most casualties. In short, from 5:11 AM to 5:35 PM, the Japanese army's artillery fire completely stopped. Reporters risked their lives to investigate, but were unable to pass because the Japanese army was guarding the pass. Only a general number was obtained. In Nanling, about 250-260 of our soldiers were killed, 30-40 were wounded, and about 170-180 civilians and rural farmers were killed, and over 30 were wounded. At present, all departments of our army's camp in Nanling have been completely occupied by the Japanese army, and troops have been sent to guard them, setting up posts and sentries.</p>
<p>Burning Barracks and Ammunition Depot: When the Japanese army attacked Nanling, they first set fire to the Changchun County military firewood and grass depot and the grain depot, burning over 300,000 bundles of our army's firewood and 250,000-260,000 bundles of straw. Then they attacked the Nanling Barracks, and after occupying them, at around 2 PM, the Japanese army jointly surrounded the ammunition depot. They were deeply afraid that there would be ambushes in the ammunition depot to resist, but they did not know that they had already withdrawn. The Japanese army deliberately attacked with artillery and strafed with machine guns, bombarding for 5-6 hours. In addition to destroying most of the nearby civilian houses, they also burned all the barracks of our infantry and artillery camps and the barracks of the 2nd and 3rd battalions. At 5:20 PM, they also used artillery to bombard and burn our ammunition depot. For a time, the flames soared into the sky, and the explosions of the ammunition were like thunder. Many of our farmers were killed by the Japanese army. Many of the houses of the villagers in Nanling were destroyed by artillery. Our army did not resist, and the Japanese army suffered no more than 10-20 deaths, and the exact number is not known. From 5 AM on the 19th to 9 PM, the sound of gunfire and artillery subsided slightly. Civilian houses and barracks were still engulfed in flames. (Evening of the 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e83">News from the Northeast after the Incident <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>A Momentary Scare in the City</p>
<p>Consuls of Various Countries Jointly Maintain Order</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Since the Japanese army violently occupied Shenyang, Jilin, and other places, according to news from here yesterday, the western route has already extended to Xinmin, and the eastern route is still planning to invade Harbin. Military actions are escalating, which is truly an unprecedented disgrace to our country. In recent days, a large number of refugees fleeing from Shenyang have moved west to Pingjin. These people, carrying their sons and daughters, have nothing on them. When asked about their suffering, it is truly hair-raising. Important officials in Shenyang, such as Rong Zhen, Chen Xingya, Lao Mian, Zhu Guangmu, Huang Xiansheng, and Zhang Zhenlu, all escaped in disguise from Shenyang, took trains at Huanggu Tun, and arrived in Tianjin and Ping separately. Governor Zang Shiyi is still under surveillance and is said to be difficult to release for the time being. Telegraph and telephone communications between Pingjin and Shenyang City have been cut off by the Japanese army since the 18th night and have not yet been restored. The railway from Huanggu Tun to Shenyang has been dismantled by the Japanese army. The Beining railway only runs to Huanggu Tun. Yesterday, the army also occupied Xinmin. It is still doubtful whether the train can still run to Huanggu Tun today. The public sentiment here is extremely agitated. Various organizations and schools have established anti-Japanese national salvation associations. However, because the authorities instructed all parties to maintain a calm attitude, they only held meetings for discussion and did not make any extensive displays. The restrictions on the military and police are particularly strict. Those wearing uniforms are not allowed to enter the Japanese concession. The Japanese Tianjin Command and the police department have recently secretly dispatched plainclothes military police detectives to spy on and report on important places in our country, various provincial and municipal government agencies, and are very active. Therefore, our side is also paying close attention to protecting bridges and all transportation, such as electric lights and telephones, to prevent damage by the Japanese. The Japanese army planned to hold field maneuvers at Haiguang Temple yesterday. Deputy Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Goto, verbally notified the city's Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday afternoon. The bureau did not investigate deeply and immediately agreed. When it was reported to Governor Wang Shuchang, he strongly disapproved and criticized them for not asking for instructions in advance and for acting rashly. After the news of the Japanese army's maneuvers spread in the city, the whole city was greatly shaken. At the same time, the Japanese side spread rumors in the city, saying that several Japanese warships, carrying more than 15,000 Japanese soldiers, had arrived at Tanggu and landed, and were about to attack Tianjin. As a result, rumors spread, and within a few hours, the whole city was in a state of terror. Residents in the Chinese area rushed to various concessions by car at night to take refuge, and it continued all night without stopping. The Public Security Bureau was unable to stop it. Governor Wang Shuchang returned to the provincial government from his private residence around 2 a.m. to discuss security measures. He temporarily consulted with the consuls of various countries stationed in Tianjin and jointly notified the Japanese Consulate General, requesting them to inform the Japanese army to stop the maneuvers. The Japanese army then agreed to suspend them. As a result, the people's hearts were slightly stabilized yesterday, and those who had moved to the concessions returned home one after another. Wang Shuchang convened a meeting of provincial and municipal authorities at the provincial government at 5 p.m. yesterday to maintain the city's security. The meeting ended at 7 p.m. The consuls of various countries stationed in Tianjin, in order to thoroughly protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese, also held a meeting at the American Consulate to discuss ways to protect overseas Chinese. As a result, in the name of the consular corps, they notified the Japanese side that they must not engage in acts that would disrupt public order or provoke incidents. They also appointed American Consul Jervey to personally visit the provincial and municipal authorities to discuss effective protection of overseas Chinese in Tianjin and formulated four important measures: (1) When necessary, the armies of various countries will jointly form a maintenance team and station them at train stations and key points to prevent dangerous incidents of intrusion from outside the city. (2) At present, four American warships and one British warship are anchored 20 to 25 miles outside Dagukou. Four more American warships will arrive in Tianjin within a few days. Belgium and Italy will each have one ship coming to Tianjin. When necessary, French warships can arrive in a short period of time, providing mutual protection regardless of borders. (3) In the special district, a large number of overseas Chinese from various countries live together. The American barracks are relatively close, and it has been decided that American soldiers will be responsible for protection when necessary. (4) British warships are anchored outside Qinhuangdao, and a part of the fleet will be dispatched to the Kai Luan mining area to provide protection in the near future. Overall, the situation in Tianjin is such that because there are so many overseas Chinese from various countries, any changes would have a huge international impact. Various countries will do their best to maintain it, and there should be no danger. (September 24)</p>

<p>Five Men and Women Drown while Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival: Fengtangjing in the 11th District (Nanyan City) is about 20 miles away from Tangkou Town. The day before yesterday (the 25th) in the afternoon, 24 men and women from the local villages planned to go to Tangkou Town to buy items for celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar. They hired a small boat to go to town for shopping. By about 5 p.m., they had all finished their purchases and were returning home on the same boat. When they arrived at a place near the bridge, a sudden wind and waves caused the boat to capsize. Fortunately, a fishing boat passed by and tried to rescue them. As a result, 19 men and women were rescued, but one young girl, one young woman, one old woman, and two men could not be rescued. It was truly tragic.</p>

They were then transferred to the provincial military law joint trial office for trial. On the 25th, the provincial office returned the Wu and Yang criminals to the county government for retrial.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Inferior Goods Transshipped by Post Office from Shanghai to Various Counties in Northern Jiangsu: In the past month, the number of packages has been particularly large. The Nantong Post Office could not transship them in time, and they were piled up like mountains. All of them contained inferior goods. According to postal workers, every time after the economic boycott against Japan, inferior goods are often sent in packages. This year is more than ever before.</p>
<p>Disaster Victims from the Lixiahe Area are Returning Home in Batches: Disaster victims from various counties in the Lixiahe area of ​​northern Jiangsu were previously transported to Nantong by the rescue team. Currently, the first batch of more than 100 disaster victims voluntarily returned home and were sent by the disaster relief association on hired boats.</p>
<p>Police and Militia Jointly Suppress Sea Bandits: Along the coast of Tongruhai, bandit ships have been appearing irregularly recently. Areas such as Lüsi and Juegang have been heavily disturbed. Currently, the water and land police teams and the defense corps of various counties are jointly suppressing them, and the ports are under martial law to prevent the bandits from fleeing.</p>
<p>Clearing Accounts and Investigating Fraud in the Mang Cao Case: Li Baoshen and others involved in the Mang Cao fraud case in Tongyi have been sent to the Finance Department for custody. The Mang Cao string ticket booklets over the years have all been sent to the Finance Department. Because the string surface knots have been torn off, it is necessary to clear the accounts one by one to see if they match the reported amount of silver, so that the truth can be thoroughly investigated. Director Xu has appointed six staff members and borrowed six staff members from the Zhenjiang County Finance Bureau to jointly verify the accounts to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>

<p>Special Report on Educational News</p>
<h3 id="e90">A Call to the Educational Community Regarding Japan's Atrocities (II) by Shu Xincheng <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>First, Work Hard: Yesterday, a middle school teacher came to talk about how excited the students have been recently, not only unable to concentrate on their studies but also displaying disruptive behavior. The more radical ones even want to drop their pens and join the army immediately. This situation is common in all schools and is the reason why China will not perish. However, everyone must know that there must be a method to avenge humiliation. One cannot act recklessly based on temporary emotions. In this time of great disaster, all unnecessary undertakings (such as the National Games) and money (such as luxury spending) should be stopped and saved. However, necessary and legitimate undertakings and legitimate expenditures must not be reduced. We must know that avenging humiliation is a temporary obligation of our citizens in addition to their regular duties. At this time, we must fulfill our responsibilities as citizens and, of course, cannot fail to shoulder this obligation. However, one must never abandon regular responsibilities to focus solely on fulfilling this obligation. If everyone abandons their other duties because they want to fulfill this obligation, the national economy and people's livelihood will immediately become a problem. Therefore, all of us citizens should do our best in our respective jobs in addition to working hard to avenge humiliation. At the same time, while striving to do our best in our respective jobs, we must earnestly seek ways to avenge humiliation. The current duty of students is to study. Therefore, all students should be loyal to their studies from today onwards as the foundation for avenging humiliation. One must never abandon one's duty because of temporary excitement, nor bury oneself in books and ignore national affairs. The slogan "Study without forgetting to save the country, save the country without forgetting to study" for many years should be earnestly guided by the educational community today to become a reality.</p>
<p>Second, Prepare Strength: The reason why Japan dares to invade our country with tyrannical means is because our country's strength is not as good as theirs. To resist them, empty words cannot help. We must have real strength to deal with them. This strength can be divided into three types:</p>
<p>First, Material Resources: After China opened its ports, due to the constraints of unequal treaties and the oppression of international capitalism, production has declined day by day, and its economic strength is far inferior to others. Therefore, the great rivers and mountains of Manchuria cannot be managed by ourselves and are willingly handed over to the Japanese to act as agents for us. At present, we must of course strive to find ways to resist. At the same time, we must also consider the long-term problems of the future. The responsibility of education is not only to seek temporary remedies but also to seek the prosperity of the country. Therefore, I believe that the educational community should pay attention to the following things in the future:</p>
<p>A. Economic Boycott: This is a way to indirectly increase material resources. It is painful to increase material resources in this negative way. However, it is an easy and effective way at present. It is still worthwhile for the educational community to vigorously publicize and earnestly promote it to students and the public.</p>
<p>B. Promote Science: This seems like a distant water that cannot put out a nearby fire, but the increase in material resources now, whether agricultural products, handicrafts, or war supplies, all originate from science. The reason why Japan has its national strength today is also due to science. If our educators had worked hard on this when they started to implement the new education system, the country's wealth would at least be a little thicker than it is now. However, what is it now? I believe that if we made a mistake in the past, we must not make it again in the future. It is still not too late to catch up. We must know that China will not be finished by dealing with this problem alone. After all, it must stand permanently in the world. Therefore, it is necessary to mend the fold after the sheep is lost now.</p>
<p>C. Increase Production Knowledge and Skills: The decline in production in our country is naturally affected by international economic aggression and the constraints of unequal treaties. The emphasis on governing knowledge in education and the lack of attention to the inculcation of production knowledge and the cultivation of production skills are also very important reasons. If we want to resist Japan, domestic production and economy must at least be self-sufficient on weekdays, so that we can tighten up when something happens and use our remaining strength to deal with them. If we can't take care of ourselves on weekdays, we will have no way to deal with things. The educational community should earnestly share the responsibility of increasing production with politicians and industrialists from today onwards. The only purpose of the future education policy should be to increase production. All schools should take labor as a prerequisite and instill production knowledge in the training of production skills. If we continue this policy for decades to increase the country's wealth, we can resist it in practice when we have the opportunity to take revenge. Second, Physical Strength: Our country's people have long been called the "Sick Man of East Asia." Although schools also have so-called physical education subjects, except for a few championship sports, little attention is paid to general physical training. Facilities for national physical education are even more lacking. The height and weight of the Japanese may not be as good as ours on weekdays, but their spirit of enduring hardship, being enterprising, and being promising far exceeds that of our people. If we want to defend ourselves, and peace is hopeless, we cannot but resort to the path of military solution. Although military force includes various facilities in military preparation, it is people who use these facilities. Whether in any aspect of requiring confrontation with Japan, our country must have people with sound physiques. The current school education should pay at least attention to the following matters for physical education:</p>
<p>A. There are three methods of physical training: one is to use various gymnastics to carry out basic training for various parts of the body to cultivate the ability to endure hardship; the second is to use various sports to cultivate the spirit of Bushido in young people; and the third is to implement physical examinations to prevent and correct the injury of young people's bodies. B. Military training: The conscription system will ultimately not exist in the world. If we want to resist foreign aggression, we will ultimately have to implement a conscription system. At present, secondary and above schools have a subject of military training, but it is only regarded as a formality, so there is little effect. In the future, in addition to proceeding earnestly according to the original method, its scope must also be expanded. As for primary schools, the spirit of military management should be adopted in general schools in order to cultivate disciplined citizens.</p>
<p>Two, determining physical standards: all levels of schools should set standards based on the physical strength of the current people and the people of European and American countries. In the future, those whose physical strength fails to meet the standards will not be promoted on weekdays and will not graduate at graduation. Some educators may think that the method of physical strength is a bit too much, but China's soft education, which has not paid attention to physical strength for 30 years, cannot be achieved by this hard method.</p>

This time, I left without saying goodbye, fearing your persuasion and causing you more pain. The enthusiasm of you four brothers is enough to awaken the ambition of today's youth. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival. The moonlight on Jiangwan Road is bleak. Looking at the scenery, I miss you dearly and recite the line 'I cannot bear to look back upon my homeland in the bright moonlight,' overwhelmed with grief and anger. The autumn wind is strong, please take care of yourself for the sake of the country."</p>

<p>The City First Public Stadium holds an athletic meet every year on National Day, both to celebrate the Xinhai Revolution and to promote public sports. However, as the violent Japanese occupy our eastern provinces, with the country facing a great crisis, the whole nation is in grief and united in resisting Japan. Although promoting sports is important, morale is low, and few people are participating, as expected. Therefore, the stadium has decided to postpone this year's National Day athletic meet until next year.</p>

<p>After Big Jump in Silver</p>
<p>American Bank Also Rises to 38 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, September 26th, happened to be the Mid-Autumn Festival of the Lunar Calendar. Therefore, all foreign banks and money industry associations, etc., followed the usual practice of resting for a day. There were no reports on all foreign exchange finance and other markets. However, a telegram from London (September 25th) said that the market rose initially due to a lack of sellers. It was reported that the silver market sequence was completely in an extraordinary state. It was also said that due to Indian silver companies buying in, the market softened after closing. American silver then turned to soar rapidly, even more so than before, with a tendency to go straight to the clouds, opening an unprecedented great rising trend and discovering a new era in twenty years, a rare change since ancient times. The opening of the (Monday) standard gold market is more ominous than auspicious. Another telegram from New York said that the price of American silver also rose sharply by 1.875 cents, already breaking through the threshold of 30 cents. The spot price is 31 cents, and the British exchange rate against the US dollar fell by 8 cents to 3.80 yuan. There were no telegrams between the US dollar and the British pound, and the British exchange rate against the US dollar rose by one and a half pennies to 2 shillings and 8.5 pence. There were no telegrams between London and Shanghai shillings, and the spot price in Mumbai rose sharply by 3 rupees and 2 annas to 5 annas, totaling 51 rupees and 8 annas. The market situation is very firm, it is said.</p>

<p>Returning to a Small 3 and 1/8 Pence</p>
<p>A Reuters telegram from London on the 26th reported that the price of silver suddenly shrank again. The recent price was 16 pence and 3/8, and the distant price was 16 pence and 9/16, a drop of 3.125 pence compared to the closing price on Friday of the previous day.</p>
<p>Review of Last Week's Securities Market</p>
<p>Securities Prices Had Unprecedented Fluctuations; Both Rises and Falls Were Extremely Severe</p>
<p>Market Conditions Were Very Prosperous, with Transactions Reaching 150 Million</p>
<p>During the past week (from September 21st to 26th), the bond market of the Shanghai Securities Exchange was extremely lively due to the huge fluctuations in prices. Even as the settlement date approached, all parties were actively trading, and the transaction volume broke the highest record of the past. It was found that throughout the week, except for Saturday, which was the Mid-Autumn Festival and the market was closed, and Friday, when this month's futures had stopped trading and November's futures had not yet opened, only October's futures were traded at over 16.6 million. Other days, such as Monday, accounted for 24.7 million, and Wednesday and Thursday each accounted for 33.04 million, while Tuesday even reached a huge 45.9 million yuan. The total transaction volume for the entire week reached 155.01 million yuan, an increase of over 26.7 million yuan compared to the previous week. This was because, in addition to the large-scale trading of unified salt tax, 20 customs duties, etc., the prices of 20 bonds, 19 customs duties, good deeds, disarmament, and demobilization all fell sharply, and transactions also became very active. Among them, the unified tax accounted for 38.56 million yuan, with 19.93 million yuan in September and 18.63 million yuan in October. The salt tax accounted for 25.045 million yuan, with 13.12 million yuan in September and 12.125 million yuan in October. The 20 customs duties accounted for 28.815 million yuan, with 16.845 million yuan in September and 11.97 million yuan in October. Disarmament totaled 11.795 million yuan, 19 customs duties totaled 11.16 million yuan, demobilization totaled 9.44 million yuan, and 19 years totaled 9.055 million yuan. The 6% reorganization totaled 288 million yuan, the 1996 public debt totaled 2.81 million yuan, and the customs treasury bills totaled 1.445 million yuan. However, the spot market was extremely deserted, with only 5,000 yuan traded on Friday, and no transactions at all on Monday through Thursday. As for the price fluctuations of various bonds during the past week, the bond prices all experienced extremely large rises and falls due to the dangerous diplomatic situation and the market's chaotic sentiment. For example, on Monday, as the Japanese soldiers continued to occupy various cities in southern Manchuria, looting, killing, and destroying all our infrastructure at will, the market was greatly shocked, and people were very nervous and unanimously tended to sell, like a surging tide. Various bonds could not withstand the pressure and fell sharply to halt trading as soon as they opened in the morning. Only the October futures of the 1996 and 1919 customs duties and good deeds did not halt trading. After trading was halted, the prices of various bonds fell in the after-hours market. There was a slight rebound on Tuesday, with large purchases made by financial institutions to maintain the market, and profit-taking and short covering were also quite active in the market. At the beginning of the week, the market was still firm, but as the Japanese army occupied Jilin and plundered Yanbian, the bond prices fell sharply and were difficult to reverse. On that day, more than a dozen types of bonds were halted due to continued declines. Moreover, as the settlement date approached, speculators and those unable to take delivery were all trying to get rid of their holdings. Therefore, the decline in this month's futures was particularly large, with a difference of about 3 yuan compared to the next month's futures, reversing the past situation where bond prices were higher in the near term and lower in the distant term. However, if bond prices were allowed to continue to fall without taking measures to maintain them, this would directly affect investors and indirectly affect the financial industry, which would be even more serious. The current settlement issue for September futures will not be easy to safely overcome. The exchange, in view of this situation, consulted with the financial industry and obtained the consent of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank to allow bond-backed loans and engage in purchases. At the same time, there was news that the diplomatic situation had taken a turn for the better, with the United States sending a note to Japan advising them to withdraw their troops. As a result, market sentiment improved greatly, and buying was very active, causing prices to rise rapidly. Upward halts reached ten types, with fluctuations of 7 or 8 yuan in a single day, and market sentiment was greatly stabilized. The market had greatly eased by Friday, and there were no major price fluctuations. The settlement in the coming week should not have any other problems. Although it is still difficult to predict the future of the market, the dangerous period has passed. It was found that the price fluctuations of each bond during the past week reached about 10 yuan, still a fall of 3 to 4 yuan compared to the previous week. The following is a statistical table of the high and low prices of bonds during the past week (in yuan):</p>

This illegal occupation of our Northeast is in fact the result of their long-standing plan, and is the prelude to their destruction of our country. Everyone must know that if the three eastern provinces are lost, the future disasters for our country will be a hundred or a thousand times greater than today. Therefore, at this critical moment, at this time of national survival, our 400 million people should uphold the great principle of being responsible for survival and rise up together with the determination to 'wear our hair and tie our crowns', rather be cannon fodder than be subjugated slaves, and decide to wage war on the battlefield and commercial war in the marketplace to protect our territory and avenge our country, and vow to wipe out this great shame."

<p>Assembly Declaration: This time, the Japanese imperialists, taking advantage of our country's time of natural disasters and bandit troubles, dared to defy the great injustice of the world, suddenly sent troops to the Northeast, forcibly occupied our country's territory, brutally murdered our officials and people, looted our property, burned our arsenal, occupied our armory, and destroyed our railways, blocking our transportation. When the bad news came, everyone was furious. All our people were filled with indignation and shared the same hatred for the enemy, vowing not to coexist under the same sky. More than eight hundred organizations and over two hundred thousand citizens in this city held a Citizens' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Assembly this morning, raising their arms and shouting, with ten thousand voices roaring, with grief and passion, which can be said to be unprecedented. Our countrymen are grieving over the country's current difficulties and lamenting the imminent destruction of the country. However, judging from the people's sentiments today, there is still hope, and the country's fate can be saved. If we act now, how can we fear the brutal Japan? Although the brutal Japan has not yet been punished by heaven, when our people unanimously reach the point of being unable to bear it, they will surely weep blood and sleep on their weapons, and fight a decisive battle with the brutal Japan, rather be shattered like jade than remain intact like tile. The 60 million people on the three islands can never be the enemy of our 400 million people. Life and death, survival and destruction, depend on how hard the people of our country struggle. Today's assembly resolutions are not only an essential plan to save the country from its current destruction, but also the entrustment of the ardent hopes of the people of the whole country. Fortune and misfortune, survival and destruction, depend on this one move. May our compatriots rise up and plan for it urgently. Our sincere words, we hope you will consider them carefully.</p>
<p>Crowd Parade: The parade route was predetermined by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. It started from the Public Sports Ground, went along Fangxie Road to Laoximen, then along Zhonghua Road through Xiaodongmen, then along Minguo Road, circled the city for a week, and dispersed at Laobeimen.

<p>Other Assembly News: After the adjournment at 12:45 PM this afternoon, over seven thousand people from six groups, including Jinan University, China Public School, Labor University, Cultural College, and the Eighth and Tenth Cotton Textile Industry Unions, were delayed because they were far away in Zhenru and Jiangwan and had inconvenient transportation. Seeing that the assembly had dispersed, they were very disappointed. At that time, the assembly chairmen Lu Jingshi, Hou Dachun, and Tao Baichuan were still at the venue taking care of the crowd, so Tao Baichuan, on behalf of the chairmen, reported on the proceedings and resolutions of the assembly. The crowd was very satisfied and shouted "Support the revolutionary resolutions!" The venue staff led them to pay their respects to the Party and National flags and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and shouted slogans such as "Down with Japanese imperialism" before leaving.</p>

<p>Telegraph urging Northeast generals to save the country with force</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday sent a telegram to the Northeast generals, saying: "To the commanding officers of the Northeast armies, as reported by newspapers nationwide: The Japanese imperialists, taking advantage of our country's multiple disasters and frequent calamities, dare to defy the great injustice of the world, disrupt world peace, send troops to the three eastern provinces, forcibly occupy our Liaoyang, brutally murder our compatriots, burn our armories, and detain our officials. They are wild and barbaric, and have no regard for our country. Recently, they have dispatched a large number of gunboats to blockade the seaports, probe key passes, invade from the south and attack from the north, attempting to annex China once and for all. The life and death of our Chinese nation is at stake. All our people should risk their lives for the final struggle. If we still adopt a policy of non-resistance and dream of prolonging our lives, not only will the pain of national subjugation be immediately apparent, but this servile nation will be forever recorded in world history and will be laughed at by Korea and India. Gentlemen, you command hundreds of thousands of troops in the Northeast. The state raises soldiers to defend the country and protect the people. At this time of foreign humiliation and national crisis, it is the time for soldiers to use their weapons. The people pay taxes and levies to support the soldiers, and this is the time to receive the reward. As soldiers, even if they are crushed to pieces, they will not hesitate to fulfill their duty as soldiers and meet the ardent expectations of the people. Not only that, soldiers are also citizens. If the country is destroyed, the people will be slaves, so how can soldiers be safe in their positions? Moreover, most of you are from the Northeast. As Japanese soldiers run rampant, the bones of your ancestors are exposed, your families are either raped or kidnapped, your property has been reduced to nothing, and your homes have been turned into ruins. If the Xiongnu are not destroyed, how can we have a home? Therefore, even if you do not consider the country and the people, but for the sake of your own ancestors, you should rectify your troops, die on the battlefield, be loyal to the country, be filial to your ancestors, sacrifice yourself for righteousness, and give up your life for justice. In this way, your names will be immortal for thousands of years. Our compatriots across the country have worked together and taken a unified step, ready to fight to the death. We hope that you will resolutely use force to deal with them and save the nation from danger. China is fortunate, and the Chinese nation is fortunate. Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee."</p>
<p>Letter requesting the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Inspection Bureau to issue a catalog of Japanese goods. The Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee yesterday sent a letter to the Industrial and Commercial Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, saying: "Regarding the fact that the brutal Japan is running rampant and we can no longer tolerate it, we have decided to sever economic relations with Japan and are actively implementing it. However, because there are so many types of Japanese goods sold in China, there are often omissions during inspection. We are afraid that shameless merchants will pass off inferior goods as good, or that inspection personnel will not be able to identify them, resulting in smuggling, which will have a huge impact on the anti-Japanese future. Therefore, we are specially writing to your bureau to quickly publish a catalog of Japanese goods and send several copies for reference and to facilitate inspection."</p>

With the hearts of jackals and wolves, how can this be tolerated! Compatriots, the survival of the nation is at stake, and the continuation of the race hangs by a thread. At this moment of military crisis, the only way for us to survive is for the whole country to unite sincerely and overcome national difficulties together.

Compatriots, we absolutely refuse to be slaves of a conquered nation, and we absolutely refuse to be ruled and oppressed by Japanese barbarians. Let us rise up together and fight the Japanese barbarians to the death.</p>

The original telegram is recorded below: "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Declaration": The Japanese army, relying on violence and taking advantage of our crisis, invaded the Northeast, repeatedly occupied famous cities, and acted like bandits, inhumane. They brazenly disregarded international conventions and are the leaders of the war, destroying peace. Our response to the arrival of adversity is to persevere and not give up, to overcome national difficulties together, to concentrate the strength of the nation, and to strive to be the government's backing. We especially hope that the national authorities will immediately cease internal strife, quickly decide on a plan, and unite to resist foreign enemies in order to save the country. Do not think that justice is enough to rely on and neglect legitimate defense measures. Do not be perfunctory and neglect the long-term plan of fostering the people and educating them. Learn from the past, turn death into life, restore lost territory, and wash away the shame. It is in this action. As the saying goes, adversity makes a country strong, and unity is strength. We are willing to work together with the government and the people to achieve this. This declaration is hereby made, and we hope you will consider it.

Seizing our borders, nibbling away at Manchuria and Mongolia, their premeditation has not been for a day. The slaughter and burning are even worse than in the past. The occupation of cities and the confiscation of property are all actions of violence. The essence of the Northeast is almost completely lost. What is recorded in the news already makes our ears unwilling to hear it, and personally being in this situation makes our eyes even more unwilling to see it. Where is international justice? The nation's danger can be feared. National difficulties have arrived, and every man has a responsibility. As long as there is breath left, this determination cannot be relaxed.

<p>Liaoning Refugees Arrive in Shanghai: Japanese troops suddenly forcibly occupied Liaoning on the 18th. On the 19th, Japanese troops went out to cause trouble in the city of Liaoning, forcibly entering shops and homes to rob and loot at will, and there were also cases of rape. The people of Liaoning fled in droves amidst the artillery fire. People from Zhili, Shandong and Henan all fled to Tianjin and Beijing, while people from the South fled south to Tianjin, and some fled to Dalian to come to Shanghai. Yesterday, the first batch of refugees arrived in Shanghai from Shenyang, having traveled by sea from Dalian to Shanghai, a total of one hundred and seventeen people. Because they were unable to carry their belongings when they escaped, most of them escaped with only the clothes on their backs. Therefore, they were in a very sorry state when they arrived in Shanghai. Among this batch of refugees were 51 men, including Zhou Hefu, Zhu Yunsheng, Chen Hanxian, Sun Jifang, and Lu Jianqing, and 66 women and children, all of whom lived in the city of Fengtian and Xiaonanguan. Among them, businessmen accounted for 70%, and the rest were teachers and other professions. According to a reporter speaking with a refugee, after the Japanese troops entered Shenyang, they fired guns and cannons indiscriminately at our soldiers and civilians. The number of people who died in the artillery fire was countless. The next day, they went out to arrest people. Those in Liaoning who had a slight reputation and advocated resistance against Japan were arrested and killed. Japanese soldiers freely entered people's homes and shops, searching for cash and violating women. The residents of the city were all in danger. The country has not yet been destroyed, but the people of Liaoning have suffered the slaughter of the violent Japanese. The residents of the Eastern Province have already experienced it, so they would rather abandon their property in Liaoning and flee with the clothes on their backs. When each person escaped from Liaoning, they were in great difficulty. Some of the people from the Southern provinces went to Tianjin and then to Shanghai, and some took the sea route from Dalian to Shanghai. When each person left Liaoning, they only brought a little money. Even if they had savings, they were in the bank, which was controlled by the Japanese, and they could not withdraw it. Therefore, they were in a very sorry state when they arrived in Shanghai, and they were in tears when they spoke. It was also said that the second batch of refugees from the Southern provinces would arrive in Shanghai soon. This time, the refugees who escaped were only a part of the people from the Southern provinces. The property they abandoned and lost amounted to millions, and the number of people who were brutally killed by the Japanese soldiers has not yet been ascertained. The Current Situation of Effective Resistance to Goods: Before the 18th of this time, although the anti-Japanese association strictly inspected, there were still some Japanese goods that were loaded privately, and goods from the East could not be completely stopped. Since the Japanese troops occupied Liaoning, the business circles in Shanghai have made major decisions to thoroughly reject Japanese goods. Since the 23rd, the Japanese Qing Yangtze River ships have not loaded any export goods, and the Japanese Post Office's Sino-Japanese liners have also not loaded any Chinese goods in recent days. The customs declaration agencies have agreed that all customs declaration personnel will not be allowed to go to Japanese shipping companies or other commercial banks from now on, so that trade between Japanese goods and the Chinese people can be fundamentally severed. In recent days, Japanese ships on all routes have been leaving empty. Recently, even the Yangtze River Japanese ships have no Chinese passengers.</p>

<p>Hoping to Uphold Justice and Provide Accurate Reports</p>
<p>Japan Cannot Evade Blame for the Manchurian Incident</p>
<p>Since Japan used force to seize our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, people from various countries have been paying close attention to the Manchurian issue. Foreign-run newspapers and news agencies have been competing to publish news reports, which have a significant impact on foreign readers. Recognizing this, the Shanghai Journalists Association held a reception for foreign correspondents at the Cathay Hotel at 4:00 PM yesterday, aiming to enable figures in the press of friendly nations to understand the various atrocities committed by the Japanese in suddenly and violently seizing our territory, violating international law, and contravening the Anti-War Pact, as well as the attitudes held by the Chinese populace. More than fifty reporters and guests from various Western newspapers and news agencies attended. Yan Duhe, Zhu Yingpeng, and Hang Shijun were elected as the presidium. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: The foreign newspaper and news agency reporters who attended were Remy, Kwongda (representing Agence France-Presse, Chinese National Magazine), Flandin (representing North-China Daily News), Isaacs (representing Shanghai Times), Prawdzic (representing Trans-Ocean News Agency), Miss Schmetzer (representing German newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung), Mairesse (representing French newspaper Le Journal de Shanghai), Snow (representing Millard's Review), Sweetland (representing Chicago Daily News), Meggyesy (representing United Press), Chancelor Cox (representing Reuters), Bob (representing Associated Press Association), Punhasda, and others. Other attendees included Zhang Zhuping, Dong Xian Guang, Wang Boqi, Wang Zhongwei, Nie Shifen, Mrs. Ma Jiashou, Yang Xiaotang, Xu Jianping, Wang Yingbin, Xie Fusheng, Wu Tingchen, Zhu Xinong, Sun Daosheng, Qian Hua, Zhou Fanping, Qian Bohan, Yu Kongwo, Jiang Jianhou, Jin Huating, Xu Chihen, Fan Jingwu, Tang Demin, and more than fifty others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: Chairman Yan Duhe delivered the opening address, which was translated into English by Wang Yingbin. The gist of his speech was to first state the purpose of the Shanghai Journalists Association's reception for foreign reporters. Amid feelings of gratitude, there was a sense of sorrow and indignation. Because Japan's military occupation of Liaoning and Jilin provinces was an unprecedented act of barbarism in the international community, the loss of life and property suffered by the Chinese people was incalculable, and the atrocities continue unabated. Secondly, he stated that although the Chinese government and people are extremely indignant at Japan's violence against China, they are mostly maintaining calm and patience, knowing that force will ultimately be defeated by justice and that international conventions will have the effect of curbing violence. The League of Nations and the United States have both issued telegrams to stop Japan's atrocities, and China is very grateful for these actions upholding justice. At this point, Yan called attention to how Japan has been confusing the public and distorting right and wrong. He said that Japan's actions, which disregard justice and violate conventions, are by no means just an issue confined to parts of Liaoning and Jilin, but a significant issue affecting world peace. Finally, Yan forcefully stated that in addition to relying on its military violence, Japan is also using deceptive tactics to vigorously promote its false propaganda, hoping that the gentlemen of the press from friendly nations present would uphold justice and provide accurate reports, so that people of friendly nations can learn about China's true attitude and expose Japan's cunning and deceitful methods of fabrication.</p>
<p>Dong's Speech: Dong's speech mainly stated that today, the Shanghai Journalists Association is hosting this event for the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, and he had been invited to attend and offer his humble opinions. Regarding the various circumstances of the Manchurian issue, he had repeatedly written about them in the Continental Times, so there was no need to repeat them. Now, he would offer a few observations as follows: The Shanghai Journalists Association, composed of reporters from various Chinese-language daily newspapers in Shanghai, has considerable influence. Today's gathering with everyone is to express the association's views to everyone present. At this point, Dong recounted the origins of the Incident in the Three Northeastern Provinces and the seriousness of the situation, and then said that the pen of a journalist should fight for justice, and he believed that fellow journalists around the world would also express their fair opinions. Dong continued that the current Japanese atrocities in Liaodong are not just a local dispute between China and Japan, but an obstacle to world peace, and he hoped that everyone present would pay attention to this point. Dong also elaborated on how the Manchurian issue could affect the world situation, moving everyone who listened, and said that he could not help but feel disappointed upon hearing the news that the League of Nations was not involved in this matter, but still could not say that there was no hope, because if others cannot help us, we must help ourselves. Manchuria is an important territory of China, rich in resources, and sufficient to solve China's problem of overpopulation. As for the Japanese, they also want to seize South Manchuria due to their own domestic overpopulation, but the result will not only fail to solve the difficulties of the population problem, but will instead cause disputes and endanger the world situation. What will be the ultimate gains and losses? Finally, Dong said that the purpose of today's tea party is to request the foreign reporters present to adopt a fair attitude and announce the truth of the Manchurian issue to people in Europe and America, so that the rights and wrongs of this matter can receive a fair judgment, saying, "The pen is mightier than the sword," and hoped that colleagues around the world would not be subdued by military force, as the League of Nations' attitude is today.</p>
<p>Zhou's Speech: Zhou Fanping, a reporter from the North-China Daily News, said in his speech that he was not speaking in the capacity of a journalist, nor was he giving a propaganda-style speech, but only expressing his personal opinion from the standpoint of the Chinese people. Today, China is in a difficult situation, and what can save it is only the spirit of the new China. What Chinese history shows us is only that we have been invaded by others and have never inflicted violence on others. This is not cowardice, but because China has always been known to the world for its peace and patience. The Manchurian Incident is something that no one can tolerate. At present, China does not seek the favor of others, but only justice. He earnestly hoped that the foreign reporters present would use fair eyes to judge this incident.</p>
<p>Speeches by Foreign Guests: Foreign reporters and guests who spoke included Remy, Meggyesy, and Nie Ganfen. Remy was the first to stand up and address the audience when the chairman asked the Western reporters to express their views. He said that he had been engaged in journalism in China for more than fifty years and was quite familiar with the situation in China. He expressed his sympathy for the attitude of the Chinese government and Chinese reporters. Meggyesy then stood up and said that he could represent the foreign reporters in offering a word, that Japan cannot evade blame for the Manchurian Incident, and that justice will surely prevail in the future. Meggyesy also made an analogy, which drew applause from the audience. Finally, Nie Shifen, the director of the Journalism Department of Yenching University, gave a speech in which he highly praised China's current non-resistance and calm attitude, and said that the Chinese should not deal with the Japanese with military actions. If the Chinese can continue this attitude for six months, there would be a significant impact on its economy and commerce. Xie Fusheng gave the closing remarks, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Request the Dispatch of Personnel to Supervise Relief Distribution</p>
<p>Xu Shiying and Zhu Ziqiao submitted a request to the National Government through the Urgent Relief Committee, requesting that supervisory committee members be dispatched to various disaster-stricken provinces to earnestly investigate relief distribution personnel. They stated that the extent of the disaster areas, the severity of the disaster situation, and the number of disaster victims in the various provinces this year were unprecedented in a century. The government is deeply concerned and has allocated funds for relief. Qinglan has been entrusted with the task of disaster relief work, and he bears a heavy responsibility. He will do his best to act with conscience and integrity and has hired relief commissioners to various provinces, all of whom he trusts. However, the personnel dispatched by the commissioners to investigate and distribute relief funds, distribute relief goods, and those used in future labor relief and agricultural relief projects are numerous. Qinglan's ears and eyes are limited, and the relief funds are of utmost importance, even the smallest amount. If there is any negligence, it would not only be a matter of conscience but also be intolerable to public opinion. Thinking of this, he feels apprehensive. Furthermore, Xu Shiying previously received two million yuan in salt tax treasury bonds allocated by the Central Government, which were mortgaged for one million yuan in cash. The Executive Yuan ordered the various members of the Relief Committee to carry the funds to Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces for urgent relief. This matter is also of great importance and should be subject to strict investigation. Qinglan and Shiying propose that the committee submit a request to the National Government to order the Supervisory Yuan to dispatch supervisory committee members to various disaster-stricken provinces to conduct thorough investigations into all aspects of urgent relief, labor relief, and agricultural relief. Any embezzlement or misappropriation of relief funds, as well as fraudulent relief distribution, collusion with local authorities to fraudulently claim relief, and other fraudulent activities related to relief work, should be severely punished according to the law upon verification. However, those who undertake relief work with integrity and have made significant contributions should also be rewarded by the government to encourage others.</p>

<p>The Hubei Water Disaster Urgent Relief Committee's office in Shanghai received a telegram yesterday from Chairman He Chengjun of the Wuhan branch, which stated, "The emergency epidemic prevention oil previously transported here has been very effective, especially for children suffering from epidemics, who recover after taking it once.

We urgently request that you raise funds to purchase 200,000 bottles, no matter what, and expedite the process to transport them to Hubei as soon as possible to save the disaster victims." It is reported that after receiving the telegram, the office is currently negotiating with the pharmacist Mr. Fu Nianci to work day and night to expedite production, aiming to transport it to Wuhan within two weeks. The severity of the disaster in Hubei Province this year is truly unprecedented. The number of bottles of medicine for treating epidemics alone has been distributed to hundreds of thousands, which is still not enough, which shows the severity of the epidemic.</p>

<p>Six Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>Since Japan forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces, various circles of Korean residents in Shanghai have repeatedly expressed their deep sorrow. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Korean residents held another general meeting on Minguo Road. More than 300 people attended, and the slogans were filled with denunciations of Japan and encouragement to the Chinese. The meeting was opened with the patriotic song by the head of the Civil Corps, Jin Jichang, who explained the purpose of the meeting. Then, Li Dongning was elected as chairman to conduct the proceedings. Zhao Suang reported on the detailed causes and consequences of the violent Japanese occupation of the Eastern Provinces. Then, Che Lixi, An Changhao, Zhao Wanjiu, Park Changse, Choi Hyungrok, the Chinese reporter Mr. Chen, and other men and women gave enthusiastic and indignant speeches. The resolutions were then passed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The attendees all showed a tense and indignant attitude. The resolutions are as follows: "Regarding this serious situation, the entire Korean residents in Shanghai will encourage independence activists at home and abroad and the general public to rise up in unison. They must recognize that unless the Japanese who are carrying out robbery in the Northeast are expelled, there is no way to defend the basic territories of Korea and China and to achieve the great task of liberating East Asia. In order to promote the common struggle between the Korean and Chinese peoples, the following resolutions are made: (1) Declare to Japan, which is invading China's Eastern Provinces, and (2) fellow compatriots at home and abroad, and concretely realize the united front of the Korean and Chinese peoples; (2) Announce to the world the historical robbery committed by Japan against Korea and China; (3) Enable the two million overseas Chinese residing in the Eastern Provinces to share the same fate and step in unison with the Chinese people; (4) Sweep away those who are willing to serve as tools of the enemy's occupying forces; (5) Strive for China to take military action against Japan as soon as possible; (6) For the common struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples to restore their territories and regain their sovereignty, we must urgently organize an allied army."</p>

<h3 id="e117">Record of the Third Annual Meeting of the Child Welfare Association <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Starting with Children's Education</p>
<p>Washing Away China's Humiliation</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association held its third annual meeting yesterday at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. More than 20 people attended, including Chairman Kong Xiangxi, Vice-Chairman Luo Yunyan, Mrs. Guo Bingwen, Hu Yigu, Zhang Zhijiang (represented by Weng Guoxun), Zheng Hongnian (represented by Tang Tonghou), Wang Xiaozai, and Zhu Shaoping. Chairman Kong Yongzhi gave a speech, saying that the Child Welfare Association was holding its third annual meeting amidst the solemn and enthusiastic anti-Japanese movement, and that he felt that this had a very profound meaning worth pondering carefully. He said that this time Japan had inflicted great insult on China, but China could not directly stop it and implement normal defense, but had to beg for pity from the League of Nations and other countries, which was heartbreaking. He recalled that in the early 19th century, Prussia was often ravaged by France, so the people of the country prepared for revenge. Iron Chancellor Bismarck first educated the people and rectified primary school education in the country. Sure enough, in the battle of Shi Dan in 1870, the French Emperor Napoleon III was captured and a great victory was won, washing away the humiliation of the past. He felt that this matter could be used as a reference for us. If we want to save the country from the root and wash away today's humiliation, we must start with children's education. However, it is shameful to say that Chinese children do not receive adequate education, nor do they receive adequate care. Since care cannot even be talked about, how can we talk about education? Just look at the countless children who died in this water disaster. Others, in ordinary times, are poorly clothed and fed, beg on the streets, and suffer from diseases due to lack of hygiene. What can we do to remedy this? Children are the future masters of the country. Now that the future masters of our country are not adequately cared for and educated, how can our country become strong? Since it cannot become strong, how can it wash away national humiliation? The Child Welfare Association is a Chinese people's organization whose greatest purpose is to seek happiness for Chinese children, in other words, to cultivate China's vitality and lay the foundation for China. From now on, we hope that it can awaken the awareness of the people of the country, first solve the basic problem of providing for children, and then solve the problem of educating children, not only enabling children throughout the country to receive adequate care, but also enabling them to receive adequate education. Then, the strength of our China will only be a matter of time, and all national humiliations can be washed away. Next, the officials were elected: Chairman Kong Yongzhi, Chief Vice-Chairman Luo Yunyan, Second Vice-Chairman Mrs. Liu Zhanen, Accountant Gao Fengchi, Deputy Accountant Li Daonan, Secretary Chen Heqin. The following were elected to the committee: Fu Kuangzhuo, Mrs. Fu Bulaun, Hu Yigu, Mrs. Guo Bingwen, Niu Huisheng, Le Lingsheng, Ms. Ding Juejing, Hu Xuanming, Fei Meisheng, Pan Gongzhan, Hai Muhua, Lai Sili, Jiang Changchuan. Temporary motions: (1) Send a telegram to all compatriots, asking them to be determined to die for the country (motion drafted by Chen Zhengfan), (2) Send a telegram to the National Government, asking it to implement proper defense, (3) Send a telegram to the Japanese Women's Association, asking it to urge its government to reflect, and to the American Child Welfare Association, asking it to uphold justice. Another telegram was sent nationwide, stating, "All compatriots across the country, as transferred by the Shanghai newspapers, are hereby informed that this time the violent Japanese invaded our borders and massacred our people, and the most brutal thing is that innocent children were also harmed. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? If we do not resist this, how can we establish a nation? At this time of great difficulty, all of our people should be determined to die for the country, our government leaders should work together in harmony, and our country's future children's education should pay more attention to cultivating national strength in order to lay the foundation for the country and resist foreign aggression. Urgent words, hoping for joint efforts. The China Child Welfare Association Third Annual Meeting Koutou."</p>

<h3 id="e119">Explanation of the Reason for Inspecting Tea Leaves <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from business representatives of foreign tea firms to the Ministry of Industry states: "To Zheng Ziyu and others, representatives of foreign tea firms from Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. We have received your telegrams. Tea has always been a special product of our country, sold worldwide. Tea from Japan, India, Ceylon, and other places emerged later, but they have been able to research and improve, and European and American markets have been seized. Chinese tea adheres to old ways, and is often adulterated with coloring, leading to a daily decline in sales. In the first year of the Republic of China, exports were more than 1.4 million dan. Since then, they have declined year by year, even to more than 400,000 dan. Although the years 1928 and 1929 saw an increase to more than 900,000 dan, the latest customs records show that exports in 1930 fell again to just over 690,000 dan. In recent years, Chinese tea has relied on Russia as a market of last resort, while Japanese green tea sales to Russia have increased year by year since 1926, exceeding Chinese tea exports last year. Chinese tea is failing step by step. If we do not catch up quickly, what will the future hold? The government is conducting inspections to increase the international trade reputation, promote improvements in tea production, and issued instructions to the Construction Departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces in April of this year to urge tea merchants in tea-producing counties and cities to improve manufacturing and refrain from coloring and adulteration, in order to save the industry. Your telegrams state that tea merchants are striving to improve the quality of their products, and that the people's efforts reflect the government's concerns. Have there been any improvements in fact? Colored tea has been rejected by the American market. Although a portion of the population in other countries still needs it due to habit and is temporarily allowed for export, the actual fact is that using Berlin Blue and similar pigments for coloring, when ingested, will produce highly toxic hydrocyanic acid gas upon encountering acidic stomach fluids, causing severe damage to health. Inspection at the place of origin is essential, and the Ministry is planning this carefully. However, export inspection is international in nature. In order to prevent fraud by Chinese and foreign tea merchants during the process, it cannot be abolished. Article 2 of the Tea Inspection Regulations stipulates that applications for inspection should be made to the local commodity inspection bureau or its branches, referring to the inspection bureaus or their branches in tea export ports. The telegrams’ reference to inspection at the place of origin is a misunderstanding. As for the representatives' concern about whether the inspectors' judgments are fair and impartial, if such a situation exists, tea merchants can request re-inspection according to the regulations or make a practical report. How can speculative matters be used as reasons for opposition? Furthermore, the telegrams state that foreign merchants are watching and prices are falling sharply upon hearing of the crackdown. Although tea prices fluctuated in mid-July, this was a temporary market phenomenon. How can this be used as an excuse for inspection? Since July 23, sales have been brisk. In early August, the tea market was even more prosperous. High-quality green teas such as Zhen Mei were exceptionally strong, rising to more than ten taels. All newspapers can verify this. What is the explanation? It should be known that the government has shown great care in exempting tea from export taxes, but this still cannot reverse the decline. The key lies in the poor quality of tea production. It is conceivable that inspecting tea is a policy already set by the government. Japan, Taiwan, Java, Ceylon, and other places have precedents. The main purpose is to directly stop the coloring and adulteration of tea, and indirectly promote the improvement and manufacturing of tea, in order to strengthen consumers' faith and compete in the international market. The representatives do not understand the trend of overseas trade in recent years, and their telegrams opposing and obstructing the overall plan are inappropriate. The request to stop the inspection is difficult to approve. If the representatives believe that there is room for improvement in the inspection procedures, they can submit their opinions for consideration." Ministry of Industry, Seal.</p>

At around 9:00 AM, Judge Cheng Shangfeng took his seat and asked Lu and the others if they had any last words. He also notified their families. According to Wu Shenxian, the main culprit was actually Liang Chengyu. He had been told not to incriminate him during the previous interrogation. He now asked the court to allow his father, Wu Zhangzhang, to take custody of all his tools and equipment, as well as his wife's jewelry, rings, and other items, at Liang Dongsheng's fruit store on the second floor of the 16th Pier. He also requested that his father collect his body. Wang Songlin requested that the court send a letter to Wang Shuji at No. 12 Huayuan Lane, North Zhejiang Road, to be forwarded to his family in Pudong, informing them that the execution had been carried out and that he had nothing else to say. Lu A'gen stated that Liang Chengyu was the main culprit in the kidnapping of both Chen and Li. Previously, during the appeal period, he offered them 10,000 yuan for their future expenses, but they refused because they were about to be executed and had no use for the money. He also requested that a message be sent to his father at No. 12 Leyu Lane, Wuzhen Road, asking him to collect his body. All three defendants smiled calmly and showed no fear of death. Judge Cheng ordered the Chinese and foreign police to take them away and escort them onto a car, along with the case files and photographs, and drive them to the Caohejing Second Prison execution ground. The Local Court appointed Prosecutor Shen Taoming as the execution officer. He then ordered Police Chief Xu Jinqing and Police Inspector Chen Xihui to supervise the executioners, Gu Hanqing, Yin Daoxu, Xu Guoguang, Lu Conghe, Zhou Qiwen, Zhu Wanyuan, Xiong Dingcheng, Liu Fu, and Zhao Mingyuan, who traveled in cars to the execution ground. After the judge and Warden Dong Changmin took their seats, the three prisoners were brought in for questioning. After the questioning, all three loudly requested immediate execution and asked for a clean job. The judge ordered the executioners to take them away and execute them by firing squad. The bodies were inspected by Inspector Shen. He then ordered the hall to collect and seal the bodies for burial.</p>

<p>The North China Times reports that the Public Concession police have arrested five Russians in the past 24 hours. After seizing three handguns, some bullets, and criminal documents, they uncovered a major plot to kidnap the wealthy Jewish businessman, Sofa. It is reported that the police had heard about the plot earlier and assigned two Russian detectives to investigate. After more than two months of investigation, they finally tracked down a Russian man in the French Concession on Thursday night and arrested him. Four hours later, they arrested another Russian youth in the French Concession. Subsequently, they searched the youth's residence and found several criminal documents clearly stating the plan to kidnap Sofa. The next morning, they escorted the two men to the Special District Court. After questioning, they were detained pending further investigation. A few hours before the two men were brought to the court, three more people were arrested in the French Concession. One of them confessed to having rented a hideout for the kidnap victims. When they searched the place, it was empty. They found only two handguns, two dozen bullets, and two hemp ropes with blackened paper pasted on the inside of the glasses. Two hours later, they found another handgun and some bullets at another location in the French Concession. It is reported that they had planned to kidnap Sofa last Sunday, but the plan was aborted for some reason.</p>

<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association recently received official letters from the Haikou Chamber of Commerce and the Qiongshan County Magistrate on Hainan Island, Guangdong, requesting the association to subsidize the construction of the Qiongya Leprosy Hospital. A meeting of the executive directors was convened yesterday, attended by Madam Xiao Zhiji, Li Yuanxin, Li Guansen, Zhu Shaoping, Wu Zhijian, and others. First, Mr. Shi Dingye, representative of the Qiongan Leprosy Hospital Preparatory Committee, reported, "There are about 500 lepers on Hainan Island. The local government has always ignored them and has no thorough relief measures, which has a profound impact on the nation's health. Concerned individuals have organized the Qiongya Leprosy Hospital Preparatory Committee. They have already raised 5,000 yuan. The county government plans to allocate more than 30 mu of barren government land as a base. There are also bricks and stones from the demolition of the old city that can be allocated as building materials. However, according to the budget, the funds are still huge. We hope that your association can provide assistance." It was decided to provide a subsidy of 5,000 yuan so that it can be completed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In recent days, sea bandits outside the port of Wusong have been gathering more and more, looting everywhere. It was learned from the fourth district of the Wusong Water Police that the bandits were gathered at Daan Port, the border between Tongzhou and Haimen counties, with hundreds of people fully armed. They were all on sailing ships and in shallow waters, making it difficult to suppress them. It is now known that District Chief Jiang personally set off on the Junhe cruiser yesterday morning to supervise the teams, surround, and suppress the bandits. He ordered Team Leader Gong Mianqin of the 17th Team to lead the Pingyang Zhenyu, two warships, and patrol boats from Hupu. The Jinghai and Jingdong warships set off from Haimen. He also ordered Team Leader Xie Zezhi of the 18th Team to lead his team on a warship from Xiaoyang Port in Nantong. The 16th Team remained in Hupu to block the bandits. He also sent a telegram to the Haimen County Police to intercept the bandits along the coast in the ports of Niuhong, Daan, and Laohong. He also ordered all fleets to meet at Songji Port at 5:00 PM this afternoon to receive orders for the second phase of the search plan in order to thoroughly eliminate the bandits.</p>

<p>The car owner found out and reported it to the police</p>
<p>Waiting for the owner to come and claim it</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller Hu Rongfa drove his rickshaw to Moore Road the other day. A woman hired him to go to the train station and left a yellow wallet on the car when she got off. Hu brought it back and opened it. There were 130 yuan in banknotes inside. Hu was overjoyed at this windfall and told everyone about it. His colleagues Ma Rongde, Xu Chunhe, Chen Chunyu, and Zhou Fengbao found out about it and asked him to share the money. Rickshaw owner Xue Zhengfa found out about it. According to the police regulations, the car owner is responsible for any items lost by passengers in the car, so he secretly reported it to the police. The police arrested Hu Rongfa and the four people who intended to share the money and detained them in the police station. Yesterday, they were taken to the criminal court of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Chen Ming explained the case, stating that the first defendant had committed the crime of misappropriating lost property under Article 358 of the Criminal Law and requested that he be prosecuted. Then, car owner Xue Zhengfa reported the previous situation. Hu Rongfa confessed that the wallet was left on the car by a woman who was in a hurry to catch the train and that he did not steal it intentionally. Ma and the other four confessed that they had borrowed money from Hu and did not dare to share it. The judge ordered Hu Rongfa to be remanded in custody and to wait for the owner to come to court for further questioning. Ma and the other four were released on bail pending further investigation.</p>

<p>On the pretext of introducing her as a maid</p>
<p>Intending to sell her into prostitution</p>
<p>Qin Li, a young woman from Xiangshan, Ningbo, is 26 years old. Because her family was poor, she worked as a maid in Ningbo City and earned only three yuan a month. An old woman, Zhang Feng, persuaded her to go to Shanghai to work as a maid, saying that she could earn six yuan a month. Since the young woman had no one to introduce her, the old woman took advantage of her weakness and desire for money, pretended to be benevolent, and offered to introduce her. She brought the young woman to Shanghai and took her to her daughter's house in Cangqiao Head, Xiaonanmen. A few days ago, she went to the Meifeng brothel to sell her, saying that she had a daughter-in-law who was willing to become a prostitute. The brothel sent someone to the old woman's house to see the young woman and asked her about her background and told her about the prostitution. The young woman cried and hit her head against the pillar. The people in the brothel fled. At that time, a patrol officer arrived and asked about the situation. The old woman was detained in the first district and the first office. Yesterday, she was transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Waiting to see the prescription for further verification</p>
<p>A three-month-old baby, A'niu, son of Tang Heshang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 919 Dongyouheng Road, was sleeping on a small wooden bed on the afternoon of the 14th of this month at about 1:00 PM. It was unexpected that Zhang A'qing and his wife, Kong, also Ningbo natives living in the same residence, had a quarrel and fought each other. As Mrs. Zhang fell, she accidentally knocked over the wooden bed, and A'niu fell to the ground, was injured, and became ill. He died on the afternoon of the 24th at 6:00 PM. The body was sent to the Fei Lun Road Morgue. Prosecutor Guo of the First Special Court went to the morgue and determined that the child died from a fall. Therefore, the child's father sued the Huishan Police Station, which sent Detective Huang Fugen to arrest Zhang A'qing and his wife, Zhang Kong, and detain them separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case. Then, the plaintiff, Tang Heshang, reported the situation and said that the child, A'niu, had stopped eating milk after being knocked down by the defendants and that seeing a doctor had been ineffective. However, the prescription had not been brought today. A neighbor surnamed Wang witnessed the incident. When asked, the two defendants denied knocking over A'niu's bed during the fight, claiming that the child died of illness. After reviewing the confession, Judge Shen Bingrong ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody separately and to be summoned for further questioning at a later date. He also ordered Tang Heshang to bring the prescription to the next hearing.</p>

<p>Xiao Zhiming, a 21-year-old Suzhou native who claimed to be a southern goods merchant, checked into room number six of the Wankang Inn, a small inn opened by Wu Wanli, a Ningbo native, at No. 115 Lixian Lane, Dongzilaishui Street, French Concession, on the evening of the 20th of this month. For some unknown reason, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts and swallowed raw opium. After the waiter found out, he was immediately sent to Renji Hospital. However, he was deeply poisoned and died at 6:00 AM yesterday despite the rescue efforts. The hospital reported the death to the police, who carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch of the morgue. It was impossible to investigate the deceased's family. The report was made by Prosecutor Lou Guanguang of the Second Special Court, who determined that the deceased had committed suicide by taking poison and ordered that the body be collected by Tongren Fuyuan Hall. After the inspection, the police took a photo of the body. Later, the hall prepared a coffin and transported it to the Pudong cemetery for burial, waiting for relatives to claim it.</p>

<p>800 Yuan Alimony</p>
<p>Huang Xiuming hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Civil Mediation Court of the Second Special Court, stating that the petitioner had previously married Yan Hansan, who lived on Laoshifu Road. After the marriage, she was often abused, and her husband was addicted to opium, requiring the petitioner to serve him all night. If she did not comply, she would be humiliated. Therefore, the petitioner requested mediation because she felt that there was no happiness in her future. She requested that the divorce be granted and that she be awarded 3,000 yuan in alimony. Yesterday, both parties were summoned to court for mediation. First, the petitioner recounted the previous situation. The defendant did not appear, but his lawyer represented him, stating that the petitioner's claims were inconsistent with the facts. The petitioner was only a concubine and was treated very well after the marriage and there was no abuse. However, because they were a modest family, there was frugality. The defendant was an accountant at the Nanshi Water Plant and earned more than 30 yuan a month. The defendant did not object to the petitioner's request for a divorce, but the amount of alimony requested by the petitioner was too large and could be reduced to 200 or 300 yuan. The petitioner's lawyer stated that it would take at least 1,500 yuan to reach a settlement. After repeated persuasion by the judge, the two parties compromised on 800 yuan. Both parties agreed, and each of their lawyers signed the record. The mediation was then declared successful.</p>

Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 PM, the two ships were outside the China Merchants Bureau pier when the Haiping ship turned around, creating waves. The two ships were unable to avoid them and were wrecked. Everyone on board went into the water. Fortunately, the water patrol team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led by police chief Fu Jixiang, was patrolling the river and saw the situation. They immediately tried to rescue them and rescued several people who had fallen into the water. However, all the goods on the two ships have sunk to the bottom of the river, resulting in considerable losses.</p>

<p>Giving away Guohuo Sheng Dan at the venue</p>
<p>This city's Xie Xing Pharmaceutical Factory is one of our country's leading pharmaceutical industries, issuing Bailinji, Bu Lida, Jiufu Milk White Cod Liver Oil, etc., all of which have won deep social welcome with the latest scientific preparations. Its seasonal health products Sheng Dan is a kind of acupuncture industry that competes with Japanese Rendan, with low prices and even exceeding its efficacy, which is enough to be a representative product for resisting Japanese medicines. At this time when the people all know how to promote Guohuo, sales are extremely smooth, and since the violent Japanese invasion of the Northeast, the boycott of Japanese goods has intensified, and seasonal health products, especially Sheng Dan, are in demand. Therefore, the factory is working hard to speed up production in order to do its best in the anti-Japanese and national salvation work. Yesterday, the entire staff of the anti-Japanese and national salvation citizens' assembly at the Public Sports Ground in this city, from managers to factory directors, participated unanimously. Each held slogan flags, with black cloths wrapped around their arms, showing great enthusiasm, and prepared a number of Sheng Dan samples, which were distributed on the spot, so that the patriotic people who participated in the meeting could taste this Guohuo Sheng Dan. It is said that Sheng Dan can be obtained to give birth, and the country's vitality, or the great omen in this tone seems humorous, but according to the duties of the industrial and commercial circles, it is possible to do their best to create alternative products to introduce to the Chinese people, leak the crevices as much as possible, and restore the rights and interests, and it is also almost a way to save the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Youze asked (please open a national salvation column to discuss the method of boycotting Japanese goods)</p>
<p>I dare to ask for two things, (1) Please temporarily add a national salvation item in the reader's communication column of your newspaper to open up speech, because the gains and losses of Chucao and the heroes in the wild are not lacking, hoping that your newspaper will lead and extend it, then this move will benefit a lot, this is for the sake of national disaster and crisis, urgently seeking to save, your newspaper should agree, yesterday (September 23) in the column, Mr. Shen Gengyao's Q&amp;A has set a precedent, why not officially open up an item more thoroughly, (2) the national disaster is approaching, the whole country is shouting, there must be a practical move to take effect, now the unified national urgent and effective, nothing more than boycotting Japanese goods, this is known to everyone, but there is no urgent and effective good policy, although anti-Japanese is practiced every day, it still cannot control Japan's death, I think it is appropriate to implement the method of sealing up Japanese goods, by the district party department to send people to households, the Japanese goods owned by the stores, the government stamped and sealed, not to be started, its goods are still stored in each store, pending later decisions, everyone has no Japanese goods to buy, otherwise the seller will privately transport and sell for their own interests, the buyer has no choice because of the difficult method, the above two points, please answer in your newspaper's communication column,</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) This column's communication was originally limited to the three items of study, career, and marriage. In view of the urgent national affairs, all issues related to anti-Japanese national salvation, please express your opinions and discuss them publicly. All the discussions in the past few days have been about this issue. It's almost a special column. (2) Sealing up Japanese goods is also a method, disclosing your ideas for the authorities to refer to,</p>
<p>Mr. Li Mincui asked (which is more important, saving the country or filial piety)</p>
<p>In this critical period of national survival, as citizens, of course, everyone should unite and think about countermeasures. Recently, the Anti-Japanese Association organized a volunteer group, which is also a powerful countermeasure. I am a shop assistant in a small country. I have some understanding of the idea of saving the country, so I want to join the group and serve the country. However, when I think about the family relationship, I cannot give it up, because I have no father since I was a child, and I only rely on my loving mother to endure all kinds of hardships to raise me up. Now her hope is to see me have a good family and career, and want to have a grandson. If I now, because of the impulse of patriotism, turn my back on my family and join the army, then I will definitely resent and cry bitterly. Now it is the time of my old age, or there may be unexpected events, then my national salvation ambition has not succeeded, and the crime of unfilial piety has been spread to the local party, so I want to ask you gentlemen to think of an appropriate way to solve this important matter,</p>
<p>(Cause) Your one thought of loving the country and one thought of not forgetting filial piety is respectable. At this time, because of Japan's atrocities, volunteer groups are organized everywhere, the purpose is to exercise the body, do military exercises, and establish the foundation of national self-improvement, and it is not to go to ambushes immediately. It is too far away from fighting. Since you have this good intention, you should tell your mother earnestly and clearly how unreasonable the Japanese are this time, how terrible the future of China is, what the national obligations should be, and how if we do not join forces to save ourselves, we will all perish. I think my mother will not object. Also tell my mother about the purpose of organizing the volunteer group, and at this time I can't talk about the situation of fighting, my mother will naturally be more at ease. Didn't you see in the third edition of this newspaper yesterday that the Zhejiang Provincial Government's military training of the old and the weak are all being trained?</p>
<h3 id="e137">News from a Man of Wufeng Mountain <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>(Deliberations on the People's Food Problem, Production Problem, and Commercial Studies Books in Wuyuan)</p>
<p>My Wuyuan has many mountains and little land. Besides growing tea and trees, the people have no other means of livelihood. Therefore, most of them do business abroad. In recent years, there have been natural and man-made disasters, and the commercial situation is sluggish. Many businessmen are uneasy in their businesses. Moreover, the hometown is often disturbed by Jiangxi bandits. Rice is as expensive as pearls, and firewood is as expensive as cassia. Most of the grain relies on relief from Jiangxi. In recent years, the communists in that province have been rampant, and local gentry have prohibited the transportation of rice out of the province, leaving the people of Wuyuan waiting to die. Please instruct me on the following: 1. Since Wuyuan has little land, what kind of practical industries should the people engage in to make a living? Please instruct me on the following: 2. Because I am troubled by economic difficulties, I cannot enter a commercial school. What kind of books should I study on my own to learn about commerce? Please instruct me on the following: 3. Please answer the above three questions in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) 1. Most of the food for the people of Wuyuan is transported from Xiuning, Jiangxi, and other places for relief. Now, due to the rampancy of the communists in Jiangxi, the people are fleeing, the rice production has decreased, and exports are prohibited. Xiuning is also unable to help due to this year's poor harvest. Natural and man-made disasters have followed one after another, causing great difficulties. The food problem of the people of Wuyuan is indeed a very important and difficult problem. Concrete solutions are difficult to answer in a hurry.</p>
<p>2. Since Wuyuan has little land, the people's production can only start from the family. Such as raising chickens, raising pigs, spinning yarn, weaving cloth, and sewing, etc., are all easy to do. In addition to the original experience of raising chickens and pigs, it is best to add new methods and improve and study them. This would be even better. (The Commercial Press has published the latest "Pig Raising Method," and the Jiangwan Chinese Chicken Farm has published the "Chinese Chicken Raising Technique," both of which can be consulted.)</p>
<p>3. Since you are studying in a shop and want to study commerce in your spare time, this is a very good idea. The Commercial Press has published "Retail Studies," which costs 50 cents. You can buy one to read first. It is best to be attentive in your service, apply what you have learned from books to practice, and accumulate experience over time. You can gain a wealth of experience. What do you think?</p>
<h3 id="e138">News from Mr. Tao (Several Questions about the Volunteer Corps) <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Today, I went to the entrance of the Municipal Party Department next to the Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge and saw a poster for the Volunteer Corps. This inevitably aroused my enthusiasm because we feel that the tyrannical Japanese invaders have actually put down their masks and treated the Chinese people like cattle and horses. If we do not rise up to save the country, I am afraid that the day of becoming slaves to a conquered nation is not far away. Because I felt this situation, I was very determined to go inside the Municipal Party Department to join the Volunteer Corps. However, there were many people signing up inside. I don't know if there are any other functions, whether the organization is legitimate, or whether there is any relationship with our merchants joining. What are the purposes of the Volunteer Corps and what are their plans? I had these questions at the time, so I did not fill out the registration form and would like to ask the reporter to provide detailed instructions in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) The nature of the Volunteer Corps is nothing more than to train the body, engage in military-style drills, promote the national spirit of patriotism, and prepare for resisting Japan and saving the country. As far as we know, there are no other functions. Merchants, of course, are hoped to join together to show the united struggle of the people.</p>

<p>To resist Japan and save the country, everyone should work hard from their own position. This is really the most important and most effective thing. Then our press should do two things:</p>
<p>(1) All newspapers and news agencies should immediately join forces to organize an international telecommunications organization to send newly obtained information quickly to the outside world.</p>
<p>(2) The entertainment supplements of each newspaper should be immediately suspended and used to publish the opinions and suggestions of all sectors on resisting Japan and saving the country.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your insights are very pertinent. International propaganda is a necessary task for establishing a country today. Moreover, at this critical moment of survival, an international telecommunications organization is already being organized. With this urgent request, it may be hoped that it will be established as soon as possible. As for the various sectors of this newspaper, they will collect and publish facts and opinions about resisting Japan and saving the country as much as possible according to their respective natures.</p>

<p>Eating three meals a day is something that everyone is used to and no one finds strange. If the money in your pocket today is only enough for two meals, or the money of three people combined is only enough for two people to eat, then the problem of food will have new meaning in your heart. If you can figure out a way to make the money for two meals enough for three meals, and the money for two people can fill the stomachs of three people, you will definitely be unexpectedly happy. Last summer, Zhu Ying, Zhong Ling, Zi Yun, Pei Zhi, Bei Tao and many others and I often tasted this flavor. But compared to those compatriots who eat tree bark and grass roots, it is really like heaven and earth. Below is a small picture of us eating at that time...</p>
<p>Three crab shell yellows;</p>
<p>Two bowls of mung bean porridge:</p>
<p>Eat it in your stomach,</p>
<p>Share immeasurable blessings.</p>

<p>Chaplin Initiates Basket Balancing Competition The screen's comical king Chaplin has become a global figure. Be it a land of culture or a land of barbarity, almost no one does not know Chaplin. He has received a warm welcome in various countries upon returning to Europe. After arriving in his birthplace of England, the entire nation has gone mad with joy in welcoming him. He had a whimsical idea in London, suddenly initiating a competition of balancing baskets on the head, scheduled to be held on the 10th of this month. For anyone who gets champagne, Chaplin will award them twenty pounds sterling. At one point, approximately forty individuals signed up to join. In the middle of August, many people were already practicing in the streets of London, walking around with a large stack of baskets balanced on their heads. Each person had a trainer, accompanied by several sponsors who would watch their movements and correct their posture at any moment. According to the rules of the competition stipulated by Chaplin, each person must stack twelve baskets, each weighing half a bushel, on their head and race for a quarter of a mile. The first to arrive will get champagne. According to general consensus, Mr. W. Sparks from Boroogh Market</p>
<h3 id="e144">To Save the Country, We Must Rely on Our Own Strength <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yu</p>
<p>Is most promising. And Boroogh Market happens to be where Chaplin spent his childhood fishing. However, it is said that there are also several strong contenders from Covent Garden who can compete with him. Now that September 10th has passed, it is unknown who has won.</p>
<p>Evil neighbors are using their violent military force to wreak havoc on our Chinese people. The tragedy of Wanbaoshan has not yet ended, and the storm of the Nakamura Incident has risen again. Recently, they have even disregarded humanity and violated public reason, brazenly invading our Shenyang and encroaching on our hinterland. Alas, our China, having survived disaster, faces death and destruction every day. As news of the alarm spreads, anyone with a bit of spirit is bound to have their eyes tear and hair stand on end, filled with grief and indignation. However, the five-minute enthusiasm of the people has been tried again and again, and the techniques of resistance are nothing more than holding meetings, sending telegrams, shouting slogans, and posting slogans. Even those who go further are nothing more than petitioning the central government to rectify officialdom and prepare for negotiations, etc. All are empty words and of no practical use. Just look at the newspapers in the past two days, which are full of such empty discussions, playing the old trick of armchair strategizing. Alas, when disaster is imminent, is there still room for you to wield your pens and play with ink, using this to show off your telegrams? I believe that all paper work is useless. We must start with the most basic, most effective, and most concrete methods. I believe that appealing to the League of Nations and issuing declarations are both dispensable. The first step must be to do our best to fulfill our responsibility to save the country, bit by bit. Although the effect of one person is limited, the power of the entire nation is considerable. Although it may sound like old news, it is better than just spouting empty words. We should do everything we can. I will list them below.</p>
<p>(1) Swear to never buy Japanese goods, from the individual to the family, to the village, and to the whole country.</p>
<p>(2) Do our best to donate money to save the country, and send it to the most reliable bank to be used to purchase airplanes, warships, weapons, ammunition, and food. (3) Each village and neighborhood should organize its own volunteer team, with ten people as a small group and one hundred people as a large group, providing their own rations, weapons, and ammunition. Then, elect someone with military knowledge to be the commander to prepare for advancing, fighting, retreating, and defending. Relying solely on the power of the special government is not enough.</p>
<p>(4) Organize a people's salvation group to gather the armed forces of the people as a backing for the government.</p>
<p>What has been said above still requires everyone to be united and of one mind to be effective. However, it is better to seek help from oneself than from others. We can only save ourselves, then we can save others, and then we can save the country. Otherwise, it will only be a flurry of busy paper telegrams, which will only be laughed at by the wooden clogs of the eastern neighbors.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Need for National Shame Advertisements <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Sheng</p>
<p>There are many anti-Japanese propaganda items posted in the city. However, they all require people who have received several years of education and know a few words to fully understand them. Isn't it true that there are more people who have not received education in our China? Not to mention the slogans posted on the trams, which pass by in an instant and cannot be seen clearly, most of the various slogans posted on the walls are also incomprehensible. Moreover, they will disappear in the event of violent winds and heavy rain. Therefore, pictures are important.</p>
<p>Aren't there many empty advertising boards towering in the streets? Why not paint a few eye-catching, simple, and obvious national shame advertisements on them using high-quality oil paint? They will permanently watch the passersby, making them aware that China's national enemy is Japan. In their shallow minds, they should not forget it. (Tyrannical Japan)</p>
<p>The walls outside schools can also be painted with a few national shame paintings so that the future masters of China who go to school every day will have our national shame deeply imprinted in their minds.</p>
<p>Please use coercive means on foreign cloth stores, southern goods stores, paper stores, toy stores, etc. (I am afraid that it is not necessary because their shopkeepers are also Chinese and have hearts and are not deaf and blind.) Paint a few of these eye-catching things on the front of their counters so that people who buy things will be spared from indirectly giving their hard-earned money to the enemy after seeing these eye-catching things. On the city standard clock that is under construction, its base and the bottom of the clock face can also be painted with a few pictures. In short, paint a few pictures wherever it is possible so that the people's hearts and minds are constantly alerted, so that they can reach the point of directly attacking Huanglong and avenging the national shame in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e146">What I Saw at the Road City Exhibition <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>The Road City Exhibition has been open for almost a week. The facilities in the venue are gradually being completed. Twenty-seven provinces of our country, except for Guangdong and Guangxi, all have special pavilions for display, with a variety of colors, doing their best to showcase their construction capabilities. The entrance to the exhibition hall is magnificent, with electric lights on top, as bright as day. Entering the venue, there is a passage leading to the inside. The dance floor and the Peking Opera stage are opposite each other, surrounded by special display pavilions from various places. The Jiangsu Pavilion occupies the largest area, which is due to the terrain.</p>
<p>Each exhibition hall, Shanghai, the capital, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Tianjin, and Beiping, have special pavilions due to their status as special municipalities. The rest have one room per province. In Jiangsu Province, Wuxian has the most displays. Other places, such as Yunnan and Guizhou, all list the most famous road construction in their respective provinces, either by taking photos or using models so that viewers can understand the content of everything at a glance. In addition to models, drawings, and photos, the items displayed in the hall</p>
<h3 id="e147">A Tragic and Enthusiastic Citizens' Meeting to Resist Japan and Save the Country <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>After the tyrannical Japan forcibly occupied our Liaoning and Jilin with military force, the people of the whole country unanimously mobilized their sad and angry hearts, determined to resist Japan, and took on the responsibility of saving the country and avenging shame. At this critical moment, everyone rose up, awakened the national spirit, and saved the situation. Everyone believed that the most urgent task at present was to save the country. Our lives and property can be sacrificed. Resisting Japan and saving the country is a matter of justice. In the past five or six days, the people of the whole country have been running around, calling out, and showing a spirit of courage and unity in their policies of resisting aggression and avenging their grievances. It can be seen that the people's hearts are not dead, and the country's affairs can still be accomplished. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the citizens of Shanghai held a citizens' meeting at the Public Sports Ground. The enthusiasm of the attendees can be said to have broken an unprecedented record. Observing the angry psychology and boiling blood of the crowd, it is even more felt that organized and united strength is great and valuable. The presidium was composed of leaders from all walks of life, totaling as many as seventy-two people. Under the leadership of the presidium, these hundreds of thousands of people maintained such a rigorous order. It is truly rare. Unfortunately, the person in charge of arranging the venue beforehand seemed to be too irresponsible. Even the simple radio broadcasting equipment was not installed. Therefore, how many people could hear the speeches and proposals on the rostrum? The countless crowds far away simply did not know what was being said. Among the many groups, the business community accounted for the majority. The Salvation Volunteer Army of the Postal Workers' Union did not take off their uniforms and were all full of energy, which was very admirable.</p>
<p>In short, in this national crisis, whether we declare war or not, whether justice can be upheld or not, we must strengthen our own strength. There is more than one way to strengthen ourselves. Strive to produce, pay attention to science, read more books and newspapers, and exercise our bodies. But the most important thing is to not buy Japanese goods. I hope that my compatriots will, from today onwards, use domestic goods, reduce consumption, and learn to be a Gandhi who lives a hard-working and simple life.</p>
<p>. There are also local products and minerals from various provinces, among which Guizhou and Shaanxi have the most. Guizhou Province produces minerals such as lead, copper, tin, iron, etc., while Shaanxi has more petroleum. The Shanghai City Pavilion has two rooms, with a Grand Shanghai Pictorial and a model of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. They are magnificent, as if the ancient palace halls are based on this model. The efforts of construction can be seen in general.</p>
<p>The Road City Exhibition, as the name suggests, should focus on road construction and all kinds of needed goods. Therefore, automobiles and road construction machinery are all listed in the exhibition. Automobiles, in particular, have everything that one could want. Ford, Austin, Chrysler, Dodge, etc., all display their latest models. The beauty of the style and the beauty of the machinery each have their own strengths. Viewers can carefully examine them and easily understand the mechanics of automobiles. At this time of construction, the need for automobiles is the most frequent and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>There are two points in the meeting that deserve the most attention. One is the petroleum mine produced in Shaanxi, and the other is the domestic heavy-duty automobile produced by the Liaoning Mortar Factory. None of the machinery in the car was made outside the factory. It is the first automobile produced in our country. The other day, engineers from the Dodge and Ford automobile companies in Shanghai carefully analyzed it and said that it was better than imported goods in every way. Unfortunately, the Japanese did not care about international faith and have now occupied our eastern province. The mortar factory was destroyed, and years of hard work were reduced to naught. This is indeed a huge blow. I hope the people of the country will quickly rise up and plan for it. Shaanxi's petroleum production is very large. When construction is completed in the future, automobiles will be used extensively. If we rely solely on importing petroleum, the leakage will be unimaginable. Therefore, it is also one of the most noteworthy points.</p>
<p>Notice This publication issues a National Day Special issue every Double Tenth Festival, as usual. However, this year, the country is in dire straits. What time is there to celebrate? Therefore, it is proposed to publish a special issue for saving the country on that day. The content focuses on practical strategies for resisting Japan and saving the country, studying Japan and the Northeast problem, and patriotic songs and anecdotes. It does not focus on empty talk. The length of the articles will still be kept short. Please send your manuscripts as soon as possible, preferably before October 5th. This is the notice.</p>

<h3 id="e148">A Husband's Wife (25) <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>Mr. Li has been coming home much earlier recently, but the relationship between the husband and wife is even worse than before. Mrs. Li has repeatedly talked to him, but he always ignores her and often quarrels with the servants. One moment he complains that the food is not good, and the next moment he complains that the water for washing his face is too hot. Mrs. Li is also patient and does not say anything. Recently, he does not care about household expenses at all. Mrs. Li does not ask him for money and only uses her own salary to cover expenses. In the past, she could still talk about her depression with Mr. Chen, but now, because Mrs. Chen is often at home, she rarely goes to Mr. Chen's house to sit and talk to avoid suspicion. During the day, everyone in the office is busy with work, and it is inconvenient to talk much. Usually, they would walk slowly to and from the company, talking and laughing all the way, but now he always hurriedly hires a streetcar instead, making it even more inconvenient to talk. She feels even more melancholy in her heart, feeling that men are ultimately unreliable. Even someone as gentle and sincere as him can change his mind, which really makes people feel heartbroken. But she also thinks: I don't have any deep relationship with him. He is a friend of my husband and has his own wife and children. Now his wife has returned and loves him. He no longer approaches me, which is very good. How can I blame him? If I go to pester him again, it will be my fault. Thinking of this, she only blames her own fate. Her heart is always sad, and she gets thinner day by day.</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Chen cannot fail to see it and is also sad for her, but he feels powerless. He only rejoices that he has restored the happy life of his family. He does not dare to ask Mrs. Li anything, does not dare to talk to his wife about Mrs. Li, and does not want to advise Mr. Li, but hopes to pull himself out of the controversy.</p>
<p>However, these situations have gradually become known among friends. They all suspect that Mr. Chen is to blame for the discord between Mr. and Mrs. Li. They go out and come in together every day, and their desks are opposite each other. There are only two of them in this office. Since she entered the company to work, the distance between the couple has become even greater, which is enough to prove that Mr. Chen has insulted Mr. Li's reputation and encroached on Mr. Li's rights. Mr. Chen himself did not know these words, but they have been making a lot of noise outside.</p>
<p>One day, Mrs. Chen told Mr. Chen what she had heard and advised him to be more careful.</p>
<p>He thought of asking the manager to fire Mrs. Li, but thinking of Mrs. Li, she is really pitiful, and he cannot bring himself to do it. He thought of resigning himself and finding a job elsewhere so as not to be with Mrs. Li every day, but he could not find a suitable position in a hurry, and his own living situation did not allow him to be idle for even a day. He was really hesitant.</p>

<p>— Min Yin</p>
<p>It's raining, the raindrops in the sky are gradually getting bigger, the originally gloomy Zhang Jun, glanced away from the geography textbook he was being taught in school, slowly got up to breathe some air, stretched his waist, and looked out the window, the flowers and trees outside the window were originally lively shaking, but now, they have stopped shaking, as if they were also gloomy,</p>
<p>While looking at the sky, looking at the flowers and trees, Zhang Jun's classmate Huang Qiyuan came to the door,</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang, are you still so leisurely, haven't you read today's newspaper, the Japanese soldiers are gradually opening up to our Beiping area," Huang Jun said to Zhang Jun,</p>
<p>"Yes, I saw it, because of this, I am even more gloomy, in the autumn of national affairs, what mood do we have to study," Zhang Jun replied,</p>
<p>"Listen, Mr. Zhang, there are slogans being shouted outside, probably Wusong universities and middle schools are marching, let's go take a look,"</p>
<p>The air outside the school gate is getting more and more tense, more serious, a very neat team of students is marching solemnly, when Zhang Huang and the others saw this, they had many feelings, thinking of the fear of being a conquered slave, this fear is not easy to forget, it hangs in their hearts every day,</p>
<p>In the sound of the rain, I heard the echo of this pace, even more gloomy, but, in this gloomy pace, I felt that this pace contained a solemn consciousness, an active consciousness, that it was definitely not a passive gloom, a retreating gloom, this gloom contained a bright consciousness,</p>
<p>The rain has not stopped, and the pace of this group of young and handsome students has gradually moved to the east,</p>
<p>"Japan is indeed too insulting to us," Huang Jun said, "Taking advantage of the time of our people's flood, to invade and seize land, it is really a despicable country," Zhang Jun said,</p>
<p>"That can't be blamed on them, this is the reason why our country is not strong, if our country is strong, would they dare to invade us," Huang Jun sighed, "That's really the case, if our country is strong, would they dare to do this," Zhang Jun said,</p>
<p>"Therefore, we young people must actively rise up, move forward, move forward to find our enemies, put life and death out of our minds, Mr. Zhang, isn't it, put life and death out of our minds, and fight the enemy to the death, that's right, but we must also be careful and not do things randomly, and be fooled,"</p>
<p>It was already dinner time, and Zhang Jun followed Huang Jun to eat, and at the dining hall, he heard conversations about 111-like things, some of which were very passionate, Zhang Jun was indeed eating uneasily, the innocent spirit of peacetime was reduced, and his innocent soul was covered with a layer of sorrow, the sorrow wrapped in gloom, he knew that the future of the country was indeed to be shouldered by themselves, and that they would not get brightness in sighs, they needed to prepare themselves, work hard, move forward, do long-term brain training, and physical training, in order to achieve their own wishes, the wishes of the family, the wishes of the entire China,........................... he gradually thought about it, forgetting to eat, a smile appeared on his face, and he involuntarily let out a quiet sound in his mouth: "Cheer up,"</p>
<h3 id="e150">Expansion of the Jiaoda Railway Management College <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>The Railway Management College of Jiaotong University is the only place in our country for cultivating scientific management talents. In the first half of the year, the Scientific Management Research Association, established by the Ministry of Industry and other departments, invited Principal Li and Dean Zhong of the college to attend. All the members praised the college's ability to cultivate scientific management talents who are urgently needed. They also requested Li and Zhong to make every effort to expand the college to meet the needs of this time of excessive demand. After Li and Zhong returned to the school, they conducted repeated research and drafted a concrete expansion plan, which was submitted to the school affairs meeting for approval. It was then submitted to the Ministry of Railways for instructions. After receiving the submission, the Ministry of Railways also recognized the importance of scientific management talents. Even though the ministry's funds were tight, it had to make an effort to raise additional funds and approve the expansion. Therefore, the Jiaotong University Railway Management College began a major expansion this summer. The expansion plan will divide the college into four departments: Railway Management, Public Administration, Financial Management, and Industrial Management. Each department will have a quota of twenty students. Furthermore, since it has already been expanded, the name "Railway Management College" is no longer appropriate (because it is not limited to railway management alone). Therefore, it was directly renamed the College of Management. The college pays special attention to applied science in order to live up to the name of scientific management. The entrance exams for those applying to the college require tests in physics, chemistry, and higher mathematics. Those entering Industrial Management and Financial Management must also study calculus, advanced physics, and advanced chemistry. They must have a deep understanding of the industrial field and a solid foundation in advanced statistics so that they can conduct thorough research. The Railway Management department will continue to focus on all railway-related knowledge. Public Administration will focus on Chinese language, official document drafting, political science, and public finance. All departments of the college pay great attention to English and French. Students must continue to study these languages for two years after entering the university as required courses. Subjects such as economics, bookkeeping, accounting, and statistics are equally important for all departments. The completeness of the curriculum, the thoroughness of the facilities, and the seriousness of the professors are comparable to those of the Scientific Management College of the University of Illinois in the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Aviation in Malaya by Qiu Bin-cun <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>The aircraft, named Abel Tasman, was scheduled to leave Batavia on May 12th, which was the day after the Dutch capital's mail plane arrived in Batavia. It would depart immediately upon arrival to save time. It was scheduled to arrive in Wyndham, Australia, on May 15th, and in Melbourne on May 19th. It would arrive in Sydney on May 20th. It is expected to stop at many places within Australia to load and unload mail. As for the return trip from Australia to the Netherlands, the flight will be faster and with fewer stops. It is expected to take only four days from Sydney to Batavia. The passenger airfare from Batavia to the capital of the Netherlands was originally set at 2,500 Dutch guilders, but has now been reduced to 2,000 Dutch guilders. This 2,000 guilders includes the landing fees at each airport along the way, as well as lodging and meals. In short, people in Batavia who want to travel far to the Dutch capital can arrive safely for only 2,000 guilders. Conversely, people in the Dutch capital who want to come to Batavia also have the same convenience. This is truly good news for the travel industry and a sign of the rapid advancement of transportation.</p>
<p>Aviation Locations in Malaya</p>
<p>A British amateur pilot has made multiple flight records between Britain and Australia. Because of his excellent performance, the British authorities conducted a test flight for British-Australian postal aviation to prepare for the future implementation of airmail delivery. The round-trip route must pass through several places in Malaya. Therefore, the construction of airfields in Malaya is extremely important. The important aviation locations in Malaya are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Penang Airfield</p>
<p>The construction of the Penang Malai Pai airfield has been under consideration for a long time since it was proposed. Although the government has sent people to conduct surveys, the method of implementation has not yet been determined. Local businessmen are discussing this delay, especially in light of the recent commencement of postal aviation in the Dutch East Indies, which is closely related to the construction of the Penang airfield. Local people doubt whether the government is truly proceeding with the construction of the Malai Pai airfield. As for the government's survey work, the Bureau of Public Works sent people to survey the boundaries in January of this year, and the survey was completed in March. It is estimated that the airfield site is located 11 miles from George Town in Malai Pai, with a total of 30 plots of land, all planted with rice and coconut trees. The designated airfield area is 280 acres, of which 200 acres are privately owned. Therefore, there is no problem in acquiring the land. Last month, the director of the Dutch postal airline visited Penang for a week. According to his published opinion, they plan to choose Penang as the flight landing field for the company in the Malay Peninsula, because that place is more suitable than Bangkok, Medan, and Singapore. The company has no business interest in Bangkok, and Singapore is too far to the Far East. Therefore, if the Penang airfield is completed, they will land in Penang. After arriving on the island, he personally went to the Malai Pai airfield for an inspection, believing that the airfield could be completed in the near future. However, he received reliable information from official sources that the airfield could not be completed in less than two years. The Penang European Chamber of Commerce is paying close attention to this matter and will raise it for discussion at its semi-annual general meeting this month to promote its realization.</p>
<p>(2) Alor Setar Airfield</p>
<p>As for the Alor Setar airfield, it already has a rough scale and does not require much construction and equipment. It is already available for use. (To be continued)</p>
