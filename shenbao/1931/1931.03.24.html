<h3>參觀應瑞軍艦之零拾</h3>
<p>— 王曰叟</p>
<p>日昨由海軍舊同學之介紹得參觀停泊高昌廟之應瑞軍艦前承詳細解釋乃得許多常識茲記之以實自由談</p>
<p>▲修理方竣煥然一新　應瑞軍艦此次帶海軍練習生巡洋之後即入江南造船所修船日前出塢故煥然一新該艦爲一九一一年由英國維克斯廠所造當時價値二百四十萬船身長三百四十六尺寛三十九尺五寸排水量爲二千四百六十噸聞馬力有六千匹每點鐘速度可行二十海里在我國海軍中可稱數一數二之軍艦</p>
<p>▲槍砲羅列軍容整肅　予到艦時即由海軍練習生引導前往參觀艙面槍砲羅列彌覺威嚴并承將砲衣卸下乃得一觀其中構造計艦之前後各有六寸口徑之大砲一聞開放此砲時須用水手九名射力可達至一萬三千六百碼之遠邊砲三吋徑者有二三磅者有六此外有高射砲二及機關槍二艙中尙有槍枝甚多聞火藥子彈等皆愼重裝於火藥艙中</p>
<p>▲軍號威嚴落旗一致　艦上升旗下旗之禮節十分愼重予參觀槍砲後已下午六時是日泊在江中之軍艦有海容應瑞永健等乃由海容軍艦當隊長通知各艦預備下旗繼而軍號一排各艦同時下旗艦中人員皆立正舉手以表示尊敬黨國旗之意下旗後艦上電燈同時開亮蓋已入晚也繼乃參觀保定台保定台爲作戰時艦長所駐之處全船機關皆在此處台前有鐵板圍住厚凡三寸蓋以抵禦砲彈者後更參觀採海燈全船探海燈凡四計大者二小者二大者光亮可射出二萬碼非特供作戰時之用即霧中行船亦受絶大之助力也</p>
<p>▲機槍鍋爐一窺神秘　艙面參觀後即轉入艙内先觀機艙計有氣旋機三副聞中國海軍艦隊用氣旋機者只有應瑞肇和二艦二艦蓋爲同時製造之姊妹艦也此外有淡水機二蓋用以將海水製成淡水以供鍋爐及飲食之用者繼乃參觀鍋爐間鍋爐凡六烟管者二水管者四如六副鍋爐同時燒火則鍋爐間之氣候當在一百度左右故將艦面空氣引下使其流通方可稍減熱度</p>
<p>▲魚雷六發實力雄厚　應瑞艦中有魚雷六發其中二隻已陳列艙面其餘四隻皆放在魚雷艙中魚雷口徑凡十八吋長約二十尺聞魚雷射放落水時擊水板與水相併空氣即可透入魚雷自已便可直進故魚雷後面有車脅二一向左轉一向右轉蓋使雷身平衡方可直進云</p>
<h3>印度遊記（三）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>至清潔一事亦不必要旣與自然同化試行於街市公園則裸體大仙及一疋灰布被身者比比皆是高臥義皇膚色如鐵如銅然有時執老經本之歌獨嘯自吟臥於草地上及道旁此即其家也滿街臥者與牛同眠人牛俱忘得大解脱</p>
<p>若以中國舊文化比之中國敬老四十强仕五十服官故稱老大帝國而印人尙老仙人老哲人不但老而且入化也故與中國以最大教訓者爲達糜祖師而達摩到中國已一百四十歲又面壁十年一百五十歲眞怪人矣而中國内明之禪學及少林拳術劍法内工亦均託之達摩蓋或非無因也（達摩本名達磨波羅言向信也）</p>
<p>與印度兩大老哲人爲印度首領亦均兩老怪也太戈爾已七十餘甘地較之少數歲甘地派較激烈雖云無抵抗亦漸有有武器者太戈爾足跡遍全球近方自俄國歸此老亦健哉若以緬甸比印度但覺稚氣</p>
<p>緬甸婦女滿街頗形春氣至印度則市上少見婦女特教育界勢力不小覺印度氣象是由秋冬而入於解脱也</p>
<p>前者甘地被拘於西印度近孟買地方之某市獄中各地被拘志士共有五千人之多婦女亦有數十名</p>
<p>二十一日太戈爾姪女沙拉大約參觀其女校并同至其家茶話其陳列有佛象刀劍及日本人畫女像與太戈爾像言其叔將返國余可待之并言中國將請其講演亦可遊中國其子出見乃在大學學法科其子告余今印度少年均願愛國奮鬥也行於市但見羣牛游行自在而且馴良印人告余此自由牛也人許願解放之無工可做余視之大白牛不少有曳車者有自由散步者到處見之大白牛果然肥健多力如法華經佛所云比平常牛爲大角端正始信佛於物理觀察殊有研究不虚也惟放牛自由之俗在緬甸余亦見之聞之尙有懷疑今乃大釋然彼學於印度者也此等牛游行街市余見其有時吃人商品果知商人敬而取信亦不加撻　也惟有一事因自由牛多撒糞街上在所不免似與衛生有礙余行路有時踏於足上然印不以爲煩因余讀佛説密宗咒法須得白牛糞入咒方成就則牛糞亦非可鄙視之物耶</p>
<p>此等道德之高尙華人眞學不到然此俗出自印度教今印度教遍全印而其人並不信佛以放牛自由戒殺生物例之印度教之教義必甚高深與佛伯仲佛乃憑之以出者决非佛獨自創造如此空前哲理也俄國勞工主義盛行人人須做工而印人敬牛不使作工依然生存將來其爲印度文化超過俄國之像徵乎</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>帝國主義者在華航業發展史</h3>
<p>— 曼引</p>
<p>—張心澂著—</p>
<p>帝國主義的發展是由於海外貿易之盛興海外貿易之盛興又恃交能便利爲其發動機倘使交通不發達則運輸不便利縱使覓得廣大的商塲而過剩的商品無法向海外求售這樣帝國主義當然不會發展到今日的形勢因此自十八世紀産業革命蒸汽機發達以來火車輪船便應運而生尤以後者爲最要誠以現世界交通已由内河沿海進而至於大洋航業之競爭實足以决定帝國主義者之生死關頭的所在呵</p>
<p>我們看最近日美爲爭太平洋領導權的角逐法意在地中海上利害衝突之醞釀而我們老大的英帝國主義忙着築新加坡軍港維持其在遠東的勢力這些都是很明白地告訴我們帝國主義與航業實有不可「須臾離」的形勢正如一個建全的人體必有流通的血脈的關係一樣如其我們翻開帝國主義發展史一看那一定可以發現大部幾乎是全册是帝國主義者在航業上競爭的頁子</p>
<p>航業發達與帝國主義關係之密切旣如上述牠與殖民地弱小民族的關係又怎樣呢這是很明顯的帝國主義恃航業發達爲侵略剥削殖民地的武器那殖民地爲自身計對這意外侵略剥削之恩賜當然是會生反抗排斥的念頭同時自己也非努力猛省改善自己的航業不可因爲徒知排外而不知整頓自己那也不是根本的辦法呵</p>
<p>中國是次殖民地中國民衆是世界弱小民族之一這是無可諱言的事實中國所受的帝國主義的壓迫與侵略是多到不可勝數了尤以經濟一項爲最駭人計自與帝國主義通商以來中國每年平均的損失總在兩三萬元以上這樣一個巨大的數目就是那些停泊在黄浦江邊帝國主義的商船一出一進的恩賜呵因此要保障這多量外溢的利權無疑的除了（一）徵收保護税（二）努力發展本國航業兩項工作外剩下的便是設法抵制外國商船進出收回内河沿海的航行權了</p>
<p>怎樣會設法抵制外國商船進出而收回内河航行權呢關於這我們就有看看張心澂君著的這本「帝國主義在華航業發展史」之必要了</p>
<p>在卷首自序中著者曾有這樣幾句話</p>
<p>「…我國自海通以來輪船之利害得失亦參半矣歐美之種種物質文明與夫政治學説非輪船爲交通之利器固莫由輸入以𨬽吾也而帝國主義者挾其侵略之策隨輪船以俱至使我國受其政治力與經濟力之壓迫則亦輪船惡魔之所賜也…吾人方笑此惡魔相鬥而彼已在吾境中張牙舞爪以吸我之膏血近日頻聞改訂條約收回航權之呼籲吾人若不能逹此目的自行利用此文明利器以裨益我國之交通發達我國之産業則反客爲主吾境内外他人之利器皆足爲惡魔於我也吾人欲利用此利器不可不研究他人之如何利用欲事研究不假遠求各國在華之航業之多於我又有深切之關係亦足以供吾人研究而吾人之所不可不研究者也」</p>
<p>從這我們可以知道著者之用意與本書之宗旨了當然這是誰也承認的孫子云「知己知彼百戰百勝」我們若不知他人何以同他戰呢同時我們若不知道帝國主義在華航業之實况而徒　收回航行權這又怎樣會成功呢因此這本書委實地有犧牲本刋一點實貴篇幅介紹的價値</p>
<p>全書計分十二章第一章總論第二章英國在華之航業第三章日本在華之航業第四章美國第五德國漸次及於梛威荷蘭法國義大利丹麥瑞典俄國每國分一章叙述每章之内又分數節在第一章總論的第一節「緒論」裏告訴我們外國商船在中國工作之成績民十六年來中國損失總數約在十八萬萬以上第二節「沿革槪略」對中國航行權之喪失作一　簡明的叙述可稱一段帝國主義之航業初期侵略中國史第三節「民國以來進出口船數」附圖表多張明瞭之至第四節「航運槪况」對民國歷年來之航業作一簡明叙述甚爲扼要第六節「民國十六年進出口船舶槪况」與第五節「英日在華航運勢力之比較」都列有詳細之圖表使人一看瞭然</p>
<p>第二章專論英國在華之航業第三章專論日本叙述特多幾佔全書總量之半此蓋由於英國爲海上覇王在中國航業發達上亦居第一日本爲後起之秀其發展亦驚人兩者於我國航業實有「反客爲主」的形勢因此本書對他們討論獨多也是當然的我們過細讀了對兩國在華航業情形確能有很明瞭的印象如英國大古怡和隆茂怡泰仁記昌興與日本之日本郵船會社大阪日清等比較有名的輪船公司其經營之變遷所屬的艘數航行之路線現在營業之情形怎樣都給我們一個很正確明白的答案此外如德·法意·美等國也是一樣</p>
<p>這裏所謂「給我們一個很正確明白的答案」正是「知己」又「知彼」的工作的表現目今中國統一訓政開始在整個中國建設的工作中爲交通便利計爲抵制帝國主義侵略計更爲發展本國之航業計那當然本書實有看看之必要本書之價値也只有在這裏面才可以尋出</p>
<p>其次本書叙及各帝國主義者爲發展自己之航業而有排斥敵視其他帝國主義之航業其一種「鈎心鬥角」的競爭心與進取的精神實爲我們所望塵莫及換句話就是爲我們所應當效法的例如丨</p>
<p>「英國於西曆一七五三年訂航海補助法歐戰起後造船業停頓而商般又時有沉落於是對於獎勵航海大爲猛進遂有五大設施一國營海上保險二禁商船輸出三國訂租船費四國營船舶五國營造船所停戰後英政府對於航海事業除澳洲及坎拿大外一切讓私人經營政府於一九二零年設立航海委員會審查航業者之請願及主管官廳提出之問題並指導統一及改良方法…」五九—六○頁</p>
<p>「一八七五年定航業爲民營由國家補助中日戰後日本得我國賠欵用之於航一八九六年訂航海獎勵法及造船獎勵法航行中國綫南洋綫印度綫歐洲綫皆有補助…歐戰停戰後益致力於航業造船補助以期滿而廢乃對於船舶材料免進口税並補助製鐵鋼業以間接爲造船之補助…」</p>
<p>這是我們政府所應當效法的</p>
<p>再看他們公司經營之方法營業發展之變遷是又爲我們從事航業同志所應當效法的關於這書中叙述特多這兒爲省篇幅恕我不引例了</p>
<p>總之這本書無論是用在欲明瞭帝國主義在華航業發展情形用在爲發展本國航業而抵抗舶來品的同志們甚至於用在爲中國一份公民責任上都是一本應當看的有益的書因爲我們看看帝國主義者的船隻在内河沿海暢行無阻其侵略我主權孰甚凡爲我國民者能不急思抵制之法嗎</p>

<h3>璧·我祝福你·</h3>
<p>是一個飄渺的夢吧我不相信這是實在的事情自己的不幸像逃卒似的流浪到上海來不覺已有半年了這半年中爲了生活的奔走從没有一天儘情的歡樂過黯淡的心境永遠是像暮色蒼茫的黄昏誰知還有一個更不幸的被我們呼爲小妹妹的璧據華妹的來信説是因家中被匪搶刧一空現在竟被生活逼迫得在鄕裏的小學做孩子們的教師了她燦爛的前途將從此是無邊的黑暗佔領</p>
<p>我重新的把那一頁信箋打開來看好像有把握的在信上不會有這消息的但是當一觸到我眼廉時那幾行字搶先的跳進我的眼中了我怕看下去用力的扔在桌上了移開了視線我凝望着窗外陰暗的路燈寥落的行人我是深長的透了一口氣像要把凝聚在心頭上的一片愁雲吹開</p>
<p>從黑暗的角落裏閃出一個白白的女人的臉兩頰上像玫瑰花的暈紅突然一聲怒吼的汽車嗚嗚聲這美麗的幻影消失了留給我的是急劇跳動的心弦</p>
<p>我恨不得飛到故鄕去馬上拉着華妹的手問别後的璧在那醉人的笑渦上還是漾着微笑嗎更要問她還是像小麻雀似的跳躍嗎但是這隔絶我們的山河我要咒駡你太殘忍了</p>
<p>痴痴的站了一陣我又患神經病似的拾起那床上的信箋了興奮的唸起「文兄這是出於你的意外吧我們這一羣大孩子分散得太可憐了現在璧竟做了小孩子的教師（因爲……」唸到道裏我又恨恨地扔開在悲潮的激迸中湧起了往事的回憶</p>
<p>那是去年在故鄕署假的一天趁着早上的清凉太陽還没有晒到街心時我緩步的踱到一月來没有晤面的華的家裏去順便問華的哥哥幾時返家度暑假因爲他是我幾年前的兒時同學如今是整整的一年没有見過在静坐的閒時我常常的想念他的</p>
<p>走到華的家額上竟滲出黏黏的汗珠了當我掀開埀下的門帷一眼就看見一個陌生的少女悠閒的斜倚在椅上看書我壓制急喘的呼吸低聲的呌了一句華她回過臉來注視了我一下忙把手上握着的筆擲到桌上欣喜地從椅中跳下來迎着我説</p>
<p>「文你來了嗎這久爲什麽不來呢我正想寫信呌你來玩玩假使没有璧姊我眞要煩死了」華説到「璧姊」兩字側過臉來望着那一個少女那少女驚異的抬起頭來微笑地輕輕的向我點頭我也茫然的點一點頭了</p>
<p>經了華的介紹我才知道她是華的同學我坐在桌傍的椅中後那少女匆忙的走出去了我想她是害羞吧在華遞給我一根香烟時不介意的問</p>
<p>「華璧女士爲什麽跑出去呢是害羞嗎」</p>
<p>華噗的笑了一聲燃着了火柴後好像嘲笑不了解似的説</p>
<p>「哼她害羞嗎恐怕你還没有她大方呢」沉思了一瞬華又接着説「就會來的」</p>
<p>我呼了一口烟出來笑笑也没有表示否認她的話於是華又暴風雨似的連串的説了一頓她告訴我她哥哥今年暑假不回來並且告訴我她買了很多的湖蓮剥好了邀了很多的朋友來吃……</p>
<p>華滔滔的還没有説完時璧女士跳躍的跑進來手中捧着大包的食物頓時桌上凌亂地散滿了璧女士用手指着桌上的東西呌我吃但是我被她那醉人的笑渦暗暗的沁入了我心的深處</p>
<p>眞是如華所説的她是大方得我不能形容了她毫無顧忌的問長問短我到不知怎樣的來答應她了當我需呐的説不出時她掩着口的大笑起來使我倒有些難爲情的不安像她信樣的態度眞不像是第一次初見面的人我心裏是感到奇異的喜悦她看見我沉默着又從椅上跳起來微笑的説</p>
<p>「是先生我唱一個歌你聽好嗎」她走到我的面前來了</p>
<p>我拍着手的表示歡迎於是她開始的唱起來了那幽揚的聲音像琴聲一樣的使人陶然華也附和的唱起來了我一面静静的聽着一面想到璧同華的天眞我覺得她們才是人間最幸福的寵兒…</p>
<p>那從此後的歡聚我更是不堪去想了僅僅只有半年的時間我們這一羣大孩子中的變化太令人意外但是那猖獗的匪是使我們東飄西散的主因呵</p>
<p>窗外吹來襲人的寒風我頽然的倒在椅上璧的影子又逐漸的展開了我從錯綜的心緒中迸出這樣顫抖的一句</p>
<p>璧我祝福你</p>

<h3>Shao Yuanchong, Acting President of the Legislative Yuan, Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu Jingheng Presided Over the Oath-Taking Ceremony</p>
<p>Nanjing – Shao Yuanchong, Member of the National Government and Vice President, Acting President of the Legislative Yuan, held an oath-taking ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, after the National Government Memorial Week. Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Wu Jingheng, Wang Chonghui, Song Ziwen, Wang Boqun, Shao Lizi, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Shangqing, Ru Yuli, Liu Ruiheng, Wei Daoming, and all the staff of the Legislative Yuan, more than 300 people, attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek first bowed and then presented the seal. Chairman Chiang presented the seal, and Acting President Shao received it. Next was the oath-taking ceremony, presided over by Central Committee Member Wu Jingheng. After the oath, Wu delivered a speech, saying: Legislation is very difficult, and understanding the essence of legislation is even more difficult. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to grasp the internal principles of that essence. In the entirety of the Premier's teachings, there are many provisions regarding legislative principles. The Legislative Yuan's past work has been excellent. All legislative members are not only proficient in law but also faithful followers of the Premier. Therefore, all laws enacted do not violate the legislative principles established by the Premier. Acting President Shao has worked in the Legislative Yuan for a long time and is very experienced. After assuming office, he will surely be able to base his work on the legislative principles established by the Premier and complete all major laws in the shortest possible time, so that everyone knows to abide by them, and then the country will have progress. Next, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech, saying: Today, Acting President Shao assumes office and will surely abide by the Premier's advocacy and fully develop all the legislative principles left by the Premier. What is hoped for today is that legislation is for the public good. Whether social stability and national progress are possible depends entirely on the quality of legislation. The laws enacted must be enforceable and make it clear to the people that the laws are entirely for the public good, so that they are beneficial to the country and the people and do not lose the spirit of legislation. Finally, Shao Yuanchong replied, saying: I am ordered to assist in legislative matters, and I am very apprehensive about my lack of talent and knowledge. Today, upon taking office, I receive the instructions from the Central Government representative and the Chairman of the National Government, and I will respectfully accept them and actively work. The past work of the Legislative Yuan has been based entirely on the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the principles established by the Central Government in formulating various major laws. During President Hu's tenure, all civil and commercial laws have been formulated separately. In the future, I will strictly abide by the Central Government's intentions and the Chairman's instructions, and work actively. At the same time, I hope that President Lin will return to Nanjing as soon as possible to take office, so that I can follow him and lighten my responsibilities somewhat. After the reply, music was played, and the meeting adjourned. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>German-Austrian Economic Alliance and Attitudes of Various Countries</h3>
<p>After the publication of the German-Austrian economic agreement, the diplomatic representatives of France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia visited the Austrian Foreign Minister, saying that it would violate the Geneva Protocol of 1922. The world believes that this move by the three countries will break the new agreement between Germany and Austria. However, the Austrian diplomatic community does not believe that this move by the ministers of the three countries is a formal protest, saying that it was due to seeing newspaper reports that caused this misunderstanding. If a detailed explanation is given, it is believed that the doubts of the three countries can be dispelled. Although the words are as such, what the future will be like is still unknown.</p>
<p>According to French newspapers, the reason why France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia object is that in the 19th century, the various Germanic states first concluded a customs union and eventually became a political alliance and became a country. Today, this move by Germany and Austria may be a prelude to the future merger of Germany and Austria, and without the consent of each member of the League of Nations Administrative Council in the Geneva Treaty, Germany and Austria cannot have a political alliance. However, Germany and Austria believe that this is the prelude to the European Economic Union created by French Foreign Minister Briand. The tariffs of the two countries are still independent and cannot be said to be a customs union, let alone a political alliance. Both have their own basis, and whether they can understand each other in the future will depend on the views and actual situation of the various countries to prove. Besides, according to German newspapers, the opinions of the British and American media, the comments of the London press are not unfriendly, while the New York Times warmly welcomes this agreement and congratulates Germany and Austria.</p>

<h3>Austria-Germany Customs Union</h3>
<p>The First Step to Achieving European Federation</p>
<p>French Newspapers Concerned About Political Cooperation</p>
<p>Italy, France, and Czechoslovakia Issue Informal Protests to Austria</p>
<p>Berlin and Vienna Publish Views on Treaty Conclusion</p>
<p>Reuter, Vienna, 22nd – The diplomatic representatives of France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia visited the Austrian Foreign Minister yesterday, stating that the conclusion of the new German-Austrian economic agreement would violate the Geneva Protocol of October 4, 1922. It is evident that these three countries intend to disrupt the new German-Austrian agreement. The Austrian Foreign Minister had indicated that the German-Austrian agreement was the first step towards achieving a pan-European federation. Berlin and Vienna have each published an article detailing the German-Austrian agreement. The Berlin publication stated that if other European countries wished to join, the German and Austrian governments were willing to negotiate with them to achieve the same goal. Germany and Austria will issue the same tax rates and customs laws, which cannot be modified except on the basis of mutual agreement. No import or export taxes will be levied between Germany and Austria, but taxes on specially designated goods may be temporarily collected by mutual agreement. The customs administration of both countries will remain completely independent. This new agreement may apply to international trade and trade with third countries. Either government may conclude separate commercial treaties with third countries, provided that these treaties do not conflict with the new agreement. The two sides will cooperate with each other in such negotiations to the extent possible. An arbitration committee will be established to resolve disputes. The agreement will be valid for three years, after which it must be terminated with one year's notice. The Vienna publication indicates that this new agreement is the result of efforts to achieve results in the spirit of the Geneva Conference proposal.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 23rd – Diplomatic circles here do not consider the visits of the French, Italian, and Czech envoys to Foreign Minister Schober as a formal protest against the German-Austrian economic agreement. They believe that the visits were merely expressions of concern due to misunderstandings arising from newspaper reports. It is expected that Mr. Schober's detailed explanations will dispel the doubts of the three governments after clarifying that the agreement cannot be regarded as a formal customs merger.</p>
<p>Reuter, Beirut, 23rd – The German states in the 19th century first concluded a customs union, which eventually led to a political alliance. Looking back on history, today's new German-Austrian economic agreement is probably a precursor to future German-Austrian cooperation. This morning, French newspapers expressed concern about this, pointing out that the German-Austrian customs agreement is a tool for overturning the peace treaty, as the treaty stipulates that Germany and Austria are not allowed to form a political alliance without the consent of all members of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Some newspapers stated that the alliance is more or less a fait accompli. French Foreign Minister Briand was very busy yesterday, exchanging views with diplomatic circles.</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 23rd – European capitals are uneasy about the German-Austrian customs agreement. Political circles here are very puzzled and now reiterate that the agreement does not conflict with existing obligations, but is actually the first step towards the economic unification of the European federation that French Foreign Minister Briand has so vigorously promoted. So far, no foreign country has raised any protests, and political circles here do not expect any, as neither Austria nor Germany has violated any obligations. Both countries retain their complete economic and political independence.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd – German newspapers have compiled comments from newspapers around the world on the new German-Austrian customs agreement, stating that it is universally recognized as the most important and greatest international action. London newspapers were initially slightly hesitant, but are now also commenting, and their attitude is still not unfriendly, but seems to be less sympathetic than the majority of Paris newspapers. The New York Times warmly welcomes the agreement and congratulates Germany and Austria.</p>
<h3>Germany's New Budget Bill</h3>
<p>Second Reading Passed by Parliament</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd – The Ministry of Finance budget and the overall budget bill were passed by parliament today in their second reading. The only remaining issue is the Communist Party's vote of no confidence on the new tax proposals of other parties, but several of the new tax proposals have already been approved by the parliamentary budget committee. It is widely believed that the Communist Party has little hope of obtaining a majority in parliament, so the budget bill issue can be said to have been resolved.</p>
<h3>Italy Celebrates 12th Anniversary of Fascist Party's Founding</h3>
<p>Grand Celebrations Held Nationwide</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Rome, 23rd – Italy is holding grand celebrations today to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party. The Fascist Party was founded twelve years ago today, in 1919, by the current Prime Minister Mussolini as its leader. At that time, the party had only 105 members, the so-called "First Fascist Fighters," who held the founding ceremony inside the "Popolo d'Italia" newspaper office. Over the past twelve years, it has grown into today's grand scale. Today, all government agencies, banks, companies, hotels, and private homes in Rome are flying the national flag to express their congratulations. Especially in Milan, Naples, Turin, and other major cities, orators of the Fascist Party stand before the public and sing the praises of the glorious achievements of the Fascist era over the past twelve years, tirelessly. The public is overjoyed to hear this.</p>

<h3>Three Defendants in the Lahore Conspiracy Case Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>To Be Reviewed by the High Court</p>
<p>Reuter, Karachi, 22nd – The news that three defendants in the Lahore Conspiracy Case in India are about to be executed has disrupted the preparations for the All-India Congress, which opened here on Tuesday. The Indian National Defense Committee has petitioned for the condemned. The case is scheduled to be reviewed by the High Court tomorrow. Until the outcome is determined, the welcoming speech of Dr. Kitchlew, chairman of the reception committee of the All-India Congress, cannot be delivered, because the welcome speech assumed that the death penalty would be pardoned, so the welcome speech advocated that the All-India Congress should participate in the Round Table Conference in India. If the original verdict is not revoked and is actually implemented, Dr. Kitchlew will advocate that the All-India Congress not participate in the work of the Round Table Conference.</p>

The Department of Agriculture has also purchased a lot of cotton.</p>
<h3>Scottish Express Train Derails, Injuring People</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 22nd – The Scottish Express, the fastest train in the world, was traveling from London to Edinburgh this afternoon at a speed of 70 miles per hour when the engine suddenly leaped up like a horse and then fell off the rails, causing the carriages to collide and intertwine. Passengers were unable to escape. Rescuers rushed to the scene, and ironworkers and doctors arrived one after another. Late into the night, they were still unable to rescue all the passengers. According to official reports, six people died, nine were seriously injured, and many others suffered minor injuries.</p>
<h3>French Airplane Visiting Japan to Return Home Soon; Phoenix Still Missing</h3>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 23rd – French aviators Beidouin and Ménard arrived here on Saturday and are scheduled to fly back to France on the 26th of this month, weather permitting, still following the same route. However, this time they will avoid the defense area when passing through Korea.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Manila, 23rd – U.S. Shipping Co. pilot Robert Johnson has been missing for four days since his Phoenix aircraft came to the Philippines. The warships that went to search the open sea have also returned in disappointment. The only remaining hope is that it may have drifted into the ocean and been rescued by a fishing boat. The U.S. Navy's separate searches were personally commanded by Rear Admiral McNamee, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, and cost 75,000 Philippine pesos (equivalent to more than 150,000 Chinese dollars). If the U.S. Navy Department does not allocate additional funds to offset the cost, the U.S. destroyer fleet's annual patrol of the southern Philippine islands will be suspended.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Memorial Week for the Central Government and the National Government</h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd, the Central Party Headquarters held the 104th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Central Committee members Ding Weifen, Ma Chaojun, and Chen Lifu, as well as guests from various agencies and staff of the Party Headquarters, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chairman Ding Weifen presided over the ceremony. The chairman's report was as follows: "Comrades, today's report was originally to be given by Committee Member Li Shizeng, but because he has gone to Shanghai and has not returned, I will give the report on his behalf. The situation in China today is that military reorganization is progressing day by day, and political progress is also happening. However, some people believe that although the military situation has ended, there is no way to settle the military, which may lead to future chaos. This is not the case. China's territory is so vast. Looking at China from all directions, we know that China's border defenses are not only not too numerous, but perhaps even insufficient. Take the Northeast border defense as an example. A certain imperialist is actively invading the Northeast, sparing no effort, especially in military preparations, seeking to expand. But looking back at China's military situation, how is it? China's military strength is really no match for them. If we want to strengthen the Northeast border defense, then the Northeast can accommodate a large number of troops. Take the Northwest border defense as an example. There are also red imperialists actively invading. They have already built a railway to encircle Xinjiang and the Northwest, which is not only an economic invasion but also a military invasion. But what is the military preparation of our Northwest authorities? There is really no force to resist foreign aggression, and it is even worse than the Northeast. If we want to strengthen the Northwest border defense, then these thousands of miles of Northwest can accommodate a large number of troops. So our troops only need to be properly reorganized, and there will be no problem. There is another aspect. For the national defense army, we must not only pay attention to quantity, but also pay attention to the improvement of quality, that is, the army must undergo rigorous training, because soldiers only need to be refined, not numerous. If there are well-trained troops to settle down, of course there will be no problem. This is the most important thing for our Party's government at present. We comrades must understand that after the internal rebellion is quelled, on the one hand, we must seek construction, and on the other hand, strengthening border defense must also be paid close attention. But how do we pay attention? That is, we must pay close attention to the situation in the Northeast and Northwest at all times, and at the same time, we must have precise development plans, so that the surplus troops will not only not become a problem, but also make political progress day by day. This is what our comrades should pay attention to." After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the National Government held the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, Shao Yuanchong, Soong Tzu-wen, Ru Yuli, Wang Boqun, Liu Shangqing, Liu Ruiheng, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaozu, Wu Jingheng, and staff and guests, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony. Wang Chonghui gave a lecture on the Three Principles of the People, stating that the Principle of Democracy is scattered throughout the Three Principles of the People and various posthumous teachings. Dr. Sun said that politics is the business of all people, and governing is managing the affairs of all people, which is politics. The power to manage the affairs of all people is political power, and the people's power to manage politics is democracy. The affairs of all people must be clearly known by all people themselves, and it must be known that the country exists for the people, not the people for the country. Therefore, we advocate democracy. Dr. Sun said that democratic politics is the trend of world evolution, and we should catch up. On the one hand, we must reduce domestic wars and guarantee peace and unification, which cannot be done without advocating democracy. He also said that the Kuomintang's Principle of Democracy has three characteristics: (1) it is the Principle of Democracy for the nation and the people's livelihood; (2) it is revolutionary, not the so-called natural human rights; and (3) in addition to indirect democracy, there is also direct democracy.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Dr. Sun also divided politics into political power and administrative power, one belonging to the people and one belonging to the government, and the two can complement each other to realize the ideal democratic politics. The work of the period of political tutelage is to train the people to use the four political powers and establish the foundation of the five powers, etc. The full text of the speech is being organized.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Convenes Meeting</h3>
<p>Jiang Guangnai Arrives in Ganzhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Chen Jitang recovered from his illness and was discharged from the hospital, all the division and brigade commanders stationed in Guizhou and the Northeast Jiang have come to the province to greet Mr. Chen. Chen returned to the Eighth Route Army Headquarters to work a few days ago, and on the 16th, he received his subordinate officers as usual. At 3:00 p.m. on the 17th, Chen held another meeting upstairs at the headquarters. The attendees included Yu Hanmou, commander of the 59th Division; Xiang Hanping, commander of the 62nd Division; Li Yangjing, commander of the 63rd Division; Yang Dingzhong, commander of the newly編16th Division; Zhang Ruigui, commander of the 1st Independent Brigade; Huang Renhuan, commander of the 6th Independent Brigade; Huang Yanzhen, commander of the 125th Brigade; Huang Zhiwen, commander of the 126th Brigade; Wu Wenxian, director of the Eighth Route Army驻京Office; Du Yiqian, chief of staff of the headquarters; and dozens of regimental commanders staying in the province. During the meeting, Chen Jitang gave a three-hour speech to the various departments, giving earnest speeches on pacification matters, military training, and military education. They then discussed reducing military expenses, reorganizing troops, pacifying the area, and the Guizhou issue. The division and brigade commanders all expressed their opinions, and the meeting did not end until about 7:00 p.m. The next day (18th) at 9:00 a.m., the headquarters continued to meet. The attendees included the directors of the various departments of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters and senior officers. Only internal issues of the headquarters were discussed that day, and the division and brigade commanders did not attend. Since the meeting on the 17th, the division and brigade commanders have returned to their respective defenses. Only Yu Hanmou, commander of the 59th Division, remained in the province for treatment due to a foot injury. The 63rd Division headquarters and directly subordinate units, such as the engineering company, the transport company, the medical team, the communications team, and the special service battalion, took the Guangdong-Shaoguan train to Shaoguan on the 17th. In addition, the East Jiang officers will also return to their defenses today and tomorrow. It is reported that Li Yangjing, commander of the 63rd Division, is scheduled to go to Beijiang on the 21st to inspect his troops. Jiang Guangnai, commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army, led the officers and soldiers of the 66th and 61st Divisions who had recovered from their injuries to enter Jiangxi, and arrived in Ganzhou on the 13th. People from all walks of life in Ganzhou held a meeting on the 16th to welcome him. It is said that after Mr. Jiang arrived in Ganzhou, he still had to go to Xingguo in the front to inspect, because bandits are still active in various places adjacent to Xingguo and Ganzhou. Cai Tingkai, commander of the 60th Division, is currently commanding everything in the front of Xingguo. The 7th Brigade of the 61st Division has successively dispatched teams to suppress the bandits near Ganzhou. According to a telegram from Hua Zhenzhong, commander of the 7th Brigade, on the 15th, the counties of Meian, Chongyi, Jionghe, etc. have been successively captured by our army, and thousands of prisoners have been cut off, and countless rifles and native guns have been seized. At present, the main roads in all parts of southern Jiangxi can be traveled smoothly. (March 19)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Restores Dime Coin Authentication Association</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the paper currency panic at the Guangdong Provincial Central Bank subsided, the silver industry had another problem with discrimination against dime coins. Since the Guangdong dime coins were re-minted into 20th-year new dime coins, there have been no other types of dime coins on the market. However, the silver shops, having no profit to be made, divided the 20th-year dime coins into three types: new dime coins, selected new dime coins, and old dime coins. When the paper currency panic occurred, the silver shops took the opportunity to push out the old dime coins, and then deliberately depreciated the value of the old dime coins to achieve their manipulation. Therefore, old dime coins or privately minted dime coins suddenly felt abundant on the market, and small vendors and merchants suffered a lot. The authorities, seeing this, believed that this habit was difficult to maintain for a long time, which would disrupt the currency system. On the 17th, the Department of Finance sent letters to the relevant groups in the financial industry to convene a meeting to discuss relief measures. Those who attended that day included Shen Zaihe, president of the Central Bank; Mr. Zhou, representative of the City Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Feng, representative of the Silver Industry Association; Mr. Chen, representative of Zhongxin Hall; Mr. Liang, director of the Central Bank; and Mr. Yu, secretary of the Department of Finance. Fan Qiwu, director of the Department of Finance, chaired the meeting and announced the reasons for the meeting, stating that the current phenomenon of discriminating against dime coins in the market has a great impact on the financial industry. It was found that the discrimination against 13th-year dime coins also occurred the year before last. As a result, a dime coin authentication association was organized to carry out authentication and public judgment. Not long after it was implemented, it subsided. The restoration of the dime coin authentication association was proposed last year, but it was not implemented. Now that the panic has arisen again, the association should be restored for authentication. Everyone unanimously passed the resolution. The organizational methods were then discussed and resolved as follows: The authentication association will be established on March 21. The membership fee will be borne by the representatives of the joining groups, with the amount of funds being 20 yuan per dime coin per month. The funds will be raised by the groups that originally sent representatives. If there are too few joining groups and the funds are insufficient, they can be divided into five shares to raise the funds. It is planned that the New City Chamber of Commerce, Zhongxin Hall, and the Silver Industry Association will each account for one share, and the Guangdong Central Bank will account for two shares. From March 19, the official version of the foot-colored silver dime coin must not be divided into old dime coins, selected new dime coins, or original new dime coins, etc., and premiums must not be charged. For the silver dime coin transactions in the days before the authentication association has not yet been established after the 19th, if the receiving party is unwilling to accept the dime coins, it can register with the authentication association and wait for the authentication association to be established for priority authentication. The Department of Finance will notify the above-mentioned groups of the above resolutions so that they can be separately notified to the various commercial banks for compliance. (March 18)</p>
<h3>Japanese Arrested for Making Counterfeit Coins in Fujian</h3>
<p>Manufacturing Plant in Beiyang Mountain at the Intersection of Fujian and Fuqing</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Recently, many kinds of counterfeit national currency and small gold coins of the Bank of Taiwan have been found in the city. Various shops have suffered a lot due to being mixed in. After receiving the report, the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched detectives to find out that the counterfeit machinery system was located in Beiyang Mountain at the intersection of Minhou and Fuqing outside the jurisdiction. The place is high in mountains and winding roads, densely packed along the way. Dong Lan, the team leader sent to solve the case, summoned the entire class of detectives and selected Shou Zhonghua, Weng Baoming, Xu Fei, and other eight people, led by patrol captain Chen Quan, together with Captain Wu of the First Security Team, leading a team of 40 people, took a small steamer to Kengtian and started ashore. In the misty smoke, they walked 90 miles through the mountains before reaching Beiyang Mountain. Looking up, they saw a factory building on the mountain. The detectives were divided around the surrounding area and climbed up to surround the factory. Lin Erxun, a native of Shanggan Township, and Lin Sanbao, a native of Fuzhu Township, were arrested on the spot, and the citrus bed copper mold and other machinery and materials were seized. The Japanese Consulate General had also learned in advance that Japanese ronin had secretly set up a factory in Fujian to manufacture counterfeit coins, and had consulted the Department of Civil Affairs to order the bureau to investigate. On the same day, the Japanese Consulate also sent police officer Ito Shigeru, leading Japanese police and Taiwanese informants, to join the detectives. However, at that time, the Japanese mastermind of the counterfeiting operation rolled down the mountainside and escaped across the fields. The two people arrested were escorted to the bureau for detention. According to the confession, they were hired by the Japanese to guard the door. All the machines were ordered by the Japanese to be moved and hidden in the mountains when the detectives surrounded and searched them. As for the citrus bed and other items seized, they have now been taken back to the consulate by the Japanese police. (March 20)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Returns to Jinan from Northern Shandong</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Han Fuju inspected Party affairs and politics in northern Shandong, and after visiting Linyi, Shanghe, Huimin, Zhaohua, and Wudi, he returned. His special train arrived in Yucheng at 3:00 a.m. this morning (21st) to welcome Han and boarded the train to Nankai. He arrived in Jinan at 3:30 p.m. After Han got off the train, he talked about the situation of Party affairs and politics in northern Shandong in the lounge, saying that Party affairs in Zhaohua County were not very bad, but only because the Party Department directly handled too many people's cases, which damaged the Party Department's reputation. Ma Danting has been accused and has now fled. Party affairs and politics in other counties can still cooperate. In terms of politics, the county magistrates and courts in most counties are not active enough, and too many cases have been backlogged, with some cases being delayed for several months without a hearing. Linyi and Shanghe are still good. The new organizational law has not been implemented in most counties, and the yamen servants are political police. The new organizational law uses fewer people, and everyone has money to spend. The old yamen servants have many people and very little money. As a result, it is counterproductive. I once asked a guard of a prisoner who only had a monthly salary of two yuan. His food and clothing must come from the prisoners, which is self-evident. The Shanghe political police chief who was escorted to Jinan the other day has been doing it for twenty-five years. In these twenty-five years, I don't know how many people have been harmed, so it must be reorganized and trained. The biggest drawback is that the county magistrate uses the excuse of judicial independence to not care much about things, and the county court uses the excuse that the funds are insufficient and cannot use more people, resulting in the bad reputation of the county courts. Although the provincial capital is good on the surface, it is only a part of the province. The dispute over the beach land in Zhaohua County is because the public cannot manage it, so the big landlords contracted it cheaply and then re-contracted it expensively in sections, making a lot of profit. Those who did not get the money used the excuse of running a militia to collect land rent, led by Xu San (Chen Tiaoyuan once commissioned him to run the militia). Then another group of people supported Wang Weiqi to run the militia to confront Xu San. Wang Weiqi's brother was killed, so Wang Weiqi drove Xu away and called himself the captain of the beach land militia, specializing in revenge. The Party Department was helping the Wang faction, and the Party affairs dispute was also related to this. I have already driven Wang Weiqi away and collected more than 100 guns. The silt land disputes are not only in Zhaohua, but also in Huimin and Wudi. When asked, the locals mostly said that it must be handled by the public. If the garrison farming method is used, the three regiments of people can garrison and farm the land. I have already transferred two regiments of Zhao Xinde's brigade from Dezhou to station in Zhaohua, with one company stationed in each village, to take the new village method to crack down on big landlords. However, this method is temporary, and we must make overall plans in the future. In short, the new organizational law must be implemented to reduce the suffering of the people. After Han finished speaking, he returned to headquarters to rest. (March 21)</p>
<h3>Appeal from Qingdao's Native Produce Merchants</h3>
<p>Due to the Collection of Inland Inspection Fees by the Commodity Inspection Bureau</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau used to collect inspection fees for all native products sold at home and abroad. The industry association of the city's transit stations believed that the inspection bureaus in Shanghai and Tianjin did not charge fees for native products sold domestically, while Qingdao was the only city that charged inspection fees, which was too burdensome, and the native product industry was greatly affected. Therefore, in January of this year, they separately submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Party and government organs of the city. It was not until the 23rd of last month that the Commodity Inspection Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to exempt all non-export commodities from inspection fees, except for cotton that was thoroughly inspected. The native product merchants thought that the commercial difficulties had been slightly relieved, and they celebrated with their hands on their foreheads. Unexpectedly, the bureau received another telegram from the ministry that afternoon, stating that inspection fees would still be charged for peanuts and peanut oil, regardless of whether they were exported or sold domestically. The native product merchants heard the news and were panicked. They all thought that the government's orders changed in the morning and evening, and there was nothing to follow. Moreover, the domestic sales of native products in the city are mainly peanuts and peanut oil. If the two items still need to be inspected and charged, it is tantamount to sentencing the merchants to death. Therefore, they negotiated with the Inspection Bureau to give them a period of hesitation, and at the same time, they telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to exempt the two inspection fees. Recently, the Commodity Inspection Bureau announced on the 16th that it would implement the collection of inspection fees. The native product merchants believed that there was no room for maneuver in the official office. They have been meeting in recent days to discuss countermeasures and decided to temporarily suspend transportation until the matter is resolved. Today, Yu Weiting, Zhang Yutian, Liang Hepu, and Liu Wenting, members of the City Chamber of Commerce, along with Zhang Lvzhu and Shen Ziyi, representatives of the transit station association, went to the Party and government organs to request relief. Both the Party and government agreed to forward the request to the central government for instructions. According to those familiar with the commercial situation, the city's domestic sales of peanut rice and oil are the best in various ports. Peanut rice exports are about 3.5 million dan per year (oil details are not known). The inspection fee for peanut rice is five cents per dan, and the inspection fee for peanut oil is nine cents per dan, with an estimated annual amount of tens of thousands of yuan. The merchant's burden is too heavy. If the authorities do not agree to exempt the fee, they will be forced to transport to Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Qingdao's commerce will plummet, and the port bureau's income will also be greatly reduced. Therefore, this matter not only has a heavy impact on exporters, but also has a great relationship with Qingdao's prosperity. (March 20)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>County Administration Meeting Minutes The County Government held its 100th county administration meeting yesterday, presided over by County Magistrate Jin. Matters discussed: (1) Regarding the Education Department's order to continue running public schools, how should it be handled? It was resolved that the four bureaus of the County Government should continue to jointly manage them, and the Education Bureau should plan and determine all matters related to funding and educational affairs, and submit them to the next meeting for discussion. (2) The wounded soldiers in the city have all left Songjiang the day before yesterday, but it is inevitable that some will stay in the territory privately, causing trouble. How should this be investigated? It was resolved that the Public Security Bureau's police team, together with the First District Office, should conduct a thorough household-by-household investigation. If any wounded soldiers or suspicious persons are found staying, they should be taken to the County Government for disposal. Residents who harbor them should issue a guarantee that they will no longer harbor them, otherwise they will be detained and dealt with. The County Government will issue a public notice in advance. (3) The Public Security Bureau proposed sending police trainees to the province. If no subsidies have been given, can subsidies be considered? It was resolved that a one-time subsidy of three yuan per person should be granted according to the list submitted, and paid from the surplus of prohibited fines. (4) The Construction Bureau proposed disposing of the Xiyuecheng base. In accordance with orders to plan separately, should the original price paid by Gu Shaolian and the other four who contracted the base be refunded? It was resolved that the County Government should order the Construction Bureau to refund it uniformly.</p>
<p>County Government Submits National Assembly Roster After the County Government was ordered to handle the election of representatives to the National Assembly, it immediately ordered the relevant departments to expedite preparations for various election matters so that they could be reported on schedule. All local legal entities in the county, except for the Youth Association, Women's Association, and Farmers' Association, which are still being established, the County Chamber of Commerce, the Si Jing and Xin Zhuang Chambers of Commerce, the County Education Association, etc., have all prepared rosters and submitted them to the county for reporting. The Lawyers' Association, as a free professional group, should also prepare and submit a roster, but it is reported that the local Lawyers' Association has not yet prepared its roster.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Appeal in Abduction Case Scheduled for Sentencing On the Fujian Maru, a steamship traveling from Shanghai to Fuzhou, on the evening of January 11 of this year, detective Lin Yongfang discovered four Fujian women, Lin Liu Shi, Huang Zhenfang, Lin Yijiao, and Ren Chengwu, suspected of abducting Zhao Chen Shi (19 years old), Tan Xialan (15 years old), and a young child, Xiao Didi (6 years old). They were handed over to the Shanghai District Court for trial. On February 31, Lin Liu Shi was sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment, while Huang Zhenfang, Lin Yijiao, and Ren Chengwu were each sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. All defendants were dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (the 23rd), the Second Criminal Division of the High Court held a hearing and announced the end of the debate, scheduling the sentencing for the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>Extension of Joint Defense Period The four counties of Wuxian, Kunshan, Qingpu, and Wujiang previously organized a joint defense command in accordance with orders from the Civil Affairs Department. The four-month period has now expired. Because the lake bandits in various areas have not yet been completely eliminated, a meeting was held in Suzhou on the 22nd and it was resolved to extend the joint defense period for the four counties, continue to issue passwords, and hold monthly meetings in Suzhou thereafter.</p>
<p>Compilation of Robbery Cases The families of Yin Nongmin, Qiu Genbao, Lu Xiaoquan, Lu Ruixing, Zhang Changqing, and others were robbed of more than 1,000 silver dollars on the night of the 23rd by more than ten robbers. Also, the home of Zhu Genbao, near the Yushen Temple, was robbed of over 100 yuan at the same time. The homes of Shen Genjin, Shen Xiangji, and Shen Maogou in Hejia Village, Huguan, and the home of Jin Zikang in Huangdai Xiaofangjiao were also robbed by bandits that night.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Countywide Strike by Stoneworkers There are more than twenty stoneworking businesses in the county, employing approximately three hundred workers. The wages are currently 4 jiao and 7 fen per day. Last year, wages were increased to 5 jiao once. This year, the workers in this industry believe that the cost of living has continued to rise, but wages have not increased accordingly, so they have gathered to discuss the need for an increase of 8 fen (i.e., 5 jiao and 8 fen per day). Repeated requests to the employers have not received a definite response. The workers in this industry, dissatisfied with their demands not being met, decided to resort to a strike. They went on strike on the 21st. The industry association convened a meeting of labor and management to mediate, but no satisfactory results were achieved. The employers all adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the workers also expressed their determination not to return to work until their goals were achieved.</p>
<p>Resisting Arrest for Opium Possession at Luoxia Bridge Zhou Jiashan, head of the Eighth Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau in the Third District of Xishu (Yangming Township), received a report from a Mr. Fan the other day, stating that Zhang Fengquan, a villager in Luoxia Bridge, Xin'an Township, was privately selling opium. He requested that a team be dispatched to arrest him as soon as possible. Upon receiving the report, Director Zhou dispatched bureau staff member Cao Xia, leading fourteen police officers, along with the informant, to investigate and arrest him. On the spot, they arrested Zhang Fengquan, the owner of the opium den, and two opium smokers, and seized evidence such as opium lamps and opium pipes. Just as they were taking them to the bureau, dozens of villagers forcibly rescued the three opium offenders. Afterwards, staff member Cao immediately returned to the bureau to report to Director Zhou. Upon receiving the report, Director Zhou submitted a report to the general bureau yesterday for investigation.</p>
<p>Dispute over Deposits at Ding Shuangsheng Silk Store The Ding Shuangsheng Silk Store, located on Dashiqiao Street in the city, is solely owned by Ding Hesheng. Its business has been relatively prosperous over the years. However, Ding Hesheng and his elder brother, Xingchu, are both involved in the silk cocoon business, so their credit with the outside world is good. As a result, the total deposits from various households are around 100,000 yuan. Last year, due to the disastrous fall in silk prices, the Ding brothers suffered some losses, which affected the store's business. Depositors rushed to withdraw their deposits, and the silk store was unable to meet the demand, leading to disputes. Yesterday, Qian Sunqing, the president of the county chamber of commerce, acted as mediator and convened a meeting of 58 male and female creditor representatives to mediate. It was resolved to organize a creditor committee to first verify the accounts and goods, and then negotiate the withdrawal of deposits.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Three Robbers Arrested in Robbery in the Sixth District On the evening of the 21st, at around 7:00 PM, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Fei Ziming in Majiagou, Tangshu Township, on the east side of Luoyang Town, in the Sixth District of Wu County. They tied up Xiang Ziming, beat him, and shot him in the leg. Then they looted valuables and fled. Villagers and the Luoyang defense corps gathered and immediately pursued them. Gunfire was exchanged between the two sides. As a result, three bandits, Zhu Aren, Zhi Xilin, and Zhu Sanda, were captured. A five-shot revolver was found on Zhu Aren, along with five spent cartridges and three clothing bags. The captured bandits and the pistol were handed over to the County Police for investigation on the 22nd, along with the belongings which were returned to the owner.</p>
<p>Establishment Meeting of Physicians Association The Wuyi Physicians Association convened an establishment meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd. Physicians and party officials attended. First, the articles of association were revised, and then officials were elected. As a result, Huang [name missing], Chen Shunming, Xu Yuanheng, Jiang Shuzhong, and Wang Songyuan were elected as directors, and Wang Wanbai and Gao Keren were elected as alternate directors. Chen Shunming was elected as the managing director. They were then sworn in and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Liang Guanying to Inspect Nantong Liang Guanying, commander of the 25th Route Army, is scheduled to arrive in Nantong on the 26th with Zhao Jianxun, commander of the 94th Brigade, to inspect the garrison. Regiment Commander Shi Dexue went to Yangzhou on the 22nd to welcome them.</p>
<p>Urging Reorganization of the County Defense Corps Because of the banditry, the defense corps in each district of Nantong were previously approved by the provincial government to be temporarily reorganized by conscripting soldiers. The Civil Affairs Department's Security Office recently sent a telegram to the County Government urging the use of a conscription system to dismiss the temporarily organized soldiers. County Magistrate Zhang ordered each district to reorganize and appointed Chen Jin and Tao Junsan to supervise the reorganization.</p>
<p>Preparing to Dredge Rivers and Build Roads with Soldiers The Provincial Government's Pacification Supervisory Office approved the request from representatives of various counties in Jiangbei to allocate Liang Guanying's troops to dredge the Fu Ning to Lvsi Canal and build roads using the existing coastal dikes. Chairman Ye and Supervisor Zhang agreed that this military construction should not hinder pacification. They are currently discussing methods and will convene representatives from relevant counties in Jiangbei to hold a meeting.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Construction Department Restricts Forced Levies The Provincial Construction Department believes that the implementation of various central and local taxes, the granting of exclusive rights for internal and external monopolies, and other special interests are related to national planning and the people's livelihood. They often have a significant impact from the beginning. Therefore, it specially instructed all counties that in the future, all compulsory levies on the people by the central and local governments, whether they are taxes, donations, fees, or other items, and all business plans or contracts containing exclusive, monopolistic, or other special interests, whether they are government-run, commercial-run, or jointly run, should not be established or abolished unless they arise from the execution of the law. The establishment and abolition must first be decided in principle by the Central Political Conference and the content must be reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Bandit Den Busted Near the Train Station At around 9:00 PM last night, the Sixth Section of the Train Station Police Department received a telegram from the Danyang Station police stating that the widow Bei, located in a shed west of the station, was engaging in immoral behavior and colluding with bandits, and requested that police be dispatched to search the premises. Upon receiving the report, the section reported to the police team, which dispatched police to search the premises. They found two box cannons, fifteen rounds of ammunition, and two bandits, along with Bei, and took them all to the team for questioning.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Liang Guanying Arrives in Yangzhou for Review Liang Guanying, commander of the 25th Route Army for the suppression of rebellion, arrived in Yangzhou yesterday (the 20th) from Qingjiangpu to review the troops under his command. Those who accompanied Liang to Yangzhou included Chief of Staff Hao Pengju and more than 80 guards. This morning (the 21st) at 7:00 AM, he reviewed the troops of the entire 94th Brigade stationed in Yangzhou at the Yangzhou training ground. In the evening, he summoned all the brigade officers at the Sino-Western Hotel for a speech, the main points of which were as follows: (1) During the bandit suppression period, the various units were scattered in different places, so they could not meet often. Now that the large bandit groups in the Huaihai and Tonghai areas have been eliminated, he is taking this opportunity to inspect everything in various places. (2) Now that the counties are rushing to carry out rural purification, the army should assist in every way possible at any time. (3) The army should use its strength to help develop local afforestation, road construction, and all other undertakings. (4) Although the bandits in the Jiangbei area have been gradually eliminated, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no small number of remnants who intend to lure the army. He hopes that everyone will pay attention at all times and must eliminate evil completely. (5) Because the troops were in the bandit suppression period, he feared that they could not fully know the news from the central government, so he will report in detail the recent situation of the central government. He hopes that everyone will recognize the central government and swear to defend the central government and support Commander-in-Chief Chiang. (6) No matter how people do things, they cannot be hypocritical, especially soldiers. It is very important. It is heard that after Liang finishes his official business in Yangzhou, he will go to the Tongru area to inspect the situation of his troops, and then return to Yangzhou to wait for Supervisor Zhang to return to Yangzhou from the north to ask for instructions on everything.</p>
<p>Shaobo Villagers Come to the City to Petition The villagers of Tianmu'an, north of Shaobo, on the Yangzhou-You segment of the provincial Guayu Road, have gathered to prevent road construction. All the details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the female villagers in the seventh and eighth sections of the Huaiziqiao, south of Shaobo, also staged a mass riot to prevent road construction and set fire to the house of section chief Li. Yesterday, more than 50 villagers from that section came to the city to petition the county government. County Magistrate Chen ordered that four representatives be mutually elected to meet with him in the yamen to inquire about the purpose of the petition. According to them, no matter what, they requested that the government allow them not to use the fields, houses, and graves in that area, and there would be no problem with road construction. County Magistrate Chen immediately used gentle words to persuade them, asking everyone to go back to work first. As for the use of fields, houses, and graves, the government has its own regulations to give a corresponding price. He urged everyone to go back and do their best to publicize to other villagers and not to let any more riots occur. The villagers all felt satisfied and returned, but to this day (the 12th), the north and south sections of the project have not resumed work, while the other sections are working as usual. It is also heard that in addition to submitting a document to the Construction Department requesting instructions, the director of the bureau, Yu Dingming, plans to cross the river tomorrow morning to meet with Sun, the director of the Construction Department, to ask for a solution.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Liang Scheduled to Marry Commander-in-Chief Liang Guanying of the 25th Route Army originally planned to marry Ms. Song Yuhua of Tianjin in Yangzhou a few days ago. However, due to the busy work of suppressing bandits, although the woman's family has been in Yangzhou for many days, he has not had time to marry her. It is now heard that Liang will hold a wedding in a newly rented house in Bi Yaqi's house after he inspects the Tongru troops and returns to Yangzhou.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Police Team Kills Bandits The leader of the Second Squad of the Fifth Ward Police in Huaiyin, Deng Jian, recently received information that bandits were active in the Lutantan area of the Fourth Ward of this county. On the morning of the 17th, he led his squad to the area to search for them. When they encountered the bandits, they immediately attempted to arrest them. The bandits resisted and a firefight ensued for about an hour. The bandits were overwhelmed and retreated north. Deng led his squad in pursuit, killing two bandits, Lu Jiankang and Lu Changmei. The police team seized a pistol from the bandits. The remaining bandits fled into Siyang.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Severe Epidemic in Four Villages A severe epidemic has been prevalent in the four villages of Xiaoshan recently. The number of deaths in the southeast villages has reached several hundred. In the western village of Changhe, a son in the Yu family died of the epidemic, and his elderly father, grieving over his son's untimely death, threw himself into the Qiantang River. On the morning of the 19th, his body floated to the surface of the river. On the 21st, four members of the Zhou family in Zhoujiawu were infected with the epidemic at the same time. Two of them died at night, and the remaining two, who were slightly older, were also in critical condition.</p>

<p>Leaders from All Walks of Life Initiate Fundraising</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital opened on March 1st, it has organized 48 teams in this city to solicit donations. They have been working hard for two weeks, and the results have been quite impressive. Deputy Chief Sun Ke has already taken on the responsibility of raising funds to construct the main building, estimated at 75,000 taels of silver. The first floor of the main building will house the administrative offices, doctors' offices, and library. The second floor will house the major and minor operating rooms, the delivery room, and the ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and rhinology operating rooms. This is the most important building in the hospital. Team leader Song Ziwen has taken on the responsibility of raising funds for the nurses' school building, estimated at 60,000 taels of silver. It is said that the two individuals, in addition to their existing responsibilities, are still working hard to solicit donations, and the results will be even more impressive in the future. In addition, a certain prominent businessman has personally donated a ward specifically for the treatment of neurological diseases, estimated at 53,000 taels of silver.

All donations have been deposited into the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and the amount is already considerable. Other teams are also actively raising funds, and an official report will be made soon.</p>

<p>China-Japan, China-Siam, and China-Saigon Communications Proving to Be Excellent</p>
<p>China-England and China-Russia Communications Are in Progress</p>
<p>The International Wireless Radio Station built by the Ministry of Communications in Zhenru, Shanghai, was originally intended to communicate directly with the United States, Germany, and France in sequence. Since the official communication with the United States began, the results have been excellent, and the radio service is developing day by day. The China-Germany radio machine has undergone considerable testing and has already been directly connected. However, the formal communication ceremony will be announced after approval by the Ministry of Communications. Direct communication with France is being tested, and the results are also good. Direct communication with Japan, Siam, and Saigon has been tested multiple times recently. The results of China-Japan communication are best with Tokyo, followed by Nagoya, and then Kobe. There is a great possibility of communication with Siam. Saigon was previously a relay point for China-France communication. After direct communication between China and France, this point will become an independent line. However, formal communication with all of the above locations must wait until the Ministry of Communications concludes agreements with the listed countries. As for the direct communication with England, the opinion of Mr. Maconochie, the British representative in Shanghai, was recently sought. He expressed that, in fact, direct communication between China and England is necessary and possible. However, for prudent radio service, it is necessary to purchase British wireless radio machines before agreeing. According to the value of British radio machines and the cost of installation, etc., all expenses would be more than one million yuan. According to the existing capacity of the Zhenru Radio Station, it is possible to communicate with England and Russia without adding additional radio machines. Therefore, this matter is still under consideration by the Ministry of Communications. In the future, the scope of international wireless radio communication will encompass China, the United States, Germany, France, Japan, Siam, Saigon, England, and Russia. With the exception of Africa, it will be possible to communicate with almost the entire world. The Ministry of Communications and radio personnel have prepared for its future development.</p>
<h3>Municipal Election Office Announces Deadline for Submitting Registration Books</h3>
<p>Failure to Submit by Deadline Will Be Deemed a Waiver of the Right to Vote</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Election Office for National Assembly Representatives issued Announcement No. 4 yesterday, which reads as follows: This announcement concerns the election of representatives to the National Assembly. All relevant organizations in this municipality should use the registration forms that have been prepared and issued by this office to fill out and submit the registration forms within three days of receiving them, so that they can be reviewed and filed. According to the membership lists of teachers, staff, and students sent by various organizations and schools, the names are still not arranged in order according to the number of strokes in the surnames. The review has been difficult. As the election time is approaching, the period for various organizations and schools to create registration books cannot be extended again, as it would delay the election. This is a further announcement to all people's organizations to submit the election registration books to the office by 5:00 PM on the 26th of this month. The membership lists must still be arranged in order according to the number of strokes in the same surnames. Late submissions will not be accepted and will be deemed a waiver of the right to vote. Do not make a mistake. This is a special announcement.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Welcome the King of Siam</h3>
<p>To Pass Through Shanghai on April 3rd</p>
<p>Preparing a Boat to View the Scenery</p>
<p>The King of Siam has been approved to pass through Shanghai on April 3rd to go to the United States. It was originally planned to prepare a grand welcome. Because the King of Siam will pass through Shanghai without landing, the order of the welcome will be slightly changed, but the etiquette will still be very grand. Yesterday morning, Mr. Sen Biti Tie, the Siamese minister to Japan, visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Foreign Affairs Office outside of Fenglin Bridge. Wang then discussed the welcome arrangements with the national government. It is heard that it has been decided that on the day the King of Siam passes through Shanghai, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will request the Navy Department to specially dispatch a warship. Foreign Minister Wang, representing Chairman Chiang, along with Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun and the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Liu Yunfang, and two others, will take the ship directly to the Japanese Empress liner, which is moored at the Songkou, to pay respects to the King and Queen of Siam. At the same time, the ship will fire a salute to show respect. Foreign Minister Wang instructed Liu Yunfang yesterday morning to prepare everything, and discussed with Director-General May of the Customs to use the most beautiful customs steamer to allow the King and Queen of Siam to take a boat trip to view the scenery of the Huangpu River. He also ordered Liu to prepare high-quality domestic gifts in the name of the national government, Chairman Chiang, and his wife to present to the King and Queen of Siam.</p>
<h3>Yu Shun Steamer Runs Aground in Canton and Is Rescued</h3>
<p>Has Already Left Canton and Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Overloaded Cargo</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yu Shun steamer was dispatched to Canton to load cargo this time. When it departed from Canton, the ship was carrying a large amount of sugarcane, more than 15,000 pieces, and more than 1,200 pieces of general cargo. The weight of the sugarcane was extremely large. After being loaded onto the ship, the draft of the ship became very deep. When the ship departed from the White Goose Pond in Canton Province to the Guangdong Port, the tide happened to be low, so it ran aground. The ship's body could not move and could not get out of the shallows. The ship's owner telegraphed Canton for help and telegraphed the Shanghai Bureau.</p>
<p>Discharging Cargo</p>
<p>After receiving the Yu Shun steamer's radio report, the Guangdong Branch discussed it with the Port Authority and immediately dispatched twenty-two barges and tugboats, as well as small workers, to sail to the outer port to help rescue it. However, because the tide was low and there was too much cargo, it was difficult to tow it for a while. They began to unload the cargo and sugarcane from the cabins onto the small boats to reduce the weight. The Yu Shun steamer finally floated out of the sea. Fortunately, the ship's hull was not damaged.</p>
<p>Escaping Danger and Returning to Shanghai Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau received a telegram from the Guangdong Branch stating that the Yu Shun steamer had been towed out of the shallows after the cargo had been discharged by the tugboats and barges. It had left Guangdong yesterday and was returning to Shanghai. As for the unloaded cargo, it will be transported to Shanghai on the Guangli steamer.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Special News</h3>
<p>Silver Ingots to Be Transported to India</p>
<p>Shanghai is suffering from a surplus of silver. Last month, many batches of silver ingots were loaded and transported to India. It has now been confirmed that a certain foreign bank in this city is about to transport another large batch of silver ingots, estimated at more than two million taels, to India. Yesterday, the bank inquired about ship schedules and it is heard that it has been arranged with a certain shipping company to transport them to Calcutta. The formalities for transportation will be reported as soon as there is a ship departing for India.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger Fares Alliance The passenger fares alliance of the Shanghai-Ningbo four companies' Sanhua liners have increased prices because of the addition of escort teams. The Taikoo Company is still going its own way and has not increased prices. Yesterday, the Ningbo-Shaoxing and other bureaus sent a letter to the Taikoo Company requesting that the passenger fares of the four companies also form an alliance from April 1st to avoid discrepancies. Representatives will be sent to discuss this matter immediately.</p>
<p>Jihe Discovers Smuggled Opium</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was heard that the Jardine Matheson Company's Yangtze River ship, Jihe, was coming to Shanghai from Hankou. When it arrived at the mouth of Wusong, inspectors boarded the ship to search it and found a large amount of opium that had been smuggled to Shanghai, totaling twelve sacks. The quantity was extremely large. It is heard that the opium has been confiscated, but the crew members are still denying it because the person who carried the opium has not been found.</p>
<p>Taikoo's New Steamer Completed</p>
<p>For the purpose of developing the Nanyang Islands to compete for business with overseas Chinese, the Taikoo Company has opened four K-class ships for routes from Xiamen and Shantou to Bangkok, Siam. It has also opened special lines for ships such as the Guiyang and Qiongzhou to Singapore, Haikou, and Hanoi. It has dispatched four ships, Anhui, Andong, Guangdong, etc., to Haiphong, Beihai, and Singapore. The most overseas Chinese travel on these three lines. The company has made huge profits since the lines opened. Now, the newly built giant ship, Anking (the company's Yangtze River ship also has a ship named Anqing, but the Western name is Nganking), has been completed and is specially dispatched from Xiamen and Shantou to Little Luzon. Yesterday, the company notified various passenger brokers in this city that cargo from Shanghai to Fiji and passengers to Manila can connect to the company's Shanghai-Hong Kong liners. They depart every ten days.</p>
<h3>Fang Jiao Bo Discusses Why the Banking Law Does Not Apply to the Money Shop Industry</h3>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan passed the Banking Law, the Shanghai Money Shop Guild has petitioned for the separate drafting of a Money Shop Law. This issue has attracted much attention from the business community. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically visited Fang Jiao Bo, director of the General Affairs Department of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, to inquire about his views on this matter. According to Mr. Fang's response, in his humble opinion, the preliminary question for separately drafting a Money Shop Law is whether the business operations of banks and money shops are the same. If it is deemed that their business operations are the same, then the Bank Guild and the Money Shop Guild should also merge, because according to the Industry Guild Law, two guilds with the same business operations cannot be established in the same area. If it is deemed that banks and money shops are not the same type of business and can each establish their own guild, then the Banking Law naturally does not include money shops, and the Banking Law does not apply to money shops, so a separate Money Shop Law should be drafted as a basis. If, in terms of special laws prevailing over general laws, the Banking Law is a special law and the Industry Guild Law is a general law, then the nature and customs of banks and money shops should be further studied as standards for legislation. The banking system in our country is modeled after foreign countries, while money shops have a long history. Banks are only established in major cities, while money shops are established everywhere. Banks mostly have limited liability organizations, while money shops are all partnerships. Bank deposits have fixed terms, while money shops do not. Bank loans focus on mortgages and guarantees, while money shops rely more on credit. The two each have different points. In terms of customs, banks and money shops each have long-standing customs that are not entirely based on fixed rules. Legislation should take customs as the most important thing, because the so-called customs must be good to last, and must be widespread to be applicable. Since it has become a custom, sudden reforms will affect everything and immediately cause obstacles, and the result will be that it cannot be implemented. Therefore, at a minimum, if it is difficult to separately draft a Money Shop Law, then the Banking Law should urgently adopt the opinions of the national financial community and be amended accordingly, and so on.</p>

<h3>A Large Batch of Military Supplies, Strangely and Awfully, Sinks into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Confiscated by the Garrison Headquarters Detective Team</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, on the 28th of last month, the detective team of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters learned that a large batch of military supplies was being smuggled into Shanghai on a foreign ship. The team immediately dispatched multiple detectives and soldiers on a steamship to Wusong to patrol strictly, waiting. At around 4:00 a.m. the next morning, a French merchant ship was seen breaking through the waves. However, when passing near the Water and Electricity Company, it suddenly dropped several oilcloth packages into the water. Upon seeing this, the detectives and soldiers knew that something was amiss and immediately steered the ship to the area to prepare to retrieve the packages to investigate. At this time, several people on the shore were also patrolling the area, watching the water, looking particularly anxious. The detectives believed that since it was still early in the morning, these people would not be lingering there unless they had something to do. If their purpose was not related to the packages dropped by the foreign ship, then why would they be watching the water so frequently? Therefore, they immediately ordered the small ship to dock and land to arrest them. Unexpectedly, these people were also extremely alert and ran away before the soldiers could land. They were chased, but since the case was not yet clear, it was inconvenient to open fire, so only one person was captured. According to the confession, they were there to receive the packages that had sunk into the water. Subsequently, the detectives hired a fishing boat to retrieve six packages from the Huangpu River, containing a total of 190 handguns and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. The people and the loot were taken to the Baiyun Temple Detective Team. The team believed that smuggling military supplies would inevitably lead to their resale to bandits and communists, which would disrupt social order and stability. This was extremely hateful. However, their organization was so secretive that it was difficult to eradicate its roots without absolute secrecy and thorough investigation. Therefore, the outside world has known little about this case until now. It is now learned that the team has obtained considerable results in the investigation of this case, so they have submitted the details of the case, along with the people and the loot, to the Longhua Headquarters for review.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Orders Social Affairs Bureau to Investigate the Sale of the Sanxin Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>Results of Negotiations Between Labor and Management</p>
<p>Since the Sanxin Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road announced its sale, all employees have refused to hand over the factory due to unresolved issues related to the aftermath, which has lasted for many days. Labor and management have conducted their own negotiations, but no concrete solutions have been reached. Since the factory announced its closure, employees have become even more panicked and have petitioned the authorities, requesting that they take measures to provide relief. Yesterday, the Municipal Government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "Regarding the case of the Sanxin Cotton Textile Industry Union in the Third Special District petitioning for relief and requesting the provision of severance pay due to the announcement of the sale of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, enclosed is a copy of the petition. The bureau is hereby instructed to investigate and handle the matter and report back."</p>
<h3>News on the Huainan Salt Reclamation</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Jian's plan for Huainan salt reclamation, which aimed to prevent leakage of resources and cultivate people's livelihood, has suffered from banditry and tenant unrest in recent years, leading to a sharp decline in rent collection and stagnation of projects. Not only are interest payments unsecured, but even the principal and operating expenses of creditors are difficult to cover, and the sick man is struggling to survive. Recently, both the national and provincial governments have become aware of this. It is believed that such beneficial measures for people's livelihood should not be allowed to disappear. People in industrial and financial circles who care about people's suffering also believe that, at a time of high gold prices and cotton shortages, this matter has research value. Therefore, a Huainan Salt Reclamation Project Design Research Association has been initiated, with Meng Xinshi and Zhang Peiyan tasked with collecting difficulties and facts as much as possible to provide research. The Association's origins and brief articles are listed below:</p>
<p>Origins: Huainan is a coastal area, about 600 li from north to south and about 60 to 70 li from east to west. Since ancient times, it has been known for accumulating grass and boiling salt, benefiting the entire country. In recent times, grass has become expensive, and the brine is weak, making salt production increasingly difficult. Gradually, salt boiling has been reduced and land has been reclaimed to harness the beauty of nature and expand the livelihood of coastal residents. The initiator was Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong, who first developed the Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry, and then expanded it to increase national production and enrich the people's livelihood. For a time, many responded, and dozens of companies were initiated, raising a total of several million yuan. At that time, the efforts were appreciated by the court and trusted by society, with a surge of enthusiasm. Before the great cause was half completed, Mr. Zhang passed away, and the political situation changed. Doubts and slanders arose, and those who sought to interfere took the opportunity to spread unfounded rumors. (Omission)... Therefore, people with common views have joined this association, taking the entire coastal area of Huainan as the scope (of which only about a quarter has been used to establish companies). The overall plan first reveals its natural quality and human affairs, based on the case as a basis, hoping that both the government and the public will fully understand the truth, and then the government and the public will discuss the remedy. We are responsible for knowing and not speaking. All my colleagues who have the same opinions will join this association to make a small effort for the country and society in order to make a small contribution.</p>
<p>Brief Articles: Article 1: This association is named the Huainan Salt Reclamation Project Design Research Association. Article 2: Members of this association are qualified if they are familiar with the contents of the salt reclamation project and share the purpose of design, regardless of the number of people. Article 3: This association borrows the Dasheng Shanghai Office as its office to handle the collection of opinions, investigation, and editing matters, all of which are voluntary and unpaid. Article 4: Members of this association are responsible for providing salt reclamation materials and do not pay membership fees. Article 5: This association will temporarily be initiated by the first initiators to reveal the purpose and call on like-minded people to join the initiation. After gathering a large number of people, a formal conference will be held and investigators and editors will be elected. Currently, the first initiators will first take on the matters to be handled and leave them to be reported to the formal meeting. Article 6: The duty of this association is to submit a report to the government to seek its understanding of the true situation of the salt reclamation project and to naturally generate its love for the salt reclamation project. The duty will end when the salt reclamation project is understood. Article 7: The matters to be handled by this association will be publicly discussed and determined in detail at the formal meeting.</p>
<h3>Trainees from the Local Autonomy Training Institute Will Leave for Beijing and Provinces Tonight for Observation</h3>
<p>The first class of trainees from the Local Autonomy Training Institute in this city has completed their studies and passed the examinations. It is scheduled to visit the capital and Zhenjiang this week.

It is learned that all the trainees will take the overnight express train to Beijing tonight. Their itinerary is as follows: Depart from Shanghai at 11:00 p.m. on the 24th and arrive in Beijing at 7:00 a.m. on the 25th.

<h3>Continued News of Yang Shengzhi's Death</h3>
<p>Yang Shengzhi, the newly appointed commander of the Second Division and former commander of the Tenth Division, passed away in Shanghai the other day. His son, Xiuqian, has published an obituary in the newspaper and organized a funeral office. The office received a telegram from Commander Gu from Beijing yesterday, briefly stating: "I was saddened to hear of the passing of your father, who died for the country. I have received an order from the Commander-in-Chief to send 5,000 yuan for funeral expenses and to send personnel to Shanghai to offer condolences. This is to inform you in advance."</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Ship Crew Negotiates Compensation with Company Yesterday</h3>
<p>Four Representatives are Elected to Negotiate</p>
<p>Three Conditions are Proposed, and the Result is Satisfactory</p>
<p>The fifty-six crew members of the French merchant ship Yangtze River, which suffered a disaster, have been residing in the Songshan Road Police Station for four days. The company has been using the shipping agent as an excuse to avoid dealing with compensation and temporary relief matters. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., over thirty crew members of Guangdong and Zhejiang descent walked to the Shanghai</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Seamen's Union on Qiujiang Road to request assistance in negotiating compensation with the company. Secretary Liu Yuzhou received them, deeply comforted them, and ordered the election of representatives. Then, the Seamen's Union sent personnel to formally negotiate with the company. The crew members then elected Ling Hong, Lin Xiong, Huang Yaonan, and Cai Cheng as representatives to follow Li Zuyao, a representative of the Seamen's Union, to Lai Cheng Coal Company at 844 Miller Road, Hongkou, for negotiations, because Lai Cheng Coal Company is the Shanghai office of the Haifang Coal Mine of the shipping agent Xu Minya. Subsequently, Cai Jingbo, a representative of Lai Cheng Coal Company, met with the representatives. The representatives then proposed three conditions: (1) Punish the shipowner, the legal person Croshy, because (a) the shipowner should not have rung the bell and quickly reversed the ship when the Yangtze River hit the reef, causing the ship to sink in more than twenty minutes. Otherwise, the fourteen passengers and crew members would not have drowned, and the luggage and money of each person could have been salvaged. (b) After hitting the reef, the two compradors, Ling Hong, repeatedly asked the shipowner to order the sending of a radio distress call, but the shipowner ignored it, so no ship came to rescue them. (2) The company should issue temporary relief funds to the crew members. (3) The company should compensate the crew members for their losses, and provide additional compensation for the deceased. The company's response was: (1) The principle of punishing the shipowner is accepted, but Shanghai has no right to deal with it and it must be handled by the Haifang Shipping Industry. (2) Temporary relief funds will be paid to the crew members first, 15 yuan per person. (3) Loss compensation will be handled in accordance with the Maritime Regulations, etc. The representatives considered this satisfactory and reported back to the Seamen's Union for review.</p>
<h3>Two Documents from the Shipping Guild</h3>
<p>Telegram to Commanders-in-Chief Jiang and Zhang</p>
<p>Request to Send Military Police for Protection: The Shipping Guild sent a telegram yesterday to Commander-in-Chief Jiang and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang, requesting that military police be sent to protect merchant ships on the Shanghai-Hankou route and ordering military and police agencies in various ports along the river to send teams to assist in case of incidents. The document stated: "Respectfully submitted, merchant ships of our country traveling on the Shanghai-Hankou route have repeatedly suffered from the pain of ruffians and soldiers freely boarding and causing trouble at any time. We humbly propose protective measures and earnestly request approval and instruction to maintain the shipping industry and ensure the safety of the people. The guild has learned from the business directors of various steamships such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company that domestic steamships with fixed schedules traveling on the Shanghai-Hankou route include the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an, Jiangxin, Jiang'an, Jiangjing, Jiangshun, Jiangda, Jiangtian, Jiangyu, and Jianguo ships. The Sanbei Company has Changxing, Dexing, Changan, Fulong, Jishi, Fengpu, Xinningxing, Minghe, and Wanyu ships. The Ningshao Company has Ningshao and Yongxing ships. Although the above ships carry both cargo and passengers, passenger ships are actually the main source of income. During repeated military operations, in addition to renting the entire ship for military transportation regardless of cost, even those who still operated normally at that time, encountered the transport of troops being transferred and the boarding of new recruits and wounded soldiers, as well as the travel of officers and soldiers, most of them did not pay half price and were subjected to donations. Although the losses were very heavy, it was not dared to be ignored during the military affairs. It was hoped that the war would end, the overall situation would be pacified, and business would be restored to make up for the losses. Unexpectedly, since last year, every time the above-mentioned steamships passed through various ports, there would be ruffians dressed in military uniforms or wearing military badges who would board the ships. They not only did not buy tickets or pay for meals, but also used gambling to lure passengers, bullied crew members, and caused trouble. No matter which class it was, there was no exception. In advance, they would not accept inquiries, and in case of trouble, they would not allow intervention, and afterwards, they would not accept punishment, which led to increasing imitation and deeper suffering. Various facts are too numerous to list. For example, on the 11th of this month, a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun steamship sailing from Hankou had more than a hundred ruffians resembling deserters boarding the ship. Before meal time, they forcibly demanded meals. The steward politely asked them to wait, but they took out weapons, killing one person and injuring one person. This is the most recent case that proves the point. Therefore, passengers who have boarded domestic steamships are afraid of being affected and are all avoiding them, preferring to take foreign steamships to seek safety. Even those who board for the first time will inevitably be affected and will not board again. The news has spread, and travelers are on guard, causing the number of passengers on domestic steamships to decrease daily, and the income of domestic steamships to decline sharply. It is painful for the industry. After thinking repeatedly about the past, the only way to reduce suffering is to take precautionary measures. We humbly propose two measures for your consideration: (1) Please have the Headquarters investigate the old cases and select and dispatch military police to be stationed on each ship to investigate and suppress. Last year, after the Headquarters dispatched military police to be stationed on each ship, the tranquility was obvious and the effect was significant. However, due to the intense military affairs, all the military police were transferred back, which caused the harassment of the ruffians to become more intensified. Now that the military affairs have been pacified, it does not seem difficult to withdraw military police to implement escorting. It is proposed that the Headquarters investigate the old cases and dispatch five military police to each ship to police and suppress the crew in order to implement prevention. (2) Please have the Headquarters instruct the military and police agencies in each port along the way to immediately send a large team of military police to wait at the port when the above-mentioned steamships report an emergency and request assistance in order to arrest and punish the perpetrators. These ruffians often cause trouble on the ship while sailing, and because there are many of them, they are still afraid that the military police on board will not be able to suppress them. However, these ruffians mostly disembark at major ports. Therefore, only by arresting and punishing them by name at the port where they disembark, when the steamship is anchored or docked, can we stop them from being daring and eliminate their traces. The Headquarters should issue a telegram to the military and police agencies in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuxue, and Hankou, ordering them to be prepared at all times. In case of a telegram from the business director, purser, or important personnel of any of the above-mentioned domestic steamships reporting that there are ruffians on board who are taking advantage of their strength to board the ship or causing trouble, they must immediately dispatch a large team of military police to the port where the ship is scheduled to dock, wait, and arrest them all and punish them according to law. If one can be punished, hundreds can be warned. If the above-mentioned measures are approved by the Headquarters, the guild will submit a list of the names of the current business directors of the above-mentioned ships to the Headquarters for distribution to the above-mentioned military and police agencies for reference in order to avoid errors when receiving telegrams. The above-mentioned two measures are essential to protect people's travel and maintain commercial shipping, and they are all practical and effective. Therefore, the guild should quickly forward them to the Headquarters for approval and implementation in order to maintain the shipping industry and protect the people's travel. The urgency of awaiting orders is beyond words.</p>
<p>Request for Compensation for the Loss of the Daji: The Shipping Guild submitted a document to Commanders-in-Chief Jiang and Zhang yesterday regarding the violation of regulations by soldiers boarding merchant ships and causing disasters, requesting that precautionary measures be taken to prevent future occurrences and to ensure responsibility and safety.</p>
<p>"The Daji steamship of the Datong Shipping Company, a member of our guild, sailed from Shanghai to Tongzhou, Yangzhou, and other places on the night of March 10th, carrying more than 500 passengers. The next day, it was accidentally burned in the Longjusha area, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. According to the company's report from the Daji shipowner Wu Shicai, the cause of the disaster was stated as follows: 'When the ship was loading and unloading cargo and passengers at Tianshenggang, dozens of soldiers boarded the ship. Seeing that there was no space in the cabin, they swarmed to the second cabin and forcibly entered the area where there was a fence. The crew members told them that this area was a special cabin for special cargo and was entrusted by the Shanghai Ordnance Bureau to load saltpeter, so even though it was relatively empty, no passengers were allowed to sit or lie down in it according to regulations. However, not only did they not listen to the many dissuasions, but they even destroyed the fence and entered freely. Just half an hour later, a major disaster occurred, etc.' Subsequently, passengers who had escaped from the ship and survived confirmed that the shipowner's report was completely consistent, and witnessed that the troops were soldiers of the Lianghuai Anti-Smuggling Camp, etc. The guild investigated that passenger and cargo steamships have designated cabins in the second cabin specifically for placing valuable and dangerous goods. Outer trees and fences are implemented for isolation, and passengers are absolutely not allowed to board, and even ordinary cargo is not mixed in. This is a fixed rule. The Daji steamship was loading saltpeter and placing it in this area according to regulations, and there was nothing wrong with it. However, many soldiers of the Anti-Smuggling Camp disembarked from the ship at Tianshenggang, the port of call for the ship's voyage, and saw that the area was spacious and insisted on entering to stay. The crew members told them the regulations and explained the advantages and disadvantages, but they not only refused to listen, but also relied on their numbers and strength to destroy the fence and occupy the area freely, causing a major disaster. Legally speaking, the loss of all lives and property on board should be borne and compensated by the direct agency of the soldiers. This will be discussed later. However, soldiers boarding domestic merchant ships occurs at no time, no place, no ship, and no class. The fact that they do not abide by the regulations and do not accept arrangements is also repeatedly seen. The guild has repeatedly submitted requests to order corrections, and although orders have been issued to prohibit them, this trend has not been completely curbed. Now, it has resulted in a major disaster. Tracing the origin of the disaster, sadness is beyond words. Now that the pain has subsided, thinking about the future, it is even more chilling. In order to mend the fold after the sheep is lost, we must humbly request the correction and remedy in order to prevent future occurrences. Therefore, we have prepared a document for submission to the Department of Military Affairs, requesting that you examine and approve it and order the various troops to abide by it in the future. Soldiers must abide by the steamship regulations and obey the arrangements of the crew when boarding steamships. Otherwise, once reported, they will be punished according to military discipline. If a disaster unfortunately occurs, the commanding officer will be responsible for compensating for the loss of all lives and property on board, in order to ensure that responsibility is assigned and disasters do not occur again. The shipowner will be very fortunate, and the people will be very fortunate. The urgency of awaiting orders is beyond words."</p>

<h3>Labor Dispute at Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory Remains Unresolved After Mediation</h3>
<p>The entire workforce of the Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory at 450 Sapo Road went on strike on the 21st due to unreasonable oppression and violation of government orders by the factory, as well as refusal to mediate. Yesterday was the second day the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for mediation, but no resolution was reached due to the factory's persistence. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation Situation Yesterday morning at 9 AM, the management representatives, Shen Zhuochen and Zhong Xiongxiang, the labor representatives, Shen Jiesheng and Ni Chengcai, the Municipal Party Committee representative, Lin Meiyan, the chair, Wang Bing of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the recorder, Wang Zhichin, were present. The chair reported on the history of the case. Then, labor and management each presented their reasons. After a long discussion, the chair believed that: (1) Workers Shen Mao'er and two others should resume work immediately. (2) Workers should be paid as usual on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death on March 12th. (3) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike. (4) The police station should not be used to oppress workers in the future. (5) The previously dismissed workers Gu and Li should be reinstated immediately. (6) The issue of reducing workers' wages should be reviewed after investigation. (7) The issue of Shen Tianping leading hooligans to beat workers should be investigated and verified. The management representatives insisted on consulting with the manager before making a decision, which led to a deadlock. The chair announced that mediation would continue at 9 AM on the 24th.</p>
<p>Worker Injury Report After the factory instructed apprentices to collude with hooligans to assault worker Sun Mao'er, the labor union sent him to Wang Ziping Hospital on Anren Street, Lao Ximen, for treatment. His injuries were severe and life-threatening. The hospital's injury report is as follows: Name: Sun Mao'er. Injuries: fractured left rib, twisted spine, concussion, internal liver and lung damage, resulting in blood loss, painful breathing, dizziness, and loss of appetite. This injury is not easily treated. Temporarily stopping the bleeding to treat the symptoms and then treating the root cause, realigning the bones, and nourishing the spirit. Injury doctor: Wang Ziping. March 22nd.</p>
<p>Labor's Petition Yesterday, the First Special District Silk Weaving Industry Union submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "Petition regarding the factory instructing apprentices to bribe hooligans to beat union directors. All workers at the Jinxin factory are suffering from endless oppression and unreasonable demands from the management. They went on strike voluntarily and collectively on the 21st to awaken the factory's awareness. The Bureau dispatched Wang Bing to investigate the facts and promised to convene mediation on the 23rd. We should have been quietly awaiting a resolution. However, the management harbored malicious intentions and, at 7 AM yesterday morning, instructed apprentices to collude with hooligans to knock on Sun Mao'er's bedroom door, falsely claiming to have union matters to discuss. They lured him into the alley entrance and brutally beat him. Sun Mao'er's injuries are life-threatening. He has been sent to Wang Ziping's trauma clinic for treatment, and the injury report is attached. If the factory is not severely punished, the labor unrest will escalate and unforeseen events will occur, for which the union cannot be held responsible. We hereby submit this document to the Bureau for prompt and serious intervention."</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute Erupts at Tongji Silk Weaving Factory</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that workers at the Tongji Silk Weaving Factory on Tianbao Road, Hongkou, were preparing to join a legal labor union to alleviate the factory's oppression, which aroused the factory's jealousy. The factory then instigated hooligans to assault worker representative Wang Peizhang. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Worker Assaulted The entire workforce was preparing to join the Yinxiang District Silk Weaving Industry Union to alleviate their suffering. Factory manager Luo Shiyu heard about this and instructed hooligans to break into the factory at 11 AM on the 21st, luring worker representative Wang Peizhang out of the factory to the accountant's office entrance, where they inflicted severe beatings, leaving him covered in injuries and on the verge of death. As a result, all workers were filled with outrage and were unable to work.</p>
<p>Workers' Petition Yesterday at 3 PM, representatives Zhu Wenkui, Cai Hanting, and nine others petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding: (1) Compensation for worker Wang Peizhang's medical expenses. (2) Wages to be paid as usual during the injury period. (3) The factory must not interfere with workers joining a legal labor union. (4) Punishment for the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Labor's Petition "Petition regarding the factory colluding with hooligans to assault worker representative, requesting prompt and severe punishment of the perpetrators to maintain the rule of law. Workers Zhu Wenkui et al. publicly elected Wang Peizhang as their representative to contact the Yinxiang District Silk Weaving Industry Union to join it. On the morning of the 21st of this month, over ten hooligans suddenly broke into the factory and lured Wang Peizhang out of the factory to the accountant's office entrance, where they beat him, leaving him covered in injuries and on the verge of death. The hooligans fled, and the workers rushed Wang Peizhang to the Labor Hospital, where he vomited blood and looked pale. The injuries were severe. These hooligans were instructed by factory manager Luo Shiyu. Such inhumane acts by the factory have outraged all workers. This matter is of great importance, and we request prompt and severe action to uphold the law. Respectfully submitted to Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau."</p>

<h3>Pagoda Lantern Festival at Gongjiazhai in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Gong Amao and other farmers from Gongjiazhai, south of Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, invited many people to initiate a three-day pagoda lantern festival at the site of the local Tuditang Temple. Yesterday was the third day. From 4 PM, the crowd was immense, and the roads were congested. The scene was particularly grand in the evening. The setup of the venue is recorded below:</p>
<p>Large Candles in the Temple The temple is located north of Hongqiao Road and consists of two sections with a total of twelve rooms. It houses statues of deities such as the Land God, Guanyin, Liu Gong, and Yue Fei. The temple is usually very popular with worshippers. The old nun Wukong resides in the temple and is in charge. Behind the temple is a large locust tree, said to have been planted by Ming general Xu Da. The temple has many sacrificial offerings and incense, with the largest candle donated by the Xuejia Warehouse, weighing 300 catties. One incense stick weighs about 50 catties, and there are countless pairs of candles weighing tens of catties each.</p>
<p>Millions of Firecrackers on the Lantern Poles The lantern poles donated from all directions are firmly planted in the open space south of the road, totaling thirty-nine poles. When the sun sets, each lantern pole is lit with candles, illuminating the area like daylight, and firecrackers are set off, creating a deafening roar. The most prominent is the one with millions of firecrackers and ten catties of fireworks, sounding like machine guns and chain guns from afar.</p>
<p>Food Stalls in the Open Space The venue is located in a remote rural area with no shops. Most small business owners set up temporary stalls in the open space and along the roads. Some have built sheds and tents. Business is relatively good. There is a temporary restaurant with a neat arrangement, but few customers.</p>

<h3>Remaining Echoes After Bai Beichen's Death</h3>
<p>Profound Brotherly Love of a Younger Brother</p>
<p>Discussing the Grievous History of His Elder Sister's Life</p>
<p>Tears Streaming Down in Sorrow and Indignation</p>
<p>Bai Tang's love suicide passed a week ago. As time goes by, what should be said has already been said. However, the emotional and intricate details are still being spread among people in the form of small poems and fragmented notes. Further news has been heard, which is recorded to share with readers. Bai Beichen's younger brother, Bai Zhiheng, came to Shanghai alone from Beijing to mourn his deceased sister. His family was unaware of his journey of thousands of miles. He was filled with deep brotherly love and extreme indignation. He described his sister's grievous history, each word filled with blood and tears. Crying by the coffin, his heart was broken. The brother and sister had been separated in Beijing for three years. When the bad news came, he suspected it was a dream. Only yesterday, when he saw the coffin, did he realize that all thoughts were empty. His sister Beichen had gone to eternal sleep underground and could no longer fulfill their reunion. Bai Zhiheng arrived in Shanghai the morning before yesterday and left this morning. He carried a small rattan suitcase containing a photo of his deceased sister, three Beijing Chenbao newspapers, a diploma, and several letters of farewell. Apart from these, there was nothing else of value. However, these meager items were carefully protected in the suitcase, and he did not show them lightly, indicating that his heart was with his sister and his pain was like a broken arm. During the conversation, tears welled up in his eyes, and his pain was evident.</p>
<p>The Origins of Bai and Xu's Union Bai Beichen and Xu Xihe's union was introduced by Xu's sister, Xu Hua. Yesterday's newspaper briefly mentioned this. However, how did the two women, Bai and Xu, meet and how did Beichen and Xihe marry? This was the cause of the Bai Tang love suicide case. Bai Zhiheng explained this in detail: "My sister Beichen's original name was Mo Ren. In the autumn of the 14th year of the Republic, she graduated from the Jingzhao Sericulture Training Institute. The following year, she was admitted to the Donghai Hospital, which was run by the Japanese, to study obstetrics. At that time, Xu Ge Ping (Xihe's courtesy name)'s sister, Xu Hua, was also studying at the hospital. Because of their friendship as classmates, they became close friends. They were of the same mind and inseparable. Xu's family lived in Gotou, Xicheng, and they often visited each other. After my sister met Ge Ping, the ill-fated relationship was set. My sister then became Xu's wife. Looking back on the past, I feel that there was something inexplicable in the dark. At that time, the friendship between the two female classmates was deep and normal, but their friendship was unexpectedly strong. I heard that Xu Hua introduced my sister to her brother because she wanted to see each other often and be a family member. My sister also could not bear to part with Xu, and eventually this unfortunate marriage was formed. The wedding ceremony was very simple. I remember it was July 30th, 15th year of the Republic. When Xu Ge Ping and Bai Beichen married, Xu worked at the Salt Affairs Bureau and also held a concurrent position at the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<p>The Post-Marriage Time Was So Miserable The deterioration of the relationship between Xu and Bai after their marriage worsened with time. The relationship between the two families was like ice and charcoal, with no kinship. The two families once sued each other. The Bai family accused the Xu family of abusing their daughter, while the Xu family sued the Bai family for hiding their daughter-in-law in court. From then on, the two families were at odds. In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic, Bai Beichen followed her husband south to the capital. When the two first married, Bai's parents did not want their beloved daughter to leave and said that she would live in Beijing forever. Now that she was going south, there was much argument. The night before her departure, Beichen said to her husband, "This journey is tens of thousands of miles. I don't know when I will return to my hometown. I beg to return to my parents' home to bid them farewell." Xu agreed. After Bai returned, she did not immediately return to her husband's house. Xu sued her in court before she could return. The lawsuits between the two families started from this. Before leaving, Bai told her family, "The future is uncertain. My life is as thin as a peach blossom and as light as a silk thread. What else can I say?"</p>
<p>The Discovery That the Official Was Already Married Although Bai Beichen was employed in the capital, she frequently wrote home with words between the lines that she could not fully express. All her letters were written on Ministry of Transportation stationery, which indicated that she was not allowed to speak freely at home. As for Bai's discovery that Xu Ge Ping already had a wife, the matter was also very coincidental. One day, a family report came from Xu's hometown of Rugao, with the words "Everyone is safe below." Bai changed color after reading the letter and realized that Xu was indeed married. However, since what was done could not be undone, she had to endure the humiliation. However, from then on, her heart sought solace elsewhere. After that, she fell in love with her colleague Tang Meixi, which led to the tragedy of double love suicide. Bai Zhiheng recounted all of this in great detail, like peeling silk from a cocoon, layer by layer. Although the matter was very sad, the listeners were sighed with emotion and did not tire of listening.</p>
<p>Beijing Newspapers Eagerly Reported the Bad News Since the Shanghai newspapers published the details of the "Love Suicide in the Moon Palace" case, the Beijing newspapers, as the matter involved the local area, reprinted the story. Bai Zhiheng did not know about his sister's death until four days after she died on March 7th when he read the Beijing Chenbao. At first, he did not pay much attention because the names Ma Zhenxun and Bian Juefei did not sound like his sister. Later, the case became clearer, and the name Beichen appeared almost daily in the newspapers. When Bai's father heard people talking about it, he asked his son Zhiheng. Zhiheng said, "I already knew about this, but I didn't want to hurt my elderly father's heart, so I didn't tell him."</p>
<p>Leaving His Elderly Parents to Come to Shanghai to Mourn On the 19th, Bai Zhiheng decided to come to Shanghai to investigate the truth of his sister's death. However, because his parents were old, he feared that if he told them the truth, it would cause problems, so he kept it a secret. Before leaving, he told the elderly people that he was going to Tianjin for a day or two and would return. His intentions were good. "The price of fur in Tianjin is cheap. I'm going there to buy some goods and come back. You don't need to worry," Bai Zhiheng mimicked the elderly people's tone of voice to the reporter. His lips trembled, and the pain in his heart was revealed without reservation. Tears often welled up in his eyes. He also said that he had been separated from his second sister for three years. He often dreamed of her, but there was little news. Her last letter was sent in mid-January of this year, but it did not mention anything other than household matters.</p>
<p>Mourning His Sister with Chicken and Wine Bai Zhiheng arrived in Shanghai the morning before yesterday and went to the Moon Palace Hotel to ask where his deceased sister was lying in state. Yesterday afternoon at 1 PM, he went to the Jianghuai Public Cemetery with Zhou Xingwu, an inspector from the Moon Palace, to pay his respects. He fulfilled his rituals with chicken and wine. When he touched the coffin and cried, he felt the sorrow that had been building up for three years. After the funeral, his eyes were red and swollen. Bai traveled light, carrying only a small rattan basket containing his sister's photos and newspapers.</p>
<p>Bai Beichen's Ordinary Family Bai Beichen's brother's name is Zhiheng, courtesy name Jixu. He runs the Meihengqi shoe store inside Guang'anmen in Beijing. Therefore, he told his father that he was going to Tianjin to buy fur. Bai's father, Ren Shan, works at the Yongding River Affairs Bureau and is also getting old. Beichen's sisters were often called the second daughter. Her original name was Mo Ren, which was later changed to Beichen. Those who know her say that it is unlucky. As for her maiden name, Suying, few people know it.</p>
<h3>All Assets of the Gongfa Company to be Sold by Auction</h3>
<p>First, Huang Chu Jiu's Movable Property Will Be Sold</p>
<p>Real Estate to be Disposed of After Reporting</p>
<p>Following the closure of the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department, the fifth continued hearing took place yesterday. First, the new creditors' group, represented by Jing Xiren, Lu Qingshu, Tu Yunchao, and others, representing 3,386 households, was represented by four lawyers, Chen Tingrui, Wu Jingxiong, Jiang Yiping, and Qin Liankui, who requested that all official orders be merged for hearing. Subsequently, accountant Pan Zhaobang stated that the case regarding liquidation and registration had been carried out according to instructions. However, the largest debtor was Huang Chu Jiu, followed by the Fuchang Company. The disposal of the Chinese and Western Pharmacy, Hot Spring Bathhouse, Fuchang Tobacco Company, and Great World, among other entities, is currently under negotiation. Tan Yigong, the lawyer representing Huang Chu Jiu's family for liquidation, stated that the inventory of Huang Chu Jiu's movable and immovable property was extensive and difficult to clear up in a short time. As for the calligraphy, paintings, and antiques, their value needed to be assessed before they could be accounted for. Moreover, much of the real estate had been mortgaged to others, and those who had accepted the mortgages were unwilling to speak directly. There were also properties built on leased land with term contracts with the owners, making it difficult to investigate the various situations. In summary, Huang's assets were sufficient to cover the debts, and the creditor side might file a lawsuit in the foreign concession or report to the Special District Court, wondering to which court the enforcement would belong in the future. Accountant Pan Zhaobang stated that since Huang Chu Jiu was a shareholder of the Gongfa Company and owed a large sum to the Day and Night Bank, he should be responsible for repayment. According to lawyer Tan, all of Huang's assets could not be easily sold off in a short time, and the accountant disagreed. The debt in this case had been delayed for a long time, and if the sale was further postponed, it would greatly hinder the progress of liquidation. He requested permission to hand over Huang's movable property first for auction to expedite the closure of the case. Lawyer Tan then stated that he requested permission to change the date to report Huang's movable and immovable property in detail. Lawyer Yan Luqing, representing the creditors, stated that the case had been delayed for more than two months, and tens of thousands of depositors were in distress, making it difficult to prolong the delay. He requested that the Chinese and Western Pharmacy, Hot Spring Bathhouse, and others be auctioned off quickly to offset the debts. As for the list of shareholders of the Gongfa Company, it was reported that it had been forwarded by the Social Bureau to the four lawyers, Chen Tingrui, and requested that lawyer Chen hand it over for investigation and recovery. He further requested that Huang's family members quickly move the coffin of Huang Chu Jiu and all family members out of the house so that the house could be sold to avoid losses. Lawyer Chen Tingrui stated that, according to lawyer Tan, someone had filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court or reported to the public hall. Since the matter belonged to one case, it could be prosecuted in a consolidated case and proceed uniformly, allowing accountant Pan to be treated equally. He now submitted a copy of the list of shareholders handed over by the Social Bureau for verification, and the original was held by others. Lawyer Zhou Xiao'an stated that Huang Chu Jiu also had properties in Hangzhou, and he requested that a document be sent to the Hangzhou authorities to auction them off to offset the debts. Lawyer Dong Yu stated that the case had been in progress for three months, and the creditors' debts were still unsettled. Although the liquidators could not be blamed for the delay, it was hoped that the court would consider the plight of the poor depositors and order the liquidators to quickly dispose of the debtor's assets for early distribution. Lawyer Bian Jialu stated that the liquidation of the case had been going on for a long time, and the news had been silent. The creditors were anxious and eager to expedite the disposal to avoid losses. After the lawyers debated for a long time, presiding judge Gong Cheng issued an order for the liquidators to quickly auction off all assets of the Gongfa Company, and if they could not be sold immediately, they should properly consider ways to balance the interests of both creditors and debtors. He also ordered Huang Chu Jiu's sons, Xianyao and Xianzhong, to first hand over the movable property to the liquidators for display and auction, and to report the immovable property in detail for verification, and to summon the shareholders of the Gongfa Company and the responsible persons of the Wanchun Silver Group to court for further hearing.</p>
<h3>The Stolen Jewelry Case of the New China Foreign Firm Solved</h3>
<p>It Was Done by Four Policemen Together</p>
<p>Liu Shaoting Showed His Hand Selling a Watch</p>
<p>A Lot of Stolen Goods Were Found at Fei Guangqing's Home</p>
<p>Doorkeeper Policemen Are Too Unreliable</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th of last month, the British-owned New China Foreign Firm at 105 Nanjing Road discovered that jewelry worth 18,500 yuan and a pistol belonging to the firm's manager had been stolen. At that time, Chinese and Western detectives from the relevant police station rushed to investigate the theft to track down the criminals, as reported previously. The case has been going on for nearly a month, and although the investigation was strict, there were initially no leads. On the 19th of this month, detective Qi Mengqing of the Putuo Road police station</p>
<p>Accidentally Obtained a Clue, Thus Solving the Case and Recovering Most of the Stolen Goods. Liu Shaoting, a policeman from Anhui province with badge number 2989 of the police station, suddenly sold a gold watch to a Chinese policeman with badge number 2892 for 11 yuan. The Chinese policeman thought the watch was excellent and the price was particularly low, so he decided to buy it. He happened to be short of funds, so he temporarily borrowed from detective Qi. Qi's heart fluttered when he heard about the watch, and he asked the Chinese policeman to show it to him after he bought it. When he saw the watch, he was surprised that it was</p>
<p>Similar to the Stolen Goods from New China Foreign Firm, He Did Not Immediately Reveal It. He then asked Liu Shaoting if he also wanted to buy such a watch, wondering if he could get one. Liu replied that he originally had another watch of the same type, but because he didn't know that he liked it, he had already pawned it. Qi quickly asked for the pawnshop's name and location. Liu told him that the pawnshop was located at 652 Tokyo Road. Qi silently remembered it and then went to the pawnshop to inquire. According to the staff, a few days ago, there was indeed</p>
<p>A Policeman Who Asked to Pawn a Watch. Qi then excused himself and, before leaving, urged the staff to detain any policeman who came to pawn a watch and immediately report to the police station without concealing it. The staff agreed. On Saturday of last week (the 21st), Liu Shaoting actually took another watch to pawn. The staff dared not indulge him and detained Liu, sending someone to report to the Putuo Road police station. Detective Qi immediately rushed to interrogate Liu and searched his body. In addition to the pawned watch,</p>
<p>Two More Watches Were Found in His Pocket. He was taken back to the police station. The police chief, because the case occurred in the jurisdiction of the general police station, sent Liu, along with the five watches he had searched, pawned, and sold, to the general police station for questioning. Zhao Zhengrong, a policeman with badge number 3011 of the Putuo Road police station, Fei Guangqing, the doorkeeper policeman with badge number 650 at the front door of the New China Foreign Firm, Cheng Yingzhou, the doorkeeper policeman with badge number 1506 at the back door, and Li Tinggui, who lived at 171 Hefeng Lane, Robert Sheng Road, and Yang Huizhi all had a conspiracy relationship. Chinese and Western detectives Xie Shuiquan and Mei Sheng, along with detective Liu Xiangqi, were dispatched to arrest each person by name. Ten original stolen watches were found in Li's home, and one was hidden on Li's person, which was also searched.</p>
<p>Fei Obtained the Most Stolen Goods, All Hidden at His Brother's Home at 2999 Nanfu Lane, Robert Sheng Road. Chinese and Western detectives rushed to search and found 65 watches and 22 necklaces, all of which were taken back to the police station for temporary storage. Yesterday morning, the stolen goods were escorted to the Special District Court. Judge Xu presided over the interrogation. Police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the current investigation showed that the case was initiated by Fei and the two doorkeeper policemen</p>
<p>Because They Lost Gambling. Therefore, they resorted to theft. However, there were still accomplices who had not been caught, and he requested a two-week adjournment for further investigation. Fei Guangqing, the defendant, admitted to initiating the theft without denying it. Cheng Yingzhou stated that when the theft occurred, Fei suddenly introduced a girl to talk to him, allowing the thieves to take the opportunity to sneak into the firm. However, he did not know about it and did not receive any stolen goods. Yang Huizhi stated that Fei originally hired her daughter as his wife, but because he knew that he had a wife, he canceled the engagement. He was maliciously framing her. The court ordered Yang to post a bail of 200 yuan, and the others were detained for further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Case of a Female Member of a Magic Society Dying of Illness in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Wu Caoyun's Appeal Case Opens</p>
<p>Lu Huiling and Others Are Detained</p>
<p>Lu Huiling, Yu Huisheng, Zhao Huiying, and others organized a "Spirit Magic Society" last December to study magic tricks and invited two girls, Chen and Wu, to join on December 13, 1920. Chen was named Huiying and Wu was named Huirong (Ms. Wu, 16 years old, academic name Wu Aixian). The group of five went to Tianjin to perform without their parents' consent. However, after arriving in Tianjin, Wu Huirong became ill and died on January 14. Wu's mother and brother had been searching for Aixian since she disappeared and learned that Lu Huiling and others had abducted her. They negotiated with Lu's father, Lu Zhenxiang. Lu then sent Zhao Huiying's father, Zhao Yunzhong, to Tianjin to investigate. Zhao learned that Lu Huiling and others were indeed in Tianjin and returned to Shanghai in advance, informing Wu's mother and brother that Huirong was seriously ill in Tianjin and was being sent back to Shanghai on the Fusheng ship, arriving on the 24th (January). Wu's mother ordered Wu Caoyun to accompany relatives Fan Xinsheng and Lu Sheng to the pier to meet the ship. However, only Lu Huiling and the other three were there, and Aixian was not. He asked Zhao Yunzhong, who replied that it was not the place to talk and that details could be discussed after disembarking. They then went to Room 303 of the Oriental Hotel. At the Oriental Hotel, Lu and the others informed Wu Caoyun that Wu Huirong had died and proposed that Lu and the others would provide 300 yuan as a betrothal gift and Huirong would be treated as Lu's daughter-in-law, and the Lu family would arrange the burial and prayers. Wu Caoyun insisted that her sister's death was unclear and could not be handled so simply and resolutely refused. Lu and the others, unable to achieve their purpose, used pre-emptive measures to report to the police station. The police detectives brought Wu Caoyun and the other three into the police station and sent them to court. The police filed a public prosecution for restricting freedom and extorting money. On the 26th, Judge Xu Jiaqi tried the case once, and after the second trial on the 30th, he announced the verdict: "Wu Caoyun is sentenced to 30 days of detention and a fine of 200 yuan each for restricting personal freedom and attempted extortion, Sun Shuguang, Fan Xinsheng, and Lu Sheng are sentenced to 30 days of detention and a fine of 200 yuan each for assisting in restricting personal freedom and attempted extortion. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined to be two days of detention for one day, and the fine is two yuan for one day of detention if it cannot be paid." Wu Caoyun and others refused to accept the verdict and declared an appeal. The case was heard for the first time yesterday afternoon by Judge Song of the High Court. Both the original defendant and the plaintiff were present. After Judge Song questioned them in detail, he scheduled the verdict to be announced on the afternoon of the 27th and detained the appellants Lu Huiling, Yu Zhisheng, Zhao Huiying, and Lu's father, Lu Zhenxiang. The circumstances of the hearing and the details of the incident are summarized below.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Hearing First, the appellants Wu Caoyun, Sun Shuguang, Fan Xinsheng, Lu Sheng, and the other four were questioned and presented in detail the conversations they had with Lu and the others in Room 303 of the Oriental Hotel on January 24. The statements were the same as in the first trial, and they absolutely denied the charges of restricting freedom and extorting money. Next, the appellees Lu Hui and others Lu confessed that the details of the magic performance in Tianjin and Wu Huirong's death in Tianjin were the same as in the first trial. However, the confession regarding extortion at the Oriental Hotel differed from the previous confession. After the interrogation, the appellant's defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, made a defense, and the verdict was announced on the afternoon of the 27th.</p>
<p>Details of the Abduction Ms. Wu, named Aixian, was 16 years old and very intelligent. She was a fifth-grade student at Xinmin Public School in Zhabei. She was very fond of singing and dancing. On the morning of December 13 of last year, she went out alone and did not return until late at night. Her mother and brother were very anxious and searched everywhere but could not find her. The next day, residents said that she had been abducted by Lu Huiling, but they did not know where she had been taken. Wu's mother negotiated with Lu's father, Lu Zhenxiang. Lu immediately admitted that his son had also gone out and had not returned, and said that he would be responsible for investigating and finding her. If anything happened, he could be held accountable. At that time, Wu Caoyun suggested reporting to the Public Security Bureau, but his mother, out of consideration for appearances, did not want to do so, only hoping that her daughter would return and not wanting to involve the authorities. With Lu's father's permission to take responsibility for the investigation, the family had to wait quietly for news. Half a month later, the Wu family received a letter from Aixian from Tianjin, saying that it was extremely inappropriate to leave without saying goodbye and that it was even more unfilial not to repay her parents' kindness. She was now in good health in Tianjin and asked them not to investigate or worry. However, the letter did not have an address, so the Wu family had to send a letter to Tianjin asking friends to investigate nearby. According to a reply from a friend, there was no magic troupe performing in Tianjin and he asked the Wu family to send a photo of Aixian for investigation. Later, the Wu family received two more letters from Aixian, neither of which mentioned illness. Although the Wu family knew that Aixian was in Tianjin, they still did not know her address, so they urged Lu Zhenxiang. Lu then sent Zhao Yuanzhong, the father of Zhao Huimei, to Tianjin to search. On January 22, Zhao Yuanzhong and Lu Zhenxiang accompanied the Wu family, claiming that Aixian was indeed in Tianjin but was suffering from a severe throat ailment and was now trying to get back to Shanghai on the Fusheng ship. Wu Caoyun asked when she would arrive, but Lu and Zhao were evasive and did not tell him. Wu Caoyun learned that the ship would arrive at about 3:00 p.m. on the 24th. That afternoon, Wu's mother ordered Wu Caoyun to accompany friends Fan and Lu to the pier to meet her sister. The ship arrived, but after waiting for half an hour, Lu and the others did not get off the ship. Wu Caoyun boarded the ship to inquire and met Zhao Yuanzhong, who asked Zhao why he could not see his sister. Zhao replied that this was not the place to talk and that he could discuss the details after getting off the ship in another place. Wu Caoyun suggested going back to Zhabei to discuss, but Zhao Yuanzhong suggested going to the concession. At this time, Lu Sheng went to the concession. He had a room at the Oriental Hotel and could sit there for a while. Lu and the other seven people and Wu and the other three took two cars to the Oriental Hotel. Lu and the others' luggage had to be taken by the Mengyuan Hotel's cab because there were no cars. After arriving at the Oriental Hotel, two of Lu and the others left, and after a while, four or five strangers arrived. Lu and the others told Wu Caoyun that the person was dead and there was no hope. It was better for everyone to become relatives. Lu Huiling would provide 300 yuan as a betrothal gift and would treat Wu Huirong as Lu's daughter-in-law, and the Lu family would arrange the burial and prayers. Wu said that Aixian's death was unclear and it was difficult to settle the matter in this way. If it was handled in this way, it would have to be with her mother's consent and she had no right to allow it. Lu and the others also said that Wu Aixian went to Tianjin voluntarily. It was best if everyone could be polite, otherwise they would file a lawsuit and there would be no way to deal with it. They also told Wu that if you didn't agree, you wouldn't get out tonight. At the same time, they forced Wu to sign a marriage certificate. Wu was unwilling. When they were in a standoff, Lu Zhenxiang also led several strangers to come and claimed that if you didn't agree to this matter, they would give you some trouble. The situation was very turbulent. Wu and the other four (Sun Shuguang was invited by Wu to the Oriental Hotel by telephone) were afraid that something would happen and wanted to report to the police station, but they could not get through after calling several times. Later, Lu Zhenxiang sent someone to report to the police station, and they were taken to the police station and sent to court at about 9:00 p.m. that night.</p>
<h3>Robbery on the Road, Thief Caught on the Spot</h3>
<p>Two Banknotes Were Robbed and Intercepted on the Spot</p>
<p>Members of the Defense Corps Who Accepted Bribes Were Punished Together</p>
<p>Shipowner Zhang Shouxing, a local resident, 29 years old, was moored his boat at the outer Rihui Bridge the night before. At 12:10 a.m. yesterday morning, he had two five-yuan banknotes and planned to go to his friend Zhou Fulai's house on Xinglong Street to settle his debt. Unexpectedly, when he was passing near Kangjia Bridge, three robbers suddenly rushed out of the darkness beside the road. One thief held a flashlight and shone it on Zhang, ordering him to stop and pointing a gun at Zhang's chest, prohibiting him from making a sound. He then took away two five-yuan banknotes, forcing him to leave quickly, otherwise he would shoot him. Zhang was intimidated by the coercive power and was alone, so he did not dare to resist. He secretly followed behind and tracked them to near Pingyin Bridge. Coincidentally, there was police station No. 62 of the Second District General Office stationed there. Zhang secretly reported to the police and then joined the police from station No. 61 to chase after them closely. As a result, they intercepted a thief and found a fake pistol on the spot and detained him and escorted him to the Second District General Office. After a strict interrogation by District Chief Wang, he confessed that his name was Jin Longsheng, 22 years old, a local resident, and currently lived at No. 4 Tongle Lane, Longhua Road, and worked as a blacksmith. He directly admitted to repeatedly robbing on the road with a gang and also confessed that his accomplices Xu Axin (19 years old, from Changshu) was hiding at No. 837 Tongle Lane, Longhua Road, and also confessed that Cao Jinquan (21 years old, a local resident), a member of the Fifth Team of the Shanghai Defense Corps, extorted from them the stolen steel watch. According to the confession, District Chief Wang immediately ordered the police officer to arrest Xu and Cao at their addresses. Xu confessed that on December 26 of last year, he and Jin robbed a steel watch from a passerby on Dapu Road and divided the eight cents. Unexpectedly, Cao learned about this the next day and privately fined them four yuan. Jin took out the money and redeemed the steel watch and gave it to Cao. When questioned, Cao Jinquan's confession was ambiguous. District Chief Wang believed that Jin and Xu's repeated road robbery was undeniable, but Cao, as a member of the Defense Corps, should cherish himself and should not privately accept bribes and stolen goods from criminals and should also be subject to legal judgment. He immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the Judicial Section for review.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Injury of the Victim on Meizhou Road</h3>
<p>One Thief Was Caught</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 1:00 a.m., four thieves came to the unnamed rural house on Meizhou Road, Yangshupu. One held a sharp blade and one held a pistol and used an iron tool to pry open the front door. Unexpectedly, the owner of the house heard the alarm and came out bravely to capture a thief bare-handed. Although the thief fired three shots at the owner, fortunately none hit him. However, the owner suffered serious injuries to his head and other places. After someone frantically blew a whistle, the remaining thieves fled. The captured thief was called</p>
<p>The police who arrived at the police station brought him into the police station and detained him. This morning, he was sent to the court for review.</p>
<h3>Fire Truck Collides with Tram</h3>
<p>One Child Dies, Five People Injured</p>
<p>At about 7:30 p.m. last night, fire engine No. 15 of the Central Fire Brigade was returning from fighting a fire at the end of Fair Road. While traveling from west to east to the intersection of Fair Road and Tangshan Road, it suddenly collided with tram No. 18. Both sides were unable to give way in time and collided with each other, rushing along Fair Road towards the Caijie of the First Floor of Fair Road, destroying the walls before the two vehicles stopped. At that time, a child, Zhu Baoxing, was leading his younger brother, Dingren, to watch a wedding in front of the restaurant. Dingren was immediately killed by the impact. Firefighter Ren Abei of No. 539, a Korean ticket inspector of No. 24, and a child, Mao Rongbi, of Yuanda Carriage Company were all injured and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Disobedient Son Assaults Mother, Detained</h3>
<p>The Unfilial Behavior of Shen Yinqian</p>
<p>Old Lady Shen Zhao, 51 years old, lives at No. 1 Shideli, Youche Wharf, Nanshi. She has a son named Yinqian, now 29 years old, who is lazy. He used to work as a coppersmith, but has been unemployed for four years. He usually asks his mother for money at home for his expenses. If she doesn't comply, he beats and insults her. Although she can't bear the harassment, she can't do anything about it. Yinqian's wife also finds it difficult to live with her husband's rascal behavior and filed a lawsuit for divorce in the Shanghai District Court last year. After the court hearing, she was ordered to pay 550 yuan to Shen Zhao for her to receive and approve the divorce. After Shen Zhao received the money, she returned the loans she took out during the lawsuit and gave the remaining 50 yuan to her son. Who knew that he would spend it all in less than two months? At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Yinqian specifically asked his mother for 500 yuan. Shen Zhao told Yinqian about repaying the debt. Yinqian began to abuse and beat his mother, and he was not satisfied. He also destroyed all the furniture in the room. Zhao saw that her son was so disobedient, violent, and unruly, so she called the police and brought Yinqian into the relevant First District and First Precinct. After a preliminary trial by the chief of the precinct, he ordered that a document be prepared and submitted to the Third Section of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor: After reading today's newspaper, I noticed that the Secretary-General's report in the news of the 177th meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Government's municipal conference regarding the review of the case of increasing the number of rickshaws, the decision of the three principles still omitted the item "3. The number of vehicles in this city should be expanded to 10,000." I am writing to ask your newspaper to check and correct this. Sincerely, Fifth Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government March 22</p>

<h3>Chongming Teachers and Staff Suspend Classes to Demand Salaries</h3>
<p>The Department of Education Orders the County to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education sent a telegram to the county magistrate of Chongming County regarding the suspension of classes by teachers and staff in Chongming to demand salaries, saying that the county magistrate of Chongming County, Shen Jian, had embezzled more than 10,000 yuan of educational funds and owed teachers' salaries for several months, resulting in a strike by teachers throughout the county to demand salaries. Yesterday, the Education Bureau and all teachers and staff, Huang Jian and others, sent a telegram stating that they had already telegraphed the county magistrate to quickly allocate funds to repay the salaries and advised the schools to resume classes as usual immediately. The Education Bureau has again telegraphed, stating that the telegrams have been sent yesterday and all teachers in the county have gone on strike to demand salaries. The county government has embezzled more than 10,000 yuan and has no intention or means of repaying the salaries. The county magistrate is responsible for supervising education throughout the county and should be responsible for repaying the previously embezzled educational funds. If this is true, it is very inappropriate. The county magistrate should immediately allocate all the previously embezzled educational funds by the date of receipt of this document and supervise all schools to resume classes as usual immediately without further delay, and immediately telegraph the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, Ma Yin.</p>

<h3>Grand Occasion of Jinan University Welcoming School Board Members</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 25th anniversary of the founding of Jinan University. New school board members Sun Zhesheng and Kong Yongzhi came to the school for inspection. Guests included President Lao Da, Wang Jingqi, Shen Zhuowu, representatives of the Jinan Alumni Associations of Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and current teachers and students, totaling more than 600 people.

<p>Principal delivers the opening speech: After the music filled the air, the applause stopped, and the ceremony was performed as usual, Chairman Principal Zheng stood up and delivered the opening speech. He briefly stated that today is the anniversary of the founding of the school, and he sincerely welcomes the new school board members. Teachers and students are extremely happy. On this day twenty-five years ago, only twenty-one students returned from Java and started school on the upper floor of the Sanpailou Industrial School in Beijing, half of which was used as a dormitory and half as a classroom. Today, we are pleased to receive the attention of the central government to overseas Chinese education and to complete the highest institution of learning. Eleven people have been selected to serve as school board members, and the foundation of the school will be further consolidated from now on. I often say that education is a pure undertaking, and education for overseas Chinese should be conducted with openness in all matters. The school board of our school is different from other schools. The board members not only audit the finances, but the principal must report on all administrative matters to the board, and the board discusses and hands them over to the principal for execution. We must ensure that the Three Principles of the People are realized in our school, and that the legacy is used as the foundation. I deeply hope that the school board will strictly supervise our school.</p>
<p>Director Sun Zhesheng delivered a speech: Today is the first time I have come here. I feel that Jinan University has a large scale and is equipped with all facilities. It has become a complete school, which is very gratifying. According to the organization of the national university, there is no board of directors. At present, only Zhongda and this school have boards. Zhongda was founded by the Premier himself. The central government has established boards for the sake of commemoration and development, so it has appointed comrades to serve as directors. The mission of this school is more important than that of other universities. The central government has established a board of directors to assist the principal in handling affairs. From today onwards, it will have a closer relationship with the party. It can be said that it is a university of the party, which shows the importance of Jinan University. Overseas Chinese children grow up overseas and are often immersed in colonial rule and forget their ancestors. Therefore, I hope that the students of Jinan University will have two tasks: (1) To make overseas Chinese have spiritual connection, miss their motherland, and strive to serve the motherland. The success of the revolution is the result of the support of the overseas Chinese to the party. The overseas Chinese occupy an important position, and the revolutionary work must continue to be carried out. (2) To enable overseas Chinese to continue to help the country and maintain the previous revolutionary procedures. You have returned to China to study, not only to study literature, history, and the current social situation, but also to complete the greatest task of cultivating revolutionary and construction talents for the country and dedicating your lifelong spirit and ability to the motherland for the sake of construction. Because Jinan University has this mission, the central government cannot but value Jinan University more than other universities and its close relationship with the party.</p>
<p>Director Kong Yongzhi delivered a speech: I have many feelings in addition to the joy of Jinan University's holding this great anniversary in fine weather.</p>
<p>Previously, when the Ministry of Education did not allow the president to hold concurrent positions, President Zheng and I were jointly responsible for industry and commerce. Industry and commerce were originally an essential plan for saving the country, but President Zheng believed that education to save the country was even more important, and that Jinan University was the Premier's reward for the overseas Chinese revolution. Therefore, he discussed with me the resignation of Ning Yuan to sacrifice the affairs of the Ministry and return to the position of president. However, I was sick and could not let him go. However, I suggested that if he could not bear the responsibility, he could organize a board of directors. Many progressive parties and countries agreed with this. This time, the central government launched eleven brothers, and I was also respectfully listed behind. Today, when I come here, I see that the school song made by President Zheng when he founded the school has the name "To Expand the National Maritime Rights for the Motherland, Our Party Awakens the Soul and the Wind and Clouds Change, and the Beautiful Mountains and Rivers" truly has profound meaning. Today, I hope that the students of this school (1) will revolutionize and strive to promote the Three Principles of the People in overseas Chinese communities in the future so that everyone can understand them (2) will promote industrialization and persuade compatriots to return to China to start industries (3) will nationalize and the National Government will not only be the backing of overseas Chinese compatriots but also the vanguard (4) will harmonize and the people from various provinces are gathered in one place should have love and affection and will not hate and fight and will naturally achieve a great harmony in the world</p>
<p>The following are welcome speeches by Xie Xunchu, a representative of the rescue staff, Lin, a student representative, Wen Kai of the Jinan Alumni Association in Shanghai, Gu Yufang of Nanjing, Wang Weiyin of Wuhan, and other representatives of overseas Chinese who gave welcome speeches. The representatives of the Overseas Chinese Academic Association presented a commemorative silver shield after the ceremony.</p>

<p>Registration Period: April 6th to 16th</p>

Therefore, the venue has decided to organize the second amateur basketball competition. Registration starts on April 6th and ends on April 16th. In the future, the competition time will be from 5:50 PM from Monday to Saturday, except for Sundays when there will be more games, which will not interfere with the work of all sectors.

<h3>A Brief Family History of Sun Baoqi</h3>
<p>— Lian Weng</p>
<p>Sun Mu-han was appointed as a Junior Secretary due to his father's position. In the year of Gengzi (1900), he followed the Emperor and was in charge of confidential telegrams. Thanks to the promotion by Wang Wenqin, he unexpectedly became an envoy and shouldered responsibilities in the frontier. Although he indulged in officialdom after the Xinhai Revolution and only retired when he was old, some say he was poor and should not be discussed in detail. His late father, Wen Quegong Yijing, although only an Attendant in the Ministry of Rites, served in the Yuqing Palace for a long time. His noble character was well-known, and he possessed the demeanor of a Confucian scholar, unlike those high-ranking officials in the capital. This was due to his family's learning and his refusal to follow vulgar trends. This was the accumulation of Wen Que and the success of Mu-han.</p>
<p>Wen Zhong, styled Zishou, was a Hanlin scholar in the year of Gengshen during the reign of Emperor Xianfeng. He was posthumously honored as a public figure. His ancestral name was Feng, a tribute student. He had a collection of poems titled "Human Realm Dwelling Poems." He lived in the Lakeside Town outside the North Gate of Hangzhou. Even at the age of seventy, he still supported himself by teaching students. Wen Que also entered the city to teach after passing the local examination, and Wu Zixiu, the Education Commissioner, was one of his students. Wen Que lost his mother at the age of seven and had one older sister and one younger brother. At that time, Wen Zhong's mother was still alive. Wen Zhong upheld righteousness and did not remarry, and his mother managed the family affairs. When Wen Que was fourteen, his mother also passed away, and his sister took over the domestic affairs, teaching him both moral principles and justice. Wen Que first married a woman from the Shen family, but she also died early. His sister married Hu Biyan, a talented scholar from the same town, when she was twenty-six. Hu Ben, an academician, later perished during the Gengshen Rebellion. Therefore, after Wen Que passed the imperial examination, the road south was blocked, so he devised a way to bring his father and sister north. His brother's name was Yi Shen, a magistrate of Jiangxi Province. He had two sons named Bao Hu and Bao Huang. Hu was a vice-tribute student, and Huang was a student. They are all deceased now.</p>
<p>When Wen Que served as a Vice Minister in the Ministry of Revenue, the minister in charge was Prince Gong. Wang Wenqin was then serving as Vice Minister and acting Minister. Because of embezzlement of copper taxes from Yunnan Province, he was impeached by a censor and both were dismissed from their posts to await trial. After investigation, only Wen Que was not implicated. He was specially summoned to inquire about the matter from beginning to end. During his reply, he did not exonerate Prince Gong, and was fined half a year's salary. Prince was demoted in rank. Zhou Song, a secretary, was imprisoned. The posthumous honors Wen Que received were less than others because Prince Gong held a grudge. Therefore, Wen Que's posthumous honor in recent years was requested by the Education Commissioner Zixiu and others. Mu-han only compiled brief accounts to leave to relatives and friends when it was the hundredth anniversary of Wen Que's death, but he could not provide details of everything that had happened before and after. Mu-han also had a concubine, Madam Fu, who gave birth to a son named Bao Xuan, styled Zhong Yu, who once served as the Superintendent of Customs in Zhejiang. He also passed away before him. As for his wife, Madam Zhang, and her son, Jingyang, people can talk about them, so I will not dwell on them.</p>
<p>Such is the passing of time.</p>
<h3>Condolence Couplet for Mr. Fan Fanshan</h3>
<p>— Watch Cloud Building Owner</p>
<p>This old man lived eighty-six years, what kind of karmic cultivation did a young child have to receive poems of praise and honor? When Huiqin's green faded, he came south and lay on his sickbed, his books made it difficult to know his old age and illness.</p>
<p>He left behind more than twenty thousand poems, Shengshen pays homage from afar, such ancient and modern masterpieces continue after Shifu, looking away from the building after you left, wailing for the poet.</p>
<h3>Condolence Couplet for Teacher Fanshan</h3>
<p>— Li Guifen</p>
<p>In his old age, he was even more energetic. I deeply regret that I did not hear the Master's teachings when I followed him north of Ji.</p>
<p>His articles are now even more renowned, and today in Jiangnan, people sing and weep for his poems, not merely loving to recite the poems of the old man.</p>
<h3>Condolence Couplet for Teacher Fanshan</h3>
<p>— Xin Yanqiu</p>
<p>His divine brush has been pressed down in Jilin for a long time, and I personally received his teachings in the past. Fortunately, I was able to benefit from his guidance.</p>
<p>Three times of exhaustion, it turned out to be a transformation into a crane. I silently bow my heart's incense, unable to bear the peach and plum trees weeping in the spring breeze.</p>
<h3>A Visit to a 250-Year-Old Man in Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Gong Han, sent from Sichuan</p>
<p>The 250-year-old man Li Qingyun has long been known throughout the country, and the masses all have the regret of not being able to see him. Therefore, on January 31st of this year, I followed a Sichuan Economic Investigation Group from Shanghai by boat into Sichuan and met him at Cuibai Peak, more than two hundred miles west of Wanxian County. Through the introduction of the locals, I was able to meet this rare human immortal. Since I entered the Kui Gate, I have seen the spiritual beauty of the mountains and rivers and the abundance of scenery, which is completely different from other provinces. This so-called "blessed by nature" and "Land of Abundance" since ancient times is indeed not a false statement, and the emergence of rare treasures and extraordinary people is indeed well-founded. The old man lives in a few thatched huts in the southeast corner of the mountaintop. When I arrived here, I knocked on the door and entered, and the old man welcomed me to sit down, brewed mountain tea, and we talked together. Although the old man's hair was as white as silver, his speech was loud and his hearing was sharp, like a man in his sixties. I immediately asked about his family history and his longevity techniques. The old man said, "I once married a wife and had two sons and a daughter, but they all died young, and my wife also passed away. I was born in the nineteenth year of the Kangxi Emperor. I once worked as a farmer, but later, due to the chaos of war, I lived in the mountains. I really don't know what the longevity technique is, but I get up every morning at dawn and work diligently, walking several miles every day. After the age of seventy, I rarely eat meat, only coarse vegetables and millet. After the age of one hundred and twenty, when picking herbs in the Bashan Mountains, I found a kind of rare treasure, namely white fungus. When I first tried eating it, I felt it was delicious, and later I used it as a daily food. Later, I felt that my waist and legs were light and strong, and my eyes and ears were clear, even better than before. Perhaps it was due to the effect of eating white fungus. After the Jiaqing era, this kind of white fungus gradually spread to the world, but the methods of picking are not correct. This thing is born from the spiritual energy of the mountains and rivers and the essence of heaven and earth. If you do not know the thickness of the mountain veins and the time of the climate, and the picking and drying methods are not correct, it is easy to reduce its innate spiritual energy, and the effect will be weak. The year before last, a fellow villager opened a Sichuan store in Shanghai and sent his fellow partner, Zheng, back to Sichuan to purchase white fungus in the mountains. I once met him at the foot of the mountain and saw that this fellow villager was quite sincere, so I explained in detail that the white fungus in a certain place on this mountain, facing the sun, gets the energy early, and the effect is ten times greater than other places. I also told him to be accurate in the timing of picking and to pay attention to the heat in the drying method. He was also able to follow my instructions in picking. You came from the sea, do you know if his business is good or not?" The old man also said, "If people can be indifferent to fame and fortune, restrain desires, work diligently, and choose their diet, it is easy to enjoy a long life. I have repeatedly advised people that there is no need to seek immortals or ask Buddhas." I admired the old man's words even more. After a while, the old man brought out a meal, which was plain food but tasted quite delicious, and said that it was late and earnestly asked me to stay overnight, promising to send me back by a shortcut in the morning. The next morning, the old man led me down a small path from the east stream, winding down nearly twenty miles to the foot of the mountain. I thanked him and bid him farewell, feeling grateful for the old man's warm hospitality and admiring the old man's famous words on health preservation. When I returned, I dipped my pen and wrote this down.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from a Visit to the Yingrui Warship</h3>
<p>— Wang Yuesou</p>
<p>Yesterday, through the introduction of an old classmate from the Navy, I was able to visit the Yingrui warship berthed at Gaochang Temple. After receiving a detailed explanation, I gained a lot of common knowledge. I will record it here as a free discussion.</p>
<p>▲ The Repairs Are Completed, Looking Brand New The Yingrui warship entered the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs after its cruise with naval cadets. It has recently left the dock, so it looks brand new. This ship was built by the Vickers factory in the United Kingdom in 1911, with a value of 2.4 million at that time. The ship is 346 feet long, 39.5 feet wide, and has a displacement of 2,460 tons. It is said to have 6,000 horsepower and can travel 20 nautical miles per hour. It can be considered one of the top warships in the Chinese Navy.</p>
<p>▲ Guns and Cannons Are Arrayed, Military Appearance Is Neat and Tidy When I arrived at the ship, I was led by naval cadets to visit the deck. The guns and cannons were arrayed, which made me feel solemn and imposing. I was also given the opportunity to remove the gun covers to see their structure. It is said that the ship has large cannons with a six-inch caliber at the front and rear. When this cannon is fired, it requires nine sailors and its range can reach 13,600 yards. The ship has two three-inch guns and six guns with a two-three pound caliber. In addition, there are two anti-aircraft guns and two machine guns. There are many more guns in the cabin. It is said that gunpowder and bullets are carefully stored in the gunpowder cabin.</p>
<p>▲ Military Bugle Is Majestic, Flags Are Lowered in Unison The ceremony of raising and lowering the flag on the ship is very solemn. After I visited the guns and cannons, it was already 6:00 PM. On this day, the warships Hai Rong, Yingrui, and Yongjian were berthed in the river. The team leader, the Hai Rong warship, notified each warship to prepare to lower the flags. Then, the military bugle sounded in unison, and each warship lowered its flag at the same time. The personnel on the ship stood at attention and raised their hands to show respect for the flag of the Party and the State. After the flag was lowered, the electric lights on the ship were turned on at the same time, as it was already evening. Then, I visited the Baoding Platform. The Baoding Platform is where the captain is stationed during combat. All the ship's mechanisms are located here. There is an iron plate around the front of the platform, three inches thick, to resist artillery shells. Later, I visited the sea searchlight. The ship has a total of four sea searchlights, two large and two small. The large ones can project light for 20,000 yards, which is not only for use during combat, but also provides great assistance for ships traveling in fog.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Mysterious Machine Gun and Boiler Room After visiting the deck, I went into the cabin. First, I saw the engine room, which has three sets of turbine engines. It is said that among the Chinese naval fleet, only the Yingrui and Zhaohao ships use turbine engines. The two ships were sister ships built at the same time. In addition, there are two freshwater generators, which are used to convert seawater into freshwater for boilers and drinking. Then, I visited the boiler room. There are six boilers, two with smoke tubes and four with water tubes. If all six boilers are fired at the same time, the temperature in the boiler room will be around one hundred degrees. Therefore, the air from the deck is drawn down to circulate, which can slightly reduce the heat.</p>
<p>▲ Six Torpedoes, Formidable Strength The Yingrui warship has six torpedoes, two of which are displayed on the deck and the remaining four are placed in the torpedo cabin. The torpedoes have a caliber of 18 inches and a length of about 20 feet. It is said that when the torpedoes are launched into the water, the striking plate combines with the water and air can penetrate, allowing the torpedo to move straight forward. Therefore, there are two car ribs on the back of the torpedo, one turning left and one turning right, to balance the torpedo body so that it can move straight forward.</p>
<h3>Travels in India (3)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Cleanliness is also unnecessary. Since it is assimilated with nature, it is practiced in the streets and parks. Naked immortals and those covered with a gray cloth are everywhere. They lie high in the style of the ancient emperors, their skin color like iron or copper. Sometimes they hold old scriptures and sing and chant alone, lying on the grass and roadsides, which is their home. Those lying in the streets sleep with the cattle, and people and cattle alike forget themselves and attain great liberation.</p>
<p>If we compare it with the old culture of China, China respects the elderly, serves in officialdom at forty, and takes office at fifty, so it is called the great old empire. But the Indians value old immortals and old philosophers. They are not only old, but also become enlightened. Therefore, the greatest teaching to China was Bodhidharma, and Bodhidharma was already one hundred and forty years old when he arrived in China, and he faced the wall for ten years, making him one hundred and fifty years old. He was truly a strange person. And the Chan Buddhism of internal enlightenment and the Shaolin boxing and swordsmanship and internal work in China are all entrusted to Bodhidharma, which may not be without reason (Bodhidharma's original name was Bodhitara, meaning "toward faith").</p>
<p>The two great old philosophers who are the leaders of India are also two old eccentrics. Tagore is already over seventy, and Gandhi is a few years younger. The Gandhi faction is more radical, and although it is said to be non-resistance, it gradually has armed people. Tagore has traveled all over the world and has just returned from Russia. This old man is also vigorous. Compared with India, Burma seems childish.</p>
<p>Burmese women are full of spring spirit in the streets, while in India, women are rarely seen in the markets, but the education sector has a strong influence. I feel that the Indian climate is from autumn and winter to liberation.</p>
<p>Previously, Gandhi was detained in a certain city prison in western India, near Mumbai. There were as many as five thousand detained patriots in various places, and dozens of women.</p>
<p>On the twenty-first, Tagore's niece, Sharada, visited her girls' school and went to her house for tea. Her display included Buddha statues, knives, swords, and Japanese paintings of women and Tagore's portraits, saying that her uncle would return to the country and I could wait for him, and that China would invite him to give lectures and I could also travel to China. Her son came out to see me and was studying law at the university. Her son told me that the young people in India today are willing to love their country and fight. Walking in the city, I saw groups of cattle traveling freely and tamely. An Indian told me that these were free cattle, allowed by people's vows to release them without work. I saw that many of the white cattle were pulling carts, and some were walking freely. Everywhere I saw that the white cattle were indeed fat, strong, and powerful, just as the Buddha said in the Lotus Sutra, "bigger than ordinary cattle, with correct horns." I then believed that the Buddha's observation of physics was indeed well-researched and not in vain. Only the custom of freeing cattle is also seen and heard in Burma, and I still had doubts. Now I am greatly relieved that they learned from India. Such cattle roam the streets, and I saw them sometimes eating people's merchandise, and indeed the merchants respected and trusted them and did not add punishment. But there is one thing: because there are many free cattle, they inevitably defecate on the streets, which seems to be detrimental to hygiene. When I walked, I sometimes stepped on them, but the Indians did not find it annoying. Because I read that the Buddha said that in Esoteric Buddhism, the mantra can only be accomplished if white cow dung is put into the mantra, then cow dung is not something to be despised.</p>
<p>Such morality is something that Chinese people cannot truly learn. However, this custom comes from Hinduism. Today, Hinduism is all over India, and its people do not believe in Buddhism. Taking the example of freeing cattle and refraining from killing living things, the doctrines of Hinduism must be very profound, on par with the Buddha. The Buddha emerged based on it. It is definitely not that the Buddha created such unprecedented philosophy alone. Laborism is prevalent in Russia, and everyone must work, but the Indians respect cattle and do not make them work, and they still survive. Will this be a symbol of Indian culture surpassing Russia in the future?</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Prices Rise Leisurely</h3>
<p>Progress is very orderly. Yesterday, March 23rd, the price of gold continued to rise sharply, exceeding the 700 tael mark. However, the waves seemed to have calmed down, and the market before and after each had a review of ten taels. People's hearts were stable and firm. The demand for supply from peers was very different from the previous market. Hengxing, Yuancheng, Fengyong, and others were all buyers, and speculators fiercely resisted the short selling. However, Fuchangyuan, Maoyongxin, Hengshengda, and Wu, etc., all had sales. Almost all exchange rates, both official and black market, were good, and the listed price was reduced by half a grade. Overseas silver market saw a low in the telegrams the day before yesterday, so the gold price opened high, flying more than ten taels. Subsequently, selling short positions was more active, tending to decline again. Afterward, major players bought enthusiastically, turning sharply to a high point, once reaching over 711 taels. Foreign exchange was especially beautiful. The subsequent market was firm to soft, with sellers diligent. The price retreated from 710 taels to just over 700 taels, with three or four taels of fluctuations. Finally, the calm state was estimated to be 704 taels.</p>
<p>The market opened and immediately rose sharply. Since the May opening in the morning was 707 taels, it increased by more than eleven taels. Almost all large amounts fell by a quarter. The price of silver in the forward market fell by three-sixteenths, and the private telegram also fell by one-half. Thus, people's hearts were greatly encouraged. For a moment, Fuchangyuan, Maoyongshengda, etc., came out, and British gold also saw an upward trend. HSBC sold June at 138.125, and Mitsubishi sold at 875, so it fell by more than six taels, only 701 taels. Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Chengcuichangyong, etc., came to buy, so it rose by more than three taels, estimated at 704 and a half taels. Then, it went down by one and a half taels.

Subsequently, Chenfengyong, Yu Dahenxingyuan and speculation entered in droves. In addition, the June British gold was taken by China Bank at 8125. The hedging companies rushed to settle, and 75 was issued from Taiwan. The gold price jumped by eight or nine taels. Around 10:30, it reached 710 taels. At this time, the demand for supply was uneven, and transactions were still smooth. However, Guangbang and Tongtaichang, etc., all had sales. The price fell by two or three taels at one o'clock, estimated at 07 taels and 5 or 6 qian, and the peak was seen again. Hengxingyuan, Qianchangxiang, Yongfeng and others chased in droves. Almost all nearby forward British gold settled at only 6875. Maihang Hefengsan and others all had sales. By 10:45, it actually reached 711 taels and 5 qian.

Suddenly, Fuchang and others bought in, and the price immediately rose to 05 taels and a half. Then, the retail investors sold out. At 3:30, it was 01 and a half taels. Suddenly, I heard that the Indian exchange rate had fallen slightly by two or three annas, and I immediately picked up to 05 taels. Unexpectedly, Hengxing and others did not slacken their intentions and sharply lowered the price by more than four taels. Magali and others issued June British gold at 8125.

<h3>Foreign Exchange, Both Official and Black Market, Is Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC listed prices for all exchanges were reduced by half a grade, probably because the British and American silver markets reported a fall the day before yesterday. The British gold was reduced by 125, now being 1 shilling and 3 and a half pence. The American gold was reduced by 25, now being 31 yuan and 375. The Indian exchange rate was 75, now being 86 rupees and 5. The French franc was 6 yuan, now being 802 yuan. The Wa Yang half dollar was 78 shields and 25.

The internal market trend of the banks was also tight. It had been strong since the morning, and then saw a decline. The gold price also withered, and then turned better. However, the spot gold had exceeded 710 taels. In the afternoon, it seemed to return to level, but the result was that compared with last Saturday, the British gold was reduced by 1875 and the American gold was reduced by 375.

Banks such as Shanghai, Huabi, HSBC, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Zhengjin, Taiwan, Dongya, and Maihang all had sales, but Zhejiang, Benjing, Sumitomo and others had slightly absorbed. There were also many back-to-back transactions among the banks. The American gold was about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. The Japanese gold was in an ordinary state. Observing the situation of various exchanges, it is feared that it will be difficult to rise for a while. It is really because the Chinese merchants are all short.</p>

<h3>There Are Signs of Progress in the Interest Rate</h3>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Active Sales in the Developing Yarn Market</h3>
<p>In Rapid Progress</p>
<p>Sales of cotton yarn have improved significantly, and buyers from various groups are very excited. The prices of imported yarns have risen sharply, which has boosted confidence in the market. Speculators, seeing the tense situation, have had to cut their losses, making the market more active. However, some dealers with large inventories are not willing to cover their positions and remain inactive. Although sellers have a sufficient supply to deliver this month, a major merchant is selling all of his yarn to Japanese weavers for shipment, so he is very determined to take delivery this month. Various groups that have been holding back for a long time have suddenly become active, making buyers more cautious. Chinese yarn is cheaper than foreign yarn, so powerful traders buy when prices fall, and the market has improved significantly. Based on the overall trend, it would not be surprising to see prices reach 175 or 176 taels.</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn Rises Sharply, Up More Than 3 Taels. The People's Standard Yarn market opened higher due to the strength of American cotton and good sales news, and the price rose sharply. Speculators covering their positions caused prices to rise by two taels and two or three cents in each month. In the afternoon, it was heard that imported yarn prices had risen sharply, and sales were brisk, with strong buying pressure. Prices rose by two taels and two or three cents. The total volume traded was 71,350 bales. Major sellers included Da Lai (2,050 bales), Mingde (1,300 bales), Yichang (1,150 bales), and Hengchang (1,050 bales). Major buyers included Shenxin (1,100 bales), Gongtai (2,400 bales), Yiyu (1,500 bales), Xiesheng (1,350 bales), and Xincheng (2,500 bales). The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn Closing Prices, Changes, and Open Interest People's Standard Yarn Closing Prices, Changes, and Open Interest</p>
<p>March   168.1   Up 3   16,300   June   171.3   Up 3.6   42,650</p>
<p>April   170.5   Up 3.3   29,150   July   171.1   Up 3.6   32,450</p>
<p>May   171.4   Up 3.3   37,100   August   170.8   Up 3.3   20,900</p>
<p>Sales of Spot Yarn Are Very Active. Statistics show that various groups bought a total of 3,300 bales throughout the day, and local and foreign firms took 2,900 bales. Prices rose by 2 to 3 taels. Among the out-of-town buyers, 850 bales went to the interior, 100 bales to Sichuan, 500 bales to Qingdao, 230 bales to Xiamen, 100 bales to Guangdong, 350 bales to Tianjin, 110 bales to Shantou, 100 bales to Yunnan, 100 bales to Ningbo, 100 bales to Southeast Asia, and 500 bales to various other regions. Tongyi and Chongxin sold 20 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Soars</h3>
<p>The cotton market is rising sharply, driven by the strength of American cotton, the decline in exchange rates, and the soaring yarn market. Customer sales are also expanding, which has stimulated sentiment and increased buying pressure. As a result, the cotton market has risen sharply. However, spot cotton trading is very quiet, and factory buyers are very hesitant, so the market is weaker than the yarn market. Nevertheless, bullish forces remain strong, it is said.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Rises by 1.3 Taels. The Hankou Standard market opened higher due to the rise in American cotton and the high gold prices, with strong buying pressure. Prices rose by 9 cents to 8 cents in each month. In the afternoon, prices rose by another 2 or 3 cents. The total volume traded was 141,600 dan. Major sellers included Jifeng (1,320 dan), Yicheng (3,100 dan), Yuanda (2,400 dan), and Yuda (1,800 dan), Tongxing (1,000 dan). Major buyers included Gengfeng (2,300 dan), Ruida (2,100 dan), Changfeng (4,600 dan), and Xincheng (4,900 dan). The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Closing Prices and Changes Open Interest May 41.05 Down 1.15 80,200</p>
<p>March 41.00 Down 1.3 36,500 June 41.00 Down 1.25 101,800</p>
<p>April 41.15 Down 1.25 64,600 July 41.05 Down 1.25 86,700</p>
<p>Spot Sales Remain Quiet. The spot cotton business is becoming increasingly sluggish, and factories are not buying. The source of supply is estimated to be 950 bales of Yao cotton and 270 bales of Tong cotton, it is said.</p>

<p>Correction: In the American cotton weekly report on Sunday, the private report that cotton fields had decreased by approximately 10% to 20% was mistakenly printed as 30% to 20%. This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>Weekly Report on British and Indian Cotton Industries</h3>
<p>Bombay: Last week, futures prices fell slightly following American cotton, and speculators sold heavily, but their positions were absorbed by European and Japanese exporters. Later, the market turned firm again due to changes overseas. The March contracts for Oomra and Bengal were particularly strong due to limited deliveries. Spot trading was moderate, with exporters buying Oomra for urgent European demand and strong Japanese demand. The statistics for the past week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1930   1931</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1st   2,474   2,278</p>
<p>Inventory at the end of the week   1,298   954</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1st   1,414   1,501</p>
<p>Exports to Europe   470   569</p>
<p>Exports to China   201   199</p>
<p>Exports to Japan   706   922</p>
<p>Exports to other regions   37   11</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot demand remains good. In the futures market, short covering and buying by retail investors was quite strong at the beginning of the week due to firm news from Alexandria and Bombay. Later, demand weakened. Although the American cotton ginning report was favorable to buyers, it failed to stimulate the market due to unfavorable news from New York. Egyptian cotton prices were firm due to news from Alexandria and reports on Nile River water levels.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Market Prices Trend Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, more than 20 rice dealers arrived. Sales were slightly more active. High-quality white japonica rice remained unaffected, while medium and lower-quality japonica rice generally weakened. The japonica rice market is now trending soft after being stagnant. Sales of sharp glutinous rice and thin rice were slow. Glutinous indica rice was very sluggish, and selling pressure was not strong. Prices did not change. The market for Du-jian and Bu-jian rice was stable. Trading in this rice was quiet and supply was scarce. The market for Bian-yuan and Yin-yuan rice remained stagnant. Only high-quality rice was still selling well, especially those priced around 12.5 yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, about 20 boats arrived from downriver. Sales in this market were not active. Demand for Changbang white rice was weak, and prices weakened. Small amounts of various Jiangsu japonica rice were delivered. The overall market was flat. Sales of Nanbang thin rice and early rice were average. The overall situation was that high-quality rice was stable and low-quality rice was soft. Sales of Yang-du and Jian-du rice were acceptable. This rice was not in abundant supply, so prices remained similar to previous levels. Demand for high-quality Bai-yuan rough rice was strong, so the market was firm. However, sales of Yin rice were sluggish and prices were slightly weak.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Cannot Be Expected to Rise Too High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially weakened and then stabilized. Prices for imported wheat did not fluctuate much, so prices for various months were weak. For example, the lowest price for the June contract was 2.99 yuan. Later, because outside buyers still had strong demand, most traders did not hesitate to buy at this low price. In the afternoon, because there were no factory sales, outside buyers were still active, so prices for distant months seemed to rise slightly. However, considering the overall environment, prices are not expected to rise too high. As a result, the current month was up 0.05 yuan from the previous weekend, April was up 0.025 yuan, May, June, and July were up 0.075 yuan, and August was up 0.01 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Forward Months of Wheat Are Unloaded</h3>
<p>Shipments to Xichang factories were stable this month</p>
<p>After the wheat futures market opened yesterday morning, the nearby months were stable. Because speculative activity in the forward months was unstable, unloading was quite active, so the prices were 0.02 to 0.03 yuan lower than the previous week. Trading was also quite active. In the afternoon, the flour market weakened and then recovered. The nearby months had already become weak and could not be stable. However, yesterday it was reported that Maoxin in Wuxi had to take delivery of ten to twenty lots in the current month, which caused the recent contracts to stabilize and the forward months to also rise. However, it is not yet known how much the Wuxi factory will actually take delivery. As a result, the current month was up 0.02 yuan from the previous week, April was up 0.01 yuan, May was down 0.02 yuan, June was down 0.01 yuan, and July and August were unchanged, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Local Raw Sugar Rises by 0.02 Yuan</h3>
<p>Prices of all sugars increase throughout the market</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no new reports from the sugar-producing areas. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce price for Dutch No. 24 granulated white sugar rose further due to the rising exchange rate, making the market more firm. Initially, buyers hesitated to buy at the asking price of 10.05 taels. Later, buyers became more active, and a small number of transactions took place at a price of 10.05 taels, up 0.015 yuan from the previous close. The asking price for No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 10 taels, but there were few inquiries. Trading in Japanese sugar was more active, and the market also gradually rose. NT was 10.03 taels, TK was 10.025 taels, YT mark was 10.02 taels, YP was 10.04 to 10.045 taels, YRO was 9.775 to 9.78 taels, and SH was 9.9 taels. Total trading volume was more than 2,000 bags, and the market was firm. Due to the rising prices of raw materials and coarse granulated white sugar, the market for local raw sugar also turned positive. Shanghai factories opened sales of several hundred bags of Ren-character brand sugar at a price of 13.07 taels and Gan-character brand sugar at a price of 13.06 taels, up 0.02 yuan from the previous close. At the same time, other factories also raised their prices by 0.02 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Model Factory Unable to Meet Demand</h3>
<p>The white filature silk produced by the first and second class model factories in Zhejiang and Hubei is reeled in accordance with the latest methods, resulting in even and strong threads, which are very popular with European and American silk factories. The output cannot meet the demand. Yesterday, 30 bales of model factory white filature silk were delivered to a foreign firm, it is said.</p>
<h3>Luzhuang High-Grade Green Tea Sales Are Brisk in France</h3>
<p>Yesterday, orders for high-grade green tea from Luzhuang and Suian, including Chunmee tea, were received from the French Moroccan market. Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and other firms began to search for supplies, and the market was slightly more active. Total sales of Chunmee and Pearl tea were 742 boxes. Chunmee sold for 36 to 70 taels, and Hyson sold for 36 to 37 taels, which was slightly higher than last week. There were no transactions in other items such as Needle-leaf and Showmee teas, it is said.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Current Situation Is Improving Daily</h3>
<p>Local Cotton Cloth: The market has been gradually rising in recent days, and sales to customers have improved. Because the weather is getting warmer, fine cloth and fine twill are now in season. Since the Sanchang factory stopped weaving, striped cloth has become scarce and is selling well. Yesterday, fine cloth rose by another 0.025 yuan. Trumpet brand was selling for 7.4 yuan, Yanghe for 7.375 yuan, Blue Double Fish for 7.45 yuan, and Blue Chicken for 7.075 yuan. Fine twill rose by 0.05 yuan, Yanghe was 7.3 yuan, and Blue Double Fish was 7.175 yuan. Coarse cloth from Hengfeng has generally risen by about 0.01 yuan. Horse-feeding cloth was 7.1 yuan, and Double Eagle was 6.65 yuan. The spot supply of Five Cranes is exhausted, and sales are very brisk in this market, it is said.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods: The falling market trend has stopped. Since the price of gold has rebounded, sentiment has stabilized in the East piece goods market. Yuan cloth has risen by about 0.01 yuan. Yesterday, Dian Qiuxiang returned to 10.05 taels, and Yuanji Meiren was 10.035 taels. The demand for white bottom colored drill from the Changjiang gang was very strong. Wolonggang was selling for 0.0245 yuan, and Shou Lao was 0.024 yuan. The price of Zhigong wool and Hunting Geese and Moganshan increased by 0.005 yuan. However, because of the large supply of in-stock second-grade fine broadcloth, it is still difficult to see improvement. Because Yuan Guang twill is used to make umbrellas, it is selling very well. Fengbo Pavilion was 7.8 yuan, Xiaoyaojin was 7.4 yuan, and Huan Taizi and Tianwubao were both 6.65 yuan. Sales of Western style poplin were slightly quiet, and sales of Taffeta are becoming more active, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zhigong Wool Is Scarce and Selling Very Well</h3>
<p>The sales of Yuan Qing Zhigong wool have been very brisk in the past week. Customers have been purchasing it for boxes and piece goods. However, the arrival of new goods has been limited, and existing stocks have been exhausted, so supply cannot meet the demand. The market price has been gradually rising. Single Zhigong, which previously sold for 2.45 yuan, has now risen to 3.8 or 3.9 yuan. The 5-tael frame material is particularly scarce. The only material currently sold in the market is Deki brand 2488 Four Virtues, which sells for 4.9 yuan per box, with an additional 0.05 yuan for loose pieces. It costs 5 taels for return and credit, it is said.</p>

<p>Book Introduction</p>
<h3>The History of Imperialists' Shipping Industry Development in China</h3>
<p>— By Man Yin</p>
<p>—Written by Zhang Xin-cheng—</p>
<p>The development of imperialism is due to the prosperity of overseas trade. The prosperity of overseas trade relies on convenient transportation as its engine. If transportation is underdeveloped, and transportation is inconvenient, even if vast commercial markets are found, the surplus commodities cannot be sold overseas. In that case, imperialism would certainly not have developed to its current form. Therefore, since the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century, the steam engine has flourished, and trains and ships have emerged. The latter is the most important. Indeed, the current world transportation has progressed from inland rivers and coastal areas to the competition of ocean shipping. It is truly enough to determine the life and death of imperialists.</p>
<p>Looking at the recent rivalry between Japan and the United States for leadership in the Pacific, and the brewing of conflicting interests between France and Italy in the Mediterranean, while our powerful British imperialism is busy building a military port in Singapore to maintain its power in the Far East, these clearly tell us that imperialism and shipping are inseparably linked. It is like the relationship between a healthy human body and circulating blood. If we open the history of imperialist development, we will surely find that most, almost the entire book, is pages of competition in the shipping industry among imperialists.</p>
<p>Since the close relationship between the development of the shipping industry and imperialism is as described above, what is its relationship with colonies and weak nations? This is very clear: imperialism relies on the development of the shipping industry as a weapon to invade and exploit colonies. For their own sake, colonies will naturally have the idea of resisting and rejecting this unexpected gift of invasion and exploitation. At the same time, they must also strive to be alert and improve their own shipping industry, because merely knowing how to resist foreign countries without knowing how to rectify oneself is not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>China is a semi-colony, and the Chinese people are one of the world's weak nations. This is an undeniable fact. The oppression and aggression that China has suffered from imperialism are innumerable, especially in the economic aspect, which is the most alarming. Since trading with imperialists, China's average annual loss has been more than twenty or thirty million yuan. Such a huge amount is the gift of imperialist merchant ships entering and leaving the Huangpu River. Therefore, to protect this large amount of overflowing rights and interests, undoubtedly, in addition to (1) levying protective tariffs and (2) striving to develop the national shipping industry, the remaining tasks are to find ways to resist foreign merchant ships entering and leaving and to recover the right to navigate inland rivers and coastal areas.</p>
<p>How can we find ways to resist foreign merchant ships entering and leaving and recover the right to navigate inland rivers? Regarding this, we need to look at the book "The History of Imperialists' Shipping Industry Development in China" written by Zhang Xin-cheng.</p>
<p>In the author's preface at the beginning of the book, the author has these few sentences:</p>
<p>"...Since the opening of our country to the sea, the advantages and disadvantages of steamships have been both positive and negative. The various material civilizations and political theories of Europe and the United States could not have been imported to benefit us without steamships as a convenient tool for transportation. However, the imperialists, with their aggressive strategies, came with the steamships, causing our country to suffer from political and economic oppression, which is also a gift from the evil steamship demon... We laugh at this demon fighting, but it is already baring its fangs and claws in our territory, sucking our blood. Recently, we have frequently heard calls to revise treaties and recover navigation rights. If we cannot achieve this goal and use this civilized tool ourselves to benefit our country's transportation development and our country's industry, then the guest will become the master. The tools of others, both inside and outside our country, will be enough to become demons to us. If we want to use this tool, we must study how others use it. If we want to study, we do not need to seek far away. The shipping industry of various countries in China is more than ours and has a deep relationship, which is also enough for us to study, and is what we must study."</p>
<p>From this, we can know the author's intention and the purpose of this book. Of course, this is acknowledged by everyone. Sun Tzu said, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." If we do not know how others fight, how can we fight them? At the same time, if we do not know the real situation of the imperialists' shipping industry in China and only shout to recover navigation rights, how can this succeed? Therefore, this book truly has the value of sacrificing a little of this journal's valuable space to introduce it.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into twelve chapters: Chapter 1: General Introduction; Chapter 2: British Shipping in China; Chapter 3: Japanese Shipping in China; Chapter 4: The United States; Chapter 5: Germany, gradually extending to Norway, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia. Each country is described in a separate chapter, and each chapter is further divided into several sections. In the first section, "Introduction," of the first chapter, "General Introduction," we are told that the total loss of China due to foreign merchant ships working in China in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China was about 1.8 billion yuan. The second section, "A Brief History of the Evolution," provides a concise description of the loss of China's navigation rights, which can be called a history of the imperialists' initial aggression against China's shipping industry. The third section, "Number of Import and Export Ships Since the Republic of China," includes many clear tables. The fourth section, "General Overview of Shipping," provides a concise description of the shipping industry in the Republic of China over the years, which is very concise. The sixth section, "Overview of Import and Export Ships in the Sixteenth Year of the Republic of China," and the fifth section, "Comparison of the Shipping Power of Britain and Japan in China," both have detailed charts, making them clear at a glance.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is dedicated to British shipping in China, and Chapter 3 is dedicated to Japan, with a particularly detailed description, accounting for almost half of the total content of the book. This is because Britain is the hegemon of the sea and ranks first in the development of shipping in China. Japan is a rising star, and its development is also astonishing. Both have a situation of "the guest becoming the master" in China's shipping industry. Therefore, it is natural for this book to have more discussion about them. If we read carefully, we can indeed have a very clear impression of the shipping situation of the two countries in China. For example, the more famous shipping companies such as British Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Henderson, China Navigation Company, Ewo, and Changxing, and Japanese Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, their business changes, the number of ships they own, the routes they sail, and the current operating situation, all give us a very accurate and clear answer. In addition, the same is true for countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and the United States.</p>
<p>The so-called "giving us a very accurate and clear answer" here is precisely the performance of the work of "knowing ourselves" and "knowing the enemy." Now that China's unification and political tutelage have begun, for the convenience of transportation in the construction of the entire China, for resisting imperialist aggression, and even more for the development of the national shipping industry, then of course this book is really necessary to read. The value of this book can only be found in this.</p>
<p>Secondly, this book describes how various imperialists exclude and antagonize the shipping industries of other imperialists in order to develop their own shipping industry. Their kind of competitive spirit of "struggling with each other" and their enterprising spirit are really beyond our reach. In other words, it is what we should emulate. For example:</p>
<p>"In 1753 AD, Britain enacted the Navigation Subsidy Act. After the outbreak of the European War, the shipbuilding industry stagnated, and merchant ships often sank. Therefore, great progress was made in encouraging navigation, resulting in five major measures: 1. State-run marine insurance; 2. Prohibition of merchant ship exports; 3. State-ordered charter fees; 4. State-run ships; 5. State-run shipyards. After the ceasefire, the British government allowed private operation of the navigation business except for Australia and Canada. In 1920, the government established a Navigation Committee to review the petitions of the navigation industry and the issues raised by the主管官廳, and to guide unification and improvement methods..." pages 59-60</p>
<p>"In 1875, it was decided that the shipping industry should be privately operated with state subsidies. After the Sino-Japanese War, Japan used the indemnity from our country for航一八九六年 to formulate the Navigation Encouragement Law and the Shipbuilding Encouragement Law. There were subsidies for航行中国綫, 南洋綫, 印度綫 and 欧洲綫... After the ceasefire of the European War, efforts were made to subsidize the shipbuilding industry in order to achieve its purpose and abolish it. Therefore, import tariffs were exempted for shipbuilding materials, and the iron and steel industry was subsidized to indirectly subsidize shipbuilding..."</p>
<p>This is what our government should emulate.</p>
<p>Looking at their company's operating methods and the changes in business development is also what our comrades engaged in the shipping industry should emulate. There are many descriptions about this in the book. I will not cite examples here to save space.</p>
<p>In short, this book is a beneficial book that should be read, whether it is used to understand the development of the imperialists' shipping industry in China, used for comrades who want to develop the national shipping industry and resist imported goods, or even used for a citizen's responsibility in China. Because we see imperialists' ships traveling unimpeded in inland rivers and coastal areas, their invasion of our sovereignty is so great that all of us Chinese people can't help but urgently think about ways to resist it?</p>

<p>Women's Life</p>
<h3>The Life of Professional Women in New York</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>(3) Living Expenses</p>
<p>Anyone who does not know the cost of living in New York will be surprised when they see the cost of living in New York. Newcomers can't imagine that rent is so high and food is so expensive, not to mention entertainment expenses and doctor's fees. Although the salary seems to be very generous, their life is still very difficult.</p>
<p>Take rent as an example. A woman who makes a living by working can live in downtown New York or in the suburbs. First, let's talk about the various living conditions in the city, which allow people to choose freely. She can live in a hotel, inn, boarding house, or shared apartment. The cost of high-end hotels is very high. Today's residential hotels in New York are very popular. The most distinctive one has a large swimming pool, billiard room, bowling alley, library, social room, etc. Professional women living in such places can come and go as they please. Her bedroom is cleaned by servants. Every time she uses the phone, she has to pay ten cents. The maid who serves her must be given a small tip. Laundry fees are extra. The place to eat outside can be chosen at will. If she dines in her own room, a tip is given separately. She also has to pay to use the sports venue. The monthly rent for a small bedroom with a bathroom in this kind of upscale hotel ranges from one hundred and five gold dollars to one hundred and fifty gold dollars. The cost of a suite is doubled. In this kind of hotel, women can entertain guests and invite friends of both sexes in their rooms. New York does not like to correct excessive behavior. Hotel managers know that upper-class people do not need exceptional rules to limit their actions. For a professional woman whose earnings exceed the average salary, this kind of hotel life is nothing. Many hotels are under construction and have the comfort of a club to make adjustments.</p>
<p>The price of a shared apartment in New York ranges from sixty-five yuan to five hundred yuan per month. "Village" houses like "Greenwich Village" are such a lovely place. It is very comfortable for professional women to live there, but the rent is also considerable. Many old houses have become the glorious achievements of New York's past and have mostly been converted into shared apartments. High ceilings, exquisite woodwork, and stoves are all features of this style of house. Kitchens are rarely larger than small pantries, or only some places are shielded in the corner and considered a kitchen. Fortunately, little girls, except for "Saturday's children," don't know what it's like to cook on the stove. The rent for a single room in a village-style shared apartment is from sixty-five yuan to ninety yuan per month, a double room is from eighty-five yuan to one hundred and fifty yuan, and a three-room apartment is from one hundred and twenty-five yuan to two hundred and twenty-five yuan. Electricity, gas, and telephone are extra. Many shared apartments have water heaters that only use gas. In winter, the monthly cost is often around fifteen yuan. The telephone bill is four yuan and fifty cents for sixty calls a month (five cents extra for each call beyond sixty). The monthly electricity bill for a double room of average size is about two yuan and a half. Village-style shared apartments have a beautiful and lovely environment and are also very convenient. They are not far from the Wall Street district. A five-cent subway or elevated train can go back and forth. It is also close to the theater district. It takes ten minutes to reach Fifth Avenue. The bus fare is ten cents directly to Washington Square, which is the spiritual center of village-style shared apartments.</p>
<p>The best residential locations are Riverside Drive and Upper Fifth Avenue, such as Gramercy Park Apartments, etc., which are exceptionally elegant, but the rent is too high for even professional women with high salaries to easily afford. The annual rent ranges from three thousand six hundred yuan to twenty-five thousand yuan.</p>
<p>In Brooklyn or the Bronx, you can find cheap shared apartments with very low rents, but people who live in these areas spend a long time traveling back and forth on the subway every day. Women who work eight hours a day are not willing to spend two more hours traveling to and from the office. The social life in Brooklyn and the Bronx is narrow and boring. In addition to family visits, there is very little other social interaction. Professional women generally do not like a secluded life. If her residence is too far away, it is very inconvenient to invite friends. The living conditions in boarding houses and apartments in New York are slightly worse. In small cities, people often invite guests to live with them. In New York, homeowners rarely have extra rooms to rent. Therefore, the so-called apartments are inevitably old, lack style, and the furniture is not very elegant. The rent for a non-boarding dormitory in New York City is from eight yuan to twenty yuan per week (to be continued).</p>

<h3>Bi, I Bless You</h3>
<p>Is it a vague dream? I don't believe this is real. My own misfortune is like a fleeing soldier wandering to Shanghai. I have been here for half a year without realizing it. In these six months, I have been running around for life. There has not been a day of full enjoyment. My gloomy mood has always been like the twilight of dusk. Who knew there was an even more unfortunate Bi, whom we called little sister. According to Hua Mei's letter, because her home was robbed by bandits, she is now forced by life to work as a teacher for children in a rural primary school. Her brilliant future will henceforth be occupied by boundless darkness.</p>
<p>I reopened that page of letter paper, as if I was sure that there would be no such news in the letter. But as soon as it touched my eyes, those few lines jumped into my eyes first. I was afraid to read on, so I threw it forcefully on the table and shifted my gaze. I stared at the dim street lights and the sparse pedestrians outside the window. I took a deep breath, as if to blow away a cloud of sorrow that had gathered in my heart.</p>
<p>A white woman's face flashed out of the dark corner, with rose-like blushes on her cheeks. Suddenly, the roaring sound of a car's horn wailed. This beautiful illusion disappeared, leaving me with rapidly throbbing heartstrings.</p>
<p>I wish I could fly back to my hometown and immediately take Hua Mei's hand and ask if Bi's intoxicating smile still had a smile, and even more to ask if she was still jumping like a little sparrow. But this mountain and river that separates us, I want to curse you for being too cruel.</p>
<p>After standing blankly for a while, I picked up the letter paper from the bed again like a madman and excitedly read, "Brother Wen, this is beyond your expectations, right? Our group of big children is scattered too pitifully. Now Bi has become a teacher for children (because..." When I read to the reason, I hatefully threw it away again. In the surging tide of sorrow, memories of the past welled up.</p>
<p>It was one day during summer vacation in my hometown last year. Taking advantage of the cool morning when the sun had not yet shone on the center of the street, I slowly walked to Hua's house, whom I had not met for a month, to ask when Hua's brother would return home for summer vacation, because he was my childhood classmate many years ago. Now it has been a whole year since I last saw him. In quiet moments, I often think of him.</p>
<p>When I walked to Hua's house, sticky beads of sweat seeped out of my forehead. When I lifted the hanging door curtain, I saw at a glance a strange girl leisurely leaning back in her chair reading a book. I suppressed my rapid breathing and whispered, "Hua." She turned her face to look at me for a moment, then hurriedly threw the pen she was holding in her hand on the table and jumped happily from the chair, greeting me and saying,</p>
<p>"Wen, are you here? Why haven't you come for so long? I was just about to write a letter to ask you to come and play. If it weren't for Sister Bi, I would really be bored to death." When Hua said "Sister Bi," she turned her face to look at the girl. The girl raised her head in surprise, smiled, and nodded gently to me. I also nodded blankly.</p>
<p>After Hua's introduction, I learned that she was Hua's classmate. After I sat in the chair next to the table, the girl hurriedly went out. I thought she was shy. When Hua handed me a cigarette, I asked carelessly,</p>
<p>"Hua, why did Ms. Bi run out? Is she shy?"</p>
<p>Hua laughed with a puff and lit a match, as if mocking my lack of understanding, and said,</p>
<p>"Hmph, is she shy? I'm afraid you're not as generous as she is." After pondering for a moment, Hua continued, "She'll be back soon."</p>
<p>I exhaled a mouthful of smoke, smiled, and didn't deny her words. Then Hua said a torrent of words like a storm. She told me that her brother would not be back this summer vacation and told me that she had bought a lot of lake lotus roots, peeled them, and invited many friends to eat...</p>
<p>Hua was still talking endlessly when Ms. Bi jumped in, holding a large package of food in her hands. Suddenly, the table was cluttered with Ms. Bi's belongings. Ms. Bi pointed at the things on the table and told me to eat, but I was secretly immersed in her intoxicating smile that had penetrated deep into my heart.</p>
<p>It was really as Hua said, she was so generous that I couldn't describe it. She asked questions without hesitation. I didn't know how to answer her. When I couldn't say anything, she covered her mouth and laughed, making me a little embarrassed and uneasy. Her letter-like attitude didn't seem like it was the first time we had met. I felt a strange joy in my heart. Seeing that I was silent, she jumped up from her chair again, smiled, and said,</p>
<p>"Mr., shall I sing a song for you to listen to?" She walked in front of me.</p>
<p>I clapped my hands to express my welcome, and she began to sing. Her melodious voice was like the sound of a piano, making people feel intoxicated. Hua also echoed the singing. While I was listening quietly, I thought of Bi and Hua's innocence. I felt that they were the luckiest darlings in the world...</p>
<p>I can't bear to think about the happy gatherings from then on. In just half a year, the changes in our group of big children were too unexpected. But the rampant bandits were the main reason why we were scattered.</p>
<p>A biting cold wind blew in from outside the window. I slumped back in the chair. Bi's shadow gradually unfolded again. From my intricate thoughts, I blurted out these trembling words:</p>
<p>Bi, I bless you.</p>
