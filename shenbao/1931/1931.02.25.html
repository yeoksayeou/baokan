<p>（本報記者文初二月十三日自馬尼拉寄）</p>
<p>▲足球隊第七次戰……三比○慘敗於拉撒隊</p>
<p>以六戰五勝一和之曁大常勝軍、滿擬最終與打成和局拉　隊再戰、摧此强敵、爲竟全功、孰料竟出吾人意外之外、而且其　敗情形、亦非一般觀衆意料所及、此信或者伴諸健兒同日到滬上、吾甚不願以此不幸消息、傳達於閱者諸者眼簾、减却歡迎者之高興、然爲紀載詳實起見、又不可以不書、况戰敗乃兵家常事、經此一次教訓、或多一次經騐、則此回稍有挫折、未始非他日大成功之藴蓄、若然、則此慘敗之戰、吾雖不願下筆、其情形固値得紀錄也、</p>
<p>▲敵方抱必勝决心</p>
<p>自第一戰打成和局、其後我軍四戰皆勝、敵方時領於每戰皆臨陣參勸、研究我所長者何衞、最强悍者何人深料五塲完後、必有繼續比賽、卽每日不斷的訓練、至續賽日期確定後更組織啦啦隊、以爲打氣、藉壯軍心、故由校中出資購半折人門券五百張、分送在校學生、出席助威、未出塲以前、啦啦隊卽鳴金　鼓、大吹大擂、高唱得勝之歌、爲亂我軍之心、以孤軍遠征、在此鼓衰力竭之餘、雖偶爾挫敗、亦屬事理之常、况其豐功偉績固猶在在者乎、</p>
<p>▲三分鐘敵開紀錄</p>
<p>十三日下午三時開賽上半塲擇門照像後、特請美國狐狸公司影戲明星來菲島旅行之ＧeorgeO·Brien開球、戰事遂開、我方前鋒諸將、隨球進展、至中衞被敵將球陽出、球遂在中央往來不定、雙方正力爲斡旋、敵左内鋒忽韯球前進、在十餘碼前、對我球門猛射、謝全和救護不及、斯時觀衆中之啦啦除、大得其意狂唱得勝之歌矣</p>
<p>▲我軍力反攻無效</p>
<p>我方雖失此一球、努力反攻、有一次羅家將因後方傳送、在敵方猛射、被敲門將接踢、黑將軍趕上、加上一脚、亦被踢出、蓋此二球皆有人城機會、無如彼方鐵城門、猶是前日死守琢州城之傳將軍也、</p>
<p>▲謝全和功不可没</p>
<p>敵方旣受此二次壓逼、因彼旣先操勝着、大展其遠送工夫、一連三次、向我方進逼對準城門連射擊三次、均爲此新任鎭守使謝將軍救出、卽　方亦皆鼓掌稱諸、乃未幾江善敬因奮勇拒敵、川背撞倒彼前鋒軍、被罰十二碼球、亦爲謝將軍跪地救出、其功誠不可没也、</p>
<p>▲可惜又失好機會</p>
<p>戴中鋒乘謝全和打出之球、飛奔前進、過前衞線、傳交與右路伏軍陳秉祥、陳帶至戲門左角暫行猛射因過高未入網、我方由此逼得角球、由梅洪寳挑送、落點正對敵門、被門將奮拳擊出、眞使僑界觀衆無任歎息、</p>
<p>▲彼有幸而我不幸</p>
<p>兩方再拚力激戰、彼方得角球機會、由彼右翼主踢、右内鋒蓄勢以待　用頭頂人、遂成二與○之比、至上半塲將完結時、黑將軍得後方傳遞　長驅直入、離門十餘　卽向右猛　、斯時敵門將亦應接不及、乃球撞門柱轉向外趨、梅洪寳趕至已被敵方救出上半塲遂以結束、</p>
<p>▲三球皆錯過機會</p>
<p>休息旣過、易地再戰、我方出全力拚命、欲爭回失地、故守二城之馮江兩將、皆冒險越過敵地、預備衝鋒、一次戴中鋒與黑將軍、由後方送來一球兩虎將互相傳遞、兼程并進、斬關直入、直反掌間事、又被敵鐵門神所阻、戴中鋒截得激出之球、再傳交黑將軍、黑將軍傳與符和萱、符踢射時、又被鐵門神擊出、黑將軍乘勢再施足力、球已入網、評判員判以越界取消、此一不幸也、混戰未幾、戴中鋒從左又踢入一球、同時被敵後鋒衝倒面部、評判員判踢進之球、越位無效、此二不幸也、又因敵方猛力衝人、判罰十二碼球、戴中鋒主踢、又以立功心急、過高越網、此三不幸也、記者觀至此、幾手足爲冷、正如當時諸葛先生火燒葫蘆谷司馬　父子、皆身　重園、坐以待斃、乃天不祚漢、電雨交加、致令司馬氏父子、安然生還、讀三國演義至此、皆廢書三歎、當日觀此兩球旣入、被判無效、一罰球又不落網、氣憤出塲者甚多也</p>
<p>▲征塵滾滾究無功</p>
<p>我方旣失此三球機會、雖前鋒五虎、與中鋒三猛、努力馳騁、冀挽殘局、在下半塲二十五分鐘中、差不多有三十分鐘、皆在敵疆行總攻擊、無如心旣忙亂、發球卽不準確、界次得角球、及對中施射機會、非失之稍高、卽差之稍偏　眞所謂六出祁山、未得寸土、徒使諸健兒勞而無功觀、衆望而歎氣、惜哉惜哉、</p>
<p>▲將收塲時又失機</p>
<p>當此全軍遠出、後方空虛、在戰衞上固甚危險、果然距完塲五六分鐘前敵、前鋒得球、從右方襲進、一時馳救不及、又被進一球、故遂以三與、之比宣佈大敗、</p>
<p>▲勝不可恃恃必敗</p>
<p>以孤軍遠出連載皆捷、自非有特出技能、　克至此、然拿　　具席捲歐洲雄風、卒敗於俄羅斯、恃勝而驕、亦卽春秋時若敖狃於蒲騷之役也、當顧問團歡迎之夜、予聞一球員談論其　次戰功、言及拉撒隊、則謂因初至時、敵情及種種未知、故打成平手、此後再戰、則勝之祗在舉足間、此雖不能代表全體球員心理、然若多數持爲必勝、則未免輕敵矣而且停戰十餘天、無相當球塲可以練習、視敵方不斷的訓練、亦爲失敗之一因、因此一敗、而更　制敵良方、則此一着失敗益我良多矣、</p>
<p>▲民意爲成功後循</p>
<p>僑衆不明續賽之委備者、幾全體反對此次比賽、其絶大理由、皆　五　一和四勝、可謂戰績美滿、就此戰譽而歸、若何興會淋漓、故自繼續比賽消息傳出、靑年會宿舍話責難之聲、聞日有數十起、此　日之觀衆、在僑界亦甚少數、則諸球員勇往直前之氣、似亦爲之少挫、因小喻大彼擁重兵以劃地稱雄、苟失民意爲擁戴、亦宜其不　　而敗也、</p>

<p>▲運貨公開合作</p>
<p>▲補助弱小輪業</p>
<p>各路航輪、漸趨合作化、去歲滬甬綫内四公司、實施聯合以來、營業大盛、收入增加、今年仍繼續同盟、惟將辦法略爲更變、原定以八十分攤派四家者、本年改爲四十一分攤派之、寗紹得十一分、太古三北招商各得十分、嗣後滬台班六輪、亦仿照此法、聯合經營、不特泯除營業上之爭端、且使水脚上增多不少收入、查長江一路、近年經營者日多、船亦日加、太古怡和日淸招商三北寗紹等六公司、向來有一水脚公會、但徒有名無實、水脚不一、徒使各公司暗虧、今六公司於長江一路、亦有同盟合作之大聯合、昨日已在會議、亟將此事概梗、詳查如後、</p>
<p>▲太古倡議　長江輪船、以太古公司最多、近鑒水脚同盟、毫無效力、各公司濫放運費、使客家便宜、常此辦理、江輪難於維持、遂提議由水脚同盟、進而爲營業同盟、按照寗波班成例、六公司實行公開營業同盟聯合、乃將此意徵取五家意見、結果、怡和日淸招商三北及寗紹等一致表示贊同、遂於昨日、邀集各公司代表、到太古開首次討論會議</p>
<p>▲會商辦法　昨日六公司各派負責代表、至太古公司、討論長江營業同盟合作辦法、先由太古代表陳述合作之利益、與不聯合的前途之危險、次將所擬之合作辦法出示、大致長江營業、當按照六家所有船隻及班次攤派、對船少之小公司、更予以扶助、例如老寗紹輪可裝一千噸貨、而祇裝到五百噸、則由其他五公司、合貼二百五十噸、俾不致虧耗、實行以後、各輪出口貨艙單、互相交閱、或每月平均一次、或三月統計一次、其詳細辦法、俟二次大會議决之、</p>
<p>▲代表意見　此項同盟營業、在長江爲破天荒之　倉、其實行期至少一年、施行以後、可使水脚不濫跌、在客家則按價納費、更無倫減運量等事、收回暗損、　給輪局、最爲合算、日淸代表、對於期限上主張不必規定年期、隨時可以解散、討論結果、第一期爲九個月、在九個月以後、　績與否、儘此三個月内、通告議定之、招商代表提出、對船少公司、應特别予以補助、均表同情、</p>
<p>▲會外輪船　除六公司之外、長江線内尚有英商祥泰·美商捷江·華商肇興·及南華等輪公司、亦有所謂野鷄班長江船者、當時各代表提議應否請其一致加入、結果、以上述各輪公司並無正班江輪、而所有船　、不若六公司全部三分之一、與同盟營業上、絶無妨碍、故不必要求加入、議畢、卽行散會、</p>
<p>▲運費問題　金漲以後、各輪暗虧至鉅、</p>
<p>長江水脚、在淺水前、已漲一成半、至淺水時又漲一成半、照例三月一日、淺水費應廢止、茲經各代表提議、在同盟以後、此淺水費擬不取消、而另須再加一成半、川照原額將增十分之三矣、此問題留俟二次會議、實施同盟辦法時、再行取决、</p>

<p>▲因漢口行營一電而發生</p>
<p>▲洪不待拘捕到捕房自首</p>
<p>▲昨解法院洪述被嫌經過</p>
<p>▲偵查結果當庭准予交保</p>
<p>▲洪深赴捕房自首　復旦曁南兩大學教授洪深、（字淺哉）去年八月間、與其友田漢等在公共祖界威海衞略賃屋創辦現代學藝研究所、洪任所長、旋經當道查得該所係反動派所組織、知照特區地方法院封閉、以遏亂萌、事隔半載、以爲不至再有問題發生、不意陸海空軍駐漢行營參謀處、近忽查悉洪深亦該所反動一份子、以洪住於租界、應向領團引渡、特咨請外交部依法辦理、外部因租界已　有正式法院、自可逕行審判、爰轉令江蘇高等法院第二分院、拘洪到案訊究、高分院首席檢察官王振南、立發拘票、交總巡捕房拘提、惟洪住法租界、未能直接執行、而已爲洪所聞、乃延同詹紀鳳律師、於前日午後二時半、赴捕房自首、</p>
<p>▲第一次開偵查庭　昨晨解送高分院第一刑庭、到庭旁聽者甚衆、此案初步手續、須付偵查、故由王首席檢察官升座審問、普通法院偵查庭例不公開、租界情形逈殊、依照收回法權所訂協定、偵查庭亦得公開、且許可律師出庭、但律師僅能陳述意見、不得辯論、是以洪之律師詹紀鳳、捕房律師甘鏡先、均相繼出庭、而高分院之開偵查庭、自成立以來、此尚屬第一次也、</p>
<p>▲田漢邀我任所長　王檢察官訊據洪供原籍常州、年三十八歲、家住法租界蒲石路、關於現代學藝研究所事經過詳細、容我縷述、緣我對於戲劇頗有研究、在社會略負時　、常有學校來聘我任董事或校長等情、然我皆予拒却、獨於戲劇學校接受之、此蓋爲我之所好耳、田漢與歐陽予倩俱爲戲劇家、同係我友、歐陽氏已受廣東省政府主席陳銘樞之聘、赴粤創辦戲劇研究社附設戲劇學校、并函聘我爲校長、翌年田漢與其友人欲組織現代學藝研究所、請我担任所長、以資號召、因情難却、始允之、惟聲明不負責任、</p>
<p>▲搜查三小時之久　田之經濟</p>
<p>頗拮据、所中器具、均係借用、該所房租、月須二百元、而所中衩祗允一百五十元、旋由我調停、言定月租一百六十元、該所課目分四類、卽戲劇·社會·文學·美術、我担任戲劇、田任文學、楊志銘任社會、而一許姓則任美術、及至開學、詎習戲劇者、竟無一人、我甚灰心、乃改任教授「發音及演說」一課、然學生多不願受我訓迪故僅赴所二三次、上課一次、餘事概不顧問、厥後田漢主辦之南國劇社、有學生一名、在南京爲衞戍司令部捕去、田之寓所、亦在本埠法租界、曾經警備部會同法捕房派員至田家搜查、獲書籍數本、并逮捕兩人、復來我家搜查、因我有極多之書籍、當日搜查歷三小時之久、</p>
<p>▲脫離關係之經過　嗣我具呈市黨部、聲明不能以友人故而負刑事責任、市黨部當時勸告我與該所脫離關係、十月五日、我卽遵勸辭退所長名義、並所任各大學教授亦辭却之、後於十月七日登報聲明從此脫離學界生活、專爲明星編劇、嗣該所因有反動行爲、被官廳封閉詎房東竟向我追索、所欠房租、曾延律師與房東交涉、聲明與該所毫無關係、且租屋時、曾經他人訂有合同、並有正當商店担保、令其向保人理論、我對所中職員祇識朱某其人、現在杭治病、</p>
<p>▲曾到京晤陳立夫　王檢察官訊以中央黨部將汝處分、係爲何事、洪供亦卽本案事件、中央黨部秘書長陳立夫君且命我晋京面詢、乃於十二月十七八之間、與市黨部監委朱應鵬同去、晤陳君後、甚蒙優待、旋聞已將我之處分撤銷、庭上又訊以據該所學生云、所中研究者爲馬克斯主義、然乎、洪供、我對所内一切旣不聞問、完全不知、庭上旋將英文講義給閱、訊洪見過否、洪供素未閱見、並稱市黨部之勸告、與該所脫離情形、今可由市執委兼社會局長潘公展證明一切、</p>
<p>▲潘公展在庭作證　時潘局長獨坐於旁聽席聽審、王首席檢察官卽命庭丁詢問在座旁聽之市政府社會局局長潘公展、願否到案作證、潘局長示可、並卽至見證欄、報告姓名年籍職業畢、王檢察官遂對潘曰、本院因奉外交部轉陸海空軍總司令部駐漢行營參謀處公文、謂洪深創辦現代學藝研究所、秘密訓練共産黨、頃據洪深供稱、渠早已遵市黨部勸告、與該所脫離關係、並稱君知其巓末、可將經過祥細陳述、</p>
<p>▲市黨部書面勸告　潘局長卽稱此事發動於去年暑假將滿、各學校準備開學之際、因見報紙登載現代學藝研究所招生廣告、所長署名洪深、我與洪素有交誼、不忍見其爲人利用、特向勸告、勿擔任所長一席、是時洪僅云渠由友人强挽帮忙、祗任名義、不負任責、厥後市黨部正式用書面勸告速與該所脫離、否則將來如查明該所有反動行動、所長不能辭咎、洪乃容納勸告、並卽呈復市黨部、謂不獨對現代學藝研究所長一席、已經告退、與該所脫離關係、卽所擔任之其他學校教授職務、亦均分别辭却、以免蒙鼓動靑年學子之嫌、此後將專爲明星影片公司導演影戲云云、後洪復登報聲明、　　▲中央查究之原委　　我遇洪、仍詢以研究所之内容及所址由何人出名租賃、據洪云彼因與田漢相交頗久、田以所長一席相煩、性不可却、故爲帮忙、然自始至終、僅往該所上課一次、及接受勸告、亦疑其中另有作用、立卽辭退云云、此次中央黨部查究此事、實係在該所未封前所得之報告、因市黨部之勸洪深脫離及洪深接受勸告等情、市黨部猶未向中央報告也、中央黨部秘書陳立夫同志、因欲明瞭此事眞相、特邀洪深赴都、面詢一切、市黨部方面之同志以私人資格、備函爲洪介紹外、並派某同志偕洪前去、旋據洪返滬云、與中央要人、俱已會見、中央所懷疑之點、皆經諒解、此爲上月間事、查洪脫離該所、係在該所發封之前、經洪赴都解釋後、市黨部以爲此事已了、</p>
<p>▲黨部送文件備查　最近聞法院因奉部令、須洪到案、昨復得洪言、請我爲其到庭作證、聲明過去種種、　乃勸洪自首、故彼遂於昨日自投捕房、　黨部恐公函聲述、不盡明瞭、故派本人到院旁聽、相機以本案經過、向法院報告、藉備參考云云、王檢察官繼問潘局長曰、警備司令部對洪深前因何事、潘對曰、亦因此事、警備司令部曾派人至洪家搜查三小時、又問曰市黨部處理此事、有無文件證明、潘曰、須往查檢、並遵庭命、將關於此事之文件、容回黨部、飭人抄錄一份、送院備查、</p>
<p>洪深當庭准交保　王檢察官復問洪深向中央黨部陳述一點、有無文件證明、洪供此無文件、當時諒解後、陳立夫頗爲優待、洪言至此、旋易口吻、謂庭上頃諭知係外交部公文案奉理本案、外部我有一仇人、王檢察官知洪誤會辦理本案之手續、卽諭之曰、本案原動於陸海空軍行營參謀處、因汝住居租界、故移文外交部、循外交軌道辦理、外部以租界内設有中國法院、不必與外人交涉、遂轉令本院核辦、毫無用意、汝母須誤會、現本案尚須偵查、汝應具舖保出外候示、將來偵查終結、起訴與否、皆有正式書面通知、洪之律師詹紀鳳已將關於和解大光明案所登廣告之報紙取到呈案、並請准由明星公司經理周劍雲爲洪之保人、王檢察官立予核准、宣告退庭、正鐘鳴十二下也、</p>

<p>▲約定薄暮搶親　詎孀婦得此消息、以夫死不久、孝服未除、正悲痛之不暇、故抱定守身、誓死不從、乃姑見事成僵局而所收之大洋六十元、難以償還、遂與田商定、約於前晚六時至七時、命媳至楊家渡東市石橋堍老虎灶上泡水、由田搶至家中成婚、計定、田方冀將圓好夢、初不料造成一幕趣劇、資人談笑也、</p>
<p>▲搶錯他人之妻　前日田在家將房内略事佈置、儼成新房、而房外則設禮案安揷香燭、權充禮堂、並招得朋友十餘、屆時守候老虎灶左右候命、但該婦事先已得密告、姑命購水、僞應不去、會有住於附近垃圾堂之泰州人滕學囝者、年三十四歲、業酒作坊司務、妻陳氏、少一歲、貌頗似孀婦、是時手抱一孩、適携桶往該老虎灶購水、田久候孀婦不至、見陳氏來、電燈光下、辨認不淸、誤爲卽係此人、當先以布塊蒙裹氏首、招呼同胖、一擁回家、而門首鞭砲聲亦大鳴、</p>
<p>▲姪女被人包圍　田見該氏衣服陳舊、勒令入房沐浴更衣、氏是時如身墮五霧中、莫明所以、堅辨無效、因不允沐浴更衣、故衣服被田扯破、陳氏大呼救命、田卽舉手將氏嘴邊擊碎、鮮血殷然、是時適有陳氏姑夫韓八喜子在門首路過、見田家香燭輝煌、房内人聲嘈雜、好奇之心、油然而生、故入内觀看、見自已内姪女被人包圍逼婚、卽將田之門牌取下、馳報於滕、</p>

<p>一昨西鄉某老農來余家。其年已逾古稀。而精神癯鑠。尤能酣飲。其談吐時。一如當年荷鋤戴笠之概。了無衰老作龍鍾狀態。余詢其此次春初下雪。爲近數年來所未有。今歲小熟得勿受損乎。老農欷歔而言曰。此眞天也。當春未交。雖遇雪暴。或積至數寸許。冰結不融。而螟蝗之害得免。禾稻可豐收。此雪爲豐年之兆者以此。至春雪則有害而無益。語曰。「臘雪如被。春雪如鬼。」蓋言麥値春雪。正在發育時。而受嚴寒之摧折。非冬末可比也。余復詢其蠶豆亦爲小熟出品之大宗。遇斯天時若何。老農曰。「豆雖能耐寒。其受損失。較麥或且尤甚焉。詰其究竟。則謂麥無論大小。如勤於農作者。已將撈蓄之河泥。挑蓋田中。故能減少冷氣之侵入麥根。不至死絶。一經日光。向榮如故。尚能無害。否則。四五月間無麥飯之可啖。雖欲種大熟而不得。不特鄉農之受饑而已。言次。愴然不止。又謂蠶豆猶可補種。如以廢曆正月十三日上午。舉鍤下子。仍能萌芽。至夏初可冀結實。不然若在是日下午。雖亦播種。而欲望其能生成。俾免荒蕪。終無效益。鄉人不知國歷。故如此云。余又詢老農曰。信若是。天時雖厲。人事又可補救。特其說果能徵騐否。老農輾然曰。「吾自幼從事阡陌間。今已埀老。經此大雪。又不知幾度。君阿疑之甚耶」。然余非農家者流。終不能釋然於懷。故濡筆述之。以俟世之有農事智識者。一研究焉</p>

<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>阿金道。無論如何。三十塊錢是不肯當的。頭櫃朝奉道。我們說三十塊錢。也是看在那周圍一圈小鑽面上。倘然没有那周一圈小鑽。我們更估不上價錢。你說白金。我們就從來不知道什麽呌做白金。我們典當裏。估看白金就没有人咧。任憑你說得怎麽樣。我們只當它銅的看。我們是要擔責任的呢。回頭當下了假貨。我們要吃賠賬。至於金子銀子的貨色。我們自有眼睛。什麽新興的白金黑金。我們就不知道什麽一回事。你當就當。不當就拿回去。阿金覺得這三十塊錢。實在相差太遠。照他們的估價當了回去。六小姐一定要不滿意。伊自然不敢做主。便說那末問了這手表的主人再來吧他伊回去告訴了花元春。便道。六小姐。幸虧我們還有兩個鼻子管。不然。然也被他們氣死了。那種徽駱駝。他們只怕從來也没有見過什麽呌做白金。從三櫃朝奉授到二櫃朝奉手裏。又從二櫃朝奉授到頭櫃朝奉手裏。結果是還價三十塊錢。我勸你六小姐。還是換點别樣東西去吧。花元春道。别的貴重之品。老實告訴你阿金。有的一已當去。有的已經當絶了。還有幾件。我自己也要插戴插戴。到了那邊去。早點行頭也顯弗出。可不呌人家背後披嘴。正在那個時候。恰巧有兩個客人打茶圍來了。大家也就不談此事。原來這兩個打茶圍客人。一個是葉桐侯。也是花元春的一個老客人。還有一位是葉桐侯帶來的不相干的朋友。葉桐侯一跑進來。便笑着說道。我們來打「梳頭茶圍」了。花元春道。你又提出什麽新鮮名兒來了。什麽呌做梳頭茶圍呢。葉桐侯道。下午天還没有黑的時候。到堂子裏去打茶圍。許多倌人。許多小姐。都在梳頭的時代。人家說的「水晶廉下看梳頭」。是别有一種情趣。一到了夜裏。酒邊燈下。那都是他們穠裝艷裏的時代了。倒是在這時候。亂頭粗服。可以顯出他們的眞相來。花元春向着他媚眼一掠。便道。三少。你這人好厲害。看人就要看出人家眞相來。那末你再早一點來。等人家没有起來的時候來。不更顯出了眞相嗎。葉桐侯摇着頭道。這個呌做「被頭茶圍」。但是我生平不打被頭茶圍。這有什麽意思。所謂過猶不及。被頭裏的光隂。宜於在上半時期。不宜於在下半時期。宛如人生一般。上半世總比下半世有味。</p>

<p>昨日客秈頗見蕭條、因日前開盤後、市價奇昂、客運又感　販不划、而貨主以滬存客秈甚少、而江西湖南兩大産米區均被匪共擾攘、存米盡被搶刼、非但無米出境、反有缺糧之虞、故貨主心思甚堅、不願輕易脫手、市面隨呈擯局、統市祗有北洋帮辦去江西機元一百包、價十四元、本街辦進南京機米柳米等二百餘包、機米開十元○四角半、柳米十元○五角、贛晚各秈乃無只色交易、該帮因産地市價步高、已超出申地售價、擬將存米裝回者、但西貢邏暹各地因金價下回、販運已漸合划、聞已有行商訂定一批、並因東三省高麗各地米價低廉、亦抛向該地販運云、</p>

<p>「讀書運動」就是我大夏的口號、大夏的成績、在幾年中、能以進步到如此地步、也是以　爲基礎啊、</p>
<p>自從沈昆南先生担任了大夏體育主任以後、就覺得　有點不完全、因爲、太側重於德智二育、就極力提倡「運動讀書一這個目的、就是要生練出强健的身體、而後纔有充分的精神來研究學術、和修養德性、經沈先生提倡的結果、全校的師生、都以練習運動爲榮耀、所以田徑隊竟在第四屆江大運動會中、與第三屆的金標隊交通大學並列第三、不料第五屆的江大運動會、因爲舊生的畢業、新生的限於資格而不能參加、所以結果不能使我們滿意、</p>
<p>現在、沈先生因爲要選拔田徑的眞才來恢復我校已往的榮譽、所以並不在一兩天的運動會中揀選、常隨時隨地去觀察尋求、居然發現了不少的傑出人材、我不妨把沈先生認爲他們前途很有希望的幾位、作一個簡單的介紹</p>
<p>李秋波、是福建厦門人、新近從日本回來、他和這次遠東運動會的跳遠冠軍、南部忠平氏、是很好的朋友、平時、兩人天天總是在一起練習、他們的姿勢是一樣的、他的成績也是七米以外、有時、還能壓倒南部、至於他百米呢、是平等日本村上國平氏的十秒零六的全國紀錄、本來、他預備代表我國參加遠東運動會的、不料他在去年四月裏、當跳遠騰空時、兩臂向後擲得太猛、將手臂的骨節脫了、因而就睡了兩個月、不然、我國在遠東會中、田俓、决不會失敗到這種田地罷、大約雙十節的全國運動會、他一定有很好的成績給我們、和驚醒我國萎靡不振的運動界、</p>
<p>顧彧、曾代表江蘇省、出席全國運動會、他得過江浙十中校、和本埠西人靑年會主辦的運動會的跳高冠軍、近來他的成績、進步到一米八十、打破余懷安一米七五四的全國紀錄、</p>
<p>何德寳、是上海華人中有名的賽跑家、曾獲上海市的賽跑錦標而代表上海出席全國運動會、</p>
<p>蕭子桐、具有田徑天才、十五項運動、門門皆精、屢獲廣東各運動會的個人錦標、實在是一個全能的運動家、</p>
<p>其餘的、像吳錦祺、郭鷹、方文紀、彭述信等、都是些能跑善跳的運動家、總之、現在的大夏田徑隊、實力的確是很雄厚的、預料兩三月後的第六屆江大運動會、和十月的全國運動會、我大夏的田徑隊、必定能得到相當的成績、</p>

<p>誰不知道我們家鄉丨江西丨是被共産黨閙得烏烟瘴氣的、一班父老是大都在養生送死之不遑、何有餘力供給其子弟膏火之資以續弦誦之聲呢、但旣這樣我們就輟學回家吧、不、回家無錢也是不成裝、不回家吧、留滬飯資還得向友商、這樣、漂泊的游子、究有什麽辦法呢、</p>
<p>可是實逼處此、」不能不謀自救之道、而「急則生變、」總會有解苦脫厄之方、前次教育廳不是呈請教育部通令各校準免贛籍學生的學宿雜費嗎、這不是很可喜的消息嗎、但是消息自消息、事實上、是很難達到目的的、不過局部的進行、或者比較容易些奏效、於是相約一致的同學、齊署名上着「奏書」了、幸而馬到成功、邀到了學校當局的答覆、不過是批着「準予欠費」四字、</p>
<p>「準予欠費」、欠費不要擔保和利息、這是多麽「免禮加恩」的事情、却是高築債臺、積重難還、弄得欠「來生債」是不太合算的、於是有的同學提議要繼續「免費運動」、有的同學還要提出「抗費主義」、結果也是决定全體動員作擴大請願、</p>
<p>畢竟校長是多在政書旁午而少在校中少在家、大家去上朝請見、尤其是難乎其難的、倒不如先下着第二次通牒再說、看他究竟有起什麽反應没有、否則還有進一步的辦法、於是大家又决定這樣的進行了、</p>
<p>自發出請願書後三天吧、忽有秘書處的字條擱置在蔡同學的桌上、那時我們才承同房的人從閱報室呌回來的、於是我同蔡君在房間裏靜默了三分鐘、私議了幾句、就怱怱地趕赴秘書長之召、我們將入門的時候、已見秘書長倨傲地坐在沙發椅上抽捲烟、等到我們立定喘氣時、他就先發制人的問道、</p>
<p>「這不是你們請求免費的信嗎、」</p>
<p>「是的、」蔡君就這樣慷慨地招認了、　　「這不是說你們已經免過了學宿費嗎、秘書先生又指着那註册課抄來的單子、向我們再度發問了、</p>
<p>「呵、免過了費、寫倒寫意、但現在怎麽回答他的話呢」於是我們倆又這樣面面相覷的對想了一回、</p>
<p>「免過了、爲什麽又要請求」接着又來一陣迅雷不及掩耳的詰責、弄得我們第二問還不及答覆他、</p>
<p>「因爲我們只在佈告上見到「準欠不準免」、所以再度請求」、我們也終於這樣向他解釋了、同時我們也就順風轉舵的乘機告别、</p>
<p>雖是在歸途中、我們的熱心、是被寒風吹成冷意、然而秘書長的談話和神氣、我們仍是在「耿耿於懷」的、</p>
<p>第一請求免費業已照準</p>
<p>第二旣是免費不應再請求、</p>
<p>這樣無怪秘書長是名正言順而理直氣壯的了、可是從前「準欠不準免」的議决案、也可推翻的嗎、抑或是「虛者實之、實者虛之」的手段來對付窮小子嗎、還或是金玉其外、敗絮其中」的方法來避免援例人嗎、我始終莫名其妙、</p>

<p>弟弟之死</p>
<p>中醫對呢還是西醫對</p>
<p>牠能夠預防嗎</p>
<p>「腦膜炎、」</p>
<p>唔、這是何等可怕的一個名詞呀、的、牠所給與我的印象實在是太深了、牠曾給與我以生來未嘗有過的打擊、牠使我恐佈、失望、悲觀和痛苦、爲了牠、我曾斷續地有過三四個月的失眠、</p>
<p>這是十八年初春的事、那時恰巧是廢曆的新年、因爲是寒假、我住在家裏、人日的第二天便是我的生日了、家人都預備着爲我慶賀、所以那天晚上大家都睡得很早、二弟、這時十六歲了、他因爲日間去過江灣、又去過戲院、所以身體非常倦、便自己去洗澡、預備睡覺去了、他說覺得有點不舒服、頭痛、需要搽如意油這是很平常的事、所以大家都没有注意、臨睡時、他還說明天要諳我到新雅飲茶、給我做生日、天呀、有誰知道空前的大變故馬上要來臨我弟弟底身上呢、</p>
<p>突然一種可怕的呼喊聲打破我底沉夢、我以異乎尋常的速度立刻從樓上跑落我弟弟底床前、不好了、弟弟底面色已變成薑黄了、兩眼固定的朝上張着、全身痙孿、頸部筆直地挺着、斜臥在床上、一言不發的給乳母底顫動的手摇着、促而急的氣息猛烈地呼吸着、體温和搏脈幾乎没有了、我、奇怪煞的、異常鎭定、絲毫没有一點慌亂、立刻拿着一盒諸葛行軍散向他鼻裏不絶地打、果然、他噴嚏了、可是形勢依然没有變、祇聽到一聲低而長的呻吟、因爲没有阿摩尼亞、我便利用到茶房底夜壺、將牠燒熱了、焗到他鼻上、果然、形勢突變、他掙扎而且大呌了、這時天色已微亮、父親、母親、住在隔壁的譚醫士都已站在床前了、</p>
<p>當譚醫士按脈時、大家都祇得靜靜地立着、病人底呌喊也止了身體依舊是痙攣着、促而急的氣息還是猛烈地呼吸着、我、這時開始有點異樣了、恐懼已侵入了我底心頭、因爲譚醫士底表情有點可怕、使我立刻感覺到弟弟底病不是尋常的</p>
<p>「急驚、還是先拿玉桂來罷、」譚醫士這樣的吩咐、</p>
<p>這時、重要的角色不是有病的弟弟、而是做了我們一家之長的父親了、因爲譚醫士說、這是很嚴重的一個症、大局就在六小時内决定、藥是來得起的、不過醫法是異常、要在十二點鐘脈色轉變時用和剛才性質極端相反的藥攻下、因爲症象太危了、難得擔保、要父親簽字才肯處方、他又說、除此以外、没有别路可走了、　　父親是一向没主意的、此時更慌亂了、所以譚醫士的話結果是無效、八點鐘、請來的是一個中醫、没有開單便跑了、跟着是西醫陳某、經過很長久的診察後、他說、「恐怕要轉腦膜炎」、（到底他說這是什麽症、我不知道、因爲此時我恰巧跑開了、不過我記得他曾經用電手燈把病人底眼睛照過、試騐牠底反應作用、）</p>
<p>十二點鐘一過、譚醫士便跑開了、我因爲要招呼四個年幼的弟妹、也跑開了、那天下午是怎樣的、我已不能記憶、直到晚上半夜、大家都知到已無辦法、祇有把病人抬出客廳了、譚醫士底話、此時已漸得我父親的信仰、然而、太遲了、</p>
<p>眼看着一個促着氣要死而不得死的人的情形是何等難過啊、我終於忍不住、我不能再顧到什麽家長底尊嚴了、「抬他到醫院去罷、與其等死不如設法罷、「我實在不能再容忍了、良心已督促着我說出這話來了、</p>
<p>天亮了、一駕紅十字的病車便把我底可憐底二弟帶到某醫院去了、我是主張去日醫福民醫院的、但是老人家（不是父親）說、某醫院好、那裏有很好的德國醫生、自然、老人家底話一定是對的、小孩子底見解　得什麽呢、</p>
<p>下午、是起病後第二天的下午、也是病人進院後已經過了半天的下午了、當我進院去看時、據說醫生一個也没有來過、祇是看護長和護士給他（病人）換上病衣、記過姓名等便去了、因爲他們說病人進來時已是十點、醫生底服務時間已過了、怎樣呢、病是埀危的、難道就這樣換上病衣頭上加上冰囊便可以延到明天來受診嗎、醫院的規則是嚴謹的、住的雖然是頭等單人病房、也祇許兩個人伴着、不能多一個人加入來討論辦法、看護是老虎一樣的、多問一句便要受駡、尤其是那綠眼晴的女看護長、好像餓虎追羊二樣把問病的人驅逐、萬無辦法了、祗得多</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the election of National Assembly representatives in Mongolia and Tibet, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has begun preparations. According to telegrams from various leagues and banners in Mongolia and expressions from the Dalai Lama's representatives in Beijing, this election must be different from the old ways, and people who can truly represent the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities should be elected, instead of being manipulated by a few people. The commission believes that Mongolia and Tibet do not have organizations of professional groups, and the national knowledge and thinking are no longer as ignorant as in the past. The old systems and methods are not applicable, and the handling is quite difficult. The election period is approaching, and on the one hand, it must be based on the principles promulgated by the central government, and no violations are allowed. On the other hand, it must consider the situation of the frontier areas to avoid obstacles, so as to complete the task within the time limit. Therefore, the preparatory methods and steps are very cautious. Wu Heling, the director of the Mongolian Affairs Department, and Luo Sang Jianzan, the director of the Tibetan Affairs Department, are currently studying the matter in detail, and plan to first establish the Election Office and start working.

<p>The European situation, since France and Italy failed to reach an agreement on naval negotiations and related matters, has been turbulent, with many believing that another great war is about to resume. Pessimists believe that the situation of peace will not last long. However, based on the news received today, there is some consolation.</p>
<p>The first is the European Agricultural Conference. The conference only discussed the issue of exporting surplus food in Europe. However, representatives from 24 countries attended the conference. French Foreign Minister Briand pointed out that this is the first obvious result of the European federal movement, saying that the current time has reached the period of testing European solidarity. What is worrisome is not the distribution of surplus grain, but the maintenance of peace. It can be seen from this how enthusiastic he is about the integration of Europe.</p>
<p>The second is the British mediation of the naval dispute between Italy and France. British Foreign Minister Henderson and Navy Minister Alexander have now arrived in France to discuss naval issues with French cabinet members. An agreement will be established between Britain and France, so that France can agree to reduce its naval advantage over Italy. This move can be seen as an important step towards an agreement. Although it is still unknown whether France and Italy can settle their dispute, it cannot be said that this is not an opportunity to carry out arms reduction and safeguard peace.</p>

<p>▲The Kuomin News Agency’s dispatch from Bombay on the 24th: The local newspapers here claim that the British government has lent the Afghan leader Nadir Shah 170,000 pounds in British gold, and has also donated 10,000 new-style rifles and countless military supplies. According to Indian newspapers, this move is aimed at helping the Kabul government consolidate its southern border. But in fact, Britain’s move is nothing more than bribing the Afghan leader to resist the power of Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>An Agreement Will Be Established Between Britain and France First</p>
<p>Italy's Attitude is Difficult to Predict</p>
<p>▲Reuters Paris dispatch on the 24th: The British-French naval talks resumed this morning at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will continue uninterrupted in the hope of reaching an agreement tonight. If the two sides can agree, British Foreign Minister Henderson and British Navy Minister Alexander plan to go to Rome to persuade Italy to also join the London Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>▲Reuters London dispatch on the 23rd: British Foreign Minister Henderson and Navy Minister Alexander, accompanied by three members of the Foreign Office, including Craigie, set off for France this morning to discuss naval issues with French cabinet members. It is expected that an agreement will be reached between Britain and France so that France can agree to reduce its naval advantage over Italy. It is reported that Craigie has already agreed with France to reduce the tonnage of submarines and other vessels. France still requires an increase in the tonnage of destroyers as compensation. At the London Naval Conference, France requested 240,000 tons more than the Italian navy. Craigie strongly urged the French government to reduce the 240,000-ton advantage to 150,000 tons before 1936. This move can be seen as an important step towards an agreement. Craigie submitted his plan to the British authorities, and now it is being discussed by Foreign Minister Henderson and the French government. (The following is connected to the Kuomin News Agency dispatch) However, what is Italy's attitude and whether it can conclude a treaty with France and accept the above plan is still difficult to predict at this time. Some French newspapers are also doing their best to oppose limiting French warships to only 150,000 tons more than Italian ships, and they are even more dissatisfied because the rumored agreement does not guarantee that Italy will not raise the demand for equal French and Italian navies after the agreement expires in 1936.</p>

<p>Churchill Opposes Policy Toward India</p>
<p>Accusing the Current Government of Exerting Every Effort</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New Delhi, 24th - Viceroy Irwin today released a statement regarding his talks with Gandhi, saying that Gandhi met with eight representatives attending the London Round Table Conference and unanimously agreed on a compromise to reorganize the Congress. There is now hope for the situation. The All-India National Congress Working Committee has passed a resolution authorizing Gandhi to resolve all matters with the Viceroy.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 23rd - Former Conservative Party Chancellor of the Exchequer, Churchill, tonight convened a meeting of the administrative committee of the Conservative Party in his constituency of West Essex to gather the committee's opinion on his departure from the Conservative Party executive. Churchill stated that he would not join any government whose policy toward India he did not agree with. It is horrifying and disgusting to see Gandhi, a lawyer turned rebel, half-naked, striding boldly through the Viceroy's door, engaging in equal negotiations with the representative of the British Crown. The purpose of Gandhi is the basis for discussion, and this discussion is the preliminary to holding another Round Table Conference in India. The Conservative Party should immediately arouse public opinion. He wants to devote all his ability to this goal. If his constituency representatives express trust in his aspirations, he will be greatly encouraged. The India issue is not an ordinary party issue; its importance can only be compared to the motives of the European War on August 4, 1914, and the general strike of 1926. Entrusting the welfare of three million people to a few Indian politicians is simply giving them the opportunity to exploit and oppress. It would not be wrong to call it a cowardly, lacking courage, abandoning responsibility, and losing honor. He knows that the opportunity for victory will soon return to the Conservative Party, at which time he will show the world the true and unchanging heart of the empire and the just and strong hand of the empire. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution expressing complete trust in Churchill.</p>

<p>Government Response Lacks Sincerity</p>
<p>Difficulties in the Upper House Remain</p>
<p>Proletarian Party Decides on Struggle Week</p>
<p>Firmly Opposed to Labor Law</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 24th - Anti-government members of the Upper House are concentrating their main efforts on the budget general meeting, attacking the government on issues such as unemployment, the issue of the ancillary reply, and the issue of command authority, which has achieved considerable results. Currently, the following three criticisms of the government are growing louder: (1) The government acknowledges the imperial rescript as a state affair while simultaneously stating that the ancillary reply on which it is based is not a state affair. (2) Premier Hamaguchi stated in the previous session of the Diet that the opinions of the military should be taken into consideration when determining the strength of the armed forces, while Premier Kijūrō Shidehara, acting on behalf of the Premier, and Minister of the Navy Anbo responded in this session of the Diet that it was the result of a consensus of opinion between the Minister of the Navy and the Chief of the Naval General Staff, which is the result of a consensus of opinion between the government, which includes the Minister of the Navy, and the military. Judging from the previous session of the Diet, Premier Hamaguchi consistently avoided the word "agreement," only saying "consideration," which shows that the government's response policy has indeed changed. The contradiction is obvious. (3) Premier Kijūrō Shidehara, acting on behalf of the Premier, retracted his slip of the tongue in the House of Representatives, but did not retract it in the House of Peers, only stubbornly arguing that it was "insufficient wording." This is also a sign of disrespect for the Upper House, attempting to cover up its own mistakes with sophistry. Therefore, the attitude of various factions in the Upper House toward the government has become more severe, believing that the government lacks sincerity and is not accommodating. If the government does not change its attitude, the situation in the Upper House will become increasingly unfavorable to the government.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 24th - The National Masses Party held a standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to launch a nationwide opposition movement against the three bills submitted by the government: the Labor Union Law, the Tenant Law, and the amendment to the Labor Dispute Mediation Law, demanding the agreement of friendly parties. The methods of implementation: (1) From February 26th to March 5th, it will be Struggle Week. (2) On the night of March 5th, a mass rally of the three proletarian parties of workers and farmers will be held to carry out a large-scale demonstration.</p>

The House of Representatives today passed a bill to allocate US$4 million annually to establish employment agencies. This bill was previously passed by the Senate, which had the potential to convene a special session of Congress this summer to seek a resolution. Now that it has been passed by the House of Representatives, it will be submitted to the President for approval. Although the Senate and House of Representatives have passed many bills in recent days, there are still many important cases that cannot be resolved within the session period.

<h3 id="e54">Disaster Situation in Dingbian, Jingbian, and Hengshan in Northern Shaanxi <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>▲Drought Followed by Rat Plague</p>
<p>▲Rat Plague Leads to Bubonic Plague</p>
<p>Xi'an correspondence, Dingbian, Jingbian, Hengshan, and other counties in northern Shaanxi are located on the extreme border, with boundless deserts. The food they need is entirely dependent on transportation and assistance from the counties under the jurisdiction of Yan'an. After the drought, there was a general shortage of food in Shaanxi, and Dingbian, Jingbian, Hengshan, and other counties had no local production and no external sources. Therefore, the number of deaths and displacements of the population in these counties has reached more than two-thirds. The climate in these counties is very different from that in the Central Plains. They only harvest one crop in the autumn each year, sowing in February and March and harvesting in July and August. In 1917 and 1918, there was no harvest at all. Last autumn, it was celebrated that the autumn harvest was promising, but during the harvest, there was a rat plague everywhere. The seedlings in various places were eaten bare by the rats. After the rats ate all the seedlings, the rat corpses filled the fields, leading to a very large outbreak of bubonic plague. As soon as people approached, they would die the next day. In the past, the counties in northern Shaanxi mostly relied on animal husbandry for a living, but due to the excessive disasters and long disaster periods, most of the cattle and sheep starved to death. The cattle and sheep herds of the past are now scattered in threes and fives and no longer form herds. When the disaster was most severe last year, the price of each head of cattle and horse was only one or two yuan. Now, the price of each mu of land is no more than one or two jiao. Young women have mostly been trafficked to Shanxi. The surviving disaster victims now rely on grass seeds, sand rice, tree bark, and stone soil to maintain their lives. The severity of the disaster can be seen. Currently, the Dingbian County Relief Committee has submitted a request for urgent relief to the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Committee. The document states, "We have checked the disasters in our county and have reported them several times before, so it seems unnecessary to repeat them. However, because the Relief Committee has been reorganized, we must reiterate the disaster situation. Dingbian is located on the extreme border, with boundless deserts and a lack of rainfall. The population is scattered, and the people's lives were originally difficult. However, the hardship and adversity have never been as severe as in recent years. The natural disasters in recent years have never been as severe as they are today. Today's disaster is unprecedented in other places, and today's suffering is unheard of since ancient times. Why? Dingbian has had five years of famine, with a barren landscape. Everyone lacks food and relies on grass roots and tree bark. Every household seeks a living by dismantling houses and selling firewood. Now, it is even more pitiful. Not a single blade of grass remains, which is shocking to the eye. The people are catching sparrows and digging for rats, cooking bones for sustenance, and even choosing stone soil and grinding it into food. They are searching for bamboo and wood to fill their hungry stomachs. All the livestock have been slaughtered, and there is no sound of chickens crowing or dogs barking. Family members eat each other, all with haggard faces. Our committee is responsible for relieving suffering but has no means to alleviate the disaster. We are heartbroken and shocked and cannot help but hate the big rats and severe frost that have stolen our people's autumn harvest and led our people to their deaths. All the hard work of the year is in vain, and how will the lives of ten thousand families be maintained? They pawn their clothes and shoes and run to other counties. Who are the peaceful scholars? They sell their wives and daughters and move to other provinces. Who are the happy countries? Bodies are seen everywhere, which used to be rare, but now it is not uncommon. In this severe winter, it is solid, shady, and cold, and the smoke from cooking fires has completely disappeared. Therefore, the people's determination to die has turned into a desire to end their lives. They often jump into rivers and wells, take poison and hang themselves. If this continues, what can we imagine? Recently, Dingbian has also experienced a bubonic plague, the so-called Black Death by Westerners. Once infected, everyone dies. Every day, hundreds of people starve to death and die from illness inside and outside the city. This is the situation reported daily by the district and township chiefs. If no measures are taken to provide relief, then tens of thousands of lives will soon be reduced to dry fish. Our committee is now gathering gentry and merchants to solicit donations and assistance. However, it is like a cart of firewood and a cup of water, making it difficult to alleviate the suffering. We have always admired your committee's concern for the well-being of the people and your determination to save lives. Therefore, we dare to express the disaster situation frankly and respectfully send representatives Liu Zunxian, Fan Shanchu, Yang Jiqing, et al. to appeal to you. We earnestly request that you be mindful of the particularly severe disaster situation in Dingbian, and approve and grant a large sum of money and distribute good medicine to benefit the disaster victims. We are filled with anticipation." (February 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Stalling of the Fujian Bridge Construction Corruption Case <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>▲Yang Shuzhuang Expresses Dissatisfaction with the Prosecution</p>
<p>▲Prosecuting Attorney Yang Chongshi Resigns in Anger</p>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence, Jiang Pingfan, the former acting director of the Department of Construction of this province, and Lin Enpu, the director of the Municipal Works Bureau, were suspected of corruption in the construction of bridges and embankments. After being prosecuted by Yang Chongshi, the prosecutor of the Minhou District Court, there have been two preliminary hearings. However, due to the dissatisfaction expressed by Yang Shuzhuang, the chairman of the provincial government, the case has been delayed for two months and has not been prosecuted. Recently, Wang Fengxiong, the president of the High Court, has also advocated transferring the case to the Control Yuan for handling, hoping to reduce judicial responsibility. Yang Chongshi was extremely angry about this and submitted his resignation a few days ago. He also intends to print and publish the process of prosecuting the case and the preliminary hearing confessions of the evidence obtained to seek social criticism. As for the Wanshou South and North Bridge projects, they have recently been completely suspended. Only six or seven workers are working on the bridges every day, moving stones and applying lime as a formality. The completed projects are also extremely perfunctory and do not conform to the methods stipulated in the original agreement. The main figures of the Japanese Yamato Industrial Company, which contracted the project, including the design engineer and the representative who signed the contract, have all returned to their country. The residents in the area north and south of the bridge believe that the spring water will rise soon and that the ferry traffic will be very dangerous. The stores in Zhongzhou, located between the two bridges, have become isolated islands since the transportation was cut off, and their business has completely stopped, resulting in significant losses. They have filed complaints with the Department of Construction. Xu Xianshi, the director of the department, especially requested the provincial government yesterday to make serious representations to the Japanese Consul, ordering them to handle the matter in accordance with the contract so that it could be completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>The appended resignation letter of Yang Chongshi is as follows: "I, Chongshi, prosecuted Jiang Pingfan, et al. for the crime of dereliction of duty and seeking illegal profits in this case based on news reports. After several secret investigations, although there were clues, I did not directly interrogate Jiang and Lin. I still explored in many ways and obtained evidence before issuing summons for interrogation. I asked myself that I handled this case with extra caution. All the details were under my full observation. After I was ordered to handle this case, I conducted separate and strict investigations. As a result, I believed that the evidence of the crime was conclusive and the suspicion was serious. I should file a public prosecution immediately. On January 7, I sent the draft indictment to be examined and approved. At that time, I was told in person that there was nothing wrong with the indictment, but it would be inappropriate to prosecute because one of the defendants was a central-level appointee and the other was a local-level appointee. It was decided to submit a request to the Ministry for instructions. I checked the Code of Criminal Procedure, and there are no special provisions regarding the prosecution of defendants based on their status. Your Honor has served as a judge for many years, so you must know this. However, after I argued according to the law, you insisted on your preconceived notion and telegraphed the Ministry to delay the prosecution for more than 20 days. I was very suspicious. Recently, I was pleased to receive a Ministry telegram that roughly stated: 'According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there are no special provisions regarding the prosecution based on the defendant's status. However, whether the prosecution requirements of Article 253 of the same law are met should be carefully handled by the prosecuting attorney based on the results of the investigation, and no recklessness should be involved. You are ordered to transfer these instructions to those who must comply.' I believed that the Ministry's telegram had already stated that there were no special provisions for the defendant's status, and the so-called 'no recklessness' was also for the prosecuting attorney handling the case. Since I handled this case, clearly recognized the facts, and was responsible for drafting the indictment, it should be transferred to the criminal court for handling according to the law to serve as a warning to those who are corrupt. However, Your Honor continued to state that he had received a telegram from the Ministry that roughly stated: 'Chairman Yang of the Fujian Provincial Government has telegraphed that the inspection office has overstepped its authority in the matter of changing the bridge and filling the land. Please investigate the details of the handling and report back.' It was said that the Ministry should still be consulted, and in the document submitted to the Ministry, it was also requested that the evidence be submitted in accordance with the precedent of the Lawyers Association's accusation against Wang Fengxiong. The government's side in this case purely misunderstood the facts, confusing the change of the bridge and the filling of the land with the officials' pursuit of private gain and dereliction of duty. In fact, our judiciary did not intervene in whether the bridge should be changed or the land should be filled. The government authorities did not understand the facts and made the following two claims: (1) It was said that the five powers are separated, and this matter should be handled by the Control Yuan. (2) It was said that in accordance with Article 30 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all litigation should be suspended during the request for avoidance. In fact, both points are seemingly correct but not actually so. 1. The so-called regulations of the Control Yuan refer to inappropriate or negligent administrative actions. If officials pervert the law for private gain and it does not belong to the judiciary, then the chapter on dereliction of duty in the Criminal Code can be deleted altogether. The nature of the crime of dereliction of duty is that only civil servants have the opportunity to commit dereliction of duty. This principle is very clear. 2. According to Article 34 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 30 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has no express provision for application to prosecutors and is not bound by it. This is also very clear. Your Honor should also know this. Moreover, the Ministry's reply only requested a clarification and report because it did not know the truth and did not instruct compliance. Why must the entire internal case be submitted to the Ministry? It is known that the Ministry's authorities are commendable in terms of morality and jurisprudence and will certainly not have any changes. However, more than two weeks have passed since the telegram to the Ministry, and the Ministry still has no instructions. Such delays will inevitably give the defendants many opportunities, arouse suspicion in society, and present the weakness of the inability to extend legal rights. The future of the rule of law is worrisome. The government uses the excuse of overstepping its authority to interfere with the judiciary, and the judges themselves are fearful and apprehensive and willingly accept interference. What kind of law and politics can be spoken of in this current situation? I, Chongshi, have a low rank and little power and have exhausted my fighting strength. I can only maintain my integrity and retreat. I will print the entire case process, the indictment, and the evidence films into an explanatory booklet and distribute it to all sectors to thank the people of the country. I hereby resign and leave the court today. I dare to ask that you forward this resignation for approval and send someone to take over as soon as possible. It is entirely for the public good."

<h3 id="e56">The Situation of Bandit Suppression and Communist Elimination in Fujian Province <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>▲Joint Defense Implemented on the Fujian-Zhejiang Border</p>
<p>▲Communist Banditry Still Rampant on the Fujian-Jiangxi Border</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The banditry situation on the Fujian-Zhejiang border has not yet been pacified. Following the provincial government's telegram order to the troops stationed in various counties bordering Zhejiang Province to make efforts to block and prevent the bandits from invading Fujian and causing trouble, it is now heard that the Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to formulate joint suppression measures to thoroughly eliminate the bandits. If any bandit alarm occurs in counties bordering the two provinces, troops should be dispatched to jointly encircle and suppress them, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries, without adopting a wait-and-see attitude. In addition to telegrams ordering the county magistrates and stationed troops of Qingyuan and Longquan counties in Zhejiang Province to comply, the Zhejiang Provincial Government also sent a telegram to Fujian seeking agreement. The Fujian Provincial Government, upon receiving the telegram, greatly approved and yesterday telegraphed back to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting that the measures be sent to Fujian so that proper arrangements can be jointly made and orders given for compliance.</p>
<p>Recently, the communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi have split into two groups. One group is attempting to flee from Guangfeng and Yanshan to Pucheng and Chong'an in Fujian, and the other group is attempting to flee from Guangchang and Shicheng to Ninghua and Changting in Fujian. Currently, Ninghua and Changting are under the defense responsibility of Zhou Zhiqian and Lu Xingbang's troops, and it is still difficult for the communist bandits to invade. However, traces of Jiangxi communists have been discovered in the western border of Chong'an County, and the situation in Pucheng, which is adjacent to Chong'an, is also very tense. Qian Yuguang, the brigade commander of the provincial defense army, telegraphed yesterday for emergency assistance. The provincial government telegraphed the marine corps brigade of Lin Bingzhou, stationed in Jian'ou, to quickly provide assistance. At the same time, Zhang Ziming's unit, the anti-bandit advance team of the provincial defense army stationed in Jianning County bordering Guangchang in Jiangxi, suddenly mutinied a few days ago with a force of about one regiment. The soldiers fled into Jiangxi Province with their weapons. Liu Heding's division and Liu Shangzhi's brigade intercepted half of them. Zhang Ziming was detained by Liu Heding in the county government. Yesterday, he telegraphed the provincial government for instructions on how to deal with the matter. As for Zhang Zhen's troops in western Fujian, they are still between Longyan and Yongding. Zhang once proposed imitating the Nanchang and Changsha methods by building strong fortifications around the cities of Longyan and Yongding for defense. The people of Wuping, Shanghang, Liancheng, and Changting counties are eagerly hoping for the arrival of national army reinforcements. A few days ago, they sent a special telegram to the provincial government, stating that Zhang's troops were weak and unable to take care of everything, requesting that the National Government be telegraphed to quickly send strong troops into Fujian to assist in the suppression and pacify the area (March 21).</p>
<h3 id="e57">The French Consul in Hankou Resists Payment of Business Tax <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>▲Hubei Provincial Government Submits to the Executive Yuan for Transfer to the Ministry for Negotiations</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the Hubei Provincial Government guided the abolition of likin, it entrusted Ji Tao to handle the business tax. Hankou City was originally not under the jurisdiction of the province, but due to the provincial treasury's deficit, the Executive Yuan telegraphed the province to take charge and the city to assist, with 70% going to the provincial treasury and 30% to the city treasury. The Japanese and French concessions were also subject to tax collection according to regulations, treating them as a single entity. The provincial government had sent letters to the Japanese and French consuls to handle the matter accordingly. However, the French consul refused to pay, claiming that he had not received orders. The provincial government refuted this on the 19th and on the 20th, also submitted a report to the Executive Yuan and consulted the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs send a note to the French minister to order compliance and payment, in order to uphold national rights and maintain tax administration. The provincial government's report, consultation, and instructions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Report to the Executive Yuan: A report is submitted for the matter. Previously, according to a report from the Finance Department, the chiefs of various bureaus were commissioned to prepare for the business tax, requesting examination and filing, and requesting that the consulates of various groups stationed in Hankou and the Hankou Municipal Government be consulted for reference. After separate letters were sent, a letter was received from Mr. Boddens, the French Consul in Hankou, stating that he had received a large letter dated January 31, along with four regulations for the collection of business tax in Hubei Province, stating that all Chinese and foreign merchants must comply with the payment of business tax, and requested that French merchants be informed. He stated that before these regulations were formally recognized by our minister, the consul would reserve them, and since our two countries have not yet reached an agreement on this tax payment, it would be difficult to force French merchants to pay according to the regulations, and he requested that the chairman review the matter. In response, the regulations regarding the collection of business tax in the province were formulated by the Finance Department in accordance with the "General Outline for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces" and supplementary measures issued by the Executive Yuan. They were discussed and promulgated by the provincial government committee and reported to the Executive Yuan and consulted with the Ministry of Finance for examination and filing. All those who engage in commerce and open shops within Hubei Province, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality, should pay business tax in accordance with the principle of equal treatment. The matter concerns domestic affairs and does not require interference from foreigners, nor does it require a special agreement with foreign countries. The various points opened in the original letter implied resistance and delay, which hindered tax revenue. Moreover, the implementation of business tax is not limited to Hubei Province, and foreign merchants in Hubei are not limited to France. If the consul condones French merchants to resist tax payment, merchants from other countries will inevitably follow suit, and foreign merchants in other provinces will also use this as an example to make demands, disrupting the general plan and hindering tax revenue. The disadvantages are unimaginable. It is requested that the Executive Yuan order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send a note to the French Minister, ordering the consul to order the French expatriates to comply with the payment, in order to uphold national rights and maintain tax administration. In addition to consulting the Ministry of Finance and ordering the Finance Department and informing them, a formal document is submitted to the Executive Yuan for examination and implementation, which is in the public interest. (The document consulting the Ministry of Finance is omitted).</p>
<p>(2) Instructions to the Finance Department: This case was previously reported by the department, and separate letters and instructions were issued. Now, according to the previous report, in addition to submitting a report to the Executive Yuan and consulting the Ministry of Finance and transferring the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send a note to the French Minister, a copy of the original report and consultation is copied and sent to the department for information. This order (February 20).</p>

<p>▲The Second Batch Can Only Depart After the Previous Trains Return</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Sun Lianzhong's troops are traveling to Jiangxi via Jining. According to a telegram from Jining at 1:00 PM on the 22nd, after Sun Lianzhong's troops continued to dispatch three trains on the evening of the 20th and the morning of the 21st, the vehicles were exhausted, so no further departures were made until noon on the 22nd. It is heard that Sun has telegraphed the railway bureau, requesting that the empty vehicles be returned to Jining as soon as possible for application. According to people from the 26th Route Army, the entire Sun army requires 30 trains to be transported completely. According to news from transportation sources, after Sun Lianzhong's army dispatched four trains before and after, no reports of dispatching military trains have been received from Jining by the 22nd. It is generally believed that the vehicles are exhausted, and they must wait for the troops to arrive in Pukou and return the empty vehicles before they can depart again (February 23).</p>

Hospitals No. 7 to No. 36, except for the 17th Rear Hospital in Suzhou, which has been converted into a rehabilitation hospital, are all to be closed by the end of February. As for the existing army hospitals, the director of the hospital is Huang Guancheng, the director of the hospital stationed in Jiangxi is Zhou Zhaoqi, the director of the hospital stationed in Hangzhou is Sun Xuchang, the director of the hospital stationed in Hunan is Liu Jianxun, the director of the First Hospital stationed in Hubei is Guo Qiyuan, the director of the Second Hospital stationed in Hubei is Song Fanxian, and the Third Hospital stationed in Hubei has been moved to Zhengzhou. In addition, the director of the Hangzhou Rear General Hospital is Jin Songpan. Recently, military hospitals stationed in Shaanxi and Anhui are being organized and will also be established. All wounded and sick officers and soldiers from the closed rear hospitals will be merged into the retained rear hospitals. The Medical Department of the Ministry of Military Administration has convened the heads of various hospitals to hold a military medical conference in Beijing on March 1. Fan Dengfeng, the director of the army hospital stationed in Xuzhou, has prepared four proposals to attend the meeting in Beijing. It is also heard that the National Government will specially establish a General Directorate of Military Medicine to unify military medical affairs (February 22).</p>
<h3 id="e60">Investigation and Reply Regarding the Derailment of the Beijing-Hankou Train in Donghuangdian <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>▲Transportation Has Been Restored First</p>
<p>▲The Locomotive Has Not Yet Been Righted</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways received a telegram yesterday from He Jingwu, Director of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau, and Ding Shijie, Deputy Director, on the 21st, stating that the No. 511 freight train derailed in Donghuangdian on the 15th of this month. The water tank car of the locomotive and the eight cars following the water tank car overturned, and transportation was interrupted. They immediately ordered the responsible departments to work overnight to right the overturned cars on the main track by 8:00 PM the next day and restore transportation first. After carefully examining the point where the derailment started, it was found to be from kilometer 1045 north of the station to the station entrance, and the cause was difficult to determine. It is necessary to wait for the locomotive to be righted before inspection. Only two squatters on a private train were killed and injured after the derailment. The number of deaths and injuries reported is not true. In addition to ordering the responsible departments to submit a survey report for further submission, this telegram is first submitted for review and approval.</p>
<h3 id="e61">The Case of Judge Ha Killing a Person Transferred to Liaoning <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>▲The Plaintiff Did Not Attend the Two Public Trials</p>
<p>▲Zhang Liqing Suddenly Fainted Due to Anxiety</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: A few days ago, a local news agency issued a surprising message, stating that Liu Kelong, a person related to Zhang Liqing who sent mooncakes in the Ye-Zhang murder case, traveled from Hanzhong to Ping with the status of a fiancé, took a plane from Ping to Harbin, and Zhang and Liu met at the Shou Shan Hospital. The negotiation was harmonious, and Liu was extremely understanding of Zhang. For a time, the social narrative was considered a perfect embellishment material for this unresolved case. After investigation, it is not true. Liu Kelong sent a letter to Zhang a month ago, informing her that after the case is settled, they can meet in his hometown of Hengyang. As for the trial situation of this case, it has been seen in previous reports. According to local sources, after Ye Yixiong was transferred to Liaoning, the Shenyang District Court convened a meeting of all judges and decided to use the indictment of the Binjiang Court Inspection Office, with the Shenyang Local Inspection Office adding the beginning and end, and not conducting another investigation. The public prosecutor Xue Shuping was designated as the public prosecutor. The court held the first public trial on the 11th, adopting a joint trial system. The plaintiff did not attend, and Ye Yixiong was interrogated alone. The questioning situation was the same as when the Binjiang District Court heard the case. The court adjourned after about an hour. Most of the attendees that day were from the legal profession, and there were few from other circles because they did not receive the news. The public trial was also held on the afternoon of the 14th. Two days earlier, the Shenyang Court telegraphed the Binjiang Court, instructing it to summon Zhang Wang Liqing to court. Zhang was summoned by the Binjiang Court on the 12th, ordering her to rush to Liaoning before the 14th to await trial. Zhang replied that she had not recovered from her illness and had no travel expenses, and planned not to go. The Binjiang Court did not allow it. In the evening, Zhang packed her bags and prepared to board the car, but she suddenly fainted and did not leave. On the 13th, her lawyer drafted a petition on her behalf and mailed it to the Shenyang Court, stating that she had not recovered from her illness and could not withstand the long journey, and that she had no travel expenses, requesting that the Binjiang District Court or the Special District Court be entrusted to conduct the trial on her behalf. Therefore, the second public trial of the Shenyang Court on the 14th only involved the interrogation of the defendant. Ye's original lawyer Lu _, rushed from Harbin, originally planning to appear in court to defend, but changed to standing in the audience because he did not have a Shenyang Court lawyer's execution certificate. The court temporarily designated Shenyang lawyer Zhang Shiying to defend the defendant. The key questions in the court that day focused on reading the mooncake letter in the car, and Zhang Liqing's statement at the Harbin Railway Station cafeteria before leaving that she would never return to Ping and would marry Liu Kelong, and Ye's condition when he heard it. In addition, the purchase date of the pistol, the reason for the loss of the license, and the questioning were also very long. Ye's confession was the same as in Harbin, and he insisted that the court summon Zhang Wang Liqing to confront him in court. The court announced that it would summon Zhang to continue the trial a week later because the plaintiff had not arrived. Most of the attendees that day were women, because they had heard that Zhang Liqing would be in court and wanted to see her attitude and appearance. In recent days, this case has been suspended due to the Lunar New Year, and the Shenyang Court has stopped working, so the date for the continuation of the trial has not been set. It is expected that the third public trial will be held on the 23rd or 24th. At that time, Zhang Wang Liqing may try to go there despite her illness in order to expedite the settlement of the case (February 19).</p>
<h3 id="e62">Jiangsu Chambers of Commerce Discuss Business Tax <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The draft regulations for the collection of business tax in Jiangsu Province have been passed by the 367th meeting of the provincial government and submitted to the ministry for filing. The merchants of the province believe that the tax rate violates the general outline and supplementary measures stipulated by the ministry, and the collection procedures and industry classifications are close to harsh. The chambers of commerce of various counties have successively submitted reports to the Finance Department, requesting correction, and have also sent letters to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, requesting that representatives from various counties be convened as soon as possible to come to the province to discuss concrete measures to deal with the situation. In January, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce received no less than hundreds of letters and telegrams from various counties regarding business tax matters. The association considered the urgency of the counties and, being located in the provincial capital, decided to</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>On February 25th,</p>
<p>A letter was sent inviting representatives from various counties to come to the province to discuss the matter. Currently, representatives from 20 counties have successively reported their arrival. The Finance Department believes that the draft regulations for the business tax in Jiangsu Province were formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax Preparatory Committee. The collection of business tax is to compensate for the loss of provincial treasury revenue after the abolition of likin. The likin in Jiangsu Province, which is returned to the provincial treasury, includes rice boats, pigs, and fish, totaling about 3 million yuan per year including surcharges. In the provincial government's budget for the 19th year, business tax is listed as 4 million yuan. Although the highest tax rate is listed as 20 per mille, there is no certainty whether the total annual collection can meet 4 million yuan. Therefore, there is no prejudice against the high or low tax rate (because there are no statistics on the total commercial capital and trade volume of the province, and there is a lack of standards). Even if it is as low as 0.5 per mille, it can still be implemented, but it must be based on meeting 4 million yuan as a principle. Therefore, the Finance Department is very supportive of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce's convening of representatives from various counties to come to the province for a meeting, which can report the above opinions to the representatives. Currently, the counties that have established business tax bureaus include Jiangning, Jiangdu, Wuxian, Wujiang, Songjiang, Shanghai, Wujin, Wuxi, Yixing, Zhenjiang, Huaiyin, Tongshan, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Xinghua, Taixian, Gaoyou, Changshu, Kunshan, Nanhui, Qingpu, Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, Jiangyin, Danyang, Liyang, Nantong, Rugao, Huaian, Funing, Yancheng, Jurong, Lishui, Gaochun, Yizheng, Dongtai, Baoying, Fengxian, Jinshan, Chuansha, Chongming, Jingjiang, Jintan, Haimen, Taixing, and other 46 counties. The remaining 15 counties are either temporarily held concurrently by the county magistrate or have not yet been assigned. The original plan was to start collecting taxes on March 1, but it is feared that it will be difficult to implement as scheduled because the regulations have not been approved by the ministry. It is also heard that the Finance Department believes that the annual expenses incurred by the counties in setting up bureaus to collect taxes are considerable, and it plans to discuss with the representatives of various counties to imitate the Zhejiang Province's tax recognition method, where each county recognizes and pays 4 million yuan. If the representatives of various counties agree, not only can the provincial treasury save an expenditure each year, but also the merchants can avoid the trouble of collection procedures. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, because the representatives of various counties came to the province to discuss the business tax issue, specially collected opinions from various industries and prepared concrete plans for reference. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) Business tax cannot be levied until similar likin and various miscellaneous losses are completely abolished. (1) Business tax cannot be levied again on goods that have already paid unified tax and special tax, and their direct finished products. (1) The business volume should be based on the original purchase price as the standard. (1) The high and low tax rates of various industries should be re-specified according to social conditions. (1) Wholesalers who do not sell directly to consumers should be completely exempt from business tax. (1) Chinese and foreign merchants should be taxed equally. (1) The tax rate in the inland should not be higher than Shanghai, and the collection period should not be earlier than Shanghai. (1) The collection method and period should be discussed with representatives of the chambers of commerce of various counties before the collection.</p>

<p>▲The first member representative conference of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on the 25th.

<p>▲Zhang Nanxian, the general supervisor of the Zhejiang Provincial National Assembly representative election, believes that the provincial election office should be established as soon as possible. He submitted the election procedure to the Civil Affairs Department and the Civil Affairs Conference to discuss a draft prepared by the third section. The office is scheduled to be established on March 5.</p>
<p>▲The local surtax on Zhejiang salt, which was previously collected by the Transportation Department, was transferred to the audit branch for collection on March 1 in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's order to unify the collection of taxes in various provinces.</p>
<p>▲The sand people on both sides of the Qiantang River have recently suffered from heavy rain and snow and spring tides, and the disaster is extremely severe. The Zhejiang Relief Association received telegrams from Magistrate Du of Xiaoshan and local groups requesting relief. It immediately telegraphed the county to investigate and report the disaster situation in order to allocate funds for relief. According to the investigation, 100,000 sand people were affected by the disaster, and about 30% of them are in urgent need of relief. The association immediately allocated 1,000 yuan in advance and sent personnel to the county to distribute it for relief.</p>
<p>▲The use of new weighing instruments for salt scales was stipulated to be implemented in December of the 20th year. The Zhejiang Audit Office has already issued a notice to the subordinate scale release bureaus, instructing them to investigate and report whether there are any manufacturing sites within the territory. At the same time, it consulted the Salt Transportation Department on the different weights of the new and old scales, and the national regular tax, surtax, and local regular tax rates should be revised. It plans to request a review and reply for reference and prepare for implementation.</p>
<p>▲In the past month, representatives of the rice industry in various counties have repeatedly requested exemption from the Gaoye tax, but none have been approved.

<p>The Rice Industry in Suzhou is Sluggish: Since the beginning of the year, the rice industry and shops in Suzhou have had profits. Until last year, both rice and wheat had bumper harvests. Various firms raised market prices and hoarded goods when wheat was harvested, but the factories did not have a strong appetite and gradually fell, with a difference of more than one yuan, resulting in considerable losses. By winter, the rice price had fallen even more severely, with an even greater impact. As a result, Hengshengxie Rice Firm outside Qimen lost more than 10,000 yuan, Futaoyi Rice Firm in Loumen lost 20,000 yuan, Yongtaishen Rice Firm in Northeast Street lost 20,000 yuan, Yuan_ Rice Firm in Tiger Hill lost 100,000 yuan, Yuanji Rice Firm in Bantang lost 30,000 yuan, and Tianshengheng Rice Shop in Pishi Street, Hongshuntai Rice Shop in Yinguang Lane, Licheng Rice Shop in Futun Road, etc., also suffered heavy losses. All have the idea of ​​reducing the scale and reducing the number of staff. Only Sanfeng Rice Firm outside the door, because of brisk business, made a profit of more than 10,000 yuan last year, which is considered fortunate.</p>
<p>Jiandu Prison Case Guard Appeals: In October of last year, a large number of prisoners escaped from the Jiandu District Court Detention Center. The High Court ordered the Zhenjiang District Court to thoroughly investigate whether there was any bribery. After receiving the order, the Zhenjiang District Court sent personnel to investigate. At that time, the director of the detention center had already fled in fear of crime. The guards Liu Baichuan, Tao Guisheng, Chen Shulin, Wei Benli, Wang Jiren, Zhou Wen, Lu Da Maozi, Cheng Liuxing, Tu Guilin and other nine people were brought to the Zhenjiang District Court for detention and interrogation. At the end of the judgment, each was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. The prisoners refused to accept the judgment and declared an appeal to the High Court. Yesterday (24th), Lizhen District Court sent personnel to escort Liu Baichuan and others to Suzhou and send them to the High Court for detention at the Siqian Street Detention Center pending trial.</p>

The branch address was selected in the former bamboo field outside the North Gate. It is now scheduled to officially open on March 4.</p>
<p>Unanimous Protest Against Opium Public Sales: Since the news of opium public sales spread, anti-drug groups in various places have submitted reports to the National Government, requesting that public sales be stopped and rumors be dispelled. Wuxi has always been a place where opium is rampant. Now, members of the China National Anti-Opium Association, Shi Qinglin and Zhou Qilu, have initiated a joint organization of the community to organize an anti-opium propaganda meeting and unanimously protest against opium public sales.</p>
<p>Reminders to Submit Declarations are as Urgent as Fire: The business tax registration declaration in our city has been distributed to the trade associations at the end of last year for filling in. In rural areas, letters were sent to various places for forwarding, and various stores filled them in. For merchants in urban areas who are not members of the chamber of commerce or do not have a trade association, the public security bureaus of various districts are entrusted to send police to assist in persuading them to fill them in. As of recently, only two districts in the 16 cities and townships in rural areas have filled them in. Only one of the six public security bureaus in urban areas has investigated and filled them in. Yesterday, the Business Tax Collection Bureau received instructions from the Finance Department, ordering the registration declaration forms to be reported to the bureau within ten days. If it is inconvenient, Director Yang, after receiving the order, has sent another letter to the district offices, etc., requesting them to quickly assist in persuading them to fill them in.</p>

<p>Confirmed News of Bandit Suppression in Jinshan County: Banditry is rampant in the southern part of Jinshan County, and the people are miserable. Since the end of last month, Cao Tuan, the second regiment leader of the Songjiang Security Office, ordered Bai Ying, the first battalion commander, to lead a battalion of troops to station in Jinshanwei City. At the beginning of this month, Zhang Rubil, the third battalion commander and anti-bandit commander of Songjiang Jinqing, was specially sent by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to Jinshan to jointly suppress the bandits with Battalion Commander Bai. On the 7th of this month, Magistrate Huang of the county and battalion commanders Zhang and Bai convened a suppression meeting in Zhangyan, and many proposals were resolved. Secretary Qu was assigned by the county government to be stationed in Zhangyan to maintain everything. Recently, there have been heavy snows for several consecutive days, but the two battalion commanders still took the lead and repeatedly broke up bandit nests. It is estimated that Lian, stationed in Lyuxiang, Lian and the water patrol team led by Tan, etc., arrested more than 20 bandits including Jin Mu, Li Agou, Xiao Afu, Qian Ashui, and Cheng Xueyuan, and shot and killed many on the spot. Since the 17th, the coastal passages have been selectively blocked. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the military and police in Zhejiang to jointly suppress the bandits. At dawn on the 19th, Battalion Commander Zhang personally supervised the team and instructed the land army's Lian, the water police Fan Ying, the water patrol team leader Liu, and the water patrol team leader Tan, etc., to set off in teams to encircle the Xinmiao area. The land army's Gao and the water patrol team leader Tan searched the Majiahui area and found more than ten bandits including Jin Qisheng and Liu Bad, two bandit boats, and three rifles, and rescued twelve male and female hostages from Zhejiang's Xin_ Village. It is heard that the bandit leader Taibao Ashu and others are still under siege, and the remaining bandits have fled in all directions and lost their strength. In addition, the ports are blocked and they cannot escape far. The date of eradication is approaching. According to a hostage, more than two weeks ago, he heard that bandits were discussing plans to capture Pinghu County. Recently, they secretly sent people to Shanghai to purchase a large number of firearms. Fortunately, they have not arrived yet. The government forces should take advantage of the victory to launch a large-scale attack to relieve the suffering of the people.</p>

Around 11:00 PM, just as the bride and groom were entering their room and guests had not yet fully departed, a group of over twenty robbers speaking in a Hakka accent suddenly arrived. Armed with electric batons, wooden sticks, and carrying poles, they rushed in to loot. First, they tied up the groom's grandfather, Wang Chenshi, and Wang Zhoushi with hemp ropes. Then, they ransacked chests and cabinets, resulting in losses estimated at around four to five hundred yuan. Before leaving, they forcibly injured the event's organizers Wang Sanhe, Wang Zulin, Wang Zujin, and Wang Jinjin. Wang Jinjin's injuries were the most severe. There were no police stationed in the area, and it was late at night, making it impossible to seek help. Only at dawn did they report the incident to the Second Police Substation of the Public Security Bureau and the Thirteenth Water Police Squad. Wang Jinjin, who was seriously injured, was hired a boat by his father Wang Jinshou to be sent to the Jishan Hospital in the city for treatment.</p>
<p>Western Hostages Continuously Escape Danger: Xiyang Town in the Fushan District has frequently been subjected to robberies, with many people being kidnapped for ransom. Most of them have now escaped danger. However, Wang Luxi, the mother of Wang Jiaomei (who had previously been kidnapped and later escaped by becoming Mr. Sai's wife), and her cousin Wang Guisheng are still in the bandits' den. It is now learned that the family has entrusted someone to negotiate with the bandits, using four thousand gold pieces to redeem them. They safely returned home on the 20th.</p>
<p>A Tragic Event Discovered in Shimei: Although the National Government has explicitly abolished the old lunar new year, the atmosphere at the Shimei stone quarry is still as lively as in previous years. However, in recent months, due to alternating rain and snow, the activity has slightly diminished. On the 22nd, sunlight finally emerged, and the Shimei stone quarry became even livelier. A performer named Zhu Haiyun from Yancheng, who sells horse circus performances, came to Changshu to perform, having been doing so for over twenty years. On the 23rd, the weather became warmer, and there were even more visitors. At 3:30 PM, inside Zhu's horse racing arena, preparations were being made to perform the "Three Hanging" act. A flag pole, over three zhang tall, was erected in the center of the arena, with a bamboo chair and a square table tied to it, in order to perform various skills. Unexpectedly, as the performer was demonstrating his skills, the flag pole fell down. The audience all rushed outwards, causing great chaos. The five-year-old daughter of Shao Yongdan, who owns a shoes store named Busheng, was held by apprentice Wu Bingsheng and could not escape. The pole struck the girl directly on the head, causing blood to flow profusely. Wu Bingsheng, as well as Xiao Liu, the ten-year-old son of Chen Zhangzhang from Baishoufang, and Zhang Yaozeng, who set up a rice cake shop in Qiao Tuhao, were all affected, suffering head injuries or shoulder damage. Patrols from the Public Security Bureau rushed to the scene, sending the injured to the Kang Hospital for treatment and taking the performer Zhu Haiyun and his wife to the bureau. Zhu was inconsolable. The little girl with the Shao surname, however, had brain matter protruding and was unlikely to survive. Even if she did, she would likely be disabled.</p>
<p>Another Robbery in Xushi Township: Quan Jin's family, a farmer in Lingding Bridge, Xushi Township, Fenghuang District of this county, was approached by two Jiangbei boats on the 22nd. They were docked in the river near Lingding Bridge. At the time, residents assumed they were merchant ships and did not pay attention. That evening, they landed and robbed Quan's house, ransacking chests and cabinets. As a result, dozens of ordinary clothes and more than ten silver dollars were stolen.</p>

<p>Yao Pengnian is Dismissed and Investigated: The Construction Department discovered that Yao Pengnian, the Director of the Nantong Construction Bureau, was engaging in embezzlement and corruption.

The vacant position of Director has been assigned to Feng Fu, a staff member of the department, who will act as the interim director. Feng arrived in Nantong on the 20th to allocate special funds for construction and took office on the 24th.</p>
<p>The Finance Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Verify Records: The Finance Department received a report accusing Zhang Yeyue, the former Director of the Finance Bureau, of colluding with the grain transport and tax collection staff in fraudulent activities, with discrepancies between the actual amount of money transferred and the amount collected. The county government was ordered to submit all stub records to the department. On the 23rd, they were urged to promptly dispatch the original personnel who handled the matter to the provincial capital to verify the records. The bureau director assigned Tao Tiesheng and others to go.</p>
<p>Merchant Corps Sentry Causes Trouble: Yu Decai, a patrol sentry from the Tongyi Merchant Corps stationed in Rengang, joked with a villager named Zhu on the 22nd, and made a shooting gesture with his gun.

<p>Cheng Huirong Sentenced to Eleven Months in Prison: Cheng Huirong, a teacher at the Xiwai Jizhong Primary School, was reported by Xu Zhongchen, a self-confessed Communist Party member, as being the Minister of Organization of the County Tao Branch. The County Rectification Committee sent him to the county for interrogation. He was then transferred to the Suzhou High Court for further investigation. The case has now concluded, and he has been sentenced to eleven months in prison.</p>
<p>The Money Industry Convenes to Postpone Account Settlement: The money industry is the hub of finance. Last year, most firms were affected by bad debts. In addition, the Finance Bureau, facing local financial difficulties, frequently issued local public bonds by mortgaging supplementary taxes, which could not be repaid on schedule. The overall account settlement on February 16th was difficult to complete due to continuous rain and snow, leading to poor business conditions for all firms. Feng Taiyuan even conducted an account investigation. Yesterday (the 22nd), the Money Industry Association held a meeting and resolved that in the future, when bad debts occur, each firm should naturally handle the situation before any announcement is made. After an announcement is made, no further account adjustments or private settlements are allowed. Losses and difficulties should be shared fairly.</p>
<p>Since the major settlement period was hindered by rain and snow, each household that did not complete the settlement is considered excusable and should settle by the end of February. Before settlement is completed, no credit extension or continued dealings will be permitted. If a guarantor causes trouble or fails to fulfill their obligations, they will be considered to have violated their creditworthiness. Any firm or company established by the guarantor will not be allowed to conduct business with the other firms until the guarantor's obligations are fulfilled. A meeting is scheduled for March 1st to discuss related matters.</p>
<p>An Attempted Arson by Robbers: In Chen Nianqiao, Shuangpai Seventh Section, the home of Chen Jinchi had already been robbed once. The night before last, five robbers armed with pistols came again. Chen Jinchi only left women at home. The robbers demanded five hundred yuan, but the women refused. The robbers then set fire to rice straw, but fortunately, the fire did not spread to the house.</p>

Inspector Guo has now returned to the city with the police officers and reported the incident to the county bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Suspicion Remains After the Purser is Redeemed: The Xin Ningtai ship of the Ninghai Wheel Bureau was robbed by pirates outside Haimen Chuanjiao at the beginning of this month, and over ten people, including the ship's purser, Ying Tang, were kidnapped.

It is said that when the robbery occurred, Yu remained calm and sat in his cabin without moving. The bandits looked around but did not ask him to identify Ying. Instead, they only threatened the shipowner to hand over the purser. Afterwards, the comprador, Yu, withdrew 3,500 yuan from the company's surplus funds and went to the bandits to redeem Ying. Considering the circumstances before and after the event, Yu is not without suspicion. It is reported that the ship company has filed a complaint with the authorities.</p>

<p>Third, Regarding Water Conservancy: The Jun'erzui Water Diversion Project has been undertaken by the Provincial Government in cooperation with the China International Famine Relief Commission, with a joint investment of 960,000 yuan. It is currently under construction. However, this project is a scaled-down plan. Once completed, it will irrigate one million mu of land and benefit parts of Jingyuan, Gao, and Lin counties. If the larger project of Zheng Bai's water diversion plan is implemented, combining the Jing, Zhi, Qing, Zhuo, and Qi rivers, it could restore the scale of Zheng Guo Canal, which irrigated 45,000 hectares of land. Of the eight million yuan in disaster relief bonds issued by the Central Government for Shaanxi, half is planned to be allocated to support the implementation of the larger project. The remaining funds will be supplemented by the profits generated after the success of this smaller project. Water conservancy projects in other areas will be supervised by the government, with counties raising funds to implement them. On the banks of the Wei River, ten kerosene-powered pumps will be purchased within this year to draw water for irrigation as a demonstration project for the people. Each pump will have four horsepower and cost 350 yuan including official expenses, totaling 3,500 yuan. Water level and flow stations will be established on the Wei River, Yellow River, Han River, and their major tributaries to serve as the basis for water conservancy calculations, requiring 300 yuan for surveys and 1,000 yuan for measurement costs. Fourth, Regarding Industry: The Shaanxi First Textile Factory will be established in Jiaokou Town, with 10,000 spindles, requiring approximately 1.5 million yuan. It will be jointly operated by the government and merchants. The preparations are actively underway, and the factory is expected to be established and open for operation in the 21st year of the Republic of China. The next project to be planned is a 5,000-spindle hydroelectric spinning mill in Jingyang Zhihe Town, requiring approximately 700,000 yuan. If these two factories are fully established, they can generate profits of over one million yuan annually. At the same time, the promotion of private household weaving will be even more beneficial. The cottonseeds discarded by the mill will be used to establish an oil extraction plant for utilization. There are three other industrial projects that should be prepared or researched and planned:</p>
<p>(A) Establishing a Xi'an Power Plant: The initial capacity of this plant is planned to be 500 kilowatts, requiring approximately 200,000 yuan. It is also planned to be jointly operated by the government and merchants, and preparations are underway. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Education Hall has recently added the following new agricultural facilities: (1) Expanding the experiment field: The hall has been promoting improved cotton and wheat varieties over the years, supplied by the College of Agriculture of Central University. However, due to the limited quantity, it has not been able to meet the needs of Tangshan, and relying on others is not a long-term solution. Therefore, it is planned to breed its own varieties. In addition to renting three mu of fertile land and thirteen mu of cultivated land, it has recently purchased seven and a half mu of cultivated land to prepare for the propagation and improvement of cotton and rice varieties. (2) Acquiring new agricultural implements: The hall has recently purchased a three-horsepower engine water pump, a rice thresher, and a cotton gin from the China New Agricultural Implements Promotion Association for trial use. Once successful, it will organize an irrigation cooperative to promote their use. (3) Promoting improved silkworm breeds and mulberry saplings: Last year, the hall produced 100 sheets of improved silkworm eggs to supply to students in the hall's silkworm and mulberry class and to farmers for breeding. Recently, it purchased a large number of mulberry saplings from Jinling University and distributed them to farmers for planting. With three to five years of effort from the hall, it will not be difficult to transform Tangshan into a sericulture area.</p>

A brief account of the Group A matches is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Zhenru defeated Jianhua: The performances of both sides were unremarkable. Zhenru led 22-12 in the first half. In the second half, Jianhua rallied and launched a sharp counterattack. Liu Guorong scored occasionally. Initially, Zhenru did not show weakness and the score difference was usually between four and ten points, with Zhenru in the lead. Later, Jianhua made a concerted effort and narrowed the score to 40-38, but time ran out and they lost to Zhenru by two points. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing. ▲Chidui defeated Laoda: After the opening, Laoda was immediately depressed. The score was once close at 11-13. Chizhi's long throws were very accurate, and soon the score was higher than Laoda. The first half ended 23-13. The situation in the second half was also unremarkable. As a result, Chidui scored 39 points and Laoda scored 23 points. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing.</p>
<p>▲Huadong defeated Mailing: This battle was very exciting, and the spectators were very excited. Under the mobilization, Wang Jinping of Huadong scored the first point, and Qian Jingdu and Yong also scored a goal, taking a 4-1 lead. Mailing tried hard to counterattack, and Henry and Shattai each scored, while Bei Pu made it 6-6. Brown scored a goal, surpassing Huadong with 8-6. The situation between the two sides was very fierce. Lu Zhongen made it 9-8. Since then, Mailing has been in the lead, with Huadong closely following behind. After fighting to 16-16, Henry of Mailing made a free throw, winning the first half with 17-16. At the beginning of the second half, Meng Zhi of Mailing scored first. Huadong fought cautiously, and Lu Zhongen made a great contribution. The score jumped to the lead from then on. Qian Jingyong, Ouyang, and Lu Zhongen all made contributions. Although Mai Neng tried hard to retaliate, he failed to catch up. As a result, Huadong won with 37-29. The referee was Zhang Guoxun.</p>

<p>(Reported by our reporter Wen Chu from Manila on February 13)</p>
<p>▲The Football Team's Seventh Battle...Suffered a Crushing Defeat to the Lasa Team with a Score of 3-0</p>
<p>The Jinan University's ever-victorious army, which had won five games and drawn one in six battles, had fully intended to fight the Lasa team again after drawing with them in the final, to crush this strong enemy and complete the feat. Who would have expected it to be beyond our expectations? Moreover, the situation of their defeat was also unexpected by the general audience. This letter may arrive in Shanghai on the same day as the athletes. I am very unwilling to convey this unfortunate news to the eyes of the readers, so as to reduce the joy of the welcomers, but for the sake of detailed records, it cannot be omitted. Moreover, defeat is a common occurrence in military affairs. After this lesson, or one more experience, then this setback may be the accumulation of a great success in the future. If so, then although I am unwilling to write about this tragic defeat, its situation is worth recording.</p>
<p>▲The Enemy Was Determined to Win</p>
<p>Since the first battle resulted in a draw, our army won all four subsequent battles. The enemy team officials visited the site for every match and discussed our strengths and weaknesses, and who was the strongest player. They deeply expected that there would be continued competition after the five games, so they continued to train every day. After the date of the rematch was confirmed, they even organized a cheering squad to cheer and strengthen the morale of the army. Therefore, the school invested in purchasing 500 half-price tickets and distributed them to students to attend and cheer. Before the match, the cheering squad made noises, blew trumpets and drums, and sang songs of victory to disrupt our army's mind. With a lone army expedition, it is normal to occasionally suffer setbacks after being exhausted. Moreover, their great achievements are still there, right?</p>
<p>▲The Enemy Opened the Record in Three Minutes</p>
<p>The game started at 3:00 PM on the 13th. After selecting the door to take photos in the first half, George O'Brien, a movie star from the American Fox Company traveling to the Philippines, was specially invited to kick off the ball, and the battle began. Our forwards advanced with the ball. When they reached the center, the enemy general blocked the ball, and the ball was uncertain in the center. The two sides were trying to mediate. The enemy's left inside forward suddenly went forward with the ball and shot at our goal from more than ten yards away. Xie Quanhe failed to protect it, and the cheerleaders in the audience cheered wildly for their victory.</p>
<p>▲Our Army's Counterattack Was Ineffective</p>
<p>Although our side lost this goal, we tried hard to counterattack. Once, Luo Jiajiang shot fiercely at the enemy from the rear, but was kicked by the goalkeeper. General Hei rushed up and added a kick, but was also kicked out. It can be said that these two balls had a chance to enter the city, but their iron city gate was still the General Chuan who defended Zhuozhou City the other day.</p>
<p>▲Xie Quanhe's Contribution Was Indelible</p>
<p>After being pressed twice by the enemy, because they had already gained the upper hand, they showed their long-distance skills and approached our side three times in a row, aiming at the city gate and firing three shots. All of them were saved by this newly appointed garrison envoy General Xie. Even the other side applauded and praised him. Not long after, Jiang Shanjing was knocked down by the enemy's forward when he bravely resisted the enemy. He was fined a penalty kick, but was also saved by General Xie kneeling on the ground. His contribution was truly indelible.</p>
<p>▲Unfortunately, Another Good Opportunity Was Lost</p>
<p>Center Dai took advantage of Xie Quanhe's kicked out ball and ran forward, passing the forward line and passing it to Chen Bingxiang, the ambushing army on the right. Chen took it to the left corner of the play gate and shot it temporarily because it was too high and did not enter the net. Our side forced a corner kick from this, and Mei Hongbao picked it up and sent it. The landing point was directly opposite the enemy's gate, and was punched out by the goalkeeper, which really made the overseas Chinese audience sigh.</p>
<p>▲They Were Lucky and We Were Unlucky</p>
<p>The two sides fought fiercely again. The other side got a corner kick opportunity, which was kicked by their right wing. The right inside forward was waiting for the opportunity to hit the person with his head, and it became 2-0. When the first half was about to end, General Hei got a rear pass and drove straight in. He shot fiercely to the right more than ten yards away. At this time, the enemy goalkeeper was also unable to catch it, but the ball hit the goal post and turned outward. Mei Hongbao rushed to it and was rescued by the enemy, and the first half ended.</p>
<p>▲Three Goals All Missed Opportunities</p>
<p>After the break, we changed places to fight again. Our side tried our best to fight back and wanted to regain the lost ground. Therefore, Generals Feng and Jiang, who guarded the two cities, both ventured to cross the enemy's territory and prepared to charge. Once, Center Dai and General Hei were sent a ball from the rear, and the two generals passed it to each other and advanced at the same time, breaking through the barrier straight in, which was a matter of time, but was stopped by the enemy's iron goalkeeper. Center Dai intercepted the kicked out ball and passed it to General Hei again. General Hei passed it to Fu Hexuan. When Fu kicked, it was kicked out by the iron goalkeeper again. General Hei took advantage of the situation to exert his strength again, and the ball entered the net. The referee judged it to be offside and canceled it. This was an unfortunate event. After a short period of melee, Center Dai kicked another ball in from the left, and at the same time was knocked down by the enemy's rear forward, injuring his face. The referee judged that the kicked in ball was invalid due to offside. This was the second unfortunate event. Also, because the enemy rushed in with great force, a penalty kick was awarded. Center Dai took the kick, but because he was too anxious to make a contribution, it was too high and crossed the net. This was the third unfortunate event. When the reporter saw this, his hands and feet were almost cold, just like when Mr. Zhuge set fire to Hulu Valley, Sima Yi and his sons were all seriously injured and waiting to die. But heaven did not bless the Han Dynasty, and electric rain fell, causing the Sima family and his sons to return safely. When reading The Romance of the Three Kingdoms to this point, everyone abandoned the book and sighed three times. On that day, many people were angry and left the stadium when they saw the two goals had entered and were judged invalid, and one penalty kick did not fall into the net.</p>
<p>▲The Dust of the Expedition Rolled On, But Ultimately to No Avail</p>
<p>Since our side lost these three goal opportunities, although the five tigers in the front and the three fierce players in the center worked hard to gallop and hoped to save the situation, in the 25 minutes of the second half, almost 30 minutes were spent launching a general attack in the enemy's territory. However, since their hearts were flustered, the ball was not accurate, and the opportunities to get corner kicks and shoot at the center were either too high or too off. It was truly a case of six expeditions to Qishan without gaining an inch of land, making the athletes work hard to no avail, and the audience sighing. What a pity, what a pity.</p>
<p>▲Lost Opportunity Again When the Game Was About to End</p>
<p>When the entire army was far out, the rear was empty, which was very dangerous in terms of defense. Sure enough, five or six minutes before the end of the game, the enemy's forward got the ball and attacked from the right. There was no time to rush to the rescue, and another goal was scored. Therefore, a crushing defeat was announced with a score of 3-0.</p>
<p>▲Victory Cannot Be Relied On, Relying On It Will Surely Lead to Defeat</p>
<p>Since a lone army was sent out on a series of victories, it must have had special skills to be able to achieve this. However, just like Napoleon, who swept across Europe with great power, ultimately failed in Russia. Relying on victory and being proud is also like Ruo Ao in the Spring and Autumn period being complacent in the battle of Pusao. During the welcome night of the advisory group, I heard a player talk about his battle achievements, and when he mentioned the Lasa team, he said that because he did not know the enemy's situation and everything else when he first arrived, he drew with them. After that, winning was just a matter of raising his foot. Although this cannot represent the psychology of all the players, if most people believe that they will win, then they will inevitably underestimate the enemy. Moreover, after a ceasefire of more than ten days, there was no suitable field to practice on. Compared to the enemy's continuous training, it was also a factor in the failure. Because of this defeat, a better way to control the enemy was formulated. This failure has benefited me a lot.</p>
<p>▲Popular Opinion Follows After Success</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese public, who did not understand the details of the rematch, almost all opposed this competition. The greatest reason was that five wins and one draw could be said to be a perfect record. It would have been a great joy to return with this reputation. Therefore, since the news of the continued competition came out, the youth association dormitory has been filled with criticism, hearing dozens of cases every day. Therefore, the audience on that day was also a very small number in the overseas Chinese community, and the athletes' courage to move forward seemed to be lessened as a result. By analogy, if a person owns a large army to claim hegemony, but loses popular opinion, it is appropriate for him not to be able to succeed.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Revised Closing Date <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeks Opinions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Federation of Provincial Chambers of Commerce and a letter to various industry associations in the city, saying, "Dear Sirs, on the 19th of this month, Mr. Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, proposed the following: 'Regarding the deadline for settlement in the business community, the Chamber of Commerce previously considered that the end of the lunar year was inconvenient for both farmers and merchants, and proposed to change the date of the total settlement and collection to the day before the beginning of spring. However, since the beginning of spring is on February 4th or 5th every year, it is still not very convenient to settle in the middle of the year. If the national calendar is still calculated based on the end of the lunar year every year, it will not only make the year indefinite and difficult to calculate, but it will also be greatly contrary to the central government's intention to promote the national calendar. Recalling the state of panic and doubt in the business community when the deadline for collection in the 19th year had not been determined, and the suspension of commerce, the settlement date in the 20th year should be discussed in advance to avoid digging a well when you are thirsty. Yansong read in the newspaper that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau submitted a document to the mayor, proposing that from the 20th year onwards, the fiscal year for national industry and commerce should be changed to start from March 1st of this year to the end of February of the following year. The first settlement and collection period each year is at the end of June, the second is at the end of October, and the third total settlement and collection period is at the end of February of the following year. This is in line with both government orders and commercial conditions. The Chamber of Commerce should separately telegraph the municipal government and the Executive Yuan to express its approval so that a decision can be made as soon as possible. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly.' The matter was brought up for discussion at the 12th Standing Committee meeting of the Executive Committee of the Chamber of Commerce on the 20th of this month, and it was resolved to send letters to various industry associations to solicit opinions, limiting them to reply to the meeting within two weeks, and also to send letters to various provincial chambers of commerce to solicit opinions. Therefore, we are sending this letter to inquire about your opinions on the above-mentioned revised closing date method. Please express your valuable opinions at any time so that the official authorities can adopt them. This would be greatly appreciated."</p>

<h3 id="e100">Yangtze River Six Companies Implement Business Alliance <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>▲ Open Cooperation in Freight Transportation</p>
<p>▲ Subsidizing Weaker Shipping Companies</p>
<p>Shipping companies on all routes are gradually moving towards cooperation. Since the four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo line implemented the alliance last year, business has flourished and revenue has increased significantly. This year, the alliance will continue, but the method will be slightly changed. The original plan of allocating 80% of the revenue among the four companies will be changed to 41% this year. Ning Shao will receive 11%, and Butterfield &amp; Swire, Sanpei, and China Merchants will each receive 10%. Subsequently, the six ships on the Shanghai-Taiwan route will also follow this method for joint operation, which will not only eliminate business disputes but also significantly increase freight income. It is noted that the number of operators on the Yangtze River route has been increasing in recent years, and the number of ships has also increased. Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, China Merchants, Sanpei, Ning Shao, and other six companies have always had a freight association, but it was only in name and not in reality. Freight rates were inconsistent, causing losses to the companies. Now, the six companies have also formed a large-scale alliance for cooperation on the Yangtze River route. A meeting was held yesterday to discuss the details of this matter, as detailed below.</p>
<p>▲ Butterfield &amp; Swire's Proposal: Butterfield &amp; Swire has the most ships on the Yangtze River. Recently, seeing that the freight alliance has been ineffective and various companies have been excessively discounting freight rates, which benefits passengers, it has become difficult for Yangtze River ships to maintain operations. Therefore, it was proposed to move from a freight alliance to a business alliance, following the Ningbo route model. The six companies will implement an open business alliance, and this idea was solicited from the other five companies. As a result, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, China Merchants, Sanpei, and Ning Shao all expressed their support. Therefore, representatives from each company were invited to Butterfield &amp; Swire yesterday for the first discussion meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Consultation Method: Yesterday, responsible representatives from each of the six companies went to Butterfield &amp; Swire to discuss the cooperation method of the Yangtze River business alliance. First, the representative from Butterfield &amp; Swire stated the benefits of cooperation and the dangers of not uniting. Then, the proposed cooperation method was presented. Generally, Yangtze River business will be allocated according to the number of ships and schedules of the six companies. Small companies with fewer ships will be given assistance. For example, if the old Ning Shao ship can load 1,000 tons of cargo but only loads 500 tons, the other five companies will jointly subsidize 250 tons to avoid losses. After implementation, each ship's export cargo manifest will be exchanged for review, either monthly or quarterly. Detailed methods will be decided at the second general meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives' Opinions: This alliance business is unprecedented on the Yangtze River and will be implemented for at least one year. After implementation, freight rates will not be excessively reduced, and passengers will pay according to the price, without any reduction in transportation volume. Recovering hidden losses will be most cost-effective for the shipping companies. The representative from Nisshin Kisen Kaisha suggested that the term need not be fixed and could be dissolved at any time. The discussion resulted in an initial term of nine months. Whether to continue after nine months will be decided within these three months. The representative from China Merchants proposed that special subsidies should be given to companies with fewer ships, which was met with sympathy.</p>
<p>▲ External Shipping Companies: In addition to the six companies, there are also British-owned Jardine Matheson, American-owned Yangtze Rapid Steamship Co., Chinese-owned Zhaoxing, and Nanhua shipping companies on the Yangtze River line, as well as so-called "wild chicken" Yangtze River ships. At that time, the representatives proposed whether to invite them to join the alliance. As a result, it was decided that the above shipping companies did not have regular Yangtze River ships, and the total number of ships was less than one-third of the six companies, so there was no obstacle to the alliance business. Therefore, it was not necessary to ask them to join. The meeting was adjourned immediately after the discussion.</p>
<p>▲ Freight Issue: After the price increase, each ship suffered huge hidden losses.</p>
<p>Yangtze River freight rates had already increased by 15% before the shallow water season and another 15% during the shallow water season. According to the usual practice, the shallow water fee should be abolished on March 1. Now, the representatives proposed that after the alliance, this shallow water fee should not be canceled and another 15% should be added. The Sichuan route will increase by 30% of the original amount. This issue will be decided at the second meeting when the alliance method is implemented.</p>

<p>▲ Draft Contract Submitted to Ministry for Approval</p>
<p>The aircraft ordered by Eurasia Aviation Company in Germany has been shipped to China by the Japanese ship Yao Lan Maru (transliterated from German telegram). The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd, but due to delays en route, it had not arrived yesterday. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai within a day or two. Yesterday, Li Jingzong, Director of the Operations Group of the company, went to the Shanghai General Post Office to negotiate and sign a contract for international airmail with Mr. Smith, a British official of the bureau. He took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing last night to submit the draft contract to the Ministry for approval. He will return to Shanghai for consultation within this week, and it may be signed immediately. It is also scheduled to officially open the route on April 1.</p>

<p>▲ Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Orders Closure Within One Month</p>
<p>The Municipal Government previously requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance to prohibit ordinary shops from operating savings. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to strictly prohibit this. It is reported that the bureau has now ordered all such companies to immediately stop collecting funds and refund savings, with a deadline for closure within one month. The full text is as follows: Order to comply with the matter. Repeatedly received orders from the Municipal Government based on previous inquiries from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the China Innerwear Weaving Factory, Xinxin Department Store, Taidong Bookstore, and the Women's Virtue Savings Department jointly established by the Chinese and French Chinese and Western Pharmacies are all ordinary shops operating savings and should be prohibited. Furthermore, it was recently reported in the newspapers that the Shanghai Oriental Savings Association issued a notice of savings awards, and the Youhua Silver Company is preparing for full funding and revealing advertisements on the second day of each month, and the Shanghai Tongchang Car Company is handling savings car purchase department credit savings department and other items, all of which are illegal operations and should be strictly prohibited to prevent future troubles and uphold the law. Although Sincere and Wing On companies are registered with the Hong Kong government, the companies were originally organized with Chinese investment. Now that they have established companies in Shanghai, they should abide by Chinese laws and regulations and cannot disregard the law just because they are registered in Hong Kong. Therefore, we are instructed to comply with and handle and report separately. I hereby order that commercial establishments operating savings are illegal operations with many malpractices. This bureau is separately prohibiting them. The establishment of companies should especially strictly abide by the Provisional Rules for Company Registration and submit them to the competent authorities for registration for future reference. In accordance with the previous order, in addition to separately ordering compliance, you are hereby ordered to immediately stop collecting funds for the savings department you are operating and return the savings of each household within one month. The details of the closure should be reported for verification and transfer within ten days of the arrival of this document. Those companies that have not been registered in accordance with the regulations should also promptly apply for registration. This matter concerns the prohibition order and must not be regarded as a mere formality, lest it cause inconvenience. This order is imperative.</p>

<p>▲ Managed by Chinese After Completion</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the sports field of the Chinese Athletic Advancement Association on Route Pére Robert in the French Concession is owned by the American oil magnate Rockefeller, covering approximately one hundred acres. Rockefeller has now agreed to allocate funds to build a hospital specifically for Chinese patients and has pledged to donate 2 million yuan for construction. However, this will only be allocated after the Chinese side has raised 2 million yuan on its own. According to this initiative, the local gentry and merchants have long felt the lack of a well-equipped modern hospital specifically for Chinese patients. When the lease agreement between the Athletic Advancement Association and the Rockefeller Foundation expired, the field was deemed the most suitable location for building a hospital. Therefore, Liu Ruiheng, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, and others were elected to form a committee to contact the Rockefeller Foundation in New York. A telegram has been received from the United States stating that they have generously agreed and that Rockefeller will donate half of the construction costs. The remaining half is planned to be raised from the public to accumulate a large sum. Furthermore, one unique aspect of this initiative is that the architectural design and post-completion management will be entirely managed by Chinese.</p>

<p>▲ Rename Xianji Road to Guangqi Road</p>
<p>Xianji Road in the city has the Ming Dynasty Xu Guangqi Pavilion Lao Fang. The Municipal Public Works Bureau proposed its removal to widen the street. Xu's descendants and Shanghai gentry Ma Liang and others submitted separate requests to the National Government, the Municipal Government, and the Public Works Bureau to preserve it in order to admire their predecessor. Yesterday, it was heard that the Public Works Bureau notified Xu's descendants, stating that the Pavilion Lao Fang had been damaged over the years and there was concern that vehicles would collide, posing a risk. The Municipal Government has approved its removal, but Xu Wending Gong (Xu Guangqi) made contributions to the country. After the removal of the Pavilion Lao Fang, Xianji Road will be renamed Guangqi Road to commemorate him, and Xu's family will be allowed to erect a stone tablet at the original site of the Pavilion Lao Fang to admire their predecessor. All of Xu's Pavilion Lao Fang land will be acquired by the city at a price. It is heard that Xu's descendants are still considering this matter at length and will respond again.</p>

<p>▲ Anti-Smuggling Committee Replies that it has Inquired and Handled</p>
<p>In November of last year, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs seized a large quantity of opium, totaling 19,400 pounds, on the German cargo ship Klopstock. Because the opium was being smuggled by the Japanese, the Japanese authorities made great efforts to release it, claiming it was being transported to Dalian. This opium is still held at the Jianghai Customs and no measures have been taken. The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society has sent a letter to the Central Anti-Smuggling Committee, requesting it to inquire with the Customs to burn the opium in order to show China's determination to ban opium. Yesterday, the Central Anti-Smuggling Committee replied, stating that the letter concerning the seizure of a large quantity of opium on a German cargo ship by the Jianghai Customs in November of last year had been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Customs to burn it in advance. However, no reply has been received, so they are urged to expedite the matter. It has been decided by the 74th Committee Meeting of the Committee to inquire with the Ministry of Finance again, ordering the Jianghai Customs to comply and burn it in advance. In addition to forwarding the case as is, a corresponding reply is hereby issued. Please investigate and comply. Sincerely, Chinese National Anti-Opium Society.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Ministry of Industry Convenes Conference on Silkworm Seed Inspection in Shanghai <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Imported foreign silkworm seeds were previously inspected by personnel from the Silkworm Seed Inspection Office of the former Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. The office has now been ordered to merge with the Silk Inspection Department of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. In the future, the import of foreign silkworm seeds will still need to be reported to the bureau for inspection and certification before being allowed to enter the country. The Ministry of Industry believes that the issue of silkworm seed inspection is of great importance to China's silk industry and experts should be convened for joint discussion. Therefore, Xu Tinghu, Director of the Agricultural Department, and Zou Bingwen, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, have requested the agricultural administrative authorities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as silkworm schools and institutions, to send representatives to a meeting at the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 23rd of this month. Xu Tinghu, Director of the Ministry of Industry, He Yushu, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Agriculture and Mining, Wang Jiaxian, representative of the Zhejiang Construction Department, Shao Shenpei of the Jiangsu Women's Sericulture School, He Shangping of the International United Sericulture Improvement Association, Wu Huanru of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Deng Ronghui of the Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Cai Wuji, Miao Zhongxiu, and Li An of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau attended. Xu Tinghu presided over the meeting and began with a speech, stating that China's silk exports have been sluggish in recent years, especially last year. Remedial measures can be divided into fundamental and symptomatic aspects. The symptomatic approach is to issue public bonds for relief. The fundamental aspect is the silkworm seed issue. The quality of silkworm seeds directly affects the quality and quantity of silk. In recent years, the improvement of silkworm seeds has been very successful, gaining the trust of farmers. However, speculators have taken advantage of this to mix inferior seeds under the guise of improved silkworm seeds, which is extremely harmful. In order to fundamentally remedy this situation, regulations on silkworm seed management will be proposed to the Ministry in the future. Subsequently, He Yushu, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Agriculture and Mining, reported on the progress of managing silkworm seed in Jiangsu Province over the past year, stating that silkworm seed inspection is necessary due to various reasons, but in reality, there are also various difficulties. The issue is complex and not just a matter for any one party. He provided detailed facts to prove this. Next, Miao Zhongxiu and Li An, Director and Deputy Director of the Silk Inspection Department of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, successively reported on the bureau's handling of silkworm seed inspection since taking over, and discussed the inspection methods and standards. Afterwards, various experts expressed their opinions. At 12:00, after a luncheon at the Bankers Association, the meeting resumed at 1:30 and the contents of the silkworm seed management regulations were discussed in detail. After the meeting ended at 4:00, Cai, Deputy Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Miao, Director of the Silk Inspection Department, led the participants to visit various departments of the bureau before dispersing.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Two Proposals from the National Coal Production and Sales Association <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reduce National Coal Transportation Costs</p>
<p>▲ Designate Vehicles for Joint Transportation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that transportation has gradually recovered in recent years and has decided to convene a National Commercial Transportation Conference in Beijing on March 1, inviting commercial associations, financial institutions, transportation companies, and other industries from across the country to discuss the development of railway services and the rectification of all matters. The National Coal Production and Sales Association of the Republic of China has been approved to send representatives to attend. The proposals of the association are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram of Representatives' Names: To the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing. Regarding the Ministry's letter approving the association to send representatives to attend the National Commercial Transportation Conference, the association has designated Fang Jiaobo as the attending representative and Yu Shunqing as the observer representative. Two proposals are submitted, along with the names of the representatives, and telegraphed to the Ministry for approval and discussion. The Chairman of the National Coal Production and Sales Association of the Republic of China, Lin Kanghou, Standing Committee Members Fang Jiaobo, Hong Yanbin, Sheng Pihua, and Liu Yumen, respectfully.</p>
<p>▲ Proposal 1: Request to reduce national coal transportation costs and issue a general order to all routes to eliminate extortionate fees outside of transportation costs. (Reason) The price of coal in China often differs greatly between the mining company and the user, with the difference being several times the price. While there are considerable profits for coal merchants and commissions for intermediaries, transportation costs account for almost half of the coal price. Although national coal transportation costs are already classified as sixth class, it is still necessary to request a special reduction during this period of national coal decline. Moreover, during the era of warlord separatism, individuals withheld vehicles and extorted supplies from coal merchants who requested to borrow vehicles to transport coal. The amount often exceeded the transportation costs. Coal merchants had no choice but to pay with great pain. Now that the country is unified and the warlords have been eliminated, this type of extortion has largely become a precedent that has not been abolished, resulting in additional burdens on coal merchants. The cost is high and the selling price is high, making it impossible to compete with foreign coal. This is also a major reason why national coal cannot develop. It is proposed to the general meeting for discussion and resolution. (Method) Request the Ministry of Railways to reduce national coal transportation costs to show its support, and present a decree to the National Government ordering all routes, military police, and other departments not to extort extra fees, thereby increasing the cost of national coal and making it impossible to compete with foreign coal.</p>
<p>▲ Proposal 2: Request to issue a general order to all routes to designate vehicles for joint transportation of national coal. (Reason) The inability to develop national coal in China is due to various reasons, but transportation inconvenience is the biggest obstacle. It goes without saying that some areas are located in remote areas and are not connected by railways. Even mines along the railways also feel the difficulty of transportation. It is sometimes congested and sometimes clear, and cannot be fully transported. There are even cases where not a single vehicle can be obtained for years, resulting in a surplus of supply and a shortage of demand. Suppliers have mountains of coal that cannot be transported. The accumulation of coal poses a risk of burning, and miners are concerned about their livelihoods. Mine owners are sitting on their capital, often leading to failure. Demanders originally use national coal, but if it is available, the price may not be cheaper than foreign coal. If it is in short supply, foreign coal takes the opportunity to increase prices, resulting in losses. The losses of both parties are due to transportation inconvenience. It is proposed to the general meeting for discussion and resolution. (Method) Request the Ministry of Railways to issue a general order to all routes to estimate the amount of coal produced by each mine, designate a number of vehicles specifically for coal transportation, and not to be used for other purposes at any time. It also orders connecting routes to jointly transport coal to avoid interruption in the middle and to facilitate the smooth sale of national coal.</p>

<p>▲ Decides on Principles for Implementing Business Tax in This City</p>
<p>The Business Tax Research Committee organized by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held its second committee meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday. Wang Yansong was elected as chairman and the meeting proceeded with formalities. First, Yan Egsheng reported on the previous resolution and the full text of the review committee's report. Then, according to the simplified rules of the subcommittee, Wang Yansong was elected as the chairman of this committee. Then, the full text of the review report was discussed. The principles for implementing business tax in this city are: (1) Except for luxury businesses, the tax rate should be the same and not exceed 0.2%; (2) It is better to have a low tax rate and widespread collection than a high tax rate that is difficult to implement; (3) Collection methods should be simple and avoid harassment. It is heard that all review reports have been passed by the committee meeting and submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion. They will then be submitted to the representative of the Municipal Finance Bureau as a basis for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Silk and Satin Industry Requests Exemption from Business Tax for Whole Sale Industry <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>▲ Telegrams to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing regarding the exemption of all silk and satin industries from business tax, stating: "The case of the silk and satin industry requesting a reduction in the business tax rate was previously submitted by the Ministry of Industry to the Executive Yuan and approved, ordering all provinces and cities not to exceed 0.2%, which shows the utmost concern for maintaining people's livelihoods and promoting domestic products. We are deeply impressed and grateful. It is especially beneficial to the silk merchants and the future of sericulture. We would like to further state that if the silk and satin factories have already had central government special taxes levied, all manufacturing industries and their directly established whole sale industries can be exempted from business tax, as clearly instructed in the Ministry of Finance's telegram reply to the association. This is because manufacturing industries are already burdened with special taxes and cannot be required to pay business tax again, causing double taxation. The scope of manufacturing industries naturally includes large-scale silk factories and small-scale handicraft workshops. In terms of nature, both are manufacturing. In terms of ability, small-scale workshops are weaker than factories. In terms of products, both those produced by workshops and those produced by factories should bear the same special taxes. Whole sale industries directly established by silk factories can be exempted from business tax. Whole sale issuance centers jointly entrusted by small-scale workshops, commonly known as silk shops, should also be exempted. As for the so-called 'merchants' in commerce, they are more like managers, only responsible for receiving and paying and not for profit. Although they seem to have the name of a business, they do not have its organization. The handling fees they earn may not even reach 0.01%, and the goods they handle have already been taxed with special taxes. In terms of tax laws and abilities, they are not able to bear business tax. We sincerely request the Ministry to issue a clear instruction so that we can follow it and avoid double taxation. The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Ministry Order to Revise Tax Rate for Paint and Rosewood Industry <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Paint Industry Trade Association stated that the business tax regulations of Jiangsu Province stipulate excessively high tax rates for the paint, rosewood, and Western-style furniture industries, making it difficult to bear. Rosewood utensils and Western-style furniture are necessary household items, but they are regarded as luxury goods, which is not in line with the intention of maintaining people's livelihoods and promoting craftsmanship. The paint and furniture industries have repeatedly convened meetings. Based on the standard of no more than 0.2% as stipulated in Article 4 of the Ministry's outline, they have requested various industry trade associations and tax regulations research committees to send representatives with written statements to Beijing to petition for a reduction in the tax rate. The heads of various departments of the National Government agreed to adopt the proposal as much as possible and requested the Ministry of Finance to verify and handle the matter based on the situation. The Ministry of Finance's reply is as follows: "To the Shanghai Paint Industry Trade Association, we have read your telegram. The draft of the Jiangsu Business Tax Regulations has been submitted to the Ministry by the provincial government. The tax rate for the paint and rosewood industry should be revised separately and the provincial government should be consulted for implementation. Please be informed, signed Ministry of Finance."</p>

<p>▲ Reported to Deng Zhenquan for Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Wenyi, a 25-year-old native of Nantong and battalion commander of the garrison camp of the Wusong Fortress Command, suffered a ruptured blood vessel in his nose a few days ago, causing profuse bleeding. He was escorted to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road in this city by an aide from the fortress command. After arriving at the hospital, doctors performed a hemostatic operation and the bleeding stopped. His condition was very good. Unexpectedly, Commander Zhang's health weakened due to excessive blood loss. On the morning of the 22nd of this month, his condition suddenly deteriorated and he passed away at around 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Since Commander Zhang's family was far away in Nantong, the fortress command urgently telegraphed his family to come to Shanghai. An aide was sent to the hospital to make arrangements to place Zhang's body in the hospital's mortuary for his family to claim. After Zhang's family received the telegram, his brother and a relative traveled to Shanghai by boat from Tongzhou and arrived on the previous day. Personnel from the fortress command accompanied them to purchase a coffin and went to Baolong Hospital for the funeral. When the hospital attendant opened the mortuary, the corpse was not in the mortuary. After inquiries, it was found in the dissection room. The attendant then carried the body to the mortuary. After Zhang's brother and others examined the body, they observed a straight knife mark and suture marks running from the neck to the lower part of the body, indicating that the entire body had been dissected by the hospital. Zhang's family was deeply saddened by the sight and immediately photographed the body in front of the hospital director as evidence. The body was temporarily placed in the coffin and kept in the mortuary. Zhang's family left the hospital and reported the matter to Deng Zhenquan, commander of the fortress, for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Statement from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Traffic Department Workers' Reorganization Committee <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>▲ Denies Anti-Chen Leaflets</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Traffic Department Workers' Reorganization Committee stated that recently, someone has been distributing leaflets in the name of all colleagues in the Traffic Department, criticizing the newly appointed Chief of the Traffic Department, Chen Chengshi. A meeting was convened on the afternoon of the previous day and it was concluded that the leaflets were actually forged by a small number of people and were not related to the name of all colleagues in the Traffic Department. It was decided to send a letter to the Railway Bureau to investigate the matter thoroughly and issue the following declaration: "Recently, it has been discovered that unscrupulous individuals have been distributing leaflets in the name of the colleagues in the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Traffic Department, fabricating facts and damaging the reputation of Chen Chengshi, Chief of the Traffic Department. This is akin to framing and is like the work of ghosts and goblins. All traffic employees of the entire route are indignant. In addition to issuing a general order to the branch secretaries, team leaders, and all members of the committee to thoroughly investigate the source and report it at any time so that they can be brought to justice and prevent traitors, we are especially afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth and will misunderstand. We hereby declare that the leaflets have nothing to do with all of our traffic employees."</p>

<h3 id="e113">Store Employees Can Join Trade Associations <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>▲Representation Rights Confirmed</p>
<p>▲Old Terms and Conditions Guaranteed</p>
<p>▲No Worries about Improved Treatment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters' Public Training Committee, considering Article 10 of the Implementation Rules of the Trade Association Law, which states, "Each company or firm may send one or two representatives, limited to managers or owners. However, if the average number of store employees in the past year exceeds fifteen, one additional representative may be sent, elected by the store employees," found the meaning of the phrase "one additional" ambiguous. It proposed the following remedial measures: (1) The word "may" in Article 10 of the Implementation Rules of the Trade Association Law, which states, "If the average number of store employees exceeds fifteen, one additional representative 'may' be sent," is vague and ambiguous. It should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan of the National Government for clarification and amendment. (2) If store employees and workers, due to actual needs, request employers to improve treatment, they may jointly petition the local party and government authorities for mediation. (3) All terms and conditions already signed between store employees and workers in various industries and the respective employers shall be reviewed and protected by the local party and government authorities. Those that violate existing laws and regulations shall be jointly ordered to be revoked. The above three points have already been submitted to the Central Party Headquarters for approval and record. Yesterday, the committee received Instruction No. 13225 from the Central Training Department approving the request. The original instruction is recorded as follows: "Received your report.

<h3 id="e118">Special News from the Shipping Industry <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲Escort Team Has Boarded the Ship Yesterday Shanghai Steamer of the Three Companies has added an escort team. Thirty-two police officers have been recruited, originally intending to send them on board early. Later, due to the Public Security Bureau's failure to issue weapons and the increase in water fees, it caused opposition from all parties and could not be resolved. Recently, Sanbei Zhaoshang Ningshao, etc., believing that the naval police have been recruited and the sea bandits in Zhejiang are unstable, dispatched personnel to each ship yesterday to protect passengers without waiting for the issuance of weapons and the resolution of the fee increase, and urged the Public Security Bureau to issue firearms quickly for transfer to the escort.</p>
<p>▲French Ship "Shangjiang" Had an Accident According to Dalu News, this port received news that the French ship "Fuyuan" (transliteration) was sailing to Chongqing and ran aground and sank on Saturday 80 miles upstream from Yichang, blocking the river. Therefore, all ships going to Chongqing are now docked in Yichang and cannot move forward. It is not yet known whether there were any casualties in the ship's accident.</p>
<p>▲"Changan" Ship Tea Room Beaten Up The Sanbei Company's "Changan" ship returned to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday and immediately set off for the capital. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, its tea room reported to the Seamen's Union that it had been beaten by part of the comprador. It is said that the reason was that on the 17th of this month, when the ship was in Hankou, the comprador Li Changqing gave rewards to the sailors, etc., but did not give them to the tea room. The tea room representatives Zhuo Ciku questioned the comprador, which led to an argument and a conflict. Li Changqing ordered Xi Hui, Qi Abing, etc. to drive the tea room out, which led to a mutual beating. As a result, Zhao Shichun from the tea room was injured and fell into the water. He was later rescued. Zhang Guangcheng, Tang Shougen, Sheng Fusheng, etc. were also beaten and injured. Ren Jinwang, a middle rudder tea room worker, died from excessive fright during the beating. It was not discovered until the 18th, and the Hankou Court was immediately notified for inspection and the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment. The body was coffined by the Sanbei Company. The court is still waiting for the family members of the deceased to appear in court before making a judgment. The tea room workers requested the union to take charge, so it has not yet been resolved. The ship has already gone to Beijing and must wait for its return to Shanghai before negotiations can be held.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Western Businesses Agree that the Public Works Bureau Should Purchase the Dahua Hotel <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Harris, manager of the Yongming Life Insurance Company in this port, believes that the Dahua Hotel in West Shanghai is scheduled to stop operating the ballroom at the end of March and will be renovated into housing. It is a pity to destroy it because Shanghai lacks gardens and assembly halls. Moreover, the Public Works Bureau's existing buildings will soon be insufficient for office space. He specially wrote to various Western newspapers, advocating that the Public Works Bureau issue public bonds to purchase the property, using the Italian Garden as the city hall and the winter performance venue for the orchestra, and gradually constructing new office buildings on the remaining land, relocating all departments and libraries of the Public Works Bureau, and selling the existing site on Fuzhou Road. With the high land price of Fuzhou Road, if a good price can be obtained, it can not only recover the public bonds, but may even have an extra one or two million taels to cover construction costs. Yesterday, a reporter from the Da Mei Evening News interviewed various key foreign businessmen to ask for their opinions on this plan. They generally expressed their approval, as long as the Public Works Bureau can benefit from it. For example, the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, Fessenden, said, "This seems to be an excellent plan, as long as the Public Works Bureau can sell its existing site and at the same time purchase the original site of the Dahua Hotel at a fair price." However, if the existing site cannot be sold at a good price, and the Dahua property is rashly purchased and huge sums are spent on building houses, it would be an unwise move. As for the location, it is also very suitable. The municipal government does not necessarily have to be located in the central area. There are many precedents in Western countries. Moreover, the bureau's existing buildings are already narrow and insufficient for office space, and there is a need to expand. Other people, such as Raven of the American Feng Bank, Ward of Huiluo Company, Priest Macbeth, and Ismail, a large restaurant merchant, also had roughly the same opinion.</p>

<h3 id="e125">High Court Opens Trial to Investigate Hong Shen's Suspected Reactionary Activities <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲ Due to a Telegram from the Hankou Headquarters</p>
<p>▲ Hong Voluntarily Surrenders to the Police Station Before Arrest</p>
<p>▲ Hong's Interrogation Process at the Court Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Allowed Bail After Investigation in Court</p>
<p>▲ Hong Shen Goes to the Police Station to Surrender: Hong Shen (style name Qianzai), professor at Fudan and Jinan Universities, and his friend Tian Han, etc., rented a house in the Weihaiwei area of the International Settlement last August to establish the Modern Arts and Sciences Research Institute. Hong served as the director. Later, the authorities discovered that the institute was organized by reactionaries and notified the Special District Court to close it down to prevent unrest. Half a year passed, and it was thought that no further problems would arise. Unexpectedly, the Staff Office of the Land, Sea, and Air Force Headquarters in Hankou recently discovered that Hong Shen was also a reactionary member of the institute. Since Hong lived in the International Settlement, they should request extradition from the Consular Body. They specially requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle the matter according to the law. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering that there was already a formal court in the International Settlement, could directly conduct the trial. Therefore, it ordered the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to arrest Hong and interrogate him. Wang Zhennan, the Chief Prosecutor of the High Court's Second Branch, immediately issued an arrest warrant and handed it over to the General Police Station for execution. However, since Hong lived in the French Concession, it could not be directly executed. Hong had already heard about it, so he, along with lawyer Zhan Jifeng, went to the police station to surrender at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ First Investigation Court Session: Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the High Court's Second Branch. Many people were present to observe the proceedings. The initial procedure for this case required investigation, so Chief Prosecutor Wang took the stand for interrogation. Investigation court sessions in ordinary courts are usually not open to the public, but the situation in the International Settlement is different. According to the agreement on the recovery of jurisdiction, investigation court sessions can also be open to the public, and lawyers are allowed to appear in court. However, lawyers can only state opinions and cannot argue. Therefore, Hong's lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, and the police station's lawyer, Gan Jingxian, both appeared in court successively. This was the first time since its establishment that the High Court's Second Branch had held an open investigation court session.</p>
<p>▲ Tian Han Invited Me to Be the Director: According to Hong's confession, Wang Prosecutor interrogated that his ancestral home was Changzhou, he was 38 years old, and he lived on Rue Bourgeois in the French Concession. Regarding the details of the Modern Arts and Sciences Research Institute, allow me to explain in detail. Because I have quite a bit of research in drama and enjoy a little fame in society, schools often invite me to serve as a director or principal. However, I always refuse, except for drama schools, because that is what I like. Tian Han and Ouyang Yuqian are both dramatists and my friends. Ouyang has been hired by Chen Mingshu, the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, to go to Guangdong to establish a drama research society with an affiliated drama school, and he sent a letter inviting me to be the principal. The following year, Tian Han and his friends wanted to organize the Modern Arts and Sciences Research Institute and asked me to serve as the director to attract attention. Because it was difficult to refuse, I agreed, but I stated that I would not be responsible.</p>
<p>▲ Searched for Three Hours: Tian's finances were quite tight. The equipment in the institute was all borrowed. The rent for the institute was 200 yuan per month, but the institute only allowed 150 yuan. Later, I mediated and agreed on a monthly rent of 160 yuan. The institute's courses were divided into four categories: drama, society, literature, and art. I was in charge of drama, Tian was in charge of literature, Yang Zhiming was in charge of society, and a person named Xu was in charge of art. When school started, surprisingly, not a single person studied drama. I was very disheartened, so I changed to teaching a course on "pronunciation and elocution." However, most students were unwilling to be trained by me, so I only went to the institute two or three times and taught one class. I generally did not inquire about other matters. Later, a student from the Nanguo Drama Society, which was run by Tian Han, was arrested in Nanjing by the Garrison Headquarters. Tian's residence was also in the French Concession of this port. The Garrison Department, together with the French police, sent personnel to Tian's home to search and seized several books and arrested two people. They also came to my house to search. Because I had a lot of books, the search took three hours that day.</p>
<p>▲ The Process of Severing Ties: Later, I submitted a report to the Municipal Party Headquarters, stating that I could not bear criminal responsibility because of friendship. The Municipal Party Headquarters advised me to sever ties with the institute at that time. On October 5th, I followed the advice and resigned from the position of director and also resigned from the professorships at various universities. Later, on October 7th, I published a statement in the newspaper declaring that I would sever ties with the academic world and specialize in screenwriting for the Mingxing Film Company. Later, the institute was closed down by the government due to reactionary activities. Unexpectedly, the landlord actually demanded the rent owed from me. I hired a lawyer to negotiate with the landlord, stating that I had no relationship with the institute and that a contract had been signed by others when renting the house, and there was a legitimate shop guaranteeing it, so they should reason with the guarantor. I only knew a person named Zhu among the staff of the institute, who is now being treated for illness in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>▲ Met with Chen Lifu in Nanjing: Wang Prosecutor asked what the Central Party Headquarters' punishment of you was for. Hong confessed that it was also related to this case. Chen Lifu, the Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, even ordered me to go to Nanjing to inquire in person. So, between December 17th and 18th, I went with Zhu Yingpeng, a supervisor of the Municipal Party Headquarters. After meeting with Mr. Chen, I was treated very favorably. Later, I heard that my punishment had been revoked. The court also asked if the students of the institute said that the researchers in the institute were Marxist. Hong confessed that he did not ask about anything in the institute and knew nothing about it. The court then gave him an English lecture to read and asked if Hong had seen it. Hong confessed that he had never seen it before and claimed that Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Party Committee and Social Affairs Bureau, could now prove everything about the advice of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the situation of severing ties with the institute.</p>
<p>▲ Pan Gongzhan Testifies in Court: At that time, Director Pan was sitting alone in the audience listening to the trial. Chief Prosecutor Wang immediately ordered the court clerk to ask Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, who was sitting in the audience, whether he was willing to testify in the case. Director Pan indicated that he was willing and immediately went to the witness stand to report his name, age, and occupation. Wang Prosecutor then said to Pan, "This court is acting on a document from the Staff Office of the Land, Sea, and Air Force Headquarters in Hankou, forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that Hong Shen founded the Modern Arts and Sciences Research Institute to secretly train communists. Now, according to Hong Shen's confession, he had already followed the advice of the Municipal Party Headquarters and severed ties with the institute, and he claims that you know the whole story. Can you give a detailed account of what happened?"</p>
<p>▲ Written Advice from the Municipal Party Headquarters: Director Pan immediately stated, "This matter started near the end of last summer vacation, when schools were preparing to open. Because I saw newspaper advertisements for the Modern Arts and Sciences Research Institute, with Hong Shen's name as the director, I had a friendly relationship with Hong and could not bear to see him being used by others. I specially advised him not to take the position of director. At that time, Hong only said that he was helping a friend who strongly urged him, only in name, and not responsible. Later, the Municipal Party Headquarters formally advised him in writing to sever ties with the institute as soon as possible, otherwise, if reactionary actions were found in the institute in the future, the director could not be excused. Hong then accepted the advice and immediately replied to the Municipal Party Headquarters, saying that he had not only resigned from the position of director of the Modern Arts and Sciences Research Institute and severed ties with the institute, but also resigned from the professorships at other schools he held, so as to avoid being suspected of inciting young students. After that, he would specialize in directing movies for the Mingxing Film Company." ▲ The Central Government's Investigation: When I met Hong, I still asked about the content of the research institute and who rented the premises. According to Hong, he had been friends with Tian Han for a long time, and Tian bothered him with the position of director, so he could not refuse to help. However, from beginning to end, he only went to the institute once to teach a class, and after receiving advice, he also suspected that there was another purpose, so he immediately resigned. The Central Party Headquarters' investigation of this matter was actually based on reports received before the institute was sealed. Because the Municipal Party Headquarters had not yet reported to the Central Government about the Municipal Party Headquarters' advice to Hong Shen to sever ties and Hong Shen's acceptance of the advice. Chen Lifu, a comrade of the Secretary of the Central Party Headquarters, wanted to understand the truth of the matter, so he specially invited Hong Shen to Nanjing to inquire about everything in person. Comrades from the Municipal Party Headquarters, in a private capacity, prepared a letter of introduction for Hong and sent a comrade with Hong. Later, according to Hong's return to Shanghai, he had met with important people from the Central Government, and all the suspicions of the Central Government had been understood. This was last month. Hong's departure from the institute was before the institute was sealed. After Hong went to Nanjing to explain, the Municipal Party Headquarters thought that the matter was over.</p>
<p>▲ The Party Headquarters Sends Documents for Reference: Recently, I heard that the court needed Hong to appear in court because of the Ministry's order. Yesterday, I received Hong's words, asking me to testify for him in court and declare the past. So, I advised Hong to surrender, so he surrendered to the police station yesterday. The Party Headquarters feared that the official letter would not be clear enough, so it sent me to listen to the trial in the court and report the process of the case to the court for reference. Wang Prosecutor then asked Director Pan, "What was the reason for the Garrison Headquarters' previous investigation of Hong Shen?" Pan replied, "It was also because of this matter. The Garrison Headquarters sent people to Hong's house to search for three hours." He also asked, "Does the Municipal Party Headquarters have documents to prove the handling of this matter?" Pan said, "I need to check it and follow the court's order to return to the Party Headquarters and order someone to copy a copy of the documents related to this matter and send it to the court for reference."</p>
<p>Hong Shen Granted Bail in Court: Wang Prosecutor then asked Hong Shen whether he had any documents to prove what he had stated to the Central Party Headquarters. Hong confessed that there were no documents. After understanding at that time, Chen Lifu was quite favorable to him. Hong said to this point, and then changed his tone, saying that the court had just instructed that he was handling this case according to a document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he had an enemy in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Wang Prosecutor knew that Hong had misunderstood the procedures for handling this case, so he instructed him, "This case originated from the Staff Office of the Land, Sea, and Air Force Headquarters. Because you live in the International Settlement, it was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and handled through diplomatic channels. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering that there are Chinese courts in the International Settlement, did not need to deal with foreigners, so it transferred the order to this court for review. There is no intention. You must not misunderstand. This case still needs to be investigated. You should provide a guarantor and leave to await instructions. Whether or not to prosecute in the future will be officially notified in writing." Hong's lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, had already taken the newspaper with the advertisement about the settlement of the Daguangming case and presented it to the court, and requested Zhou Jianyun, the manager of Mingxing Company, to be Hong's guarantor. Wang Prosecutor immediately approved it and announced the adjournment. It was exactly twelve o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Wrong Bride Kidnapped <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>▲ Widow Vows Chastity</p>
<p>▲ Neighbor Suffers Loss</p>
<p>A comic kidnapping scene occurred in Yangjiadu, Pudong, the night before last. The bride turned out to be a stranger. The investigation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Secretly Planning to Marry a Widow: Tian Guohua, also known as Tian Yangxiao, from Taizhou, is 25 years old and lives in a thatched house at No. 204 behind Yu's Temple in Pudong. He makes a living as a stevedore unloading foreign pine boards. His family is poor, and he has never had a wife. There is a middle-aged widow in the nearby Caonitang area who is slightly attractive. Tian wants to take advantage of her, but he has no opportunity. He secretly conspires with a friend, who designs a plan for him, lobbying the widow's aunt. They agree on a price of 110 yuan, with 60 yuan paid in advance. The deal is settled, and the 60 yuan is paid immediately.</p>
<p>▲ Agreeing to Kidnap the Bride at Dusk: Unexpectedly, the widow learns of this news. Since her husband died not long ago and her mourning clothes have not been removed, she is too sad to do anything else. Therefore, she is determined to remain chaste and vows not to comply. The aunt sees that the matter has reached a stalemate and that the 60 yuan received is difficult to repay, so she agrees with Tian to order the daughter-in-law to get water at the tiger stove on the stone bridge embankment in the East Market of Yangjiadu from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM the night before last, and Tian will kidnap her to his home for marriage. As planned, Tian is eager to fulfill his dream, but he does not expect to create a comic scene for people to talk about.</p>
<p>▲ Kidnapping Someone Else's Wife by Mistake: The day before yesterday, Tian slightly arranged the room at home, making it look like a new room, and set up a ceremony table outside the room with incense and candles, pretending to be a wedding hall. He also recruited more than ten friends to wait around the tiger stove. However, the widow had been secretly informed in advance and pretended to agree to buy water but did not go. There was a man named Teng Xuezi from Taizhou, who lived in the nearby Laji Hall. He was 34 years old and worked as a clerk in a brewery. His wife, Chen, was one year younger and looked quite similar to the widow. At that time, she was holding a child and happened to be carrying a bucket to buy water at the tiger stove. Tian waited for the widow for a long time but did not see her. When he saw Chen coming, he could not see clearly under the electric light and mistakenly thought that she was the person. He first covered her head with a piece of cloth, called his companions, and they rushed her home. The firecrackers at the door were also set off loudly.</p>
<p>▲ Niece Surrounded: Tian saw that Chen's clothes were old and ordered her to enter the room to bathe and change clothes. Chen was as if she had fallen into a fog and did not understand why. She insisted on refusing to no avail. Because she did not agree to bathe and change clothes, her clothes were torn by Tian. Chen shouted for help, and Tian immediately struck her mouth, causing her to bleed. At that time, Chen's uncle, Han Baxi, happened to pass by the door and saw the incense and candles shining brightly in Tian's house, and the room was noisy. He was curious and went inside to watch. He saw that his niece was surrounded and forced to marry, so he took down Tian's door number and rushed to report to Teng.</p>
<p>▲ Lured into Police Station for Detention: Teng was furious and could not be stopped. He immediately rushed to the First Sub-station of the Third District to file a complaint. The station chief sent police to Tian's house to investigate, but Tian and his gang had already fled. Chen was taken to the station and questioned briefly, and the couple was temporarily released to wait for Tian to be arrested for further verification. After Tian saw someone take away the door number, he realized that he had kidnapped the wrong bride and wanted to regret it, but it was too late. Therefore, he asked a friend to speak to Teng, willing to pay for clothing, medical expenses, and other losses. Teng pretended to agree and instructed Tian to go to the police station to make a statement first. Tian believed it to be true and entered the station, where he was detained. Under the confrontation between the plaintiff and the defendant, the station chief said that the custom of kidnapping a bride hinders the freedom of women and is not allowed by law. Moreover, the person kidnapped was not the person they wanted to kidnap, which is beyond the scope of this crime. He had damaged the reputation of others for no reason, so he ordered the defendant to be detained. Yesterday afternoon, the plaintiff and the defendant were all sent to the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>▲ Colluding with Guard Soldiers</p>
<p>▲ Escape Together at Night</p>
<p>The 25th Route Army Military Inspection Office outside Wusongkou captured a bandit leader named Sun Guangmin at Beijing Port at about 8:00 PM the night before last. He was immediately detained in the guardhouse of the office to await questioning. Unexpectedly, the bandit colluded with Xu Xin, a guard soldier, and escaped together. Chief Li was furious after learning about this and ordered his subordinates to strictly investigate the bandit leader and the guard soldier this morning and arrest them together for legal action. It is said that the bandit has committed numerous crimes and his crimes are serious.</p>

<p>▲ Qian A'er Murdered</p>
<p>▲ Culprit Arrested Without a Trace</p>
<p>In the graveyard behind Yao's House in Qichang, Pudong, at noon yesterday, a surprising cry for help suddenly came out for more than ten times, the words were very clear. Shen, the patrol chief of the Third District Police Station, happened to be patrolling by and heard the sound, so he hurriedly stepped in to watch. He saw a man of about 40 years old, with more than ten knife wounds on his head and left hand, lying in a pool of blood, but he could still speak. He claimed that his name was Qian A'er, 44 years old, from Nanhui, and lived near the 30,000 factory in Yao's House. The culprit was Yao Zhousheng, who lived in Yao's House. Because Yao had a wife and a concubine, and the concubine ran away a few days ago, Yao suspected that I had seduced her. Today, he brought me here and murdered my life. Shen, the patrol chief, immediately ordered the police to send Qian to the Third District and rushed to Yao's house to arrest him. Yao had already fled without a trace, but a photo of Yao himself was seized and sent to the district for inspection. The district chief saw that Qian was seriously injured and immediately sent him to Pudong Hospital for treatment. The photo was kept in the district to wait for the arrest and investigation of the murderer. The hospital said that the injured person's life was in danger and the hospital did not have first-aid equipment, so he was transferred to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Feng Bingnan's Opinion on Rickshaw Advertising <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Feng Bingnan wrote a letter saying, "Dear Sir, I recently saw a news item about rickshaw advertising in the local section of your newspaper on the 24th of this month, which involves me and does not fully conform to the facts. According to me, although tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers in this port are engaged in humble occupations, they are members of social production, which is no different from those engaged in noble occupations. Moreover, regardless of wind, snow, sunshine, or rain, they run day and night on the road and support themselves. Their perseverance in enduring hardship is beyond our reach. Once they have a disease or are too old to pull a rickshaw, life is even more difficult and miserable. Society should provide subsidies for these people. Therefore, when I donated money to the Rickshaw Gospel Society two years ago, I extracted what I saw and published it in the North China Daily, advocating that advertisements be published on rickshaws themselves, such as wheel covers and the back of the car, and that 10% of the profits be used for relief. The editor of the newspaper specially commented on my proposal and published it in the newspaper to promote social attention. This is the factual process of my proposal to publish advertisements on rickshaws to relieve poor rickshaw pullers. However, the Rickshaw Gospel Society was not initiated by me, and the Baigao Advertising Agency has nothing to do with me, so I must declare the facts to avoid misunderstandings. I hereby inform you and hope that you will check and correct it."</p>

<p>▲ 15 in South Shanghai... 5 in Zhabei</p>
<p>Last year, the Municipal Public Works Bureau prepared to set up a standard clock in the city, first soliciting prices from various foreign firms, and sending letters to municipal authorities in London, Paris, Berlin, and Tokyo to investigate the style of electric clocks they used and their results. Later, they replied one after another, mostly adopting the same type of heteropolar electric clock produced by the German company Siemens, and the results were good. The standard clock recently installed in the capital is also a Siemens heteropolar electric clock. Therefore, the bureau decided to adopt this electric clock and reported it to the Municipal Government for approval. It is now known that the bureau has signed a contract with Siemens to purchase two master clocks and twenty secondary clocks, which are scheduled to be delivered in mid-June. As for the installation plan, it is said that they plan to install one master clock and fifteen secondary clocks in the South Shanghai District, and one master clock and five secondary clocks in the Zhabei District. The installation location and installation method have been planned, and they can be installed as soon as the goods arrive.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Mud Dredging Begins at South Shanghai Wharf <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The South Shanghai Wharf in this city is very prone to siltation due to water conditions. During the management of the former Port Affairs Bureau, due to time and budget constraints, the mud dredging of the wharf could not be carried out. After the Municipal Public Works Bureau took over, shipping companies repeatedly requested to deepen the coastline to facilitate the berthing of ships. The bureau also recognized that the siltation of each wharf will lead to abandonment. After discussing with the Public Works Bureau to estimate the project, they prepared to ask the Dredging Bureau to carry out large-scale excavation to achieve a permanent solution. However, Wharf No. 8, rented by Ping'an Company, is particularly shallow, and ships can hardly dock. In order to cope with the emergency, the bureau negotiated with the Public Works Bureau to use its own mud-dredging machine and rent another mud-dredging ship for excavation. It is said that work began the day before yesterday (22nd) and will be completed in about two weeks. The mud dredging of other wharves needs to be negotiated with the Dredging Bureau by the Public Works Bureau.</p>

<p>There is a commercial ferry at Wusong Yunzaobang, and most of the passengers are workers of Yong'an Yarn Factory who go out early and return late. The round-trip fare has always been 20. Recently, Shen Mao, the owner of the ferry, applied to the Municipal Public Works Bureau to increase the fare because the income was not enough to cover expenses. The workers' round-trip fare would be increased by 5 yuan, making it 30 yuan. Non-worker single passengers would be charged 2 copper coins per trip, as was the case with the ferries of Wusong River. It is said that it has been transferred to the Municipal Government for approval by the Public Works Bureau.</p>

The court approved it and then brought Li Engong and the other six to the case for questioning one by one. The statements were similar to the previous trial. Some said they were detained for visiting friends, and some said they knew the bandits, but they had nothing to do with the kidnapping case.

His wife, Xi, 26, also from Danyang, has been married for only two years and their relationship is very close. She worked as a female worker at the nearby National Rubber Factory and earned about ten yuan a month, so their life was slightly better than before. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (23rd), the factory was closed, and she went to Dama Road to play and stopped by her husband Bangjie's place for a snack. After leaving the shop, she saw a man selling a bright red gold ring on the side of the road for two yuan. She bought it and returned home, feeling happy. That night, when Bangjie returned home, she told her husband about buying the ring. After Tang examined it carefully, he found that it was a fake and scolded her. She was a village girl, and suddenly losing two yuan made her extremely regretful. The next morning, when her husband went out, she secretly committed suicide by taking raw opium. The neighbors noticed and hurriedly called Bangjie home and hired a car to send her to Tongren Hospital, and then transferred her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Because of excessive poisoning, her life was in danger.</p>

<p>Ma Zhangquan, a Cantonese employee of the Nanyang Tobacco Company, was walking from the company to his residence at No. 43 Qingyun Lane, North Sichuan Road, at 5:00 AM yesterday morning. Passing through Chongming Road, he encountered Ma Changfa, a detective from the Hongkou Police Station, along with his Cantonese accomplice Chen Adi, who were searching pedestrians and vehicles. Ma was inevitably searched. They found only ten pawn tickets and sixty-one yuan in cash. Since there were no prohibited items, they were allowed to proceed. Unexpectedly, Chen chased after Ma again and, at the entrance to Ma's residence, demanded a reward, claiming that he had acted as an interpreter during the search and had subtly spoken on Ma's behalf, thus avoiding detention and further investigation. He argued that he should be rewarded accordingly. Ma gave him ten yuan, but Chen found it insufficient and demanded another ten yuan before finally leaving with satisfaction. Ma returned home and told his wife, who was unwilling to lose money for nothing. She reported the matter to the Hongkou Police Station, leading to Chen's arrest. The money he had extorted had been used to buy an iron pot and other items for seven yuan, with eight yuan remaining. Yesterday, he was brought before Judge Feng of the Special District Local Court for interrogation. Chen was found guilty and sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The utensils and the eight yuan obtained through extortion were returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Wang Peisheng, a 30-year-old Suzhou native and leader of the type-setting department at a French newspaper office residing at No. 111 Huanghe Road in the French Concession, married Ms. Zhu, a woman from Zhoupu, on the 8th of this month through matchmakers Ms. Jia Li, Ms. Ni Xu, and Ms. Xu Ni. Ms. Zhu, aged twenty, was described as having bright eyes, white teeth, and fashionable attire. Wang spent a considerable sum, offering full gold and six gifts to secure the marriage. Unexpectedly, only six days after the wedding, on the 14th, Ms. Zhu packed her clothes and disappeared without a trace. Wang immediately went to the original matchmakers and Ms. Zhu's father to demand her return, but Ms. Zhu's father claimed to be unaware of her whereabouts. Later, at around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, Ms. Zhu's father found his daughter at the New Eastern Hotel. All her clothes were gone. He escorted his daughter back to Wang's home, but Wang, distressed by the missing clothes and fearing she would run away again, refused to take her in. He then went to the matchmaker's house in the Nine-Mu-Di area, where he followed Wang and summoned police officer Hou Zhaolin from Precinct 1, Sub-station 19 of the Second District. He had Ms. Zhu and the matchmakers arrested and taken to the police station. Chief Xu interrogated them. Wang stated the above and alleged that they were colluding to orchestrate an escape. According to Ms. Zhu's statement, when the engagement was arranged, the matchmakers said that Wang was a Naimowen (i.e., comprador) and only in his twenties. Now she knew Wang was a type-setter, much older, unattractive, and she did not want to be his wife, and so on.

<p>▲ One Month Imprisonment, Three Years Probation</p>
<p>Yesterday, Pan Xirong hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the French Concession Court, stating that the defendant, Jin Liansheng, had previously been an apprentice in the plaintiff's shop. However, due to his misconduct, he was repeatedly reprimanded, which led to him harboring resentment. He initially left the shop on his own and never returned. Then, one night recently, he suddenly returned to the shop and sneaked upstairs to steal. The plaintiff discovered him and went upstairs to investigate. Unexpectedly, the defendant dared to stab the plaintiff several times with scissors, causing serious injuries. Fortunately, patrolling police arrived and arrested Jin. The plaintiff requested a severe punishment. Jin Liansheng confessed that he had been dismissed by the plaintiff. On the day in question, he went to retrieve his clothes and was attacked by the plaintiff. Therefore, he fought back. His other statements were evasive. Judge Zhu sentenced Jin to one month of imprisonment, but considering his youth, he granted a lenient three-year probation.</p>

The chief prosecutor, Mr. Liu Maochu, appointed police officer Chen Xihui to act as police chief. Unexpectedly, Police Chief Yang passed away from illness at 12:00 PM the night before last. All thirty of the court's police officers have jointly submitted a request to the chief prosecutor to promote Police Officer Chen to police chief, recognizing his experience and dedication to public service.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the Medical and Pharmaceutical Association <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Medical and Pharmaceutical Association of the Republic of China convened a meeting of the Executive Committee at its headquarters the other day. In addition to deciding to invite professors from universities in Guangdong, Beiping, and other provinces to attend and lecture at the general meeting in early April, the committee also discussed the current medical administration. As a result, it was resolved that: (1) Medical administration should also be carried out in two stages: political training and constitutional governance. At present, for already practicing doctors, the authorities should formulate transitional measures, such as provisional regulations. Just as civil servants, lawyers, and accountants have provisional regulations, doctors should also receive the same treatment; (2) The reorganization of medicine and pharmaceuticals should be based on science. Without the promotion of science, there can be no real effect. The association should strongly express its concerns to the authorities. Mr. Yu Yunxiu was asked to draft the proposal.</p>

<p>My friend Wang Ziyan Chun lived in Beiping for many years. Yesterday he returned to Shanghai and visited me. During our conversation, he mentioned two anecdotes about the old capital's palace, which, though old news, may be unknown to others. I recorded them to share with readers.</p>
<p>▲ The Copper Man of the Imperial Hospital Knows the Time The Imperial Hospital was the Qing Dynasty's national medical institution. Now, only historical records remain. However, two copper men in the hospital still stand majestically. The copper men are purplish-brown in color and about four feet tall. They are naked and remarkably lifelike, representing males. One faces south, and the other stands back-to-back. The front, back, top, and bottom of the bodies are marked with acupuncture points according to the body's blood flow. The two points on the chest are the largest, as thick as writing brushes. There is a hole on the top of the head. When filled with water, water shoots out from the chest points at the change of Zi and Wu (11:00 PM and 11:00 AM). Water also squirts out in turn according to the hours of Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, etc., daily and accurately. Experts say that these copper men were used to test acupuncture for various diseases. They were created by a famous doctor during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. It is said that they have been effective for more than 200 years. It is a pity that few modern people know the inner structure and mechanism. It can be seen that ancient people's creations were marvelous and comparable to science. If someone could study them in detail and imitate them according to the method, it might be a contribution to medicine.</p>
<p>▲ Old Fish of Beihai Has Gone Abroad A corner of Beihai (North Sea Park) contains countless fish, and swimming is forbidden. In the past, Emperor Qianlong was a carefree man who often enjoyed fishing there during pleasant weather. He had thin gold plates, about an inch in size, prepared. When he caught a fish, he would engrave the character "One" on a gold plate and attach it before releasing the fish. If the fish was caught a second or third time, a second or third gold plate would be attached. The clanging plates were put back into the middle of the stream. Some fish were caught as many as seven times, and the plates were attached as before. The pond was his pleasure. The Beihai pond has thousands of fish, mostly carp. When the waves are calm and the sun is shining, the red, yellow, black, and white fish leap back and forth, and the surface of the water is brilliant and golden. After the collapse of Qianlong, no one cared about it. When the Republic of China was founded, Feng Guozhang was President and hosted foreign envoys at</p>

<p>Painters all use brushes. However, some use fingers, which is called finger painting. One out of thousands is able to do it, because his attainment is profound. Recently, a friend told me that a certain person in Beiping is good at tongue painting. He spreads paper on a table, dips his tongue in thick ink, and then applies his tongue to the paper. He paints freely, quickly finishing. When viewed, the paintings of people, landscapes, and flowers are lifelike. According to a certain person, this kind of tongue painting was obtained from a secret transmission. It requires a strong person to learn. When painting, you must put all your strength on the tip of your tongue, which is very prone to dizziness. Before painting, he must drink a cup of wine to invigorate blood. He joined the military when he was young, but now he paints to entertain himself. However, he is getting old and wants to teach someone to prevent this art from being lost.</p>
<p>Beihai. A French envoy was curious and knew the fish's history. He informed the government, which ordered them to find a fish and send it to the Paris Museum. They asked Feng for a large fish with seven gold plates attached to its fins, knowing that it had been caught seven times and was 100 years old. He regarded it as a rare commodity and took many procedures to transport it to Dagukou in a large container filled with water and release it into the ocean. As a result, it was worth 100,000 Chinese coins. Feng happily accepted it. The people of Beiping gave Feng the title of President who Sells Fish.</p>
<h3 id="e151">County Magistrate Kills Thief Record Yun Sun <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Yi, the county magistrate of Taixian County, has been in office for six months. His reputation has spread far and wide. He was transferred from Rugao to govern Wuling. He is thirty years old and very capable. He handles everything himself. He often goes in and out of the city streets in plain clothes. On the eve of the Lunar New Year, at three or four in the morning, a thief came to his bedroom and stole two gold watches. Still not satisfied, he then stole the fox fur robe from the outside of the Fushi quilt. Zhang woke up, slightly opening his sleepy eyes. He saw a person standing by the bed in the room. He knew that the person was not a good person and intended to harm him. For self-defense, he grabbed the Browning pistol next to his pillow and killed him with one shot. At dawn, he realized that it was a thief. He immediately ordered the village chiefs to verify the identity of the unknown thief's body. The next day, the case was investigated. The news spread, and everyone said that today's county magistrates are all capable in both literary and military arts. The thief's death was his own fault.</p>
<p>At the same time, it was announced that the head of the Public Security Bureau's family, the prison official's family, and the head of a section of the Public Security Bureau's family had been stolen from. The thief only cares about the administrative officials in a county. Although the thief is dead, he should be a powerful ghost.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Three Hundredth Anniversary of Quinine Lv Bing <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>There is a kind of tree bark in Peru, South America, which is ground into powder and used to treat malaria. It is magically effective. This is the quinine known to ordinary people. The first inventor of the frost was the Countess of Quinine. Therefore, her name is forever associated with the drug. That year, the naturalist Linnaeus named it quinine. According to the time, it is three hundred years from 1931.</p>
<p>Not long after the discovery of the New World, Peru became a Spanish territory. Therefore, among the European countries, the Spanish were the first to use quinine. Later, it spread to England. The society was not familiar with its name, so it was commonly called malaria powder. Later, some shipowners who had sailed to Peru said that the locals called this powder quinine. At that time, the name quinine became very popular. However, the spelling of quinine is the same as the English name for China. Therefore, many people mistakenly thought that the medicine came from the Far East and gave it the alias of Chinese powder. The loss of authenticity from quinine to China is not a joke. Quinine is very effective in the medicine box and benefits the people. The contribution is indeed not small. Therefore, on the 300th anniversary of its invention, I have written it out for the readers.</p>

<p>October 1st. Teacher Chen Keyuan invited me to speak on the new Gospel of the world. The next day at 2:00 PM, I took a very small wheel to Gongwenya Port. Mr. Chen Lianqing came to greet me. It was already dusk. I went to his power plant to see its repair equipment. After a while, Liu Zhengchang and Liu Feiran from Pengcheng Company greeted me and stayed at their Hetai store. Feiran had studied at the Military and Political School and was able to handle Chinese affairs. The store was located next to a small river. It was very nice to shower in the river every day. I gradually learned to wear pants and take a bath. But people told me that noon was not suitable. Mostly in the morning and 4:00 PM or late at night.</p>
<p>On the 3rd, I wrote couplets for Pengcheng Company and Duyu School. The couplets read: "Deeply cherish the predecessors and educate the successors" and "Nurture good scholars, beautiful as phoenixes and unicorns, and educate them with a gentle breeze and tender plants."</p>
<p>On the 4th, Chen Lianqing came to talk for another five hours. Chen advocated that the main goal was to widely translate various texts, reprint books and popularize them in various countries. I admired his vision. His ideals and morals are comparable to Zhang Mo Chi, and his scientific and economic ability exceeds his. He argued that industrial distribution could be resolved by citing the Ford Company in the United States as an example, saying that the distribution method between workers and shareholders was very good. The Russians also imitated it. But I asked him, "There are many causes of war. Even if the distribution is fair, conflict is inevitable when males meet. Anarchists do not understand political science. People are political animals, half rational and half irrational. Philosophically, the moral rationality of anarchists is too high. Modern humans cannot understand it. Therefore, the Russian Tolstoyists were eventually swallowed by the Marxist tiger. But its soul is still alive in the tiger's belly. Several Chinese anarchists have joined the Kuomintang. This must be known."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also recounted a small history of the failure of a new village, which must be recorded. A businessman from Fujian, Chen Yunweng, was sixty years old. He was not well-literate and had made a fortune of more than 100,000 yuan. Suddenly, he lived alone and had a whim. He thought of creating a new village. He hired a secretary to write it into a book, and then had him read it aloud so he could hear it. He printed 1,000 copies, each with more than twenty pages, called Public Life. According to Chen Weng, the method can lead to peace. Even bandits can use it. Therefore, he often thought of returning to his hometown to gather bandits and teach them. He would organize a new community. Lianqing saw his original book on public life and also obtained his revised version, which added up to more than fifty pages.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Old Farmer's Experience Talk Qing Qu <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, an old farmer from a village in the west came to my house. He was over seventy years old, but he was spirited and lean. He was also able to drink heartily. When he spoke, he was like the old days when he hoed the fields. There was no sign of aging. I asked him if this early spring snow, which had not been seen in recent years, would damage the small harvest this year. The old farmer sobbed and said, "This is really heaven. Although there was a snowstorm before the beginning of spring, or it accumulated to several inches, and the ice did not melt, the harm of rice borers and locusts was avoided. The rice can be harvested. This snow is a sign of a good year." "Spring snow is harmful and useless." It is said, "Winter snow is like a quilt, spring snow is like a ghost." It means that wheat values spring snow. It is in the process of development and is destroyed by severe cold. It cannot be compared with the end of winter. I asked him how the broad beans, which are also a major source of small harvests, were affected by the weather. The old farmer said, "Although beans can withstand cold, the damage is even worse than wheat. Asking the reason, he said that wheat, regardless of size, has been diligently cultivated by farmers who have picked up river mud and covered the fields. Therefore, it can reduce the intrusion of cold air into the wheat roots, so it will not die. Once exposed to sunlight, it will flourish as before. It can still be harmless. Otherwise, there will be no wheat rice to eat in April and May. Even if you want to grow a big harvest, you can't. It's not just the villagers who are hungry." He said sadly. He also said that broad beans can still be replanted. If you use a hoe to sow the seeds on the morning of the 13th of the lunar January, they can still germinate and bear fruit in early summer. Otherwise, if you sow the seeds in the afternoon, you will not be able to avoid the wasteland if you want it to grow. Villagers do not know the national calendar, so this is what happened. I asked the old farmer, "If this is the case, even though the weather is bad, human efforts can make up for it. Is it true?" The old farmer said slowly, "I have been working in the fields since I was a child. Now I am old. I don't know how many times I have experienced this heavy snow. Are you suspicious?" However, I am not a farmer, and I still cannot get rid of the feelings in my heart. Therefore, I wrote it down with a pen to wait for those with agricultural knowledge to study it.</p>

<p>Chapter 17: Skillful in Maintaining Youth, Eyebrows Mixed with Green Dai; Unable to Prolong Life, Golden Market with Pricey Horses</p>
<p>A Jin said, No matter what, I won't pawn it for thirty yuan. The head counter clerk said, We say thirty yuan because of the small diamonds around the circle. If there were no diamonds around the circle, we wouldn't even give it that price. You say platinum, we have never heard of platinum. In our pawnshop, no one appraises platinum. No matter how you say it, we only see it as copper. We have to take responsibility. If we pawn fake goods, we have to pay for it. As for gold and silver, we have our own eyes. We don't know what new platinum or black gold is. Pawn it if you want to, or take it back. A Jin felt that the thirty yuan was too far off. If he pawned it back at their price, Miss Sixth would definitely be dissatisfied. He naturally didn't dare to make the decision, so he said, Then let me ask the owner of this watch. He went back and told Hua Yuanchun, Miss Sixth, luckily we still have two noses to breathe. Otherwise, we would be pissed off by them. Those country bumpkins have probably never seen platinum before. It was handed from the third counter clerk to the second counter clerk, and then from the second counter clerk to the head counter clerk. In the end, they offered thirty yuan. I advise you, Miss Sixth, to exchange it for something else. Hua Yuanchun said, To be honest, A Jin, other valuable items have either been pawned or redeemed. There are still a few pieces, but I want to wear them myself. If I go there, I won't be able to show off my wealth. People will gossip behind my back. Just then, two customers came to have tea. Everyone stopped talking about it. One of the two tea customers was Ye Tonghou, also an old customer of Hua Yuanchun. The other was an unrelated friend brought by Ye Tonghou. As soon as Ye Tonghou came in, he smiled and said, We are here for a "comb tea". Hua Yuanchun said, What new name are you coming up with? What is "comb tea"? Ye Tonghou said, When it's not yet dark in the afternoon, you go to the hall to have tea. Many officials and young ladies are in the era of combing their hair. People say "watching combing hair under the crystal curtain" has a special charm. At night, under the wine and lights, they are all in their heavy makeup era. It's at this time that their messy hair and simple clothes can show their true colors. Hua Yuanchun glanced at him charmingly and said, Young Master San, you are so powerful. You want to see people's true colors. Then come earlier and come when people haven't gotten up yet. Wouldn't that show their true colors even more? Ye Tonghou shook his head and said, That's called "bed tea". But I never have bed tea in my life. What's the point of that? Too much is as bad as too little. The time in bed is suitable for the first half of the period, not the second half of the period. Just like life in general. The first half of life is always more interesting than the second half.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Finance The Situation of the Gold Market Seems Reversal <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>▲ Banks Absorbing Spot Goods</p>
<p>▲ General Attention Increases</p>
<p>▲ Waves Continue to Be Extremely Fierce Yesterday, February 24th, the gold market tended to reverse, showing signs of rising again, but there were still extreme twists and turns, and it was extremely confusing. The changes ranged from four or five taels to more than ten taels in a short period, which was difficult to predict. Throughout the day, there were actually reversals of twenty-four or five taels, eventually rising by about ten taels. This was mainly because the foreign exchange rate continued to rise by one and a half notches. However, the internal situation was stable in the later stage, appearing wide but actually even. The market transactions varied greatly. In the early market, major players such as Fuchang, Yuanheng, Zhifeng, and Yongshunli bought in large quantities, while Qianchang, Xiangyuan, Mao, Yongtaixing, etc., all sold. The psychology of the industry was hesitant and uncertain. Overseas silver markets reported increases, but they were not affected because of widespread rumors about cash exports, which raised general awareness. The gold price rose as soon as it opened, already breaking through 750 taels. Afterwards, the foreign exchange trend became loose, especially with large households selling off, and rumors circulated internationally about stimulating the silver shortage, so the market turned sharply to a low point. In an instant, a storm occurred, and the price plummeted by a huge amount of twenty taels, suddenly breaking through forty taels. At noon, it rebounded. Those hedging exchange bills and Yuanheng, Fuyu, etc., took advantage of this to buy in, causing it to rise by ten taels. Later in the market, it was heard that a certain bank was buying cash, and exchange bills improved. Buyers on the surface were active. Xietai, Chenfeng, Yongqianchang, Xiang, etc., all brought in goods, so the price soared by more than ten taels, but the state was still uncertain, with fluctuations of four or five taels from time to time. The final count was fifty-seven or eight taels. In summary, the news was complicated, and the control was in the hands of both bulls and bears. For spot goods, an additional five taels must be added. There may be no change in large bars this morning.</p>
<p>▲ A Sudden Collapse in the Middle From the early morning, the April opening price increased by six taels and five qian, to 755 taels. Large bars increased by another sixteen-fifths. The silver price had no fluctuations because of the stimulation of cash activity. Afterwards, there were mutual ups and downs of five taels. Yuanmao Yong and other companies sold, so it dropped to fifty taels. Then, with Fuyu and others buying in, it rose again to fifty-five and a half taels. Zhifeng, Yongchang, Shengyong, and speculators sold out, and it suddenly fell by more than nine taels. The preliminary announcement already showed that English money was up three seven five, U.S. dollars up eight seven five, and Japanese money down four and a half points, so it retreated to fifty taels and five qian, becoming forty-eight taels. However, bank transactions were not forgotten. Taiwan bought May English money at 1275, and Mitsui bought Dalian at one tael, six qian, and six fen. Shortly thereafter, it rose to fifty-one and a half taels. After 9:45, a storm suddenly arose. Various firms, such as Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Zhifeng, Shuihongli, Fuyu, and Taixing, enthusiastically sold, especially as English money suddenly turned weak. Banks followed suit and loosened, from 1275 to 13, and the market plummeted by more than twenty taels, to thirty-four and a half taels at 10:45. The market then turned slightly peaceful. After 11:00, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Hengxing, Fuyu, etc., bought in again, while English money (Zhejiang and Jiali etc) absorbed at 129375. After 11:30, it was counted as forty-four and a half taels. Suddenly, hedge funds sold out, retreating to forty taels and five qian, and then retail investors bought in, calculating to forty-four taels. At noon, the market closed at forty-two taels and five qian, and then increased again to forty-four taels. The announced price was changed to 811 taels and eight qian, a decrease of more than sixty taels, and then seventy-seven or eight taels, around seventy taels at noon.</p>
<p>▲ Evening Market Rises Gently The market opened in the afternoon at forty-three and a half taels, then forty-five taels. Indian exchange rates initially fell to three or four annas, then returned to forty-three taels. Soon after, Xieda, Qianchangxiang, etc., chased after purchases, and rumors spread that banks were absorbing spot goods, and English money was also better. Banks mutually traded between 128125 and 75, so at 2:45 it was fifty-four taels. Suddenly, news came that the Indian exchange rate had increased greatly, and the market sentiment suffered a setback, falling to about forty-nine and a half taels around 3:00. Afterwards, the buyers stirred things up, and Chenfengyong, Zhifengyong, and hedgers bought in one after another, and Mitsui and the wheat firms dealt with April English money at 12625, so the gold price gradually rose until it reached fifty-nine taels at 4:00. However, there were four or five taels of intraday trading in between, and it was difficult to handle. Tongtaichang acquired</p>
<p>quite a lot of purchases, and retreated to fifty-five and a half taels at 4:10. At 4:30, the market closed at fifty-seven and a half taels, an increase of nine taels compared to the day before, a reversal of the more than thirty-five taels that had fallen for two consecutive days. The maximum price in one day was fifty-nine taels, and the minimum price was thirty-four and a half taels, a difference of twenty-four and a half taels. The morning market price for goods was fifty-five taels, forty-three taels in the afternoon, forty-four and a half taels in the afternoon, and the closing price was fifty-six and a half taels. The announced price was calculated to be sixty-seven or eight taels, and later fifty-three or four taels.</p>
<p>▲ Complicated and Confusing Transactions The transactions among the firms included Zhifengyong, Hengxingyuan, Fuchangyuanheng, Shunli, and Yuantai, all of which bought in. Hengxing, Wanxing, Tong,</p>
<p>Taichang, Futaiyang, Hengyu, Fuyu, and Dadecheng, Xieda, etc., went in and out intermittently. Qianchangxiang, Hongli, Taixing, and Yuanmaoyong all sold out. In the afternoon, Qianchangxiang, Fuchang, Yu Da, Chenfengyong, and Fuyu all bought in. Hengxing, Yuanmaoyong, Yuantai, Hengyu, and Yuanmao all sold out. Dadecheng, Futaixing, Yichang</p>
<p>and Xieda all traded in and out quite a bit. The commodity sales were complicated and frequent. The Dayun Gang sold a total of over 1,000 items in the early market and bought in 1,400 to 1,500 items. The Zhang Gang bought in 500 to 600 items and sold out 800 items. It is said that the [insert name] Gang sold out hundreds of items.</p>
<p>▲ Increase in Handling Fee The Gold Exchange is now planning to increase the handling fee. A notice was issued yesterday stating that starting March 1st, the Exchange will collect a handling fee from both buyers and sellers at the rate of one qian per tael. The broker will receive 75% and the Exchange will receive 25%. The Exchange will then allocate 20% of the 25% commission collected to each broker as an incentive. In addition to notifying each broker by letter, this announcement is being made.</p>

<p>▲ Chinese Merchants Selling Sterling and Buying Tiaozi</p>
<p>Yesterday, the English and Indian silver markets both reported increases, while the American silver market was closed. The Shanghai foreign exchange market showed diverging trends. HSBC's listed prices continued to rise by one and a half notches: English money at 375, at one shilling and two and a half pence; U.S. dollars at 875, at twenty-nine yuan three seven five; Indian exchange at two yuan two five, at eighty-one and a half rupees; French francs at nineteen yuan, at seven hundred and forty-nine yuan; German exchange at three yuan two five, at one hundred and twenty-three and a half marks; Japanese-Western exchange at one yuan seven five, at seventy-three shields; Singapore fell five taels, at one hundred and ninety-one and a half taels; Hong Kong did not change, at seventy-eight taels seven five; Japanese money decreased by four and a half points, at one tael six qian eight fen five. The domestic market was initially even, then weak, then even again at noon, and then stabilized in the afternoon. The price fluctuations were quite fierce, rising and falling by ten taels from morning to night, with changes of more than twenty-four taels. The market was chaotic. As a result, compared to the day before, English money was still reduced by zero six two five, U.S. dollars by one two five, and Japanese money increased by seven five. Most of the Chinese gold merchants sold out, then bought back Tiaozi. About 300,000 pounds of English money were traded. The banks were eager, and Sumitomo, Mitsui, Taiwan, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Zhengjin, Korea, Maccari, etc., all absorbed. However, Shanghai sold out a little in the afternoon. The various banks mutually traded more than 100,000 pounds in the early and late markets. The amount of English money traded was small. As for Japanese money, only the Dalian tickets were sold by the Dalian Gang to Mitsui and Korea, totaling more than one million yuan.</p>
<p>▲ English Exchange The domestic market had fluctuations of three seven five. The morning asking price was one shilling, two pence, six two five, and the buying price was six eight seven five. The noon closing asking price was eight seven five, and the buying price was nine three seven five.

The 20-year cigarette, the 19-year customs, the demobilization, etc., all had quite active transactions, and other bonds were also better than before. Regarding the changes in the market prices of various public bonds, there was some fluctuation between the two sessions, but there was no significant increase or decrease, and the trend was peaceful. Although there was a lot of selling on the market, buying sentiment was not deserted. As a result, compared to the day before, only the 96 and 19-year benevolent futures contracts decreased slightly, and other contracts generally continued to rise. Spot goods, such as demobilization, 19-year benevolent, 19-year customs, and 19-year customs bonds, increased quite a bit. The rising trend of bond prices has not yet abated.

<h3 id="e161">Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton Afternoon Market for Yarn is Firm <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, but sales on the market are becoming increasingly sluggish, and the various gangs have no excitement because high prices hinder sales. The underlying goods are still thick, and some are bearish. Raw cotton prices are firm, making it difficult to loosen up. Fundamentally, it is very strong, so some manufacturers have a tough attitude and buy when prices fall. Therefore, the two sides are deadlocked, and it is difficult to see a drop in the short term. But in reality, sales are sluggish, and if it is not smooth for a long time, there may be changes in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Renbiao [Cotton Futures] Lifted by Raw Cotton The Renbiao market opened in the early market and the market sentiment was still firm due to manufacturers buying in. In the second and third sessions, the gold price fell again. As a result, various months rose or fell by 4, 6, to 1 tael and 4 qian. In the afternoon, due to the rise in raw cotton, the market sentiment was firm, and retail investors were short covering. Various months rose by 4, 8 qian to 1 tael and 2 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 26,150 bales. It was found that Xida sold 1,950 bales, Changfeng sold 750 bales, and Shenji sold 950 bales. Meiji bought 2,450 bales, Xincheng bought 2,200 bales, and Guangfeng bought 750 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left. Renbiao closing prices, gains and losses, and balances: May 1748 up 2, 32,850; February 1715 up 10, 16,850; June 1746, 6, 30,050; March 1728, 9, 53,650; July 1748, 17, 10,000; April 1738, 7, 59,800.</p>
<p>▲ Spot Demand is Very Sluggish Spot yarn sales are very sluggish. It was found that the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day was only 340. The industry bought in 825 bales. Market conditions are trending downward. Among the customer gangs, 225 bales went to the interior, 40 bales to Sichuan, 35 bales to southern Hebei, and 40 bales to miscellaneous gangs.</p>

<p>▲ Boosted by the Gold Market... The Afternoon Rebound is Very Strong</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose again, and the increases and decreases were very large. In the morning, due to the increase in foreign exchange and the fall in gold prices, people's minds were slightly calm and tired. In the afternoon, the factories were more diligent in purchasing spot cotton, business picked up, and Japanese merchants bought in large quantities, and the market suddenly turned upward. The situation is becoming increasingly tight, and the state of the cotton market is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲ Hanbiao [Chinese Cotton Futures] Up Six or Seven Qian The Hanbiao market opened higher in the early market, and in the second and third sessions, it returned to weakness due to the fall in gold prices. As a result, various months fell by 2, 4, and 6 qian. In the afternoon, due to the purchase by Japanese merchants and the rise in gold prices, and most people expected U.S. cotton to rise, various months rose by 2 qian, 8 and a half qian to 1 tael and 12 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 85,600 dan. It was found that Mingde sold 4,900 dan, Yuda sold 2,700 dan, Changfeng sold 2,600 dan, and Gongtai sold 2,900 dan. Tianlong bought 5,200 dan, Gengfeng bought 3,400 dan, and Gongtai bought 5,200 dan. The Hanbiao closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Grains Rice Market Continues to Fall by Two Jiao <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei Yesterday, more than twenty river boats arrived. Sales remained sluggish. The buying sentiment for Northern Baijing rice was still weak, and the special top-grade Jing rice was extremely desolate. The price was around thirteen yuan. The top-grade market was uniformly weak, continuing to fall by about two jiao. Thin rice sales were slow, and the owners were eager to sell quickly, discounting by a small amount, while the supply of Yangxian rice was scarce, and the market was stable, but the middle grade was weak by nearly a jiao. The supply of Dujian rice had been reduced, but retail sales on the street were still acceptable, and the market was slightly soft. Bian Yuan continued to trend downward and lacked special top-grade goods. The price returned by a small amount of two jiao. The top-grade market opened at twelve yuan two jiao.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South Yesterday, more than ten boats from various gangs arrived. The street sales were mediocre. The prices for Changxi top-grade Jing rice were few, and Su Tong and other Jing rice were slightly more than a jiao lower, and the situation was sluggish and depressed. Sales of early southern thin rice were sluggish. Top-grade goods were stable, and middle-grade goods were slightly more than one jiao lower. The situation for Yang Dujian rice was even and weak. The morning transactions were not good, and the afternoon transactions were slightly better. The market price was lowered by nearly a foot. Bianyin Yuan sales were weak, but the customer gang inquired a little, the high-priced goods gradually stabilized, and the rest remained stable and soft.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Customer Xian Rice Production Prices Rise Frequently <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>▲ Merchants Have Said They Will Purchase Saigon Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer Xian rice was quite bleak, because after the market opened a few days ago, the market price was unusually high, and customer transportation also felt that the transportation and sale were not cost-effective. The owners believe that there is very little customer Xian rice in Shanghai, and the two major rice producing areas in Jiangxi and Hunan are both disturbed by the Communist bandits, and the existing rice has been robbed. Not only is there no rice exported, but there is also a shortage of food. Therefore, the owners are very firm and unwilling to easily sell. The market is presented as a stalemate. Throughout the market, only the Beiyang Gang did one hundred bags of Jiangxi machine Bian Yuan rice, priced at fourteen yuan. The street bought more than two hundred bags of Nanjing machine rice, willow rice, etc. Machine rice opened at ten yuan, zero four jiao and a half, willow rice at ten yuan, zero five jiao. Ganwan and other Xian rice did not have any noticeable transactions. Because the production area market price has been rising, exceeding the sales price in Shanghai, the gang plans to pack the existing rice back. However, because the gold price has fallen back in Saigon and Siam, transportation and sales have gradually become cost-effective. It is heard that some merchants have ordered a batch, and because the rice prices are low in the three northeastern provinces and Korea, they are also throwing the rice to those places for sale.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market's near-term prices initially rose, then fell a little, then rose again, and the market hovered uncertainly. As a result, this month showed a slight improvement, and the rest of the months were all slightly lower. The reason is that this month's delivery is near, and the factories' existing flour is insufficient, and there are no warehouse receipts that can be resolved. Both factory shortages and floating shortages are being taken back. Although the forward price fell sharply, it was uniquely stable. The forward price was affected by foreign market prices and gold prices, and both factory shortages and short positions were being sold off. Because the weather was clear, the interior gangs also pulled out their long positions, and the market price could not stand firm. At closing, March was down one and a half points, April and May were each down one point two five, June was down one point seven five, and July was down two points.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Distant Months of Wheat Gradually Trending Downward <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>After the market opened yesterday, the prices of distant months of wheat gradually fell, and the market was quite smooth and tired. This was because the gold price was frantically lower, the exchange rate was extended, foreign wheat could be marked, and the weather was very good, and the new wheat was expected to have a bumper harvest. Therefore, factories sold out, and long positions were also sold, and the price gradually fell. There was a slight improvement with short covering before closing. This month is approaching the end-of-month delivery, the factories have received spot, and short covering is strong. At closing, February was greatly down by two points, March and April were slightly down by two points, May was slightly down by four points, June was slightly down by five points, July was slightly down by one point. Spot wheat arrivals and sales were both lacking. They have not been sold since the market opened.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Sugar Market: Overview of the Sugar Industry Last Year <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>▲ Market Price Fluctuations: Last year, the sugar market began with weakness, then rose, and finally experienced a sudden surge due to increased new taxes, reaching the highest price in years, which was quite astonishing. Tracing back to early spring, the opening price for Dutch sugar, raw sugar, and white sugar was 7 taels and 4 mace. Sales were sluggish, and the market steadily declined, reaching a low of 7 taels. Later, due to the rise in foreign exchange rates, prices gradually increased. However, a decline followed soon after. Subsequently, due to sharp increases in prices in Java and New York, prices rose slightly again, but actual sales remained stagnant, and the market showed signs of hovering. After entering summer, price fluctuations were minimal, but arrivals increased sharply, once dropping below 7 taels before rebounding, reaching a high of 7 taels and 9 mace and 5 fen. After autumn, as planting season approached, prices remained at 8 taels or higher. The price of new goods was above 8 taels. At this time, transactions were frequent, and disposals were often completed. Sales in various places gradually became active, and market sentiment was quite strong, causing prices to rise steadily. Since entering winter, fluctuations have been unpredictable. The current prices for spot raw sugar and white sugar are quite high, with market prices consistently between 7 taels and 6 or 7 mace. Later, upon hearing news of increased tariffs, various parties became active in moving goods, and prices rose to 8 taels and 4 or 5 mace. During the Christmas season, prices suddenly surged, breaking through the 9 tael barrier, reaching a high of 9 taels and 5 mace. Subsequently, with the implementation of the new tariff and the rise in foreign exchange rates, the sugar market experienced a significant upheaval. Market prices soared to 10 taels and 7 mace. Later, as large firms and hoarders took profits, market sentiment suddenly dampened, and prices fell to 10 taels and 2 mace. At the end of the year, with further appreciation of foreign exchange rates and dwindling inventories, the market surged again to nearly 11 taels, and even bids as high as 11 taels and 5 mace were heard. Although no transactions occurred at that price, the trend of rising prices was evident. As for Japanese sugar and other factories, their opening prices were also quite high, and their market fluctuations mirrored those of Dutch sugar, so they will not be described in detail.</p>
<p>▲ Abundant Profits: In the sugar industry, various sectors felt the impact of losses last year and adopted a cautious approach at the beginning of the year. However, although the market price of large shipments saw an increase, it was fleeting, and prices soon declined, causing significant losses. Furthermore, due to tight credit conditions and financial panics, two or three firms were forced out of business. The rumors spread at this time were quite alarming. Fortunately, the situation quickly subsided. The summer saw only mediocre performance. In autumn, there was a slight improvement, but most still suffered losses, primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations. Since entering winter, actual sales gradually increased, and the market steadily rose. Finally, with the implementation of tariff increases and intensified investigations in various places, prices suddenly soared. Although prices fell back slightly at the end of the year, they eventually surged again, resulting in significant profits. This proved to be the most crucial turning point for the industry, resulting in abundant and impressive profits. Overall, Yuansheng, Yuanhe, Yudateng, and Yuantaiheng each had profits of 100,000 taels. Fangcuihe had 75,000 taels, Fanghuihe and Junyi and Yuanyu each had 60,000 taels, Yiyi had 80,000 taels, Taiji and Maohe had 40,000 taels, Hexing had 20,000 taels, Shouhe had 50,000 taels, Xie'an had 16,000 taels, Zhenghe had 30,000 taels, and Jinyuanxiang had 21,000 taels. The remaining firms each had profits ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 or 40,000 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Piece Goods: Excessive Price Increases Lead to Stagnant Sales <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>▲ Native Cloth: Since the market opened, prices have soared dramatically. Yihua goods had not yet been priced as of yesterday. Output taxes were still added separately. Coarse cloth opened at new high prices: Nine-pound Wufu at 5 taels and 1 mace, Jubao Basin at 4 taels and 9 mace and 5 fen, eleven-pound Ren Zhong at 5 taels and 3 mace. Sanlu and Santu were unpriced. More than one hundred pieces of thirteen-pound Shuangma and Magou were offered, but without fixed prices. Fourteen-pound Weima was priced at 7 taels, fifteen-and-a-half-pound Sanyuanbao at 7 taels and 2 mace and 5 fen, and sixteen-pound Wuhe at 7 taels and 9 mace. Coarse twill Zhiwuyuanbao brand was sold at 7 taels and 9 mace, fine twill Yanghe was still at 7 taels and 5 mace, blue Shuangyu at 7 taels and 3 mace, Songshu at 7 taels and 7 fen and 5 li, fine cloth Yanghe and Caiqiu etc. at 7 taels and 7 mace, blue Feiyu at 7 taels and 9 mace and 5 fen. Jin Sata bleached cloth was sold at 9 taels and 2 mace and 5 fen. Such high prices are unprecedented in the past decade.</p>
<p>▲ East-West Piece Goods: Due to excessive price increases, both local and outside customers found it difficult to make purchases, resulting in very stagnant sales. Yesterday, only patterned goods saw slight movement, all going through retail and wholesale channels. Sezigong ranged from 3 mace to 2 mace and 7 fen, Guanghua Yuchou from 2 mace and 7 fen and 5 li to 2 mace and 6 fen, blue striped Seding at 2 mace, 5 fen, and 2.5 li, printed Fuchou at 4 mace, striped Fuchou at 3 mace and 7 fen and 5 li, floral cloth colorful at 6 taels, white ground at 5 taels and 8 mace, Zhima Biji Hanshan Temple at 4 mace and 1 fen, Shuangtonglu at 4 mace, and new floral Zhigongni at 4 mace and 3 fen to 4 mace, all had transactions. General merchandise saw only fifty or sixty pieces of Zhigongni and Biji transacted by the Changjiang gang yesterday, as the gold market fell slightly in the morning and sentiment softened slightly. Western goods were priced even higher, leading to greater stagnation.</p>

<p>The spring prices for woolen fabrics were announced yesterday. Among them, Yuanqing Zhigongni saw the strongest price increase, likely due to limited inventory, insufficient to meet the needs of the upcoming spring season. Deji Huangtianba opened for sale at 5 taels and 8 mace and 5 fen, Jiedongfeng at 6 taels and 5 mace, Tianxiang 888 and Ningfeng 287 both sold at 7 taels, Dafeng 5555 at 6 taels and 7 mace and 5 fen, Yingli Fuqintu at 3 taels and 8 mace and 5 fen, Shenyu KKK at 5 taels and 5 mace, Other Yuanchang blue-grey Biji, Huateni, Seding Maguani, and Jiashe Gezi Huateni Qiaokeding etc. were priced similarly to the market prices of the previous month.

Dafeng 2448 Huateni at 4 taels, Shanse at 3 taels and 2 mace and 5 fen, Rongji Qiaokeding at 4 taels and 5 mace, Gongping at 4 taels and 2 mace and 5 fen, Tianyou 2000 thick Biji at 4 taels and 5 mace, Gongping SSS at 4 taels and 1 mace, Tianfu 3000 striped flannel at 2 taels and 8 mace, and Ningfeng, Yongfeng, Dakang, Siqiang Xuehua Maguani were uniformly sold at 3 taels and 6 mace.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Datong University Track and Field Team: South <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>"Study and Sports" is the slogan of our Datong University, and the achievements of Datong University. In a few years, the progress made to such an extent is also based on this.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Shen Kunnan took over as the Director of Physical Education at Datong University, he felt that physical education was somewhat incomplete, because it focused too much on intellectual and moral development, so he vigorously advocated "Sports and Study." The purpose of this was to cultivate a strong body, and then have sufficient energy to study academics and cultivate morality. As a result of Mr. Shen's advocacy, all teachers and students in the school took pride in practicing sports, so the track and field team actually ranked third in the fourth Jiangnan University Games, alongside the Jiaotong University gold standard team of the third Jiangnan University Games. Unexpectedly, the fifth Jiangnan University Games could not satisfy us because of the graduation of old students and the limited qualifications of new students.</p>
<p>Now, because Mr. Shen wants to select real talents in track and field to restore the past honor of our school, he does not select them in one or two days of sports meetings, but often observes and seeks them anytime and anywhere. He has actually discovered a lot of outstanding talents. I might as well make a brief introduction to several people whom Mr. Shen believes have very promising futures.</p>
<p>Li Qiubo is from Xiamen, Fujian. He recently returned from Japan. He and Mr. Nanbu Chuhei, the long jump champion of this Far Eastern Games, are very good friends. Usually, the two of them practice together every day. Their posture is the same, and his result is also outside seven meters, sometimes even overwhelming Nanbu. As for his 100 meters, it is equal to the Japanese Murakami Kunihei's national record of 10.6 seconds. Originally, he was prepared to represent our country in the Far Eastern Games. Unexpectedly, in April last year, when he was jumping in the long jump, he threw his arms back too hard, dislocating the bones of his arms, so he slept for two months. Otherwise, our country would not have failed to such an extent in track and field in the Far Eastern Games. Probably, he will definitely have a very good result for us in the National Games of Double Tenth Festival, and awaken the demoralized sports world in our country.</p>
<p>Gu Yu once represented Jiangsu Province in the National Games. He has won the high jump championship of the Jiangzhe Ten Middle Schools and the sports meeting organized by the Shanghai Western Youth Association. Recently, his result has improved to 1.80 meters, breaking Yu Huaian's national record of 1.754 meters.</p>
<p>He Debao is a famous runner among the Chinese in Shanghai. He has won the Shanghai City Running Championship and represented Shanghai in the National Games.</p>
<p>Xiao Zitong has track and field talent. He is proficient in fifteen sports and has repeatedly won personal championships in various Guangdong sports games. He is really an all-round athlete.</p>
<p>The rest, like Wu Jinqi, Guo Ying, Fang Wenji, and Peng Shuxin, are all athletes who can run and jump well. In short, the current Datong University track and field team is indeed very strong. It is expected that in the sixth Jiangnan University Games two or three months later, and the National Games in October, the track and field team of our Datong University will definitely get considerable results.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Request for Free Education: Huichen <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Who doesn't know that our hometown, Jiangxi, is a mess caused by the Communist Party? A group of elders are mostly preoccupied with preserving their health and preparing for death, so how can they have the spare capacity to provide tuition fees for their children to continue their studies? But if this is the case, let's drop out of school and go home. No, it's impossible to go home without money. If we don't go home, we still have to ask friends for food expenses in Shanghai. So, what can we, wandering wanderers, do?</p>
<p>But forced by circumstances, we have to seek a way to save ourselves. And "desperation breeds change," there will always be a way to get rid of suffering and trouble. Didn't the Education Department recently request the Ministry of Education to issue a notice to all schools to approve the exemption of tuition and accommodation fees for students from Jiangxi? Isn't this very welcome news? But news is news, and in fact, it is very difficult to achieve the goal. However, partial progress may be easier to achieve results. So, students who agreed with each other, jointly signed a "memorial to the throne." Fortunately, success came quickly, and we received a reply from the school authorities, but it was endorsed with the four words "approved for deferred payment."</p>
<p>"Approved for deferred payment," deferred payment does not require guarantee and interest. This is such a "great kindness," but it is building a high debt platform, and it is difficult to repay when it is heavily accumulated. It is not very cost-effective to owe "debts for the next life." So, some students suggested to continue the "free education movement," and some students also wanted to propose "anti-feeism." In the end, it was decided to mobilize all members to make an expanded petition.</p>
<p>After all, the principal is mostly preoccupied with official documents and rarely in the school or at home. It is especially difficult to go to court to see him. It is better to issue a second ultimatum first, to see if he has any reaction. Otherwise, there are further measures. So, everyone decided to proceed in this way.</p>
<p>Three days after the petition was issued, a note from the Secretariat was placed on Cai's desk. At that time, we were just called back from the reading room by the people in the same room. So, Cai and I were silent in the room for three minutes, discussed a few words privately, and hurried to the call of the Secretary-General. When we were about to enter the door, we saw the Secretary-General sitting arrogantly on the sofa smoking a cigarette. When we stood still to catch our breath, he preemptively asked,</p>
<p>"Isn't this your letter requesting free education?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Cai Jun generously admitted.</p>
<p>"Didn't you say that you have already been exempted from tuition and accommodation fees?" The Secretary also pointed to the list copied from the registration class and asked us again.</p>
<p>"Oh, exempted from fees, what an exaggeration, but how to answer him now?" So, we looked at each other again and thought for a while.</p>
<p>"Exempted, why do you want to ask again?" Then came another round of lightning-fast questioning, so we didn't even have time to answer his second question.</p>
<p>"Because we only saw 'approved for deferred payment, not approved for exemption' on the bulletin board, so we asked again," we finally explained to him in this way. At the same time, we took the opportunity to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Although on the way back, our enthusiasm was blown into coldness by the cold wind, we were still "preoccupied" with the Secretary-General's conversation and expression.</p>
<p>First, the request for free education has been approved.</p>
<p>Second, since it is free, you should not ask again.</p>
<p>In this way, it is no wonder that the Secretary-General is justified and confident. But can the previous resolution of "approved for deferred payment, not approved for exemption" be overturned? Or is it a means of "making the false true and the true false" to deal with poor boys? Or is it a "gold and jade on the outside, but with rotten straw inside" method to avoid precedents? I have always been baffled.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Li Shicen Returns to China: Xu Wancheng <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Shicen left Shanghai six months ago and went to France by sea. He lived in France and Germany for one year each, and studied music in Germany. He traveled in Europe for nearly three years, passing through France, Belgium, Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union. He visited the old palace of Louis, searched for the old relics of Napoleon, saw the towering Eiffel Tower, and watched the parallel golden horses. He traveled all over France and Belgium, crossed the Rhine again, listened to the murmur of the water, and mourned the war-torn lands. Berlin is magnificent and Hamburg is prosperous. He has visited all the famous attractions in the German capital. He passed through Poland, stayed for a while, and then arrived in the Soviet Union. He then took the Siberian route and returned to Shanghai last winter.</p>
<p>After returning to China, the philosopher Li will serve as a philosophy professor at Guanghua University this semester, and will also serve as a professor of "Educational Philosophy" and "Modern Philosophy" at the Labor University. Datong University also strongly hired Mr. Li to resume his professorship, and he has already agreed. As for the position of editor-in-chief of the Minduo magazine, he has disengaged from the relationship after the 11th volume of the magazine.</p>
<p>After returning to China, the most urgent thing for Mr. Li is to complete his magnum opus "Philosophy of Life Volume II (Volume I has been published, issued by the Commercial Press, priced at 1.6 yuan), a great book of middle school philosophy.</p>
<p>Mr. Li said that he had traveled to the West for nearly three years, and his life ideas have greatly changed. There are many rare anecdotes about Mr. Li's trip to Europe. I will choose the best to record later, and I will not repeat them for the time being. Now I also heard that the teachers and friends of Datong University and Mr. Li are mostly old friends, and they will initiate a banquet to express their farewell.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Meningitis: Mi <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The death of my younger brother</p>
<p>Is traditional Chinese medicine right or Western medicine right?</p>
<p>Can it be prevented?</p>
<p>"Meningitis,"</p>
<p>Uh, what a terrible term. Indeed, the impression it gave me was really too deep. It had given me a blow that I had never experienced in my life. It made me terrified, disappointed, pessimistic, and painful. Because of it, I had insomnia for three or four months intermittently.</p>
<p>This happened in the early spring of the 18th year of the Republic, which happened to be the lunar New Year. Because it was winter vacation, I lived at home. The second day of Renri was my birthday. My family was preparing to celebrate for me, so everyone went to bed very early that night. My younger brother, who was sixteen years old at this time, was very tired because he had been to Jiangwan and the theater during the day, so he went to take a bath by himself, preparing to go to bed. He said he felt a little uncomfortable, had a headache, and needed to apply Ruyi oil. This was very common, so everyone didn't pay attention. Before going to bed, he also said that he would invite me to Xinya tomorrow to have tea and celebrate my birthday. Oh my god, who knew that an unprecedented disaster was about to befall my younger brother?</p>
<p>Suddenly, a terrible cry broke my deep sleep. I ran down from upstairs to my younger brother's bed at an extraordinary speed. Oh no, my younger brother's face had turned ginger yellow, his eyes were fixedly staring upwards, his whole body was convulsing, his neck was straight, lying diagonally on the bed, and he was silently shaken by the trembling hands of the nanny, breathing rapidly and urgently, with almost no body temperature and pulse. I, strangely, was unusually calm, without the slightest panic. I immediately took a box of Zhuge marching powder and kept hitting it into his nose. Sure enough, he sneezed, but the situation still did not change. I only heard a low and long groan. Because there was no ammonia, I used the night pot in the tea room and heated it up, then baked it on his nose. Sure enough, the situation changed suddenly, he struggled and screamed. At this time, the sky was already slightly bright, and my father, mother, and Dr. Tan, who lived next door, were already standing in front of the bed.</p>
<p>When Dr. Tan was taking his pulse, everyone had to stand quietly. The patient's screaming also stopped, his body was still convulsing, and his rapid and urgent breathing was still fierce. I started to feel a little different at this time. Fear had invaded my heart, because Dr. Tan's expression was a bit terrible, which immediately made me feel that my brother's illness was not ordinary.</p>
<p>"Emergency fright, let's get cinnamon first," Dr. Tan ordered.</p>
<p>At this time, the important role was not the sick younger brother, but the father who was the head of our family. Because Dr. Tan said that this was a very serious symptom, and the situation would be determined within six hours. The medicine was available, but the treatment method was unusual. The medicine with the opposite nature to the one just used would be used at the change of pulse color at twelve o'clock. Because the symptoms were too dangerous, it was difficult to guarantee. The father had to sign before he was willing to prescribe the medicine. He also said that there was no other way to go.</p>
<p>Father had always been indecisive, and he was even more panicked at this time, so Dr. Tan's words were ineffective. At eight o'clock, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor was invited, and he ran away without writing a prescription. Then came a Western doctor Chen, after a very long examination, he said, "I'm afraid it will turn into meningitis." (I don't know what symptom he said this was, because I happened to run away at this time, but I remember that he used an electric light to shine the patient's eyes to test its reaction.)</p>
<p>After twelve o'clock, Dr. Tan ran away. Because I had to take care of four young siblings, I also ran away. I can't remember what that afternoon was like, until midnight, everyone knew that there was no way. We had to carry the patient out to the living room. Dr. Tan's words had gradually gained my father's faith at this time, however, it was too late.</p>
<p>It is so sad to watch the situation of a person who is gasping for breath and cannot die. I finally couldn't bear it anymore, I couldn't care about the dignity of the parents anymore, "Carry him to the hospital, it's better to find a way than to wait for death, "I really can't tolerate it anymore, my conscience has urged me to say this.</p>
<p>It was dawn, and an ambulance of the Red Cross brought my poor younger brother to a certain hospital. I advocated going to the Japanese Doctor Fumin Hospital, but the old man (not the father) said that a certain hospital was good, there were very good German doctors there. Naturally, the old man's words must be right, what does the opinion of a child count?</p>
<p>In the afternoon, it was the afternoon of the second day after the onset of the disease, and also the afternoon that the patient had been in the hospital for half a day. When I went to the hospital to see him, it was said that not a single doctor had come, only the head nurse and nurses changed him (the patient) into a hospital gown, recorded his name, etc., and then left, because they said that the patient had come in at ten o'clock, and the doctor's service time had passed. What to do? The illness is critical, can it be extended to tomorrow for diagnosis just by changing into a hospital gown and adding an ice pack to the head? The rules of the hospital are strict. Although it is a first-class single room, only two people are allowed to accompany, and no more people can join in to discuss solutions. The nurses are like tigers, and if you ask one more question, you will be scolded, especially the green-eyed female head nurse, chasing away the people who ask about the illness like a hungry tiger chasing a sheep. There is no way, you can only ask more</p>
