<p>今日華盛頓電。謂美將有經濟史上最激烈之行動在醖釀中。所謂最激烈之行動者何即以蘇俄五年計劃有類强迫工作。擬禁止一切蘇俄貨物入境是也。此議如果實行。誠爲引起經濟糾紛之一大問題亦近今世界可注意之事也美政府停付戰債之計劃。世界已視爲經濟史上可驚之特殊舉動。其本意在結歡於德。而今之欲禁止俄貨入境則又似欲結怨於俄。夫俄與德之關係。向來若即若離德外交家高瞻遠矚於國際間之形勢。歐美强國。於經濟上有以助我。則我親彼以絶俄歐美强國不能助我。則親俄以與歐美强國抗故德國迭次發表其强硬之呼訴。蓋亦有所挾而來也。美之對俄倾嗶銷。爲心目中惟一之勁敵。而又懼其聯合與國以爲助。故不敢輕有所舉動。今者德旣因停付戰債之惠而與美親。自必不再親俄以抗美。吾故謂華盛頓電而果非虚者。則美之經濟上兩特殊舉動。必有相聯之關係者也。且世界懼俄傾銷者不僅美。歐洲各强國。皆將受傾銷影響。美固熟察此中情勢者。現法國對停付計劃。雖尙在爭持之間。然因德法間關係之鉅。對德亦必出於諒解。此後美與歐洲之經濟政策。或將一變從前之局面。聯成一線以應付俄。亦未可知也。</p>

<p>法總理賴伐爾外長白里安財長法蘭亭等舉行世界經濟康健上重要會議、自下午二時起至晚六時而散、事後法政府發一官報、僅謂與會諸人研究胡佛總統計劃法政府復文、及全世界對於二者之反響、料星期一當繼續會商云、但據與會某君告美聯社記者、則今日談話中所得一般的印象頗佳、雙方交換意見、非常詳盡、現美財長與大使已將該談話結果電告華盛頓、</p>
<p>國民社二十七日巴黎電　美法兩國間關於有胡佛計劃之討論會、今日下午在法外部開始、會議室四圍氣息、内外不達、内容極爲秘密、故在該項問題得有何種解决方式以前、外間决難探知究竟也、會議畢總理及外長即延見德國大使和希氏、告以交涉進展狀况後、由外長白里安將法政府正式邀請德總理白魯寗及外長寇蒂斯之請柬、交與德大使、法總理並對於德法二國外交人物能相晤聚、表示欣悅之意、至德法晤聚日期、則尙未决定、大約須視美法星期一日第二次會議畢行後、始能稍有眉目、</p>
<p>國民社二十七日柏林電　德國觀望巴黎之美法談判頗爲憂急、美聯社從可靠方面獲得消息、德雖不圖干涉雙方談話、但爲對法要求讓步計、願將楊格計劃滿期後方始到期之債劵、計五萬四千五百萬馬克即等於一年無條件賠欵之數繳存國際銀行、至德國今日疑懼紛集、即慮美總統之計劃失敗、又慮法美談判結果之難測、更懼比希南斯拉夫等國紛紛提出特别要求、故財政情形益見惡劣、德意志銀行提出之外幣共達六千萬馬克、多係外國銀行家收回短期借欵云、</p>

<p>郭啟達詹文耀三比六六比四六比三六比一錢耀彬馮念慈</p>
<p>郭詹勝錢馮、三比一、高下顯明、錢馮火氣太繁、觸網野球乃多、而時有互爭之病、一不耐煩、球出不準郭啟達此中佼佼、鎭定非凡、第一盤郭寗以三比六失敗後、第二盤竭力爭競、三比二、四比三、而五比四、以六比四四勝一盤、二三兩盤、錢馮每况愈下、散拒乏力矣、</p>

<p>— 閻西風</p>
<p>軼裴將軍。粤之新會人。保定軍校畢業。國軍底定南京後。歷任軍官圑副圑長。敎導隊籌備處處長。敎導第一師師長。國府警衛師師長。最近膺中央之命爲國民政府警衛軍軍長。日前患盲腸炎入中央醫院。竟因敗血膿毒症於二十四日午後二時辭世。實中央一大損失。馮氏生前。持身廉潔。勤奮用命。去歲討伐閻馮。極著勞勳。總司令赴江西之先。本擬率隊前往。竟於此數日内長逝。全師官兵均爲之泣下沾襟。明日將移柩兩廣會館。全軍少校以上官佐均須前往送殯</p>
<p>馮氏身頗肥胖常帶玳瑁匡眼鏡。軍服皮靴無一處不整潔。一次赴步兵二圑檢閱。胸前一紐未扣。守門兵爲之扣訖。回部後對該兵發令奘勵。並與以大洋十元。又常在紀念台上訓話云。望本師官兵注意運動。勿效本師長之肥胖病態。說畢笑聲吃吃然。馮氏以又鑒京中生活程度高漲力勸官佐士兵儉約。並云少年時代最易陷入情網。諸君念黨國之多難。當茹苦含辛。懸崖勒馬。所以勉勵後進者。無微不至。財政用人。一本大公。常云馮某人不想作軍閥。所有官佐。均由總司令交來加委。本師長未嘗薦一人。其實余之舊部亦復不少。較之一般所謂大人物者。其人格蓋高出數十倍矣。馮氏尙有老母在堂。極盡爲子之道。常自謂當排長時。每月收入三十元。以二十元供母。以十元自用。當此國家多事之秋。道德倫亡之際。竟與世長辭。論者哀之惜之。去歲出發時。招集全師官佐曰。敎導師的官。敎導師的兵。是不許打敗仗的。其豪氣猶可想見。出師後即將隴海重鎭馬牧集歸德相繼攻下。以後長驅入濟轉戰豫西。蓋無役不從。無戰不勝凱旋歸京後。訓練一如往常。無絲毫驕氣。天竟不假以年。實堪興嘆。今就所知聊書數語以誌哀忱。</p>

<p>— 曹夢魚</p>
<p>釵頭鳳一劇。爲慧生唯一傑作。其所以轟動一時。重以陸放翁之故。蓋有文學的歷史關係也。而吾友林子儷琴。亦因是故。不憚僕僕長途。遠道至滬。二十三夜慧生貼演此劇。余邀儷琴往觀。惟余因赴讌飲。入場時已十下。菊朋之前部鼎盛春秋。已演至昭關。未得暢聆淸越之佳奏。</p>
<p>慧生於此劇。别有心得。故其唱做表白。皆臻化境。如一道其妙。則又非筆墨所能宣。一言以蔽之。眞美善。此劇立意之佳。實造絶頂。雖不盡如正史。即此適見所長。而編製之經濟。正如新羅八大之畫。着墨不多。自饒風格。佈局尤妙。夾寫兒女英雄。一一暗相呼應。有宋士程獨孤策之俠義。斯有陸放翁唐慧仙之痴情。更有陸母之悍暴。不空之淫惡。而沈園題詞一場。以恒人惻隱心而論。士程似不合以直德人。爲狡詐事。陰使獨孤策佯言慧仙爲士程新寵。試探放翁。至令愴感題詞。更使慧仙閱詞大慟。攖疾不起。釀成慘局。事雖殘酷。有失恒人月缺冀圓之心。然若删去此節。則全劇精神。即復渙散。且無予人咀嚼之餘味。而况慧仙彌留之際。即于歸放翁之日。鼓樂過場。即足表示花燭圑圓。予人以不滿意之滿意。此種妙處。又如南宮書法。意到筆不到。否則。平鋪直叙。一無驚人之筆。又可足取。至其塲子之緊湊。情節之動人。尤覺愈進愈急。當時隔座有三五婦女。每觀至悽慘處。輒發驚歎之聲。噫。聲色感人。竟至如此。儷琴雖非女性。亦爲迴腸盪氣。一再咨嗟。歸後即賦詩見示云。死慘生悲數亦奇。竟無藥石療情痴。傷心一闋釵頭鳳。留與荀郎譜竹枝。月暗燈昏夜漏遲。哀絃譜出斷腸詞。鵑啼雁唳聽何忍。涙濕靑衫自不知</p>

<p>夫用藥以治病。固無異用兵以平亂。必勦撫兼施。乃克有濟。而治癆用藥爲尤甚。蓋其本元已損。猶弱國内亂之迫於用兵。相機勦撫中。更宜處處注重於國計民生。俾國家之大本穩固。而亂自易平。我國醫者。未嘗不知治癆用藥之難。顧於市售治癆新藥。往往不屑聞問。徒恃一二古方。增减敷衍。安望其爲治哉。余自懸壼海上。三十年來。於中西新藥。每好研究。有裨補治理者。且樂爲宣敭。近惟試用本埠中華路二○三號培生製藥公司之益金草。成績最佳。其性質和平。而收效神速。不愧爲肺病根治良藥。以之喻兵。自是强弱國平内亂之王者師也。爰誌數語。作余試騐後之報告云。</p>

<p>二十二日晨。回波羅奈。車中遇一敎授。述及印度階級制度之迷信。曰所謂隆級制度。不但分一二三四級而已。中間每級更分若干級。即回敎亦然。大抵每一級中分十派。各派均不相往來。不能通婚。彼曾列一表示余。每一級各有專門名詞。全印度人可分成數百千階級。永不往來。永無合作之希望。此所以永難得自由也。具如語言文字。每省各異。故英文較爲通行。凡此諸滯碍。皆與他人以好機會。故印度自由殊未易言耳。途中見麥已黃熟。男女刈麥於田。回想市中豪貴汽車逐風。何日可講平等乎。且印度之運動。與中國異。印度運動皆先帶一首領。而運動者與中國少年之自由運動大不同也。余念印度階級制度如此嚴密。故無運動之可能。彼欲其人民如醃成之鹹魚。永不活動也。但現在亦漸有難維持之勢。新潮日高。將來階級制終歸淘汰。</p>
<p>下午到波羅奈。住印度學校。</p>
<p>二十三晨黎明。聞諸生禱歌聲。蓋每晨之禮也。印人好神如此。故子弟循良守禮。余在各地。常見少年向我行禮。行禮者有學生。有勞動者。蓋勞働社會向主人階級行禮。以爲常也。有甚小之小兒。才三四歲。亦見客知行禮。甚矣印人之好善也。昔在日本遊各地。彬彬有禮。惟華人自稱禮樂文明之邦。亦悍傲甚矣。各地見外人多欺之。即甲省人見乙省人。亦多欺之。願敎育家大注意焉。一僕人示我其身上所帶之三根線繩·謂爲甚要緊。余問何意。答三根線繩。一表明屬何神。二屬何姓氏。三屬何階級。此三根線。與頭上之三根毛。大有關係。余至今始悟何以印人頭上留數根毛。乃以表明階級氏系者。異邦人調查眞不易。有我不注意。而彼乃以爲大要者。此類是也。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>夫人不做聲，當眞下樓去了。子良被伊一纒，心裹很亂，而且肚子又餓，一時也不易動筆，姑且閉目養神，打算收收放心，才可以做事；不料歇不多時，樓梯上一陣劇響，夫人趕上來了。大踏步進亭子間來，只見伊一手一枝鉛筆，一手一張白紙，立在書桌旁邊：</p>
<p>「我的作文好了先替我改！」</p>
<p>說着，伊將白紙放在子良面前，子良一看題目，便不明白：</p>
<p>「這題目是什麽？」</p>
<p>「王老伯之處女死。就是說他是第一次死。」</p>
<p>「什麽話？」</p>
<p>「中國話！」</p>
<p>子良把伊那一篇文章，也不細看，對旁邊字紙簍内一抛，夫人見了，便把身體對一雙椅子上坐下去雙手掩着面孔，哭起來了。子良起初，非常鎭靜，憑伊怎樣，總一味不響。後來想想：似乎是自己的處置，太過分些。再對伊看時，伊還是哭着，兩肩動得很厲害。子良一想：伊只管哭，我當然不能做事，還騙伊下去的好，所以走過去，在伊肩頭拍拍：</p>
<p>「别哭罷！這是我的不是。」</p>
<p>不料子良話猶未了，忽然夫人兩手從面孔上取去，哈哈的大笑起來了，面孔上那裹有什麽眼涙？子良此時，不免呆了。</p>
<p>「我今天下午，一個人往游泳塲去，不要你領。」</p>
<p>「過一天，我領你去，一個人去不得！」月如夫人立起來了：</p>
<p>「爲什麽去不得？你怕我跟了别的男子跑掉麽？老實說：我是一向規矩的，在小學一年級的時候，就是男女同學的，只有你們姓潘的女子，很不規矩！」</p>
<p>子良怪訝起來：</p>
<p>「姓潘的女子不規矩？我們家裹？誰？」</p>
<p>「你的祖上出了好幾個淫婦：」</p>
<p>「放屁：」</p>
<p>子良坐到原位上去了。</p>
<p>「你的十七八代太姑母潘金蓮潘巧雲，都不是好東西！」</p>

<p>— 王兆泰</p>
<p>中國社會根本不能穩固的原因、係由經濟的破産、設欲將中國建設成世界上的新國家、非改造鄕村經濟、最近中委張繼先生提議振興中國宜農爲主、工爲賓、實爲名論、不過我們住在市城的人、雖說知道農業重要、然而知道農村狀况實在情形的尙鮮、我們無論到那省的鄕間、皆是十室九窮流離失所、那種悲慘亡國的現像、實在可憐到萬分、不過只樣千頭萬緒的鄕村、從那一項振興起、才可以敎三萬萬以上的勤儉耐勞無辜農民得生在安樂的世界上、當然是不容易的一椿事、然而我們不能因爲艱難的原故、就因噎廢食、停止了我們偉大的抱負、勇往直前的精神、雖是千山萬水、榛棘叢生的前途、也要盡我們國民的力量去做的、自從平民敎育會幹事長晏湯初博士提倡敎育須與生活打成一片的原質與馮梯霞博士用增加生産組織鄕村新中國經濟的方法作整個改良鄕村計劃、實事求事業在定縣試騐區裹實行試騐了現在已有相當的成績、如猪種改良、的確爲農民所信仰、其他種種皆是用科學的方法改良農産有莫大的貢獻、不能不欽佩晏馮二位博士規劃的遠大與犧牲的精神、其次就是我所要說的鷄種改良、</p>
<p>鷄種改良、也要算是中國農村中極重的問題之一、因爲世界上如中國養鷄的普遍、差不多任何國家所沒有的、就是美國稱爲世界第一養鷄國家、也不能如中國家家有、人人愛的情形、當然有他的特長與益利、農民才喜歡飼養、我現在先講他對於國家經濟的重要、我國人對於養鷄根本就未曾注意、所以知道的人也就少了、我國個個人知道中國的絲茶銷售世界各國、每年出口數量之鉅、而不知道每年出口鷄的生産品除大豆絲綢皮貨外、就要數到他了、在民國十七年海關報告鷄蛋出口有四千三百餘萬兩、比茶葉多六百餘萬、以出口蛋價抵消紙烟進口尙餘千萬、只樣的中國第四位重要生産、反而無人過問、可見我國不知發展利源、坐使國家貧弱、實在是可惜的很、此是對國際貿易而言、若說全國農家生産、也要使人驚爲鉅數、據馮梯霞博士調查、定縣共有農戶七萬家、每家平均養鷄有十隻就是共有七十萬隻鷄、倘若飼養改良鷄種每鷄可售鷄蛋三元、一年共售三十元、以全縣計算、則共有二百一十萬元、中國共約二千縣以定縣貧而且小的縣城爲標準、則全國每年鷄蛋收入、即有四十二萬萬元、只樣嚇人的數目的以一年鷄蛋價値還外債仍敷餘甚多、即以今年財部二十年度應付外債七八千萬全國建設預算不過六百萬以及敎育費二千萬、總共一萬萬、僅有鷄蛋一并生産的四十分之一而已、所以說中國的貧窮、並不是沒法想、就因爲我國人瘼不關心、不用科學的方法改良他、反言之、中國是不是鷄種改良了嗎、敢說、未曾、旣然未曾改良、收入當然沒有那麽多、究竟是多少呢、此研究是北平淸華大學、飼養中國鷄、研究他生蛋的數目、做了三年試騐、結果每年每鷄、平均僅生五十蛋、若照此時市價可售洋一元、照此數計算、每農家依以上估計的三分之一、換言之、每年總生産少三分之二、一年就是少二十八萬萬元收入、我們挪只個數目來看、是不是國家一樁最大的損失、然而改良鷄種後之生産能否銷售呢、我們也要想想、不是有了貨、沒法賣、豈不有過剩的危險嗎、我以實例來證明是不患出賣的、在大公報登載美農部一九三一年需要中國貨物預測「卵之要求亦將增加、」以美國産卵之多、比中國每年多四萬萬打、仍須向中國收買、其他各國更勿論矣、果中國出産佳良、必有供不應求、其次蘇俄用一百二十萬盧布向中國購雛鷄十萬隻、至一九三二年内爲國家獲得入欵四百萬盧布、此新聞載於本年二月二日天津大公報、以此而論、中國鷄的生産品决不至無法出售、再則以世界文明愈進步、需要鷄蛋愈多、可閱各國每人每年消耗鷄蛋數、</p>
<p>加拿大　三一三個</p>
<p>美國　一八○個</p>
<p>法國　一三三個</p>
<p>德國　一一七個</p>
<p>英國　一一○個</p>
<p>丹麥　七五個</p>
<p>日本　三七·五個</p>
<p>（錄自日本昭和五年養鷄雜誌）</p>
<p>我們參看此比較表、就知道愈强盛愈文明的國家需要愈多、我們中國固然無此種統計、然而我們想、就是普通有錢的現在一年能用多少、我想少得很、農人幾乎不吃、此是我親自調查的、在前數年日本天皇看見他們國民消耗鷄蛋太少、特明令人民每日須吃鷄蛋、滋養身體、爲國來健將全的民、故特由國家提倡養鷄、並由天皇親巡各塲、以示奬勵、此是注重國民衛生的先導、我國古時孟子說養鷄良肉爲王道之本、也是同一理由、假如中國要在世界上成爲强盛國家非注重國民衛生、我想提倡多吃鷄蛋、爲必須的事實、又何患鷄蛋過剩呢、</p>
<p>由以上的理由、改良鷄種、對於民生、民族、有莫大關係、至於改良的方法、係用世界産卵最多的力行種Ｌegborn一九二八年只種鷄、分散各村、改良手續、以公鷄一隻同本地母鷄十隻交配、所謂純雜種交配、其次即飼養純種鷄、現在將改良鷄種優良之點分述於左、</p>
<p>上圖改良鷄種每年平均生一百六十蛋、本國鷄一年祇生五十卵、相差三倍、</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>力行改良鷄二個蛋、比三個中國鷄蛋重、此亦增加生産之一、</p>
<p>改良鷄種與本國鷄種、同時飼養、改良鷄種比本國鷄生長迅速二磅、</p>
<p>因有以上實騐比較的利益、遂赴各鄕村演講、使農民了解、頗得農民的歡迎、下圖即爲演講時農民聽講的情形、</p>
<p>自從演講之後、農民要求改良鷄種、每日均絡繹不絶、此亦應用晏博士敎育的原質、使其感觸有自動的需要、對於將來實施改良自能迎刃而解、所以我們首先推廣各村婦女、因婦女管理家務、最爲接近、</p>
<p>我已將定縣實施改良鷄種事實說過、現在再將全國改良鷄種計劃芻議略述於下、</p>
<p>我們觀察鄕村的情形與需要、知道鷄種改良、是中國農鄕必須的工作、然而欲改良全國鷄種、非有相當計劃、進行的步奏、才能有良好的結果、但在中國現下經濟情形、必須於可能範圍内計劃、第一須經費少而成功速、第二須合於中國情形、改良鷄種、以我在定縣考察、每縣祇需一千元、至七年後即能獲數百萬收入、想任何事業均不如此事的容易、但是有許多人懷疑、此種力行鷄種、是否能與本地鷄一樣的生活嗎、經我們推廣到各村的力行鷄、生長非常的强壯、並且比普通試騐塲飼養的還好、因爲接近天然、所以我們只一層無顧慮的、不過我們中國對於改良鷄種、自從有史以來所未有的養鷄科學尤其無人研究、凡一種事業無科學的研究、絶無成功的希望、所以苟欲改良鷄種、必須設立國立種鷄塲、聘請中外專家、研究養鷄科學與推廣的方法、同時飼養大批種鷄、以備推廣各省、國立種鷄塲成立後、由各省農礦廳派專員學習推廣方法與普通養鷄科學、該專員回歸本省、將種鷄場鷄種若干隻、即分散與農家、其時即將國立種鷄塲所學方法、令各縣建設局派員來省學習、亦將種鷄再推廣各縣農民、如斯農礦廳建設局祇負推廣工作與組織合作社、而學術研究仍歸國立種鷄場拒任、以余的計劃、每縣有種鷄一百隻、七年後可普及全縣了、</p>
<p>每縣逐年推廣鷄數</p>
<p>第一年種鷄百隻、散與農民、可以無須特立試騐塲、以省經費、至次年春季、命農民每年隻鷄繳回純種鷄蛋二十個、作爲孵化、二十卵可得鷄五隻、將所得之鷄作爲次年推廣之用、</p>
<p>第二年推廣五百隻、（方法與第一年同、）由第一年每鷄繁殖五隻計算、</p>
<p>第三年推廣二千五百隻、</p>
<p>第四年推廣一萬二千五百隻、</p>
<p>第五年推廣六萬二千五百隻、</p>
<p>第六年推廣三十一萬千百隻、</p>
<p>第七年推廣一百五十六萬二千五百隻、</p>
<p>以定縣爲標準、全縣僅有七十萬隻鷄、照以上計算、第七年有一百五十餘萬隻、此多餘之數、以備死傷損失、故余云每縣祇須千元、是爲購辦種鷄之費、余想中國若何窮困、一縣以千元作爲建設事業、不至不能籌劃、偉大的中國政府、祇須籌劃區區一種鷄塲經費必不困難、再則中國養鷄無合作組織、如由種鷄場規定章程、令各省各縣依章組辦以此作相當稅收、必能抵補費用而有餘、此種事業於政府於人民兩有俾益、希國人勿祇注意美國十萬萬借欵、而忘此二十八萬萬養鷄的生産、須知倚靠人家過活的、不會有好的結果、雖屬美國對於我們中國狠親善、然而不可不防東印度公司的變形、說得好的、或者是推銷他的屯銀銷路吧、我以爲還是自己努力比較借人家的錢都要好一點的呀、</p>

<p>— 彬</p>
<p>某某、</p>
<p>在燕子啣着緋色花瓣時節、你是戴着莊嚴的四方帽將要它去了、我顫抖地寫到這裹、我的心實引起無限的創痛、而且這種不可言喻的創痛、又無從將它有似落花辭别故枝的表現在純潔無比的紙上、這種自作多情的話、你聽了或許要在暗中責備我、對於這些、我是一點也不顧忌、如果像我這樣一個不學無術的人、被你在那慧心中輕輕地責備、我也感到無限地榮幸的了、最怕的、是你置之腦外、不理睬我、</p>
<p>本系同學中、你却是個姣姣者、你那大雅態度、玲琍的言詞、高超的學問、處處都足使我引起無上的敬畏、眞的、我除了對你敬畏之外、還有什麽話好說呢、所以、我和你雖然通了許多不關緊要的信、接談過一些常人認爲極形普通的話、我對你、是一些也沒有什麽表示了、現在、你要離開這裹、到首都做什麽高官去、但我、當然更沒有資格來對你表示什麽、祇有以同學的友情、在我一顆純潔無瑕的心底、對你顯示和過去一樣的敬畏、</p>
<p>我所以寫這封公開信給你、不揣冐昧的、也是寫了這樣、</p>
<p>記得在不久之前、我在師長處聽見了一些關於你將任海上××雜誌的編輯、我聽了之後、是多麽的懽欣鼓舞、在暗中、祇是向着宇宙的萬物祈禱、這個消息是能夠確實、我企望、但是痴呆的我、爲了敬畏你的心太切、所以不顧一切的麻煩又替你的事業前途百方的調查、才知道這消息是比較得有八分的可靠、因爲你出版了一本短篇小說集、頗得到那個女性編輯的敬慕、遂有聘你作助理之意、眞的、如果這個能成爲事實的話、不但我爲你前途祝福、就是師友方面、那個不爲你歡忭吸、對於文藝、據我曉得你却具有濃厚的旨趣、就是已經表現出來的、也異常地可觀、即如那短篇集裹、所謂女性的描寫、是已獲得無上的成功、更以那種大描寫、是已獲得無上的成功、更以那種大膽的描寫、足以傾倒一般好愛文藝的靑年、我讀了、則祇有更形敬畏而已、</p>
<h3 id="c181">傘下 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 冰攝</p>
<p>前天吃了酒後、在我微醉中寫了一封信給你、其最要者、是希望你能担任那雜誌的編輯、因爲這個國内唯一的出版</p>
<p>處、普通一般人是不容易混進去的、同時、它裹面雜誌甚多、將來的發展、當然具有無限的希望、倘若在那裹任職多時、並可接交着許多所謂有威權者的文友、將來如能在文藝取得最高的聲譽、不但爲我們本系增光不少、就是爲本校也要增價數倍、在不學無術的我、或許能得到你底謬愛、賜予文藝上的臂助、所以、我企冀着你能任這編緝的心、是多麽地迫切呢、就依照你底嗜好、担任這種職務也無有不相宜的、像你那樣擅於口才、勇於幹事的能力、實在是所謂做官的好、不過、我以爲一個大學卒業生、專門往官塲上跑、我以爲不大合於我們所學、雖然在目前的社會情狀所學都是非所用的、如果你眞的做了高官的話、像我這樣一個不學無術的文丐、當然不是你眼中的所有物了、但是、在痴呆着的我、總是始終以敬畏的心對你、不能遭你的埀靑、不能遭你的謬愛、我都不顧忌、實在一個人在這樣的一個複雜的社會裹、也不能顧慮到這樣的許多呀、</p>
<p>在友誼很平常的我們、却時常引起我底記憶、最是、過去、都是時時刻刻地在羨慕你、讚頌你、在師友的面前、更是常常提及你、眞的、你却有許多地方是値得我們同輩的敬佩、在上課或是開會的時候、我常偷偷地賞視你底風采、但是、我又怕同學們對我們起一種狐疑、有碍你底名譽、所以、在以前、從未和你有所接談、愛慕你底一番深意、祇是、默記在心底、不敢輕易地表示、實際、就是我對你常引起的敬愛、也不過和同學們友愛一樣的輕重、决沒有超過友愛的野心、這一點、我可以將一顆赤誠的心向你表示、所以我公開地寫這封信給你、希望你也可不要誤會才好、是沒有其它作用的、</p>
<p>記得有一天、我在一個朋友那裹回來、時間是很晚了、你披着一件新制的大衣、手裹拿着買來的許多什物、你底面部在共公汽車的電燈光下、是更現出靑春時節的美麗、傍邊那個男子、我看去是很陌生、因爲在本校的同學中、我是從來未曾見過、大槪這就是替你做序文的那個×君吧、當時、我底視綫是不敢及你、祇和你略爲點首、但是我幼稚的心靈、已引起無限的不安了、後來看你們倆在喁喁低語长情意綿綿、大槪是在說我什麽、不過我這樣不學無術的人、根本不値得你們底注意、是嗎、當車到了××公司、我便無精打采地默默地下了車、彳亍至小的紅屋裹、坐在椅上、抽着烟、覺得一切都完了、</p>
<p>眞的、少年人的心、却是不可捉摸的呢、</p>
<p>說起來話很長、在到我們的校裹的公共汽車裹、尤其是在晚上我是時常遇見你、不知是什麽緣故、我見了你、祇是微微地點首、不敢輕發一言、眞是默默無語而意無窮、你對我祇是斜眼相視、無意和我招呼一樣、這不但使我難堪、而且使我傷痛、雖然我們的友情還是很淺薄的、在平時我就是不善言詞的、遇見後、當然更是說不出一句話來、爲了這樣、你那智慧的心靈、玲琍的口才、是多麽値得我底警慕、尤其是那滔滔不絶的雄辯、眞是傾倒無限的同輩呢、</p>
<p>在過去、你雖然和我沒有多大的友誼、但在電車上課堂裹還可以時常見到你的風采、也足使我奮興不少、以後呢、眞是不堪設想了、你要離開本校而去就任高官去了、在我、是很希望仍是走文藝之路、擔任××雜誌編輯、或許我們以後還有相遇的機會、因爲目前的我、是仍繼續這文丐的無聊生活、如果你任那編輯、我還以得到你的提携、不過我是扶不起「阿斗」希望你不要見笑我才好、</p>
<p>你這次卒業、我想來想去沒榮什麽東西足以贈給你作爲紀念、如果贈紀念品、或許同學們要懷疑我們、倘承你不棄的話、那末、這封短短的信、有作我們同學多時的一種紀念、你願接受與否、我當然不能强求、而且更不能以理智來逆料的、以後、你雖然離開了本校、離開了本系、我總是一樣敬畏着你、並且企冀能夠給我一些友誼的淸泉以沾潤、我一顆將枯了的心、完了、祝你</p>
<p>前程遠大　你底同學○○</p>

<p>Hang Xiyang's Fees for Selling Calligraphy</p>
<p>Since ancient times, selling writing and calligraphy has mostly been the work of neglected talents. However, now, even high-ranking officials, prominent military figures, warlords, and even ordinary merchants and uneducated people compete to elevate themselves by advertising and selling their calligraphy. Is this not a disgrace to culture and a shame to the present era?</p>
<p>Mr. Hang Xiyang is a recluse in Shanghai, a distinguished scholar from Anhui. He excels in the three perfections of poetry, calligraphy, and painting. His style is similar to that of the Song dynasty. Scholars and officials compete to seek his work. He has declined official appointments and supports himself by commissioned writing. I admire his talent and seek to promote national glory, and I am providing modest funds to expand his studio, so that the masterpieces of famous artists can be widely circulated at home and abroad, and artistic essence can be appreciated by all, regardless of wealth.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Guangdong situation, Zhang Ji and Wu Jingheng telegraphed Gu Yingfen, Deng Ziru, Sun Ke, Chen Jitang, and others on the 15th, offering earnest advice. The original telegram is as follows: After arriving in Nanjing, Ji informed his comrades about the circumstances and love of peace on the part of you, gentlemen. Heng also reported the recent situation in Beijing in detail, stating that the hope for peace has not been completely extinguished. Those who share the same principles but have occasional emotional disagreements should gradually restore their emotions and complete their principles. It is only natural that brothers should quarrel at home but unite to resist external enemies. The comrades in Guangdong and Yue should be closely united in principle and should not be separated. What cannot be fully restored at once is only emotion. The first step is to strictly resolve political issues and avoid resorting to arms. Ji offered this reasoning in Guangdong, and you, gentlemen, all said that you would rather resolve issues politically than resort to arms. Heng also knows that the consistent position here is that if others do not use arms, we will never use arms against them. We hope that you will gradually understand each other. Zhan Gong is nearby and has already reconciled emotionally. We hope that you gentlemen will carefully consider the safety of the party and the country and gradually reconcile with each other. This time, our only task is to suppress the communists. Once the communist bandits are eliminated, we will never recklessly launch attacks without worrying about the consequences. These words are still ringing in our ears and will not deceive us. Mr. Shaochuan is also requested to relay this message. As for Mr. Wang and others, their situation is different, and we can talk about it slowly. (Special Dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Chu Minyi Claims to Temporarily Halt Cooperation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sino-French Expedition incident, a telegram from Beiping stated that the Executive Yuan had ordered the expedition to cease its activities in Suiyuan, but this has not been confirmed. However, it is a fact that the Ministry of Education recently telegraphed Chu Minyi, the head of the expedition in Suzhou, ordering him to provide a detailed report. (Special Dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 18th, Chu Minyi telegraphed the French envoy Weierteng from Suzhou, stating that since the departure of the expedition, Bo An has been solely responsible for all matters, large and small. Bo An also claimed that a telegram from Xinjiang welcomed only the French members of the expedition and absolutely prohibited the Chinese members from entering Xinjiang. He also informed them that he intended to abandon the Chinese members in Gansu. Such unreasonable actions in our own country are regrettable. Not only does this violate the Sino-French cooperation agreement, but on the first of this month, Bo An, under some pretext, insulted the Chinese member Hao Jingsheng and prohibited the Chinese members Zhou Baohan from communicating, causing these two members to withdraw in the desert on the same day. Their current condition is unknown. Furthermore, the arrogant and domineering behavior of the French members, such as Pei Wenming, is often unbearable, arousing public outrage among the Chinese members, who are demanding to withdraw completely. Minyi could no longer tolerate this and had to temporarily halt Sino-French cooperation. (28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign sources, the Sino-Soviet conference has been affected by the Guangdong situation, and the Russian side intends to delay it. The issue of road redemption has not been resolved, and negotiations are now being held on temporary management methods for the Eastern Railway as a compromise. The issue of road redemption is still not under formal negotiation, and it is expected to be resolved simultaneously with the management methods. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 28th)</p>

The Dalai Lama's representative previously misunderstood that the central government would appoint the Panchen Lama as Pacification Commissioner of the Western Border, causing many misunderstandings. In fact, the central government has no discrimination against the Dalai Lama, and this has been explained to the representatives. Regarding the Kham-Tibet dispute, Tang Kesan telegraphed that he has reached Lihua. The Tibetan side wants to negotiate in Ganzi.

<h3 id="e12">Ma Yinchu Discusses the Global Economic Situation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The United States Proposes a One-Year Moratorium on War Debt Payments</p>
<p>The World's Financial Situation Is Already Showing Signs of Activity</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu stated that the United States' proposal to suspend war debt payments for one year demonstrates great foresight. Due to the European war restrictions, France, Italy, Belgium, and other countries owe the United States huge sums of money. If these countries are forced to repay, they must obtain compensation from Germany to cope with the situation. If this is the case, not only will Germany fall into a difficult situation, but also the economic relations between the countries will experience a kind of panic. The global economic situation will present a depressed outlook, and it will be difficult for international trade to develop. In order to seek the coexistence and prosperity of the international community, this proposal has been made. As for Germany's economic difficulties, it is impossible to repay the compensation to various countries in gold coins. Therefore, it has to engage in production to absorb the world's current products, which will further increase the price of gold, and the world's financial situation will become more panicked. Furthermore, if Germany is overly oppressed by various countries, it may sympathize with the Soviet Union's communist policies in desperation. At this time, the European and American capitalist countries will experience great panic. Therefore, this proposal by the United States will surely win the sympathy of the whole world. Of course, it will be of greater benefit to China's national interests. Although the countries have not yet fully agreed, the world's financial situation is already showing signs of activity. Taking Shanghai's tael price as an example, it has now fallen below the 700 tael mark, which will naturally benefit China's imports. According to my prediction, the United States' proposal at this time only declares a one-year suspension of compensation payments. In the future, the same method may be taken for all debts owed to various countries. At that time, the countries will not forcibly demand compensation from Germany, and the world's economic situation will certainly be more active. At this time, the tael price may fall another 200 taels. (Special Dispatch on the 28th)</p>

Secretariat, responsible for documents, accounting, general affairs, and other matters not belonging to other departments. 2. Party Affairs Guidance Department, responsible for planning and guiding the organization, management, propaganda, training, and activities of party branches and mass organizations in the bandit suppression area, and resolving and eliminating all party affairs disputes. 3.

As for the areas related to bandit suppression, they are further divided into several districts, with each district governing several counties. Each district is set up with a branch of the Party and Government Committee to handle everything nearby. (Special Dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain committee member said that the establishment of the Political Affairs Committee in the Jiangxi Headquarters is very meaningful because Gannan has been ravaged by bandits, and most of the properties in various prefectures have been confiscated and the title deeds have been burned. Therefore, after the recapture, clearing the population, resettling refugees, returning the original properties, and supplementing the title deeds and other procedures cannot be successfully handled without political experience and those interested in politics. The talent is currently being mobilized, but is still insufficient. (Special Dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Saying that America Will Have Intense Actions in Economic History <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Today, a telegram from Washington states that America is brewing the most intense action in economic history. What is meant by the most intense action is that the Soviet Union's five-year plan has elements of forced labor, and it plans to ban all Soviet goods from entering the country. If this proposal is implemented, it will be a major issue that will cause economic disputes and is also a matter of concern in the world today. The American government's plan to suspend war debt payments has been regarded by the world as a special and shocking move in economic history. Its original intention was to befriend Germany, but now the desire to ban Russian goods from entering the country seems to be intended to offend Russia. The relationship between Russia and Germany has always been close and distant. German diplomats have a long-term vision of the international situation. If the European and American powers can help me economically, then I will be close to them and break off with Russia. If the European and American powers cannot help me, then I will be close to Russia to resist the European and American powers. Therefore, Germany has repeatedly issued its tough calls, which is also due to having something to rely on. America's fear of Russia's dumping is because Russia is the only strong enemy in its eyes. It also fears that Russia will unite with other countries to help it, so it dares not to take any actions lightly. Now that Germany is befriended by the United States because of the suspension of war debts, it will certainly no longer be close to Russia to resist the United States. Therefore, I say that if the telegram from Washington is indeed not false, then America's two special economic actions must have a related relationship. Furthermore, the world is afraid of Russian dumping, and it is not only America that is. All European powers will be affected by the dumping. America is certainly well aware of this situation. Although France is still in dispute over the suspension plan, because of the great importance of the relationship between Germany and France, it must also be understanding towards Germany. From now on, the economic policies of America and Europe may undergo a change from the previous situation and unite to deal with Russia. This is also not impossible.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that reclaiming wasteland throughout the country is the primary plan for developing the national livelihood. There are clear provisions in the provisional constitution, and it is particularly suitable for national economic and financial resources to have prisoners reclaim wasteland and colonize border areas. It has specifically planned to follow the previously established prison labor colonization plan, and to divide the provinces in the northwest border and other regions into areas of approximately 10,000 mu each. Each area is divided into nine smaller areas, like the ancient well-field system. The small and medium areas are used as dwellings, and each small area occupies approximately 1,100 mu, excluding ditches, roads, and uncultivable land, approximately 7,000 mu can be obtained. Calculating 30 mu of land reclaimed per person, each area can transfer 250 prisoners, and five areas are a section. An out-of-camp prison is set up in each section, which can transfer 1,250 prisoners. The start-up costs for each area, including house construction, water diversion, and purchase of livestock and agricultural tools, is 15,300 yuan. The regular expenses are 21,700 yuan. The cost for each section, excluding the out-of-camp prison, is approximately 215,000 yuan. (Special Dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Contents Temporarily Kept Secret</p>
<p>Germany Anxious and Fearful of Combination</p>
<p>Stimson Has Left US for Europe</p>
<p>Optimistic About the Future of the Meeting</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 27th: Today, U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon and U.S. Ambassador to France Edge held an important meeting on the world economic health with French Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Briand, and Finance Minister Flandin, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Afterwards, the French government issued an official report stating only that the attendees studied President Hoover's plan, the French government's reply, and the worldwide reactions to both. It is expected that consultations will continue on Monday. However, according to someone who attended the meeting, the general impression gained from today's talks was quite good. Both sides exchanged views in great detail. Currently, the US Treasury Secretary and the Ambassador have telegraphed the results of the talks to Washington.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 27th: Discussions between the US and France regarding Hoover's plan began this afternoon at the French Foreign Ministry. The atmosphere inside and outside the meeting room was impenetrable, and the contents were extremely confidential. Therefore, before any solution to the issue is reached, it will be difficult to find out what is actually happening. After the meeting, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister immediately received German Ambassador Hoesch and informed him of the progress of the negotiations. Foreign Minister Briand then handed the German Ambassador the French government's official invitation to German Prime Minister Bruning and Foreign Minister Curtius. The French Prime Minister also expressed his pleasure that diplomatic figures from Germany and France could meet. The date of the German-French meeting has not yet been decided and will likely be determined after the second US-French meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th: Germany is watching the US-French negotiations in Paris with considerable anxiety. The Associated Press has obtained information from reliable sources that, while Germany does not intend to interfere in the talks between the two sides, it is willing to deposit 545 million marks – equivalent to one year's unconditional reparations – into the International Bank in order to demand concessions from France regarding the expiration of the Young Plan. Germany is currently beset by anxieties, fearing that President Hoover's plan will fail, that the outcome of the French-American negotiations will be unpredictable, and that countries such as Belgium and Yugoslavia will make special demands. As a result, the financial situation is deteriorating, and the Deutsche Bank has provided a total of 60 million marks in foreign currency, mostly from foreign bankers withdrawing short-term loans.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 27th: Secretary of State Stimson, when departing for Europe today, said that the French Chamber of Deputies, after debating the French government's reply to President Hoover, finally passed a vote of confidence in the government, indicating that a satisfactory agreement could be reached between France and the United States on the issue of suspending war debts. Any solution reached at future meetings must, of course, be approved by the parliaments of both countries, but France's current willingness to continue negotiations gives hope for success. Stimson will arrive in Italy on July 2nd and in Paris on July 15th.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th: The French Chamber of Deputies debated until 6:06 this morning, finally passing a motion with 386 votes against 189, instructing the government to protect the inviolability of unconditional payments under the Young Plan.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th: After the French response to Hoover's plan was released, the German side was not surprised, but public opinion unanimously felt that the response, in both wording and spirit, was incompatible with Hoover's original plan. Newspapers with differing views, such as conservative and social democratic papers, all agreed that France's reservations would increase the complications of the situation and would be detrimental to negotiations between Germany and France. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated that France's threatening words could be contrasted with Bruning's sincere and peaceful tone. German newspapers also unanimously rejected the French counterproposal that Germany could obtain loans from the International Clearing Bank and repay them one year later at the same time as the ordinary annuities under the Young Plan. They believe that this new counterproposal is contrary to Hoover's original intention, and if Germany accepts it, it would be adding a shackle rather than reducing pain. Therefore, they hope that US Secretary of State Stimson and Treasury Secretary Mellon can find a way to make the French government understand the original intention of the United States and urge them to be more aware. As for the political circles, it is said that many reports have been received from Washington stating that President Hoover has no intention of retreating and that although some concessions to France may be necessary in the future, he will not abandon his principles in the slightest. Furthermore, the United States may allow Germany to pay reparations in goods, or the unconditional annuity must still be paid as before, but immediately lent back to Germany without interest. President Hoover has declared that he will not recognize the condition that these loans must be repaid after one year, and he does not wish to be involved if other countries wish to regain control of German finances as proposed in the French response. This afternoon, Prime Minister Bruning, National Bank President Dr. Luther, and relevant ministers held a long meeting to discuss the attitude of the French Parliament in detail, but the results were not announced.</p>

<p>Reuters, Argentina Capital City, 28th: After hearing news that President Hoover intends to raise funds to provide economic assistance to the Latin American Republics, the Argentine government instructed its ambassador in Washington to inform the US government that the Argentine government does not believe it is necessary to do so at present and therefore does not wish to accept such assistance.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 27th: It is widely rumored here that the United States is currently considering a debt assistance plan for South American countries, similar in content to the European war debt suspension plan, but the State Department today solemnly denied this, saying that the debts of South American governments and private individuals are mostly owed to banks and need to be cleared up on their own.</p>

<p>National, Geneva, 27th: The trade agreement between Germany and Romania was formally signed here today. The trade agreement has been under negotiation for a long time, but since the issue of the German-Austrian customs union arose, it has been threatened by a certain country, causing it to be shelved for a long time. However, the negotiations were finally held recently. Therefore, the League of Nations believes that the success of this treaty proves that Romania is indeed determined to break away from political shackles and make its diplomacy independent from its creditor countries.</p>

<p>Merchants and People Will Oppose</p>
<p>National, Washington, 27th: The most drastic action in American economic history is currently being planned. Today, the Associated Press learned from government officials that the US Treasury Department, because the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan requires people to have appropriate work, with punishment for those who violate it, which according to US law has the nature of forced labor, is planning to prohibit all Soviet goods from being transported into the United States. However, it is expected that if this measure is implemented, the Soviet commercial agency in the United States, Amtorg, will sue in court, and merchants who sell goods to the Soviet Union will also protest together. Currently, many people have accused the US government of being too opposed to communism, which has greatly affected trade with Russia and caused significant losses. For example, Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has criticized the US government as one of these people.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Guo Takes Martyrs' Remains Back to Beijing <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Consul in Jinan Also Sends Telegram Back to Country Reporting</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: As of this (27th) morning, the remains of the May 3rd martyrs in the back garden of the former Foreign Affairs Office have been completely unearthed and are all packed in a large jar. The May 3rd Martyrs Commemoration Committee originally had a temporary plan to temporarily place the remains in the old Foreign Affairs Office. Guo Jingluan, however, gave up her family and career and has been working for several years to achieve this little success. She is not very satisfied with a hasty temporary placement. At 9 a.m. this morning, she personally visited Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and told him of her intentions, stating that she would take them back to Nanjing and ask important figures from the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to read them and determine a proper aftermath. In the future, when the Martyrs' Tomb is completed here, they can still be transported back for formal burial to comfort the loyal souls. She believes that no matter whether there are remains of Martyr Cai among them, she greatly admires the loyal remains of those who sacrificed for the country. She feels uneasy unless she carries them with her before they are formally buried. Han expressed his approval of this. Guo then hurried back to the old Foreign Affairs Office, took two photos of the remains, and included all the workers who participated in the excavation, the guards, and visitors as a memorial. After the photography was completed, the remains were packed in a leather bag and taken to the car. The remains of all the martyrs who died at the time are completely contained in this one package. According to Ms. Guo, Martyr Cai has a son named Haizhu, who is nine years old, and a daughter named Lili, who is eight years old. Both are studying at Qixiu Primary School in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The sixth meeting of the May 3rd Martyrs Commemoration Committee was held yesterday (26th) at 5 p.m. at the Jiaoji Hotel. The attendees were Zhang Honglie, Lu Tingzhuan, Wen Chenglie, Xing Jiantian, Guo Jingluan, and those attending in an observational role were Zhang Zhenfu. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Honglie and resolved: (1) The martyrs' ashes will be packed in a magnetic jar and temporarily buried. (2) Engineers will be sent to inspect the location of the construction of the Martyrs' Tomb. The location will be designed by Director Zhang. (3) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be informed of the excavation situation. After the burnt remains of the May 3rd martyrs were found, the Japanese here were extremely alarmed. The Japanese Consul in Jinan, Nishida, has sent a detailed telegram to the Japanese government reporting everything. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Disaster Situation is Serious in Various Counties of Southern Shanxi <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Victims Go Out to Find Food</p>
<p>Garrison Troops Transport Grain to Save Themselves</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Is Planning Relief</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: In the various counties of southern Shanxi, disasters of soldiers, bandits, and drought have occurred one after another. The residents are exhausted, and nine out of ten houses are empty. Bandits are unable to supply military needs, and even the people's food will be cut off. Therefore, the disaster victims, unable to maintain their livelihoods, have joined together in groups to go to other provinces to find food. Grain prices in various places have soared, changing several times a day. Those without money are sitting and waiting to die, and even those with money have no way to buy it. Song Zheyuan, therefore, seeing that food is lacking in the garrison areas of each army and that the supply of military rations is particularly difficult, fearing that once it is cut off, accidents will occur, sent personnel to Tianjin to purchase 10,000 bags of flour and to Xinyang to purchase 18,000 bags of wheat. He has now requested the Deputy Ministry to order the Railway Bureau to prepare cars to transport them to the area for relief. According to Song's plan, he intends to continue this method. On the one hand, it can maintain military food, and on the other hand, it can reduce and stabilize grain prices. The various members of the Provincial Government, seeing that the situation in southern Shanxi is becoming more and more serious, held a conversation meeting with representatives in the Provincial Government a few days ago to exchange relief opinions. Regarding the issue of military pay, it has been decided that on the one hand, the Provincial Government will be urged to handle the grain and fodder loan to repay the arrears, and on the other hand, counties without garrisons will continue to assist counties with garrisons to temporarily maintain the current situation. Although the principle has been approved, the specific methods are difficult to determine. The voices of opposition to the grain and fodder loan from the various counties in northern Shanxi have recently intensified, and whether this move can be accomplished is a question. It is also a question as to where the funds for the counties without garrisons to assist the counties with garrisons will come from and how they will be repaid. Provincial Chairman Shang Zhen has returned from Beiping yesterday and immediately stated that he will find ways to provide relief for this major problem in southern Shanxi and is scheduled to convene representatives today and tomorrow to negotiate definite measures.

<h3 id="e60">The Construction of the Hei-Sui Railway in Heilongjiang Province is Imminent <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Funding Determined to be 30 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Vast Coalfields Discovered in Daqingshan</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The section of railway from Suihua to Heligang in eastern Heilongjiang Province is a planned extension of the Hu-Hai Railway. It passes through the four counties of Tieli, Qingcheng, Tangyuan, and Mulan, with a total length of 789 kilometers. Except for the mountainous terrain between Qingcheng and Tangyuan, which makes construction more difficult, the rest is all plains, making track laying and foundation building extremely easy. The engineering survey was conducted last winter by a survey team organized by the Hu-Hai Railway, with two surveys conducted before and after, and the route was changed twice. The plan has now been finalized. The Heilongjiang Provincial Government plans to use 30 million yuan for the construction of the railway, including all bridge and culvert construction costs along the route. The cost of purchasing vehicles, etc., is not included in this amount. However, the source of the funds, whether through attracting commercial investment, local fundraising, or allocation from the provincial treasury, has not yet been determined. Given the current financial situation of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, it is practically impossible to raise such a large sum. According to the proposal of Gao Yunkun, the general manager of the Hu-Hai Railway, half of the funds would be allocated by the Hu-Hai Railway, and the other half would be raised locally by the four counties of Mulan and Tangyuan that the route passes through. There will be no separate engineering bureau established; the Hu-Hai Railway will be responsible for the construction. The Hegang Coal Mining Company has been operating prosperously in recent years, but the coal produced must rely on waterways for transportation. In winter, due to the freezing of the waterways, it must be transported by large vehicles, which greatly affects sales. Therefore, there is talk of automatically raising some funds to assist the Hu-Hai Railway in quickly building this line. The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Construction will hold a meeting on this matter at the end of this month to determine the source of the funds, and then construction will begin immediately. It is expected that the track can be laid by early spring next year, and at the latest by the end of 1933 (the 22nd year), the railway can be opened to traffic. After this road is completed, it will not only provide convenience for the people and businesses in the eastern wilderness of Heilongjiang Province and promote local benefits, but it will also greatly facilitate transportation for the counties of Huachuan and Yilan on the south bank of the river.</p>
<p>The Northeast Daqingshan in Hailun County, eastern Heilongjiang, covers an area of 35 square miles and has a huge coalfield. The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines sent the technical expert Han Shutang to investigate the area a month ago. Han used new drilling methods and spent a month. He has now passed through Harbin and returned to the province.</p>
<p>It is said that a total of six drills have been completed, and it is expected that more than ten drills will be needed for success. Based on the six drills, nineteen layers have been discovered. The coal quality appears to be tertiary lignite, similar to the famous Muling coal in the Northeast in terms of oil content and heating power. The coal area produces 170,000 tons of coal per year, which can supply mining for at least 70 years. The current exploration team has already built wooden houses in the mountains to continue the exploration work. However, after mining begins in the future, transportation will be inconvenient, and it will be extremely difficult to transport the coal out. The area is more than eighty miles away from the Hailun Station of the Hu-Hai Railway. Even if a branch line is built, it can only reach the foot of the mountain. The coalfield is in the mountains, so how to transport the coal to the foot of the mountain is also a problem. The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines has decided to recruit commercial investment after the exploration results are obtained to establish the Daqingshan Coal Mining Co., Ltd., a joint public-private venture, to carry out mining.

<p>Harbin Dispatch: A shocking murder case occurred here the day before yesterday (the 20th). The murderer is a young man of about twenty years old, and the victim is a prostitute.

<p>The Murderer is an Eastern Railway Employee: The murderer's name is Fan Xusui, courtesy name Jinqing, from Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. He is 26 years old and currently works as a clerk in the Transportation Department of the Eastern Railway. He is the cousin of the former Eastern Railway Director Fan Qiguang. He graduated from Harbin Institute of Technology. He is tall and handsome, but has a perverse personality. None of his colleagues are close to him. Two years ago, he met the young prostitute Wang Xuehua in the Huifang Shuangfu troupe in Daowai. Wang is 17 years old and from Jiangdu, Jiangsu Province. She lives with her mother, Wang Fengshi, and her younger brother, A San. After Fan met her, they became very close. Most of his salary was spent on her. As of last winter, in addition to what had already been paid, he owed more than 600 yuan in prostitution debts. Xuehua's mother demanded payment from Fan several times, but he never paid. Because of this, Xuehua gradually became distant towards Fan. Last December, Xuehua became pregnant and the fetus was shocked. Fan admitted that it was related to him and sent Xuehua to the Shou Shan Hospital for an abortion. All expenses were supposed to be borne by Fan, but he disappeared afterwards. The hospital refused to release Xuehua, and her mother had to raise money to bring her back. While she was in the hospital, Fan went every night, and always argued with Xuehua. Sometimes he even slapped Xuehua's cheeks. Xuehua endured it with tears because she could not resist. Because of this, the fetus was agitated and eventually miscarried.</p>
<p>Xuehua Breaks Her Promise: Initially, Wang Xuehua, as a prostitute, had told Fan that she was willing to follow him for life. Fan thought it was real. However, when Wang Fengshi demanded payment of the prostitution debts, Xuehua's attitude towards Fan gradually became bleak. Fan realized that she was not sincere, but he continued to perfunctorily appease her, hoping that Xuehua would be moved. Therefore, every time he received his salary, he still went to Xuehua's boudoir, bought her clothes, and often took Xuehua to amusement parks. He took photos with Xuehua, with inscriptions such as "A wife for a wanderer, a pair of pitiful bugs." However, Xuehua's mind was focused only on money, and she continued to feign compliance, not making a hasty break. The day before the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar, Fan went to the Shuangfu troupe. Wang Fengshi used the festival as an excuse to ask for the debts again. Fan replied that he would pay them off in a day or two. On that day, he paid 30 yuan as a festival bonus, and agreed with Xuehua to go to Sun Island together on the Dragon Boat Festival for a full day of entertainment.</p>
<p>The Course of the Murder: At 8 p.m. on the 20th, Fan went to Xuehua's house, claiming that he had bought clothes for Xuehua and invited her to go out together. Wang Fengshi wanted to go with them,</p>
<p>but was rejected by Fan. They arrived at the Yamato Hotel, owned by the Japanese Terada Junzo, on Shitoudao Street. Fan led Xuehua into room number 1 on the third floor. Then they went out together for dinner. They returned to the hotel at about 10 p.m., obtained the key from the maid, and boiled a kettle of water. Then they entered the room, turned off the lights, and locked the door. At this time, Fan began to discuss eloping with Xuehua. Xuehua refused, and they began to quarrel, the sound reaching outside the door and being heard by the maid. She knocked on the door and asked what was happening. Fan replied that nothing was wrong. At 10:30 p.m., Fan, seeing that Xuehua still refused to elope, became murderous. He took out a dagger from his side and threatened Xuehua. Xuehua tried to scream, but Fan threw her to the ground, straddled her body, and used one hand to strangle her throat, while the other hand vigorously wielded the dagger, stabbing Xuehua's throat, chest, and other parts. Xuehua tried to block with her hands, and her fingers were also injured. Fan stabbed her twenty-three times. Finally, Xuehua screamed tragically and died. At that time, the maid outside heard something strange in the room and peeked from the side of the stairs. By then, Fan had finished his act. He took off his white silk gown, which was stained with blood, left it in the corner of the room, and hurriedly left the room in short clothes without even wearing a hat. He also did not take away the paper box containing his clothes. After Fan left, the maid pushed open the door and entered, and saw Xuehua lying barefoot on the ground, covered in blood and dead. She immediately reported it to the hotel owner, who relayed it to the Japanese consulate police. The Japanese police chief Ogawa then arrived at the scene with many officers and confirmed that Xuehua had died from stab wounds. They then notified the Second Special Police Department, which immediately invited the Special Court to the scene for inspection that night.</p>
<p>The Wounds are Too Horrific to Bear: The Special Court Prosecutor Chuan Ronglin, accompanied by inspectors, came to inspect the body. The wounds of the deceased were as follows: (1) A stab wound three-tenths of an inch wide and five-tenths of an inch deep below the left eyebrow; (2) A two-inch-wide oblique stab wound through the upper right throat; (3) A one-and-two-tenths-of-an-inch wide and two-tenths-of-an-inch deep wound on the upper right chest; there were eleven such wounds; (4) A three-tenths-of-an-inch wide cut wound on the right thumb; (5) Three cut wounds on the upper side of the right arm; (6) A one-inch-wide cut wound on the back of the right hand; (7) A one-inch-long oblique cut wound on the inner side of the left first finger, reaching the bone; (8) A five-tenths-of-an-inch-long cut wound on the inner side of the left second finger, reaching the bone; (9) A one-inch-long and one-inch-deep stab wound on the back of the head on the left side. There were a total of twenty-three wounds and twenty-nine injuries. Xuehua lay face up on the ground, her eyes bulging out, her face covered in blood. The short shirt and pants she was wearing were stained with blood. The tragic scene made onlookers shudder. Among the items left behind by the murderer Fan Xusui was a paper suitcase containing ten Harbin dollars, a diary, a towel, a wooden comb, two porcelain bowls, a bottle of tooth powder, a box of soap, a mirror, eleven portraits, a pair of western pants, a pair of leather shoes, a felt hat, and a blood-stained long gown. Xuehua was wearing a long cheongsam made of blue Indian silk. According to the hotel owner Terauchi, Fan had rented a room in the hotel three times before, and each time he was accompanied by a woman, but each time it was a different woman. He came to book the room on the afternoon of the day of the incident, and deposited a paper suitcase, saying that he would take his family to see a play, and it was late at night and they could not return home, so they borrowed the room for one night. The police station has now moved the body of the deceased Wang Xuehua to the morgue of the municipal hospital. On the 21st, Xuehua's mother, Wang Fengshi, was summoned to inquire about Fan's and Wang's relationship. On the other hand, Fan's photo was distributed to various checkpoints to assist in the arrest. The Japanese police station is also working hard to arrest him because the incident occurred in a Japanese hotel. It is rumored that Fan is hiding in the port area because he has no money. The police station has already set up a plan to investigate. (22nd)</p>

<p>Mutinying Soldiers Reoccupy Xisi City: After the mutiny of the Sixteenth Company, Fourth Battalion, Seventh Regiment of the Provincial Security Force, they looted Xincang, Yamen Qian, Huxiao Bridge, Zhapu and several other towns, as already reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the encirclement and suppression, except for more than fifty who were captured alive, the rest all dispersed and fled to the sea. First, they gathered on Waipushan, an isolated island in the sea, and imprisoned all the monks in the mountain temple, restricting their movement. Then, they reorganized their ranks, boarded ships, and invaded Dushan in Xincang Town, and then penetrated further from Dushan and occupied Xisi City. At that time, Regiment Commander Shen Guocheng of the Seventh Regiment had arrived in Zhapu with troops from the province. After hearing the news, he left a platoon of soldiers to guard Zhapu and led the rest of his troops, as well as the county patrol team and a certain team from the Anti-Smuggling Battalion, to attack by land and water. On the outer sea, the Tai'an cruiser was intercepting them. A state of encirclement has now been formed, and the mutinying soldiers should not be difficult to eliminate in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Bandit Liu Dexing Captured: Liu Dexing, a fierce and savage bandit under Taibao Ashu, was the champion among the bandits. Since the defeat of the gang, Liu Dexing continued to gather followers and cause trouble in Dongxiang. A few days ago, a self-surrendered bandit surnamed Chen reported to the 4th District Village Clearing Bureau. Upon receiving the report, Bureau Chief Gan Kaijun, together with the security team, searched the home of the Li family, where Liu Dexing was hiding. When they arrived at their destination, Liu Dexing and his men were already aware of it and ambushed in the forest, firing fiercely. A fierce battle ensued in the dark of night. By daybreak, the bandits had retreated, and Gan and his men searched forward. Suddenly, they saw Liu Dexing under a plum tree, panting like a cow. They immediately tied him up with ropes. Upon examining his body, they found that he had been shot through the chest and waist, each with one bullet hole. He was sent to the team headquarters. A document was prepared and submitted to the county government for reporting. The bandit lingered in the team headquarters until daybreak and then died. The county government sent Bureau Chief Xia of the Village Clearing Bureau to inspect him, photograph him, and record the case.</p>

<p>Fuyang County Magistrate Transferred to Province and Reassigned: Yin Zhengyao, the County Magistrate of Fuyang, a native of Sheng County who passed the second county magistrate examination, has been in office for nearly four years. This month, he had a mutual assault with his wife, Qian Xiuyun. Ms. Qian came to the province to have her injuries examined by the court. Zhang Nanxian, the chairman of the Provincial Government, considered this matter to be related to the government's reputation and specifically proposed at the 411th Provincial Government meeting yesterday that Yin Zhengyao be transferred to the province and that Xu Erxin, a third-term county magistrate who is currently interning in the Department of Civil Affairs, be appointed to succeed him.</p>
<p>Case of Patrol Chief Accepting Bribes Transferred to Court: Wang Baosen, the patrol chief of the Xihu Manao Temple police post of the 6th Sub-bureau in the 2nd district of Hangzhou, and police officers Huang Hua and Zhang Bin, based on reports that there was gambling and opium smoking in the temple, Wang led the two police officers to apprehend them. They accepted a bribe of over eighty yuan on the spot and released the gamblers and opium smokers, dividing the money among themselves. The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau found out about this matter and sent an inspector to investigate the temple. The money was handed over by the temple's tea boy, Li Changsheng, half in cash and half in checks. Over thirty yuan was also found in the patrol chief's bed. With the eyewitness accounts confirmed, the patrol chief, police officers, and the intermediary were all sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Yesterday, they were transferred to the Hangzhou District Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>City Water Will Be Fully Released: The city's tap water was previously scheduled to be</p>
<p>released on June 1st. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of summer, the weather has been rainy, and the opened water pipes and installation trenches have been flooded by water, making it impossible to work. Time has been delayed, so it cannot be completed as scheduled. They are currently working day and night to speed up the installation. It is estimated that if it does not rain too much, the installation and connection can be fully completed within July 20th. The water storage pool has been fully installed and equipped. The association plans to fully test the water in July and officially release the water from August 1st.</p>
<p>Verdict Announced Yesterday in the Case of Food Poisoning from Eggs and Rice: Song Deming and Jin Fuqing, employees of the Yuan Da Restaurant on Wushan Road, were accused of poisoning Ying Zhicheng, the ordnance adjutant of the Sixth Division. Yesterday, Judge Chen came to the criminal court to question the two defendants and immediately announced the verdict. Song Deming was sentenced to ten months in prison for the crime of business-related negligence causing injury to others.

<p>Son of Ge Qingyuan of Ningbo Kidnapped: In Xuanci Village near Yinjiang Bridge in Yinxian County, Ge Shuqing, a merchant, runs a winery for a living and is quite wealthy. The other night at about 8:00 PM, nine bandits suddenly arrived, armed with wooden cases, and intended to kidnap Ge Shuqing, but Ge was not there. The bandits then kidnapped Ge Qingyuan's twelve-year-old son, Nengye, who lived next door. Before leaving, they left a letter demanding 50,000 yuan and setting a deadline of 3:00 PM on the fourteenth day of the lunar month to meet with someone holding pine needles at the Dragon King Temple on Turtle Mountain, otherwise they would tear up the ticket and burn down the house. The victim has now reported the incident to the authorities for arrest and rescue.</p>

<p>Collision of Ships Results in Two Drownings: At Sanjiangkou on the night of the 27th, a paper cargo ship from Zhuji collided violently with a ferry heading to Zhuji, causing the boatmen to be unable to recover in time. Boatman Zhou Amao and his partner, Wei Xian, fell into the water and drowned. The next day, the ship went to Jianggan in Hangzhou to demand compensation from the paper cargo ship. It is unknown how this matter will be resolved.</p>
<p>Changes to the Method of Collecting Autonomous Household Donations: Last year, the township offices in Xiaoshan handled the autonomous household donations, and most of the money was controlled by the village chiefs and deputy chiefs, who either did not hand over the money or did not handle the matter at all, resulting in no funding for the district and county. The cleaners were sent to clean up for months, but there was no result. The fourth session of the County Administrative Meeting has now resolved that the township offices will collect the money themselves, turning over 25% to the county and district, with the rest used for the township office's recurring expenses. It is hoped that this method may have some effect.</p>
<p>Anqing</p>
<p>The Tianchang County Anti-Party Case Expands: The Tianchang County Anti-Party case occurred in Anhui on June 8th. Because the idols in the county's City God Temple had been destroyed earlier, the masses requested their restoration. The county magistrate entrusted the matter to the county party headquarters. As a result, the masses destroyed the party headquarters three times and demolished the private residence of Party Secretary Zhang Qingcheng. The provincial party headquarters sent personnel to investigate, but there is still no concrete solution. The county's various sectors have specially formed a six-member Anti-Party Support Association, which is attacking the county magistrate, Wu Shuxun.</p>
<p>Changes to the Method of Collecting License Fees: The Anhui Department of Civil Affairs submitted a request to the provincial government to make slight changes to the method of collecting license fees by the Shipping Administration. The provincial government has approved the record. The method of license registration was originally fixed for four periods each year: January 1st to the end of March for the first period, April 1st to the end of June for the second period, July 1st to the end of September for the third period, and October 1st to the end of December for the fourth period. Now, those who wish to pay in full at once will be charged 80%, and those who pay twice will be charged 90%. Those who still pay four times are also free to do so, but they cannot ask for a discount.</p>
<p>Dispute over the Use of Temple Property for Education in Hao County: The Hao County Education Bureau previously requested the Buddhist Association to donate 5,000 yuan annually from the income of the temple property for education expenses. This case has been in dispute for three years and has not been resolved. Yesterday, the Department of Civil Affairs received an order from the province to thoroughly investigate and report on this case, and specifically ordered the county magistrate to create a detailed register of the county's isolated temples, wild temples, and the amount of temple property, and report it to the department for resolution.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Letter from the Zhenhai County Government <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I have read your newspaper's Ningbo News on the 25th, which contained an item about the suspension of the Zhenhai County Magistrate for investigation. It stated that Zhenhai County Magistrate Cao Boquan was accused by the people of dereliction of duty and accepting bribes, and the provincial government secretly ordered his detention for investigation. The content is quite inconsistent with the facts. The reason for County Magistrate Cao's suspension this time, according to the central government's order, is only due to suspected negligence, not dereliction of duty or acceptance of bribes. I am writing a special letter to request a correction to clarify the facts.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Zhenhai County Government</p>

<h3 id="e72">Director of the Hunan Education Department Huang Shiheng Requests Resignation <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Shortage of Education Funding</p>
<p>Huang Shiheng, the Director of the Hunan Education Department, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Ministry of Education for his resignation, and also requested an additional allocation of 100,000 yuan for education funding. The original submission is as follows: "For the sake of insufficient funds and inability to maintain, earnestly request to resign from all current and concurrent positions to avoid causing delays. It is hoped that your consideration will be granted. I humbly believe that education is the foundation of the nation, and funding is the lifeline of education. The education funding of Hunan Province has been repeatedly requested to implement an additional salt tax of one yuan and five jiao to complete the province's independent education funding for more than two years. Written communications and representatives' petitions have not stopped to this day. Exhausted and hoarse, they have only managed to retain the original education surcharge of eight jiao per package, which has been converted from unified salt tax collection and supplemented by the national treasury at 93,100 yuan per month, losing the original spirit of independence. The education sector believes that the salt tax surcharge comes from the special burden of the people of Hunan. It has been approved by your office to add one yuan and five jiao, but it has not been implemented, causing teachers to blame the education administration for ineffective work. Even from the perspective of self-examination, it is difficult to justify myself. This is one reason why I cannot but resign from all current and concurrent positions to avoid causing delays. Education bureaus in various counties and joint county-run and private schools have historically collected education funds from the likin tax, totaling more than 170,000 yuan per year in Changsha and other counties. After the abolition of the likin tax, this additional collection of funds is completely unavailable. Although the meeting of your office has a resolution to allocate and compensate from the local national tax revenue, it has also been appealed through written communications and representatives' petitions, but it is ultimately a hollow benefit that does not reach the schools. The schools in each county are actually unable to maintain themselves, and they cannot help but be blamed. This is a second reason why I cannot but resign from all current and concurrent positions to avoid causing delays. The minimum monthly funding required for provincial schools and private school subsidies in Hunan Province is more than 180,000 yuan, not including temporary expenses. Although the budget for mass education funding has been listed at 400,000 yuan for many years, only a portion has been spent in the 18th year of the Republic. In addition, the funding for compulsory education has not been actively raised. Before the abolition of the likin tax, the monthly deficit was fully paid by the provincial treasury. After the abolition of the likin tax, the provincial treasury is strained, and all government expenses still depend on the central government's subsidy of 200,000 yuan. The funding for provincial schools and private school subsidies is only allocated at 50% per month, and the remaining 50% is completely empty and unavailable. How can this be sustained if it accumulates month after month and year after year? This is a third reason why I cannot but resign from all current and concurrent positions to avoid causing delays. During the period of political tutelage, the popularization of education is particularly important. If we want to achieve popularization, we must implement compulsory education without delay. The regulations for the implementation of compulsory education in Hunan Province, the source of funds for which is to be obtained from temple and ancestral hall properties, surcharges on land taxes, surcharges on tobacco and alcohol, and donations from wealthy people, were mostly determined ten years ago. Now there is no way to find them. Recently, the supervision and restrictions on temple and ancestral hall properties have been strengthened, and tobacco and alcohol have been turned over to national taxation, and the surcharges have been abolished accordingly. The counties and districts have no other way to raise funds for compulsory education except to add surcharges to land taxes or mu donations. In recent years, there have been many local changes, such as the organization of local defense volunteer teams and all new policies, all of which depend on land tax surcharges. Some have increased from one tael of regular tax to more than ten yuan or even twenty yuan. It is really unbearable to add more levies and increase the burden on the people. The local compulsory education is unable to be carried out, and it is also true that they are often exhausted in responding to requests to increase land taxes or mu donations for compulsory education funds. This is a fourth reason why I cannot but resign from all current and concurrent positions to avoid causing delays. Previously, the request to resign was actually due to the difficulty in obtaining education funds. It has been delayed for several months without being approved. I had no choice but to return to my post in accordance with the instructions, and I also stated that it would be limited to two months. Now, it has been nearly five months since I returned to my post, and there is even less of a solution to the education funding situation compared to before. Even the administrative expenses of the department are five months in arrears, and I am really unable to continue to support it. This is the fifth reason why I cannot but resign from all current and concurrent positions to avoid causing delays. I humbly observe that the education funds in Anhui Province have historically been provided by paper and tobacco donations and likin taxes. Since paper and tobacco have been turned over to national taxation, the central government has subsidized several million yuan. After the abolition of the likin tax, the education funds in Anhui Province are subsidized by the national treasury at 150,000 yuan per month. I have heard that the education funds in Fujian Province are also subsidized by the central government at more than 10,000 yuan per month. The education funds in Hunan Province are obtained from surcharges on toiletries, which are specially borne by the people of Hunan. Even if the surcharges are fully allocated to education funds, it is a legitimate demand of the people of Hunan. Now, due to the unified salt tax collection, the future of education in Hunan Province should be considered. Following the examples of Anhui and Fujian, in addition to verifying the original 93,100 yuan, the national treasury should provide at least an additional 100,000 yuan per month to offset the deficit. Otherwise, if they are all under the same protection and are affected by the unified financial system, they will inevitably be unevenly distributed, and I feel even more ashamed. This is the sixth reason why I cannot but resign from all current and concurrent positions to avoid causing delays. I, Shiheng, am grateful for the knowledge and encounters, and have served as the Director of the Hunan Education Department for more than two years. I am ashamed that I have made no achievements and have failed to live up to your wise judgment of people. Before the rebellion last year, all plans could be gradually implemented. After the rebellion, there were many holes and flaws, and the implementation of the abolition of the likin tax was extremely difficult. Maintaining the status quo has exhausted my energy. If I simply follow the routine and waste resources, I will not only bear the name of holding a position without performing my duties, but also go against the government's principle of seeking truth from facts. I earnestly hope that you will consider my sincere feelings, approve my resignation from all current and concurrent positions, and allow me to rest for a while, so that I may be able to make contributions in the future. However, education is an extremely active undertaking, and it must not be interrupted due to the resignation of Shiheng alone. I still hope that you will uphold the President's legacy of increasing education funding and protecting its independence, and implement the original proposal to approve an additional surcharge of one yuan and five jiao on salt taxes, and approve the national treasury to allocate an additional 100,000 yuan per month, so that education in Hunan Province can continue to progress, which I would gratefully experience. All the reasons for the request to resign and the approval of additional education funding are urgently presented to your judgment for consideration. I am extremely frightened and await your orders."</p>
<h3 id="e73">District Nine Counties Elementary School Summer Lecture Meeting <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Education Department Dispatches Personnel to Organize Committee</p>
<p>In the past, all counties in Jiangsu Province held summer lecture meetings for elementary school teachers during the summer vacation. Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education had formulated regulations for handling these meetings and ordered their implementation. This year, Chen Hexian, the director of the Department of Education, felt that holding these events separately in each county led to issues of unconcentrated talent and financial resources, hindering significant results. Furthermore, Jiangpu, Liuhe, and other counties submitted requests to jointly organize the lectures across several counties. Consequently, the department carefully considered the matter and established provisional measures for setting up regional summer lecture meetings for elementary school teachers, as well as an organizational outline for the summer lecture meeting committee. The entire province was divided into six districts, with the fourth district comprising nine counties: Tongzhou, Rugao, Haimen, Yancheng, Funing, Dongtai, Taixian, Taixing, and Qidong. The lecture meeting was to be held in Nantong, combining the talents and financial resources of the nine counties to manage it. Chen Haicheng, the principal of Nantong Middle School, was appointed as the director. In addition, the directors of the education bureaus of the nine counties and the principal of Nantong Middle School, totaling ten individuals, were organized into the district committee. The Department of Education specially dispatched a committee member to serve as the chairman of the committee, planning all aspects of the summer lecture meeting, such as reviewing the budget, hiring lecturers, and determining subjects and class hours. All matters were to be overseen by the committee. It is reported that Yao Hechu, a secretary from the Department of Education, has been designated as the chairman of the committee and will arrive in Nantong soon. The first committee meeting is scheduled for July 1st. Extracurricular lecturers have also been engaged, including prominent figures in education such as Yang Xingfo, Wang Maozu, and Zhu Lu.</p>

<p>Suzhou Private Zhenhua Girls' Middle School held its graduation ceremony yesterday (the 27th). There were approximately 120 graduates from the senior high, junior high, and elementary school levels. Around 300 to 400 family members and guests attended the event. The meeting commenced as scheduled, followed by the principal's report on administrative and financial matters. The paths of past graduates were divided into two categories: further education and service. Those pursuing further education accounted for 70% to 80%, mostly entering universities such as Central University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Ginling College, Soochow University, and the University of Shanghai. Those in service were generally competent and enjoyed their work. Afterward, prominent figures delivered speeches. Mu Ouchu's address was titled "The Responsibilities of Women in the Future," emphasizing three aspects: engaging in education, promoting its expansion, and advocating for its advancement. Xu Shuzhao, the director of the Business School at Central University, and representatives from various sectors, including the director of moral education, Yu Qingtang, also delivered speeches. Due to length constraints, they were omitted. In the afternoon, a school council was held, with Chairman Yu Qingtang reporting on the construction of the new library and discussing preparations for the 25th anniversary celebration in the upcoming semester. Furthermore, Wang Jiyi, the former director of affairs at the school and a master's degree holder, recently returned from the United States after studying education and has rejoined the faculty. It is expected that he will bring about improvements soon, which is certainly anticipated.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Semi-Final Results</p>
<p>Guo Zhan and Yu Liu Groups Win</p>
<p>Competing for the Championship Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Chinese Tennis Club's Open Doubles Tennis Tournament, held over one to two weeks, eliminated weaker teams. Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the semi-finals were held. As a result, Dun Qida and Zhan Wanyao's team defeated Qian Yaobin and Feng Nianci's team 3-1, and Yu Tianguang and Liu Keng's team defeated Wang Hong and Sun Chengbi's team 3-1. Tomorrow, Guo Zhan and Yu Liu will compete for the championship.</p>
<p>Guo Zhan Defeats Qian Feng</p>
<p>Guo Qida and Zhan Wanyao {6-3, 6-4, 6-3, 6-1} Qian Yaobin and Feng Nianci</p>
<p>Guo Zhan defeated Qian Feng 3-1. The difference in skill was clear. Qian and Feng were too agitated, often touching the net and missing shots. They also showed signs of arguing with each other. When impatient, their shots were inaccurate. Guo Qida, on the other hand, was calm and extraordinary. After losing the first set 3-6, Guo Ning exerted great effort in the second set, leading 3-2, then 4-3, and then 5-4, finally winning the set 6-4. In the second and third sets, Qian Feng steadily declined and lacked defensive strength.</p>
<p>Yu Liu Defeats Wang Sun</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang and Liu Keng {6-3, 9-7, 3-6, 6-1} Wang Hong and Sun Chengbi</p>
<p>The pairing of these two groups was not ideal. Liu was inferior to Yu, and Sun was inferior to Wang. Liu Keng made too many mistakes, unable to get even steady balls over the net. His smash into the net was accurate. Yu Tianguang was also less steady than before. Among the four, he was the best, with effective serves and decent smashes. His forehand and backhand shots were impressive. Wang Hong could be considered satisfactory, but Sun Chengbi was weaker. Yu Liu's victory in the second set was hard-won. After leading 5-3, they lost three consecutive games, falling behind 6-7. However, they worked hard to regain three games and win. Wang and the others won the third set, but the fourth set was a crushing defeat, ending their hopes.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Begin on July 8th</p>
<p>Chinese Tennis Club Participates in A Group</p>
<p>The Shanghai Westerners' Grass Tennis Club's A and B Group Tennis League is scheduled to begin on July 8th. This year's participation is crowded, with eleven teams in Group A and eleven teams in Group B, listed below.</p>
<p>Group A Teams: Shanghai General Association, French Business Association, Rax, Portugal, Japan Tennis Club, YMCA, American Country Club, Xieqiao General Association, Western Police Team, Chinese Tennis Club, Japan Ocean Company.</p>
<p>Group B Teams: Shanghai General Association, French Business Association, Portugal, Japan Tennis Club, YMCA, Western Police Team, German Garden General Association, Swiss Tennis Club, Waterworks Tennis Club, British-American Tobacco Tennis Club.</p>
<p>Competition Dates: As in previous years, the competition will begin on the first Friday of July. Last year, it was changed to Wednesday, which was deemed more convenient, so this year it will also be held every Wednesday. However, since the first Wednesday of July is the 1st, it will be postponed to the 8th. The competition must be completed within three days.</p>
<p>Venue Issues: The Grass Club is seriously considering the venue. The Racecourse Courts will no longer be available after September 15th, so all those who use the Racecourse as their home ground will hold events earlier, prioritizing avoiding conflicts.</p>
<p>Team Composition: The Japanese team requested to join with two teams this year, but due to overcrowding, it will have to be postponed to next year. Some members of the YMCA team last year were members of other teams. The Xieqiao General Association only has one team joining Group A.

<p>The Municipal First Stadium Amateur Basketball Competition's elite group round-robin results showed that the Nanxing, Sheguang, and Heixing teams formed a three-way tie. After the elimination matches, Heixing initially gained the final victory without any effort due to the Nanxing team's insufficient number of players and Sheguang's withdrawal. Now, it has been discovered that a certain player in the Heixing team is a school student, which is inconsistent with Article 3 of the association's charter. The team's qualifications should be cancelled, and all competition results should be invalidated. Furthermore, during the round-robin matches, Nanxing lost once to Heixing. Now that Heixing's qualifications have been cancelled, Nanxing has regained its winning position and indeed won this year's elite group championship.</p>

<p>Wang Jihuai | Javelin 47.60 Meters</p>
<p>| Breaks National Record |</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th - The Jiangnan track and field team went to Beijing early in the morning of the 26th, transferred by train to the north. Yesterday, they performed practice at the track and field field of Central University in Beijing, from 4:00 PM to 7:20 PM. Central University students also participated in the practice. Wang Jihuai's javelin throw reached 47.60 meters, breaking the national record, truly adding glory to the entire army. Ma Fengrui's 10,000-meter race was a lone wolf chase with no one to compete with, but the weather was very hot, and he stopped halfway. Cao Yu's pole vault was a solo performance, reaching 3.15 meters, but it was too dark to continue. In total, out of thirteen events, Jiangnan held the top spot in ten events. In the 800-meter race, Central University's Zhou Minzhang was first, with a time of 2 minutes 13 seconds. In the 1,500-meter race, Cao Chengjin won first place with a time of 4 minutes 37 seconds. Cao was formerly a representative from Hebei and is now employed at Central University. In the discus throw, Central University's Gao Shangzhi was first with 31.32 meters.

<p>Only Eight Men and Women Remain | Borotra Flew Back from France</p>
<p>London, 27th - Thousands of fans at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships today were eager to know who the last eight men and women in the singles competition would be. The atmosphere was incredibly tense.</p>
<p>Last Eight Men's Singles Players</p>
<p>The order of the final eight, as drawn, is as follows:</p>
<p>Austin (England) vs. Shields (USA)</p>
<p>Wood (USA) vs. Hughes (England)</p>
<p>Bury (England) vs. Van Ryn (USA)</p>
<p>Sato Jiro (Japan) vs. Borotra (France)</p>
<p>Borotra Flew Back from France</p>
<p>The King and Queen of England attended the matches today. The spectators were extremely crowded, and the sun shone brightly. France's Borotra flew back from France today and defeated Austria's Artl directly in three sets. His performance was excellent, and the King and Queen greatly praised him.</p>
<p>Sato Jiro's Masterpiece</p>
<p>Japan's Sato Jiro greatly defeated England's Lee today, which was surprising. He suffered a slight setback at the beginning, but the results were 8-6, 6-4, 6-3. It took Sato a long time to gain momentum. Lee had taken a 4-1 lead in the first set, but Sato won four consecutive games, or 5-5. Although Lee made it 6-6 again, Sato won two more games. In the last two games, Sato's extremely angled shots were incredibly accurate, and he scored points almost every time. His serves were not particularly impressive. In the semi-finals, Sato will face Borotra.</p>
<p>Austin to Meet Shields</p>
<p>Austin defeated Collins 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 very easily. In the semi-finals, he will face the "dark horse" American Shields.</p>
<p>Last Eight Women's Singles Players</p>
<p>The last eight women's singles players are: (1) Miss Olsen (Germany), (2) Madame Paniautoff (Switzerland), (3) Madame Mathieu (France), (4) Miss Scriven (England), (5) Miss Nuttall (England), (6) Miss Helen Jacobs (USA), (7) Miss Krawinkel (Germany), (8) Miss Lunnert (England)</p>
<p>Junior Championships Defeat Strong Opponents</p>
<p>In the junior championships, Miss Scriven defeated Miss Letley 6-1, 6-4 very easily. Miss Scriven has defeated a succession of strong opponents, such as Madame Shegetoff, a Belgian champion, Miss Harvard, a Grey Trott Cup player from the USA, and Miss Shire of Central Europe.</p>
<p>Miss Helen to Meet a Formidable Opponent</p>
<p>Mrs. Goffrey was defeated by the American Helen Jacobs 6-2, 6-1, which was unexpected. Mrs. Goffrey's performance was far from what it was when she won the titles in 1924 and 1926. She had a smooth start, with strong net play and smashes, which left her opponent almost exhausted. However, she gradually lost her touch with her forehand shots, and her opponent aggressively attacked with backhand shots. Miss Jacobs' serves were very powerful. In the semi-finals, she will face the formidable Miss Nuttall.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harper Submits Again</p>
<p>Miss Nuttall had defeated Mrs. Harper of the United States 6-4, 6-2 last year to win the All-American title. Today, she defeated her again. In the first set, Nuttall made many mistakes, possibly because she was too eager to win. Her serves were poor, but her shots were powerful. Mrs. Harper had a 3-1 lead in the first set, but Nuttall gradually gained momentum, making it 4-4. Nuttall's shots were heavy and powerful, and Harper often touched the ball after it bounced and failed to return it. Nuttall's serves after the bounce were particularly good.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Ryn Lost to the Frenchwoman</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Ryn of the United States lost to Madame Mathieu of France 6-4, 6-3.</p>
<p>Men's Singles Fourth Round Results</p>
<p>Borotra (France) defeated Artens (Austria) 6-4, 6-2, 6-3</p>
<p>Sato Jiro (Japan) defeated Lee (England) 8-6, 6-4, 6-3</p>
<p>Austin (England) defeated Collins (England) 6-3, 6-3, 6-4</p>
<p>Women's Singles Fourth Round Results</p>
<p>Madame Mathieu (France) defeated Mrs. Van Ryn (USA) 6-4, 6-3</p>
<p>Miss Scriven (England) defeated Miss Letley (England) 6-1</p>
<p>Miss Nuttall (USA) defeated Mrs. Harper (USA) 6-4, 6-2</p>
<p>Miss Helen Jacobs (USA) defeated Mrs. Goffrey (England) 6-2, 6-1</p>

<h3 id="e88">A Brief Note on the New Jing'an Temple <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>After class on Tuesday, I went to Shanghai for some business. Guongan said to me, "You didn't have time to visit Jing'an Temple during the Buddha's Birthday. Can we go together tonight to fulfill your long-cherished wish?" I agreed. After completing my errands, I bought a train ticket and went, returning after 9 o'clock when I had had my fill. This is a brief record of my fleeting impressions, leaving a small trace.</p>
<p>A Grand Elementary School - When I visited in the past, the desks and chairs were scattered and in disarray, revealing an untidy and unclean state. Now, the new building is complete, and the schoolhouse is brand new. Principal Wu led the tour, from the chapel to the dormitory, all neatly arranged, making people envious. Guongan left me with Principal Wu to discuss elementary school education. We talked to each other, counting off educational experiences like family treasures. When we parted, the school's administrative officer handed me a piece of paper, asking me to add criticism. I really didn't dare to comment, so I briefly wrote that Jing'an Elementary School has already achieved remarkable results since its founding, but it hasn't paid enough attention to sports. I hope it will focus on rectifying this after the summer vacation, etc. This is a truthful record; how could I dare to make reckless slander or praise?</p>
<p>A Quiet and Simple Buddhist Hall - Jing'an Temple is the only ancient temple in Shanghai. Since the monk Zhifa has been in charge, he has undertaken reforms in every aspect. He has rebuilt collapsed parts and repaired damaged parts. The Buddhist hall, in particular, is extremely quiet and simple, with a momentum that rivals the dragon's transformation on the South China Sea coast. In the transportation hub of this concession, an ancient temple still stands alone in its quietness. The phrase "a Peach Blossom Spring in a secular world" can almost be used to describe it. I regret that my character is foolish and vulgar, and I have no inclination to cultivate myself. Otherwise, entering the temple to practice and become a Buddha would surely be a pleasant thing.</p>
<p>A Seat Bathed in Buddhist Light - Zhifa has a deep understanding of Buddhism. Seeing the fickleness of the world today, he has gathered famous scholars such as Wang Yiheng, Jiang Baiqi, and Wang Dun'gen to form the Buddhist Light Society, so as to promote the light of Buddhism and save people's hearts. Tonight, he specially hosted the press, and over fifty guests gathered. A simple vegetarian meal was served, and the entire room was bathed in Buddhist light, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Anecdotes of General Feng Yipei <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Xifeng</p>
<p>General Yipei, a native of Xinhui, Guangdong, graduated from the Baoding Military Academy. After the National Revolutionary Army pacified Nanjing, he successively served as the deputy commander of the military officer corps, director of the training corps preparatory office, commander of the first training division, and commander of the National Government Guard Division. Recently, he was ordered by the central government to be the commander of the National Government Guard Army. He recently suffered from appendicitis and was admitted to the Central Hospital, but he died of septicemia at 2 PM on the 24th, a great loss to the central government. During his lifetime, Feng was honest and diligent. Last year, he made great contributions to the campaign against Yan and Feng. Before the commander-in-chief went to Jiangxi, he originally intended to lead the team there, but he died suddenly in these past few days. All the officers and soldiers of the entire division were in tears. Tomorrow, the coffin will be moved to the Liangguang Guildhall. All officers above the rank of major in the entire army must go to the funeral.</p>
<p>Feng was quite fat and often wore tortoiseshell-framed glasses. His military uniform and leather boots were always spotless. Once, he went to inspect the second infantry regiment, and one of the buttons on his chest was unbuttoned. The gatekeeper buttoned it up for him. After returning to the headquarters, he issued an order to reward the soldier and gave him ten silver dollars. He often gave speeches on the memorial platform, saying, "I hope the officers and soldiers of this division will pay attention to exercise and not imitate the corpulence of your division commander." After saying this, he would laugh softly. Feng also urged the officers and soldiers to be thrifty because the cost of living in Beijing was high, saying that young people are most likely to fall into the trap of love. "You should remember the many difficulties of the party and the country, endure hardship and be self-restrained." He was extremely meticulous in encouraging those who came after him. He was fair in financial matters and in employing people. He often said that he did not want to become a warlord. All the officers were recommended and commissioned by the commander-in-chief. He, as the division commander, had never recommended a single person. In fact, there were many of his old subordinates. Compared to the so-called big shots, his personality was dozens of times higher. Feng also had an old mother at home, to whom he was an extremely filial son. He often said that when he was a platoon leader, his monthly income was thirty yuan, of which he used twenty yuan to support his mother and ten yuan for himself. At this time, when the country is in turmoil and morality is collapsing, he passed away. Observers mourn and regret his passing. When he set out last year, he gathered all the officers and soldiers and said, "The officers and soldiers of the training division are not allowed to be defeated." His heroic spirit could be imagined. After setting out, he successively captured the important towns of Longhai, Mamuji, and Guide. Since then, he drove straight into Ji and fought in western Henan. He was always present in every battle and won every battle. After returning to Beijing in triumph, he continued training as usual, without the slightest arrogance. Heaven did not grant him many years. It is truly lamentable. Now, I will write a few words based on what I know to express my condolences.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Returning After Watching "Chai Tou Feng" <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Mengyu</p>
<p>The play "Chai Tou Feng" is Hui Sheng's only masterpiece. Its popularity is largely due to Lu You's story, which has a literary and historical connection. My friend Lin Ziliqin also came to Shanghai from afar for this reason. On the twenty-third night, Hui Sheng performed this play. I invited Ziliqin to watch it. However, I was late because I went to a banquet, arriving at ten o'clock. Ju Peng's performance of "The Prime of Spring and Autumn" had already reached the "Zhaoguan" scene, and I was unable to fully enjoy the clear and melodious performance.</p>
<p>Hui Sheng has a unique understanding of this play, so his singing, acting, and recitations are all perfected. His skill is beyond words. In a word, it is truly beautiful and good. The conception of this play is excellent, reaching the peak of perfection. Although it is not entirely in line with official history, this is where its strength lies. The economy of the writing is like the paintings of the New Luo Eight Masters, with few strokes but a distinct style. The layout is particularly clever, interweaving the stories of romantic heroes, with everything secretly echoing each other. Just as Song Shiheng and Dugu Ce have chivalry, Lu You and Tang Huixian have infatuation. There is also Lu's mother's violence and Bukong's lechery. As for the scene of writing the poem in Shen Garden, from the perspective of ordinary people's compassion, it seems inappropriate for Shiheng to use a deceptive trick to test Fangweng by having Dugu Ce falsely say that Huixian is Shiheng's new favorite, causing Fangweng to write the heartbreaking poem and causing Huixian to read the poem and grieve greatly, resulting in a tragic situation. Although the matter is cruel and loses the constant hope of the circle being complete, if this section is deleted, the spirit of the entire play will be scattered, and there will be no room for people to chew on. Moreover, the day that Huixian died, the day that she returned to Fangweng, the music passing through the venue was enough to express the roundness of the wedding night, giving people a satisfaction that is not completely satisfying. This kind of wonderful point is like Nan Gong's calligraphy, where the meaning arrives but the pen does not. Otherwise, a flat narrative without any surprising strokes would also be of value. As for the tightness of the stage and the touching nature of the plot, it is felt that it becomes more and more urgent. At that time, there were three or five women sitting nearby who exclaimed in surprise whenever they saw a tragic scene. Alas, the sound and color moved people to such an extent. Although Ziliqin is not a woman, he was also moved and sighed repeatedly. After returning, he wrote a poem to show me: "The death is tragic, the life is sad, so many strange things / There is no medicine to cure the infatuation of love / A heartbroken 'Chai Tou Feng' / Is left for Xunlang to compose bamboo branches." / The moon is dim, the lights are faint, and the night is late / Sad strings compose heart-wrenching words / How can one bear to hear the cuckoo cry and the wild geese scream / Tears wet my green shirt without my knowing.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Experience Talk on Treating Consumption <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— He Tieshan</p>
<p>Using medicine to treat illness is no different from using soldiers to quell rebellion. One must employ both suppression and appeasement to succeed. This is especially true for treating consumption. Because the fundamental vitality is already damaged, it is like a weak country facing internal rebellion and forced to use military force. While simultaneously suppressing and appeasing, one should pay attention to national planning and the people's livelihood. If the foundation of the country is stable, the rebellion will be easily quelled. Our country's doctors have always known the difficulty of treating consumption with medicine. However, they often disdain to inquire about the new anti-consumption drugs on the market and rely solely on one or two ancient formulas, adding and subtracting superficially. How can one expect them to be effective? Since I hung my gourd (began practicing medicine) in Shanghai thirty years ago, I have always been interested in researching both Chinese and Western new drugs. I am happy to publicize those that are beneficial and can aid in treatment. Recently, I tried Yijin Grass, produced by the Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company at 203 Zhonghua Road in this city, and the results were excellent. Its nature is mild and its effects are rapid. It is truly a good medicine for eradicating lung disease. To use a military analogy, it is the army of a strong country pacifying internal rebellion. Therefore, I record a few words as a report after my experimentation.</p>
<p>Art News: Mr. Zhang Zhenlu, a novelist and calligrapher, has recently collaborated with the old painter Mr. Ma Henian on fan paintings. One is in cursive script and the other is a green landscape. They will be on display starting today at the Liangchen Haoyou Society on Beijing Road near Touji Bridge, for ten days. During the exhibition, each fan painting will be sold for two yuan. Mail orders are also accepted from other cities. If a large quantity is needed for awards, they can be made to order quickly at a reduced price during the exhibition period. (Art Shùnmín)</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the morning of the 22nd, I returned to Varanasi. In the car, I met a professor who talked about the superstition of the Indian caste system. He said that the so-called caste system is not just divided into first, second, third, and fourth classes. Each class is further divided into several levels. Even Islam is the same. Generally, each class is divided into ten factions. Each faction does not interact with each other and cannot marry. He listed an example for me. Each class has its own specialized term. All Indians can be divided into hundreds of thousands of classes, never interacting with each other and never having the hope of cooperation. This is why it is always difficult to obtain freedom. Moreover, the languages and writing systems are different in each province, so English is more commonly used. All these obstacles give others good opportunities. Therefore, Indian freedom is not easy to achieve. On the way, I saw wheat ripening. Men and women were harvesting wheat in the fields. Recalling the wealthy in the city chasing the wind in their cars, when can equality be discussed? Furthermore, the Indian movement is different from the Chinese movement. All Indian movements have a leader, and the activists are very different from the free movement of Chinese youths. I thought that the Indian caste system is so strict that there is no possibility of movement. They want their people to be like salted fish, never active. However, there are signs that it is becoming difficult to maintain. The new tide is rising daily. In the future, the caste system will eventually be eliminated.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I arrived in Varanasi and stayed at the Indian school.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd, at dawn, I heard the students' prayer songs. It is their daily ritual. Indians are so fond of gods that their children are well-behaved and respectful. Everywhere I went, I often saw young people bowing to me. Those who bowed included students and laborers. The laboring class bows to the master class as a matter of course. Even very young children, only three or four years old, know to bow when they see a guest. How fond Indians are of goodness! When I traveled in Japan, everyone was polite. Only the Chinese, who claim to be the land of ritual and music, are also very arrogant. Everywhere they go, they often cheat foreigners. Even people from one province cheat people from another province. I hope educators pay close attention to this. A servant showed me the three threads he wore on his body, saying they were very important. I asked what they meant. He replied that the three threads indicate which god he belongs to, what his surname is, and what his class is. These three threads are closely related to the three hairs on his head. Only now did I realize why Indians keep a few hairs on their heads. It is to indicate their class and lineage. It is not easy for foreigners to investigate. There are things that I do not pay attention to, but they consider very important. This is the case.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>The wife, without a word, really went downstairs. Ziliang was entangled by her and felt very confused, and he was also hungry. It was not easy for him to start writing for a while. He simply closed his eyes and rested his mind, planning to calm down before he could work. Unexpectedly, after a short rest, there was a loud noise on the stairs, and the wife came up. She strode into the pavilion, holding a pencil in one hand and a piece of white paper in the other, standing next to the desk:</p>
<p>"My composition is finished, correct it for me first!"</p>
<p>Saying that, she put the white paper in front of Ziliang. When Ziliang looked at the title, he didn't understand:</p>
<p>"What is this title?"</p>
<p>"Old Uncle Wang's virgin death. That is to say, it is his first time dying."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Chinese!"</p>
<p>Ziliang didn't look closely at her article and threw it into the wastepaper basket next to him. When the wife saw it, she sat down on a couple of chairs with her body and covered her face with her hands, crying. At first, Ziliang was very calm, no matter what she did, he didn't say a word. Later, he thought that his disposal seemed a bit excessive. When he looked at her again, she was still crying, her shoulders moving violently. Ziliang thought: If she keeps crying, I certainly can't work. It's better to coax her downstairs, so he walked over and patted her on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"Stop crying! It's my fault."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, before Ziliang finished speaking, the wife suddenly took her hands away from her face and laughed loudly. Where were the tears on her face? Ziliang was dumbfounded at this moment.</p>
<p>"This afternoon, I'm going to the swimming pool alone. I don't need you to take me."</p>
<p>"In a couple of days, I will take you. You can't go alone!" Mrs. Yueru stood up:</p>
<p>"Why can't I go? Are you afraid that I will run away with another man? To be honest, I have always been well-behaved. In the first grade of elementary school, there were boys and girls in the same class. Only you Pan family women are very unruly!"</p>
<p>Ziliang felt strange:</p>
<p>"Pan family women are unruly? In our family? Who?"</p>
<p>"Your ancestors produced several licentious women:"</p>
<p>"Bullshit!"</p>
<p>Ziliang sat back in his original seat.</p>
<p>"Your seventeenth or eighteenth generation great-aunt Pan Jinlian and Pan Qiaoyun were not good people!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>Foreigners' Conspiracy to Continue Monopoly on Selection</p>
<p>National Rights and National Defense Should be Made Permanent</p>
<p>The China Merchant Mariners' Association submitted a petition to the three ministries of the Ministry of Maritime Transport, Communications, and Finance, stating: "The petition is to request, based on the resolutions of the National Congress and the spirit of abolishing unequal treaties, to promptly issue an order stipulating that pilots in all Chinese ports should be appointed by Chinese nationals, and to set a time limit for the retrieval of pilotage powers currently occupied by foreigners in various ports, in order to strengthen national rights and consolidate national defense. Whether the military defense security of a country's ports is secure is closely related to the nationality of the pilots. No matter how meticulously the port defenses are arranged, they cannot be completely sealed off during wartime, and there must be a navigable route. If the pilots are not nationals of the country, the enemy can easily buy them off, so that once Chen Cang is secretly crossed, even if there is a natural barrier, it is as if it does not exist. This is why all countries in the world attach great importance to the fact that, except for those ports unrelated to national defense where pilots are not always stationed, all pilots must be nationals of the country. In our country, in the Jia Shen Sino-French Battle of Ma Jiang, and the Boxer Allied Forces Battle of Dagu, foreign nationals served as pilots, leading the enemy deep into our territory, and our army was defeated, resulting in a heavy alliance under the city. The Chinese people have not forgotten, and all those with blood and qi, recalling the past, who would not be heartbroken and weep? Therefore, since the establishment of the revolutionary government, from the government to the people, regarding navigation rights that affect the national economy and people's livelihood, and pilots who are related to national defense security, all know that the ignorance and arbitrariness of the previous Qing Dynasty in losing sovereignty was an unconscious act of treason, and advocate the unconditional retrieval as soon as possible. Although it has not yet been realized, it can be said that it is in the process of brewing and proceeding. Therefore, the association has also loudly appealed for the retrieval of navigation rights and submitted detailed proposals again and again. Recently, there has been the organization of the National Pilots Association, all with the aim of retrieving the lost national rights as soon as possible, completing the actual independence of the country, and fulfilling the duty of a national. Recently, foreigners from non-treaty countries have learned definite news that foreign pilots in Shanghai and other places, knowing that the association is making the most effort to abolish foreign pilotage in China, are being vigorously promoted by certain foreigners occupying key positions. It is said that the goal of their actions is to take a permanent solution, to ensure that the status of foreign pilots in China has a more effective basis under certain circumstances. The method of their actions is to inherit the mantle of Robert Hart, the Inspector General of Customs of the former Qing Dynasty. Because foreign pilots in Shanghai and other places originally had no basis in unequal treaties, it was only through Robert Hart's strategy of colluding internally and externally that he deceived the vague approval of the former Qing Dynasty Prime Minister's Office, and from then on, national rights and national defense were lightly lost, and the Chinese people who received its benefits have endured hardship for seventy years. Hart at the time used a small trick, claiming to China that he would transfer the power of selection and supervision of pilots to the River Affairs Department under his jurisdiction. But in reality, the River Affairs Department's supervision of the pilots was not responsible to China, but to the consuls of the treaty countries and the foreign general chambers of commerce. In fact, from beginning to end, training and selection were never given to the Chinese people. The Prime Minister's Office was lifeless and did not understand the conspiracy, and was played by Hart in the palm of his hand. This page of history of losing sovereignty and humiliating the country is something to sigh over. Now it is heard that the plan of these people is to preserve Robert Hart's legacy, and their steps are divided into two types. The first step is to use the good name of the Customs Service as a Chinese national official to anesthetize all parties with what Hart used to fool the former Qing Dynasty Prime Minister's Office, so that the Customs Service or its subordinate River Affairs Department can still hold the power of pilot supervision and selection. On the one hand, the wording of the treaty country's consuls is deliberately removed to avoid opposition from the Chinese people. At the same time, the foreign general chambers of commerce are also allowed to participate on the grounds that foreign ships employ the most pilots, and the Chinese general chambers of commerce are used as a foil. Directly and indirectly, they want to achieve the purpose of foreigners monopolizing the selection of pilots in our country. The second step is to use the excuse that our country temporarily lacks the necessary pilot talent, to ensure that nationals of all treaty countries with ships entering and leaving can apply to the pilotage bureau in Chinese ports to become pilots, and beautifully call it the implementation of equal treatment between China and foreign countries. Although the fox and rabbit are cunning, the dagger will eventually be revealed. The association has silently observed the foreigners' plan. No matter how sweet and pleasing their words are, no matter how strong and sufficient their reasons are, the reality is that they are stealing our country's rights. The position of pilot is of great importance to national rights and national defense, and of minor importance to the people's livelihood. How can it be easily sacrificed for a few pleasing terms or sophistical theories? Fortunately, the association is not living in a drunken dream. At this critical moment for the life and death of the country and individuals, it will definitely oppose to the death. The first step of this plan is to achieve its second step, that is, to achieve the permanent occupation of pilotage rights in all ports of our country by foreigners. The facts are obvious and can be seen clearly. Otherwise, the so-called Customs Service should be responsible for organizing taxation, and the River Affairs Department should only be limited to managing port affairs. As for selecting pilots, what does it have to do with them? However, Mr. Hart did not spare his efforts to take on this burden, and our country's rights were unknowingly lost for seventy years. Is this not a loyal minister and good friend of our country and our people, and one that we should always remember? Now that there are many who want to be the second Robert Hart, if we are not insane, who can fail to be wary of the lessons of the past? I think that our government is dedicated to washing away the shame of the Qing Dynasty's loss of sovereignty and humiliation, and will certainly not be moved by the floating words of good people, and fall into the enemy's plan to permanently occupy our country's pilotage rights. Moreover, all foreign customs officers and river affairs officers themselves are encroaching on our country's rights, and have been borrowing for a long time without returning, turning guests into hosts. The old man of Chu is sad, and Qiu Ming is single-minded. Is there any more tragic thing in the world than this? However, the reason for their existence is based on unequal treaties, which are originally examples of abolition and overthrow. In the past, there was the late Premier's will, and recently there have been the National Congress and the government's declaration, all of which take the abolition of unequal treaties as the most important task for the government and the people in the future. Should the foreign customs officers and river affairs officers under the protection of this kind of unequal treaty, and the pilot selection system monopolized by the customs officers and river affairs officers, be abolished immediately? Anyone with common sense will certainly have no doubt. Unless they are consciously traitors, they will not dare to advocate sophistry after carefully reading the late Premier's will, and in the presence of the national public opinion meeting and supervision, in order to implement the traitorous and self-enriching plans of Li Wan-yong and his like. The association thinks that the officials in power are the fathers and brothers of the people and the pillars of the party and the country, and they must have a strategy to secure the country and seize foreign land, and to relieve the people of permanent suffering. If children are subjected to violence from the outside, they will return and appeal to their fathers and brothers. Now that foreign pilots have this conspiracy to permanently occupy our territory, which is a matter of life and death for Chinese sailors, especially since the position of pilot is related to national defense, which everyone knows, it is not comparable to ordinary occupations. Therefore, we must present the information we have obtained in full, in order to prepare the government's plan to prevent problems before they occur and to control the enemy invisibly. And please, in accordance with the spirit of abolishing unequal treaties recently resolved by the National Congress, promptly issue an order stipulating that pilots in all Chinese ports should be appointed by Chinese nationals, and to set the shortest possible period to recover all existing foreign occupied pilotage powers in various ports, so as to avoid foreign coveting, and national rights and national defense can be permanently secured. Whether what is said is appropriate, please give a clear instruction, so that we may comply.</p>

<p>Chen Shaokuan Personally Hammered the First Rivet</p>
<p>The Navy Continues to Build Uninterruptedly</p>
<p>The Navy's Pinghai warship held its keel laying ceremony yesterday morning (28th) at 8:00 a.m. Chen Shaokuan, the Navy Deputy and Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, led the captains of the Yixian, Ziqiang, Dingan, and Jiankang warships, Chen Hongtai, Qiu Shizhong, Fang Ying, as well as the supervisors and the commander of the guard battalion, Ye Baoqi, to the site. Mr. Chen personally hammered the first rivet, and the captains of the warships each hammered a rivet in turn. Then they took photos, and the ceremony was completed. The ship is 340 feet long and 39 feet wide, and is the largest ship under construction in recent years. The navy is constantly building, and each ship is larger than the last, which is an excellent phenomenon.

<h3 id="e98">Northeast Transportation Committee Offers Discounts for Inspection Groups <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Half-Price Permits Issued for Groups of Three or More</p>
<p>The Municipal Government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: "Approved from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, letter No. 4874, for the purpose of notification, the northeastern provinces have vast lands and abundant resources. Forests and minerals are particularly abundant. It is imperative to encourage the people to engage in development in order to make the best use of the land and enrich the people's livelihood. However, because the area is located on the periphery, people from the Central Plains rarely set foot there. If development is to be discussed, it is necessary to first conduct on-site surveys before starting. The Northeast Transportation Committee has established a method for offering discounts to groups inspecting the Northeast. Groups of three or more people whose purpose is to inspect the Northeast will be issued a permit by the Transportation Committee and will be able to travel at half price, which is very convenient. In addition to the notification, you are hereby requested to investigate and instruct your subordinates to take note." Approved accordingly, the order is hereby given to investigate and notify them, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Pan Gongzhan and Tang Demin to Propose Two Important Cases at the Municipal Assembly <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Assembly of the entire city has been scheduled to open on July 1st. Delegates Pan Gongzhan and Tang Demin from the three districts, deeply aware of the significant impact of cultural expertise and social education on the nation's destiny, will propose two important cases for discussion and adoption by the assembly. The first case is a request to the central government to order the Ministry of Education to establish a Central Printing Bureau to compile various textbooks for schools at all levels nationwide, to develop cultural undertakings and unify national thought. The document is as follows: (A) Rationale: Education is the foundation of a nation, and the printing bureau is the vehicle of culture. To seek the strength and prosperity of the country, education must be popularized and the intelligence of the people enhanced. To seek the stability of social order, national consciousness must tend toward unity. The trend of national consciousness is closely related to the supply of various book materials. Therefore, running a bookstore, though a small matter, carries heavy responsibilities. Since the establishment of the school system in our country, the need for new books was mostly reliant on the Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, and other bookstores. In the last decade or so, spurred by world trends and changes in the political situation, bookstores have sprung up everywhere like mushrooms after rain. This phenomenon is indeed a clear testament to the progress of China's cultural undertakings. However, many of these bookstores are oblivious to the active significance of the book industry for national culture, prioritizing profit. Due to mutual competition, they either innovate to seek sales or create differences to appear superior. They lack a consistent and pure proposition and a national and ethnic perspective. School teachers either favor strange and deceitful rhetoric, innovating and showing off, or are stuck in the old ways, complacent and self-enclosed. In the same era, those who bear the important task of enlightening future generations have vastly different ideas, separated by several generations, which is hardly surprising. According to a survey and statistics from the Municipal Education Bureau, in the subject of Chinese language alone, about one hundred and several dozen types of textbooks are used in secondary schools nationwide. Although there are many good books among them, most have been formally reviewed and issued by the government. However, the compilers and authors are not uniform in their personnel or objectives, and young students learn differently, leading to different trends. Therefore, today, the social psyche and the thinking of young people in our country can be described as tangled threads, extremely complex. The impact of this extends to political disputes, social unrest, and the decline of national morality, all of which are deeply related. Our party, adhering to the teachings of the late Premier, bears the important mission of realizing the Three People's Principles. If we do not seek unity in national thought, then political unity will become a hollow and dangerous situation. Now, to enhance the people's understanding of the Three People's Principles and to seek effectiveness in school education, for the sake of unifying national thought and revitalizing national spirit, at this time of complex minds and divergent theories, it is urgent to find ways to remedy the situation. The most efficient and practical way to remedy this is to gather various specialized talents with rich knowledge and experience, and to establish a Central Printing Bureau to compile various textbooks for schools at all levels nationwide, using the theory of the Three People's Principles and the newly established education policies of the central government as the standard for compilation. This will allow the thoughts of young students across the country to be cultivated unconsciously, fostering a life consciousness of national struggle, sacrifice, and creation, and achieving the effect of one virtue and one custom. Then, the prosperity of the country and the nation can be expected soon. (B) Methods: (1) First, the Editorial and Review Department of the Ministry of Education should be expanded into two departments: Editorial and Review. Teachers of various subjects with rich knowledge and experience from universities and primary and secondary schools nationwide should be selected (selection methods will be determined separately) with preferential treatment. They will be given a deadline to compile textbooks and reference books for each subject according to the curriculum standards set by the ministry (the existing curriculum standards are mostly impractical and should be revised separately). Scholars with accumulated learning scattered throughout the country, known for their writings, should also be recruited and given preferential positions to reward them. (2) Next, the Central Printing Bureau should be established. All books compiled and approved by the Ministry of Education will be printed and distributed by the bureau. (3) After the printing and distribution of various textbooks, the Ministry of Education should immediately issue an order requiring all schools nationwide to adopt them uniformly and absolutely not purchase other books. (4) In addition to establishing a headquarters in Shanghai or the capital, the Central Printing Bureau should also establish branch offices in each province. (5) The Central Printing Bureau will be directly under the jurisdiction and command of the Ministry of Education. Branch offices in each province, in addition to being under the control of the headquarters, must also be under the direct command of the education department of each province. (6) The books compiled and printed by the Central Printing Bureau should be as inexpensive as possible to reduce the burden on poor students. (7) The amount of full funding and detailed methods can be planned separately. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Railway Bureau Warns Employees to Be Commercialized <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration posted a notice yesterday at various stations, stating that the railway business is essentially commercial in nature. Although the administration belongs to the country, its operations should be equivalent to those of a business. Employees should adopt a commercial spirit when dealing with merchants and the public to avoid mutual alienation. This railway is located in a vital area of the Southeast, and internal and external employees should interact with merchants and the public with sincerity, so that the interests of both parties can be mutually advanced. The Bureau, in compliance with the Ministry's orders to rectify railway operations, has repeatedly instructed employees to strictly comply. Now that the railway business is becoming increasingly busy, internal and external employees may still disregard official orders and mistreat merchants and the public. In addition to issuing a strict notice again, a public announcement is hereby made: if any railway employee neglects their duties or acts improperly, anyone may report the facts. Once verified, they will be punished without leniency. However, the employees are busy with their duties and may inevitably have times when they are not able to attend to every detail. Merchants and the public should also be understanding. If someone uses this as an excuse to be picky or deliberately make things difficult, the Bureau will not be able to manage everything. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Ministry of Railways Yesterday Ordered Two Railway Administrations <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>To Rectify Railway Affairs and Restrict the Hiring of Personnel</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways issued an order yesterday to the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, stating: "For the purpose of issuing orders and implementing them, rectifying railway affairs begins with the hiring of personnel. While there is no shortage of skilled and experienced staff in the various railway departments, there are also many who advance through connections and achieve nothing. If restrictions are not strictly enforced and thorough reviews are not conducted, how can railway affairs be brought to a prosperous state? Now, three standards for entry are specified for compliance: (1) The railway is a specialized undertaking. In the future, mid-level and above, as well as key lower-level staff, should not be appointed unless they have sufficient knowledge and qualifications to prevent opportunistic advancement. (2) Employees who have served for many years and have not been derelict in their duties should not be replaced lightly to retain experienced personnel. When filling vacancies or reducing staff, the merits and demerits of performance and the seniority of qualifications should be weighed as the basis for promotion or demotion. (3) The appointment and dismissal of staff should be carried out in accordance with the general rules of organization and all other established regulations without encroachment to maintain discipline. The above articles should be strictly followed. In the future, if there is favoritism or abuse in guaranteeing positions, or if personnel are employed in violation of their talents, or if there are solicitations or personal requests in hiring, once discovered, strict disciplinary action will be taken. The chairman and director of the committee should especially set an example and refrain from abusing their authority, lest they cause public criticism. This is greatly hoped. This order."</p>

<p>Elected Ye Huijun as Chairman of the Committee</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Ningbo-Shanghai Municipal and County Rice Industry Association held its second joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday at Cuixiu Hall. The attending committee members included Zhu Zixiang, Lu Gongquan, Zhao Zixin, Chen Junyu, Zhang Jingzhai, Zhu Yinzhong, Li Zhongchen, Qian Jingsheng, Lu Zhuqing, Gong Zhaoming, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Zhaoqi, Pan Xianting, Yin Lilun, Zhang Nianyi, and 15 others. Zhu Zixiang was publicly elected as chairman, and the ceremony was performed as usual. The chairman reported on the recent developments within the month and discussed the election of the chairman of the committee. All members believed that Committee Member Ye was busy and unable to attend, but the election of the chairman of the committee could not be delayed any further. A decision was immediately made to distribute ballots. As a result of the election, Committee Member Ye Huijun received four votes and was elected as chairman of the committee. Subsequently, the Suzhou and Wuxi committee members proposed temporarily, based on the instructions of the Finance Department, regarding the collection of business tax, that agency sales and direct sales should have different tax rates. However, the industry primarily operates as an agent, with direct sales accounting for a very small amount. However, it is difficult to distinguish between the two in practice. Therefore, it seems appropriate to levy taxes based on capital. It was proposed that the Finance Department be requested again to consider that the industry is related to people's livelihood and grant leniency, allowing taxes to be levied based on the amount of capital to benefit the people's livelihood. A decision was made to telegraph the Finance Department immediately to request instructions. The Zhenjiang Rice Industry Association proposed exempting the rice and grain business tax. Decision: The situation is the same as the previous case and should be handled together. The draft of the association's charter was then discussed. After a clause-by-clause discussion, minor modifications were made, and it was unanimously passed. Due to the hot weather, the meeting adjourned early.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Zou Bingwen Talks About the Recent Situation of the Commodity Inspection Bureau <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Will Send Personnel to Japan to Inspect Raw Silk</p>
<p>Tea Inspection to Be Implemented Next Month</p>
<p>The Daily News reported that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has been established for two years and has spared no effort in conducting commodity inspections. Yesterday, a reporter from the Daily News interviewed Director Zou Bingwen to inquire about the latest situation, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inspecting Raw Silk: Japanese commodity inspections do not differentiate between grades of raw silk. However, starting from January 1st next year, they will be divided into several grades, including superior and secondary. The Bureau also plans to emulate this method for raw silk inspections. It will send technical officials to Japan to inspect the country's raw silk inspection situation to learn from their experience and improve its own methods.</p>
<p>Improving Sugar Inspection: The sugar inspection conducted by the Bureau starting on the 15th of this month has yielded good results. When grain merchants transport sugar to the docks, they must report to the Bureau, which will send personnel to inspect it. However, handling various procedures with customs during sugar inspection is quite troublesome and inconvenient. The Bureau recently discussed changing the procedures with customs to make them more convenient. The discussion is currently underway, and a satisfactory result should be obtained soon.</p>
<p>Tea Inspection: The Bureau is also preparing for tea export inspection, which is expected to be implemented in the middle of next month. According to Director Zou, who spoke to the reporter from the Daily News, China's tea exports have not improved in recent years. This is related to the competition from foreign merchants, and the lack of improvement in domestic tea planting and manufacturing methods is also a major reason. Furthermore, there are often profit-seeking merchants who sell inferior goods as superior ones, causing a loss of international trade credit, which has led to a decline in business. The purpose of this tea inspection is to remove the dross and preserve the essence, and to restore China's former status.</p>

<p>Lai'an County Magistrate Wang Shao-yi</p>
<p>Embezzled More Than 9,000 Yuan of Public Funds</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Chen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, received a secret telegram from the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance stating that Wang Shao-yi, the magistrate of Lai'an County, had embezzled more than 9,800 yuan of public funds and absconded to Shanghai, hiding in Room 78 of the Dadong Hotel in the Yong'an Company on Nanjing Road in the Public Concession. He was requested to secretly dispatch officers, together with the police, to arrest Wang and then escort him back to the case for interrogation. After receiving the telegram, Director Chen immediately handed it to Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team, for proper handling. Subsequently, in the afternoon, squad leader Qi Haitian of the detective team, along with detectives Han Jingxiang and Lu Ruicheng, first secretly investigated the Dadong Hotel. However, there was no one named Wang in Room 78. They checked directly to Room 84, where Wang Shao-yi was indeed registered. Squad leader Qi immediately contacted the old Zha Gate police and Western detectives to arrest Wang and temporarily detain him at the police station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, Wang confessed that he was 40 years old and from Guizhou. Squad leader Qi reported back to the captain and then to the director, who approved the preparation of documents for extradition today, pending the arrival of documents from the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance for disposal.</p>

<p>Total Value of Over 3.97 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau, considering that countries around the world have meticulous statistics and detailed reports on the annual harvest of agricultural production for the public to explore, formulated a harvest survey form for major autumn crops last year for a practical survey.

The rice harvest was 331,221 dan, valued at approximately 1,531,570 yuan. The bean harvest was 42,072 dan, valued at approximately 222,091 yuan. The total value was 3,978,282 yuan. However, the Yinxiang and Yangjing districts are not included, as these two districts are adjacent to the city and have less agricultural land. Therefore, they are omitted. It is further clarified that the entire areas of South Shanghai and Zhabei are market areas.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department appointed Mr. He Deqiu as the co-director of the bureau, it is rumored that the Japanese side is also requesting the addition of a Japanese co-director.

However, it has not yet been discussed among the representatives whether there is a need to make a request at present. Chairman Lin of the various business associations has not mentioned this matter. Therefore, it is not yet possible to determine whether the request will be implemented in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Committee of All Circles Against Atrocities by American Sailors <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Proposal for the Seventh Municipal Representative Congress</p>
<p>The Shanghai Committee of All Circles Against Atrocities by American Sailors, with the opening of the Seventh Municipal Representative Congress of this city imminent, has drafted a proposal and will submit it for discussion when the Representative Congress opens. The original text of the proposal is transcribed below, urging a resolution due to the barbaric acts of American soldiers and the harming of our compatriots. This resolution should be forwarded to the central government, requesting the National Government to lodge a serious protest and adhere to the resolution of the National Assembly to automatically recover the concessions and extraterritorial rights to prevent future troubles. Is this appropriate? We respectfully await your decision.</p>
<p>Reasons: Since the last two months, American sailors stationed in Shanghai have arbitrarily violated the lives of our compatriots. One instance is the shooting of Gu Jingen; the second is the stabbing of Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang; the third is the case of a fall from a pavilion in Daidai, resulting in death; and the fourth is the case of American sailors stabbing four people at Qichang Zhan in Pudong. Such illegal and reckless behavior has led to repeated tragic incidents, proving that foreigners in our country rely on the concessions and consular jurisdiction as a protective shield, acting without any regard. Therefore, it is requested that the Congress promptly resolve to forward this to the central government, urging the National Government to lodge a serious protest with the US government, demanding punishment of the perpetrators, apologies, and compensation for losses. As for the matter of concessions and extraterritorial rights, this is a confirmed policy of the Party's rule, which should be implemented as soon as possible to achieve a fundamental solution.</p>

<p>Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association Telegraphs Province to Vindicate Him</p>
<p>Zhenhai County Magistrate Cao Boquan was recently impeached by Shao Hongji, a supervisory committee member of the Supervisory Yuan, based on an accusation by Ding Qinghua and others, representatives of the villagers of Lingyan Village in Zhenhai, alleging that local bullies extorted money, judges neglected their duties, and the county magistrate was negligent. The National Government telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government, ordering the suspension of County Magistrate Cao Boquan, the trial judge Hu Jiajun, and the village chief Li Jinglian, pending investigation and punishment. The Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, based on a telegram from Lou Qiliang and other gentry and merchants in Zhenhai requesting vindication, sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday.</p>
<p>The telegram reads: "To Chairman Zhang and all members of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: We have received a joint telegram from Lou Qiliang, Chen Tingjun, Liu Xinyin, and others from Zhenhai, stating that they were shocked to read in the newspaper that County Magistrate Cao Boquan had been ordered to suspend his duties. They found County Magistrate Cao to be honest, fair, diligent, and possessing a revolutionary spirit that is widely praised. This sudden suspension, due to being implicated in a case involving the former trial judge Hu, not only subjects County Magistrate Cao to an unjust grievance but also brings misfortune to our county's politics. Therefore, we jointly telegraph, requesting your esteemed council to uphold justice, vindicate County Magistrate Cao's grievance, and protect this virtuous magistrate for the people of our county. We implore you to immediately telegraph the Provincial Government, requesting the reinstatement of County Magistrate Cao to appease public opinion." The telegram further states that the gentlemen named are all fair and upright gentry, sufficient to represent the majority of public opinion. Based on the above, we urgently telegraph your government for consideration, earnestly requesting your kind understanding and prior reinstatement to appease public opinion.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Yu Hede, Chairman of the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, and all committee members.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Fire at Nan Yu Tai <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Nan Yu Tai Sugar and Food Store, located at No. 173 inside the Guoma Road, 16 Pu, Nanshi, has been established for many years. The store is a two-story, double-entry building. Besides being used as a storefront and warehouse, the northern part of the upper floor is where the store owner's family resides. Yesterday at around 4:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the rear storage room, filled with grass goods. In an instant, smoke filled the air, and the fire broke through the roof. When the Firefighting Joint Association heard about it, it rang the alarm. Soon, firefighting associations from various districts dispatched pump trucks to the scene to draw water and extinguish the fire. It took about an hour for the fire to be extinguished.</p>
<p>During this incident, all four buildings of the store were completely destroyed by the fire. Fortunately, the store's staff and warehouse staff noticed the fire early and rushed to escape. Among them, one group jumped down from the veranda. In the chaos, they were careless and fell from a height, injuring their legs. The owner and his family were startled from their dreams and found that the staircase had already been burned. They climbed onto the roof of the neighboring house via a clothes-drying rack and were able to escape. Afterwards, Liu Xuezhou, a guard from the 10th Post of the area, took Xu Dafu, a Ningbo native working at the store, back to the First District Headquarters of the camp. During the preliminary interrogation, Xu stated that he did not know the cause of the fire. However, the loss to the store was estimated to be over 10,000 taels of silver. As the incident concerned a fire, it was ordered that an official document be prepared and submitted to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Over Four Thousand Attendees Yesterday</p>
<p>Water Change Tomorrow, Closed for One Day</p>
<p>The Hongkou open-air swimming pool is established by the Public Works Department. The pool area is 100 yards long and 30 yards wide, accommodating over a thousand people. It opened last month. Anyone, regardless of age, without contagious diseases, can enter and swim for two dimes. Shanghai residents, lacking swimming venues, flock there daily during this hot weather, often reaching over a thousand people. Yesterday was Sunday, and the weather was very hot, so the number of attendees reached over four thousand. The pool's manager, seeing that the pool could not accommodate everyone, posted a "Full" sign and locked the main gate, opening a side door for swimmers leaving. By 2:00 PM, it was closed, and within ten minutes, five to six hundred people were waiting outside the gate. There were three attempts to squeeze into the side door, almost leading to verbal altercations with the manager. Fortunately, most of the swimmers were athletes from commercial and academic circles, possessing high character, so nothing untoward happened. When the bell rang four times, the number of swimmers in the pool gradually decreased, and the main gate was opened to allow latecomers to enter. The pool water is tested daily by the Department of Health. If the water contains toxic substances or is turbid, it will be changed. Tomorrow is the day for water change, so swimming enthusiasts need not make the trip.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Sensational Murder Case in Western Shanghai Solved <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Old Widow Has Two Lovers</p>
<p>Zhao Qilang Kills Rival in Jealousy</p>
<p>Kong Chengrong Died Terribly</p>
<p>Widow Claims to Be Pregnant</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th of this month, an unidentified male corpse, assassinated and suffering four knife wounds, with his genitals cut off, was discovered in a deserted area near the Lime Kiln north of Xiaoshadu Creek in Western Shanghai (details already reported in this newspaper). After the incident occurred, society took notice, and it created a sensation for a time. Later, the deceased's brother, Kong A'er, applied to the District Court, identifying the deceased as his younger brother, Kong Chengrong. He was granted permission to collect the coffin and bury the body. Now, District Chief Ren of the Sixth District has strictly ordered all detectives to tighten their efforts to arrest the perpetrators. The murderer, the adulterous woman, and those involved have all been apprehended, and the truth has come to light, confirming that the incident was caused by a love triangle, leading to such a tragic and bizarre event. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>District Chief Ren Strictly Orders Arrest of Perpetrators</p>
<p>After the incident occurred, it created a sensation in society. District Chief Ren believed that the murderer's cruel methods were truly detrimental to social morality. Based on the initial investigation, the trail of blood led from behind the Fuxin Third Factory all the way to the Lime Kiln. Although it could be determined that the murder site was behind the factory (which is within the Fourth District's jurisdiction), the discovery site was within his jurisdiction. Therefore, he strictly ordered all detectives to tighten their efforts to arrest the perpetrators and severely punish them as a warning to the unruly.</p>
<p>Insight Obtained, Truth Revealed</p>
<p>Liu Shaoqing, the head of the district's detective team, and detectives Cao Chuqiao, Gan Xixin, Tang Bingxiang, Sun Rongxuan, and Hu Rui, after receiving orders, began investigating. Later, thanks to Cao Chuqiao's tireless research, they received a report from an informant, claiming that the case involved Zhao Du Shi, a widow living at No. 3, Nian'an Lane, Sheng'an Li, Maojia Lane, Nanshi. She was initially in love with Zhao Qilang. However, recently, the woman abandoned her old love and became acquainted with the deceased, Kong Chengrong. Therefore, Zhao held hatred in his heart and killed Kong. The informant also stated that Zhao was hiding at the Yuqing shop in the Haichao Temple. Only then did Detective Cao learn the details. Suddenly, they heard that the police station of the First District had already arrested Zhao Cailang, who is Zhao Qilang's brother. The detective team then requested the Third Branch of the First District to dispatch police officers to accompany them to the upstairs of the Yuqing tobacco and paper shop on the afternoon of the previous day. They apprehended Zhao Qilang on the spot and took him back to the Sixth District headquarters for temporary detention. Yesterday morning, the original team of detectives went to No. 143, Sanpailou Road, in the city and apprehended the adulterous woman, Zhao Du Shi, and her son, Zhao Jinrong, as well. They then went to Sheng'an Li and brought back Zhu Lao'er and Zhu Ye Shi, who lived with the woman, for questioning.</p>
<p>Old Widow Reveals the Truth</p>
<p>After separate interrogations by District Chief Ren, the widow stated that her surname was Wang, named Ye Shi (real surname Zhao Du Shi), 40 years old, from Changzhou. She currently resides at No. 23, Sheng'an Li, Maojia Lane. Her husband passed away two years ago. She is a second wife. Her husband had a son named Jinrong from his previous wife, who had not borne any children. She has a cohabitant, Zhu Lao'er, from Haimen. In the first month of the lunar calendar, Zhao Qilang, a fellow villager, suddenly started visiting her home. From then on, they became acquainted, and before long, she was seduced into an affair. On the night of the 20th of the first month, she had intercourse with Zhao once. Afterwards, he stayed at her place several times. On the afternoon of the 16th of the second month, Zhao borrowed ten yuan from her, falsely claiming that he wanted to make a robe. On the afternoon of the 16th of the third month, Zhao came to her house again and forced her to have intercourse. Because it was a Sunday, her son had to return home, and it was in broad daylight, she refused and went to the living room. He then lay alone on her bed. Shortly after, her son returned home, entered the room, and saw someone on her bed. He became furious and asked who it was. She replied that she didn't know. Her son then drove him out, and Zhao also claimed that he would never come again, which led to his release. Later, she fell in love with Kong Chengrong (the deceased, and Zhao were also acquainted), who lived with her, and had intercourse with Kong on the 16th of the fourth month. On the night of the 27th of the fourth month, Kong was talking at her house when Zhao Qilang barged in. She locked the door and sternly rejected him. On the afternoon of the 29th, she went to Kong Chengrong's house in Xiaonanmen and saw Kong and Zhao leaving together. She then returned home. Later, not seeing Kong, she found Zhao on the 2nd of the fifth month and asked where Kong was. At first, he said he didn't know, then he claimed he was sick in the hospital. She repeatedly questioned him, and Zhao suddenly became angry and said that if she asked again, he would kill her too! (This statement is ironclad proof that he is the murderer). Hearing this, she realized the danger and had to return home. Later, she heard about the case in the newspaper, so she became very anxious and hid at A Gen's house on Sanpailou Road. Her son, Zhao Jinrong, 29 years old, originally from Pudong, works in printing. His father is deceased. Du Shi is his stepmother. He returns home once a week. On Sunday, the 23rd of the fourth month, he returned home and saw Zhao Qilang lying on his mother's bed. He slapped him once. Later, because he swore never to come again, he let him go. Later, he learned that his mother had an affair with Kong Chengrong. He was about to investigate when he read in the newspaper that Kong had been killed. He knew that Zhao must have been jealous and resorted to this tactic. He then wrote a letter to the Third Branch of the First District, stating that the Xiaoshadu murder case was committed by Zhao Qilang, signed with the pseudonym Leng. The murderer, Zhao Qilang, 36 years old, from Haimen, who lives at the Yuqing shop in the Haichao Temple and works as a cook, denied the murder and evaded the question. Zhu Lao'er and his wife, Ye Shi, gave testimonies consistent with the adulterous woman's statements, proving that Kong must have been killed by Zhao. After obtaining these testimonies, District Chief Ren believed that the case was clear, and the murderer could not deny it. He decided to prepare a document and hand him over to the Public Security Bureau today for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Shanghai Has Been Extremely Hot for Days <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has been extremely hot for the past few days, with the temperature on the Fahrenheit thermometer rising to around 96 degrees. Yesterday was especially bad. From the morning, there was no breeze, making it exceptionally stuffy. Hawkers carrying goods and rickshaw pullers on the roads complained incessantly. However, those selling steam water, ice cream, and other cold items saw their profits triple. Watermelons were also available for sale (Guangdong goods), selling for 17 yuan per load. In the evenings, people cooling off on the roads were everywhere. Poor people, unable to sleep comfortably indoors due to the stifling heat, slept outdoors on balconies, at doorways, or on sidewalks.</p>

<p>Jadeite Parcel Lost by Postal Bureau</p>
<p>Demands Compensation of 2,400 Yuan</p>
<p>In the winter of 1927, Hua Zhen Company entrusted a jadeite parcel worth 2,400 yuan to the General Post Office for registration and sent it to New York, USA. However, it was delayed by postal officials and not sent, causing the recipient to wait for a long time without news. They telegraphed Hua Zhen for inquiries. When Hua Zhen investigated with the post office, the parcel could not be found. They demanded compensation at the price of the goods, but the post office refused. After repeated negotiations, the bureau only agreed to compensate ten francs based on Article 332 of the postal regulations. Hua Zhen felt that this was too much of a loss and refused to accept it. The post office then instructed them to wait for a report to the Ministry of Communications for review. More than three years have passed since then. Hua Zhen does not know whether it was reported to the ministry and can no longer wait. Therefore, they hired lawyer Qian Baohe to sue the Special District Court, requesting the Postal Bureau to compensate for the goods worth 2,400 yuan and the customs duties and postal taxes of 325 yuan paid for the parcel. Yesterday, Judge Yang of the Special Court summoned them for questioning. The post office hired lawyers Wang Zijian and Li Zuyu to defend and presented the postal regulations of China and the United States to counter the plaintiff's demands. Judge Yang believed that the case still needed investigation and adjourned it for further questioning.</p>

<p>Why Travel Around the Country?</p>
<p>The China Border Development Preparation Committee invited the national traveler Tian Shulan to lecture at No. 206, Wenyuan Fang, Aiyu Xian Road, Jinshenfu Road, at 11:00 AM yesterday on the topic of "Why I Want to Travel Around the Country." The association's chairman, Wang Yang, first reported on the organization's situation, followed by Tian's speech. He stated that he had aspired to travel the world since childhood. Whenever teachers spoke about the rich resources of Northeast China and Mongolia, he would discuss solutions with two or three classmates. Time flies, and now he can finally fulfill his long-cherished wish. The purpose of this trip around the country is sixfold: (1) To broaden his horizons by not fearing difficulties and venturing into barren lands. (2) To record facts and clarify the truth to provide reference for the world. (3) To harmonize ethnic groups to achieve the ideal of a great united world. (4) To practice enduring hardship and struggle. If the environment allows, further exploration should be undertaken. (5) This trip around the country is expected to last six years. If successful, he will return to Shanghai and plan a more ambitious trip around the world, which will take twice as long. If he has the ability, he will organize an expedition team to explore the North and South Poles and the peaks of the Himalayas. (6) The study of worldly affairs is endless. Today's new knowledge is tomorrow's historical data. He is determined to pursue his goals with unwavering perseverance and will not stop until he has thoroughly examined the geography and human conditions. This departure is either success or sacrifice. Tian's words were passionate and inspiring, moving the audience. Finally, guests Zhou Xiuquan and Zhao Shouyu offered words of encouragement, which were mostly pertinent. The event ended at 1:00 PM. It is said that Tian plans to depart from Shanghai at noon on July 1st.</p>

<p>Two Boatmen Drown</p>
<p>Four Passengers Abducted</p>
<p>The flour boat Liu Baokui loaded 800 bags of flour in Shanghai and sailed to outside Wusongkou to unload cargo onto a foreign ship. In the afternoon of the previous day, at low tide, they started to sail. However, because the cargo carried by the ship had not been completely unloaded, Liu's boat was anchored beside the ship waiting to unload. Suddenly, yesterday morning, as dawn approached, a strong storm struck. For safety, Liu sailed to the shore to anchor and avoid the danger. At noon, Liu saw that the ship's cargo had been unloaded and immediately sailed closer to unload the cargo. While turning the boat, a strong gust of wind caused the entire boat to capsize. Liu and four boatmen fell into the water together. Fortunately, a small tugboat carrying passengers arrived and tried its best to rescue them. However, due to the strong wind and waves, rescue was difficult. Only three boatmen were rescued. Liu and another boatman were swept eastward and could not be rescued, presumably drowning. The entire cargo of flour sank to the bottom of the sea. Only the hull of the boat remained, drifting on the surface of the water. The boatmen hired a boat to search for Liu and the other boatman's bodies and reported to the cargo owner. By noon yesterday, a boat found Liu's body in Gaoqiao. The other boatman's body has not been found yet. The Life Saving Bureau has been notified to dispatch patrol boats to search for it.</p>

<p>Due to the hot weather in Shanghai in recent days, the waterfronts of the Huangpu River in Nanshi and the Suzhou Creek in northern Shanghai are often seen with children and adults swimming naked from the shore or floating bridges, chasing and splashing each other, in a state of great joy, as the sun sets. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team believes that such swimming is not only unhygienic but also dangerous for their personal lives. Therefore, Chief Xu of the team has ordered all subordinate teams to inform their officers to strictly prohibit it.</p>

<p>Boat Owner and Son Swim to Safety</p>
<p>Four Passengers Abducted</p>
<p>Rice boat owner Zhu Xinmao loaded over a hundred stones of white rice in Changshu, intending to transport it to Waisha, Chongming, for sale. He also carried four passengers. At around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the previous day, while sailing past Lao Hong Port outside of Songkou, they temporarily docked by the port due to unfavorable winds and tides. Before long, four or five pirate ships suddenly sailed towards them. Seeing this, the rice boat tried to raise anchor and escape, but the pirate ships had already approached and surrounded them. The pirates swarmed onto the rice boat, first emptying it of the rice it was carrying. Then, failing to find any silver, they forcibly took Zhu Xinmao, his son, and the four passengers onto the pirate ships. Seeing this, Zhu Xinmao and his son were terrified and took advantage of the pirates' inattention to jump into the port and swim to shore. Although the pirates fired shots into the water, they fortunately did not hit them, and they escaped unharmed. The pirates were furious and destroyed the rice boat, abandoning it in the port. They abducted the four passengers and fled. The rice boat has now floated to Qiyaokou. Yesterday, the local water police found and seized it. However, there is still no news of the abducted four passengers.</p>

<p>The Work-Study Center for Vagrants in Caohejing, Western Shanghai, was initiated by philanthropists such as Mr. Wang Yiting in Shanghai and opened in June of the 18th year of the Republic of China. To date, it has been two years, and there have been over six hundred vagrants and beggars sent from various places, almost reaching full capacity. The director of the center, Mr. Wu Zhinan, is thrifty, simple, deeply knowledgeable, and meticulous in his planning, putting in a great deal of effort. Yesterday afternoon, Ye Bingheng from the Wuzhou Gu Ben Soap Factory in Xujiahui, Chen Xiaomei from the Ninth District Party Department, Liu Yunfang, the director of the Second Branch of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Zhou Chengxiang, the captain of the Tenth Team of the South Shanghai District Guard, visited the center. Director Wu warmly welcomed them. The center is divided into three departments: document management and work, and nine sections: teaching, diagnosis, barbering, hygiene, security, inspection, visitation, discipline, and training. He then led them to inspect the east and west dormitories and the one, two, three, and four workshops. There are sewing, shoemaking, woodworking, straw work, metalworking, hat-making, box-pasting, and machine weaving sections. There is also a Jingxin Hall, where vagrants who are fierce and unruly and do not listen to instruction reside. Finally, there is a large lecture hall that can accommodate a thousand seats. Then, Director Wu rang the bell to gather all the vagrants and invited Mr. Ye and others to give speeches (the content of the speeches is omitted). The words were sincere and touching, moving the audience. Everyone left until six o'clock.</p>

Because the crowd became too crowded, they charged three copper coins per person, and in the afternoon, they raised the price to five copper coins per person.</p>

<p>Wang Zhijing, the District Chief of the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in light of the increasing number of robbery and kidnapping cases in the Chinese and Concession areas in recent years, paid special attention to local security. He ordered Cao Junda, the leader of the detective team stationed in the district, to intensify the crackdown. After receiving the order, Cao led the detectives to intensify patrols and gather information. At around 11:00 PM on the 23rd of this month, they received a report from an informant stating that several robbers were hiding on a boat moored at the Lannid渡碼頭 pier. Cao Junda, the team leader, led detectives Chen Chunsheng, Wang Shuangxi, and Wang Tinggen to the area with the beat police. As they were about to board the boat to arrest them, a robber named Qiu Chengyu and a suspect named Shen Chang'an were taken to the district headquarters for questioning. They stated that there were still accomplices hiding at No. 11, Xiao Yanjiaqiao, Pudong. The next day, the detectives took the suspects to the aforementioned address and found the robbers who had escaped into the Huangpu River yesterday inside, just about to have lunch. They immediately arrested them and took them to the district headquarters. District Chief Wang interrogated them strictly. They confessed that they were named Wang Da and had robbed Shen Rongzhao's house at No. 16, Xiao Yanjiaqiao, on the 18th of this month, stealing leather clothing, ornaments, silver dollars, etc. Qiu Chengyu admitted to going to the robbery with him. After questioning, District Chief Wang, as the matter concerned robbery, prepared a document and dispatched police officers to submit it to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Previous Counter-Suit Still Pending</p>
<p>Court Rules Case Should Not Be Heard</p>
<p>Yao Zhang Shi, the wife of the late actor Yao Junqing, and her daughter, Yao Shunxi, were previously sued by Li Xiuru, the female head of the Tianjin Modern Times, for allegedly luring Ren Shuzhen, her husband's concubine, and Chen Yindi, a fourteen-year-old girl, to sell themselves at the Xianrou Zhuang (a secret brothel) at No. 1, Linbi Fang, Changbin Road. After repeated court hearings by the Special District Court, the court ruled that the charges were unsubstantiated and rejected them. Yao's wife and daughter then sued Li and Chen for fabricating facts and filing a false accusation. The complaint stated that when the defendants rented the remaining rooms from the plaintiffs several years ago, Li Xiuru's husband, Kong Ren, was of a licentious nature and lusted after beauty. At that time, he already had one wife and two concubines, but he still hoped to take Shunxi as a concubine. After his second concubine, Ren Shuzhen, ran away due to unbearable abuse, he became even more brazen in flirting with Shunxi. The plaintiffs reprimanded him to his face, and he then moved away. Chen Yindi was also forced to move due to overdue rent. Unexpectedly, Li Xiuru invited Chen Yindi and hired lawyer Ye Feikang to file a lawsuit. Fortunately, the court was insightful and they were not陷害 harmed. However, the defendants publicly insulted them and should be held responsible. Please impose appropriate punishment according to Articles 180 and 325, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. The case was heard by Judge Ge of the Special Court on the afternoon of the previous day. Both defendants avoided appearing in court. According to the plaintiffs' lawyer, Fan Qisheng, when Li Xiuru and others sued the plaintiffs in this case, they immediately filed a countersuit. Later, Li's suit was rejected by Judge Wu, and the court orally announced that a separate lawsuit would be filed regarding the countersuit. Therefore, the plaintiffs followed the court's instructions and filed this lawsuit. Judge Ge ruled that a countersuit had already been filed and had not been adjudicated. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, a case that has already been filed in the same court should not be heard. The circumstances of this case are consistent, and the court ruled that the case would not be accepted.</p>

On their way home, while passing the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Xinxin Bridge, she was struck and killed by a No. 1142 cargo truck driven by chauffeur Guo Yuchun, who was speeding along. The incident was reported to Judge Zhu, who confirmed the facts of the case and ordered further investigation. The other day, the police summoned all parties involved to the French Concession Court for questioning. First, the head of the traffic department reported the background of the case. Then, Mr. D.V. Tappert, the lawyer representing the deceased's family, stated that the police investigation revealed that the defendant's car had faulty brakes, making it impossible to stop in time, leading to this tragic accident. In addition to requesting further investigation, regarding the private suit, the plaintiff stated that a total of over seven thousand yuan had been spent on his daughter from birth until now, and that the plaintiff couple had suffered immense emotional distress since their daughter's death. Therefore, they requested compensation of ten thousand yuan for their losses. The defendant, Guo Yuchun, testified that the girl had suddenly darted out from a side road, making it impossible for him to brake in time, causing the accident. His remaining testimony was evasive. The Chinese and Western judges ordered him to step down and await the judgment.</p>

<p>The Tobacco Exchange Guild Petitions for Remedial Measures</p>
<p>Yao Jiaqi, Director of the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, strictly inspected cigar and white cigarette sales in foreign concession tobacco shops. Many shops were found to be in violation, and letters were sent to the Tobacco Exchange Guild requesting assistance. The Guild's chairman, Chen Liangyu, Shen Weiting, and Dong Keliang, went to the Unified Tax Bureau to petition. The director agreed to negotiate and outlined the following remedial measures: (1) All existing plain cigars must be affixed with supplementary tax stamps to avoid penalties. (2) The number of stamps to be supplemented should be registered with the Guild, who would then obtain and affix the stamps. The stamps obtained cannot be of a lower grade than the tobacco they are affixed to. If any trickery is found, penalties will still be imposed. (3) The stamps will be obtained by the Guild and distributed to each shop for self-affixing. After affixing, they will be submitted to the Guild, where tax bureau officials will be dispatched to stamp them. (4) The tax grades are divided into six levels: (A) 1,000 cigars priced at 72 yuan 2 jiao or more are affixed with 45 yuan. (B) 1,000 cigars priced at 35 yuan 1 jiao or more are affixed with 22 yuan 5 jiao. (C) 1,000 cigars priced at 17 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen or more are affixed with 11 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen. (D) 1,000 cigars priced at 8 yuan 7 jiao 7 fen 5 li or more are affixed with 5 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen. (E) 1,000 cigars priced at 5 yuan 2 jiao 6 fen 5 li or more are affixed with 3 yuan. (F) 1,000 cigars priced at less than 5 yuan 2 jiao 6 fen 5 li are affixed with 2 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen. For quantities from 25 to 200 cigars, calculate proportionally.</p>

<p>The Jinting Guild Hall on Daxing Street, Xiaoximen, in this city, is a charitable organization of Xishan sojourners from Dongting in Shanghai. Outside the hall, there are over thirty old market houses and eight old bungalows, which have been in disrepair for years and are in danger of collapse. Therefore, the temporary executive committee of the guild hall decided to rebuild them and prepared a proposal and detailed architectural drawings. Luo Huanzhang, in his name, sent a letter to the custodians of the guild hall's land deed, the owners of Senji Yi, Jinyuan Mao, and Tongyuan Heng, requesting the land deed in order to mortgage it for funds to rebuild the market houses. Senji and others, due to the importance of the entrustment by the fellow villagers and the matter concerning the public, did not dare to hand over the deed without authorization and specially published a notice to solicit the opinions of the fellow villagers. An investigation revealed that the number of Xishan sojourners in Shanghai is close to two thousand, most of whom are in favor of the rebuilding, but oppose the proposal of the temporary executive committee. This is because after the implementation of the proposal, the rent collected in the future will only be enough to pay interest, and the principal will be repaid indefinitely. The guild hall's land will inevitably belong to those who advance the funds. Therefore, people are gathering to discuss a perfect plan. Half of the members of the temporary executive committee also expressed their sympathy. It is said that it has been decided to convene a meeting of all fellow villagers to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>The British firm McBain &amp; Co., located at No. 1 The Bund, established the Lange Lumber Mill seven years ago at No. 1489 Huade Road, east of Gaolang Bridge, using machinery to specially cut various applicable wood. Business was booming and large. As the materials produced could not meet the demand, a second factory was built next to the main factory, and a third factory was added opposite the main factory at the south end of Xiaobang. At 9:15 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the sawing room of the third factory, quickly spreading and becoming unapproachable. Although fire brigades from Yangshupu and Central Xinzha rushed to put out the fire, everything on fire was wood, making it difficult to extinguish. It was not extinguished until 11:30 PM, lasting for more than two hours. Except for a small amount of material near the bank at the front, which was spared, the remaining machinery and wood were all burned to ashes. It is said that the loss has not yet been determined, but it is estimated to be over hundreds of thousands of yuan.</p>

Mayor Zhang Qun's eulogy of "Sincerity Opens Jinshi" was a clever pun on the place name and attracted much attention. Although it was the height of summer, many people came from afar to offer condolences, which can be said to have been the utmost in honor.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association recently received reports from Tianjin, Beiping, and other places from Director She J桂sheng, Zhou Jingfu, stating that in the disaster areas of the northern provinces, such as Rehe and Chaoyang, the summer season has arrived, and epidemics are occurring everywhere. There are few good doctors in the countryside, and there are no good pharmacies. When disaster victims contract diseases, they often sit and wait for death. In addition, refugees from Henan who are crossing the border must carry medicine to prevent epidemics when passing through stations such as Pingjin. The Jisheng Dan 20,000 bottles and Baoan Dan 1,000 boxes sent by your association were all very effective and could bring people back to life. However, the disaster area is too large, and the distribution is insufficient. They have been used up recently, and we still ask for an increase in aid. The association's Tongzhou ship sent another 10,000 bottles of Jisheng Dan and the Taishun ship sent 20,000 bottles of Ten Drops of Water. Now that we have received letters, the supply is still insufficient for distribution, and we plan to send another 20,000 bottles of Jisheng Dan within a few days to meet urgent needs. The association's medicine is effective and precious. The two provinces of Beiping and Rehe have sent a total of 70,000 bottles of Jisheng Dan and Ten Drops of Water, and the cost is not small. If charitable people from all walks of life can help with medicine funds to produce more aid, disaster victims will be able to live long lives, and the virtue and blessings created will be immeasurable.</p>

<p>A Plunge of One Hundred and Ten Taels in a Single Week</p>
<p>Hit by the Declaration of Deferring War Debts</p>
<p>Major Players Dumped Stocks Uncontrollably; the Unprecedented and Severe Fluctuations in Last Week's Bullion Market Intensified into a Fierce Downturn, Seemingly Beyond Control.</p>
<p>This was Truly Caused by the Declaration of U.S. President Hoover's Proposal to Suspend War Debt Payments for One Year. It was Like a Bolt from the Blue, Triggering Terror in the Market, Stirring Up Panic, and Leaving People Helpless. Furthermore, Stock Prices on Various New York Exchanges Soared, and Overseas Silver Prices Skyrocketed. Large Bars Increased by More Than One Penny, and Silver Prices Jumped by More Than Two Cents.

Tracing Back to the Closing Price of 800 Taels and 0.006 Mace the Previous Weekend, It Was Calculated That in Just One Week, There Was a Sharp Drop of More Than 110 Taels, Which Was Truly Unimaginable. However, the Fluctuations During That Period Were Extremely Turbulent, With Swings of Ten to Twenty Taels Being Common. It Almost Felt Like Mountains Were Collapsing and Seas Were Sinking. It is Said That the Changes in Major Long and Short Positions Have Been Mutually Changing Recently. It Is Suspected That the Previous Swap Deals, as Well as the Speculation by Cantonese Banking Group Heng Xing and Others, Involved Taking Long Positions in July and Short Positions in August.

<p>Spot Goods Also Small Three or Four Taels</p>
<p>Three Products Rose Alone More Than Ten Yuan</p>
<p>At the Beginning of Last Week, the Situation of Cotton Yarn Was Firm and the Rising Wind Was Sharp. The Sales of Spot Yarn Were Enthusiastic, and the Intention of Various Groups Was Very Excited. Moreover, 16s and 20s Spot Yarn Had Been Exhausted by Various Groups in the Previous Week. The Bottom Stocks of Various Factories Had Long Been Emptied. The Tianjin Group, in View of the Shortage of Spot Goods, Changed to Purchasing July and August Futures. People's Hearts Were Excited, the Situation Was Tense, and the Atmosphere on the Market Was Especially Strong. Unexpectedly, After the U.S. President Announced the Deferral of War Debt Payments for One Year, the Bullion Plummeted by a Huge 70 Taels in One Day. The Hot Rising Wind of the Yarn Market Suffered a Heavy Blow. At the Same Time, the Selling Momentum Suddenly Became Strong, and Major Short Positions Added More Codes. The Tabletop Suddenly Loosened, and the Situation Changed Suddenly. There Were Rumors in the Market That a Large Long Position Turned to Empty. It Originated From the Fact That the Opening Price of August at the Beginning of the Week Had Seen a Maximum of 169 Taels and 2 Qian. After Suffering Various Blows, the Market Disc Collapsed and Fell for Six Consecutive Days. On Saturday, the Minimum of August Reached 161 Taels, a Difference of Eight Taels and Two Qian. The Speed of the Change Was Shocking. Although the Price of Gold Fell, Overseas Prices Skyrocketed, and the Calculation of the Silver Disc Was Not Cheap. However, the Local Environment Was Poor, and Various Airs Were Conducive to the Short Side. Moreover, Most Tended to Throw Short, How Could the Market Support It. The Spot Yarn Business Was Exceptionally Dull on the Weekend. Although Various Groups Had a Volume of Handling, They Were Hesitant to Move Forward Because the Situation of the Period Yarn Was Unstable. It Was Found That the Statistics of Various Groups Buying Showed 6,630 Packages. The Trading Company Entered 3,850 Packages. Shinren and Zhong Yarn Were Shipped to Japan, One After Another. The Spot Yarn Market Also Fell by Three or Four Taels. Standard Yarn Was Still Firm at the Beginning of the Week. Later, Due to the Increase of Short Positions and the Settlement of Long Positions, the Market Disc Suddenly Turned Downward and the Falling Wind Was Great. The Yarn Market Was Currently Affected by Exchange Rates, and the Gold Market Was Shaky. Although the Future Was Still Solid, the Price of Bullion Was Down by 5.6 Taels Compared to the Previous Week. The Transaction Statistics Were 298,800 Packages. Three Products Yarn Rose by More Than 10 Yuan Compared to the Previous Week.

<p>Last Week's Cotton Market, Hit by the Gold Price, Had a Strong Falling Wind.

Although the Source Was Lacking and the Bottom Stock Was Weak, Hong Exchange Rate Changed, and There Was Hope for the Smooth Entry of Foreign Cotton in the Future. So Speculators Swarmed and the Situation Was Fierce. The Buyer Was Difficult to Support for a While, and the Spot Cotton Needs of Various Factories Were Silent, So the Market Disc Was Tired. Each Month Fell by One Liang and Five or Six Qian Compared to the Previous Week. The Weekend Slightly Rebounded. Although Overseas Silver Prices Rose, Prices Also Rose.

<p>Could Prevent Airplane Fires</p>
<p>London News: Mr. Bartel, the technical director of the French Aviation Association, and Mr. Foley, the secretary, have jointly invented a safe gasoline called "Red Oil." When used in airplanes, it can prevent fires. The two first traveled between Bourget, France, and Croydon, England, six times for secret experiments, which lasted two months. Recently, the experiments were supervised separately by the French and British authorities in the two locations, and the results were confirmed to be successful. This non-combustible "Red Oil" is extracted from crude oil to obtain white spirits, which are then subjected to special treatment. It is said that its power is no different from ordinary gasoline. During the experiment, a red-hot iron rod burned in a furnace was immersed in the oil, but the oil did not catch fire, as if it were water, which amazed the observers.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Discussing Plans to Increase National Poultry Breed Improvement by 280 Million <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaotai</p>
<p>The fundamental reason why Chinese society cannot be stable is economic bankruptcy. If we want to build China into a new country in the world, we must transform the rural economy. Recently, Mr. Zhang Ji of the Central Committee proposed that reviving China should prioritize agriculture and treat industry as secondary, which is indeed a wise opinion. However, we who live in cities, although we know that agriculture is important, few of us actually know the real situation in rural areas. Whenever we go to the countryside in any province, we see that nine out of ten households are poor and displaced. Such a tragic image of national demise is truly pitiful to the extreme. However, with such complex and numerous rural issues, it is not easy to know where to start to revive the rural areas so that more than 300 million hardworking, frugal, and innocent farmers can live in a peaceful world. Of course, it is not an easy task. However, we cannot stop our great ambitions because of the difficulties and give up due to minor setbacks. With the spirit of courage and determination, even if the road ahead is full of mountains, rivers, thorns, and brambles, we must do it with the power of our nation. Since Dr. James Yen, the executive director of the Mass Education Movement, advocated that education must be integrated with life, and Dr. Franklin H. Warner used the method of increasing production to organize a new rural Chinese economy as a comprehensive rural improvement plan, conducting experiments in the Dingxian experimental area, there has been considerable progress. For example, the improvement of pig breeds has indeed been trusted by farmers. All other improvements are made using scientific methods to improve agricultural products, which have made a great contribution. We cannot help but admire the far-sighted planning and spirit of sacrifice of Drs. Yen and Warner. Next is the chicken breed improvement that I want to talk about.</p>
<p>Chicken breed improvement is also one of the most important issues in Chinese rural areas. Because raising chickens is so common in China that almost no other country has it. Even the United States, which is called the world's number one chicken-raising country, cannot match the situation in China where every household raises chickens and everyone loves chickens. Of course, there are its special features and benefits, so farmers like to raise them. I will first talk about its importance to the national economy. Chinese people have basically never paid attention to raising chickens, so few people know about it. Every Chinese person knows that Chinese silk and tea are sold to countries all over the world, with huge annual exports, but they do not know that the products of chicken exports are second only to soybeans, silk, and furs. According to the customs report in 1928, egg exports were more than 43 million taels, which is 6 million more than tea exports. The export egg price offset the import of cigarettes, with a surplus of 10 million taels. As the fourth most important product in China, it is ignored by no one. It can be seen that our country does not know how to develop sources of profit, which makes the country poor and weak. It is a pity. This is in terms of international trade. If we talk about national farmhouse production, it will also surprise people as a huge number. According to Dr. Franklin H. Warner's investigation, there are 70,000 farm households in Dingxian. If each household raises an average of ten chickens, there are a total of 700,000 chickens. If each chicken of the improved breed can sell three yuan of eggs, the total annual sales will be 30 yuan. Calculated for the entire county, there is a total of 2.1 million yuan. China has approximately 2,000 counties, and taking the poor and small county of Dingxian as the standard, the national annual egg income is 420 million yuan. Such an alarming number of annual egg values is still sufficient for repaying foreign debt, and even more. Even if this year's Ministry of Finance's 20th annual foreign debt repayment is 70-80 million, the national construction budget is only 6 million, and the education expenditure is 20 million, totaling 100 million, which is only one-fortieth of the production of eggs alone. Therefore, it is said that China's poverty is not impossible to solve. It is because our people are indifferent and do not use scientific methods to improve it. Conversely, has China improved chicken breeds? Dare to say, no. Since it has not been improved, the income is certainly not that much. What is it actually? This research was conducted by Tsinghua University in Beijing, raising Chinese chickens and studying the number of eggs they lay. After three years of experiments, the result was that each chicken laid an average of only 50 eggs per year. If the market price at this time is one yuan per foreign egg, according to this number, each farmhouse is one-third of the above estimate. In other words, the total annual production is reduced by two-thirds. One year is a loss of 280 million yuan in income. If we look at this number, is it not the biggest loss to the country? However, can the production after improving the chicken breeds be sold? We also have to think, is there no way to sell the goods, wouldn't there be a danger of surplus? I will prove with examples that there is no need to worry about selling. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1931 forecast of China's cargo requirements published in the Da Gong Bao said, "The demand for eggs will also increase." Although the United States produces more eggs, 400 million dozen more than China annually, it still needs to buy from China. Not to mention other countries. If China produces high-quality products, there will definitely be a shortage of supply. Secondly, the Soviet Union used 1.2 million rubles to purchase 100,000 chicks from China, earning the country 4 million rubles in 1932. This news was published in the Tianjin Da Gong Bao on February 2 of this year. Based on this, China's chicken products will never be unsaleable. Furthermore, as the world's civilization advances, the need for eggs is increasing. The number of eggs consumed by each person each year in each country can be seen:</p>
<p>Canada 313</p>
<p>United States 180</p>
<p>France 133</p>
<p>Germany 117</p>
<p>United Kingdom 110</p>
<p>Denmark 75</p>
<p>Japan 37.5</p>
<p>(Recorded from the Japanese Showa 5th Year Poultry Magazine)</p>
<p>If we refer to this comparison table, we will know that the stronger and more civilized the country, the more it needs. Although we in China do not have this kind of statistics, we think, how much can the average wealthy person use in a year? I think it's very little. Farmers almost don't eat it. This is what I personally investigated. In the past few years, the Japanese Emperor saw that his people consumed too few eggs, and specifically ordered the people to eat eggs every day to nourish their bodies and become healthy people for the country. Therefore, the country promoted chicken raising and the Emperor personally visited various places to show encouragement. This is the forerunner of paying attention to national hygiene. In ancient times, Mencius said that raising chickens and good meat is the foundation of kingship, which is the same reason. If China wants to become a strong country in the world, it must pay attention to national hygiene. I think promoting eating more eggs is a necessary fact. So, why worry about egg surplus?</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, improving chicken breeds has a great relationship with people's livelihood and the nation. As for the method of improvement, it is to use the world's most productive egg-laying breed, Leghorn. In 1928, only this breed of chicken was distributed to various villages for improvement. The procedure for improvement is to mate one rooster with ten local hens, which is called pure hybrid mating. Secondly, purebred chickens are raised. Now, the advantages of improving chicken breeds are described below:</p>
<p>The improved chicken breeds in the picture above lay an average of 160 eggs per year, while domestic chickens lay only 50 eggs per year, a difference of three times.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Two improved Leghorn eggs are heavier than three Chinese eggs, which also increases production.</p>
<p>Improved chicken breeds and domestic chicken breeds are raised at the same time. Improved chicken breeds grow two pounds faster than domestic chickens.</p>
<p>Because of the above practical experimental comparison benefits, I went to various villages to give lectures to make farmers understand, which was very popular among farmers. The picture below shows the farmers listening to the lectures.</p>
<p>Since the lectures, farmers have been asking for improved chicken breeds every day. This is also the application of Dr. Yen's original quality of education, which makes them feel the automatic need, and the future implementation of improvement can be solved easily. Therefore, we first promote women in various villages because women manage household affairs and are the closest.</p>
<p>I have already talked about the facts of improving chicken breeds in Dingxian. Now, I will briefly describe my humble opinions on the national chicken breed improvement plan.</p>
<p>We observe the situation and needs of the countryside and know that chicken breed improvement is a necessary task for Chinese rural villages. However, to improve the national chicken breeds, there must be a corresponding plan and steps to achieve good results. However, in China's current economic situation, the plan must be within a possible range. First, it must require less funding and be successful quickly. Second, it must be in line with China's situation. According to my investigation in Dingxian, each county only needs 1,000 yuan, and after seven years, it can earn millions of yuan in income. I think no other business is as easy as this. However, many people doubt whether this Leghorn breed can live the same life as local chickens. The Leghorn chickens that we have promoted to various villages grow very strong and are even better than those raised in ordinary experimental farms because they are close to nature. Therefore, we have no worries at all. However, China has never had chicken breed improvement since the beginning of history, and no one studies poultry science, in particular. If a business has no scientific research, there is absolutely no hope of success. Therefore, if we want to improve chicken breeds, we must establish a national seed chicken farm, hire Chinese and foreign experts to study poultry science and promotion methods, and raise a large number of seed chickens to be distributed to various provinces. After the national seed chicken farm is established, the agricultural and mining departments of each province will send specialists to learn promotion methods and general poultry science. The specialist will return to his province and distribute a certain number of seed chickens from the seed chicken farm to farmers. At that time, the methods learned from the national seed chicken farm will be used to order the construction bureaus of each county to send personnel to the province to learn, and the seed chickens will be promoted to farmers in each county. In this way, the agricultural and mining departments and the construction bureaus are only responsible for promotion and organizing cooperatives, while academic research still falls under the responsibility of the national seed chicken farm. According to my plan, each county has 100 seed chickens, and after seven years, it can be popularized throughout the county.</p>
<p>Number of Chickens Promoted Annually in Each County</p>
<p>In the first year, 100 seed chickens are distributed to farmers. There is no need to set up a special experimental farm to save costs. In the spring of the following year, farmers are ordered to return 20 purebred chicken eggs per chicken each year for hatching. 20 eggs can get 5 chickens. The chickens obtained are used for promotion in the following year.</p>
<p>In the second year, 500 chickens are promoted (the method is the same as in the first year), calculated by multiplying 5 chickens per chicken in the first year.</p>
<p>In the third year, 2,500 chickens are promoted.</p>
<p>In the fourth year, 12,500 chickens are promoted.</p>
<p>In the fifth year, 62,500 chickens are promoted.</p>
<p>In the sixth year, 312,500 chickens are promoted.</p>
<p>In the seventh year, 1,562,500 chickens are promoted.</p>
<p>Taking Dingxian as the standard, there are only 700,000 chickens in the whole county. According to the above calculation, there are more than 1.5 million chickens in the seventh year. This excess number is reserved for deaths and losses. Therefore, I said that each county only needs 1,000 yuan, which is the cost of purchasing seed chickens. I think no matter how poor China is, it is not impossible for a county to plan 1,000 yuan as a construction project. It is certainly not difficult for the great Chinese government to plan the funding for a chicken farm. Furthermore, there is no cooperative organization for chicken raising in China. If the seed chicken farm stipulates regulations, and each province and county organizes according to the regulations, this can be used as a considerable tax revenue, which will definitely offset the expenses and have a surplus. This kind of business is beneficial to both the government and the people. I hope that the people will not only pay attention to the 100 million U.S. loan but forget the 280 million chicken production. You must know that living by relying on others will not have good results. Although the United States is very friendly to China, we must guard against the deformation of the East India Company. What is said is good, or it may be to sell his silver sales channels. I think it is better to work hard on our own than to borrow money from others.</p>

<p>— Bin</p>
<p>So-and-so,</p>
<p>In the season when the swallows are carrying crimson petals, you are going to leave wearing the solemn mortarboard. I tremble as I write this, and my heart is filled with infinite pain. Moreover, this unspeakable pain cannot be expressed on pure and immaculate paper like a fallen flower bidding farewell to its old branch. You may secretly blame me for these sentimental words. I don't care about these things at all. If someone like me, who is ignorant and unskilled, is gently blamed by you in your wise heart, I will feel infinitely honored. What I fear most is that you ignore me and pay me no attention.</p>
<p>Among the students in our department, you are an outstanding figure. Your elegant demeanor, your brilliant words, and your superior knowledge all fill me with infinite awe. Really, what else can I say to you besides awe? Therefore, although I have exchanged many unimportant letters with you and had some conversations that ordinary people consider extremely ordinary, I have never expressed anything to you. Now that you are leaving this place to take a high-ranking position in the capital, I am certainly even less qualified to express anything to you. I can only show you the same awe as in the past in the depths of my pure and flawless heart with the friendship of a classmate.</p>
<p>The reason why I am writing this open letter to you, presumptuously, is also to write this.</p>
<p>I remember that not long ago, I heard from a teacher that you were going to be the editor of a certain magazine at sea. I was so happy and excited when I heard this. In secret, I just prayed to all things in the universe that this news could be true. I hoped, but stupid me, because my heart of awe for you was too strong, so I disregarded all the trouble and investigated your career prospects, only to find out that the news was about 80% reliable. Because you published a collection of short stories, which was greatly admired by that female editor, so she intended to hire you as an assistant. Really, if this can become a reality, not only would I bless your future, but also the teachers and friends, who would not rejoice for you? As far as I know, you have a strong interest in literature and art, and what has already been expressed is also extraordinarily impressive. For example, in that collection of short stories, the so-called depiction of women has already achieved unparalleled success, and the bold descriptions are enough to captivate young people who love literature and art. When I read it, I can only feel more awe.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Under the Umbrella <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Photo by Bing</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, after having some wine, in my tipsy state, I wrote you a letter. The most important thing I wanted to say was that I hoped you could take on the editorship of that magazine. Because that publishing house is the only one of its kind in the country, it's not easy for ordinary people to get into. At the same time, it publishes many magazines, so its future development certainly holds unlimited promise. If you were to work there for a long time, you could also get to know many so-called influential literary friends. If you could achieve the highest literary reputation in the future, it would not only bring glory to our department, but also increase the value of our school many times over. As for me, unlearned and unskilled, perhaps I could receive your kind affection and be granted literary assistance. Therefore, how eagerly I long for you to take on this editorship! Based on your own preferences, there is no reason why this kind of job wouldn't suit you. Someone with your eloquence and ability to handle affairs is truly well-suited to be an official. However, I believe that a university graduate specializing in running in official circles is not very compatible with what we have learned. Although in the current social situation, what we learn is not what we use. If you really become a high-ranking official, someone like me, an unlearned literary beggar, would certainly not be something you would notice. However, in my foolish mind, I will always treat you with respect and awe. Whether I am favored or not, whether I am loved or not, I do not care. In such a complex society, one cannot worry about so many things.</p>
<p>Although our friendship is very ordinary, it often evokes my memories. Most of all, in the past, I was always envying and praising you. Even in front of teachers and friends, I often mentioned you. Indeed, you have many qualities that deserve the admiration of our peers. In class or at meetings, I often secretly admired your demeanor. However, I was afraid that the students would become suspicious of us, which would harm your reputation. Therefore, in the past, I never spoke to you. My deep affection for you was only silently remembered in my heart, and I dared not express it easily. In reality, the respect and love I often feel for you is no more or less important than the friendly affection I have for my classmates. I have no ambition beyond friendship. I can express this to you with a sincere heart. Therefore, I am writing this letter to you openly, hoping that you will not misunderstand me. There is no other purpose.</p>
<p>I remember one day, I was returning from a friend's place, and it was very late. You were wearing a newly made coat and carrying many things you had bought in your hand. Your face, under the lights of the public bus, looked even more beautiful in your youth. The man next to you looked very unfamiliar to me. Because among the students at our school, I had never seen him before. Perhaps this was Mr. X, who wrote the preface for you. At that time, I did not dare to look at you, only nodding slightly. However, my naive heart was filled with unease. Later, I saw the two of you whispering sweet nothings, presumably talking about me. But someone as unlearned and unskilled as I am is not worth your attention at all, is it? When the bus arrived at XX Company, I got off the bus silently and listlessly, wandered to the small red house, sat on the chair, and smoked, feeling that everything was over.</p>
<p>Truly, the heart of a young man is unpredictable.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, it's a long story. On the public bus to our school, especially in the evening, I often met you. I don't know why, but when I saw you, I only nodded slightly, not daring to say a word. It was truly silent and meaningful. You only glanced at me sideways, as if you didn't want to greet me. This not only embarrassed me, but also hurt me. Although our friendship is still very shallow, I am usually not good with words. After meeting you, of course, I could not say a word. Because of this, your intelligent mind and eloquent speech are so worthy of my admiration. Especially your eloquent and unstoppable debate, it truly captivates countless peers.</p>
<p>In the past, although you and I did not have much friendship, I could still often see your demeanor on the tram and in the classroom, which was enough to inspire me a lot. What about the future? It's truly unimaginable. You are leaving our school to take on a high-ranking official position. As for me, I hope to continue on the path of literature and art and take on the editorship of XX magazine. Perhaps we will still have the opportunity to meet in the future, because I am currently continuing this boring life of a literary beggar. If you take on that editorship, I might still be able to get your help. However, I am an "Adou" who cannot be helped. I hope you won't laugh at me.</p>
<p>This time you graduate, I thought over and over and didn't find anything worthy of giving you as a souvenir. If I gave a souvenir, perhaps the students would suspect us. If you don't despise it, then this short letter can be a souvenir of our time as classmates. Whether you are willing to accept it or not, I certainly cannot force it, and I cannot predict it with reason. In the future, although you have left our school and our department, I will always respect you and hope that you can give me some clear spring of friendship to moisten my almost withered heart. That's all. I wish you</p>
<p>A bright future. Your classmate, ○○</p>
