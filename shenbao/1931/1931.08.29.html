<p>時評</p>
<p>最近中國學術界之兩大年會（二）</p>
<p>丨中國科學社與中華農學會丨</p>
<p>近世紀科學之進步使我人從前羡慕無已之神仙本領。如縮地·水遁·騰雲駕霧等都一一實現。一般人都可享受而平凡無奇。偉大之機器長日吐出生活上之應用品。以供人類使用崇高之房屋。轟立於地面。以供人類居住。萬能之熱力。使人類之手與足幾成爲廢物。使廣博無垠之地球縮爲一團。生盡其所欲。得物盡其所欲取。更有新的美術。如雕刻·如繪晝·如音樂·如舞蹈等。以沉醉其心靈。怡悅其耳目。總之科學之世。界開發宇宙之賓藏。閘揚宇宙之奥秘。人能使用萬物。人爲萬物之主人。科學之進步程度。與人類之幸福程度恰爲向同一方向發展之兩平行。綫科學愈進步。則人類之生物。乃愈豐富美满此種豐富美满之生。活在彼進步之白種人及近鄰進步之日人。都已普遍實際享。受抑且努力邁。進求其更豐富更美满之生活。反觀我國則如何。今試取美國爲。比據美人安諾德著「中國問題裏的幾個根本問題」中統計。我國土地面積爲四·二七八·○○○方英哩。而鐵道綫僅有七·○○○英哩。摩托車僅二二·○○○輛。美國土地面積爲三·七四三·五○○方英哩。而鐵道綫則有二五○·○○○英哩。穈托車有二二·○○○·○○○輛又據一九三七年三月份之大西洋月報。有某美國工程専家云。「中國人每人只有一個機械奴隸。美國人毎人有三十個機器奴隸。」人已飛翔於天空。我則猶爬行於地上人以機器爲奴隸。我則仍以人爲奴隸。扁擔與繩索。兩手足與雙肩。人即機器也。沉重之邪許聲。與歐美軋軋之機輪聲。遠道遙相呼應。飢饉之來。忍受而已。疾疫之來。忍受而已。自然之迫害忍受而已。無可忍受。則呼靈於天蒼天無靈則以一死了之。吁同一空。間同一時間。而一淪地獄。一登天堂。人我之隔。懸殊如此。國家前途。將安所之孫中山先生之實業計劃。實現何時。十萬里鐵道之建設。完成何日。吾人但見白骨撑天。碧血徧地。搶彈悲鳴。毒氛四起。蘇聯革命後之五年計劃。已漸次完成矣誰能謂革命但有破壞而無建設。以人方我。益顯我爲一懶惰之民族。混亂之國家。茫茫前途。其將安適。</p>

<h3>英首相赴蘇格蘭休養</h3>
<p>工黨聯名發宣言書攻擊新政府與麥唐納政策</p>
<p>三政黨將分别開會兩黨皆可贊成其領袖行爲</p>
<p>路透社二十七日倫敦電今晚七時二十分英相麥唐納由倫敦赴蘇格蘭、將在洛錫茅資家中稍事休養、麥在過去數日内辛勞殊甚也、</p>
<p>路透社二十七日倫敦電工黨聯名發表宣言書、攻擊新政府與麥唐納之政策、署名者首爲漢德森、此文出於工黨三大機關、即總工會行政處、工黨全國執行會、及　會工黨之顧問委員會是已、其攻擊之根據、曾違反德謨克拉西、指新政府未得人民之委任、欲摧毀勞動家生活程度、以應合私人銀行政策所造成之現狀、並責政府欲强迫完全改變國家政策、徒因有勢力金融界不欲英國行徵收富稅以濟貧乏之策、爲他國表率耳、又謂今亿藉口以擬裁社會事業經費之金融危局並不若危言家及宣傳家所言之甚、英國富力甚大、國人負稅能力未竭云、宣言書又條陳救濟目前金融困難之辦法、謂宜（一）没收國人之國外投資、（二）暫時停止償債準備金之支撥、（三）增收固定利息債券的收入、及各種不勞而獲的收入之稅、麥唐納所稱之同等犧牲、决不能適用於工人云、泰晤士報批評上述宣言、謂此宣言書言論錯誤幾無逐句辯駁之價値云、</p>
<p>路透社二十七日倫敦電英國三政黨今日分别開會皆討論對於新政府應採之態度、保守自由皆可贊成其領袖之行爲、工黨態度亦無可疑、自必極端反對新政府、但集議時反對者究佔多少、工黨中擁護其舊領袖者究有幾人、此亦大可注意者也、保守黨今日午前十一時半開會、包爾溫說明其加入麥唐納政府之理由、會議對於無關宏指之點、或意見稍有不同、但贊同包爾過之行逕者、必佔大多數、可無疑也、自由黨十一時開會、發言者將爲蕯繆爾李定及葛雷諸人、想亦可無異議、工黨由午後二時開會屆時必通過工黨爲國會中正式反對黨之議案、但仍贊助麥唐納者之人數、亦或可由此知之</p>
<p>路透社二十八日倫敦電財政大臣史</p>
<p>諾豋一俟目下之財政困難解脫後、即擬棄去政治生活、麥唐納則不引退、史諾豋今日宣稱、渠於四月之前曾告首相、俟下院通過下屆財政年度預算案、及辦竣巨額債券轉瘓事後、即擬乞休、但目下國際財政發生危難之時、渠覺未可見難而退、責當留任渠之退志、與此次政變無關云、預料内閣今夜可彙齊國民政府政策所將依據之各項材、料本星碁杪閣員可開始考慮、彼等現信九月八日國會召集之時、一切計晝可以擬就、</p>
<h3>葡京亂事已平</h3>
<p>共死五十人傷三百人</p>
<p>北方數省尙隔絕不通</p>
<p>路透社二十七日瑪德里電葡京傅來電話消息、證實萄境安靖已復、但謂此次政變、共死五十人、傷三百人、北方數省現隔絕不通、電信檢查頗嚴、衆料政府與叛黨時有小戰、叛黨現向北逃竄、</p>
<p>國民社廿七日里斯本電葡京今日已告安謐、但軍隊仍留營戒防、通衢大道鐵甲車及坦克砲車巡邏不懈、蓋當局仍恐有亂事發生也、據官報宣稱、今次叛亂、各省及海軍、均來參加、故目下尙有何部不穩殊難知之也、</p>
<p>國民社廿七日瑪里電截至發電時止、參加葡京變亂之飛機、已有四架逃至西班牙境降落、即被當道没收、該四機爲忠於葡政府之航空隊追至西班牙邊境而罷、逃來諸機、機身彈痕、歷歷可見、其駕駛員聞葡京亂事已平、仍告人謂加摩那總統固足暫時小康、但各地人民多厭惡加摩那之獨裁、革命運動有燎原之勢、尤以北方反對獨裁之空氣最爲濃厚、全部警備隊皆同情於革命云、</p>
<h3>英美借欵討論大有進步</h3>
<p>美银行界願以鉅欵相貸</p>
<p>法借欵實際有已商妥說</p>
<p>路透社二十七日紐約電現據最可特消息、英政府借債討論、在過去二十四小時内、已有大進步、明日當可有正式文告、紐約晚郵報稱、銀行界以摩根公司爲領袖、已允以至少三萬萬元之短期借欵供英國應用云、官場不否認此說之眞確、故此說在實質上當係有據、不過債額或不止三萬萬元耳、現悉美法銀行允借欵與英國、爲數甚鉅、故英金之平準、將不成問題、債額當在二萬萬元與五萬萬元之間、又聞短期債欵後將繼以長期債欵五萬萬元、淮銀行界對此長期債欵之說、尙未承認、大約法銀行將與美銀行合借短期鉅欵、然後再由美國承借長期借欵、如此債果成則債額必甚鉅也、綜各方面表示、美銀行之願以鉅欵相借、可無疑義但視英政府有無採行減政程序之保障耳</p>
<p>路透社二十八日倫敦電紐約所傳對英借債之說倫敦未能證實但衆信或有其事、且認爲英金國際價格之危局現已過、去向法談判、者現爲美財政部之羅斯、及英倫銀行之席卜曼、此二人在巴黎昨與法財長佛蘭亭聚餐、而佛蘭亭復與銀行委員會主席美人韋金晤商頗久、同時法蘭西銀行在談判時與美國聯邦儲備銀行有密切之接觸、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日紐約電據紐約時報華盛頓訪員稱胡佛總統已贊成以英金八千萬鎊貸與英國</p>
<p>國民社二十七日巴黎電法財長佛蘭亭·法蘭西銀總理摩萊·英倫銀行董事李普門·及英國財政部代表·今日午後在此舉行重要會議、討論法銀行所建議以長期借欵貸與英國問、題據金融界消息、借欵數目爲一萬萬鎊、法銀行將留下四分之一、用以償還新近法美貸英之五千萬鎊欵之法國部分、並悉此間之談判、與英財政當局向紐約銀團進行者、性質無甚出入、美國借欵數目與法國借欵數目相同、對於償還新近美債、亦採同樣辦法惟聞聯邦準備銀行組織規條、不准動用欵項、以供給外國銀行、故英美談判已遇暗礁、</p>
<p>國民社二十八日巴黎電英國接洽借欵、實際已於夜間商妥、今日可望簽字、數目傳說不一、約在八千萬鎊至一萬萬鎊之間、並聞美國承借部份亦在其内、蓋此次亦如日前對英倫銀行之放欵由法美合貸也、</p>
<h3>甚囂塵上之德内閣改组說</h3>

<h3>全印大會要求邀得相當准許</h3>

<p>甘地啟程赴英倫</p>

<p>敎育消息特載</p>
<h3>補習敎育的效用在那裏江問漁（二）</h3>
<p>在此進退兩難的敎育局面之下、只有補習敎育、可以解除一部分或一大部分的困難、在此公私交困、人人視敎育爲畏途的時候、有補習敎育、可以免除這個苦痛、在此生產支絀人人詬病敎育不能助長生產反而摧殘生產的呼聲當中、只有補習敎育、可以弭補這個缺憾、在此多數靑年升學無力、煩悶抑鬱、怨氣冲天之際、只有補習敎育、可以疏解這種鬱氣、這並不是替補習敎育、特别捧塲、實在補習敎育的自身、有此偉大的能力、能由此偉大能力、顯出特殊效用、我對於職業敎育、旣然看得如此之重而且要、當然我所說的補敎内容、對象、程度、不能和通常人所說的一樣了、</p>
<p>（一）就内容說是要十分充實、因爲他的任務、不僅僅是職業技能及常識的補授、同時對於公民道德的陶冶、本國文化的發揚個人人格的修養愛國心的激發、以及體格的鍛鍊、均宜十分注意質言之、職業訓練、人格修養、體格鍛鍊（包括軍事訓練）是補習敎育的三大目標、也是補習敎育的三大主幹、這三大主幹、一定要平均發達、無所偏倚、要交互爲用、調劑得宜、</p>
<p>（二）就對象說是要各方兼顧固然是已經從事職業、無力升學有志上進的靑年、是補習學校的正式學生、但是、照中國目前特殊情形來看、却不能不把範圍放寛一些、如郷村未進過學校的十七八歲靑年、已經能隨他父兄做種種農事工作、對於這一類人、正不妨在農隙之暇、藉短期的民衆學校、做一個補習敎育機關、除補授四年的義務敎育外、並可對於職業訓練特加注意、這不是很好的推行義務敎育且含有職業性的義務敎育　的辦法麽、又如高小畢業、及初中畢業尙未有事做的靑年亟須補習一些職業知能更宜藉此種補習敎育機關、來代替職業學校、就是高中畢業、技無専長的亦未嘗不可設補習敎育機關、授以較高深的技藝、不過這一類補習敎育萬不可専注技能一方、致將德體兩育忘却、以上所說、覺得關係異常重大、因爲果能如此辦、則受補習敎育的人、就格外衆多了、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>公共打字機</p>
<p>德京柏林許多百貨大公司中。最近都備有一架公共打字機。每次只須把一個便士投在那機上的小罅中。便可給你打字每天總有無數的商人。魚貫似的等候在那裏。挨次上去打字。所以毎天的收入。也很可觀。這打字機的構造。和尋常的打字機一樣。不過多一個計數器。與一個收費的小罅而已。</p>
<p>在開始打字時。每次應當打多少字。都須自己先行算就。所打的字。由那計數器的面板一一記下毎投下。一便士。以打一千下爲限。打到了第一千下時。那機上裝有一個機括。立刻鎖住。必須再投一個便士。方始再給你打下去。</p>
<p>這公共打字機。確是一件很聰明的新發明品不過那字鍵是很脆薄的。天天給幾千隻手在鍵上打。怕不能持久呢。</p>
<h3>清道人軼事</h3>
<p>— 阿丹</p>
<p>清道人未第時。有武陵余某測其必以文章顯。以長女字之。未婚卒。復字以次女。又卒。更字以三女名梅者。結婚數年。旋亦逝世。道人神傷魂黯。感余之風義。終身鰥居不續。絃遂號梅痴。。又别署梅菴</p>
<p>道人原籍江西臨川。其父爲湖南候補道。因居湖南。性極痴憨。不知世故。忽然發興赴攷而時論作法。絕無所知。一日於舊書攤得小題正鵲秘玩再三夾帶入塲。適試題爲書中所有。遂録全文。主考不察。大爲激賞。榜發之後。與論譁然。爭名額者。遂具狀上訴。竟以冒籍及剿襲舊文。將其褫。革後道人所中之舉人。是在贛籍再中这舉人。故知者常以雙料舉人相戲謔。道人輒爲囅然。</p>
<p>辛亥革命。東南克復。道人始由寗來滬蓄髮大。衣儼然道士。本名李瑞清。遂號清道人。懸玉梅花庵道士牌於門首。某宅喪事登門请做道塲。李大窘。爲薦鄰菴道士代。之蓋請者不知其爲書家李瑞清。說者謂其濫竊神器。宜有此報。</p>
<p>道人初訂。例頗爲别緻。潤格上標明周秦漢魏六朝唐宋元明清等。字適楊重子（鈞）自湘至滬見之遂問道人曰。若欲開照相館耶。余以爲君豈能盡能。能亦無味。自窘自繩。殊可不必。道人大悟。援筆改訂。正點竄間。求書者至。指定虞伯施體八尺楹帖。客去。李取石印本集字臨之。敷衍了事。而燬舊潤例。某日道人謂楊晳子（度）曰。余書無一筆不是古人。楊答曰。宜其無筆是閣不矣。蓋道人之書。以臨墓碑帖得名也</p>
<p>道人作書與常人異。某次爲人書墓誌。侍者進食。適寫道。字即擱筆就餐。中止者首字。飯後始寫成道字。又某次爲榜書。寫長橫左半而輟。蓋牽紙者爲女士。客來趨避。及客去再寫右半橫。所以道人之字。非一氣呵成。可以隨意搬拆。惟其論書。則有數語。頗爲獨到。如云。貧道論書。以爲當於古人求古人。不可於今人學古者求古人。此弊至元以來。皆願學同時人書。此種倚賴奴隷性。萬不可有。何道州隷非不佳。無一筆不似漢人神味。然不肯板。但求活動。故其筆法不可衣被。後人學其書而工者。則人見之者。皆曰學何而已。其弊在不能細語。然而今之學曾李康鄭吳沈者。聞之。又不知作何感想矣。　　　　道人得高房山山水立軸。視爲瑰寳。但葉德輝則評其爲　鼎並非眞跡。及道人仙逝。農髯以數千元售。出營道人葬事。是則僞房山不負眞梅菴矣。</p>

<h3>楊縵華女士游歐雜感（一）</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>美術家許士騏君。去歳由國民政府衛生部派往歐洲考察衛生行政歷時凡一年有半。徧游英·法·德·意·瑞·比·奥·波·俄等十餘國。近偕其夫人楊縵華女士·取道西伯利亞返國一昨記者晤及楊女士。叩以此行的感想。伊說提起感想二字。眞是一言難盡我們這次留法的時間較。久印象也最爲深切。因把旅法華工與勤工儉學生。留法學生的生活狀况。吾國駐外使領館的窮困及一般歐洲人對我國情的誤解。赤裸裸地報告出來。亦莊亦諧。我現在介紹伊這一番不偏不倚的話。以博讀者一粲。</p>
<p>在巴黎近郊僑民的華工爲數很不少。他們在已往十幾年。中平平地過去。可是近年來生產力旣遠不如昔。生活窘迫的狀况。自在想像之中。比較可以維持的不過百分之幾。幸而謀得苦工的位置。或小本經營的販賣。已屬十分僥倖多數爲失業而衣食不濟的人。所在皆然流落外邦。欲歸不得。政府當初旣遺派出國。現在竟不爲籌劃安置或遣回的。善後辦法。無怪他們對祖國的啣怨飲恨了。華工們娶法婦的很。多法女所以嫁華工的原因。可以說受了人口問題的支配。與謀生的幻想。如今法國女子的人數。依然還超過男子數倍。女子嫁人。也就不大容易。那般嫁給華工的。自然是可憐的薄倖女郎。如爲謀生而嫁華工。簡直是幻想罷了。他們所生的子女。語言習慣。一切都從母。敎將來是不是我們的同。胞現在還是疑問。照法國的國籍法满了二十歲。才可以呈報政府核定呢。有一位中法大學敎務長劉　君。他覺得僑生子女。從小就在法國學校讀書。連自己也不明白親是那一國的人。將來不能歸化吾國。是一件很危險的事去年就創辦一所華僑子女中文補習學校利用他們放學回家的餘　。每天敎一小時國文。僅費數月功夫。他們已能略解華語。這倒是一個補救的妙法。</p>
<p>十年前李石曾·吳稚暉·諸先生鼓吹勤工儉。學那時一般中學生正醉心西洋文明。誰都想嘗嘗留法的滋味。他們備的資斧很有限。一到了法國。就想實行半工半讀。豈知讀書與做工有時很難兼顧。而况不容易找得相當的工作。這幾年來法國人也闹失業了。中國人休想侵奪他們的飯碗。於是弄得無工可做。也無錢求學了。他們的景况眞可憐旣無餘欵以維持生活。又乏旅費回來祖國。進退兩難。顚連萬狀。倘使政府再不設法救濟。前途將不堪設想呢。</p>
<h3>東北考察隨筆（五）</h3>
<p>— 劉穗九</p>
<p>（八）日人所設圖書館及圖書分類意見</p>
<p>日人在我中國東北部各地設立之圖書館達二十五所。大連一處即有七所之多。俄人勢力所及之哈爾濱。亦有日人設立之圖書館。日人經營所謂满蒙。尤孜孜於文化事業。可見一斑。其在沿南满路綫設立之大小圖書館爲數幾與其沿鐵路綫所設立之學校數目相等。誠堪注意者也。</p>
<p>查大連圖書館。乃民國七年一月設立。查該館十八年度經費爲日金二十萬○二千五百五十三元○九角。據民國十八年間之調查。藏有書籍十三萬五千九百九十六册。近日恐不止此數矣。該館漢文部門松崎鶴雄氏。年約四五十。曾從王湘綺先生治漢文學。熊度純爲儒者風。博學深思之搢紳也。</p>
<p>奉天圖書館設立於宣統元年十一月。據十八年上年度調查報告。該館經費决算爲日金五萬四千○十三元○三分該年藏書有四萬○九百三十四册該館館長衛藤利夫氏。爲一堅苦越之學者。予曾與之用英語暢談數小時。彼告予以該館凡漢文典籍仍用經史子集分類法。因漢籍分類極不易。如易經謂爲文學也可。謂爲史學也可。謂爲哲學亦無不可。甚費斟酌。又不便妄斷。故以保存舊法分類爲要。氏又不贊成中國式裝訂書籍。仿用歐美式書籍樹立陳列法陳列之。議論風生且多趣談。報告館情。太其種種意見甚詳盡。誠不愧爲圖書館長矣。</p>
<p>（九）圖書活動法</p>
<p>满鐵圖書館。有多種巡廻文庫之設施。約分六種（一）巡廻於各圖書館者。每次巡廻書籍册。數約百五十册左右。每兩月交換一次。地點爲哈爾濱以南各大埠至大連爲止。（二）巡廻書庫貸付所。巡廻於南滿鐵路沿線各較小站。每次約五十册。每月交換一次。地點如旅順。周水子。金州。三十里堡等處。（三）巡廻小函廻付所。巡廻於以上各地以外之各車站舉南满安奉兩鐵路之本支各綫。皆巡廻周到。無遺漏之憾（四）特别廻付所。係巡廻於距鐵沿綫較遠地方。而各日本僑民居處所在者。毎次巡廻約百册。每三月交換一次。（五）學校書庫。巡廻於各車站無圖書館之小學校。每次册數約六十册毎兩月交換一次。（六）列車書庫。巡廻於直通之火車中。計十書庫毎庫備圖書二十册。雜誌三十種。備供旅客隨時選閱。满鐵各圖書館又共同發行一種館報名曰「書香。」每月刋行一次。又有讀書之組織。引起閱覽圖書之興趣。種種設施。無微不至。日人經營满蒙有趣味。有思想計畫。有科學方法。不亦大可長哉。</p>

<h3>棉市稍呈平勢</h3>

<h3>糧食新早稻洋秈見市</h3>
<p>南市昨日各帮來源四十號、城郷交易極微此因天時晴正况新閘猛甩之故統市只斛六百餘石、厚粳行情驟削七八角、中次分清、薄稻沉寂乏交、趨勢亦疲四五角浦東新粳貨湧、甩落一元光景、人心均皆看鬆、陳洋杜尖緣貨寥寥銷化不燥形略跟跌平湖新早稻昨已見樣數十石又嘉善新洋尖近百担米品尙佳、價開十四元五角至十四元一種新貨平價、</p>
<p>新閘昨日西路到頭尙湧、形勢一蹶不振常錫北粳續短頂貨及普通二種價縮四五角、早晚稻到旺胃淡、價低六七角羊杜尖交易極淡、河存尙、多買氣岑寂埠尖隨到隨銷、形勢定局、壩尖乏貨應市、糯米到頭日多價格逐步下游洋米來貨仍薄弱、客帮稍動、惟本街略淡、、致價疲修一二角</p>
<h3>北洋帮續辦客元</h3>
<p>洋米有新定二十萬噸之說</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、現貨銷化平淡、本客均在觀望中、故統市未有交易、北洋帮對於客元胃口甚佳、惟市存不多、價又高昂、昨日祗購裝江西機元數十包、價十五元一角半、洋米現化雖淡、而期貨交易則甚活躍、市上則有回籠貨千餘噸成交、仍係九月份小絞、價六兩四錢二分至六兩半、定貨新交易尤見旺盛、市上傳說炳昌洋行在產地新買二十萬噸以上、故產地市價不易下落、昨日安利電報即裝貨小絞七兩四錢一號西貢七兩半、二號西貢七兩、各有二千噸出售、祥茂洋行打出電報、則有一號西貢即裝八百噸、價七兩三錢云、</p>
<h3>標粉買氣見强</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致復呈穩俏之象雖洋麥報價小二角左右、惟本月份自跌到二兩零八分一關後實銷方面已動辦胃以距最高價格、已跌一錢各處運銷、均多合划、故買氣見暢遠期亦因此故、亦爲帶振不過各廠方面因洋麥續定籌碼愈多、仍亦繼暢出、後步之結局、當看實銷之是否暢旺、結果本月份較前日回漲一分半、九月份漲一分七厘半、十月份漲一分半、十一·十二月份漲一分二釐半、一月份漲一分七釐半云、</p>
<h3>期麥轉向穩定</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面上下午開盤後、各月份市面已轉穩定之局因本月份已經止拍大批交割之貨、已得本外埠廠家之收去、（本埠申大祥新南京大同數達一百餘車外行人心、未免因此而轉定投機之買、戶又起而活動、市氣遂略呈穩俏、不過洋麥之續定者亦不見絕如維多利亞二號白麥廠家又有萬噸以上之成交、價廉至三兩七錢八分至三兩八錢、故此種回頭、仍未許樂觀也、結果九月份較前日好三分、十月份好一分、十一月份好四分、十二月份好二分、一月份未動、現麥市情受本月份標準結局之影響、又兼廠胃甚呆、帶落七八分、開鎭江麥三兩六錢半奔牛·直塘·揚州麥三兩七錢、太倉麥三兩五錢七分、計一千二百餘包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<h3>南北貨同安新桂圓已到申</h3>

<p>英鋼板千餘張運往靑島昨日靑島帮對於七厘半英鋼板生意十分興奮、總計辦去有一千二百餘塊之多、其價估六兩四錢、其他天津·牛莊諸帮亦有生意是以市情頗有欣向榮之槪、</p>
<p>馬口鐵囤戶收進二千箱馬口鐵目下售盤多要虧負因此一般營業此貨者莫不愁眉變鎖、惟據昨市情形觀之、此貨有重振氣象、蓋實用廠家均起收買、而蛋廠帮復收羅不已、而異軍突起之囤戶帮、辦去二千餘箱、總計一日交易、有三千數百箱之鉅苟日有此等銷路、則上海祇存七八萬箱之馬口鐵不難銷罊、而市情之轉機、定可拭目以待之耳、</p>
<p>新鉛絲走銷甚活潑新铅絲昨日走銷十分活潑、如内河帮·蕪湖·安慶·九江諸路均有良好淮胃而天津帮之收辦亦覺衆多、人心被其帶高貨價喑步漲風、計十六號至二十號毎担估十三兩五錢、二十一號至二十五號十八兩七錢半、查開出之貨共有四五百担之多云、</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>七月十八日以來、德軍所遇着的不斷的攻擊、人馬的傷亡無、算軍用品的損失甚巨、統使敵軍不得不在此面縮短防綫、和自動的放棄四月間在梅慈布洛克所獲得的戰績、八月八日至九月四日間、德軍最高司令撤退員普爾南面突角的部隊、而在韋基特亞門梯歐拉牌西之綫佈防、重要的陣地如克末爾山以及占用四個月的倍塞内煤礦等等均不得不放棄、</p>
<p>六星期裏、敵軍春天所獲得的戰績已完全失掉、兵力和軍用品損失固屬甚巨、最重要的爲敵軍軍心渙散無力恢復進攻的優勢地位、我軍祇須依照預定計劃勇往直前、用美軍部隊以肅清巴黎亞夫里谷鐵路綫、好像前以英法兩軍肅清巴黎亞眠和巴黎歇龍鐵路綫一樣、聯軍已到了根據七月二十四的計劃書調用最後參戰的軍隊—美軍—把戰事更向東開展的時機、</p>
<p>敵軍的退却證明其衰弱和缺乏補充、我遂請海帥和紀良少將注意北部的形勢、很利於進取九月二日、我寫給他們道、「比軍和英第二軍可以小小的犧牲攻占克勒肯高地·霍什爾森林·拜興台爾山嶺·以及康明内我軍戰綫出其不意的向雷斯河之北擴展、除去直接的利益外、剛才所說的目標的達到還好成爲將來進攻魯勒和谷特萊的良好的出發點、</p>
<p>我請英軍總司令和比軍參謀長立即研究這些計劃、我自己也進一步準備聯軍的總攻、—這總攻現因七月十八日局部戰事的勝利頗有把握、最後一步就是佈置美國第一軍在米聖希爾突角作戰、</p>
<p>七月二十四日的計劃書中曾有美軍在胡夫爾區域攻擊的一節、</p>
<p>因在七月二十二日决定、於馬爾納的美第一軍外、另編美第二軍駐諾門尼至聖米希爾突角北面區域那方面、</p>
<p>七月底美軍的編成很明白的顯出美</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Inspects Flood Damage in Hankou</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan and Others Leave Hankou to Return to Shanghai After Flood Prevention Measures are Completed</p>
<p>Hankou: Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou on the 28th aboard the Yong Sui warship to inspect the flood damage, escorted by naval vessels. (28th Dispatch) The water level of the Yangtze River in Hankou receded by 1.5 inches on the 28th, with the water level at 52 feet 7 inches. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: Zhu Qinglan and He Chengjun, among others, agreed on disaster relief measures and, on the 28th, along with Baker and others, flew back to Shanghai. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: The Flood Prevention Bureau, due to the collapse of many dikes and levees in various locations, and the absence of danger to those that have not collapsed, decided to conclude its operations. The Hankou Municipal Government will jointly manage the drainage of Hankou City and the repair of collapsed areas such as the Dan Shuichi single-hole, with the Pinghan Railway Bureau. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: Disaster victims from various counties aiming to seek refuge in Wuhan are increasingly arriving, mostly in small boats or civilian vessels. As they swarm in, Wuhan authorities, for security reasons, are absolutely prohibiting their entry into the city. However, the momentum of refugees whose sole purpose is survival is growing. Currently, near the Huangjing Tang in Hankou, there are over 30,000 disaster victims who have fled from Hanchuan and Mianyang counties, all crowding on hundreds of civilian boats, demanding relief rice. Authorities yesterday dispatched two battalions of soldiers to suppress them. (27th Dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>
<p>Hankou: It is difficult to predict when the water will recede this time. The Meiji Ordinary Higher Elementary School, run by a Japanese group, has decided to extend its summer vacation to September 25th. (28th Dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>
<p>Hankou: Because the city is flooded, the Hubei Postal Bureau does not know when the water will recede. Therefore, it has established a mobile postal service on the water in Hankou, which cruises the city until 4:00 PM, collecting and distributing general mail and selling stamps. (28th Dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>
<p>Nanchang: Chairman Chiang donated 3,000 dan of rice for flood relief. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hankou Oil Depot Fire</h3>
<p>Fire Continues to Burn as of Last Night, Losses Exceeding 4 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Hankou: The Texaco oil depot in the Japanese Concession in Hankou, due to carelessness, continues to burn as of the 28th evening. It is reported that over 400,000 boxes of kerosene have been burned, with losses exceeding several million. The injured have been sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment, and the number of deaths is still under investigation. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: The fire at the Texaco Oil Company in Hankou has not been extinguished as of 8:00 AM this morning. Due to its proximity to the Japanese Concession, a high level of alert is in effect. The cause of the fire is the spontaneous combustion of kerosene. Several oil tankers are tied to the side of the depot, and there is currently no way to save them. It is expected to take a considerable amount of time for the two large warehouses full of oil, as well as the many oil tankers docked beside them, to burn completely. However, the surrounding area is submerged by over ten feet of water, and the oil is floating on the surface, posing a great fire hazard. Residents are evacuating. (28th Dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>
<p>Hankou: A barrel of kerosene (80 gallons) from the Asiatic Petroleum Company depot, located three miles downstream of Hankou, has been washed away by the current and is currently floating downstream. If it collides with a reef or runs aground, there is an immediate risk of fire, which is very dangerous for shipping. Mr. Lie, the director of the Hankou River Administration, issued a special warning today. (28th Dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>
<p>Hankou: The Texaco oil depot in Hankou is still burning this morning, with two warehouses containing 100,000 barrels of oil. It is feared that the fire will continue to burn for another day, and the losses are estimated to be around 4 million yuan. The cause of the fire is unknown, and so far it has not affected nearby industries. (28th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Hankou: The fire at the Texaco Oil Company has not been extinguished as of noon today. The northeast wind is very strong, and the fire is raging more fiercely, with black smoke obscuring the sky and creating an extremely tragic scene. According to the company, the fire was caused by carelessness while transferring kerosene from ships to warehouses yesterday. The damage, including kerosene and gasoline, is estimated to be over one million yuan. (28th Dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>
<p>Hankou: At 3:00 PM today, a fire suddenly broke out at the American Texaco Oil Company in the lower part of the Japanese Concession in Hankou. The Japanese Concession is shrouded in black smoke and in a state of chaos. (27th Dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>

<h3>Disaster Victims Everywhere in Shao Gao</h3>

<h3>Stable Conditions at Yellow River Projects, Shandong Province Reports Disasters in Twenty-Two Counties</h3>

<p>Divided into Two Types: Temporary and Fundamental</p>
<p>Nanjing: The National Flood Relief Committee, for the sake of learning from past mistakes and preventing future problems, has decided on an overall plan for relief matters, divided into two types: temporary and fundamental. The temporary measures include temporary relief, emergency relief, work relief, epidemic prevention, loans, grain loans, and seed loans. The fundamental measures include reorganizing the Yangtze River, dredging the Huai River, dredging tributaries, and building new-style hair dams, opening up waterways, and other measures. Experts are currently drafting them in different ways. Furthermore, since most of the rural areas in various provinces have been damaged, in order to restore cultivation, it depends on proper post-disaster management. It is planned to propose some disaster relief funds to establish a rural cooperative general society and branches to handle loans and seed loans. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Salary donations from all national agencies for disaster relief, as well as cash donations from all parties, will be transferred to the Flood Relief Committee for temporary storage for overall distribution. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Political Change in Gansu</h3>
<p>Ma Hongbin Detained, Ma Fuxiang Discusses Gansu Situation</p>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the political change in Gansu, with Chairman Ma Hongbin detained, Ma Fuxiang said that the situation in Gansu is complex. The government appointed Ma Hongbin as chairman of the province, but Hongbin was unwilling to take the position. Chiang repeatedly urged him by telegram, and he reluctantly took office. However, all financial revenues and expenditures, as well as the appointment and dismissal of officials, were still controlled at will by powerful individuals, and the chairman had no authority to intervene. Initially, he did not expect this political change. On the 25th of this month, he suddenly received a telegram from Ma's subordinates, stating that Chairman Ma entered the city to work today, but the city gate was suddenly closed and the chairman was detained, and the truth was unclear. Ma's residence is outside the city, and the provincial office is inside the city. After this telegram, no further telegrams were received, and the situation is currently unknown. At today's National Government meeting, he briefly reported on the matter and needed to telegraph Chairman Chiang for instructions. He has absolutely no bias in the matter. As for the Gansu Provincial Party, Government, Military, Academic, Commercial, and Labor Congress's telegram, it is just the private opinion of one or two people, and calling him a warlord is not worth laughing at. Whether he is a warlord is a matter of public opinion. In a day or two, he will submit the facts of his life to the Central Government for review. Ma Hongbin is Ma Fuxiang's cousin. Ma's troops number only about two thousand. Unexpectedly, Lei Zhongtian and Ma Wenche suddenly mutinied and led troops to surround Suzhou. Lei and others are former subordinates of Feng, and because they did not know that Shi Yousan had been resolved, they rashly responded. The names of the people in their telegram were mostly falsely listed. Ma Hongkui went to Ningxia to take office, but the date is still undetermined. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Lin Jing, a counselor of the National Government, discussed the Han-Hui issue in the Northwest. Since the 21st year of Guangxu, the relationship had gradually become harmonious. Unexpectedly, in the 13th year of the Republic of China, Feng Yuxiang's presence in Gansu caused ethnic divisions, leaving a rift between the two ethnic groups. In recent years, the Central Government has been seen to employ outstanding Hui people, previously promoting Ma Lin to chairman of Qinghai, and previously appointing Ma Hongkui as chairman of Ningxia, and now appointing Ma Hongbin as acting chairman of Gansu. However, the Han-Hui issue in Gansu is particularly complex. Lei Zhongtian, Chen Guizhang, and others were former subordinates of Feng and resided in the same city as Feng. Ma is peaceful, but his subordinates are easily incited by Feng and others, making it difficult to avoid unrest. This change in Gansu may be based on this. The Central Government will send a senior official to Gansu to handle the matter fairly and, on the other hand, start with education to eliminate sectarianism. Previously, there was a proposal for Gu Zhutong to enter Gansu, which was welcomed by both Han and Hui people, but it was a pity that it was not realized due to the many events in the Central Plains. If Gu had arrived in Gansu earlier, there would have been no disturbance this time. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hungary Invents New Method for Morphine Production</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Anti-Opium Society reported, based on a letter from Commissioner Wu Liande, that the Hungarian representative to the League of Nations' Conference on the Limitation of the Manufacture of Narcotic Drugs stated that the government of that country has a new invention for the production of morphine. In the past, the production method was refined from opium, but now it is only necessary to wait for the poppy to ripen, pick it, and put it into a specially prepared machine, and the product is no different from ordinary morphine. Compared with the previous production method, the convenience and output is one to four. The production method and machine have been patented by the government of that country and are kept secret from the outside world. Since morphine production has become more convenient, the world's morphine production will definitely surge in the future. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Envoy to Chile Zhang Luao Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Zhang Luao, the envoy to Chile, stating that he officially presented his credentials on the 26th. The regent of Chile congratulated Chairman Chiang on his health and expressed condolences for the flood. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mexico Orders Chinese to Leave the Country</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the Mexican government's order for all Chinese in Mexico to leave the country by September 2nd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Xiong Chongzhi, the envoy to Mexico, to find ways to effectively protect them. Xiong replied that the Mexican Foreign Minister had asked the President to send troops to stop the situation, but it was feared that it would still be ineffective. The US government has allowed Chinese to transit through the country for temporary refuge and has notified the Chinese community to prepare for emergencies, but there are still no arrangements for resettlement. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>First Fleet Holds Exercises</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Chen Jiliang, the commander of the First Fleet of the Navy, under orders, led the Hai Rong, Hai Chou, Ying Rui, Tong Ji, Yong Jian, Yong Ji, Da Tong, Zi Qiang, Yu Zhang, and Jian Kang ships to the waters off Fujian and Zhejiang to conduct exercises in the Sandu area. On the morning of the 27th, the entire fleet departed from Sandu for exercises. The formation was swift and orderly. The exercises were completed at 5:00 PM. The entire fleet anchored at Zhizhu Island. At that time, torpedo attacks were practiced, with a hypothetical enemy as the target. The officers and men worked exceptionally hard. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hubei Finance Department Requests Additional Salt Tax for Relief</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Wu Guozhen, the Director of Finance of Hubei, came to Nanjing to request that an additional salt tax be temporarily collected by the provincial government for a period of six months and used as relief funds. He went from Beijing to Shanghai to see Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, to show implementation. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>National Government Issues Edict to All National Officials</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government issued an order on the 28th stating that this year, the floods in the river basins and provinces have caused disasters that have not yet ended. Although the government has repeatedly ordered investigations and rescues, given the vastness of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster, it is deeply concerned that it will not be able to help the people. Officials in the provinces should follow their duties and many have not yet reached the affected areas. In addition, the Communist bandits are being suppressed, and foreign aggression is looming. This is truly a time of crisis for the survival of our country and our nation. All national officials who serve the people should be vigilant day and night, working together to overcome national difficulties. They should embrace the spirit of self-sacrifice and do their best. Those who neglect their duties, disregard the disaster, and willingly become sinners of the nation will be punished by national law. I hope everyone will be mindful of this. Do not neglect this order. (28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Nanjing: Jiangxi Telegram: (1) There have been fierce battles on the front lines for days. According to intelligence, the bandits plan to defend Jiangxi Province to the death, but their strength has been severely damaged. Recently, they have been forcibly abducting people in various villages and towns to replenish their ranks. Our army is holding strategic passes with strong forces to prevent the bandits from escaping.

<h3>Zhu Shude Case Prosecuted by Jinan District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>Jinan: In the Zhu Shude case, Liu Rongshan, the prosecutor of the Jinan District Prosecutor's Office, has filed a public prosecution today. The gist is that Zhu left two suicide notes before committing suicide, which were exactly like Zhu's handwriting. It was confirmed that she died by shooting herself with a pistol. However, according to the testimony of the maid Chen Wang, Zhu wanted to be a concubine but could not get her wish. The defendants Wang Weijun and Liu Hesheng testified that Zhu felt that her sister Shuxin was having financial difficulties with her tuition. Zhu intended to commit suicide, and the defendants were aware of it. Liu Hesheng also testified that Liu was at home when Zhu committed suicide. The defendants were aware of the situation but did not hide the pistol, which showed that they provided her with convenience to commit suicide and are suspected of assisting suicide and should be prosecuted according to law. The reasons for the prosecution are that the defendants possessed a military pistol without permission, which has been proven by the witness Chen Wang. They did not hide the pistol to prevent accidents. Liu was at home when Zhu committed suicide, and Zhu used the pistol to commit suicide. The defendants provided the pistol, making it easier for her to commit suicide, and are suspected of assisting suicide. They are suspected of violating Article 42 of the Criminal Law, Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Military Gun Control Regulations, and Article 290, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Also, Wang is the chief of the First Section of the Education Department. According to the interpretation of the High Court's Interpretation No. 212, he should also be punished according to Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Party Member's Oath Violation Crime Regulations. According to Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed. Correspondingly, the case file, along with the two defendants, is sent for trial according to law. After receiving the prosecution, the plaintiff expressed dissatisfaction. Zhu Xifang said that the book is based on Wang Weijun's testimony, and no mention is made of the various doubts raised by our side regarding the evidence of being killed, the whereabouts of the bullet, and the entry of the gunshot wound. Our side does not recognize the reasons given and will continue to argue for the main points of being killed at the criminal court. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<p>Two Major Annual Conferences in the Chinese Academic World Recently (2)</p>
<p>丨The Science Society of China and the Chinese Society of Agronomy丨</p>
<p>The progress of science in recent centuries has made the abilities of the immortals, which we admired so much in the past, such as shrinking the earth, water escape, and flying through the clouds, all come true. Ordinary people can enjoy them and they are no longer surprising. Great machines tirelessly produce necessities for life for human use. Magnificent buildings stand tall on the ground for human habitation. All-powerful heat makes human hands and feet almost useless. The vast and boundless earth is shrunk into a ball. People live to their heart's content and obtain things to their heart's content. There are also new arts such as sculpture, painting, music, and dance to intoxicate their minds and delight their ears and eyes. In short, the world of science explores the treasures of the universe and extols the mysteries of the universe. People can use all things and are the masters of all things. The degree of progress of science and the degree of happiness of mankind are two parallel lines that develop in the same direction. The more advanced science is, the more abundant and fulfilling the lives of mankind will be. This kind of rich and fulfilling life is already widely enjoyed by progressive Caucasians and neighboring progressive Japanese, and they are striving to seek a richer and more fulfilling life. On the other hand, what about our country? Let's take the United States as an example. According to the statistics in "Several Fundamental Problems in the Chinese Question" by the American Arnold, China's land area is 4,278,000 square miles, but the railway line is only 7,000 miles and there are only 22,000 motorcycles. The land area of the United States is 3,743,500 square miles, while the railway line is 250,000 miles and there are 22,000,000 motorcycles. According to the Atlantic Monthly in March 1937, an American engineering expert said, "Every Chinese person has only one mechanical slave, while every American person has thirty mechanical slaves." People have already flown in the sky, while we are still crawling on the ground. People use machines as slaves, while we still use people as slaves. Shoulder poles and ropes, two hands and feet, and two shoulders – people are machines. The heavy sound of carts and the whirring of European and American machines echo each other from afar. When famine comes, we endure it. When disease comes, we endure it. When natural persecution comes, we endure it. If it is unbearable, we call upon the heavens. If the heavens are not responsive, we end it with death. Alas, in the same space and at the same time, one is in hell and the other is in heaven. The gap between people is so great. Where will the future of the country be? When will Mr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan be realized? When will the construction of 100,000 miles of railways be completed? All we see are white bones propping up the sky, blue blood covering the land, the wailing of guns and bullets, and the rising of poisonous atmosphere. The Soviet Union's five-year plan after the revolution has been gradually completed. Who can say that revolution only has destruction and no construction? Comparing others to ourselves, we are increasingly a lazy nation, a chaotic country. Where will the vast future be?</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Goes to Scotland for Recuperation</h3>
<p>The Labour Party Jointly Issues a Declaration Attacking the New Government and Macdonald's Policies</p>
<p>The Three Political Parties Will Hold Separate Meetings, with Both Parties Likely to Support Their Leaders' Actions</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th: At 7:20 PM tonight, British Prime Minister Macdonald left London for Scotland to recuperate at his home in Lossiemouth. Macdonald has been working very hard in the past few days.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th: The Labour Party has jointly issued a declaration attacking the new government and Macdonald's policies. The signatory is Henderson, and this article comes from the three major organs of the Labour Party, namely the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, and the advisory committee of the Labour Party. The basis of its attack is that it violates democracy, pointing out that the new government has not been entrusted by the people and wants to destroy the living standards of working families to meet the current situation created by the policies of private banks. It also accuses the government of trying to force a complete change in national policy simply because powerful financial circles do not want Britain to levy wealth taxes to help the poor, setting an example for other countries. It also stated that the financial crisis used as an excuse to cut social welfare expenses is not as serious as alarmists and propagandists say. Britain has great wealth and the people's ability to pay taxes is not exhausted. The declaration also listed methods to alleviate the current financial difficulties, stating that it is appropriate to (1) confiscate the foreign investments of the people, (2) temporarily suspend the payment of debt reserves, and (3) increase taxes on income from fixed-interest bonds and various unearned income. Macdonald's so-called equal sacrifice cannot be applied to workers. The Times criticized the above declaration, saying that the language of this declaration is so flawed that it is hardly worth refuting sentence by sentence.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th: The three political parties in Britain held separate meetings today to discuss the attitude that should be adopted towards the new government. The Conservatives and Liberals can both support the actions of their leaders. The attitude of the Labour Party is also beyond doubt, and it will inevitably be extremely opposed to the new government. However, how many opponents will there be during the meeting, and how many people in the Labour Party support its old leader is also worth noting. The Conservative Party met at 11:30 AM this morning, and Baldwin explained his reasons for joining the Macdonald government. The meeting may have slightly different opinions on irrelevant points, but those who agree with Baldwin's actions will undoubtedly account for the majority. The Liberal Party met at 11:00 AM, and the speakers will be Samuel, Reading, and Grey. It is expected that there will be no dissent. The Labour Party will meet from 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and it will inevitably pass a motion that the Labour Party is the official opposition party in Parliament, but the number of people who still support Macdonald may also be known from this.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th: Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden intends to abandon his political life after the current financial difficulties are resolved. Macdonald will not retire. Snowden declared today that he had told the Prime Minister in April that he intended to retire after the House of Commons passed the next fiscal year's budget and completed the huge bond conversion. However, in the face of the current international financial crisis, he felt that he could not retreat in the face of difficulties and was responsible for remaining in office. His intention to retire is unrelated to this political change. It is expected that the cabinet can gather all the materials on which the policies of the national government will be based tonight, and the cabinet members can begin to consider them at the end of this week. They now believe that when Parliament is convened on September 8, all plans can be formulated.</p>
<h3>The Troubles in Lisbon Have Been Calmed</h3>
<p>A Total of Fifty People Died and Three Hundred Were Injured</p>
<p>The Northern Provinces Are Still Isolated and Impassable</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 27th: A telephone message from Lisbon confirms that peace and tranquility have been restored in Portugal, but states that a total of fifty people died and three hundred were injured in the coup. The northern provinces are currently isolated and impassable, and censorship is strict. It is generally believed that there are occasional small battles between the government and the rebels, and the rebels are now fleeing north.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, 27th: Lisbon is calm today, but troops remain in camp to maintain order, and armored vehicles and tanks patrol the main roads without cease. It is feared that there may still be disturbances. According to official reports, all provinces and the navy participated in this rebellion, so it is difficult to know which departments are unstable at the moment.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 27th: As of the time of sending the telegram, four planes that participated in the Lisbon coup have escaped to Spain and landed, where they were confiscated by the authorities. These four planes were pursued to the Spanish border by the air force loyal to the Portuguese government. The pilots who escaped said that although President Carmona is enough for temporary stability, the people in many places are disgusted with Carmona's dictatorship, and the revolutionary movement has a prairie fire. The anti-dictatorship atmosphere in the north is particularly strong, and the entire gendarmerie sympathizes with the revolution.</p>
<h3>Great Progress Has Been Made in the Discussion of British and American Loans</h3>
<p>American Banks Are Willing to Lend a Large Sum</p>
<p>There Is a Saying That the French Loan Has Actually Been Negotiated</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 27th: According to the most special news, great progress has been made in the discussion of British government borrowing in the past 24 hours. A formal announcement can be expected tomorrow. The New York Evening Post reported that the banking community, led by Morgan, has agreed to a short-term loan of at least 300 million yuan for British use. Officials do not deny the truth of this statement, so it should be substantive. However, the amount of debt may be more than 300 million yuan. It is now known that American and French banks have agreed to lend a large sum to Britain, so the equalization of British gold will not be a problem. The amount of debt will be between 200 million yuan and 500 million yuan. It is also heard that a long-term loan of 500 million yuan will follow the short-term loan. The Huai Banking Community has not yet acknowledged the long-term loan. It is expected that the French banks will jointly borrow a large short-term loan with the American banks, and then the United States will undertake the long-term loan. If this debt is successful, the amount of debt will be very large. All parties indicate that American banks are willing to lend a large sum of money without any doubt, but it depends on whether the British government has safeguards to adopt austerity procedures.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th: London has not confirmed the rumors from New York about borrowing debts from the UK, but it is widely believed that this may be the case and that the crisis of the international price of British gold has now passed. Those who are currently negotiating with France are Ross of the US Treasury Department and Sippman of the Bank of England. The two had dinner with French Finance Minister Frandin in Paris yesterday, and Frandin met with the Chairman of the Banking Committee, the American Weber, for a long time. At the same time, the Bank of France had close contact with the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States during the negotiations.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 28th: According to a New York Times Washington correspondent, President Hoover has approved a loan of 80 million pounds to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 27th: French Finance Minister Frandin, President of the Bank of France Moret, Director of the Bank of England Lippmann, and representatives of the British Treasury Department held an important meeting here this afternoon to discuss the French bank's proposal to lend a long-term loan to the United Kingdom. According to financial sources, the loan amount is 100 million pounds. The French bank will leave a quarter of it to repay the French portion of the recent 50 million pound loan from France and the United States to the United Kingdom. It is also learned that the negotiations here are not very different in nature from those conducted by the British financial authorities with the New York Syndicate. The amount of the American loan is the same as the amount of the French loan, and the same method is adopted for repaying the recent American debt. However, it is heard that the organizational rules of the Federal Reserve System do not allow the use of funds to supply foreign banks, so British and American negotiations have encountered an obstacle.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 28th: The UK's borrowing has actually been negotiated at night and is expected to be signed today. The numbers rumored are different, about 80 million pounds to 100 million pounds, and it is also heard that the US borrowing part is also included, because this time it is also a joint loan from France and the United States, as was the recent loan to the Bank of England.</p>
<h3>Rumors of a Cabinet Reshuffle in Germany Are Rampant</h3>
<p>Brüning Holds Secret Talks with Opposition Leaders</p>
<p>The Political World and Newspapers Speculate in Many Ways</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th: Chancellor Brüning and Dr. Hugenberg, Chairman of the National People's Party, held a secret talk for two hours today. This is the first time that Brüning has met with the leader of the opposition party since the German financial crisis. However, no press release was issued, so the political world and newspapers speculated in many ways on the rumors of a cabinet reshuffle in Brüning. Conservative newspapers praised the possibility of National People's Party members joining the cabinet, but said that the results could not be announced at this time. It is said that Brüning will follow in the footsteps of the British Prime Minister and form a national government. The government's official newspaper believes that this is inaccurate.</p>

<h3>Fifteen Levee Breaches in Jiangdu and Gaoyou Counties in a Single Day</h3>
<p>Judging from the Ground Situation of the Two Counties, Over 5,000 People and Animals Drowned</p>
<p>Loss of Property Exceeds Several Million</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The water level of the Grand Canal had been decreasing daily, but unexpectedly, on the 25th, a strong wind and heavy rain persisted throughout the night. Although the wind subsided slightly the next day, the wind direction suddenly shifted from southeast to northwest, leading people to fear a levee breach. By 4 PM, the water level of the Grand Canal surrounding Yangzhou City suddenly dropped by two to three feet within an hour. Simultaneously, telegraph and telephone lines to Gaoyou and Shaobo were disrupted, indicating a potential breach upstream. By 6 PM, corpses and furniture flowed downstream in an endless stream. Soon after, disaster victims from Shaobo Town arrived in the city in a disheveled state. Only then was it learned that eleven breaches had occurred at Shaobo's Six Sluices and South Great King Temple in front of the Courier Station around 3 PM on the 26th. The collapsed areas of the levee ranged from ten to twenty zhang in each location, turning the entire Shaobo Town into a watery realm. Shaobo belongs to Jiangdu County and is only forty li from the city, serving as the gateway to the counties along the lower river. The town is a very prosperous commercial center with over three thousand households and a population of about thirty thousand. Upon receiving the news, emergency meetings were held by various sectors, including party officials, gentry, merchants, military, and police, at the Chamber of Commerce. The first step was to urgently prepare dry rations and mobilize ships to rush to the disaster area to rescue refugees clinging to rooftops and vines, braving the wind and dew. However, ships were difficult to gather at short notice because multiple breaches had also occurred along the shore of Guazhoukou on the same day, and most of the Grand Canal vessels had been concentrated there for rescue operations. Upon receiving the report, the Provincial Government immediately dispatched clerk Zhou Weichang and company commander Huang Silian with four small steamboats and eight tugboats to Yangzhou to assist in transporting disaster victims to safety. Early yesterday morning (27th), County Magistrate Chen, along with Wu and Hu, two supervisors of the County Party Headquarters, and An, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Yang, the district chief of the Eighth District, brought dry rations and took the Linfeng small steamboat to the disaster area to provide relief. The water current along the way was extremely turbulent, making it difficult even for steamships to navigate upstream. At 10 AM, the boat passed the Six Sluices, and District Chief Yang exclaimed that a breach had occurred there. Upon inspection, it was confirmed that five breaches, totaling forty to fifty zhang, had occurred within four to five li. Utility poles along the bank had all collapsed into the water, and houses near the breaches had been washed away, with only two to three feet of remaining walls. The water level inside and outside the levee differed by as much as six to seven feet, cascading down like a waterfall. Further south, near the South Great King Temple, there were four more breaches, each over ten zhang, with the force of the water even greater than before. Residents' houses had also been washed away. Further up the river lay Shaobo Town, where the catastrophic conditions defied description. Not a single house along the bank of several thousand households remained intact. Cries of anguish echoed throughout the area. After the boat docked, Wu Guansu, the supervisor of the town's Chamber of Commerce, and others gathered before County Magistrate Chen, weeping and reporting the plight of the victims. They then accompanied him to the levee, where, upon looking around, they saw a vast expanse of water. The town's essence had been submerged. County Magistrate Chen and others then waded through the water to the District Office, where the water was waist-deep. Piles of bricks and tiles stood like small islands in the river. Scattered boxes, rice, beans, and other waterlogged belongings were visible everywhere. Countless disaster victims were at the District Office, dressed in rags and looking emaciated, sitting on the ground. Their state was most pitiable. Later, they arrived at the Jiangdu section of the Grand Canal Engineering Works. According to Xie Runqing, a standing committee member of the town's Chamber of Commerce, a strong north wind arose on the morning of the 25th, and they immediately reported it to Shao Fuchen, the chief of the engineering works section, who said that the Grand Canal banks were quite sturdy and there should be no accidents. The wind became stronger in the afternoon, shifting to a west wind, and heavy rain caused waves to surge in the river, reaching over ten feet high and crashing directly against the Grand Canal levee. Villagers immediately sounded gongs to warn of danger. Xiao Shaoyuan, the director of the local Public Security Sub-bureau, believed that the gonging was disruptive to public order and should not cause alarm. Around 3 PM, a section of the Datong Company wharf gave way, and sections north of the South Great King Temple also began to collapse one after another. Although they wanted to fill the breaches, there were no materials available. At that time, Chief Shao had disappeared. Moreover, the rain and wind were exceptionally strong. Villagers living on the levee saw the waves were too high and could not protect it. Most of the other residents were at home sheltering from the rain and did not expect the breaches to happen so quickly. As a result, thousands of people drowned. According to reports from Wu and others at the local Chamber of Commerce, eighty to ninety people died near the Meida Petroleum wharf, and hundreds died in the South Rice Market. More than a thousand people died when the buildings they were sheltering in collapsed into the water. In addition, the number of people drowned in various villages was not included in these figures. In addition to County Magistrate Chen entrusting the Chamber of Commerce to distribute the five large sacks of dry rations he had brought, he also personally requested the local garrison to work with local people to charter multiple civilian boats to Hougong to rescue disaster victims clinging to trees and rooftops as soon as possible, and to prepare food to distribute to destitute victims. At 6 PM, County Magistrate Chen and others returned to Yangzhou on the same boat. In Yangzhou, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Jingting, emergency relief advocate Dai Xingyi, and others established multiple shelters and urgently telegraphed the Construction Department to close the breaches. The chairman also persuaded merchants to prepare bread for relief. At the time of drafting this report, the floodwaters had already spread to Xinghua and other counties. The scale of the disaster is imaginable. In Gaoyou County, four breaches also occurred on the same day. On the first night of the breaches (25th), prisoners escaped from the Gaoyou County jail, and gunfire echoed throughout the city as they tried to capture the escapees. Although the northwest wind was strong at that time, most people dared not go to the levee to work due to fear of stray bullets. By 12 AM, water had entered the city through the north gate, and people knew the levee had given way and immediately went outside. In a short while, the water in the central market area was more than two chi deep. The Yuting Flour Company had already been washed away by the water. Although sacks were used to block the water gate, they were ineffective. Mao Yisheng, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and Li Zhong, the chief of the Public Works Section, had disappeared one after another. County Magistrate Wang Long and his wife had just boarded the Jialu warship when they were stopped by the people and unable to leave. Three members of the County Party Headquarters had already fled to Yangzhou, reporting the disaster. The north gate of the county seat had been closed, while the south gate, being on higher ground, was still passable. According to the County Party Headquarters members who came to Yangzhou, over one thousand people and animals had been killed or injured in the city alone. As of last night (27th), six to seven hundred victims from Gaoyou had arrived in Yangzhou. Upon receiving the warning, the Huai River Conservancy Commission specially dispatched Commissioner Zhuang Songfu from Beijing to the north, arriving in Yangzhou last night. He is scheduled to go to Shaobo, Gaoyou, Binying, and the area along the lower river this morning (28th) to inspect the disaster situation to prepare for emergency relief. It is also reported that the Office of the Governor-General has ordered the 94th Brigade stationed in Yangzhou to quickly dispatch a team to work with party officials, gentry, and merchants to close the breaches to prevent the levee from collapsing further.

<h3>Provincial Government Meeting on Emergency Relief After Grand Canal Mishap in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since the opening of the Cheluo Dam, the water volume of the Grand Canal has only receded to a limited extent. On the night of the 25th, a strong northwest wind arose, followed by showers and lake waves. The Yu Matou, Seven Gong Dian, and Zinian in Gaoyou were washed away, and water flowed from the dike into Hedong. The levees near the Zhaoguan Dam and South Great King Temple in Shaobo collapsed, affecting hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. Those who could not escape were washed away by the water. Fortunately, those who survived were clinging to treetops and rooftops, waiting for boats to rescue them. This is a disaster of unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>Statements from Water Conservancy Bureau Officials: Pei Yixiang, the chief engineer of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, and Li Zhongqiang, the director of the Gaobao section of the Grand Canal Engineering Works, returned to the province from Gaoyou yesterday to report on the situation. They stated that the Gaoyou area was hit by wind and rain all day, and they supervised the staff day and night to protect the dikes, which fortunately did not fail. However, by the evening of the following day, the wind became stronger, and the river water was stirred up by waves, reaching over a zhang high. The newly built Zinian was completely washed away. At the Xingchang Gongji wharf, Yu Matou, and Seven Gong Dian in Gaoyou, the dike body was washed over by water in three locations. They immediately sent people to transport materials to reinforce the dike, but the wind and waves became stronger and it was impossible to stand on the dike, making it impossible to work. In an instant, the offices were flooded by several feet of water. The situation developed rapidly, and they had no choice but to hurriedly board a ship. Countless houses on the dike and boats of all sizes along the dike were washed away by the wind and waves. Outside Gaoyou City, there was a vast expanse of water, with turbulent currents beyond description. Since reinforcement was impossible and all postal and telecommunications services were cut off, they had no choice but to risk opening a steamship at 6 AM on the 27th to return to the province to report and request instructions. There were also multiple accidents in Shaobo Zhaoguan Dam, etc. The whereabouts of more than twenty on-site workers are unknown.</p>
<p>Emergency Relief from Various Provincial Departments: The Shipping Association was the first to receive the news of the Shaobo levee breach. Tao Shoubo, along with Tan Peiyan, Bao Mingshu, Tao Jiewu, and others, went to the Provincial Government to meet with Chairman Ye. Ye was in Nanjing, so they met with Secretary-General Jin and informed him of the dike breach. Various groups planned to send people for rescue and requested assistance from the Provincial Government. Jin agreed to handle it. Subsequently, they discussed with the Department of Civil Affairs, where they learned that Director Sun, Section Chief Li Baoan, and Leng Yuqiu were already holding a meeting at the Water Conservancy Bureau. They decided to raise 10,000 yuan in cash. The Provincial Government dispatched Zhou Mengliu, the Department of Civil Affairs dispatched Lu Haishan, and the Public Security Bureau dispatched Xue Shenzhen, leading ten armed police officers and ten members of the Provincial Guard, with 5,000 yuan used to purchase food and 5,000 yuan in cash. Attached to the emergency relief group's small steamboat, they departed last night. In the afternoon yesterday, Li Mingyang, the director of the Security Department, also took a platoon of soldiers on the Xinhongda steamboat to the north.</p>
<p>Emergency Relief from Zhenjiang Business Circles: The levee breach occurred suddenly. After receiving the news, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce temporarily consulted with the Shipping Association to first allocate boats for rescue and requested volunteer staff from the Red Swastika Society to lead the ships separately in order to distribute food and rescue people in the disaster area. A total of fifty shi of rice, Jiang Dabing (a type of cake), sesame cakes, and baked wheat cakes were prepared, emptying the city's entire wheat flour supply. Last night, a total of four small steamboats and six tugboats were dispatched. This morning, two more steamboats and four tugboats were dispatched. However, since ten Zhenjiang small steamboats were already on duty in Jiangxi, there were not many left. It is imperative to ask the Provincial Government to transfer small steamboats from other ports for duty. (August 28th)</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Water Level Stabilizes</h3>
<p>The Hubei Branch of the Flood Relief Association Officially Established</p>
<p>Emergency Relief Association Sends Zhu Huaibing and Others to Beijing to Petition for Relief Funds</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wuhan has been submerged by floods for a month, and the water level has gradually stabilized. However, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are severely congested, and the water level cannot recede quickly. The people have been immersed in water for a long time, and it is still unknown when they will be able to escape the waves and walk on dry land. The central government is concerned about the disaster victims and is working hard to provide relief. Special commissioners for disaster investigation and relief are constantly on their way. Local authorities are also doing their best to help. Their efforts will hopefully provide a lifeline for the disaster victims. The recent situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Disaster Survey and Relief Work Extremely Busy: The Central Relief Committee telegraphed the Hubei Flood Emergency Relief Association on the 27th, stating that it had worked with the Ministry of Interior to send special commissioners and engineers to Hankou to survey the disaster and coordinate relief efforts. The Shanghai Jisheng Association also invited Zhu Qichen to Hankou to assist in relief distribution. The US$100,000 in relief funds from the American Red Cross will also be claimed by the American consul and transferred to relief organizations. Regarding disease prevention, in addition to provincial and municipal hospitals organizing mobile clinics and sending doctors and nurses with adequate medicines and materials to various disaster areas, the Flood Emergency Relief Association, various relief associations, and the Red Cross are also providing relief and establishing hospitals in various refugee shelters. If there are infectious diseases, they will be isolated and treated. Now that the water has been flooded for many days, the number of refugees suffering from illness is increasing day by day. Fortunately, effective treatment is being provided, and deaths are still low. In addition, the temporary mobile hospital set up by the Jianguo Shipping Company has also begun to provide medical care.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Branch Officially Established: The National Government's Flood Relief Committee decided to establish a branch in Hankou because Hubei suffered the most severe disaster. The site has been found at the Municipal First Girls' Middle School in Special District Two, and Chinese and foreign individuals have been hired as committee members. The association was formally established. The first formal meeting was held on the morning of the 27th, where the organizational regulations were approved and the seal was put into use. At the regular meeting of the Flood Emergency Relief Association on the 26th, it was decided to send four committee members, Zhu Huaibing, Wen Juntian, Zhou Xingtang, and Wang Yiling, to Beijing to report on the disaster situation and request additional funds. Zhu and others took the Longhe steamship east on the evening of the 27th.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Disaster Victims from Various Counties Coming to Hankou: The Wuhan Flood Prevention Office submitted a report to the Garrison Headquarters on the 27th, requesting that refugees from other counties be prohibited from coming to Hankou to avoid disrupting public order. The document stated: "It has been observed that refugees from various counties upstream of Wuhan have been gathering in groups and traveling downstream in boats. In the Heishan area of Hanyang, more than 10,000 refugees have gathered, including people of all ages and backgrounds. This office has followed your orders to focus on the city's public order and has previously requested you to order the counties upstream to prevent refugees from traveling downstream and to provide shelter and relief locally. We have also sent letters to the Provincial Government and the Emergency Relief Association to jointly send personnel to various counties to provide relief and ordered the Wuhan Fortress Command to strictly prevent refugees from entering the fortress area. Recently, the Hubei Maritime Public Security Bureau reported that over forty boats carrying four to five hundred men and women refugees have arrived at the Huangjingtang River and have been anchored in Heishan awaiting relief after strict inspection. (Omission) We propose that the military and political organs in each county be ordered to strictly prevent people from leaving the country to prevent the source. Otherwise, the more people gather, the more serious the problem will be if there is a shortage of supplies, which will have a great impact on public order."</p>
<p>Major Fire During the Great Flood: During this serious flood, no fires had occurred. Unexpectedly, at 2:30 PM on the 27th, the Texaco Petroleum Depot near the Japanese concession caught fire due to excessive boiler heat, causing a major fire. Black smoke obscured the sky, and the fire was fierce. Although the Garrison Headquarters, security team, and fire brigade tried their best to extinguish it, the deep water and large fire made rescue difficult, and it could not be extinguished. (The reporter drafted this letter while the fire was still burning) However, most of the nearby residents have been rescued. It is reported that the depot stored more than 450,000 boxes of kerosene, with losses estimated at over 2 million yuan. Other losses and casualties are still under investigation. This is another tragedy in the flood. (August 27th)</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Arrives in Hankou</h3>
<p>Exchanges Relief Ideas with He Chengjun and Others</p>
<p>Announces Relief Proposals for Both Short-Term and Long-Term Solutions</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhu Qinglan, a member of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, arrived in Hankou by postal plane from Shanghai at 2 PM on the 27th. He was accompanied by Zhang Yuanshan, the director-general of the China International Famine Relief Commission, and Zha Liangzhao. Zhu and others stayed at the Deming Hotel. In the evening, he personally visited various refugee shelters. That night, he held a discussion at 38 Huangpi Road with He Chengjun, the director of the Garrison Headquarters, Xu Yuanquan, the director of Flood Prevention, and Xia Douyin, the assistant director, to exchange ideas. They have largely decided on the relief policy and will implement it after Zhu returns to Shanghai on the 28th. According to Zhu's remarks on relief, he had recently returned to Ping from Shaanxi and stopped in Baoding for two days. After arriving in Shanghai, he learned of the unprecedented flood in Hubei Province and was appointed by the National Government's Flood Relief Association as the director of the disaster area working group, responsible for coordinating the work in the disaster areas of various provinces. Therefore, he made a special trip to Hankou. After arriving in Hankou, he witnessed a vast expanse of water, and the people's suffering was greater than elsewhere. The only way to provide relief is to use a large amount of funds for large-scale relief. He recalled that when he was in Nantong in the seventh year of the Republic, he discussed with Zhang Jian and other water conservancy experts, who all believed that the Yangtze River was severely congested, and if it was not dredged, Hankou would be destroyed by floods in thirty years. Although this year's flood was unexpected, it was actually within the realm of possibility. Therefore, the current plan should be to rush to provide emergency relief to save lives, and to cultivate the people's vitality to restore and increase their production capacity, while implementing various disaster prevention plans, focusing on water conservancy, resettlement, etc., as fundamental relief. Therefore, my opinion on the Wuhan flood is that in terms of short-term measures, we must first shelter the refugees, remove the floodwaters, and implement epidemic prevention.</p>
<h2>Page 13</h2>
<p>Brief news</p>
<p>And in terms of long-term measures, we should pay attention to agricultural and industrial relief. Agricultural relief includes purchasing a large number of seeds, farm tools, cattle, etc., and supplying them to disaster victims at fair prices, or lending or giving them to disaster victims so that they can engage in agriculture and agriculture can develop as a result. Industrial relief includes dredging the Huai River, dredging the Yangtze River, repairing dikes, etc., all done by disaster victims. Taking dredging the Huai River as an example, it should not enter the Yangtze River but should enter the sea to prevent the Yangtze River from overflowing and affecting Beijing and Shanghai. However, this project is very large, and the cost will be relatively high. If disaster victims are used for work-for-relief, it will be a win-win situation. As for the Yangtze River, large-scale dredging is urgently needed, and the dikes along the river should be repaired at the same time, all of which can be done using disaster victims to complete major constructions. After contacting the local authorities here, I will return to Shanghai to present it to the conference so that a concrete decision can be made and fully implemented. Another disaster relief bond has been approved by the Legislative Yuan to issue 80 million yuan, approximately 30 million for purchasing rice and wheat, and 50 million for industrial relief, as a plan to address both short-term and long-term needs. (August 27th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu River Embankment Collapses</h3>
<p>Last night, a hurricane suddenly arose here. Countless houses that had been submerged in water for a long time were destroyed by the wind and waves and collapsed. The terrain of the Henan River Embankment was originally high, and many disaster victims had built sheds on it to avoid the water. Unexpectedly, at night, the river embankment could not withstand the huge waves and suddenly collapsed for more than ten zhang. The disaster victims had no time to escape, and dozens of people died. More than a dozen bodies have been found this morning. In addition, the telephone lines on Zhongshan Road and Wan'an Road were damaged by the wind and fell on the power lines due to disrepair, causing the telephones to be in chaos. Two boats happened to be passing by, and four passengers and drivers were electrocuted at the same time. Soon after, the lights went out, and the whole of Wuhu was in darkness. Defense has been strengthened. Due to the importance of local public order in recent days and the fact that the police salary could not be collected due to the flood, and the rent of houses and shops could not be collected, which had a great impact, a local public security maintenance association was specially formed to discuss public order policies and raise public funds.</p>
<p>Since the province has been hit by severe floods, the provincial government has issued a clear order to prohibit transportation out of the province in order to maintain the people's food supply. Unexpectedly, a small number of merchants in Wuhu have recently smuggled goods out of the province in the name of military rice, causing rice prices to skyrocket to more than thirteen yuan. The Public Security Bureau is now closely guarding against this. (Above, August 26th)</p>
<p>Business News: The Datong Public Security Bureau, for some unknown reason, had a major conflict with the Chamber of Commerce there yesterday, and arrested Huang Deji, the former chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce. The business community and the police exchanged gunfire. The entire business community is still on strike. The provincial government has received a telegram and has sent personnel to investigate and deal with the matter.</p>
<p>In recent years, robberies of merchant ships have occurred frequently on the Yangtze River and inland rivers in Anhui Province. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs has received frequent appeals from all parties, recognizing that this is a major matter for public security in the province. The Department has ordered the Provincial Ship Management Office and the county governments and public security bureaus of Wuhu and Datong to promptly select special commissioners to hold a conference on detailed water joint defense measures. The Wuhu County Government will be the meeting location, and the Wuhu County Magistrate will convene the meeting. Detailed measures will be prepared and reviewed within ten days of the arrival of the document.</p>
<p>The Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce believes that the flood in Wuhu this year is extremely severe, with disaster victims gathering, and emergency relief is urgent. All industries are eating into their capital and have no business income. However, the business tax collection office is still firmly implementing the orders of the department and urging the payment of taxes, which is not in line with the way to show compassion for disaster victims and attach importance to people's livelihood. The Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Department of Finance to request that the business tax be exempted to show benevolence. Last night at 7 PM, a major fire broke out in Simatou Street across from the Public Security Bureau. The water was more than two chi deep in the area, making it difficult to move the fire hoses, causing the fire to burn for three hours. More than thirty shops, including the Xu Shunxing General Merchandise Store, were destroyed, causing heavy losses. The Public Security Bureau was also in great danger, but fortunately, the security team and the fire hoses were effective in rescuing the area and preventing it from being affected. (Above, August 27th)</p>
<h3>Disaster Victims Cross Jinan to Go Beyond the Border</h3>
<p>More Than 120 Residents from Guoyang East Village, Anhui Province, Cross the Border</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The floods in Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces are severe, and there are many disaster victims. Today (26th) at 8:40 AM, train number 8 on the Jinpu Railway arrived in Jinan from Xuzhou, carrying a large number of flood refugees who got off at Jinan Station, preparing to go beyond the border to seek a livelihood. Hu, an engineer at the Jinpu Station, used the telephone to notify the Jinan Branch of the Red Swastika Society to provide relief. The association sent Wu Weizhi and Wang Lingji, two members of the relief team, to conduct a count. There were a total of 129 men and women refugees, all residents of Guoyang East Village, Anhui Province. The association prepared 300 catties of steamed buns, giving each person two catties to relieve their hunger. According to the refugees, all the houses had been submerged. They had fled from Guoyang to Xuzhou and came to Jinan by train from Xuzhou without tickets, preparing to go outside the border to earn a living. There were still many people waiting for trains in Xuzhou who would cross Jinan to go beyond the border soon. They were all extremely sad. The Jinan Red Swastika Society immediately contacted the Jinan Station today and transported the refugees to Tianjin by train on the Jinpu Railway at 2 PM free of charge. The association also telegraphed the Tianjin Red Swastika Society to prepare food and take care of everything at the station. (August 26th)</p>

<p>Incidents Found in Chao Cheng, Qihe, and Various Counties</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Following the Central Army's encirclement and resolution of Liu Guitang's remnants from Daming, Liu Guitang managed to break through with only about a thousand men. This morning (the 26th), a force of over a hundred (some say over two hundred, reportedly including Liu Guitang) fleeing soldiers suddenly infiltrated the vicinity of Malingji, Chao Cheng County, Shandong Province, demanding supplies from the local populace. Rong Guangxing of the 87th Brigade, stationed in Chao Cheng, immediately telegraphed Jinan this morning, reporting everything to Sun Tongxuan, the acting Commander of the Third Route Army. Upon receiving the report, Sun immediately telegraphed Li Xuande's cavalry brigade and Chen Dexin's 86th Brigade, both positioned between Guantao and Daming, ordering them to pursue and intercept the fleeing soldiers. He also instructed Rong Guangxing's brigade to send a unit to intercept them. The fleeing soldiers, under interception, have mostly fled southwest. It is expected that the situation will be completely resolved within the day. It is also heard that Cao Fulin, the Commander of the Third Army Corps, telegraphed Jinan, reporting the discovery of bandits near Linqing. Whether these bandits are also Liu's troops who fled from Daming remains unclear. Besides ordering Chen Dexin's brigade in Guantao and Li Hanzhang's brigade in Dezhou to dispatch units to block them, Cao himself went from Guantao to Linqing yesterday to supervise the suppression, preventing them from harassing the local area.</p>
<p>Following the resolution of Shi Yousan's forces, fleeing soldiers and deserters are causing trouble everywhere. The other day, a gang of bandits, numbering over two hundred, was discovered in Zhangqiu and Qidong Taizi and other places. They came from Hebei Province and were fully armed. After crossing the river from Qidong, Zhangqiu, upon receiving the alert, closed all four gates to prepare for defense. Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 20th Division, upon receiving the news, immediately dispatched units stationed in Zhoucun to intercept them. The bandits suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked.</p>
<p>Taizi Town, north of Qidong County, is the wealthiest area in the county, representing the essence of the entire county. A few days ago, over three hundred bandits suddenly entered from Shandong and occupied the town, committing rape, pillage, and all sorts of atrocities. Before leaving, they kidnapped over sixty men and women, claiming that each person could be redeemed for five hundred yuan, and that they should go to Zhangqiu County to redeem them. They warned that if it was not done within a week, they would tear up the tickets. The Qidong County Magistrate, along with the police forces of neighboring counties and the Zhangqiu County Magistrate, are jointly launching a vigorous campaign to eradicate them as soon as possible, disregarding jurisdictional boundaries.</p>
<p>Shi Yousan's remnants who came to Shandong are planned to be merged into Zhan Shutang's 58th Brigade of the 20th Division, expanding Zhan's brigade into a division with Zhan as the division commander. Chairman Han telegraphed the central government for instructions. It is heard that the provincial government received a telegram from the central government yesterday, approving the proposed reorganization. The unit will retain the designation of the 73rd Division.

<h3>Negotiating the Qingdao Incident</h3>
<p>Both Sides' Opinions Are Generally Approaching, Japanese Acting Consul Expresses Regret</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Regarding the case of Japanese residents killing Chinese people in this city, the municipal government has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Consul in Qingdao, and both sides are showing signs of reaching a peaceful resolution. After this case occurred, the municipal government immediately made serious representations to the Japanese Consulate in Qingdao, making five demands: (1) The Japanese Consulate should express its apologies; (2) The perpetrators should be identified and punished; (3) The violent organization, the National Essence Society, should be disbanded; (4) Guarantees should be made that such incidents will not occur again in the future; (5) Regarding the victims, after the investigation is completed, the responsible party should bear the compensation. At the same time, the Japanese side also made unreasonable demands. After serious representations from our side, both sides sent personnel to investigate the truth of the incident and the extent of the injuries. The Japanese side then realized that they were in the wrong and were somewhat willing to comply. Regarding the second item proposed by our side, they have agreed to conduct a thorough investigation. Regarding the third item, they have agreed to give it full consideration. On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, at 3 PM, Hu Jiafeng, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, formally met with Hori, the Acting Consul-General of Japan in Qingdao, at the International Club. At that time, Acting Consul Hori stated that the incident had injured many innocent Chinese people, which he deeply regretted, and expressed his strong desire for a peaceful resolution. At the same time, he requested the municipal government to pay attention to maintaining law and order in the future. Hu replied that the unfortunate occurrence of this incident had affected the local law and order in the city, which was truly regrettable. As for maintaining law and order, it was the responsibility of the municipal government and would naturally be taken care of. However, he sincerely hoped that the Consul-General would effectively inform the Japanese residents to respect local law and order. Hori indicated his agreement. The opinions of both sides are gradually converging. However, the main principles and methods of resolution are still under discussion. The outcome will be reported later. (24th)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan's Troops Gather in Hedong</h3>
<p>Various Counties Request to Use Taxes and Grain as Collateral for Military Expenses</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Song Zheyuan's troops stationed in the Hedong area, after receiving orders to move their defenses, requisitioned vehicles from various counties to transport their supplies. However, the troops stationed in Linjin, Yishi, Yongji, An'yi, and other counties, after concentrating in Yuncheng, suddenly stalled and did not depart. As a result, various shops and residences were occupied, and as many as several thousand military vehicles were parked in the suburbs. They were exposed to the sun and dew, and supplies were not unloaded, nor were the horses unharnessed. The amount of supplies, team wages, and military needs provided by the village chiefs of various counties is truly alarming. The people are impoverished and unable to scrape together any more. They have no choice but to request that taxes and grain be used as collateral for loans. Representatives from Hedong and others are planning to request the provincial government to approve this loan as an official expense to alleviate the people's hardships. The following is a transcript of Jing Meijiu's telegram to Xue Xiuqing and Jing Juxiang: "Currently, Song's troops are deploying, and troops from other counties are gathering in Yuncheng and An'yi. The daily expenditure on supplies and team wages is excessively high. Moreover, the recent collection of carts and flour from the people has been exhausted. We are unable to collect any more. The people are reluctantly requesting the county magistrates to use taxes and grain as collateral to borrow money to meet urgent needs. This expenditure, regardless of the county, should be treated as an official expense. Please ask the provincial government for approval and announce it clearly to reassure the people and avoid any mishaps. This telegram expresses the urgency of our situation." (22nd)</p>
<h3>Tragic Accident of Xiang Airplane "Morse"</h3>
<p>Due to the Installation of Floats for Testing</p>
<p>Hu Yu, Section Chief of the Aviation Bureau, Dies</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The establishment of the Hunan Aviation Bureau was achieved after He Jian repeatedly petitioned the central government. Considering that the communist threat had not yet been extinguished, efforts were made to perfect the aviation facilities, striving to make the combat equipment, the installation of floats, and the arrival of anti-aircraft artillery units in Hunan as robust as possible to consolidate Hunan's defense. Therefore, the Aviation Bureau spared no effort in expanding and improving its facilities. Who would have known that this would result in the tragic accident of the "Morse" airplane, in which Aviation Affairs Section Chief Hu Yu was drowned? This is a great misfortune for the aviation in Hunan Province. The details of the accident are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Accident: The Hunan Aviation Bureau has four airplanes, all for land use. Occasionally, due to flooding or prolonged rain and snow, the airfield would be submerged, making takeoff difficult and hindering military operations. The bureau then planned to install floats to enable amphibious operations. The first aircraft to be fitted was the "Morse" airplane. At 1:00 PM on the 21st, the installation was completed. According to aviation practice, test flights should be piloted by key personnel. The test flight of this aircraft was originally planned to be piloted by Aviation Bureau Director Huang Fei and Repair Factory Director Lin An. However, as they were about to board, Aviation Affairs Section Chief Hu Yu suddenly volunteered and jumped ahead of Huang to get on the plane first. Huang, considering Hu's important position in aviation affairs and his good technical skills, did not stop him. The "Morse" aircraft took off from Xinhekou near the airfield. At an altitude of about four feet above the water, the aircraft suddenly encountered an obstruction, and the plane overturned into the water. Hu, who was sitting behind Lin, jumped out of the plane and floated in the river waiting for rescue. However, the river current was too swift, and the rescue boat could not reach him in time. Hu floated to a point about thirty feet away and then sank into the water. After an hour, his body was retrieved with a net five miles downstream. He had been dead for some time and could not be saved.</p>
<p>Lin An Escaped Danger: When the "Morse" aircraft overturned into the river, the nose went into the water first, followed by the fuselage. After Hu fell into the water, Lin, who was sitting in the front of the plane, also fell into the water. With the cabin door closed and the seatbelt entangled, the situation was extremely dangerous. However, Lin remained calm and unfastened the seatbelt, opened the cabin door, climbed onto the roof of the plane, and was rescued by a boat, thus narrowly escaping death. He can be considered lucky.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Deceased: Hu, known as Songyun, was 23 years old and a native of Shaoyang, Hunan (i.e., Baoqing). He graduated from the German Aviation School in France and served as a member of the Fengtian Aviation Team, an aviator in the Central Aviation Bureau in Beiping, and a pilot in the First Aviation Team of the Ministry of Military Affairs. He was currently serving as the Colonel Section Chief of the Aviation Affairs Section of the Hunan Aviation Bureau. His unfortunate death is a loss to the aviation community in Hunan. After Hu's body was retrieved, it was sent to the nearby First Girls' Vocational School machine shop for encoffining. His new wife, Ms. Deng Shuying, was notified and told that Mr. Hu was injured during a test flight. Deng believed it to be true and brought cigarettes and dried plums to the machine shop to visit him. When she arrived at the machine shop and saw Hu's body lying there, she called out to him repeatedly without response and was overwhelmed with grief. She was so distraught that she wanted to die. The wives of the Aviation Bureau's staff members tried to comfort her in every way possible before she finally stopped her grief. When Hu's body was encoffined, a fine silk-lined nanmu coffin was used, and the ceremony was extremely grand. All the staff members of the bureau participated in the encoffining ceremony, weeping and wailing. At the same time, a request was submitted to the Fourth Route Headquarters for posthumous promotion.

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Losses from the Gale and Torrential Rain: In the Thirteenth District (Zhangze), a hurricane suddenly arose on the evening of the 24th of this month, intensifying at night. The next morning, it rained. The wind and rain were unprecedented in recent decades, lasting for a day and night. Low-lying rice seedlings were completely submerged. Even in high-lying fields, the accumulated water could not be drained, leaving only the tips of the bean and cotton plants exposed. If the water does not recede soon, the crops will rot, and the harvest will be a cause for great concern. Where the gale passed, eight or nine out of ten rural sheds were blown down. Houses collapsing were not uncommon. In Xishi Town, the fire wall of the Xu family was blown down by more than ten feet. In Tujiatai, Xu A'hu's house collapsed, killing his old mother. Chen Qizhang, the district chief, went to the countryside to inspect and reported the disaster to the county government.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Tragedy in the Gale and Torrential Rain: In the Fourth District, Shazhou, the eastern town of Lailai, across the river is Nantong County. To the west of the town is Qingzhu Town, located along the river mouth, with about dozens of households. During the gale and torrential rain a few days ago, the river waves rolled onto the banks, and nearby houses were all destroyed. Because the residents were unable to defend against the disaster at night, countless numbers were drowned in the water. According to reports from the area, most of the town's residents were drowned, a tragic sight. It is also reported that dozens of fishing boats from Jiangbei were docked at Gengjingkou, Wangshi, Fushan District. When the gale struck, more than twenty people from Jiangbei were rowing boats near Tiehuangsha, harvesting sorghum. While they were harvesting, the gale and torrential rain suddenly occurred, and the tide completely submerged the area. All the people from Jiangbei were drowned in the water. People were dispatched to salvage the bodies, but only eleven were recovered. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Hurricane, Gale, Torrential Rain, and River Tide Cause Disaster: Since the hurricane suddenly arose in this county on the 25th, it was followed by heavy rain that did not stop until the evening. Many telegraph poles inside and outside the city were blown down, electric lights were extinguished, telephones were out of service, and several telegraph wires were broken. On the 26th, the electric light and telephone companies dispatched a large number of workers to repair the damage, and the service was fully restored. Telephone service in the countryside has not yet been fully restored. Due to the flooding of the Yangtze River, the east and west dikes north of the city were flooded, and the floodwaters reached the Puhui Bridge area. The surrounding fields of Junshan were completely submerged. As of yesterday afternoon (26th), the tide had receded, and the farmers were building embankments to protect their fields. The rice in the fields had already formed ears, and the submergence caused severe damage. Water and land transportation, such as Chengxi long-distance buses and express boats, were suspended due to the hurricane and rain. Today (27th), the weather is clear, with no wind or rain, and normal traffic has resumed.</p>
<p>Verdict Announced in Counter-Revolutionary Case: Xing Songwen, the former district chief of the First District, Xu Yan, the district assistant, and Zhou Qiujiang, Xu Laowu, and others, who were suspected of counter-revolutionary activities, were brought to a provisional court by the county group on the 22nd for final interrogation. The verdict was announced on the 26th. Xing Songwen, Zhou Qiujiang, and Xu Laowu were found not guilty. Xu Yan was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment according to the Republic of China's Emergency Law for Punishing Criminals.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Cases of Plunder by Land and Water in Rural Areas: Recently, the atmosphere of banditry has been unsettled in Wuxi, with cases of robbery occurring in the city and countryside. Two more cases of robbery occurred in the past two days. The details are as follows: (1) At the home of Zheng Ziqing, a villager in Zhengjiadan Village near Meili in the Fourth District (Kaiyuan Township), more than ten bandits suddenly arrived on the previous night, scaled the walls, and broke into the house, tying up the women of the Zheng family. Ziqing's son, Rong Baochunyuan, both hid on the roof. Rong then rushed to the Ninth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to report. Feng Bangyan, the patrol chief of the First Police Station, led officers to pursue the bandits, but the bandits had already left. They first rescued the women who had been tied up and then tracked down the bandits. They suddenly heard gunshots from the top of Xishan Mountain being fired downwards. It was already late at night, and there was no way to climb the mountain. They waited until dawn and rushed up the mountain, but the bandits had already disappeared. They returned in frustration. (2) On the previous day, a Qingyang boat traveling from Qingyang to Wuxi was passing through Baitangwei when a boat suddenly appeared from the opposite direction, riding the waves and approaching. People on the boat saw from the dim moonlight that they were not good people and tried to escape, but the approaching boat was already near. A bandit at the bow of the boat, holding a pistol, jumped onto the Qingyang boat. A total of four bandits boarded the boat. First, they grabbed the boat owner, Yu Jugen, by the throat to prevent him from making any noise, and then they searched the boat at will. No passengers were spared. After half an hour, they left with their loot, totaling about three hundred yuan. A report has been filed with the county court requesting their arrest.</p>
<p>Judgment on Opium Dens in Guanqian Street: Wu Zhengrong, the Chief of Political Police of the County Government, led the police officers a few days ago and busted two opium dens in Guanqian Street in the city, arresting twenty-six opium offenders, including Tang Zhuyin (also known as Tang Laosan). They were handed over to the county court for prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Yang Jin separately announced the verdicts of Tang Zhuyin and twelve others in court. Tang Zhuyin was sentenced to one year and one month of imprisonment and fined 500 yuan. Tang A'kui (also known as Tang Zhuping) was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment and fined 200 yuan. Wu Zhiting was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined 500 yuan (all of the above were opium den owners).</p>
<p>Chen Jinji (a detective from the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau who protected the opium dens) was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. However, Chen claimed in court that he was not satisfied with the verdict and would appeal. Zhu Lin was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment and fined 50 yuan. Zhang A'si was sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Chen Jinsheng was sentenced to one month of imprisonment and fined 20 yuan. Xi Yunlin was sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Cao A'da was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, suspended for two years, and released on bail. Zhang A'fu was sentenced to one month of imprisonment and fined 20 yuan. Gong Hong was sentenced to one month of imprisonment and fined 100 yuan. Hua Yin was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment and fined 100 yuan. After the verdicts were announced, they were ordered to be sent to prison.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance Pays Attention to the Budgets of Various Counties After the Flooding: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has historically calculated the income from local budgets, busy canal taxes, and surcharges in various counties based on the average number of actual collections over the past three years. However, since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rainfall has caused disasters, with nearly nine-tenths of the counties in the province affected. The future harvest will inevitably be greatly reduced. However, the local budgets of various counties were either submitted for approval before the disaster occurred or, despite the reporting of the disaster, they were still bound by conventions and continued to allocate funds based on the average income of the past three years. In the future, revenue will be insufficient to cover expenses, and it will inevitably be necessary to borrow from the provincial treasury and special funds. The result will inevitably be financial difficulties for both the province and the counties, which will have a significant impact. Rather than waiting for the situation to become desperate, it is better to provide relief in advance. Therefore, yesterday, a special order was issued to all counties stating that if the local budget for this year had been submitted for approval before the disaster occurred, it should be promptly submitted to the county government for discussion and a substantial reduction in the expenditures, or a reduced budget should be recompiled and submitted to the department for record-keeping. Those that have not yet been approved should consider the actual disaster situation in each county, make prudent allocations, and compile an accurate budget for approval to avoid the situation of nominal revenue and actual expenditure.</p>
<p>The Riverbank at Majiagang, Guazhou, Collapses: The outer mouth of the riverbank at Majiagang, Guazhou Hedong, collapsed by more than twenty feet on August 25th, leaving only two feet from the bank, which was extremely dangerous. Subsequently, a small encircling dike was constructed in the dangerous area, but it has not yet been completed. Suddenly, at around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the area collapsed again by more than two feet. The collapsing riverbank broke through the small encircling dike, and the waves surged like ten thousand horses galloping. Farmers supporting the elderly and carrying children moved to the main bank. Currently, the district office and people from various sectors in Guazhou Hongqiao are using reeds and sacks to build new earthen dikes to try to rescue the situation.</p>
<p>Shunjiangzhou is Breached Again: The riverbank project in Shunjiangzhou in the Seventh District of Zhenjiang County was originally very solid. However, the southwestern weirs along the river were open due to the water being pumped out by machines, and had not been completely closed. During the gales and torrential rains a few days ago, the Yangtze River rose and breached the bank by about ten feet, directly hitting the Taiping Bridge area. More than ten weirs were breached, hundreds of households were affected, and 3,000 mu of farmland were submerged. A report has been submitted to the Disaster Relief Committee requesting relief. At the same time, Fengguwei, Shundongwei, and Xifengbu Seventh Wei in the southeastern part of the town were also in danger, but fortunately they did not collapse. Also, Majia Township and Maqiao Township in the Second District of Zhenjiang, being close to the river mouth, were most severely affected by the waves. The night before last, the waves broke through Maqiao Township in three places, with each place unloading the bank by five to eight zhang. Majia Township was breached in five places, and the Shizhaikou was breached for a distance of over a li. Due to the rapid surge of the waves at the time, many people who did not have time to escape were drowned. The affected area is eight li long from east to west and five li wide from north to south, with a total of more than 5,000 mu of farmland and more than 300 tile and thatched houses.</p>
<p>Two Kidnappers in Contact Over Ransom Arrested: Wang Xu, a tenant farmer in Yikezhou, is 63 years old. His sons and daughters-in-law died early, leaving behind two grandchildren, a ten-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl. The grandmother and grandchildren lived together without any problems. However, Wang Xu had some wealth and had been coveted by criminals for a long time. Suddenly, on June 24th, four or five bandits came and kidnapped the granddaughter. They initially demanded one thousand yuan, then five hundred yuan. Recently, Wang Xu entrusted Xue Weigao and Song Guoyu to negotiate with the bandits Cui Xuyin and Zhang Jiasheng, and they agreed on a minimum ransom of three hundred yuan. The case was detected by the investigative team of the Provincial Secret Security Bureau. When the bandits were talking at the North Gate, they were all arrested and taken to the headquarters for preliminary interrogation before being transferred to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Impoverished and Ill, He Hanged Himself: Zhao Gongqian, a police officer at the Xingqiao Police Station of the Linping Public Security Bureau, was 31 years old. He had been with the bureau for two years and served diligently. Recently, he had been suffering from lung disease for a long time and had spent a lot of money on treatment. As a result, he was in dire financial straits and became disillusioned with life. Yesterday afternoon at 8:00 PM, he hanged himself with his belt behind the bed. He was discovered by Patrol Chief Weng Licai, who found that he had been dead for some time.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Large Fire in Hutian: Due to carelessness in a home north of Jiangjiaqiao in Xixiang Hutian a few days ago, the fire spread rapidly due to the strong winds, causing the burning of twenty-four houses, more than forty thatched houses, and six buildings. The harvested rice of each family, which was piled up in the fields, was also burned, resulting in a loss of over ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Wind and Rain Cause Disaster: From the afternoon of the 24th to the morning of the 26th in this county, heavy rain fell, accompanied by a hurricane. As a result, the rear sea and the Caojiang embankment, as well as Songjiabu, Sanjie, Zhangzhen, Xiaojiang, Zhangcun, Pukou, Fengjiapu, Xiajiabu, Shangpu, Hengting, Jiazhang, Huapu, Wanba, and Nanxue, were transformed into a watery realm. Crops, dwellings, and livestock on the coastal sandy land were tossed about in the raging hurricane and floodwaters. In addition, the number of broken cables and overturned boats is difficult to estimate. On the morning of the 25th, when the wind and rain were at their worst, the city's Liang, Yuyao, Mazhu, Songbai, Baiyue, Xiejiatang, Shengxian, and other ships, express boats, Shaocao Sheng automobiles, Cao Xiao steamboats, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Ningbo-Shaoxing railway lines were all suspended. The water in the county river rose by more than four feet, and the water in the city and suburbs was knee-deep. The business of various markets and shops suffered greatly. The general tenant farmers, who were in the midst of harvesting the early rice, were suddenly hit by the disaster and cried out in anguish.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Report on Wind and Rain Disaster: On the 25th and 26th, Xiaoshan was hit by sudden gales and torrential rains. Countless amounts of field crops and cotton were lost. Most distressingly, the residents in the sandy areas, starting from the morning of the 26th, were struck by waves of seawater as high as several zhang. Hundreds of houses and thatched huts were swept away by the wind and waves. The loss of hundreds of thousands of mu of cotton fields and early rice in the eastern countryside is also immeasurable. Currently, hundreds of disaster victims have no place to live. Dozens of walls and houses have collapsed in the city. The number of bamboo and trees broken and uprooted in the four rural areas is particularly high along the east and west sides of the South Gate River official embankment. The total loss in the county is estimated to be over hundreds of thousands of yuan. Moreover, the number of overturned boats and drowned boatmen is too numerous to record. This kind of disaster is unprecedented in recent decades. Various rural areas are reporting the disaster to the county and provincial authorities, requesting relief. It is unknown how the aftermath will be handled.</p>
<p>Farmer and Wife Commit Suicide Due to Flood Disaster: Zhou Zhiyan, a farmer in the Butou Jiu area outside the South Gate of Xiaoyi, drowned himself in the South Gate Port on the morning of the 26th because his family's expenses were increasing day by day and the fields he planted were mostly early rice. The ripened rice was completely submerged in the fields due to the wind and rain disaster, resulting in no harvest. Zhou was extremely heartbroken by this situation. His wife, Chen, heard that her husband had drowned and, in the evening, also threw herself into a manure pit and drowned. Now, the family has only two children, aged seven and two, and an eighty-year-old mother. The old and young are crying and wailing, and the scene is heart-wrenching.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Ningbo Suffers Calamitous Winds and Waters</p>
<p>Since 10 AM on the 24th, a hurricane raged in Ningbo. The wind intensified in the afternoon and peaked around 8 PM on the 25th, accompanied by heavy rain, sounding like a roaring lion. Many roof tiles were blown away, and many walls collapsed. Even sturdy buildings vibrated under the onslaught. Residents throughout the city were gripped by fear of impending disaster. All ships, large and small, traveling to Shanghai and other ports were halted. Trains continued to run, but without passengers. Not only was maritime traffic completely disrupted, but inland shipping and sedan chair traffic were also nearly stopped. The river surged, flooding the homes along the banks. Countless houses collapsed, and property was destroyed. Lanterns were extinguished all night, and telegraph communication was cut off in various places. Such a bleak scene had not been witnessed in decades. Around 4 AM yesterday morning, at the height of the wind and high tide, the iron cable securing the west end of the old floating bridge in the city was snapped. The bridge then floated away with the tide, crashing into the new Beijing wharf at Jiangzhang shore. Fortunately, it was late at night with few pedestrians. The vendors who usually operated their stalls on the bridge were spared because they had not stayed in their stalls due to the severe wind and rain that night. Around 7 PM the previous evening, two children of a certain family in Baoji Alley on the Jiangbei shore were playing at their doorway. The younger child accidentally touched a fallen electrical wire and cried out for help. The older child rushed forward to pull him away and was also shocked, but the current was not strong. The parents immediately took them to the hospital for treatment, and their lives are not in danger. In addition to the strong winds and rain in Ningbo, the counties of Cixi and Zhenhai also suffered severe damage. Fortunately, after dawn yesterday, the wind gradually subsided, the dark clouds cleared, the sun blazed, and the water level began to recede. The ships between Ningbo and Shanghai dared not resume their regular voyages yesterday due to strong winds at sea.</p>
<p>Severe Punishment for Rice Merchants Attempting to Manipulate Prices</p>
<p>The Yinxian branch of the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) discovered that the Shunhe Rice Company in Jiangdong, Ningbo, fabricated telegrams to manipulate rice prices. The main culprit, unscrupulous merchant Shi Jitang, and his assistant Zhang Zhongying, are guilty of violating Articles 224 and 234 of the criminal law. The Rice Trade Association and its responsible personnel concealed the matter, failed to report it, and handled it privately, which also constitutes a violation of Article 12 of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law and Article 22, Section 3 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. Yesterday, an emergency meeting was convened and unanimously decided on the following: (1) Impose a fine on Shunhe Rice Company and order its closure within a specified period. All of its assets will be confiscated and used for disaster relief. (2) The principal and accessory offenders in the case will be transferred to the Yinxian District Court for strict prosecution for their criminal offenses. (3) The responsible personnel of the Rice Trade Association, such as Fan Chunguan, will be suspended from their duties pending investigation for violating the law. (4) The Yinxian County Government will be requested by letter to handle the above three points separately within a specified period. (5) The Ningbo Public Security Bureau will be requested by letter to discipline the head of the Second District of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau for negligence in handling the case. It is also learned that the company, knowing it could not escape legal punishment after the case was exposed, suddenly ceased operations yesterday and moved all its inventory away, with a notice posted on the door stating that accounts were being settled. It is said that this matter was a secret action by Fan and others, without convening a majority of the committee for a vote, and there may have been corrupt practices involved. Moreover, the assistant manager of the company, Shi Jitang, has already fled and is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Father and Son Kidnapped for a Large Ransom</p>
<p>Yesterday at 9 PM, more than ten bandits armed with wooden rifles suddenly broke into the home of the wealthy Hu family in Xio'ao Village, Songlin District, Taihua. They kidnapped Hu and his young son, Dengqi, and stole a cotton quilt. After traveling about two li to the vicinity of Guande Temple, Hu was released and instructed to prepare 6,000 yuan in foreign currency for ransom.</p>

<h3>Letter from Jiǎzǐ Hotel in Hankou</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read your esteemed newspaper’s Hankou Special Dispatch column on August 19th, which contained a section about the Yangtze River’s water level and stated that the Jiǎzǐ Hotel, a large hotel in Hankou, with its five-story building, had over a thousand disaster victims residing there, suddenly collapsed this morning, causing numerous injuries and an unknown number of drownings, resulting in heart-wrenching cries. This news item concerning our hotel, though flooded, is a misreport from the Electric News Agency. The collapse never happened. Our hotel building is extremely sturdy, with solid walls, and there is no possibility of collapse. We have requested the Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau to issue a statement prohibiting rumors. We specifically request your esteemed newspaper to correct the record and clarify the truth. We wish you well.</p>

<h3>Wherein Lies the Efficacy of Remedial Education? By Jiang Wenyu (Part Two)</h3>
<p>Amidst this educational quagmire, only remedial education can alleviate part or most of the difficulties. At a time when public and private sectors alike are financially strained and everyone views education with trepidation, remedial education can alleviate this suffering. Amidst the chorus of complaints that education is failing to boost production and is instead hindering it, only remedial education can fill this void. At a time when many young people lack the resources for further education, feel frustrated and depressed, and harbor resentment, only remedial education can channel this pent-up energy. This is not to promote remedial education in particular, but rather to acknowledge the inherent capacity of remedial education to manifest unique effectiveness through its great potential. Since I place such emphasis on vocational education, the content, target audience, and level of remedial education I advocate will differ from conventional notions.</p>
<p>(1) In terms of content, it must be substantial, as its mission extends beyond imparting vocational skills and knowledge. It must also emphasize cultivating civic morality, promoting national culture, fostering personal character, inspiring patriotism, and strengthening physical fitness. In essence, vocational training, character development, and physical training (including military training) are the three pillars of remedial education, which must be developed evenly, without bias, and be mutually supportive and well-integrated.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the target audience, it must be comprehensive. While young people already employed but lacking the resources for further education and aspiring to advance are the formal students of remedial schools, the unique circumstances in China necessitate a broader scope. For instance, seventeen- or eighteen-year-olds in rural areas who have not attended school but are already engaged in various agricultural tasks with their fathers and brothers can benefit from short-term community schools during agricultural off-seasons as a form of remedial education. In addition to supplementing the four years of compulsory education, these schools can place special emphasis on vocational training. Wouldn't this be an excellent way to promote compulsory education with a vocational component? Furthermore, young people who have graduated from elementary or junior high school but are not yet employed urgently need remedial vocational knowledge and skills, and these remedial education institutions can serve as a substitute for vocational schools. Even high school graduates without specialized skills can benefit from remedial education institutions that provide more advanced skills. However, such remedial education should never focus solely on skills, neglecting moral and physical development. The above is of utmost importance, as it would greatly increase the number of people receiving remedial education.</p>

<h3>Adding Vocational Schools in the Special District of Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, upon receiving a report from the Special District of Eastern Provinces regarding the addition of vocational schools and the increase of vocational subjects, has approved the plan. The six measures of the bureau are listed below: (1) Starting from the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the junior high school classes of the First District Middle School will cease enrollment until the senior high school general courses. Currently, there is only one school in the district, and the number of applicants has exceeded the number of admissions by several times. It is proposed to continue enrollment as before, but the original six classes will not be expanded. (2) Starting from the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the First Advanced Industrial Middle School in the district will be reorganized into an industrial school in accordance with the regulations of the National Government, and the First Vocational School will be jointly established within the school. This year, the first class of electrical engineering students with junior high school education will be enrolled. In addition, the Second Vocational School will be added to the First Middle School in the district. This year, the first class of commerce students with junior high school education will be enrolled. The admission qualifications are limited to graduates of senior primary school who are physically strong. The schooling period is three years. As the special zone is a concentrated area of industry and commerce, the need for agricultural vocational schools is less. It is planned to consider the establishment of the Third Vocational School in the future. (3) After investigation, it is found that there are no county-run middle schools in the district, and the third item of the education facility outline is not applicable. (4) After investigation, it is found that the bureau has already issued a notice to all middle schools under its jurisdiction that, starting from the 20th year of the Republic (1931), students in the third grade of junior high school who are preparing for future employment should reduce the number of general subjects by six to nine hours depending on the situation and change to vocational subjects. It is also stipulated that senior high school general course students who will not be able to continue their studies in the future will also be required to switch to industrial and commercial courses. (5) After investigation, it is found that there were no vocational schools in the district in the past. Only the newly established First and Second Schools have raised considerable funds to enrich their content and are actively raising funds to prepare for future expansion. (6) After investigation, it is found that no applications have been submitted this year for the establishment of ordinary middle schools in the district. In the future, if any applications are submitted, the bureau will consider the situation and advise them to switch to vocational schools such as agricultural and industrial courses in order to promote production education.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Announces Measures to Supervise Private Remedial</h3>
<h3>and Correspondence Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Higher Education Bureau yesterday announced various notices on the regulations for supervising private community schools, measures for remedial schools, measures for correspondence schools, and measures for vocational training centers. The notices stated: "Given the high population density of this city, there are quite a few adults who are out of school or unemployed. To meet the needs of the environment, private community schools, remedial schools, correspondence schools, and vocational training centers have naturally emerged. However, the quality of these schools varies. If regulations are not clearly defined and supervision is not implemented, not only will they fail to assist the government in promoting government social education, but they will also mislead the youth and cause no small harm. In view of this, the bureau has formulated regulations for supervising private community schools, measures for supervising private remedial schools, measures for supervising private correspondence schools, and measures for supervising private vocational training centers, which have been submitted to the municipal government and the Ministry of Education for approval and record.

<h3>See Today's Rotary Cup Finals</h3>
<h3>Which Side, China or Japan, Can Make the First Strong Move?</h3>
<p>| Two Sets of Singles | 4:30 PM at the China Tennis Court</p>
<h3>China Can Overcome the Enemy | Rely on Strategy</h3>
<p>The first act of the Rotary Cup Tennis Finals, China versus Japan, will take place at the China Tennis Court at 4:30 PM this afternoon. China has survived from a desperate situation, creating the current situation where it is competing with Japan for the championship, which is not without luck. Although success depends on human effort, perhaps through this lesson, it can strive for self-improvement and achieve the final goal of success, which is also within expectations. The reporter personally experienced the battlefield and expresses great sympathy for Canada's strategy in dealing with China. It first uses its second-best player against the opponent's best player, and its best player against the opponent's second-best player, at least creating a situation where each side wins one match. Then it works hard on doubles, gaining an advantage with a score of 2-1. In the end, if one of the two singles matches is won, it will achieve a great victory with a score of 3-2. If China can implement this strategy, whether for the spectators or the competitors, the fierce excitement and tense atmosphere will be even greater during the success or failure of both sides. The news spread by the Coordination Association last night said that there was a change in the lineup of Chen for today's match, but it did not specifically name whether the change belonged to China or Japan. However, the reporter's contribution, it is unknown whether the association can consider it. The list of warriors for both sides is listed below.</p>
<p>China Qiu Feihai Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>Japan Biao Jixiong Machida</p>
<h3>B Group Singles Tournament</h3>
<p>There are twenty-five participants in the B Group Singles Tournament. Many of our country's emerging players are participating, and the future competition will be no less intense than the A Group. It is a pity that last year's champion, Yu TianGuang XiaYe, is not participating, otherwise it would be even more interesting. The first week will end before September 6th, the second week will end before September 10th, the third week will end before September 13th, the semi-finals will end before September 16th, and the date of the finals will be determined later.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Football Team Shows Courage and Righteousness</h3>
<p>Holding a Fundraising Charity Match Next Friday and Saturday</p>
<p>Heaven has brought disaster to our country, with floods causing calamity. Woe to our fellow citizens, who are suffering from hunger and cold. The Jiaotong University football team can resolutely take the lead in raising the banner of righteousness to raise large sums of money for disaster relief. It is heard that yesterday, the school authorities, Fan Shouzhi and Yang Yufen, and the director of physical education, Chen Zhang'e, discussed the plan. As a result, they pushed Mr. Chen and Mr. Shen Siliang and Li Silian to personally negotiate with Shanghai's famous Chinese and Western football teams (such as the Western Police, the Army, the Donghua, the Lehua, the Lingnan, and the Hualing) to have several matches. The proceeds from the tickets will be donated to disaster relief. The dates are scheduled for next Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in three sessions at the China Baseball Field. The school has already sent letters to Nanjing urging the fierce general, Jiang Shanjing, to quickly return to the capital to increase his strength and enhance his military appearance. All the other strong players are already in armor, stationed at the North Gate, wearing their weapons and waiting for orders. It is heard that the tickets will be sold for 1.6 yuan and 2 yuan, which is cheaper than the ticket prices charged by other charitable organizations.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Ping Pong Match to Aid Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Jinling Ping Pong Team will compete against Shanghai's Japanese players at 8 PM tonight, and at 9 PM they will compete against Tianma or Jiande in a disaster relief match at the Jiande Savings Association Basketball Room. All proceeds will be donated to disaster relief. The Chinese-owned Sanhe Company, the only store selling ping pong equipment in Shanghai, heard about this good deed and donated five dozen Sanhe brand standard ping pong balls made in China to welcome them and show their encouragement.</p>
<h3>Amateur Tennis Tournament at Municipal Stadium No. 1</h3>
<p>There were two matches in the amateur tennis competition held at Municipal Stadium No. 1 the day before yesterday. (1) In the Shen group, Chen Xuexin versus Kong DeKong Yequan, Chen won by default. (3) In the Qiu group, Sun Zhiyu versus Gu Yue, the first set was quite competitive, and although Sun won with a score of 7 to 5, it took a lot of effort. In the second set, Gu's momentum gradually weakened, and he lost again with a score of 6 to 3.</p>

<h3>World News in Brief</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Public Typewriter</p>
<p>Many large department stores in Berlin, the capital of Germany, have recently installed public typewriters. Each time, you only need to insert a penny into the small slot on the machine, and it will type for you. Every day, countless merchants line up there, waiting to use the typewriter in turn. Therefore, the daily income is also considerable. The construction of this typewriter is the same as that of ordinary typewriters, except that it has a counter and a coin slot.</p>
<p>When starting to type, you must first calculate how many words you should type each time. The words typed are recorded one by one on the counter panel. Each penny is limited to typing 1,000 keystrokes. When it reaches the first 1,000 strokes, there is a mechanism on the machine that locks it immediately. You must insert another penny before it will let you continue typing.</p>
<p>This public typewriter is indeed a very clever new invention, but the keys are very fragile. With thousands of hands typing on the keys every day, I'm afraid it won't last long.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Qing Dao Ren</h3>
<p>— A Dan</p>
<p>When Qing Dao Ren had not yet passed the imperial examination, a certain Yu of Wuling predicted he would certainly become famous through his writings and promised him his eldest daughter in marriage.  She died before the wedding. He then promised him his second daughter. She also died. He then promised him his third daughter, named Mei. They married, but after several years, she also passed away. Dao Ren was deeply saddened and his spirit was dimmed.  Moved by Yu's noble spirit, he remained a widower for the rest of his life and never remarried. He was therefore known as “Mei-Chi” (Mei-Obsessed). He also used the pseudonym "Mei An".</p>
<p>Dao Ren's ancestral home was Linchuan, Jiangxi. His father was a candidate for official position in Hunan, so they resided in Hunan. Dao Ren was extremely naive and did not understand worldly affairs. He suddenly took it upon himself to take the imperial examination, but he knew nothing about the current examination regulations. One day, he obtained a book of model essays for the "small topic" (小題, a specific essay topic in the imperial examinations) from an old book stall and repeatedly studied it. He brought it into the examination hall. Coincidentally, the examination question was exactly what was in the book, so he simply copied the entire essay. The chief examiner did not notice and greatly praised it. After the results were announced, there was an uproar. Those who were competing for the top spots filed a petition, accusing him of falsifying his place of origin and plagiarizing old writings.  He was stripped of his position as a successful candidate in the imperial examinations. After that, Dao Ren passed the provincial examination in Jiangxi. Those who knew this often teased him as a "double-portion" successful candidate in the provincial examination. Dao Ren would always smile wryly.</p>
<p>During the Xinhai Revolution, the southeastern provinces were recovered by the revolutionaries. Dao Ren came to Shanghai from Nanjing, grew his hair long, and dressed like a Taoist priest. His original name was Li Ruiqing, so he called himself Qing Dao Ren (Pure Taoist). He hung a sign at his door that read "Jade Plum Blossom Hermitage Taoist." Someone with a funeral at their house came to his residence to request him to perform Taoist rituals. Li was greatly embarrassed and recommended a Taoist priest from a neighboring temple to perform the rituals instead. This was because the person making the request did not know that he was the calligrapher Li Ruiqing. Some people said that he was improperly appropriating sacred objects and that he deserved this retribution.</p>
<p>Dao Ren's initial pricing was quite unique.  His price list clearly stated prices for the styles of Zhou, Qin, Han, Wei, Six Dynasties, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. When Yang Chongzi (Jun) came from Hunan to Shanghai and saw it, he asked Dao Ren, "Do you want to open a photography studio?" He thought, "I think you cannot be good at everything, and even if you were, it would be uninteresting.  You are making things difficult for yourself and restricting yourself. There is really no need to do so." Dao Ren understood and revised his price list. Just as he was making corrections, someone seeking calligraphy arrived and requested an eight-foot-tall couplet in the style of Yu Boshi. After the guest left, Li took a stone-printed copy and pieced together characters to imitate the style, doing it perfunctorily, and destroyed the old price list. One day, Dao Ren said to Yang Xizi (Du), "There is not a single stroke in my calligraphy that is not from the ancients." Yang replied, "It's no wonder that no stroke belongs to you alone." Dao Ren's calligraphy became famous for imitating tombstone inscriptions.</p>
<p>Dao Ren wrote calligraphy differently from ordinary people. Once, he was writing an epitaph for someone. A servant brought food. He happened to be writing the character "dao" (道, way, path), so he put down his brush and ate. The first stroke of the character was left unfinished. He finished writing the "dao" character after the meal. Another time, he was writing a signboard and wrote half of the long horizontal stroke before stopping. This was because the person holding the paper was a woman, and he had to avoid her when a guest arrived. When the guest left, he finished the right half of the horizontal stroke. Therefore, Dao Ren's characters were not completed in one breath and could be moved and disassembled at will. However, his comments on calligraphy had some unique insights. He said, "In my humble opinion, when discussing calligraphy, one should seek the ancients from the ancients, and not seek the ancients from those who learn from the ancients in the present. Since the Yuan Dynasty, the trend has been to learn the calligraphy of contemporaries. This kind of dependent, slavish nature must be avoided. He Daozhou's official script is not bad. Every stroke has the spirit of the Han people. But he is not rigid and seeks fluidity. Therefore, his brushstrokes cannot be copied. Those who learn his calligraphy well will only have people say that they are learning He. The problem is that they cannot elaborate. However, what would those who learn the calligraphy of Zeng, Li, Kang, Zheng, Wu, and Shen think if they heard this?" Dao Ren obtained a landscape hanging scroll by Gao Fangshan, which he regarded as a treasure. However, Ye Dehui commented that it was a ding, not a genuine work. After Dao Ren passed away, Nong Ran sold it for several thousand yuan to pay for Dao Ren's funeral expenses. This shows that the fake Fangshan did not let down the real Mei An.</p>
<h3>An Interesting Competition</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Two Japanese journalists, Xingdao and Fugu Gu (both transliterations), held an interesting competition. The two men departed on the same day (June 6th) to circumnavigate the globe. Mr. Xingdao traveled eastward from Osaka, while Mr. Fugu Gu traveled westward from Yokohama. Barring unforeseen events and unavoidable obstacles, they were not to stop for even a moment. The AHASI newspaper offered a prize to the first to reach Tokyo. As a result, Mr. Fugu Gu, traveling westward, reached Tokyo first in 31 days, 6 hours, and 18 minutes. Mr. Xingdao took 35 days, 7 hours, and 37 minutes. The travel expenses were entirely borne by the newspaper. Mr. Fugu Gu won a prize of 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>A Plea for Eight Hundred Orphans</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Junqing of Wuxing is a renowned figure in the literary world, famous throughout the country for his poetry and prose. He has successively held editorial positions at the Zhonghua and Dadong publishing houses. Recently, in light of the financial difficulties faced by the Minhang and Nanxun orphanages, he wrote to Mr. Ji Juemi, pleading for the orphans. Yesterday, I saw the original manuscript at a friend's place. The writing is brilliant, and it is not merely a matter of showing concern. The letter reads: "Previously, I read the announcement and learned that you provided medicine for Mr. Ha when he was ill and observed mourning customs after his death. You managed his funeral and treated the bereavement as your own. Your meticulous and thoughtful actions, guided by ancient principles, are sufficient to maintain friendship and correct popular customs. Although I am ignorant of governance and have no knowledge of promotion or demotion, I remain aloof from the muddy world and keep myself pure. I admire your noble character, and my friendship with you grows stronger. I constantly hold you in my esteem. Considering that Mr. Ha is gone, continuing his legacy and fulfilling his tasks depends on us. I will fulfill the role of a steadfast friend and carry on the virtues of benevolence and righteousness. After I had read his accounts, there was a promise to leave a land behind. He had said, 'I had no opportunity to support others due to my youth. Therefore I feel great shame and remorse, charity and education are always in my mind. You should find people who benefit it.' I now write to you because of my deep respect and disregard for convention. I do not presume to suggest how it should be done, but instead would recommend charity and education for eight hundred orphans.  The Guangci Orphanage in Minhang was founded by Mr. Shen Baoyi, the former head of the Water Police Department. He devoted great effort to donating land and building houses. The scale is grand, and it is truly practical.  The people of Shanghai all praise it. However, it is difficult to continue independently. The annual deficit is approximately 5,000 yuan. The Nanxun Orphanage was founded by my late student, Mr. Xu Yibing. It is smaller in scale, but the results are quite commendable. The funding is inadequate, and it is on the verge of collapse. The annual deficit is also approximately 2,000 yuan. You, sir, are fulfilling his will. If you could donate 50,000 yuan to the Minhang Orphanage and 20,000 yuan to the Nanxun Orphanage, with the funds deposited in a bank designated by you, and only the interest used, and the receipt delivered directly to the heads of the two orphanages, your generous agreement would mean that Mr. Ha would have fulfilled his promise.  You, sir, would have completed the good deeds and the names of Mr. and Mrs. Ha, and your great name will shine forever. As for me, I lost my parents early and lacked proper teachers. I would cry over others' suffering.  I am unable to relax due to those who are hungry and I must bring them peace.  Please help those who are orphaned with care. I will continue to cry until someone hears me. I only hope to move others to act. You, sir, have compassion and will not create barriers. I think you will not see my words as unimportant. The Great Learning says, 'Use wealth to cultivate virtue.' Zuo Zhuan says, 'Performing good deeds brings blessings.' The Hong Fan (Great Plan) considers 'being rich and virtuous' as the ultimate blessing. These sacred scriptures can serve as a model. You, sir, respect Mr. Ha as Bao Shuya, so you, sir, should be like Yi Wu in Jiangzuo, bringing timely rain to the people. The most urgent task is to consider the two orphanages as a beginning and actively proceed. Let this letter be the first step, and let us see it through to the end. Please accept my humble words and start with me. From now on, build houses, not just give words of kindness. Start the building, and then there will be more after that. Use China's wealth to help China. With the value of exchange equal.  The way to exchange is the most important.  For all you do is in the public eye, please start to support others. A former king's story serves as a lesson.  Change the ways of the stingy.  Alas, the victims are everywhere, and the floods are raging. The government can barely provide a cup of water, and friendly nations cannot offer a passing boat. The lives of hundreds of millions of people are in dire straits. The devastation in sixteen provinces is reported urgently in letters. Please do not break your previous promises and treat everyone equally."</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on a Trip to Europe by Ms. Yang Manhua (1)</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Last year, artist Xu Shiqi was sent by the Ministry of Health of the National Government to Europe to study health administration for a year and a half. He traveled extensively in more than ten countries, including England, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Poland, and Russia. Recently, he and his wife, Ms. Yang Manhua, returned to China via Siberia. Yesterday, this reporter met Ms. Yang and asked about her impressions of the trip. She said that the word "impressions" could not fully capture her feelings. Our time in France was relatively long, and our impressions were also the deepest. I will present a candid and unbiased account of the lives of Chinese laborers and students working part-time in France, the poverty of our country's embassies and consulates abroad, and the misunderstandings of the general European public about China. I am now presenting her fair words to the reader.</p>
<p>There are quite a few Chinese laborers in the suburbs of Paris. They had lived ordinary lives for the past decade or so. However, in recent years, their productivity has declined sharply, and their living conditions are undoubtedly difficult. Only a few percent can maintain a decent standard of living. They are already very lucky if they can find hard labor or run a small business. Most are unemployed and cannot afford food and clothing. They are stranded in foreign countries and cannot return. The government sent them abroad initially, but now it is not planning to resettle them or repatriate them. It is no wonder that they resent and hate their motherland. Many of the Chinese laborers marry French women. The reason why French women marry Chinese laborers is that they are affected by population factors and the fantasy of making a living. Today, the number of women in France still exceeds the number of men several times. It is not easy for women to marry. Those who marry Chinese laborers are naturally unfortunate women. If they marry Chinese laborers to make a living, it is simply a fantasy. Their children follow their mothers in language, customs, and everything else. It is still questionable whether they will be our compatriots in the future. According to French nationality law, they can apply to the government for approval only after they turn twenty. A certain Mr. Liu, the dean of studies at the Sino-French University, felt that the children of overseas Chinese had been studying in French schools since they were young, and even they did not know which country their parents were from. It would be very dangerous if they could not be naturalized into our country in the future. Last year, he founded a Chinese supplementary school for overseas Chinese children, using their free time after school to teach Chinese for one hour every day. In just a few months, they have been able to understand a little Chinese. This is indeed a wonderful way to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Wu Zhihui, and others advocated work-study programs. At that time, most middle school students were fascinated by Western civilization, and everyone wanted to taste the flavor of studying in France. The funds they prepared were very limited. Once they arrived in France, they wanted to implement work-study programs. How could they know that studying and working are sometimes difficult to reconcile? Moreover, it is not easy to find suitable work. In recent years, the French have also been experiencing unemployment. It is impossible for Chinese people to steal their jobs. As a result, they have no work to do and no money to study. Their situation is really pitiful. They have no money to maintain their lives and no money to return to their country. They are in a dilemma and are in a state of great distress. If the government does not take steps to rescue them, the future will be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on a Trip to the Northeast (5)</h3>
<p>— Liu Suijiu</p>
<p>(8) Japanese-Established Libraries and Opinions on Book Classification</p>
<p>The Japanese have established as many as twenty-five libraries in various parts of northeastern China. There are as many as seven in Dalian alone. Even in Harbin, which is within the sphere of Russian influence, there are libraries established by the Japanese. The Japanese are particularly dedicated to cultural undertakings in their management of so-called Manchuria and Mongolia, which can be seen from this. The number of large and small libraries they have established along the South Manchuria Railway line is almost equal to the number of schools they have established along the railway line. This is truly noteworthy.</p>
<p>According to research, the Dalian Library was established in January 1918. According to research, the library's budget for the eighteenth year of the Republic of China was 200,253.09 Japanese yen. According to a survey in 1929, it had 135,996 volumes. The number must be higher today. Mr. Songqi Heoong, who is in charge of the Chinese section of the library, is about forty or fifty years old. He studied Chinese literature under Mr. Wang Xiangqi. Xiong Duchun is a scholar with a Confucian demeanor, erudite and thoughtful.</p>
<p>The Fengtian Library was established in November of the first year of the Xuantong era. According to the annual report for the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the library's budget was 54,013.03 Japanese yen. That year, the library had 40,934 volumes. The curator of the library, Mr. Eito Toshio, is a diligent scholar. I had a long conversation with him in English for several hours. He told me that the library still uses the traditional four-category system (jing, shi, zi, ji) for classifying Chinese books. Because the classification of Chinese books is extremely difficult, for example, the I Ching can be considered literature, history, or philosophy. It requires careful consideration, and it is not appropriate to make arbitrary judgments. Therefore, preserving the old classification method is essential. Mr. Eito does not approve of the Chinese style of bookbinding. He uses the European and American style of book display. His discussions were lively and full of interesting anecdotes. He reported on the library's situation. His various opinions were very detailed. He is truly worthy of being a library director.</p>
<p>(9) Book Promotion Methods</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway Library has various types of mobile libraries, roughly divided into six types: (1) Mobile libraries that circulate among various libraries. Each time, the number of books circulated is about 150 volumes. They are exchanged every two months. The locations are the major ports south of Harbin to Dalian. (2) Mobile library lending stations. These circulate along the South Manchuria Railway to smaller stations. Each time, about 50 volumes are circulated. They are exchanged every month. The locations include Lushun, Zhoushuizi, Jinzhou, and Sanlilibao. (3) Mobile small box circulation stations. These circulate to stations other than the above-mentioned locations. All branches of the South Manchuria and Anfeng Railways are covered thoroughly without omission. (4) Special circulation stations. These circulate to places far from the railway line where Japanese residents live. Each time, about 100 volumes are circulated. They are exchanged every three months. (5) School libraries. These circulate to small schools without libraries at each station. Each time, the number of books is about 60 volumes. They are exchanged every two months. (6) Train libraries. These circulate in direct trains. There are a total of ten libraries, each with twenty books and thirty magazines for passengers to choose from at any time. The South Manchuria Railway Library also jointly publishes a library newspaper called "Shuxiang" (Book Fragrance), which is published monthly. There are also reading organizations to arouse interest in reading books. The various facilities are meticulous. The Japanese management of Manchuria and Mongolia is interesting, thoughtful, planned, and scientific. Is this not a great advantage?</p>

<h3>Gold Market Initially Weak, Eventually Strong</h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday, the 28th, was confusing and unpredictable. It was initially weak but eventually rallied, showing a perplexing pattern of fluctuating prices that made it difficult to predict. From morning to evening, there was a total fluctuation of seven taels. In the end, it rebounded by four taels. The sudden rise in silver bullion was due to purchases from both China and India, which opened the market at a low price. However, the demand and supply on the trading floor were different, resulting in price fluctuations of two or three taels. Consequently, the price fell from the border of 775 taels to below 70 taels. Although the exchange rate remained stable, the market was filled with buying interest. It was rumored that a certain bank had started aggressively buying, causing the price to rise rapidly to between 77 taels. However, the foreign exchange rate did not change significantly.

<h3>The Great Silver Returns</h3>
<p>Twenty-eighth National Agency London reports the great silver will return sixteen shares or coins. Nearly one two pence nine hundred thirty five</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Chinese Merchants Buy More, Sell Less</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British silver rose slightly, and the American silver remained the same. There was no significant change in the Shanghai market. HSBC's listed price decreased by 1.25 for Hong Kong, at 80 taels and 0.375. The domestic market was also stable. The result was not much different from the day before. Only the Japanese yen increased by 0.25. However, the gold market strengthened from weakness, rising by more than four taels. Therefore, the Chinese merchants and goldsmiths bought gold and made a profit. However, they also sold when the gold market fell. Overall, they bought more and sold less. It is estimated that about 200,000 pounds of British gold were traded, with Japanese commercial banks accounting for the most transactions. In addition, only 100,000 to 200,000 US dollars were traded, and Japanese banks sold several hundred thousand dollars of Japanese yen. This was probably due to the lack of special news from abroad, resulting in a stable market.</p>
<p>The domestic British exchange rate fluctuated by only 0.0625. In the morning, the asking price was between 1 shilling, 2 pence, 8125, and 875, and the bid price was between 875 and 9375.

<h3>Securities Settlement Flourishes in the Foreign Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the settlement date for various securities spot transactions for this month. The amount of securities mortgages and various securities to be settled in both the silver and money industries was quite large. The substitutes for settlement mainly relied on foreign exchange spot funds and bank drafts. Therefore, yesterday, the money shops' buying and selling of Nanyang funds and the handling of remittances were unusually complex. However, with both supply and demand strong, the interest rate had no room for competition, resulting in little change in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<p>Interest Rates Similar, Interbank Lending Slightly Sluggish (Foreign Interest Rates) The interest rates in the morning and afternoon markets were the same due to numerous transactions. The forces of supply and demand helped each other, and the closing price was the same at 7 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, and a half, which was slightly lower by 3 hao and hu compared to the previous day's morning market, and the situation was still stable. (Silver Interbank Lending) The morning market was 1 qian, 4 fen, and the afternoon market was 1 qian, 5 fen. The bank's listed price was still 6 fen, with an additional 1 qian and 12 fen for "hua tou jia shui" (a type of surcharge), which seemed even more sluggish compared to the previous day's situation.</p>
<p>"Jiao Yang" (Small Silver Coins) Stable in the Morning, Rising in the Afternoon. "Jiangnan" small silver coins were slightly weak in the morning market, at 6 qian, 5 fen, 4 li. In the afternoon market, they suddenly rose by 1 li and a half to 6 qian, 5 fen, 6 li, which was also better by half a li compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 4,000 "jiao" in the morning market and 12,000 "jiao" in the afternoon market. "Guangdong" small silver coins were 6 qian, 4 fen, 5 li, 2 hao and a half in the morning market and 6 qian, 5 fen, 6 li in the afternoon market. The result was also better by 7 hao and a half. The transaction volume was 270,000 "jiao" in the morning market and 95,000 "jiao" in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000 "wen" to 374,000 "wen."</p>
<p>Frequent Inflow and Outflow of Silver and Foreign Funds (Silver Funds) Yesterday, the banks' receipt and remittance of silver funds were particularly frequent due to the approach of the end of the month. Other various routine receipts and remittances were mostly the same. It is estimated that Chinese merchants received and remitted 2.45 million taels in drafts, foreign merchants received and remitted 1.45 million taels in drafts, various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds received and remitted over 11.1 million taels, telegraphic transfers amounted to over 1.8 million taels, settlements amounted to over 4 million taels, mortgage transactions amounted to over 1 million taels, and warehouse entries amounted to 1.1 million taels. The Japanese bank received and remitted over 5.33 million taels in various funds, settled over 880,000 taels, and released 400,000 taels from the warehouse. Money shops and silver firms received and remitted over 51.1 million taels in single receipts and remittances, "hua tou" funds received and remitted over 4.33 million taels, and various exchange funds received and remitted over 1.22 million taels, with tens of thousands of taels in cash remittances. (Foreign Funds) Exchange drafts amounted to 5.28 million taels in the morning market and 2.83 million taels in the afternoon market, totaling over 8 million taels in both markets. Banknotes amounted to 125,000 taels in the morning market and 85,000 taels in the afternoon market. Off-exchange banknotes amounted to 215,000 taels in the morning market and 185,000 taels in the afternoon market. Bank trading amounted to over 2.1 million taels in the morning market and 1.35 million taels in the afternoon market. The receipts and remittances of foreign accounts between various banks amounted to over 3.3 million taels, with over 3 million taels of banknotes collected and issued. The receipts and remittances of foreign drafts from money shops were as high as 15 to 16 million taels due to excessive securities trading. "Hua tou" foreign funds received and remitted over 3.7 to 3.8 million taels, interbank lending of foreign funds received and remitted 1.6 to 1.7 million taels, and small money shops traded over 600,000 taels.</p>
<h3>August Securities and Public Debt Settlement Situation</h3>
<p>Settlement amount of 52.14 million yuan</p>
<p>October futures trading opens today</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange was closed for the past two days to handle the August futures settlement. The August settlement amounted to 52.14 million yuan, an increase of over 8.8 million yuan compared to July. The consolidated tax accounted for the most, at 16.15 million yuan, followed by the 20% Customs Duty at 8.5 million yuan. The 20% Rolled Tobacco Tax, 19% Customs Duty, Welfare Bonds, and Disarmament Bonds each had 4 to 5 million yuan. In addition to the 29.4 million yuan that had already been transferred on Wednesday, 22.67 million yuan was actually settled yesterday. The settlement process was smooth. The Securities Exchange will reopen today and begin new trading for October futures. However, the sale of October futures is still limited to the provision of physical goods, except for arbitrage. The August futures settlement and transfer amounts for each bond are listed below (in yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Shows a Bland Color</h3>
<p>The yarn market is extremely bland, with both long and short positions holding a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the monthly futures settlement before making a final decision. However, East Asian Grade 3 yarn is good, probably because Gandhi of India is determined to go to England, the political situation is better, and Japan's business with India is picking up, so it is rising. However, the local people's hearts are still depressed because the floods in all directions are becoming more and more serious, and it is expected that the actual sales in the autumn will be difficult to achieve, so they tend to sell short. The Sichuanese group purchased 4,000 bales of 20-count Blue Phoenix and Hongxi yarn for delivery in September, October, November, and December at a price of 174 taels.</p>
<p>People's Standard Not Encouraging. In the previous market, the opening price of American cotton fell slightly, and people's hearts were still flat. Each month fell by 6-7 qian, then to 2-3 rounds, the market atmosphere returned to the top due to the firm rise of Grade 3 yarn. As a result, each month rose by 1, 3, and 4 qian, with a transaction volume of 19,400 bales. It was found that Ruida sold 1,000 bales, Tongyu 1,200 bales, Shenji 1,100 bales, and Guangfeng 2,200 bales. Dafu bought 2,000 bales, Guangfeng 1,350 bales, Yiyu 1,700 bales, Yichang 1,350 bales, Taixing 850 bales, and Hengde 850 bales. The closing price of the People's Standard is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Sluggish Yarn Sales. Current yarn sales are still flat. It was found that various groups bought a total of 900 bales throughout the day. 150 bales were traded among the same industry. The market was flat. Among the guest groups, 200 bales were shipped to the mainland, 55 bales to Ningbo, 160 bales to Tianjin, 210 bales to Sichuan, 100 bales to Hankou, 40 bales to Guangdong, and 135 bales to miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows a Slightly Flat Trend</h3>
<p>The cotton market has shown a slight stabilization. After the wind and rain, the new cotton has been severely damaged, and the annual harvest has been greatly reduced. Although the situation of American cotton is flat and weak, it has risen by more than 50 pounds compared to the low price, and there are too many short positions. There are fears that the standard Indian cotton may be difficult to include. With these various situations, local cotton merchants have purchased a large number of long positions, and Japanese merchants' buying intention is also strong. It is also said that the inventory of old cotton this year is weak, and the water disaster in Hankou is severe, so the new goods will be delayed in coming to market. Therefore, the October standard cotton is optimistic. However, it is estimated that there is an oversupply in foreign countries, and there is still no great upward momentum in the future. According to the situation in Shanghai, there may be an increase.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Slightly Soft. In the previous market of Hankou Standard, the market atmosphere was tired again due to the slight decline in American cotton. Each fell by 2 qian, then returned to the top in the second and third rounds. As a result, it fell by 1-2 qian and then rose by 5 fen to 1 qian in the afternoon. The transaction volume was 71,200 dan. It was found that Hengyi sold 4,000 dan, Yukang 2,000 dan, Tongyu 2,100 dan, Hengde 3,100 dan, and Xinheng 5,100 dan. Heshen bought 1,000 dan, Gongtai 1,900 dan, Shenchang 1,400 dan, Yichang 1,300 dan, Xiesheng 1,800 dan, and Lichang 1,000 dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Grain, New Early Rice and Foreign Xian Rice Appear on the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various groups in the South Market had sources for No. 40 rice. The transaction between urban and rural areas was extremely small. This was because the weather was sunny and the New Gate was selling off. The total market was only over 600 "hu" (a unit of volume). The market of thick "japonica" rice suddenly shrank by 7-8 "jiao." The middle and second grades were clearly distinguished. Thin "indica" rice was silent and lacked transactions. The trend was also weak by 4-5 "jiao." New "japonica" rice from Pudong surged, falling by 1 yuan. People's hearts were all looking loose. Old "yang du jian" rice was scarce, and sales were not active, slightly following the fall in price. New early rice from Pinghu appeared yesterday with dozens of "shi" (another unit of volume). Also, nearly 100 "dan" (a unit of weight) of new "yang jian" rice from Jiashan had good rice quality, with prices opening at 14.5 to 14 yuan, a fair price for the new goods.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the west road of the New Gate was still surging, and the situation was declining. The price of Changzhou-Wuxi northern "japonica" rice continued to be short of top-quality goods and ordinary grades, and the price shrank by 4-5 "jiao." Early and late rice arrived in a weak stomach, and the price was low by 6-7 "jiao." The transaction of "yang du jian" rice was extremely light, and the river storage was still high, but the buying interest was silent. "Bu jian" rice was sold as it arrived, and the situation was set. "Ba jian" rice was short of supply. The number of glutinous rice arriving increased day by day, and the price gradually went downstream. The arrival of foreign rice was still weak, and guest groups moved slightly, but the local street was slightly weak, causing the price to be weak by 1-2 "jiao."</p>
<h3>Northern Groups Continue to Handle Guest Yuan</h3>
<p>There is a saying that there will be 200,000 tons of new foreign rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market condition of foreign rice was flat in terms of spot sales. Both local and guest merchants were watching. Therefore, there were no transactions in the total market. The northern groups had a very good appetite for guest yuan. However, there was not much in stock, and the price was high. Yesterday, only dozens of packages of Jiangxi machine yuan were purchased, priced at 15.15 yuan. Although the spot sales of foreign rice were weak, futures trading was very active. There were more than 1,000 tons of returned goods traded in the market, which were still small batches for September, priced at 6.42 to 6.5 taels. The new trading of ordered goods was even more prosperous. The market rumor was that Bingchang Foreign Firm had newly purchased more than 200,000 tons in the production area, so the market price in the production area was not easy to fall. Yesterday, Anli telegrammed that 2,000 tons of small batches of cargo were being loaded, priced at 7.4 taels for No. 1 Saigon and 7.5 taels for No. 2 Saigon. Xiangmao Foreign Firm issued a telegram stating that there were 800 tons of No. 1 Saigon ready to be loaded, priced at 7.3 taels.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Sees Stronger Buying Interest</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market conditions in each month generally showed a steady trend. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat was about 2 "jiao" lower, the actual sales have been moving since the decline to 2.08 taels in this month, because the shipping costs from various places are more reasonable with the distance from the highest price having fallen by 1 "qian." Therefore, the buying interest has been smooth, and the long-term has also been boosted for this reason. However, because the factories continue to order more foreign wheat, they will also continue to ship out, and the outcome of the subsequent steps depends on whether the actual sales are smooth. As a result, this month rose by 1.5 "fen" compared to the previous day, September rose by 1.75 "fen," October rose by 1.5 "fen," November and December rose by 1.25 "fen," and January rose by 1.75 "fen."</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Turn to Stability</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market conditions in each month turned to a stable situation because the large batch of goods that had been stopped shooting this month had been taken by local and foreign factories. (Shen Da, Xiang Xin, Nanjing Datong in Shanghai reached more than 100 cars, and the hearts of the people outside the line inevitably turned to fixed speculative purchases. The households rose up to operate, and the market atmosphere was slightly stable. However, there were still continued orders for foreign wheat, such as Victoria No. 2 white wheat, with a transaction volume of more than 10,000 tons for the factory, with a cheap price of 3.78 to 3.8 taels. Therefore, this kind of return is still not allowed to be optimistic. As a result, September was better by 3 "fen" compared to the previous day, October was better by 1 "fen," November was better by 4 "fen," December was better by 2 "fen," and January did not move. The current wheat market situation was affected by the ending of the standard for this month, and the factory stomach was very dull, dragging down 7-8 "fen," with the opening price of Zhenjiang wheat at 3.65 taels, Benniu, Zhitang, and Yangzhou wheat at 3.7 taels, and Taicang wheat at 3.57 taels, totaling more than 1,200 bales, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods, New Longan from Tongan Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The quality of longan produced in Tongan has always been considered good. The harvest this year is quite poor. The new goods were first transported by Chengdu and Yuanan on two wheels yesterday, with dozens of boxes arriving. It is said that the initial cost is very high, and the top grade requires a price of 50 taels. Approximately, samples can be seen today. The initial opening price will not be far from the mark, as the number of new goods is small.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, British and French Supplement Yellow and White Factory Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was still difficult for the silk market in the local foreign banks to make progress. Telegrams from New York and other places did not forward, and the sales of Chinese silk to the United States did not move. Yesterday, only British and French banks supplemented the shortage of yellow and white factory silk. It is estimated that Yihe and others imported 20 packages of Shanghai white factory silk and 18 packages of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and the price is still firm.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Tea Trading is Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi was eagerly sought by British banks such as Xiehe, Jinlong, Doud, and Tianxiang. The total sales in the city were more than 2,000 boxes, and the transaction was extremely prosperous. The selling price was also very firm. Gongxi green tea and the Russian Aid Association also had more intentions. The statistical inventory of green tea in the market was no more than 30,000 boxes. The European banks, in view of the depletion of inventory, sent telegrams to solicit opinions from overseas tea merchants, preparing to search for large-scale procurement.</p>
<h3>Pitou Ningfeng Opens a Large Batch of Spot Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Ningfeng Trading Division has recently opened more than 100 pieces of spot goods, and the price is very cheap. It is estimated that the Changqing Serge for crossing the river for a banquet is sold for 2.325 taels, the Pengshou Tu Yuan Chang blue-gray Serge is 2.55 taels, the Qibaolian large checkered flannel is 2.2 taels, the semi-colored twill with dark stripes is 2.5 taels, the new herringbone twill is 3.6 taels, the blue and white robbing Ma hanging flannel is 1.1 taels, and the shoe felt bottom is 6.75 taels. The 950 and 1000 Yuan Chang shoe felt flannels are both sold for 5.65 taels. The buyers rushed to buy them, and it is said that most of them have been sold out. The remaining ones are only silk robbing Chunhua flannel and Yantiao flannel.</p>
<h3>Hardware, the City Has a Turning Point of Hope</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's hardware trend was more progressive than the previous day. Guest routes such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Niuzhuang, Andong, and Fujian all had a purchasing appetite, and the inland rivers were also eager to move. Because of this, the city's situation was no longer as deserted as before, and the goods also had a future movement due to the pending guest sales, so they all showed a tough trend. Here are the main market conditions:</p>
<p>More than 1,000 Sheets of British Steel Plate Shipped to Qingdao Yesterday, the Qingdao gang was very excited about the 7.5-cent British steel plate business. It is estimated that a total of more than 1,200 pieces were handled, and the price was estimated at 6.4 taels. Other gangs in Tianjin and Niuzhuang also had business, so the market situation was quite encouraging.</p>
<p>Tinplate Speculators Buy in 2,000 Boxes Most of the current sales of tinplate are at a loss, so most people in the business are frowning. However, judging from the market situation yesterday, this product has a revitalizing trend. In general, practical manufacturers have begun to buy, and the egg factory gang is also collecting endlessly, and the speculator gang that suddenly rises has handled more than 2,000 boxes. The total daily transaction is as high as 3,800 boxes. If there are such sales every day, then it is not difficult to sell out the 7-80,000 boxes of tinplate remaining in Shanghai, and the turning point of the market can be expected.</p>
<p>New Lead Wire Sales Are Very Active Yesterday, the sales of new lead wire were very active. Inland river gangs such as Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang all had a good appetite, and the Tianjin gang's purchases were also very large. The price of the goods was raised by people and the price secretly rose. It is estimated that 16 to 20 are 13.5 taels per "dan", and 21 to 25 are 18.75 taels. It is estimated that there are a total of four or five hundred "dan" of goods that have been opened.</p>

<p>Since the decision to jointly establish an office by various sectors of the city to accommodate disaster victims, preparations have been actively underway. The day before yesterday, Section Chief Feng Min of the Social Affairs Bureau, together with Section Chief Mo of the Public Works Bureau, visited various open spaces in the north and south of the city to select locations for building shelters. The old base of the Liuying Road camp in Zhabei was temporarily chosen as the first shelter. Yesterday, they also invited representatives of construction companies, including Zhang Xiaoliang, to a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau. In the afternoon, Section Chief Mo went to plan the construction. It was decided that construction would begin tomorrow and that a portion would be completed within the week, ready for disaster victims from the north and south of the city to move in. The construction of the shelter includes not only living quarters, but also complete facilities for bathing, barbering, cooking, toilets, treatment, temporary wards, laundry, storage, offices, security, and even a morgue. The houses are built with reed mats and can withstand wind and rain. The wooden planks for the floors are provided by timber construction companies. It is said that if more disaster victims arrive in the future, they will be accommodated in the open space on Zhoujiazui Road.</p>
<p>The fire department will be responsible for fire protection, and the Public Utilities Bureau will temporarily provide water and electricity. It is also planned to install fire extinguishing chemicals to prepare for any emergencies. It is planned to borrow equipment from family industrial societies, and compensation will be paid for any losses.</p>
<p>The office, scheduled to be established, held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday, attended by Pan Gongzhan, Hu Hongji, Chen Xizeng (representing Shen Zengfu), Ye Huijun, and Feng Liutang. In addition to discussing various important cases, the heads and team leaders of each division were also decided. The head of the General Affairs Division is Feng Liutang, with Sun Yishan as deputy; the head of the Supply Division is Wang Bin, with Xi Guansheng as deputy; the head of the Health Division is Wu Liguan, with Shen Hao as deputy; the head of the Security Division is Shen Zengfu, with Fan Shangkun as deputy.

In the Health Division, the heads of the Epidemic Prevention Group, Medical Affairs Group, and Pharmaceutical Affairs Group are yet to be determined. Wu Weide is the head of the Child Welfare Group, with Liu Wang Limin as deputy, and Wang Junsheng is the head of the Aftercare Group. It was also decided that the office will be established on September 1, temporarily located at the Nanshi Office of the Bean and Rice Industry at No. 239 Zhonghua Road, north of Dadongmen. At that time, each division will hold divisional meetings to discuss all matters.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau received news yesterday that disaster victims had been transported to Shanghai by the Jiang Hua steamship and immediately telegraphed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to confirm the time of arrival. They immediately sent personnel to escort the arriving disaster victims to the shelters with the assistance of the first district of the Public Security Bureau. The Tongren Fuyuantang is providing daily rations, but some are still begging outside, claiming they have no food. The Public Security Bureau has ordered the district offices to pay attention to this. In addition, many disaster victims arriving in Shanghai have had their clothes and money confiscated. The Social Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to investigate and has instructed the Tongren Fuyuantang to purchase and distribute clothing for them. Since the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to various steamship companies to request advance notice before the arrival of disaster victims, the Taikoo Company now notifies the Social Affairs Bureau the day before whenever a Jiang steamship is about to arrive with disaster victims, so that no mistakes are made.</p>
<h3>Xu Pingxuan Went to Anhui for Relief Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Declaration of the Disaster Area Rescue Team</h3>
<p>At this time of transition between summer and autumn, mountain floods and sudden rises in river levels have caused widespread inundation along the rivers. Houses have been destroyed, and people and animals have been swept away. The tragic situation is beyond description. Those fortunate enough to escape the disaster are also displaced, hungry, and cold, crying out for food and unable to survive. We Boy Scouts have always been responsible for helping others and are compatriots. How can we sit idly by and watch tens of millions of disaster victims wait to die? We would be disloyal to our responsibilities and unjust to our fellow countrymen. Moreover, we Boy Scouts are skilled in rescue techniques and have long been familiar with them. At this time of widespread disaster and rampant disease, we can use our skills to provide courageous assistance so that disaster victims can be reborn and avoid joining the ranks of the dead. In view of this, we have organized a disaster area rescue team to go to various disaster areas to provide rescue and fulfill the duties of the Boy Scouts. We hope that all Boy Scouts in the city will actively participate and that the team will be ready to depart soon. Chinese Boy Scouts Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Anti-Opium Society</h3>
<p>The Treaty of Nanking, a Humiliating Alliance, Ninety-Nine Years of National Shame Still Endure</p>
<p>The Anti-Opium Society of the Chinese Nation's August 29th Memorial Declaration states: August 29th marks the anniversary of China's disastrous defeat in the Anglo-Chinese Opium War. The British coerced China into signing the Treaty of Nanking, opening five ports for trade, ceding Hong Kong, and demanding over twenty million in reparations—a major commemorative day of national humiliation. Although eighty-nine years have passed and that humiliating alliance has become a regrettable part of history, the cession of land and payment of indemnities, the scars of the past, have not faded. Unequal treaties still hold sway, and the opium scourge spreads ever more rampantly. The nation's peril is like a pile of eggs. We Chinese, having learned from bitter experience, are deeply impacted. It is not just a matter of undiminished sorrow; our resentment has grown with time, filling our breasts, almost a million times more intense than on the day of that incident eighty-nine years ago. Back during the Daoguang era of the Qing Dynasty, people from all walks of life in our country, recognizing the harm of imported opium, which could lead to national ruin, familial destruction, racial extermination, and the annihilation of clans, rose up in opposition, vowing to eradicate this morning's repast [referring to the daily consumption of opium]. At that time, the Qing court still possessed vigor, resolutely issuing edicts to ban it. Guangzhou was the crucial hub for foreign opium entering China. Indian raw opium was transported and sold inland, the people were poisoned by it, the source of wealth was exploited, and the threat to the very heart of the nation was imminent. The Qing court, aware of this, specially promoted Lin Zexu, an early advocate of opium prohibition, to serve as the Governor-General of Liangguang. Lin Zexu, with gnashing teeth, compared opium to a raging flood, and after arriving in Guangdong, he rigorously cracked down on it, allowing no leniency. He seized over twenty thousand chests of British merchants' opium and publicly burned them at Humen in Guangzhou. The British, unwilling to accept this, requested to send warships to attack our country's coastal areas. Lin Zexu resisted them, but unexpectedly, slanderers at the emperor's side fabricated false accusations. The Qing court was greatly shaken, issuing an edict to negotiate peace and exiling Lin Zexu to Yili to appease the British. Consequently, the so-called thirteen articles of the Treaty of Nanking, including unreasonable demands for apology, trade, indemnity, and cession of territory, were signed. Alas, gathering iron from the nine provinces [to forge weapons] led to a great mistake. From then on, it opened the door for the powers to plot against us, planted the banner of China's surrender, and ushered in countless instances of national humiliation. It formed a deadly trap of internal and external troubles for China. Today, the poison has spread throughout the country, sores and wounds are everywhere, and disasters are quietly brewing. In the provinces of Fujian and Anhui, farmers abandoned grain crops to plant opium, leading to famine. In the Wuhan area, it is said that local authorities privately deposited funds earmarked for repairing weirs and building dikes in opium companies that were subsequently closed, resulting in the recent devastating floods. How can one not be disheartened by such poisoning? Yet, some still wish to exploit opium to enrich themselves. The recently nationwide publicized and internationally shocking opium public sales policy is clear evidence of merchants and corrupt officials being blinded by money, completely forgetting the harm. Nothing could be more regrettable to the martyrs and more ridiculed by foreigners. Our society, entrusted with the will of our compatriots, adhering to the grand aim of Sun Yat-sen's anti-opium legacy, is committed to eradicating opium and all narcotic drugs. We feel particularly deeply saddened by this annual memorial of national shame, the Treaty of Nanking. Observing the current laxity in opium prohibition, the lurking dangers, and the rampant spread of poison, the situation is even worse than it was eighty-nine years ago. For seven years, we have tirelessly voiced our concerns, hoping to gain the sympathy and response of our countrymen, and to work together to eliminate this immense disaster that burns the head and destroys the feet. With unified public sentiment, reasoned arguments, and self-reliance, and with the will of the people forming a city, we will wield our weapons to drive back the sun. Our society's responsibility lies here. We are willing to be at the forefront of all compatriots, closely monitoring the authorities' future opium prohibition measures, resisting any policy with a public sales nature, and ensuring that the opium prohibition authorities fully realize Sun Yat-sen's and Lin Zexu's legacies, continuing the prohibition to save the situation. At the same time, we will justly and forcefully argue with the powers to abolish all unequal treaties, eliminating their reliance so that prohibition can be enforced without obstacles. Imperialists will not dare to further their schemes to poison China. Our society will do its utmost and is willing to encourage all compatriots. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Pilots' Association Strives for Pilotage Rights</h3>
<p>Our country's pilotage rights have been infringed upon for decades. The management of pilotage in Shanghai has been under the jurisdiction of the consular body, the Merchant Guild, and the Customs. The central naval, financial, and transportation ministries, in order to recover pilotage rights, specifically discussed management and pilot selection methods, which have been approved by the State Council. The pilotage areas have been divided, and the selection of personnel for the management agencies has also been clearly stipulated. The Shanghai Pilots' Association believes that the new method still vests power in the Customs Commissioner and is similar to the old system, so it has raised objections. The management organization and pilot selection methods proposed by the three ministries and the objections are recorded as follows after thorough investigation by our reporter:</p>
<p>The management organization established by the Ministry of Finance, Navy, and Transportation divides the Chinese pilotage areas into three sections along the Yangtze River: from Wusong to Hankou is the lower section, with the management committee based in Shanghai; from Hankou to Yichang is the middle section, with the management committee based in Hankou; and above Yichang is the upper section, with the management committee based in Yichang. The committee's organization and personnel are stipulated to include the Customs Commissioner, the River Patrol Officer, and a representative from the local merchant guild. For the pilotage management committees at coastal ports, the committee is located in Shanghai and consists of the Customs Commissioner, the Port Bureau Director, the Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, a representative from the merchant guild, and a representative from the foreign merchant guild, with the Customs Commissioner as chairman.</p>
<p>The pilot selection committee at coastal ports and along the Yangtze River establishes a pilot selection committee in any place where there is a committee managing pilotage affairs. The organization and personnel consist of the local Customs Bureau Director, the Port Bureau Director, and two senior, experienced captains of Chinese nationality, with clear stipulations for the qualifications of pilot candidates to prepare for the recovery of river pilotage rights. On the Yangtze River, the committee is organized by the River Patrol Officer and the chief pilot.</p>
<p>The Pilots' Association strives to secure management rights. The Shanghai Chinese Merchant Marine Pilots' Association, in order to strive for pilotage management rights, sent a telegram to the Ministry of the Navy, stating: "A news report stated that the Ministry of Finance's plan to recover pilotage management is being negotiated by Customs Commissioner-General Maze and various consuls and foreign shipping companies, and it has been agreed that the Customs will manage it. While our association is preparing to establish a Chinese Pilotage Association, we are following government laws and regulations to prevent non-Chinese citizens from serving as pilots. We were very surprised to hear this news. The pilotage business is related to territorial sovereignty. All the conspiracies of foreigners monopolizing pilotage in China, all the past crimes that harmed our country, and the behind-the-scenes actions to preserve their remaining influence have been fully exposed by the Merchant Marine Pilots' Association to the relevant ministries on July 26th of this year, requesting that fundamental measures be taken to eliminate them and prevent future troubles. Unexpectedly, those who eat meat are base, only knowing to follow old ways and not caring about mistakes. Foreigners have again taken advantage of the situation and openly used deceptive tactics, manipulating everyone in their hands. Consider the past: allowing foreigners to establish a pilotage company in our country was the achievement of Mr. Hart, a meritorious official of the Customs. For decades, the important figures in that pilotage company, those in power, have been successive Customs Commissioners. The government already knows that employing foreign Customs Commissioners is a humiliating and power-stripping act in unequal treaties, and it also knows that the seizure of pilotage harms national defense and aids the enemy. It cannot be ignored. Why not change course, completely resolving this issue for the long-term benefit of the country, and instead use the tricks of a monkey trainer, deceiving our people and the world? If the news report is true, then the Ministry of Finance is contradicting itself. Whether it is being deceived or has other intentions, it cannot explain itself to the people of the country and is violating Sun Yat-sen's policy and the goal of recovering lost national rights. The Customs's duty is to manage tariffs, while pilotage rights belong to the nation. The lines are clear, and the policies are distinct. Knowing that foreigners are occupying pilotage rights, under the bright daylight of the ruling party and nation, before the remaining evils are completely eliminated, they dare to act as accomplices, sacrificing sovereignty and disrupting the government's maritime system, which is extremely illegal. According to international norms, interference in internal affairs is not allowed. Mr. Maze has already committed a great indiscretion by not treating us as an independent country. If we do not take action, the nation will be in danger. Our association feels this is a dangerous situation and dares to speak out. We earnestly request that the authorities prioritize national defense, make every effort to uphold our rights, prevent the Customs Commissioner from managing pilotage, and devise proper methods to safeguard our sovereignty. This would be very fortunate."</p>
<h3>Special News from the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>The Taiping Steamer Runs Aground. The Taiping Steamer, owned by the Zhongwei Company of this city, departed from Shanghai for Fuzhou to transport goods. It encountered a strong wind on the Tongsha sea area. The captain dropped two anchors, but the wind force was too great, and the waves broke both anchors. The extremely thick ninety-foot iron chains were also broken. The ship was carried by the waves onto the sandbar. Fortunately, there were no reefs, and the hull was not breached. The captain telegraphed Shanghai for help. Yesterday, the Shanghai office dispatched a ship to the scene, and when the tide rose, it was towed out of danger and brought back to Shanghai. The loss of the two anchors is estimated at over twenty thousand taels. Yesterday, new anchors were fitted, and it set sail again.</p>
<p>The Poyang Passengers Rescued. The Taikoo Company's Yangtze River steamer Poyang ran aground downstream from Anqing. The company has dispatched a ship to tow it, but it has not yet been pulled off the sandbar. The passengers, who were traveling from Hankou to Shanghai, were transported by the company's Guangzhou steamer, which was sent to the scene.</p>
<p>Goods to Southern Anhui Stop Loading in Wuhu. Since the sudden flooding began in Wuhu the day before yesterday, many fields and houses along the river have been destroyed. Goods from southern Anhui to Shanghai have been blocked by the flood and cannot be loaded in Wuhu, and goods from Shanghai cannot be unloaded due to the water barrier. Furthermore, it is cut off from the surrounding countryside, so exports have come to a standstill.</p>

<h3>The Seawall in Front of the Wusong Fortunate is Now Safe</h3>
<p>All the officers and soldiers of the fortress have been rushing to block and protect the seawall for three days and nights</p>
<p>Commander Deng urgently telegraphed the military department and various sectors of Songbao to raise funds to reward the troops</p>
<p>The North and South fortresses and the Lion Grove Fortress belonging to the Wusong Fortress Command are all built along the seawall. The seawall is divided into inner and outer embankments, and outside the outer embankment there are protective wooden piles and stacked stones. During the recent hurricane, torrential rain, and storm surge, all the protective wooden piles behind the command headquarters to the North Fortress were washed away, and the stones were also submerged and disappeared. The outer embankment lost its support, and more than 288 zhang [a Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters] collapsed in one night. Seawater poured into the inner embankment, unable to withstand the impact, and another 42 zhang collapsed one after another. The wooden and stone piles of the outer embankment of the Lion Grove Fortress were also completely washed away. The situation was extremely precarious. Fortress Commander Deng Zhenquan, realizing that the seawalls were still collapsing, would not only cause significant damage to the fortresses but also flood the counties of Hupao, Taijia, etc., which relied on the seawall for protection. He immediately issued an emergency order, ordering Deputy Adjutant Shen Zitian to supervise all the officers and soldiers of the fortresses and the garrison battalion, to take turns guarding the embankment day and night, using sacks to fill soil and stones to block the breaches. Fortunately, the inner embankment was preserved, and after three days and nights, the officers and soldiers were exhausted. Commander Deng, aware that although the seawall was fortunate not to collapse, the surge was still dangerous, and the temporary rescue work by the officers and soldiers was unsustainable due to the lack of both labor and materials. Moreover, the autumn flood tide in August was rapidly approaching, and the consequences would be disastrous. Therefore, Commander Deng urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Military Affairs yesterday, requesting that senior officials be dispatched immediately with substantial funds to inspect and repair the seawall to strengthen national defense. Yesterday, people from all walks of life in Songbao were greatly concerned when they heard the news of the seawall's danger. They were deeply impressed by the efforts of all the officers and soldiers of the fortress to rescue the situation and endure hardship. They are currently raising funds and will send representatives to reward them soon.</p>

More than 50 houses were also destroyed, and over a thousand wooden piles were broken. Countless soil and stones collapsed, causing great panic among the local population. Blocking efforts are underway in various locations. (3) During the storm surge on the night of the 25th, the seawall in Songjiang County was damaged. Most of the damage was concentrated in Xitang. In the first section, piles were broken, stones were scattered, and soil was lost. In the second section, piles were broken, stones were scattered, and the stone seawall east of the Longzhu Temple was exposed for two to three zhang. In the third section, the top beams of the new construction were damaged in five places, the wallboards behind the unfilled areas were pierced, and the outer horizontal supports were also broken. Much of the newly filled soil was washed away, and the blocks and lower gently sloping embankment were completely scattered. In the fourth section, many wooden piles were broken, detaching from the soil embankment. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth sections had many broken piles, scattered stones, and lost soil.

<h3>Smuggling Ancient Books Detained. Customs in Tianjin Seizes Two Hundred Boxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain shipping bureau in this city received a telegram from Tianjin, stating that on the 27th, Customs officials in Tianjin discovered a large number of ancient books being smuggled for export on a certain steamer. There were a total of two hundred boxes. The Customs stated that the smuggling of ancient books for export had long been banned by the Ministries of Finance and Education, and there were special regulations in place. Now, the books were secretly shipped out, violating the prohibition. The Tianjin Customs detained the two hundred boxes of smuggled books and stored them in the Customs warehouse for temporary confiscation. An investigation will be conducted on the smugglers for punishment. The shipping company will also be punished for violating the regulations and unauthorized loading. It is reported that a fine of one hundred taels has been imposed.</p>
<h3>Postal Worker Steals Money Order from a Letter</h3>
<p>Totaling 144 Yuan and 3 Jiao</p>
<p>Chen Liezhang, a Yongbo native and postal worker at the North Sichuan Road Post Office, secretly opened a registered letter between July 10th and 11th, sent by Qian Lin'gen from Tokyo, Japan, to Jin A'gui at No. 15 Pishaner Road in the French Concession of Shanghai. Inside was a bank money order for 144 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen, which he secretly used. He also carved Jin's seal and stamped it on the receipt. Recently, Jin returned to his hometown and wrote a letter to Qian in Tokyo to borrow money. Qian was very surprised upon receiving the letter and sent Jin the money order receipt. The other day, Jin sent someone to the General Post Office to investigate. After detailed inspection by Investigator Tao Kangcheng, it was discovered that the registered letter was delivered by Chen Liezhang. Furthermore, his past behavior was erratic. Chen was summoned for surveillance, and the Hongkou Police Station dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to interrogate him strictly. He finally confessed to the crime, implicating Wang Deshi, who resided at No. 2 Xixinqiao in the French Concession. The detectives rushed to arrest Wang, but he had already fled. Chen Liezhang was taken to the police station for detention and transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. According to Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station, the details of the case were presented, and the fake receipt was submitted for inspection. Subsequently, Investigator Tao of the General Post Office provided further evidence, stating that the money order in the registered letter sent by Qian Lin'gen from Tokyo to Shanghai was not exchanged through the Post Office, so the stolen money should be recovered from the defendant's family. Ren Yusheng, who claimed to represent Jin A'gui, also gave a brief account of the case. The defendant was questioned, and he stammered and claimed that he was instigated by Wang Deshi, who was still at large, and that the fake seal was also carved by Wang. He is now willing to compensate the plaintiff for the money and asks for leniency. Judge Xiao Xieye ordered Chen Liezhang to be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing in a week.</p>
<h3>The Courage of the Norwegian Ship's First Mate is Admirable</h3>
<p>Braving Dangerous Waves, He Rescued Five People from a Sand Barge</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening News, during the hurricane that swept through on Tuesday, the waves outside the Wusong port were as high as mountains. A sand barge was unable to avoid the storm and was sunk by the waves. Only five boatmen managed to cling to the mast and remained afloat on the sea surface. Just as they were in mortal danger, the Norwegian ship Fengmoor happened to spot them. The first mate, disregarding the danger, immediately took three crew members and launched a lifeboat to rescue them. After rescuing the five, the wind and waves were too strong, and despite their best efforts, they could not return to their own ship. Moreover, with the small boat and the large number of people, there was a constant risk of capsizing. Fortunately, the Danish ship Nimsk threw down a long rope, which the people in the lifeboat grabbed, allowing them to climb onto the Danish ship. Only after the wind had subsided somewhat were the first mate and crew able to return to their own ship. The rescued people were given hot tea and dry clothes by the Danish ship and were taken to Wusong to disembark. Without the first mate and his colleagues' courage and selflessness in rescuing them, the windstorm losses would have included the lives of five more people.</p>
<h3>Wireless Communication Remained Smooth During the Severe Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>Since the widespread flooding in various regions, wired communication lines have been disrupted. The extremely important Shanghai-Hankou telecommunications rely solely on wireless transmission. Therefore, the Shanghai Wireless Telegraph Station has been extremely busy recently. In addition to its own receiving and sending of telegrams, it relays an average of over three thousand telegrams daily for the Telegraph Bureau. During the severe storm and rain yesterday in Shanghai, the Huashang Electric Company's power supply was cut off due to the impact, causing a slight disruption to the Wireless Telegraph Station's remote control lines. However, the station had made prior preparations, and communication with the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Fujian and Guangdong regions remained open. However, due to the congestion of telegrams, only urgent and official/military telegrams were accepted. Since the morning before yesterday (the 27th), the power plant has resumed normal supply, and the remote control lines have also been mostly restored. Wireless telegrams to Europe, America, and various parts of China are all flowing normally.</p>
<h3>Dong Heling's Wife Murder Case: Dong Li Dies from Severe Injuries</h3>
<p>Correction Letter from the Deceased's Older Brother</p>
<p>The case of Dong Heling murdering his wife in Cunshan Lane, Caojiadu, Shanghai West, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The injured Dong Li died from her severe injuries yesterday morning. The murderer, Dong Heling, was transferred from the Public Security Bureau to the court for trial. However, last night, Li Jincai, the deceased's older brother, brought a letter to this newspaper requesting a correction. The letter is published below:</p>
<p>To the Honorable Editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news in yesterday's (28th) issue of your newspaper about Dong Heling stabbing his wife at No. 5 Cunshan Lane, Caojiadu. However, some of the information in the article does not match the facts. Dong Heling initially worked in the rice business, but due to his unsavory reputation in his hometown, he had to bring his wife to Shanghai and rely on his relative Liang Zhaoting for help. Liang is skilled in socializing and took pity on their poverty, temporarily taking them in and providing them with food and lodging. Liang is an important employee at the Edison Electric Cannon Factory, so he introduced Heling to work at the factory. Initially, he was well-behaved, but later he repeatedly violated regulations and was fired by the Westerners. After becoming unemployed, he often demanded money from the victim to spend. However, the victim also worked to make a living, so where would she get large sums of money for him to waste? Initially, she remembered their marital vows and had to resort to pawning items to make up for it. Unexpectedly, Dong Heling became accustomed to this. Over time, all the winter and summer clothes were pawned off. He incurred substantial debts. Recently, he wanted to pawn off more of the victim's clothes but did not get her consent, leading to a quarrel and ultimately a bloody incident. However, the weapon was only found under the bed at 9:15 AM on the 28th and sent to the police station for record-keeping. How could the newspaper on the same day report that there were three knives? This is one error. Furthermore, the victim's conduct was usually quite proper. Even while working at the factory, she always maintained good housekeeping habits, leaving early and returning late, being diligent and thrifty, and never behaving frivolously. This is known to all. We ask your newspaper to have its reporters conduct an on-site investigation. The victim has already suffered a tragic death, which is extremely pitiful, so it seems unkind to further damage her reputation. We request that your newspaper make a statement clarifying these points.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred People Died in the Yawo Sand Storm</h3>
<p>Only One-Third of the Bodies Were Recovered</p>
<p>During the recent severe wind and rain, the tide surged suddenly and unexpectedly. The residents of Wusong Sanjia, the outer waters of the mouth, Hengsha, Yawo Sand, and Shitou, were the first to be impacted. The residents of each sandbank were struck by the tidal waves and suffered tragic drownings. It is estimated that several hundred people died, and countless houses and straw sheds were blown over and collapsed. It was truly an unprecedented catastrophe. It is said that on the evening of that day in Yawo Sand, due to the huge surge rushing onto the beach, Beixinwei was the first to be destroyed. Residents who could not escape in time tragically drowned. After the incident, it was found that a total of over 120 men, women, old, and young had died. Only one-third of the bodies were recovered. The rest were either washed away by the tide or buried in the bellies of fish. Although other new and old sandbanks were also collapsed, fortunately, the residents were prepared, so there were fewer casualties. At that time, the straw sheds and thatched houses were destroyed as if they were swept away by the wind. At present, the villages and residences in the Beixinwei area have all become desolate. The flowers and rice in the fields were also destroyed, and the autumn harvest has become hopeless. The magnitude of the loss is evident.</p>
<h3>Zhao Weixian, Suspect in the Wei Kidnapping Case, Was Summoned Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Wei Tingrong, manager of the Banque Franco-Chinoise in the French Concession, was kidnapped on July 24th of the year before last, detectives from the French Concession police successively arrested Chen Zhongheng, Zhu Jingcheng, Lü Ruowang, and Cai Weicai. They confessed that the kidnapping was instigated by Wei's relative, Zhao Weixian. The police then went with Wei's son to Suzhou to arrest Zhao and bring him to Shanghai. He was escorted to the Second Special District Court and ordered to await a later date for interrogation. The details were reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the hearing was held again. The police brought the three suspects, Chen Zhongheng, Zhu Jingcheng, and Lü Ruowang, who had already been convicted, from the prison. Before the trial began, Judge Xiong ordered that no bystanders be allowed, except for the relatives of the suspects. First, Police Attorney Fei Xizhen presented the case. Zhao Weixian confessed that he was currently the commander of the Sixth Battalion of the Finance Office in Bengbu, under the command of Commander Wang, responsible for protecting the Jinpu Railway. He was previously the deputy commander of the Special Service Regiment of the Fourth Division of the Army. At this point, the defense attorney stated that the defendant, Zhao Weixian, was a current military officer and had been arrested while on leave to visit his family in Suzhou. According to the law, the defendant should be tried by a military court. Please verify. The judge said to Zhao, "Chen Zhongheng previously confessed that you instigated the kidnapping. Is this true?" Zhao replied, "I do not know Chen Zhongheng." The judge asked Chen Zhongheng and Lü Ruowang, "Do you know Zhao Weixian?" Chen and Lü replied, "Yes, we know him." Chen Zhongheng continued, "In 1929, I asked my friend Zhou Shuying to collect a debt. He arranged for me to talk at the rooftop garden of the Wing On Company. When I arrived, I met Zhao Weixian. Zhou introduced us. At that time, Zhao mentioned how bad Wei Tingrong was and wanted to kidnap him, asking me to help. He promised to repay my debt after the kidnapping was successful." Zhao Weixian's defense attorney stated, "On July 24th of the year before last, when Wei Tingrong was kidnapped, the defendant, Zhao Weixian, was still a coach in the Zhonghua Volunteer Corps and was very friendly with Wei. How could he have plotted the kidnapping? Later, Zhao Weixian resigned because Wei Tingrong falsely borrowed the name of the Volunteer Corps to solicit donations outside, filling his own pockets. Outsiders said that Zhao was an accomplice, so Zhao resigned and was framed by Wei." The witness Sun Xiangfu testified about the marriage arrangements between Zhao and Wei. At this point, it was late. Judge Xiong ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and await a later date for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Municipal Guoshu (National Arts) Museum Adds Training Ground at Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>Classes Scheduled to Begin on September 15th</p>
<p>The Municipal Guoshu Museum, recognizing that the Jing'an Temple area is a residential area lacking Guoshu organizations and opportunities for residents to learn boxing, has written to Jing'an Temple to borrow the temple's open space as a training ground. The temple's abbot, Zhifa, is usually enthusiastic about public welfare and has already established schools and hospitals in the temple. He has expressed great sympathy for the Guoshu Museum's application and has agreed to lend the space for free. Currently, the museum plans to establish a Taijiquan class in the temple first, scheduled to begin teaching on September 15th. It has already begun soliciting members in the vicinity. Local gentry, such as Long Yifei, Wang Hancheng, Zhang Pinshan, and Xu Wenyuan, are quite enthusiastic in supporting this effort. This is indeed good news for people in western Shanghai who want to learn boxing.</p>
<h3>Water Drained from Citibank</h3>
<p>Fortunes Remain Unaffected</p>
<p>The "Ta Mei Evening News" reported that the vault of Citibank was flooded to a depth of ten feet during the storm on Tuesday night. The fire truck drained the water from noon on Wednesday until 4:00 pm on Thursday. The employees then hurriedly opened the vault for inspection, and found that the vault had not been breached, the millions in cash it contained were completely unaffected, and the vault has since been reopened for normal use.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Welcomes "Thousand-Li Colt" (Qianliju)</h3>
<p>Guangdong Opera Star Qu Zhongwu (aka Qianliju) is regarded as an educator of society through drama. His relationship to society and the hearts of the people is of great importance. For over twenty years, he has performed in Guangdong, always adhering to the principles of promoting integrity, righteousness, and morality, avoiding anything strange or bizarre. This time he came to Shanghai to perform at the Guangdong Grand Theatre. The Municipal Education Bureau has been sending staff to the theatre daily to observe and review the scripts. The bureau believes that the plays performed by Qu are indeed incomparable to those who boast of being new, strange, and bizarre, and therefore praised him greatly. Yesterday afternoon, the 28th, in order to express their sympathy and support for Qu, they specially invited him to a tea party at the bureau. Qu arrived with his colleagues Bai Yutang and Li Haiquan, and ten others. The bureau sent Section Chief Li and various staff members to greet them. After the guests and hosts took their seats, Section Chief Li, on behalf of the bureau, expressed his welcome and commendation, saying that the bureau's review of various plays sought those that were concerned with society and the hearts of the people, and that only those performed by Mr. Qu met this criteria. They then discussed Cantonese opera for a long time. Finally, Section Chief Li also encouraged Qu and others to work hard in social education and hoped that Qu and others would perform more plays in Shanghai in order to correct the licentious society of Shanghai. The guests and hosts parted happily around 5:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Two Suzhou Thieves Caught in Shanghai</h3>
<p>At 1:25 AM yesterday, Wu County Public Security Bureau detectives Zhu Zhengxi and Gu Rongchang reported to the Zhabei Police Station that on August 7th, several thieves broke into the home of Yu Ding'an in Luxiang Town, Suzhou, and stole jewelry and silver, and injured the victim with knives. It was discovered that the criminals in this case were hiding at No. 494 Xiamen Road. They requested assistance in arresting them. The head constable ordered detectives to go to the address and arrest two Suzhou natives, Xu Arong, and Changzhou native, Jin Agou. A pistol and stolen goods, including gold rings, were seized. They were taken to the police station for detention and were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday morning. Police station lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the case. He did not object to the request from the Wu County Public Security Bureau to transfer the case. Subsequently, the victim, Yu Ding'an, testified that the seized stolen goods were indeed his. Detective Zhu also requested permission to transfer the case. When questioned, both defendants denied the charges. Judge Zhou Hanting reviewed the confession and ordered that the two defendants, along with the pistol and stolen goods, be handed over to the Wu County Public Security Bureau personnel to be taken back for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Cai Fengying Wants Divorce</h3>
<p>Sheets Stained With Blood and Tears, Her Heart Knotted with Bitterness</p>
<p>Zhu Cai Fengying, a young local woman residing at No. 77, Tiantong Lane, Tiantong Road, Disiwei Road, in the Chinese district, previously engaged lawyer Wang Zuxun to file a petition with the Conciliation Division of the District Court, accusing her husband, Zhu Xingchang, of abuse, abandonment, neglect, and failure to provide support, and requesting a divorce. Presiding Judge Chen Bingxin held a hearing. As conciliation failed, he ordered a formal lawsuit to be filed. Zhu Cai Fengying has now engaged lawyer Wang to formally file a divorce suit, stating in her petition that "habitual abuse makes it impossible to live together until old age." The plaintiff, at the age of twenty, was married to the defendant at her mother's insistence, through a matchmaker. The wedding ceremony was held on November 24th in the Yuanyuan Hotel on Sanma Road, Shanghai. After the marriage, they lived together harmoniously and lovingly. Within four years, she gave birth to three children. However, due to her weak health and poor nutrition, she became frail and thin. In addition, she had to care for the children and breastfeed them herself. She did all the housework without any help. She had no time for personal grooming. She always followed the teachings of the three obediences and practiced the virtues of the four qualities. She originally hoped to become a virtuous helpmate, but everything went wrong, and her sheets were stained with blood and tears, her heart knotted with bitterness. The defendant was unkind and unreasonable. He constantly mocked and ridiculed her, day and night. One moment he would praise her for their happy marriage, comparing her to Xi Shi, the next moment he would call her a worthless woman, comparing her to Wu Yan. His words were铭心镂骨, causing her great pain. His demeanor was like that of a wild beast, scaring her to death. Even the slightest disagreement would provoke him to punch and kick her. If she was slow to beg for forgiveness, he would try to bite her. The plaintiff's chest and abdomen were injured by his fists and feet, and her arms were injured by his teeth. The police station and her co-residents can testify to this. The injury report and the marks on her body can prove this. This happened on the night of July 26th. Later, he forced her to go to lawyer Shen Yiqian to discuss divorce, forcing her to sign a written agreement, stating that if she wanted to repay the advance payment, she had to hand over her son. The plaintiff requested alimony and the right to raise her son, but they could not agree. The negotiation failed. The defendant then threatened to snatch the son away and shoot her with bullets. Anyone with a human heart would be unable to endure this. Looking back on the abuse she has suffered over the years, it is more than just a few instances. Alas, beauty fades and love wanes, a common lament throughout history. Men are strong and women are weak, so where is equality? The plaintiff wants to protect her remaining years, so she seeks a divorce. This is the first legal request. The defendant's former wife left behind three sons. The plaintiff has three children, but only her son remains. He is three years old, not yet two weeks. The defendant is cruel and does not care for him. If the son is handed over to him, his care will not be sufficient. If something goes wrong, the foundation of the nation will be harmed. If she is forced to leave, she is willing to give up her son and raise him for ten years to create a national citizen. The plaintiff requests that the defendant provide her with 1,200 yuan for child support and 1,200 yuan for nanny expenses. The plaintiff also requests that the defendant return the 200 yuan in rent advance and pay her 1,200 yuan in alimony. This is the second legal request. Therefore, she respectfully submits this petition, hoping that the court will show compassion, insight, and fairness, and promptly set a date for a hearing to determine the truth, grant the divorce, and order the defendant to pay the plaintiff 1,400 yuan in alimony and rent advance in one lump sum, and pay 2,400 yuan for child support and nanny expenses in installments, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Qufei specially opened the Sixth Tribunal for a hearing. The defendant, Zhu Xingchang, did not appear. Only the plaintiff, Zhu Cai Fengying, and her lawyer appeared in court, stating that she was 26 years old and recounting the events. The judge said, "This court did not summon the defendant today because it needs to investigate the case. Therefore, it has specially summoned the plaintiff for questioning. This case will not be debated today. It is scheduled for September 1st for further investigation and questioning." After the announcement, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Opening of Dongjiadu Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>Cai Zengji, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, issued Bulletin No. 178 yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of the Dongjiadu vegetable market, the Nanshi Tax Collection Office reported that it was ordered to take over the Dongjiadu vegetable market. All arrangements for the market and the procedures for connecting water and installing lights have been completed separately. It is requested that the market officially open on September 1st and that the Public Security Bureau be instructed to inform all stallholders who won the lottery last time to move in for business.

He was accompanied by the store's accountant, Gu Jinhua. When they reached the vicinity of the Dayang Bridge on Jiaotong Road, two robbers suddenly appeared. One held a pistol and wore a white shirt and pants. They robbed Jin Guoquan of all the 700 yuan he had collected and fled north. Jin Guoquan reported the incident to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Association Promotes Children's Literature</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Association operates a total of ten Ningbo Shanghai Public Schools, with over 5,000 students. A school affairs director is specially appointed, with Wu Yaqin holding the position for more than ten years. He has single-handedly shouldered the heavy responsibility, doing his best in all aspects of "economy" and "facilities," resulting in achievements that are the best among Shanghai's primary schools. Recently, Mr. Wu, in view of the fact that over 5,000 primary school students urgently need proper entertainment during their spare time, and at the same time, in view of the fact that many of the children's books on the market are socialized and have superstitious overtones, which is not appropriate, he proposed to improve children's literature. Coincidentally, the Modern Bookstore, founded by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Hong Xuefan, and Zhang Jinglu, has a children's reading club that publishes a hundred kinds of primary school student series. After Mr. Wu examined the contents of the series and confirmed that they were beneficial for children to read, he strongly promoted them and invested in the bookstore. On one hand, he accompanied the director of the association, Wang Beiping, to various public schools to solicit members. The students who heard the news joined enthusiastically. It is heard that in order to encourage children to join the reading club, the membership fee is only two yuan, which can give one thirty-five books, and fifteen kinds of benefits, eight grand awards, five big awards and so on, all of which are detailed in the club charter. (Letters are sent immediately upon request,) It is heard that the local membership office is the Modern Bookstore on Fourth Road, and the overseas membership office is the Modern Bookstore in Shunzhengli, Haining Road. The general office also heard that the association has more than 2,000 members at home and abroad.</p>

Manager Huang Huaisheng claimed illness and refused to meet, intentionally delaying the matter. Director Hong Ji, who caused the tragedy, knew that he could not shirk responsibility and also hid away. The deceased's parents believed that Hong had caused someone's death and refused to provide compensation, which showed that his conscience was extinguished and he was unreasonable. They now plan to go to Hong's home in Xi Yingli, Changzhou, to negotiate. They will also have their relatives appeal to various authorities for handling and plan to state their reasons to the film industry and guilds, requesting that Hong's directing qualifications be revoked to prevent future troubles.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Death of Qian Yunhe</h3>
<h3>Unidentified Male Corpse on the Side of Pushen Road</h3>
<p>At around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, an unidentified male corpse was found on the side of Pushen Road at the Zhabei Pushen Villa. The corpse was about thirty years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and flowered foreign cloth pants. There were blue and purple blood stains on his ribs, suggesting that he had been beaten to death and abandoned there. The Fourth District Police Station sent police officers to investigate and immediately notified the local guarantor, Jin Santu, and Wang Shaoting, to report to the District Court for an examination. Inspector Yang Jian arrived at the scene for an examination and determined that the corpse had indeed died from injuries. He ordered the charitable organization to collect the corpse and await the arrest of the murderer.</p>
<h3>Contribution of the American Allied Banking Corporation</h3>
<p>Issue Short-Term Savings Certificate with Safe Dividends</p>
<p>The American Allied Banking Corporation, located at No. 17 The Bund, is organized with reference to the highest standards of famous savings banks in various countries around the world. It is Shanghai's only pure savings bank. It not only does not speculate, but also does not engage in commercial transactions. Even for a small amount of one yuan in savings deposits, both principal and interest are guaranteed. Therefore, investment is stable and seeks only safe operation. Since its operation, its reputation has been high. With simple and convenient procedures and agile service, it is praised by the society. It has recently launched "Short-Term Savings Certificate with Safe Dividends", divided into two categories, A and B. Category A is divided into six types: five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, and one hundred yuan. Monthly savings, upon maturity after five years and one month, can be exchanged for guaranteed principal and interest of 350 yuan, 700 yuan, 1,050 yuan, 1,400 yuan, 1,750 yuan, and 7,000 yuan respectively. Category B is divided into five types: five, ten, fifteen, twenty, and twenty-five yuan. Monthly savings, upon maturity after three years and one month, can be exchanged for guaranteed principal and interest of 200 yuan, 400 yuan, 600 yuan, and 1,000 yuan respectively. In addition to obtaining guaranteed fixed principal and interest, both categories of depositors can also share in the dividends earned by the bank from the use of savings, and can enjoy the benefits of accidental injury insurance without paying insurance premiums. If a depositor is injured in an accident and unable to work, the insurance company will pay the savings on their behalf. If the depositor dies as a result, the savings that are due but unpaid on the savings certificate will be deemed to have been paid and can be immediately exchanged for a fixed amount of cash to meet urgent needs according to the discounting method. The consolidation of its benefits, the suitability of the term, and the comprehensiveness of the guarantee are unprecedented in Shanghai. Therefore, since its launch, those who recognize the savings have come one after another, and have exceeded thousands of people.</p>

The new ticket sellers are still on strike. The various situations yesterday are publicly recorded below.</p>

<h3>Returning Visitor from Mexico Talks About Anti-Chinese Situation in Mexico</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng Society reported that yesterday a Chinese man who came to Shanghai from Mexico spoke about the anti-Chinese situation in Mexico. The anti-Chinese movement started in Mexico's Ge Shan Mei province. Initially, due to the establishment of the "Eight Scholars" and "Bo Bo" regulations, the restrictions on Chinese were very strict. It was stipulated that for every Chinese person employed, four Mexican workers must be employed at the same time. Later, it was increased to nine people. The company's shareholders and principals were also included in the workers. Moreover, Chinese people who entered Mexican nationality did not enjoy the rights that Mexicans should enjoy. Marriage contracts between Chinese men and Mexican women were all invalidated, and those who were married were required to divorce, otherwise they would be subject to considerable detention. From July 1st, business tax was increased from 10% to 40%, and a head tax was also implemented. Although the Chinese Minister to Mexico, Gongshi Xiong, and Secretaries Zhang Tianyuan and Consul Peng Yao, negotiated with the Mexican government for more than half a month, it was ultimately ineffective. Almost all overseas Chinese went bankrupt. Currently, among the tens of thousands of Chinese in Mexico, only one-third are able to afford to return to their home country. The rest are in dire straits, and their suffering is beyond description.</p>
<h3>Special Stamp for Dr. Tan's National Funeral on September 4th</h3>

<h3>Settlement of the Xin Yili Ship Collision with American Warship Case</h3>
<p>The Yili Company is Responsible for Repairs</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9 AM, Xu Tingzuo, owner of the local Yili Shipping Company's Xin Yili ship, and US Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Markwell (transliteration), and US Naval Sitting Commander in China, Colbert (transliteration), met on the American Ambassador's Ship Aspire, which was moored in the Huangpu River off the Bund of Edward Road, to discuss repair plans. Representatives from Xing·Xie Dachang·Hongxiang Xing·Xiangsheng and other factories assessed the repair costs. The result was that Xiangsheng Factory will carry out the repairs, with an estimated repair cost of 1,200 taels of silver. Work will begin today and is limited to four days. The Xin Yili ship's rudder steering gear was also repaired yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou today.</p>
<h3>Problems with the Postal Administration Organization Law</h3>
<p>Talks by Standing Committee of the Postal Workers' Union</p>
<p>The re-discussion and amendment of the new Postal Administration Organization Law and the suspension of new non-postal personnel are of great importance. Yesterday afternoon, according to Zhang Kechang, Standing Committee member of the local Postal Workers' Union, the postal service's achievements in public affairs are indeed more outstanding. The main reason for this is the reliance on the examination system. Since the position of Director-General of Posts has been appointed by the Ministry of Communications, and does not belong to postal personnel, it is subject to change. However, the Associate Director-General, Deputy Director-General, heads of various departments, district postal directors, and various staff members are all promoted from personnel who have entered the bureau through examinations. Although there are occasional changes in the Director-General, other positions can remain unchanged, and the operation of affairs is not affected. It is not like other agencies, which are affected by the change of the head. Therefore, all postal personnel, from top to bottom, can be in their positions and do their duty. The reason why the postal service has been able to maintain its old reputation over the years is probably because of this. Therefore, this good system is indeed the treasure of the postal service. Not only should our postal colleagues cherish it, but it should also be promoted to other agencies. Moreover, the examination system is the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The National Government is striving to realize it, which shows its preciousness. The newly announced Postal Administration Organization Law has not changed the inherent spirit of the examination. This can be seen in the legislator's solitary and painstaking efforts, and their shared ideals. However, it is not clearly stipulated that the Deputy Director-General and the Chief Secretary should be filled by experienced and skilled personnel within the bureau, and where the two important matters of performance evaluation and auditing should be handled in the future. I am afraid that literal interpretation will give opportunities to the cunning, and it will be a burden on the future of the postal service. The Association et al have thought deeply and far-sightedly, so they have prepared documents one after another and presented them to the Legislative and Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications for reconsideration, adding explicit provisions. Several weeks ago (at that time, although the law had been promulgated, it had not yet been implemented), several representatives were sent to Director Qian to express their views. Director Qian expressed acceptance and promised to make appropriate remedies in the operating rules and to request the superior ministry to handle the matter based on the situation. However, Director Qian's words were still in his ears, and the reorganization of the Postal Administration took place, canceling the performance evaluation, auditing, and secretarial offices, and dividing the affairs originally managed by those offices, chaotic and disorganized. The opinions suggested by the Association et al were not adopted at all. What is even more embarrassing is the fact that Quan Ren used Xu Shifang as Chief Secretary and several scribes, opening the way for abuse of personnel. Yesterday, Director Qian replied to the Association and said that it was difficult to use the word "emotional" to say that it was already appointed. It is regrettable that the Director of the Bureau does not abide by the law and speaks of affection. Recalling that the Postal Administration illegally employed dozens of document clerks the year before last, and Mr. Wei Yifu dismissed them all after the Association et al opposed it, Director Qian should know what to do. In short, the current movement of the Association et al is for the entire postal system and not to attack any individual. Conscientious people will be able to teach them et cetera.</p>

<h3>Quarantine Office Report on Preventing Cholera</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Wu Liande, Director of the National Seaport Quarantine Office, issued the fifth report on preventing cholera: (1) Recently, there have been a small number of mild cholera cases that continue to spread in various districts of Shanghai. A total of 9 patients were reported in the week from August 15th to 22nd, including 3 residents in the Chinese area, 4 in Pudong, and 2 in the Public Concession, of which 2 have died. (2) There are quite a few cases of acute dysentery in Shanghai and Nanjing, but they are all mild and easy to treat. (2) The National Government's Disaster Relief Committee has established a Health and Epidemic Prevention Group, with Liu Ruiheng, Director of the National Health Administration, as the director. The committee has 10 members, 5 Chinese and 4 Westerners, all well-known figures in the medical field. In addition, a sanitary engineer (British) has been hired, dispatched by the Rockefeller Foundation. However, Wu Liande sincerely hopes that all public and private charities will do their best to assist in disaster relief and epidemic prevention work, so as to save money and avoid the drawbacks of repeated donations. The disaster relief work should focus on: 1. Hygiene, including the supply of drinking water and the collection of pollutants; 2. Epidemic prevention (including injecting various preventive vaccines to control dysentery, cholera, and typhoid); 3. Medical services (including the establishment of hospitals, pharmacies, water rescue teams, and clinics in various public facilities). (4) This office has also established branch offices in Hankou, Nanjing, and Wusong to inspect the diseases of disaster victims and inject various preventive vaccines, which will be implemented in various ports from September 1st. (5) The Shanghai health authorities hold a meeting once a week, convened by the directors of the Public Works Bureau. The Shanghai Municipal Government, this office, and the Public Works Bureaus of the Public Concession and the French Concession will discuss methods of health and disaster relief assistance to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases in Shanghai and jointly save 50,000 to 100,000 refugees from the disaster area coming to Shanghai. (6)</p>
<p>Injections to prevent cholera are still being administered as usual. From May 1st to August 29th, 461,341 people in Shanghai have been vaccinated. Fortunately, the local cholera outbreak in Zhoupu has now been brought under control. No new symptoms have been found in the past ten days.</p>

<h3>Ban on Piling Goods by Chicken and Duck Shops</h3>
<p>Chicken and duck shops in the Nanshi 16th Pier area often pile chicken and duck cages on the roadside. The accumulated chicken and duck urine and feces in the cages emit a foul odor, causing endless suffering to nearby residents. Chen, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, believes that piling goods on the roadside not only damages the road and obstructs traffic, but also greatly harms the health of citizens. He has repeatedly issued notices to ban this and ordered the relevant district police station to strictly investigate and deal with it. However, some people obey the ban, while others violate it, which is a deliberate violation of the ban. Therefore, he has issued another notice to the district, stating that if any chicken and duck shops that violate the police regulations are found again in the future, they will be strictly investigated and detained, and punished according to regulations to serve as a warning to others. After receiving the order, the district immediately dispatched police officers to the 16th Pier the day before yesterday and arrested the owners of Guangyuan and Zhengda, two shops that had repeatedly violated the ban. In addition to being punished and released according to regulations, the two shops were also ordered to suspend business immediately.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read in yesterday's edition of your newspaper's local news column that the Dafeng Silk Store on Hankou Road was involved in a plagiarism case with another company's trademark. Outsiders mistakenly identified the silk store as our bureau, causing inquiries by letter and telegram. Although our bureau and the silk store have the same brand name, there is actually a distinction between the silk store and the silk bureau. This matter concerns our reputation, so we are sending this letter to you and request that you publish it in your next issue. This is to clarify the matter. With best regards, Shanghai Dafeng Silk Bureau, August 28th</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's Diary of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Since July 18th, the German army has encountered continuous attacks, with countless casualties and huge losses of military supplies, forcing the enemy army to shorten the defense line on this side and voluntarily abandon the gains obtained in Metz-Brooke in April. From August 8th to September 4th, the German Supreme Command withdrew the troops from the southern angle of Bulnan and deployed defenses on the Wekit Yamentio Lapei Line. Important positions such as Mount 克末尔 and the Bessenay coal mine, which had been occupied for four months, had to be abandoned.</p>
<p>In six weeks, the enemy army has completely lost the gains it obtained in the spring. The loss of troops and military supplies is certainly huge, and most importantly, the enemy army's morale is scattered and unable to restore its offensive advantage. Our army only needs to move forward bravely according to the planned plan, and use the American troops to clear the Paris-Avly Valley railway line, just as the British and French armies previously cleared the Paris-Amiens and Paris-Chalon railway lines. The Allied forces have reached the point of mobilizing the last participating troops—the American troops—according to the plan of July 24, and expanding the war further east.</p>
<p>The enemy army's retreat proves its weakness and lack of replenishment. I then asked Marshal Haig and General Giraud to pay attention to the situation in the north, which is very favorable for taking the offensive. On September 2nd, I wrote to them, "The Belgian army and the British Second Army can occupy the 克勒肯 highlands, the 霍什尔 forest, the 拜兴台尔 mountains, and the Comines with small sacrifices. Our army's battle line unexpectedly extends north of the Lys River. In addition to the direct benefits, the achievement of the goals just mentioned will also be a good starting point for future attacks on Lule and Gutler.</p>
<p>I asked the British Commander-in-Chief and the Belgian Chief of Staff to immediately study these plans. I myself am also further preparing for the Allied forces' general offensive—this general offensive is now quite certain due to the victory in the local battle on July 18th. The last step is to arrange for the American First Army to fight in the Saint-Mihiel salient.</p>
<p>The plan of July 24th had a section on the American troops attacking in the 弗尔弗尔 area.</p>
<p>Because it was decided on July 22nd that in addition to the American First Army in 马尔纳, another American Second Army would be formed in the area north of 诺门尼 to the Saint-Mihiel salient.</p>
<p>At the end of July, the formation of the American troops clearly showed the America</p>
