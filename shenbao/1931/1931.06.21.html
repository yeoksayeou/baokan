<p>時評</p>
<h3>日人之統一满蒙與满鮮策</h3>
<p>日人鼓吹满蒙政策。已非一日。近自我國宣布廢除不平等條約後。日人恐其旣得權有所動搖於是在满之僑民。在其國内之軍人元老。相與結合運動。以達其確立满蒙政策之目的乃任外交前輩内田氏爲满鐵總裁。與各派間聯絡。先以統一内部意見。以進行其統一满蒙政策。又以外交後盾之武力。尙未充分堅固。满鐵與朝鮮間之治理。尙未十分聯絡。乃任前陸相宇垣氏爲朝鮮總督。與内田總裁提挈進行。先以統一满鮮政策。以進達於統一满蒙。總之日人欲藉此兩大人物。團結國内各方面意志。以增厚其經營满蒙之力量。此則無論何人皆能窺見之者。日訊謂宇垣在淸浦内閣時。即主確立满蒙政策與統一满鮮政策者。新任南陸相亦希望統一满蒙政策者。宇垣又語記者云。增兵朝鮮。並非以武务治之之意。係從满洲方面國防上之見地而出發者。觀此可知此次之主張满蒙新政策者。武人實佔大培勢力。而其以武力爲進行統一之一手段。亦未可視爲必無之事。日人對於满蒙問題之情勢如此。不知吾國之研究東北問題者。將作如何感想也。</p>

<h3>兩女淫奔記</h3>
<p>朱森一箭雙雕</p>
<p>徐招弟難辭禍首</p>
<p>唐秀林不知廉恥</p>
<p>武定路九百三十二號勝利糖菓餅乾店主甬人唐寳山之女秀林、年已二九、待字閨中、素與比隣女子徐招弟結爲閨友、招弟年華雙十、妖冶性成、早與該處九百三十號門牌和興洋貨店夥皖人朱森有染、朱年方念二、中饋尙虚、彼此</p>
<p>夙有嫁娶之約奈招弟父母</p>
<p>猶屬昧昧、近竟將女另字他人、雙方咸大失望、招弟欲慰情人、乃介紹秀林與朱會晤、一見傾心、兩皆满意、招弟遂以執柯自任、向唐寳山屢進說詞、唐朱毘隣而居、朱與招弟暧昧行爲、久已耳熟能詳、焉肯以女妻之、故嚴詞謝絶、朱聞信固極懊喪、而秀林尤爲悒悒、招弟更以旣不能成人之美、且慮已身所偶非人、</p>
<p>三方各有苦衷於是聚謀長相共處之策、舍私奔外、殊無他途、隨即各自進行、朱森向附近四百三十一號賃就亭子樓一間、置備傢具、並向店主告假一月、託詞回籍省親、秀林則於本月十七日夜半、乘父母熟睡、竊取四明銀行七百元之存摺一扣、携带包袱、</p>
<p>潛由露臺下樓啓後户遁出、行至弄口、朱與招弟已預雇汽車一輛相候、三人連袂登車、駛往朱處、是夜朱之一箭雙鵰願望、完全相償、翌晨、秀林馳赴四明銀行、將存欵悉數提取、迨唐發覺其女捲逃、亟投四明阻止付欵、已措手不及矣、祇得報告虹口捕房、派探目劉永祥偵知朱等避匿所在、爰於前日午後四時往拿、至則室門猶閉、蓋</p>
<p>朱與兩女晝寢未興、探員叩之良久、始將若輩好夢驚回、披衣拔關、遂被拘獲、秀林身藏鈔幣六百元、朱亦藏一百十二元、皆由探搜出、連同包袱、带入捕房、分别收押、昨晨、傳同女之父母解該男女往特區地方法院、由馮世德推事提審、唐寳山以其女之捲欵私奔、純係徐招弟因作伐無成、</p>
<p>甘言唆使所致請求嚴辦、并稱該存欵係妻之私蓄而留存與子者、故存摺係用我子信甫之名、我女雖亦有存欵、但僅三十金云、唐妻王氏、亦到案陳述招弟爲朱森作伐情形一過、質之秀林供、該欵係父親所給、故臨行將存摺取去、至與朱森戀愛、實屬自願、且因此事屢受母責、以故私奔、惟現</p>
<p>尙未與朱同床前晚係與招弟共榻、此層如不見信、儘可檢騐云云、招弟亦供因遭母親呵責、故與秀林商妥、同朱賃屋、并否認作伐等情、朱森則供事由兩女自願、并未勾誘、馮推事訊畢、諭被告等仍分别收押、定期宣判、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>德國孟歇Mannheim地方的當局。鑒於遊手好閒之徒允斥市上。便想出一個滑稽的取締之法。他們派警察裝了一大車的椅子。到各街道中去遊行。每見遊蕩的人。閒立在街頭巷口。就從車上取一把椅子下來。請他坐地。一時引得旁觀者大笑。而那遊蕩的人也就知愧而退了</p>
<p>英國有一家規模宏大的鐵路公司僱有檢查的專員。對於公司中所用的東西。都須加以詳細的檢騐。他們的工作往往有滑稽可笑的。譬如數一柄掃帚中有多少帚毛。將羊毛地毯中夾雜着的棉條檢出來。這等工作何等煩細。然而這正是他們的分内事。</p>
<p>美國結婚以後没有子女的夫婦。在都市中比在鄉村中約多四倍。據說這也是都市衛生。不如鄉村的一個例子。</p>

<h3>廣州之游</h3>
<p>— 吉</p>
<p>到了廣州有二十多天。繁華的商業。雖亞於上海香港。可是並非得到外人一絲一毫的助力。完全出於國人自營。眞是大可替廣州自豪了。</p>
<p>「食在廣州。」所以廣州的酒樓茶店。特别來得多。可是廣州人請吃飯呌做「飲茶。」茶店兼賣飯食。吃有兩種。「小吃。」只在茶樓裏飲茶吃飯。至多化四毫錢。已是很夠了。「大吃。」那便是原桌的菜席。那至少非二三十元不辦。</p>
<p>一切的進出。完全毫洋。而且只有廣東雙角子。正面是中山先生的小像。反面是雙穗嘉禾。一塊錢便是五個角子。如果用港洋和大洋。那就得照市價伸縮。在現在的市面。一塊港洋抵十三毫左右。一塊大洋抵十一毫左右。要是到香港。那末市面上只用港洋和港毫。只有大洋的人。便須先在兌換店兌換了港洋方可使用。所以香港的兌換店。也就特别多了。</p>
<p>廣州最時行」宵夜。「這」宵夜「並不是上海人冬天在廣東店呌來的一隻炭盆幾碟生魚的宵夜。却是隨便小吃的稱謂。更有的在晚上十一二點鐘吃二三十元的酒席。也呌宵夜。」食在廣州。「亦可見廣州人對於」吃「的利害了。</p>
<p>廣州人不但重吃。並且重娱樂。在六點鐘晚飯之後。十一點鐘宵夜未上市之前。便要緊看大戲（粤戲）和映畫（影戲）。在廣州的大戲館。現在頂有名的便是長堤的」海珠戲院「。有名的戲班。如果到廣州。便以一到」海珠「爲榮。粤班之覺先聲。（薛覺先」即在滬之章非「所組織配角有花旦騷韻蘭。生角陳錦棠林坤山等。特等海珠位售價三元）日月星。人壽年。京班之梅蘭芳。歌舞班之梅花歌舞團。皆曾在此出演。其次便是」太平戲院。「（張慧冲魔術曾在此出演）和」河南戲院。「映畫院更多至不可勝數。近來更爭先恐後的裝置有聲機械。其已將有聲的。有」中華「。」新國民「。」模範「。」明珠「。」永漢「。」南關「等六院。所映聲片。以」中華「」永漢「」明珠「爲佳。無聲畫院多至八家。映片多是國產。所以有聲畫院的營業。也就更見眞產了。</p>
<p>廣州的報紙。多至二十餘家。消息的來源。除了專電探訪。也常登申港各報的材料。銷路較大的有」國華「。」民國「。」公評「等三家。」國華「編製頗新。」公評「頭腦很舊。銷數皆在一萬左右。附刋編製。好的資料很少。有的附刋登了一篇從香港</p>
<p>報上轉錄來的文字。誰知香港報上這篇文字都是在本談上轉錄得來的。諸如此類的笑話。很多很多。市面最繁盛的要算在」長堤「。其次」永漢路「。」　新路「。」西堤「等等。都還不差。大旅店像」東亞「。」中山「。」新亞「。」亞洲「等。都在長西兩堤。而晚上的夜景。也要算這兩堤爲最好看了。</p>
<p>對於研究戲劇的學校。祇有」廣東戲劇所一家。是由省政府主辦的。委的所長是歐陽予倩先生。裏面的敎員如唐槐秋嚴工上胡春冰諸位先生。多是對戲劇很有研究的。六月一日。他們的第一劇團成立。在省敎育會大公演十天。所演的節目有」茶花女「。」賣買「。」有家室的人「。」熊「等。我曾經和同事施叔明前去看過幾次。其中表演的學生。最好的有高偉蘭彭國華兩女士。章正凡李晨風趙如琳陳有各諸君。其次的便是區愛女士。而盧敦君因爲表演時提脫不了」武「氣。所以終於不及章李諸位。否則却也是表演之材呢。</p>
<h3>王師子畫展記</h3>
<p>— 朱爵</p>
<p>句容王師子以最新作品。在寗波同鄉會公開展覧。可百五十幀。花烏蟲魚。無美不備。大致師子之畫。其最爲人所不及者。厥有三點。如用筆之濕而能斂。設色之麗而絶俗。水墨之淡而有神。足徵精力彌满。慘淡經營。會中所列。如薔薇鷄雛。豆蟲。雙鯉。楊柳翠烏。落霞孤鶩。諸幀之氣韻淸遠。雕攔白鴿　柳秋千之造境新奇。墨筆鳥樹之蒼茫高潔。卓立千古。此外集鐘鼎漢　諸聯。筆力遵横。古趣盎然。題畫小時。出入風雅。俱爲時之選。古人稱八斗才多。吾亦歎師子藝之多也。</p>
<h3>日本電影事業談略</h3>
<p>— 李弢安</p>
<p>日本電影事業的中心是在東京。尤其是淺草區的淺草公園附近一带。差不多都是些電影戲院。在那裏所放映的影片。除了它們本國不算。只是那些西洋的有聲片和無聲片。還有它的勢力存在着。談到我們中國的影片。簡直不大看見。這並非因爲中國影片的不好。或是怎樣的緣故。實在。它們愛國心重。不忍利權外溢。來演别國影片。以自摧殘其原有的大好事業。至於西片。還能夠在維持它們的生命。却是和它本國僑民。與國際上地位的關係。成一種相對比例的。</p>
<p>不過。它們自已出品的影片。無形中却暗示兩重不同派别的差異。一種是專供資本階級來作宣傳的。而另一種却是擁護勞働階級的先鋒。只要從那影片裏面。便就可以看出兩派色彩各個的濃厚。所以說它們的影片。確含有主義上絶大的作用。</p>
<p>日本雖是君主立憲的國家。然而那種平民化的勢力。倒也普遍得很。它們影戲院裏的座價。大概只不過售日金五十錢。（約合國幣一元有奇。）樓上樓下。完全一律。任意入座。無分軒輊。這雖是它們特點之一。然而究因建築上的關係。所以祇要出了這麽相當代價。不管樓上和樓下。所得到的總是同樣的愉快。</p>
<p>有人說。日本電影事業的發達。也是必然的情勢。一則因爲它們國民的愛國心。和愛護它們自已新興實業的心太重。結果自應如此。二因全國影院開設的增多。在它本國裏。便有過剩的銷路。一些不受營業上的影響。還有。政府與輿論方面。都在予以相當的帮助。和同情的鼓勵。使能得以安然地扶搖直上。向前力圖進展。也是一個重大原因。</p>

<h3>救荒食料之研究（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>其第四方云。紅薯洗淨蒸熟。候半乾。搗爛。加糯米粥和如泥。湖竹籬上愈久愈堅。不蛀不壞。如遇荒年。取手大一塊。煮爲淸粥一大鍋。食之能耐饑。或做磚塊形。砌成墻壁。留用尤妙。予按紅薯。殆即紅心番薯。但學名爲　非薯。而稱爲薯者。則爲薯芋。即芋艿頭耳。史記卓文君云。岷山之下。野有蹲鴟。至死不飢。蓋蹲鴟即是芋頭。肖其狀之言也。惟芋所含滋養料。實比　多。試列於左</p>
<p>品名　蛋白質　脂肪　　澱粉　　水分　　備考</p>
<p>八·一　七·四　三·六七八　三九七·六八　鮮者四斤可抵食米一斤乾粉一斤可抵食米二斤</p>
<p>芋　一六五·○七二　一○七·八二四五六·　鮮者一斤四兩可抵食米一斤乾粉一斤可抵食米四斤半</p>
<p>如上比較。足知芋粉效用。實比　粉爲强。其第四方所用紅薯。即指薯芋而言。芋種本有紅白兩種。白者皮薄而色白。用爲蔬菜。紅種則成厚多毛。色带淺紫。即毛艿耳。此二物者。杭地均有設攤專售。以供勞重輹之充飢。前者稱爲烘番薯。後者稱爲芋艿頭。其價固甚廉也。綜觀上述。足知騐方新編所載之救飢法。實非妄誕。大可實用。值引辦賑時期。有心者盍於此加之意焉。惟於飢者貪食。頗易致噎。是在當局者善爲勸告。加以限制。庶不致有流弊。騐言新編中。亦已詳言之矣。</p>

<p>張小三兒離開了北京以後。東西南北。四處奔走。打了不少次的仗。每打一次仗。張小三兒總高升一步。升到了連長。忽然經過一次變亂。就跳升了團長。作了團長以後。經過一次變亂。又跳升了師長。作到了師長。這就自由多了。這時他們的巡閱使駐節在北京。張小三有事到北京來請示。居然作了官回來了。回來之後。和朋友借一所房子住。一借就借到農商部街的一重大房子。當他坐了汽車來看新居的時候。巧極了。就是當年唱酸梅湯地方的那個大紅門。多年瞧着住在這裏頭的人。那一股子有錢的勁兒。眞是討厭。而今看起來。也不能算討厭。有了錢不住好屋子。倒要住破屋子不成。當天張小三看了屋子。認爲满意。就搬了進來住。接着他在外省討的兩位姨太太。也就跟着來了。這附近的警察區子。爲了保護國家干城起見。在張師長公館門口。臨時加了一個警崗。張小三兒無論一早出去。或者深夜回來。甚至大風大雨的時候。總盾到一個警士站在門外。而且還恭恭敬敬行個禮。心想」人家掙了我一個大嗎。心裏實在有些過不去。因之很想賞他幾個錢。不過没有說出來罷了。這個日子。張小三兒已經不恨警察。覺得無論到什麽地方。都靠了警察帮忙不少。只是他媳婦諒他不會作官。這個時候。非找着伊。讓伊瞧瞧不可。爲了這個。自已坐着汽車到原來的大雜院。去看了一趟。那些住家的。見一個武官。带了四個持盒子的衛兵。走了進來。大家縮在屋子裏。死也不敢出來。張小三兒站在院子裏。詳詳細細的說明了來歷。這才有個老尙鞋匠先在窗子眼裏張望了個淸楚。然後走出來。隔着張小三兒一丈多路。就站住了笑着和他蹲蹲了一蹲。笑道。」想不到哇。張大人街坊都搬去了。只剩我一家是老人了。張司令。你還惦記着老街坊呀。眞不錯。我的張老爺。「張小三兒道。」你知道從前跟我的媳婦那裏去了嗎。我……我想瞧瞧他。「鞋匠道。」張司令。你打算着怎麽樣呢。「張小三兒道。」我哇。哼。「鞋子匠道。」這兩年我們都没有見過他呀。你想。他還能上這兒來嗎。大人。喝碗水吧。「張小三客氣了兩句。送了那老鞋匠二十塊錢。也就走了。</p>

<h3>看了梅蘿香之後的幾句話</h3>
<p>— 珂</p>
<p>中公劇社醖酿了好久好久的」梅蘿香「、居然在上星期三的下午與我們相見了、這眞是一回欣幸的事、尤其是歐陽信君的堅毅精神使我們敬重、他的父親才死了幾天、他能抑制信他的悲傷、不使這初萌芽的藝術之葩爲他頽萎、</p>
<p>幕開了、一幕幕地在眼前過去、劇情大概是這樣的、</p>
<p>梅蘿香是一個美貌年靑意志薄弱的女戲子、她一向依着一個有錢的商人白森卿過着奢侈的生活、後來與新聞記者馬子英愛戀、但是、馬子英很窮、一時不能達到他們的盼望的目的、這使他離開了她去發展他企圖的事業、</p>
<p>她與馬子英訂婚之後、即束身自好、一方面拒絶了白森卿的物質上的帮助、一方面很刻苦地自已做生活、這樣迫得她一天天地和困苦接近、終於把所有的衣物當完還不能過活下去、她的女友小春蘭利用這機會來勸誘她、勸她仍回到白森卿跟前、她竟被甘言引動了、於是白森卿强迫她寫信與子英絶交、可是她并没有這樣做、她把信燒掉、</p>
<p>不久、馬子英發財回來取她、白森卿把她和他以前的經過宣佈、并說她是同時欺騙了兩個男子、於是馬子英與白森卿都把她抛棄、使他終久墮落、</p>
<p>全劇表演最好的、要推王華蓮女士扮的桂媽了、她能忘掉了自已而與劇中人融化、當她不捨得和她的女主人梅蘿香離開的時候、她訴說她的苦處、她哭了、哭得一把鼻涕一把眼淚、肩背上的筋肉不信地抽動、更其有趣的是她那一口的合肥土話、</p>
<p>其次要推歐陽信君的白森卿了、他把一個豪爽的商人活躍地搬到劇台上來、他的對話、淸晰而且洪亮、姿態也没有矯揉造作不自然的樣子、雖然面部表情没有十分的注意到、但他、總可說是一個成功者、</p>
<p>張良意君的馬子英、他的對話、很像一個小學生背書那樣的呆板、最使人不满意的更是那副塗抺過舊戲台上的小生化的面孔、和兩隻手老是挿在衣袋裏、面部的表情始終是没掉換過一個樣子、這些、使觀者只覺得他就是他與戲劇毫不發生關係、</p>
<p>主角梅蘿香是張兆和女士扮演、她的缺點也是從開幕時到閉幕時止、兩隻手常常地交叉着、當馬子英成功回來、這時的劇情是應該怎樣地緊張、而我們這位蜜司張呢、她老是淡淡地不露絲毫驚喜的態度、</p>
<p>此外如樊振那的秦呌天、他本不是重要的角色、演來也還可以馬虎過去、小春蘭比較重要些、扮她的是莊重的朱琴女士、所以與浪漫的小春蘭的態度不能相稱、勸誘梅蘿香的一段對話、旣没有動作表現、嗓音也低到不可辨别、</p>
<p>本來藝術這東西不是一件容易成功的事情、對於劇本的選定須顧到人選方面、假如找不到演浪漫女子的人材、我們可以另選劇本、决不能含糊遷就、弄到全劇失敗、</p>
<p>話又說回頭、當現在中國的藝術低落的時代—尤其是戲劇—當然是不能夠有第一次的經騐就得到满意的結果、我們所需要的、是希望有愛好藝術者的熱列提倡、使一般人了解戲劇是民衆的敎育、而集中他們的精力來灌溉這藝術的根芽、使她放出燦爛的花朶、所以說、這次的公演、在藝術的成績上雖然是失敗、在整個的戲劇運動上是很有堅毅的精神、像導演顧仲彝先生、一兩個月以來、風雨無阻的從眞茹跑到砲台灣、各演員在迫近大考的時候、犧牲他們寳貴的時間來排演、這一點、就十分的使我們爲他們的藝術精神所感動、</p>
<h3>歡送</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>逞威的炎夏、不日宣告光臨了、於是」畢業「兩字的印象、更深刻地投入那一部份所謂」鍍銀學成「者的心坎、當步出那舉行壯嚴的畢業典禮的禮堂時、心頭不免突突跳動、一似受着一種苦悶的襲撃、在禮堂裏、是融樂而活潑的、津津然敬聆着師長的訓詞、但禮成之後、走出大門、便好像倐我失去了什麽東西、不自禁地垂頭喪氣、兩眶熱淚要泉湧一樣、彷彿受了刑法的判决、</p>
<p>這種普遍的情態、是爲了什麽呢、是的、簡單的說、四年大學光陰的代價所得的、」出路「問題、當未畢業的時候、總是覺得社會是怎樣地廣大、難道不能容納了一個人嗎、不差、未來的期待是樂觀極了、甚至對於一般找汪以飯碗的」前輩、「表示至」飯桶、這樣没本事的無出息、「一類刻簿話、但自已也輪到參加畢業典禮的時候了、這不同情的話、將蓋到自已的頭上、還有什麽話說呢、不怨天、不尤人、然而」出路「到底成了問題、那穿着方頂帽了肖影是何等英概、可是這又有何用、還不是看到要失望嗎、假使不幸、一月二月……東托人没辦法、西托人也無回音、不用說焦急萬狀、請敎」鍍銀「的結果、是這麽個下場、其懊惱將何以喻、在這樣一個多方憐慮之下、所謂畢業云者、也許不會成爲一件喜事而興奮罷、</p>
<p>我曾問了好幾位待要畢業的同學、關於畢業後的行止如何、不是說未定、就是說没法、而且言下都不勝黯然、像這種掃興的不景氣、眞是多麽没趣、然而也祗有没趣下去、實在我夋知道這」出路「問題的嚴重、在今日已成爲普遍化、處於現實的社會環境、是值得從長討論的、我們也不必談什麽理論、事實有很明顯的擺在面前、那方帽子的」鍍銀「學士、一大批一大批的從神聖的學府湧了出來、話說是」爲社會謀福利「去了、其實社會所需求於他們者在那裏、我簡直也没有相當的語句夠來形容、</p>
<p>但話又說回來、實際着想、現代敎育的日趨資本化、求學的重担已被壓榨得筋疲力盡、满冀畢業後收到一些利潤、那裏知道今連本錢都爭不回、然則這究竟是大學生本身的無用、還是大學本質的無用、這些說來、話長而且不免有偏坦之嫌、我們大家就自已肚裏明白吧了、不過、如果我們要阻咒、那姑先自薄三分、以表本身無罪之意、然後儘管發洩些憤忿之情吧、因爲自已有求知慾的衝動、便是第一個不是呵、</p>
<p>我何不妨捫心沉思、所謂四年的大學敎育、從懷着鬼胎跑入大學之府、及至戴起方帽子、在這期間、究竟給與了些什麽、換句話說、共獲得的是些什麽、以我的推測、也許很少有人能置答吧、記得某雜誌徵文」大學敎育所給予你的是些什麽「的結果、都是說毫未獲得、一切和没有進大學同樣空虚、這種眞實的供詞、我們是該拍手呌絶了、曾經有人譏剌地說、」要問大低生四年的成績如何、可以他們用錢的數量來作旁證的及比例、「就是、第一年二百、第二年四百、第三年八百、第四年一千六百、那末我也就請問吧、……我想這大概是侮辱的、</p>
<p>我好像時常有種矛盾的相反的疑問、一方面覺得」鍍銀「的大學敎育是這不夠、彷彿必須」鍍金「一番、一方面又覺得單這樣成批的」鍍銀「的生產、在社會的用途上已可生畏了、還那裏談得到」鍍金、「這樣的衝突、眞是無法排解、正因爲目前的中國敎育制度的特徵是太耐人玩味、太要使人唖然失笑、</p>
<p>不過、這種疑問當然還僅是一個未畢業者慌恐的心理而已、在我看到夏日日漸迫近、於是、不覺也有動乎中、好多友人將結束他們的大學生少厚去找出路了、他們方帽子的肖像都照得很是齊整、然而這却都祗是浮面的愉悅、他們内心的苦惱是與日俱增、一種陰影緊緊罩了他們的心田、似乎對於這生活的結束有不勝其戀棧之概、同時這」鍍銀「生活對於我也將祗有短暫的一年了、旅程已是走到最後一個階段、尤給予我一個不勝其同情的意念、可惜我是一個不能繪畫的人、不然我定要塗幾幀寓意畫來、舒發我奮激的情感、所以我祗有借上面的一些話來提供而表達於萬一了、但對於這問題該决不是上面的一些話所能盡意的、爲了篇幅、當留待别個機會補充、我的本旨還在歡送、一般在暑期中畢業的」鍍銀「學士、</p>
<p>末了、我想再添上這二個字作歡送的話别紀念、「珍重、」</p>

<p>The Opium Suppression Inspection Office</p>
<h3>Is Established by the Opium Suppression Commission</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Because party departments and public organizations in various places mistakenly believe that the Opium Suppression Inspection Office is the Opium Suppression Bureau established by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Finance issued a draft today stating that the Opium Suppression Commission, in accordance with the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session to completely prohibit opium in six years and the regulations for the implementation of the Opium Suppression Law, has established Opium Suppression Inspection Offices in important provinces for land and water transportation. Their task is to inspect and ban the consumption and transportation of opium and other substitute drugs. The heads of each office are appointed by the Opium Suppression Commission. The position of Director-General has also been appointed by the Opium Suppression Commission to Li Muqing. The inspection office is not an agency of the Ministry of Finance, nor is it jointly operated with the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, according to a staff member of the Ministry of Finance, the inspection office, as the name implies, is responsible for investigating and should not be involved in transporting opium. If the inspection office is established by the Opium Suppression Commission, the Ministry of Finance will not inquire about its income and expenditure. (20th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan's Manchurian-Mongolian Unification and Manchurian-Korean Strategy</h3>
<p>The Japanese have been advocating a Manchurian-Mongolian policy for more than a day. Recently, after our country announced the abolition of unequal treaties, the Japanese feared that their vested rights would be shaken. Therefore, the overseas Chinese in Manchuria, their domestic military personnel, and elder statesmen joined forces to move to achieve the goal of establishing their Manchurian-Mongolian policy. They appointed former foreign minister Uchida as the president of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) to contact various factions and first unify internal opinions in order to carry out their Manchurian-Mongolian unification policy. Moreover, the military force behind their diplomatic support was not yet fully strengthened, and the governance between the SMR and Korea was not yet fully connected. Therefore, they appointed former Minister of the Army Ugaki as the Governor-General of Korea to work with President Uchida. First, they unified the Manchurian-Korean policy in order to advance to the unification of Manchuria and Mongolia. In short, the Japanese want to use these two major figures to unite the will of all parties in the country in order to increase their strength in managing Manchuria and Mongolia. This is something that anyone can see. Japanese news reports said that Ugaki advocated the establishment of a Manchurian-Mongolian policy and the unification of Manchuria and Korea when he was in the Kiyoura Cabinet. The newly appointed Minister of the Army also hopes to unify the Manchurian-Mongolian policy. Ugaki also told reporters that increasing troops in Korea is not intended for military rule, but is based on the national defense perspective of Manchuria. From this, it can be seen that the military is actually occupying a large force in advocating the new Manchurian-Mongolian policy this time, and it cannot be regarded as impossible to use military force as a means of unification. The Japanese attitude towards the situation in Manchuria and Mongolia is like this. I wonder what feelings those in our country who study the Northeast issue will have.</p>

<h3>Manchuria-Korea Unification Policy</h3>
<p>Japan Actually Views Manchuria and Mongolia as Meat on the Chopping Board</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry and Military Coordinate to Break Down Barriers</p>
<p>Teletype Tokyo, 20th - The new Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki, told reporters yesterday afternoon that reducing the salaries of colonial officials would place a triple burden on them. He believed that a gradual approach should be adopted and implemented after a three-year delay. The increase in troops in Korea was not intended to govern by force, but was based on national defense considerations in Manchuria. If the budget permitted, it could be implemented. In the past, various obstacles often arose between the South Manchuria Railway and the governance of Korea. Originally, Manchuria and Korea should implement a unified policy. He recently decided to meet with Count Uchida to frankly exchange opinions.</p>
<p>Teletype Tokyo, 20th - Japan's policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia has lacked coordination between the Foreign Ministry, the Military, the South Manchuria Railway, the Kwantung Government-General, and the Korean Government-General, resulting in contradictions and problems in the Manchuria-Mongolia and Manchuria-Korea policies. After this change, former Minister of the Army Ugaki took office as Governor-General of Korea. He advocated establishing a Manchuria-Mongolia policy and unifying the Korea policy during the Kiyoura Cabinet. The President of the South Manchuria Railway is now the veteran diplomat Uchida Kosai. Minister of the Army Minami also hopes to unify the Manchuria-Mongolia policy. Recently, Governor-General Ugaki, President Uchida of the South Manchuria Railway, Vice President Eguchi, Director-General of Political Affairs Imaida, Minister of the Army Minami, Foreign Minister Shidehara, and others will gather to discuss ways to make the relationship between the military, foreign ministry, and the South Manchuria Railway closer. Japan's Manchuria-Mongolia policy, which has lacked internal unity due to multi-headed governance, will be transformed by this meeting. The United States to Assist Europe</p>
<h3>Resolving the Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>Signs Are Gradually Emerging</p>
<p>Hoover Convenes Key Members of Congress</p>
<p>To Discuss Suspending War Debt Payments</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th - After US Treasury Secretary Mellon met with British Prime Minister MacDonald in London, President Hoover discussed the matter at length with Secretary of State Stimson last night. Today, he convened important senators for consultations. Senator Smoot, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has been recalled to Washington. It is widely believed that important developments are about to occur in the financial situation between the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th - Signs are gradually emerging that the United States is willing to assist in resolving Europe's economic difficulties. It is now believed that significant developments will occur soon. According to those close to the matter, President Hoover intends to declare to European countries that if they are willing to allow Germany to temporarily suspend reparations payments, then the United States will consider temporarily suspending the repayment of war debts. Currently, newspapers agree with President Hoover's attitude. However, the New York Times expressed the opinion that Congress may not approve the reduction or suspension of war debts for one or two years, as this debt repayment money is currently used to meet domestic needs. Without this money, it would be necessary to issue new loans to compensate. Moreover, with the presidential election approaching, both the Republican and Democratic parties are unwilling to take this path. However, the United States also cannot continue to take a bystander attitude.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the content of President Hoover's plan to assist Germany is eagerly awaited. It is now believed that most of the senators consulted by the President have expressed a sincere spirit of cooperation. Some figures have expressed the opinion that if European powers can reduce armaments, then those who previously opposed the abolition of war debts would be willing to consider revisions or abolition of war debts with sympathy. This reflects the current attitude of Congress.</p>
<p>The Haitian Congress Declares</p>
<h3>The U.S.-Haiti Treaty Invalid</h3>
<p>The U.S. Is Unwilling to Give Up Administrative Control</p>
<p>Associated Press, Port-au-Prince (Haiti), 19th - The Congress of the Republic of Haiti today unanimously resolved to declare that the treaty between Haiti and the United States expired in 1926 and requested President Vincent to immediately find a way to end the illegal occupation of Haiti by the United States Marine Corps. According to the treaty signed between the United States and Haiti in 1916, the United States assisted Haiti in establishing and maintaining a responsible and orderly government, and Haiti agreed not to raise public debt without the consent of the United States. This treaty was approved by the Haitian National Assembly. After repeated conflicts in 1929, U.S. President Hoover sent a delegation to Haiti to investigate, with the current U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Forbes, serving as chairman of the committee. The results of the investigation were that the United States should immediately cease exercising supervisory power once the Haitian political situation could cease U.S. supervision. In addition, the High Commissioner of the United States stationed in Haiti should be dismissed and replaced by a diplomatic representative. Americans employed by the Haitian government should be dismissed and replaced by Haitians once their own people have been trained. However, the United States continues to supervise customs administration, sanitation, construction, police, road construction, and education in Haiti based on the 1916 treaty. Recently, the United States has planned to withdraw the Marine Corps, but it must be implemented at a suitable time in the future. Now that the Haitian Congress has passed a resolution opposing the United States, local morale has been greatly stirred. It remains to be seen how the Haitian President will respond to the demands of Congress.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 19th - Today, officials at the U.S. State Department commented on the Haitian Congress's request to declare the 1916 U.S.-Haiti treaty invalid, stating that the treaty was signed and approved through proper procedures, and the United States will insist on its validity and will strongly advocate maintaining the Marine Corps stationed in Haiti and continuing to select and control Haitian customs officials.</p>
<p>Italian Media Attack</p>
<h3>French Naval Policy</h3>
<p>Guomin Daily, Rome, 19th - Today, the Italian Fascist Party's official newspaper strongly criticized French naval policy, especially attacking the speech made by French Navy Chief Darlan in Congress on Wednesday. It stated that Darlan's claim that France had no choice but to build 23,000-ton cruisers because Italy and Germany were building pocket battleships was inconsistent with past and present facts. The French intentionally exaggerate the danger of German pocket battleships in order to stimulate public opinion to support the expansion of armaments. In reality, France has several types of cruisers whose speed and firepower are far superior to pocket battleships.</p>
<p>Guomin Daily, Berlin, 19th - French Navy Minister Le Bigot declared in Congress yesterday that Germany is expected to build eight battlecruisers and eight light cruisers from this year to 1935. This plan violates the Treaty of Versailles. The German Ministry of Defense today specifically corrected this statement, saying that the German naval plan has long been known to France. Germany only intends to build four battleships to replace old ships, so there is no violation of the Treaty of Versailles. It is unknown what the French Navy Chief's report is based on.

If it obtains sufficient financial support, it will conduct Arctic exploration.</p>

<p>Sino-French Expedition Team</p>
<h3>The Withdrawal of Chinese Members:</h3>
<p>Hao Zhou Returns to Beiping to Report the Assault by French Team Members</p>
<p>Chinese Team Leader Chu Minyi Witnessed the Incident but Did Not Resist</p>
<p>On June 1st, the Sino-French expedition team was traveling to the Hayaer Matu area in northwestern Suiyuan when the leader of the vehicle convoy, a Frenchman named Mr. Bu An, began to insult Chinese team member Hao Jingsheng over a minor incident. He then severely beat him, rendering him unable to move. All the Chinese team members were extremely indignant. They decided to first send team members Zhou Baohan and Hao back to Beiping. The remaining Chinese team members, feeling helpless in the wilderness, decided to withdraw only after reaching Suzhou. Hao and Zhou traveled rapidly through the desert for thirteen days, walking over a thousand miles, and arrived in Baotou on the 14th. On the afternoon of the 15th, they safely arrived in Beiping by train. They were deeply traumatized and physically exhausted. Starting on the 16th, they visited responsible personnel from Chinese academic organizations to report the incident and discuss a response and the aftermath for the Chinese team members stranded in Gansu Province. All parties expressed outrage and offered assistance. The academic organizations were willing to help the four team members who would withdraw in Suzhou, enabling them to leave the French team and continue their westward expedition. They would then return to Beiping from Xinjiang via the Siberian Railway. Yesterday (the 17th) at 2:00 PM, Hao, Zhou, and others hosted a press conference to report the unreasonable actions of the French team members and the truth about their withdrawal. Over twenty people attended. First, the injured team member Hao Jingsheng recounted the facts of his injury, stating that since the Sino-French expedition team departed last month, the French team members had been driving and filming freely, which had drawn criticism from the public. Although they knew the French team members would be difficult to control, they reluctantly joined the expedition for academic research. After departing from Bailingmiao, the French team members resorted to all means to insult and mistreat the Chinese team members. On June 1st, when they arrived in Usunisu, he inadvertently entered the area while the French team members were filming, and was caught on film. This angered them, and they first insulted him and then beat him. Chinese team leader Mr. Chu Minyi was present and witnessed the incident, but he was afraid of the violence and did not dare to resist. Seeing that he was vulnerable and the Chinese were easy to bully, Bu An kicked him several more times before stopping. After he was insulted, the Chinese team members held a meeting to discuss a response. They believed that this was a group action and concerned the dignity of the nation. Therefore, he and Zhou Baohan secretly withdrew in the desert, while the other four team members agreed to withdraw altogether after reaching Suzhou to avoid the French team members' suspicion and potential harm on the way. Since the French team members had weapons and were extremely violent, unexpected events could occur at any time. Therefore, they had to reach a safe area before breaking away. Only Yao Xijiu and Jiao Jihua, sent by the Military and Political Departments, carried pistols. The rest were scholars who could not fight empty-handed. Moreover, the French side had ulterior motives in collaborating with the Chinese this time, so most of their team members were rough soldiers. Their claim of scientific research was deceptive. However, they were hindered by the strict supervision of the Chinese team members and could not use their tricks. They took the opportunity to vent their anger by behaving violently. They believed that the press represented public opinion and would provide considerable and strong support for this incident. Next, Zhou Baohan reported that when the team departed from Bailingmiao, the Chinese team leader and team members, fearing that the French team members would break the agreement halfway, discussed several preventive measures and made a written agreement with the French team leader Bu An: (1) The vehicle convoy must be under the command of the Chinese team leader; (2) Filming must be supervised by the Chinese side and must obtain the Chinese side's permission. Existing footage should be checked for corrections, and future footage should comply with the agreement; (3) The vehicle seats and luggage of both teams should be equally distributed, and treatment should be equal. The French side immediately responded in writing, fully accepting the agreement, and the two sides were able to proceed. Unexpectedly, this unfortunate incident occurred on June 1st. What was most unbearable when Bu An was behaving violently was that he insulted Mr. Hao, saying, "It wouldn't matter if I shot you now. It would just add to our filming material. And I am teaching you Chinese a small lesson." Such insults were truly unbearable. As for the unequal treatment along the way, such as skimping on the Chinese team members' meals, outwardly claiming equality but only giving them two or four or five pieces of dry, coarse bread each day, not allowing them to eat their fill, while secretly providing the French team members with milk, beer, coffee, sugar, and other items, showing preferential treatment, and the French team members were not polite to Mr. Chu Minyi himself. Mr. Chu did not eat meat and asked Bu An for vegetarian food, but Bu An replied to his face, "Eat it or don't, I can't prepare it for you personally." Mr. Chu had no choice but to endure it. In short, the French team members' unreasonable actions and contemptuous manner were all embarrassing. However, these were minor personal matters and need not be mentioned. But their violence and filming of bound-foot women and beggars begging for food, deliberately insulting the Chinese, were truly harmful to national dignity and could no longer be tolerated. Now that they have returned to Beiping, they are reporting the facts to everyone. As for their response: (1) Please order the governments of the Xinjiang and Gansu provinces to refuse entry to the French team members, detain the team's vehicles, and arrest the culprit Bu An; (2) Please request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Military Affairs to revoke the passports issued to the French team members; (3) Please request the Academic Associations to cancel the cooperation between the two sides; (4) Please request the Academic Associations to maintain the aftermath of the Chinese team members withdrawing in Suzhou, and it would be best to help them leave the French team and continue to Xinjiang to complete their westward expedition; (5) Please request the government to lodge a protest with the French side and demand punishment, apology, and compensation to uphold national dignity. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. Hao, Zhou, and others have drafted a memorial and circular telegram to report the truth to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Military Affairs and request a serious protest. The four Chinese team members in Suzhou, Yao Xijiu, Jiao Jihua, Liu Zhen'e, and Yang Zhongjian, have decided to withdraw. Team leader Chu Minyi has also taken the same attitude. It is still unknown whether they will be able to travel west in the future. However, the team has suffered a major blow after this incident. It is feared that the French team members will not be able to continue westward. However, the outcome of the negotiations depends on the efforts of the Academic Associations.

<h3>Measures for Repaying Grain and Forage Loans</h3>
<p>Annual Interest Rate of 6%, Principal and Interest Repaid in Three Years</p>
<p>Temporarily Guaranteed by the Shuohukou Customs Tariff</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: After the provincial government meeting approved the proposal to borrow 4 million yuan in grain and forage loans from various counties to repay the advances made by the counties in southern Shanxi for stationing troops, the lack of a stipulated repayment guarantee for this loan initially caused widespread suspicion and opposition, especially from the various sectors' Disbandment Committee and the Post-War Advancement Association. Now that the two associations have learned that the provincial government has already sent personnel to various counties to urge collection, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent, they will hold a joint meeting in the next two days to discuss effective countermeasures. The provincial government believes that the repayment guarantee measures are based on the opinions put forward by the provincial party department, and since it is a loan, it must of course be repaid. In order to reduce social opposition and facilitate the process, it has decided to temporarily use the Shuohukou customs tariff and various production taxes in Shanxi as collateral, formulate specific repayment measures, and officially announced them yesterday (the 15th) for immediate implementation. The details of the measures are as follows: (1) The fixed amount of the grain and forage loan is 4 million yuan, all in provincial currency, specifically for repaying the advances made by various counties for purchasing grain and forage for friendly troops before the end of May of the 20th year of the Republic of China, and shall not be used for other purposes. (2) The aforementioned loan is temporarily guaranteed by the Shuohukou customs tariff and various production taxes in Shanxi. Once the back pay owed to the various armies is received from the central government, it will be repaid immediately. If it is not received, the principal and interest will be repaid in installments from the designated tax revenue. (3) The annual interest rate of the loan is 6%, starting from the day after it is delivered to the provincial treasury. (4) The county governments shall issue receipts upon receiving the loan. When submitting the loan, they shall compile a detailed roster of the names and amounts and submit it to the provincial government's finance department for verification and issuance of loan certificates. (5) For the aforementioned loan, only interest will be paid before the end of June of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Starting from July of the 21st year, principal and interest will be repaid once every six months, and the principal and interest will be repaid in three years. The dates for repaying principal and interest are June and December each year. The accrued interest before the end of June of the 20th year will be paid together with the first installment of interest. (6) Counties that have advanced funds for grain and forage for friendly troops are allowed to retain this loan to offset their advances, but only if they have been approved. The retention of the loan shall be reported in a special report, and the date of approval by the provincial government shall be the date of delivery to the provincial treasury. (7) The Shanxi Provincial Bank is designated as the agency for repaying principal and interest for the aforementioned loan. (8) These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Business Tax in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Merchants Demand Changes to the Standards for Shop Size and Employees</p>
<p>Since the abolition of the likin tax in Guangdong Province recently, various new taxes have not yet been levied, and recent expenses have been enormous. After the new finance chief Lin Yungaishang assumed office, he found that the finances of Guangdong Province were already depleted. How could he cope with such a large military expenditure? He found that the former finance director Fan Qiwu had already completed the planning for the business tax, but it was interrupted due to the political changes. Now, in order to remedy the current emergency expenditure, he had no choice but to continue the preparations. Therefore, Lin appointed his secretary Mai Tang as the director of the business tax office, specializing in handling the matter. The office began operating on the 11th, and the measures followed those set by the previous director. Tax bureaus were set up in various counties and cities, and the tax collectors who had passed the examination were also recruited separately. However, there is still a major obstacle to starting this tax, namely the opposition of the chamber of commerce to the tax standards. The finance department recently sent a letter to the chamber of commerce, asking the chamber of commerce to contribute opinions in order to improve and facilitate the process. The letter stated that the regulations on the business tax in the province had been reviewed and resolved by the Guangdong Provincial Government's Provincial Affairs Meeting and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for record. After the abolition of the likin tax in the province, the monthly shortfall was more than 500,000 yuan. Currently, the military situation is urgent, and military expenditures are enormous. It is urgent to implement the business tax to compensate and meet the urgent needs. The previous director Fan had published the proposed regulations in various newspapers when preparing for this business tax. Later, according to requests for improvement from various merchants, he convened meetings for detailed explanations. More than a month has passed, and the merchants should have understood and comprehended the good intentions of the authorities in implementing the business tax and the perfection of the meanings of the various articles. In order to consider the merchants' situation, the Chamber of Commerce is requested to gather opinions from various merchants by the 18th of this month and propose measures that the Chamber of Commerce deems feasible, and urgently send them to the district office for review and handling. Please do not delay. The chamber of commerce has been collecting opinions from various industries in recent days. Most of them believe that the standards for shop size and employees used by the former finance director Fan as the basis for taxation hinder the development of the commercial future and violate the original intent of the business tax. There are thirty industries that advocate abolishing this standard. According to news from the finance department yesterday, the authorities intend to abolish the standards for shop size and employees. The reason is that the authorities are eager to raise funds and have to slightly accommodate the merchants' requests in order to implement the tax as soon as possible. (June 15th)</p>
<h3>Fan Shisheng Reports the Suppression of Bandit He</h3>
<p>Kuang Jixun Flees Back to Qiliping</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the bandit He Long's troops in western Hubei fled into Junxian and Yunxian, they occupied important passes such as Wudang Mountain, Yuanheguan, and Taihe Mountain, hoping to prolong their lives. After being pursued and suppressed by Fan Shisheng's 51st Division, from the 11th to the 14th of this month, all the areas occupied by the bandits were completely recovered. He led the remaining bandits to flee southwest. Fan Shisheng telegraphed yesterday to report on the suppression of He's bandits: "According to the telegrams from the heads of our division's Wang and Xie regiments, after our troops defeated He's bandits at Sunjiawan Laoying Palace on the 9th, the bandits immediately built fortifications in the Wudang Mountain and Yuanheguan area. This morning, our army again launched an attack. The Tan regiment advanced towards Juzi Tooth, and part of the Wang regiment and Li battalion advanced fiercely from the south, while the rest took a encircling position from the left wing. They engaged the bandits at Yuhuangding. Our army launched a brave assault, and at the same time, the artillery company also bombarded the bandit positions fiercely. After four hours of fierce fighting, they occupied the important and heavily fortified areas of Yuhuangding, Huilongguan, and Mozhenjing. The bandits retreated to Taizipo and resisted again. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the government army fought bravely, and Taizipo was occupied on that day. The bandits retreated again to Caishenmiao and Ziyungong, relying on the danger of the Shibapan and Caishenmiao to resist stubbornly. We followed up and pursued them on the day, and the bandits were unable to support themselves. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them directly and occupied Shibapan Wudang Mountain again. The bandits fled to Taihe Mountain. On the day, we led our troops to pursue and suppress them. The bandits still resisted relying on the danger, but they eventually ran out of ammunition and exhausted their skills and fled in the southwest direction. Our army completely recovered Taihe Mountain. It was found that the bandits were from the 7th and 8th divisions and a training regiment, with about 10,000 people and about 4,000 to 5,000 guns. In this battle, the bandit troops suffered more than 1,000 casualties, and more than 200 male and female red bandits and wounded soldiers were captured, and dozens of guns, more than 20 mules and horses, and more than 500 dan of grain were seized. Our army also suffered more than 40 casualties of officers and soldiers. The bandits were severely damaged and fled at the sound of the wind. We ordered the local teams to intercept them everywhere, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. Respectfully reported, Fan Shisheng." As for the bandits along the Yangtze River in western Hubei, after being encircled and suppressed by Xu Yuanquan's troops, they have been largely pacified. It is now heard that Liu Xiang will also serve as the Director-General of Bandit Suppression in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in order to command the search and suppression of the remaining bandits.</p>

After recovering Hekou, the bandits fled to their old nest in Qiliping. In order to completely eliminate them, the Wuhan Garrison Command ordered Ji Hongchang to send a team to join Xiao's division in suppressing them. Ji left Xinyang by car on the 19th and arrived in Hankou. Xiao also arrived in Hankou from Huang'an on the same day. After visiting Director He for instructions, he will return to the defense line to supervise the suppression. (June 19th)</p>

<h3>Giant Bandit Zhou Hanzi Arrested in Shandong</h3>
<p>Bandit Zhou's Right Leg Is Broken, He Only Has a Prosthetic Leg</p>
<p>But After Being Captured, He Actually Jumped Out of the Car Window to Escape</p>
<p>The Police Bravely Tracked Him Down and Brought Him Back</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Zhou Hanzi, a giant bandit who roamed the three provinces of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui, once led more than a thousand bandits to occupy the area of Xiaoxian, Suxian, and Yongcheng, robbing, kidnapping, burning, and committing all kinds of evil. The people hated him to the bone. Xiaoxian offered a reward of 2,000 yuan for his arrest, and Suxian offered a reward of 1,500 yuan for his arrest, but neither was successful. On the 14th of this month, Wang Xinlan, the magistrate of Suxian, heard that Bandit Zhou was hiding in Li Yinzhai, which belongs to Wenshang County, northwest of Jining. He immediately sent Yu Chengyi, the second squad leader of the eighth district guard group stationed in Suixikou, with eleven armed policemen and four plainclothes policemen, each carrying guns and ammunition, to depart from Suixikou. They arrived in Jining on the 16th. On the morning of the 17th, the Jining County Government sent ten policemen to assist. They took a car to Li Yinzhai. The giant bandit was captured while he was smoking opium. Two female hostages were also found, one was Zhang Yan, about twenty years old, and the other was the virgin Xu, about twenty years old. In the afternoon at 4 pm, they were taken back to Jining together and transferred to Yanzhou. When taking the Pingpu train south, at 9 pm the military drove south from Hanzhuang Station for about fifteen miles, the giant bandit suddenly jumped out of the window, and the guards also jumped down. Eight more policemen got out of the car and tracked him down. After about a mile, they captured the bandit back and took another train south. On the morning of the 18th, the car arrived in Xuzhou. The police and Bandit Zhou stayed at the Daguan Hotel. The reporter went to visit and saw that the bandit's right leg was broken, and he only had a leather prosthetic leg. The police were afraid that the bandit would escape, so they took off his prosthetic leg. The bandit was smoking opium, and a policeman was massaging his back. After a short rest, the bandit cursed incessantly. Squad Leader Yu told the reporter that he planned to take a car to Suixikou tomorrow morning and then go to Suxian. It is heard that the thick man once served as the commander of the regiment under Sun Jingtai, who was previously defeated in the 27th division.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Department Presents a Document to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Opposing the Establishment of a Narcotics Suppression Bureau</p>
<p>It has recently been reported that "the government has decided to establish a National Narcotics Suppression Bureau, which will be directly under the Ministry of Finance. Narcotics Suppression Bureaus will be established in each province, subordinate to the National Narcotics Suppression Bureau. Li Hongji has been appointed by the Ministry of Finance as the Director." It is also reported that people are discussing that the government's policy on narcotics suppression will change direction. The association is alarmed by the severe harm of opium and is pained by the spread of narcotics. After hearing about it, we are horrified and saddened and feel sorry for our party. Our country was oppressed by imperialism, starting with the Opium War. Unfortunately, we failed, and we had to cede land and pay reparations to form an alliance under the city. At that time, the people's hearts were not dead, and they still knew to wipe out the shame and take revenge. When the Republic of China was established, the power of the country was stolen by warlords. These warlords only knew how to fight for land and profit and exploit the people. But they still did not dare to defy the world and openly advocate abolishing the ban on opium and using opium tax as a source of income. When our party unified the country and raised the banner of the Three People's Principles to save the country and the people, the people of the country followed suit. The reason is that justice lies in the hearts of the people. Our Party Leader deeply knew the harm of opium, which could destroy the country and exterminate the race. In 1924, he issued an anti-narcotics statement, saying that "the opium business can absolutely not coexist with the national government granted power by the people." He also said, "Anyone who advocates that the law allows the opium business and the customs allow opium to be imported to fill the coffers is a temporary expedient and an enemy of public opinion. If the responsible government agency lowers its flag and ceases to suppress opium for its own convenience, no matter how long or short, it is an act of treason." The last words are there, and we must not ignore them. In order to thoroughly ban narcotics, our party followed the Party Leader's last words and established a Narcotics Suppression Committee by the national government to take charge of the matter. The people of the country said that China's narcotics could be completely eradicated from now on. The revolutionary government hates evil like an enemy and cannot be compared with the Manchu Qing government and the era of warlords. It will be able to thoroughly declare war to the end against the evil opium drug. But soon there was talk of the opium monopoly, which spread at home and abroad. The association was deeply afraid that this kind of rumor would damage the prestige of our party's government. It had previously requested the Council to announce the truth in order to refute the rumors. It was later ordered to reply that the National Government had replied, "Banning opium is the government's established policy and is being implemented. There is no such thing as a monopoly." The report was published, and the doubts were dispelled. When the National Assembly opened, Chairman Chiang reiterated the government's anti-narcotics stance to all national representatives, and the people were happy. Now, not long after, there is the ominous news that the government has decided to establish a Narcotics Suppression Bureau directly under the Ministry of Finance, which is spreading in society. This further confirms that the previous talk of a monopoly was not entirely unfounded. It is not impossible for the government to ban opium and set up a special narcotics suppression agency. However, it is obvious that the intention of subordinating the narcotics suppression agency to the Ministry of Finance is self-evident. The government already has a National Narcotics Suppression Committee to handle narcotics suppression matters. Why is there another such incongruous Narcotics Suppression Bureau subordinate to the Ministry of Finance? This is truly confusing. Our country has suffered from opium for decades, and the pain is deep and unbearable. Therefore, the people of the country regard opium as a snake or scorpion and advocate a thorough ban. Even women and children know that the method of using opium tax to fill the coffers is not feasible. Moreover, today's revolutionary government bears the mission of realizing the party's agenda. How can it lower its flag and cease to suppress opium, which is unanimously hated by the people of the country, and use it for profit? The association deeply wishes that the news reported is not true. However, the people are talking about it, and it is not entirely unfounded. If unfortunately this news becomes a reality, not only will the government's prestige be completely lost, but what will our party say to the people's accusations and silence the reactionaries? The association is respectfully mindful of the Party Leader's earnest words and sees the rampant narcotics in the country. We dare not speak out what we fear. Therefore, we specially present this document for review and request the National Government to pay close attention and not be misled by villains, lest we leave behind regret. We await orders with trepidation. Respectfully presented to the Central Executive Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee,</p>

He married Zhang Wuchang, the niece of Zhang Yunsu, the director of the county relief home. Because Wang found Zhang to be too assertive, he deeply resented her. Later, Enhao met a woman surnamed Zhou and tried to get Zhang to leave. So he encouraged Zhang to study. Zhang dropped out of school last month due to illness and returned home. Enhao was furious when he saw her, saying that she had no ambition to study, and proposed divorce terms to the Zhang family. But the Zhang family was an old scholarly family and refused to accept the word "divorce." As a result, Wang's feelings for his wife worsened, and he abused her every day. Zhang Wuchang knew that she could not save Enhao's heart, so she hanged herself yesterday. After hearing the news, the Zhang family immediately reported it to the court. The prosecutor originally planned to come to the scene today to examine the body, but Wang Enhao begged someone to mediate.

<p>National Implementation of Improved</p>
<h3>Primary Teacher Treatment Measures</h3>
<p>After the National Assembly passed the principle of improving the treatment of primary school teachers, the Government and the Executive Yuan recently ordered the Ministry of Education to handle it. The Ministry of Education ordered the provinces and cities to quickly formulate measures to improve treatment based on the local living conditions and submit them to the Ministry for record. The order stated that the Executive Yuan's Order No. 2810 stated that the National Government Civil Service Office's Letter No. 4455 stated that the National Assembly Secretariat's letter stated that the proposal to improve the treatment of primary school teachers to improve education efficiency proposed by Representative Ma Yinbing and others had been approved in principle by the eighth meeting of the National Assembly and submitted to the government for consideration. Please check and submit it for review. After the proposal was submitted to the twenty-second meeting of the National Government, it was decided to submit it to the Executive Yuan for consideration. Please record the case and copy the original document for compliance and handling. Accordingly, the original document is copied and issued to the relevant department for compliance and handling.</p>
<h3>- Proposal to Improve Primary School Teacher Treatment to Increase Education Efficiency</h3>
<p>Reason: Education is the foundation of a nation, and primary education is the basic training of citizens. Therefore, the responsibility of primary school teachers is extremely important. Given the heavy responsibility, their treatment should enable them to maintain an appropriate standard of living and serve the country with peace of mind. However, the treatment in all sectors is the thinnest in the education sector, and the treatment of primary school teachers is the lowest in the education sector. Taking Jiangsu Province as an example, the monthly salary of primary school teachers in most areas is less than ten yuan. Jiangsu Province is known as a developed education area, and the treatment is still like this, so the situation in other provinces can be imagined. Primary school teachers' annual income is not enough for their needs, not enough for savings, and even unable to maintain their personal lives. There is nothing more unfair in the world than this. In recent years, the cost of living has increased day by day, and the salary of primary school teachers should also be appropriately increased in proportion. Moreover, education is a specialized profession that must be undertaken by trained and experienced personnel. If the salary is meager and insufficient to support them, trained and experienced personnel will inevitably seek other livelihoods and leave education. As a result, those with little training and experience who are literate will muddle along, and the future of education will fall into a tragic situation. Even if those who are trained and experienced are forced to serve, they will inevitably engage in perfunctory work and fail to fulfill their duties, which will reduce education efficiency. Therefore, at this time of popularizing education, in order to enable primary school teachers to serve with peace of mind and fulfill their responsibilities to increase education efficiency, the only way is to improve treatment. A plan is proposed for public decision.</p>
<p>Measures: (1) Improve the treatment of primary school teachers according to the current social living standards to ensure that the salary of primary school teachers can maintain a minimum standard of living. The specific measures shall be formulated by the education authorities of each province and city and submitted to the National Government for implementation. (2) Stipulate the maximum salary for primary school teachers based on the teacher's education, experience, and performance, and implement annual salary increases until the maximum amount is reached. The specific measures shall be formulated by the education authorities of each province and city and submitted to the National Government for implementation. Proposers: Ma Yinbing, Huang Yuren, Gao Bozhen, and 55 others.</p>

<h3>Memorial for Miss Mary Elizabeth Wood</h3>
<p>- A Pioneer of Chinese Libraries -</p>
<p>Memorial Service Held in Wuchang on June 13th</p>
<p>The Wuchang education community and libraries held a memorial service for Miss Mary Elizabeth Wood, an American pioneer of Chinese libraries, at the Boone Library on June 13th. Over 600 people attended.</p>
<p>Brief Biography Miss Wood was born in the United States. In 1900, the Boxer Rebellion shocked the world. Miss Wood came to China alone to visit her younger brother and stayed in Wuchang to teach at Boone University. Miss Wood witnessed that the weakness of our country was due to the backwardness of culture. To promote culture and develop people's wisdom, the most important tool should be libraries. Therefore, she made a grand vow to raise funds and build the magnificent Boone Library in Wuchang in 1910, which was the beginning of public libraries in our country. Subsequently, more than 900 public libraries have been established in various provinces. The contribution of Miss Wood cannot be ignored. She also subsidized students to study library science in the United States and founded the Boone Library School in 1920. More than 70 graduates have served in libraries at home and abroad. Miss Wood went to the United States twice. The first time was to lobby the US government and members of the Senate and House of Representatives to return the Boxer Indemnity for Chinese cultural and educational undertakings. In recent years, our country has had a so-called Cultural and Educational Fund, and Miss Wood played an important role in it.</p>

The arithmetic time for the first grade will be added to the national language course.

<h3>Graduation Ceremonies at Various Schools</h3>
<p>Fudan University</p>
<p>Shanghai Fudan University held its 22nd graduation ceremony yesterday (20th) at 10:00 AM.

Norwood, US Commercial Counselor, and Yu Jitai, totaling 600 to 700 attendees. President Li Denghui presided, and Mr. Wen Chongxin served as the master of ceremonies. First, the chairman delivered a speech, followed by Secretary Jin reporting on the university's organization, administration, finances, and the number of graduates.

It is hoped that everyone will take the lead in establishing a superior foundation and move forward calmly, just as a great craftsman builds a house to completion. Next, the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Xu Peihuang, gave a speech, saying that he had three thoughts for the students: (1) It is hoped that everyone can uphold the spirit of hard work and endurance and start from the lower levels, not aiming too high, so that nothing can be accomplished.

University graduates account for a ratio of 20,000 to 1 in the national population, and their position is extremely important. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone can be courageous and move forward.

Now, with the consent of the annual chairman, National Tongji University, and the support of the Jiangsu Provincial authorities, it has been decided to change this year's national vocational education discussion conference to Zhenjiang. This is because it is close to the capital and is a new provincial governance location. It is also at a time when the Ministry of Education is actively promoting vocational education. Holding the meeting there can attract attention from all parties and achieve greater results. The meeting is scheduled for August 1st and 2nd, and the venue is Boxian Park. This letter is sent to you to request that your institution nominate one to three representatives to attend as soon as possible. By July 5th, please provide detailed information on the institution's name, the representative's name, the railway or waterway starting and ending points, and the round-trip dates, so that the society can compile a list and submit it to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications for approval. The society will then send a certificate for discounted train or boat tickets, so that the representatives attending the meeting can purchase tickets at the railway stations and the shipping companies under the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company with the certificate and enjoy preferential treatment. In addition to submitting concise reports on the facility's situation and the difficulties and experiences encountered, the conference will also discuss general vocational education. The society will compile implementation plans and various standard outlines for public discussion. The proposals submitted by each institution should be based on the resolutions of the last meeting, focusing on the issues of graduate employment, moral education and teaching, and women's domestic education and rural education, in order to focus the discussion and achieve satisfactory results.

Each bond only saw transactions of several thousand yuan. There were no transactions for disarmament, 1929 rehabilitation, and 20-year cigarette bonds. As for the trend of various bonds this week, the market squeeze on Monday was still quite obvious. Short sellers covered their positions, and market demand continued to surge. The gap between supply and demand widened, and prices continued to rise sharply from the previous week. The June and July contracts for the 20-year cigarette bonds and the July contracts for the disarmament and 20-year customs bonds all rose to the limit price and trading was suspended. Other bonds also continued to rise by about 2-3 yuan. However, afterwards, a certain party believed that bond prices had risen significantly in recent weeks, and the market situation was still characterized by excessive demand. Therefore, they took the opportunity to sell off gradually. As a result, the market situation eased slightly, and bond prices also weakened accordingly. On Tuesday, prices fell back by about one yuan. On Wednesday, there were mixed gains and losses, with small fluctuations. On Thursday, prices continued to fall slightly by one yuan to one and a half yuan. However, on Friday, the market turned firm again. The 20-year customs bonds rose by about 2.67 yuan, and the demobilization and disarmament bonds also improved by about one yuan to one and a half yuan. The trend of the bond market is still relatively strong. However, judging from the current environment, it seems unlikely that there will be a continued large increase in the short term. As a result, compared to last week, the 20-year customs bonds rose by nearly four yuan, the 20-year cigarette bonds improved by about three and a half yuan, and the 1929 customs bonds, rehabilitation bonds, demobilization bonds, disarmament bonds, etc., also continued to rise by about two yuan. Other trends were more moderate. The statistics of the highest, lowest, and net changes in the prices of various bonds in the past five days are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn: American Cotton Retraces After Initial Short Covering</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose due to positive news from Liverpool, prompting buying by peers and short covering. Futures rose by 23-26 points, and spot prices rose by 25 points. British cotton futures fell by 6-7 points, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to profit-taking by bulls and selling by speculators, but then recovered due to positive news from Liverpool. The market closed quietly and steadily. Pingle and Omar rose by 3 rupees, while White Luo Creek fell by 2 rupees. Original telegraph record on the left (telegram of the 19th).</p>

<p>Silk and Tea: Silkworm Plague Discovered in Shaoxing Summer Silkworms</p>
<p>Continuous Old Rain...Stuffy and Humid...Silkworm Diseases Abound</p>
<p>This year, farmers in various cities and towns in Shaoxing, due to the poor harvest of spring cocoons, have started raising summer silkworms earlier, and the amount of silkworms raised is no less than that of spring silkworms. Unfortunately, due to the difficulty in purchasing seeds, the local species and the foreign species are mixed for rearing. When the big batch of silkworms entered the third sleep stage, continuous moldy rain fell in recent days, and the climate was stuffy and humid. Consequently, the silkworms contracted diseases due to the wet temperature. The disease is characterized by black liquid and yellow watery discharge. If the silkworm plague spreads, it will be very rapid. Instructors are currently trying to isolate and selectively discard the summer silkworms. The future is still viewed with pessimism.</p>
<p>Hardware Market Quiet During Dragon Boat Festival</p>
<p>Yesterday was the traditional Dragon Boat Festival. Hardware transactions were even quieter. The visiting merchants and local shops were all settling their accounts for the festival, so there were no additional purchases. Consequently, the market was merely decorative. Besides occasional retail sales from shops, large-scale business can be described as desolate.</p>

<h3>A Record of Two Women Running Away</h3>
<p>Zhu Sen Achieves Two Goals with One Arrow</p>
<p>Xu Zhaodi Cannot Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>Tang Xiulin Is Shameless</p>
<p>Tang Baoshan, the owner of the Victory Candy and Biscuit Shop at 932 Wuding Road, whose ancestral home is Ningbo, has a daughter named Xiulin, who is 29 years old and unmarried. She is good friends with Xu Zhaodi, a neighboring girl. Zhaodi is in her early twenties, beautiful and naturally flirtatious. She has long been involved with Zhu Sen, a clerk at the Hexing Foreign Goods Store at 930, whose ancestral home is Anhui. Zhu is only 22 years old and still unmarried. They have a long-standing agreement to marry each other, but Zhaodi's parents remain ignorant. Recently, they even betrothed their daughter to someone else. Both parties were greatly disappointed. Zhaodi, wanting to comfort her lover, introduced Xiulin to Zhu. They fell in love at first sight and were both satisfied. Zhaodi then took it upon herself to act as a matchmaker, repeatedly speaking on Zhu’s behalf to Tang Baoshan. Tang and Zhu lived next to each other, and Tang had long been aware of Zhu's ambiguous behavior with Zhaodi. He was unwilling to marry his daughter to Zhu, so he sternly refused. Zhu was extremely frustrated upon hearing this news, and Xiulin was even more depressed. Zhaodi was also concerned that she might marry the wrong person, since she was unable to fulfill the beautiful union between Zhu and Xiulin.</p>
<p>Each of the three had their own grievances, so they gathered to plot a plan to live together. Other than eloping, there was no other way. They immediately began to carry out their plan separately. Zhu Sen rented a two-story building at 431 nearby, furnished it, and asked the shop owner for a month's leave, claiming that he was returning to his hometown to visit his relatives. Xiulin, on the night of the 17th of this month, took advantage of her parents' deep sleep to steal a deposit book for 700 yuan from the Si Ming Bank, packed her bags, and</p>
<p>secretly went downstairs from the balcony and out through the back door. When she arrived at the entrance of the lane, Zhu and Zhaodi had already hired a car to wait for her. The three of them got into the car together and drove to Zhu's place. That night, Zhu's wish to achieve two goals with one arrow was completely satisfied. The next morning, Xiulin went to the Si Ming Bank and withdrew all the deposits. By the time Tang discovered that his daughter had run away with the money, he rushed to Si Ming to stop the payment, but it was too late. He had no choice but to report to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent Detective Liu Yongxiang to investigate Zhu's whereabouts. They were arrested at 4 PM the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Zhu and the two women were still asleep at noon and hadn’t arisen. The detectives knocked for a long time before waking them up from their sweet dreams. They put on their clothes and opened the door, and were immediately taken into custody. Xiulin had 600 yuan in cash hidden on her body, and Zhu also had 112 yuan hidden on him. All of this was found during the search, and together with the baggage, they were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, the parents of the girl were summoned to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng Shide conducted the preliminary hearing. Tang Baoshan requested severe punishment for Xu Zhaodi, stating that his daughter's elopement with the money was solely due to Xu Zhaodi's instigation after failing to act as a successful matchmaker. He also stated that the deposits were his wife's personal savings, which were kept for their son, so the deposit book was under the name of his son, Xinfu. Although his daughter also had deposits, it was only 30 yuan. Tang's wife, Wang, also testified in court, recounting the details of Zhaodi acting as a matchmaker for Zhu Sen. Questioned by Xiulin, she claimed that the money was given to her by her father, so she took the deposit book with her before leaving. As for her love affair with Zhu Sen, it was entirely voluntary, and she had been repeatedly scolded by her mother for this reason, which is why she eloped. However,</p>
<p>she has not yet shared a bed with Zhu. She suggested that if they did not believe her, they could inspect her body. Zhaodi also testified that she had discussed renting a house with Zhu with Xiulin because she was scolded by her mother, and denied acting as a matchmaker. Zhu Sen testified that the matter was voluntary by the two women, and he did not seduce them. After questioning, Judge Feng ordered the defendants to remain in custody separately and scheduled a hearing for a later date.</p>
<h3>Forging Official Documents to Defraud Money</h3>
<p>Oil Factory Owner Covets Vanity</p>
<p>Both Documents Are Forged</p>
<p>A Cantonese man named Wu Wen, who claimed to be a news reporter from the Hangzhou East China News Agency, borrowed five silver dollars from his fellow townsman Li Guohua, the owner of the Huachang Oil Factory, last year in Shanghai, and then they parted ways. On April 12th of this year, Wu visited Li at the factory's distribution office at 322 North Shaanxi Road. He noticed many official licenses and approvals hanging in the reception room, and inferred that the business must be very developed. Feeling envious, he said to Li, "Your factory's business is indeed expanding daily. I suppose it has not yet been sold nationwide. Although the official commendations are already hanging all over the walls, if you could obtain approvals from the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, your reputation would be even greater, and your business would naturally expand without further effort. Last year, I passed through Shanghai, and my funds were insufficient. I encountered you on the road, and you kindly helped me out of my predicament. I will never forget your kindness. If you are interested in obtaining commendation documents from the highest military and political organs such as the Executive Yuan, I have a close relative who is currently serving in the Executive Yuan, who can be of some assistance to repay your generosity in giving me money in the past." Li, hearing these words and seeing Wu's Western-style suit and leather shoes, with a spirited appearance unlike his impoverished state last year, deeply believed him. He asked if any fees were required. Wu, realizing that Li was already hooked, replied with a smile, "A small fee of one hundred yuan is sufficient." Li gave him the money as requested and entrusted the matter to him solemnly. Wu then left. A week later, he returned to Li's place, taking out a document of approval, with the seal of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters stamped on it. He said that the approval from the Executive Yuan would also be issued soon. Li, seeing this official-looking document, was overjoyed and thanked him repeatedly. He did not distinguish whether it was genuine or fake, and immediately posted it on the wall. On April 27th, a man named Chen Yadong claimed to have been entrusted by Wu to meet with Li. After some discussion, Chen took out the document of approval No. 293 from the Executive Yuan, with the seal of Chiang Kai-shek, the concurrent head of the Yuan, stamped on it. Li was overjoyed and immediately gave Chen fifty yuan in cash and gifts worth one hundred and fifty yuan, asking Chen to pass them on to Wu as a reward. Afterwards, Li suddenly became suspicious and sent a photo of the Executive Yuan's approval to Nanjing for verification. He received a reply stating that it was forged and asking Li to investigate the forger. Wu happened to come to Li's place again the day before yesterday afternoon. Li secretly reported to the HSBC Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest Wu. Upon questioning, they learned that Wu was residing at No. 1 Rongqing Lane, Brainee Montmartre Road, French Concession. They immediately contacted the French Police Station and sent detectives to search the premises together. They found many forged envelopes from the Wujin Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, Wu was escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Wu conducted the preliminary hearing. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, stated the circumstances of the case, requesting that Wu be punished for the crime of forging official seals under Article 235 of the Criminal Law. Li Guohua also detailed the repeated false pretenses and deceptions of the defendant. Questioned by Li, Wu claimed that all the approvals were obtained by Chen Yadong on his behalf, and he did not know whether they were genuine or fake. Judge Wu ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled the hearing for seven days later.</p>
<h3>The Litigation Over Xue Chan's Estate Continues Unabated</h3>
<p>Five More Nephews File a Lawsuit</p>
<p>The litigation over the estate of wealthy merchant Xue Baorun is endless. Now, five of his nephews, Xue Jinfu, Jinfu, Jinchen, Jinxiang, and Jinliang, have filed a lawsuit against Xue Baorun's wife, Sun, and his sons, Gansheng, Yansheng, Jiasheng, and Gengsheng, demanding that the defendants be ordered to hand over the estate of ten million yuan for equal distribution. However, given the enormous amount of the lawsuit, the plaintiffs are unable to pay the litigation fees and have requested assistance. The request has been approved. Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court held a hearing. The defendants did not attend, but sent a lawyer to represent them. According to the plaintiffs' lawyer, the plaintiffs are all sons of Xue Baorun's brothers, Baogeng and Baolin. Currently, Baolin's daughter, Songyun, has also joined the lawsuit and should be approved to participate. The defendants' lawyer expressed his opinion on the approved litigation assistance, stating that the plaintiffs had previously been involved in a lawsuit with Xue Baorun in the French Concession in the seventeenth year of the Republic, which was resolved through settlement and a settlement agreement was signed. The plaintiffs' lawyer stated that although there was a lawsuit at the time, Xue Baorun claimed that his property was only over ten thousand yuan. Therefore, the plaintiffs, persuaded by relatives and friends, reached a settlement with him. However, it has now been discovered that the property is actually worth ten million, a tenfold difference, which is why they are refiling the lawsuit. Judge Xu ordered that the issue of revoking litigation assistance be decided after investigation and rescheduled the case for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Adultery and Abduction of a Friend's Wife</h3>
<p>Defiling Her Body and Attempting to Sell Her</p>
<p>Where Is Chen Xiaoxian's Conscience?</p>
<p>Sun Zhenyou, a native of Bengbu, went to Nanjing with his wife, Sun Ren, to seek employment. After arriving in Nanjing, Sun Ren became separated from her husband due to unfamiliarity with the place. While she was searching for him, she met Chen Xiaoxian, a fellow townsman of her husband. Upon seeing Sun Ren, who was 29 years old and of decent appearance, Chen devised a plan to lure her to Shanghai. He housed her at the Zhongxin Hotel on Jielu Road in the North Railway Station area. Sun Ren was induced to Shanghai and sexually assaulted by Chen. However, Chen had ulterior motives and took Sun Ren to the residence of a friend in Baotai, Wusong, with the intention of selling her. Liu Jingshun, a guard at the Songhu Naval Command, discovered this and detained Chen Xiaoxian and Sun Ren, sending them to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau. Zhao Zezhou, the district chief, questioned Chen Xiaoxian. Chen claimed to have served as a recruitment officer and other military positions in Bengbu and was a colleague of Sun Zhenyou. He was evasive about the rest of the story. When questioned, Sun Ren claimed that she had been lured to Shanghai and had spent three nights with Chen. Her husband was still in Nanjing. After inquiring about the details, the district chief immediately sent detectives to the hotel in Shanghai to verify the information, which was confirmed. Regardless of whether Chen Xiaoxian was a military officer or an impostor, it was proven that he had committed adultery and abduction of a married woman. He was ordered to be formally transferred to the Third Section yesterday for further investigation and processing.</p>
<p>Butcher</p>
<h3>Using Electricity to Kill Rats Leads to Self-Electrocution</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, Rubber and Other Insulating Materials Were Not Used</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 6 PM, Zhu Goulang, a 33-year-old butcher from Chongming who worked at Fei Xingfa's slaughterhouse on Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, caught a live rat in an iron cage in the factory shed. Zhu suddenly had a strange idea to kill the rat with electricity. He held an iron hook in his right hand and hung it on a pillar, while holding the iron cage in his left hand. He then removed the light bulb and applied electricity to the iron hook to make contact with the iron cage. Unexpectedly, the rat was not killed, and Zhu was electrocuted and fell to the ground. Zhu did not use rubber or wood to insulate himself. People discovered him but it was too late to save him, and he died. The butcher shop reported the incident to the Zhongxing Road Police Station, which in turn reported it to the Fourth District Headquarters. Today, the local guarantor will go to the Shanghai Local Court to request an autopsy.</p>
<p>Woman Zhu Guilin</p>
<h3>Accusation Against Uncle and Cousin</h3>
<p>Request for Division of Inheritance</p>
<p>A local woman, Zhu Guilin, represented by lawyer Yan, stated in a civil case at the French Concession Court that the plaintiff's father, Zhu Yatou, had only three daughters. The eldest daughter, Guiying, had already passed away. The second daughter, Guibao, had been adopted into another family. The plaintiff, being the third daughter, had been studying at the Xujiahui Church since childhood. All of her late father's inheritance had been managed by her paternal uncle, Zhu Shengquan, and cousins, Xin Kun and Jin Hua, without any division. Now that the plaintiff has come of age and the National Government has promulgated the right of women to inherit property, the court should order the defendants to hand over all the property for distribution. Upon being summoned yesterday, the defendants, also represented by a lawyer, argued that the first defendant, Zhu Shengquan's father, Rongzhang, the plaintiff's grandfather, had three sons. The plaintiff's father was from the eldest branch, while the defendant Shengquan was from the second branch. The third branch had two sons, namely Jin Kun and Jin Hua. All of the Zhu family's inheritance had already been divided. Zhu Yatou's property had been sold to the defendants by the plaintiff, Zhu Guilin, ten years ago for 4,000 yuan, and a deed of sale was drawn up, witnessed by Zhu Xiangong of the church. The contract is now presented for review. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff vehemently denies this. The money obtained at that time was for school fees, not proceeds from the sale of property. Furthermore, ten years ago, the plaintiff was still young and immature and could not have had the capacity to sell property. The court is requested to investigate carefully. Judge Gong ordered the parties to withdraw and await further summons and verification.</p>

<h3>The Truth of the Seduction and Abandonment Case Comes to Light</h3>
<p>The case of Chen Xuanying, a 17-year-old girl from Suzhou, who was allegedly seduced and abandoned by Guan Daming, the supervisor of a leather shoe store at the Gaodi Foreign Firm, has been clarified. Guan Daming had denied the allegations in his testimony, so Prosecutor Wu specially dispatched police officer Xu Jinqing to investigate the Shenzhou Hotel yesterday. It was found that Room 204 in November last year was occupied for only one day by someone named Dai Xingyi, but it is unknown whether this was an alias used by Guan. However, an investigation of the registration book at the New Gaosheng Hotel revealed that Guan Daming indeed stayed there with a female companion for two nights, starting on December 6th, in Room 36. He was listed as an employee of the Gaodi Foreign Firm and made two phone calls. The tea server, Wu Ronglin, also testified that Guan was a Western suit-wearer. After reviewing Chen's statement, Prosecutor Wu has a clear understanding of the case. He interrogated Chen Xuanying, who stated that Guan had taken her to a movie around June last year, and they had a relationship. At that time, her father was working as an accountant for Guan. Her father has since resigned. In the afternoon, her father, Chen Youhe, turned himself in, requesting to take his daughter home. The judge had the father and daughter meet in court. They embraced and wept bitterly. The judge then told Chen Youhe that his daughter had attempted suicide in Pudong on the 12th and that he should take her back, discipline her well, and prevent her from having suicidal thoughts again. The case will be further investigated after summoning his eldest daughter to court for questioning. Chen immediately thanked the court and took his daughter home.</p>
<h3>Breaking a Pottery Jug Scalds a Young Girl</h3>
<p>The Tragic Situation of Miao Abaobao</p>
<p>Miao Abaobao, the nine-year-old daughter of Mrs. Miao Zhu of No. 5, Ping'an Lane, Chang'an Road, Zhabei, went to a hot water vendor to get water the day before yesterday. A man named Tao Changke also came to get water and collided with Abaobao. The pottery jug in Tao's hand fell to the ground and shattered, and the boiling water inside poured onto Abaobao's head, like a ritualistic ablution with a pouring vessel. Abaobao's head, face, chest, shoulders, and back were scalded. She was in extreme pain and rolled around on the ground. Her mother heard the commotion, ran out, and called the police, who arrested Tao and took him to the Second Precinct of the Fourth District. Because Abaobao's injuries were severe, she was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Tao was transferred to the District Court for questioning.</p>

Also, yesterday afternoon at 3:00, the highest temperature in Shanghai in the past 24 hours was 73.9 degrees, and the lowest was 69.0. The highest temperature on the same day last year was 71.0, and the lowest was 65.0.</p>
<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>The Feetham Report, Volume 2 (Fourth Continuation)</h3>
<p>Summary Translation of Parts Four and Five</p>
<p>Subsequently, considering item (C), based on the current situation in China, the system of local autonomy within the Public Concession, if its ultimate control is in the hands of Chinese voters, then this system will not be of any practical use. The current period of political tutelage is based on maintaining a system of governance. If one wishes to freely exercise the functions of the Chinese system of local autonomy in an important center of political activity, and in a location that is in constant contact with the Nanjing government and the Central Party Headquarters, such as Shanghai, it is incompatible with this system of governance. Even setting aside the danger of the government or the Kuomintang controlling elections, any council with a majority of Chinese representatives will obey the directives of the National Government or the Kuomintang. In times of emergency, the Chinese representatives will inevitably be unable to vote according to the free and determined opinions they hold as representatives of Chinese society, but will instead follow the will or instructions of the government or the Kuomintang. Once Chinese representatives assume the main responsibility with a majority, the existing situation of the Public Concession government will inevitably change fundamentally. I fear that the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council will not be able to enjoy a freer environment and fulfill their responsibilities as they do today. I believe that this outcome is inevitable under the system of governance implemented today. The above considers the entire situation from the possible aspect of organizing a government with local autonomy. However, there is still one point that must be noted, namely, that in general, the Chinese have no experience in the use of the representative system. Before allowing them to participate in a democratic constitutional government through public elections, they must undergo a period of political training. This is formally recognized by the National Government's existing administrative regulations and the political procedures prepared for the future. There are indeed some extremely capable Chinese residents in the Public Concession who have received higher education. However, although these Chinese are very important to the social, commercial, and educational life and the general welfare progress they can assist in, they constitute a very small minority among all the Chinese residents in the Public Concession. Moreover, many of them, for various reasons, are unwilling to participate in public affairs except for matters directly related to themselves. As far as all the Chinese residents of the Public Concession are concerned, in the past three years, only a small part has obtained some experience in so-called participation in representative government through the informal or semi-private methods of electing Chinese directors and Chinese committee members. Therefore, in any case, before engaging in reforms and entrusting the responsibility of handling most of the Public Concession's affairs based on autonomy to Chinese representatives, it seems necessary to first undergo a period of political education. Therefore, in conclusion, the answer to item (C) must also be negative. Under the existing circumstances, a Public Concession local autonomy system established in accordance with the Charter and controlled by a majority of Chinese voters cannot be of any practical use and cannot be expected to operate smoothly. The above-mentioned answers regarding items (A), (B), and (C) all strongly oppose any policy of immediate return. The reasons for their opposition are fundamental. Any major reform of the system of governance to reconcile divergent opinions will inevitably involve certain dangers and sacrifices, so it must be carefully considered. However, this is not merely a matter of avoiding the heavy and taking the light, such as temporarily reducing the administrative rate. In fact, this kind of problem concerns the fundamental danger and destruction. The report indicates that the conclusion regarding return is based on the opinions of both Chinese and foreign residents in the Public Concession, as summarized in Chapter 3. As mentioned above, the main objection of the foreign community to return is that, under the existing circumstances, return conflicts with security. On the Chinese side, the need for a transition period before return is also based on the same reason. This is what I believe. The "security" mentioned here should have a broad meaning. As mentioned above, the more detailed reasons I have put forward are based on military, legal, political, and administrative considerations, which can also be said to be included under the general heading of security. There are many aspects of security, and there are also many ways to undermine security. The report then mentions the attitudes of the Chinese and foreign communities in the Public Concession. The responsible persons on both sides of the Chinese and foreign residents in the Public Concession have four points of agreement, which I believe to be correct: (1) The existing system of governance established in accordance with the Land Regulations has not been regarded as a permanent system of governance. If certain conditions can be implemented, there will eventually be a day when the Concession will be returned. (2) When the time for return arrives, there must be a new system of governance established in accordance with the Charter issued by the National Government to replace the existing system of governance established in accordance with the Land Regulations. This Charter is based on the continued cooperation of Chinese and foreign residents, granting full local autonomy to the Public Concession, making it a separate district or part of Shanghai. (3) Before the return, there must be a transition period, followed by a system of governance established in accordance with the Charter. This can be regarded as a practical policy. (4) During this period, the affairs of the Public Concession should be handled through close cooperation between the Chinese and foreign residents of the Concession. From this point of view, opinions have been consistent on the final goal of future policy, on the need for a transition period before reaching that goal, and on what should be the basis for handling the Public Concession's affairs during this transition period. As for the incidental issues, such as the approximate length of the transition period, and how to prudently consider the advantages and disadvantages of the organizational methods established in accordance with the Land Regulations during the transition period, there is no doubt that opinions are currently divided. The report will need to discuss these opinions later. However, I do not see any real reason why a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached, whose scope is broad enough to include all points of practical importance. Once it is generally recognized that the yardstick of future policy is return, and that after return, it will be followed by a local autonomy system established in accordance with the Charter, in which both Chinese and foreign residents can participate, there is nothing unreasonable in expecting a major improvement in the environment for dealing with all issues related to the Public Concession in the future. In central locations such as Shanghai, there are often unreasonable elements on both sides that hold each other in contention. However, it is still hoped that reason and common sense can gradually prevail. I firmly believe that the thoughtful people in the Chinese community, whose true objections to the Public Concession's system of governance can be dispelled by acknowledging that the existing system is not a permanent system, and by acknowledging that the continuation of this system must be based on the close cooperation of Chinese and foreign residents, and by peacefully resolving various disputes and making general improvements in the administration, the value and effectiveness of cooperation can be seen to increase day by day. Regarding the permanent question, if the Public Concession's system of governance is not recognized as non-permanent and is not intended to be made permanent, then the existence of this system will be seen as endangering the future of the Chinese nation. Because Shanghai is extremely important in the future, but if the relevant powers and the foreign community living in Shanghai under the protection of the powers give up any claim to the current status of the Public Concession obtained under the treaty that can be regarded as permanent, and recognize the return in the sense mentioned above as the goal of their policy, and implement the return when the situation in China changes, making it a safe policy for both the Public Concession and the entire China, then all situations will fundamentally change. At that time, the foreigners and the powers will recognize that they are only temporarily holding the Public Concession in trust for the Chinese, do not demand permanent rule over the Public Concession, and acknowledge their obligation to eventually return the Public Concession to China. The fact that the foreign community can obtain such a large degree of control over the most important part of a city and the main commercial center of the country within Chinese territory is indeed created by a continuous series of historical circumstances. However, no one had foreseen this situation, and modern people are not responsible for the original cause. Because of this situation, and with the benefit of the efforts and operations of the Chinese and foreign residents in the Public Concession, a foundation can still be created that is of great value to today's China, and its latent value is even greater for the future China. According to the existing treaties and agreements, the powers and their people are holding this created foundation in trust for China. Since they are the current protectors of the Public Concession, if they hastily return the Public Concession to China before China is ready to accept the Concession and can provide protection and development, then they will have failed to fulfill their trusted responsibility. If, at present, it can be recognized that this is a trust, and the Public Concession ruling body established in accordance with the existing organizational law seeks to cooperate effectively with the Chinese directors during the period that must be passed before the return, this will not only benefit the powers and their people but also benefit China and the Chinese people, and should be sufficient to meet the wishes of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are now the beneficiaries of the Public Concession and the ultimate heirs in the future, and their interests are greater than the total interests of all foreign interests. The second question regarding return, namely, the establishment of a new system of governance to replace the old system of governance after return, has been further considered and two conclusions have been reached as follows: (1) The maintenance of the local autonomy system within the Public Concession is extremely important for the future of the Concession. I firmly believe that both the Chinese society and the foreign society within the Public Concession generally recognize this. (2) Maintaining the Public Concession as a separate unit, or including the Public Concession within the entire Shanghai and establishing a separate municipal agency, this issue involves numerous conflicting considerations. At first glance, there is a strong reason for the administrative unity of urban areas such as Shanghai. However, the principle of administrative unity, no matter how appropriate, cannot be unified into a policy that can be realized immediately, or say that complete unity is an appropriate method that must be obtained. When considering the issue of unity, the current different situations of each district must be taken into account, namely (1) the principles and methods of governance, (2) the progress of material development, and administrative standards, (3) the comparison of financial resources. After investigating all the different situations in the existing three regions, the judgment is as follows. On the one hand, the Public Concession and the French Concession, on the other hand, the Chinese municipal government, due to the fundamental difference between them, it is not possible to place the three regions under a unified administration on any basis and effectively protect and maintain the two principles of autonomy and the rule of law on which the Public Concession's system of governance is based, and be able to implement it fairly and without hindrance. Regarding the issue of the union of the Public Concession and the French Concession, the considerations required are significantly different from those required for the union of one Concession or two Concessions with the Shanghai Municipal Government. The union of the Public Concession and the French Concession has many obvious benefits. Even if there are obstacles to implementing a system of autonomy in both regions after the union, whose principles are the same as those currently in the Public Concession, it seems not impossible to overcome them. However, there is one thing that must be acknowledged, namely, that all obstacles are caused by the long history and the different and separate development trends of the past seventy years, and it is not easy to overcome them. What can be hoped for is that the relationship between the two regions in terms of public interests and public goals may become so deep that a path of agreement can be opened, and this agreement can ultimately unite the two regions on fair and mutually beneficial terms. Regarding the final union of the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Chinese Municipal Government, the report mentions how inherent the difficulties are in any plan that seeks to organize a council within each part of the united region that exercises limited powers and is governed by a general agency. It also expresses an opinion that the more promising plan is to "establish separate autonomous systems within each municipal area, and to develop more effective cooperation among the three regions for certain common purposes, such as police and public health. After gaining experience in using this system, it may eventually be possible to establish a new officialdom to govern all of Shanghai." Issues three and four, which are related to the need for a transition period and how long this time should be, have been discussed. A general conclusion has also been made on the broad issue of return as follows: (A) Opposition to return as an immediately implemented practical policy is very strong. If return is implemented today, it will not only cause fatal damage to the "security" that business interests consider an important feature of the Public Concession's existing system of governance, but also make it impossible to effectively continue the system of local autonomy. However, in order to satisfy the wishes of the Chinese people and to enable the National Government to use its own powers to establish the Public Concession's future municipal government, the final return is a legitimate and necessary measure. After the return, the National Government will issue a Charter, granting the power of local autonomy to the Chinese and foreign residents of the Public Concession, making it a separate autonomous region or part of all of Shanghai. Therefore, this return should be regarded as the final goal of future policy. (B) Return should not be implemented before the following conditions are fulfilled: (1) The internal situation in China should improve to such an extent in terms of establishing the authority of the National Government to maintain order that the worries about having to defend the Public Concession against future civil wars, as well as other external dangers arising from local disturbances, are eliminated. (2) The meaning of the rule of law must have a solid foundation in China and must be expressed in a practical and effective manner in the various systems of the country. Constitutional government must progress to a certain time so that the National Government can use the Charter to stipulate an appropriate and lasting method based on autonomy for the future administration of the Public Concession, and ensure that the rights granted by the Charter are inviolable under a judicial system that can guarantee the independence of the courts and enable them to enforce their judgments. (3) The political situation in China must reach a degree that allows the local autonomy system to enjoy true independence within its scope of implementation, and not be subject to the National Government, or to be controlled by any party that holds privileges and occupies a prominent position, such as the Kuomintang today. (4) The Chinese community in the Public Concession must have sufficient experience in the use of the representative system so that it can assume most of the responsibility for the administration of the Public Concession and have a reasonable hope of success. (C) Before the above conditions are fully met, an extended transition period is unavoidable. Fulfilling these conditions involves a major change procedure. Chinese leaders are now engaged in this change. However, in order to create the fundamental changes required to fulfill the conditions and to test the effectiveness and durability of the changes, a considerable amount of time is required. If it is said that these two can be completed within a few years, then disappointment is to be expected. During this transition period, the Public Concession's existing system of governance established in accordance with the Land Regulations should be maintained on the basis of increased cooperation between Chinese and foreign residents. The organizational law should also be amended as needed. The so-called need is to enable the Chinese people to fully participate in the work of autonomy by prudently adding to or subtracting from the existing system and to prepare to ultimately organize a new system of governance based on the Charter issued by the National Government.</p>

<p>(1) Add one dime to 6.5 dimes, making it 7.5 dimes. Afterwards, 7.5 dimes will be the lowest price. If workers' wages are lower than average, they should be increased slightly more than 10%, and apprentices should not be overcharged. If overcharging or exploiting workers is found in the future, the labor union, trade association, and social affairs bureau can correct it at any time.</p>
<p>(2) Add 5 cents to 7 or 7.5 dimes. First, the base price is already high, and second, the actual expenditure of this 10% wage increase is less than 10% of the selling price. If more is added, the order will be considered profitable.</p>
<p>(3) No increase for the original price of 8, 8.5, or 9 dimes. There is less overcharging for Part B binding and regular binding workers. It was decided to increase 1 dime per 10,000 leaves uniformly. Starting on July 1st of this year, all newly issued orders will be implemented in accordance with the aforementioned methods. This method has also been reported to the Social Affairs Bureau and notified to the Book Ordering Industry Association.</p>

<h3>The Kantō Garrison's Police Corps Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Kantō Garrison's Police Officer Training School, which specializes in teaching senior police officers serving in the South Manchurian Dalian area under the jurisdiction of the Kantō Garrison, is sending a tour group of 22 outstanding police officers selected by the school director now that the summer vacation is approaching. The tour group will travel south from Dalian to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places to inspect the current state of public security in China. They are led by the school's preacher, Kamiyoshi Seijō, and accompanied by staff member Satō Tamimin. The police officers are: Oka Hitoshi, Kaji Hiroshi, Suzuki Tamimin, Kanjō Masakaze, Kamio Tsunenosuke, Matsubara Tadao, Nakajima Ikko, Kojima Kyūbee, Satō Chōsaku, Tsuchioka Kurō, Takayama Yoshishirō, Kiri Yoshitaka, Saka no Yoshiyoshi, Harada Akira, and Tanaka Katsuo. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Fengtian Maru steamship of the Dalian Steamship Company and landed at the Huangpu Wharf. They will first inspect Shanghai for one day and are scheduled to take a train to the capital today for sightseeing. It is said that when they arrive in Beijing, they will visit China's capital police organization and investigate the service work.</p>
<h3>The Tea Industry Changes to New Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tea Trade Association has complied with the order to change to new weights and measures. Yesterday, it issued a notice to its members stating: "By order of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau: It has been found that there are many types of weights and measures in our country, with old and new mixed together, and even different cases in the same place, with mutual discrepancies. As a result, disputes arise frequently. At this time of construction, unifying weights and measures is indeed an important task. The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce convened a weights and measures conference, drafted a plan for promoting the main body, adopted the International Metric System as the standard, and established municipal auxiliary promotion in each city to formulate a unified national procedure, which was ordered by the National Government to be followed by all provinces and cities. This city has set a deadline of July 1st for the completion of unification, and has ordered all trade associations to actively prepare and order all shops in the same trade to adopt new equipment to show compliance with the law. If there is any delay or waiting and seeing, severe punishment will be imposed." Therefore, it was decided at the 17th Executive Committee meeting to recall all the one-jin copper pan scales previously issued to each shop, re-order the new system, and wait for the re-stamping before returning them separately, so that each shop can use the scales of this association as the standard. All other scales, large and small, etc., of each shop must be re-manufactured, and do not wait and see any longer. This is what is hoped. Therefore, a corresponding notice is issued, hoping you will check and handle it.</p>

<h3>Unifying the City's Power Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>First Step Plan</p>
<p>Regarding the Pudong Electric Company again, that company's original steam turbine generator has a capacity of 750 kVA. In the 18th year of the Republic [1929], its maximum load had reached 450 kilowatts. The generator's capacity was soon to be insufficient to supply demand, and the original two boilers, with only one in operation, were not enough. Operating both boilers would leave no opportunity for replacement and cleaning, making it imperative to add new ones promptly. Furthermore, with only one generator and no backup, the situation was also considered dangerous. Given the trend of industrial development in Pudong, the company's future business progress should focus on attracting electricity users. However, electricity users require substantial power, which small-scale equipment cannot meet. Expanding equipment involves significant costs, and even if financially feasible, it is not the most economical solution. Therefore, the company was instructed to consult with the China General Edison Company [Huashang Electric Company] about power supply. However, with one company in Pudong and the other in Puxi, connecting power lines required crossing the Huangpu River. The engineering aspect was not as simple as the Zhenru-Xianghua companies purchasing power from Zhabei. Therefore, it initially caused considerable concern. It was later decided to lay two underwater cables in the Huangpu River. A power supply contract was signed on January 16th of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], agreeing that the line construction would be completed and power supply would commence within one year from the contract's signing. The power supply period was tentatively set for five years from the date of energization. The power supply capacity for the first year was limited to 800 kilowatts, increasing by 300 kilowatts each subsequent year. The electricity price was set at 3.5 silver cents per kilowatt-hour. After the contract was signed, two 5,500-volt underwater cables were laid in the Huangpu River. One ran from the Shanghai Bund pier to the northwest end of the Pudong Coal Industry Public Warehouse, and the other ran from approximately 280 meters southwest of the Shanghai Arsenal to the northwest end of the Pudong China Wharf. The work was gradually completed around October of the 19th year of the Republic [1930]. A switch room was built on a rented piece of land behind the Coal Industry Public Warehouse. After the two cables came ashore, a dedicated 5,500-volt overhead line was specially installed, running through the switch room to the company's power plant in Zhangjiabang, where electricity meters were installed to calculate charges by kilowatt-hour. Power supply commenced on March 1st of the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. However, due to the China General Edison Company's boiler installation not yet being completed, it could not supply electricity to its full capacity. Therefore, only the Yangsi area was temporarily supplied with power from China General Edison Company, while the area north of Tangqiao continued to be supplied by the company's own power generation. It was expected that all areas could be fully supplied by China General Edison Company by the end of the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. As for the Wusong Baoming Electric Company, its urban area was a small power plant in the north. Its mechanical equipment, aside from one gas generator that had long been abandoned, included two diesel generators with a combined capacity of 287 kVA. However, one of them was converted from a gas engine, inevitably reducing its capacity. In the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the maximum load had reached 200 kilowatts, and without expanding equipment, it would soon be insufficient. With the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company constructing a power plant near Junsong Bridge on Jungong Road, very close to the company's business area, connecting power lines along Jungong Road was very convenient. Therefore, in May of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], the company was instructed to consult with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company on power purchase methods. After both parties reached an agreement through negotiation, a contract was signed on September 15th of the 19th year of the Republic [1930]. The power supply capacity was temporarily limited to 600 kilowatts, and the electricity price was also divided into basic fixed and variable portions. The basic portion was calculated at 3.1 taels of silver dollars per kilowatt of maximum power consumption per month, with appropriate adjustments based on the load factor. The variable portion was calculated at one silver cent per kilowatt-hour, with appropriate increases or decreases based on the amount of heat required per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated and the price of coal. After the contract was signed, a transformer substation was set up next to the Zhanghuabang Station on Jungong Road, serving as the point of entry for electricity from Zhabei. The company's entire electrical wiring within its business area was also thoroughly renovated due to the power supply. Subsequently, the Zhabei New Power Plant was completed and began generating electricity in December of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], and the company's aforementioned projects were also gradually completed. Therefore, starting from May 1st of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], power was supplied by Zhabei. The first step in the Bureau's plan to unify Shanghai's power plants was to stop power generation by small power plants and concentrate the city's power generation in the two major power plants in Zhabei and China General Edison Company. Currently, the Zhenru-Xianghua and Baoming companies have successively implemented purchasing power from Zhabei, and the Pudong Company has implemented purchasing power from China General Edison Company. The first step in the plan to unify power plants has been fully completed.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat Registration Deadline at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, upon receiving a telegram from the Ministry of Industry ordering the registration of all fishing boats, with a deadline of June 30th, issued a special announcement yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of this announcement, according to the Ministry of Industry's telegram, in accordance with Article 48 of the Fisheries Law and Article 39 of its Implementing Regulations, those who obtained fishing rights before the implementation of this law should apply for registration in accordance with the law within one year after the implementation of this law, otherwise they will be deemed to have abandoned their business. The deadline is June 30th of this year. In addition to telegraphing the Ministries of Transportation and Finance to instruct the Customs to strictly enforce the law within the prescribed time limit, we hereby instruct the Bureau to issue a public announcement and publish it in the local newspapers, ensuring that all fishing boats register within the time limit to protect their fishing rights and avoid detention." Upon receiving this, after reviewing the old and new fisheries, it is imperative to apply for registration in accordance with the law. This Bureau has repeatedly ordered compliance in the past. Now, in accordance with the aforementioned instructions, in addition to issuing separate orders, we hereby issue this urgent announcement, urging all fishermen in this city to be fully informed and diligent in complying.</p>
<h3>Three Ship Captains Appointed by the Fisheries Administration Bureau</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, Director Han of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration Bureau has worked diligently. Yesterday, he appointed Yang Yue'an as captain of the Fuhai warship, Wang Zhikui as captain of the Biaohai warship. It is also heard that the budget for each warship is set at over 2,400 yuan per month for recurring expenses.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Labor-Management Negotiations Yield No Results</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of female workers in silk factories in this port requesting the restoration of wages, the Zhabei District Second, Fourth, and Special Zone Silk Filature Industry Unions jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Silk Factories Guild. During the joint labor-management meeting, the management side proposed increasing wages from 51 cents to 57 cents in accordance with the Wuxi method, while the labor side demanded that the original wage of 60 cents be restored from June 1st, in accordance with the agreement signed by both labor and management during last year's wage reduction, at the expiration of the agreed-upon term. Subsequently, the labor representatives agreed to wait until a general meeting of all female worker representatives was convened to make a decision based on public opinion. The day before yesterday, over twenty silk filature female worker representatives from the Second, Fourth, and Special Zones held a discussion meeting at the Fourth Zone Union in Zhabei. After discussion, the consensus was firm that they would not stop until the goal of restoring the original wage was achieved. Yesterday, labor representative Yuan Yunlong visited Chairman Shen of the Silk Factories Guild again for negotiations, but no results were achieved. It is planned to request mediation from the Social Affairs Bureau again. Civic Training Council.</p>
<h3>Approval for Shipping Staff to Form a Mutual Aid Association</h3>
<p>Senior shipping staff in this port, including Zhu Ruiqing, Qiu Ruzhang, Pan Maosheng, Shao Husheng, Chen Yong, Fan Chengzhang, Wu Mengyin, Cai Zhongjie, Zhu Huanqing, and over fifty others, previously initiated the organization of the Shanghai Chinese Shipping Mutual Aid Association for the purpose of connecting the emotions of senior staff on various ships and implementing mutual aid. They submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters Civic Training Council for approval. After receiving the submission, the Civic Training Council sent personnel to investigate and determined that it was appropriate to allow the organization. Yesterday, it issued a permission certificate No. 35, ordering the initiators to comply with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Merit Forest Organizes Scripture Reading Room</h3>

<p>Crossing the Pacific</p>
<h3>Adventurous Boat Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>From Vancouver</p>
<p>The "Great Beauty Evening News" reported that yesterday (the 19th), an adventurous small boat arrived in the Huangpu River. With a gross tonnage of 258 tons and a crew of eleven, it crossed the turbulent Pacific Ocean, sailing for 28 days from Vancouver to Shanghai. When it moored in the Huangpu River, only one barrel of diesel fuel remained. Had it arrived several hours later, it would have been stranded at sea due to running out of fuel. The boat is named "Chautsena." Although its appearance now resembles a small fishing boat, it was once a maritime palace for British nobles forty years ago, and later a yacht for famous actors. It has sailed the Mediterranean and North Seas countless times. Fifty-one years ago today was the day the boat was launched. Its owner, the Marquess of Anglesey, named it "Suemai." It is said that the Marquess was a favorite of the Victorian court, doting on a London socialite. This boat was specially built for that woman to accompany him on maritime tours. Therefore, its construction was solid and its equipment magnificent, unparalleled in its time. It is said that on one occasion, the Marquess invited several friends to go on a sea tour, accompanied by the woman. Just before departure, the Marquess went ashore for business, and the boat departed as usual. Unexpectedly, it disappeared for three years without a trace. It was finally found after much searching, but the owner was nowhere to be found. It was then sold to the actress Lang Drai, who often used it for tours of the Riviera in the Mediterranean. After the actress died of illness, it was acquired by the Vancouver United Company and used as a ferry between Vancouver and Powell Island for twenty years. Currently, the equipment in the boat is completely different from its original appearance. Only a few windows, resplendent and luxurious, are remnants of fifty years ago. Secondly, there is the engine and a portion of the wheelhouse. According to the crew's opinions, it is a relic of the past. The boat's arrival in Shanghai has no fixed purpose. In the future, it may go to Southeast Asia or Mexico. It is difficult to predict, as its sole purpose is to trade goods for profit.</p>

<h3>Chongdao Hall Extorting Money with Fake Spirits and Ghosts</h3>
<p>If the Old Master is So Powerful, Why Doesn't He Move the Police?</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking is Indeed Psychological Therapy</p>
<p>Repeated Collection of Funds, the Purpose is Probably Nothing More Than Extorting Money</p>
<p>Yang Changguo and Cao Chunhua, from Jiangbei, established the Shanghai Hugujunying Branch of the Nanjing Chongdao Hall at No. 9 Nanjing Street. They used the pretense of spirit possession to treat people and extort money. Many ignorant men and women went there. Police Chief Zhu Lianfa of the responsible First District First Precinct discovered this. The day before yesterday, he went to the address and arrested Cao Chunhua, bringing him back to the precinct. During the preliminary hearing, Cao stated that he was 48 years old and that they had never been able to treat people, but relied on the secret assistance of the Old Master to relieve the people of all disasters and eliminate all kinds of strange diseases and demons, especially in quitting smoking. Anyone addicted to smoking would come to their place, first kneel and bow to the gods, then drink a cup of tea, and then have their qi circulated to expel the turbid air accumulated in their chests. They would then be asked to move around for a while, and they would inevitably vomit, as all the dirt in their chest and abdomen would be vomited out. Then, they would be asked to sit quietly, and after 48 hours, the addicts would completely lose their addiction. If they still thought about smoking afterwards, they could come to their altar. They would be given special treatment, provided with meals, and no money would be taken. They would only be allowed to donate incense money as they pleased. The money obtained from their altar would be placed in bamboo tubes. At the end of each year, the contents would be emptied and the total amount calculated. After deducting expenses, the rest would be submitted to the Nanjing General Altar for charitable purposes. They were charged with spreading rumors to confuse the public, extorting money for personal gain, and using spirit possession to treat people, which violated police regulations. They were ordered to remain in custody pending verification.</p>

<h3>Postal Headquarters Building Large Warehouse</h3>

<p>Huining Native Place Association</p>
<h3>Pleading for the Disaster Victims of Jingdezhen and Huizhou</h3>
<p>Submitting Three Requests to the National Government</p>
<p>The Huining Native Place Association in Shanghai submitted a request to the National Government regarding the post-disaster issues of the disaster victims of Jingdezhen and Huizhou: "Regarding the request to designate troops to protect merchants and travelers, establish national banks, and restore the market in order to seek post-disaster recovery and pacify the people, this association has received a letter from the Jingdezhen Huizhou Merchants Bandit Disaster Relief Committee, stating that since last year, Jingdezhen has been ravaged three times by the Red Bandits, occupied for five months, subjected to rape, looting, extortion, and arson. The devastation was even worse than the Taiping Rebellion. Jingdezhen is located in northern Jiangxi and borders our Huining counties, making it the only gateway in southern Anhui. Therefore, the number of Huizhou people living there is the largest, and the number of merchants doing business there is also the most. Unexpectedly, after the Red Bandits occupied the town, they promoted communist heresies, treating the Huizhou people even more cruelly than the other locals. What crime did the Huizhou people commit to suffer such a catastrophe? Fortunately, the National Army finally settled the situation, and the disaster victims gradually returned. However, nine out of ten houses were empty, and there was no way to make a living. Starvation and cold drove them to despair, huddling together in misery. The once-prosperous Huizhou merchants were now a picture of desolation and terror. The Huizhou people in Jingdezhen today are on the verge of death and are about to give up. However, there is still hope for recovery. It is necessary to take immediate action to save them. After repeated discussions, three measures have been proposed and requested to be forwarded to the Central Government for approval: (1) Jingdezhen has a large number of porcelain workers, but they have limited knowledge and are easily swayed by the bandits, becoming their accomplices. After the bandits leave, they are also prone to causing disturbances. Moreover, they also harbor resentment towards the Huizhou people. If there is no permanent military presence, not only will the lives and property of the Huizhou people be at risk, but the security of Huining will also be greatly affected. Therefore, it is necessary to request the Central Government to designate troops to be permanently stationed to maintain order and ensure the safety of Huining. (2) Jingdezhen has suffered three bandit disasters, and the Huizhou merchants have suffered the greatest losses. All financial assets and goods have been swept away, and the entire town is at a standstill. Even if there is a forced recovery, it will only be a facade and will inevitably lead to complete collapse. To seek fundamental relief, it is necessary to inject sufficient financial resources. Therefore, it is necessary to request the Central Government to establish national banks to replenish the market and restore commerce. (3) Tens of thousands of Huizhou merchants and unemployed workers are starving and freezing, living in despair. Cries of hunger and desolation are everywhere. It is necessary to request fellow native place associations in various ports to generously donate and widely solicit donations to achieve the effect of relief and allow them to survive. In summary, these three measures are the urgent requests of all Huizhou people in Jingdezhen. We hope that you will be mindful of the disaster victims and solicit donations for relief. Regarding the two items of designating troops and establishing banks, we earnestly request that you forward them to the Central Government for approval so that your word can carry weight and the results will be significant. The disaster victims of the entire town will be eternally grateful. According to this, the two items of stationing troops and establishing banks are the only good measures for post-disaster relief that benefit merchants and protect the people. We hereby submit this document with the facts and request your approval for prompt implementation to protect merchants and travelers and reassure the people. We are anxiously awaiting your orders."</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Chunyuan Sorghum Sells Well in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Xuzhou is a place that produces Sorghum. Every time the green gauze tents rise and the green rice waves, the red ears sway, and the villains often use it to hide. The abundance is known, and the people of Xu take it and brew it into sorghum liquor, which is thick and mellow, strong and fierce, and delicious to drink. It is a famous product of Xu and has been famous throughout the country since ancient times. In recent years, it has been distributed in Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Nanjing and other places, but Shanghai is still lacking. Tongju Liquor Store is the only large distillery in Xu, with branches all over the place. Now, a third distillery has been specially added to Shanghai, where Chinese and Western cultures meet, at No. 79 Xinyong'an Street in the French Concession, to promote it. It was opened for business on the 17th of this month, and the doors were crowded. The welcome of the people of Shanghai can be seen. Its quality is dense and pure, neither diluted with water like inferior goods, nor mixed with fake wine by those who are greedy for profit, which is harmful to the body and mind. It is predicted that sorghum liquor will be sold in Shanghai in the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs and Public Safety Bureaus' takeover of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce and establishment of branch offices has already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that at 10:00 AM yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau dispatched representative Hu Yuqi, the Public Safety Bureau representative Jin Zhongjian, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce representative Luo Qinghua, to Wusong by car. They first contacted the Eighth District Party Headquarters, and then went directly to the Public Safety Seventh District. Since the Wusong Chamber of Commerce was located within the jurisdiction of the Seventh District, Director Zhang of the district accompanied them to the meeting. The standing committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Zengjie and Zheng Shushan, received them. Representative Hu presented the takeover document for the two committee members to review. Committee Member Zheng replied that the Chamber of Commerce had previously received an instruction from the Ministry of Industry stating that the Chamber's request to continue its existence was not without reason, and that further review was pending. Therefore, regarding the takeover, it would be best to wait a while. After the Social Affairs Bureau representative read the Ministry of Industry's instruction, he replied that since there was such a situation, it was necessary to ask the bureau director for instructions. At about 1:00 PM, the situation was reported to Director Pan by long-distance telephone. Director Pan then sent a telegram instructing the Chamber of Commerce to temporarily hand over the seals and files to the bureau for safekeeping, pending a reply from the ministry, before further review. Representative Hu then informed the Chamber of Commerce of the situation. Committee Members Zheng and Zhang complied and handed over one seal that read "Seal of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce of Baoshan County, Jiangsu" and one small seal that read "Wusong Chamber of Commerce." Representative Hu accepted them. In addition, public documents and files were divided into three large packages, sealed, and affixed with seals, signed jointly by Social Affairs Bureau representative Hu Yuqi, Public Safety Bureau representative Jin Zhongjian, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce representative Luo Qinghua, and Wusong Chamber of Commerce representatives Zhang Zengjie and Zheng Shushan, to show their solemnity. After signing, they were handed over to Luo Qinghua for inventory and taken back to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for temporary safekeeping. As for whether the Chamber of Commerce should continue to exist or be changed into a branch office, it would have to wait for the ministry's reply before further review. In addition, the Chamber of Commerce has three large cabinets of historical documents and account books, which were sealed by the Social Affairs Bureau in the Chamber of Commerce. The transfer of property and equipment was also completed, and they returned to Shanghai by car. Later, Wusong merchants were greatly shocked when they heard the news because it happened suddenly.

<h3>Two Groups Oppose the Anti-Opium Bureau</h3>
<p>Anti-Drug Association: The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association recently stated that the establishment of the Anti-Opium Bureau by the Ministry of Finance, implementing a method of prohibition through taxation, and the establishment of bureaus in various provinces to collect taxes, while the two-percent opium surtax, which the people have been calling for over a year, continues to exist, clearly contradicts the current anti-opium law and violates the Hague Anti-Opium Convention, the Kuomintang party platform, and Premier Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug legacy. It is recognized outside that such measures are tantamount to a disguised public sale, similar to Wu Liande's public sale proposal, and criticisms have arisen. Anti-drug organizations and local party headquarters are sending messages expressing their opposition. Serious advocacy is increasing daily. It can be seen where public opinion lies. The association is currently based on its arguments over the years and the unanimous demands of local anti-drug groups, requesting the central government to correct these methods to maintain international credibility and comfort the people's hope. According to the association, the association supports any anti-opium measures that do not contradict Premier Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug legacy. Any anti-opium measures that violate Premier Sun's legacy are opposed. Also, those outside who do not know the contents of Premier Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug legacy are asking the association for copies. The association has prepared an additional 10,000 posters of Premier Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug legacy and 100,000 copies of the full text of Premier Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug legacy. All levels of party headquarters, mass organizations, schools, and church groups can send an official letter to the association requesting copies. Five copies will be given free of charge to promote it, it is said.</p>
<p>Women's Temperance Association: The Chinese Women's Temperance Association, in view of the harm of opium to China, has been very active in the anti-drug movement for several years. Recently, the Ministry of Finance established the Anti-Opium Bureau, suspected of adopting a method of strict prohibition through taxation. The association absolutely opposes the above method and issued a declaration yesterday, with very strong wording, it is said.</p>

<h3>National Products Mall Submitted Conditions Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reopening After Seven Conditions Are Resolved</p>
<p>Employees Were Still Arrested Yesterday and Released Immediately</p>
<p>The National Products Mall has been ordered to close by the Public Works Department for eleven days and has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, the mall's negotiation committee met and decided to submit seven conditions to the Public Works Department, and will reopen after they are resolved. The Public Works Department is scheduled to reply in writing on the 22nd. The conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>Continued Negotiations On the 19th, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened talks between the two sides. Because it was late, the Public Works Department representative requested a postponement for further discussion. It was decided that continued reporting would take place at 3:00 PM yesterday. PWD Chief Inspector Mao Ding, West Director Brown, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Liden, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiyi, and Chinese National Products Mall representatives Hong Yanbin, Ren Jinpin, Zhu Zhenhan then began the discussion. Chief Inspector Brown began by describing the Public Works Department's equipment issues for the National Products Mall. The chairman then asked a number of questions, asking for clarification. Brown then said that the engineering department would reduce the minimum requirements for the National Products Mall's equipment and would provide a written list of responses on Monday. Then, the National Products Mall representative declared to the chairman that the crux of the case now lay in the issue of responsibility for the June 9th incident. If the issue of responsibility is not determined, then nothing can be discussed. This must be solemnly declared.</p>
<p>Negotiation Committee The National Products Mall Negotiation Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Zhang Zilian. Regarding the Public Works Department's illegal blockade of the mall and order to cease operations, it was resolved that (1) matters concerning violation of the agreement and infringement of legal rights will be handled by the government; (2) regarding its own issues, it will submit seven conditions to the Public Works Department; (3) regarding the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's continued negotiations at 3:00 PM, it will send Hong Yanbin, Ren Jinpin, and Zhu Zhenhan to attend.</p>
<p>Submitted Conditions The National Products Mall Negotiation Committee submitted a total of seven conditions to the Public Works Department: (1) The Public Works Department apologizes to the Chinese government, the national populace, and the mall, and publishes the apology in Chinese and Western newspapers; (2) Punish the responsible personnel who closed the mall and beat the employees; (3) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur to all residents of the concession in the future; (4) The Public Works Department shall not interfere with the organization of all national products malls in the concession and the promotion of national goods; (5) The provisions regarding the issuance of permits and inspection of Chinese civil construction and hygiene and fire prevention equipment in the Land Regulations and Public Works Department By-laws should be amended immediately for the following purposes: (A) Residents must have the right to appeal when they deem the Public Works Department's disposition to be inappropriate or unacceptable; (B) Establish a review body for reviewing the issuance of licenses and hygiene and fire prevention equipment; (C) The upper-level body must be composed of Chinese personnel organized by the Shanghai Municipal Government-appointed Chinese taxpayers' association; (D) Any for-profit or non-profit organization set up for residents shall not be subjected to suspension or closure without prior judgment by a Chinese court; (6) Compensation for the loss of the entire mall; (7) After all the above conditions have been completely resolved, the responsible personnel of the Public Works Department shall personally open the door. The opening method and time shall be determined separately by the mall.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhenhan's Talk Yesterday at 6:00 PM, reporters from various newspapers spoke with Mr. Zhu Zhenhan, a member of the mall's negotiation committee. Mr. Zhu said that it was unfortunate that the mall was illegally closed by the Public Works Department on June 9. Although Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing mediated and convened talks at the Chamber of Commerce, both sides reported on the mall's renovations and layout. He believed that this was not a fundamental solution. In his opinion, this matter should clarify the responsibility for the illegal closure on June 9, and then the secondary issue of renovation can be discussed. But in studying the renovation, the various regulations set by the Public Works Department, such as the fire brigade, the engineering department, the health department, and the police, are one-sided by the Public Works Department, and whether they are proper is a very large question. This question should be noted not only by the Chinese directors in the bureau, but also by all our citizens, to study whether they are proper. Therefore, at the meeting, after the Public Works Department finished reporting, West Director Brown said that the mall and entertainment venue could be opened tomorrow if they wanted to. This was rejected, saying that the mall could not be opened until the responsibility was clarified and public and private matters were resolved.</p>
<p>Employee Arrests and Releases In order to make the public understand the truth about being ordered to close by the Public Works Department, the National Products Mall Negotiation Committee dispatched personnel to distribute the National Products Mall Daily. Yesterday at 4:50 PM, employee Zhang Hanchen was arrested by Western officers from the New Gate Police Station while distributing promotional materials on Nanjing Road, and was released shortly afterward. At 6:20 PM, employee Hu Zhentao was also arrested by Western officers from the New Gate Police Station. It was reported that he was also released that night.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Instruction The Ministry of Industry issued an instruction to the National Products Mall yesterday: "It is learned that the mall reported the circumstances of its closure, requesting a review and prompt negotiations to save the merchants and maintain national goods. This case was previously referred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to file a protest and conduct serious negotiations. Now, according to the detailed report, it has been referred again to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for handling. Please be informed of this instruction."</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Reply The Secretariat of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters sent a letter to the National Products Mall yesterday: "Respected sirs, it is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Government's letter No. 2896 stated, 'It is learned that your secretariat's letter No. 2681 regarding the Public Concession Police's closure of the United Chinese National Products Mall was copied and sent for review and reply.' It is learned that this case has been repeatedly petitioned by the mall to request negotiations and prevent the matter from reaching the government. The Public Concession Council unilaterally ordered the closure due to the licensing issue of the mall's attached entertainment section and closed it. The prior failure to request the court's permission and rash execution was a fundamental error, which not only hinders our national legal rights, but also violates the agreement of the Shanghai Public Concession Special District Court. The Secretariat of this government has been ordered to send a letter to protest the Public Concession Council. You are hereby informed and hope you will take note."</p>
<p>Citizens' Assembly The first branch of the Citizens' Federation convened a citizens' assembly at 2:00 PM yesterday, attended by over 100 representatives from the Citizens' General Association, Samsung Factory, Sanyou Company, Guanshengyuan, Lao Jiuzhang, etc. Zhou Jucun was elected chairman and Ni Jilian recorded. First, the chairman reported the reason for the meeting, followed by Zhang Zilian's report on the circumstances of being ordered to close by the Public Works Department. Zhang Yichen of the Municipal General Association then gave guidance, and the discussion and proposals immediately followed. The proposal that the Citizens' Assembly member National Products Mall was illegally closed by the Public Works Department, how should it be corrected, prevent the Public Works Department from having any further illegal incidents in the future, and resolve the citizens' pain was resolved as follows: (1) Send a letter to the General Assembly to unite various organizations and convene a city-wide citizens' assembly; (2) Representatives will be elected by the city-wide citizens' assembly to petition in Beijing; (3) Negotiate by telecommunications; (4) Suggest that the General Assembly discuss the recovery of the concession using effective methods at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Wang Yansong Talks About the Native Bank Law</h3>
<p>Still Hopeful That the Government Can Adopt It</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Native Bank Law, the city's Native Bank Association still needs to convene a committee meeting to discuss the reasons for continuing the petition and request the government to enact it. The reporter from New Sound Newspaper had previously submitted a proposal to the National Assembly by the Native Bank Association. After Mr. Wang Yansong, who attended as a representative, explained the reasons to various parties in Beijing, the result was satisfactory. Therefore, Mr. Wang must be very concerned about this matter. Therefore, he visited Mr. Wang yesterday and asked for his opinion. According to his reply, when he attended the National Assembly, the Native Bank did have this proposal. At that time, he believed that if this case was observed from Shanghai, it would be a problem for a part of Shanghai, but native banks were everywhere in the provinces, cities, counties, and towns across the country, and were related to commerce and agriculture. Therefore, observed from another perspective, it was a national economic issue, so it was possible to submit it to the National Assembly. However, after he arrived in Beijing, he felt that the National Assembly's discussion was focused on the provisional constitution, and there were many other proposals for unification and construction. In addition, the meeting period was urgent, and he was afraid that if the Native Bank Law was proposed, there might not be time to discuss it. Therefore, he separately explained to the Central Party Headquarters, Legislative Yuan President Shao, and various committee members that it was necessary to separately legislate the Native Bank Law and asked for its adoption. At that time, the Central Party Headquarters and President Shao believed that it had research value and agreed to consider it. He believed that since this matter had hope of achieving its goal, there was no need to submit it to the National Assembly again. Afterwards, he returned to Shanghai and saw in the newspaper that the Native Bank Law had been passed by the Legislative Yuan meeting and handed over to the Commercial Law Committee for drafting. He was hoping that it would be enacted and implemented as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, he later saw Mr. Ma Yinchu's opinion, believing that there was no need to separately legislate the Native Bank Law. The starting point of his advocacy was still the position of the bank. In fact, banks in China today are still in their infancy and cannot meet the needs of economic circulation in agriculture and commerce. Moreover, the nature of native banks is different from that of banks. Mr. Qin Runqing, the leader of the native bank industry, explained it in detail. Therefore, he very much hopes that the government will adopt it when the industry continues to request it, that is, legislate it separately, so as not to force the native bank industry to use the Banking Law and suffer the pain of cutting its feet to fit the shoes. To the best of his ability, he is still willing to support it in order to achieve its goal, he said.</p>

<h3>Death of Chu Minyi's Father</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Chu Minyi was previously dispatched by the Central Government to Xinjiang to inspect Party affairs. Simultaneously, he was also recommended by the Chinese Academic Association as the leader of the Chinese contingent of the Sino-French Academic Investigation Group. He departed last month and is currently on a long journey. Unexpectedly, his respected father, Mr. Xing Tian, passed away at his native Nanzun at 5 AM on the 19th (the day before yesterday), at the age of 77. Mr. Chu is not in Shanghai, so his wife has rushed to handle the funeral arrangements. A telegram has also been sent to the French Embassy in Beijing, forwarding it to the Sino-French Academic Investigation Group, urging Mr. Chu to return home as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Request for Tax Exemption on Sand Cloth and Native Cloth</h3>
<p>Document Submitted to the Central Government</p>
<p>The Sand Cloth and Native Cloth Trade Association of this city yesterday submitted separate requests to the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Consolidated Tax Bureau, requesting a clear order to the entire country to refer to established cases and grant tax exemptions. The original submission stated: "Regarding the matter of native cloth tax exemption, we request that the Ministry of Finance issue an order to the National Consolidated Tax Bureau and the Customs Administration to refer to the resolution of the National Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China and issue a clear order to the entire country to grant tax exemptions, in order to maintain commerce and broaden the people's livelihood. It is noted that our fellow native cloth traders in Shanghai transport and sell handwoven native cloth for export. The National Government has long issued a clear order for tax exemption nationwide. This year, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau was established, adopting a one-item-one-tax system. An order was issued to levy taxes based on tax regulations. A request was made on behalf of the poor and impoverished people of the country to exempt them from tariffs. On May 19th of the 20th year, the Ministry of Finance approved the exemption, and the Customs Administration issued an order to all customs houses to exempt export taxes. It has been found that most of the native cloth produced in Jiangsu, transshipped through Shanghai, and exported to other provinces is for the needs of the people of eastern provinces. Yingkou is a transshipment area. The people of the north are more frugal than those in the south and have a high degree of patriotism. They regard this Jiangsu-produced native cloth as an extremely important item, valued for its durable material. In the past 20 years, although imported cloth from overseas is far inferior in material durability to domestic goods, its price is lower than that of domestic goods. Native cloth has suffered a severe blow from this, facing a state of decline. Fortunately, the National Government issued an order for tax exemption, and the people promoted domestic goods. Cooperation between officials and the people served as an invisible force to resist foreign goods, in an attempt to remedy the situation. It can be seen that tax reduction and exemption, and the promotion of domestic goods, are essential factors in awakening the people's hearts, especially concerning the southern industry. If overseas cloth expands its sales channels, directly absorbing the money of the eastern provinces, it will endanger the livelihood of the poor people of Jiangsu Province, harming both sides. It is almost too late. Recently, a letter from Zhu Limen, a merchant in Yingkou, stated that the merchants and people of the northern provinces, knowing that tariffs have been exempted, cannot bear any further burdens on this native cloth. Goods transported from the southern provinces have been stopped from being unloaded, affecting silver reserves and the market, with some even advocating suspending transportation at the expense of business. They have called for assistance from fellow traders in Shanghai. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has sent a telegram to the government of the eastern provinces and the Department of Finance, requesting that the authorities consider the poor people of both supply and demand sides, who are happy to promote domestic goods, and appreciate their patriotic enthusiasm. Based on the principle that taxes are collected from factories and based on the yarn, this native cloth is a type of cotton fabric, within the scope of the consolidated tax regulations for cotton yarn. According to the national tax interpretation of one item, one tax, it is a cotton product directly woven from cotton yarn that has already been subjected to consolidated tax. It should be allowed to be sold without further taxation, except for business tax, which is a local tax revenue. It seems impossible to levy it again. We dare to express our opinions in detail, hoping that the government will uphold the National Government's goal of saving the country and the people, and consider the unemployment of the poor. An uneasy silence, we dare to lay it out. Humbly beseeching consideration and approval, recognizing that the rights and interests lost after tax exemption are not a small matter, allowing for the issuance of a clear order to the national tax collection agencies to maintain the established case, which will truly benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood."</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants to Establish Large Yarn Factory in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Capital of 5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry is strongly encouraging Japanese merchants to establish factories in China. Recently, Osaka Moaisho Factory is also establishing a spinning factory in Shanghai with a capital of 5 million Japanese yen. President Fumihira Hori has come to Shanghai to make preparations, consulting with Yasukawa of Mitsui &amp; Co. in Shanghai, Miyajima of Nichihua Spinning, and Funatsu of the Spinning Industry Association. Progress has been made, and preparations are being made for 120 spinning machines. The factory site will be the original site of Kangtai Factory. This matter is about to be realized.</p>
<h3>Condition of Japanese Spring Cocoons This Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Raw Silk Inspection Office yesterday received a report from Japan regarding the condition of spring cocoons this year, stating: "According to the results of the previous survey released by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the estimated production of spring cocoons in the 24 prefectures of the early group at the end of May is 1,383,265 dan, a decrease of 200,951 dan compared to the actual amount collected last year (a decrease of approximately 12%). However, in the Kanto region, where new cocoons have already entered the market, and in the Hokuriku region, which will gradually enter the market in the future, the government has ordered restrictions on the amount of silkworm eggs collected. At the same time, insufficient fertilizer application in the gardens and reduced leaf production will result in a decrease of more than 15% in the national spring cocoon harvest compared to last year."</p>
<h3>Book Industry Resolves to Increase Prices</h3>
<p>Effective July 1st</p>
<p>The case of the binding industry in this city requesting an increase in prices has been in dispute for a long time and has not yet been resolved. It is now heard that this case has been discussed in detail by the executive committee of the Book Industry Association. The previous labor unrest in the binding industry was caused by some binders underbidding for business and others paying low wages and recruiting many apprentices, leading to worker dissatisfaction and disputes. The association's investigation found that without a unified approach, those with little capital would bid lower, while those with more capital would bid higher, affecting both the livelihood of workers and hindering the printing and publishing business. For the sake of fairness and long-term stability, the following measures have been decided: A. Western binding: A single leaf of single-sided printing in Western binding is equivalent to half a page of traditional binding. In the past, there were few binding machines and few people who could make books, so the price was higher than traditional binding. The common price for binding works sold to the book industry was 7.5 to 8 jiao per 10,000 leaves, but some reduced it to 6.5 jiao, and some were as high as 9 jiao. Now, it is proposed to increase the price.</p>

<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>The authorities in Mannheim, Germany, seeing the prevalence of idlers in the city, came up with a funny way to crack down on them. They sent policemen with a large cart of chairs to patrol the streets. Whenever they saw idlers standing around on the street corners, they would take a chair from the cart and invite them to sit down. This caused onlookers to laugh, and the idlers would retreat in shame.</p>
<p>A large British railway company employs inspection specialists to thoroughly inspect everything used by the company. Their work is often comical, such as counting the number of bristles in a broom or picking out the cotton threads mixed in with a wool carpet. This kind of work is very tedious, but it is their job.</p>
<p>The number of married couples in the United States who do not have children is about four times higher in cities than in rural areas. It is said that this is an example of urban hygiene being inferior to that of the countryside.</p>
<p>A rubber company in Liverpool, England, employs two women. Whenever a new type of rubber shoe is made, the two of them wear them and walk back and forth to show customers. It is estimated that the two women walked about 12,000 miles in four years.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>I have been in Guangzhou for more than twenty days. Although the prosperous commerce is inferior to that of Shanghai and Hong Kong, it does not receive the slightest assistance from foreigners. It is entirely self-operated by Chinese people. Guangzhou can be truly proud of this.</p>
<p>"Eat in Guangzhou." Therefore, there are especially many restaurants and teahouses in Guangzhou. But Guangzhou people call eating a meal "drinking tea." Teahouses also sell meals. There are two kinds of eating. "Small eat" is only drinking tea and eating in the teahouse, costing at most four jiao, which is already enough. "Big eat" is a full table of dishes, which costs at least twenty or thirty yuan.</p>
<p>Everything is done in Hao dollars. There are only Guangdong double-jiao coins. The front side has a small portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The reverse side is double ears of rice. One dollar is five jiao. If Hong Kong dollars and silver dollars are used, then they must be converted according to market prices. In the current market, one Hong Kong dollar is worth about thirteen hao. One silver dollar is worth about eleven hao. If you go to Hong Kong, then only Hong Kong dollars and Hong Kong dimes are used in the market. Those who only have silver dollars must first exchange them for Hong Kong dollars before they can use them. Therefore, there are especially many exchange shops in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The most popular thing in Guangzhou is "midnight snack." This "midnight snack" is not the midnight snack that Shanghai people order in Guangdong restaurants in winter, which consists of a charcoal brazier and a few plates of raw fish. It is a casual name for a small snack. Some people even eat a twenty or thirty yuan banquet at eleven or twelve o'clock at night, also called a midnight snack. "Eat in Guangzhou" shows how important Guangzhou people consider "eating."</p>
<p>Guangzhou people not only value eating, but also value entertainment. After dinner at six o'clock and before the midnight snack comes on the market at eleven o'clock, they must watch a big opera (Cantonese opera) and Yinghua (movies). In Guangzhou, the most famous big theater is the "Haizhu Theater" on Changdi. Famous opera troupes consider it an honor to perform at the "Haizhu" if they come to Guangzhou. Jue Xiansheng of the Cantonese troupe (Xue Juexian, i.e., Zhang Fei in Shanghai), whose supporting actors include the Hua Dan Sao Yunlan and the Sheng actors Chen Jintang and Lin Kunshan (first-class Haizhu seats cost three yuan). Riyuexing, Renshou Nian, Mei Lanfang of the Beijing troupe, and the Meihua Dance Troupe have all performed here. The next best are the "Taiping Theater" (Zhang Huichong's magic has performed here) and the "Henan Theater." There are countless movie theaters. Recently, they are competing to install sound equipment. The ones that already have sound are "Zhonghua," "Xin Guomin," "Mofan," "Mingzhu," "Yonghan," and "Nanguan." The sound films shown are best at "Zhonghua," "Yonghan," and "Mingzhu." There are as many as eight silent movie theaters. Most of the films shown are domestic. Therefore, the business of sound movie theaters is even more genuine.</p>
<p>There are more than twenty newspapers in Guangzhou. The source of news, in addition to exclusive telegrams and investigations, often publishes materials from Shanghai and Hong Kong newspapers. The three with larger sales are "Guohua," "Minguo," and "Gongping." "Guohua" is well-organized. "Gongping" has an old mind. Sales are all around 10,000 copies. There are very few good materials in the supplements. Some supplements published an article transcribed from a Hong Kong</p>
<p>newspaper. Who knew that this article in the Hong Kong newspaper was transcribed from this talk. There are many, many jokes like this. The most prosperous market is on "Changdi." The next best are "Yonghan Road," "Xinxin Road," and "Xidi." Large hotels like "Dongya," "Zhongshan," "Xinya," and "Asia" are all on the two banks of Changxi. The night view is also the best on these two banks.</p>
<p>The only school for studying drama is "Guangdong Drama Institute," which is sponsored by the provincial government. The appointed director is Mr. Ouyang Yuqian. The teachers inside, such as Mr. Tang Huaiqiu, Yan Gongshang, and Hu Chunbing, are all very knowledgeable in drama. On June 1st, their first drama troupe was established. They performed at the Provincial Education Association for ten days. The programs performed included "Camellia," "Selling and Buying," "Married People," and "The Bear." I went to see it several times with my colleague Shi Shuming. Among the performing students, the best were Ms. Gao Weilan and Ms. Peng Guohua. The next best were Mr. Zhang Zhengfan, Mr. Li Chenfeng, Mr. Zhao Rulin, and Mr. Chen You. Ms. Qu Ai was also good. Mr. Lu Dun, because he could not get rid of the "martial" air during the performance, was ultimately inferior to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li. Otherwise, he would also be a performing talent.</p>
<h3>A Record of Wang Shizi's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jue</p>
<p>Wang Shizi of Jurong exhibited his latest works at the Ningbo Fellow Association. There are one hundred and fifty frames. Flowers, birds, insects, and fish are all beautiful. Generally speaking, what is most unmatched in Shizi's paintings are three points. For example, the wetness of the brush is able to restrain, the color is beautiful and unconventional, and the ink is light and spiritual. It is enough to show that the energy is full and the operation is miserable. The mood of the exhibition, such as the rose chicken, bean worm, double carp, willow emerald bird, and the lone egret in the sunset, is clear and far away. The creation of the carving column white dove and the willow swing is novel. The ink bird tree is vast and noble. Standing for thousands of years. In addition, the collections of Zhongding and Han Dynasty are linked together. The brushstrokes are vertical and horizontal. The ancient interest is full of fun. The painting is small. The elegance of the situation is also the choice of the time. The ancients called the talent of the eight buckets many. I also sigh that the art of Shizi is many.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on the Japanese Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Li Taoan</p>
<p>The center of the Japanese film industry is in Tokyo, especially in the Asakusa area of Asakusa Park. Almost all of them are movie theaters. The films that are shown there, except for their own country, are only those Western sound and silent films. There is still its power. Speaking of our Chinese films, it is simply not visible. This is not because Chinese films are not good or what. Really. They have a strong sense of patriotism and cannot bear to let their rights and interests flow out, so they will show films from other countries to destroy their original great cause. As for Western films, they can still maintain their lives, but it is related to the relationship between their overseas Chinese and the international status, forming a relative proportion.</p>
<p>However. The films they produce themselves implicitly suggest two different factions. One is dedicated to propaganda for the capitalist class. The other is the vanguard of the laboring class. As long as you look at the film, you can see the strong colors of each faction. Therefore, it can be said that their films do contain a huge role in terms of ideology.</p>
<p>Although Japan is a constitutional monarchy, the power of the common people is also very common. The price of seats in their movie theaters is probably only 50 Japanese sen. (Approximately equal to one yuan of national currency.) Upstairs and downstairs are completely the same. Arbitrary seating. Regardless of rank. Although this is one of their characteristics. However, due to the architectural relationship. So as long as you pay such a considerable price. No matter upstairs or downstairs. What you get is always the same joy.</p>
<p>Some people say. The development of the Japanese film industry is also inevitable. One is because their people's patriotism. And the heart of cherishing their own emerging industries is too heavy. The result should be like this. The second is due to the increase in the number of theaters opened throughout the country. In its own country. There is excess sales. Some are not affected by business. Also. The government and the public opinion side. They are all giving considerable help. And sympathetic encouragement. So that they can safely soar upwards. Striving to make progress forward. Is also a major reason.</p>
<h3>Gift to the Du Ancestral Hall</h3>
<p>— Jin Aishi</p>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng, a famous person in Shanghai, recently completed the opening ceremony of the ancestral hall built in Pudong. I admire Mr. Mengchang's style of loving the soldiers. I intend to use the couplet to show his virtues. The skill is not counted.</p>

<h3>Research on Famine Food (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu I Sheng</p>
<p>The fourth prescription says: Wash and steam sweet potatoes until half-dry. Mash them. Add glutinous rice porridge and mix like mud. Coat them on bamboo fences. The longer they are there, the stronger they become. They will not be infested with insects or damaged. If there is a famine, take a piece the size of a hand and cook it into a large pot of thin porridge. Eating it can withstand hunger. Or make them into brick shapes and build them into walls for future use. According to my research, sweet potatoes are probably red-hearted sweet potatoes. However, the scientific name is 非薯, while those called 薯 are 薯芋, which is taro. The Records of the Grand Historian by Zhuo Wenjun says, "Below Mount Min, there are野有蹲鴟, and one will not be hungry until death."野有蹲鴟 is taro. It is a description of its shape. However, the nutrients contained in taro are actually more than in 非薯. A comparison is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Item Name: 蛋白質 (Protein) 脂肪 (Fat) 澱粉 (Starch) 水分 (Water) Remarks</p>
<p>8.1 7.4 3.678 397.68 Fresh ones, four catties can抵 (compare) to one catty of rice, one catty of dried flour can compare to two catties of rice.</p>
<p>芋 (Taro) 165.072 107.82 456.x Fresh ones, one catty four ounces can compare to one catty of rice, one catty of dried flour can compare to four and a half catties of rice.</p>
<p>As the above comparison shows, the effect of taro flour is actually stronger than that of 非薯 flour. The sweet potatoes used in the fourth prescription refer to taro. There are originally two types of taro, red and white. The white ones have thin skins and are white. They are used as vegetables. The red ones have thick, hairy skins with a light purple color. These are hairy taro. Both of these are sold by stalls in Hangzhou to provide food for laborers. The former is called baked sweet potatoes, and the latter is called taro. Their prices are very low. Looking at the above, it is known that the famine relief methods recorded in "Yan Fang Xin Bian" are not absurd and can be used in practice. During the famine relief period, those who are interested can pay attention to this. However, it is easy for the hungry to choke if they eat too much. It is up to the authorities to give good advice and impose restrictions to avoid abuses. "Yan Fang Xin Bian" also explains this in detail.</p>

<h3>Three Eras (12)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(6) Commander Zhang Revisits the Old Place</p>
<p>After Zhang Xiaosan left Beijing, he traveled east, west, north, and south, fighting many battles. Each time he fought, Zhang Xiaosan was promoted one step at a time. He was promoted to company commander. Suddenly, after a rebellion, he was promoted to regimental commander. After becoming a regimental commander, after a rebellion, he was promoted to division commander. After becoming a division commander, he became much freer. At this time, their inspector was stationed in Beijing. Zhang Xiaosan came to Beijing to ask for instructions. He actually came back as an official. After returning, he borrowed a house from a friend to live in. He borrowed a big house on Nongshangbu Street. When he took the car to see the new house, it was extremely coincidental. It was the big red door where he used to sing sour plum soup. For many years, he had been watching the people living in it. That kind of rich energy was really annoying. But now it seems that it cannot be considered annoying. If you have money, you should not live in a good house, but in a broken house. On the same day, Zhang Xiaosan looked at the house and thought it was satisfactory. He moved in. Then, the two concubines he had acquired in other provinces also came. The police district nearby, in order to protect the national defender, temporarily added a police post at the gate of Commander Zhang's mansion. Whether Zhang Xiaosan went out early in the morning or came back late at night, even in strong winds and heavy rains, he always saw a policeman standing outside the door. Moreover, he would respectfully salute. He thought, "People have earned me a lot of money." He really felt a little uneasy. Therefore, he wanted to reward him with some money. But he did not say it. At this time, Zhang Xiaosan did not hate the police. He felt that he relied on the police for help in many places. It was just that his wife thought that he would not become an official. At this time, he had to find her and let her see. For this reason, he took the car to the original compound to take a look. The residents, seeing a military officer with four box-carrying guards walking in, shrank into their houses and did not dare to come out. Zhang Xiaosan stood in the courtyard and explained the origin in detail. Then, an old shoe cobbler first peered through the window and saw clearly. Then, he came out, standing more than ten feet away from Zhang Xiaosan, squatted down and smiled and squatted at him. He laughed. "I didn't expect it. Zhang is a commander. The neighbors have all moved away. Only my family is old. Zhang Commander. You still remember the old neighbors. Really good. My Zhang Lord." Zhang Xiaosan said, "Do you know where my wife went from before? I... I want to see her." The shoe cobbler said, "Zhang Commander. What are you planning to do?" Zhang Xiaosan said, "I wow. Hmph." The shoe maker said, "We haven't seen him for two years. Do you think he can still come here? Sir. Have a bowl of water." Zhang Xiaosan was polite and sent the old shoe cobbler twenty yuan. He left.</p>

<h3>About the Public Performance of "Stormy Wind and Rain"</h3>
<p>Letter from Mr. Gu Jianchen</p>
<p>To Brother Yingpeng,</p>
<p>This is our second report on the performance of our plays. The first was "A Patriotic Heart" by Xiong Fuxi, which achieved great success in Zhenjiang and Wuxi. Now, this second report concerns the performance of "Stormy Wind and Rain."</p>
<p>The 13th and 14th of this month were the dates for the third achievement exhibition of our Jiangsu Provincial College of Education, divided into static exhibitions and dynamic performances. Naturally, the public performance of a play belongs to the dynamic achievements. As I direct the drama here, this responsibility naturally falls on me. When we started preparing the script, everyone wanted to see a famous play and perform "Lady Windermere's Fan." However, difficulties arose due to casting and costume issues, and selecting a play almost became a problem. I can barely write a few scripts myself, but because my learning is insufficient, I always find them superficial and childish. I originally didn't plan to use my own play as a script. However, many good friends encouraged me this time, complimenting me as the Tian Han of the College of Education, saying that Tian Han can write and perform his own plays. So, I had to shamelessly try to imitate Tian Han. Fortunately, after the performance of "The Unfinished Tombstone," people have a considerable understanding of theatrical techniques, so I dared to boldly put "Stormy Wind and Rain" into rehearsal. This script depicts a national movement arising from the interactions of China, Korea, and Japan. It has three acts in total. A brief explanation is as follows:</p>
<p>(Act One) In the evening, in the garden of the old bureaucrat Zhao Jingxiong's house in Qingdao, it depicts the beauty trap used by the Japanese to deliberately undermine the patriotic work of the Chinese people, and the failure of their attempt to bribe Zhao Jingxiong, as well as the successful theft of maps and plans for exploiting Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>(Act Two) The morning two days later, at the Liang family's residence, it depicts the successful Japanese plan to frame Yang Zhiqing. His fiancée, Miss Yongfen, forced by patriotic indignation, cancels their engagement.</p>
<p>(Act Three) This act takes place in a hospital ward.</p>
<p>Yang Zhiqing, due only to a minor oversight, is vilified as a traitor. As a result, he develops a heart ailment and is sent here for treatment. We see how the Japanese woman, Ono Umeko, suddenly transforms into a Korean and repents before being killed, how Miss Liang Yongfen reunites with Yang Zhiqing, and how he goes mad and commits suicide. All of this is made clear in this act.</p>
<p>The casting for this play is very appropriate. Introductions are as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Zhiqing…Chen Guoli</p>
<p>Ono Umeko…Ye Yunzhen</p>
<p>Zhao Gui…Huang Xie</p>
<p>Liu Guojun…Jin Fenggang</p>
<p>Zhao Yangxiuzhen…Chen Zuying</p>
<p>Zhao Jingxiong…Li Bingming</p>
<p>Xin Erlang…Tong Jingsan</p>
<p>Liang Zhong…Song Chengde</p>
<p>Liang Yongfen…Mao Jingzhen</p>
<p>Lin Cheng…Gu Chi</p>
<p>Liang Jingde…Hua Wuquei</p>
<p>Doctor Zhang…Xie Boming</p>
<p>Female Nurse…Zhang Zhenhua</p>
<p>The entire cast includes Tong Jingsan, Chen Zuying, and Chen Guoli, who are famous for their performances in "Blood Flowers," and Ye Yunzhen, who is famous for his performance in "A Patriotic Heart." All of them play important roles this time. Mao Jingzhen is also an outstanding talent among the female students, but she has never been on stage here before. This is her first time, and she is playing the main character. Her diligence, obedience, and talent have brought her great success.</p>
<p>The scenery and lighting have also been greatly improved. We made a new set and a garden backdrop. The other sets are modified from "Blood Flowers." Designed and supervised by drawing teacher Mr. Wu Shuyang, they are rich and beautiful. We know that lighting is the soul of drama, so we abolished the rigid footlights and overhead lights and used [whitespace] to control them. In this respect, the beauty of the play has indeed been greatly enhanced. For example, the sunset in Act One, with amber light projected from the left stage corner, makes the colors of the scenery particularly harmonious. The second scene of Act One is an evening scene, using blue light, and we also made a fake moon. This arrangement is said to be the first of its kind on the Wuxi stage. (Someone came and asked me what the moon was made of. I honestly replied that it was made from the small hat box of political science professor Mr. Chen Shoutong.) The only pity is that we didn't have [whitespace], so the sunset in Act One could not be fully realized. (The Shanghai Drama Association originally had two, and I went to Shanghai to borrow them from Mr. Ying Yunwei, but he said they were not repaired. Later, I wrote two letters to ask him, saying that it would be great to borrow them if possible, and if not, please write back. But he greatly disappointed me by not telling me a single word. He probably understands a bit of economics now and is reluctant to spend even four cents on postage.) In the future, we plan to make two ourselves, to avoid so much trouble borrowing from others.</p>
<p>After this public performance, many colleagues came to congratulate me on my success. I felt even more ashamed. As for the hard work of the staff, I should also report that to you. During the public performance, I stood entirely in the position of director, letting the students handle the stage work themselves. The stage management and lighting by Mr. Zeng Lu, the prop management by Mr. Gu Chi and Mr. Chen Tingsheng, and the scenery by Mr. Miao Jingyi, Mr. Zhou Shunyuan, Mr. Song Chengde, and Mr. Gu Defu were all much improved compared to the "Blood Flowers" era. In terms of makeup, several people were able to do it themselves. Miss Qin Xiangsun also learned makeup and helped me dress them up.</p>
<p>I sent you the script for "Stormy Wind and Rain" earlier. I hope you will combine "The Unfinished Tombstone," "Father's Daughter," and "Child of the Motherland" into a single volume. We will discuss other matters later. I wish you health.</p>

<h3>A Few Words After Watching "Mei Luoxiang"</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>The Central Public Drama Society's "Mei Luoxiang," which had been brewing for a long time, finally met us last Wednesday afternoon. This is truly a gratifying event. In particular, we respect Mr. Ouyang Xin's perseverance. His father had only died a few days before, and he was able to suppress his grief, so that this budding flower of art would not wither because of him.</p>
<p>The curtain opened, and scene after scene passed before our eyes. The plot is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Mei Luoxiang is a beautiful, young, and weak-willed actress. She has been living a life of luxury, dependent on a wealthy businessman, Bai Senqing. Later, she falls in love with a newspaper reporter, Ma Ziying. However, Ma Ziying is very poor and cannot achieve their desired goal for the time being. This forces him to leave her to develop his intended career.</p>
<p>After she and Ma Ziying become engaged, she behaves herself. On the one hand, she rejects Bai Senqing's material assistance, and on the other hand, she works hard to make a living on her own. This forces her to get closer to hardship day by day, and eventually, she cannot survive even after pawning all her clothes. Her friend, Xiao Chunlan, uses this opportunity to persuade her to return to Bai Senqing. She is moved by the sweet words. Then, Bai Senqing forces her to write a letter breaking off with Ziying. However, she did not do so. She burned the letter.</p>
<p>Soon, Ma Ziying returns, wealthy, to take her. Bai Senqing announces their past relationship and says that she has deceived two men at the same time. As a result, Ma Ziying and Bai Senqing both abandon her, causing her to eventually fall into depravity.</p>
<p>The best performance in the entire play goes to Ms. Wang Hualian, who plays Granny Gui. She can forget herself and merge with the character in the play. When she is reluctant to leave her mistress, Mei Luoxiang, she tells of her hardships. She cries, crying with tears and snot, and the muscles on her shoulders and back twitch involuntarily. Even more interesting is her Hefei dialect.</p>
<p>The second best performance goes to Mr. Ouyang Xin's Bai Senqing. He vividly brings a generous businessman to the stage. His dialogue is clear and loud, and his gestures are neither artificial nor unnatural. Although his facial expressions are not very attentive, he can be said to be a success.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Liangyi's Ma Ziying's dialogue is as stiff as a primary school student reciting a textbook. What is even more unsatisfactory is that face, smeared with the makeup of a young man from an old opera stage, and those two hands always stuck in his pockets. His facial expressions never changed at all. These things make the audience feel that he is just himself and has nothing to do with the play.</p>
<p>The lead role, Mei Luoxiang, is played by Ms. Zhang Zhaohe. Her shortcoming is that, from the opening to the closing, her hands are always crossed. When Ma Ziying returns successful, the plot should be tense. But our Miss Zhang always remains indifferent and does not show the slightest surprise.</p>
<p>In addition, Fan Zhen's Qin Jingtian is not an important role, and his performance is passable. Xiao Chunlan is more important. She is played by Ms. Zhu Qin, who is dignified, so her attitude is incompatible with the romantic Xiao Chunlan. In the dialogue persuading Mei Luoxiang, there is no action expression, and the voice is so low that it is indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Originally, art is not an easy thing to succeed in. The selection of the script must take into account the cast. If we can't find someone to play a romantic woman, we can choose another script. We must never be vague and compromise, leading to the failure of the entire play.</p>
<p>Going back to the topic, in this era of decline in Chinese art—especially drama—of course, we cannot expect to achieve satisfactory results with the first experience. What we need is the enthusiastic promotion of those who love art, so that the general public understands that drama is the education of the people, and concentrates their energy to irrigate the root of this art, so that it can blossom into brilliant flowers. Therefore, although this public performance is a failure in terms of artistic achievement, it has a very determined spirit in the entire drama movement. Like the director, Mr. Gu Zhongyi, for a month or two, he ran from Zhenru to Baotaiwan regardless of wind or rain. And all the actors sacrificed their precious time to rehearse when the big exam was approaching. This point alone is very touching to us for their artistic spirit.</p>
<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The domineering hot summer will soon be upon us. Therefore, the impression of the two words "graduation" is more deeply imprinted on the hearts of that part of the so-called "silver-plated graduates." When stepping out of the hall where the solemn graduation ceremony is held, the heart cannot help but throb, as if suffering an attack of melancholy. Inside the hall, it is harmonious and lively, listening with relish to the instructions of teachers and elders. But after the ceremony, walking out of the gate, it seems that I have suddenly lost something, and I can't help but lower my head and become disheartened. Two eyes full of hot tears are about to burst forth, as if I have been sentenced by criminal law.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this common state? Yes, simply put, it is the "way out" problem that is the price of four years of university life. When not yet graduated, one always feels that society is so vast. Can't it accommodate one person? That's right, expectations for the future are extremely optimistic, and even for those "predecessors" who generally look for a job to make a living, they express all sorts of sarcastic words, such as "rice buckets, such incompetent failures." But when it is my turn to participate in the graduation ceremony, these unsympathetic words will be put on my own head. What else can I say? Don't blame the heavens, don't blame others. But the "way out" has indeed become a problem. How heroic is that silhouette wearing a square cap, but what's the use of that? Aren't you seeing disappointment? If, unfortunately, after a month or two... there is no way to ask people for help in the east, and there is no response to asking people for help in the west. Needless to say, one is anxious. Asking about the result of "silver-plating" is this ending. How can the annoyance be described? Under such a multi-faceted concern, the so-called graduation may not become a happy and exciting event.</p>
<p>I have asked several classmates who are about to graduate about what they will do after graduation. They either say that it is undecided or that there is no way. And their words are full of disappointment. Such a disappointing downturn is really so boring. But we can only be bored. In fact, I know the seriousness of this "way out" problem. Today it has become universal. The current social environment is worth discussing at length. We don't need to talk about any theories. The facts are very clearly laid out in front of us. A large batch of square-capped "silver-plated" bachelors pours out from the sacred halls of learning. It is said that they are "seeking welfare for society," but in fact, where does society need them? I simply don't have enough words to describe it.</p>
<p>But then again, thinking realistically, modern education is becoming increasingly capitalized. The burden of studying has been squeezed to the point of exhaustion. One hopes to receive some profits after graduation, but who knows that one cannot even recover the capital today. Then, is this ultimately the uselessness of the university students themselves, or the uselessness of the nature of the university? These things are long to say and inevitably have a bias. Let's all understand this in our own hearts. However, if we want to curse, then let's first despise ourselves by three points, to show that we are not guilty, and then let's vent some anger, because having the urge to seek knowledge is the first wrong.</p>
<p>Why don't I reflect on myself, what is the so-called four-year university education? From running into the university with ulterior motives to wearing the square cap, what exactly has been given during this period? In other words, what has been gained? In my estimation, perhaps very few people can answer. I remember a magazine essay contest, "What has university education given you?" The result was that nothing was gained. Everything was as empty as if they had not entered university. We should applaud such a true confession. Someone once satirized, "To ask how well the university students have done in four years, one can use the amount of money they have spent as corroborating evidence and a ratio." That is, two hundred in the first year, four hundred in the second year, eight hundred in the third year, and one thousand six hundred in the fourth year. Well then, let me ask... I think that's probably insulting.</p>
<p>I seem to often have a contradictory opposite question. On the one hand, I feel that "silver-plated" university education is not enough, as if it must be "gold-plated." On the other hand, I feel that such mass production of "silver-plating" is already intimidating in terms of social use. There's no way to talk about "gold-plating." Such a conflict is really impossible to resolve. This is because the characteristics of the current Chinese education system are too intriguing, too amusing.</p>
<p>However, this question is of course only the panicked mentality of an ungraduated person. As I see the summer approaching day by day, I can't help but be moved in my heart. Many friends will end their university student days to find a way out. The portraits of them in square caps are all taken very neatly, but these are only superficial pleasures. Their inner distress is increasing day by day. A shadow tightly covers their hearts. It seems that they are very reluctant to end this life. At the same time, this "silver-plated" life will only be a short year for me. The journey has reached the last stage, especially giving me a feeling of unbearable sympathy. It's a pity that I am a person who cannot paint, otherwise, I would definitely paint a few allegorical paintings to express my vigorous emotions. Therefore, I can only borrow some of the above words to offer and express a fraction of my feelings. But the above words are definitely not able to fully express this issue. For the sake of length, I will leave it to another opportunity to supplement. My original intention is still to say farewell, to the "silver-plated" bachelors who will graduate in the summer.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to add these two words as a farewell and memorial, "Treasure it."</p>

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Hua Drama Company announced that the success of the company's "King of Ten Thousand Envoys" has truly exhausted the director Zhang Huimin's efforts and shattered the protagonist Wu Xixin's heart and soul. The purity of the content and the depth of expression dare to say that it is the king of domestic martial arts films. Anyone who has already appreciated the performances of Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wu will naturally make further admiration. Therefore, on the first day of the public screening, people marveled and said it was amazing, and every performance was sold out. From this, it can be seen that the reputation is not false.</p>
