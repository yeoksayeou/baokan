<h3>日政府藐視三國警告</h3>
<p>竟認爲惶慮之表示</p>
<p>正式覆文今日發出</p>
<p>（華盛頓）駐日美大使福白斯今日向日首相犬養毅表示美政府對於日本進兵錦州消息之系念、並奉訓令請政府注意於錦州區域内軍事視察員所發出之報告、查發出報告者有數國視察員、美國軍事參贊亦其一也、各報告一致聲稱、中國未有準備攻勢之徵象、聞英法兩國亦向日本有同樣警告、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）聞英法備忘録皆請日本注意十二月十日國聯行政會在巴黎所通過之議案、美國照會且言及國務卿史汀生贊助</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>該議案之言論、日本認此種照會、係惶慮之表示而非眞正警告、且認爲根據於誤會、據日人之意、此項照會係以錦州中立國視察員之報告爲根據、但諸視察員僅知錦州附近之狀况、而不知迫近南滿鐵路區域之情形、該區域四周盜匪與便衣華兵固時常出而擾亂也、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）英美法三國關於錦州方面日軍行動、昨日提出警告、現正由外務省起草正式答文、將於二十六日送達三國、據聞其内容如次、遼案發生後、（一）中國在東省之行政權完全破壞、失其機能、因此日本信東省治安、由日本政府負責維持、（二）十二月十日國聯理事會之决議、已確認日本關於討匪權之主張、日軍軍事行動爲係自衛上必要之最少限度處置、並無向錦州進攻之意圖、（三）討伐被中國正式軍統制之匪賊、爲極困難之事、但若匪軍聚集錦州、投入正式軍中、則日軍不能避免攻擊錦州、（四）日本鑑於此種事實、欲防止該方面之事態惡化、則除要求錦州華軍全部撤退外、别無方策、日本政府對於列强之友誼的勸告、極願諒解、然同時希望列强正察滿州現狀、信賴日本政府並對日本政府現正進行之一般的處置、始終採取傍觀的態度、（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（瀋陽）關東軍當局關於英美法三國之警告、抱懷如次意見、日軍依照已經發表之聲明書、澈底討論伐盜匪、維持治安、並已有堅固决心、斷乎排斥第三國之干涉、（二十日日聯電）</p>

<p>錦州　榮臻參謀部發言人今日在此對客談話、言及日軍之活動、謂日軍顯欲覓取攻擊錦州之藉口、因是日人招致大批土匪、供以軍火、給以金錢、命其作亂、滿洲在日軍佔據以前、匪氛原不猖獗、但今日據日當局報告、匪數竟多至八萬、查中國當道現經費旣覺支絀、而兵工廠又爲日人所有、故产愉不能攻擊如許匪衆、日人顯然視全部華人爲匪、自以爲可自由屠殺之云、記者詢以錦州華軍擬於日軍進攻時施用毒氣之消息、是否確實、發言人答稱、錦州並未有此種毒氣、華軍自已亦未備有防毒面具、此種謡言、殆係日人所傳播、以作日軍攻錦州時施用毒氣之地步、（二十五日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>謹貢獻於一中全會丨整理財政（二）</h3>
<p>我國今日財政之破産。以及民生之凋敝情况。旣已如昨評所陳述矣。然則致此之因。究爲安在。</p>
<p>吾人認爲今日致使我國家財政破産之根因。第一爲軍人干涉政治。行政不統一。第二。爲國家費用大部分背乎現代財政支出之原則而爲浪費。第三爲稅務行政不良。國家稅收不能涓瀝歸公。第四爲對平民之榨取太重。使平民大衆無甦生之機蓋軍人干政。則各省各區皆成爲獨立之單位。財政行政。中央無從通盤籌劃。各省之財政。恰爲擁有實力者個人所私有。予取予求。而非國家之財政國家支出旣背乎財政支出之四大原則。即經濟的原則。社會的原則。財政的原則。及政治的原則。則爲毫無意義之浪費。甚且爲少數人之朋分。非特無助於人民之生産與國家之繁榮。抑且爲其障礙。如我國今日之財政支出。依據財政部十八年度之報告。其百分比軍費最多。爲百分之四九·六。償還借欵次之。爲百分之三七·五。内政支出則僅百分之一二·九。此佔百分之四九·六之軍費與佔百分之三七·五之償還借欵之數。皆爲不健全之支出即皆爲不生産之支出。反之正所以妨礙生産。斵喪國家之元氣者也。稅務行政不良。則稅入人員得以從中漁利舞弊。如今日我國各種稅收之承包制度。以及駢枝機關之林立。旣病國。復虐民。設人民應納稅百元。其眞正歸入國庫者至多不過爲五十元。而人民實繳之數。則或且超過百元。其大部分皆爲個人所中飽。國家稅收蒙受無形中之折扣。至對平民之榨取過重。則於昨評所述田賦預徵。與捐稅繁多。已可概見。富有者麕集城市。欵存外行。與實力派相結納。旣可作種種之投機事業。愈以剥削人民。而其納稅之比例。則或且較平民爲輕。平民迫於苛政。陷於水火。生活日促。各失其業。使社會生産停頓。國民經濟凋敝。則榨壓之極。血肉皆窮。自無復爲繼。所謂「百姓足君孰與不足。」蓋即此意。以國家支出之澎漲言。則爲世界各國所共有之現象。以言國家外債之多。則世界亦不少超過我國之國。以言國民之担負。則方之英國每人担負之租稅額爲一六八·四元德爲六七·○元。美爲五六·○元。意爲四一·○元我國僅一·八元亦不爲重然而國家財政之所以破産。以及民生之所以凋敝。無他。則以上述四大根因之故。</p>
<p>據昨日消息。一中全會財政組審查改善財政制度方案原則内容。爲（一）實現主計制度（二）實現就地審計稽核制度。（三）實現統一的國府制度。各機關出納保管公欵人員應繳納保證金。（四）裁撤駢枝機關。（五）中央銀行脫離財政部之直接指揮等五項。吾人認爲此項原則。仍爲不關痛癢之枝葉問題。决不足以言整頓。實則今日我國家財政問題之癥結所在。人非不知。特知而不敢言。因循遷就。畏憚煩難。不敢以斷然决然之手段。切實予以整頓耳。過去如此。現在如此。設今後仍將如此。則我國家之將來。尚其堪問。故整頓財政。實爲我國家當前最迫切之大政。同時亦即關係我國家生死之嚴重問題。</p>
<p>整頓之道爲何。吾人今不欲瑣碎言之。特舉其大端。</p>
<p>（一）曰統一全國財政。嚴禁軍人操縱把持。各省各地之收支。都應由中央直接收取支付。（二）曰裁减軍費。除必需之國防軍費以外宜切實裁减。中央尤應嚴厲制止擴充軍備。并防止提取國帑以作内戰之需。（三）曰實行節約緊縮。裁撤一切駢枝機關。减少一切背乎財政支出原則之支。出并比例的减縮公務人員之俸給。黨費應由國民黨員自行擔負。（四）曰實行預算决算制度量入爲出。須取决於能眞正代表民意之機關。并每年度應作公開之報告。使人民得有監督之機會。（五）曰改革稅收制度。修正各項稅率。并澈底肅清營私中飽之惡習掃除財政上一切積弊。（六）曰切實廢除一切苛捐雜稅。并嚴禁各省各地政府巧立名目。横徵暴歛。（七）曰增多實業與敎育之行政費用。以興敎育。以振實業。助民造産。并以繁榮國民經濟。（八）曰實行孫中山先生之土地政策。實行社會主義的財政政策。（九）曰打破以舉外債募内債紓財政危困之傳統政策。（十）曰整頓幣制。至其在我人民者。則金融家應竭力扶掖國家財政之改善。應斥餘資發展實業。絶不宜貪圖折扣。爲國家募集長内亂以及種種毫無意義之浪費之公債。北京政府覆滅後。北京銀行團所蒙受之損失。前轍可鑒。大多數人民。尤應切實注意。并監督國家之財政。使非出諸人民之公意。一文不能浪費一文不能濫取。能如此。夫然後我國財政始有改善之日。我國民經濟與國家經濟。始有甦生之望。國家政治。始有漸以入於正軌之機</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>錫山名畫家賀天健君。熱腸古道。矯矯不羣。自暴日侵佔遼吉。買憤激之餘。所作詩詞。多慷慨激昂之句。讀者每爲泣數行下。此次何香凝女士發起之救濟國難書畫展覽會。賀奔走呼號。竭盡宣傳之力。各界之聞風而集者。賀之功也。昨見其所寫邊城落照圖。黄沙遍野。古塞荒寒。的是神品賤每角題以二絶云。落日荒荒下大川。壓頭未去杞人天。龍沙埋骨知多少。盡到邊城更恰然。猿鶴沙蟲入刧灰。將軍意氣有餘哀。魯戈未許揮殘日。任使河山一角摧。字字沉痛。語語驚心。令人不忍卒讀。嗟夫如賀君者。蓋亦亂世之傷心人也。</p>

<h3>字紙簍裏的頌詞</h3>
<p>中國無是非。世界無是非。如果有是非；便是强者是，弱者非；富者是，窮者非；勝者是，敗者非；走運者是，倒霉者非。該說公道話的人不說公道話而說敷衍話，則是變爲非，非反爲是，而是非消滅了。</p>
<p>國民會議開幕時蔡孑民先生寫了一篇四言頌詞，裏面有兩句是：「濟濟一堂：農工商土。」我們按圖索驥，會塲裏找不出一個靠自已種田吃飯的眞農人，也找不出一個靠自已做工吃飯的眞工人。該說公平話的蔡先生是和甘地先生敷衍法國人一樣的令人失望。</p>
<p>假使五十年或一百年之後，有位小胡適，愛做考據工夫，誤以德高望重的蔡先生的親筆頌詞作證據，豈不要弄假成眞，變非爲是？</p>
<p>倒底是非也不易埋没。字紙簍裏有時會跑出史料來。下面便是當時報章登不出來，火爐裏幸而没有燒完的一篇文字，現給發表一下，誰是誰非，聽讀者自判。</p>
<p>「孫公遺敎：　天下爲公。　國民會議，　樂與誰同？</p>
<p>吾觀代表：　士商亨通。　農不像農；　工不像工。</p>

<h3>紀戚繼光之後裔</h3>
<p>— 碧漪</p>
<p>太倉北鄉有村。名讀書巷者。相傳戚少保繼光讀書處。當少保統浙兵平倭冦日。行營所至。見其地有廢祠。竹樹森森。環以清溪。遂駐節其中。嘗夜分披讀兵書。燈光射林外。有漁人停橈竊聽。守備軍疑敵人偵探。擒至帳中。少保問知是本地漁家。賜以酒食。明日傳徧城邑。後乃改某村名爲讀書巷。紀念少保也。讀書巷左近農家。有戚姓者。云是少保後裔。前清光緒初。浙人吳廣涵爲太倉知州。有老農戚某爲人欺侮。涉訟公庭。因自述爲戚繼光後人。其始祖乃戚繼光六世孫。官典史太倉。旣去職。貧不能歸。邑紳爲醵金。買地築屋於讀書巷。俾訓蒙爲業。典史有廉名。又以其祖故。邑人愛而爲之安置如此。老農又言。世譜燬於洪楊之難。故不得呈鑒。州牧吳公矜憐之甚。爲昭雪其冤。今老農之孫。名學濂者。畢業於小學後。以無力讀書。不能升學。此次有某學校組織之救國募金團。來至讀書巷。演講倭奴暴横。國人應共同奮起殺賊等語。並及明朝戚繼光平倭事。戚學濂年已十五矣。聞之。因自述戚繼光爲其遠祖。並謂我極願讀書。惜無力升學。如仍得爲學生。我亦當向大衆奮呼。以盡天職。亦以不忘我祖宗也。時率領募金團之敎員張君。詳詢戚學濂家世。感其有志向學。並有不忘祖宗等語。因以好言慰之。謂我當歸去。商諸校長及同事。共謀協助爾升學。必有以報爾也。戚學濂欣然稱謝。謂果能如願。他日當受軍事訓練耳。述者又謂戚學濂雖僅十五歲。已長成如十六七。身體頗發達云。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>畢薩的斜塔風潮意大利的畢薩Ｐisa鎭中。有一座斜塔。也是世界有名的建築物。建造於六百年前。完全用大理石造成。本來是直直的。誰知完工未久。那塔基就陷落在一邊。而斜度竟與日俱深。大有傾倒之勢。該塔本高一百八十英尺。現在已有十七英尺完全傾斜了。神父畢加度。FatherPiccardo他是建造禮拜堂鐘塔的專家。鑒於塔的愈益傾斜。恐有危險。因此想把它扶直起來。他建議在傾斜處對面的塔基下挖掘下去。在工作時。可用起重機將塔基擱住。完工以後。再徐徐放下。那麽塔可不斜而直了。他對於這計畫很爲熱心。相信一定可以辦到。工作時毫無危險。因爲他先前曾扶直過許多禮拜堂的欹斜的鐘塔。所以扶直畢薩斜塔。也是可能的事。但是畢薩的市民大起風潮。紛紛反對。可是世界各地的旅行家。震於斜塔之名。都到畢薩來觀光。使地方上年年多一筆收入。一旦把斜塔扶直。那就無足觀了。而收入方面自然也大受影響。畢神父的計畫。遂歸泡影。</p>
<h3>蘇州之國貨運動談</h3>
<p>— 季平</p>
<p>國難以還。抵制日貨。漸見成效。此固全國人民堅持之决心要亦商界同胞能自動覺悟之所致。近頃日本奪取錦州進窺平津之暴行。旣愈演愈劇。則抵貨運動。更當努力推進。以制日人最後之死命。惟抵制日貨。究屬治標。增加生産。提倡國貨。方爲治本之法。不謂此三月以來。國貨生産。未見增加。銷路亦不甚暢旺。彼歐美各國之商品。源源而來。充斥市塲。觸目皆是。利權外溢。實爲隱患。所謂收之桑榆。失之西隅。其斯之謂乎。爲今之計。國人競尚洋貨之心理。應根本剷除。工商界造産推銷之改進。尤亟亟不容緩矣。</p>
<p>蘇州公園范雲書君。熱心愛國之土也。鑒於國貨運動之銷沉。爰邀集地方人土。籌商辦法。决定明年元旦。在園内舉行國貨展覽大會。期以三日。現正徵集出品。自此訊傳出。各地國貨工廠。送往陳列之工藝品。爲數可觀。類皆出奇制勝。最精良者。且駕舶來品而上之。范君以海上工業繁盛。爲國貨生産之大本營。滿擬廣事徵集。以冀大會結果之美滿。</p>
<h3>德育與美育（上）</h3>
<p>— 方江水</p>
<p>日前蕭子昇先生在中國藝專演講·對於美術有特殊之見解·清言屑玉·娓娓動人·兹録其梗概如左。</p>
<p>近人提倡加美。羣二者於德體智三育之中。號曰五育。頗具學識。實則人與獸之分野。一美字耳。吾國爲文明古國。於美術之貢獻。至多且鉅。即今巴黎之所謂圖案大學者。其取材多半師法我往古遺跡。奉爲矩矱。昭然若揭。而吾國試反躬自省。猶故吾也。絲毫未見進步。此雖美術界之恥。實則敎育界之恥也。外國圖案一系。可稱大學。吾敎部則於整個之美術學校。不得稱爲學院。此汚點不去。藝術何從提倡。至於社會方面。亦多視美術爲消遣品。以爲雕虫小技。君子不爲。此誠觀念錯誤之處。亟宜設法糾正者也。不知美育於文化上。占有重要之地位。昔孟子曰。其爲氣也。至大至剛。余以爲唯美育足以當之。美至至極。然後能無我。然後能超脫。導入入於純潔之境。今人蔡元培。欲以美育代宗敎。良有以也。間嘗思挽救末世。消弭戰禍。當以美育爲歸依。蓋殘暴無人性之事。絶無美性存在。欲美性存在。則殘暴之事。自可消除。所謂美育實爲德育之基礎。雖然。美與德有相互之關係。美可爲德之基礎。德亦可爲美之基礎也。美術家與匠人之何自分。以其一拘於摹仿。一能創作也。一爲機械式。一富於思想也。思想即精神。亦即人格。故美術家之表現。處處有人格在。百人爲詩。詩各不同也。百人爲文。文各不同也。百人爲書爲畫。書與畫亦人各不同也。蓋此百人之思想不同。精神不同。人格不同。故表現各異也。有高尚之思想。偉大之精神。純潔之人格。自然流露於作品之間。其作品乃能高尚。乃能偉大。乃能純潔。雅俗之分以此。故美術家必須有人格之修養。今之世爾詐我虞。寡廉鮮恥。已相習成風矣。於此而言人格。世人得毋笑其迂邪。然欲知人之所以爲人者。以有人格故。</p>
<p>入有精神肉體二者。肉體之我。人無以異也。唯精神之我。乃眞我耳。人身生活。分有三期。胚胎未成。不識不知。曰無意識。困極思眠。昏昏入睡。謂之有知。實乃無知。謂之無知。實亦有知。曰半意識。精神活潑。思想豐富。每感斯覺。曰全意識。亦可謂之精神生活。此生活期間。亦有行爲如無意識。半意識時代者然。故精神生活。須加以修養。有修養。始得有人格。</p>
<p>據范君言。大會籌備有日。佈置已略具端倪。徵集日期。定本月二十九日截止。凡有物品。如係盡人皆知之國貨如縐紗。連史紙等。即不必送會。所最歡迎者。爲新近發明或仿造而與舶來品相類者。如熱水瓶、電料、毛絨織物等。而各種新出品如嫌笨重不便寄遞者。樣本、模型、照片亦無不可。該園會塲寛敞。裝璜富麗。屆時姑蘇城下。士女雲集。當平添不少佳話也。（移酬援黑）</p>

<h3>戰！（上）</h3>
<p>— 王渭賓</p>
<p>戰！是弱小民族希圖挣扎生存的唯一出路。</p>
<p>在歐戰後的土耳其丨近東的病夫國，爲着它和德意志同盟出兵的緣故，亦被躋在戰敗國之列，一九一八摩德洛司休戰條約訂定後，土耳其所有的海峽砲臺，鐵路，石油礦，電報等一切權威與生産的利器，恐怕都歸入了聯軍管理的掌握，還不休歇，還有一個倚靠不列顚做後盾的仇人希臘國，時常要想在土耳其半島上肆其野心，這時土耳其是國將不國，多麽可憐，幸而出得一個中興英雄并末爾，他見國勢渙散，民族流離的可痛，就在涘爾司倫地方招撫流亡的民衆，建立共和國，自任爲大總統，在安哥拉都城設施澈底改革的新政治·</p>
<p>但是總覺得新土耳其的發展，在在受希臘仇人的掣肘，至於國聯公理的旗幟，當然要在砲聲轟烈之中顯現的，他覺得非與仇人拚一死戰，土耳其在世界上是不能發揚的了·</p>
<p>眞巧，一九一九年的五月希臘竟其派了軍隊占據土國的斯麥那地方，土耳其見臥榻之旁，豈容他人酣睡，朝朝晚晚勵兵秣馬的想報這仇，後來竟被他一塲死戰，殺得希臘大敗而逃，於是這一戰打出了洛桑會議條約，土耳其保存好多權利，漸漸的强盛起來，這是在世界大勢的先例上觀察，中國此次暴日横行的對付是不可不戰丨</p>
<p>日本在東北的横行侵占，並不是今天開始，九一八的肆殺，不過漸進政策改爲急暴手段罷了，倭人早已認南滿爲朝鮮第二，日本靈魂所依，無奈中國人是慣生了麻木病，昏　不悟，便絜他得寸進尺的强占，和外症一般微紅淡腫·不知抵禦，才養到這樣潰爛不堪的不可收拾了，難爲他自已鹵莽，這樣的爆發，震醒了夢寐沉沉的中國人，同深切齒，不共載天，老老少少没一個不是摩拳擦掌，思與仇人在疆塲一逞，南北亦已和洽，此時正宜利用一致的民氣，合軍力以討仇，一鼓而殲，意中事也，此又從國内的大勢上觀察，不可以失時機而不戰丨</p>
<p>或又云獨主速戰，曾否顧及中國之兵，能戰與否？中國之兵械設備，能戰與否？</p>
<p>設此問者，可一讀中法戰史，中日戰史，中國兵未嘗敗也，敗於後方清朝命吏之嫉妬肘掣耳，苟其能上下一心，令作行陣，則勝敗在勇氣，在方術，馬占山數千人馬，能克張海鵬萬餘之雄，且我國軍隊素不畏戰，蓋凡人胆氣如是，苟遇大戰當前，反覺視若無事，此臨過陣者都作如是言，今將黄渡戰記略誌如下，以見戰士之從容。</p>

<h3>棉市跟美棉趨堅</h3>
<p>棉市微堅、因美棉略漲、人心趨佳、且多頭拉緊不放、心氣愈强、然實需各廠均停頓不辦、因外棉早已吸飽、本棉無進胃、而漢埠到貨日見增加、但標棉形勢十分挺秀、因業外者及多頭吸收不動之故、</p>
<p>▲本月漢標漲四錢　漢標前市開盤、以外棉上漲而堅、各月漲一二錢、惟本月漲四錢午後又漲五分至一錢、全日成交統計四萬四千擔、查賣出森康一千擔、益昶一千七百擔、義餘一千四百擔、大昶一千一百擔、益豐一千擔、瑞源三千二百擔、買進公泰二千六百擔、賡豐二千六百擔、信誠三千擔、長豐一千二百擔、長和二千一百擔、兹將收盤價録左、</p>

<h3>美棉略形起色</h3>
<p>▲印棉停市</p>

<p>▲滬南　昨日來源念六七號、早稻到貨見稀、零碎稍有走動、約一千四五百石、行情高貨看定、中關白粳喊起角許、青角薄稻隨到隨銷、一開盤上落一角半、洋杜尖各守原盤、變元陰化無榮辱、微露下游之象、洋米甬越二帮採辦、故市面升高角許、</p>
<p>▲新閘　昨日西路來貨不多、早晨臨市者尚稱踴躍、但形勢難以捉摸、崑山江陰米最多、行情好起一角、南港早晚稻鄉莊帮略有應酬、市無升沉、埠杜尖到旺胃淡、價短數分、南京尖裝到一車、本街去路不弱趨勢見疲、</p>
<h3>烟台帮試辦洋米</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况形居定勢、期貨因洋行封關未有新成交、回籠貨亦祇一二百噸、行情無大出入、現貨本街胃口仍佳、烟台帮初次試裝小絞數百包、天津帮亦稍問訊、故市面頗見穩站、統市開出小絞米一千包、價九元四角至九元二角七分、一號西貢一千五百包、價十一元至十元零八角八分云、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、以洋麥報價、好起一二角左右、各月份市氣、大致平靜、迨至下午開盤、本月份市面突轉俏利、（以交易所爲最後之一天）因華豐廠抵補甚暢、兼以津帮之現銷、頗見活絡、大廠之粉、甚覺堅俏、至收盤時、復因外行空頭、不得不補、遂又漲近分、遠期各月份、因近期之轉好、亦見帶高、不過趨勢尚平、漲勢無幾耳、結果本月份較前日漲二分七釐半、一月份漲一分半、二三月份漲七釐半、四月份漲五釐、五月份漲七釐半云、</p>
<h3>標麥空户防軋抵補</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈穩定之象、因洋麥報價、仍見微好、且以大部分空頭、因恐將來現麥到源不繼、須防受軋、故從事抵補者、殊見不少、因此交易雖未甚暢、市氣則反呈堅穩也、觀年内已無交易、在此十天中、當看外匯如何、及國際之變化再定升沉也、績果一月份較前日好二分、二月份好二分、三月份好一分、四五月份未動云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　耶誕節洋莊絲停市兩日</h3>

<h3>到南洋</h3>
<p>— 復蘇</p>
<p>（一）離别故國青山了</p>
<p>許多人都以爲南洋是「黄金舖地、金鋼鑽鑲窗户」的世界、不論蠢材、獃子、一到南洋、就能帶回大把黄金·白金·金鋼鑽、這眞是上古時代的神話呀、黄金世界裏的黑髮黄臉兒、給隆鼻碧眼兒視爲狗羣裏的動物、予取予求、任意殘踏以後、表面上似乎殖民地的苦難者還能視我們爲神仙、老虎、任憑我們榨取骨髓、以塡本身被别人挖去的窟窿、然而我們又何曾得到什麽呢、僅有悲憤塡胸、熱涙萬行而已、最明顯的例子、就是無家可歸、無人保護的華工、他們除了滿身換了黧黑的顔色、和遍體的傷痕以外、只有一套黑色的衣服、和綑銅子的袴帶子、若說聊以自慰的話、就是軟脆的肌肉、比較離國以前堅靭了許多、</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>我到爪哇的動機、也許是受了黄金的誘感、現在雖想不起、分不清、而過去事實的輪廓、也還可以憶起幾許呢、</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>那是緑水共長天一色的上午、我站在Ｓ埠的碼頭上、一對驚異的眼光、輻射着内港裏一起一伏的波浪、同時碧波上浮動着的帆船、舢板及飄楊着外國旗幟的小汽船、大輪船的影子、也一起顯在我的眼前、若是以我們兩條腿的人類去比擬、那末、帆船、舢板和小汽船、就是幼小的孩子、或一張皮包骨的病人、摇摇幌幌地走路般、大輪船即爲健步如飛的健康者、偶然由内港裏的微波聯想到大海裏排山倒海般的大風浪、初次航海的恐怖情緒、便徒然湧上心頭了、</p>
<p>然而十餘年前、我的父親搭着大輪船到爪哇去、不是平平穩穩地到達了目的地嗎、千百萬華僑坐着這些輪船在大海中來來往往與海神作戰、又何曾失過事呢、這麽一想、横在胸膈裏初次航海的恐怖、便風捲殘雲般掃得乾乾净净、覺着乘長風破萬里浪的快感、於是想到晨光　微的日出、和火球般的太陽滾到海底裏去的晚景、在望不見青山、看不見大地、渺渺茫茫、絶無涯際的大海洋面上欣賞着火球滾來滾去、這是多麽寫意的事呀、</p>
<p>我終於跟着我的同伴及行李、貨箱、由帆船載着經過日帝國的砲艦而到達輪船上去了、謝天謝地、感謝我的同伴們、感謝大義老伯保護着我的行李、和扶着我不安的身子、</p>
<p>一陣大風刮來、蔚藍色的海水、便馬上墳起一座小山、和我們的帆船不住地狂吻着了、一陣一陣的海水、也朝着我們打來了、海水在我的頭上流着、流到嘴唇上、以舌頭輕輕地一舐、它的味兒比鹽還要厲害、又鹹又澀、要吐又吐不出、吞又不能吞下去、而且也没淡水來漱口、在這痛苦萬分的時候、忽然帆船往左一傾、高高地堆積着的行李、就一件一件地爭先滾下來、滾到我們的身上、倒在大義伯的懷裏、幸虧壓在我身上的東西、是輕輕的衣服包、只感着懷裏多了一件綿綿的東西、未曾受着什麽痛苦、也不曾壓斷了手臂或腿兒、恐怖之餘、慶幸着安全的慰藉、</p>
<p>因爲輪船距離出港的時間、還有四五小時之久、在行李貨箱堆裏的旅客們、又感於天氣之悶熱、便嘩啦嘩啦的亂嚷起來、</p>
<p>大義伯是我父親的老朋友、天生一副莊嚴偉大的臉孔、而且獲得了朋友們的公認、他那副心腸很是乾净、無稀微的污點、聽說他向來有「路見不平拔劍相助」的行爲、這全是俠義者流寶貴的行爲啊、因爲這樣、我的母親對於幼子離鄉去國的遠行、雖然掉了許多眼涙、堅執着我的手不成我去、終於揮着慈愛的熱滬勉勵着放我走的最大原因、就是在旅途中有大義伯保護着、可以减少她胸裏的憂愁、而且滿懷充滿着希冀的熱情、希冀我能由大義伯帶到南洋去跟着我父親做生意、敎年老的父親少操些心、</p>
<p>船上的聲音靜止了、我馬上感着寂寞和去國離鄉的悲哀、想到白髮蕭蕭的母親、想到弱小的弟弟、想到我的先生、連我們的小同學渾名呌做洋臘燭的小六那次乘着歷史敎師睡午覺的時候、倒了一杯熱茶放在他屁股旁邊、一面在他的房外大嚷特嚷、故意呌他從甜蜜蜜的夢中驚醒來、身子一翻、把那杯熱茶弄濕了褲子、一面扯看濕淋淋的褲子、一面眼睛冒着火抓起鞭子趕着我們的惡作劇、也想到了呢、然而捱過了幾個鐘頭以後、輪船便要駛出去了、我和我的母親、弱弟……彼此間之距離也漸漸兒長遠起來了、我胸隔裏思念家庭的思潮、正在淘湧澎湃的時候、陡然聽見一句寒人心魄的詩句、於是我也把思家的念頭切斷了、所有的注意力都給他吸收了去、</p>
<p>『少小離家老大回、</p>
<p>鄉音未改兩鬢霜、』</p>
<p>悽慘欲絶的傷心語喲、他這詩句的波浪盪得到的地方、那兒的人們、便呈現着憎惡的神色、好像要申斥他似的、嘴唇微微地顫動着、</p>
<p>他年紀約三十五歲以上、滿臉都是暮色蒼茫、幸虧那副銅框眼鏡和油跡斑剥的長衫、支撑着他的架子、不然大衆給他的小小汚辱便不能免了、然而因爲他擺着那副詩人的架子、不光是無人敢聲罪致討、而且表示同感的人還有呢、</p>
<p>『老先生、我這副老骨頭、眞怕將不能回鄉啊、』</p>
<p>『哈、得罪了、老兄、你滿額都在發亮、說凶得吉、將來天公定有注大財送給你、』</p>
<p>『哈哈、老先生、謝天謝地、敬領老先生的金言、』</p>
<p>他向着那個老華僑拱了一陣手、又摇摇擺擺地走着吟哦他的詩句了、那個老華僑歡喜得連汗都從肉裏嚇出了許多、佈遍了他的額門、便不由自主地揮手向額上一拭、這樣一來、汗珠也没有了、光輝也消失了、</p>
<p>共唱</p>

<h3>路上所見</h3>
<p>— 影客</p>
<p>安步以當車的我、獨自在馬路上走着、在這樣清晨的時間、行人寥寥、只有那爲生活環境所制的被迫者、即上工廠的苦工、至校中的學生、還有我出於求將來國家主人翁的智識、亦不得不從那煖煖的被窩裏、鑽出來夾着冷冰冰的硬書包、至校中去求學、在西北風斗裏、發抖似的奔走、除了所謂神秘的人之外、尚有嗚嗚的汽力車、哼哼的人力車、嗒嗒的馬力車、噹噹的電力車、其中雜着少數吱吱呷呷的獨輪車、車與車來往奔跑、雜雜地在道上走、好像各在急急奔喪似的緊要、趕火車似的忙碌、我亦眞不懂他們因何匆匆地忙什麽、但恐亦俱各在生活環境的潮流中、覓尋新大陸吧、呵、馬路上除了雜雜的車輛、餘都是寂寂無聊的靜着、哦、在長長似箭的馬路上、兩邊尚有所謂外國人設立的樹、在春夏時濃濃密密似凉篷的緑葉、此時已給風伯請去冬眠了、祇剩下枯瘦而無一點裝飾的枝椏、好似各表其曲線玲瓏、互相爭妍、可惜顔色太不雅觀了、死寂地直立道旁、一望過去排得齊齊整整、培栽的功夫不小呀、</p>
<p>忽在遠遠地有一輛黑漆包車、内中坐了一位白白胖胖大　似的人物、那車夫連呌帶喊的忙忙飛奔、恐他的主人有天大重事、以至如此如飛一般的向我身邊擦過、我亦不甚留意、只是獨步東張西望、以趕我的路程、走未幾步、忽有一粗魯難聽的聲音傳來、</p>
<p>「揍你媽的、没了眼了、大清早起來、忙什麽、給你老子腰闖得痛不痛、替我滾出來、」</p>
<p>喔唷、我聽這駡聲、嚇了一跳、趕忙回頭見有一堆人在哄哄的看熱閙、當中夾了一輛包車我出於多管閒賬的緣故、亦退回幾步、擠在人羣中、因着我矮小的緣故、用了我那早上吃粥的力氣、擠在叢中、使我澈底地痛快看看、究竟吵什麽事、再望前一看、原來是剛纔匆匆的從我身旁飛過的一輛黑漆包車、内中坐着的仍是大老闆似的人物、</p>
<p>「先生、實在對不起、我的車夫粗魯、有錯碰着先生的腰、對不起、不是有意的、算了吧、」</p>
<p>我聽了這位大老闆似的坐客的話、纔知車夫因急忙故、碰了這位先生的腰、再看這位先生、有點斯文相、但是穿着制服、兵士模樣的學生、　邊掛了一塊藍幌幌的牌子、我亦莫明其到底什麽一流人物、很兇的抓住車夫駡道、</p>
<p>「哼、好容易、算了吧、那有這樣便宜事、我現在不打你、請你上巡捕房去講理吧、」</p>
<p>說着連拖帶拉的抓小雞似的從容、氣紅着兩隻耳朶、氣青了一副鐵板面孔、那車夫雖在西北風之下、仍在汗流淫淫、恐因奔跑與驚嚇故吧、兩眼苦苦地望着他的主人、好像求他主人因着大老闆的面子、不至受苦到巡捕房去、但他主人亦替車夫求告說着、</p>
<p>「先生、實在對不起、是他錯的、不應這樣忙、誤碰先生貴腰、我呌他陪個禮、叩個頭吧、阿三、趕快叩個頭、陪着先生的禮吧、」</p>
<p>「哼、車夫叩個頭、有什麽希奇、我的腰還在痛呢、那有怎麽容易事、快出來、放下車、上巡捕房去、」</p>
<p>兵士式的人又在横兇了、用力緊緊</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的拖那令人可憐的車夫、但那車夫死死地直着、亦强極着不肯動、四面中國的看客聞事不管的在看把戲、竟毫無一位英雄豪傑出來打抱不平、可憐、正在互相拖拉的當兒、那軍服的人說、</p>
<p>「你竟强、不肯走、我喊巡捕來……」</p>
<p>話未畢、從袴子旁邊的口袋内拿出一個雪亮的警笛、放在口上、</p>
<p>「嗚…嗚…嗚…」地的吹着、大家都呆了、竟不知到底閙了一會什麽花樣、吹起警笛來了、膽小的觀客、溜也似的跑了、恐有干涉或不留心吃了一粒花生米、（即流彈）我呢、亦想要走、但又被我好奇心黏住了脚底、竟仍不動、脚踏原地、要看看到底閙着什麽大不了的事、亦要想知道這位兇狠無理的人、竟是什麽一流人物、什麽了不得的大好老、因爲他穿了制服、竟使我無從料起、如果是學生、哦、不是吧、學生乃讀書的人、有智識、有學問、有禮貌、有…夠了、我想學生不至於如此無禮之極、但是軍士嗎、我剛七猜八想的轉念頭翼忽聽……馬蹄奔跑似的飛來一個中國巡捕、這巡捕不錯、勇敢、他聽了警笛聽、他不管什麽事、竟捨生忘死的來救駕、他不人了他的本分、我看了他慌慌張張的跑來、到人羣旁、一羣看客、亦急急的退鬆了圈子、那位巡捕擠了進來亦不問情由、一把抓住了那可憐者車夫、然後問道、</p>
<p>「什麽事、大家不要爭吵、上巡捕房去講理吧、」</p>
<p>「喂、巡捕、你是懂理的人、那有不留意、車子碰了這位先生的腰、陪個禮都不行、要去打官司、哼哼、」</p>
<p>「巡捕、你將這車夫送上巡捕房去、我然後就來、這人無理極了、大清早起、忙什麽、碰了人家的腰、還要行兇、豈有此理、竟瞎了眼了、」</p>
<p>「先生、我莫明其妙、不知一回什麽事、稍爲碰一碰、又没有什麽大不了的事、我叩頭陪禮不行、要我到巡捕房去坐牢監、我是隨便怎樣都不去的、」</p>
<p>「哼、你兇、還在强、非要你去不可、巡捕來了、怕你怎的、」</p>
<p>這三位原告、被告、各訴各事、已在巡捕先生面前告狀了、我想這位巡捕一定將車夫抓去了事、那知忽聽得、</p>
<p>「哈哈、我當是什麽人命盜刦、忙忙的奔來、那知是一點小事、算了吧、先生、算你倒霉、給他碰了一記、駡兩聲算了事、何必大驚小怪的吹呌子、閙得大家擠在一堆、看熱閙、害得阻止交通、」說着、竟眞起了一根黑白相混的棒、驅趕各位不出錢的看客、但是各位不過退鬆了一點、並未散去、但那兵士不服、仍道、</p>
<p>「不行、不行、我好好的走路、要他碰我幹嗎、路是公共的、大家好走、碰來碰去、没有怎樣容易事、我非要好好的敎訓他一頓不可、你無論怎樣替我抓去、」</p>
<p>「哦、先生、何必呢、你我都是中國人、他拉車子的亦是中國人、太家一樣的同胞、爲了一點小事、吵得一塌糊塗、他又不是特意來碰你、是無心的、吵駡一回算了事、還要到巡捕房去、給那外國人去審、先生、不犯着、對嗎、何必呢、大家中國人、原諒原諒吧、」這位巡捕從從容容說完、還帶點冷笑的態度、</p>
<p>我當聽他說的時候、竟得着不少看客與那包車上的坐客點了不少的頭、因爲說得有理有條、當我聽完他的話、登時使我一陣酸痛、全身的熱血、上下循環迅速的跑着、使我通身的肌肉、立時緊張、寒毛豎立、半身麻木、差不多一身都要暴發了、唉、這位巡捕先生、家中自然貧寒、纔出來在那暴日寒風裏巡邏街道馬路、他更不消說、學問是很淺、只好拚着父母天然淘汰所養成的力大身高的肢體、來謀生、竟洋杨着無學問的巡捕行生、說出話來、胸有成竹唉、令所佩服感謝、竟不料軍服的人不及巡捕有道德、可嘆、唉、再看這位兵士模樣的人、因着口才的辯白不及巡捕先生、竟放手紅着臉的走了、那罡人連連感謝巡捕、趕忙拖着車子要走、但巡捕將他車篷拉住、道、</p>
<p>「下回拉車子慢慢的跑、别趕你娘喪似的、又得罪别人、」</p>
<p>「是、我本來跑得不快、」</p>
<p>「有勞有勞、費你心、多謝、再會吧、」</p>
<p>這位大老似的先生謝了巡捕、竟坐着車飛也似的走了、我因車子走了、人亦散了、巡捕兵士都走了、趕緊追上一步、要看看這位兵士身上掛了一塊什麽徽章、却好他從我這邊走來、我一看上面、寫着</p>
<p>「××××××義勇軍」之字、</p>
<p>我一看登時使我腦海緊張、有點昏昏醉酒後的態度、竟使我茫茫似在雲端之中、脚無實地、</p>
<p>唉、「義勇軍、」豈不是爲抗日而組織的嗎、不是學生嗎、「抗日救國」是什麽意思、抗什麽日、救什麽國、義勇軍爲誰而組織、其責任是否在馬路上找弄是非、强兇霸道、專打自已同胞、唉、口中喊抗日救國比别人響、身上的國貨比别人多、是救國唯一的條件嗎、爲著東洋這次暴動東三省的緣故、纔組織一隊所謂又義又勇的義勇軍、其責任是什麽、是救國、是亡國、是打日本人呢、還是打自已的同胞、</p>
<p>唉、我的疑問太多了、我的愚笨的腦子、竟使我無從答起、越想越希奇、我這次馬路上之所碰的事、所謂何等可敬可佩的愛國者、義勇軍、不過如此而已、唉、因此使我想近日的時勢更緊張了、所謂的愛國者、大救其國、不知竟、如何救法、宣傳、演講、罷工、罷市、罷課、請願、募捐、等等花樣、是否中國的救國方法、我亦不得而知、總而言之、瞎子幫忙、越幫越忙、來了這一批的人物、救國、中國越救越興旺了、政府中的一批大好老、大人物、應該辭職退位、任這一流有道德、有學問、有智識、有計謀、有權柄的學生義勇軍等來充當罷、大家等着、忍耐的等着、國不會亡的、有他們來擔任、我們祗要飯吃三碗、閒事少管的過日子吧、</p>

<h3>Committee Members of Each Group Reviewing Proposals Separately</h3>
<p>Important Resolutions by the Party Affairs Group</p>
<p>Education Essentially Stalled</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The proposal by Zhao Zhonglian and others to stipulate that half of the seats for legislative and supervisory committee members must be elected by the people, and that the election method should adopt a representative system, was reviewed by the Political Group. The outcome was to request the General Meeting to hand it over to the National Government for handling. The proposal by Bo Wenwei and others to quickly raise funds to resolve the aftermath of military affairs, quell domestic unrest, and resist foreign aggression was reviewed by the Military Group.

<h3>Disagreements Arise Between Central Committee Members</h3>
<p>Wu Zhihui Speaks of Treason</p>
<p>Arousing Displeasure Among Guangdong Committee Members</p>
<p>Sun Ke Leaves Nanjing for Shanghai</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During today's Second General Meeting, when discussing the Jinzhou issue, Wu Jingheng said in his speech that in this Eastern Provinces incident, the Beijing side had absolutely not committed treason, and that the traitors were others. The danger in Jinzhou was not the fault of Zhang Xueliang, but the fault of so-and-so. Sun Ke suspected that this was a satirical rebuke of the Guangdong side and felt quite unhappy. After the meeting, he went to Shanghai in the afternoon, accompanied by Li Wenfan, Fu Bingchang, and Sun Xinghou. Some Guangdong committee members held a meeting in the official residence of the Ministry of Railways, requesting the three representatives remaining in Nanjing, Jian Youwen, Wu Chaochu, and Zou Lu, to maintain the work of the conference as before, based on their original intentions of peace and unity. They also sent Liang Hancao to Shanghai to report the Guangdong committee members' talks, urging Sun to return immediately, putting national interests first. Sun's staff member, Zhong Tianxin, will go to Shanghai tonight. (Special Dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Guangdong committee members requested that Wu Jingheng be punished, otherwise they would not attend any more meetings starting tomorrow. Chen Mingshu and others are separately trying to persuade the Guangdong committee members, but there is still no result. The point of Wu's slip of the tongue today was referring to the Guangdong side as traitors, colluding with Japan to invade the Northeast. When the masses asked who the traitors were, Wu replied that they were neither far nor near. The Guangdong committee members were quite angry. (Special Dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Lin Sen Urges Hu Hanmin to Come to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Telegraphing with Urgent Words</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Lin Sen telegraphed Hu Hanmin, saying that since Brother Jie had left Nanjing and Brother Jingwei was delayed in Shanghai due to illness, the comrades in Nanjing were eagerly hoping that he would come as soon as possible to jointly face the national crisis. Although Brothers Junpei, Ti Yun, and Zhesheng attended the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the absence of his esteemed presence meant there was a lack of guidance, and the result might not be satisfactory. With the foreign invasion pressing closer day by day and the world in turmoil, it was only by relying on his virtue and prestige that people's hearts could be calmed. Although he knew that his daily life might not yet be stable and that traveling might be tiring, he remembered that when the Premier was on his deathbed, he specifically exhorted his comrades with the will of peace, struggle, and saving China. In normal times, we should already be catching up and continuing his legacy, let alone when the party and the country are in danger. How can we sit idly by and not save them? Zhesheng is the Premier's only son and has always been loved and cared for by him. Now that he has come to Beijing alone, braving hardships and suffering from illness, it is only to achieve the goal of peaceful unification and realize democratic politics. We deeply admire his ambition and express our sympathy. It seems that we cannot stand by and watch him suffer without offering assistance. Our party shoulders the responsibility of political tutelage, striving for the expansion of civil rights and the early realization of constitutional government. At this time, the cultivation and guidance of self-government depends on the enlightened. He is the pillar of the party and the country, admired by all. The people's desire for good governance cannot allow him to retreat at this time. The situation is pressing, and I have no time to choose my words carefully. I urge him to come to Beijing immediately to preside over everything. (Special Dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Special Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 8:00 PM on the 25th. It is said that the content was to discuss the methods for dealing with the Jinzhou incident. (Special Dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Various Committee Members Exchange Views After the Second General Meeting</h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei and Lin Sen Hopeful for the Position of Chairman of the National Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After today's General Meeting, various committee members exchanged views. The position of Chairman of the National Government will be decided by voting between Cai Yuanpei and Lin Sen. The Beijing committee members initially planned to vote for Wang, but the committee members from Wang's side stated that Wang was determined not to take the position and asked them not to vote for Wang. According to the 72 executive committee members from the first, second, third, and fourth sessions, Hu Hanmin occupies 15, Wang occupies 18, and the Beijing committee members occupy 32. If they all vote for one person, that person will be elected.

<h3>Japanese Government Disregards Warnings from Three Countries</h3>
<p>Actually Considers Them Expressions of Anxiety</p>
<p>Official Reply to Be Issued Today</p>
<p>(Washington) The American Ambassador to Japan, Forbes, expressed to the Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi today the American government's concern about the news of Japan's advance into Jinzhou. He was also instructed to ask the government to pay attention to the reports issued by military observers in the Jinzhou area. It was found that observers from several countries, including the American military attache, had issued reports. All reports unanimously stated that China showed no signs of preparing for an offensive. It is said that Britain and France also issued similar warnings to Japan. (Reuters Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is said that the memorandums from Britain and France both asked Japan to pay attention to the resolution passed by the League of Nations Administrative Council in Paris on December 10. The American note also mentioned that Secretary of State Stimson supported</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>the statements in that resolution. Japan considers these notes as expressions of anxiety rather than genuine warnings and believes that they are based on misunderstandings. According to the Japanese, these notes are based on the reports of neutral observers in Jinzhou, but the observers only know the situation near Jinzhou and do not know the situation near the South Manchurian Railway area. Bandits and plainclothes Chinese soldiers often come out to disturb the area around the railway. (Reuters Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the actions of the Japanese army in the Jinzhou area, Britain, the United States, and France issued warnings yesterday. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently drafting an official reply, which will be delivered to the three countries on the 26th. It is said that the content is as follows: After the Liaoning Incident occurred, (1) China's administrative power in the Eastern Provinces was completely destroyed and lost its function. Therefore, Japan believes that the maintenance of security in the Eastern Provinces is the responsibility of the Japanese government. (2) The resolution of the League of Nations Council on December 10 has confirmed Japan's claim to the right to suppress bandits. The military actions of the Japanese army are the minimum necessary measures for self-defense and there is no intention to attack Jinzhou. (3) It is extremely difficult to suppress bandits controlled by the official Chinese army. However, if bandits gather in Jinzhou and join the official army, the Japanese army cannot avoid attacking Jinzhou. (4) In view of these facts, in order to prevent the situation in that area from deteriorating, there is no other way except to demand the complete withdrawal of the Chinese army in Jinzhou. The Japanese government is willing to understand the friendly advice of the powers, but at the same time hopes that the powers will observe the current situation in Manchuria and trust the Japanese government and always adopt a bystander attitude towards the general measures that the Japanese government is currently taking. (Reuters Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Kwantung Army authorities have the following opinions regarding the warnings from Britain, the United States, and France: The Japanese army will thoroughly discuss the suppression of bandits and the maintenance of security in accordance with the statements that have already been published, and has a firm determination to reject the interference of third countries. (Jiji News Agency Telegram on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Destroy Railroad Tracks South of Dakubo Station</h3>

<p>(Tianjin) Jinzhou telegram, (1) Yang Xinglin, a road policeman from Tientay, escaped and reported to Dakubo Station that he, the Tientay stationmaster, and the ticket examiner were staying in Tientay.

<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram. After Japanese soldiers occupied Tientay town on the 23rd, local militia gathered five or six hundred people and surrounded them in a fierce battle overnight. More than half of the Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. On the morning of the 24th, the remaining Japanese soldiers broke out of the encirclement. At noon, they led a large force to occupy the town and attacked the station. Station employees and police scattered. Japanese troops captured Tientay and continued to advance. Goubangzi and Jinzhou are both in danger. (Special Dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram. Our armored train in Tientay was surrounded by Japanese troops and could not hold out. Japan has occupied Tientay town. Sun's brigade sent an armored train to assist. Our volunteers are still supporting the enemy. (Special Dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Jinzhou　A large number of Japanese troops occupied Fakumen and Tientay near Yingkou yesterday, but the Japanese army did not continue to advance today. (Reuters Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>Jinzhou　A spokesman for Rongzhen's staff talked to guests here today about the activities of the Japanese army, saying that the Japanese army obviously wants to find an excuse to attack Jinzhou. Therefore, the Japanese recruited a large number of bandits, supplied them with weapons and ammunition, and gave them money, ordering them to make trouble. Banditry was not rampant in Manchuria before the Japanese army occupied it, but today, according to reports from the Japanese authorities, the number of bandits has increased to as many as 80,000. It is found that the Chinese authorities are now experiencing financial difficulties and the arsenals are owned by the Japanese. Therefore, it is impossible to attack so many bandits. The Japanese obviously regard all Chinese as bandits and think they can kill them freely. When asked whether the news that the Chinese army in Jinzhou planned to use poison gas when the Japanese army attacked was true, the spokesman replied that there was no such poison gas in Jinzhou and the Chinese army itself did not have gas masks. This rumor was probably spread by the Japanese to make way for the Japanese army to use poison gas when attacking Jinzhou. (Reuters Telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Respectfully Offered to the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee | Reorganizing Finances (2)</h3>
<p>The bankruptcy of our country's finances today, as well as the declining state of the people's livelihood, have already been described in yesterday's commentary. However, what exactly are the reasons for this?</p>
<p>We believe that the root causes of our country's financial bankruptcy today are: first, the interference of the military in politics and the lack of unified administration; second, the majority of national expenses are contrary to the principles of modern financial expenditure and are wasteful; third, poor tax administration prevents national tax revenue from being fully collected; and fourth, the excessive exploitation of the common people leaves them with no chance of recovery. Military interference in politics turns each province and region into an independent unit. Financial administration cannot be planned comprehensively by the central government. The finances of each province are privately owned by those with power, who take and demand at will, rather than being national finances. National expenditures violate the four major principles of financial expenditure, namely the principles of economy, society, finance, and politics, resulting in meaningless waste and even embezzlement by a small number of people, which not only does not help the people's production and the country's prosperity but also hinders them. According to the Ministry of Finance's report for the eighteenth year of the Republic, military expenditure accounted for the largest percentage of our country's financial expenditure, at 49.6%, followed by repayment of loans, at 37.5%, while domestic expenditure was only 12.9%. Both the 49.6% spent on military expenditure and the 37.5% spent on loan repayment are unsound expenditures, meaning they are non-productive expenditures. On the contrary, they hinder production and deplete the country's vitality. Poor tax administration allows tax officials to profit and engage in corruption. Today's contract system for various taxes in our country and the proliferation of redundant agencies are both harmful to the country and oppressive to the people. If the people should pay 100 yuan in taxes, at most only 50 yuan actually goes into the national treasury, while the amount actually paid by the people may exceed 100 yuan, with the majority being pocketed by individuals. The country's tax revenue suffers an invisible discount. As for the excessive exploitation of the common people, this can be seen from the advance collection of land tax and the numerous taxes and levies mentioned in yesterday's commentary. The wealthy gather in cities, deposit their money abroad, and collude with powerful factions. They can engage in various speculative ventures and further exploit the people, while their tax ratio may even be lower than that of the common people. The common people are oppressed by harsh policies and fall into dire straits. Their livelihood deteriorates daily, and they lose their jobs, causing social production to stagnate and the national economy to decline. When exploitation reaches its limit, both flesh and blood are exhausted, and there is no hope for recovery. The saying "If the people are sufficient, with whom will the ruler be insufficient?" captures this meaning. The expansion of national expenditure is a phenomenon common to countries around the world. As for the amount of national debt, many countries in the world have more debt than our country. As for the burden on the people, compared to the tax burden per person in the United Kingdom (168.4 yuan), Germany (67.0 yuan), the United States (56.0 yuan), and Italy (41.0 yuan), our country's 1.8 yuan is not heavy. However, the reasons for the bankruptcy of national finances and the decline of the people's livelihood are none other than the four major root causes mentioned above.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's news, the main points of the plan for improving the financial system examined by the financial group of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee are: (1) implementing a budget system; (2) implementing a local auditing and inspection system; (3) implementing a unified national government system, with officials in all agencies handling public funds required to pay a deposit; (4) abolishing redundant agencies; and (5) separating the Central Bank from the direct command of the Ministry of Finance. We believe that these principles are still trivial and do not address the core issues and are definitely insufficient to constitute a reorganization. In fact, everyone knows where the crux of our country's financial problems lies, but they are afraid to speak out, procrastinate, and fear difficulties, and dare not take decisive measures to truly reorganize it. It was like this in the past, it is like this now, and if it continues to be like this in the future, then the future of our country is questionable. Therefore, reorganizing finances is the most urgent major policy for our country at present, and it is also a serious issue related to our country's survival.</p>
<p>What is the way to reorganize? We do not want to go into trivial details today, but will highlight the main points:</p>
<p>(1) Unify national finances and strictly prohibit military manipulation and control. All income and expenditure of each province and region should be directly collected and paid by the central government. (2) Reduce military expenditure. Except for necessary national defense military expenditure, it should be drastically reduced. The central government should strictly prevent the expansion of armaments and prevent the extraction of national funds for internal warfare. (3) Implement economy and austerity, abolish all redundant agencies, reduce all expenditures that violate the principles of financial expenditure, and proportionally reduce the salaries of civil servants. Party expenses should be borne by Kuomintang members themselves. (4) Implement a budget and final accounts system, living within our means. Decisions must be made by agencies that can truly represent the people's will, and public reports should be made every year to give the people an opportunity to supervise. (5) Reform the tax system, revise various tax rates, thoroughly eliminate the bad habits of embezzlement and corruption, and eliminate all long-standing problems in finance. (6) Resolutely abolish all exorbitant taxes and levies and strictly prohibit governments at all levels from creating pretexts for levying taxes arbitrarily. (7) Increase administrative expenses for industry and education to promote education, revitalize industry, help the people create wealth, and prosper the national economy. (8) Implement Sun Yat-sen's land policy and implement a socialist financial policy. (9) Break the traditional policy of using foreign debt and domestic debt to alleviate financial difficulties. (10) Reorganize the currency system. As for our people, financiers should strive to support the improvement of national finances, devote surplus capital to developing industry, and never seek discounts to raise public debt for the country to suppress internal unrest and various meaningless wastes. The losses suffered by the Beijing banking group after the collapse of the Beijing government serve as a warning. The vast majority of people should pay close attention and supervise the country's finances so that not a single penny is wasted or taken arbitrarily without the public will of the people. If this can be done, then our country's finances will have a chance to improve, and our national economy and national economy will have hope of recovery, and the country's politics will gradually get on the right track.</p>

<h3>National Central University Postpones Resumption of Classes</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahua Submits Resignation Four Times</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of resuming classes at National Central University, since more than half of the students have left the school, resuming classes immediately and calling back the students through newspaper advertisements would not be possible in a short period of time, and students who returned home after being granted leave would suffer from missing classes. After a meeting of the university affairs committee, a flexible approach was decided: classes will resume on January 11 of next year, and the academic calendar set for this year will be adjusted accordingly.

However, internal affairs at the university are difficult to handle, and it is difficult to restore the students' emotions. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Receives Taiyuan Press</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Feng Yuxiang received reporters from various newspapers at the Zhejiang Guild Hall at 11:00 AM on the 25th, hosted by Lei Jishang, Guo Zengkai, Gao Xingya, and others. Feng arrived at 10:00 AM and first reported that recently, due to the national crisis, he had received urgent telegrams from various parties, and he could not refuse, so he met with Yan Xishan, Liu Zhenhua, and Zhao Daiwen and agreed to concentrate forces and unite against Japan. He has telegraphed Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin, inviting them to jointly face the national crisis. Feng personally has absolutely no prejudices against Chiang Kai-shek, and in the past opposed his political dictatorship. Now that he has stepped down, he is naturally still a friend. Then, in response to reporters' questions: (1) Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin had not sent telegrams as of yesterday; (2) He has three proposals for the conference; (3) They will come to Pingjin tomorrow or the day after; (4) He will not return to Fen for the time being; (5) He still holds the same position on Japan as he answered to reporters the other day, but we must use the entire national strength externally, and there will definitely be concrete plans in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. He advocated that all national troops be transferred to the front line, and at the very least, heavy troops should be used to defend considerable defensive positions; (6) Regarding the issue of going to Beijing, some people at Lanchun advocated not going, some advocated going in half numbers, and some advocated going as they pleased. The final decision was to go entirely; (7) He has no prejudices about moving the capital, but if the foreign enemy is urgent, it can be moved when necessary; (8) Mass movements are extremely necessary, but they must be organized. Wang Jingwei has already made a proposal at the conference. The current government cannot be without mass supervision; (9) He has already made proposals on volunteer armies and conscription. He also talked about education, etc. Feng meant that we must resist Japan on the one hand and reorganize internal education and training on the other hand. After an hour, he took photos and dispersed. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Anhui People Refute Chen Diaoyuan's and Xu Shiying's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Anhui people's opposition to Chen Diaoyuan, Xu Shiying told reporters: 1. I am the chairman of the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, and the members' opposition to Chen Diaoyuan this time is the unanimous position of all fellow villagers' organizations. I obey public opinion; 2. I have never had any grievances with Diaoyuan. When he went to Anhui this time, I deeply hoped that he could bring blessings to our Anhui. As for all the measures he has taken since taking office, society will have its own public opinion, and I am unwilling to say more; 3. I am from Anhui, so I naturally do not oppose Anhui people governing Anhui. However, I have not been involved in politics for a long time and have absolutely no thoughts of becoming an official. Even in terms of my current position, since I was ordered by the government to handle disaster relief in May of the 17th year of the Republic, I am still old and weak, and my talents are insufficient. I have resigned five times, but I have not been allowed by the government. Recently, I still intend to submit a sincere resignation to unload my responsibilities. As for the affairs of Anhui Province, I advocate only that the local order be peaceful and the people's suffering be reduced, which is what I wish for; 4. The Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association is a joint organization, and I am listed as the chairman and member. Mr. Chen has accused me of being a rogue and requested a thorough investigation. If it is true, the government has its own discretion, and I do not need to argue and will listen to the government's disposal. It is also heard that Mr. Chen also attacked me for presiding over Anhui's administration in the past. I have been in politics for more than 30 years and have asked myself that I have not failed the country and society. If there is defamation, there is also public opinion. As for Chen's belief that this newspaper denunciation is opposition to the central government and is regarded as reactionary, this kind of logic is extremely ridiculous.

<h3>The Fall of Huichang</h3>
<p>More than 10,000 Red Bandits Attack the City</p>
<p>Tunnel Dug for Over a Mile</p>
<p>Explosives Destroyed the Blockhouse</p>
<p>Militia Asks Shantou for Troops</p>
<p>(Swatow) The Huichang Maintenance Committee and concurrently the militia commander-in-chief, defeated and escaped to the Ma Ancestral Hall in Meixian County, issued a telegram stating: The remnants of the Red Bandits under Peng Dehuai, Zhu De, Huang Gonglue, and Li Lisan, totaling more than 10,000, attacked the city in October through Xigang, Luokou, Baiezhuang, Buzhuwei, Gaopai, and the Sixth District. The militia charged five times, killing many bandits. Before long, the bandits, one mile outside the Xijiao Tower, dug a tunnel one zhang and five chi deep day and night with gongs and drums to the Xijiao Tower, using wooden coffins to carry gunpowder and burying it underneath. At dawn on November 1, with a loud explosion, several zhang of the blockhouse wall collapsed, and the bandits took the opportunity to pour in. The militia resisted desperately, killing hundreds of bandits. The false commander Peng Zhen died on the city wall. In the late evening, three tunnels in Xijiao Tower, Gaoshan Hill, and Nanxun Gate exploded at the same time, with the sky turning red and city bricks flying several li away, blasting down the city walls, five or six zhang wide. The bandits climbed onto the city from the gaps. The militia fought bloody battles, but were unable to enter. On the 26th, the militia ran out of ammunition and were cut off from reinforcements, broke through the encirclement and escaped, with shells raining down and white blades clashing in close combat, fleeing into the Mian River. On the 27th, the city fell. The county magistrate, officials, public law groups, and staff were killed, their expressions unchanged as they died, shouting "Long live the Republic of China!" The bandits captured more than 5,000 old, weak, women, and children, and refugees from both townships fled to the Fujian-Guangdong border. On the 5th of this month, they fled to Wuping Xitouwei, collecting remnants of troops, two major teams, and two teams of Xie Wenqing's militia, fought with the bandits in Xiewei Village for 70 days, and also ran out of ammunition and fled to Xitou, where they joined each other. Zhong Wencai of Wuping provided food. The bandits have a great momentum to break into the Fujian-Guangdong border, and if they are not stopped now, there will be endless regrets. Ouyang Xin kowtows. Ouyang arrived in Shantou on the 22nd and asked the authorities for troops, willing to serve as a vanguard. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Reports from Japan and Russia of a Plot to Assassinate Hirota</h3>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Moscow, 24th: The Soviet Russian government recently discovered a plan by a foreign diplomat stationed in Russia to assassinate Hirota Koki, the Japanese ambassador to Russia, a conspiracy to undermine Japanese-Russian relations. The authorities announced today that they have obtained the admission of the foreign country's chief envoy and will return the perpetrator to his home country.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 25th: Regarding the case of a plot to assassinate Japanese Ambassador to Russia Hirota, the Japanese government has not yet received any report from the ambassador. It has now issued instructions to Ambassador Hirota, urging him to report the truth. It plans to decide on a firm policy after the ambassador's official telegram arrives.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Moscow, 24th: The Soviet News Agency issued a message stating that a Russian citizen, whose surname begins with the letter "G," working for the People's Transportation Committee, reported to the Soviet State Political Police on the 22nd of this month that he had been in contact with a staff member of a certain foreign embassy in Moscow, Mr. A, for more than three years. Initially, they studied antiquities together. The staff member gradually inquired about the conditions of Soviet railways, especially focusing on the construction of new routes. At the beginning of December, at the request of Mr. A, the Russian citizen spoke specifically about the Manchurian Incident. During one conversation, the staff member suddenly revealed his intention, saying, "If the Japanese ambassador to Russia were to be assassinated, would it cause a war between Japan and Russia?" Because the Russian citizen did not express an opinion, the staff member raised the Far East dispute again several days later, saying that the assassination of the Japanese ambassador was a major event. He wanted the Russian citizen to take on the task. Subsequently, when they met, the staff member insisted that the assassination was necessary but was purely a demonstration. He also said that the Japanese ambassador must not be killed. It would be enough to fire two shots at the glass window of his car with a rusty handgun. The staff member repeatedly said this, and the Russian citizen finally understood his conspiracy against Soviet Russia and his malicious intention to provoke war. He reported to the State Political Police, saying that due to a lack of experience, he mistakenly entered into a conspiracy to betray his country and made this report to atone for his previous faults. The Soviet News Agency also stated that after receiving this report, the People's Foreign Affairs Committee verified the matters mentioned and requested that the foreign embassy send the staff member back to his home country because the staff member enjoyed diplomatic treatment and was not suitable for being handed over to a Soviet Russian court, so this method was used to deal with the situation. The foreign embassy has already complied. This agency reserves all rights regarding this message.</p>
<h3>Current Japanese Cabinet Issues More Public Bonds</h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th: The previous cabinet planned to issue 300 million yen in public bonds for the next fiscal year. The current cabinet is issuing an additional 170 million yen, totaling 470 million yen.</p>
<h3>Report of the International Bank Advisory Committee Released</h3>
<p>Detailed Study of Germany's Financial Situation Finds It Unable to Fulfill Reparation Conditions</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Basel, 24th - The International Clearing Bank Committee, after close study, has determined that Germany is unable to pay the conditional payments under the Young Plan and has now released its report. The report provides a detailed analysis of Germany's financial position, stating that massive transfers from one country to another are sufficient to overturn the balance of payments. It can only increase current disturbances, and the liberation of debtor nations from payment burdens they cannot bear would merely transfer this burden to creditor nations. Creditor nations, as debtors, will also feel the burden is too heavy. Germany owes a substantial amount of short-term foreign debt, making it prone to major panic. According to German government statistics, Germany owed a total of £600 million at the end of July. In 1931, Germany had to cope with the withdrawal of approximately £245 million in funds, causing the National Bank to lose £85 million in cash. Germany's industrial production decreased by one-third between 1928 and 1931, resulting in an increase in unemployment to five million. Germany needed capital after the war to make up for the gaps left during the war. According to the Banker's Committee's estimate, it absorbed £900 million in capital, although £500 million of it was offset by reparations. However, the remaining £400 million, combined with Germany's own savings, led to a major development of public and private enterprises between 1925 and 1930. It is estimated that the total investment during that time was no less than £1.64 billion, of which £1.12 billion was invested by public institutions. The report contains a plan and states that with the assistance of this plan, Germany's stability can be restored.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 24th - Public opinion here believes that one result of the Young Plan's Advisory Committee report will be a temporary or long-term suspension of debt payments by U.S. debtor nations next year.

<p>▲Reuters, London, 24th - British Prime Minister MacDonald spoke to guests today about the Basel International Committee's report on Germany's ability to pay its debts, saying that the governments of the countries concerned should meet immediately and that the British government is prepared to participate immediately. The report, compiled by a committee composed of representatives from the Allied countries and Germany, states that the decline in world trade has increased Germany's burden, and all governments concerned should act together to adapt to this challenge, otherwise there will be another disaster. It also states that even when the Hoover moratorium expires next year, Germany will still not have the ability to pay the conditional payments under the Young Plan.</p>

<h3>Central Government Holds Commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising</h3>
<p>▲Li Liejun Reports on the Uprising</p>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a commemoration meeting for the Yunnan Uprising at 9:00 a.m. on the 25th, attended by more than 600 committee members and staff. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting. Li Liejun reported, "The Yunnan-Guizhou Uprising occupies an important page in revolutionary history. Without this uprising, the spirit of the 1911 Revolution could not have been promoted, and the protection of the Constitution in Guangdong and Guangxi and the Northern Expedition in the 11th and 15th years of the Republic would not have been easy to advance. The Yunnan-Guizhou Uprising really opened up the situation of unity in the Southwest, the foundation of the Northern Expedition was established here, and the completion of the unification was also due to this, which must be mentioned. Since the failure of the Second Revolution against Yuan Shikai in the second year of the Republic, most of the comrades of our party followed the Premier and Mr. Keqiang to Japan, and some went to Europe and the United States, and the revolutionary forces in the country were lost. Only the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi were not ravaged by the Northern Army, but their strength was weak. Those who worry about the world often try to do what is difficult, but neglect what is easy, prepare for what is fearful, but ignore what is not suspicious. Yuan Shikai did not pay attention to this, not knowing that the soldiers and civilians of Yunnan and Guizhou had been rich in revolutionary spirit at the end of the Qing Dynasty. The governor of Yunnan was originally Cai Songpo, who saw the failure of the revolutionary army and entered Beijing, wanting to seek relief politically, not knowing that Yuan was not a person to be negotiated with politically. Songpo was depressed in Beijing. Tang Jiyao, the governor of Guizhou, led his troops back to Yunnan, and Liu Xianshi succeeded as the governor of Guizhou. Both provinces were able to gather talents from all over the world and reorganize their armies, and the uprising was based on this. After the outbreak of the European War, Liejun, Niu Taisheng, Chu Minyi, Zhang Puquan, He Ziqi, Wang Youlan, Li Mingyang, Yang Zhuoren and other comrades met in London unexpectedly, and under the guidance of Mr. Wu Zhihui, decided to return to the country and plan a major event together. At the same time, they deeply worried that during the fierce European War, ambitious people would take the opportunity to plunder and something might happen in the East. Liejun and Minyi and Ziqi secretly arrived in Saigon, but were discovered by the French officials and imprisoned in a humble room. They were spared from disaster thanks to Minyi's persuasion and had no choice but to return to Nanyang. At this time, Yuan's claim to be emperor was heard. Liejun then accompanied Fang Shengtao, Lin Hu, Chen Zepei, He Ziqi and others, and attached to a ship to Hong Kong, with the help of Li Genyuan and Zhang Muxin, obtained a loan of 500,000 in cash, and went to Yunnan together. At that time, the sages in Yunnan, such as Luo Peijin, Li Yuegai, Huang Yucheng, He Guojun, Yin Chengxuan, Xie Ruyi, Deng Taizhong, Yang Zhen and others, had already planned first. Soon, Cai Songpo, Ren Kecheng, Dai Kan and Wang Boqun arrived one after another, and the momentum became stronger. The hearts of the two public officials Tang and Liu were also more determined. Therefore, a proclamation was issued to the world, and the Yunnan-Guizhou volunteer army rose up. Songpo commanded the seven ladder regiments to enter Sichuan, Liejun led the two ladder regiments of Fang Shengtao and Zhang Kairu and the advancing army of Huang Yucheng, and went east to Guangdong. Cheng Qian entered Hunan as an envoy, and Wang Wenhua simultaneously led his troops to aid him as commander of the Eastern Route. Xiong Kewu attempted to conquer Sichuan as an envoy. Wherever the volunteer army went, the wind rose and the clouds followed. The following year, Yuan Shikai died in injustice, and the southwestern situation was formed. Therefore, today's memorial day should be brilliant in history. At that time, it was difficult to guarantee the success of using the troops of the two provinces to fight against Yuan's hundreds of thousands of troops, but the foundation of success was based on this. This was due to the people's desire for a republic and the courage of the revolutionaries. The national situation is now urgent, and the people's desire to implement democracy and carry out constitutionalism is also increasing. The General Assembly has paid full attention to this important issue. I hope that the colleagues of the General Assembly will continue their past spirit, cooperate with the people, break through the difficulties and open up a new situation, and consolidate the country so as not to fail the meaning of today's commemoration." After the report, the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Students Suspend Demonstration</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, Wuhan students, upon hearing that petitioning students in Nanjing had been harmed, were indignant. They specifically planned to hold a general demonstration and general propaganda by the Wuhan academic community on the 24th, as well as a memorial service. He Chengjun and Peng, Chief of Staff of the Wuhan Garrison Department, paid extraordinary attention upon hearing the news. The Garrison Department dispatched Judge Yan and Deputy Officer Liu, etc., to Wuhan University and Zhonghua University overnight to contact the two presidents, Wang Shijie and Chen Shi, requesting them to effectively prevent it. At the same time, they strictly ordered the military police under their command to take special precautions. Due to the suddenness of the event, the students were somewhat out of touch with each other, and after persuasion from the presidents of the respective schools, they agreed to temporarily not hold a parade demonstration, while the memorial service was still held at the original scheduled time. At 8:00 a.m. on the 24th, students from Wuhan University were the first to form a team and go to Yue Ma Chang Assembly Ground to gather. Because students from other schools had not arrived, they proceeded with the opening ceremony. Huang Yi was elected as the general chairman. After the memorial service, some proposed motions, but they were not established due to the small number of people. When the meeting was held, two regiments of Xu Tingyao's 4th Division were drilling in the empty square of Yue Ma Chang, and a part of the army from the Fortress Command also arrived to temporarily maintain order. The nearby important intersections were also under martial law at the same time, prohibiting people from entering and leaving, and traffic was cut off. After more than twenty minutes, the students returned to school after the meeting, and the military police also dispersed. In order to prevent students from taking such action again, He Chengjun issued a general order to all military and government agencies on the same day in the name of the Pacification Office, allowing emergency disposal. He also issued a notice to the public in the name of the Provincial Government. The Garrison Department also issued instructions, ordering them to resolutely deal with the situation. The order reads as follows:</p>
<p>This Department previously received a telegram from the Telegraph Inspection Office, reporting that the Third</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The International Command of the Chinese Communist Party has recently established a puppet Soviet Provisional Government to take the opportunity to expand into the anti-Japanese patriotic movement, paying particular attention to gaining the leadership of the student movement, propagating to the masses, disapproving of the government's current policies, and intensifying the crisis in China. Secret orders have been issued to investigate and prevent this. Recently, patriotic student movements have sprung up everywhere, and there have been actions that go beyond the norm and disrupt order. It has been found that they are all being manipulated and used by Communist Party members, pretending to be patriotic while secretly trying to subvert the government. Fortunately, students in various places have now realized this, and most have withdrawn voluntarily. However, it is unexpected that Wuhan students have continued to launch movements when this trend is gradually being quelled. The Wuhan students have always been patriotic and have never lagged behind, but they have all been able to maintain order and have never behaved improperly. This Department has always been extremely protective of them. This is not only due to the fact that all students deeply understand righteousness, but also because the Wuhan Communists have been completely eradicated since last year and have no way to gain a foothold. After detailed investigation, it has been found that the patriotic movements of students in various schools in Wuhan, especially in a certain university, are indeed being instigated by a small number of Communist Party members and other reactionary party members. These Communists are trying their best to avoid the names of student leaders, such as representatives and cadres. Instead, they are using outstanding students with excellent character and academic performance to come forward and lead, while they are secretly manipulating behind the scenes, using the name of patriotic movements to insult senior officials, destroy important agencies, and attempt to make the government unable to maintain the platform, so as to cause foreign troops to seek excuses to protect overseas Chinese and create trouble, subvert the government, and intensify the crisis in China. They also plan to inspect the militia of various schools on New Year's Day next year to carry out the above-mentioned riot. Their plan is not only to disrupt the current situation, but also to harm young people, destroy education, and shake the foundation of the country. In this situation, this Department, while striving to protect the respectable and lovable students, will inevitably strictly investigate and arrest the extremely evil Communists who pretend to be students, and punish them according to the law, based on the idea of protecting students. Moreover, their harm to the national land is even more intolerable by law. If there are unscrupulous students who are willing to be exploited by the Communists, disrupt order, disturb public security, and intensify the crisis, this Department will also issue secret orders to strictly suppress and resolutely deal with them, and will never allow the stability of Wuhan in the past two years to be disturbed. In addition to reporting and issuing separate orders, it is urgently ordered that you strictly follow the instructions and strictly investigate, arrest, and prevent them (24th).</p>
<h3>Taiyuan Students Commemorate Mu Guangzheng</h3>
<p>▲And Request the Central Government to Arrest the Culprit Miao Peicheng</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence, The Anti-Japanese Association of Students of Shanxi Province held a petition a few days ago. When they arrived at the Provincial Party Headquarters, a bloody incident occurred, and Mu Guangzheng died on the spot due to serious injuries. Yesterday (the 20th), the Anti-Japanese Association of Students held a general memorial meeting for Martyr Mu Guangzheng at Zhongshan Park in Taiyuan City, attended by more than 50 agencies and organizations, students from various schools, and all workers. The whole city lowered its flags to half-mast and suspended work and markets to express condolences. The meeting began at 12:00 noon, presided over by Li Shuxin, the representative of the Student Federation, who reported on the deeds of Martyr Mu and the shooting by the Provincial Party Headquarters. Subsequently, representatives from the Student Federation and various circles paid tribute. Then, representatives from various circles and representatives from high school and junior high school of Jinshan School, as well as representatives from Martyr Mu's family and fellow villagers' association, gave speeches one after another. At 1:30 p.m., the whole body sent the coffin of the martyr to the Provincial Party Headquarters and stopped it in the auditorium. Then they shouted slogans, went out for a parade, and dispersed at 3:30 p.m. Attached is a telegram to the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Nanjing, Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee. The committee members of the Shanxi Provincial Party Headquarters commanded the picket team to shoot and kill students petitioning for the patriotic movement. A clever telegram has been presented to the Joint Assembly for filing. Currently, Han Kewen, Yao Dahai, Li Min, and Su Shouyu are detained at the Shanxi Garrison Command. Qiu Yuandang, Liang Xianda, Li Fen, Hu Boyue, Zhang Xiulan, and Zhao Liandeng have fled and have not been captured. It is heard that the culprit Miao Peicheng has now fled to Nanjing. Please arrest him nearby and bring him to justice in order to rectify party discipline and extend popular anger. The urgent telegram cannot but eagerly await orders, the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Anti-Japanese National Salvation Students, engraved (21st).</p>
<h3>Riot of Villagers in Changle County, Fujian</h3>
<p>▲Opposing the Defensive Army's Coercive Collection of Opium Seedling Tax</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence, The people of Changle County, Fujian Province, have always been known for their bravery. Previously, a riot occurred because they refused to pay the water fee of the Lianbinggang Irrigation Bureau. Zheng Baojing, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, returned to his hometown as a fellow villager to mediate, and it was quelled. Recently, another riot occurred in opposition to Jin Zhenzhong, the Brigade Commander of the 1st Brigade of the Marine Corps, sending troops to the countryside to force the planting of opium seedlings and collecting donations, attacking the county town, kidnapping the county magistrate, and confiscating the firearms of the Marine Corps. The situation is even more serious than the previous one. The details of the incident are as follows: On the 19th, Chen Xipeng, the County Magistrate of Changle County, went to Beihu Township to attend a ceremony at the invitation of the local gentry, leaving Section Chief Chen Jianzhen in the county to handle official duties. When he arrived at the entrance of Huijing Township, he was detained by the villagers. Upon hearing the news, the farmers from various townships in the northern district immediately gathered more than 500 people and suddenly rioted at about 1:00 a.m. on the 20th. They first attacked the Lianbinggang Irrigation Bureau in Longmen Township, disarming the two platoons of the Marine Corps stationed in the bureau. Then they marched towards the county town in formation, arriving at the city at 3:15 a.m., dividing into two teams. More than 300 people with guns surrounded the Marine Corps camp on Tapan Mountain, disarming the company of troops stationed in the camp. More than 200 people carrying bamboo poles stormed into the county government, detaining Section Chief Chen Jianzhen, opening the prison and releasing the prisoners. The officials of various agencies in the city fled in the middle of the night upon hearing the news, and the tax revenue was completely lost. The farmers then established the United Township Security Corps Headquarters in the county government. At about 7:00 a.m., Lin Zongyue, who claimed to be the Commander-in-Chief, issued a proclamation attacking the garrison troops, stating, "Since the Marine Corps has been stationed in Changle, the people's burden has increased. The security of the various townships has been disturbed. There was a land survey before, and now there is an irrigation project. The losses are estimated to be more than a million gold, and the deaths and injuries are no less than five hundred. This time, the planting of opium seedlings was forced in various townships, causing the tragedy of the villagers' resistance, etc." At the same time, slogans such as "Farmers, businessmen, and workers unite to overthrow corrupt officials, overthrow the Marine Corps that collects opium tax and lamp tax" were posted all over the city. The farmer soldiers who entered the city included those wearing long gowns, short clothes, felt hats, bamboo hats, barefoot, and straw sandals, and their shapes were very strange. The local order was in chaos. In the afternoon, County Magistrate Chen Xipeng was escorted back to the county government from Huijing Township to maintain public order. Small steamboats from Changle to the province were also detained, and traffic was completely cut off. Upon receiving the report, the Provincial Government convened a temporary meeting on the morning of the 21st and decided that the Marine Corps' forced planting of opium seedlings should be punished, but the rioters taking the opportunity to attack and occupy the county town, kidnap the county magistrate, and confiscate the firearms of the army should also be severely punished. Brigade Commander Jin Zhenzhong has been ordered to first transfer two battalions of troops to take the Changmen Guantou steamboat to proceed and act accordingly (22nd).</p>
<h3>Oath of Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee</h3>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Provincial Government was reorganized by Ming Ling, Chairman Lu Dipin had already inspected and took office last Friday. As for the committee members, except for Jiang Bocheng, Zhou Junyan, who also serves as the Director of the Department of Finance, and Zeng Yangfu, the Director of the Department of Construction, who have not yet arrived in Zhejiang, the rest, including Lu Bichou, Chen Bulei, Jiang Xihou, Wang Ying, and Yang Mianzhong, have all arrived in Hangzhou. More than half of the members of the Provincial Government have already arrived. A swearing-in ceremony was held today (the 25th). The Executive Yuan specially appointed Zheng Wenli, President of the High Court, to represent the supervisor. The meeting began at 9:00 a.m. After performing the ceremony, Lu Dipin and others took the oath as usual. Then, Zheng Wenli delivered a speech on behalf of the Executive Yuan, stating that Zhejiang is a land of culture and civilization, and has achieved considerable progress in politics, construction, economy, education, and other aspects through the efforts of successive provincial committees. He hoped that they would continue to promote these achievements and achieve good results in the shortest possible time. Next, Xu Shaodi, the representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, hoping that the new provincial committee would pay attention to the following points: (1) Zhejiang society is extremely stable, but in recent years, it has been affected by the many bandits in neighboring provinces, and the border areas are occasionally disturbed by bandits. It seems that this should be given deep attention. (2) Zhejiang's construction in recent years has been biased towards cities, and has been lost to adding icing on the cake. In the future, it should shift its focus and pay attention to rural construction so that the majority of the people can benefit. Finally, Lu Dipin gave a reply speech. After the ceremony, photos were taken and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Part of Japan's Illegal Pending Cases (6)</h3>
<p>▲Case of Korean Smugglers Destroying Andong Customs Post On May 16, 1930, the Andong Customs seized a large batch of smuggled goods from Korean smugglers, worth approximately 9,700 Customs Gold Units. The smugglers sought revenge and destroyed the river crossing sub-post twice on the 17th. The Japanese police station was nearby but did not stop it. The tax commissioners and Japanese consuls protested and requested that police be sent to guard and protect the customs officers, but the Japanese consul ignored them. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the Japanese ambassador, requesting that the Korean perpetrators be arrested and brought to justice, and that the customs should cooperate with the Japanese consul to crack down on smugglers. On October 5th, when the customs inspectors and patrol team members were performing their duties in uniform at the pier, Japanese police stopped them from proceeding and took away the patrolmen's batons. The customs tax commissioner negotiated with the Japanese consul, who said that it was outside the authority of the customs officials to carry batons. We replied that patrolmen carrying batons for self-defense while performing their duties could not be regarded as outside their authority. The Japanese ambassador was asked to instruct the Japanese consul not to interfere in this matter, which has not yet been resolved. On October 28th, three Japanese men at the Jiangqiao export sub-post of the Andong Customs refused to be inspected by customs officers. Another Korean man beat No. 11 patrolman of the customs for no reason. One of the three Japanese men, named Nozawa, took out a dagger and stabbed No. 12 patrolman in the right arm, and handed the dagger to the Korean rioter, and they fled together. At that time, the Japanese police at Jiangqiao stood by and watched. After the customs officers chased and captured the two thugs, the Japanese police intercepted and released the Korean criminal. No. 12 patrolman was seriously injured and his life was in danger. The tax commissioner protested, but the Japanese consul intended to protect the criminals and demanded that the patrolmen be disarmed. We notified the Japanese ambassador again on December 18th, requesting that the criminals be punished, compensation be paid, and that the Japanese police who released the Korean criminal be punished, but there was no reply.</p>
<p>▲Case of Japanese Garrison Shooting Vegetable Farmers Ning Baochen Beside the South Manchuria Railway On June 2, 1930, Japanese garrison troops encountered pedestrians at a traffic intersection beside the South Manchuria Railway, 2,000 meters south of Changchun Station. They shot and killed Ning Baochen, a farmer who was going to the market to sell vegetables. After investigating the details, the Changchun County Magistrate submitted a request to the Chief of the Municipal Preparation Office to negotiate with the Japanese consul and propose compensation and punishment for the criminals. The Japanese consul replied that there were frequent thefts of telephone lines along the South Manchuria Railway, and that the Japanese soldiers were on guard nearby when Ning Baochen was suspected of stealing, resulting in the shooting. We immediately refuted the Japanese side, stating that Ning Baochen was a good farmer and that there were vegetable baskets and carrying poles beside his body as evidence. How could a good person be accused of theft? We should still investigate and handle the matter according to the previous request, but there has been no reply.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Police Forcibly Seizing Military Supplies Seized by Andong Customs On June 3, 1930, Andong Customs seized 69 pistols, 7,000 bullets, and 138 magazines. Japanese police forcibly took away the seized items and did not issue a receipt. The Japanese consul strongly claimed that the seizure was first made by the Japanese side and should be disposed of by the Japanese side, which was a violation of the agreement between Andong Customs and the Japanese consul on the handling of prohibited items seized at the station in 1921. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiated with the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China. On October 6th, the Chargé d'Affaires replied that the smuggler in this case was currently being tried in the Osaka Court. After the judgment is final, the Japanese consul in Andong will be instructed to return the seized items to the local customs, etc. It has been more than a year now, and the Japanese side has not notified us whether the judgment has been made.</p>
<p>▲Case of the Japanese Police Beating and Humiliating the Army Platoon Attached to Longjing Village for Arresting Gamblers On July 28, 1930, the 1st Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the 13th Brigade of the Army stationed in Longjing Village, Yanji County, sent Platoon Leader Zhang Fengquan with four soldiers to arrest gamblers who were gathering to gamble on the hillside in the city due to local public security concerns. They arrested three gamblers, and the rest fled. Unexpectedly, when they passed in front of the Japanese police station on Da Tong Road, several Japanese policemen suddenly rushed out, intercepted the gamblers, and seized and beat Zhang Lianfu. The battalion commander went to question them, but the Japanese side evaded in every way. It was verified on the spot that Lianfu's uniform was torn and his body was covered with injuries. Lianfu was sent to the hospital for treatment, and the hospital issued a diagnosis of injuries. The Chief of the Yanji Municipal Preparation Office made serious representations to the Japanese consul and issued two notices, proposing conditions such as apology, punishment, compensation, and withdrawal of the police. The Japanese consul verbally replied that it was a misunderstanding. After repeated negotiations, the vice consul agreed to represent the town garrison headquarters to apologize and compensate for the military clothing, medical expenses, and consolation expenses of 50 yuan in Japanese currency, and to punish the Japanese police and strictly warn them in the future, but requested that the official notification be stopped. The matter has not yet been concluded. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>松江</h3>
<p>Nine Counties Joint Defense Office by Provincial Order</p>
<p>Civil Affairs and Security Office: Due to rampant banditry in the Taihu Lake area, it is imperative to coordinate with counties along the Taihu Lake to jointly suppress them, in the hope of achieving complete eradication. The nine counties, including Wu County, Shanghai, Songjiang, Qingpu, Kunshan, Wuxi, and Yixing, have established a Nine Counties Joint Defense Office. The Wu County Magistrate will convene the meeting. Subsequent meetings will be held in rotation on a scheduled basis and the heads of the first, second, and third districts of the Provincial Water Police, along with commanders of various military and police units, will be notified to attend. In case of bandit attacks, they will jointly defend and suppress. This county has received the aforementioned instructions, and the first meeting is scheduled for January 8th. Magistrate Shen will attend at that time to discuss strategies for pacifying the banditry.</p>
<p>Request to Waive Additional Grain Tax by the Property Management Office</p>
<p>The Property Management Office of this county, regarding the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department's Order No. 2103, which imposed an additional two yuan per stone of grain tax on each county for one year, telegraphed the Chairman of the National Government, the Minister of Finance, and the Head of the Provincial Government Finance Department, stating: The additional two yuan grain tax imposed last winter was too heavy a burden on the people. It was requested that it be waived. The Ministry of Finance deeply sympathized and approved it, limiting it to the winter grain tax of the 19th year of the Republic, and stipulating that no further increases should be made after the expiration date. Now, the increase continues, causing great suffering to our people and undermining national trust. Furthermore, this year, Songjiang has suffered from continuous rain disasters, resulting in poor harvests in most of the fields in various districts, and the people are extremely impoverished. Local residents are petitioning the county government to request the higher authorities to allocate and return the borrowed grain silver from previous years within this winter's grain tax according to the original plan to relieve the people's plight. However, the request for repayment has not been approved, and the order to increase the grain tax has been issued directly. Is this the way to show concern for the people? Therefore, we earnestly request that the additional grain tax be waived to uphold national trust and alleviate the people's hardships.</p>

In the future, if there are opinions on the demarcation, they should be presented according to proper procedures and based on reason. Any gatherings or disturbances that obstruct public order will be severely punished according to the law.</p>

<p>Due to the silting of the Baimao Pond in this county, the Construction Department allocated funds for dredging. However, the citizens there opposed the proposed plan A. On the 24th, Qian Dajiu and other representatives of the Zhitang community went to the provincial capital to petition for a change in the plan and to adopt plan B. The Disaster Relief Association, led by Qu Liang, also submitted a request to the department to change the plan, but it was not unanimously agreed upon, and the petition was not yet issued. It is said that if plan A is adopted for the dredging plan, cutting straight through the bend would require passing through the rear of the Fushun Yarn Factory, which has capital of seven to eight hundred thousand yuan. The factory buildings would have to be demolished. Therefore, there is a movement to change the plan. It is said that the previous beating of the surveying team was because the surveyors avoided the yarn factory and occupied other land, which was opposed by the villagers, resulting in the beating. The dispute is currently ongoing, and it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>
<p>Corruption Case of the Education Bureau Accountant Expands</p>
<p>Hua Zhaozeng, the accountant of the Education Bureau of this county, was found to have embezzled public funds amounting to over 18,000 yuan. Director Gao filed a lawsuit with the county, and Hua was arrested and detained. Later, Gao Zilin and eight or nine others provided joint and several guarantees and mortgaged grain fields in Wuxi to secure his release. However, Hua, due to the excessive amount of the embezzlement and his inability to make up for it, absconded without a trace. The county government ordered the original guarantors, including Gao, to hand over the case and repeatedly set deadlines. Gao and others searched for Hua in the Suzhou and Wuxi areas without success. The county government then detained the original guarantor, Gao Zilin, and it has been some time with no clues. The Education Bureau, because Hua's case cannot be closed due to his absence, submitted a request to the county to forward to the Wuxi County government to seize Hua's private land according to the law to prepare for compensation. The county government has already consulted and requested that it be handled accordingly. Now, the detained guarantor Gao Zilin has suddenly reported that Wu Jingping, the current accounting director of the Education Bureau, is suspected of jointly embezzling funds. The reason is that Hua's embezzlement has reached over 18,000 yuan in the past three years. Wu, as the accounting director, has the responsibility to audit at any time. Why did he not report it earlier? It is clear that there is a joint act of corruption. He requests the county government to summon Wu for questioning. It is unknown how the county government will handle this.</p>

<p>Re-election of the County Chamber of Commerce Completed</p>
<p>The county Chamber of Commerce held a re-election on the 10th of this month. Due to the failure to submit the regulations and list of members to the Party headquarters in front of the pavilion, a misunderstanding occurred. After the voting, the ballot boxes were temporarily sealed by the county government. The county Party headquarters and the county Chamber of Commerce separately telegraphed the central and provincial Party headquarters, the Ministry of Industry, and the Construction Department to request instructions. Later, they received a reply ordering the county to investigate and reply. On the 22nd, the Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members and the ballot officials at the time of the voting and invited representatives from the county government and the county Party headquarters to attend to explain the points of misunderstanding. It was decided that the ballot boxes would be retrieved from the county on the morning of the 25th and the ballots would be counted immediately. As a result, Yang Ganxi, Cai Jian San, Qian Fenghao, Chen Jinli, Qian Jingsheng, Yang Huaigu, and Jiang Zhongliang were elected as executive committee members. Mi Junqian, Miao Dongchen, and Shen Xijun were elected as alternate members. Qian Sunqing, Chen Zhanru, and Cheng Jingtang were elected as supervisory committee members. Li Zhongchen and Wu Shimei were elected as alternate members. After the counting was completed, the newly elected executive and supervisory committee members and the remaining executive and supervisory committee members held their first joint meeting to discuss handover matters.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Request Exemption from Export Tax on Chinese Silk</p>
<p>The Silk Factory Association believes that the Chinese silk industry has been failing for decades, and silk merchants have lost most of their capital. The harvest of fresh silkworms in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons of this year has been poor, and silk prices are expensive, which has increased the cost of silk factories. It is estimated that each dan of silk requires 850 taels of silver for silkworm cocoons, plus 200 taels of silver for reeling labor, and about 50 taels of silver for export tax and other miscellaneous expenses. In total, each dan of Chinese silk requires over 1,100 taels of silver, while the highest price in the European and American silk markets is no more than 900 taels. Now, it has continuously fallen to less than 800 taels. At this time of multiple crises and tight finances, each factory wants to mortgage, but there is no money to borrow. All silk merchants are on the verge of bankruptcy. After repeated meetings, everyone agreed that the only way to save the critical situation is to reduce costs. They unanimously advocated for the reduction or exemption of the export tax of 15 taels of silver to comply with the principle of protecting export trade. Yesterday, they specially telegraphed the China General Confederation of Industry and requested it to forward the request to the National Government and the Ministry of Finance and Industry, requesting that the levied export tax on Chinese silk of 15 taels of customs silver be exempted immediately to reduce the cost of Chinese silk and maintain foreign trade.</p>
<p>Amusing Scene of Court Enforcing House Eviction</p>
<p>Guo Yaoqing, the owner of Shenxing Mud Figurine Shop under Qitai Inn on Hanchang Road outside Guangfu Gate, previously rented a house from second landlord Chen Eryu to sell mud figurines and local gluten. The business was doing quite well. This summer, the lease expired, and Guo asked Chen to renew the lease, but Chen refused. For some unknown reason, there were negotiations due to the tip issue, which could not be resolved. Chen then applied to the county court and was approved to send police to the store for enforcement. However, due to improper procedures, the enforcement was not completed and remained pending until now. Recently, Chen applied to the court and was approved to continue the enforcement. Yesterday (the 25th) at around 10 a.m., Court Officer Liu Rongfu, signed by the president of the court, together with judicial police officers Wu Xigeng and Wu Zhenhua, and the neighborhood chiefs Xi Zhiliang, arrived at the store to enforce the eviction strictly. However, Guo's wife, Wang, and daughter, A Yuan, suddenly came out to stop them, leading to a dispute. At that time, the onlookers gathered more and more, and Guo's wife and others suddenly removed their lower clothing and beat copper gongs randomly, causing a crowd to gather, surrounding the police tightly. Guo's daughter and others even stood on stools and gave loud speeches. The patrolling police officers who came to help could not stop them, so the police officers had to take the opportunity to retreat and report back to the court. Subsequently, Clerk Liu Jingan, accompanied by Judicial Police Chief Li Renzhen, went to enforce the eviction but still failed to implement it. They had to return to the court again and reported to President Yang, who went to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Chen and requested him to order the police brigade to send a team to the scene to assist in the enforcement. That night, the Tonghan Town Office sent a letter to the county court requesting a seven-day extension for mediation.</p>

Cao arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and reported to the Student Association. The association also decided to hold a representatives' conference at the Law School at 10 a.m. this morning. If the representatives of each school believe that the petition process was satisfactory, they will order the representatives in Beijing to return to Shanghai. Otherwise, they will order the representatives remaining in Beijing to continue to make demands to the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. According to Jiangnan University representative's statement to the New Sound Press reporter, the petition process to Beijing is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Petition Situation</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, at about 9 a.m., the entire student delegation departed from the New Nanjing Hotel on Zhongzheng Street to the Central Party Headquarters to petition the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee. At 10 a.m., they arrived at the Central Party Headquarters and then went to the Second Conference Room.

Second, the Guanghua representative explained the requirements for the tragedy. Third, the Daxia representative explained the requests to the Central Committee on domestic and foreign affairs. The Law School representative then gave a summary explanation, and the Fudan representatives added supplementary information. Regarding the tragedy, Committee Member Chen Mingshu replied. Regarding domestic and foreign affairs, Committee Member Chen Gongbo replied. After the committee members replied, the Soochow Law School immediately moved the records and read them aloud. The two Chens believed there were no errors and then exited.</p>
<p>▲ Two Committee Members' Replies</p>
<p>The two committee members replied to the following points: A. (1) Regarding the tragedy (Chen Mingshu's reply): The students in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Jinan have already been released. (2) The students in Peiping were transferred to the court because there were dangerous elements and they could not be released immediately. (3) Please investigate the missing persons yourself clearly. The government will definitely not kill students and try to destroy the evidence. B. (1) The government did not predetermine or instigate the tragedy. If there is a need for an instigator, I will take responsibility myself. (2) The military and police handled the situation improperly, and the government should punish them. Within my jurisdiction, I apologize in the name of the Garrison Headquarters. D. The number of compensation fees for the dead can be submitted to the government for discussion and decision. E. The remains of student Wen Shengshi have been returned to Shanghai. F. Regarding this tragedy, the government naturally does not want such things to happen. At the same time, the government also hopes that students will take reasonable and effective actions in the future, and they must abide by the government's order that there should be no more demonstrations in the future. (2) Regarding domestic and foreign affairs (Chen Gongbo's reply): A. Regarding foreign affairs, the students' requests for war against Japan, the implementation of revolutionary diplomacy, the denial of the League of Nations resolution, diplomatic openness, the alliance of oppressed nations, the speedy recovery of lost territories, the announcement of major policies, and the consolidation of national defense have all been discussed by the Central Committee. The students' opinions can be accepted. B. Regarding domestic affairs, such as effectively guaranteeing freedom of speech, association, and publication, guaranteeing mass movements, absolute transparency of finances, implementing budgets and final accounts, and no more civil wars, have all been discussed by the Central Committee. Although the issue of independent educational funding has not been discussed, it should also be implemented. As for determining the way the people participate in politics, the Central Committee has decided on three points: (1) The Supervisory Yuan and the Legislative Yuan will add people's representatives, at least half. (2) Convene a national salvation conference. (3) Convene a people's representative conference. As for punishing those who destroy mass movements, it is decided that those who destroy mass movements will not be allowed to participate in mass movements again.</p>
<p>▲ Supplementary Points</p>
<p>Later, the student representatives supplemented and asked questions, and Chen Gongbo replied as follows: (1) Regarding the time for punishing the murderers and apologizing, he replied that it can be done before the establishment of the new government. (2) Request to send personnel to escort the coffin back to Shanghai and give transportation fees. He replied that it can be done. (3) Order all competent authorities and hospitals not to refuse students' investigations of the dead and wounded. He replied to order the Garrison Headquarters to prepare a letter to inform them. (4) Punish Tao Baichuan of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and Chen Xizeng, the director of the Public Security Bureau. He replied to investigate the case. If there is no case, the intention will be conveyed and the Central Committee will handle it through the Standing Committee. It can be done in about a week. (5) Replace the members of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters. He replied that personnel have been sent for guidance. Finally, at the request of the student representatives, Chen Gongbo solemnly stated that he is absolutely responsible for the points answered. The representatives then delivered a speech and left the meeting, which was already 12:45 p.m.</p>

<h3>Scott Undergoes a Great Shock, Yuehua Almost Defeats Strong Enemy</h3>
<p>▲Lost by only one goal with a score of 2:1</p>
<p>▲Fatal wound from penalty kick</p>
<p>Scott Cup Semi-Finals</p>
<p>Yuehua showed an amazing performance yesterday, competing with the British Scott for the Scott Cup semi-final spot. They attacked repeatedly, almost defeating the enemy. They fought fiercely for more than an hour and a quarter, and the score was tied. Unfortunately, in the middle of the second half, they were penalized with a penalty kick, a fatal wound, and were eliminated with a score of 2 to 1. Scott won the semi-final spot.</p>
<p>Scott's Lineup</p>
<p>Mansfield Cohen Gratton Brahma Neil Cameron</p>
<p>Dare Lu Williams Blandon Polden Duran</p>
<p>Yuehua Team's Lineup</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen Lu Zhiming Zhao Aichen Gu Shangxiang Hu Jiwu Wang Shusen</p>
<p>Yang Renjie Wan Xianghua Zhou Shaowen Jiang Chao Chen Chao</p>
<p>▲First Half, 0 to 0</p>
<p>Yuehua kicked off, taking advantage of the wind to attack. They attacked three times, although they did not score, they were not far off. It is a pity that the forwards were slightly slow, and the two wings could have accelerated. Otherwise, the enemy's goal would have been broken long ago. Scott attacked, and Lu Zhongen made every save, showing great skill. He jumped up and down, left and right, catching countless balls. The first half ended with no score for either side.</p>
<p>▲Penalty Kick, Fatal Wound</p>
<p>The second half started again, and Yuehua's defense remained solid. After more than twenty minutes of stalemate, the score was still tied. Williams dribbled straight in, about to reach the goal. Hu Jiwu caught up from behind, and the collision resulted in a foul. Blandon was awarded a penalty kick. Lu Zhongen stood with his arms outstretched in a cross shape, and the ball brushed his waist and went in. Lu caught it, but missed. Yuehua lost the point. Williams charged in, saw Zhao Aichen in front, and shot towards the right corner. Duran, as a surprise soldier, bent over and headed the ball into the lower left corner of the goal.</p>
<p>▲Finally Breaks the Enemy's Goal</p>
<p>The score of 2 to 0 announced disappointment, but Yuehua did not lose heart and continued to advance. With only six or seven minutes left in the game, the army besieged the enemy, shooting again and again, but no one scored. Mansfield responded outside the goal, a great opportunity. Everyone lamented twice and then took the siege. Chen Chao passed the ball, and Jiang Chao, a "steel man" in the crowd, made the score 2 to 1 at the end of the game.</p>
<h3>Senior Cup Semi-Finals Draw Determined Order</h3>
<p>Donghua vs. Western Police Team</p>
<p>The Western Football Association has drawn the order for the Senior Cup semi-finals as follows: (1) Donghua vs. Western Police, (2) Shanghai Team vs. Lincoln. The dates of the matches will be determined later.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke and Others Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Jishen and his party stopped going to Beijing</p>
<p>The Cantonese Committee had an important meeting last night</p>
<p>Cantonese Committee members Li Jishen, Huang Shaoxiong, Zhang Fakui, Zhang Huichang, Chen Ce, and others arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 AM yesterday. At around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Mr. Li Zongren made a special visit to Li Jishen on Luban Road for a long conversation. At 5:00 PM, Li Jishen, Huang Shaoxiong, and Li Zongren held a meeting at the Cangzhou Hotel, and at 5:30 PM, they took a car to the Luoer Hospital in the French Concession to visit Wang Jingwei and express their condolences. Wang expressed that his illness had not yet healed and that he would not be able to go to Beijing for the time being. He hoped that the committee members would go to Beijing first to attend the meeting and promote unification.</p>
<p>Stopping Before Departure: After the committee members visited Wang, they decided to take the night train to Beijing. Mr. Deng Zuyu contacted the station and prepared two special cars. The travelers were scheduled to be Li Zongren, Li Jishen, Huang Shaoxiong, Chen Ce, Zhang Huichang, and Lin Yungai, a total of five people. However, at around 8:00 PM last night, Li and others suddenly received a phone call from Beijing, saying that Committee members Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and Fu Bingchang would come to Shanghai that night to discuss matters. The committee members temporarily stopped going to Beijing and waited to meet with Sun and others before deciding on their next move.</p>
<p>Sun Ke's Remarks: At 11:20 PM last night, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and Fu Bingchang arrived in Shanghai by car with their entourage. Our reporter interviewed Sun Ke in the car and asked about the rumors of misunderstandings during the First Plenary Session. Sun said that the details could be inquired from the Beijing side. When asked when he would return to Beijing to attend the conference, he replied that he would decide after meeting with Wang, Li, and other committee members. The reporter also asked Mr. Li Wenfan, who gave a similar ambiguous response to Sun. After Sun and others returned to their residence, they immediately convened the Cantonese Committee members in Shanghai for an important meeting. Whether they would go to Beijing to attend the meeting would be confirmed today.</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui's Remarks: Zhang Fakui, the commander of the Fourth Army, came to Shanghai yesterday morning on the same ship as Cantonese Committee member Li Jishen and others. The reporter, knowing that Zhang's ambition was to go north, asked if he would depart alone to aid Heilongjiang. Zhang replied that this matter would not be a problem and that the departure date had not been determined. After disembarking, he visited Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren of the Fourth Group Army at the Cangzhou Hotel at around 2:00 PM to discuss the matter of going north. According to Commander-in-Chief Li, Zhang expressed to him that he did not want to go to Beijing. However, it is unknown whether Zhang did not want to go to Beijing because of his ambition to go north or for other reasons. After visiting Commander-in-Chief Li, Zhang visited Wang Jingwei at around 3:00 PM and expressed his willingness to resolutely go north to aid Heilongjiang and expressed his condolences for Wang's illness. It is said that Wang greatly supported Zhang's going north. Zhang, while planning his departure, decided not to go to Beijing and would leave Shanghai temporarily.</p>

Except for places far from the city that held separate ceremonies, a total of more than 200 representatives attended the meeting at 10:00 AM, performing the rituals as usual.

All agencies under the Shanghai County government, in addition to the county Party department holding a meeting in the morning to commemorate the event, were notified by the county government in advance not to stop regular office work. Therefore, they all worked as usual yesterday.</p>

<h3>Japanese Intrigue to Invade China</h3>
<p>How should Chinese people respond?</p>
<p>The large-scale Japanese invasion of the Northeast is an organized move. Our reporter met a friend from a Japanese trading company yesterday, who gave a detailed account of the matter. Because it has a major relationship with international and Sino-Japanese negotiations, the key points are divided and recorded below for those who are concerned about national affairs.</p>
<p>Declare the Assets of Japanese Merchants: Before the September 18th Incident, Japanese merchants in various parts of China had already received secret orders from the Japanese authorities, instructing them to compile a list of all the assets of Japanese people in China and the instruments used by Japanese commercial firms in China, regardless of value or size, and send them to the Japanese consulates in various places. Initially, the Japanese merchants did not know the purpose. After the Japanese soldiers forcibly occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, the Japanese consulates again ordered the Japanese expatriates in China to revise and correct the list of assets and goods, estimate them at current market prices, and submit them to the consulates as a basis for future negotiations and claims after the rupture between the two countries and the withdrawal of Japanese expatriates. The Japanese merchants in Shanghai are rushing to create this list. This shows one aspect of the Japanese people's intentions.</p>
<p>Pre-store Emergency Cash: The Japanese also know that our country will inevitably resist, and economic severance will be difficult to avoid. Various Japanese commercial firms and spinning factories in China have received secret telegrams from Japan and Tokyo, instructing the various Japanese factories and major companies to store at least six months' worth of total cash expenditure in their treasuries in terms of economics, so as not to be subject to cash pressure when an unfortunate rupture occurs between the two countries, and to keep it for special purposes. Since September, the Japanese merchants in this area have been hoarding large sums of cash and are not allowed to spend it, but must use it as a temporary emergency fund.</p>
<p>Ships must be left for expatriates: Since the end of September, Japanese ships in China have not been operating because the losses have been huge. Therefore, the first batch of orders was issued by the Japanese government to reduce the number of ships in each route by half. The second time, after repeated requests from various shipping companies, it was ordered that all routes in areas where Japanese expatriates had already withdrawn should continue to be suspended. Now the Japanese authorities have issued another order to China that Japanese ships must operate as usual in places where Japanese expatriates have not yet withdrawn, even if they are empty, and must not stop. It is also heard that Japanese ships staying in China are no longer allowed to stop, because of the international secret work involved. The number of confidential telegrams between Japanese companies and Japan has increased dramatically. The distribution of this report is not allowed to be handled by Chinese partners.</p>
<p>Delegates to Japan Will Return: A delegation of Japanese people from all over China, led by A Duan Gongchi and others, who were elected by the General Assembly of Japanese People in China to return home to petition, has reported to their government authorities on the boycott of Japanese goods and the plight of Japanese merchants in China, and has submitted a new strategy for China. It was reliably learned yesterday that the delegates are actively engaged in activities in Tokyo and have received assistance from the Japanese authorities. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Conflict Erupts Among Workers at the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>Failure to take over the union</p>
<p>Causing a serious dispute</p>
<p>The workers of the printing plant of the Commercial Press had been dissatisfied with Yang Youren and Wang Changyuan's plan to reorganize the union, which had been brewing for a long time. On the 10th of this month, all the workers of the factory automatically convened a meeting, unanimously decided to take over the branch office, and elected 25 representatives to temporarily preside over the union's affairs, which had been approved by the city's Party department for record.</p>
<p>Ordered to Reorganize: On the 23rd of this month, the city's Party department commissioned Feng Jifang, Ge Hecai, Yuan Shixing, Xu Tongkang, Zhang Fuxiang, Zhang Zhiyi, Kang Jinli, Fan Pusheng, Yang Weisa, Zhu Zhou, Zhang Yuanjie, Ma Weiqun, Zhou Zhicheng, Wang Genfa, Wu Guobao, Huang Jinchun, Zhu Jinkui, Shen Yougen, Tao Renbao, and 19 others to be the reorganization committee of the Shanghai Publishing Industry Workers' Union, and immediately went to take over and carry out the reorganization. At the same time, the Publishing Industry Workers' Union was instructed that its handling of the Great East Book Company's strike was inappropriate, and the Commercial Press workers strongly opposed it, fearing that it would cause a dispute. It was necessary to reorganize, so the union was ordered to stop its activities.</p>
<p>Failure to Take Over: The reorganization committee members, including Kang Jinli, went to take over on the 24th after receiving the order from the city's Party department. However, because Yang Youren and others refused to hand over, the reorganization committee members feared that a conflict would occur, so they did not take over that day and asked the city's Party department for instructions.</p>
<p>Course of the Conflict: The reorganization committee members originally wanted to go to take over peacefully again yesterday, but because they saw a higher-level announcement, they feared there would be a misunderstanding, so they went to the city's Party department to ask for instructions on how to proceed legally. However, at around 5:00 PM, union members Yang Youren and Wang Changyuan led dozens of people and waited at the entrance of the Commercial Press, carrying a white cloth in their left hands with the words "Shanghai Publishing Industry Union Maintenance Team" written on it. At 5:15 PM, when Hu Jinshan, a representative of the Commercial Press union, left the factory after work, Yang Youren and Wang Changyuan ordered the maintenance team to stop Hu and tie him up. Hu shouted for help. At that time, various departments were getting off work, and most of the workers saw Hu being tied up and stepped forward to dissuade them, which led to a conflict. The maintenance team used iron rods and wooden sticks to beat the workers, causing injuries to workers Xiong Kunrong, Wang Alin, Bao Baolin, and several others. When the workers saw Yang and Wang leading the crowd to beat people, they reported to the Fifth District Police Station. The Fifth District immediately sent Inspector Gao and several policemen to maintain order. At that time, the workers' side captured more than ten assailants. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the maintenance team sent someone to the Huzhou Guild Hall Military and Police Joint Office to report that Communists were rioting in the Commercial Press and asked them to send a team to suppress them quickly. After receiving the report, the office immediately reported to its superiors and sent a team of soldiers to suppress the riot. They arrested eight Commercial Press workers, including Hu Jinshan, Xu Tongkang, Bao Xianhe, Bao Yunde, Huang Yunqing, Li Ahua, Jiang Guoli, and Che Quxian, and took them to the Huzhou Guild Hall for questioning. Hu Jinshan and others explained the situation to the officer in charge of the military and police office and presented the instructions from the city's Party department, stating that they were not Communists. At the same time, the Fifth District also sent personnel to prove that they were Commercial Press workers. Then, Hu Jinshan and others were taken back to the Fifth District and temporarily detained in the station for submission to the authorities for review.</p>
<p>Workers' Indignation: The workers of the factory were extremely indignant at Yang, Wang, and others' actions and have already submitted a request to higher authorities for fair disposal.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Workers Went on Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Oppose the Dismissal of Workers and Request an Explanation</p>
<p>▲Resumed Work After Negotiations, Then Struck Again</p>
<p>▲All Workers Petitioned the Chinese Chief Inspector</p>
<p>The British Public Bus Company, previously declared the dismissal of all old conductors due to a strike, which was ineffective after negotiations by Chinese directors and party-state organs, resulting in mass unemployment. The newly recruited conductors were just fully trained, and public buses on all routes had just recently resumed normal service. Yesterday, they went on strike to oppose the company's dismissal of conductor number one and a failed request for bail on yesterday morning. After negotiations, they resumed work, but in the afternoon, they went on strike again, causing all public buses on all routes to completely stop running and creating disturbances. A detailed account obtained by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲General Strike - Conductor Zhang Yun, number one, was serving on a route one bus on December 15. Due to the extreme crowding of passengers, and while traveling to the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road, a female passenger boarded the bus. By the time the bus reached Peng Road, due to time constraints, it was not possible to sell a ticket. A plainclothes Russian ticket inspector boarded the bus and, due to language barriers, suspected fare evasion, leading to an argument. The inspector then reported to the company, believing it to be fare evasion. After investigation, it was confirmed, and he was immediately dismissed. Yesterday morning at six o'clock, the conductor reported the incident to all conductors in front of the company gate on Connaught Road. Upon learning of this, the Gordon Road police station dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives, who arrested the conductor and took him to the police station. Upon seeing the conductor arrested, all 280 conductors immediately went on strike.</p>
<p>▲All Routes Suspended - After all the conductors went on strike, although drivers, ticket inspectors, and clerks all continued to work as usual, the company had no choice but to suspend public buses on all routes due to the lack of conductors to sell tickets. These routes include route one, from Jing'an Temple to the Racecourse;</p>
<p>route two, from Er Yang Jing Bridge to the Racecourse; route four, from Xujiahui to the Airport; route five, from San Mao Ge Bridge to the North Railway Station; route six, from the Racecourse to Lan Road; route seven, from Caojiadu to Nanyang University; route nine, from Jing'an Temple to the Electric Light Plant; route ten, from Caojiadu to Yinxiang Port, and the AC express bus. Buses originally scheduled to leave the factory at 6:00 AM were stopped from leaving.</p>
<p>▲Vehicles Damaged - At 9:00 AM yesterday, during the conductors' strike, a Korean ticket inspector from the company, number ten, took on the role of selling tickets and drove bus number one to maintain transportation. When it reached the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Yanping Road, striking conductors saw this and considered it a violation of the strike discipline. They attempted to persuade him, but because the ticket inspector insisted on refusing, he was beaten by the crowd and injured in the eye. A piece of the bus's glass was also smashed before it eventually drove back.</p>
<p>▲Resumption Negotiations - After all the conductors went on strike, they sent six representatives—numbers two, six, fifteen, one hundred and fifty-two, two hundred and twenty-six, and two hundred and thirty-five—to the company to ask the manager to find a way to release the arrested conductor number one. The transportation director, Cheatham, advised the representatives to tell the conductors to go back to work peacefully. As for the arrested conductor, the company would be responsible for bailing him out from the Gordon Road police station at 2:00 PM. All the conductors were satisfied and returned to work as usual. As a result, public buses on all routes left the factory at 10:30 AM and operated as usual.</p>
<p>▲Strike Resumed - By 1:30 PM, the conductors had not yet seen the company bail out the arrested conductor. They inquired with the company and learned that the police station refused to release him because the conductor was suspected of inciting a labor movement and being reactionary, and they were taking fingerprints and preparing to hand him over to the First Special District Court for trial. The crowd was extremely angry and immediately went on strike again. Buses on routes one, nine, and ten stopped running at 2:00 PM due to the conductors' strike and returned to the factory one after another. Routes five, six, and seven stopped running and returned to the factory at 3:00 PM. Route four stopped running and returned to the factory at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲Workers' Meeting - At 3:00 PM yesterday, all the conductors held a general meeting at Caojiadu Zhaoji Primary and Secondary School, attended by over 200 people, to discuss how to proceed. First, the chairman reported on the situation, and then the discussion began. The following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) demand that the company immediately bail out the arrested conductor Zhang Yun, number one; (2) restore his job; (3) refrain from dismissing workers without reason in the future; (4) all workers petition the Chinese Chief Inspector Yao Zengmo. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲General Petition - After the meeting, all the conductors hired two cargo trucks from the China Carrying Company in Caojiadu and went together to the residence of Yao Zengmo, the Chinese Chief Inspector of the Public Concession, to petition for assistance: (1) find a way to release the arrested conductor Zhang Yun, number one; (2) restore Zhang Yun's original job. It is reported that the outcome of the petition was quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>▲Maintaining Traffic - The company's transportation director, Cheatham, advised some conductors inside the company on Connaught Road yesterday at 4:00 PM to continue working as usual. To maintain traffic, at 4:45 PM, Russian drivers shortened route one from Jing'an Temple to the Racecourse to Old Racecourse Road, and route nine from Jing'an Temple to the Electric Light Plant to Tilanqiao, operating a total of ten buses. However, they returned to the factory at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲Temporary Precautions - After the British Public Bus Company conductors went on strike, Ren Leping, the district chief of the Sixth District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, dispatched six long-term police officers to be stationed in front of the company gate on Connaught Road to maintain local security and sent a patrol officer to investigate the truth so that it could be reported to the headquarters for review. The Gordon Road police station also dispatched additional armed Chinese police to be stationed in front of the company gate.</p>
<h3>Ma Xiangbo Hosted a Reception for the Directors of the Jiangsu Provincial National Crisis Relief Association</h3>
<p>▲Advocating National Salvation Through Conscience</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a 92-year-old elder from Jiangsu, was extremely indignant after the outbreak of the national crisis. He joined with like-minded individuals to initiate the Jiangsu Provincial National Crisis Relief Association, upholding justice, which is admired throughout the country. Yesterday at noon, he hosted a reception for all the directors and their friends at his residence in Xujiahui, expressing his views. Those who attended included Zhao Zhujun (representing Gongzi Shuyong), Tang Weizhi (representing Gongzi Moubo), Chen Taoyi, Shen Xinqing, Mu Ouchu, Jin Houcheng, Zhu Dexuan, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Huang Renzhi, Zhao Housheng, Zhang Yunbo, Xu Hecheng, Yuan Shuyu, Zhu Qinglai, Jia Jiying, Wu Zhongwen, Chen Binhe, Wang Baolun, Zhu Zhiyao, and more than twenty others. Mr. Ma entertained them with a Western meal and delivered an impromptu speech, saying, "It is our undeniable duty to come forward to provide relief in the face of the national crisis. However, to save the country, we must first save ourselves. The Ten Commandments of Jesus are the best creed for self-salvation. Who doesn't know that opium is a poison, yet warlords everywhere force people to plant opium? Where is the conscience? In the past, the warlord Li Chun claimed that his family property was only six or seven hundred thousand, and people were already shocked. Now, warlords have millions in family property and still don't think it's too much. They shout slogans to overthrow imperialism while using national power to exploit the people. They swear how honest and incorruptible they are while ruthlessly squeezing the land, even worse than the warlords of the past. The old Xikai in Tianjin, previously used immense effort to protect sovereignty, now actually requests that various countries jointly manage it. National sovereignty has been lost to such a point, and the people's livelihood is suffering to such a degree. Many of you have been abroad; what would such a situation be like in a foreign country? I wonder what kind of uproar the people would make. It is pitiful that our people only know how to endure. Only a few of us are speaking here." (At this point, he struck the table with his hand.) Mr. Ma continued, "This place has the historical sites of Xu Wending Gong. At that time, Xu Wending Gong advocated science and research. Unexpectedly, after three hundred years, we Chinese still cannot use our own raw materials to make a watch or a gun. Smoking cigarettes means that tens of millions of dollars are flowing to foreign countries. Besides black soil, there are also red pills. Our general public is still not awakened. We must quickly rise up to save the country, or it will be too late for regrets in the future. Most of you are in your prime; you must work hard, study politics, participate in politics, and supervise politics without the slightest politeness." He also said, "We should show sympathy for the current youth national salvation movement and guide it towards the practical work of resisting Japanese goods. If every citizen pursues national salvation with a conscience, the country will have hope." Mr. Ma's speech lasted for over an hour, and his attitude was extremely impassioned. After he finished, Shen Xinqing, the oldest person present, was publicly elected to express his gratitude, indicating his sincere acceptance. They took a photo and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the First Meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial National Crisis Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial National Crisis Relief Association held its first meeting yesterday. Chu Huiseng, Yin Zhufu, Shen Hengshan, Shen Tianxin, Zhu Duomin, Gao Zibai, Zhu Yisheng, Qu Wenliu, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Shenzhi, and Yao Yongbai were elected as standing directors.</p>
<p>Hu Fengxiang, Zhao Chengzhi, Cha Zhongjian, and Yu Zhongxian were elected as alternate standing directors. The specialized committees of each group were confirmed. The resolutions included: 1. Regarding the Jinzhou Incident, it was resolved to send a telegram to the Central Committee and the National Government, sternly ordering the troops to defend, and to send telegrams to various groups to urge them to do the same. 2. Regarding the proposals of Mr. Wang Jingwei and Mr. Li Xiehe on civil governance, it was resolved to telegraph opinions expressing support. 3. Regarding aviation national salvation, it was resolved to ask the proposer, Mr. Gao Zibai, to submit a detailed plan for further discussion. The telegram texts are as follows: (1) To the Nanjing Central Committee and the National Government: The news of the Jinzhou war is becoming increasingly critical. Enemy troops are advancing step by step. Further retreat will mean the destruction of the country. We urge you to sternly order the troops to defend. The people will not accept the tragedy of national subjugation. May your government consider this. Respectfully, the Zhejiang Provincial National Crisis Relief Association. (2) Omitted. (3) To all members of the Nanjing Central Committee: In recent years, the implementation of party rule has deprived the people of their right to supervise the government, leading to military dictatorship. Internal strife continues, and foreign aggressions multiply. Today, we read in the newspapers that Mr. Wang Jingwei has proposed a national salvation conference, Mr. Li Xiehe and others have proposed implementing civil rights and promoting a constitutional draft, and Mr. Sun Zhesheng and others have simultaneously proposed an outline for a national representative assembly, all advocating the establishment of civil representative bodies to implement constitutional government. This is a crucial method to unite the nation and resist foreign aggression in the face of the national crisis. We hope that all members will quickly pass these proposals together and convene a national representative assembly in the shortest possible time to prepare for constitutional government, thereby recovering the lost hearts of the people. We hope you will act quickly. Respectfully, the Zhejiang Provincial National Crisis Relief Association.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Requests the Hiring of Foreign Aviators</h3>
<p>▲Compelled by Righteous Indignation to Come to China to Serve</p>
<p>▲And Can Attract Friends to Serve</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was approached yesterday by two Canadian technicians (Jones Evons Buiger) who claimed to be skilled in flying airplanes and repairing or manufacturing various mechanical parts. They had participated in the European War in 1917 and, recently, seeing the barbarity of the violent Japanese, disregarding world peace and destroying international treaties, were compelled by righteous indignation to travel across the ocean to serve China. They also stated that there were more than ten of their friends who were skilled in aerial combat and were willing to come to China to serve. If adopted, they could be recruited. It is reported that the association has submitted a request to the government to hire them.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department Presents "A True Record of the Violent Japanese Invasion of the Northeast"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department recently compiled and printed a thick volume titled "A True Record of the Violent Japanese Invasion of the Northeast." The content details the truth about Japan's atrocities in invading our Northeast, the conspiracy to instigate Northeast independence, the process by which the League of Nations handled the Northeast Incident, and international public opinion. The entire book is approximately 180,000 words and over 120 pages, serving as a painful historical record, and is highly suitable for reference by party departments, organs, groups, schools, and people from all walks of life in various places. Those who need to request a copy can attach a one-cent postage stamp and write directly to the Propaganda Section of the Municipal Party Department in Ximen.

<h3>Establishment of a Municipal Central District Construction Fund Custody Committee</h3>
<p>▲Formulating Organizational Regulations</p>
<p>▲The Municipal Government Announces and Implements Them</p>
<p>Since Mayor Zhang took office in Shanghai, he has first focused on the prosperity of the city. Therefore, he has actively promoted the construction of the central district, sparing no effort. Currently, the construction projects in the central district and the main roads have been gradually completed. Other projects, such as municipal districts and residential housing, are also progressing step by step. Therefore, all projects, from beginning to end, have followed the original plan without any interruptions. It is learned that the municipal government, in order to ensure the transparency of construction funds and to strengthen the trust of land owners, has specially organized the Shanghai Municipal Central District Construction Fund Custody Committee to provide a solid guarantee for the funds and to enable the construction projects to be completed in sequence. The organization and regulations are listed below:</p>
<p>▲Organization of the Committee The organization of the committee stipulates that the number of members shall be five, with the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau and the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Central District Construction Committee as ex officio members. In addition, the mayor will hire a local person who is enthusiastic about the city's construction, and landowners will elect two representatives. The five members will then mutually elect two standing committee members to be responsible for the custody of the central district construction funds. The term will be determined by whether the funds are used up or not.</p>
<p>▲Regulations of the Committee The regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Central District Construction Fund Custody Committee are as follows: (Article 1) The Shanghai Municipal Government has established this committee to manage the construction funds in the central area of the city, as listed on the left. (Article 2) The construction funds managed by this committee refer to the proceeds from the sale of land in the central area of the city, excluding the original land price. Other items are not under the custody of this committee. (Article 3) The committee will have five members, distributed as follows: (A) the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau; (B) the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Central District Construction Committee; (C) a local person who is enthusiastic about the city's construction, hired by the mayor; (D) two representatives elected by landowners. (Article 4) The committee will have two standing committee members, mutually elected by the members. (Article 5) The construction funds shall not be used for any other purpose other than for the construction of the central area of the city and shall not be disbursed without the resolution of this committee. (Article 6) The custody authority of this committee shall not change until the construction funds are used up. (Article 7) The status of revenue and expenditure of the construction funds shall be reported to the municipal government monthly for record. (Article 8) Detailed rules for the operation of this committee will be formulated separately. (Article 9) These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any incomplete matters. (Article 10) These regulations shall be implemented from the date of announcement by the municipal government.</p>
<p>▲Notice to Landowners The committee regulations stipulate that landowners may elect two representatives as members of the committee to jointly manage the funds. Yesterday, the landowners were notified of the progress of the committee's organization and were urged to elect two people as members of the committee as soon as possible to ensure early establishment.</p>
<p>▲Secretary-General's Remarks According to Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, who stated to the New Voice News reporter yesterday, Mayor Zhang is striving to promote the prosperity of the city and is doing his best to promote the construction of the central district. He will also do his best to promote anything that can increase the benefits of the central district. Now, the municipal government, fearing that citizens may be apprehensive about the instability of the political situation, has specially organized the Central District Construction Fund Custody Committee to consolidate the guarantee of the funds, with the aim of ensuring that the construction projects will not be affected by other issues and that the landowners can strengthen their trust.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Representatives Petitioned the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>▲Regarding the Arrest of Rice Industry Employees by the Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>▲Secretary-General Yu Agreed to Provide Protection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association previously inspected the Yuanchangxin Rice Shop and took the shop's partner, Chen Dexiang, along with the account books to the association. Subsequently, the Bean and Rice Industry Association held a meeting to provide assistance and negotiated with the Anti-Japanese Association, stating that Chen Dexiang was innocent. The Anti-Japanese Association immediately released Chen and returned all the account books. The Bean and Rice Industry Association also resolved to elect Zhu Zixiang, Jiang Zisheng, Chen Zixian, and Li Yukun to join Chairman Ye Huijun in petitioning the municipal government to provide protection. Yesterday afternoon, Ye and others went to the municipal government to request this. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun personally came out to meet them and agreed to provide protection. Ye and others then left.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>▲Regarding Anti-Japanese National Salvation</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement yesterday regarding anti-Japanese national salvation, stating, "Upon investigation, there have been two Anti-Japanese Associations in Shanghai. 1. After the May 3rd Massacre in 1928, various circles in Shanghai had the organization of the Shanghai Special Municipality and the Anti-Japanese Military Violence Committee. At that time, the chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce was Mr. Feng Shaoshan. The General Chamber of Commerce had successively sent representatives to attend the meeting and appointed members to participate in the National Salvation Fund Custody Committee of the Anti-Japanese Association at that time. Later, the May 3rd Massacre negotiations were resolved, and the Anti-Japanese Association was changed to the National Salvation Association. Therefore, if the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has any acts of corruption, private embezzlement, kidnapping, extortion, and never discloses its accounts, then the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce, which sent representatives to participate in the Anti-Japanese Association at that time and later changed to the National Salvation Association, cannot but bear its responsibility, and it is completely unrelated to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, which was formally established on June 22, 1930. 2. The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee, organized after the Wanbaoshan Massacre this year, had 37 committee members. After the outbreak of the Liaoning Incident, it was reorganized by the All Circles Citizens Representative Assembly at the Public Stadium into the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, with the committee members increased to 61, which is still continuing. Whether there is corruption, private embezzlement, kidnapping, and extortion, the association will be responsible for it. It is reported that the accounts of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee have long been transferred to the Shanghai Accountants Association for members to review. The current revenue and expenditure are entrusted by the Standing Committee of the Association to Accountant Xu Zuozuo to directly send members to the meeting for processing. The detailed situation should also be answered by the association, and the method of confusing the public with falsehoods should not be used to blame the current Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. In short, the Shanghai Special Municipality Anti-Japanese Military Violence Committee and the National Salvation Association in 1928, and the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee and the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in 1931, each have their own organizational period and responsible personnel. The former's meeting address was in the former Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce, and the latter's meeting address was on the old site of Tianhou Temple. The former's committee members were organized by representatives from various groups, such as the former Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce, and the latter's committee members were mutually elected by representatives from all circles. The names are similar, but the reality is different. Documents and facts can prove it. It is impossible to condemn people with ambiguous and general words. As for my service in the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, I have always adhered to the purpose of saving the country and protecting businesses without any bias. All sacrifices that can be avoided are fought for. For example, extending the date for registering Japanese goods, reducing donations for transporting and selling Japanese goods, and finding ways to dispose of sealed Japanese goods, etc. The facts are all there and can be reviewed. The same is true for the other members of the business community who participated in the association. However, since the association is organized by all circles, all actions should be decided by the common will of all circles and cannot be decided solely by the business community. This is something that cannot be ignored by those who can clearly distinguish the nature of the association. Because I saw the Second Declaration of the Businessmen's Movement Committee, which contained words such as corruption, private embezzlement, kidnapping, and extortion by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and Feng Shaoshan, chairman of the Businessmen's Movement Committee, also stated on the 21st when hosting the press, that the accounts of the Anti-Japanese Association and the National Salvation Association have never been made public, I hereby make the above statement based on the facts."</p>
<h3>News of the Yong'an Textile Mill Tragedy Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Municipal Government Instructed on How to Handle It</p>
<p>▲Court Ordered the Arrest of Union Executives</p>
<p>Since the tragedy occurred at the Yong'an Textile Mill on Yunzao Road in Wusong on the evening of the 20th of this month, yesterday was the sixth day of the strike. The mill remains heavily guarded. The news from various sources is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>▲Union Meeting The negotiating committee organized by the workers of the Yong'an No. 2 Mill held its first meeting at the Eighth District Party Department yesterday, attended by all fifteen committee members, including Shen Yongming, Jin Yaowen, and Wang Mingzhi. Jin Yaowen chaired the meeting. As a result of the discussion, regarding the workers who were shot and killed by the capitalists, the deceased will be given preferential treatment, the injured will be reimbursed for medical expenses, and the murderers will be severely punished. Regarding the strike issue, a request will be submitted to the higher authorities to strictly order the resumption of work to support the livelihood of the workers. As for the injured workers Li Lunyin and Yang Fengdi, they are still being treated at Haibin Hospital, and their condition has not improved.</p>
<p>▲Municipal Government Instructions The municipal government instructed the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of instructing the Eighth District Cotton Textile Industry Union to report that the workers of the Yong'an Textile Mill No. 2 were angered by the oppression of the capitalists and spontaneously went on strike on the evening of December 19 to urge the capitalists to realize their mistakes. However, according to the company's report, the workers gathered and destroyed the factory, please stop them. Now, the original report from the company is enclosed, along with the union's vice report. Please cooperate with the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and handle the matter and report back. This is an order."</p>
<p>▲Municipal Government Handling After receiving the reports from the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, the municipal government decided to handle the case separately, with a total of three measures: (1) Regarding the labor-capital dispute over the year-end bonus, the Social Affairs Bureau will handle the mediation; (2) Regarding the deaths and injuries, the court will handle the matter in accordance with the law; (3) Before the factory resumes work, the Public Security Bureau will send police to protect the factory.</p>
<p>▲Workers Arrested At around 10:00 AM yesterday, Xu Guoguang, Zhou Qiwu, and two other bailiffs from the Shanghai District Court arrived in Wusong with warrants to arrest the union's executive committee member Shen Yongming and committee members Shen Yuelin, Shen Yongqing, Jin Yaowen, Xu Er'e, Yan Mao'san, Wang Mingzhi, and Li Wenjin. Shen Yongming refused, stating that since it was an arrest warrant, the competent Public Security Seventh District First Station must be notified to come together to be lawful. The bailiffs then reported to the Seventh District First Station, and Station Chief Zeng went with the bailiffs. Wang Guoping, a member of the Eighth District Party Department, also rushed to the scene after hearing the news. After inquiring about the reasons, Shen Yongming went to the police station with the bailiffs. It is reported that the reason for the arrest was that the factory director accused Shen and others of robbery. Therefore, the workers believed that the factory was intentionally framing them and requested the authorities to handle the matter impartially.</p>
<p>▲Defense Corps Statement According to Tang Chengzong, head of the Wusong Defense Corps, "Yesterday's newspaper reported that in the Yong'an tragedy, the union's resolution included a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps Reorganization Committee to revoke the Yong'an Defense Corps, and the declaration mentioned that the Defense Corps shot and killed workers, which is shocking. Upon investigation, no one from the Defense Corps was present at the time of the tragedy, which was witnessed by thousands of workers. Moreover, the Defense Corps members in the factory only have one platoon, all equipped with rifles, while the injured workers were all hit by pistol bullets. Furthermore, the Defense Corps has never interfered in the disputes between the factory and the workers. We have already stated to the union that it was a misunderstanding."</p>

<h3>The Great Fire at Qichang Warehouse</h3>
<p>▲ Jardine Matheson Warehouse Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>▲ 5,000 Bales of Cotton Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>▲ Losses Exceed 500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>A major fire broke out at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong at approximately 5:00 PM yesterday. Over 500,000 yuan worth of cotton, stockpiled inside Warehouse H along the Pudong waterfront, was completely consumed. The steel-framed and iron-plated structure of the warehouse roof and upper levels was also completely destroyed. The fireground covered an area of at least 6,000 square yards, making it the largest fire in Shanghai this year. The cause of the fire is still unknown and under investigation. After the fire started, the customs launch and Shanghai Municipal Council fire engines connected hoses in the Huangpu River and tried their best to extinguish the blaze. However, due to the intensity of the cotton fire, even as this newspaper goes to print this morning, the fire is still not extinguished.</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Outbreak: The Qichang Warehouse is managed by the British firm Jardine Matheson and is located across from the Yangshupu Wayside Wharf on the Huangpu River, covering a vast area. To its right is the Japanese Mitsui Wharf. Warehouse H, which was destroyed, is near the southeast Mitsui Warehouse. The fire reportedly started around 4:45 PM. At the time, laborers were still busy loading and unloading goods on the wharf, going back and forth. How the fire brewed and started went unnoticed until the sound of cracking explosions came from the cotton piles, signaling the start of the disaster. In an instant, flames filled the building, and the acrid smell spread everywhere, becoming uncontrollable.</p>
<p>▲ Watching the Fire from Across the River: The flames could be seen from Puxi about half an hour after the fire started. Because it was not yet dark and the setting sun was shining across the river, the fire was not very noticeable. However, as the sun set and dusk deepened, watching the fire from across the river became strikingly clear. People crowded along the wharves in the Yangshupu area, looking east. They saw a red glow on the opposite bank, reaching into the sky. The flames seemed to break through the darkness. In the sky-high red light, the black silhouette of a large ship was visible. Because the fire provided a backdrop, the ship's bow, stern, smokestacks, and masts stood out sharply, like a black-and-white photograph against a red background. As the fire grew stronger, the red light grew larger, and the ship's silhouette became clearer. The reporter, at the time, was crossing the river in a small sampan. The bright moon shone directly into the river. Leaning against the railing, seeing this strange fire scene, I couldn’t help but feel sympathy, but it was just like being in a movie. By the time the boat landed, looking up, all that could be seen were flames shooting upward, and the warehouse roof had been completely burned through.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Fireground: The warehouse is about twenty yards from the river. Intersecting hoses were laid along the ground, making it difficult to walk. Approaching the warehouse, the firelight burned the face, and the heat was scorching. Many firefighters were seen working hard to spray water. Looking closely, the entire building was ablaze, with flames darting around and squeezing through any opening. The upper level of the warehouse had glass walls. After the firefighters broke them, looking inside, the steel frames and iron plates were burning red and transparent. Those that had been burning for a long time were gradually bending and drooping. Straight steel bars instantly turned into arcs, then into angles, and then the roof completely collapsed. The warehouse was full of cotton bales, which were rectangular. At first, they were stacked neatly. After catching fire, flames spread around, and the distant flames formed a flat, straight line. After burning for a long time, the cotton bales turned charred black. The layers stacked upon layers looked like rows of large coal blocks. The steel warehouse was like a giant furnace. It was not easy for firefighters to fight the blaze. The fire was strong, and the water was weak. A white line of water shot into the flames and immediately disappeared. Therefore, the onlookers referred to the firefighters spraying water with hoses as "pouring sesame oil," which was quite accurate, but also quite inappropriate. The foreign manager of the Qichang Warehouse watched the fire on the scene, tirelessly. A Western firefighter, his face covered in soot, came panting, asking the manager for a cigarette. The manager laughed and patted him on the shoulder, saying, "Good luck, and a happy Christmas to you."</p>
<p>▲ Significant Losses: In addition to a large amount of cotton, the warehouse also stored machinery and other miscellaneous items. The cotton, besides the older stock, was unloaded from the "Vospernk" ship, which was docked at the wharf. The ship arrived the day before yesterday morning. Due to the urgency of unloading, work continued yesterday despite it being the Western winter solstice. The "Vospernk" came from New York, and the cotton was American-made, with long and strong fibers, but also highly flammable. When the fire broke out, over five thousand of the seven thousand bales of cotton on the ship had already been put into the warehouse. With each bale valued at a hundred taels, the losses are around 500,000 yuan, not including the value of the warehouse itself. Warehouse H, which was destroyed by the fire, was built two years ago. The goods stored in the warehouse were reportedly insured against fire. The "Vospernk," which carried the cotton, is an American Poncbanderline ship, managed by the Baohe Foreign Firm in Shanghai. When the fire broke out, a large detachment of Japanese Marines was deployed on the adjacent Mitsui Wharf to guard the area. The soldiers carried boxed pistols and maintained a serious posture. Any Chinese person who stepped onto the wharf was sternly waved away. This kind of fire prevention might be considered excessive.</p>

<p>▲ Municipal Bureau Officials Assigned to Lead</p>
<p>The League of Nations has designated a group of experts to form a mobile film education survey team to inspect China.

<p>▲ Starting Today: Starting at 8:00 AM this morning, personnel designated by the Municipal Government and various bureaus will accompany Mr. Satoda and the cameraman to take the public utility bureau’s ferry at the Bund copper man wharf on the Great Road, and film the situation of the ferry, the Takahashi Garden, and the oil pond, etc. The 27th is a Sunday, so there will be no filming.

<h3>Huang Chu Jiu’s Mortgage Case in Fuxing Fang During His Lifetime</h3>
<p>▲ Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai Personally Appear in Court to Mediate</p>
<p>▲ Paying the Plaintiff with 180,000 Taels as Compensation</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Riye Bank, there were over 10,000 creditors with debts totaling over 3 million. Since accountant Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng started the liquidation, there have been some clues, but the branches are growing, people owe people, and the debts are complex. Recently, Chen Zaifeng of the Tonghui Company filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court because Huang Chu Jiu, during his lifetime, mortgaged the leased land and buildings of Fuxing Fang on Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession to the Tonghui Company through Chen Zaifeng for 200,000 taels. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Presiding Judge Li Mo first attempted mediation in the mediation court. Mediator Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, liquidator accountant Pan Zhaobang, plaintiff Chen Zaifeng's lawyer Peng Qi, Huang Chu Jiu's family member Huang Xianyao's representative lawyer Tan Yigong, and landlord Xi Huixian's representative lawyer Wu Zhiping were all present. First, Chen Zaifeng stated that the buildings on Zhejiang Road in Fuxing Fang were built on leased land, and Huang Chu Jiu, during his lifetime, entrusted him to mortgage them to the Tonghui Company for 200,000 taels. Since Huang Chu Jiu's death last winter, the principal and interest have not been repaid, and the rental income is not enough to pay off the annual land rent of 72,000 taels, of which more than 80,000 taels have already been advanced. Therefore, he requested a prompt judgment for compensation. Liquidator accountant Pan Zhaobang then stated that the buildings had been auctioned off twice, and someone was only willing to buy them for 60,000 taels. Because the difference was so great, the sale was not completed, and no one has inquired about them since. Then, Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai repeatedly advised all parties and proposed that the buildings be valued at a maximum of 180,000 taels, and the landlord Xi Huixian would pay this price back to Chen Zaifeng of the Tonghui Company. Although Chen clearly lost 44,500 taels, if this were not resolved, Chen's losses would be even greater. Although Chen repeatedly objected at the time, he finally nodded after repeated persuasion from Yu and Wang. At that time, liquidator Pan Zhaobang stated that although this method was very satisfactory, the creditors of Riye Bank were mostly poor depositors with large debts. Therefore, Huang's family members must publish an announcement in the newspaper to see if there is a higher price to buy the buildings within five days. This was agreed upon by all parties, and it was approved that Huang's family members would publish an announcement in the newspaper before a final decision was made, and then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Shooting Between Police and Thieves at Chujiaqiao</h3>
<p>▲ Two Thieves Escape from the Crowd</p>
<p>▲ Merchants and Residents Are Greatly Frightened</p>
<p>Xu Fukang, a local, used to run the Quanyuan Pawnshop on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, accumulating considerable wealth. Recently, due to the rebuilding of the building there, Xu moved the shop to 150 Min Tini Yin Road, the corner of North Chujiaqiao, greatly expanding its scale. At around 8:40 PM last night, two robbers suddenly arrived, using pawns as an excuse, pulled out pistols, and warned against making noise. They were about to climb over the fence and enter the counter when one of the shop assistants, who was very alert, quickly turned off the light switch, and the shop was completely dark. The two thieves, knowing that things were not going well, quickly retreated. The shop assistants chased after them, shouting for help. A French police officer, No. 213, happened to be standing there. Hearing the alarm, he raised his rifle and chased after the two thieves. The two thieves also pulled out their guns and returned fire. The two sides fired more than ten shots in total. For a time, bullets flew across Chujiaqiao. Shops closed their doors one after another, and pedestrians fled in panic. Nearby detectives also gathered after hearing the alarm. As a result, the two thieves took the opportunity to blend into the crowd and escaped without a trace. The police also dispatched many detectives to various key points to conduct a thorough inspection of pedestrians. Residents in the area were thoroughly frightened.</p>
<h3>Municipal Ferry Service Between Dongmen Road and Lujia Du Starts</h3>
<p>▲ Starting at 5:00 AM on the 24th</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau planned to launch a ferry service from the 16th pier to the opposite bank of the river. The original route was from Dongmen Road on the Puxi side to Dongchang Road on the Pudong side. However, the landing location on the Dongchang Road side was not properly resolved, and it could not be implemented immediately. Recently, residents there requested the opening of the ferry service. After finding that the original public pontoon at Lujia Du in Pudong could be used, the Municipal Government approved the transfer of the No. 7 ferry to start service at 5:00 AM on the 24th of this month. The fare for passengers is set at 5 copper coins per person during the period when workers go to work from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM each morning and afternoon. At other times, it will be 8 copper coins to show preferential treatment to workers. It is said that citizens taking this ferry are very crowded and claim that it is convenient.</p>

<h3>The Dade Steamer Case Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Nantong Fellow Villagers Association's Assistance:</p>
<p>Most of the families of the victims of the Dade Steamer of the Dada Company, which suddenly and carelessly sank in the Qipansha Jiangxin in Hupu, are poor. Since the Dada Company has not yet taken any concrete measures to deal with the aftermath, they have gone to the Nantong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai to request assistance. The Association has established a Relief Committee for the Dade Victims' Families to handle the matter exclusively and has entrusted the Association's legal advisor, Lawyer Ma Junshuo, to handle all legal relief procedures so that the victims' families and survivors can receive adequate compensation. It is reported that the registration office is attached to Lawyer Ma's office at 219 Sichuan Road, north of the YMCA. Dozens of people have already registered, and all victims can go there to register.</p>
<p>▲ Dada Company's Petition:</p>
<p>Dada Company submitted a document to the Navigation Administration Bureau stating that it was requesting the dispatch of special commissioners to inspect the Daqing and other ships to ensure compliance. The company has been operating on the Tonghai routes for more than 20 years. Regarding the equipment and management of the ships, they have all been handled in accordance with the Jianghai Shipping Regulations, and the ships have been inspected by the Customs Maritime Office every year, so there has been no violation. Unexpectedly, serious accidents occurred this year with the Daji and Dade, resulting in huge losses of life and cargo. The company's losses cannot be calculated. The cause of the accidents is clear, but there are various criticisms from all parties, such as inadequate equipment and lack of fire protection. There are many rumors, and misunderstandings are growing. The company is in a serious situation and is enduring great hardship without being able to defend itself. Outsiders are ignorant of the facts, and their influence on the company's future business is huge. Thinking of this, it is difficult to remain silent. The company still has the Daqing, Daxing, and Dahe steamers in normal service. It is necessary to have the relevant authorities conduct a strict inspection of the equipment and management of the operating ships to determine whether they comply with the shipping regulations, what needs to be reformed, and what needs to be added to provide a basis for standardizing operations and silencing rumors. Therefore, we request the Bureau to review and approve the dispatch of special commissioners to conduct a strict inspection of the Daqing, Daxing, and Dahe steamers regarding fire protection equipment, mechanical management, and other aspects. We also request instructions on any matters that need to be reformed or added, and we will comply. Respectfully presented to the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau Director Xi.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Raises Funds for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Southeast Joint Office of the World Red Swastika Society has been established for half a month since the ninth of this month. Branch offices in Hao County, Quanjiao, Xinghua, Wuwei, Shaobo, and Datong have sent letters and telegrams requesting assistance, and the Society is overwhelmed. Therefore, Chen Chaji was sent to the Beijing General Office to request assistance. It is reported that the Beijing General Office has telegraphed that it has agreed to raise 10,000 yuan, which will be undertaken by the benevolent people of the Northern Swastika Society. The Shanghai General Office held a meeting yesterday (the 24th) and also decided to raise 10,000 yuan to be distributed to the disaster areas in Jianghuai and North China. Personnel have been dispatched to various places to conduct on-site investigations. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is still a small contribution. However, it is reported that since the Liaoning Incident occurred in Beijing, the number of disaster victims from the eastern provinces who have gone to Beijing is unknown. The Swastika Society has set up a refugee shelter at the Beijing East Railway Station. It is reported that those who are sheltered are all former well-to-do commoners and property owners who are now living in the shelter and eating porridge.</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in Silver Dollar Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>The exchange rate of silver dollars in Shanghai suddenly plummeted yesterday morning.

The exchange rate for double dimes was 47 copper coins. Compared to the previous day's exchange rate, each silver dollar was short 120 to 130 cash.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Unifies Electricity Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Pudong Baoming Zhenru Three Electric Companies</p>
<p>▲ Reduced Gradually Starting in January of Next Year</p>
<p>The electricity prices of the various electrical companies in the city originally had the lowest price of 18 cents per kilowatt-hour at the Huashang Electrical Company. Since the establishment of the Public Utilities Bureau, the prices have been carefully reduced based on the operating conditions of each company. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was first reduced from 22 cents to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour, and then from 20 cents to 18 cents. The Xianghua Electrical Company was also reduced from 20 cents to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour. In addition, the Pudong Electrical Company has been gradually reduced from 25 cents to 22 cents per kilowatt-hour. The Baoming Electrical Company has been gradually reduced from 25 cents to 21 cents per kilowatt-hour. The Zhenru Electrical Company has also been reduced from 25 cents to 23 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, the Public Utilities Bureau ultimately believed that the prices of the same kind of public utilities operating in the same city area should be consistent. After investigating the Pudong Baoming and Zhenru companies, it was found that since they stopped generating electricity and purchased electricity from the North and South power plants for resale, their costs had been reduced compared to before, and electricity prices could be appropriately reduced. Therefore, in the recently revised contracts with each company, separate regulations for the annual reduction of electricity prices were specified: (A) Pudong side: (1) From January 1, 1932, reduced to 21 cents per kilowatt-hour. (2) From January 1, 1933, reduced to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. (3) Thereafter, if the net profit earned in one year reaches 20% of the total paid-in capital, it will be reduced by another cent in the following year. After two price reductions, it will be reduced to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour. (B) Baoming side: (1) From January 1, 1932, reduced to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. (2) From January 1, 1933, reduced to 19 cents per kilowatt-hour. (3) From January 1, 1934, reduced to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour. (C) Zhenru side: (1) From January 1, 1932, reduced to 22 cents per kilowatt-hour. (2) From January 1, 1933, reduced to 21 cents per kilowatt-hour. (3) From January 1, 1934, reduced to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. (4) From January 1, 1935, reduced to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour. In four or five years, the city's electricity prices will be completely unified, and starting on January 1 of next year, citizens in Pudong, Wusong, and Zhenru will be able to enjoy relatively low-cost electricity.</p>
<h3>Grand Theft of a Top Hat in Court</h3>
<p>▲ A Thief Arrives Bald and Departs Crowned</p>
<p>The District Court of the First Special District conducts its trials publicly. Each day, the civil and criminal courts are exceedingly crowded. Among those present, besides the parties involved, lawyers, officials, and journalists, are those who are wholly unrelated. They enter and exit freely, unhindered. Consequently, petty thieves see this as an excellent opportunity for theft. They boldly enter before the court session begins, either blending into the crowd or standing motionless in a corner, waiting for the opportune moment. When people are not paying attention, they skillfully pilfer top hats. As it is currently the height of winter, almost everyone owns a top hat. Upon entering the court, they are expected to remove their hats as a sign of respect. Thus, they place their headwear on the windowsill or corner of a table. These thieves arrive bald and depart crowned. In the past month, lawyers, detectives, translators, and others have lost dozens of top hats. Each hat is worth over ten yuan, with some valued at twenty or thirty gold pieces. Because these individuals are extremely swift, they have not been apprehended. If this situation continues without prevention, anyone who attends the court wearing a hat risks losing it. This is an unprecedented event in the judicial system.</p>

<h3>Ye Huijun Discusses the Organization of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, rice industry leader Ye Huijun yesterday gave a statement regarding the organization of trade associations in the city. He said, "I previously saw the statement of Feng Shaoshan, chairman of the Commercial Transport Committee, stating that it is very important whether the leaders of trade associations are satisfactory to the merchants of each industry." He also said, "It is regrettable that the trade associations themselves are not yet sound." Reading this, I was deeply shocked. Since the promulgation of the Trade Association Law by the National Government in the nineteenth year of the Republic, trade associations in this city have been reorganized according to the law. Therefore, in the era of the former Shanghai Special City General Chamber of Commerce, its members were called associations, offices, guilds, and federations. In terms of nature, some were purely commercial organizations, some were purely hometown organizations, and some were both hometown and commercial organizations. In terms of area, some included the whole country, some included the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and some were limited to one part of Shanghai. It was truly "not yet sound." Now, all these situations are gone. The scope must be limited to Shanghai, the name must be a trade association of a certain industry, and the number of staff and the term of election are clearly stipulated. They are also registered and licensed by the competent authorities and have their seals issued. As for whether the trade association staff are satisfactory in handling association affairs, only merchants of each industry can take charge according to proper procedures, or order their dismissal and re-election according to laws and regulations. If, as Mr. Feng Shaoshan said, without pointing out the name of the association, arbitrarily slandering, then all trade associations in the city should rise up and correct it. I am also the chairman of the Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association, and I cannot ignore it. As for the business tax rate in this city, the highest rate is three per thousand, which is the lowest in all provinces and cities in the country. All the efforts made by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce are known to all merchants in the city. The City Chamber of Commerce is currently entrusted by the Municipal Finance Bureau to handle the matters of agreement and payment on behalf of the merchants. In terms of procedures and investigation, it is for the convenience of the merchants. Mr. Feng's so-called two percent extraction, the so-called contracting of business tax, I do not know what he saw and said."</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Telegraph Request to Suspend Raw Silk Tax for Five Years</h3>
<p>▲ Further Request to Increase Import Tax on Artificial Silk</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factories Trade Association Committee, Chairman Shen Huachen, telegraphed the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee yesterday, saying, "To the Secretariat of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Nanjing, we believe that the strength or weakness of a country depends on the prosperity or decline of its commerce. Our country is in a precarious autumn, and the fundamental way to rescue it is to support commerce, and especially to promote domestic products and develop foreign trade. Chinese silk has been sold in Europe and the United States for a long history, and it sustains a vast population. Its relationship is extremely important. In recent years, the silk market has declined, and those engaged in this business have lost their fortunes. The reasons for this decline are: First, Japanese silk is competing by suppressing prices and manipulating the European and American markets. Their government also provides tax exemptions and loans for relief, so it is no wonder that their advanced silk industry dominates the world. Second, the silk industry bears too heavy a burden in terms of cocoon costs, reeling labor, and raw silk export taxes, which increases costs and makes it difficult to compete. Third, the domestic silk weaving industry seeks cheap prices and uses artificial silk, which makes natural domestic products increasingly degenerate. Currently, the silk factory industry is facing a bleak future. Those who have been operating in the past have all become sacrifices, and who will enter the vortex of future enterprises? This means that China's silk foreign trade will not only be interrupted. Looking forward to the future, the worries are endless. After repeated discussions by the association, we propose that the government consider that China's silk foreign trade is related to the people's livelihood and the foundation of the country, and approve the temporary exemption of export tax for five years, so as to relieve the suffering of Jiangsu merchants. At the same time, increase the import tax on imported artificial silk, as a radical measure. We remember that in the tenth year of the Republic, the tea industry declined, and the government approved tax exemptions. Today, the silk industry is in greater difficulty than the tea industry, and it is more important to the people's livelihood than the tea industry. At this time, the plenary session is planning to consolidate the foundation of the country and save the people's livelihood. We dare to earnestly present our words and appeal to the plenary session to include it in the agenda and request the National Government to order the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Jianghai Customs to suspend the collection of raw silk export tax for five years from now and increase the import tax rate on artificial silk, so as to maintain domestic products and benefit the people's livelihood. We are extremely grateful and await orders." Committee of the Shanghai Silk Industry Association</p>

<h3>Jing'an Temple Involved in Litigation Again</h3>
<p>▲ Zhiwen Sues Zhifa</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple is one of the major Buddhist temples in Shanghai. Since the passing of Abbot Zhanggui, his disciples and grandchildren have been involved in lawsuits over the issue of the abbot, which has lasted for about ten years. Recently, the monk Zhiwen sued Zhifa in the civil court of the First Special District for the abbotship of the temple. Zhiwen and Zhifa are both disciples of the former Abbot Liugen, and Liugen is the grandson of Zhanggui. The two parties first filed lawsuits against each other in the criminal court, with no less than five or six cases. After mediation by the court, the lawsuits were withdrawn. Now, Zhiwen has filed a civil lawsuit against Zhifa for occupying the abbotship. Yesterday morning, Civil Judge Zhou Daren held a hearing in the eighth civil court. Zhiwen's attorney, Chen Zemin, appeared in court, while Zhifa did not. Zhifa's attorneys, Jiang Baoli and Wu Chengyu, appeared on his behalf, stating that Zhifa is currently ill and bedridden and therefore cannot attend the hearing today. Moreover, all the evidence needs to be collected by Zhifa, so they requested a postponement. They then presented the prescription to the court. Zhiwen claimed that after his master Liugen retired, he became the abbot. Zhifa is his junior brother. In March of this year, he became ill and went out for recuperation. Therefore, local people held a meeting and, with his consent, Zhifa acted as his agent. After he recovered from his illness and returned to the temple, Zhifa not only refused to hand over the position but also expelled him, leaving him nowhere to live. He is now living as a guest in a certain temple. He requested that Zhifa be ordered to return the position. Attorney Jiang Baoli claimed that Zhiwen was expelled by local people for violating the precepts and stealing temple property. A meeting was convened and Zhifa was publicly elected as the abbot. His master, the monk Liugen, also published a statement in the newspaper expelling Zhiwen for his bad conduct and denying him as a disciple. There is evidence of this, which will be presented at the next hearing. He asked the judge to look at Zhiwen's face to know his true nature. Judge Zhou then announced that the case would be postponed to January 11th next year.</p>
<h3>Divorced Concubine Cares for Three Sons</h3>
<p>▲ Seeking to See Them for Fear of Abuse</p>
<p>Cheng Yuzhen, a woman from Suzhou, recently hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a lawsuit in the First District Court requesting custody of her children. Cheng was taken as a concubine by Shen Yanling in the twelfth year of the Republic and lived with him for three years, giving birth to three sons: the eldest, Gongji; the second, Gongwei; and the youngest, Gonglin. This summer, Cheng and Shen disagreed, and the two parties separated. When signing the separation agreement, the mother-son relationship and all legal rights of the three children were terminated. Later, Cheng filed a lawsuit in court to confirm that the agreement was invalid, and the court ordered it to be revoked, restoring her rights as a mother to the children. Recently, she learned that Shen's wife, Zhou, was allegedly mistreating the three sons born to Cheng. Since the mother-son relationship is rooted in nature, she cannot stand by and watch them suffer. She requested that the three sons be returned to her for care. The case has been heard twice. In order to settle the matter, the judge ordered Shen to appear in court in person at the last hearing so that reconciliation could be carried out. The plaintiff also eagerly wanted to see her estranged husband to ask about the recent situation of the three sons. However, yesterday, when the hearing was scheduled, the defendant still did not appear. His attorney, Sun Yuan, claimed that Shen was recently ill and bedridden and therefore could not comply with the order to appear in court. He speculated that the plaintiff's intention in filing the lawsuit was nothing more than concern that her three sons were being abused and she could not bear to stand by and watch, so she wanted to take them back for care. Now, the defendant is willing to have his attorney sign a statement in court that he will never abuse them. If the plaintiff is still not at ease, she can ask a doctor to examine the three children's bodies once a month to see if they are ill or have suffered any other pain. The plaintiff's attorney, Jiang Yiping, claimed that the reason why the plaintiff wanted the defendant to appear in court was nothing more than wanting the two parties to remember their three years as husband and wife after meeting and ask him to be kind to the three children. If so, the case could be reconciled in court by both parties signing. If the defendant is unable to attend today's hearing due to illness, then his three sons may as well be brought to court to see if they have been abused. This would reassure the plaintiff and expedite the case. Now, the defendant's side is trying to avoid a meeting between the two parties. It is not known why. Moreover, at the last hearing, the court ordered him to appear in court. It should be known that the court is the most respected institution in the country and should comply with its orders. His attorney claimed that the defendant did not intentionally defy the law but was actually bedridden. A doctor could be called to verify this. As for the issue of raising the three children, it is better to have the defendant personally issue a certificate that he will never abuse them, so as to avoid him having to appear in court while ill. At this point, the court ordered that the case be postponed until Shen Yanling recovers from his illness and reports to the court, and then the hearing will be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Representatives Returning to Shanghai from Wuxi National Products Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Fire at Taifengsheng</h3>
<p>Taifengsheng Tobacco and Paper Shop, located at No. 93, the first house on the left in Lane 4 of Yuqing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Concession, is owned by cigarette merchant Yan Ziming. Its business is quite good. Yesterday afternoon at around 4 o'clock, an apprentice in the shop was transferring kerosene from a spout into a ceramic jar for sale when he accidentally started a fire. Because the winter festival was approaching, the shop had a lot of inventory piled up, which caused the fire to spread uncontrollably. The shop's staff and apprentices, a total of five or six people, initially tried to put out the fire, but the incense candles and paper ingots hanging in the tobacco and paper shop caught fire in an instant. Moreover, the back door of the shop had long been nailed shut, so they had to jump out from the counter. The fire brigade rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and put out the fire. However, the adjacent Far East Shoe and Hat Shop was also affected. Afterwards, Detective Yin Bingnan from the Da Zimingzhong Police Station went to investigate the cause of the fire and interrogated the apprentice to determine the cause of the fire for verification.</p>

The bureau also has a guest from a large leather workshop in the north, who, in order to avoid the chaos of the Japanese invasion, has entrusted them to sell a large amount of leather goods at a loss, which is an even harder opportunity to come by.

Domestic artists and color printing stone artists can try to buy one and use it.</p>

<h3>Mr. Gao Jinbai's News (Hang More Maps of National Humiliation to Awaken Patriotism)</h3>
<p>To make the public care about saving the country, the first thing is to make them know how to cherish the country's territory and national rights. In addition to verbal propaganda, powerful assistance is provided by words and pictures. Verbal propaganda can only stimulate temporarily, unlike words and pictures, which are permanent. In particular, pictures are even more moving. Therefore, I believe that in public gathering places, in addition to setting up slogans and national humiliation flags everywhere, maps of national humiliation of China should be added (such as the territory lost in the past dynasties since the Qing Dynasty and the border areas coveted by the powers recently). They should be expressed in concise words and highly stimulating colors, so that the public can feel that losing an inch of territory is like an inch of heartbreak, and they care about losing territory as much as they care about losing private farmland, and their patriotism will rise. Patriots love their families. It is best to prepare several maps, but the price of maps published by various bookstores is too high, making it difficult for the general public to buy them. Furthermore, Chinese families with blank walls often like to hang calligraphy and paintings for appreciation, so there is a lack of things that arouse national ideas. As far as I can see, there are many people who know their hometown and county but do not know their province, and who know the name of China but do not know how large China is or what the terrain is like. It is difficult to escape the blame for the lack of popular education. Even those who have received education and can pay attention to this are probably only a few.</p>
<p>(Reply) As the year is ending, and families are furnishing and all public agencies are renewing their arrangements, hanging more maps of national humiliation to awaken patriotic thoughts is a very good idea and is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>To the Editor, I recently read an article in today's newspaper about the establishment of the People's Governance Association, which listed me as one of the initiators. I have not joined the association, nor am I one of its initiators. Apart from one or two old friends, I am also unfamiliar with many of the initiators listed in your newspaper.

<h3>Memories of Dai Liang</h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>Mr. He Tianjian, a famous painter from Xishan, is a warm-hearted and upright person. Since the invasion of Liaoning and Jilin by the Japanese, he has written poems and lyrics out of indignation, many of which are慷慨激昂. Readers are often moved to tears. This time, Ms. He Xiangning launched a charity calligraphy and painting exhibition to relieve the national crisis. He Tianjian ran around and called out, doing his best to promote it. The fact that people from all walks of life gathered upon hearing the news is due to He Tianjian's efforts. Yesterday, I saw his painting of "Sunset over the Border Town," with yellow sand all over the field and the ancient fortress desolate. It is truly a masterpiece, and on each corner is inscribed with two quatrains: "The setting sun hangs low over the great river, the sky still threatens to fall on our heads. How many bones are buried in the desert, it is even more appropriate to go to the border town. Apes, cranes, sand worms enter the ashes of the劫, the general's ambition has the remaining sorrow. Luge is not allowed to wield the setting sun, allowing the rivers and mountains to be destroyed." The words are painful, and the language is startling, making it unbearable to read. Alas, Mr. He is indeed a伤心 person in troubled times.</p>

<h3>From the Wastepaper Basket, a Eulogy</h3>
<p>China has no right and wrong. The world has no right and wrong. If there is right and wrong, then the strong are right, the weak are wrong; the rich are right, the poor are wrong; the victors are right, the defeated are wrong; the lucky are right, the unlucky are wrong. Those who should speak fairly do not speak fairly but speak perfunctorily, thus turning wrong into right, and right and wrong are eliminated.</p>
<p>When the National Assembly opened, Mr. Cai Yuanpei wrote a four-character eulogy, in which two lines read: "Gathered together: farmers, workers, merchants, and landowners." Following this guide, we could not find a single true farmer who relies on farming to eat, nor could we find a single true worker who relies on working to eat in the assembly hall. Mr. Cai, who should speak fairly, is as disappointing as Mr. Gandhi being perfunctory with the French.</p>
<p>Suppose that fifty or a hundred years later, a little Hu Shi, fond of doing textual research, mistakenly uses the handwritten eulogy of the highly respected Mr. Cai as evidence, wouldn't that turn falsehood into truth and wrong into right?</p>
<p>In the end, right and wrong cannot be easily buried. Historical materials sometimes escape from the wastepaper basket. Below is a piece of writing that could not be published in newspapers at the time and fortunately was not completely burned in the stove. It is now published for readers to judge who is right and who is wrong.</p>
<p>"Sun Yat-sen's Testament: The world belongs to all. The National Assembly, with whom do you share the joy?</p>
<p>Looking at the representatives: scholars and merchants are prosperous. Farmers do not look like farmers; workers do not look like workers.</p>
<p>Farmers and workers are all scholars; scholars are also farmers and workers. Public servants in power usurp the role of masters:</p>
<p>The foundation of the country is carelessly entrusted to the east wind. Dissenting believers flee east and west.</p>
<p>The young and promising are felled like withered pines. The people enter hell, building heavens for themselves.</p>
<p>Revolution is discussed in words, but the principles are lost. No longer receiving training, who will follow the trainers?</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's spirit weeps for the heroes. Cai, the elder, is the model for later scholars.</p>
<p>Forgive me for holding dissenting views, my words come from the heart. May you ascend to a high place, awaken the deaf and inspire the blind.</p>
<p>With a change of mind, a snake can be transformed into a dragon. Rainbows are in sight, and plants and trees will flourish again.</p>
<p>The long night is endless, the vast sky is immense. My worries are endless, my hopes are boundless."</p>
<h3>Descendant of Qi Jiguang</h3>
<p>— Bi Yi</p>
<p>There is a village in the northern countryside of Taicang called Dushu Xiang (Reading Lane). It is said to be the place where Shao Bao (Junior Guardian) Qi Jiguang studied. When Shao Bao commanded the Zhejiang troops to quell the Japanese pirates, wherever his army went, he saw an abandoned temple in a place. Bamboo trees were lush, surrounded by clear streams. He then stationed himself there. He often read military books late at night. The lamplight shone outside the forest. A fisherman stopped his boat and secretly listened. The garrison suspected him of being an enemy scout and captured him to the camp. Shao Bao asked and found out that he was a local fisherman. He gave him wine and food. The next day, it spread throughout the city. Later, a certain village was renamed Dushu Xiang to commemorate Shao Bao. The farmers near Dushu Xiang, surnamed Qi, claimed to be descendants of Shao Bao. In the early years of the Qing Dynasty, during the Guangxu reign, Wu Guanghan, a Zhejiang native, was the magistrate of Taicang. An old farmer named Qi was bullied and involved in a lawsuit. He claimed to be a descendant of Qi Jiguang. His ancestor was the sixth-generation grandson of Qi Jiguang, an official in Taicang. After leaving office, he was too poor to return home. The local gentry collected money to buy land and build a house in Dushu Xiang, allowing him to work as a teacher. The official had a reputation for integrity. Also, because of his ancestor, the locals loved him and made such arrangements for him. The old farmer also said that the family genealogy was destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion, so he could not present it for verification. Magistrate Wu sympathized with him greatly and redressed his grievances. Now, the old farmer's grandson, named Xue Lian, graduated from elementary school but could not afford to continue his education. Recently, a national salvation fundraising group organized by a certain school came to Dushu Xiang, giving speeches about the brutality of the Japanese invaders and urging the people to rise up together to kill the enemy. They also mentioned Qi Jiguang's suppression of the Japanese pirates during the Ming Dynasty. Qi Xue Lian, who was already fifteen years old, heard this and claimed that Qi Jiguang was his distant ancestor. He also said that he was eager to study but could not afford to continue his education. If he could still be a student, he would also call on the public to fulfill their duty and not forget his ancestors. At that time, Mr. Zhang, the teacher leading the fundraising group, inquired about Qi Xue Lian's family history in detail, and was touched by his ambition to study and not forget his ancestors. He comforted him with kind words, saying that he would go back and discuss with the principal and colleagues to jointly help him continue his education, and there would certainly be a way to repay him. Qi Xue Lian happily thanked him, saying that if his wish could be fulfilled, he would receive military training in the future. The narrator also said that although Qi Xue Lian was only fifteen years old, he had grown as if he were sixteen or seventeen, and his body was quite developed.</p>
<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa Craze In the town of Pisa, Italy, there is a leaning tower, also a world-famous building. It was built six hundred years ago, entirely of marble. It was originally straight, but soon after completion, the tower base sank on one side, and the slope deepened day by day, threatening to collapse. The tower was originally 180 feet high, and now 17 feet are completely leaning. Father Piccardo, an expert in building church bell towers, seeing that the tower was increasingly leaning and dangerous, wanted to straighten it. He suggested digging under the tower base opposite the leaning side. During the work, a crane could be used to hold the tower base. After completion, it could be slowly lowered. Then the tower would not be leaning but straight. He was very enthusiastic about this plan, believing it could be done. There would be no danger during the work, because he had previously straightened many leaning bell towers of churches, so straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa was also possible. However, the citizens of Pisa caused a great uproar, opposing it. Because travelers from all over the world, impressed by the name of the Leaning Tower, came to Pisa to sightsee, bringing a lot of income to the local area every year. Once the Leaning Tower was straightened, it would be unremarkable, and the income would naturally be greatly affected. Father Piccardo's plan was thus shattered.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on the National Goods Movement in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Since the national crisis, the boycott of Japanese goods has gradually shown results. This is due to the determination of the people of the whole country and the automatic awakening of the business community. Recently, Japan's violent acts of seizing Jinzhou and encroaching on Pingjin have become increasingly serious. Therefore, the boycott movement should be further promoted to deal a final blow to the Japanese. However, boycotting Japanese goods is only a temporary solution. Increasing production and promoting national goods are the fundamental solutions. Unfortunately, in the past three months, the production of national goods has not increased, and sales have not been very prosperous. Goods from European and American countries continue to flow in, filling the market. This outflow of rights and interests is a hidden danger. It is a case of "gaining in the mulberry field but losing in the elm forest." For the current plan, the mentality of the Chinese people competing for foreign goods should be fundamentally eliminated. The improvement of production and sales by the industrial and commercial sectors is even more urgent.</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Yunshu of Suzhou Park is a patriotic person. In view of the decline of the national goods movement, he invited local people to discuss solutions. It was decided to hold a National Goods Exhibition in the park on New Year's Day next year, lasting for three days. Exhibits are currently being collected. Since this news spread, a considerable number of handicrafts have been sent from national goods factories in various places for display. All of them are surprisingly innovative and of the highest quality, even surpassing imported goods. Mr. Fan believes that the maritime industry is prosperous and is a major base for the production of national goods. He intends to extensively collect exhibits in the hope of a successful exhibition.</p>
<h3>Moral Education and Aesthetic Education (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fang Jiangshui</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Xiao Zisheng gave a lecture at the China Academy of Art, expressing his unique views on art. His clear words were like jade fragments, moving and inspiring. Here is a summary of his main points:</p>
<p>In recent times, people have advocated adding aesthetic education to the three educations of moral, physical, and intellectual education, calling it five educations. This has a lot of scholarship. In fact, the distinction between humans and animals lies in the word "beauty." Our country is an ancient civilization and has made many great contributions to art. Even the so-called design universities in Paris today mostly learn from our ancient relics, regarding them as models. This is clearly revealed. However, our country should reflect on itself. It is still the same as before, without any progress. This is not only the shame of the art world but also the shame of the education world. The design department in foreign countries can be called a university. Our Ministry of Education cannot call the entire art school a college. Unless this stain is removed, how can art be promoted? As for the social aspect, many people regard art as a pastime, thinking it is a trivial skill that gentlemen do not engage in. This is truly a mistaken view that should be corrected as soon as possible. They do not know that aesthetic education occupies an important position in culture. Mencius said, "Its Qi is supremely great and strong." I believe that only aesthetic education can match it. Beauty reaches its extreme, then one can be selfless, then one can transcend, leading into a state of purity. Cai Yuanpei wants to replace religion with aesthetic education. There is a reason for this. I have often thought that to save the world and eliminate wars, we should turn to aesthetic education. There is absolutely no beauty in brutal and inhuman acts. If we want beauty to exist, then brutal acts can be eliminated. Aesthetic education is actually the foundation of moral education. However, beauty and morality have a mutual relationship. Beauty can be the foundation of morality, and morality can also be the foundation of beauty. What is the difference between an artist and a craftsman? One is confined to imitation, the other can create. One is mechanical, the other is rich in thought. Thought is spirit, which is personality. Therefore, the artist's expression has personality everywhere. A hundred people write poetry, and each poem is different. A hundred people write prose, and each piece of prose is different. A hundred people do calligraphy and painting, and each person's calligraphy and painting are also different. This is because the thoughts, spirits, and personalities of these hundred people are different, so their expressions are different. With noble thoughts, great spirit, and pure personality, they will naturally flow between the works. Their works can be noble, great, and pure. This is the distinction between elegance and vulgarity. Therefore, artists must have the cultivation of personality. In today's world, people deceive each other, and lack of integrity and shame have become commonplace. To talk about personality in this situation, wouldn't people laugh at it as being pedantic? However, if you want to know why a person is a person, it is because they have personality.</p>
<p>A person has both spirit and body. In the physical self, people are no different. Only the spiritual self is the true self. Human life is divided into three stages. Before the embryo is formed, there is no knowledge or awareness, called unconsciousness. When extremely sleepy, falling asleep in a daze is called knowing, but it is actually not knowing. It is called not knowing, but it is actually knowing. This is called semi-consciousness. When the spirit is lively and thoughts are rich, one is always aware. This is called full consciousness. It can also be called spiritual life. During this period of life, there are behaviors like those in the unconscious and semi-conscious eras. Therefore, spiritual life must be cultivated. With cultivation, one can have personality.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Fan, the preparation for the exhibition has been underway for some time, and the arrangements are beginning to take shape. The deadline for collecting exhibits is set for the 29th of this month. For items that are well-known national goods, such as crepe and Lian Shi paper, there is no need to send them to the exhibition. The most welcome items are newly invented or imitated goods that are similar to imported goods, such as thermos bottles, electrical materials, and woolen fabrics. For various new products that are too bulky to be sent, samples, models, and photos are also acceptable. The exhibition venue in the park is spacious and luxuriously decorated. At that time, scholars and women will gather in Suzhou, adding many beautiful stories. (Moved to repay the black)</p>
<p>▲ Short News A painting exhibition by famous Shanghai painters, hosted by Xue Baolun, has collected more than 500 paintings from various famous artists. It is scheduled to be displayed at the Ningbo Guild Hall on the 25th, 26th, and 27th for three days. Visitors are welcome.</p>
<h3>War! (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Weibin</p>
<p>War! is the only way for weak nations to struggle for survival.</p>
<p>After the European War, Turkey, the sick man of the Near East, was also listed among the defeated countries because of its alliance with Germany. After the signing of the Armistice of Mudros in 1918, all the fortress guns, railways, oil mines, and telegraphs of Turkey, all the tools of authority and production, were probably under the control of the Allied forces. Still not ceasing, there was also an enemy, Greece, backed by Britain, who often wanted to carry out his ambition on the Turkish peninsula. At this time, Turkey was a nation on the verge of collapse, how pitiful. Fortunately, a hero of revival, Kemal Atatürk, emerged. Seeing the pain of the country's disintegration and the people's displacement, he recruited the exiled people in Sivas to establish a republic and appointed himself as the president. He implemented thorough reforms in Ankara, the capital.</p>
<p>But he always felt that the development of the new Turkey was being hindered by the Greek enemy everywhere. As for the banner of the League of Nations, it would of course be revealed in the midst of cannon fire. He felt that if he did not fight the enemy to the death, Turkey could not be promoted in the world.</p>
<p>By chance, in May 1919, Greece sent troops to occupy Smyrna in Turkey. Turkey saw that others were not allowed to sleep soundly beside its bed. Day and night, it was diligently preparing to avenge this. Later, he won a deadly battle, defeating the Greeks and forcing them to flee. Thus, this battle led to the Treaty of Lausanne. Turkey preserved many rights and gradually became stronger. This is observed in the precedent of the world situation. China must fight against the rampant Japanese this time.</p>
<p>Japan's rampage and occupation in the Northeast did not start today. The slaughter on September 18 was just a change from a gradual policy to a sudden and violent means. The Japanese had long regarded Manchuria as the second Korea, on which the Japanese soul relied. Helplessly, the Chinese were accustomed to numbness, and they were ignorant and unaware. They allowed him to encroach and occupy, just like a mild red and swollen external disease. Without resistance, it has grown to such an unmanageable and festering state. It is difficult for him to be reckless. Such an outbreak has awakened the Chinese people, who were deeply asleep in dreams. They hate him deeply and will not live under the same sky. Everyone, old and young, is eager to try his hand on the battlefield with the enemy. The North and South have also reconciled. Now is the time to take advantage of the unified popular sentiment and unite the military power to punish the enemy. It is a sure thing to annihilate him in one fell swoop. This is also observed from the overall situation in the country, and we must not lose the opportunity to fight.</p>
<p>Or someone might say, "Advocating a quick war, have you considered whether the Chinese army can fight or not? Whether the Chinese military equipment can fight or not?"</p>
<p>Those who ask this question should read the history of the Sino-French War and the Sino-Japanese War. The Chinese army has never been defeated. It was defeated by the jealousy and obstruction of the Qing Dynasty officials in the rear. If they can unite and command the formation, then victory or defeat lies in courage and tactics. Ma Zhanshan with several thousand soldiers and horses, can defeat Zhang Hai Peng more than ten thousand of troops, and our army has always been fearless of war, like all human gallantry, if big battle comes, on the contrary, feel as if nothing happened, this those who faced the battle are all said as such. Now the battle account of Huangdu are slightly recorded as follows in order to know soldiers composure.</p>
<p>(The following is what my friend said, he is a veteran platoon leader who has experienced many battles)</p>

<h3>During the Customs Closure, Silver Tightens and Loans Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign banks were closed as usual for Christmas, but some Chinese banks were closed, while others remained open as usual. Therefore, receipts and payments were scarce, and the situation was sluggish. Money shops still followed the old rules, but transactions were also less active. The early market price for foreign silver was 7 yuan 2 fen 2 li, and the noon market price was 7 yuan 2 fen 2 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half, which was up 2 hao and a half from the previous noon.

Transactions for banks and Chinese merchants were 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The overnight loan rate opened at 8 fen in both the early and noon markets. Silver was very ample. Money shops received and paid 9.67 million yuan in foreign public orders and over 5.2 million yuan in silver public orders, because it was the 25th day of the month, a major settlement period, so receipts and payments were quite busy.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Yarn Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The yarn market was calm, and the situation was slightly firm, but the overall situation was still weak, because the situation was not good, and the Japanese invaders were becoming more and more fierce in the Northeast, resulting in financial difficulties and a lack of confidence. Most retail investors were bearish, and Japanese yarn has been particularly active recently, with more and more shipments to other ports. The Sichuan help quantity is still healthy.</p>
<p>▲ Human Label Slightly Rises The Human Label opened in the morning market, with foreign cotton slightly firmer. There was a lack of trading in the market. The morning market was slightly stronger, with each month rising by 1,235 qian. The afternoon price for this month fell by 8 qian, and the far-term price rose by 12 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 8,600 bales. The sales were Rongxing 550 bales, Taixing 550 bales, and Changfeng 200 bales.

Among the customer gangs, Sichuan bought 850 bales, the interior bought 80 bales, Yunnan bought 40 bales, Guangdong bought 125 bales, miscellaneous gangs bought 10 bales, and fellow traders bought 10 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Follows American Cotton and Trends Firmer</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly firmer due to the slight rise in American cotton. People were more optimistic, and the bulls were tightening their grip. However, all factories with real demand were closed, because foreign cotton had already absorbed its fill, and native cotton had no appetite. The arrival of cotton from Hankou was increasing daily, but the situation for branded cotton was very strong, because non-industry players and bulls were absorbing it without moving.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Label for This Month Rises 4 Qian The Hankou Label opened in the morning market and was firmer due to the rise in foreign cotton. Each month rose by 12 qian, but this month rose by 4 qian. In the afternoon, it rose again by 5 fen to 1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 44,000 dan. The sales were Senkang 1,000 dan, Yichang 1,700 dan, Yiyu 1,400 dan, Dachang 1,100 dan, Yifeng 1,000 dan, and Ruiyuan 3,200 dan.

<p>▲ Factory Demand Silent There is no spot cotton business. All factories have taken no action.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>▲ Indian Cotton Market Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to buying by traders and foreign merchants. There was a lack of sellers.

<h3>Grain, River Downstream Rice Market Flat and Trending Higher</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai South Yesterday, the source was No. 267. The arrival of early rice was scarce, with a small amount of movement, about 1,400 to 1,500 shi. The high-priced goods were stable. Zhongguan white japonica was offered up by about a jiao. Qingjiao thin rice was sold as soon as it arrived. The opening price fluctuated by 1 jiao and a half. Foreign Dujian each maintained the original level. The exchange rate was neutral. The downstream market was slightly visible. Foreign rice from Ningbo and Yuebang was purchased, so the market price rose by about a jiao.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha Yesterday, there were not many goods coming from the west. There were quite a few people coming to the market in the morning, but the situation was difficult to grasp. Kunshan and Jiangyin rice were the most numerous. The market price rose by 1 jiao. Nangang early and late rice from rural gangs had slight responses. The market had no ups and downs. Dujian rice arriving at the port was weak in appetite, and the price was short by several fen. A carload of Nanjing tip rice arrived. The street's outlet was not weak, but the trend was weak.</p>
<h3>Yantai Gang Tries Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was stable. There were no new transactions for futures due to the closure of foreign firms. The return cargo was only one or two hundred tons. The market price did not change much. The street's appetite for spot goods was still good. The Yantai Gang initially tried to load several hundred bags of small twisted rice. The Tianjin Gang also made inquiries. Therefore, the market was quite stable. The Tongshi opened 1,000 bags of small twisted rice, priced at 9 yuan 4 jiao to 9 yuan 2 jiao 7 fen. 1,500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were priced at 11 yuan to 10 yuan 08 jiao 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Recent Flour Suddenly Turns Lively and Profitable</h3>
<p>▲ Tianjin Sales Are Lively... Huafeng Compensates</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market price for each month rose by about 12 jiao due to the price of foreign wheat. The market sentiment for each month was generally calm. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the market for this month suddenly turned lively and profitable (because the exchange was the last day), because Huafeng factory's compensation was very smooth, coupled with the active spot sales from Tianjin Gang, the flour from large factories was very firm. By the time of closing, it was again due to foreign short sellers having to compensate, so it rose again by nearly a fen. The far-term months also saw an increase due to the improvement in the near term, but the trend was still flat, with little increase. As a result, this month rose 2 fen 7 li and a half compared to the previous day, January rose 1 fen and a half, February and March rose 7 li and a half, April rose 5 li, and May rose 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Branded Wheat Short Accounts Prevent Squeezing and Compensation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month was generally stable, because the price of foreign wheat was still slightly better, and most of the short sellers, fearing that the source of spot wheat would not continue in the future, had to prevent being squeezed, so there were quite a few people engaged in compensation, so although transactions were not very smooth, the market was firm and stable. There will be no transactions within the year. In these ten days, we should look at the foreign exchange situation and the international changes to determine the rise and fall. As a result, January was 2 fen better than the previous day, February was 2 fen better, March was 1 fen better, and April and May were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Foreign Silk Firms Closed for Christmas for Two Days</h3>
<p>▲ Must Wait Until Next Monday to Return to Normal</p>
<p>Yesterday (25th) Friday was Christmas Day (commonly called Foreign Winter Solstice). Customs was closed as usual, and banks and foreign firms were closed. There was no market for exchange rates. Foreign silk firms must be closed for two days (ie 25th and 26th), and the 27th is Sunday, so they must wait until next Monday (ie 28th) to return to normal. Therefore, the foreign silk firms will still be closed tomorrow, and there will be no market report.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Flannel Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for woolen and fur goods remained sluggish. Although the quoted price for flannel also decreased, the actual transaction price remained stable. The market atmosphere saw no significant change. Taihe's black fleece was still sold at three taels, three mace, and five fen. Long-haired camel fleece was priced at four taels and nine mace. Rongtai's "Attracting a Son-in-Law" double-sided yellow camel fleece was at four taels, nine mace, and five fen. Rongtai, Mi Ye, and Haohua's Yuan-colored "Big Sea Tiger" was at eight taels, one mace, and five fen. Silver fleece was at four taels and nine mace. First-grade sable flannel sold for five taels and four mace, while second-grade sable flannel was at four taels and five mace. Taihe's "Sudden Silk Leopard Skin" flannel was priced at four taels, nine mace, and five fen, while the *Li* was at four taels and eight mace. Yesterday, only the domestically produced wide and narrow striped camel fleece saw a slight change. This was due to the recent establishment of six or seven new factories, which significantly increased the production of camel fleece, leading to an oversupply. As a result, prices plummeted, with a distinction between quoted and actual transaction prices, causing significant market confusion. Some were selling at one tael and seven or eight mace, while others were selling around two taels. Established brands like *Lun*’s Tiger design, Wei Yi’s Double Deer design, Shengda Dragon and Phoenix, and *Xian* Camel Heavenly Crane design still quoted at two taels and two mace and five fen, and first-class wool back fabric was said to be two taels and nine mace.</p>

<h3>To Nanyang</h3>
<p>— Resurgence</p>
<p>(1) Leaving the Green Hills of My Homeland</p>
<p>Many people believe Nanyang to be a world where "gold paves the roads, and diamonds decorate the windows." They think that no matter how foolish or dull, anyone who goes to Nanyang can bring back handfuls of gold, platinum, and diamonds. This is truly a myth from ancient times. Black-haired, yellow-faced people in this golden world are seen as mere animals by the high-nosed, blue-eyed individuals, who exploit and trample on them at will. Superficially, it seems that the sufferers in the colonies still regard us as deities or tigers, allowing us to extract their marrow to fill the holes dug out by others. However, what have we ever gained? Only sorrow and indignation fill our chests, and tears stream down our faces. The most obvious example is the homeless and unprotected Chinese laborers. Besides their skin turning dark and their bodies covered in scars, they only have a set of black clothes and a copper-coin-tied waistband. If there is any consolation, it is that their soft muscles have become much tougher compared to before they left the country.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>My motive for going to Java was perhaps influenced by the lure of gold. Although I cannot recall or distinguish it now, I can still recall some fragments of the past.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>It was a morning when the green water blended with the sky. I stood on the pier of S Port, my astonished eyes radiating onto the rising and falling waves of the inner harbor. At the same time, sailboats, sampans, and small steamers flying foreign flags floated on the turquoise waves, and the shadows of large ships also appeared before my eyes. If we humans with two legs were to make a comparison, then sailboats, sampans, and small steamers would be like young children or skin-and-bone patients, walking shakily. Large ships would be like healthy individuals striding swiftly. Occasionally, the ripples in the inner harbor reminded me of the overwhelming storms in the vast sea. The terrifying emotions of my first voyage surged into my heart in vain.</p>
<p>However, more than ten years ago, my father took a large ship to Java and arrived safely at his destination. Millions of overseas Chinese have traveled back and forth across the sea on these ships, battling the sea god, and have rarely encountered accidents. Thinking this, the fear of my first voyage that had been blocking my chest was swept away like a storm clearing the clouds. I felt the joy of riding the long winds and breaking through thousands of miles of waves. I thought of the faint sunrise and the fiery ball of the sun rolling into the bottom of the sea in the evening. Admiring the fiery ball rolling back and forth on the vast and boundless ocean surface, where no green mountains or land could be seen, was such a delightful thing.</p>
<p>Finally, I followed my companions and luggage and cargo boxes, and was carried by a sailboat past the gunboats of the Japanese Empire to the ship. Thank God, thank my companions, thank Uncle Da Yi for protecting my luggage and supporting my unsteady body.</p>
<p>A gust of wind came, and the azure sea immediately formed a small mountain, constantly kissing our sailboat. Waves of seawater also crashed towards us. The seawater flowed over my head and onto my lips. I lightly licked it with my tongue, and its taste was even stronger than salt, both salty and astringent. I wanted to spit it out but couldn't, and I couldn't swallow it either. Moreover, there was no fresh water to rinse my mouth. In this extremely painful moment, suddenly the sailboat tilted to the left, and the highly stacked luggage rolled down one by one, rolling onto our bodies and falling into Uncle Da Yi's arms. Fortunately, the thing that pressed on me was a light clothing package, and I only felt a soft thing in my arms. I didn't suffer any pain, nor did my arms or legs break. After the terror, I rejoiced in the comfort of safety.</p>
<p>Because the ship was still four or five hours away from leaving the port, the passengers in the pile of luggage and cargo boxes also felt the stuffiness of the weather and started shouting loudly.</p>
<p>Uncle Da Yi was an old friend of my father's. He had a naturally solemn and magnificent face, and he was recognized by his friends. His heart was very pure, without the slightest stain. I heard that he always had the behavior of "drawing his sword to help when he sees injustice on the road." This is all the precious behavior of chivalrous people. Because of this, although my mother shed many tears about her young son's departure from his hometown and country, and stubbornly held my hand, preventing me from going, the biggest reason she finally waved her loving arms and encouraged me to leave was that Uncle Da Yi would protect me on the journey, which could reduce the worries in her chest, and fill her with hopeful enthusiasm. She hoped that Uncle Da Yi could take me to Nanyang to do business with my father, and teach my elderly father to worry less.</p>
<p>The sounds on the ship stopped, and I immediately felt loneliness and the sadness of leaving my country and hometown. I thought of my white-haired mother, my weak younger brother, my teacher, and even my little classmate whose nickname was "Wax Candle." Once, when the history teacher was taking a nap, he poured a cup of hot tea next to his buttocks, and shouted loudly outside his room, deliberately waking him from his sweet dreams. He turned over, wetting his pants with the hot tea, and while pulling at his wet pants, his eyes blazed with fire as he grabbed a whip and chased after our prank. I also thought of that. However, after a few hours, the ship was about to sail out, and the distance between me and my mother, weak brother... gradually became longer. When the tide of missing my family was surging in my chest, I suddenly heard a heartbreaking line of poetry, and I cut off my thoughts of home. All my attention was absorbed by him.</p>
<p>"Leaving home young, returning old,</p>
<p>My accent unchanged, but my temples frosted."</p>
<p>Oh, the heartbreaking words of misery. Wherever the waves of his verse reached, people showed expressions of disgust, as if they wanted to rebuke him. Their lips trembled slightly.</p>
<p>He was about thirty-five years old or older, and his face was full of twilight. Fortunately, his copper-rimmed glasses and oil-stained long gown supported his appearance. Otherwise, he would not have been able to avoid the small humiliation from the crowd. However, because he posed as a poet, not only did no one dare to accuse him, but there were also people who expressed sympathy.</p>
<p>"Old sir, I'm afraid this old bone of mine won't be able to return home."</p>
<p>"Ha, you're too kind, brother. Your forehead is shining brightly. Saying something ominous will bring good luck. Heaven will surely send you a great fortune in the future."</p>
<p>"Haha, old sir, thank heaven and earth, I respectfully accept the old sir's golden words."</p>
<p>He cupped his hands towards that old overseas Chinese man for a while, and then swayed and walked, chanting his verse. That old overseas Chinese man was so happy that even sweat was startled out of his flesh, covering his forehead. He couldn't help but wave his hand and wipe his forehead. In this way, the sweat disappeared, and the radiance also vanished.</p>

<h3>What I Saw on the Road</h3>
<p>— Shadow Guest</p>
<p>I, who am accustomed to walking as if in a carriage, was walking alone on the road. At this early morning hour, pedestrians were few. There were only those who were forced by their living environment, such as the coolies going to the factories, the students going to school, and myself, who, in order to seek knowledge for the future masters of the country, had no choice but to crawl out of the warm quilt and carry the cold, hard schoolbag to school. We shivered in the northwest wind, hurrying along. Besides the so-called mysterious people, there were also roaring motor vehicles, humming rickshaws, clattering horse-drawn carriages, and dinging electric trams, interspersed with a few squeaking wheelbarrows. The vehicles rushed back and forth, hurrying along the road, as if each was rushing to a funeral, as if they were rushing to catch a train. I really don't understand what they are so busy with. But I fear they are all seeking a new continent in the tide of their living environment. Ah, besides the noisy vehicles, the road was mostly silent and boring. Oh, on both sides of the long, arrow-like road were the so-called trees planted by foreigners. In spring and summer, the dense green leaves were like cool awnings. At this time, they had been invited by the God of Wind to hibernate. Only the dry and unadorned branches remained, as if each was expressing its exquisite curves and competing for beauty. Unfortunately, the color was too unsightly, standing lifelessly on the side of the road. Looking at them, they were arranged neatly and uniformly. Much effort was put into their cultivation.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the distance, there was a black lacquered chartered car, inside which sat a white and chubby, oversized figure. The rickshaw puller was running frantically, shouting and yelling, fearing that his master had some extremely important matter. He brushed past me as if flying. I didn't pay much attention, but simply walked alone, looking around, trying to hurry on my way. After walking a few steps, a rude and unpleasant voice suddenly came.</p>
<p>"Damn your mother, are you blind? What are you busy with so early in the morning? Does it hurt my old man's waist? Get out of here for me!"</p>
<p>Oh dear, I was startled by this scolding. I quickly turned back and saw a crowd of people watching the fun, with a chartered car in the middle. Because I am fond of sticking my nose into other people's business, I also stepped back a few steps and squeezed into the crowd. Because of my short stature, I used the strength I had from eating porridge in the morning and squeezed into the crowd, so that I could see clearly what was going on. Looking ahead, it turned out to be the black lacquered chartered car that had just rushed past me, and the oversized figure was still sitting inside.</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm really sorry. My rickshaw puller is rude. He accidentally bumped into your waist. I'm sorry, it wasn't intentional. Let's just let it go."</p>
<p>After hearing the words of this oversized-figure-like passenger, I realized that the rickshaw puller had bumped into this gentleman's waist because he was in a hurry. Looking at this gentleman again, he looked a bit refined, but he was wearing a uniform, looking like a soldier student, with a blue sign hanging beside him. I also didn't understand what kind of person he was. He was very fierce, grabbing the rickshaw puller and scolding,</p>
<p>"Humph, so easy, let it go? There's no such cheap thing. I won't hit you now, but I'll ask you to go to the police station to reason!"</p>
<p>Saying this, he dragged and pulled him like a chicken, with ease, his ears red with anger, and his face as stern as iron. Although the rickshaw puller was in the northwest wind, he was still sweating profusely, perhaps because of running and being frightened. His eyes looked bitterly at his master, as if begging his master to prevent him from suffering in the police station because of his master's oversized-figure face. But his master was also pleading for the rickshaw puller, saying,</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm really sorry, it was his fault, he shouldn't have been so busy. He mistakenly bumped into your honorable waist. I'll have him apologize and kowtow. Ah San, quickly kowtow and apologize to the gentleman."</p>
<p>"Humph, what's so special about a rickshaw puller kowtowing? My waist still hurts. There's no such easy thing. Come out quickly, put down the car, and go to the police station."</p>
<p>The soldier-like person was being fierce again, forcefully</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>dragging the pitiful rickshaw puller. But the rickshaw puller stood still, stubbornly refusing to move. The Chinese onlookers watched the event, minding their own business, as if watching a play. Not a single hero or chivalrous person came out to uphold justice. Alas, just as they were dragging each other, the military-uniformed person said,</p>
<p>"You're stubborn, refusing to go? I'll call the police..."</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, he took out a shiny police whistle from the pocket beside his trousers and put it to his mouth.</p>
<p>"Woo... woo... woo..." he blew. Everyone was stunned, not knowing what kind of tricks they were playing. He had started blowing the police whistle. The timid onlookers ran away as if fleeing, fearing interference or accidentally eating a peanut (i.e., a stray bullet). As for me, I also wanted to leave, but my curiosity glued my feet to the ground, and I still didn't move, standing in place, wanting to see what big deal was going on, and also wanting to know what kind of person this fierce and unreasonable person was, what kind of important big shot, because he was wearing a uniform, which made me unable to guess. If he was a student, oh, no, a student is a person who studies, has knowledge, learning, manners, and... enough. I think a student wouldn't be so extremely rude. But a soldier? I was just guessing when I suddenly heard... a Chinese police officer running as fast as horses' hooves. This police officer was good, brave. When he heard the police whistle, he didn't care what was going on and came to the rescue, risking his life. He wasn't neglecting his duty. I watched him run over in a panic, to the side of the crowd. The group of onlookers also hurriedly loosened the circle. The police officer squeezed in without asking the reason, grabbed the poor rickshaw puller, and then asked,</p>
<p>"What's going on? Everyone, don't argue. Go to the police station to reason."</p>
<p>"Hey, police officer, you're a reasonable person. He wasn't careful and the car bumped into this gentleman's waist. Apologizing isn't enough. He wants to go to court. Humph, humph."</p>
<p>"Police officer, take this rickshaw puller to the police station, and I'll come later. This person is extremely unreasonable. What's he so busy with so early in the morning? He bumped into someone's waist and still wants to act violently. It's outrageous. He's just blind."</p>
<p>"Sir, I don't understand. I don't know what's going on. It was just a slight bump. It wasn't a big deal. I apologized and kowtowed, but it's not enough. He wants me to go to jail. I'm not going no matter what."</p>
<p>"Humph, you're fierce, still being stubborn. I'm going to take you there no matter what. The police officer is here. What are you afraid of?"</p>
<p>These three plaintiffs and defendants were each telling their stories to the police officer. I thought this police officer would definitely arrest the rickshaw puller, but unexpectedly, I heard,</p>
<p>"Haha, I thought it was a murder or robbery. I rushed over in a hurry. Who knew it was just a small matter? Let it go, sir. Consider yourself unlucky to have been bumped. Scold him a few times and let it go. Why make such a fuss and blow the whistle, causing everyone to squeeze together and watch the fun, hindering traffic?" Saying this, he actually raised a black and white mixed stick and drove away the onlookers who weren't paying. But everyone only retreated a little and didn't disperse. But the soldier was not convinced and still said,</p>
<p>"No, no. I was walking properly. Why did he have to bump into me? The road is public, so everyone can walk on it. There's no such easy thing as bumping into each other. I must give him a good lesson. No matter what, you have to arrest him for me."</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, why? You and I are both Chinese, and the rickshaw puller is also Chinese. Everyone is a compatriot. Why argue so much over a small matter? He didn't mean to bump into you. It was unintentional. Scold him and let it go. Why go to the police station and let the foreigners judge? Sir, it's not worth it, right? Why? Everyone is Chinese. Forgive and forgive." This police officer finished speaking calmly, with a somewhat mocking attitude.</p>
<p>When I heard him say this, I noticed that many onlookers and the passenger in the chartered car nodded in agreement, because what he said was reasonable and methodical. When I finished listening to his words, I immediately felt a pang of sadness. The hot blood in my whole body circulated rapidly, causing the muscles in my body to tense up, my hair to stand on end, and half of my body to feel numb. I was almost about to explode. Alas, this police officer must have come from a poor family. That's why he came out to patrol the streets in the scorching sun and cold wind. It goes without saying that his knowledge is very shallow. He can only rely on the strong and tall body that his parents naturally gave him to make a living. He's swaggering in a life as an uneducated police officer. The words he spoke were well-thought-out. Alas, I admire and am grateful to him. Unexpectedly, the military-uniformed person is less moral than the police officer. It's a pity. Alas, looking at this soldier-like person again, because his ability to argue was not as good as the police officer's, he let go and walked away with a red face. That passenger repeatedly thanked the police officer and hurriedly dragged the car away. But the police officer pulled at his car's canopy and said,</p>
<p>"Next time, pull the car slowly. Don't rush like you're going to your mother's funeral. You'll offend people again."</p>
<p>"Yes, I wasn't running fast."</p>
<p>"Thank you, thank you for your trouble. Goodbye."</p>
<p>This oversized-figure-like gentleman thanked the police officer and rode away as if flying. Because the car was gone, the people also dispersed. The police officer and the soldier had both left. I quickly took a step to catch up, wanting to see what kind of badge this soldier was wearing. Luckily, he was walking towards me. I looked at it and saw the words</p>
<p>"×××××× Volunteer Army" written on it.</p>
<p>When I saw this, I was immediately tense in my mind, feeling a bit dizzy like after drinking wine, feeling vaguely as if I was in the clouds, my feet not on solid ground.</p>
<p>Alas, "Volunteer Army," isn't it organized to resist Japan? Aren't they students? "Resisting Japan and saving the country," what does it mean? Resisting what Japan? Saving what country? Who is the Volunteer Army organized for? Is its responsibility to make trouble on the streets, to be fierce and domineering, and to specifically beat its own compatriots? Alas, shouting "Resist Japan and save the country" louder than others, wearing more domestic goods than others, is that the only condition for saving the country? Because of the recent riot in the three northeastern provinces by the Japanese, a so-called both righteous and brave Volunteer Army was organized. What is its responsibility? Is it to save the country, to destroy the country, to fight the Japanese, or to beat its own compatriots?</p>
<p>Alas, I have too many questions. My stupid brain makes me unable to answer them. The more I think about it, the more strange it becomes. The things I encountered on the road this time, the so-called respectable and admirable patriots, the Volunteer Army, are just like this. Alas, this makes me think that the current situation is even more tense. The so-called patriots are saving their country in a big way. I don't know how they are saving it. Propaganda, speeches, strikes, market closures, class boycotts, petitions, donations, and other tricks, are these the methods of saving China? I also don't know. In short, the blind are helping, and the more they help, the more trouble they cause. These kinds of people have come to save the country. The more China is saved, the more prosperous it becomes. The big shots and important figures in the government should resign and step down and let this group of moral, knowledgeable, learned, intelligent, resourceful, and powerful student Volunteer Armies take over. Everyone, wait, wait patiently. The country will not perish. With them in charge, we only need to eat three bowls of rice and mind our own business.</p>
<p>Attached Original Letter</p>
<p>Editor Sir: I, who am completely talentless, have repeatedly seen the Youth Forum in the newspaper, which has made me want to submit an article. But I, who have no learning, am afraid that the article I write will make you laugh your teeth out, so I dare not try. But the other day, when I returned from an outing, I saw this incident on the road, which made my heart ache and brought tears to my eyes. The people of China are already dead. Saving the country, saving the country, is just a game. Alas, those who join the Volunteer Army think that the reputation is good and the clothes are dashing. That's all. What saving the country? Forget it. So I had to pick up my bald pen and use my talentless thoughts to record what happened on the road. It is a true story, not an empty rumor. I hope that the reporter sir will raise your noble hand and include it in your esteemed eyes, leaving a space on the corner of the newspaper to publish it, so that it can be a self-reflection for those in the Volunteer Army. If the words and sentences in the article are not suitable, I hope the editor sir will revise and comment on it slightly. Thank you.</p>
<p>If I am fortunate enough to be included and considered a masterpiece, I will be even more grateful if I am rewarded with author's fee. Originally, I wanted to leave my surname and name and give my address, but I am afraid that this article will be thrown into the ruthless paper basket by the sir, ending in cremation, which would make me feel embarrassed. I dare not reveal my surname. If it is published in the newspaper and I am given a fee, then I will send a letter to inform you of everything. I only hope that the editor sir will leave some room. I respectfully wish you a Happy New Year and Merry Christmas. Shadow Guest by hand, December 22nd, written under the lamp.</p>
<p>Reporter Sir, this novel is incoherent, the sentences are not clear, and the words are scary. I hope the reporter will revise it slightly because I am a child. Please add punctuation marks for me. Also,</p>
